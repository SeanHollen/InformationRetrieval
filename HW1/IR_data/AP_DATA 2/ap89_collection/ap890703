   The Kirov Ballet from Leningrad, not seen here in
25 years, opened at the Metropolitan Opera with ``Le Corsaire,'' a
three-act spectacle with a story that doesn't make much sense but
with exciting virtuoso dancing.
   The Kirov, from Leningrad, is known as a company of great
dancers, floating with grace, in contrast to the more sturdy
athleticism of the Bolshoi Ballet of Moscow. That impression was
confirmed Monday night.
   ``Le Corsaire'' is known to most balletomanes only for the second
act's spectacular trio which Rudolf Nureyev, who defected from the
Kirov, translated into an exhilarating duet for himself and Dame
Margot Fonteyn.
   The full-length ballet dates from 1856 in Paris. It begins with a
shipwreck, with dramatic effects of a sailboat rocking wildly on a
stormy sea.
   Three shipwrecked pirates (corsaires) are found by two Greek
maidens. A slave trader, danced with brio by Konstantin Zakinsky,
captures the maids and one of them, danced by Yelena Pankova, is
sold to a doddering pasha for his harem. The other maiden, the star
of the ballet, danced by Altynai Asylmuratova, is rescued by one of
the pirates, danced by Yevgeni Neff.
   Miss Asylmuratova and Neff are costumed like princess and prince,
and on Monday they danced as regally as they were garbed.
   As much applause as they received, the dazzling Farukh Ruzimatov
received more. He dances the part Nureyev took with Dame Margot.
   The slave trader, captured by the pirates, escapes from them and
recaptures Miss Asylmuratova. Before the pirates finally free both
maidens, most of the third act is taken up with a trio of ballerinas
and the corps de ballet, fluffy in pink and led by Miss Pankova, as
fast and light as a sugarplum fairy. In an effect which no American
company would use, fountains play behind a silver-pink backdrop.
   The ballet's score, more prettified than distinguished, is put
together from music by five composers. The version the Kirov dances
has choreography by Marius Petipa as staged in 1955 by Pyotr Gusev.
   Miss Asylmuratova and Ruzimatov were guest artists of American
Ballet Theater here this past season.
   The Kirov performed in the United States in 1986, a tour which
did not include New York. The present tour has the company at the
Met July 3 through 22, Kennedy Center in Washington July 25 through
Aug. 6, the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco Aug. 9 through
16 and Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, Calif.,
Aug. 18 through 27.

   Tensions escalated Monday between striking coal miners and
company security forces in West Virginia and Kentucky.
   In West Virginia, miner Donald Hampton, 44, of Pemberton was
struck by a car driven by a security guard as the guard left an
Appalachian Mining site, said state police Sgt. J.L. Miller.
   Hampton was treated at Montgomery General Hospital and released.
   In Kentucky, Pike County officials agreed Monday to investigate
allegations that a private security firm is illegally patrolling
Pittston Coal Co. mines.
   More than 120 striking United Mine Workers and their supporters
packed into a Pike County Fiscal Court hearing to protest Vance
International Inc. security guards who first arrived at Eastern Coal
Corp. property on June 20.
   About 1,900 UMW members have been on strike at Pittston holdings
in West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky since April 5. Sympathy
strikes by miners at other operations began June 12, and an
estimated 37,000 miners are off the job in eight states.
   About 12,000 to 15,000 miners were expected to attend a rally
Tuesday in Norton, Va., a UMW official said.
   The UMW also announced another rally would be held Saturday in
West Virginia, with 3,000 to 5,000 striking miners expected.
   Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said he's concerned about the
impact of the strike on foreign coal exports.
   Rockefeller, UMW President Richard Trumka and a coal operator yet
to be named will meet with Japanese steel officials in New York next
Monday to discuss the strike.
   ``We're going to go there and tell them we are still reliable
suppliers of coal,'' Rockefeller said.
   In other action Monday, U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp
postponed until next week a hearing on what he will do if miners
don't obey a national order he issued last week prohibiting sympathy
strikers from engaging in strike-related activities. A majority of
the nation's miners are scheduled to end a two-week vacation period
next week.

<TEXT>
   As the ragtag Continental Army struggled
through the brutal winter at Valley Forge, Gen. George Washington
turned to colonists like Jacob De Haven, who died broke after
loaning $450,000 in money and supplies.
   Or did he?
   Every generation or so, somewhere in the country, someone
claiming ancestry to Jacob De Haven insists he did, and seeks
repayment. Whether interrupted by civil war or failure of Congress
to act, the efforts have been fruitless.
   In U.S. Claims Court in Houston, an attorney fresh out of law
school is awaiting the government's response to the latest request.
The lawsuit filed in March on behalf of some 50,000 De Haven
descendants asks for $450,000 plus 6 percent interest compounded
annually since at least Jan. 1, 1778.
   Put away your calculator _ that's a whopping $98.3 billion.
   This is the first attempt to go through the federal courts
instead of Congress, which was dunned in the 1850s, '70s, '90s and
early in this century. A repayment resolution was introduced, but
tabled, in the House in 1966.
   Jo Beth Kloecker, who took the case about two months after
hanging a shingle outside her first office, in Stafford, Texas,
expects the government's response to the suit _ due in May _
sometime this month.
   The claim is not without legal obstacles:
   The six-year statute of limitations expired about 205 years ago.
The suit seeks repayment from a United States that didn't exist when
the money was lent. And a receipt bearing a red seal of the
government has been missing for years.
   In addition, there's no record of a wealthy Jacob De Haven whose
family owned much of Upper Merion Township, now suburban
Philadelphia.
   According to tax records for 1769-1812, the area's only Jacob De
Haven lived in nearby Whitpain Township, owned an acre of land in
1791 and worked as a laborer, said Judith Meier of the Historical
Society of Montgomery County.
   ``There's no proof of a Jacob De Haven who lived in that time or
died'' who could have loaned $450,000, said Mrs. Meier, whose
curiosity was piqued by the family's claim. ``It looks like it's out
there hanging on an imaginary nail.''
   A family history describes the De Havens as the wealthy owners of
a tract stretching about 10 miles from Norristown to Philadelphia.
Mrs. Meier says the history is a fairy tale and the relatives of the
Jacob De Haven she found were all farmers, weavers, masons, tanners
and other tradesmen.
   The family history also puts De Haven's grave in the cemetery of
Christ (Old Swedes) Church, now in the shadow of an elevated stretch
of Interstate 76. The Rev. John Miller Jr., vicar of the Episcopal
church, said records don't show a Jacob De Haven and most of the
marble markers have been worn bare.
   Kloecker, however, thinks she's got a case.
   ``I know what you're talking about,'' she said of the lack of
records, adding that she has some unrecorded deeds showing Jacob De
Haven existed as in the legend. ``We've got some evidence. I can't
comment on what we've got.''
   Beyond deeds and tax records, the one piece of evidence that
would prove a loan was made _ a receipt _ has been gone for
generations, said Carl DeHaven, a descendant of Jacob's brother,
Samuel. DeHaven, a retired police officer who lives in Gulph Mills,
said it was probably kept in a family bible, now lost.
   Kloecker's client, Thelma Weasenforth Lunaas, is decended from
William De Haven, another brother of Jacob's. Kloecker is asking the
court to declare all the descendants of Jacob and his nine brothers
and sisters part of the class.
   ``They just want his ancestry recognized for his contributions,''
she said.
   DeHaven doubts any of the relatives will see any money.
``Nothing's ever been done over the years and I don't think anything
will be done this time.''
   He would be happy with a monument at Valley Forge National
Historical Park commemorating the De Havens and other families who
gave to the cause.
   In that legendary winter of 1777-78, Washington's troops were
encamped at Valley Forge, about 25 miles from British-occupied
Philadelphia. About 3,000 of the 11,000 troops living in crude log
cabins died. The Continental Congress couldn't appropriate any more
money to send food, so the call went out for citizens to lend the
army money and food.
   Jacob De Haven and many others responded, his descendants say.
Most were repaid after the revolution in Continental dollars. Jacob
refused to accept the unstable scrip, which Kloecker describes as
not ``worth a flip.''

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kremlin's influence here isn't limited
to the troops in the street _ Poland also has Soviet television,
cars, books and newspapers and mandatory Russian language lessons
through high school.
   A changing political climate in Poland and Hungary, where
President Bush will visit next week, has emboldened citizens of the
two countries in recent years to openly express long-silenced
resentment of the Soviet presence.
   At the reburial ceremony in Budapest on June 16 for Imre Nagy,
leader of the 1956 revolt, Viktor Orban of the independent youth
group Fidesz drew loud applause when he advised: ``If we muster
enough courage, then we can put an end to communist dictatorship,
and we can make sure that the immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops
is begun.''
   And in the southern Polish city of Krakow, marches by young
people chanting ``Sowiecki do domu,'' (``Soviets go home,'') have
become regular events. The youth often try to march on the city's
Soviet consulate, and once vandalized a monument to Red Army war
dead, prompting an apology to the Soviet ambassador by Prime
Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski.
   The Red Army is officially on hand to defend the Warsaw Pact
countries from a NATO invasion, but many Poles and Hungarians regard
it as little more than an occupation force to guarantee continued
communist rule. It was Soviet troops who put down Hungary's
anti-communist revolt in 1956 and led the Warsaw Pact forces who
toppled Czechoslovakia's reform government in 1968.
   In recent weeks, the Red Army started withdrawing 50,000 troops
from East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia in a pullback
that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced in December as
part of plans to cut the Soviet army by 500,000 troops by 1991.
   The announced cutbacks, which are to include 5,000 tanks, affect
about 10 percent of Soviet forces in Eastern Europe. Though welcomed
almost universally, the cuts have not quenched popular sentiment for
even more.
   The Soviet presence in Poland is not limited to the troops.
   One of three TV stations in Warsaw is relayed via satellite from
Moscow. Soviet television also can be seen in the Wroclaw-Legnica
area, where Soviet troops are concentrated. But the Soviet channel
is not widely watched because of the antipathy many Poles feel
toward the Soviet Union and the fact that many do not understand
Russian despite the school requirements.
   Soviet Lada cars are popular in Poland and are considered by many
residents to be superior to Polish-made Fiats and Polonezes. They
are mainly purchased with hard currency through state dollar shops
or private importing agencies.
   Soviet bookstores are in most major cities, and Pravda is widely
available.
   Towering over central Warsaw is the monolithic Palace of Culture
and Science, a much muttered-about gift from Josef Stalin's Soviet
Union. An oft-told joke in Poland says the best view of Warsaw is
from the top of the Palace of Culture because that is the only place
from which one can't see the Palace of Culture.
   Most Poles rarely see the estimated 40,000 Soviet troops among
them. The units remain secluded in tree- and fence-surrounded bases
away from towns. They are rarely mentioned in the press or state
broadcasts, except in the case of the occasional military accident
that has to be explained.
   Only in a few places like Legnica, the site of Soviet military
headquarters 260 miles southwest of Warsaw, is it common to see
young Russian or Asian soldiers on the street.
   Hungarians do not hide their dislike of the troops. A hotel
waiter in Esztergom near the Czechoslovak border, when asked by
Western diners about the helicopter noise outside, answered with
disdain and a deprecating gesture: ``The Soviets.'' Hungarian
officials have long insisted that their country be included in the
first phase of any withdrawal.
   In Poland, there is a long antagonism toward the Soviet Union.
   The countries warred in 1920, Soviet troops occupied eastern
Poland in 1939 two weeks after Nazis invaded from the west, and over
the next decade hundreds of thousands of Poles were deported to the
Soviet Union. Many thousands died, including 4,200 Polish officers
executed at Katyn.
   Only recently has it become possible for Poles to speak openly
about this painful past, after decades of propaganda proclaiming
unblemished friendship between the Polish and Soviet people.
   But whenever anti-Soviet feelings threaten to become too shrill,
leaders in Poland and Hungary hasten to point out that the
transformations under way in their countries depend on Gorbachev's
reforms at home.
   ``Political reforms under way in the Soviet Union are
indispenable international conditions for the success of endeavors
for democratic socialism,'' Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth
emphasized in a June interview.
   Hungarian officials have flirted publicly with the idea of a
``neutral Hungary'' someday, but only if both military blocs were
dissolved.
   In Poland, some opposition pragmatists state a need for a defense
alliance with the Soviet Union even if Poland becomes totally
democratic.
   Despite resentment of the Soviet military presence, Gorbachev and
his reform program are popular here. Leading figures in the
independent Solidarity movement have led the cheering for
perestroika and have come back from Moscow with enthusiastic
accounts of its progress.
   But many people still ask: Will it last?
   ``The American people think that Gorbachev can change a lot, but
we know the Soviet Union so much better,'' said one architecture
student in a Warsaw park, declining to give his name.

<DATELINE>PETAH TIKVA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan to keep Palestinian day
laborers in a fenced-in compound while they wait to be hired in
Petah Tikva has fueled debate over the wisdom and morality of using
Arabs to work in Israel.
   Critics of restrictions on Arab laborers say the practice is
similar to what Nazis did to Jews in Germany, but proponents
maintain that after 18 months of a violent Palestinian uprising in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, restrictions are necessary for safety
and security.
   Caught in the middle are the Arabs, who usually work as
construction laborers, street cleaners, garbage collectors and at
other menial jobs, and their employers, who pay them about half what
Israeli workers would have to be paid.
   In the West Bank settlement of Ariel, officials backed down from
a plan to make the Arabs wear tags labeling them ``alien workers''
after critics compared them to the yellow Stars of David that Jews
were forced to wear in Nazi Germany.
   When the town council in Petah Tikva, a city of 150,000 six miles
east of Tel Aviv, approved the holding area for Arab workers in May,
some Israeli newspapers said it amounted to a ``temporary prison.''
   The original plan called for a fenced-in holding pen where Arab
workers would be required to show their identity cards and wait to
be hired.
   But after the public outcry, the town decided to do away with
plans for the fence and a legal requirement that workers wait inside.
   Instead, a metal-frame shelter with a green plastic roof was
erected over three park benches; a portable toilet was put up
nearby. On one recent day, the shelter was empty and several Arab
workers waited at a corner about 100 yards away.
   ``People are afraid to go to the shelter,'' said one of the
workers, identifying himself as only as Faisal. ``They are afraid of
the police or of citizens here who might plant bombs or shoot guns
at us.''
   Avraham Oren, a Petah Tikva town council member who opposes the
shelter, said it would probably never be used because of the
controversy it has caused.
   ``This idea that it is possible to put people in pens is like
segregation of the races,'' he said.
   But council spokesman Shuki Yelin defended the shelter, saying it
was meant to ease fears by Jewish parents that their children might
be attacked by Arabs on the streets.
   ``We built it because ... many Jewish citizens protested and sent
petitions, saying they are suffering because of the presence of the
Arabs near their houses,'' Yelin said.
   ``It's not racist. We know we are criticized, but it's not a
jail. We don't force them to go. It's an open place.''
   Similarly expressed fears have been behind other moves to
restrict Arab workers.
   Mayor Zvi Zilker of the southern Israeli town of Ashdod
temporarily barred all Palestinian laborers recently after a soldier
was killed nearby and another disappeared and was believed
kidnapped. Police said they suspected Palestinians from the Gaza
Strip in both cases.
   After the attacks on soldiers, the Israeli government also began
requiring Gaza Arabs to obtain new work permits and restricting
those with records of crime or security offenses.
   But right-wing calls for barring all Arab workers from Israel
have brought an outcry from employers who depend on them.
   The issue has opened up a debate that touches not only Israel's
economy but also many Israelis' vision of their country as a bulwark
of Jewish morality that does not condone exploiting the Arabs.
   Professor Ehpraim Yuchtman-Yaar, a social psychologist at Tel
Aviv University, says Israelis are torn between dependence on Arab
workers and guilt over their treatment.
   ``People recognize the labor is vital for the Israeli economy,''
he said. ``They are doing low-status jobs that Israelis prefer not
to do. But morally, many Israelis feel the Arabs should be treated
equally to Jewish workers. ... Because they are not, it is
exploitation and should be denounced.''
   Moshe Semyonov, a Tel Aviv University sociologist, says the
segregation of Arabs is being fostered by a curious alliance between
right-wing Israelis and traditionalists who see the use of Arab
labor crushing their dream of an Israel built by Jews.
   ``People on both ends of the political spectrum are against
depending on Arabs _ one out of antagonism, the other for humanistic
or moral reasons,'' Semyonov said.

<HEAD>Program for Elderly Under Scrutiny</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A program which provides nursing homes and
other housing for the elderly is under scrutiny by federal
investigators, a senior Department of Housing and Urban Development
official said Monday.
   The department is reviewing an inspector general's audit of the
Retirement Service program and Secretary Jack Kemp could make
decisions about the program as early as next week, the official said.
   ``Nursing homes will probably be next,'' said the official,
citing Kemp actions to suspend or overhaul other department programs
in the wake of highly critical investigative audits by the inspector
general.
   The New York Times said in Tuesda editions the department is
considering proposals to overhaul or terminate the program which has
left the government liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in
mortgages on troubled housing projects for the elderly.
   The newspaper said half of the 24 projects in the Midwest that
were audited were in default or financial difficulty.
   ``I think it's premature what will be proposed,'' said the
official. ``That's Secretary Kemp's decision and he hasn't made it.''
   The official, who asked not to be identified, did not give an
estimate of possible government losses. However, ``anytime a
significant percentage of those projects are in default you begin to
wonder about the program,'' he said.
   Last week Kemp cancelled a mortgage insurance program after an
audit found 25 of 58 projects financed throught the program had
defaulted. The department estimated the outstanding debts would cost
the government $90 million.
   Other federal housing programs, including subsidies for
rehabilitation of housing for those with moderate incomes, a
coinsurance program and a program in which at least one private
escrow agent who handled sales of foreclosed property has admitted
stealing more than $5 million, are under investigation by Congress
and the Justice Department for mismanagement, political
influence-peddling and other abuse.

   A dovish Israeli legislator says he has started
to carry a pistol after being threatened by right-wing extremists
who oppose his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
   ``There are very specific threats, telephone calls, letters,
saying: `We shall kill you, we shall harm your family,''' Abraham
Burg of the Labor Party said in an interview on Monday.
   ``I live in a secluded place and I also travel a lot,'' Burg
said. ``Politically, I'm at the forefront of the struggle against
the radicals. That's why I'm carrying a pistol at all times.''
   The legislator would not reveal what type of pistol he carries or
when he purchased it.
   Burg, the son of a former interior and police minister, Yosef
Burg, belongs to the dovish wing of the center-left party and is
known as a supporter of a far-reaching territorial compromise as a
way of solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
   He said that threats from right-wing extremists seem to be linked
to his frequent radio and television interviews, and that ``they
follow immediately.''
   Some of the callers, he said, have identified themselves as
belonging to the Sicarites, an extremist underground group named
after biblical Jewish assassins who killed collaborators with Rome
in the first century.
   The group has claimed responsibility for the submachine-gun
attack in April that left one Palestinian dead and three wounded
near Jerusalem's Old City, and for at least eight arson attacks on
apartments and cars belonging to left-wing Israelis.
   The daily Davar reported Monday that parliament's security
officer had decided to equip other left-wing legislators with guns
after they, too, have been threatened by extremists.
   It said some liberal legislators already carry weapons.
   Parliament spokeswoman Sara Yitzhaki refused comment on the
report.
   Burg confirmed that left-wing lawmakers have been threatened but
said he was not aware whether any of his 119 colleagues in the
Israeli parliament, or Knesset, carried a weapon.

   Last week, Buddhist monks and the elders of the
Cambodian community came to bless a wobbly, two-story house. They
squatted on a mat in the living room and while incense burned, they
chanted.
   But the ``house'' was really an exhibit at the Boston Children's
Museum and a crowd was watching the opening of the last phase of
``From Time to Time: Celebrating 75 Years at Our House.''
   The exhibit, a realistic-looking two-story house built in a
high-ceilinged part of the museum, has during the past nine months
been the ``home'' to four families portrayed by actors representing
the city's shifting immigrant tides over the last seven decades.
   The latest to move in last week is a Cambodian family, the Soks,
played by Cambodian-American actors.
   Before the Soks, whose fictional biography has them as refugees
who arrived in America in 1981, there were actors portraying the
Robinsons, a black family who moved into the ``neighborhood'' during
the 1960s.
   Before that, other actors from the City Stage Company portrayed
the Gutermans, Jewish immigrants who lived in the house in the 1940s
and 1950s, and the Fitzgeralds, a boisterous Irish clan that first
inhabited the home in 1913.
   ``We're trying to make Irish families, Jewish families _ all the
different ethnicities _ familiar,'' said Dorothy Merrill, who helped
develop the project. ``We want to make the arena comfortable for the
kids so they can ask questions and better understand lives different
from their own.''
   Wander through the plywood home and you're drawn in. The same
Oriental hall rugs that the Fitzgeralds once trod now wind upstairs
toward two bedrooms where 10 of 11 Sok family members sleep and
share a single bathroom.
   In place of the Gutermans' Victrola is a VCR showing tapes of
festivals and dances that have been sent to area Cambodians from the
folks back home.
   ``It's a way for the kids in America to stay in touch with their
Cambodian culture,'' said museum spokeswoman Gail Eaton.
   It's also a way for natives of this country to get in touch with
unfamiliar cultures. The $120,000 exhibit, which its creators
believe is the first of its kind, has drawn thousands of kids into
the day-to-day experiences of generations past.
   The actors in each ``family'' have been provided with fictional
biographies, historical background and other information so they can
answer visitors' questions as if they really were the persons they
were portraying.
   ``I try to get the kids to respond, to learn about my culture,''
said Virak Ui, the 16-year-old Cambodian-born actor who's playing
the part of the Sok family's teen-age son, Thy Sok. His older sister
plays the mother.
   ``Visitors really get a look inside the lives,'' Merrill said.
``The Robinsons had problems with Boston's (segregated) schols and
Mrs. Guterman talks to people about how hard it is to keep kosher.
She thinks of herself as a modern woman and isn't real interested in
sending her kids to Hebrew school.''
   Kids seem to become more tolerant toward people different from
themselves after they've seen the cupboards stocked with foods
similar to those they eat and a bulletin board displaying family
photos not altogether unlike those on their own refrigerator at
home, Merrill said.
   Brian Viens, 13, said a Cambodian family lives down the block
from his family.
   ``My brother said he saw them once burning a flag,'' the
teen-ager said, sprawling in 8-year-old ``Rathsan Sok's'' upstairs
room. ``I don't know if it's true now. They have beds the same as
mine.''
   Some of the children weaving in and out among the simply
furnished rooms pause for a moment, ponder over the Buddhist shrine
or the slippers placed carefully in a pocketed bag by ``family
members'' who have left home for the day.
   Others just like the fun of it all.
   ``Yeah, this stuff is interesting, but the thing I really liked
was all the old baseball cards that other family had,'' 14-year-old
Mark Chace said, recalling his visit to the Gutermans' home three
months ago. ``They were great.''

<TEXT>
   Folks who can cluck like a chicken, America wants you. Men with
spindly legs, you're in demand, too. Ditto people with crayfish that
can scoot like Secretariat.
   No, such talents don't mean a future of Broadway lights, but
small town America has learned how to make fun from the oddest
festivals. And there's always time for a contest or exhibit at these
Woodstocks of weirdness.
   Consider the Chicken Show this weekend at Wayne, Neb.
   Organizers say they expect 5,000 to show up for the National
Cluck-Off, a parade with the theme of ``Science Fiction Chicken'' _
Frank-Hen-Stein is expected _ and a Beautiful Beak Contest.
   ``When the chicken was mentioned, everyone started laughing and
we haven't stopped since,'' said Gail Korn, one of the show's
organizers.
   Toadfish are honored with a zany festival at Sausalito, Calif.,
even though their droning mating calls drive houseboat-dwellers nuts.
   Crayfish also have their festivals. Organizers in Isleton,
Calif., where a crustacean race tops the schedule, call them
crawdads. In Shreveport-Bossier City, La., they're mudbugs.
   There are sweet corn fests, where folks chomp away on steaming
ears by the ton, and at least one horseradish fest, where
aficionados enjoy their favorite delicacy in smaller bites. Also
celebrated are prunes, possums, sauerkraut, spinach, raisins, and an
legendary alligator named Two-Toed Tom _ which fell in love with a
sawmill whistle at Esto, Fla.
   Some themes are played with a nudge and a wink _ the Heeney,
Colo., Tick Festival, pays ironic tribute to a disease-spreading
critter. Some do double duty _ Key West, Fla.'s Hemingway Days
combines seminars and an Ernest lookalike contest.
   Dana Pomerenke, chairman of the Great Texas Mosquito Festival in
Clute, Texas, gives a theme explanation that is typical of the
tongue-in-cheek festival faction.
   ``Someone said, `We've got a lot of mosquitoes around here, so
let's capitalize on it and do something crazy like start a mosquito
festival,''' said Pomerenke. The late-July event will include a
mosquito legs look-alike contest and a Ms. Quito beauty contest.
   Deceased stars and fictional icons of popular culture _ James
Dean, Star Trek _ are popular, particularly if the dear departed
happens to have been born in a small town. The typical metropolis
has given birth to too many stars to single out just one, but
Metropolis, Ill., adopted Superman, and holds a fest in honor of the
Man of Steel every year.
   It doesn't even matter if the stars didn't set foot in their
hometown after making it, or even, as in the case of Judy Garland
and Grand Rapids, Minn., if they are said to have lived out their
lives being glad they left.
   Any town that bills itself as the Something-or-other Capital of
the World is a festival candidate, of course.
   The Brick Capital of the World, Malvern, Ark., has a
brick-throwing contest at its fest, while at the Cereal Capital of
the World, Battle Creek, Mich., they unfurl yards of checkered
tablecloths and feed breakfast to thousands.
   In Heeney, Colo., population 45, the ``first annual tick
festival'' eight years ago was just a picnic to celebrate one
woman's recovery from Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, an illness borne
by ticks. This year, up to 3,000 people showed up June 10 to take in
the parade, the crowning of the Tick King and Tick Queen and other
events.
   ``It sounds like a weird idea for a festival, but it gives us
something to do,'' said D.J. Parlin, a 1989 Tick Queen nominee.
``It's always Heeney's biggest event of the year, and it's real
popular with visitors.''
   Given the agricultural roots of so many of the fests, it's no
surprise that cow-chip throwing is a festival staple. It's
permissible to put a plastic bag or glove over your hand before you
pick one up.
   ``Some people throw overhand and some throw them like a
Frisbee,'' said Sandy Franky of Chatham, Ill., where the Sweet Corn
Festival next month will feature a chip throw. ``Everyone has their
own style.''
   But not all festivals are just fun, fun, fun.
   The last weekend in June, Comfrey, Minn., held its annual
Hospital Days festival and fund-raiser for its eight-bed hospital,
said to be the smallest in Minnesota. They took in $11,000 before
expenses this year from burger sales and a dunk tank where you could
douse the mayor, local schoolteachers or ``people who wanted to cool
off,'' said hospital administrator John Holmes.
   ``This is very, very, very dear money to us,'' he said. ``We use
it to pay bills. It is very much needed.''

<HEAD>State-by-State Review of Abortion Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, are the current laws on abortion in each state
and political sentiment for passing new laws along the lines
permitted by the Supreme Court in ther Missouri case. States with
laws banning abortions are still unable to enforce them because of
the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ALABAMA: Pre-1973 law on the books bans abortions except to
preserve a woman's health. The penalty is a fine of up to $1,000 and
up to one year in jail.Alabama also requires teen-agers under 18 to
obtain approval from a parent or a judge before getting an abortion.
Gov. Guy Hunt is an abortion opponent; anti-abortion Rep. Greg
Beers, R-Birmingham, expects legislation based on the Supreme
Court's ruling Monday in the Missouri case.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ALASKA: Law requires parental permission for minors and requires
women to have lived in the state for at least 30 days. Violations
are punishable by a maximum $1,000 fine and five years in jail.
Assistant Attorney General Elizabeth Shaw said the law never has
been enforced in criminal proceedings. Gov. Steve Cowper says he
does not anticipate much change as a result of the Missouri decision.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ARIZONA: Pre-1973 laws ban abortions except to save a woman's
life. The penalty is one to five years in prison for the woman and
two to five years for whoever performs the abortion. Laws also bar
use of public money for abortions and prohibit experimentation on a
fetus. Lawmakers seem evenly divided on an abortion ban, and
legislative leaders predicted the Missouri case would produce drives
by both sides to alter abortion rules.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ARKANSAS: Law prohibits use of public funds on abortions except
to save a woman's life and requires minors to notify their parents
before having an abortion. A 1969 law provides penalties for anyone
other than a physician to induce abortion. An anti-abortion law is
likely since voters approved a constitutional amendment last
November to protect life from conception; anti-abortion Sen. Lu
Hardin, D-Russelville, says he will review the Missouri decision
before proposing new legislation.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CALIFORNIA: Imposes no restrictions on first- and
second-trimester abortions. A 1987 law requiring unmarried minors to
obtain parental or court permission was overturned in a state court
decision now on appeal. A pre-1973 law requiring hospital committee
approval for all abortions has been ruled invalid. The Legislature
has imposed restrictions on Medi-Cal abortion funds, but California
courts have struck down those restrictions. Prospects for
anti-abortion bills this year are slim.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   COLORADO: Bars Medicaid financing for abortions for poor women.
Colorado's abortion laws have been relatively liberal for years and
lawmakers say changes are unlikely even if they are given the
authority to outlaw abortion.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CONNECTICUT: A pre-1973 law banning abortion remains on the
books. The state permits the use of Medicaid funds on abortions for
poor women. Votes during the 1989 legislative session favored the
pro-choice position.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   DELAWARE: Pre-1973 laws banned abortions except to protect the
woman's health, in cases of rape or incest, or when the child would
be born with grave physical or mental deformity. Lawmakers expect a
bill based on the Missouri ruling to be proposed, but its prospects
are uncertain. Gov. Michael N. Castle is pro-choice.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   FLORIDA: Prohibits the advertising of abortion services and
experimentation with live fetuses. Married women must obtain the
consent of their husbands. Another law, enforcement of which has
been suspended pending a ruling on its constitutionality, requires
unmarried women under 18 to obtain the consent of a parent. State
law prohibits abortions in the last trimester except to preserve the
health of the mother. Provides no Medicaid funds except in cases in
which the woman's life is threatened. House Speaker Tom Gustafson
has said he would call for a special session to handle abortion
legislation so the issue does not overshadow the Legislature's
regular session. Prospects for new restrictions following the
Missouri decision are uncertain.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GEORGIA: Bars abortions after the second trimester unless
necessary to preserve the woman's health and prohibits Medicaid
financing of abortions except when a woman's life is in danger. The
courts have blocked laws requiring parental notification before a
minor could undergo an abortion; an appeal is pending. Georgia's
political leaders generally support abortions only in cases of rape,
incest or danger to the woman's health. Legislative leaders
predicted next year's General Assembly session will see new attempts
to further restrict abortions as a result of the Missouri case.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HAWAII: No Medicaid or parental consent restrictions. Hawaii
political leaders generally favor liberal abortion legislation,
though some restrictions based on the Missouri ruling are expected
to be proposed by abortion opponents.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   IDAHO: A 1973 law would ban abortions, under penalty of two to
five years in prison for those performing them and one to five years
for those receiving them. A law requires doctors to advise patients
on alternatives and the potential health effects of abortions.
Doctors are required to notify the parents of any girl under 18 who
seeks an abortion. No action was taken last session on proposals to
remove jail terms from the law and ease the ban to permit abortion
in cases of rape or incest. State Attorney General Jim Jones
predicts new restrictions based on the Missouri case.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ILLINOIS: Law on the books says abortion would again be illegal
if the Roe vs. Wade decision is overturned; legal experts question
its constitutionality. Various restrictive laws have been declared
unconstitutional. Gov. James R. Thompson says he is personally
troubled by abortion but has repeatedly vetoed restrictive abortion
measures on constitutional grounds. Abortion foes in the Legislature
said that as a result of the Missouri ruling, they likely would
tighten provisions in a pending bill that would further restrict
abortions.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   INDIANA: Requires minors to obtain parental consent for an
abortion. The law prohibits use of any public funds to pay for
abortion unless it is necessary to preserve the woman's life.
Anti-abortion lawmakers plan to seek laws applying new restrictions
as a result of the Missouri ruling but are unsure of success.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   IOWA: Prohibits use of public funds for abortions. Republican
Gov. Terry Branstad, an abortion opponent, says he wants to review
the Missouri case before considering legislation. House Speaker Don
Avenson, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, favors liberal
abortion laws and says he doubts the Legislature will pass any new
restrictions.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   KANSAS: Bans use of public funds for abortions, except to protect
a woman's life, to prevent a stillbirth, or to end a pregnancy
resulting from rape or incest. A 1969 abortion law requiring a
doctor's certification that a woman's health was in danger, that a
child would be born deformed or that rape or incest caused the
pregnancy, remains on the books. Legislators expect the issue to
come before the Legislature, but do not anticipate any major changes.

   KENTUCKY: Requires unmarried women under 18 to get parental
consent or a court order before having an abortion. A law prohibited
use of state funds or facilities for abortions but was nullified by
a court ruling that the state did not appeal. Gov. Wallace Wilkinson
opposes abortion, favors exceptions only in cases of rape or incest
or when a mother's life is in danger, and would support an
anti-abortion bill.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LOUISIANA: Pre-1973 law remains on books banning abortion, under
penalty of maximum 10-year prison sentence. Many subsequent
anti-abortion laws have been found unconstitutional. Current law
prohibits public financing for abortions and requires that parents
of minors be notified of abortion plans. If the high court reverses
itself on Roe vs. Wade, current law says all old laws go back into
effect. Some legislators doubt the laws' constitutionality. A bill
filed to declare abortion a public nuisance, thus allowing courts to
close abortion clinics, is still in committee, apparently dead for
the session. Attorney General William Guste said the Missouri
decision opens the way for Louisiana to further restrict abortions.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MAINE: A federal judge has declared invalid a law requiring
parental notification of a minor's intent to have an abortion,
requiring physician counseling and a 48-hour waiting period. The
Legislature has given tentative approval to a measure requiring
parental or judicial approval, or professional counseling, for any
girl 17 or younger. Gov. John R. McKernan says he would oppose any
effort to restrict abortion beyond the limits of Roe vs. Wade.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MARYLAND: Laws on books would make abortion illegal except in
cases in which the woman's life or mental health is threatened, if
the child would be born with grave physical or mental deformities,
or in cases of rape. Hospital authorities would have to approve any
abortions and abortions would be reported on ``fetal death
certificates.'' House Majority Leader John Arnick expects several
anti-abortion bills as a result of the Missouri case but predicts
none will pass.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MASSACHUSETTS: Has a pre-1973 law making abortion criminal.
Current law requires minors to obtain the consent of both parents or
a court order to get an abortion. The Legislature has voted
repeatedly to cut Medicaid financing for abortions, but funding
continues because of a state court order. The House is
anti-abortion; the Senate is pro-abortion rights by 21-19.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MICHIGAN: Voters last fall approved a measure banning state-paid
abortions for women under the Medicaid program, except to save a
woman's life. Sen. Jack Welborn, R-Kalamazoo, says he will introduce
legislation restricting abortion along the lines of the Missouri
decision. Gov. James Blanchard is pro-choice.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MINNESOTA: Requires unmarried minors to get a court order or both
parents' consent, and prohibits Medicaid funds for abortions. Key
lawmakers and activists on both sides of the issue say the
Legislature would pass the toughest anti-abortion legislation
possible under high court guidelines.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MISSISSIPPI: Still has a pre-1973 anti-abortion law on the books.
In 1986, a federal judge blocked enforcement of a state law that
required written consent from the parents of any woman under age 18
before an abortion could performed. Abortion opponents immediately
called on Gov. Ray Mabus to convene a special legislative session to
consider laws that would comply with the Missouri decision, but
Mabus said he wanted to study the ruling first.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MISSOURI: Missouri's law was the one before the Supreme Court. It
banned the use of public hospitals or public employees for abortion,
prohibited use of taxpayer money for abortion counseling, required a
doctor to test a fetus older than 19 weeks for viability and
declared that life begins at conception. Anti-abortion activists
expect further restrictions to be proposed in the state Legislature.
Republican Gov. John Ashcroft opposes abortion.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MONTANA: Requires, except in cases in which a woman's life is
threatened, that doctors tell a woman before an abortion about the
stage of fetus development, the physical and psychological effects
of abortion and available alternatives. Lawmakers expect efforts to
restrict abortion following the Missouri ruling and give it a 50-50
chance of succeeding.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NEBRASKA: Requires that all abortions be recorded and reported to
the Department of Health. A parental notification law on the books
has been unenforced since a similar statute was declared
unconstitutional. Effort to pass a more restrictive law is likely if
authorized by the court, but the Legislature declined to pass a more
restrictive parental notification bill in 1988. Gov. Kay Orr favors
a constitutional amendment to ban abortion.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NEVADA:
   A 1985 law requires a doctor to notify the parents of a minor who
requests an abortion before the procedure can take place. Nevada
bans public financing of abortions except in cases in which a
woman's life is threatened. The Legislature is bitterly divided on
abortion, and Gov. Bob Miller has indicated he is pro-choice. During
the legislative session that ended Saturday, lawmakers on both sides
of the issue agreed not to take up abortion questions to avoid
extending the session. Lawmakers do not meet again until 1991.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NEW HAMPSHIRE: Still has three pre-1973 statutes making it a
crime to induce an abortion. If the woman dies, doctors could face
life in prison if malice is proved. A second law sets a maximum
one-year jail sentence and $1,000 fine for inducing an abortion. The
third law bars inducing abortions in cases involving a fetus whose
movement can be felt unless the woman's life is endangered. The
Legislature this year voted to repeal the three laws, but Gov. Judd
Gregg vetoed the bill.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NEW JERSEY: A law limiting Medicaid financing for abortion was
struck down by the state Supreme Court. New Jersey is considered a
pro-choice state, and a recent survey indicated 80 percent of its
residents believe a woman has a right to choose whether to have an
abortion. Following the Missouri decision, abortion opponents said
they would push harder for restrictive bills pending in the
Legislature.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NEW MEXICO: Provides no public funds for abortions for poor women
except in cases in which a woman's life is in danger. Pro-choice
groups say they have stopped 17 anti-abortion bills in the
Legislature since 1973 and are optimistic they can block any future
efforts.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NEW YORK: Provides Medicaid money for abortions for poor women.
Abortion advocates believe New York would retain liberal abortion
legislation. But Republican Sen. James Donovan, an abortion foe,
says he will introduce a law to restrict abortion based on the
Missouri ruling.
</TEXT>

   NORTH DAKOTA: Laws require parental consent before unmarried
minors can receive abortions and bar state funding except when the

plans legislation in the 1991 session based on the Missouri decision.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   OHIO: Probibits the use of public funds for abortions unless the
abortion is necessary to protect a woman's physical or mental
health. Ohio's parental consent law was declared unconstitutional
and is awaiting review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Most polls
indicate a majority of legislators favor some restrictions on
abortions.
</TEXT>

   OKLAHOMA: Still has a pre-1973 law on the books prohibiting
abortions. Lawmakers favor further restrictions on abortion.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   OREGON: Considered a pro-choice state, has no laws on the books
restricting availability or public funding of abortions. Legislative
leaders say changes in the law are unlikely, but abortion opponents
predicted after the Missouri ruling that abortion will be a major
and contentious issue in the 1991 Legislature.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PENNSYLVANIA: Public funds are available only in cases of rape or
incest. Last year the Legislature approved a provision that would
require parental consent for a woman under 18 to have an abortion,
but that has been blocked by a court challenge. Gov. Robert P. Casey
has said he backs whatever restrictions on abortion the court will
allow; Republican anti-abortion Rep. Stephen Freind predicts
legislation based on the Missouri ruling.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   RHODE ISLAND: Requires doctor to receive a woman's written
consent before abortion. Courts have struck down provisions
requiring a waiting period, fetal description and criminal
sanctions. Minors must get parental consent or a court order before
undergoing an abortion. A 1975 law making it manslaughter to perform
an abortion on a fetus that is viable remains on the books but is
not enforced. A legislative fight over applying the restrictions of
the Missouri ruling is likely, but prospects are uncertain.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOUTH CAROLINA: Law requires unmarried minors under age 16 to get
parental consent. A third-trimester abortion requires the consent of
the woman, her husband, the attending physician and an independent
second physician. The legislative outlook for any cange is uncertain.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOUTH DAKOTA: A pre-1973 anti-abortion law remains on the books
but was tailored to allow the practice under federal guidelines
after Roe vs. Wade. A 1977 state law would forbid abortions if
allowed by federal law, imposing penalties of up to two years in
prison and a $2,000 fine. Gov. George Mickelson said the Missouri
decision could become an issue in the 1990 Legislature.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   TENNESSEE: Has a parental consent law requiring approval of a
court or both parents before a minor can get an abortion. She can
seek court permission if the parents refuse. Lawmakers favor some
restrictions; Gov. Ned McWherter opposes abortion. Abortion foes say
they will push abortion legislation in line with the Missouri
decision.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   TEXAS: Prohibits abortions after the point of viability of the
fetus, except in cases in which the woman's physical or mental
health would be in jeopardy or in cases of severe fetal abnormality.
The legislative outlook for change is uncertain.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   UTAH: Law requires that women be counseled on fetal development
and the possibility of adoption. The law also requires consent of
parents for minors and husbands for married women. Utah restricts
Medicaid funds for abortions unless a woman's life is threatened.
Legislators are overwhelmingly opposed to abortion. Gov. Norm
Bangerter agrees, except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the
mother's health. Legislation limiting abortion under the Missouri
ruling is expected.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   VERMONT: Has no laws restricting abortions. Gov. Madeleine Kunin

   VIRGINIA: No restrictions on abortions. Legislative efforts to
require parental notification have been defeated. Lawmakers predict
no changes in Virginia's abortion laws as a result of the Missouri

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON: A pre-1973 law permits abortions through the 16th
week of pregnancy, requires spousal consent if the two are living
together and requires women to have lived in the state 90 days in
order to get an abortion. The state provides money for poor women to
get abortions. Prospects for tougher laws are uncertain _ voters
defeated a 1984 initiative to ban state money for abortion and a
similar 1986 proposal lacked enough signatures to get on the ballot.
Gov. Booth Gardner is pro-choice.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WEST VIRGINIA: Law on the books makes all abortions felonies
except those performed in the case of medical emergencies. An
unmarried minor must notify her parents before having an abortion.
The Legislature is sharply divided on the issue of abortion and has
killed bills to halt state financing of abortions. Legislation based
on Supreme Court ruling is likely to be proposed.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WISCONSIN: Pre-1973 law still on the books prohibits abortions
except to save a woman's life. A 1985 law makes it a felony to abort
a viable fetus. Wisconsin prohibits public financing of abortions
unless a woman's life is threatened. The legislative outlook for
further restrictions is uncertain.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WYOMING: Requires minors to get parental consent or court
approval before getting abortions. An abortion performed after the
fetus is viable is unlawful except in cases in which a woman's life
is threatened. While Wyoming is traditionally a conservative state,
the Legislature appears split on the issue. Some lawmakers do expect
new restrictions based on the Missouri ruling.

   Parliament has given Charles Haughey three
days to form a new government. If he fails, political observers say
another general election seems certain.
   Haughey's Fianna Fail party failed by six seats to gain a
majority in the June 15 election. His minority government, elected
28 months ago, called the sudden election hoping to gain a majority
in the 166-seat Dail, or parliament.
   Haughey told the Dail on Monday that a new election was a
``Doomsday solution'' and asked for extra time to gather enough
backing for a fifth term as prime minister.
   Fianna Fail has governed Ireland for 44 of its 67 years as an
independent state but has not formed a single-party majority
government since 1977-81.

fire June 6 on a foreigners' housing complex, and said it was filing
a protest.
   The move was likely to worsen relations between the two
countries, already made tense by U.S. criticism of China's military
crackdown on the student-led pro-democracy movement.
   The shooting, in which hundreds of rounds of bullets were fired
into the Jianguomenwai apartment compound, came a day after the
State Department announced the embassy had given refuge to two
Chinese dissidents, Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian.
   A U.S. Embassy report on the shooting, which charged
pre-meditation, did not link it with China's anger over U.S.
protection of Fang and Li.
   The United States filed one protest shortly after the shooting.
The new protest, in the form of a diplomatic note, challenges for
the first time the Chinese account that the soldiers were responding
to sniper fire from within the apartment compound.
   Radio Beijing said at the time that one soldier was killed and
three injured, and plainclothes officers who went into the compound
brought out a Chinese man they claimed was the sniper.
   No witnesses reported seeing Chinese soldiers hit.
   The U.S. Embassy report said the arrest appeared to be staged. It
also said the soldiers fired not only from the ground but from a
building across the street, where they had taken up positions the
day before.
   A diplomat from another Western country confirmed that some
bullets were fired from the opposite building and whizzed over the
heads of children who were playing on the floor in the foreigners'
apartments. He said the shooting appeared intended to intimidate
foreigners.
   No one was hurt, but most foreigners evacuated the compound later
that day.
   ``There is no doubt, in this embassy's opinion, that certain
apartments were deliberately targeted by the (army),'' the U.S.
Embassy report said.
   It said one U.S. defense attache's apartment was hit by 18
bullets. Ten other U.S. diplomats' apartments also were hit.
   Chinese guards stationed outside the U.S. Embassy, who normally
carry only revolvers, were armed Monday with long-barreled automatic
pistols and wore military helmets for the third straight day.
   The guards appeared in the new gear Saturday, when the embassy
held an Independence Day party for American residents in Beijing.
   One guard said they would maintain their tighter security through
Tuesday, which is America's Independence Day, but refused to explain
why.'
   On Sunday, the first tourists were allowed to enter central
Beijing's Tiananmen Square since the army seized it June 3-4 and
drove out pro-democracy protesters, killing hundreds of unarmed
civilians.
   A bus was driven onto the square early Sunday and about a dozen
foreigners climbed out. Authorities said groups with advance army
permission would be allowed to visit the vast square, but it
remained closed to the general public.
   The assault on Tiananmen began the crackdown on the student-led
movement for a freer society. Authorities have since arrested more
than 1,800 people and announced 27 executions.
   One student said Sunday that he and many others still were
stunned by the violence. The government says up to 300 people died
in the crackdown. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources
say up to 3,000 were killed.
   The student, who did not want his name used, gazed at the square
from behind a gate and said that despite their horror at the
crackdown, many of his peers still want to join ruling Communist
Party to further their careers and were quietly accepting the
government line that troops were needed to quell the protests.
   Party membership ``means the person was good in school, is in
good health, has the right thoughts and is likely to move ahead in
the world,'' the student said.
   But the highly publicized party pledges to clean up its act
indicated the party is aware of deep popular discontent.
   Television news reported that three party members from a Beijing
suburb were sentenced to prison terms of one to 10 years for
accepting bribes in their capacity as factory managers. A Shanghai
legislator was sentenced to eight years for taking bribes, according
to the report.
   It did not say if they were expelled from the party.
   Widespread corruption has destroyed public trust in leaders, and
the students gained broad popular support for demanding an end to
corruption during the seven weeks of protests.
   Over the past few years, the party announced several
anti-corruption campaigns followed by arrests. But no top-level
leaders were prosecuted, and many Chinese said the campaigns only
highlighted the extent of corruption.

<HEAD>Study Finds Less Trauma With Full Moon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The old folk tale that the blood rises during a
full moon, inducing violent crime, shouldn't scare anyone, according
to a group of researchers.
   In fact, fewer people are hospitalized when there is a full moon
and those who are admitted fare slightly better than those admitted
at other times of the month, according to a report by two doctors
and a statistician at Allegheny General Hospital.
   ``This theory of the lunar cycle impacting the type and number of
patients with traumatic injuries that an emergency room gets when
the moon is full has been part of medical folklore almost forever.
So we decided to take a look at it,'' said Dr. Dietrich Jehle,
director of emergency medicine research at Allegheny General.
   The study was published Saturday in the Annals of Emergency
Medicine.
   Jehle, Dr. Wendy Coates and statistician Eric Cottington reviewed
the type and extent of injuries for 1,444 trauma patients admitted
to the hospital during a 12-month period. They also noted the
patients' outcomes.
   The team identified 129 patients who were hospitalized on the day
of the full moon, the day before or the day after.
   The researchers compared that group's medical problems and
outcomes to 1,315 trauma patients admitted on the 330 days of the
year when there wasn't a full moon.
   During the full moon, the average number of patients admitted was
3.58 per day, compared with 3.98 per day the rest of the month.
   Those injured when the moon was fullest stayed in the hospital
for an average 10 days, compared with a 12-day stay for those who
came in the rest of the month.
   The study found 5.4 percent of those injured during the full moon
died, compared with 10.3 percent of those hurt during the moon's
dark phase.
   And Allegheny General's helicopter flew fewer patients when the
moon was brightest, according to the study.
   Jehle and his colleagues said they could not fully explain their
findings.
   But, they wrote, ``a brighter night sky might deter criminal acts
and better illuminate roadways.''

   Covered wagons rolled into town as modern-day
pioneers, dusty and tired but grinning, retraced their ancestors'
journey across the prairie to mark North Dakota's 100 years of
statehood.
   ``Now, a one-hour horseback ride isn't going to seem like
anything,'' said Myrtle Worth, a teacher from Healy, Alaska.
   She joined the Red River Centennial Wagon Train on horseback 15
days and 300 miles ago, when it was assembled at her brother's farm
in Abercrombie, near the North Dakota-Minnesota line.
   The Red River group, with about 30 wagons and 150 riders, ended
its trek by meeting Sunday with three smaller wagon trains in
Bismarck and neighboring Mandan for the state's four-day ``Party of
the Century.''
   Organizers expected up to 100,000 people would come to Bismarck
and Mandan, which together are home to about 65,000 people, for the
event that ends Tuesday.
   Worth, 54, got more than a history lesson during her adventure.
   ``The mornings were cool and very nice, but by the afternoon,
everybody was tired,'' she said. ``When you have to spend 10 to 12
hours a day on anything, you get tired.''
   The wagon train had its mishaps _ riders thrown from nervous
horses, runaway wagons, and a team of mules that refused to budge. A
few riders were injured _ broken arms or legs and a concussion _ and
many were exhausted.
   ``Once we had to ride through a heavy thunderstorm,'' Worth
recalled. ``We ended up in a pasture, waiting, while it rained about
1{ inches in 20 minutes. It was so ridiculous, we all started
laughing.''
   Meals were eaten in fields and campgrounds, and sponge baths
replaced showers. But the wagon train was welcomed in each town it
passed.
   The riders saw the freshness of the prairie in the morning, and
grazing cattle, sheep and horses lined up to give them a pasture
audience. They learned to depend on each other _ as did their
ancestors.
   ``One of the wagons had a man who played an accordian,'' Worth
said, ``and we had one group from Bismarck that came and sang. We
went to dances, but most of the time we were too tired, so we just
sat around and told stories.''
   Idaho also begins its centennial year this week, and the
year-long observance of 100 years of statehood starts with a long
list of July events.
   Gov. Cecil D. Andrus has proclaimed today Idaho Statehood Day,
urging residents to fly the flag and take part in observances.

   American pianist Van Cliburn drew bravos and even
screams when he repeated the spectacular performance of
Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1, which launched his career three
decades ago.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, joined in the
standing ovation Sunday night in Tchaikovsky Hall and later
expressed their enjoyment privately in a 35-minute meeting backstage
with Cliburn.
   Before playing, Cliburn told the 1,500 people packed into the
hall, ``For 31 years, I have felt like I had two homes. I will soon
be asking permission from your distinguished President Gorbachev to
buy an apartment in Moscow. I will be coming for much-needed visits
for my music, for my soul, to Russia and to Moscow.''
   Cliburn, 54, of Fort Worth, Texas, said the Soviet leader told
him he would help arrange the apartment.
   Sunday was Cliburn's third public performance in 11 years. He
came out of retirement to play for the Gorbachevs at the White House
in 1987. He was to play tonight at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory, on
the same stage where he won the Tchaikovsky Competition for young
pianists in 1958.
   In addition to the Tchaikovsky, Cliburn performed Liszt's Piano
Concerto No. 1, a Debussy prelude and the Schumann-Liszt Widmung.
   ``He played like a god,'' said Dallas Morning News critic John
Ardoin, who flew to Moscow to review the performance. ``I don't see
how anyone under this pressure and much emotion could play like he
did.''

   Don't fret if you didn't get an invitation to
the weekend wedding of Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner and Kimberley
Conrad. Taped highlights will be shown this month on the cable
Playboy Channel.
   Hefner, 63, and Miss Conrad, 26, 1988's Playmate of the Year,
exchanged vows during an outdoor ceremony Saturday at the Playboy
mansion.
   The 30-minute, non-denominational ceremony took place in front of
the wishing well where Hefner proposed to Miss Conrad.About 200
guests, including actors Bill Cosby and Tony Curtis, were on hand
when Hefner tied the knot.
   Hefner's brother, Keith, was the best man. Miss Conrad's sister,
Resa Miller, served as matron of honor and her father, Robert,
escorted her down a long, white carpet.
   The guests included former playmate Shannon Tweed and her rock
star husband, Gene Simmons, and actors Dick Van Patten, Robert Culp
and Don Adams.
   The newlyweds planned to honeymoon at the mansion. When asked how
long, Ms. Turner said ``probably a lifetime.''
   Hefner passed on holding the traditional bachelor party before
the wedding, and Playboy spokesman Bill Farley quoted him as saying:
``Bachelor party? I've had a bachelor party for 30 years, why do I
need one now?''
   The news media were not invited to the event. A half-hour of
taped highlights of the wedding will be shown on the cable Playboy
Channel's pay-per-view service July 15.
   Hefner was married once before, for 10 years to Millie Williams,
and they had two children _ Christie, 36, and David, 34.

   Broadway producer Harold Prince, who unveils his
production of Mozart's ``Don Giovanni'' this week, once preferred
operas to Broadway musicals.
   Prince, 61, said he's been going to the Metropolitan Opera since
about 1936.
   ``My grandmother had box seats every other Tuesday,'' he said in
an interview published Sunday in The New York Times. ``The first
thing I ever saw was `Rigoletto,' and the abduction scene was done
on casters. Even at the age of 6 or 7 I think I sensed that
something was wrong there. But as far as opera itself was concerned,
I was enthralled.''
   He also listened to the opera on Saturday afternoon radio
broadcasts, setting up a stage with his tin soldiers as described by
the announcer.
   ``Then while the opera played I would move the soldiers and
nurses around _ the women were always nurses, that's all they made _
and act out the story,'' he said.
   He kept up his attendance through the war years. ``I like opera a
lot. I didn't like Broadway muscials. Some pople might say `it
shows.' ''
   Prince directed his first opera in 1976. His production of ``Don
Giovanni'' opens the New York City Opera on Thursday night. He's
scheduled to make his Met debut next years.
   Prince won Tony awards in 1988 for his direction of the New
York-production of ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' and ``The Pajama
Game'' in 1954, which he co-produced.

   People troubled by society's problems should stop
complaining and start cooperating with those trying to overcome the
woes, first lady Barbara Bush says.
   ``Today you can no longer say, `The drug problem worries me' or
`Crime worries me' or `Illiteracy worries me.' If it worries you,
then you've got to do something about it,'' Mrs. Bush said in this
week's Newsweek.
   Americans must engage in volunteer work if the country is to
solve the problems troubling it, Mrs. Bush said. The rewards for
such work are immediately gratifying, she added.
   ``You see yourself feeding the hungry, nurturing the poor,'' she
said.
   The first lady suggested one other thing for improving the
nation's quality of life: education.
   ``The truth is that having a more literate America will help
almost everything,'' said Mrs. Bush.

   A small plane crashed into two mobile
homes and exploded in flames shortly after takeoff from this resort
town Sunday. All four people aboard were burned, one fatally.
   No one was in the trailers, Colfax County sheriff's dispatcher
Pat Osterman said.
   The plane failed to gain altitude after takeoff from Angel Fire
Airport at 3:30 p.m., Mrs. Osterman said. Eyewitnesses reported the
plane was 35 to 40 feet off the ground as it passed over the golf
course.
   ``It went into the trees, hit two mobile homes and was engulfed
in flames,'' Mrs. Osterman said. ``The aircraft and mobile homes
were destroyed.''
   She said all four people were able to get out of the plane, but
one woman fell into some burning fuel and was killed.
   The dead woman's identity was not immediately known, she said.
   The pilot, Paul Fitch, 45, of Phoenix suffered third-degree burns
over 65 percent of his body and was in critical condition at
University of New Mexico Hospital burn center in Albuquerque, said
emergency room nurse Lisa Paddock.
   The other passengers, Fitch's wife, Cathy, and John Burrow, 24,
of Tolleson, Ariz., had similar burns over 40 percent of their
bodies, Mrs. Osterman said. Their conditions were not immediately
known.
   The ski resort of Angel Fire is 20 miles east of Taos and 40
miles south of the Colorado state line.

   Lawmakers across the nation are pledging allegiance to a
constitutional amendment to bar desecration of the flag, and scores
of legislative leaders predict easy ratification of the initiative
in their states.
   ``It would blow through our House and Senate like a thunderstorm
through Kansas,'' said Republican Paul Burke, president of the
Kansas Senate. ``I doubt anybody would be opposed.''
   Less than two weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court said burning the
American flag is a legal form of political expression, full
legislatures in five states have passed resolutions supporting a
constitutional amendment against flag-burning.
   Legislative bodies in at least 10 other states have approved
resolutions criticizing the ruling or calling for an amendment to
reverse it. And dozens of legislative leaders elsewhere said such
sentiment ran strong in their states.
   ``As majority leader, I'll tell you this: If there are two or
three votes against it I would be honestly surprised,'' said
Republican Rep. Craig Moody of Utah. The legislature there, as in
many other states, is in summer recess.
   President Bush on Friday proposed a 20-word constitutional
amendment that would give states the right to prohibit desecration
of the flag. It requires approval by two-thirds of the House and
Senate and ratification by 38 states.
   In Alaska, ``it would pass within 30 days,'' declared Senate
President Tim Kelly. ``You're going to have a few liberals whining
in the House, but they'll be overwhelmed by the majority of
legislators and public opinion.''
   The last constitutional amendment to gain the required 38 states
was the one allowing 18-year-olds to vote, in 1971. The Equal Rights
Amendment died in 1982 after it got support from just 35 states
within the time limit prescribed by Congress.
   All states but Alaska and Wyoming have laws banning flag-burning,
and lawmakers there have said their lack of such a law was an
oversight. The Supreme Court ruling nullified state flag-protection
laws.
   Most legislative leaders contacted by The Associated Press last
week supported an amendment to overturn the court's ruling. Others
were troubled by the idea.
   ``I am not a bleeding heart,'' said Democratic state Sen. Denny
Jacobs of Illinois. ``But I don't support meddling with the
Constitution.''
   ``I don't believe you honor the flag by dishonoring the basic
rights contained in the Constitution and Bill of Rights,'' said
Democratic House Speaker Joe King of Washington state. ``Our current
Constitution has worked well in protecting everything the flag
stands for.''
   Nontheless, support for a flag-protection amendment spanned party
lines and many ideological viewpoints. In California, even
Democratic Assemblyman Tom Hayden, a prominent anti-war protester in
the 1960s, voted in favor of a resolution urging Congress to approve
the measure.
   Calling it ``a close call as an issue,'' Hayden said he believed
flag-burning incites violence. Another California assemblyman,
Republican Tim Leslie, framed the issue another way: ``What kind of
message are we sending to our children when we say it's OK to burn
the flag?''
   Legislatures in Colorado, Louisiana, Maine and South Carolina
have approved resolutions calling on Congress to pass a
flag-protection amendment. The California Assembly also passed such
a resolution, but it has not gone to a vote in the Senate. The Ohio
House passed a resolution calling for an amendment, while the Ohio
Senate simply condemned the ruling.
   The house or senate in at least 10 other states and a Kentucky
legislative committee have passed resolutions critical of the
ruling, and sizable groups of lawmakers in Alabama and Arkansas
criticized it without any formal vote. The 10 states are Texas,
Illinois, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
Delaware, New York, Nevada and North Carolina.
   In Texas, the House approved a resolution urging a constitutional
amendment just two days after the high court ruled. But action was
delayed in the Texas Senate by Democrat Craig Washington, who urged
colleagues to focus their attention on the values the flag
represents, not the flag itself.
   ``The flag is nothing but a piece of cloth,'' he said.
   New Mexico Rep. Blake Curtis, a Republican, saw it differently.
``It's a little more than just cloth,'' he said. ``It's a symbol of
freedom.''

   The Supreme Court is concluding its 1988-89
term today by issuing its latest word on abortion rights.
   The word could come in a momentous ruling or a brief announcement
that the justices need more time to ponder the fate of legal
abortions.
   The Missouri case, in which the justices were asked to reverse
the court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion, was the court's most
closely watched controversy of the decade.
   Decisions also were pending today in two other cases, including
an important church-state dispute from Pittsburgh and a tax-refund
case from Arkansas and Florida.
   In each case, the justices had to announce a decision or hold it
over their three-month summer recess. If they chose the latter, a
new round of arguments would be held in the court term that begins
in October, with announcement of a decision likely in 1990.
   Abortion-rights advocates feared the court would order the
Missouri case, called Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services,
reargued next term and simultaneously grant review to up to three
other abortion disputes pending before the justices.
   That likely would be read as a signal that the justices are
contemplating a major retreat from the 1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade,
which said women have a constitutional right to abortion.
   The court has yet to take action in the other three abortion
cases, which involve state regulations making it harder to get an
abortion in Illinois, Ohio and Minnesota.
   Roe vs. Wade itself was argued twice before a decision was
announced. The court hears arguments in about 150 cases each term,
and since 1977 has held over at least one case each year for
reargument the following term.
   The 1973 ruling said a woman's decision to have an abortion
during the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and
her doctor. It said states may regulate abortions during the second
trimester only to protect the woman's health, and may take steps to
protect fetal life in the third trimester.
   State authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester
was not made absolute, however.
   In the past decade, about 1.5 million legal abortions have been
performed each year. Opponents of Roe vs. Wade wanted to make states
free to stringently regulate _ or even outlaw _ abortion.
   Anti-abortion and pro-choice forces had said they did not
consider it likely that the court would use the Missouri case to
reaffirm Roe vs. Wade.
   Both sides had believed there could be five votes among the
court's nine members willing to give states more leeway in
regulating abortion.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Byron R. White,
dissenters from the 1973 ruling, opposed it in each subsequent case.
Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy were considered
willing to reverse or significantly curtail the ruling as well.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the only woman on the high court,
was seen as possibly providing the key fifth vote.
   In two previous abortion rulings, she has criticized the
trimester-by-trimester approach adopted in 1973, and voiced a
willingness to give states more regulatory power.

   Around and around the cow will go, and where
the chips fall, money will grow.
   A civic group has come up with a pungent plan to raise money for
its fireworks display and to help a group of deaf students visit
Washington, D.C.
   Participants in the fund-raiser will pay $5 for a numbered square
on a basketball court, then a well-fed steer will make its rounds.
The ticket-holder of the square where the steer drops its chips wins
$1,000.
   ``This steer is supposed to go quite a bit, so it shouldn't take
that long,'' said Jan MacCannell, chairwoman of the Moore Jaycees.
   Should the steer leave its mark on more than one square, the
prize will be divided among the winners.
   Ms. MacCannell said an official of Western Enterprises Inc.,
which supplies fireworks for the Jaycees' display, suggested Cow
Chip Bingo after hearing about a similar game in New Mexico.

   City leaders liked their first
centennial celebration so much they decided to hold another, 35
years later.
   In 1954, Stephenville marked the 100th anniversary of the days
when developer John M. Stephen and Texas revolutionary George Erath
were parceling up the land to form the town 60 miles southwest of
Fort Worth.
   This year, they're celebrating the 100th anniversary of
Stephenville's incorporation, which transformed it from town to city.
   ``We don't call this the centennial,'' said Billy Mobley, head of
the chamber of commerce. ``Some people weren't happy we were having
another 100-year celebration, because they were instrumental in
organizing the first one.''
   About 12,000 people are expected to attend the annual parade and
Fourth of July Fun Fair, which opens the festivities. A summerlong
series of events ends Sept. 12 with a fish fry.
   Stephen and Erath arrived at the green, rolling hills near Bosque
Creek in the mid-1850s and began dividing Stephenville into lots,
said Clinton Cox, who helped organize the 1954 centennial. There is
little record of what went on from 1854 to 1889.
   Stephenville, now a city of 15,500, was incorporated on Aug. 6,
1889. The first City Council meeting was Sept. 13.
   Bob Self, a City Council member who proposed this year's festival
and is co-chairman of the organizing committee, said he thought it
made more sense to celebrate the city's 100th anniversary this
summer than in 1954.
   ``When we celebrate July 4th, we're not celebrating the Pilgrims'

<TEXT>
   This Indian town in the mountains of
western Mexico has one working public telephone, four polling places
and two mayors.
   One chief executive represents the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, which has run Mexico for 60 years. The other
represents the deep gulf between the PRI and much of the state of
Michoacan.
   Together, the two men show why Sunday's state assembly election
is seen as a key test for the PRI, whose authority has seriously
eroded.
   People in this town of 30,000, 175 miles west of Mexico City,
take their franchise seriously and believe it has been long been
systematically violated by the PRI.
   Emboldened by the opposition sweep of Michoacan in national
elections last year, they occupied city hall in December, demanding
that then-Mayor Octavio Rios be replaced.
   Most Cheran residents are Purepeche Indians, but Rios is not a
Purepeche and is not from Cheran and many said he had been imposed
from outside.
   In February, they held a town assembly and chose Dr. Alberto
Munoz, a Purepeche local, as their mayor.
   The quiet rebellion got the attention of the PRI-dominated state
government. Within weeks, the state assembly named a new mayor, also
a Purepeche from Cheran.
   ``That made people even madder,'' said poll watcher Jose
Velazquez, as a cluster of women in the region's distinctive black
and indigo shawls lined up at a ballot box Sunday under a steady
drizzle.
   The new PRI mayor, Manuel Santa Clara, came out to vote Sunday as
well. Volunteer poll watchers said it was a rare public appearance
for a man the citizens refuse to acknowledge.
   ``I don't go sometimes,'' Santa Clara admitted in an interview at
his home, where a rickety table on the patio serves as his office.
``It's not because I'm afraid. It's because I don't want to provoke
people.''
   Santa Clara said Munoz's government is collecting proper state
and federal taxes and sending them to the state capital in Morelia.
Constituents say the Munoz-run public services have been operating.
   Munoz, assisted by the town's tradition of communal labor, has
even launched some small water projects with funds donated by
constituents.
   But Santa Clara said he has custody of the mayoral stationery,
the city treasury and budget and the official rubber stamps and
seals. He dismisses Munoz's role.
   ``All he has is city hall. And city hall is just a building,''
Santa Clara said.
   For many Michoacanos, city hall has became an important symbol of
their discontent and their support for the opposition Democratic
Revolutionary Party.
   In December, 50 of the state's 113 city halls were occupied.
Several are still padlocked and at least three other towns have
parallel governments like that of Cheran.
   Munoz was out of town Sunday, but fellow citizens were eager to
talk about Cheran's exercise in improvised democracy.
   Santa Clara ``has the money, the backing of the government, but
he doesn't have the support of the people,'' said Velazquez.
   The PRI admits the 1988 elections showed the government it has
run for three generations had alientated the people of Michoacan,
where leftist candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas soundly beat the PRI's
Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   A massive public works program was launched and for the first
time local party congresses were held to nominate candidates for the
state assembly race.
   ``They have ignored us for years,'' one of Velazquez' fellow poll
watchers said. His weathered face creased into a smile. ``Now,
suddenly we're important.''
   ``They want to recoup the government,'' Velazquez. ``But the
people don't want the PRI.''
   The new PRI mayor brought in a shipment of pipe for a water
project to be built with communal labor, but Cheran's people scorned
it. Huge piles of pipe lie under the arches at city hall.
   Michoacan holds mayoral elections in December. The people of
Cheran will have another chance to go to the polls.

<HEAD>HUD Funds Generally Available to Well-Connected During Reagan Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several months after floods devastated West
Virginia in November 1985 and left thousands homeless, the state's
senators pleaded with the Department of Housing and Urban
Development for federal housing money. The answer was no.
   At the same time, Nevada Sen. Paul Laxalt, President Reagan's
close friend, sought funds to upgrade aging apartments in Reno. The
answer was yes.
   The contrast is instructive of the way HUD was run during the
Reagan administration. If you were well-connected to the president
or had friends in high administration posts, HUD funds were
generally available. But not even the Senate Democratic leader,
Robert Byrd, could shake loose money to help homeless flood victims
in his home state of West Virginia.
   ``The November flood devastation greatly exacerbated'' the
already-existing need for housing help, Byrd wrote.
   West Virginia's junior senator, Democrat Jay Rockefeller,
reminded HUD of its responsibilities to no avail. ``As you know, all
funds and units provided by the Congress for your agency's programs
are intended to be distributed on a fair share basis,'' he wrote
June 5, 1986. HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce responded that fair
share distribution was no longer the rule.
   Laxalt wrote on June 16, 1986, seeking money for ``owners of
multi-family rental properties to upgrade older apartments.'' A
month later, Pierce provided funding for 100 apartments; in October,
another 150 units were approved.
   A parade of lawmakers has leaned on HUD for federal funds to send
back home as an easy way to win support from constituents. Some
fared better than others in an Associated Press review of requests
sent to HUD between 1984 and 1987.
   While many of the HUD replies carried Pierce's signature, they
actually were signed by a machine at the instruction of Deborah Gore
Dean, a special assistant to Pierce who emerged as one of the most
powerful people in the department even though her position carried
little official authority.
   Ms. Dean is at the center of a congressional investigation of
alleged influence-peddling at the department, where former HUD
officials or well-connected and highly paid Republican consultants
steered scarce federal funds to housing projects they owned or
represented.
   Congressional correspondence to the HUD office from 1984 to 1987
showed legislators requesting funds for housing projects that ranged
from homes for battered women to owners of multi-family rental
properties.
   A 1987 Virginia request serves as a typical example of how
Congress members were involved.
   Steve Smith, commanding officer of The Salvation Army in
Alexandria, Va., sent a letter Feb. 10, 1987, to Sen. Paul Trible,
R-Va., saying that approval of HUD funds would ``make it possible
for over 300 low-income families to remain in Arlandria (an
Alexandria neighborhood) and provide labor for low-income paying
positions in restaurants, stores, (for) office and blue collar
workers.''
   Trible, in turn, wrote to Pierce asking for the funds. Pierce
responded that ``every consideration'' would be given to the request.
   Democratic Rep. Frederick Boucher of Virginia asked HUD in 1985
to approve a proposal by B&amp;W Associates of Radford, Va., to
rehabilitate 152 housing units for the elderly in Altoona, Pa. The
housing secretary responded with a three-paragraph letter saying
``we regret to inform you that it is unlikely that it will be funded
this year.''
   In contrast, Sen. William L. Armstrong, R-Colo., received funding
for proposals that included a project for handicapped tenants in
Greeley, Colo.
   Even some Republicans had trouble at times winning funds.
   In 1985, Republican Pennsylvania Sen. John Heinz wrote to Pierce
complaining about the handling of his state's requests.
   Pierce replied, ``It is unfortunate that only 12 units could be
allocated to Pennsylvania in fiscal year 1985; however,
consideration had to be given to areas which received little or no
funding in prior fiscal years.'' Pierce noted that money was
available for 5,000 units nationwide.
   Heinz resubmitted his request in January 1986, and was told in a
letter that 10,000 units were available for that fiscal year and his
request would be considered.
   Most of Pierce's letters to the Congress members cited the lack
of available funding as the reason for rejections.

<HEAD>EDS: Subs 5th graph to replace `the most' with `more.'</HEAD>

   More innocent bystanders are being shot and
killed at crime scenes in four major cities, according to a study
that says criminals show a ``growing contempt for accidental
victims.''
   Forty-one innocent bystanders were reported shot in New York, Los
Angeles, Washington and Boston in 1986, and 20 of them died. In 1988
that number leaped to 135 shot and 37 killed, according to a study
by Lawrence W. Sherman, a University of Maryland professor of
criminology.
   Overall, in those three years, 250 innocent bystanders were shot,
of whom 71 were killed and 179 wounded.
   ``Homicide in America is becoming more barbaric,'' Sherman said.
``We may not expect honor among thieves, but we do expect some honor
among killers. The growing contempt for accidental victims is even
indicated by he name killers give them: `mushrooms' who `pop up' in
the line of fire.''
   The compilation of information differed for the four cities, but
the study found that New York City had more bystanders shot _ 128 _
in 1986-1988 than the other three. Los Angeles was second with 105
in the same three-year period, while Washington had 11 and Boston
had six.
   On a per capita basis, the study found, Los Angeles has twice as
many bystander shootings as New York.
   The study, scheduled to appear in the December 1989 Journal of
Quantitative Criminology, was based on published indexes to The New
York Times, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post and a
computerized search of The Boston Globe.
   Smiley Ashton of the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice
Statistics said his agency does not keep track of such incidents and
that ``the way they did it is probably the only way that it could be
done.''
   Sherman acknowledged in the study that a more thorough method for
studying the trends would be to review narrative reports filed on
homicides and aggravated assaults, but said the review of newspaper
accounts is ``the most efficient method'' even though ``there is a
danger that press accounts would tend to suppress any increase in
bystander shootings.''
   While bystander deaths still account for less than 1 percent of
homicides in the cities reviewed, ``A transformation of street crime
from a phenomenon of individually intended victims to one of
accidental or chance victims is a frightening prospect,'' the study
says.
   ``It demonstrates that criminals no longer follow the rules of
combat we expect them to follow: limiting violence to intended
targets, and not recklessly endangering innocent bystanders,'' the
study says.
   The study also found that in New York and Los Angeles, most
bystanders reported shot were victims of random shootings into
crowds, while in Washington and Boston, more were victims of single
stray bullets striking a lone individual. The lower incidence of
bystander shootings in the last two cities is attributable to this
difference, the study said.
   Among the possible reasons cited for the increase were more
disputes over drug deals, more guns in circulation and a trend
toward generalizing anger from one person to an entire group. The
study did not address whether increased use of semiautomatic weapons
had any impact on the number of bystanders shot.
   The study was supported by the non-profit Crime Control Institute.

<HEAD>Going Slow: Congress Inches Toward Implementing 1990 Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly a month and a half after Congress
whisked through a $1.17 trillion budget for fiscal 1990, the pace of
implementing the plan is slackening and its weakest links show signs
of unraveling.
   Pivotal lawmakers voice optimism that by the Oct. 1 start of the
new fiscal year, the package of spending and deficit-cutting bills
needed to implement the budget will be in place.
   The goal is a projected shortfall below the $100 billion target
mandated in the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
   But questions remain about where $5.3 billion in new tax receipts
sought in the fiscal blueprint will come from.
   Also unclear is how, and even whether, some of the rest of $28
billion in savings claimed in the budget will be achieved at all.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, ranking Republican on the House
Budget Committee, complained last week to a reporter that some
committees view cuts ``with a jaundiced eye and a cavalier manner. I
think we'll have difficulty with some of them.''
   The overall budget resolution for fiscal 1990 was approved May
18, the earliest date in a decade.
   But lawmakers now must approve other bills to carry out the
budget. Thirteen measures disperse money among federal agencies, and
another contains new taxes and spending cuts.
   The work on those 14 bills has gone slowly. And though Oct. 1
seems far off, Congress' generous summer recesses leave it with only
about eight weeks of work left until then.
   The House last week approved one of the 13 spending bills, an
$18.5 billion measure for science and water programs. House leaders
hope to complete the other 12 by the end of the first week in
August. The Senate has not begun to consider any of the spending
bills.
   Last year the House had completed all 13 spending measures by
June 30 and the Senate had disposed of four.
   Problems are arising, however, as lawmakers put together a plan
for cutbacks in Medicare, farm initiatives and other benefit
programs.
   Some of the savings are easy. Congress will save $1.7 billion by
simply declaring that the money-losing Postal Service is considered
``off-budget.''
   Other choices are tougher, such as the need to find $5.3 billion
in new tax collections.
   House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski considered
agreeing to a cut in the capital gains tax sought by President Bush,
who contends it would increase government collections by stimulating
the economy.
   But the Illinois Democrat abandoned that idea last week and said
he will instead tinker with a number of narrow tax provisions, such
as halting a tax break that encourages banks to lend money to
developing countries.
   It is unclear how such a tax package would be treated by Bush,
who has promised to reject any new taxes this year.
   Rostenkowski's panel also last week approved nearly $3 billion
worth of reductions in the growth of the Medicare program for the
elderly.
   But decisions by a host of other House committees remain to be
made. Among them are requirements for the Post Office and Civil
Service Committee and the Agriculture Committee to each save $1.1
billion, the Veterans Affairs panel to slash $666 million, and the
Merchant Marine Committee to find $200 million in cuts.
   ``We've been doing this for eight years and we've cut all the
easy stuff,'' said one committee aide, asking to not be identified.
``We're down to muscle and bones.''
   A crucial hurdle looms July 15, when the White House's Office of
Management and Budget collects data on the economy. A slow economy
boosts the deficit by cutting tax collections and increasing the
government's tab for unemployment and other support programs. This
could require Congress to find even more budget savings than
anticipated to reach the $100 billion deficit target.

<HEAD>First Jewish Wedding in Warsaw Synagogue Since Holocaust</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nozyk Synagogue was filled with song
and laughter but also painful memories as what remains of Warsaw's
once-vital Jewish community witnessed the city's first synagogue
wedding since World War II.
   The groom, Robert Blum of New York, and his Polish-born bride
Joanna Kan were married Sunday beneath a marriage canopy that had to
be borrowed from the state-run Jewish theater.
   Surrounded by television cameras, the groom broke a glass and the
synagogue erupted in multilingual good wishes.
   But behind the festive cheer at Warsaw's lone synagogue was the
memory of the more than 3 million Polish Jews killed by the Nazis,
and the destruction of part of the nation's culture.
   ``We used to have eight weddings every Sunday,'' said a guest,
New York businessman and concentration camp survivor Jack Eisner, as
he pointed to the balcony where he sang in the choir as a boy in
pre-war Warsaw.
   Fewer than 300,000 Polish Jews survived the war, and emigration
has reduced that number to less than 10,000, most of them elderly
Jews.
   In Warsaw alone, there were 380,000 Jews before the 1939 German
occupation, more than in any other city except New York.
   There were also 400 synagogues in the capital. The sole remaining
one, used as a stable by the Nazis, was not rebuilt until 1983 and
had not been used for a wedding since.
   Nor had there been a rabbi until the arrival about six weeks ago
of Menachen Joskowitz, a Polish concentration camp survivor who came
from Israel for a two-year stay.
   ``There's no heart left. There's only one synagogue, a
broken-down community, mostly of old people,'' said Blum, who lives
in Manhattan.
   ``When we saw what was happening here, we thought this would be
the greatest way to add meaning to our wedding. It came from our
heart.''
   Ms. Kan was Catholic, like more than 93 percent of Poland's
population, until she converted to Judaism after moving to the
United States from Warsaw six years ago. She met Blum while working
as a temporary employee at the New York firm of Fulbright, Jaworski
&amp; Reavis McGrath, where Blum practices corporate law.
   Blum said the couple was saddened by the synagogue when they
traveled to Poland last year to meet Ms. Kan's family.
   ``All of my Jewish education did not prepare me for what you see
here,'' he recalled. ``We thought, this is the last generation of
Jews in Poland. Considering their history here, it is very sad.''
   Blum said he hopes the wedding festivities will help rejuvenate
the Jewish community in Poland. He said he had found that some
younger Jews are ``coming out of the woodwork'' to rediscover their
religious roots.
   ``It feels different here in the synagogue than it did six months
ago,'' Blum said.
   There is still much uncertainty about anti-Semitism in Poland,
however.
   An officially inspired anti-Semitic purge in 1968 following
campus protests prompted most of the remaining Jews to leave. In
recent years there has been official and private reflection on
Poles' attitudes toward Jews during and after the war.
   ``There is a certain amount of underlying tension,'' said
Mitchell Blank, a boyhood friend of Blum from New York.
   Prior to the wedding, there was a last-minute hunt for yarmulkes
in a synagogue unaccustomed to a crowd of more than 200. It included
two dozen family members and friends from the United States, more
from Poland, several Jewish youth groups on tours from abroad and
members of Warsaw's Jewish community, which had received an open
invitation.
   ``It was a beautiful cermony. I've never seen anything like it,''
said Dorota Mroziak, one of Ms. Kan's three Polish Catholic
bridesmaids.

   Americans believe that Hollywood's golden age is
gone, victim of the videocassette recorder and the movie industry's
own excesses.
   Even as the summer's blockbusters smash box-office records, a
majority in a Media General-Associated Press poll gave unfavorable
reviews to most new films. And most said the overall quality of
movies has been declining.
   Three reasons were sex, violence and profanity. Overwhelming
majorities said most new movies have too much of each, and most of
the 1,084 adults in the poll said they prefer not to attend such
films.
   Ticket prices were another complaint. While three-quarters of
respondents paid $5 or less for their last ticket, a sizable 45
percent said the price was unreasonable. Moreover, six in 10 of the
most avid moviegoers, those under 30 years old, said ticket prices
were too high.
   Many film critics say Hollywood reached its pinnacle a
half-century ago, when the year's new flims included ``Gone With the
Wind,'' ``The Wizard of Oz'' and ``Wuthering Heights.'' But it is
this summer's hits _ ``Batman,'' ``Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade'' and ``Ghostbusters II'' _ that have set ticket-sale
records in their opening weeks.
   Despite such popular new fare, the poll found that Americans
watch movies on home videocasette recorders far more often than they
go to the theater. And half of VCR owners said they go out to movies
less since buying their machines.
   Ten percent of all respondents said they had gone out to a movie
in the previous week. A third said they had rented a movie cassette
in the previous week to watch on a home VCR.
   The same pattern held over time: Just 3 percent reported visiting
a movie theater more than 30 times in the previous year, but 25
percent said they had rented a movie for their home VCR more than 30
times in the year.
   In all, 75 percent said they owned a VCR.
   The poll's reviews were not all bad for the film industry: Six in
10 gave favorable marks to the last movie they had seen. But about
as many had an unfavorable impression of new movies in general.
   Criticism of content was extraordinarily high, with eight in 10
saying most new films have too much violence and too much profanity
and seven in 10 saying most new movies have too much nudity.
   Women were considerably more critical than were men. Strong
majorities of women said they would be less likely to attend a film
if it contained nudity, violence or profanity; most men, by
contrast, said those factors would not matter in their choice of a
movie.
   Seventy-seven percent of women said if a movie were violent they
would be less likely to see it, but just 41 percent of men agreed.
On profanity the female-male split was 69-44; on nudity, 72-42.
   Older respondents also were much more critical of content, and
movie attendance declined with age. Respondents under age 45 were
much more frequent moviegoers than those over 45.
   Fifty-six percent overall said the quality of movies has been
getting worse. That sentiment ranged from 42 percent of the youngest
group to 76 percent of the oldest, and from 48 percent of men to 64
percent of women.
   Similarly, 27 percent overall rated most new movies as ``poor''
and 34 percent rated them ``only fair,'' an unfavorable review by 61
percent. On the favorable side, 31 percent rated the movies ``good''
and just 3 percent said ``excellent.'' The few others had no opinion.
   Respondents who identified themselves as liberals were more
tolerant of profanity and nudity in the movies, although they
objected to violence as much as others.
   The poll, conducted May 5-13, had a margin of sampling error of 3
percentage points.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Odds Against Amending Constitution Don't Deter
Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Over the last two centuries there have been
10,393 attempts to amend the U.S. Constitution and only 26 successes.
   President Bush isn't bothered by those odds as he presses for an
amendment to protect the Stars and Stripes from destruction by
political protesters.
   The president says he's outraged over the Supreme Court's
decision permitting flag burning as an acceptable, if unattractive,
expression of the free speech guaranteed by the First Amendment.
   Bush wants a 27th amendment permitting Congress and the states to
pass laws banning the ``desecration'' of Old Glory.
   A check of the records shows that more attempts are being made
now than ever before to change the Constitution, with actual changes
just as infrequent as ever.
   No change has been made since the 26th amendment giving
18-year-olds the vote was ratified 18 years ago.
   In the first hundred years _ 1789-1889 _ 1,736 proposed
amendments to the Constitution were filed with Congress.
   From 1963 until the House adjourned last Thursday, 5,001
amendments have been offered.
   Those figures include, of course, multiple submissions of the
same ideas and repeat filings, Congress after Congress after
Congress.
   About two dozen resolutions have been filed in the House and
Senate to forbid flag desecration since the Supreme Court handed
down its decision on June 21.
   Such an amendment would have to be approved by the House and
Senate by two-thirds majorities. The amendment would be ratified and
made part of the Constitution only with the approval of
three-fourths of the 50 states.
   The difficulty of hurdling the barriers erected by the
Constitution's authors have not kept people from trying.
   Former President Reagan campaigned for eight years for an
amendment to require a balanced federal budget. As a private
citizen, he is campaigning still.
   Reagan also wanted an amendment allowing a president to line-item
veto individual sections of appropriations bills instead of dealing
with them on an all-or-nothing basis. He didn't get that either, at
least not yet.
   President Bush now has endorsed four amendments to the
Constitution: Flag desecration, anti-abortion, balanced budget and
line-item veto.
   The Equal Rights Amendment forbidding discrimination based on sex
was first introduced in 1923. Congress finally approved it in 1972
and sent it to the states for ratification. Its highwater mark to
date came in 1982 when the number of states voting to ratify reached
35, three states short of the required 38.
   Proposed amendments are pending in various forms to ban busing to
achieve racial balance in schools, to set a single six-year term for
the president, to set terms for House members at four years, to
forbid abortion, to make the District of Columbia the 51st state, to
make English the official language of the United States, and to
permit prayer in public schools.
   Other ideas floated over the last 20 years or so include:
Requiring a three-fifths vote for Congress to borrow money,
requiring a two-thirds vote to approve appropriations and budgets,
abolishing the income tax and limiting congressional immunity for
traffic offenses.
   Until now, the hurdles have proven too steep for all of the above.
   But one of the earliest proposed amendments _ it appeared to have
died on the vine early in the 19th Century _ is showing new signs of
life because of 20th Century controversy over congressional pay
raises.
   Drafted by James Madison and submitted to the First Congress, it
states: ``No law varying the compensation for the service of the
senators and representatives shall take effect until an election of
representatives shall have intervened.''
   Its effect would be to give the voters a chance to retaliate
before a legislative pay raise takes effect.
   Congress approved the proposition on Sept. 25, 1789, and sent it
to the states. Only six states voted to ratify, until a drive began
a few years ago to breathe new life into it.
   In recent years five additional states have voted to ratify it.
That brings the total after two centuries to 11 and holds out at
least a slim chance that Madison's idea may someday become a part of
the Constitution.

<HEAD>Teachers Should Lead the Drive to School Reform, NEA President Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Uncertain when vote will occur; top prospects uncertain</HEAD>

   Teachers must ``reject reaction'' and act as a
constructive force in school reform, according to outgoing National
Education Association President Mary Hatwood Futrell.
   The NEA was choosing a new president today to take over when
Futrell steps down at the end of the summer after six years at the
helm of the 2-million-member union.
   Running to succeed Futrell were union vice president Keith Geiger
of Michigan and executive committee member John Wilson of North
Carolina.
   ``I am still Mary the teacher,'' the departing NEA president told
8,400 delegates Sunday at the annual NEA Representative Assembly.
``Remember me as ... someone who has chalk dust on the sleeves of
her soul.''
   Don't rain on the parade of educational reform _ lead it, she
urged in her final speech.
   ``We must embrace change and reject reaction,'' she said. ``We
must continue to expand politically and professionally as we have
over the last 20 years, especially the last five years ... We must
push hard, we must take risks, we must never let up.''
   As the nation's largest union and one of its most politically
active, the NEA has considerable clout both in Washington and at the
grassroots level.
   Of the two candidates, Geiger was generally considered more
moderate and likely to continue on the course set by Futrell, while
Wilson promised passionate leadership with no bows to public opinion.
   Geiger, in accepting his nomination Sunday, described himself as
an experienced collective bargainer who would be ``tough but
flexible'' as president.
   ``You deserve a president who will confront issues squarely, but
will never confuse confrontation with results,'' Geiger told the
delegates. ``Your next president must know when to stand firm and
when to bend, how to recognize necessary and legitimate reform and
how to recognize political posturing.''
   Wilson vowed to teach politicians and corporate leaders that ``we
deserve good pay for the work we do and we shouldn't have to jump
through a lot of hoops to get it.''
   He attacked merit pay as wrong and divisive and pledged to ``do
everything in my power to defeat it.'' He also attacked
``educational bureaucrats who stand in our path'' to reform by
piling on paperwork and cutting back budgets.
   Both candidates praised Futrell and echoed her theme of teacher
empowerment. Geiger told the delegates that ``you must play the key
roles in deciding how your schools are run,'' while Wilson said he
``will not rest until the classrooms of the future are shaped by
those who work in them.''
   In a speech interrupted more than 60 times by applause and
standing ovations, Futrell spoke on broad issues ranging from gun
control to the global economy to subjects specifically affecting
children and education.
   She said the NEA must stand firm in its opposition to vouchers,
tuition tax credits and half-baked suggestions from ``the elitists,
the politically ambitious and the educationally inexperienced.''
   But Futrell exhorted the union, once labeled ``the status quo
incarnate'' by former Education Secretary William Bennett, to be a
constructive force in school reform.
   Futrell said system-wide restructuring must be conceived and
executed by educators and that NEA should take the lead.
   She also reiterated NEA calls for full funding of federal
education, health and nutrition programs for disadvantaged children.
She scolded President Bush for failing to accept an invitation to
speak to the group, whose membership is about one-third Republican.

   Traffic here has gotten so bad that officials
are discussing using the 500 miles of flood control channels as
part-time freeways.
   Promoters think Los Angeles County's concrete waterways are a
congestion reliever. Detractors say if you see aqua, duck.
   It's an idea that has surfaced from time to time during the past
20 years, always to be scuttled because of better options, says Jim
Sims, director of transportation programs for the county
transportation department.
   ``Now, we're at the point that we may be running out of
attractive alternatives. And we may be at the point where we could
live with something we can't use all the time,'' Sims said.
   ``In the past it hasn't been shown to be feasible,'' said Kathy
Delegal, spokeswoman for the county's Department of Public Works,
which maintains the channels. But traffic congestion has worsened,
so ``it should be looked at again,'' she said. ``We're open-minded.''
   All agree that traffic in Los Angeles County is on the brink of
busting through its barriers. Of the 10 busiest freeway interchanges
in the United States, six are in the county and two are in
neighboring Orange County, according to the state Department of
Transportation.
   The nation's busiest interchange is the West Los Angeles junction
of the Santa Monica and San Diego freeways, used by about 513,000
vehicles daily.
   The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission's newly approved
budget includes $100,000 for a feasibility study on channel
conversions. The study is to be completed early next year and will
focus only on engineering and hydrology.
   Environmental concerns, safety and other barriers would be
considered if the engineering feasibility is positive, Sims said.
For example, the impact of an oil or diesel fuel spill on the harbor
most be reviewed.
   One of the channels targeted for possible conversion is the Los
Angeles River, largely paved over in the 1950s. It starts where the
Calabasas and Bell creeks come together in the San Fernando Valley,
passes east of downtown and heads to the harbor, Ms. Delegal said.
In sections, it ranges from 45 feet to 160 feet across and is
between 30 and 40 feet deep, she said.
   The channel often is used by police and the Rapid Transit
District for driver training. Movie studios use it for location
shooting.
   ``They like it for car chases,'' said Jean Granucci of the
Department of Public Works.
   Sims said the channels would be used by specialized
transportation, trucks, car pools or van pools. ``Obviously, it
wouldn't be usable 365 days a year,'' he said.
   Deputy Mayor Mike Gage called the concept ``ludicrous'' and said
Mayor Tom Bradley would prefer to see the channels used for rafting
and swimming.
   State Assemblyman Richard Katz criticized Bradley for rejecting
the idea so quickly.
   ``Unlike people at City Hall, I don't profess to know the answers
until I get the facts,'' he said. ``The whole point of the study is
to find out what will work.''
   Sims said ramps with gates would have to be built for the
part-time freeways, and plans devised ``to clear people out when it
rains.''
   KNX-AM traffic reporter Bill Keene likes the idea. ``It's great
if the weather stays decent,'' he said. He suggested the waterways
be turned over to trucks since they ``are responsible for 33 percent
of our accidents and 66 percent of our major tieups.''
   But the flood control channel conversion is not the ultimate
answer, Sims cautioned: ``We are trying to look at every idea we can
to reduce congestion _ including ideas that haven't been thought of
before.''
   Among the other options authorities have studied are double-deck
freeways; commuter and Metro rails; and in-vehicle television
screens that show congestion and suggest alternate routes.

<HEAD>Farm Economy Rebound Expected to Continue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's farm economy is in its third year
of recovery, and an Agriculture Department analyst says no serious
downturn is likely in the next few years.
   Greg Hanson of the department's Economic Research Service says
U.S. agriculture has shown a strong recovery from the early 1980s.
   ``Since the start of 1987, farm incomes and finances have
rebounded more strongly than anticipated,'' he said. ``Net cash
income is projected to average $56 billion (annually) during
1987-89, about $10 billion higher than the 1984-86 average, while
debt fell more than 10 percent in 1987-88.''
   Farm exports have rebounded by 40 percent since the mid-1980s,
and there has been a reduction of 3.3 billion bushels in the U.S.
stockpile of corn, wheat and soybeans.
   ``Higher prices brought about by lower stocks and strong export
demand likely will extend the financial recovery through the end of
1989 and into 1990,'' Hansen said in the July issue of Agricultural
Outlook magazine.
   But how solid is the recovery? The 1980s began with ``a bloated
cost structure that was a precondition for the ensuing financial
crisis,'' he said. Will farmers avoid a repetition in the 1990s?
   Hanson hedges a bit, noting that there are many factors beyond
the control of individual farmers: global weather patterns,
multilateral trade negotiations and currency exchange rates, for
example.
   But he also notes that many fundamentals of the farm economy are
stronger and that agriculture is now a growth industry:
   _Crop sales receipts have increased 23 percent and livestock
sales 12 percent since 1986, with farm output expected to be
slightly higher this year than in the mid-1980s.
   _Capital investment is up one-third, with spending on new
tractors, machinery and buildings expected to be about $3 billion
more than in 1986.
   _Farm real estate values are forecast up one-sixth since 1986,
with land values rising slightly faster than inflation this year.
   Hanson said the reduced stockpile of commodities and a growing
demand for those products ``undergird current sales strength and
investment growth'' in U.S. agriculture. Long-term factors suggest
that ``supply will not soon dwarf demand, and that farmers will not
soon experience another deep financial crisis'' like the one in the
mid-1980s.
   One reason for optimism, he said, is the Conservation Reserve
Program, which will idle 30 million or more acres a year through the
mid-1990s under long-term agreements with farmers to protect fragile
crop land. The goal actually is 40 million to 45 million acres.
Comparatively, an average of 23 million acres were idled between
1979 and 1985.
   A cheaper U.S. dollar bodes well for farm exports, Hanson said.
One dollar bought about 40 percent less German and Japanese currency
in 1987-89 than in 1984-85.
   ``This makes U.S. exports more competitive with European
producers, and U.S. farm commodities cheaper for Japanese
consumers,'' he said. ``Given the continuing U.S. trade and budget
deficits, it is not likely that the dollar will rebound for an
extended period to mid-1980 levels.''
   Another hopeful sign is the improved state of farm finances,
Hanson said. Between 1985 and 1988, the number of commercial farmers
with annual sales of at least $40,000 who faced loan default
declined by about 50 percent to 60,000.
   Farm debt also fell by $45 billion over a six-year period,
putting producers in a much stronger financial position than in the
mid-1980s.
   ``This provides a cushion that will enable most farmers to
withstand one or more years of reduced profits should agricultural
growth slow or stall in the next few years,'' he said.
   Another factor is difficult to judge, but it's there: Farmers are
survivors.
   ``Today's farmers have survived a cost-price squeeze and the
financial problems brought about by land-value deflation after debt
tripled in the 1970s,'' Hanson said. ``They have survived all the
business problems of a major crisis, and in the process have learned
valuable lessons.''
   For example, he said, record net cash incomes in 1986, 1987 and
1988 ``tended to be used conservatively to pay down debt and make
needed investments and improvements.''
   While land values and investments have rebounded from 1986 low
marks, farm debt continued to fall in 1988 and is forecast to be
stable in 1989. Up to 75 percent of this debt reduction is from
farmers paying off loans, not loan losses.
   ``Farmers likely will continue to avoid an over-investment
trap,'' Hanson said. ``There is heightened awareness of the
long-term importance of daily cost control and sound management.''
   He added: ``This is an intangible factor that is as important as
higher commodity prices, lower stocks, more competitive exchange
rates, and less financial stress.''
   Lest he appear too rosy about the future, Hanson said a number of
things could happen to cloud the situation.
   Recurrence of a cost-price squeeze could be one of the threats,
along with continued heavy reliance on government payments, lower
profits in the livestock sector, unsuccessful trade negotiations or
major scientific breakthroughs that could cause lower prices.

   Want to live a long life? Then go and
live in Vietnam, where 2,432 people are 100 or older and the oldest
is a 142-year-old woman, according to the Vietnam News Agency.
   Chances of living longer are much higher for a woman than a man
with female centenarians, 1,728, far outnumbering males, at 704, the
official news report said.
   Satistics from the Central Census Guidance Board show that
Vietnam's most senior citizen, Ngan Thi Quang, is 142 years old, the
report said. She belongs to an ethnic Thai minority in the central
part of Vietnam, said Sunday's report, a transcript of which was
received in Bangkok on Monday.
   The oldest man is 130-year-old Hoang A Giang, a member of the
Hmong ethnic minority in the north, the report said.
   The 1989 Guinness Book of World Records says the oldest living
person whose age has been authenticated is 112-year-old Birdie May
Vogt of Miami.
   It also says ``centenarians surviving beyond their 113th year are
of the extremist rarity and the present absolute limit of proven
human longevity does not admit of anyone living to celebrate any
birthday after their 120th.''

<HEAD>Eastern Increases Flights, Continental Offers Special Fare</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines has nearly tripled its flights in a
move that was met with outrage from union workers who have been on
strike against the carrier for four months.
   ``Fly Cheap. Die Cheap,'' about 100 striking pilots yelled Sunday
at the first Eastern passengers to fly out of Fort Lauderdale since
the strike began.
   ``Our purpose is to get the public aware of our problems and to
let them know we are still on strike,'' said Robert Fay, a pilot for
32 years. ``We're not here for greed. We're here on principle.''
   In San Francisco, one of the cities where service resumed, 300
striking machinists and pilots formed a line passengers had to push
through.
   At Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport, passengers crowded
Eastern's gates.
   ``It gives you an uneasy feeling to walk across a picket line,''
said Jeff Handler, who passed through Hartsfield on his way from
Sarasota to Greenville, S.C. He noted his tickets cost $79 each way,
much less than fares of competing airlines.
   ``Such is life,'' he said, smiling as he made his way through the
crowded concourse.
   In all, Eastern increased its scheduled daily flights to 225 from
80, serving 49 cities instead of 27. The move was in line with a
rebuilding plan the carrier has submitted to U.S. bankruptcy court.
Eastern filed for bankruptcy reorganization March 9, five days after
the strike began.
   Also Sunday, Continental Airlines, which like Eastern is also
owned by Texas Air Corp., announced $76 one-way fares on U.S.
flights for three days following the Fourth of July holiday. United
Airlines plans to match the offer, said United spokesman Joseph
Hopkins.
   Before the Machinists union strike, Miami-based Eastern operated
1,040 daily flights to 102 cities and had 30,000 employees.
   Currently, Eastern is operating with about 8,000 employees,
including 300 pilots who did not honor the strike and 150 new pilots
recruited and trained since the strike began. About 550 other pilots
are in training, and a recruiting drive continues, said Eastern
spokesman Robin Matell said.
   By December, Eastern plans to reach its goal of 800 flights a day
serving 77 cities, Matell said.
   ``Everything is going as planned _ we're right on target to come
back strong,'' he said.
   ``The only thing you might notice is some gray hair in the
cockpit,'' Matell said, noting the average age of its new hires is
about 40. ``These guys are older and they have more experience.''
   Air Line Pilots Association spokesman L.D. Williams said
Eastern's decision to increase its flights is unsafe because of the
shortage of qualified pilots.
   ``They're not able to get enough qualified people to replace us
and they're not going to be around for the amount of time it takes
to do that,'' Williams said. ``They have lowered their standards.
They are desperate for pilots.''
   Matell said passenger traffic on the new flights has been strong.
   ``We've been offering comeback fares, real bargains, and the
public has been gobbling them up,'' the spokesman said.
   Houston-based Continental is offering the $76 one-way fare on all
of the carrier's flights in the U.S. mainland where seats are
available for trips beginning Thursday, Friday or Saturday.
   Continental's sale fare requires no advance purchase, but it must
be bought within 24 hours of the time the reservation is made.
Travelers may return as early as Sunday, or can stay as long as they
like.

<HEAD>Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Says He's Retiring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says he's sorry Adm. William J.
Crowe Jr. has decided to retire this fall as chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
   ``He did an outstanding job and is doing an outstanding job and
very candidly, I'd like to have had him stay,'' the president told
reporters at his family home in Kennebunkport, Maine, after Crowe
announced his retirement plans on Sunday.
   Crowe, interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' said, ``I am
going to retire. I have not said that before, publicly.''
   The military chief said he will retire on Sept. 30 at the end of
his second two-year term as chairman.
   Crowe was appointed to the post in October 1985 by then-President
Reagan and was reappointed in September 1987. Crowe, 64, had
reportedly been urged by Bush for months to spend another two years
in the post.
   Crowe also said Sunday that despite the ``change afoot'' in the
Soviet Union, an agreement soon on reducing the two superpowers'
long-range nuclear arsenals is unlikely.
   ``My own instincts are that it will require protracted
negotiations,'' said Crowe, who recently returned from an 11-day
tour of Soviet military facilities.
   Crowe said there is no question that the climate for negotiations
has improved between the recess last fall of the U.S.-Soviet
Strategic Arms Reduction Talks and their resumption in Geneva
earlier this month.
   ``But the same fundamental issues that have plagued us are still
there,'' he said. ``We have some very difficult questions on
accounting rules. We start from different baselines on practically
every question that we address. ... The devil is in the details.
General principles don't hack it.''
   Crowe said his trip to the Soviet Union did not alter his basic
view on U.S.-Soviet relations, even though he acknowledged the
changes taking place there are the biggest event during his tenure
as top U.S. military officer.
   ``We should move warily and carefully, exploiting opportunities
as they present themselves, but we should be very deliberate in our
own actions and take steps as the horizon clears, not prematurely,''
he said.
   Crowe said he is concerned that Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has ``underestimated the difficulties'' in switching his
country's priorities from a military to a domestic economic footing.

<HEAD>SWAPO Kicks Off Campaign With Conciliatory Stand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KATUTURA, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rebel group that for 23 years fought
for independence from South Africa has opened Namibia's election
campaign with a generally conciliatory stance toward the territory's
white minority.
   In announcing its platform on Sunday, the South-West Africa
People's Organization, known as SWAPO, also pledged to improve the
lot of the impoverished black majority and to champion socialism.
   ``SWAPO does not conceal its belief in the moral superiority of
socialism over capitalism,'' the group's campaign manifesto said.
   With banners waving, about 25,000 people, almost all black,
attended SWAPO's first official campaign event Sunday in the
four-month campaign for elections that are to lead to independence.
   ``This is the beginning of victory,'' SWAPO spokesman Danny
Tjongarero told the crowd at a community center in Katutura, a black
township outside Windhoek, the capital.
   SWAPO's platform is generally kind to opposition groups, such as
the 75,000 whites who make up just 6 percent of the population but
own the majority of private land and businesses.
   ``No wholesale nationalization of the mines, land and other
productive sectors is envisaged in the foreseeable future,'' said
Hage Geingob, the leader of SWAPO's election campaign.
   In the election, SWAPO is widely favored to win the most votes
and possibly the two-thirds majority needed to control the writing
of a new constitution.
   Sunday's crowd, dressed in the red, blue and green colors of
SWAPO, frequently broke into song and chants of ``SWAPO Must Win!''
Many supporters wore T-shirts with the face of SWAPO leader Sam
Nujoma, who has yet to return from more than 20 years in exile.
   Despite the pledges against nationalization, SWAPO's platform
also advocates a strong government role in shaping and controlling
the economy.
   Geingob said the organization's main objectives were to close the
gap between wealthy whites and impoverished blacks and to upgrade
basic services such as education, health care and housing.
   He did not say where the money would come from.
   South Africa, which has provided up to 25 percent of the
territory's $700 million budget in recent years, says it will cease
its aid when the territory gains independence, probably early next
year.
   The South Africans, who have ruled Namibia since 1915, agreed to
grant independence under a peace plan signed in December with Cuba
and Angola.
   The U.S.-brokered accord calls for Cuba to withdraw its 50,000
soldiers from Angola, where they have been supporting the Marxist
government. The Cuban pullout has been proceeding on schedule, and
last month Angola and the U.S.-backed rebels there agreed to a
cease-fire in their 14-year civil war.
   SWAPO said it did not want to create a one-party communist state.
It called for a democratic state with a bill of rights that would
guarantee freedom of religion in the mostly Christian territory of
1.3 million people.
   It did not say whether it would tolerate political opposition and
press freedom.
   SWAPO's main political rival, the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance,
says it fears SWAPO will crack down on opposition groups if it gains
power. The alliance is a multiracial coalition that favors a
multiparty democracy and a market-oriented economy.
   SWAPO draws its strongest support from the Ovambo people of
northern Namibia and also has a solid base in Windhoek.
   Political parties have been campaigning for several weeks, but
the weekend marked the formal start of the campaign. More than 4,000
U.N. personnel are in Namibia to supervise the independence process.
   Voter registration begins Monday. An estimated 500,000 people
will be eligible to participate in the elections, according to
officials.

<HEAD>World Bank Loans Hit Record 21.9 Billion Dollars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Loans by the World Bank to Third World
countries, now at a record level, are expected to keep escalating in
the next year, bank officials say.
   The World Bank, the biggest source of aid to the Third World
countries, announced Sunday that its loans had reached a record
$21.9 billion in the year that ended Friday, up from $19.2 billion
the year before.
   Bank Vice President Moeen Qureshi predicted the total will be
about $1.75 billion higher in the year to come.
   This year's figure would have been higher if the Board of
Executive Directors, representing the United States and 150 other
member governments, had approved $780 million worth of loans
scheduled for China in June. World Bank President Barber Conable, a
former New York state congressman, deferred the matter after the
violent Chinese crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing.
Then President Bush asked for a delay.
   The United States is the largest contributor to the World Bank.
   Qureshi, a Pakistani, called the events in China ``very
distressing.''
   ``The situation is going back to normal insofar as the
implementation of bank projects is concerned,'' he told reporters.
   He added that the delay in loans to China was not a sanction
against that country. The loans will be reconsidered later in
consultation with the Chinese government, one of the members, he
said.
   The bank is supposed to make decisions on economic grounds and
work on a business basis.
   Qureshi estimated that last year the bank got back about $1
billion more in repayments and interest than it loaned out, and $3.5
billion the year before. Qureshi said this year's figures include
prepayments of $1.4 billion from Romania, $700 million by South
Korea and $400 million by Thailand. Without those repayments, the
bank would have paid more than it took in.
   Though Romania is one of Europe's poorest countries, President
Nicolae Ceausescu announced in April the completion of an eight-year
program of paying off the country's $11 billion foreign debt. South
Korea and Thailand are among the Pacific rim countries of Asia which
have been increasingly prosperous.

<HEAD>Florida Crackdown Nabs 2,200; L.A. Sweep Nets 400 Arrests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   One thousand officers from the Florida Panhandle to the Keys
arrested 2,000 people on charges of using or dealing crack, and
police in Los Angeles arrested more than 400 people in anti-gang
sweeps.
   Many of the Florida suspects were nabbed by undercover officers
posing as dealers, while others were captured in raids and dramatic
foot chases.
   Many also were back on the street within hours.
   After the 48-hour roundup ended early Sunday, officers counted
2,076 arrests. In addition to the arrests, they seized 3,500 rocks
of crack cocaine, 327 vehicles, more than $55,000 in cash, nearly 10
pounds of powdered cocaine and 50 firearms.
   ``It's gone way above our expectations,'' said Broward County
Sheriff Nick Navarro, who organized ``Operation Rock Pile,''
believed to be the largest coordinated effort against street-level
drug users and dealers.
   At some places Saturday night, authorities were taking in
suspects at the rate of 100 an hour, with more than a third of the
arrests in south Florida.
   The Florida Sheriffs Association plans to meet later this month
to plan more large drug sweeps, said Al Gordon, Broward Sheriff's
spokesman.
   ``Look how much crack we took in. It shows these type of
operations work. You can expect more,'' Gordon said.
   Gang members were the targets of the police sweeps in Los
Angeles, part of a continuing ``Operation Hammer,'' which began last
summer. Of the 412 people arrested, authorities said 221 were gang
members.
   But a religious leader said a bill that was enacted last year and
allows police to designate particular gangs as criminal doesn't go
far enough. The Rev. Carl Washington urged state lawmakers to revise
the bill so that anyone can be charged for belonging to a gang.
   ``There's no such thing as a gang for social gathering,''
Washington said Sunday evening.
   Gangs were believed to be the cause of violence that erupted
Saturday during a six-hour soul concert at the Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum. Nearly 250 officers assigned to the sweeps were diverted
to the arena when warring gangs stabbed three people and fired shots
at others, said Detective Tony Celli.
   Details of the disturbance were unavailable from police, although
a Los Angeles Times review of the concert said hundreds of skittish
people ran for exits as fights broke out on the field.
   The Florida crackdown involved 67 sheriff's offices and several
police departments.
   ``I am delighted with it,'' said Volusia County Sheriff Bob
Vogel. ``We're attacking both ends _ supply and demand.''
   Vogel, who has gained notoriety for seizing suspected drug money
from interstate motorists near Daytona Beach, said the statewide
effort will be repeated until street-level buyers and sellers get
this message: ``If you sell crack cocaine or purchase crack cocaine,
you're going to jail.''
   Many of the suspects were charged with either cocaine possession
or dealing, and used bail bondsmen to post their $5,000 to $10,000
bond.
   Authorities targeted high-crime urban areas, but were surprised
by the more than 400 arrests in the mostly rural Panhandle.
   ``It shows that crack is not just an urban problem,'' said Gordon.
   The tactics used in the sweep _ particularly undercover stings _
raised concern with some civil rights groups.
   ``Anytime you have reverse stings with police used as a lure for
drug users you're entering a very sensitive area,'' said Charleen
Carres, legislative counsel for the Florida chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union in Tallahassee.
   ``The ACLU is in favor of battling drugs, but we don't feel
peoples' rights should be violated in the rush to stop drug
traffic.''

   With the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s grave as a
backdrop, black leaders marked the 25th anniversary of the Civil
Rights Act by urging President Bush to back up his words with deeds
and support affirmative action.
   ``Mr. Bush has got to get up and make the White House the right
house,'' said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference. ``It's not enough to talk that
talk. We need him to walk that walk.''
   The Civil Rights Act, which President Johnson signed into law
July 2, 1964, banned segregation in public places and discrimination
in the workplace.
   Lowery, one of several rights leaders who met with Bush on
Friday, said recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions against affirmative
action programs have left blacks doubting whether the president
would work to protect progress made under the law.
   ``I'm going to remain hopeful for the time being,'' Lowery said.
``Mr. Bush has good instincts. He wants to do what's right in this
regard.''
   Friday, Bush called on Congress to re-authorize the Civil Rights
Commission, which is set to expire Nov. 30.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said last week the
administration would not push Congress to overturn the Supreme Court
decisions, which make it more difficult to prove discrimination in
employment.
   Lowery said civil rights leaders are concerned that Bush is
paying lip service to their cause, and added the president is
``going to have to make up his mind'' by either bolstering black
membership in the GOP or pleasing ultra-conservatives.
   Lowery was joined at King's gravesite by Rosa Parks, whose
refusal to sit in a segregated section of a Montgomery, Ala., bus in
1955 sparked the civil rights movement.
   Mrs. Parks said Bush's statements ``sounded good, but we are
waiting for real, real action.''
   About 200 people gathered for Sunday's prayer service, during
which Lowery blasted Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor for
her position against affirmative action.
   ``Glory be to God, if it weren't for affirmative action she'd
still be in Arizona presiding over a microwave,'' Lowery said,
adding that the American public should ``remind Sandra who she is.''
   Lowery scolded the crowd for not singing ``This Little Light Of
Mine'' with enthusiasm, saying that if civil rights leaders had
``sung with that kind of spirit'' during the movement, ``we would
still be in slavery.''
   The crowd responded by singing with three-part harmony.

   President Bush's nomination of his chief
political fund-raiser to be U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg is in
``deep trouble'' because of the man's involvement in the Housing and
Urban Development scandal, says Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole.
   ``I would guess it may be a while before he goes to Luxembourg,''
Dole said Sunday, referring to Frederick M. Bush, who is no relation
to the president but was finance director for both his 1980 and 1988
presidential campaigns.
   ``And if he goes, it may just be as a visitor,'' Dole quipped,
speaking on CBS' ``Face the Nation'' program,
   Frederick Bush was questioned extensively last Thursday and in
May by the House Government Operations Committee about hundreds of
thousands of dollars in consultant fees which his lobbying firm,
Bush &amp; Co., reaped in 1986 and 1987 for HUD projects in Puerto Rico.
   Frederick Bush acknowledged in his testimony that he had
contacted political appointees at HUD. But he said he did not feel
his campaign efforts on behalf of George Bush or his job as deputy
director of the vice president's staff from 1982 to 1984 gave him
``political influence'' with HUD officials.

<NOTE>Thornburgh Requests List of Convicted Flag Burners</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh says he has
directed the Justice Department to compile a list of federal
prisoners convicted of burning the U.S. flag in anticipation that a
recent Supreme Court decision will lead to their freedom.
   ``If someone is entitled to relief, then all are entitled to
relief,'' Thornburgh said. The court's 5-4 decision in a Texas case
said flag burning is a constitutionally protected form of political
protest.
   Thornburgh said, however, that he doubted that more than ``a
handful'' of federal prisoners are involved.
   Thornburgh made the comments on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley'' in response to a question about Carlos Mendoza-Lugo, a
Puerto Rican nationalist now at the U.S. penitentiary in Atlanta.
   Mendoza-Lugo, who was given a one-year prison sentence after
pleading guilty to a federal charge of flag desecration, last week
filed a petition in U.S. District Court for his release.
   ``My expectation is that he probably will be entitled to that
relief,'' Thornburgh said of Mendoza-Lugo, who burned a U.S. flag
two years ago in front of a U.S. Post Office as a protest for Puerto
Rican independence.

   Ousted Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
granted his wife's wish that he live to see her 60th birthday but
remained in critical condition with massive organ failure.
   ``I thank Ferdinand for this beautiful gift, his great strength
of spirit, that strength will help me carry this burden,'' Imelda
Marcos said on her birthday Sunday, after a Roman Catholic Mass at
the couple's home-in-exile.
   Marcos, 71, was battling widespread infection and was being kept
alive by machines at St. Francis Medical Center, where he has been
hospitalized since January.
   The hospital said his condition essentially was unchanged since a
failed transplanted kidney was removed Thursday. Aides said Marcos'
fever had subsided and that while lapsing in and out of
consciousness he seemed to recognize his wife.
   About 75 people attended the Mass, held under a white canopy in
the backyard of the hillside home overlooking downtown Honolulu and
the Pacific.
   Mrs. Marcos, wearing a red dress with a blue and white scarf and
black sunglasses, was greeted with traditional Hawaiian leis and
several dozen red roses, balloons and a large arrangement of
Hawaiian flowers.
   She was joined by her children, Irene Araneta, who lives near San
Francisco, and Ferdinand Jr., commonly known as ``Bong Bong.''
   Mrs. Marcos said she remained optimistic that Marcos would
recover. She promised she would never remove him from the
life-support equipment.
   She was less hopeful that Philippine President Corazon Aquino
would relent in her refusal to permit Marcos to come home to die.
   Mrs. Aquino accuses the Marcoses of stealing billions of dollars
during his 20-year rule.
   ``As long as there is life, there is hope,'' Mrs. Marcos said.
``I am no longer optimistic in Mrs. Aquino, but I'm so blessed that
Ferdinand is still around.''

   Six years ago, a Navy ship plucked Thaison Nguyen
and other Vietnamese refugees from a small open boat in the stormy
Pacific.
   Now the newly naturalized U.S. citizen, who has taken the first
name Eugene from a character in a the novel ``Look Homeward,
Angel,'' is bound for the U.S. Naval Academy.
   He hopes to become a pilot, a dream since he watched American
planes streak over his Saigon home, but says he never considered
joining the Air Force.
   ``The Navy rescued me. If it hadn't been for that destroyer, I
would probably be dead,'' Nguyen, 20, said in an interview just
before Independence Day.
   After Saigon fell to the communists in 1975, the family moved to
the coastal city of Nha Trang. Nguyen's father, who had served in
the South Vietnamese navy, was sent to a ``re-education'' camp
intended to indoctrinate him in communist thought. He wasn't
released until 1982.
   He and his father and a brother made several attempts to flee in
small boats. Twice they were turned back by government ships and
other times they were chased off the beach by gunfire.
   Finally, in September 1983, the father and two sons made it to
the open ocean with 35 other people in a fishing boat, hoping to
reach the Philippines. Five days later they were picked up by a U.S.
destroyer. Nguyen remembers it well: the U.S.S. Benjamin Stoddard.
   ``The flag was what I saw first,'' Nguyen said. ``I don't think I
ever saw my father so happy.''
   Nguyen's mother, a younger brother and a sister are still in Nha
Trang.
   The three refugees settled in the Atlanta suburb of Norcross and
Nguyen started eighth grade, learning English along the way.
   He did well at Sequoyah High School, especially in math. He made
the soccer team, worked for the school newspaper and joined the Beta
Club, an honor society. This spring, he graduated fourth in his
class of 350.
   But after taking Naval Academy entrance exams, two things stood
in his way: his height _ 5-foot-1}, a quarter-inch shy of the Navy
requirement _ and a mediocre verbal test score.
   Nguyen contacted Sens. Sam Nunn and Wyche Fowler of Georgia for
help. Fowler's committee on military academy appointments agreed to
meet with him last November.
   ``I was kind of scared about it. If I failed that, I wouldn't get
another chance,'' Nguyen recalled.
   Fran Weiss, a Fowler staffer, said the youth's eloquence and
desire to serve the United States swayed committee members into
nominating him. ``The story that he told, it moved us,'' she said.
In May, Naval Academy officials agreed to approve the appointment.
   Nguyen recalled that when he heard the news, ``My head was just
exploding. It just went apart.''
   Help from Fowler's office also helped Nguyen get a swearing-in
scheduled promptly after he first became eligible to become a U.S.
citizen last month. On June 23, Nguyen took the oath of allegiance
to the United States and gave a speech to the 150 other new citizens.
   ``I told them there couldn't be a greater title than the title of
citizen of the United States,'' he said.
   Nguyen becomes a midshipman this month. And he plans to stay in
the Navy beyond the five-year service requirement after he is
commissioned.
   ``Somebody picked me out of the ocean, got me here, educated me,
and gave me a chance,'' he said. ``This is my country.''

   A huge beach party involving a college
fraternity ended in violence that left three men shot, one stabbed
and 11 people under arrest, police said.
   The most seriously wounded from Saturday's violence at Jones
Beach State Park was a 22-year-old New York City man listed in
critical condition, authorities said.
   Saturday's party drew at least 12,000 people, many members of the
Omega Psi Phi fraternity, said state police Lt. Stephen Kowal.
   The group has gathered without permits at the beach during recent
Independence Day weekends, said Kowal.
   ``There's a lot of drinking, and we suspect probably a lot of
drugs. ... It usually ends up in fights breaking out between the
groups,'' said Kowal, who was hospitalized after a 1986 brawl
involving the fraternity.
   Saturday night's violence was sparked by two separate
confrontations, Kowal said.
   The first was an argument that left two men shot; the second
started when a car was blocking traffic, police said.

   Joining Arens were fellow ROTC members Michael Revel, 18, Brian

flag burning should not have First Amendment protection.
   ``The flag is our national symbol and should be treated with

   ``Getting the haircut was kind of a patriotic thing to do.''

<TEXT>
   The governing Liberal Democrats, reeling from
financial and sex scandals, suffered a setback in Tokyo elections
viewed as a barometer for national elections later this month,
official results showed today.
   Of 128 seats in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, the party won 43
seats, a loss of 20, in Sunday's vote and the Japan Socialist Party
increased its representation from 12 to 29 seats, according to the
Tokyo Board of Elections.
   Also winning seats were seven independent candidates backed by
the Socialists, the country's largest opposition party.
   Opposition parties now hold a combined majority of 85 seats in
the Tokyo assembly. In the outgoing 127-member assembly, they
together held just one more seat than the Liberal Democrats.
   The Komei (Clean Government) Party won 26 seats, the Japan
Communist Party 14 seats, and the Democratic Socialist Party three
seats. Four minor parties had one seat each, and independent
candidates not backed by the Socialists captured two seats.
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, plagued by allegations he has kept a
number of paid mistresses, blamed an unpopular sales tax imposed
April 1 for the Liberal Democrats' setback.
   Uno, the party president, did not stump for Liberal Democrats at
the request of the Tokyo branch of the party.
   A senior governing party official in Tokyo, Shigeru Kasuya, told
the NHK television network that the party's losses were partly due
to skepticism about the Liberal Democrats' campaign promise to
consider doing away with the tax.
   He said Tokyo residents were suspicious of the party's ``true
intention.''
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Masajuro Shiokawa said voter ``distrust
in politics'' led to the Liberal Democrats' losses, adding that the
government will do its best to achieve political reforms and regain
public confidence.
   Japan Socialist Party chairwoman Takako Doi told NHK, ``Our
party's gains are a result of anger against the current political
situation.''
   Prominent in the opposition's campaign were criticisms of the
Liberal Democrats for the new 3 percent tax, the broad Recruit
influence-peddling scandal, and Uno's alleged extramarital affairs.
   News reports have cast doubt on whether Uno, premier for only one
month, will be in office by July 14 for the Paris summit of
industrial nations.
   Kyodo News Service reported that representatives of several
Liberal Democratic factions met late last week and agreed Uno should
resign as soon as possible ``for the benefit of the party.''
   Uno has denied reports he will resign.
   The Recruit bribery scandal forced Uno's predecessor, Noboru
Takeshita, to resign June 2.
   Soon after Uno took over as premier, a former geisha claimed in a
published interview that Uno paid her sex. Reports that Uno kept
other mistresses filled the press last week.
   Business leaders called the Liberal Democrats' electoral losses
serious and shocking. Eiji Suzuki, president of the Japan Federation
of Employers Associations, and others said the election was a sign
the public had lost confidence in the pro-business Liberal Democrats.
   Although a local election, the Tokyo poll was dominated by
national issues and considered a sign of how the Liberal Democrats,
who have governed Japan since 1954, will fare in a national election
for half the seats in the upper house of parliament on July 23.
   The party's large majority in the more powerful lower house could
also be challenged in elections later this year if parliament is
dissolved over public discontent with the government.
   Shiokawa, the government's chief spokesman, said late last week
that a lower house election ``might come before long.''
   About 5.18 million people, or 58.7 percent of the total eligible
voters, cast their ballots Sunday on a drizzly day, up from 53.5
percent in previous elections held in 1985, the Tokyo Board of
Elections said.
   More than 61 percent of registered women voted, compared with 56
percent of men, the Board said.
   Of 33 women candidates for seats in the assembly, enlarged to 128
seats this year, 17 won seats.

142.50 yen and 144.90 yen.
   The dollar rose in the morning on news that the opposition
parties were pulling ahead in vote counting from Sunday's Tokyo
metropolitan election.
   But it fell sharply in the afternoon, confounding expectations
that a defeat for the pro-business LDP would hurt the yen.
   ``To a certain extent, markets predicted last week that the LDP
would be defeated _ from the LDP defeat in Niigata (parliamentary
by-election) _ and people bought dollars and sold yen,'' said
Sumitomo Bank's Toshiaki Kakimoto.
   ``People say that the market is unstable before you know the
result, but it quiets down once the result comes in,'' he added in
explanation of today's turnabout for the dollar.
   Kakimoto also said the Bank of Japan had intervened heavily,
selling an estimated $500 million to 600 million in the morning and
another $200 million to $300 million in the afternoon.
   ``The Bank of Japan forced the dollar down. They seem to feel
that the 140-yen range is not favorable for the United States,'' he
said.
   ``They also probably wanted to prevent the yen from going too
low, which might happen in overseas markets if the Bank of Japan
decided not to intervene,'' Kakimoto added.
   On the stock market, an analyst at Nomura Securities, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said the markets may have been reacting
positively to the LDP's defeat.
   ``The political issues didn't revolve around whether the LDP was
bad or whether Japanese democracy was no good; rather, they focused
on common sense and morality issues,'' he said.
   With a humbler LDP government, ``it may be possible to have
discussions on whether, for instance, the consumption tax is
favorable,'' he added.
   But the analyst said the fundamental problems of the United
States' economic slowdown and lower interest rates still were
affecting the stock market.
   Steel issues were the only stocks to receive particular attention
today, he added.

   Inmates beat to death a guard at a
maximum-security state prison, authorities said.
   The 2,108 inmates at Stateville Correctional Center were being
kept locked in the cells indefinitely today.
   Lawrence ``Frank'' Kush Jr., 24, of Chicago Heights, died at St.
Joseph Medical Center on Sunday night, a day after an unspecified
number of inmates beat him with a pipe, said Nic Howell, a state
corrections department spokesman.
   ``We are not to the point yet of specifically identifying who did
what,'' Howell said. ``But the investigation has turned up
indications of people who were involved.''
   The last time a Stateville prison employee was killed was in
October 1988, when a supply supervisor in the commissary was slain
by an inmate during an attempted robbery.
   The inmate is awaiting trial in the slaying.

<TEXT>
   Gobs of brown seaweed are piling up on
some beaches quicker than they can be hauled away, and officials
don't know what is causing the seaweed assault.
   For weeks, tons of seaweed have washed up on beaches from the
Padre Island National Seashore below Corpus Christi to Holly Beach,
La., and beyond on the Gulf of Mexico Coast.
   It began in early-to-mid May and, although it may have tapered
off some in spots, it hasn't quit yet.
   ``It's a losing battle,'' said Thomas Garza, a Mustang Island
State Park ranger. ``You can't fight Mother Nature.
   ``It's keeping three dump trucks busy,'' Garza said. ``They've
been doing the same thing the last three or four weeks. Nueces
County's doing the same thing on their beaches.''
   In Galveston, high tides from Tropical Storm Allison last week
helped by pushing most of the seaweed from the surf line into
parking areas at R.A. Apffel and Stewart Beach parks. Storm tides
also pushed the seaweed toward the back of the narrower western
beaches but left most of the rotting material lying on the sand in
front of the dune line.
   Still, small new deposits have washed up and officials fear that
seaweed carried back to sea will come ashore again.
   The seaweed is really sargassum, or brown algae, that grows in a
calm part of the mid-Atlantic Ocean.
   There are many theories as to why the seaweed has come ashore in
such large amounts, with some blaming storms and other weather
conditions.
   ``If I had to guess, I'd guess that there's a slightly unusual
current pattern that's bringing more of the seaweed into the gulf
and more of it into this part of the gulf,'' said Bill Wardel, a
Texas A&amp;M University-Galveston marine botanist.
   Although the seaweed has plagued swimmers, it helps prevent
erosion by promoting growth of sand dunes, said Kenneth Conway,
Cameron County park system director.

   Lord Callaghan, the former British prime minister
and foreign secretary, today remembered Andrei A. Gromyko as a tough
negotiator who softened toward the end of his tenure in the Soviet
leadership.
   ``He was a good executor of a bad foreign policy that has now
changed,'' said Callaghan, who, as James Callaghan was foreign
secretary in a Labor government from 1974-76 and prime minister from
1976-79.
   Callaghan said Gromyko, the longtime Soviet diplomat, foreign
minister and president, was ``a very hard man to negotiate with.''
   ``He represented Soviet foreign policy at a time when it was
expansionist and dogmatic,'' he said. ``Toward the end of his
period, especially as president, he softened and I was astonished
when he described me as a good friend.''
   Callaghan said that in private, Gromyko ``could relax and unbend.
He and his wife had a love of art and they particularly wanted to
see the Tate Gallery when he came to London to study the works being
displayed there.''
   Gromyko died Sunday at age 79.

   Thunderstorms raked Louisiana and Texas today, and a front
drenched parts of South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin.
   Showers and thunderstorms associated with the low pressure center
which once was Tropical Storm Allison were scattered from Alabama
and Georgia to Indiana and Ohio.
   Thunderstorms in Louisiana spawned tornadoes that damaged a home
in Alexandria and destroyed a business at Deville. Strong winds
downed trees and power lines around the state and knocked mobile
homes off their moorings.
   Thunderstorms moving southward across the eastern half of Texas
spattered golf ball-size hail in Wise and Tarrant counties, with
winds blowing down trees, tearing the roof off a building at Coleman
and raring up to 90 mph in the Dallas area.
   Hail the size of baseballs thumped Dorset, Minn., on Sunday
night, generated by storms that developed ahead of a cold front in
the north-central region. Twisters were reported near Nevis, Pine
River and Motley, and high winds downed trees at Grand Rapids, Minn.
   Today's forecast was for scattered showers and thunderstorms in
Texas, with heavier showers and thunderstorms in Louisiana and
Mississippi.
   A flash flood watch was in effect today for northwestern Georgia,
much of Alabama, and southeastern Mississippi.
   Heavy rainfall totals for the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT
included 2.6 inches at Dallas, 1.32 inches at Fort Polk, La., and an
inch at Evansville, Ind.
   For Monday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from
southeastern Illinois across the Ohio Valley, in the western
Carolinas, and from Georgia to Louisiana and Florida.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the upper 60s and 70s
over the Pacific Northwest; near 90 degrees from southern New York
along the Atlantic Coast to Florida and the Mississippi Valley,
North Dakota and Montana; the 90s and above over the rest of the
Plains and the Rockies; from 100 to near 110 degrees over Texas' Rio
Grande Valley, and as high as 115 degrees or more through the desert
Southwest. Highs over the remainder of the nation were expected to
be in the 80s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 47
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to to 93 degrees at Phoenix.

   The dollar was lower in busy European trading this
morning, pulled down by local elections in Tokyo and expectations
that the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon ease its monetary policy,
currency dealers said.
   Gold prices rose as much as $4.50 an ounce.
   Dealers said the dollar was under heavy selling pressure due to
profit-taking on reports Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party
suffered setbacks in Tokyo metropolitan elections and on
expectations that the U.S. economy is slowing, which could lead to
lower U.S. interest rates.
   They said that while results from the Tokyo elections were coming
in as expected, many used the occasion to sell dollars and take
profits.
   ``There's a lot of pressure on the Fed,'' added Manfred Totzauer,
vice president at Citibank in Frankfurt. ``They've got to ease if
the American economy is weakening.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 1.45 yen to a closing 142.50 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 142.10 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.9314 West German marks, down from 1.9510
   _1.6553 Swiss francs, down from 1.6728
   _6.5535 French francs, down from 6.6200
   _2.1745 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2020
   _1,396.50 Italian lire, down from 1,410.50
   _1.1957 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1980
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5705 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5535 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $375.20 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $371.75. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $375.40.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $375.50, up from $371.00 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.73 to close at a bid $375.93.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.21 a troy ounce,
up from Friday's $5.14.

   A group of 13 Americans leaves for Greenland this
week to try to dig out a squadron of eight World War II airplanes
buried in polar ice since 1942.
   The U.S. planes _ two bombers and six fighters _ are buried
beneath 260 feet of polar ice. The Atlanta-based Greeland Expedition
Society wants to dig out all the planes and bring them to the United
States, maybe even repairing one of the fighters on site and flying
it off the ice.
   But expedition members will be happy simply to cut a piece of
metal from one of the eight aircraft. ``If we could get a control
wheel out of a B-17, it would be ideal,'' said Richard Taylor, an
architect and pilot who will make the trip.
   The eight aircraft are estimated to be worth a total of $5
million if repaired.
   The eight planes have been in Greenland since July 15, 1942 where
their crews belly-landed them on the icecap when they ran out of
fuel. The planes had been headed for England but were forced to turn
back because of bad weather.
   On the way back, the crews received incorrect weather
information. Later there was speculation the information was sent by
a German U-boat.
   All 25 crew member were rescued after nine days.
   The eight airplanes were covered with snow and essentially
forgotten until the early 1970s, when their story got to Pat Epps,
an aviation pioneer and owner of Epps Aviation in Atlanta.
   Several attempts to find the planes were made, and last summer,
an expedition located the aircraft by subsurface radar and pushed a
steam probe down to bump one of the aircraft.
   On Wednesday, the expedition of 13 _ nine of them pilots _ leaves
for the first three-week trip to Greenland. They will carry 3{ tons
of food and equipment. Other supplies have been shipped to Iceland
and will be ferried in as needed.
   Among the adventurers was Norman Vaughan, 84, of Trapper Creek,
Alaska. In 1942, the Air Force sent then-Maj. Vaughan, a dog musher
raised in Alaska, by dog sled to recover a secret bombsight left
with one of the B-17s.
   The group will use a 475-pound thermal borer to melt a one-meter
wide hole straight down through the ice to one of the aircraft, a
B-17 called Big Stoop.
   Once the craft is reached, a 2-inch disk of metal will be cut
using a small coring device.
   ``If everything else fails, we will have at least one piece of
tangible proof we have found the aircraft,'' Taylor said in a
weekend interview.
   Then the group will use electric chain saws to cut a toward the
plane, in a bid to extract if from the ice.

   For Roy and Jacki Johnson, it will be a
traditional Fourth of July, with picnics, swimming and volleyball.
   No flags on the lapel, though. No lapels, for that matter.
   No clothes at all, actually.
   The Johnsons, members of the Northwest Sunbathing Association,
will celebrate Independence Day in the buff with 500 bare-bottomed
brethren at a ranch converted from an old logging camp.
   Johnson joined the nudist club in 1959.
   ``Roy is what's known as a born nudist,'' said his wife of 17
years.
   It was more than a year after she started going to Kaniksu Ranch
with him that Mrs. Johnson removed her shirt. When she joined in
completely she realized ``how silly I'd been.''
   ``It's just a freedom that if you haven't tried it, you wouldn't
know what it feels like,'' Mrs. Johnson said.
   The 320-acre ranch near Deer Lake, 60 miles north of Spokane, has
cabins, a clubhouse and kitchen, swimming pool, sauna and hot tub.
``Just about anything anyone with or without clothes could ask
for,'' Mrs. Johnson said.
   Members from 15 nudist clubs in five states were attending the
weekend gathering, which also features a king and queen pageant and
a dance.
   The nudists include doctors, priests and other professionals.
   ``But when we're all together we're all just people, and there's
no competition,'' Mrs. Johnson said. ``You don't have to worry about
what so-and-so wears to dinner.''

<TEXT>
   Abe Stolar is coming home to celebrate the Fourth
of July after 58 years in the Soviet Union, a time that began with
Depression-era dreams of finding a workers' paradise and ended with
a fight to emigrate.
   Despite it all, the 77-year-old Stolar is still a Chicagoan. When
he talks, the accent is pure West Side.
   Stolar left the Soviet Union in March, departing abruptly after
fighting for 14 years to go to Israel with his wife, his son, his
daughter-in-law and two grandchildren.
   He and his wife, Gita Rozovskaya, are arriving in Chicago on
Tuesday, the first stop in a 12-city U.S. tour that will take them
from Anchorage, Alaska, to Miami before it winds up in Los Angeles
on Aug. 13.
   ``His memory of Chicago is just frozen in time, in 1931,'' said
David Carle, a spokesman for Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who helped
draw attention to Stolar's efforts to leave the Soviet Union.
   Home _ Chicago _ has changed.
   The Depression is over. The skyline is taller. Humboldt Park _ a
working-class neighborhood populated largely by Eastern European
Jews when he left _ is largely Hispanic.
   But Wrigley Field looks much the same, though the venerable
ballpark now has lights. Stolar is to watch Wednesday night's game
there between the Cubs and the San Diego Padres.
   Still, ``baseball is not his passion,'' said Linda Opper of
Chicago Action for Soviet Jewry, which is financing and arranging
his visit. ``His passion is opera, the Art Institute, the Chicago
Theater.''
   Stolar also has vivid memories of the grand 3,000-room Stevens
Hotel, now the Conrad Hilton and Towers, which has invited him to
stay in its Chicago suite on the 23rd floor. The hotel was recently
refurbished, but its grand ballroom and grand salon, dazzling with
mirrors and gold leaf, are virtually unchanged, said assistant
manager Peter Borup.
   No special menu is planned, since Stolar is ``a junk-food
junkie'' who likes hamburgers and hot dogs, Borup said.
   While he gets reacquainted with Chicago, Stolar plans to visit
with old friends, Ms. Opper said, and there is even talk of a high
school reunion.
   Stolar was 19 when at the height of the Depression his
Russian-born parents headed home to help build a new Soviet society.
   ``Abe planned to stay only a short time,'' Ms. Opper said.
   But Russia was changing, and history got in the way.
   In 1937, Stolar's father disappeared in the Stalinist purges. His
mother and a sister died in Siberian camps. He served in the Red
Army and lost the sight in one eye to a German hand grenade.
   After World War II, he worked as an announcer and translator for
Radio Moscow, married and had a son, Michael.
   ``He's a very up person no matter what's happening. He's also a
wonderful complainer, ... but that's talk,'' Ms. Opper said.
   ``He is philosophically an optimist. I think that has helped him
stay healthy, I think that has helped him stay young.''
   One day Stolar's son came home excited at winning a school
contest.
   ``He looked at his son, so full of hope, so full of enthusiasm,
and he thought, `This boy will never go anywhere in this country.
We've got to get out,''' Ms. Opper said.
   He made his first move in 1975, but he and his family were held
up over ``a slight problem'' with his wife's visa.
   The problem, concerning information she had access to at her job
as a chemist, took more than 10 years to resolve, years that brought
Stolar a daughter-in-law, Julia, and grandchildren, Sarah, 3, and
Choni, 1.
   Then, Julia's mother refused to sign a financial-release waiver
she needed to leave the country.
   Finally, in March, the family was allowed to leave.
   Despite the changes that appear to be coming to the Soviet Union
under Mikhail Gorbachev, Stolar ``believes a lot of the changes are
cosmetic,'' Ms. Opper said.
   ``Many of Abe's friends have immigrated, but there are thousands
of people who still cannot leave.''

<TEXT>
   Three bombs exploded at
Belfast's Harbor Airport early today, damaging two commuter aircraft
but causing no injuries, police said.
   An anonymous caller to a Belfast radio station said the Irish
Republican Army planted the bombs. He used a codeword to
authenticate the claim and said a fuller statement would be made
later.
   One blast damaged the undercarriages of two aircraft parked on
the tarmac, while two others exploded near the air traffic control
tower and on the airfield, said police Sgt. Freddie Handley.
   The airport received a telephone warning eight minutes before the
first bomb went off, police said.
   The aircraft, a Shorts 360-300 and a Shorts 330, are both
twin-turboprop passenger planes built by Short Brothers Ltd., an
aircraft and missile maker. It is being sold to Canada's Bombardier
Inc., an aerospace company.
   The state-owned Short Brothers, Northern Ireland's biggest
employer, owns Harbor Airport, the second largest in the British
province. Located on the capital's north side, it operates domestic
flights to mainland Britain and the Irish Republic.

   A Greek tanker that ran aground and spilled
420,000 gallons of heating oil off Rhode Island limped into New York
waters today for repairs.
   The World Prodigy, escorted by a tugboat with pollution gear
aboard, awaited high tide outside New York Harbor to enter a
drydock, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Wayne Wertz.
   Coast Guardsmen watching the ship from the air reported no oil
leaking, said Wertz. The vessel was carrying nearly 8 million
gallons of oil at the time of the accident, but most of it was
pumped out immediately afterward.
   The tanker, which hit a reef June 23 at the mouth of Narragansett
Bay, left Sunday under Coast Guard escort, moving under its own
power at a slow 7{ knots because of holes in the hull. The Coast
Guard vessels eventually dropped back.
   The captain, Iakovos Georgudis, was at the helm. He faces federal
pollution charges after admitting he entered the bay without a
harbor pilot on board.
   A Coast Guard marine safety officer also rode on the bridge.
   ``I'm glad to see it's gone,'' said Joseph Sweetland, a Sunday
beach visitor. ``There's a lot better view out here and with that
thing sitting out there, anything could happen, I guess.''

<TEXT>
   The founder of the new African American
Catholic Congregation says he will adhere to Catholic teachings on
issues such as abortion and priestly celibacy while incorporating
African and southern black religious traditions.
   The Rev. George A. Stallings celebrated the Imani Temple's first
service on Sunday before about 2,000 people at Howard University Law
School.
   Stallings said he created the church because he believes the
establishment Catholic church had failed to meet the spiritual and
cultural needs of blacks. Imani means ``faith'' in Swahili.
   But Cardinal James A. Hickey of Washington has condemned
Stallings' plans for the new church, which were announced two weeks
ago, and forbade Stallings to celebrate mass.
   ``In spite of his claims to the contrary, Father Stallings'
action is a serious step toward separating himself from the Roman
Catholic Church,'' Hickey said recently in a statement.
   Stallings has said that he has been fired by Hickey as evangelist
for the archdiocese.
   Sunday's service began with an entrance procession that included
one participant wearing ``dreadlocks'' and others who shook bells
and used rattles traditionally used in African ceremonies.
   The ceremony included Catholic prayers and liturgy, along with
words borrowed from African and Southern black revival traditions.
Black representatives of other faiths, including Baptists and
Muslims, attended to show support for Stallings' move.
   At one point, Stallings chanted, ``We can't wait. How much longer
does the Roman Catholic church need?''
   Stallings, in an interview broadcast on WRC television on Sunday,
said he plans to abide by Catholic teachings on issues such as
abortion, birth control and celibacy for priests.
   But Stallings said, ``just because we will follow the church
teaching does not mean we won't challenge. Laws are not good when
they bind and constrict men and women.''
   He said his Imani Temple church will allow women to serve in
various church ceremonies although they will not be ordained as
priests.
   But Stallings said the Roman Catholic church will inevitably lose
black members if strict bans on abortion and premarital sex are not
loosened. Some blacks also believe celibacy for priests should be
optional, he said.
   Stallings, a convert to Catholicism, attracted national attention
as pastor of St. Teresa of Avila parish in southeast Washington when
he began to incorporate into the traditional mass the gospel music
and preaching and worship styles familiar to many blacks.
   In 12 years at St. Teresa's, membership increased from 200 to
2,000, Stallings said. There are about 80,000 black Catholics in the
Washington archdiocese.
   Stallings said he has not been formally excommunicated by Hickey.
``The church can't throw me out, and even if they do throw me out, I
have my own opinion... they have theirs,'' he said.
   Excommunication is a term ``used by the powerful to threaten the
powerless,'' Stallings said.

   Police today searched for two men
suspected of planting a car bomb that killed a British soldier and
injured his wife and four children. The Irish Republican Army
claimed responsibility for the attack.
   The explosion occurred on Sunday evening as the victim opened the
door of his red Mercedes, police and British military officials
said. Bomb experts later found another explosive nearby and defused
it, authorities said.
   An statement from the IRA, which is outlawed in Ireland and
Britain, said the dead man ``could be the last soldier to die as a
result of the British occupation of Ireland if the British
government was to accept that after 20 years its military and
political policies in our country have failed.''
   The claim was made today in a telephone call from the Republic of
Ireland to a free-lance journalist in Northern Ireland. The caller
used a codeword to authenticate the claim.
   It was the second attack on British military in West Germany in
two weeks.
   ``We are forced to take our struggle beyond Ireland because the
British public are restricted by their government from learning of
its failure in Ireland and the resistance to its rule,'' the IRA
statement said.
   The car was parked along a quiet, residential street where many
British military families live on the outskirts of this northern
city.
   The Ministry of Defense in London identified the soldier as Cpl.
Steve Smith of the Royal Tank Regiment, a native of Yorkshire county
in northern England.
   Pete Brown, a spokesman for the British Rhine Army in
Moenchengladbach, said today the soldier's wife and four children
were still being treated at area hospitals. Police said Smith's
wife, 30-year-old Tina, and the couple's children, ages 2 through
11, were in satisfactory condition.
   Bomb disposal experts called to the scene found another explosive
device hidden under a car and defused it, and residents of nearby
apartments were evacuated while police searched the area for other
bombs, officials said.
   Hanover police said today that they were looking for two suspects
in their 30s whom witnesses saw nearby shortly before the attack.
Police have composite sketches of the pair, officials said.
   On June 19, a bomb exploded in the living quarters at a British
military barracks near Osnabrueck. No one was injured in the blast.
Police suspect the IRA in that attack.
   On June 14, West German prosecutors indicted two suspected IRA
members on attempted murder charges in connection with 1987 and 1988
bombing attacks aimed at the British military that wounded 46
people, most of them West Germans.
   The IRA has attacked British troops on the continent in its
campaign to force the British out of Northern Ireland and unite the
predominantly Protestant province with mostly Roman Catholic Ireland.

   A day-care center for adults with AIDS opens
this fall, offering medical attention as well as classes and other
activities for people who might otherwise be stuck at home or put in
the hospital.
   ``I'm looking forward to it as a place to get out of the house,''
said Keith Permenter, 32, who quit as an assistant administrator at
a law firm because of AIDS-releated illness. ``I want to take art
classes. You can only watch so much daytime television, and you get
tired of talking to the dog.''
   The Continuum HIV Day Services, set to open in September near
City Hall, will offer at least 75 people an alternative to more
expensive institutions such as nursing homes and hospitals.
   Adult day-care centers have been springing up across the country
in the past decade, but most focus on the elderly. Medical advances
are allowing people with AIDS to live longer, turning the disease
into a long-term, chronic illness similar to ailments effecting the
elderly.
   Both groups often require constant supervision because of
dementia, which may cause victims to become forgetful and combative.
   The center, which will be open to people who have recently tested
positive for the AIDS virus as well as those with AIDS or
AIDS-related illness, received a $200,000 state grant and a $150,000
city contract financed with federal tax dollars.
   Private donations, fees from clients and medical insurance also
will help pay bills.

<HEAD>New Greek Parliament Sworn in Without Papandreou</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deputies in a new Parliament controlled by
a coalition of leftists and conservatives were sworn in today and
were expected to plan an investigation of financial scandals in
former Premier Andreas Papandreou's government.
   Papandreou, whose Panhellenic Socialist Movement finished second
in the June 18 parliamentary elections, did not attend the ceremony.
   His successor, Tzannis Tzannetakis, and the new 22-member Cabinet
attended.
   The government, formed Sunday after a pact between the
conservatives and a Communist-led alliance, ended a political
impasse after no party won a majority in Parliament in elections
June 18.
   The leftists and conservatives say they will govern together for
three months to begin investigations of a series of financial
scandals under Papandreou.
   He did not attend the ceremony, despite an announcement last week
that he would be well enough to go. As a party leader, he
automatically won back his seat in the Parliament and will lead the
opposition.
   Papandreou, 70, is recovering from pneumonia and kidney failure
at the Athens General State Hospital.
   In the new one-chamber Parliament, the conservative New Democracy
has 145 seats and the Coalition of the Left and Progress holds 28
seats.
   Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement, with 125 seats, did
not participate in the government.
   The other two seats are held by a minor party and an independent.
   The Parliament's leadership will be elected Tuesday. The chamber
is then expected to begin procedures for prosecuting Socialist
members accused of involvement in financial scandals.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrei A. Gromyko's unsmiling countenance and
staunch, party line positions personified the Soviet Union for
nearly three decades.
   The 79-year-old former foreign minister, whose death was
announced today, lived only nine months after being retired from the
largely ceremonial presidency to make way for Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
the Communist Party chief who wanted to turn the job into a powerful
post.
   But the man known to Western diplomats as ``Old Stoneface,''
``Mr. Nyet'' and ``Grim Grom'' paved the way for Soviet leaders to
make a graceful exit. Until Gromyko left the ruling Politburo with
official praise on Sept. 30 and was retired the next day from the
presidency, most senior Soviet officials either died in office or
fell from power into obscurity.
   Gromyko's stature was confirmed today when Gorbachev announced
his death to the legislature, the Supreme Soviet, and deputies stood
in unison for a moment of silence.
   Gromyko died 16 days shy of his 80th birthday.
   One of the best-remembered pictures of him was one of the last.
He sat amid members of the ruling Communist Party Politburo, the
only person not casting an affirmative vote for his removal from the
presidency. He abstained.
   Gromyko appeared again in public in January to attend a
conference of Americans, Soviets and Cubans who were involved in the
1962 Cuban missile crisis.
   Two days before the crisis erupted, Gromyko calmly told President
John F. Kennedy the Soviets had no missiles in Cuba. At the
conference in January, other Soviet officials disclosed that
one-third of the Kremlin's nuclear arsenal was deployed in Cuba at
the time, with another third aboard ships bound for the island 90
miles off Florida.
   Although he served nearly four years as president, providing a
visible symbol of continuity as Gorbachev overhauled the Soviet
leadership and bureaucracy, Gromyko was best known outside the
Soviet Union as his government's career foreign policy chief.
   Born July 18, 1909, into a Byelorussian peasant family, Andrei
Andreyevich Gromyko joined the Communist Party as a young man and
rose quickly through government ranks.
   He served every leader from Josef Stalin to Gorbachev. He dealt
with hundreds of foreign officials whose faces changed with the
world order after World War II, and he was regarded as a skillful
spokesman for his country's interests.
   Gromyko was respected by those who faced him across the
bargaining table for his ability to enunciate his government's
policy and for his voluminous knowledge of historical detail. But
his stubborn refusal to bend on key issues frustrated adversaries,
who sometimes blamed him for blocking arms control by walking away
from the table.
   After joining the Foreign Ministry and being posted to Washington
after the outbreak of World War II, Gromyko rose quickly to the rank
of ambassador to the United States and was named his country's first
permanent representative to the United Nations in 1946.
   During the world body's formative years, he earned the nickname
``Mr. Nyet'' for the 26 vetoes he cast in the Security Council.
   Nikita Khrushchev, who elevated Gromyko to foreign minister, told
the United Nations the man was so loyal he would drop his pants and
sit on a block of ice if ordered him to do so. Gromyko sat
impassively as Khrushchev spoke, as he did again several years later
when Khrushchev startled the U.N. General Assembly by pounding a
shoe on his desk. There have been reports the infamous shoe was not
Khrushchev's but Gromyko's.
   Gromyko was a player in every superpower confrontation for more
than a quarter-century but rarely shared his private side. His
memoirs, published after he left the Foreign Ministry, were most
notable for their lack of spicy detail.
   Although he was generally regarded as a Communist Party
hard-liner, Gromyko nominated the relatively youthful reformer,
Gorbachev, to take over the Soviet leadership in March 1985.
   And although Gorbachev then removed Gromyko from the foreign
minister's post he had held 26 years, Gromyko continued to serve in
a visible role as chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet,
which made him head of state, the equivalent of president.
   Gromyko's advancing age and Gorbachev's announcement in June 1988
that he planned to create a strong presidency as part of an overhaul
of the Soviet political structure made Gromyko's replacement
inevitable.
   He said he was sad to leave.
   ``Age is a stubborn thing,'' the veteran Communist said in a
televised statement on the night his retirement was announced.

   The bungalow where disciples of Charles Manson
murdered Rosemary and Leno La Bianca 20 years ago is for sale for
$599,000.
   Despite the price, the 1,655-square-foot house is so rundown that
Cliff Claycomb, one of the real estate agents listing the property,
called it a ``tear down.'' It has broken windows and its guest house
is a charred ruin.
   Since the LaBiancas were slain in 1969, the house, built in 1922
and remodeled in 1930, has been occupied mainly by renters.
   Another property made infamous by the Manson family, the house
above Benedict Canyon where actress Sharon Tate and four other
victims were murdered, reportedly sold in January for $2 million.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III left for
Japan today and talks with officials from other nations on a
proposed $2 billion-a-year aid and investment package for the
Philippines.
   Baker was to discuss in Tokyo the five-year aid program, which is
designed to help the Philippines' young democracy overcome economic
backwardness and a determined leftist guerrilla movement.
   The program envisions $1 billion a year in economic aid from a
variety of donors over the next five years, plus a similar amount in
private investment.
   The United States is seeking $200 million from Congress as its
contribution to the program. Combined with other programs, the
administration is asking a total of $658.6 million for the
Philippines for the next fiscal year.
   Representatives from the European Economic Community, Canada,
Australia and other nations also are attending the meeting, which is
being convened by the World Bank.
   The three-day meeting opened today, and Baker will spend 22 hours
in Tokyo before heading for a meeting in Brunei.
   Brunei is the site of the annual meeting of foreign ministers of
Southeast Asian Nations, informally known as ASEAN. As is customary,
the U.S. secretary of state and other interested parties from
outside the six-member ASEAN group hold consultations at the
conclusion of the ministerial meeting.
   Former Secretary of State George P. Shultz attended six of the
so-called post-ministerial ASEAN conferences.
   Baker will spend two days in Brunei, focussing on the prospects
for peace in Cambodia. The meeting could help determine whether a
negotiated settlement among rival factions in Cambodia is possible
after the expected completion of the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces
in September.
   Another topic on the agenda in Brunei is the evolving situation
in China and the political and economic fallout of last month's
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.
   ASEAN's members are the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand,
Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.
   Baker then heads for Poland, where he will link up with President
Bush at the start of his four-nation visit to Europe, highlighted by
the economic summit meeting next week in Paris.
   En route to Poland, Baker will spend a day and a half in the
Arabian Peninsula country of Oman. There he will confer with
officials of the Oman government, with which the United States has
had close ties, and rest up for his visit to Europe.

   The U.S. Embassy filed a protest today over what
it called a premeditated army attack on apartments of American
diplomats and other foreigners last month.
   The protest is likely to further worsen relations already made
tense by U.S. criticism of China's crackdown on unarmed
pro-democracy protesters.
   Also today, two Taiwanese reporters said a colleague was taken
away by security forces after he reportedly met with fugitive
student leader Wang Dan. The reporters said they feared Wang also
was arrested.
   The evening television news reported five people have been
arrested, including three students, allegedly for stealing a
submachine gun from an army vehicle during the first days of the
crackdown. Four other people turned themselves in for stealing army
guns and were released, the report said.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Sheridan Bell said Charge d'Affaires
Raymond Burghardt delivered the protest note to the Foreign
Ministry, which did not respond immediately.
   Chinese soldiers fired into Jianguomenwai apartment compound on
June 6, a day after the State Department said the U.S. Embassy had
given refuge to two Chinese dissidents, Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li
Shuxian.
   A U.S. Embassy report charged the shooting was premeditated but
did not link it to China's anger over U.S. protection of Fang and Li.
   The United States filed one protest shortly after the shooting.
The new protest challenges for the first time the Chinese account
that soldiers were responding to sniper fire from within the
apartment compound.
   At the time, Radio Beijing said one soldier was killed and three
were injured, and plainclothes officers who went into the compound
brought out a Chinese man they claimed was the sniper.
   No witnesses reported seeing Chinese soldiers hit, however.
   The U.S. report said the arrest appeared to have been staged. It
also said the soldiers fired not only from the ground but from a
building across the street, where they had taken up positions the
day before.
   A diplomat from another Western country, speaking on condition of
anonymity, confirmed that some bullets were fired from the opposite
building and whizzed over the heads of children playing in the
foreigners' apartments. No one was hurt, but most foreigners
evacuated the compound later that day.
   ``There is no doubt, in this embassy's opinion, that certain
apartments were deliberately targeted,'' the U.S. report said.
   It said one U.S. defense attache's apartment was hit by 18
bullets. Ten other U.S. diplomats' apartments also were hit, as were
apartments of other nationals such as Spaniards.
   Shortly after the shooting, the European Economic Community asked
the Chinese government for an explanation, but received no response.
   China has agreed to pay for damage caused by the shooting.
   The Bush administration, in other responses to the Chinese
crackdown, has criticized it and cut off military aid.
   Wang, a history student at Beijing University, was a leader of
seven weeks of student-led protests in Beijing for a freer society.
He went underground after the army crushed the protests on June 3-4,
killing hundreds of unarmed civilians.
   Wang's name appeared on a list of 21 students wanted by police.
   Antonio Jiang, a reporter for Taiwan's Journalist Weekly, said
security officials searched Taiwan Independence Morning Post
reporter Huang Teh-Pei's hotel room at 3 a.m. today.
   Police grabbed him as he left his hotel just before noon and
pushed him into an unmarked car.
   Huang reported that he met with Wang on Sunday and was driving in
the Post's car when they realized they were being followed,
according to Jiang. Huang got out, and the driver left with Wang.
The driver has not returned, Jiang said.
   Beijing police and the city government Foreign Affairs Office
said they did not know if Wang was arrested. Jiang said police
denied any knowledge about Huang.
   Taiwan government spokesman Shaw Yu-ming urged Beijing to expel
Huang, as it has Western reporters who interviewed pro-democracy
students.
   Chinese guards stationed outside the U.S. and Australian
embassies, who normally carry only revolvers, were armed today with
long-barreled automatic pistols and wore military helmets for a
third straight day. Extra uniformed and plainclothers guards also
were posted.
   The guards refused to explain their new gear, which may be linked
to the presence of Fang and Li at the U.S. Embassy and unconfirmed
reports the Australians also were sheltering fugitives.
   In other developments, China's official newspapers gave over most
of their front pages today to pictures and biographies of 10 young
officers and soldiers killed during the June 3-4 attack.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping gave them the title ``guardian of the
People's Republic of China,'' which Western diplomats said they
believed was a newly created honor.
   The government said the 10 were beaten or burned to death by
protesters.

   A roadside bomb exploded today in south
Lebanon as an Israeli army patrol rolled by. One soldier was killed
and several were wounded, a security source said.
   An Israeli army spokesman confirmed the blast but denied there
were casualties.
   The security source, speaking in Tyre, 50 miles south of Beirut,
said the blast occurred about 1:30 p.m. in Israel's self-designated
``security zone'' as the convoy headed toward the village of Bint
Jbeil.
   The source, insisting on anonymity, said about 20 soldiers were
on a patrol mission in two armored personnel carriers and a jeep.
   Israel carved out the security zone when it withdrew the bulk of
its army from south Lebanon in the summer of 1985, three years after
it invaded its northern neighbor.
   The strip, which runs from the Mediterranean coast in the west to
the foothills of Mount Hermon in the east, is about six to 10 miles
deep. It serves as a buffer against border attacks.

   Kidnappers holding a wealthy landowner sent one of
the victim's ears to a Rome newspaper with a message purportedly
from the captive saying, ``Please pay, they're not joking.''
   The macabre package received Sunday night also included a
photograph showing 64-year-old Marzio Perrini with one of his ears
mutilated, police said.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said the ear was sent to scientists
for examination but that investigators had no doubts it came from
the kidnapping victim.
   The kidnappers who snatched Perrini on Dec. 28 from his estate
near Brindisi have reportedly demanded $7 million for his freedom.
   The cutting off of an ear is a technique used in the past by
Calabrian kidnapping gangs to show they mean business.
   In 1973, the kidnappers of J. Paul Getty III, grandson of the
late U.S. oil billionaire, cut off one of his ears and sent it to a
Rome newspaper. He was freed after a reported payment of $2.7
million.
   The newspaper Giornale D`Italia said an unidentified man called
the paper Sunday and told it to pick up a package containing a
letter from Perrini at a post office box.

   Alva Sole, a U.S. Airmail Service pioneer
who delivered mail to Franklin D. Roosevelt and was a friend of
World War I ace Eddie Rickenbacker, died Thursday at age 99.
   Sole was born in Wheeling, W.Va., and as a teen-ager went to work
shoveling coal on a train. He landed a job as a mail clerk on a
train and worked his way up to become head of the postal service's
Atlanta office in 1933.
   In air mail's infancy, Sole would swoop down, aim his
canvas-covered biplane at two posts on the ground, fly between them
and snatch a mail pouch from a wire stretched overhead before
climbing back into the air.
   Highlights of Sole's career included flying mail to Roosevelt at
Warm Springs, Ga., and taking Roosevelt's son Elliott on flights. He
flew planes with Will Rogers.

   Iranians today gathered at Bandar Abbas
Airport to remember 290 people killed one year ago when the U.S.
Navy shot down a civilian jet moments after it left the city, Tehran
Radio reported.
   The director of Civil Aviation announced that the airport, where
the ill-fated flight originated, had been renamed The International
Airport of the Tir 12 Martyrs, after the date of the incident.
   According to the lunar Persian calendar, Tir 12 last year
coincided with July 3, 1988, the day the USS Vincennes mistook Iran
Air Flight 655 for an Iranian fighter plane coming in for an attack
and shot it down.
   Newspaper editorials today called the incident ``a crime,'' or an
act of ``terrorism.''
   The jetliner was on a commercial flight from Bandar Abbas, where
a large air base is located, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
   The majority of passengers aboard the A300 Airbus were Iranians.
All 290 people aboard died.
   Relatives of the victims, clergymen, and air force and civil
aviation officials attended the airport ceremony, Tehran Radio said.
It did not provide a crowd estimate.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said the civil aviation
director, Mohammad Nabi Habibi, unveiled a painting depicting the
incident and displayed what he said were several parts of the
aircraft pulled from the Persian Gulf.
   ``The martyrs of this incident were another group of innocent
people who fell victims to American atrocities,'' he said.
   The daily Abrar, in an editorial carried by IRNA and monitored in
Nicosia, said: ``The Iranian nation will never forget U.S. crimes.''
   ``This has kindled a fire in the heart of the Iranian nation
which would not be extinguished without the elimination of U.S.
criminals,'' it said.
   The English-Language Kayhan International said the Iran Air
tragedy ``proved that Tehran's relations with Washington are
irreparable.''
   ``Those who feel the situation may change in the near future are
advised to go through the pictures of mutilated bodies of Iranians
on board the Airbus,'' it said in an editorial.
   More than 200 relatives of the Iran Air tragedy are suing
designers and manufacturers of the ship's radar system, a spokesman
for the group said Sunday in Abu Dhabi.
   Nagib Ghafoor, spokesman for the Flight 655 Litigation Group,
said the suit was filed June 28 in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco on behalf of relatives of 83 of the victims.
   Pentagon analysts have said that split-second decisions aboard
the Vincennes were affected by the inability of radar operators to
immediately match the plane's radar trace with digital direction,
altitude and speed information displayed on another screen.
   Ghafoor said the suit was filed against the General Electric Co.
``and other entities which designed and manufactured the radar
equipment on board the USS Vincennes.''
   Ghafoor said the complaint charged that the radar equipment
indicated the aircraft approaching the Vincennes was an F-14 diving
in an attack mode rather than the Iran Air flight, which was
climbing.
   He said claims against the United States on behalf of the
families ``are in the process of being filed as well.''
   GE is based in Fairfield, Conn. It refused comment Sunday, saying
it had not seen the suit.
   The Iranian government has been seeking a World Court verdict
against the United States and demanded financial compensation for
the dead. Washington has indicated it is willing to pay compensation
to victims' families but wants to be sure no money goes to the
Iranian government.

   Merchants are of two minds when asked
how they feel about having President Bush as a summer neighbor.
   His presence allows them to hawk dozens of Bush knickknacks,
ranging from photo opportunities with a life-sized Bush likeness to
Bush whiskey jiggers to Bush Christmas tree balls to bumperstickers
and T-shirts re-christening this tiny seaside town ``Kennebushport.''
   But some merchants worry the Bush presence will keep tourists
away. They blame news stories chronicling the circus atmosphere
surrounding the president, the Secret Service and the White House
press corps.
   ``It may be possible that some people have been scared away by
stories in the press, but we don't know that yet,'' said Susan M.
Savell, executive director of the Kennebunk-Kennebunkport Chamber of
Commerce.
   Ms. Savell said merchants won't be able to fully judge the impact
of the Bush factor until after the Independence Day weekend, which
the Bushes were spending at their home on Walkers Point.
   The town has vacancies, she said, but businesses were hoping
things will pick up as the season wears on.
   Bush has been visiting Kennebunkport since boyhood, but the new
security demands since he became president have prompted complaints
from local authorities. Last week, Democratic Rep. Joseph Brennan
introduced legislation seeking $160,000 a year for Kennebunk and
Kennebunkport police.
   Brennan said that local law enforcement officials are proud to
help provide security but that the responsibility ``has placed a
heavy financial burden on these departments, which are already
hard-pressed for funds.''
   On Saturday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
president wants to help and ``feels very strongly for
Kennebunkport'' but cannot spend federal funds on local government
without an act of Congress.
   At the tourist shop What's In Store, proprietor Jack Bigioni is
offering for sale all things Bush.
   ``I expected it to be a bang-up spring,'' Bigioni said.
``Unfortunately, a lot of the papers are writing that it's a mob
scene and there's lots of traffic and no parking, and I'm afraid
it's had an adverse effect.''
   Still, Bigioni sells quite a bit of Bush memorabilia, including
photographs of people posing by a likeness of the president and
house shoes that feature pinkish plastic caricatures of the
president and the first lady peering out from under red, white and
blue bedsheets. There's even a George Bush mask, billed as ``A
kinder, gentler coverup.''
   The Bush slippers have sold out twice, but the picture
opportunities are the best seller, even though an ordinance prevents
Bigioni from putting the Bush likeness on the sidewalk.
   Bigioni hopes to get Bush himself to come pose.
   ``It'd be a great picture,'' Bigioni said. ``Hopefully by the end
of the summer, he'll do it.''
   At the Kennebunk Book Port, books on Bush are popular. Before he
became president, Bush autographed 500 copies of his autobiography,
``Looking Forward,'' written with Victor Gold. The books sold out.
   Employee Julia Collins said Bush post cards also are a big seller.
   ``We probably sell more pictures of his house than pictures of
him,'' she said. ``Everyone knows what he looks like.''
   One tourist who definitely will keep coming is Bush. The
president plans to spend about two weeks of August and early
September at Walkers Point.
   Bush may not be buying much of the kitsch that bears his name,
but he did autograph a pair of the George and Barbara slippers for
Mabel Hanson, who has been serving fresh seafood and homemade
desserts for 20 years at Mabel's Lobster Claw. The Bushes, who are
regular customers, exploded into laughter when they saw the
slippers, Ms. Hanson said.
   ``They just broke up,'' she said. ``You could hear them laughing
downtown. She said, `George, my nose doesn't look like that.' He
said, `It does, too.'''

<TEXT>
   Director Franklin J. Schaffner, whose
1970 movie ``Patton'' won best picture and six other Oscars, has
died. He was 69.
   Schaffner, who during a four-decade career also directed such
popular films as ``Planet of the Apes'' and ``Papillon,'' died of
cancer Sunday at his Santa Monica home.
   He had just completed ``Welcome Home'' for Columbia Pictures,
said publicist Michael Roth.
   ``Patton'' star George C. Scott refused to accept the Oscar he
won for best actor for his portrayal of the World War II Gen. George
S. Patton, saying the awards demeaned the profession.
   But Schaffner, who won best director for the movie, said, ``I
will gladly accept any honors from the academy.''
   Films by Schaffner received 28 Academy Award nominations.
   He also was producer and past president of the Directors Guild of
America.
   His television career included more than 150 live CBS plays for
programs including ``Studio One'' and ``Ford Theatre.''
   He won Emmy awards for directing in 1954, 1955 and 1962, and
directed the first six episodes of ``The Defenders,'' a television
courtroom drama that began in 1961 and starred E.G. Marshall and
Robert Reed.
   Schaffner was born in Tokyo to Protestant missionaries. He was
raised in Lancaster, Pa., and graduated from Franklin &amp; Marshall
College in Pennsylvania.
   He had planned to study law, but joined the Navy during World War
II, serving four years as a lieutenant.
   As a news and public affairs director for CBS after the war, he
covered events that ranged from Brooklyn Dodgers baseball games in
1948 to the national election conventions of 1948 and 1952.
   He directed such TV series as ``Person To Person'' for Edward R.
Murrow and Jacqueline Kennedy's ``A Tour Of The White House.''
   Schaffner's first full-length film feature was ``The Stripper,''
released in 1962 and starring Gypsy Rose Lee and Joanne Woodward.
   His 1973 ``Papillon'' starred Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman;
the 1968 science fiction film ``Planet of the Apes,'' starred
Charlton Heston and Roddy McDowall. He also directed ``The Boys from
Brazil,'' 1978, with Gregory Peck.
   His other films included Gore Vidal's ``The Best Man,'' 1964,
starring Henry Fonda; ``The War Lord,'' 1965; ``The Double Man,''
1968; ``Nicholas And Alexandra,'' 1971; ``Islands In The Stream,''
1977; ``Sphinx,'' 1981; ``Yes, Giorgio,'' 1982; and ``Lionheart,''
in 1987.
   Schaffner is survived by his wife, Jean, two daughters and two
sisters.

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan rebels today rejected a
Palestine Liberation Organization plan for ending the country's
civil war and blasted the plan's architect, Yasser Arafat.
   Qaribur Rehman Saeed, director of the rebel-controlled Afghan
News Agency, said the PLO chief ``is not the person to mediate. He
has been supporting the Kabul government for 10 years.''
   Saeed said none of the seven rebel parties, based in Pakistan,
supports Arafat's plan, which calls for a cease-fire and talks
between the U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas and President Najib's
government. The talks would be followed by elections.
   ``The mujahedeen don't want to talk to Najib, and they don't like
Arafat,'' said Saeed. Afghan guerrillas call themselves mujahedeen
or Islamic holy warriors.
   Arafat is reportedly going to the Afghan capital on Thursday to
speak with Najib.
   The guerrillas have been fighting to oust Afghanistan's
pro-Soviet government for 11 years. The Soviet army fought alongside
Afghan troops for nine years but pulled the last of its soldiers out
of the country in February in accordance with a U.N.-mediated accord.
   The guerrillas have refused to deal with Najib.
   The Afghan government said Sunday that rebels are mobilizing
fighters around Kabul and may be planning an assault on the Afghan
capital. The military was placed on maximum alert in and around the
city.
   ``We are watching the situation very closely. We will wait until
the last moment. If they try to mount a military assault, we will
give them a befitting reply,'' said Lt. Gen. Abdul Haq Olumi, the
top military man in the ruling People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan.
   Olumi refused to give details of the reported mobilization. ``We
will tell you after we win the battle,'' said the 49-year-old
general.
   ``We do not want bloodshed,'' Olumi said. ``We want to fight for
peace now.'' But he said soldiers would ``fight to their last blood
and sweat'' to defeat the guerrillas.
   Olumi also claimed that 15,000 guerrillas had been killed in
fighting since the Soviet Union withdrawal was completed. It was the
first time since February the government released rebel casualty
figures.

<HEAD>Witness Support Defendant's Alibi In Palme Murder Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A witness today testified he saw the man
charged with killing Prime Minister Olaf Palme at a train station
around the time Palme was shot outside a movie theater.
   Algot Asell, 68, was the first witness in the trial to support
the alibi of the defendant, Christer Pettersson. Pettersson denies
killing Palme.
   The prosecution said it would call witnesses to cast doubt on
Asell's credibility.
   Asell said he saw Pettersson waiting for a train at the Marsta
station between 11 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. on Feb. 28, 1986. Palme, a
four-term prime minister, was fatally shot at 11:21 that night while
walking home with his wife from a movie.
   The train station is about 18 miles from the crime scene and more
than 30 minutes by train.
   Other witnesses have testified they saw Pettersson waiting for
Palme outside the movie theater and following him down the street.
Mrs. Palme identified Pettersson as the man she saw a few feet away
just after her husband was shot.
   Asell said he did not notice the exact time when he saw
Pettersson, but he said he bought a chocolate bar near the train
station just before the store closed at 9:30 p.m., then went into a
nearby restaurant until one of the last trains left the station at
11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m.
   Asell said he remembered the night because it was the first time
in many years he had been in Marsta.
   Assell knew Pettersson from the time they lived in the same
neighborhood, and he once helped a security guard break up a fight
in which Pettersson was involved.
   Also today, a man who shared an apartment with Pettersson for
seven months, Ulf Akansson, said Pettersson was an admirer of Palme
and that Palme never carried a gun.

<HEAD>Jerusalem May Says Arabs of Jerusalem Should Vote in Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Teddy Kollek says the 140,000 Arabs in
Jerusalem should participate in any elections held to choose
Palestinians to negotiate the future of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``We must accept that the Arabs of east Jerusalem see themselves
as Palestinians,'' Kollek was quoted as saying over the weekend by
his spokeswoman, Bonnie Boxer.
   A showdown over the election issue is expected Wednesday in the
right-wing Likud bloc. Party rebels have said they will force Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir to amend his election plan to exclude Arabs
in east Jerusalem from voting.
   Under Shamir's plan, the vote would be followed by negotiations
between the Palestinians elected and Israeli officials on the future
of the occupied territories. However, the plan rules out creation of
an independent Palestinian state.
   ``I think the anger and hostility we would provoke by denying
Jerusalem Arabs the opportunity to participate in the proposed
elections is far more ominous than any supposed danger from their
joining a democratic process,'' Kollek, 78, a member of the
left-leaning Labor Party, was quoted as saying.
   But right-wingers say Israel would weaken its claim to
sovereignty over all of the city by allowing participation of
residents of the eastern sector of Jerusalem, which was captured
from Jordan in the 1967 war.
   Most residents of east Jerusalem have Jordanian citizenship but
are permanent residents of Israel and carry Israeli identity cards.
They are allowed to vote in city elections but not national
balloting in Israel.
   ``What the Israeli government is proposing now is elections to
choose Palestinian Arab leaders to negotiate with Israel on the
shaping of the Palestinian future,'' said Kollek.
   ``The Arabs of Jerusalem clearly deserve the opportunity to share
in the decison-making process. This is no way prejudices Israel
sovereignty in united Jerusalem,'' he said.

   Flood waters kept hundreds from their homes today in three
Southern states, and a storm packing 90 mph wind raced across Texas,
uprooting trees and chasing Shakespearean actors from an outdoor
stage in Dallas moments before it collapsed.
   The storm system developed in Okalahoma, bolted across Texas and
moved into Louisiana and Mississippi early today, blowing down power
lines, spinning off tornadoes and causing lightning-sparked fires.
   Power outages affected 100,000 customers in the Dallas-Fort Worth
area alone, and at least 30,000 were still without power this
morning.
   ``This is the worst storm damage in Dallas since the 1979 ice
storm,'' said Dick Ramsey, a spokesman for Texas Utilities.
   In Minnesota and South Dakota, thunderstorms developing ahead of
a cold front Sunday night produced severe weather, including
tornadoes.
   At Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, Texas, a concert billed as
the Event of the Decade ended in chaos as the storm dumped heavy
rain and hail on thousands of spectators.
   ``It turned this place from a dust bowl into a mud bowl,'' said
Sgt. Bob Matson. ``The hail was marble-sized for 20 minutes. It
didn't matter where you were, there was no protection.''
   Texas, Louisiana and their neighbors have endured over a week of
heavy rain left by Tropical Storm Allison. One Louisiana town got
nearly 29 inches in less than a week.
   Flooding kept at least 500 people from their homes in southeast
Texas and 200 in Mississippi. About 700 homes in Louisiana remained
flooded and the weather service said the flooding could ontinue for
two weeks.
   Allison and its aftermath were blamed for four deaths in Texas
and three in Louisiana. The body of a Mississippi teen-ager who had
gone swimming in a swollen creek was recovered Sunday near Natchez.
Officials today searched for a missing companion.
   Sunday night's storm was not related to Allison, said Hugh
Crowther of the National Weather Service in Kansas City, Mo. The
remnants of Allison moved into Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio.
   Today's forecast was for scattered showers and thunderstorms in
Texas, with heavier showers and thunderstorms in Louisiana and
Mississippi, Crowther said.
   In Oklahoma City, a house caught fire Sunday after it was struck
by lightning, causing $65,000 damage. High winds blew over a mobile
home in Ponca City, Okla., and downed some power lines and trees.
   When the storm reached Abilene, concert-goers were still waiting
to hear the headliners, Alabama and the Charlie Daniels Band. But
officials canceled the concert when the storm hit.
   Several people were taken to the hospital, for hail injuries and
because of the heat, but officials said the injuries were minor.
   John Val Lynch of Sweetwater, Texas, said he felt shortchanged,
pointing out the tickets had read ``come rain or shine.''
   ``We just got ripped off,'' he said. ``I spent about $100, and I
don't see anybody giving me my money back.''
   Maj. Mary Beth Kilgore said the performers didn't want to risk
damaging their instruments or equipment. She said Alabama would
honor the tickets at the group's Wichita Falls concert on July 4 or
refunds would be offered.
   East of Abilene, a performance at the Shakespeare Festival of
Dallas came to an abrupt end as officials evacuated 1,000 patrons
minutes before the stage collapsed under 90 mph winds. No one was
injured.
   Steve Player, of the festival's board of directors, said
performers had just started ``Two Men of Verona-Texas,'' a jazzed-up
version of Shakespeare's play, when the storm moved in.
   About 30 trees were uprooted and the 40-foot scaffolding holding
lighting and sound equipment wilted under the winds. Cast and crew
huddled backstage as the set collapsed around them.
   ``We're very thankful we got the patrons out,'' Player said.
``We're lucky we just got soaked.''
   Near-record flooding in Liberty, 45 miles northeast of Houston,
kept about 500 residents out of their homes and further threatened
low-lying areas, even though sunny skies prevailed in southeast
Texas on Sunday.
   Soggy residents of lowlands along the Trinity River should see
the high waters subside later this week, emergency officials said.
   In Mississippi's Bolivar County, more than 100 homes were flooded
Saturday when the area received 5.3 inches of rain. People were
traveling in canoes in parts of Cleveland, said Joe Springer, a
resident of the Mississippi town.
   ``I've been sitting ... with my grandchildren and as far as I can
see it's water on the street both east and west,'' he said. ``You've
never seen so many kids out using the streets for a swimming pool.''
   Officials in northern and central Louisiana reported at least
three tornadoes. A home in Alexandria was damaged and business
destroyed in Deville.
   Rising water chewed away at an earthen dam in Louisiana's Winn
Parish, but civil defense director Steve Robertson today said
officials believed the levee would hold.
   A dam break could flood several more homes and delay drainage of
others, Robertson said.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that some
government-sponsored religious displays are permissible as long as
they do not have ``the effect of promoting or endorsing religious
beliefs.''
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said displaying a Christmas nativity
scene inside the Allegheny County Courthouse in Pittsburgh violates
constitutionally required separation of church and state because it
appears to endorse Christian principles.
   But the court unanimously permitted a Hanukkah menorah on the
front steps of the city-county building in Pittsburgh because that
display also included a Christmas tree and a sing saluting liberty.
   The ruling came on the final day of this court session along with
a long-awaiting ruling on the controversial abortion issue. In the
abortion case, the justices gave states far greater power to limit
abortions, but stopped short of reversing its 1973 decision
legalizing abortion.
   The court said the menorah, a nine-candle candelabra used during
the celebration of the Jewish holiday Hanukkah, does not appear to
endorse Judaism because of its ``particular physical setting.''
   The menorah display includes a Christmas tree and a sign saluting
liberty. The court said the inclusion of the tree and sign give the
overall display a secular purpose, the court said.
   The court said the menorah, a nine-candle candelabra used during
the celebration of the Jewish holiday Hanukkah, does not appear to
endorse Judaism because of its ``particular physical setting.''
   The menorah display includes a Christmas tree and a sign saluting
liberty. The court said the inclusion of the tree and sign give the
overall display a secular purpose, the court said.
   While the justices were split sharply in declaring the Nativity
scene unconstitutional, the court substantially upheld its long-used
test for determining when the wall between church and state is
breached.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for the court and was joined in
striking down the Nativity scene by Justices William J. Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall, John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, participating in his first
church-state case since joining the court in 1988, dissented in
voting to permit the Nativity scene.
   The other dissenters were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia.
   Blackmun said the Nativity scene, or creche, violates the
Constitution because ``nothing in the contest of the display
detracts from the creche's religious message.''
   That message, Blackmun said, is spelled out unmistakably in the
display.
   ```Glory to God in the Highest!' says the angel in the creche _
glory to God because of the birth of Jesus,'' he said. ``This praise
to God in Christian terms is indisputably religious _ indeed
sectarian.''
   By contrast, he said display containing the menorah includes
symbols that support the nation's pluralist tradition.
   ``The city's overall display must be understood as conveying the
city's secular recognition of different traditions for celebrating
the winter holiday season,'' he said.

   Four Afghan air force officers flew a

asylum for their crew, the Defense Ministry said.
   A ministry spokesman said three majors and a captain were among
the crew. He did not give the number of defectors and said he had
few other details.
   The helicopter crossed the border and landed near the border city
of Chaman, 60 miles west of Quetta, in Pakistan's southwestern

aircraft.
   Pakistan is headquarters for Moslem guerrillas fighting the

   The Supreme Court ruled today that some
government-sponsored religious displays are permissible as long as
they do not have ``the effect of promoting or endorsing religious
beliefs.''
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said displaying a Christmas nativity
scene inside the Allegheny County Courthouse in Pittsburgh violates
constitutionally required separation of church and state because it
appears to endorse Christian principles.
   But the court unanimously permitted a Hanukkah menorah on the
front steps of the city-county building in Pittsburgh because that
display also included a Christmas tree and a sing saluting liberty.
   The ruling came on the final day of this court session along with
a long-awaiting ruling on the controversial abortion issue. In the
abortion case, the justices gave states far greater power to limit
abortions, but stopped short of reversing its 1973 decision
legalizing abortion.
   The court said the menorah, a nine-candle candelabra used during
the celebration of the Jewish holiday Hanukkah, does not appear to
endorse Judaism because of its ``particular physical setting.''
   The menorah display includes a Christmas tree and a sign saluting
liberty. The court said the inclusion of the tree and sign give the
overall display a secular purpose, the court said.
   While the justices were split sharply in declaring the Nativity
scene unconstitutional, the court substantially upheld its long-used
test for determining when the wall between church and state is
breached.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for the court and was joined in
striking down the Nativity scene by Justices William J. Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall, John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, participating in his first
church-state case since joining the court in 1988, dissented in
voting to permit the Nativity scene.
   The other dissenters were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia.
   Blackmun said the Nativity scene, or creche, violates the
Constitution because ``nothing in the contest of the display
detracts from the creche's religious message.''
   That message, Blackmun said, is spelled out unmistakably in the
display.
   ```Glory to God in the Highest!' says the angel in the creche _
glory to God because of the birth of Jesus,'' he said. ``This praise
to God in Christian terms is indisputably religious _ indeed
sectarian.''
   By contrast, he said display containing the menorah includes
symbols that support the nation's pluralist tradition.
   ``The city's overall display must be understood as conveying the
city's secular recognition of different traditions for celebrating
the winter holiday season,'' he said.
   Kennedy said the court, in barring goverment sponsorship of the
creche, showed ``an unjustified hostility toward religion, a
hostility inconsistent with our history and our precedents.''
   Today's ruling relied heavily on a 1984 decision in which the
court upheld the constitutionality of a creche in Pawtucket, R.I.
   The creche at issue there was surrounded by secular symbols such
as Santa Claus, reindeer and snowmen.
   The Pittsburgh creche was displayed by itself.
   Justice Department lawyers had urged the justices to allow the
Pittsburgh displays, contending, ``Since the use of the creche as a
symbol of the holiday does not constitute a government endorsement
of the religious content of that symbol, the government is not
required to surround it with candy canes, reindeer or other purely
secular symbols.''

<HEAD>Court Decision Blueprint for Controversy in State Legislatures</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court decision today giving states
expanded authority to restrict abortions is a blueprint for
controversy in the 50 state legislatures and in hundreds of
political races for years to come.
   Even before the ruling was handed down, anti-abortion crusaders
said they were ready to pressure state legislatures to tighten
restrictions on abortion.
   The court's decision gave them plenty to work with _ so much so
that moments after the justices had ruled, one key pro-choice
advocate, Molly Yard of the National Organization for Women, said,
``It chips away ... This is war against women.''
   In its ruling, the court stopped short of overturning a
16-year-old case that established a woman's right to an abortion.
But in a ruling in a Missouri case, it said states can take a number
of steps to restrict abortions, particularly in cases where they are
not needed to save life.
   More than a dozen states have laws on the books to restrict and
even outlaw abortions, designed to take effect if the court
overturned the 1973 ruling.
   However enforceable they are, they provide an early look at the
direction that some legislatures are likely to take following the
court's ruling _ and demonstrate the difficulty of the job
confronting NOW and other pro-choice groups.
   Sarah Weddington, a Texas lawyer who successfully argued the 1973
case, predicted ``a tremendous surge of legislative activity'' and
said the new ruling could lead to ``abortion being almost, if not
actually, illegal in at least some states and maybe many of the
states.''
   The court also said it would review two more abortion cases next
term, meaning that the political struggle about to ensue will take
place on terms that could shift again before the year is out.
   Unde this cloud of uncertainty, abortion-rights groups are vowing
to make their issue a litmus test for candidates for state
legislatures.
   Their premise: If you can't trust the high court to protect your
right to abortion, at least you can vote for state and local
officials who will.
   ``We intend to make this a decisive issue for the public's voting
decisions in 1989 and 1990,'' says Kate Michelman, executive
director of the National Abortion Rights Action League. ``The
pro-choice sleeping giant is awakening.''
   But the pro-choice leaders will face anti-abortion advocates
whose hand has been strengthened by the court.
   ``I've always said that if the court overturns (the 1973 ruling)
on Tuesday we'd introduce legislation on Wednesday to outlaw
abortions,'' says Pennsylvania lawmaker Stephen Freind.
   Public opinion polls on abortion have found virtually no shift in
attitudes over the years. More than three-quarters of Americans have
said since 1975 that abortion should be legal under all or certain
circumstances; for the past decade some 60 percent have said they
approve of legal abortion if a woman and her doctor agree to it.
   But intense debate has continued in state legislatures, resulting
in a welter of varying statutes and a sizable contingent of
lawmakers who looked with dread at the idea of refueling the
abortion debate at the state level.
   NARAL estimates more than 250 abortion-related bills have been
introduced in state legislatures since 1988. State lawmakers of both
parties have used terms like ``nightmare'' and ``gridlock'' to
describe the prospect of even greater state control over abortions.
   Nearly three dozen states have laws requiring parental consent
for abortions for minor women, parental notification or both, and
all but a dozen have cut off Medicaid financing of abortions for
poor women.
   But, as one state legislator put it, the states were not playing
with ``real bullets.'' The court decision expanding state authority
is expected to make the controversy over restrictions like parental
consent pale beside the battles to come.

<HEAD>Cries of Triumph, Groans of Anguish After Abortion Decision</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   On the steamy marble plaza facing the Supreme
Court today, there were cries of triumph, groans of anguish.
   But for once those favoring abortion and those fervently against
it appeared to agree.
   The Supreme Court had just given the pro-life movement a major
boost.
   ``I think it's a serious setback for us,'' said former
congresswoman Bella Abzug, a pro-abortion advocate.
   ``This is a creeping invasion, a creeping invasion of women's
rights, that's what it is,'' she said.
   ``It was a major victory for the pro-life movement,'' said Tom
Glessner, executive director of the Christian Action Council.
   The moment of decision, shortly after 10 a.m., brought a
momentary silence to the plaza, a momentary quieting of the
competitive chanting.
   Men and women in dark suits feverishly turned the pages of the
court's decision in ``William Webster, Attorney General of Missouri,
et al vs. Reproductive Health Services et al.''
   ``I'm not clear what happened, exactly,'' said a young woman in
purple shorts.
   ``I'm trying to figure this out,'' said a young man. ``I want to
read it in the paper tomorrow.''
   But then the approximate meaning of the decision, giving states
more power to limit abortion rights but stopping short of
overturning the landmark Roe vs. Wade pro-abortion decision, began
to take hold.
   The chanting began again.
   ``Not the courts, not the states, women will decide our fate,''
shouted the group of 50 or so pro-abortion demonstrators on the
broad sidewalk facing the court's Roman-temple facade.
   ``Ah, too bad,'' a teen-ager gloated. ``You guys lost.''
   ``What does this mean?'' someone asked Molly Yard, president of
the National Organization for Women.
   ``It means if you've got money you can get an abortion,'' she
said. ``If you're poor, too bad, you're down the drain.''
   ``What do you do now?''
   ``There are lots of things we can do,'' she said as she marched
through a forest of microphones and television cameras. ``We're
going to mobilize all over the country.''
   The Pro- and anti-abortion demonstrators _ they numbered about
200 _ tried unsuccessfully to drown each other out.
   ``Hey, hey, ho, ho, Roe vs. Wade has got to go.''
   ``One, two, three, four, abortion rights for rich and poor. Five,
six, seven, eight, separation church and state.''
   A bearded man, wearing the brown robe of a Catholic friar, knelt
on the sidewalk, fingering the beads of a long rosary. A sign held
above his head read, ``The baby had no choice.''
   To his left, a competing sign: ``Keep abortion legal.''
   Across the plaza, organizers of both groups _ pro-life and
pro-choice _ talked about next time.
   More abortion cases will be argued before the court this fall and
both sides said they saw opportunity and hope in that.

   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, participating in his first

   WASHINGTON: secular symbols.
   Lower courts across the nation have been confused about just
where the 1984 ruling drew the line between permissible governmental
acknowledgment of religious heritages and the unconstitutional
promotion or advancement of religion.
   Most lower courts have treated the 1984 decision as a narrow one,
and have disallowed various religious displays deemed too religious.
   Blackmun acknowledged today that the 1984 ruling is ``none too
clear.'' But he said today's ruling may help dispel the confusion.
   He said these are the guiding principles: ``The government's use
of religious symbolism is unconstitutional if it has the effect of
endorsing religious beliefs, and the effect of the government's use
of religious symoblism depends upon its context.''
   In Pittsburgh, from 1981 to 1987, a 9-foot-wide creche depicting
the birth of Jesus Christ was displayed inside the county courthouse
in the city for about six weeks during the Christmas season.
   A block away, an 18-foot menorah was displayed each year from
1982 to 1987 on the front steps of the building that houses city and
county offices. It stood next to a 45-foot Christmas tree.
   A federal judge refused to order the dismantling of the displays
in late 1987, but the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, by a
2-1 vote, that they were unlawful. That ruling prevented the
displays being shown last Christmas season.
   The creche is owned by the Holy Name Society, a Roman Catholic
men's group that arranges for its display. The menorah is owned by
Chabad, a small Jewish sect that loaned the symbol to the city free
of charge.
   The legal controversy began when the American Civil Liberties
Union asked for removal of the creche and menorah in 1986. The
request was denied.
   The ACLU, several lawyers who conduct business at the courthouse,
a Unitarian minister and a Moslem then sued, seeking to block the
displays.

   A fire that damaged an abortion clinic hours
before today's U.S. Supreme Court abortion decision was arson, a
fire department official said.
   ``The case was incendiary, meaning it was intentionally set,''
said Capt. Jack Davis.
   Davis released no further details about the cause of the 2 a.m.
fire at the Feminist Health Center, but he said police were
investigating.
   The fire occurred at 2 a.m., eight hours before the U.S. Supreme
Court released a long-awaited ruling in a Missouri case
significantly curtailing the right of women to get legal abortions.
   ``The department is fully aware of the politics surrounding the
Feminist Health Center and the abortion issue,'' fire Capt. Scott
Chase said before the arson determination was confirmed.
   The fire, confined to a bookcase in one room in the unoccupied
building, was put out with a portable extinguisher, Chase said.
   The clinic had been a frequent target of picketing by abortion
protesters.

   Leftist guerrillas today opened
fire with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades on a
military guard post. One attacker was killed in the fighting.
   Mauricio Gutierrez Castro, the new chief justice of the Supreme
Court, said he was also slightly injured in a rebel attack Sunday
evening as he was driving back from a nearby beach with his family.
   The body of a slain guerrilla was seen lying on the road near
where the 30-minute gun battle took place at dawn. The rebel
appeared to be the only casualty of the fighting.
   No government troops here hurt, the armed forces press office
said in a news release. The military post guards the entrance of a
San Salvador residential neighborhood where many army officers live.
   Appearing on a television news show early today, Gutierrez said
his car and a second vehicle with bodyguards were caught at a
roadblock the guerrillas had set about 10 miles south of San
Salvador.
   The bodyguards in the second vehicle opened fire when they saw
the road blocked by a parked bus, and the guerrillas waiting in
ambush fired back. One bodyguard was killed and another wounded,
Gutierrez said.
   Gutierrez said his driver made a quick U-turn and drove away from
the fighting. One bullet scraped the back of the justice's neck.
   ``I don't think it was an attack on me personally,'' Gutierrez
said, adding that the rebels ``had no way of knowing I would be
travelling on that road.''
   Gutierrez, a conservative, was named chief justice June 27,
shortly after the new administration of President Alfreo Cristiani
took office.

   More than 90 Vietnamese boat people
picked up by two U.S Navy warships were transferred to refugee camps
in Thailand today, a Thai official said.
   In another rescue, a U.S.-registered tanker picked up 133
Vietnamese refugees drifting Sunday in a wooden boat in the South
China Sea off Vietnam, Japan's coast guard said. The tanker Aries is
expected to drop off the refugees in Japan on Thursday, it said.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Bangkok said the 92 Vietnamese
boarded the cruiser Reeves and the destroyer Fife about 370 miles
east of Vietnam on Thursday, when the warships were headed for a
routine stop in Thailand.
   The U.S. vessels decided to pick up the Vietnamese after judging
that the refugees' two vessels lacked sufficient food, water and
navigational equipment to continue their voyage, embassy spokesman
Neil Klopfenstein said.
   Praphakorn Smiti, head of the Operations Center for Displaced
Persons in Thailand, said the boat people were interviewed and
allowed ashore today.
   They were taken to Ban Thad, he said. It is a refugee camp 60
miles east of Bangkok run by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
   At the camp, the Vietnamese will be screened to assess whether
are fleeing political persecution or seeking better living
conditions, Praphakorn said.
   Thailand and other Asian nations swamped by an unrelenting influx
of Vietnamese refugees want to repatriate those who are not
political refugees. But Vietnam has said it will not accept back
people who flee their impoverished country to seek better lifestyles.
   Between January and May, according to U.N. figures, 1,429
Vietnamese boat people arrived in Thailand. As of May 31, there were
13,470 Vietnamese in camps in Thailand, of whom 11,068 arrived by
boat. Many of the refugees want to settle in the United States.

which the court said produced an overall secular purpose.
   The ruling came on the final day of this court session along with
a long-awaiting decision on the controversial abortion issue. In the
abortion case, the justices gave states far greater power to limit
abortions, but stopped short of reversing its 1973 decision
legalizing abortion.
   In other actions, the court:
   _Ordered a battle over state taxing powers reargued on broader
issues when its next term begins in October. Related cases from
Arkansas and Florida raise the issue of whether a business that
successfully challenges a state tax as a burden on interstate
commerce is entitled to a refund of previously paid taxes.
   The court said the menorah, a nine-branched candelabra used
during the celebration of the Jewish holiday Hanukkah, does not
appear to endorse Judaism because of its ``particular physical
setting.''
   The inclusion of the Christmas tree and sign saluting liberty
give the overall display a secular purpose, the court said.
   While the justices were split sharply in declaring the Nativity
scene unconstitutional, the court substantially upheld its long-used
test for determining when the wall between church and state is
breached.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for the court and was joined in

Thurgood Marshall, John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, participating in his first
church-state case since joining the court in 1988, dissented in
voting to permit the Nativity scene.
   The other dissenters were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia.
   ``Thank God for the Supreme Court,'' said Charles Saul, a
Pittsburgh attorney representing a Jewish group which owned the
menorah. ``The court is saying that when you put a menorah and a
Christmas tree and these kinds of things together, that all faiths
are welcome. And that the government is not endorsing one particular
religion.''
   Blackmun said the Nativity scene, or creche, violates the
Constitution because ``nothing in the context of the display
detracts from the creche's religious message.''
   That message, Blackmun said, is spelled out unmistakably in the
display.
   ```Glory to God in the Highest!' says the angel in the creche _
glory to God because of the birth of Jesus,'' he said. ``This praise
to God in Christian terms is indisputably religious _ indeed
sectarian.''
   By contrast, he said display containing the menorah includes
symbols that support the nation's pluralist tradition.
   ``The city's overall display must be understood as conveying the
city's secular recognition of different traditions for celebrating
the winter holiday season,'' he said.
   Kennedy said the court, in barring goverment sponsorship of the
creche, showed ``an unjustified hostility toward religion, a
hostility inconsistent with our history and our precedents.''
   Today's ruling relied heavily on a 1984 decision in which the
court upheld the constitutionality of a creche in Pawtucket, R.I.
   The creche at issue there was surrounded by secular symbols such
as Santa Claus, reindeer and snowmen.
   The Pittsburgh creche was displayed by itself.
   Justice Department lawyers had urged the justices to allow the

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today ordered reargument in
its next term of an important battle over state taxing powers.
   The justices will hear arguments over related cases from Arkansas
and Florida when they return to the bench in October for their
1989-90 term.
   Rulings in the two cases are likely sometime next year.
   At issue is whether a business that successfully challenges a
state tax as an undue burden on interstate commerce is entitled to
be refunded money it paid before the tax was invalidated.
   The court announced today that it will broaden its inquiry next
term. The court said it also will consider whether a state _ rather
than refund tax revenues to those hurt by discriminatory levies _
may retroactively raise taxes of those who benefited from the
discrimination.
   In the Arkansas case, trucking companies are seeking $160 million
in tax refunds after the state Supreme Court declared the state's
mileage-based tax on trucks unconstitutional.
   The state court based its ruling on a 1987 ruling by the nation's
highest court that struck down a similar tax in Pennsylvania.
   The Arkansas court ordered state officials to pay $4.9 million in
refunds from a special escrow account created in the summer of 1987.
But the state court said the trucking companies are not entitled to
additional refunds on taxes the state collected before the escrow
account was created.
   In the Florida case, a state tax that granted an exemption to
in-state liquor dealers was struck down. Out-of-state dealers then
sought refunds on the money they had paid under the tax.

   The attorney who successfully argued the Roe vs.
Wade case said she was disappointed by the Supreme Court's ruling
today that gives states greater power to limit abortions.
   The new ruling ``could eventually lead to abortion being almost,
if not actually, illegal in at least some states and maybe many of
the states,'' said Sarah Weddington, reached by telephone shortly
after the court's decision was announced.
   ``I've invested 20 years of my life in this and now have been
handed a major defeat,'' she said.
   Ms. Weddington represented Norma McCorvey, a Dallas woman who
took the pseudonym Jane Roe, in the landmark 1973 abortion case
establishing women's constitutional right to abortions.
   The court today, in a series of mostly 5-4 votes, restored
several Missouri abortion regulations that a lower court had
invalidated for unduly interfering with women's constitutional right
to abortion.
   She predicted the decision will not immediately affect women
seeking abortions ``until state legislatures pass new laws.''
   But the Austin, Texas, attorney said the decision signals a
``major change in direction'' for the court.
   ``Roe vs. Wade basically said that there is a right of privacy in
the Constitution that allows women to make certain choices for
themselves and one of those was the choice of whether to continue or
terminate a pregnancy,'' she said.
   ``While the Supreme Court did not say there is no right of
privacy, they didn't say `we think there is' or `we think there
isn't.' What they said was, `We're going to allow the states to
regulate in major ways.'''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Agrees To Review Law In Omaha Religion Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to review a 1984
federal law requiring that student religious groups be given the
same access as other extra-curricular clubs to public high school
facilities.
   The justices, setting the stage for an important ruling on
church-state relations, said they will decide whether a student
Bible study group must be allowed to meet at an Omaha, Neb., high
school after class hours.
   The court will hear an appeal by school officials who say giving
such access to the club violates the constitutionally required
separation of church and state.
   A decision is expected sometime in 1990.
   Students at Westside High School sought in 1985 to organize a
Christian Bible study club. Officials refused to approve the club,
suggesting the students meet instead at a church next door.
   A federal judge ruled in favor of the school officials. But the
8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision in
February, saying the club must be allowed to meet on school premises.
   The appeals court noted that the high school has let some 30
other extra-curricular groups, such as a chess club and a scuba
diving club, meet on school grounds after class hours under a
faculty member's supervision.
   Congress in 1984 passed the Equal Access Act barring public high
schools that accept federal aid from discriminating against groups
based on ``the religious, political, philosophical or other content
of the speech at such meetings.''
   The law is designed to force schools to give the same privileges
to religious clubs as other ``non-curriculum-related student
groups.''
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1981 that state-run universities
cannot ban student groups from using campus facilities for religious
worship and study.
   But the justices have not decided whether the same rule should
apply to high schools.
   They examined the issue in 1986 in a Pennsylvania case but,
because of a procedural flaw, did not answer the question.
   At that time, four court members said they would let high school
students conduct such meetings. Two of those _ former Chief Justice
Warren E. Burger and Justice Lewis F. Powell _ no longer sit on the
court. The two others were now-Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
and Justice Byron R. White.
   Justice Department lawyers in the former Reagan administration,
which also protested the court's ban on organized prayer in public
schools, had pressed for permitting student Bible study and worship
meetings.
   The Bush administration has not stated its position on the
Nebraska case acted on today.
   The 8th Circuit court rejected the contention that high school
students are more impressionable than college students and therefore
should be given more protection from student religious groups that
may appear to be sanctioned by school authorities.
   ``We reject this notion because Congress considered the
difference in the maturity level of secondary students and
university students before passing the Equal Access Act,'' the
appeals court said. ``We accept Congress' fact-finding.''
   Besides Nebraska, the 8th Circuit court ruling set a binding
precedent in Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, North and South
Dakota.
   The case is Westside Community Schools vs. Mergens, 88-1597.

<HEAD>Blackmun Says Signs Evident Court Will Move to Overturn Roe Vs. Wade</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, author of the 1973
Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, said in a strongly
worded dissent today that ``signs are evident and very ominous''
that the court will move to reverse a woman's right to abortion.
   Blackmun said that with its decision today, the court was
inviting further challenges to its landmark Roe vs. Wade decision.
   He criticized the court majority for not acknowledging this.
   ``The silence is callous. It is also profoundly disruptive of
this court as an institution,'' he said from the bench.
   He said that with its decision, the court was inviting ``charges
of cowardice and illegitimacy.''
   Blackmun said that overturning the Roe vs. Wade decision would
cast ``in darkness the hope of every woman in this country.''
   ``For today, at least, the law of abortion stands undisturbed,''
Blackmun said. ``For today, the women of this nation will retain the
liberty to control their destinies. But the signs are evident and
very ominous, and a chill wind blows.''
   He predicted that reversal of Roe vs. Wade would force hundreds
of thousands of women each year to ``defy the law and place their
health and safety in the unclean and unsympathetic hands of
back-alley abortionists. Or they would attempt to perform abortions
upon themselves with disastrous results.
   ``Every year, many women, especially poor and minority women,
would die or suffer debilitating trauma, all in the name of enforced
morality or religious dictates or lack of compassion as it may be.''
   As Blackmun read his remarks, Justice Thurgood Marshall watched
intently. But the five other justices did not look at him. Justices
Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy were not on the bench.
   Although his words were strong, Blackmun at no time raised his
voice or showed any signs of overflowing passion.

   Legislators approved a new law allowing
opposition political parties, a move that will end the one-party
rule existing in this North African state since its independence in
1962.
   Today's newspapers reported 40 groups intend to form parties to
challenge the political dominance of President Chadli Bendjedid's
National Liberation Front, which has ruled Algeria since the country
won independence from France.
   The vote came Sunday after deputies considered 34 amendments to
the bill. It is the latest progression since widespread rioting in
October left 170 people dead and led to calls for reform.
   In a series of referendums since November, Algeria's 13 million
voters have backed sweeping political changes proposed by Bendjedid,
who was elected to a third five-year term in December.
   The first multicandidate balloting will be in municipal elections
in December.
   According to the bill, groups wanting to form political parties
now can apply to the Interior Ministry, which has two months to give
a reply.
   The state will contribute to each political party in proportion
to its membership in Parliament. Parties are not allowed to accept
financial or material support.
   The new law forbids members of the military, policemen,
magistrates or members of the Constitutional Council from belonging
to political movements.
   It also does not allow the formation of parties based on
regional, linguistic, racial or religious grounds. Some deputies
felt that article was aimed at Algeria's Berber minority or Islamic
fundamentalists in this country, one of the more liberal Arab states.
   As ruling party deputies debated the bill, several hundred
people, many of them women, demonstrated peacefully in front of
Parliament building, calling for respect for women's rights and
equality before the law.
   In February, Algerians approved a new constitution which made no
mention of the socialist policy underpinning the previous 1976
constitution drawn up by President Houari Boumedienne, who ruled
Algeria from 1965-78.
   This month, Parliament also is to consider reforms on laws
governing freedom of expression and the electoral code.

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers in several states today predicted fierce legislative
battles as anti-abortion activists seek laws based on the U.S.
Supreme Court's ruling legalizing new restrictions on abortion.
   In Alabama, Republican state Rep. Greg Beers promised prompt
legislation to impose limits on abortion. In coming months, he said,
``I believe you'll see every state in America introducing
legislation like this.''
   Pennsylvania's leading abortion foe, Rep. Stephen Freind, said
that while the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion was
still partially in place, ``they've tremendously chipped away at it.
   ``We can go a hell of a lot further in restricting abortions as
long as there is a rational basis for doing so,'' Freind said.
   ``It does throw it back in our laps,'' said Rep. Richard M.
Dillinger, an Indiana Republican. But he said the outcome was
unclear: ``I don't know about the sentiment of this Legislature.
Nothing's been done on abortion recently.''
   Florida House Speaker Tom Gustafson said before the ruling that
he would call for a special session of the Legislature if the court
authorized new restrictions on abortion. Otherwise, he said, the
issue would overshadow other work of the regular session.
   ``The battle is now going to go to the state Legislature,''
declared Eric Johnke of Planned Parenthood of Pennsylvania, a
supporter of legal abortion. ``We are committed to fighting it out
there.''
   In Iowa, Gov. Terry Branstad, who said he has ``a consistent
pro-life position,'' hailed the ruling but took a middle position on
possible new laws. He said he first will ``consult with a wide range
of people,'' adding: ``I think we have to consider all points of
view.''
   Similarly, Sen. Lu Hardin, an Arkansas Democrat who has
introducted anti-abortion legislation in the past, said he would
study the ruling before acting on new laws for his state. ``Am I
just going to automatically sponsor them? The answer is no,'' he
said.
   The high court upheld several abortion restrictions in a Missouri
law, including provisions banning any public employee from
performing or assisting in abortions not neccessary to save the
mother's life, and banning the use of any public hospital or other
facility in such abortions.
   The ruling also said the states may ban the use of tax money for
``encouraging or counseling'' women to have abortions not necessary
to save their lives, and may require doctors to determine, when
possible, whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old can live outside the
womb.
   As a result of the ruling, ``What we are going to see is a
tremendous surge of legislative activity,'' said Sarah Weddington,
the Texas lawyer who argued the case, known as Roe v. Wade, that
legalized abortion in 1973.
   New state laws, she said, ``could eventually lead to abortion
being almost, if not actually, illegal in at least some states and
maybe many of the states.''
   While Roe v. Wade was not reversed, ``We are considering it a
victory,'' said Molly Kelly, of the Pro-Life Coalition of Southeast
Pennsylvania.
   ``We're obviously going to try to get our Legislature not only to
uphold the Missouri provisions, but also to challenge Roe so that
the next time this case comes up we think Roe will go down,'' she
said.

   The Supreme Court ruled today that some
government-sponsored religious displays are permissible as long as
they do not have ``the effect of promoting or endorsing religious
beliefs.''
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said displaying a Christmas nativity
scene inside the Allegheny County Courthouse in Pittsburgh violates
constitutionally required separation of church and state because it
appears to endorse Christian principles.
   But the court unanimously permitted a Hanukkah menorah on the
front steps of the City-County Building in Pittsburgh because that
display also included a Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty,
which the court said produced an overall secular purpose.
   The ruling came on the final day of this court session along with
a long-awaiting decision on the controversial abortion issue.
   In the abortion case, the justices gave states far greater power
to limit abortions, but stopped short of reversing their 1973
decision legalizing abortion. They also agreed to hear three other
abortion cases _ from Minnesota, Illinois and Ohio _ when the
court's next term begins in October.
   In other actions, the court:
   _Accepting its first-ever ``right to die'' case, agreed to decide
whether a Missouri family may order removal of a life-support system
from a woman in an irreversible vegetative condition.
   _Agreed to review a 1984 federal law requiring that student
religious groups be given the same access as other extra-curricular
clubs to public high school facilities. The justices will decide
whether a Bible study group must be allowed to meet at an Omaha,
Neb., high school after class hours.
   _Ordered a battle over state taxing powers reargued on broader
issues next term. Related cases from Arkansas and Florida raise the
issue of whether a business that successfully challenges a state tax
as a burden on interstate commerce is entitled to a refund of
previously paid taxes.
   The court said the menorah, a nine-branched candelabra used
during the celebration of the Jewish holiday Hanukkah, does not
appear to endorse Judaism because of its ``particular physical
setting.''
   The inclusion of the Christmas tree and sign saluting liberty
give the overall display a secular purpose, the court said.
   While the justices were split sharply in declaring the Nativity
scene unconstitutional, the court substantially upheld its long-used
test for determining when the wall between church and state is
breached.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for the court and was joined in
striking down the Nativity scene by Justices William J. Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall, John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, participating in his first
church-state case since joining the court in 1988, dissented in
voting to permit the Nativity scene.
   The other dissenters were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia.
   ``Thank God for the Supreme Court,'' said Charles Saul, a
Pittsburgh attorney representing a Jewish group which owned the
menorah. ``The court is saying that when you put a menorah and a
Christmas tree and these kinds of things together, that all faiths
are welcome. And that the government is not endorsing one particular
religion.''
   Blackmun said the Nativity scene, or creche, violates the
Constitution because ``nothing in the context of the display
detracts from the creche's religious message.''
   That message, Blackmun said, is spelled out unmistakably in the
display.
   ```Glory to God in the Highest!' says the angel in the creche _
glory to God because of the birth of Jesus,'' he said. ``This praise
to God in Christian terms is indisputably religious _ indeed
sectarian.''
   By contrast, he said display containing the menorah includes
symbols that support the nation's pluralist tradition.
   ``The city's overall display must be understood as conveying the
city's secular recognition of different traditions for celebrating
the winter holiday season,'' he said.
   Kennedy said the court, in barring goverment sponsorship of the
creche, showed ``an unjustified hostility toward religion, a
hostility inconsistent with our history and our precedents.''
   Today's ruling relied heavily on a 1984 decision in which the
court upheld the constitutionality of a creche in Pawtucket, R.I.
   The creche at issue there was surrounded by secular symbols such
as Santa Claus, reindeer and snowmen.
   The Pittsburgh creche was displayed by itself.
   Justice Department lawyers had urged the justices to allow the
Pittsburgh displays, contending, ``Since the use of the creche as a
symbol of the holiday does not constitute a government endorsement
of the religious content of that symbol, the government is not
required to surround it with candy canes, reindeer or other purely
secular symbols.''
   Lower courts across the nation have been confused about just
where the 1984 ruling drew the line between permissible governmental
acknowledgment of religious heritages and the unconstitutional
promotion or advancement of religion.
   Most lower courts have treated the 1984 decision as a narrow one,
and have disallowed various religious displays deemed too religious.
   Blackmun acknowledged today that the 1984 ruling is ``none too
clear.'' But he said today's ruling may help dispel the confusion.
   He said these are the guiding principles: ``The government's use
of religious symbolism is unconstitutional if it has the effect of
endorsing religious beliefs, and the effect of the government's use
of religious symoblism depends upon its context.''
   In Pittsburgh, from 1981 to 1987, a 9-foot-wide creche depicting
the birth of Jesus Christ was displayed inside the county courthouse
in the city for about six weeks during the Christmas season.
   A block away, an 18-foot menorah was displayed each year from
1982 to 1987 on the front steps f the building that houses city and
county offices. It stood next to a 45-foot Christmas tree.
   A federal judge refused to order the dismantling of the displays
in late 1987, but the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, by a
2-1 vote, that they were unlawful. That ruling prevented the
displays being shown last Christmas season.
   The creche is owned by the Holy Name Society, a Roman Catholic
men's group that arranges for its display. The menorah is owned by
Chabad, a small Jewish sect that loaned the symbol to the city free
of charge.
   The legal controversy began when the American Civil Liberties
Union asked for removal of the creche and menorah in 1986. The
request was denied.
   The ACLU, several lawyers who conduct business at the courthouse,
a Unitarian minister and a Moslem then sued, seeking to block the
displays.

<HEAD>British Hostage's Brother Appeals For His Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The brother of British hostage John
McCarthy appealed today to his captors to release McCarthy before
his ailing mother dies.
   The Arabic-language statement was issued in Beirut and signed by
McCarthy's brother Terrence.
   ``I plead with you in the name of mercy and justice for which
Islam is known, to fulfill the wish of an ailing woman to see her
son before she dies,'' the statement said.
   The Beirut office of the London-based Worldwide Television News
network distributed the appeal.
   McCarthy, a journalist, was working for WTN when he was kidnapped
April 17, 1986, as he was being driven to Beirut airport to catch a
flight to London.
   It was the fourth such appeal in two weeks. McCarthy's father,
Pat, pleaded for McCarthy's release on June 20, saying the captive's
mother, Sheila, was ``gravely ill in hospital.''
   ``She is dying in one of London's hospitals. Bring back John for
her so that she departs this life peacefully,'' Terrence McCarthy's
appeal said.
   ``Please bring back the smile to the face of the McCarthy family
at this critical period. Please release John,'' it concluded.
   McCarthy, 32, is one of 14 foreigners held captive in Lebanon.
   His brother's message did not name any of the Moslem extremist
groups holding hostages, because none has claimed to hold McCarthy.
   Nine Americans are among those held. The hostage held longest is
American journalist Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   In the Hindu Kush mountains,
shattered, crumbling huts tell tales their inhabitants probably
never will, of the savagery that turned thousands of villages into
graveyards.
   Families that tilled the orchards and fields for unknown
generations have disappeared. The silence is broken by an occasional
burst of gunfire or a military convoy roaring through the valleys
where shattered villages cling to the 15,000-foot mountains like an
image of Armageddon.
   What happened to villages like Lalma, Babagilala, Babamardan and
Babashangrul will not be known until the war between the government
and Moslem guerrillas ends and accounts can be pieced together from
villagers who escaped.
   After a decade of war, the barbarity has become widely known. But
in the Hindu Kush mountains, along the river valleys and across the
plains where the armies of Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan once
marched, the scenes of devastation go beyond what was previously
known about the conflict.
   International relief workers fear they are only beginning to
learn of the destruction wrought on the rebel-controlled countryside.
   ``There are black holes, places no one has been for years and
probably won't get to until the war is over. But if what we know now
is a barometer of the level of destruction, this war has been almost
genocidal,'' said one international aid worker, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   According to Asif Zahir, minister of planning and reconstruction,
at least half the country's 35,500 villages have been bombed,
shelled and rocketed into oblivion. Fields, orchards and irrigation
canals vital to this agriculturally dependent society are in ruins.
   Once peace is restored, relief workers say, it will take years
and billions of dollars to bring what was already one of the world's
poorest countries back to the point it was in April 1978, when
Marxists seized power and civil war broke out.
   Government and military officials say the devastation occurred
progressively over 11 years of fighting as the guerrillas occupied
the villages and the Afghan army and Soviet troops sent in to help
battled to uproot them.
   Across Afghanistan, in villages and towns of the western,
southern and eastern provinces, the conflict has destroyed all
semblance of civilized living. Entire districts lie in rubble.
Schools, medical facilities and public utilities have disappeared.
   Soldiers of the Soviet-backed Kabul government say much of the
destruction occurred in the final weeks before Feb. 15, when the
Kremlin withdrew the last of its troops from Afghanistan.
   Fearing attacks on retreating convoys by guerrillas hiding in the
villages, the Soviets ordered bombing raids and artillery barrages
on the villages and other suspected guerrilla hideouts along the
departure routes.
   ``Those that were lucky got out and those that couldn't probably
died,'' Brig. Gen. Mohammad Shafi, who commands the Second Infantry
Division, said in a matter-of-fact tone.
   After the Red Army was gone, the U.S.-backed guerrillas slipped
back to their posts. The Afghan army mounted another offensive and
forced the rebels to retreat into the snow-covered mountains a
second time.
   ``The enemy used to be here. We had to come and punish them and
destroy their hideouts,'' said Shafi, pointing to the ruins around
Haijan, scene of some of the fiercest battles since the Soviet
pullout.
   Along the sinuous Salang Highway, which climbs through the Hindu
Kush and winds north toward the Soviet Union, soldiers now stand
guard at military outposts interspersed with hundreds of burned out
tanks and armored personnel carriers.
   But the wreckage littering the road and the hulks of tanks and
trucks blasted into the icy, rushing water of the Salang River are
little compared to the destruction that lies above the road.
   Relief workers estimate it will take at least $1 billion to start
rebuilding and billions of dollars more for several years.
   Zahir, the reconstruction minister, predicts most reconstruction
could be completed within five years. But he added that some things
can never be replaced.
   ``You can't rebuild a society with mere money. There are many
values that have been destroyed by this war,'' he said.
   ``You can always rebuild a road or a well of a piece of land. But
millions of people _ some of the brightest minds in Afghanistan have
left. How do you bring them back? More than a million Afghans have
died. We cannot revive them.''

   Space shuttle Columbia, a source of
spare parts for its sister ships since 1986, today rolled closer to
the launch pad and its secret mission for the Pentagon.
   Hours before dawn, workers towed America's oldest orbiter into
the huge assembly building from a hangar where it has spent most of
the past 3{ years.
   Workers this afternoon were to attach the fuel tank and twin
booster rockets that will propel Columbia into space on its first
mission since Jan. 10, 1986 _ the last flight before the Challenger
disaster grounded the fleet.
   The shuttle is scheduled to make its eight-hour, four-mile crawl
to the Kennedy Space Center launch pad July 9.
   NASA's official target date for the launch is July 31, although
some space agency officials believe liftoff will be delayed until
early August because flight preparations have taken longer than
expected.
   Columbia will carry a secret military payload believed to be a
large satellite.
   During the 2{ years that the shuttle program was grounded, NASA
made numerous safety and performance improvements to the fleet.
Parts were borrowed from Columbia for NASA's newer, lighter
orbiters, Discovery and Atlantis.

   Officials at the clinic that figured in today's
Supreme Court abortion ruling called the decision ``the beginning of
a war'' that will be fought for years to come.
   ``This is a serious, serious setback for women and families in
this country,'' said Judith Widdicombe, founder of Reproductive
Health Services, the clinic that challenged a 1986 Missouri law
which imposed a variety of restrictions on a woman's right to obtain
an abortion. ``This is an outrage.
   ``There's a movement in this country that will not tolerate this.
It will become our Vietnam of the 1990s.''
   Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft hailed today's ruling, saying that
``By beginning the dismemberment of Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court
gives the American people greater ability to save innocent lives.
That's something Missourians take very seriously.''
   The high court stopped short of overturning its 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision which barred the states from outlawing abortion.
   State Attorney General William Webster, who was the chief
defendant in a suit brought by Reproductive Health Services
challenging the law, called the decision ``a great victory,'' but
declined further comment until he had read the full text of the
opinion.
   Jane, 30, a St. Louis woman who had an abortion earlier this
year, was at the clinic for the announcement of the decision.
   ``This is going to go on and on,'' said Jane, who asked that her
real name not be used. ``And the quiet silent majority is going to
have to speak up. Every organization that's pro-choice is going to
have to fight a thousand times harder. It's like dominoes. If you
give up once, they keep falling down one by one.
   She said the restrictions are going to cause abortions to cost
more and become more difficult to get.
   ``It's clear that in Missouri a woman is not going to have the
option that I had a couple of months ago,'' said Jane.
   Widdicombe said she did not believe the anti-abortion movement
would be satisfied with the tighter restrictions on abortions.
   ``Their goal is no abortions,'' Widdicombe said. ``Next will come
birth control.''
   She said her main fear now was that the Legislature would
interpret the Supreme Court ruling as restrictively as possible.
   Mary Bryant of Planned Parenthood, who lobbied against Missouri's
1986 law, said she expected an ``avalanche'' of legislation
introduced in Missouri that would attempt to even further restrict
abortions in the state.
   In today's decision, the justices restored Missouri regulations
that:
   _ require doctors to determine, when possible, whether a fetus at
least 20 weeks old is capable of surviving outside the womb, by
testing lung capacity and conducting other tests.
   _ ban the use of tax money for ``encouraging or counseling''
women to have abortions not necessary to save life.
   _ ban any public employee _ doctor, nurse or other health care
provider _ to perform or assist an abortion not necessary to save a
woman's life.
   _ ban the use of any public hospital or other facility for
performing abortions not necessary to save life.
   The decision also upheld the constitutionality of a declaration
in Missouri law that ``the life of each human being begins at
conception.''

   The 1.8 million-member United Church of
Christ today elected a president and decided whether to move its
headquarters.
   Results of the balloting this morning by delegates to the UCC's
17th General Synod were not immediately available.
   The 703 delegates were asked to decide whether to combine the
denomination's national offices _ now scattered in three New York
City locations _ into a single New York location or move them to
Cleveland.
   Other Protestant denominations have moved from New York in recent
years.
   The Rev. Yvonne Delk of Union City, N.J., faced the Rev. Paul H.
Sherry of Chicago for president, raising the possibility that the
UCC, one of the most liberal of the mainline churches, would elect
the first woman president of a major Protestant group.
   While the UCC president has no doctrinal power over the
denomination's members, the position is widely viewed as an
important theological platform.
   Supporters of the move to Cleveland say it would save millions in
rent and other costs and bridge a symbolic gap between the national
and local church.
   Critics say a move from New York would diminish the UCC's
standing in the ecumenical community.
   The Ohio delegation, with more than 70 people, is the synod's
largest, and it has lobbied hard for a move to Cleveland.
   The denomination was formed in the 1957 merger of the
Congregational Christian Churches and the Evangelical and Reformed
Church.
   In 1987, after the New York-based United Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.) merged with the Atlanta-based Presbyterian Church (U.S.),
the new Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) set itself up in Louisville, Ky.
   Three Lutheran denominations, including the New York-based
Lutheran Church in America, merged in 1987 and established
headquarters in Chicago.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court's decision today to cut back
women's constitutional rights to abortion doesn't end the matter.
Other action taken court ensures that abortion will dominate the
court's 1989-90 term as well.
   The court, in its final day of the 1988-89 term, agreed to review
abortion controversies from Illinois, Ohio and Minnesota during the
session that begins in October.
   The Illinois case clearly poses the largest direct threat to Roe
vs. Wade. It would be extremely difficult for the court to revive
the Illinois laws without substantially dismantling its 1973
decision.
   The Illinois case stems from that state's attempt to enforce
extensive regulations on abortion clinics.
   Lower courts said three Illinois laws, when applied to abortion
clinics, impermissibly interfered with womens' abortion rights.
   A federal trial judge and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
said the regulations imposed by the Illinois laws would have forced
abortion clinics to become ``the functional equivalent of small
hospitals'' for no valid purpose.
   The three laws _ the Medical Practice Act, the Ambulatory
Surgical Treatment Center Act and the Health Facilities Providers
Act _ generally apply to all medical centers where outpatient
surgery is performed.
   The regulations covered staffing and equipment requirements and
even the size of the facility.
   One regulation required patient counseling that included a
discussion of alternatives, description of the procedure to be
performed and an explanation of risks and possible complications.
   The Ohio abortion law generally required doctors to notify a
parent of young, unmarried girls before performing abortions.
   Lower courts said the law impermissibly interfered with some
girls' constitutional right to seek an abortion.
   Passed by the state's Legislature in 1985, the Ohio law never
took effect due to a successful legal challenge by an Akron abortion
clinic and one of its doctors.
   The law would have required any doctor asked to perform an
abortion on an unmarried girl under 18 to contact one of the girl's
parents at least 24 hours before the operation.
   Doctors could satisfy the law's notification requirement by
telling the girl's brother or sister, if over 21, or a designated
stepparent or grandparent.
   Young girls could seek to bypass parental notification by seeking
the permission of a state judge to have an abortion.
   Among other flaws found by the lower courts was the fact that
Ohio had ``made no showing that (its interest in protecting immature
minors) is advanced by requiring the attending physician, as opposed
to another qualified, responsible person'' to do the notifying.
   The Minnesota law at issue requires some girls to tell both
parents at least 48 hours before having an abortion. It was upheld
by a federal appeals court.
   The Minnesota Legislature passed a law in 1981 requiring
unmarried girls under 18 and still living with a parent to provide
written notice to both parents, if possible, before obtaining an
abortion.
   The law also imposed a 48-hour waiting period, and made doctors
who perform abortions criminally liable for violations.
   After a judge blocked enforcement of the law, a judicial bypass
option took effect. It allowed girls to avoid notifying their
parents by convincing a judge they were ``mature and capable of
giving informed consent'' or that an abortion without notice to both
parents would serve the girl's ``best interest.''
   The notification law, with the judicial bypass option, was in
effect in Minnesota for five years before a federal judge ruled that
it was unconstitutional.
   The law had been challenged in behalf of minors, a parent, four
abortion clinics and two doctors.
   A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld that ruling, but the entire appeals court last Aug. 8 upheld
the law by a 7-3 vote.
   The 8th Circuit court postponed the effect of its ruling so
opponents of the law could seek Supreme Court review.
   The high court previously has upheld a state's parental
notification law, but it never before has handled a case involving
such a law that had been in effect.

<HEAD>Ian Smith Challenges His Suspension From Legislature</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retired white opposition figure Ian D.
Smith launched a court appeal Monday of his suspension from the
Zimbabwe parliament in 1987 for criticizing the government.
   In a test case challenging the jurisdiction of parliament, Smith
filed for payment of his salary as a legislator during his
suspension in 1987.
   Attorneys for Smith _ the leader of the former breakaway British
colony of Rhodesia that became independent Zimbabwe in 1980 _ said
he was filing for his unpaid salary of about $2,250.
   Smith, 68, was suspended from the legislature after attacking the
government's calls for economic sanctions against neighboring South
Africa. He also charged that democracy had been undermined in
black-governed Zimbabwe.
   The appellate court's ruling is not expected for several months.
   Last year, a lower court ruled the 100-seat parliament was
empowered to suspend erring members and dismissed Smith's claim
against the legislature.
   Smith, who led white-ruled Rhodesia from 1965 to 1979, held a
parliamentary seat in indepedent Zimbabwe until 20 seats reserved
for white politicians were abolished in 1987.

<HEAD>Reforms Needed in Food Processing, Gorbachev Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increasing production won't put more food into
Soviet stores unless processing and packaging also are improved,
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told a conference on agriculture.
   Gorbachev and Yegor K. Ligachev, the Politburo member in charge
of agriculture, said poor food packaging and processing results in
losses of more than 20 percent of produce before the goods reach the
market.
   ``We have asked a number of ministries, including defense, to
help out,'' Gorbachev said. Several military plants are being
converted to civilian use to help ease food and consumer goods
shortages.
   Details of Friday's conference of the Communist Party's
policy-making Central Committee were published Monday in the party
newspaper, Pravda.
   ``Further increases of agriculture production is senseless unless
we deal with processing, since much of the produce is lost,'' he
said.
   Gorbachev said entrenched party bosses were hampering
agricultural reform, particularly lease farming approved by the
Central Committee in March.
   ``There are opponents to lease farming. When they cannot
intimidate those people who are not afraid of responsibility and
hard work, they offer such conditions of lease that there is no way
for anyone to agree to them,'' he said.
   Under the March reforms, farmers who till land owned by the state
were allowed to lease the property from the state for 50 years, with
the right to pass it on to descendants. Officials say the program
has started slowly, in part because of bureaucratic meddling.
   Gorbachev said party bosses who obstruct reform should be dealt
with at the regional level. ``Party bodies should not be afraid of
those Communist leaders who are doing harm to our cause because it
does harm both to the cause and party credibility.''
   Ligachev said diverting military resources to civilian use could
help get more food into the shops. ``Defense ministries are expected
to provide sophisticated up-to-date equipment for food industries.
Because of their general efficiency, they have been given that task.
   ``It is well known the country has shortages of many things.
Unfortunately, there is no shortage of rhetoric, labels and
sometimes libel,'' he said.
   Ligachev said government critics were demanding the land be
turned over to farmers.
   ``At the same time, it appears that in real life, the vast
majority of farmers do not want to take that land and leave
collective and state farms,'' he said.
   The deputy chairman of the Georgian republic's Council of
Ministers, Guram D. Mgeladze, said farmers were unwilling to risk
leaving secure jobs on state farms for leased land because ``they
have been deceived so many times.''

<HEAD>High Court Rejects Hispanics' Challenge of English as Florida's Language</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected appeals by
Hispanics challenging Florida's designation of English as the
state's official language.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that an election
giving official-language status to English did not violate the
federal Voting Rights Act.
   Florida voters last Nov. 8 approved the proposal by an 84-16
percent margin. The initiative amended the state Constitution and
left it up to the Florida Legislature to implement the change.
   Voters in Colorado and Arizona approved similar measures the same
day, bringing to at least 17 the number of states that have passed
laws or adopted constitutional amendments designating English as the
official language.
   The other states are Arkansas, California, Georgia, Hawaii,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina,
North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.
   Spearheading the drive for such measures is a group calling
itself U.S. English, which also has been urging Congress to make
English the nation's official language.
   The ballot proposal in Florida was challenged on grounds that
petitions seeking signatures to place the initiative on the ballot
were not translated into Spanish in six of the state's 67 counties
covered by the federal Voting Rights Act.
   The law requires a state that distributes ``materials or
information relating to the electoral process'' to provide a
bilingual translation for minority groups in covered areas.
   But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that
Florida officials did not violate the law.
   The appeals court said the law does not apply to initiative
petitions and, in Florida's case, the involvement by state officials
was marginal.
   The state officials had a ``ministerial'' role in placing the
initiative on the ballot but were not responsible for the drive that
collected signatures on the petitions, the appeals court said.
   ``Congress has never shown any intent ... to expand coverage of
the (Voting Rights Act) to materials distributed by private
citizens,'' the appeals court said. ``It is hard to imagine that in
passing the act Congress could have intended that private citizens
seeking to further their own political goals through the initiative
petition process be subject to specific language requirements.''
   The appeals court upheld a ruling by a federal judge who said the
initiative was legal.
   The 11th Circuit court also rejected arguments that the judge
lacked authority to rule in the case. Opponents of the initiative
said the Voting Rights Act requires that the dispute be decided
initially by a special three-judge federal court, not a lone judge.
   Leaders in South Florida's Latin community said approval of the
initiative touched off an increase in anti-Hispanic incidents.
   The cases are Delgado vs. Smith, 88-1327, and In Re Delgado,
88-1329.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Told to Restudy Lawsuit Against Helmsley</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today told a federal appeals
court to restudy a lawsuit accusing billionaire hotel owner Harry
Helmsley and his business partners of fraud in connection with a New
York city condominium conversion.
   The justices said the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals should
restudy Helmsley's case in light of their June 26 ruling in a
Minnesota telephone rates case.
   The appeals court ruled that Helmsley and the others may be sued
under a federal law, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act or RICO.
   The appeals court last January ruled that the law permits five
tenants of the Parkchester condominium complex in the Bronx to sue
on grounds the business partners concealed structural defects in the
buildings, the presence of asbestos in insulation and the need to
replace electrical systems.
   The appeals court said the accusations constitute a pattern of
racketeering activity as defined by the RICO statute.
   The Supreme Court issued a similar ruling June 26. The justices
said a single fraudulent scheme that has the threat of continuing
illegal activities is covered by the 19-year-old law.
   The high court also said the law is aimed at more than the
traditional forms of organized crime, and may target fraudulent
business activities as well.
   The case acted on today is separate from a federal indictment
against Helmsley, his wife, Leona, and two of their former aides.
   Mrs. Helmsley is accused in that case of evading taxes by billing
personal luxuries as business expenses.
   Her husband, who is 80, has been found incompetent to stand trial
on the criminal charges because of memory loss and reasoning
problems caused by several slight strokes.
   Opening arguments in the criminal case were scheduled for
Wednesday in federal court in New York City.
   The case acted on today is Helmsley vs. Beauford, 88-1523.

   The Supreme Court ruled today that some
government-sponsored religious displays are permissible as long as
they do not have ``the effect of promoting or endorsing religious
beliefs.''
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said displaying a Christmas nativity
scene inside the Allegheny County Courthouse in Pittsburgh violates
constitutionally required separation of church and state because it
appears to endorse Christian principles.
   But the court unanimously permitted a Hanukkah menorah on the
front steps of the City-County Building in Pittsburgh because that
display also included a Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty,
which the court said produced an overall secular purpose.
   The ruling came on the final day of this court session along with
a long-awaiting decision on the controversial abortion issue.
   In the abortion case, the justices gave states far greater power
to limit abortions, but stopped short of reversing their 1973
decision legalizing abortion. They also agreed to hear three other
abortion cases _ from Minnesota, Illinois and Ohio _ when the
court's next term begins in October.
   In other actions, the court:
   _Accepting its first-ever ``right to die'' case, agreed to decide
whether a Missouri family may order removal of a life-support system
from a woman in an irreversible vegetative condition.
   _Agreed to review a 1984 federal law requiring that student
religious groups be given the same access as other extra-curricular
clubs to public high school facilities. The justices will decide
whether a Bible study group must be allowed to meet at an Omaha,
Neb., high school after class hours.
   _Ordered a battle over state taxing powers reargued on broader
issues next term. Related cases from Arkansas and Florida raise the
issue of whether a business that successfully challenges a state tax
as a burden on interstate commerce is entitled to a refund of
previously paid taxes.
   _Rejected appeals by Hispanics challenging Florida's designation
of English as the state's official language.
   _Without comment, rejected arguments that the government
unlawfully tried to silence political extremist Lyndon LaRouche, who
was convicted with six others in a scheme to defraud lenders of more
than $30 million.
   _Told the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to restudy a a
lawsuit accusing billionaire hotel owner Harry Helmsley and his
business partners of fraud in connection with a New York city
condominium conversion.
   The court said the menorah, a nine-branched candelabra used
during the celebration of the Jewish holiday Hanukkah, does not
appear to endorse Judaism because of its ``particular physical
setting.''
   The inclusion of the Christmas tree and sign saluting liberty
give the overall display a secular purpose, the court said.
   While the justices were split sharply in declaring the Nativity
scene unconstitutional, the court substantially upheld its long-used
test for determining when the wall between church and state is
breached.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for the court and was joined in
striking down the Nativity scene by Justices William J. Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall, John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, participating in his first
church-state case since joining the court in 1988, dissented in
voting to permit the Nativity scene.
   The other dissenters were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia.
   ``Thank God for the Supreme Court,'' said Charles Saul, a
Pittsburgh attorney representing a Jewish group which owned the
menorah. ``The court is saying that when you put a menorah and a
Christmas tree and these kinds of things together, that all faiths
are welcome. And that the government is not endorsing one particular
religion.''
   Blackmun said the Nativity scene, or creche, violates the
Constitution because ``nothing in the context of the display
detracts from the creche's religious message.''
   That message, Blackmun said, is spelled out unmistakably in the
display.
   ```Glory to God in the Highest!' says the angel in the creche _
glory to God because of the birth of Jesus,'' he said. ``This praise
to God in Christian terms is indisputably religious _ indeed
sectarian.''
   By contrast, he said display containing the menorah includes
symbols that support the nation's pluralist tradition.
   ``The city's overall display must be understood as conveying the
city's secular recognition of different traditions for celebrating
the winter holiday season,'' he said.
   Kennedy said the court, in barring goverment sponsorship of the
creche, showed ``an unjustified hostility toward religion, a
hostility inconsistent with our history and our precedents.''
   Today's ruling relied heavily on a 1984 decision in which the
court upheld the constitutionality of a creche in Pawtucket, R.I.
   The creche at issue there was surrounded by secular symbols such
as Santa Claus, reindeer and snowmen.
   The Pittsburgh creche was displayed by itself.
   Justice Department lawyers had urged the justices to allow the
Pittsburgh displays, contending, ``Since the use of the creche as a
symbol of the holiday does not constitute a government endorsement
of the religious content of that symbol, the government is not
required to surround it with candy canes, reindeer or other purely
secular symbols.''
   Lower courts across the nation have been confused about just
where the 1984 ruling drew the line between permissible governmental
acknowledgment of religious heritages and the unconstitutional
promotion or advancement of religion.
   Most lower courts have treated the 1984 decision as a narrow one,
and have disallowed various religious displays deemed too religious.
   Blackmun acknowledged today that the 1984 ruling is ``none too
clear.'' But he said today's ruling may help dispel the confusion.
   He said these are the guiding principles: ``The government's use
of religious symbolism is unconstitutional if it has the effect of
endorsing religious beliefs, and the effect of the government's use
of religious symoblism depends upon its context.''
   In Pittsburgh, from 1981 to 1987, a 9-foot-wide creche depicting
the birth of Jesus Christ was displayed inside the county courthouse
in the city for about six weeks during the Christmas season.
   A block away, an 18-foot menorah was displayed each year from
1982 to 1987 on the front steps f the building that houses city and
county offices. It stood next to a 45-foot Christmas tree.
   A federal judge refused to order the dismantling of the displays
in late 1987, but the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, by a
2-1 vote, that they were unlawful. That ruling prevented the
displays being shown last Christmas season.
   The creche is owned by the Holy Name Society, a Roman Catholic
men's group that arranges for its display. The menorah is owned by
Chabad, a small Jewish sect that loaned the symbol to the city free
of charge.
   The legal controversy began when the American Civil Liberties
Union asked for removal of the creche and menorah in 1986. The
request was denied.
   The ACLU, several lawyers who conduct business at the courthouse,
a Unitarian minister and a Moslem then sued, seeking to block the
displays.

   The long-governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party claimed victory today in four states after
regional elections that raised outcries of fraud from both the
incumbent party and its opponents.
   Though the governing party said its candidate won the Baja
California governor's race, the challenger said partial returns
indicated he was leading.
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as PRI, claimed
victory in 10 of 18 legislative districts in Michoacan state, where
it was gauging its strength after losing to the left in general
elections last July.
   The centrist PRI said it swept voting in Chihuahua and Zacatecas
states and held strong leads in the Chihuahua mayoral races in
Ciudad Juarez and the city of Chihuahua itself.
   Returns were not yet available in Campeche state.
   The elections tested the pledge of President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari to end fraudulent elections and respect opposition victories.
   However, opposition parties charged that the PRI inflated voter
registration lists, sent groups of voters to cast ballots in several
polling places, and cheated in other ways.
   Congressman Norberto Corrella of the conservative National Action
Party, or PAN, told reporters today he spent all night recovering
stolen ballot boxes and filing complaints with the district
attorney's office in Mexicali, the capital of Baja California.
   ``We recovered 17 ballot boxes that were taken away,'' he said,
alleging that deputies appointed by local election boards stole the
boxes from precincts where their party was losing. These deputies
appeared hours later at the electoral commission with a ballot box
containing altered ballots, and ``All of a sudden ... they are
winning 10-to-1,'' he said.
   Promises by Salinas and Chihuahua Gov. Fernando Baeza of clean
elections ``were just words,'' said Jesus Hernandez, a PAN spokesman
in Ciudad Juarez. ``These elections were dirty.''
   However, opposition party officials contacted in several states
indicated that overall, the irregularities were less widespread and
serious than in the past.
   ``Incidents of direct violence were fewer, but the institutional
violence that is hidden by false documents is intact,'' said Pedro
Cesar Acosta, a PAN spokesman in Chihuahua state.
   The PRI had some of its own charges. In Michoacan, Jose
Guadarrama, a member of the PRI national committee, accused
opposition leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of campaigning at polling
places in the state.
   With 10 percent of the vote counted in the Baja California
governor's race, ``the victory of Margarita Ortega is clean and
unchallengeable,'' said Eduardo Manuel Martinez Palomera, a PRI
district committee president.
   But Ernesto Ruffo, the PAN challenger, said a count of 25 percent
of the vote by his party showed him winning.
   A Ruffo victory would hand the PRI the first loss in a governor's
election in its 60-year history.
   The PRI also said complete but unofficial results showed it had
won or was leading in 10 other Chihuahua mayoral races.
   PAN in Baja California said its unofficial results indicated it
was leading in Ensenada, where Ruffo had been mayor, and in Tijuana.
The PRI said it had no early returns for the cities.
   Official results were not expected for a week.
   The liberal Democratic Revolutionary Party in Michoacan and the
PAN in Chihuahua and Baja California complained of irregularities in
voter registration lists.
   PAN said the lists were padded by hundreds of thousands of names,
while names of opposition supporters vanished.
   Some people in Michoacan showed reporters voter registration
cards but said they had been told they were not on the lists and
were not permitted to vote.
   Other critics said the indelible ink used to mark voter's fingers
to prevent them from voting more than once had been removed in some
cases.
   Attempts to steal ballot boxes were reported in Ciudad Juarez and
in Baja California, but both failed.
   About half the eligible voters cast ballots in Baja California,
the PRI said. While no figures were available, opposition leaders in
the other states said turnout was far lower.

<HEAD>High Court allows anti-dumping regulations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today allowed the government
to enforce anti-dumping regulations in a way foreign companies and
importers of foreign goods say improperly impedes international
trade.
   The court, without comment, rejected a Canadian steel producer's
appeal, which was supported by an American export-import association
and an international consumers group.
   Algoma Steel Corp. Ltd. of Canada challenged a decision by the
International Trade Commission, a U.S. agency responsible for
enforcing some anti-dumping rules.
   The commission said that Canadian steel tubing was being dumped _
sold at below fair market value _ in the United States. The
commission said such sales were injuring or threatening injury to
U.S. industry.
   The finding permits imposition of anti-dumping duties to penalize
foreign companies and importers of the steel products.
   The Commerce Department, which shares responsibility for
enforcing anti-dumping rules, said some of Algoma Steel's exports to
the United States were sold above fair market value.
   Commerce officials said that over one six-month period more than
half of Algoma Steel's exports were sold above fair market value.
   Algoma Steel said that fact, in effect, was ignored when the
International Trade Commission determined dumped goods were causing
injury to U.S. industry.
   The Canadian company said any fairly traded products should be
excluded from the commission's assessment.
   But a federal appeals court here upheld the commission's finding
in January, ruling the commission did not act arbitrarily or
capriciously when it included the fairly trade goods in its
calculations.
   ``Many such (fairly traded) sales might be the best evidence
possible that the less-than-fair-value sales had served their
purpose and the United States competitor was in full retreat,'' the
appeals court said. ``It is therefore not at all obvious that the
more-than-fair-value sales are (automatically) legally irrelevant.''
   Algoma Steel's appeal was supported by the American Association
of Exporters and Importers representing 1,200 U.S. companies
involved in international trade.
   ``The inclusion of fairly traded imports to decide injury in a
dumping case blurs the distinction between fair trade and unfair
trade, thereby penalizing honest U.S. importers who follow
internationally acceptable practices,'' the association said.
   Also backing the appeal was Consumers for World Trade, which said
U.S. trade law was being misused to erect protectionist barriers.
   The Bush administration urged the justices to reject the appeal.
   The case is Algoma Steel vs. U.S., 88-1781.

   Thousands of Americans stop their normal
activities once a day, head outdoors and officially record the
weather in one of the nation's largest volunteer programs.
   Harry U. Gibson, 83, trudged out into Idaho's record low
temperatures last February, keeping up a tradition of never being
late to report in a quarter-century as an observer.
   To the south, in Red River, N.M., Robert W. Prunty is maintaining
a 57-year family effort in volunteer weather observing.
   Nearly everyone can call themselves a weather observer, of course.
   But 11,650 Americans do it in a regular, formal system organized
by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   These records, compiled over more than a century, constitute the
formal climate record of the United States and are used in both
weather and climate calculations.
   The observers take readings of rainfall, temperature, river
levels and other information, some collecting data at 7 a.m. local
time, others between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. local time.
   Their information is compiled with readings taken at National
Weather Service offices and by observers around the world to
constitute a global climate network.
   NOAA annually honors its volunteer observers, selecting five for
the Thomas Jefferson Award, named for the third president, who was
an avid weather observer.
   In addition, other volunteers are honored with the John Campanius
Holm Award, named for the man who collected the first weather
observations in colonial America, between 1644 and 1645 near
Wilmington, Del.
   The winners receive plaques citing their achievement.
   The Jefferson award winners this year are:
   _Gibson, a retired farmer, until recently collected weather data
in Boise and Kuna, Idaho for some 25 years. Going beyond his call of
duty, Gibson also warned local farmers of sudden temperature drops
that may threaten crops and livestock.
   _Prunty, a retired postmaster and assistant fire chief, has also
distributed daily weather reports at the local post office and
prepares weather summaries for the Sangre de Cristo Chronicle in
Eagle Nest, N.M.
   _William B. Gillespie Jr., of Effingham, N.C., succeeded his
father as local observer in 1946 to maintain a family tradition
started in 1918. Gillespie has battled floods to gather river stage
data and hasn't missed a report in 41 years despite the pressure of
also managing a general store.
   _John O. Nellermoe, a former rancher in Trotters, N.D., has been
a cooperative observer for 39 years. Besides reporting on crucial
aspects of soil moisture and temperature, he also provides emergency
assistance as a severe storms spotter.
   _Henry Cordes, of Cordes, Ariz., has been a volunteer observed
for 51 years without ever missing an observation or turning in a
late report.
   In addition to the five volunteers receiving the Thomas Jefferson
Awards, 24 were selected for the Holm Award.
   They are Hubert Bohleber, Carmel, Ill.; Charles S. Botsford,
Marion Center, Pa.; Clemon G. Clewell, Watonga, Okla.; Jose A.
Colom-Coll, Cerro Gordo-Ciales, Puerto Rico; Henry Dembowski, Loup
City, Neb.; Jack W. Fronabarger, Stanley, N.M.;
   Also Xinia I. Jones, Centerville, Ind.; Kenneth Leighow,
Millville, Pa.; Mildred K. Mignone, Marion, Ill.; David A. Perry,

   And Marion J. Saia, Emmett, Kan.; Mr. and Mrs. Jack Sharpe, La
Harpe, Ill.; Cyril G. Small, Lockport, N.Y.; Edward Sondag,
Sykeston, N.D.,; Cicero W. Swint, Jonesboro, Ga.; Kenneth F. Taylor,
Idleyd Park, Ore.;

   The African National Congress
guerrilla group has ordered a halt to attacks that are likely to
harm innocent civilians, according to a group of whites who returned
today from talks with the rebels.
   The delegation also said the ANC said it will not oppose white
anti-apartheid candidates in national elections because it thinks
they could make a difference in Parliament.
   Several Western countries, including the United States and
Denmark, paid for the meeting between 115 white South Africans and
the 85 members of the ANC, the largest of the exiled guerrilla
organizations fighting to overthrow the white minority government in
South Africa. Most ANC members are black.
   It was the largest group of white South Africans to have talks
with the ANC.
   ``The ANC tends to be demonized in this country, which is a very
serious problem considering we are going to need to negotiate with
them in the future,'' said Gael Neke, an executive member of the
Five Freedoms Forum, which organized the conference in Lusaka,
Zambia. The meeting began Thursday and ended Sunday.
   Ms. Neke said a major topic at the conference was the ANC's use
of violence, particularly limpet mines and car bombs aimed at
targets in which civilians are more likely to be hurt than the
military or police.
   These include restaurants, sports stadiums, public toilets and
trash cans.
   Some delegates expressed dissaproval of this policy and were told
by ANC delegates that orders ``went out last year to end'' such
violence, she said, adding that ``in fact it has stopped.''
   There have been 28 bombings in South Africa this year, with 20
injuries. Most of the recent bombs have been placed under police
vehicles or at the homes of politicians.
   The most serious occurred June 11, when a bomb exploded under a
parked police van at a soccer stadium in a black township, injuring
three black teen-agers and a 20-year-old man.
   The white delegation chief, Mike Olivier, said the ANC members,
including President Oliver Tambo and South African Communist Party
leader Joe Slovo, said some white anti-apartheid members of
Parliament could make a difference, although the organization
believes Parliament as a whole is not representative of South
Africans.
   He said the ANC representatives would not call for a boycott of
the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections for the white House of Assembly,
but they would continue to condemn voting in elections for the
Indian and mixed-race houses, because the ANC contends most people
in those communities do not vote and the elected members are
therefore not representative.
   Under law, blacks have no vote in national affairs.
   Olivier said the ANC insisted that certain conditions must exist
in South Africa before it is willing to negotiate with the South
African government. Those conditions include the release of
political prisoners; legalization of the ANC and other
anti-apartheid political organizations; the lifting of the national
state of emergency, the return of exiles to South Africa; and
withdrawal of soldiers from black townships.
   Another Five Freedoms Forum member, Gavin Evans, said ANC
delegates indicated ``if those conditions were met, on entering into
a period of negotiations, they would be prepared to suspend
violence.''
   He said the delegates didn't discuss what ``suspend'' meant.

   Anti-abortion groups today hailed the Supreme
Court's abortion ruling as a major victory while pro-choice
advocates said greater restrictions on the right to end a pregnancy
will send women ``into back alleys.''
   ``We are smiling. We are thumbs up all the way,'' John Willke of
the National Right to Life Committee said shortly after the court's
divided ruling that expanded state authority to restrict abortions.
   ``Women's rights in every state are now in jeopardy,'' said
Judith L. Lichtman, president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund.
``Women across the country are outraged that this fundamental right
can be taken away.''
   In its ruling, the court stopped short of overturning a historic
1973 decision that granted women the right to abortions. But it
permitted the state of Missouri to enforce several provisions
designed to restrict abortions not necessary to save life, and
opened the way for other states to follow suit.
   The court also said it would hear two new abortion cases next
term.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a key abortion opponent in Congress,
called the decision ``a major victory for the pro-life cause.''
   Judith Widdecombe, founder of Reproductive Health Services, the
Missouri clinic involved in the court case, said: ``There's a
movement in this country that will not tolerate this. It will become
our Vietnam of the 1990s.''
   ``This ruling will sentence thousands of teen-agers each year to
bear children they are not ready emotionally, physically or
financially to raise,'' said the Center for Population Options.
   Lori Schroyer, spokeswoman for the California Abortion Rights
Action League, said ``access to abortion is going to be limited to
those of privilege. It will force people across state lines and into
back alleys.''
   Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said the decision ``made women wards
of the state. Their rights are all dependent on what states decide
to do, and I think that's a very sad day for America's families,
young people and everyone else who's concerned about rights and
choices.''
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,
said the decision ``chips away'' at abortion rights. Noting the
cases still to be heard, she said the court will have more
opportunities to limit abortion rights until ``pretty soon nothing
much will be left for a woman in controlling her reproductive life.''
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who calls abortion ``the greatest
human rights violation in history,'' said the ruling is ``the first
big step toward overturning Roe vs. Wade and another step toward the
end of the killing of prenatal infants.''
   Olivia Gans, a spokeswoman for the National Right to Life
Committee, said the decision ``recognized that the states have an
interest in protecting the life of'' the unborn child.
   ``This is a very important day for our group. We're talking about
allowing the people of America the decision whether or not they are
comfortable with allowing abortion on demand,'' she said.
   But Susan Liss, director of People for the American Way, said the
ruling ``paves the way for a state by state bloodletting that could
be among the most painful in our history.''
   Abortion-rights groups said the ruling shifts the battlefield on
the issue from the courts to the political arena, and promised to
make abortion an issue in elections throughout the country.
   ``Every person who stands for election in this country is going
to have to answer,'' Yard said.
   Lichtman said ``the handwriting is on the wall _ we can no longer
depend on the courts to protect this fundamental right of women to
make the most private and intimate decisions about their
reproductive lives.''
   Randall Terry, founder and national director of Operation Rescue,
said the decision opens the door to a reversal of Roe vs. Wade.
   ``It's a faltering step under which children will continue to be
murdered, but this decision indicates that Roe's days are
numbered,'' said Terry, whose organization is known for its protests
outside abortion clinics.
   But Sarah Weddington, a Dallas attorney who successfully argued
the Roe vs. Wade case in 1973, said that while the decision is
effective immediately, said ``it will have no practical implication
until state legislatures pass new laws.
   ``So in terms of is abortion legal or illegal in the various
states, tomorrow it's going to be the same as today. But what we are
going to see is a tremendous surge of legislative activity in all of
the state legislatures depending on which ones are in session and
which ones are not,'' she said.
   Despite that reassurance, many women appeared to be fearing the
worst.
   At Women's Health Services Inc., a Pittsburgh abortion clinic,
executive director Sue Roselle, said, ``The telephones are ringing
off the hook. Women are saying, `I want my abortion now before they
change the law.'''
   ``Women will mourn this day,'' said Janet Benshoof of the
American Civil Liberties Union. ``The right of privacy should be
secured by the Constitution. American women should not have their
rights up to a vote in every state legislature.'
   The National Abortion Federation said that ``whether a woman can
exercise her constitutional right to abortion will increasingly
depend on where she lives, how much money she has and how far she is
able to travel.''

<HEAD>Chronology of Supreme Court Abortion Decisions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of the Supreme Court's
major abortion decisions:
   _Jan. 22, 1973. In Roe vs. Wade, the court for the first time
legalized abortion nationwide. The court, in an opinion by Justice
Harry A. Blackmun, based its 7-2 ruling on a woman's constitutional
right to privacy.
   The court said a woman's decision to have an abortion during the
first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor.
It said states may impose certain regulations during the second
trimester to protect the woman's health, and may take steps to
protect fetal life in the third trimester. State authority to
regulate abortions after the first trimester was not made absolute,
however.
   _Jan. 22, 1973. In Roe vs. Bolton, the court that same day struck
down by a 7-2 vote restrictions on facilities that could be used to
perform abortions. The decision gave rise to a new kind of medical
facility, the abortion clinic.
   _July 1, 1976. In Planned Parenthood vs. Danforth, the court, by
a 6-3 vote, said states cannot give husbands veto power over their
pregnant wives' decision to abort their pregnancies. By a 5-4 vote,
the court said that neither can parents of minor, unwed girls be
given an absolute veto over abortions.
   _June 20, 1977. In Maher vs. Roe, the court ruled 6-3 that states
have no legal obligation to pay for ``non-therapeutic'' abortions.
   _Jan. 9, 1979. In Colautti vs. Franklin, reached by a 6-3 vote,
the court reaffirmed its intention to give doctors broad discretion
in determining the timing of ``fetal viability'' _ when a fetus can
live outside the mother's womb. The justices said states may seek to
protect a fetus that has reached viability, but the determination is
up to doctors, not courts or legislatures.
   _July 2, 1979. In Bellotti vs. Baird, the court by an 8-1 vote
elaborated on its parental consent decision of 1976. It implied that
states may be able to require a pregnant, unmarried minor to obtain
parental consent to an abortion so long as the state law provides an
alternative procedure to parental approval, such as letting the
minor seek a state judge's approval instead.
   _June 30, 1980. In Harris vs. McRae, the so-called Hyde Amendment
was upheld by a 5-4 vote. The court said the federal government and
individual states are under no legal obligation to pay for even
medically necessary abortions sought by women receiving welfare.
   _March 23, 1981. In H.L. vs. Matheson, the court ruled by a 6-3
vote that states may require doctors consulted by some girls _ those
still dependent on their parents and too ``immature'' to decide such
matters for themselves _ to try to inform parents before performing
a requested abortion.
   _June 15, 1983. In three decisions called City of Akron vs. Akron
Center for Reproductive Health, Planned Parenthood of Kansas City
vs. Ashcroft and Simopolous vs. Virginia, the court, in a 6-3
ruling, said states and local communities may not require that all
abortions for women more than three months pregnant be performed in
a hospital.
   The court also struck down regulations that, among other things,
imposed a 24-hour waiting period between the signing of an abortion
consent form and the medical procedure and required doctors to tell
women seeking an abortion that a fetus is a ``human life.''
   _June 11, 1986. In Thornburgh vs. American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the court voted 5-4 to strike down
Pennsylvania abortion regulations somewhat similar to those it
invalidated in 1983. The court said states may not require doctors
to inform women seeking abortions about potential risks and about
available medical assistance benefits for prenatal care and
childbirth.
   In that decision, the court also struck down requirements that
doctors performing third-trimester abortions, which are rare, use
procedures least risky to a fetus capable of surviving outside the
womb, and that two doctors always be present for abortions performed
in the third trimester. Also invalidated was a regulation requiring
doctors to make a record, which could become available to the
public, of every abortion they perform.
   _Dec. 14, 1987. In Hartigan vs. Zbaraz, the court split 4-4. The
effect was to invalidate an Illinois law that could have made
abortions more difficult to obtain for some teen-agers.
   The decision was announced two months before Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy joined the court and replaced Justice Lewis F. Powell, who
had retired the previous June.
   _July 3, 1989. In a series of votes on Webster vs. Reproductive
Health Services, the court provided states with new authority to
limit a woman's right to abortion but stopped short of reversing its
1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   The justices restored key provisions of a law that a lower court
had invalidated for unduly interfering with the constitutional right
to abortion.
   The overall effect was to allow Missouri to restrict the use of
public money, medical personnel or facilities in performing abortion
procedures.
   One ruling requires doctors to determine, when possible, whether
a fetus at least 20 weeks old is capable of surviving outside the
womb, by testing lung capacity and conducting other tests.
   Other states now may follow Missouri's lead. The court also
appeared to invite further challenges to its 1973 ruling.

<HEAD>Producer Says Trade and Information Lead to Democratic Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The push for democratic change in such places
as eastern Europe and China comes about mainly from two major
changes around the globe, says a television documentary producer
whose study of democracy begins next week on the Public Broadcasting
System.
   ``The major factors are increasing international trade and the
increasingly widespread and electronic delivery of information,''
Patrick Watson, a veteran Canadian producer, said in a telephone
interview. ``As you increase the contact among people and increase
the flow of information, you get a push for democracy.''
   Watson turned his three-year, 30-nation project into a 10-hour,
10-part series, ``The Struggle for Democracy,'' which will begin
airing July 11 on PBS stations.
   Watson is particularly interested in China, where in 1964 he
produced and directed, ``The Seven Hundred Million,'' the first film
by a North American since the Communists took over the world's most
populous nation. Eight years ago, he hosted a Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation series, ``The Chinese.''
   As he sees it, the bloody repression last month of students in
Beijing resulted from the threats to the aging Chinese leadership
represented by the young intellectuals.
   ``Actually, the students are not particularly popular in China,''
he said. ``If there were an election, the students would be rejected
because the government has so tightly controlled the flow of
information over the years and has succeeded in painting outside
influences as subversive.''
   No reforms are likely in China until the current leadership dies
out or looses power, he said. ``When the old guard goes, you'll
likely see a push for change that will primarily take the form of
economic reforms because the economy has such trouble.
   ``That push, in turn, will open up trade and contact with
outsiders, and increase prosperity and that will begin the process
of change,'' Watson said. ``But it will be very slow. In the near
term, you'll see some softening up of the harsh process that you've
seen lately, but it will be a very long time and a very long road
before you see any real change.''
   Watson said his project taught him that ``democracy wears a
different face in whatever culture it exists.
   ``If the Soviets or the Chinese do some type of democracy, North
Americans will likely look at it and say that it doesn't look at all
like ours, but it may actually turn out to be a very functional
democracy for that culture,'' he said.
   The prime factors needed for democracy, according to the
producer, are ``a reasonable level of prosperity and economic
stability. It doesn't mean that democracy will occur if you have
those factors, but they are preconditions.''
   Another factor is some form of freedom of information.
   ``It is absolutely essential to have an informed constituency,''
Watson said. ``That's one of the things you saw in China, where
information was being faxed from the western nations back to
Beijing.''

   Where 444 American flags fly this Fourth of
July and all year 'round, Verna Wagner teaches her grandchildren to
count the 50 stars and 13 stripes and never burn the flag, no matter
what the Supreme Court ruled.
   ``We want them to learn about our country and about what the flag
stands for,'' Mrs. Wagner, 63, said this weekend. ``If they want to
burn the flag, we'd tell them to go to Cuba or Iran where it's okay
to do it.''
   Bill Stratter, 64, a former World War II Navy boatswain's mate
relaxing nearby at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Public Golf Course,
vowed never to let the colors burn for freedom of speech or anything
else.
   ``If you were desecrating the flag, I'd probably shoot you if I
had a gun in my hand,'' he said.
   Old Glory snaps row-on-row in the summer breeze at Hillcrest
Memorial Park cemetery, where a new flag was raised each of the 444
days American hostages were held in Iran from Nov. 4, 1979, to Jan.
20, 1981.
   Tom Flynn, owner of the 65-acre cemetery, later added a small
bronze marker and a perpetual flame for eight American servicemen
who died trying to rescue the hostages in 1980.
   One former hostage still returns occasionally, and daily a few
tourists or residents of this city of about 17,500 people near Ohio
stop by. Lately, newly hatched swans and mallards paddling in a
shallow pool among the flags keep visiting children happy.
   Mrs. Wagner's grandchildren, Jason Jackson, 3{, and Justin, 2,
were encouraged to look skyward.
   ``We're very patriotic,'' said their mother, Linda Jackson. ``I
want them to know about the United States.''
   ``The flags are beautiful and sometimes it's very inspiring
here,'' said cemetery Superintendent Jim Bigler, 40, who keeps each
banner flying atop 18-foot steel poles year round.
   ``I never think of myself as a big, giant patriot. I stand at
ballgames, but I don't always sing,'' Bigler said.
   ``The flag stands for 200 years of history, good times and bad
times, lives lost and lives born,'' he said. ``It's very
disrespectful to burn it. You're protesting all the things it stood
for in one shot and it stands for too much.''
   Don Wilson, 60, an Army veteran of Korea and manager of the VFW
golf course, said the Supreme Court went too far with last week's
5-4 ruling that flag burning is legal under the Constitution's First
Amendment protections of freedom of speech.
   ``I believe in the so-called civil rights, but where does it
stop?'' Wilson said. ``When you burn the flag, you're never going to
have a peaceful demonstration. People feel this deep down inside.''
   John Kukol, 66, incoming VFW commander and a Navy veteran of
World War II, said freedom of speech means it's okay to call
President Bush an obscenity, for example.
   ``But don't start monkeying around with the flag, buddy,'' Kukol
said. ``That's different.''
   ``I don't think our forefathers ever meant free speech to mean
having Commies burning the flag. It just shows how stupid the
Supreme Court is,'' said Robert Price, Democratic mayor of adjacent
Sharon.
   Several residents said they agreed with Bush in calling for a
constitutional amendment to protect the flag from desecration.
   ``If that's what it takes, we ought to do it,'' Mrs. Wagner said.
   ``Okay, the Supreme Court made the ruling,'' Wilson said. ``But
if enough people feel this way, let's change the Constitution. We
can overrule the Supreme Court.''
   But Bigler said it's easier to raise a flag than to amend the
Constitution to protect it.
   ``I think you should be very cautious when you're amending the
Constitution. You shouldn't rush into it willy-nilly,'' he said.
``But I guess if you just want to say `Wait a minute' on this issue,
you could come out looking very bad, very bad indeed.''

<HEAD>LaRouche Loses Supreme Court Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political extremist Lyndon LaRouche and six
others convicted in a scheme to defraud lenders of more than $30
million lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the
government unlawfully tried to silence LaRouche's political movement.
   LaRouche is serving a 15-year federal prison sentence for mail
fraud, conspiracy and scheming to defraud the Internal Revenue
Service. His co-defendants were given either three-year or five-year
sentences.
   U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. in Alexandria, Va.,
rejected LaRouche's claim that the government waged a politically
motivated vendetta against the four-time presidential candidate.
   In sentencing the defendants last January, Bryan said LaRouche's
vendetta claim is ``errant nonsense.''
   ``The idea that this organization is a sufficient threat to
anything that would warrant the government bringing a prosectuion to
silence them just defies human experience,'' the judge said.
   Prosecutors said LaRouche and the others conspired to default on
some $34 million in loans from political supporters.
   LaRouche has taken extreme views on a variety of issues. For
example, he has supported a quarrantine of AIDS victims and has
charged that Queen Elizabeth is involved in drug trafficking.
   His political organization, the National Caucus of Labor
Committees, has its headquarters in Leesburg, Va.
   Convicted along with him were William Wertz, Edward Spannaus,
Michael Billington, Dennis Small, Paul Greenberg and Joyce
Rubinstein. Wertz and Spannaus each were sentenced to five years in
prison; the others to three years.
   The case is In re LaRouche, 88-1990.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing construction fell for the fourth
straight month in May, but public building projects led overall
construction spending to a 1.3 percent increase, the government
reported Monday.
   The Commerce Department said total private and public
construction totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $421.3
billion in May, after falling 0.8 percent in April. May's spending
level was 3.3 percent above the pace of May 1988.
   But private construction remained flat at $335.1 billion at an
annual rate following a 1.6 percent drop in April. Residential
building was off 1.6 percent from April, including a 2.5 percent
drop in new housing units to an annual rate of $138.6 billion.
   The decline in new housing represented the fourth consecutive
drop. It included a 1.5 percent decrease in single-family homes to
an annual rate of $115 billion and a 6.7 percent drop in multifamily
units to $23.6 billion.
   Analysts believe the pace of residential building will pick up
later this year as mortgage interest rates decline. Fixed rates
peaked in March at an average of 11.22 percent and fell to 10.07
percent by last week, according to a survey by the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp.
   Rates had been driven up by the Federal Reserve as it tightened
credit in an attempt to halt inflation.
   ``I think we'll see private construction numbers moving up again,
probably by the end of the summer'' as rates continue to fall, said
David Berson, chief ecnomist for the Federal National Mortgage
Association.
   Non-residential construction spending rose 2.6 percent to an
annual rate of $98.7 billion, the department reported, and Berson
said he expects that to continue as industry expands in anticipation
of rising exports.
   ``We would expect some improvement as firms try to meet export
demands,'' he said. ``Some of that will necessitate increased
spending on new plants, new industrial buildings.''
   Public construction was up 6.7 percent in May to an annual rate
of $86.2 billion, despite a drop in the highway and street spending
from $27.9 billion to $27.4 billion. The conservation and
development category more than doubled from $3 billion to $6.6
billion.
   ``That was probably due to one or two big construction projects
that came on line and will go back down next month,'' Berson said.
   Berson said he expects overall public construction to remain flat
for the remainder of the year because of federal budget constraints.

<HEAD>High Court Asks Bush Administration About Nebraska AIDS tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today asked the Bush
administration whether it thinks a Nebraska state agency should be
able to test its employees for AIDS.
   The court said it wants to hear what Justice Department lawyers
think about rulings that blocked the agency from imposing mandatory
blood testing of employees who come into direct contact with the
mentally retarded people the agency serves.
   The justices are not expected to say whether they will review the
Nebraska case until sometime in the court's 1989-90 term, which
begins in October.
   The Eastern Nebraska Human Services Agency in 1987 adopted a
policy requiring certain employees to submit to blood testing for
the virus associated with AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune
system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections. The virus most often is spread through close contact
with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons.
   The incurable condition is believed caused by an unusual virus,
now called human immunodeficiency virus or HIV, discovered in France
and the United States.
   The Nebraska agency's rationale for imposing AIDS testing is that
retarded clients who engage in violent or aggressive conduct, such
as biting or scratching, risk contracting the disease from an
infected employee.
   The policy also sought to test employees for hepatitis.
   After employees of a five-county subagency called the Eastern
Nebraska Community Office of Retardation sued, U.S. District Judge
Lyle Strom barred enforcement of the policy.
   The judge said the evidence showed that the risk of an agency
staffer transmitting AIDS to a client, assuming that any staffer is
infected with the disease, ``is extremely low, approaching zero.''
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Strom's ruling last
Feb. 6.
   ``Under the facts established in this case, the district court
properly enjoined (the) policy as an unreasonable search and seizure
under the (Constitution's) Fourth Amendment,'' the appeals court
said.
   In the appeal acted on today, the state agency urged the justices
to create ``a special needs exception'' to the Fourth Amendment's
general ban on government searches and seizures in the absence of
probable cause.
   The appeal said the 8th Circuit court ruling ``imposes an unduly
stringent standard'' on the agency ``to justify the mandatory blood
testing ... (for) ensuring a safe training and living environment
for mentally retarded citizens.''
   The chief victims of AIDS have been homosexual men and
intravenous drug users, although a small percentage of cases are
attributed to transfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual
contact and spread from infected pregnant women to their offspring.
   As of May 31, 1989, AIDS had been diagnosed in 97,193 Americans,
of whom more than half, or 56,468, have died since June 1, 1981,
according to the CDC. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.
   The case is Eastern Nebraska Community Office of Retardation vs.
Glover, 88-1805.

   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, battered by sex
and bribery scandals, lost the weekend municipal election in Tokyo
and appeared to be in a shaky position for parliamentary contests
later this month.
   The Liberal Democrats, who have governed Japan since 1955,
dropped nearly one-third of their 63 seats in the 128-member Tokyo
Metropolitan Assembly.
   National issues, such as an unpopular new sales tax, dominated
the Tokyo election and it was considered a sign of the party's
prospects in the vote July 23 for half the seats in Parliament's
upper chamber.
   If parliament is dissolved over public discontent with the
government, the large Liberal Democratic majority in the more
powerful lower house also could be at risk later this year.
   Although the Liberal Democrats won 43 seats in the Tokyo assembly
in Sunday's election, the opposition Socialist Party nearly tripled
its strength to 29.
   ``The tax and the question of political reform ... had their
effect on our assemblymen,'' said Yasunosuke Daigo, an 11-term
Liberal Democratic member of the city assembly. Daigo, a member
since 1947, lost his seat.
   Ryutaro Hashimoto, party secretary-general, described the result
as a ``total defeat'' and said: ``We must study it, and use it as a
lesson as we prepare for the national elections.''
   Along with 29 Socialist members, up from 11 in the outgoing
127-seat assembly, seven Socialist-backed independent candidates
were elected, giving the party a total of 36 votes.
   Komei, or Clean Government, won 26 seats, the Communist Party 14
and the Democratic Socialist Party three. Four minor parties got one
seat each and independent candidates without Socialist backing
captured two seats.
   Opposition parties hold a combined 85. In the last assembly,
their total was just one more than the Liberal Democrats.
   ``Things are going to change,'' said Keiko Chiba, a member of the
national parliament's upper house, in a speech at Socialist
headquarters congratulating a party candidate.
   Many Socialists attributed the party's gains to voter
dissatisfaction with the Liberal Democrats rather than Socialist
policies.
   ``After all this time under the LDP administration, the voters
decided they could no longer sit by and watch in silence,'' said
Takako Doi, party chairwoman.
   Ichiro Shimizu, a Tokyo ward politician, said: ``Much of the vote
that went to us was anti-LDP.''
   The ruling party's popularity has suffered from the Recuit
influence-buying scandal, which reached the highest ranks of the
establishment and forced the resignation a month ago of Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, and a sex scandal afflicting his
successor, Sousuke Uno.
   Before the Tokyo elections, several Liberal Democratic leaders
acknowledged the possibility of a loss but said they hoped to win at
least 50 seats. When the results came in, party leaders said they
had underestimated the effect of the scandals and opposition to the
new 3 percent sales tax.
   ``This isn't a question of right or left,'' said Asae Uemura, who
won an assembly seat on the Socialist ticket. ``It's an angry
reaction from the wallets of mothers, like me, who must do the daily
shopping.''
   She said opposition to the tax, imposed April 1, was ``tens and
tens times more important than the scandals.''
   Uno is plagued by reports that he kept several paid mistresses.
He denies the reports.
   He also blamed the tax for his party's defeat. Although the prime
minister is party president, the Tokyo branch asked him to stay out
of the municipal campaign.
   Representatives of several party factions, including two former
prime ministers, were reported to have agreed last week that Uno
should resign for the good of the party.
   About 5.18 million people, or 58.7 percent of Tokyo's eligible
voters, cast ballots, up from 53.5 percent in 1985, when the last
city election was held.
   Thirty-three women were among the candidates this time, and 17
won.

<HEAD>Bush Calls on Soviets to Begin Withdrawing Troops from Poland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has called on the
Soviet Union to begin withdrawing its troops from Poland, asserting
``there is no danger at all of an invasion of Poland from the West.''
   Bush said he was not seeking to ``inflame'' the situation in
Poland or ``do anything that is going to cause a crisis.''
   But, he said in an interview with a group of Polish reporters,
``Very candidly, I'd like to see Soviet troops out.''
   Bush granted the interview last Friday in Washington. The
transcript was released today by Bush's vacation White House. The
president is enjoying an extended Independence Day holidy at his
oceanside summer home.
   The president said that, when he visits Poland next week on his
way to the seven-nation economic summit in Paris, ``I'm going to
feel free to speak out about...what we hold dear and what Polish
Americans think and what we want to see about a freer, a more whole
Europe.''
   It was the first time Bush has called for an immediate, complete
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Poland. Last month while attending
a NATO summit in Brussels, the president proposed a reduction in
conventinal forces in eastern Europe to no more than 275,000 each
for NATO and Warsaw Pact nations.
   Bush said in his interview with Polish reporters that he still
hoped to ``press forward with'' that ``very bold proposal.''
   At the same time, he conceded it was probably unrealistic to
envision a complete withdrawal of all Soviet forces in eastern
Europe ``as long as we have this tremendous disparity in
Soviet-deployed troops.''
   But, he said, Poland would be a good place for the Soviets to
start.
   ``I would like to see them start withdrawing of the troops from
Poland because I think there is no danger at all of an invasion of
Poland from the West,'' Bush said. ``And I don't think anybody in
Poland thinks there's a danger of invasion of Poland from the West.''
   Bush gave the interview to reporters from three Polish news
agencies.

<HEAD>High Court Agrees to Look at States' Limits on Lawyers' Ads</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to take a fresh
look at how far states may go to prohibit advertising by lawyers.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by an Illinois lawyer
censured for saying on his professional letterhead he is a civil
trial specialist certified by the National Board of Trial Advocacy,
a private organization.
   The court will hear arguments in the case during its next term
beginning in October, with a ruling likely in 1990.
   The Illinois Supreme Court, which disciplines that state's
lawyers, last February upheld the state rule against advertising
oneself as a certified civil trial specialist.
   The state court censured Gary E. Peel of Edwardsville, Ill., who
since 1983 included the specialist reference on his letterhead.
   The state court said Peel's use of the reference is misleading
because it makes it appear he is more qualified than other lawyers
who do the same type of work. The state court also rejected Peel's
arguments that the rule violates his constitutional free-speech
rights.
   The state court said Peel's claim that he ``is certified as a
civil trial specialist by the National Board of Trial Advocacy is
misleading because it tacitly attests to (his) qualifications as a
civil trial advocate. Because not all attorneys licensed to practice
law in Illinois are certified by the NBTA, the assertion is
tantamount to a claim of superiority by those attorneys who are
certified.''
   The state court noted that only lawyers who specialize in patent,
trademark and admiralty law in Illinois are allowed to advertise
their specialties.
   The reason for allowing those exceptions is to help the public
find attorneys who practice those unusual specialties, the state
court said.
   The NBTA, based in Boston, said it uses ``rigorous standards'' to
determine whether any civil or criminal trial advocate is entitled
to its certification.
   It said it has certified more than 1,000 lawyers nationwide.
   The Supreme Court in a key 1977 ruling struck down a ban on all
lawyer advertising, ruling that it violated free-speech rights.
Since then, the court has upheld some regulation of lawyer ads but
struck down other rules.
   The case is Peel vs. Attorney Registration and Disciplinary
Commission of Illinois, 88-1775.

<HEAD>Soviets, Americans Prepare for Arms Control Experiment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of American scientists and congressmen
prepared Monday to fly to the Black Sea for experiments on whether
radiation devices can detect the presence of nuclear warheads aboard
ships.
   Rep. Bob Carr, D-Mich., described the experiment as a
``confidence-building measure'' to aid the superpowers as they
negotiate a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty to slash nuclear
arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   Four Soviet navy ships will take part in the experiment
Wednesday, said Albert G. Makerov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences,
which is sponsoring the project, along with two liberal private
American organizations, the Natural Resource Defense Council and the
Federation of American Scientists.
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy said there would be no comment
on the experiment because it does not involve U.S. authorities. The
United States is aware of the project, and ``embassy officers have
met with the congressmen,'' said the spokeswoman, Margot Squire.
   U.S. Navy officers have balked at allowing Soviet inspectors
aboard U.S. warships and have objected to Soviet proposals to limit
nuclear-tipped cruise missiles under the proposed START agreement.
   The Reagan and Bush administrations have maintained that
virtually no verification regime could prevent either superpower
from disguising shipboard nuclear warheads as conventional weapons,
thus frustrating any attempt control nuclear weapons at sea.
   The Soviets have cited the impasse over sea-launched cruise
missiles as a major obstacle to completion of the strategic treaty.
   Makerov and physicist Tom Cochran, who leads the U.S. team, said
the experiment would begin Wednesday at the Black Sea port of Yalta.
   The scientists will use radiation detection devices to determine
their ability to spot nuclear weapons material aboard the Soviet
missile cruiser Slava, which will be carrying a nuclear-tipped
cruise missile. American scientists said they believed the weapon
would be either an SS-N-12 or the newer SS-N-22.
   Cochran said his group would use portable devices to detect the
emission of gamma rays, given off by some forms of uranium, and
neutrons, given off by plutonium.
   The American team, which includes physicists from Stanford
University and Princeton University, plans to use two types of
detectors to be carried aboard the Slava.
   It was unclear how close the Soviet navy would allow the American
scientists to approach the Slava's cruise missiles, which are stored
and launched from the deck.
   While the American devices are in use, Soviet scientists will
conduct similar tests using detectors in a helicopter and a vessel
near the Slava.
   Preliminary results are expected Thursday, although later
calculations would be made to compare the U.S. and Soviet findings,
Cochran said.
   ``We need to take this one step at a time,'' said Cochran,
acknowledging that radiation devices alone were unlikely to provide
adequate verification of the numbers of nuclear weapons aboard any
naval vessel.
   Cochran said the tests ``cannot guard against efforts to evade
any treaty by squirreling nuclear weapons in the bowels of a
warship.''
   The Slava will be a good test subject because ``there are no

weapons might be concealed, he said.
   A sister ship to the Slava, the Marshal Ustinov, is due to visit
Norfolk, Va., home of the U.S. Atlantic fleet, on July 25. The port
call is part of growing military cooperation between the United
States and the Soviet Union that was reached new heights last month
with a visit to previously closed Soviet bases by the chairman of
the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William Crowe.
   Despite growing military-to-military cooperation, the Pentagon
opposes the Yalta experiments because U.S. officials are ``trying to
get the best of both worlds, the benefits of the tests without the
responsibility,'' Carr said.
   Also observing the test are Reps. John Spratt, D-S.C., and James
Olin, D-Va.

<TEXT>
   A collection of essays portraying the official
version of how China's government crushed pro-democracy
demonstrators has gone on sale under the title ``Quelling
Counterrevolutionary Rebellion _ Study Material.''
   At the state-run Xinhua Book Store on Wangfujing, Beijing's main
shopping avenue, copies of the 149-page paperback are stacked
together with popular self-education manuals.
   Some readers scanned the book Monday, but few were buying it.
   ``It's usually ordered by groups who have to study it,'' a
saleswoman said.
   The book, part of a massive propaganda campaign, begins with
excerpts from a June 9 speech by senior leader Deng Xiaoping, in
which he accuses a small number of people of plotting to overthrow
the Communist Party and socialist system.
   Deng praises the soldiers who took part in the bloody June 3-4
suppression of the student-led movement in Beijing, and says China
will continue its open-door and reform policies under Communist
Party rule.
   The book, which sells for the equivalent of 48 cents, also
reprints an April 26 editorial from the People's Daily newspaper
that condemned the student demonstrations and alleged they
represented a ``conspiracy'' to overthrow the government. Students
had demanded the government retract the editorial.
   The book also contains extracts from talks between Premier Li
Peng and student leaders on May 18, five days after the students
began a hunger strike to press for democratic reforms. Students had
complained it was more of a speech by Li than an exchange of views.
   ``Quelling Counterrevolutionary Rebellion'' presents witnesses'
accounts of the ``rebellion,'' along with official reports of how
``rioters'' attacked soldiers and troops were ``forced'' to
retaliate.
   Other articles denounce dissident astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, who
took refuge in the U.S. Embassy with his wife shortly after the
crackdown in which hundreds, and possibly thousands, of unarmed
students were killed.
   China Youth Publishers have printed 120,000 copies of the book.
   A sign outside Xinhua Book Store says anyone interested can order
photographs of the suppression of the uprising, but few people took
notice of it.
   Nearby, an old man was busy dealing with readers eager for an
annual compilation of ``Family Doctor,'' a monthly magazine with
practical medical information, and ``America as a Riddle,''
featuring essays by dissident writer Liu Binyan.
   ``This is the best-seller,'' he said, pointing at Liu's book.

<HEAD>Sunscreens Being Erected to Protect Ailing Treaty Oak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treaty Oak, whose canopy has provided
friendly shade during the dog days of summer, is itself getting some
cover by way of giant sunscreens to help save the venerable tree
from a poisoning attack.
   Park employees today began erecting 65-foot poles next to the
ailing, 400-year-old Treaty Oak and later this week will hang
40-foot screens.
   ``There is tender foliage up there. It would be real easy to fry
it,'' said Paul Roberts, a city environmental specialist.
   Leaves have turned brown and fallen off the beloved 65-foot tree
since a potent herbicide was poured at its base in what police said
was an attempt by a 45-year-old farm-supply salesman to cast a spell
or a curse.
   Police on Thursday charged Paul Stedman Cullen with criminal
mischief in the attack. He could receive 20 years in prison.
   Roberts said the screens will reduce the sunlight hitting the
tree by 50 percent to 60 percent. ``We're coming into a real
stressful period for the tree. We can expect upper 90s, 100 degrees
for the next two months,'' he said.
   The soil also is being replaced to a depth of about 30 inches,
and 12 sprinklers are shooting water on the tree five minutes every
hour.
   Legend has it Stephen F. Austin, the father of Texas, made peace
with the Indians under the tree's branches. Indians regarded the
tree with superstitious reverence, contending that tea made from its
acorns had the power to return straying lovers or protect warriors,
the Austin American-Statesman reported.
   Over the years, couples have married or gotted engaged under the
canopy of the tree, which has a 127-foot limb spread and is 52.5
inches in diameter at chest height.

   Ben Wright, who played the Nazi Herr
Zeller in the movie ``The Sound of Music,'' died of complications
from heart surgery. He was 74.
   The character actor, who lived in North Hollywood, died Sunday at
St. Joseph's Medical Center. He underwent heart-bypass surgery June
23.
   Wright was born in London and studied at the Royal Academy of
Dramatic Arts.
   He arrived in Hollywood in 1946 and starred in radio programs
including ``Sherlock Holmes'' and ``Have Gun, Will Travel.'' The
actor also did voices for Disney animated hits such as ``101
Dalmatians'' and ``The Jungle Book.''
   In ``The Sound of Music,'' the 1965 film based on the Rodgers and
Hammerstein musical, he played a Nazi sent to ensure that Baron von
Trapp reported for German military duty.
   Several months ago, Wright finished recording the speaking role
of Sir Grimsby in the animated Disney feature ``The Little Mermaid.''
   Survivors besides his wife, Muriel, include a son and daughter.
   Services were to be private.

<HEAD>Witness Backs Alibi of Palme Murder Suspect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVA JANZON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A witness Monday backed the alibi of the
man charged with killing Prime Minister Olof Palme, saying he saw
the accused at a train station 18 miles away about the time of the
downtown shooting.
   The witness, Algot Asell, later had his credibility questioned by
a newspaper reporter who testified Asell had changed his story.
   Asell was the first witness in Stockholm District Court to
support the alibi of defendant Christer Pettersson, who served a
jail sentence for manslaughter and has a long record of drug and
alcohol abuse.
   Pettersson, 42, has denied killing Palme. Asell was the last
scheduled witness in the trial, which began May 29 and is to end in
mid-July following summaries.
   Palme, who dominated Swedish politics for more than a decade, was
shot Feb. 28, 1986, as he walked home with his wife from a late
movie.
   Asell, 68, said he saw Pettersson waiting for a train at Marsta
Station between 11 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. on the night of the murder.
Palme was killed at 11:21 that night.
   The train station is about 18 miles from the crime scene and more
than 30 minutes by train.
   Newspaper reporter Sakari Pitkanen later cast doubt on Asell's
credibility, saying his testimony differed from what the witness had
said in an interview.
   Pitkanen, a reporter for the Aftonbladet newspaper, testified
that Asell's account, particularly on the train schedule and his
sighting of Pettersson, differed from what he said in a June
interview.
   Asell said he took the last train from Marsta and listened to the
midnight radio news after arriving home, according to Pitkanen.
   He said Asell changed his story after it was pointed out there
was no midnight radio news that night.
   Other witnesses have testified they saw Pettersson waiting for
Palme outside the movie theater and following Palme down the street.
Palme's wife identified Pettersson as the man she saw a few feet
away when her husband fell, fatally wounded.
   Asell said he did not notice the exact time he saw Pettersson,
but he said he bought a chocolate bar near the train station just
before the store closed at 9:30 p.m., then went into a nearby
restaurant until one of the last trains left the station at 11 p.m.
or 11:30 p.m.
   Asell said he knew Pettersson because they lived in the same
neighborhood. Also Monday, Ulf Akansson, who shared an apartment
with Pettersson for seven months, said Pettersson was an admirer of
Palme and never carried a gun.

   Firefighters from four states hope to contain by tonight a
1,200-acre blaze that destroyed a home near Grand Junction, Colo.
California firefighters fought a brush fire apparently sparked by
children playing with fireworks.
   Dry, hot weather hampered firefighters in those states and in
Utah, where lightning began several blazes in the eastern part of
the state and a cigarette-caused fire burning in the median of an
interstate closed the highway.
   The lightning-sparked blaze that forced 50 people from their
homes west of Grand Junction was the only one not contained of
several wild fires that have scorched parts of Colorado since
Wednesday.
   Gusts that came with 96-degree heat Sunday blew embers over fire
lines, starting numerous small blazes that frustrated fire crews
from Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and Idaho. A home and a shed were
reported destroyed.
   ``It must have been consuming an acre every 15 seconds,'' said a
resident, Tim Menger. ``Flames you would just not believe, just like
out of an Indiana Jones movie, just swept across that valley back
there.''
   Paul Hefner, commander of the firefighting effort, said the
intensity of the fire as it razed the home was stunning.
   ``I have never seen anything burn like that in my life,'' he
said. ``Twisted metal and melted glass, nails that melted right
through the glass.''
   Campfires and fireworks were banned over the July Fourth weekend
in the San Juan National Forest near Durango.
   ``It's so dry, one firecracker will be enough,'' said Kris
Damsgaard of the U.S. Forest Service.
   In California, the largest and most devastating of last week's
blazes, a 7,840-acre fire near Lake Elsinore, was surrounded over
the weekend, and firefighters hoped to extinguish it by Tuesday.
   Firefighters today also hoped to contain a 300-acre blaze in San
Bernardino County, 60 miles east of Los Angeles. Witnesses reported
three youngsters playing with smoke bombs Sunday, Forest Service
spokeswoman Lindsay Maierhofer said.
   About 300 firefighters battled the blaze overnight.
   ``The temperatures are hot and the terrain is very difficult,''
Ms. Maierhofer said. ``Some of the canyons dip in and slope back,
and the air tankers are having a difficult time going in to do a
direct drop. It's kind of scary.''
   In central Utah, a fire near Scipio Pass led authorities to close
Interstate 15 twice on Sunday.

<HEAD>IRA Takes Responsibility for Killing Soldier, Airport Bombs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility
Monday for a bomb that killed a British soldier in West Germany as
his family watched and for a bomb attack at a Belfast airport.
   Cpl. Steven Smith died Sunday in West Germany when he opened his
car door and a bomb exploded. His wife and their four young children
were injured. Hanover police said they found and defused a bomb in
another soldier's car nearby.
   Three bombs exploded early Monday at Belfast's Harbor Airport,
damaging two parked airplanes and shattering windows in airport
buildings, but causing no injuries.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called the bombers cowards, and
said Smith's killing was ``doubly horrific because the family both
were injured and saw what happened.''
   ``It just shows precisely the mentality of a terrorist,'' Mrs.
Thatcher said. ``It was another cowardly attack on people who were
very vulnerable, who do everything possible to defend us and keep
freedom and democracy safe.''
   The IRA, which is fighting to oust Britain from Northern Ireland
and unite the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman
Catholic Republic of Ireland, made its claims to Belfast news media.
   ``We are forced to take our struggle beyond Ireland because the
British public are restricted by their government from learning of
its failure in Ireland and the resistance to its rule,'' it said in
a statement.
   This apparently referred to the ban imposed by the British
government last October on broadcast interviews with members of the
IRA, their supporters, and other groups involved in violence in
Northern Ireland.
   The IRA statement said Smith, 31, a rations officer with the
Royal Tank Regiment, ``could be the last soldier to die as a result
of the British occupation of Ireland if the British government was
to accept that after 20 years its military and political policies in
our country have failed.''
   Next month marks the 20th anniversary of the arrival of British
troops in Northern Ireland. More than 2,700 people have since been
killed, 418 of them soldiers. Five soldiers have died in IRA actions
in West Germany, Holland and Belgium in the past 14 months.
   Smith's father, Brian, said from his home in Dewsbury, northern
England: ``I never dreamed in a million years that this would happen
to my son. He has become another innocent victim. The bombers who
did this can't have a heart when they must have known children could
have been victims.''
   The explosion occurred on a residential street on Hanover's
outskirts where many British military families live.
   Pete Brown, a spokesman for the British Rhine Army in
Moenchengladbach, said Smith's wife, Tine, and their four children
aged 2 to 11, were hospitalized in satisfactory condition.
   Hanover police issued composite sketches of two suspects in their
30s whom witnesses saw nearby shortly before the attack.
   Three bombs exploded at Belfast's Harbor Airport about 2:30 a.m.,
eight minutes after the airport received a telephone warning, police
said.
   One bomb damaged two prototype aircraft developed by Shorts
Brothers Ltd. The other two bombs exploded near the air traffic
control tower and on the airfield, police said.
   Short Brothers, Northern Ireland's largest employer, owns Harbor
Airport, the second-largest in the province after Aldergrove Airport
outside Belfast.

<HEAD>Expedition After A Piece of WWII Plane Under Greenland Ice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM E. SCHULZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight Southern pilots begin a four-day flight to
Greenland on Wednesday for an expedition aimed at reaching one of
eight aircraft buried deep in the icecap since they crash-landed
during World War II.
   The two B-17 bombers and six P-38 Lightning fighters are buried
under 265 feet of ice and snow that has accumulated since bad
weather and low fuel forced them to abort a flight to England in
1942.
   The Greenland Expedition Society, headed by Atlanta architect
Richard Taylor and Pat Epps, an aviation pioneer and owner of Epps
Aviation, located the planes with subsurface radar and magnetometers
last summer.
   This year they want a piece of one aircraft, a B-17 named ``Big
Stoop,'' in part to help persuade investors to finance an effort to
bring the planes back to the United States next year.
   They are estimated to be worth $5 million if repaired.
   ``If we could get a control wheel out of a B-17, it would be
ideal,'' Taylor said, but even just a piece of metal cut out of its
skin ``would be tangible proof we found the aircraft.''
   The team plans to bore a 2-inch hole to the plane with a steam
borer and cut out a piece of metal with a coring device, then bore a
wider shaft so they can reach the plane and try to get inside.
   Their 3{ tons of equipment ing above the clouds are insulated
from the sights, sounds and smells of rural America. It has not
always been so. Come along on a nostalgic trip with the Jones
family, whose expeditions in the early and middle 1920s from Tulsa,
Okla., to grandmother's house in Eau Claire, Wis., were as removed
from the present day as that day was removed from the Pony Express
and covered wagons.

   The missing keys to the new 1925 Paige sedan not only caused an
uproar in the Jones family, but the whole payroll of the Commercial
Hotel of Nebraska City was engaged in a futile search.
   My father's famous temper climbed through the night and was not
improved the next morning when the local locksmith confessed he was
baffled by the trick lock on the gearshift. After considerable
shouting into feeble long distance lines, an expert was summoned
from Omaha.
   Dick, my big brother, who had driven the Paige into town, was the
obvious object of suspicion and outrage. His usual ploy, ``You had
it last'' (pointing at me) wouldn't work, for I was too young to
drive. The expert came, installed a new lock, relieved my father of
$150, and the family drove out of town a day late in a cloud of
steam.
   At dusk, two days later, Dick and I were walking across a bridge
at Zumbrota, Minn. Dick paused, and drew out of his pocket the
original Paige keys.
   ``Where'd you find them?''
   ``The darned things slipped down a hole in the lining of my
pants,'' he said.
   The keys arced prettily into the murky waters of the Zumbro
River. As far as I know, they are still there.
   The expeditions of the Jones family in the early and middle 1920s
from Tulsa, Okla., to my grandmother's house at Eau Claire, Wis.,
were as removed from the present day as that day was removed from
the Pony Express and covered wagons.
   Prudence dictated that we go by rail, but all except Dad would
spend the summer and Grandmother's Willis Knight wouldn't be large
enough. So, starting in 1921, we made touring history and tested the
family's mutual toleration severely.
   In the Midwest, there was no highway system, federal or state.
Some enthusiast had blazed what was called the Omaha-Tulsa Trail,
and OTs, splashed crudely in green paint, appeared occasionally on
telephone poles between towns. But, mostly, you picked your way from
village to village by asking farmers. Occasionally, you used the
``Blue Book.''
   A Blue Book in good condition should be worth its weight in
platinum now, for practically all motorists dropped them in the
ashcans when numbered highways came. As a bit of Americana of the
times, they were marvelous. Example:
   Bugville, mile 0, proceed north on Main from Elm 4.3 miles to
large white house right side with red barn. Left to mile 9.1 at
Cherry Creek bridge. Right, across railroad ...
   The trouble with the Blue Book was that people repainted houses,
barns burned, and the county often put in a better road a mile east.
But Blue Book users saw so much more because they paid attention.
   City people (Tulsa in 1920 with pop. 72,000 was a city) lived in
the ambiance of the 20th century, but you didn't get far out of town
before you were back in the 19th. After the sun went down, the
country grew dark except for the firefly flickers of coal-oil wicks.
   Motels had not been invented, so daring motorists stayed with the
railroad-riding drummers in town hotels, generally named after the
proprietor with the word ``House'' tacked on the end.
   Indoor plumbing had arrived, generally one bathroom to a floor.
For the benefit of those just dropping in to lunch there was often a
tin basin on the back stoop and you threw the soapy water on the
grass.
   Fortunately, I was born into the post-bedbug era, for by the
early '20s country hotel sheets were changed every day. But neither
were accommodations homogenized. The modern phenomenon of climatized
rooms as alike as peas from coast to coast was far in the future.
   Upscale county seat hotels had menus, but most others served
``family style.'' At 6 a.m. the board groaned with calories and
cholesterol _ stewed prunes, oatmeal, thick cream, fried eggs, ham,
bacon, corn fritters, waffles _ and at 6:30 most of the spearing,
reaching, toothpick-sucking mob would dash off with their battered
sample cases for the early trains.
   There was still much individuality in hotel design and decor. At
the leading hostelry in Red Wing, Minn., one entered the bedroom
through the bathroom.
   The principal hotel in Atlantic, Iowa, had once been a
chiropractic college. A full-size skeleton lurked around the corner
as you came upstairs, no doubt filling late arrivals with amusement.
   When we came, exhausted and on a superheated evening, to Sabetha,
Kan., we were directed to what was described as the ``best hotel on
the Grand Island.'' We didn't know that the Grand Island Railroad
was only 100 miles long and passed through practically nothing.
   That night, we three children lay in our underwear crosswise on
the bed, gasping for breath. There was a movie going on beneath the
thin floor, and you could sort of follow the plot with the help of
the girl at the piano.
   When she played Rachmaninoff's Prelude you knew the rustlers were
sneaking up on the corral. When she played the finale of William
Tell's Overture you could tell the posse was in full cry. Heavy
banging on the bass keys told you the gun battle was joined. And,
when she swung softly into ``Hearts and Flowers,'' it said that
wedding bells were not far off and the movie would soon be over.
   Getting up to Grandma's wouldn't have been as exciting if only
the parents and children had been traveling. But, since we were
making a summer of it, the car also contained the cat, our black
Belgian shepherd, Blig, and Tony, the African gray parrot.
   The cat, which loved comfort more than it loved the family, had
to be re-caught every morning, for it remembered the day before.
Until the wheels moved, we would stuff it in a covered basket.
   The survival power of Tony was amazing, for Dad was a furious
driver and the car was in the air most of the time. Tony braced
himself with one foot on the perch and the other clinging to the
wire of the cage.

   Andrei A. Gromyko, the tough-negotiating former
foreign minister who survived five Kremlin leadership changes and
weathered the dramatic turns of East-West relations in a
half-century of public life, has died at age 79.
   Soviet news reports said Gromkyo, who oversaw Soviet foreign
policy for 28 years, died Sunday.
   The cause of death was not announced, but a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said Friday that Gromyko had been hospitalized after
surgery for a vascular problem _ heart or circulatory system _ that
was not further identified.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced the death to the Supreme
Soviet legislature today.
   ``The deputies at the session, with a minute of silence, paid
homage to the memory of the outstanding government and party
leader,'' Radio Moscow said.
   The official Tass news agency said the grim-faced Gromyko was
``one of the major Soviet diplomats and statesmen of the senior
generation'' and added that the country ``lost one of its most
prominent leaders.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said of Gromyko,
``He was part of our history, with all its good sides and all its
bad sides.'' He said Gromyko recently had been criticized for
emphasizing Soviet relations with the United States at the expense
of Kremlin ties with other countries.
   The television news program ``Vremya'' reported Gromyko's funeral
will be Wednesday. It said he will be buried at Novodevichy
Cemetery, where former leader Nikita S. Khrushchev, ex-president
Anastas I. Mikoyan and ex-foreign minister Vyacheslav M. Molotov are
interred.
   Gorbachev will not delay a trip to France on Tuesday to attend
the funeral, Gerasimov said.
   President Bush said he was sending condolences to Gromyko's son,
Anatoly, and U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock praised Gromyko as
courteous and considerate ``even when relations were difficult.''
   As a diplomat, ambassador and foreign minister, Gromyko helped
forge the Soviet-American World War II alliance, joined in drafting
the U.N. Charter and sat in on superpower talks that shaped the face
of the modern world.
   Gromyko survived several purges and outlasted Soviet leaders
Josef Stalin, Khrushchev, Leonid I. Brezhnev, Yuri V. Andropov and
Konstantin U. Chernenko. He served as Soviet ambassador to the
United States, Britain and the United Nations, which he helped found.
   Tass once said he took part in ``the most important foreign
political developments of our time.''
   Abba Eban, Israeli's foreign minister from 1966 to 1974, praised
Gromyko as ``no doubt ... the high priest of diplomacy.'' He cited
Gromyko's statement, before the 1947 U.N. decision on the partition
Palestine, that a possibility was to divide the land into a Jewish
and Arab state.
   ``This was a pleasant surprise because ... the assumption was
that the Stalinist regime was anti-Zionist and anti-Jewish in
principle,'' said Eban.
   After Gorbachev rose to power in March 1985 and revamped the
leadership, Gromyko was gradually eased into retirement.
   He was replaced as foreign minister that summer by Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, a newcomer to foreign affairs, and named to the then
largely ceremonial post of president.
   He stepped down from the Communist Party's ruling Politburo Sept.
30 and was replaced as president by Gorbachev a day later. In April,
Gromyko lost his last post, membership in the policy-making Central
Committee.
   Gromyko ended his career gracefully, unlike many other Soviet
officials who were abruptly stripped of posts and written out of
official history books as new Kremlin chiefs came on board.
   Archie Brown, a Soviet affairs specialist at Oxford University in
Britain, said today that Gromyko will be remembered ``as a fairly
formidable figure and certainly as an operator and as a survivor.''
   But, he added in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp.,
Gromyko was not ``an especially enlightened Soviet leader.''
   Gromyko generally took a backseat to the leaders he served during
the years that the Soviet Union cemented its grip on Eastern Europe
and rose to become a nuclear power.
   Indeed, some observers attributed his longevity to his political
flexibility and his apparent failure to make a bid for personal
power.
   Khrushchev once said in his presence, ``If I tell him to sit on
an iceberg, he'll stay there and freeze, but he won't move.''
   Gromyko instead served as the articulator of Kremlin positions to
the world through his speeches. But perhaps his most important work
came at bargaining tables from Yalta to Geneva, where he helped
negotiate everything from allied war strategy to the SALT nuclear
weapons treaties.
   Gromyko gained a reputation as ``Mr. Nyet'' for his tough
negotiating style. He was nicknamed ``Grim Grom'' for his stony
countenance.
   His craggy face beneath horn-rimmed glasses became instantly
recognizable to the outside world.
   Andrei Andreyevich Gromyko was born July 18, 1909, to
Byelorussian peasants.
   Joining the Communist Party in 1931, he first studied economics
but switched to a Foreign Ministry whose ranks were depleted by
Stalin's purges.
   At 39, Gromyko was the youngest ambassador in Soviet history. But
he proved his expertise by helping put together the alliance against
Nazi Germany.
   His career took him to Tehran, Potsdam and Yalta, where one story
says Winston Churchill threw cigar stubs at him after he repeatedly
whispered into Stalin's ear that he should demand Germany's
unconditional surrender.
   Rising through the ranks of the foreign service, Gromyko served
as ambassador to Britain in 1952-53.
   Khrushchev appointed Gromyko foreign minister in 1957, and he
helped the Kremlin leaders turn the Soviet Union into America's
equal as a world power.
   Two days before the Cuban missile crisis broke out in October
1962, Gromyko calmly told President John F. Kennedy there were no
Soviet missiles in Cuba.
   While he presented his poker face to the world, many of those who
knew Gromyko said his stoic features masked a sharp wit.
   Among the anecdotes that became favorites with journalists was
his reply when asked if he had enjoyed breakfast one day.
   ``Perhaps,'' Gromyko said.
   Gromyko and his wife, Lydia Dmitriyevna, had a son, Anatoly, who
has directed the African Institute of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences. They also had a daughter, Emilia, and several
grandchildren.
   The private lives of Soviet leaders are shrouded in secrecy, and
it was not immediately known which relatives survived.

   Iran on Monday marked the first
anniversary of the U.S. downing of a civilian jetliner with a
memorial service at the airport where the flight originated, and it
demanded full compensation for the victims.
   The July 3, 1988, shootdown by the USS Vincennes, in which 290
people were killed, was a crime that showed the ``Great Satan'' _
the United States _ exercised ``state terrorism,'' Iran's Foreign
Ministry said.
   At a memorial ceremony at the airport in Bandar Abbas, the
director of civil aviation announced the airport had been renamed
``The International Airport of the Tir 12 Martyrs,'' Tehran Radio
reported. According to the lunar Persian calendar, last year's date
of Tir 12 coincided with July 3, 1988.
   Iran Air Flight 655 had left the city of Bandar Abbas en route to
Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, when the USS Vincennes in the
Persian Gulf picked it up on radar and mistook it for an Iranian jet
fighter.
   The sailors, who had been involved in a skirmish with Iranian
gunboats earlier that day, opened fire, downing the A300 Airbus and
killing all 290 people aboard. Most of the victims were Iranians.
   At the airport ceremony, Civil Aviation Director Mohammad Nabi
Habibi unveiled a painting depicting the incident and displayed
several parts of the aircraft pulled from the gulf, said the
broadcast, monitored in Nicosia.
   ``The martyrs of this incident were another group of innocent
people who fell victims of American atrocities,'' it quoted him as
saying.
   Relatives of the victims, clergymen, and air force and civil
aviation officials attended the ceremony, Tehran Radio said.
   The Foreign Ministry demanded full compensation for all victims,
but it did not mention a figure. Washington has indicated it is
ready to pay compensation, but it wants to be sure none of the money
goes to the Iranian government.
   The Iranian daily newspaper Jomhuri Islami urged other countries
to ``counter U.S. brutalities.''
   The daily Abrar said an editorial, ``The Iranian nation will
never forget U.S. crimes.''
   ``This has kindled a fire in the heart of the Iranian nation
which would not be extinguished without the elimination of U.S.
criminals,'' it said.
   The English-Language Kayhan International said the incident
``proved that Tehran's relations with Washington are irreparable.''
   ``Those who feel the situation may change in the near future are
advised to go through the pictures of mutilated bodies of Iranians
on board the Airbus,'' it said.
   More than 200 relatives of the victims are suing designers and
manufacturers of the ship's radar system, a spokesman for the group
said Sunday in Abu Dhabi.
   Nagib Ghafoor, spokesman for the Flight 655 Litigation Group,
said the suit was filed June 28 in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco on behalf of relatives of 83 victims.
   Pentagon analysts have said split-second decisions aboard the
Vincennes were affected by the inability of radar operators to match
the plane's radar trace with digital direction, altitude and speed
information displayed on another screen.
   Ghafoor said the suit named the General Electric Co. ``and other
entities which designed and manufactured the radar equipment on
board the USS Vincennes.''
   A spokesman for GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., said Sunday the
company had not seen the suit.

<HEAD>Norma ``Jane Roe'' McCorvey Disappointed By Abortion Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norma McCorvey, the ``Jane Roe'' whose case
led to the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion, said
she took today's court decision allowing states to restrict abortion
``very personally.''
   ``It saddens my heart very deeply to know that poor women are
once again going to be out there going to backstreet abortions and
possibly be mutilated and not have the right to choose,'' she said
in appearance on the Cable News Network show ``Sonya Live in LA.''
   McCorvey, a housekeeper in Dallas, said she was disappointed by
today's decision, but ``I am, however, somewhat grateful they are
not reversing Roe vs. Wade at this point. I do realize at another
point they will be chipping away from it.''
   In its 5-4 decision today, the high court gave states new
authority to limit a woman's right to an abortion, including
authority to ban use of public facilities for abortions.
   But the court stopped short of reversing its 1973 Roe vs. Wade
ruling, which said a woman's decision to have an abortion during the
first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor.
   The landmark decision resulted from a lawsuit filed by McCorvey
under the pseudonym Jane Roe. In 1969, McCorvey, unmarried,
unemployed and pregnant, went to her family doctor and asked for an
abortion, which was illegal in Texas. Her doctor refused, and she
didn't like what she saw at an illegal abortion clinic, spurring the
lawsuit.
   McCorvey said today that during her first pregnancy, ``I wasn't
financially able to go to New York or any other state where
abortions were legal.''
   By the time the Supreme Court ruled, McCorvey had given birth to
a daughter and given the child up for adoption. In 1971, she had
another child, which she also gave up for adoption.
   McCorvey today vowed to continue her efforts on behalf of
legalized abortion.
   ``I will definitely fight,'' she said as she appeared on CNN with
feminist lawyer Gloria Allred of Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Former Party Leader Janos Kadar Hospitalized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Communist Party leader Janos
Kadar was hospitalized Monday with pneumonia and severe breathing
and circulatory problems, the official MTI news agency said.
   Kadar, 77, was listed in serious condition, the terse report said.
   When Kadar was stripped of his last political posts in May after
leading Hungary for 32 years, senior communist leaders said he was
gravely ill, but they did not specify the ailment.
   In May 1988, Kadar was named honorary chairman of the ruling
Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, which he had led since Kremlin
troops and tanks crushed an anti-Soviet revolt in 1956.
   Under Karoly Grosz, who succeeded Kadar as party general
secretary but has himself been forced to share power with three
prominent party reformers, Kadar's political legacy increasingly has
come into question.
   After guiding Hungary to relative prosperity and tolerance by the
1970s, Kadar was seen as an obstacle to political and economic
reform in the 1980s.
   Questions remain about Kadar's role at the end of the 1956
revolt. He emerged as head of a new government to replace that of
premier Nagy as the uprising was violently crushed.
   In recent interviews published by the weekly Magyarorszag, Kadar
was quoted as saying the fate of Imre Nagy and other revolt leaders
was his ``personal tragedy.''
   Nagy and other leaders of the uprising were honored as national
martyrs June 16.
   Kadar was last reported to have attended a Communist Party
Central Committee meeting in April, where other participants said he
gave a long, rambling speech.
   A letter sent to Kadar accused him of making mistakes during his
rule. Kadar, who has not been seen in public since, replied in a
published response that he had always acted only for the good of
Hungary.

   Entertainer Lola Falana returned to the Las
Vegas stage over the weekend, showing no sign of the multiple
sclerosis that forced her from the footlights 1{ years ago and
threatened to end her career.
   She left out her sizzling dance routines and concentrated more on
singing, but Falana, 46, displayed the old zest as she performed
everything from Broadway hits to Michael Jackson songs.
   ``You don't know how I need you,'' she told her audience, which
included longtime friend Sammy Davis Jr., during her show Sunday at
the Sands Hotel and Casino.
   She took time to thank God for the improvement in her condition
and praised Davis for giving her a break as a teen-ager, when she
got a major role in Davis' Broadway show ``Golden Boy.''
   ``I wouldn't trade my life with anyone on this earth,'' she said,
her voice breaking. ``For in these past two years, God has opened me
up and taught me what life is all about.''
   Falana nearly died in 1983 when she suffered peritonitis
following abdominal surgery. Then in November 1987 she learned she
had multiple sclerosis, a neurological disease that short-circuits
the central nervous system. For a time, she was partially paralyzed,
but the worst symptoms of the disease have eased.
   In mid-June she was asked to play a weekend date at the Sands
Hotel.
   ``They called and asked me `Can you be ready by Friday (June
30),''' Falana recalled last week. ``I told myself it's now or never
_ I guess I'll have to be ready. I'm not into being a chicken.''

   Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson were
among the stars who performed for a crowd of 6,000 to raise money _
and awarness _ for the Indian cause.
   They, along with Neil Young, John Denver, Jackson Browne and
others, donated their talents Sunday at the Paha Sapa Music
Festival. Proceeds will go to a college, an alcohol- and
family-counseling center and a radio station serving Pine Ridge
Indian Reservation.
   Kristofferson said he's worried that the civil rights of Indians
and other people have been violated in recent years. He said he
hoped the concert raised awareness of the troubles Indians face.
   ``I think the main thing a concert can do is bring public
attention to the problems,'' he said.
   And he said he hopes the concert moved some people to be ``as
concerned about abuses to people as they are concerned about abuses
to the flag.''
   Browne told reporters before the benefit concert that he'd go
anywhere to play at a sober Fourth of July concert. It was billed as
a ``clean and sober'' event.

   Former WBA heavyweight boxing champion
John Tate decided at the last minute he would keep his Olympic medal
but leave most of his other personal belongings on the auction
block, a spokeswoman said Monday.
   Auctioneers spent more than three hours Sunday selling the
one-time World Boxing Association champ's personal items.
   The 34-year-old Tate, whose finances are being handled by a
conservator, was allowed to recover some of his possessions before
Sunday's sale by Powell Auction Co.
   ``He got his Bronze medal and he did pick out some boxing gloves
and some photographs, some furniture _ enough to furnish his
apartment _ and some fishing equipment,'' said auction company
spokeswoman Barbara Phillips.
   Among the items left to be sold off were a pair of stereo
speakers that brought $1,200 and boxing shorts that went for $45.
Tate's robes sold for $200 while his boxing gloves brought $250 to
$300, Mrs. Phillips said. She declined to say how much the total
take was.
   Tate won a bronze medal in boxing in 1976. In October 1979, he
became WBA champ, but he lost the title five months later.
   In 1983, Tate signed a court paper authorizing the appointment of
a conservator to handle his affairs. He has since unsuccessfully
attempted to have the conservatorship dissolved.
   He has blamed his personal difficulties over the years on a
cocaine problem.
   Knox County Chancellor Sharon Bell ordered the auction to raise
money for Tate's living expenses.

   It was a hit-or-miss affair until Dianne Reeves
came on stage. Then the promise that had been a 50th anniversary
concert for the Blue Note record label became reality.
   Miss Reeves' mature talent and elegant presence redeemed the
concert, which amply illustrated the pitfalls such amalgam
programming invites.
   The Friday night event at Carnegie Hall, part of the JVC Jazz
Festival, began auspiciously with Brazilian pianist Eliane Elias
playing some driving music with a five-piece band. She then changed
pace, warming the audience with a lyrical solo piece.
   The Tony Williams Quintet succeeded the Brazilian sound with its
own high-intensity brand of jazz. The quintet, led by drummer Tony
Williams, went its own way; it failed to build on the mood.
   After the intermission, electrical guitarist Stanley Jordan
played a long, rambling, self-indulgent set. Although a trio was
listed on the program to back him up, they failed to appear on
stage. It wasn't clear whether his solos had used up his time
allotment or whether he had just forgotten about his fellow
musicians.
   Just when it appeared the evening might be a musical failure,
Miss Reeves appeared.
   She sang some standards _ ``My Funny Valentine,''``The Nearness
of You,''``How High the Moon'' _ and gave them her own signature.
She sang a slaves' field song and some blues.
   Throughout her performance, her wit and warmth charmed the
audience.
   Shortly after she came on stage, she confided that it was her
Carnegie Hall debut. By the end of her segment, the crowd was
willing to give her the deed to the place.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   ABORTION
   
   The court provided states with new authority to limit a woman's
right to abortion. The court, ruling on one of the most contentious
issues of the decade, stopped short of reversing its 1973 decision
legalizing abortion.
   In splintered voting, the justices restored key provisions of a
Missouri law that a lower court had invalidated for unduly
interferring with women's constitutional right to abortion. And the
court appeared to invite further challenges to is landmark 1973
abortion decision.
   The case is Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, 88-605.
   
   GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED RELIGIOUS DISPLAYS
   
   The court ruled that some government-sponsored religious displays
are permissible as long as they do not have ``the effect of
promoting or endorsing religious beliefs.'
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said displaying a Christmas nativity
scene inside the Allegheny County Courthouse in Pittsburgh violates
constitutionally required separation of church and state because it
appears to endorse Christian principles.
   But the court unanimously permitted a Hanukkah menorah on the
front steps of the City-County Building in Pittsburgh because that
display also included a Christmas tree and a sign saluting liberty,
which the court said produced an overall secular purpose.
   The case is County of Allegheny vs. American Civil Liberties
Union, 87-2050.
   
   RIGHT TO DIE
   
   The court, accepting its first-ever ``right to die'' case, agreed
to decide whether a Missouri family may order removal of a
life-support system from a woman in an irreversible vegetative
condition.
   The justices said they will review a ruling that bars the parents
of Nancy Cruzan, 31, from ordering doctors to remove the tube.
   The case is Cruzan vs. Missouri Department of Health, 88-1503.
   
   LAWYER ADS
   
   The court agreed to take a fresh look at how far states may go to
prohibit advertising by lawyers.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by an Illinois Lawyers
censured for saying on his professional letterhead he is a civil
trial specialist certified by the National Board of Trial Advocacy,
a private organization.
   The case is Peel vs. Attorney Registration and Disciplinary
Commission of Illinois, 88-1775.
   
   STUDENT RELIGIOUS GROUPS
   
   The court agreed to review a 1984 federal law requiring that
student religious groups be given the same access as other
extra-curricular clubs to public high school facilities.
   The justices, setting the stage for an important ruling on
church-state relations, said they will decide whether a student
Bible study group must be allowed to meet at an Omaha, Neb., high
school after class hours.
   The case is Westside Community Schools vs. Mergens, 88-1597.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>STATE TAXING POWERS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   
   The court ordered reargument in its next term of an important
battle over state taxing powers.
   The justices will hear arguments over related cases from Arkansas
and Florida when they return to the bench in October for their
1989-90 term.
   At issue is whether a business that successfully challenges a
state tax as an undue burden on interstate commerce is entitled to
be refunded money it paid before the tax was invalidated.
   The cases are McKesson vs. Division of Alcoholic Beverages,
88-192, and American Trucking Association vs. Smith, 88-325.
   
   LAROUCHE
   
   The court turned down an appeal by political extremist Lyndon
LaRouche and six others convicted in a scheme to defraud lenders of
more than $30 million.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the
government unlawfully tried to silence LaRouche and the six others.
   LaRouche is serving a 15-year federal prison sentence for mail
fraud, conspiracy and scheming to defraud the Internal Revenue
Service. His co-defendants were given either three year or five-year
sentences.
   The case is In re LaRouche, 88-1990.
   
   HELMSLEY
   
   The court told a federal appeals court to restudy a lawsuit
accusing billionaire hotel owner Harry Helmsley and his business
partners of fraud in connection with a New York city condominium
converions.
   The justices said the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals should
restudy Helmsley's case in light of their June 26 ruling in a
Minnesota telephone rates case.
   The appeals court ruled that Helmsley and the others may be sued
under a federal law, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act or RICO.
   The case is Helmsley vs. Beauford, 88-1523.
   
   AIDS TESTS
   
   The court asked the Bush administration whether it thinks a
Nebraska state agency should be able to test its employees for AIDS.
   The court said it wants to hear what Justice Department lawyers
think about rulings that blocked the agency from imposing mandatory
blood testing of employees who come into direct contact with th
ementally retarded people the agency serves.
   The case is Eastern Nebraska Community Office of Retardation vs.
Glover, 88-1805.
   
   ANTI-DUMPING REGULATIONS
   
   The court allowed the government to enforce anti-dumping
regulations in a way foreign companies and importers of foreign
goods say improperly impeded international trade.
   The court, without comment, rejected a Canadian steel producer's
appeal, which was supported by an American export-import association
and an international consumers group.
   The case is Algoma Steel vs. U.S., 88-1781.
   
   ENGLISH LANGUAGE
   
   The court rejected appeals by Hispanics challenging Florida's
designation of English as the state's official language.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that an election
giving official-language status to English did not violate the
federal Voting Rights Act.
   The cases are Delgado vs. Smith, 88-1327, and In Re Delgado,
88-1329.

   A 5-year-old boy was in critical condition
Monday after a wolf held in captivity attacked him.
   Peter Lemke of Kenyon walked into Doug Earl's yard Saturday
morning, possibly to play with Earl's pet wolf, said police Officer
Troy Dunn. The boy was found semiconscious at about 11:30 a.m. with
the wolf standing over him, he said.
   The boy had multiple lacerations and punctures on the front and
back of his abdomen and on his legs and arms, Dunn said, and was
taken to St. Marys Hospital in Rochester.
   The wolf was temporarily quarantined, Dunn said.
   The Department of Natural Resources would intervene if it was
determined the wolf was taken from the wild said Nancy Hunder of the
DNR's enforcement division. If the owner shows a receipt that the
animal was taken from a private game farm, it is treated as a dog,
horse or any other domestic animal.

   Excerpts from the Supreme Court's opinions
Monday in the abortion case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health
Services, as written for the court by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   This appeal concerns the constitutionality of a Missouri statute
regulating the performance of abortions. The United States Court of
Appeals for the Eight Circuit struck down several provisions of the
statute on the ground that they violated this court's decision in
Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and cases following it. We noted
probable jurisdiction and now reverse. ...
   In June 1986, the governor of Missouri signed into law Missouri
Senate Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1596 (hereinafter Act
or statute), which amended existing state law concerning unborn
children and abortions.
   The Act consisted of 20 provisions, 5 of which are now before the
court. The first provision, or preamble, contains ``findings'' by
the state legislature that ``the life of each human being begins at
conception,'' and that ``unborn children have protectable interests
in life, health, and well-being.'' The Act further requires that all
Missouri laws be interpreted to provide unborn children with the
same rights enjoyed by other persons, subject to the federal
Constitution and this court's precedents. Among its other
provisions, the Act requires that, prior to performing an abortion
on any woman whom a physician has reason to believe is 20 or more
weeks pregnant, the physician ascertain whether the fetus is viable
by performing ``such medical examinations and tests as are necessary
to make a finding of the gestational age, weight, and lung maturity
of the unborn child.'' The Act also prohibits the use of public
employees and facilities to perform or assist abortions not
necessary to save the mother's life, and it prohibits the use of
public funds, employees, or facilities for the purpose of
``encouraging or counseling'' a woman to have an abortion not
necessary to save her life.'' ...
   Decision of this case requires us to address four sections of the
Missouri Act: (a) the preamble; (b) the prohibition on the use of
public facilities or employees to perform abortions; (c) the
prohibition on public funding of abortion counseling; and (d) the
requirement that physicians conduct viability tests prior to
performing abortions. ...
   The Act's preamble, as noted, sets forth ``findings'' by the
Missouri legislature that ``the life of each human being begins at
conception,'' and that `unborn children have protectable interests
in life, health, and well-being.'' The Act then mandates that state
laws be interpreted to provide unborn children with ``all the
rights, privileges, and immunities available to other persons,
citizens, and residents of this state,'' subject to the Constitution
and this court's precedents. In invalidating the preamble, the Court
of Appeals relied on this court's dictum that ``a state may not
adopt one theory of when life begins to justify its regulation of
abortions. It rejected Missouri's claim that the preamble was
``abortion-neutral,'' and ``merely determined when life begins in a
nonabortion context, a traditional state prerogative.'' ...
   In our view, the court of Appeals misconceived the meaning ...
which was only that a state could not ``justify'' an abortion
regulation otherwise invalid under Roe v. Wade on the ground that it
embodied the state's view about when life begins. ...
   It will be time enough for federal courts to address the meaning
of the preamble should it be applied to restrict the activities of
appellees in some concrete way. Until then, this court ``is not
empowered to decide ... abstract propositions, or to declare, for
the government of future cases, principles or rules of law which
cannot affect the result as to the thing in issue before it.'' We
therefore need not pass on the constitutionality of the Act's
preamble. ...

   Section 188.210 provides that ``it shall be unlawful for any
public employee within the scope of his employment to perform or
assist an abortion, not necessary to save the life of the mother,''
while 188.215 makes it ``unlawful for any public facility to be used
for the purpose of performing or assisting an abortion not necessary
to save the life of the mother.'' The Court of Appeals held that
these provisions contravened this Court's abortion decisions. We
take the contrary view. ...
   The (appeals) court reasoned that the ban on the use of public
facilities ``could prevent a woman's chosen doctor from performing
an abortion because of his unprivileged status at other hospitals or
because a private hospital adopted a similar anti-abortion stance.''
It also thought that ``such a rule could increase the cost of
obtaining an abortion and delay the timing of it as well.''
   We think that this analysis is much like that which we rejected
in (four other cases.) As in those cases, the state's decision here
to use public facilities and staff to encourage childbirth over
abortion ``places no governmental obstacle in the path of a woman
who chooses to terminate her pregnancy.'' ...
   Missouri's refusal to allow public employees to perform abortions
in public hospitals leaves a pregnant woman with the same choices as
if the state had chosen not to operate any public hospitals at all.
The challenged provisions only restrict a woman's ability to obtain
an abortion to the extent that she chooses to use a physician
affiliated with a public hospital. This circumstance is more easily
remedied, and thus considerably less burdensome than indigency which
``may make it difficult _ and in some cases, perhaps, impossible _
for some women to have abortions'' without public funding. Having
held that the state's refusal to fund abortions does not violate Roe
v. Wade, it strains logic to reach a contrary result for the use of
public facilities and employees. ...
   (Three previous cases) all support the view that the state need
not commit any resources to facilitating abortions, even if it can
turn a profit by doing so. ... Thus we uphold the Act's restrictions
on the use of public employees and facilities for the performance or
assistance of nontherapeutic abortions.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: nontherapeutic abortions.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Missouri Act contains three provisions relating to
``encouraging or counseling a woman to have an abortion not
necessary to save her life. Section 118.205 states that no public
funds can be used for this purpose; 188.210 states that public
employees cannot, within the scope of their employment, engage in
such speech; and 188.215 forbids such speech in public facilities.
The Court of Appeals ... held that all three of these provisions
were unconstitutionally vague and that ``the ban on using public
funds, employees and facilities to encourage or counsel a woman to
have an abortion is an unacceptable infringement of the woman's 14th
Amendment right to choose an abortion after receiving the medical
information necessary to exercise the right knowingly and
intelligently.''
   Missouri has chosen only to appeal the Court of Appeals'
invalidation of the public funding provision ... A majority of the
court agrees with appellees that the controversy ... is now moot ...
We accordingly direct the Court of Appeals to vacate the judgment of
the District Court with instructions to dismiss the relevant part of
the complaint. ...
   Section 188.029 of the Missouri Act provides:
   ``Before a physician performs an abortion on a woman he has
reason to believe is carrying an unborn child of 20 or more weeks
gestational age, the physician shall first determine if the unborn
child is viable by using and exercising that degree of care, skill,
and proficiency commonly exercised by the ordinarily skillful,
careful, and prudent physician engaged in similar practice under the
same or or similar conditions. In making this determination of
viability, the physician shall perform or cause to be performed such
medical examinations and tests as are necessary to make a finding of
the gestational age, weight, and lung maturity of the unborn child
and shall enter such findings and determination of viability in the
medical record of the mother.''
   As with the preamble, the parties disagree over the meaning of
this statutory provision. ...
   The Court of Appeals read 188.029 as requiring that after 20
weeks ``doctors must perform tests to find gestational age, fetal
weight and lung maturity.'' The court indicated that the tests
needed to determine fetal weight at 20 weeks are ``unreliable and
inaccurate'' and would add $125 to $250 to the cost of an abortion.
...
   We must first determine the meaning of 188.029 under Missouri
law. Our usual practice is to defer to the lower court's
construction of a state statute, but we believe the Court of Appeals
has ``fallen into plain error'' in this case. ...
   We think the viability-testing provision makes sense only if the
second sentence is read to require only those tests that are useful
in making subsidiary findings as to viability. ...
   The viability-testing provision of the Missouri Act is concerned
with promoting the state's interest in potential human life rather
than in maternal health. ...
   In Roe v. Wade, the court recognized that the state has
``important and legitimate'' interests in protecting maternal health
and in the potentiality of human life. During the second trimester,
the state ``may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in
ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.''
   In the first place, the rigid Roe framework is hardly consistent
with the notion of a constitution case in general terms, as ours is,
and usually speaking in general principles, as ours does. The key
elements of the Roe framework _ trimesters and viability _ are not
found in the text of the Constitution or in any place else one would
expect to find a constititional principle. ...
   In the second place, we do not see why the state's interest in
protecting potential human life should come into existence only at
the point of viability, and that there should therefore be a rigid
line allowing state regulation after viability but prohibiting it
before viability. ...
   The tests that 188.029 requires the physician to perform are
designed to determine viability. ... We are satisfied that the
requirement of these tests permissibly furthers the state's
interests in protecting human life and we therefore believe 188.029
to be constitutional.
   The dissent takes us to task for our failure to join in a ``great
issues'' debate as to whether the constitutional includes an
``unenumerated'' general right to privacy. ...

   The dissent also accuses us of cowardice and illegitimacy in
dealing with ``the most politically divisive domestic legal issue of
our time.'' There is no doubt that our holding today will allow some
governmental regulation of abortion that would have been prohibited
under the language (of other cases). ...
   The dissent's suggestion ... that legislative bodies, in a nation
where more than half of our population is women, will treat our
decision today as an invitation to enact abortion regulation
reminiscent of the dark ages not only misreads our views but does
scant justice to those who serve in such bodies and the people who
elect them.
   Both appellants and the United States have urged that we overrule
our decision in Roe v. Wade. The facts of the present case, however,
differ from those at issue in Roe. Here, Missouri has determined
that viability is the point at which its interest in potential human
life must be safeguarded. In Roe, on the other hand, the Texas
statute criminalized the performance of all abortions, except when
the mother's life was at stake. This case therefore affords us no
occasion to revisit the holding of Roe, which was that the Texas
statute unconstitutionally infringed the right to an abortion
derived from the due process clause, and we leave it undisturbed. To
the extent indicated in our opinion, we would modify and narrow Roe
and succeeding cases.
   Because none of the challenged provisions of the Missouri Act
properly before us conflict with the Constitution, the judgment of
the Court of Appeals is reversed.

   Excerpts from Justice Sandra Day O'Connor: Concurring in part and
concurring in the judgment:
   Nothing in the record before us or the opinions below indicates
that subsections 1 (1) and 1 (2) of the preamble to Missouri's
abortion regulation statute will affect a woman's decision to have
an abortion. Justice Stevens ... suggests that the preamble may also
`interfere with contraceptive choices' ... because certain
contraceptive devices act on a female ovum after it has been
fertilized by a male sperm.
   The Missouri act defines `conception' as `the fertilization of
the ovum of a female by the sperm of a male' ... and invests `unborn
children' with `protectable interests in life, health and
well-being' ... from `the moment of conception.'
   Justice Stevens asserts that any possible interference with a
woman's right to use such post-fertilization contraceptive devices
would be unconstitutional under Griswold vs. Connecticut ... and our
subsequent contraception cases. ...
   Similarly, certain amici suggest that the Missouri act's preamble
may prohibit the developing technology of in-vitro fertilization, a
technique used to aid couples otherwise unable to bear children in
which a number of ova are removed from the woman and fertilized by
male sperm. This process often produces excess fertilized ova
(`unborn children' under the Missouri act's definition) that are
discarded rather than reinserted into the woman's uterus. ...
   It may be correct that the use of postfertilization contraceptive
devices is constitutionally protected by Griswold and its progeny
but, as with a woman's abortion decision, nothing in the record of
the opinions below indicates that the preamble will affect a woman's
decision to practice contraception. ... Neither is there any
indication of the possibility that the preamble might be applied to
prohibit the performance of in-vitro fertilization. I agree with the
court, therefore, that all of these intimations of
unconstitutionality are simply too hypothethical to support the use
of declaratory judgment procedures and injunctive remedies in this
case. ...
   Similarly, it seems to me to follow directly from our previous
decisions concerning state or federal funding of abortions ... that
appellees' facial challenge to the constitutionality of Missouri's
ban on the utilization of public facilities and the participation of
public employees in the performance of abortions not necessary to
save the life of the mother ... cannot succeed. ...

   In its interpretation of Missouri's ``determination of
viability'' provision ... the plurality has proceeded in a manner
unnecessary to deciding the question at hand. I agree with the
plurality that it was plain error for the Court of Appeals to
interpret the second sentence of (the Missouri statute) ... as
meaning that ``doctors must perform tests to find gestational age,
fetal weight and lung maturity.'' ...
   Unlike the plurality, I do not understand these viability testing
requirements to conflict with any of the court's past decisions
concerning state regulation of abortion. ...
   It is clear to me that requiring the performance of examinations
and tests useful to determining whether a fetus is viable, when
viability is possible, and when it would not be medically imprudent
to do so, does not impose an undue burden on a woman's abortion
decision. ...
   Accordingly, because the Court of Appeals misinterpreted (the
Missouri statute) ... and because, properly interpreted, (the
statute) ... is not inconsistent with any of this court's prior
precedents, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.

<NOTE>Excerpts from Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Brennan and</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Justice Marshall join, concurring in part and dissenting in part:
   Today, Roe vs. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and the fundamental
constitutional right of women to decide whether to terminate a
pregnancy, survive, but are not secure. Although the court
extricates itself from this case without making a single, even
incremental change in the law of abortion, the plurality and Justice
Scalia would overrule Roe ... and would return to the states
virtually unfettered authority to control the quintessentially
intimate, personal and life-directing decision whether to carry a
fetus to term.
   Although today, no less than yesterday, the Constitution and the
decisions of this court prohibit a state from enacting laws that
inhibit women from the meaningful exercise of that right, a
plurality of this court implicitly invites every state legislature
to enact more and more restrictive abortion regulations in order to
provoke more and more test cases, in the hope that sometime down the
line, the court will return the law of procreative freedom to the
severe limitations that generally prevailed in this country before
Jan. 22, 1973.
   Never in my memory has a plurality announced a judgment of this
court that so foments disregard for the law and for our standing
decisions.
   Nor, in my memory, has a plurality gone about its business in
such a deceptive fashion. At every level of its review, from its
effort to read the real meaning out of the Missouri statute, to its
intended evisceration of precedents and its deafening silence about
the constitutional protections that it would jettison, the plurality
obscures the portent of its analysis.
   With feigned restraint, the plurality announces that its analysis
leaves Roe ``undisturbed,'' albeit ``modified and narrowed.'' But
this disclaimer is totally meaningless. The plurality opinion is
filled with winks and nods, and knowing glances to those who would
do away with Roe explicitly, but turns a stone face to anyone in
search of what the plurality conceives as the scope of a woman's
right under the Due Process Clause to terminate a pregnancy free
from the coercive and brooding influence of the State.
   The simple truth is that Roe would not survive the plurality's
analysis, and that the plurality provides no substitute for Roe's
protective umbrella. I fear for the future. I fear for the liberty
and equality of the millions of women who have lived and come of age
in the 16 years since Roe was decided. I fear for the integrity of,
and public esteem for, this court.

<TEXT>WASHINGTON: this court.    No one contests that under the Roe framework,
the State, in order to promote its interest in potential human life, may
regulate and even proscribe non-therapeutic abortions once the fetus becomes
viable. ... If, as the plurality appears to hold, the testing provision
simply requires a physician to use appropriate and medically sound tests
to determine whether the fetus is actually viable when the estimated gestational
age is greater than 20 weeks ... then I see little or no conflict with
Roe. Nothing in Roe, or any of its progency, holds that a State may not
effectuate its compelling interest in the potential life of a viable fetus
by seeking to ensure that no viable fetus is mistakenly aborted because
of the inherent lack of precision in estimates of gestational age.   
A requirement that a physician make a finding of viability, one way or
the other, for every fetus that falls within the range of possible viability,
does no more than preserve the State's recognized authority.  
Although, as the plurality correctly points out, such a testing requirement
would have the effect of imposing additional costs on second-trimester
abortions where the tests indicated that the fetus was not viable, these
costs would be merely incidental to, and a necessary accommodation of,
the State's unquestioned right to prohibit non-therapeutic abortions after
the point of viability.    In short, the testing provision, as construed
by the plurality, is consistent with the Rose framework and could be upheld
effortlessly under the current doctrine.    Thus, `not with a bang, but
a whimper,' the plurality discards a landmark case of the last generation
and casts into darkness the hopes and visions of every woman in this country
who had come to believe that the Constitution guaranteed her the right
to exercise some control over her unique ability to bear children.   
The plurality does so either oblivious or insensitive to the fact that
millions of women and their families have ordered their lives around
the right to reproductive choice, and that this right has become vital
to the full participation of women in the economic and political walks
of American life.    The plurality would clear the way once again for
government to force upon women the physical labor and specific and direct
medical and psychological harms that may accompany carrying a fetus to
term. The plurality would clear the way again for the State to conscript
a woman's body and to force upon her a '`distressful life and future.''
...    The result, as we know from experience ... would be that, every
year, hundreds of thousands of women, in desperation, would defy the law
and place their health and safety in the unclean and unsympathetic hands
of back-alley abortionists, or they would attempt to perform abortions
upon themselves, with disastrous results. Every year, many women, especially
poor and minority women, would die or suffer debilitating physical trauma,
all in the name of enforced morality or religious dictates or lack of compassion
as it may be.    Of the aspirations and settled understandings of American
women, or the inevitable and brutal consequences of what it is doing, the
tough-approach plurality utters not a word. This silence is callous. It
is also profoundly destructive of this court as an institution.    To
overturn a constitutional decision is a rare and grave undertaking. To
overturn a constitutional decision that secured a fundamental personal
liberty to millions of persons would be unprecedented in our 200 years
of constitutional history. ...    Today's decision involves the most politically
divisive domestic legal issue of our time. By refusing to explain or to
justify its proposed revolutionary revision of the law of abortion, and
by refusing to abide not only by our precedents, but also by our canons
for reconsidering those precedents, the pluralilty invites charges of cowardice
and illegitimacy to our door. I cannot say that these would be undeserved.
   For today, at least, the law of abortion stands undisturbed. For today,
the women of this Nationa still retain the liberty to control their destinies.
But the signs are evident and very ominous, and a chill wind blows.  
 I dissent.

<TEXT>
   Excerpts from Justice Stevens, concurring in part and dissenting
in part:
   The reasons why I would also affirm (the Court of Appeals) of the
viability testing provision and of the preamble, require separate
explanation.
   It seems to me that ... the plurality strains to place a
construction on 188.029 that enables it to conclude ``we would
modify and narrow Roe and succeeding cases.'' That statement is
ill-advised because there is no need to modify even slightly the
holdings of prior cases in order to uphold 188.029. ...
   My interpretation of the plain language is supported by the
structure of the statute as a whole, particularly the preamble,
which ``finds'' that life ``begins at conception'' and further
commands that state laws shall be construed to provide the maximum
protection to ``the unborn child at every stage of development''...
Thus it is not ``incongruous'' to assume that the Missouri
Legislature was trying to protect the potential human life of
nonviable fetuses by making the abortion decision more costly ... I
am also satisfied, for the reasons stated by Justice Blackmun, that
the testing provision is manifestly unconstitutional. ...
   To the extent that the Missouri statute interferes with
contraceptive choices, I have no doubt that it is unconstitutional
under the court's holdings (in three previous cases.) ...
   Indeed, I am persuaded that the absence of any secular purpose
for the legislative declarations that life begins at conception and
that conception occurs at fertilization makes the relevant portion
of the preamble invalid under the Establishment Clause of the First
Amendment to the Federal Constitition. This conclusion does not, and
could not, rest on the fact that the statement happens to coincide
with the tenets of certain relgions or on the fact that the
legislators who voted to enact it may have been motivated by
religious considerations. Rather, it rests on the fact that the
preamble, an unequivocal endorsement of a religious tenet of some
but by no means all Christian faiths, serves no identifiable secular
purpose. That fact alone compels a conclusion that the statute
violates the Establishment Clause. ...
   The preamble to the Missouri statute endorses the theological
position that there is the same secular interest in preserving the
life of a fetus during the first 40 to 80 days of pregnancy as there
is after viability _ indeed, after the time when the fetus has
become a ``person'' with legal rights protected by the Constitution.
...
   As a secular matter, there is an obvious difference between the
state interest in protecting the freshly fertilized egg and the
state interest in protecting a 9-month-gestated, fully sentient
fetus on the eve of birth. There can be no interest in protecting
the newly fertilized egg from physical pain or mental anguish,
because the capacity for such suffering does not yet exist;
respecting a developed fetus, however, that interest is valid. ...
   The state's suggestion that the ``finding'' in the preamble to
its abortion statute is, in effect, an amendment to its tort,
property, and criminal laws is not persuasive. ...
   Bolstering my conclusion that the preamble violates the First
Amendment is the fact that the intensely divisive character of much
of the national debate over the abortion issue reflects the deeply
held religious convictions of many participants in the debate. The
Missouri Legislature may not inject its endorsement of a particular
religious tradition into this debate, for ``the Establishment Clause
does not allow public bodies to foment such disagreement.
   In my opinion the preamble to the Missouri statute is
unconstitutional for two reasons. To the extent that it has
substantive impact on the freedom to use contraceptive procedures,
it is inconsistent with the central holding in Griswold (a previous
case). To the extent that it merely makes ``legislative findings
without operative effect,'' as the state argues... it violates the
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Contrary to the
theological ``finding'' of the Missouri Legislature, a woman's
constitutionally protected liberty encompasses the right to act on
her own belief that _ to paraphrase St. Thomas Aquinas _ until a
seed has acquired the powers of sensation and movement, the life of
a human being has not yet begun.

   Excerpts from Justice Scalia, concurring in part and concurring
in judgment:
   I share Justice Blackmun's view ... that it effectively would
overrule Roe vs. Wade, 410, U.S. 113 (1973). I think that should be
done, but would do it more explicitly. ...
   The outcome of today's case will doubtless be heralded as a
triumph of judicial statesmanship. It is not that, unless it is
statesmanlike needlessly to prolong this court's self-awarded
sovereignty over a field where it has little proper business, since
the answers to most of the cruel questions posed are political, not
juridical _ a sovereignty which therefore quite properly, but to the
great damage of the court, makes it the object of the sort of
organized public pressure that political institutions in a democracy
ought to receive.
   Justice O'Connor's assertion ... that a `fundamental mental rule
of judicial restraint' requires us to avoid reconsidering Roe,
cannot be taken seriously. By finessing Roe, we do not, as she
suggests ... adhere to the strict and venerable rule that we should
avoid `deciding questions of a constitutional nature.'
   We have not disposed of this case on some statutory or procedural
ground, but have decided _ and could not avoid deciding _ whether
the Missouri statute meets the requirements of the United States
Constitution. ...
   The real question, then, is whether there are valid reasons to go
beyond the most stingy possible holding today. It seems to me there
are not only valid, but compelling ones.
   Ordinarily, speaking no more broadly than is absolutely required
avoids throwing settled law into confusion; doing so today preserves
a chaos that is evident to anyone who can read and count.
   Alone sufficient to justify a broad holding is the fact that our
retaining control, through Roe, of what I believe to be, and many of
our citizens recognize to be a political issue, continuously
distorts the public perception of the role of this court.
   We can now look forward to at least another term with carts full
of mail from the public and streets full of demonstrators, urging us
_ their unelected and life-tenured judges who have been awarded
those extraordinary, undemocratic characteristics precisely in order
that we might follow the law despite the popular will, to follow the
popular will.
   Indeed, I expect we can look forward to even more of that than
before, given our indecisive decision today. And if these reasons
for taking the unexceptional course of reaching a broader holding
are not enough, then consider the nature of the constitutional
question we avoid: In most cases, we do no harm by speaking more
broadly than the decision requires. Anyone affected by the conduct
that the avoided holding would have prohibited will be able to
challenge it himself, and have his day in court to make the argument.
   Not so with respect to the harm that many States believed,
pre-Roe, and many may continue to believe, is caused by largely
unrestricted abortion. That will continue to occur if the States
have the constitutional power to prohibit it, and would do so, but
we skillfully avoid telling them so. Perhaps those abortions cannot
constitutionally be proscribed. That is surely an arguable question
_ the question that reconsideration of Roe vs. Wade entails.
   But what is not at all arguable, it seems to me, is that we
should decide now and not insist that we be run into a corner before
we grudgingly yield up our judgment. The only reason for the latter
course is to prevent a change in the law _ but to think that
desirable begs the question to be decided. ...
   On the question of constitutionality (of the Missouri statute)
... I concur in the judgment of the court and strongly dissent from
the manner in which it has been reached.

   Voters began registering Monday to vote
in independence elections for Namibia, the strategic territory South
Africa has used as a buffer against black-ruled states.
   Registration offices throughout the territory saw a steady stream
of voters Monday, said Eberhard Hoffmann, a spokesman for Namibia's
South African administrator.
   Mobile units will begin moving into rural areas Tuesday, he said.
   ``Except for a few minor hitches, the program has started
smoothly,'' Hoffmann said, refusing to describe the problems.
   There is no official figure for how many people are eligible to
vote in the U.N.-supervised elections. Estimates put the number at
400,000 to 650,000. Tens of thousands of refugees still are expected
to be airlifted home before registration ends on Sept. 15.
   They will vote in November for legislators who will draw up a
constitution for the new country, expected to become independent
early next year.
   Supporters of the guerrilla-backed South-West Africa People's
Organization, widely expected to win most assembly seats, are
unhappy with some registration provisions, particularly one allowing
anyone who has lived in the territory for four years to register to
vote.
   They say it may permit an estimated 30,000 Angolans refugees to
vote, and also would include South African soldiers, police and
civil servants. The registration law requires anyone qualifying
under the residency rule to promise they intend to stay in Namibia
after the elections, but it is not enforceable.
   Also eligible is anyone over 18 who was born in the territory or
is the natural child of parents born there.
   The figures are significant as Namibia has a population of only
1.3 million in a vast semi-desert covering an area the size of Texas
and Louisiana.
   South Africa, which has ruled Namibia since 1915, agreed to grant
independence under a peace plan signed in December with Cuba and
Angola. The accord calls for Cuba to withdraw its 50,000 soldiers
from Angola, and South Africa to stop supporting U.S.-backed rebels
fighting Angola's Marxist government. Angola's government and rebels
declared a cease-fire June 22.

   The U.S. Embassy filed a protest with the Chinese
government Monday alleging soldiers deliberately fired semiautomatic
rifles into American diplomats' apartments last month. China denied
the charge.
   Eleven apartments in a diplomatic compound were struck by bullets
June 7, according to a U.S. Embassy report obtained by The
Associated Press.
   ``There is no doubt ... that certain apartments were deliberately
targeted by the PLA (People's Liberation Army),'' said the report.
   No one was injured in the compound. The report said two American
children in one of the apartments were shielded by their Chinese
nursemaids.
   One apartment was hit with 18 bullets, and another was examined
and found to have been hit by several rounds fired from across the
street, and not on the ground below as the Chinese have claimed,
according to the report.
   Embassy Charge d'Affaires Raymond Burghardt delivered a note of
protest to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, but there was no immediate
response, said embassy spokesman Sheridan Bell.
   The government-run Xinhua News Agency said the allegations were a
lie and that the soldiers were firing in self-defense after snipers
began firing at them from both sides of the street.
   ``Under such circumstance, they certainly have the right to fire
in self-defense at the direction from where the snipers' shots
came,'' Xinhua said. It said one soldier died and two were wounded.
   The attack came a day after the State Department announced that
China's leading dissident, astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, had taken
refuge in the U.S. Embassy after the military crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators. American diplomats would not link that
to the shooting.
   The student-led pro-democracy movement was crushed June 3-4 when
the army and police moved into central Beijing's Tiananmen Square
and drove out students and their supporters.
   Chinese reports say about 300 people died in the violence,
including many soldiers and police officers. Chinese witnesses and
Western intelligence reports say the death toll could be as high as
3,000, mostly civilians.
   More than 1,900 people have been reported arrested since then,
and 27 people have been executed, but some of the student protest
leaders have avoided capture.
   A reporter from Taiwan, who said he interviewed one of the wanted
students, was missing after reportedly being forced into a car early
Monday by undercover police.
   Huang Teh-pei, who works for the Taiwan Independence Morning
Post, said he interviewed student leader Wang Dan, who is on a
nationwide wanted list, on Sunday.
   Police would not confirm Huang was detained, but Antonio Jiang, a
reporter for Taiwan's Journalist Weekly, said he feared Huang and
Wang had been arrested.
   Huang met Wang in Beijing on Sunday and was driving with him in a
car when they noticed they were being followed, Jiang said. Huang
got out of the car and Wang was driven off by the car's driver, but
the driver has not been seen since, Jiang said.
   He said Huang's room was searched early Monday and he was forced
into a car with no license plates outside his hotel around noon.
   Wang, 20, is among the most wanted people in China. A history
major at Beijing University, he was among 21 students named in
all-points bulletins as organizers of the seven-week democracy
protests.
   Wang said he had been in hiding in southern China and recently
returned to Beijing, according to Jiang. It would have been highly
unusual for Wang to come to Beijing, where there is an intense
police dragnet, unless he was desperate for help to leave the
country.
   While public reports of arrests have reduced to a trickle, they
are known to be continuing.
   Two men in handcuffs were led across a street by soldiers Monday
night, and residents report many people have been taken away,
questioned and sometimes beaten before being released without being
charged.
   China protested Monday to the French government over a June 29
incident in which demonstrators occupied part of the Chinese Embassy
in Paris for more than two hours.
   Chinese media said the French demonstrators forced their way into
the embassy's education section and hung banners ``attacking and
vilifying China.'' French news reports said about 30 people took
part in the protest. Neither they nor Xinhua said what the protest
was about.
   A senior Foreign Ministry official told the French ambassadr in
Beijing that China ``demanded the French government punish the
culprits and take practical and effective measures to ensure that no
similar incident would occur in future,'' Xinhua reported.
   Premier Li Peng, who ordered martial law in Beijing on May 20,
submitted a draft bill Monday prohibiting protests that ``impinge
upon the interests of the state.''
   It said no protests may oppose the leadership of the Communist
Party or socialist system, advocate the splitting of China, or take
place near important facilities such as government or party offices,
airports, train stations, state guesthouses or diplomatic missions.

   When the Supreme Court's decision on abortion
finally came, it brought momentary silence to the waiting crowd on
the sun drenched plaza outside.
   Then the two sides _ ``pro-life,'' ``pro-choice'' began screaming
at each other once again.
   But first, lawyers in dark suits stood on the white-marble paving
stones, hurriedly flipping through the 78 pages of the court's
decision in ``William Webster, attorney general of Missouri et al vs
Reproductive Health Services et al.''
   As it became clear that the court had strengthened the power of
the states to limit abortion, though stopping short of overturning
the landmark Roe vs Wade decision, a young man in the crowd held up
a prepared sign.
   ``Thank You Supreme Court,'' it read.
   ``Too bad you guys lost,'' a grinning teen-ager gloated as he
passed a group of abortion-rights demonstrators, their banner
drooping.
   ``Not the Courts, Not the States, Women Will Ddecide Our Fate,''
pro-choice demonstrators shouted.
   A bearded man in the brown robes of a monk knelt facing the
court, praying aloud.
   He was flanked by nine men and women, most holding anti-abortion
placards.
   A young man tossed a dozen paper-wrapped coat hangers, the symbol
of unsafe abortions, on the marble steps in front of the group.
   The praying man reached into his robes, removed a bottle of
water, and sprinkled the coat hangers.
   Volunteers picked up them up and hauled them away.
   Coat hangers were tossed down, removed, replaced, and soon the
steps leading to the plaza of the court were carpeted with coat
hangers, hundreds of them, most of them lettered in red: ``Never
Again.''
   Leaders of the fight for or against abortion trooped to clusters
of waiting microphones to hail the courts decision or to mourn it.
   Scores of spectators lined the rims of nearby marble fountains,
straining to hear.
   ``It is very clear the pro-life cause is galvanized,'' said Tom
Glessner, executive director of the Christian Action Council. ``It
was a major victory for the pro-life movement.''
   ``I think it's a serious setback,'' said Bella Abzug, the former
Democratic congresswoman from New York. ``I think women should
mobilize all over the country and make it clear that the people are
supreme, not the court. This is a creeping invasion of women's
rights. Thhat's what it is, a creeping invasion.''
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women, was
asked what impact the decision will have.
   ``It means that if you've got money, you can get an abortion,''
she replied. ``If you're poor, you're down the drain.''
   Inside the court, more than a hundred people waited in a basement
corridor to obtain copies of the decision.
   Near them, carved in gilt letters on white marble, were words
from an 1821 decision of the court: ``A Constitution is formed for
ages to come. ... The course cannot always be tranquil.''
   Outside on the plaza there was no tranquility.
   Two men shouted opposing slogans at each other, amplifying their
screams with bull horns.
   Groups of shouters appeared here and there, becoming more
animated and shrill with the approach of television cameras.
   A red-faced young man to a dark-haired woman: ``Is that what
you're saying, because I'm a man you're not going to listen to my
argument?''
   ``It's murder, that's what it is, murder,'' a man shouted at
another group.
   ``It's not yet a person,'' came the shouted reply.
   ``Yes it is, it's a baby, it's a life,''
   Over their heads the repeated chant could be heard: ``Not the
Courts, Not the States, Women Will Decide Our Fate.''
   And the reply: ``We Will. We Will. We Will Rescue Babies.''
   The Supreme Court of the United States had ruled.
   But the socially divisive battle over abortion rights was clearly
not over.

   A passenger ferry with 95 people aboard
collided with a West German freighter and sank Monday, injuring
seven people, police said.
   The panicked passengers, some clutching infants, jumped overboard
after the collision andwere saved by rescue helicopters, police and
pleasure boats, and scuba divers, witnesses said.
   Rescue officials said the ferry, the Oslo 6, sank near the island
of Langoeya, the ferry's destination, after colliding with the
freighter Achat. The West German ship remained afloat and reported
no casualties.
   State radio said the ferry captain tried to sail the badly
damaged ship at full throttle toward the dock on Landoeye. It came
within 200 yards of land before water flooded its engines and it
sank.
   ``There was wild panic on board,'' passenger Per Faltsen told the
radio. ``Adults and children started to jump into the water right
after the collision. ... I looked down and saw a hugh hole in the
ferry and could see down to the water.''
   Inspector Kolbjoern Skervengen said all passengers survived,
although seven were injured, one critically.
   It was the major second passenger ship accident off Norway within
two weeks. On June 20, a Soviet cruise ship with more than 950
people aboard rammed an iceberg in the Norwegian Sea. No serious
injuries were reported.

<HEAD>New Parliament Sworn In After Unique Government Formed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new Parliament convened Monday under a
conservative-communist coalition formed for the specific task of
prosecuting those accused of corruption in the previous Socialist
government.
   Former Premier Andreas Papandreou, the Socialist leader, did not
attend the ceremony but said his party was ready to ``begin the
battle'' in opposition. Papandreou, 70, is recovering from pneumonia
and kidney problems at an Athens hospital.
   The 300 deputies sworn in Monday were chosen June 18 in an
election that denied Papandreou a third four-year term but also left
the conservative New Democracy party short of a majority.
   Two weeks of negotiation produced the coalition, and a 22-member
Cabinet led by Premier Tzannis Tzannetakis, a conservative, was
sworn in Sunday.
   Analysts described the arrangement by the conservative New
Democracy party and the Coalition of Left and Progress, an alliance
of the Moscow-line Greek Communist Party and the Greek Left, a
Eurocommunist group, as a ``national reconciliation'' government 40
years after the civil war.
   The 1946-49 civil war ended with the defeat of the communists by
a conservative government supported by the United States. The defeat
began decades of prosecution and exile on barren islands for the
communists, who now are involved in a government for the first time
in their 70-year history.
   Leaders of the conservatives and the communist alliance agreed to
a three-month coalition to prosecute members of Papandreou's
government allegedly involved in financial scandals.
   Under Greek law, ministers are immune unless prosecuted during
the Parliament following the one when the alleged crimes were
committed.
   Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas, former No. 2 man in Papandreou's
government, was suspended from the Socialist Party's executive
committee Monday. He is accused of taking a $2 million bribe to
amend a law while he was justice minister.
   The semiofficial Athens News Agency said Koutsogiorgas appeared
at a meeting of the committee and, after he refused requests to
leave, the members voted to suspend his membership.
   Papandreou's party have 125 seats in the unicameral Parliament.
New Democracy has 145 and the communist coalition 28. One seat went
to the conservative Democratic Renewal party and the other is held
by Sadik Ahmed, a Greek Moslem independent.
   The Communists were given the Interior and Justice ministries in
the new government.

   Two suicides and an accidental shooting
upset a Roman Catholic priest so much that he offered to pay $50 for
each gun parishioners bring to him.
   ``I just can't see Jesus saying, `I'm going to have a gun for
protection,''' the Rev. Edmund S. Nadolny said Monday.
   The priest said he's hoping to collect 100 guns. He has collected
two since he announced the plan June 25 during Mass at St. Vincent
Ferrer Church.
   Nadolny, 56, said he paid for one of the guns, while the other
was given to him by a 65-year-old woman parishioner who was stirred
by his call to disarm. Each gun he buys will be turned over to
police, Nadolny said.
   The priest said got his idea last month when an aging parishioner
called him and told him he was going to commit suicide. Nadolny said
the man had just learned he had cancer and did not have enough money
to fight to the disease.
   ``I told him I wanted to talk to him. I told him I would give him
$100 for the gun, and I took the gun from him. I realized that he
needed a lot of help,'' Nadolny said.
   Although Nadolny was able to help prevent that suicide, two other
young men in the Naugatuck area shot themselves in June. Both had
learned they had cancer, Nadolny said. He believes they might not
have died had someone been able to counsel them.
   That same month, a 12-year-old boy was accidentally shot in the
back of the head and killed by an 11-year-old friend. The two boys
were playing at the younger boy's home with a small handgun.
   ``In the hospital, I meet on a regular basis with people who cut
their wrists. The only place I meet someone who shoots themselves is
in the morgue,'' Nadolny said.
   Nadolny said he is not opposed to people owning guns for hunting,
but he said he wished hunters would store guns away from the
ammunition.

   Sudan's new military leader promises an end
to a ruinous civil war and better living standards for some of the
world's poorest people.
   But Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir's announcements are short
on details, and some experts fear they may prove to be window
dressing to adorn another authoritarian military regime in Khartoum.
   Shortly after Bashir overthrew Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's
civilian government Friday, the little-known paratroop brigadier
imposed a state of emergency. He disbanded the country's 36
political parties, banned independent newspapers and slammed an
indefinite nighttime curfew on the capital.
   Coup leaders declared themselves a 15-member Command Council of
the National Salvation Revolution chaired by Bashir. He quickly
skipped a rank to become a three-star general and appointed himself
prime minister, defense minister and military commander in chief.
   Bashir then went about consolidating power in the classic way. He
retired 28 of his military superiors and promised speedy trials for
politicians and officials he accused of stealing public funds and
destroying the economy. Soldiers arrested 20 or so senior
politicians, but Mahdi himself remains at large.
   ``Any coup has to start out like this,'' said Peter Woodward, a
Sudan expert lecturing at Britain's Reading University.
   ``It could be the basis of authoritarianism. When information
becomes clear on exactly how many people they have arrested, the way
they are treating them, whether they will reopen educational
institutions, that will show the degree of authoritarianism,'' he
said Monday in a telephone interview.
   The ``June Revolution'' is the fourth military coup in Sudan's 33
years of independence from Britain. Generals have ruled all but 10
years.
   ``It looks like this leader has all the characteristics of the
military regimes in the '50s and '60s,'' said Tim Niblock, director
of Middle Eastern politics at Britain's Exeter University.
   ``It's not just that he has taken all these measures,'' Niblock
said. ``He seems to be saying that political parties are a waste of
time and bound to be corrupt. It's difficult to see him loosening
these controls anytime soon.''
   Woodward agreed. He said the civilian government Bashir has
promised to appoint on an unspecified date could turn into a group
of civil servant puppets with the junta pulling the strings.
   Yet Sudan's military once before has kept such a promise. The
junta that overthrow military dictator Gaafar Nimeiri in April 1985
pledged to restore civilian government in a year. They surprised
observers by overseeing fair multiparty elections that brought Mahdi
to power in April 1986.
   Woodward said he is not surprised Bashir suspended moves to end
the civil war, canceling a new round of talks with the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army that was to begin Tuesday in the Ethiopian
capital, Addis Ababa. Mahdi initiated the new initiative under
pressure from the military and trade unions.
   Woodward said the new leadership is bound to take stock of the
government's position in the bloody, costly six-year conflict before
returning to the bargaining table, which Bashir has promised to do.
   The war, against the minority animists and Christians of the
south, cost the government a ruinous $1 million a day and caused
widespread famine that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.
Bashir is from the dominant northern Arabs, who are Moslem.
   Exeter's Niblock said the new leadership is ``making the right
noises'' about ending the war and emphasizing Mahdi's failure to
deal with the fighting and the economy as reasons for the coup.
   But he stressed Bashir's coup faces the same problems as other
military takeovers in Africa and the Middle East.
   ``The new leadership makes a hit with the media,'' Niblock said.
``Then the regime loses impetus, problems build up and the military
is not equipped to deal with them. It has no political experience.''
   Sudan's 22 million people complained Mahdi's indecisiveness
crippled his ability to end the war or improve the economy. Mahdi's
government was buffeted by street demonstrations protesting high
prices and severe shortages of basic goods.
   When Bashir broadcast news of the coup Friday morning over
official Radio Omdurman, there were no obvious signs of opposition
or happiness.
   ``It's difficult to try and second-guess them,'' Woodward said of
the junta's plans. ``Maybe they haven't thought it out themselves.''

   Through eight election campaigns, abortion has
stirred bitterness and venom into American politics _ and the
Supreme Court's decision Monday points to even angrier contention,
state by state by state.
   By allowing states to write abortion curbs into their laws, the
court guaranteed every legislature a flood of abortion bills that
will divide and sometimes dominate each of the 50 state capitols.
   The organizations, the strategies, the campaign war chests and
the wrath built over 16 years of legalized abortion in the national
arena will be turned now toward the legislatures and their members.
   Activists on both sides said they intend to force every candidate
at every level of politics to choose a side.
   Abortion stands at the intersection of morality, theology,
privacy and women's rights. There are few _ if any _ neutral parties
on that corner.
   One advocate of a right to abortion said the issue will be to the
1990s what Vietnam was to an earlier political generation.
   That is an ominous prospect for the leaders whom Americans have
elected to deal with the traditional task of governing, a job
requiring compromise and civility even in disagreement. In the
abortion struggle there is no room for compromise. It is the
political equivalent of war, and there is no consorting with the
enemy.
   Activists on the subject wrote the book on single-issue politics,
the electoral school in which it makes no difference how close a
candidate's views may be to that of the voter if they disagree on
one, litmus-test topic. Abortion is that kind of topic.
   Since the court legalized abortion in 1973, basing that decision
on a woman's constitutional right to privacy, the anti-abortion
movement has taken to the streets, has shouted down candidates,
demonstrated, blocked the doors to abortion clinics.
   Its forces have shouted accusations of murder at Democratic
presidential candidates, waving grisly placards at campaign rallies
in an effort to penalize politicians who would not support a
constitutional amendment to ban abortion.
   Abortion-rights organizations have been trying to defend what
they won in the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision.
   The anti-abortion side has been on the attack, campaigning to
overturn that decision by constitutional amendment, to impede it in
the streets and to challenge it in the courts. The Supreme Court
decision on Monday does not overturn the 1973 ruling, but permits
and, according to the dissent of Justice Harry Blackmun, invites the
states to limit it.
   More than a dozen states already have standby laws restricting
abortion. Nearly three dozen require parental consent for abortions
for minors. Most of the states have sought to bar financing of
abortions under the Medicaid program of care for the needy.
   According to the National Abortion Rights Action League, more
than 250 restrictive bills have been introduced in state
legislatures just since last year.
   At least 29 abortion-linked political action committees, pro and
con, are registered with the Federal Election Commission.
   There will be more bills, more fund-raising committees, more
money, and more pressure on the state governments, from both sides.
   Randall Terry, whose Operation Rescue stages demonstrations to
block the doors of abortion clinics, said there will be an avalanche
of legislation to ban abortion, state by state. ``In every state
legislature around this country we're going to see battles over the
abortion issue,'' said Nancy Broff of the Abortion Rights League.
   And the single-minded, single-interest forces waging this war say
there will be no place for any politician to hide on this issue _
anyone who isn't a supporter must be the enemy.

   The Supreme Court on Monday accepted its
first-ever ``right-to-die'' case, agreeing to decide whether a
Missouri couple can remove their brain-damaged daughter from a
life-support system.
   Nancy Cruzan, 31, has been in what doctors describe as a
persistent vegetative condition since a January 1983 car crash.
   Her parents, Joe and Joyce Cruzan, want to remove the feeding
tube surgically planted in her stomach. Without it, doctors said she
would die of starvation or dehydration. With it, they said, she may
live for 30 years or more.
   The court said it would review a 4-3 ruling of the Missouri
Supreme Court that forbid doctors from removing the tube. A decision
is expected next year.
   ``We are pretty elated around here,'' her father said in a
telephone interview from Carterville, Mo., after learning the case
will be heard by the nation's highest court. ``We are trying to do
what Nancy would want us to do.''
   Ms. Cruzan is able to breathe on her own and has periods of
wakefulness in which her eyes move randomly in all directions.
Doctors say she is incapable of reacting or relating to her
environment, and can experience no thoughts or emotions.
   Her hands and feet have constricted, bent into claw shapes
because of the brain damage.
   Her parents said their daughter at one time had said she would
not want to be kept alive in such a condition.
   But the Missouri Supreme Court said, ``We find no principled
legal basis which permits the co-guardians in this case to choose
the death of their ward. The state's interest is in the preservation
of life, not only Nancy's life, but also the lives of persons
similarly situated yet without the support of a loving family.''
   It added, ``We choose to err on the side of life, respecting the
rights of incompetent persons who may wish to live despite a
severely diminished quality of life.''
   The state Supreme Court overturned a judge's ruling that would
have allowed the Cruzans to order the feeding tube removed.
   The Missouri Legislature has enacted a law _ a so-called living
will statute _ that permits the withdrawal of artificial
life-support systems from hopelessly ill and injured patients. But
the law specifically forbids withholding food and water from them.
   The American Medical Association and other organizations joined
the Cruzans in urging the Supreme Court to overturn the state court
ruling.
   The medical groups said U.S. hospitals care for from 5,000 to
10,000 people in a persistent vegetative state.
   The organizations said many state legislatures, and a handful of
state appeals courts, have approved the withdrawal of life-support
systems in such cases.
   The Supreme Court has declined in the past to study the
right-to-die issue.
   Missouri Attorney General William Webster, whose office argued
against removing the feeding tube, said he is glad the court decided
to hear the case.
   ``There are families all across the country that deserve a
definite statement from the Supreme Court on the issue,'' Webster
said. ``There is a split among the lower courts on this issue and it
is appropriate that the highest court in the land consider the
issue.''
   In the most publicized case to reach them, the justices let stand
a 1976 New Jersey Supreme Court ruling that allowed the removal of a
respirator helping Karen Ann Quinlan breathe.
   Ms. Quinlan, also in an irreversible vegetative state, continued
to be fed through a tube and lived an additional nine years.
   The case is Cruzan vs. Missouri Department of Health, 88-1503.

<HEAD>Indian Soldiers Detain Scores of Suspected Tamils</HEAD>

   Indian soldiers swept through the
northern jungles and detained 125 suspected Tamil Tiger rebels,
Indian officials said Monday. Five of the militants were killed in
the operation.
   The offensive, code-named ``Storm,'' was launched after the
rebels stepped up attacks on the Indian peacekeeping troops, said a
spokeswoman at the Indian High Commission, or embassy.
   Indian newspapers said the sweep against the dominant Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam group began 10 days ago and involved at least
20,000 troops backed by helicopter gunships.
   Five militants were killed during the operation, and troops have
been ordered to continue ``the pressure on the Tamil Tigers,'' said
the spokeswoman, who cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   She had no other details about the operation but said 108 rebels
were killed and 47 were captured last month, while the Indians
suffered 40 casualties.
   A Tamil rebel leader in Colombo said the Indian gunships shelled
and destroyed villages in the jungles of Vavuniya, Mullaitivu and
Kilinochi.
   The offensive was confined to aerial bombardment, but ``we have
yet to face the worst,'' said the rebel leader, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   A Sri Lankan military official said a dusk-to-dawn curfew had
been imposed in many towns in the area since Saturday.
   Last week, President Ranasinghe Premadasa asked India to cease
operations against the Tamil Tigers, the main rebel militia fighting
for an independent nation in the northeast.
   India rejected Premadasa's request, saying a decision could be
taken only if the Tamil Tigers surrendered arms and refrained from
violence.
   Premadasa's appeal came a day after his government opened
independent negotiations with the rebels, aimed at ending the
separatist campaign.
   An earlier attempt to end the movement was made by Premadasa's
predecessor, Junius R. Jayewardene, which resulted in an
India-brokered peace accord that brought the Indian troops to Sri
Lanka.
   The accord, signed on July 29, 1987, promised local autonomy to
the ethnic minority Tamils in exchange for an arms surrender by the
the various Tamil rebel groups.
   While most groups gave up the violence, the Tamil Tigers reneged
on the accord and began attacking Indian soldiers. At least 800
soldiers and 1,500 rebels have died in the two-year-old bush war.
   India has also rejected Premadasa's request to withdraw its
estimated 45,000 troops by the end of July, saying a hasty pullout
could lead to even greater violence.
   India became involved in the Tamil war because of the sympathies
of its own 60 million Tamils.
   Tamils in Sri Lanka form 18 percent of the country's 16 million
people and claim they are discriminated against by the majority
Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population and control the
government and the military.
   At least 9,000 people have been killed in the Tamil separatist
war and another 3,500 have died in a backlash by radical Sinhalese.

   A deliberately set blaze caused minor damage
to an abortion clinic Monday eight hours before the U.S. Supreme
Court announced its ruling limiting the right to an abortion,
authorities said.
   Police said they were notifying federal authorities because of
the circumstances.
   ``Where it's at a feminist health center and there's been this
nationwide thing involving them (abortion clinics), we felt that we
should notify them,'' said Jim Moran, director of investigations for
the Concord police.
   Fire officials received an alarm at 2:20 a.m., said Capt. Jack
Davis, fire prevention officer. The fire, confined to a bookcase in
one room in the unoccupied building, was put out with a portable
extinguisher, officials said.
   ``The case was incendiary, meaning it was intentionally set,''
said Davis.
   Moran said there was a hole in a window near where the fire began.
   Patty Baum, who works at the center, said she believes abortion
opponents were responsible.
   ``They say they're so peaceful and pro-life, yet they're willing
to destroy buildings and risk lives. There potentially could have
been someone in there,'' she told the Concord Monitor.
   But Russell Pond, director of the New Hampshire Pro-Life Council,
called it irresponsible to cast blame before anyone is caught.
   ``It could have been set by those who want to cast a bad light on
the pro-life movement,'' he said.
   A number of arrests were made earlier this year at the clinic,
which is a frequent target of anti-abortion picketing.

   A cache of 170 million yen ($1.2 million) found in a

   Nakanishi, 60, had forgotten about keeping the money in the safe

   The U.S. Postal Service temporarily suspended
home mail delivery on a street in this blue-collar Boston suburb
because it was too dangerous for carriers to enter the high-crime,
drug-infested area.
   ``Our first responsibility is to protect our letter carriers,''
said Lynn postal supervisor Richard Coppinger.
   Postal officials Friday notified the residents of Vine Street
that carriers face extraordinary danger in the neighborhood.
Residents were told they could pick up mail at the post office.
   Coppinger said home mail delivery would resume Wednesday with a
police escort.
   Postal officials said a letter carrier had been verbally
assaulted when she delivered mail in a run-down apartment building.
Earlier this month, a letter carrier narrowly escaped injury when a
fight broke out between two occupants of an apartment building.
   Vine Street residents said they were angered by the decision to
end mail delivery to the entire street.
   ``It's very unfair for us,'' said Nathan Guy, 23. ``There are
only certain people responsible and they've made the whole street
suffer.''

<HEAD>Howe: `No Way' Hong Kong's People Could Move to Britain</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-China, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said
Monday there was ``no way'' Hong Kong's 3.7 million people could
move to Britain to escape communist rule.
   Protesters interrupted Howe's speech to community leaders,
unfurling a banner, reading ``Shame on the Thatcher government.''
   ``This ... speech is insulting the intelligence of Hong Kong
Chinese. We protest and we walk out!'' shouted Lee Wing Tat, a
community leader who stormed from the hall with about eight other
demonstrators.
   Local politicians criticized the speech as ``totally
unconstructive'' and ``disappointing.''
   Howe indicated some Hong Kong Chinese who have provided valuable
service to the colony would be allowed to settle in Britain, but he
provided no details.
   He also said Britain would open its doors to Hong Kong residents
and mobilize the international community to do the same ``if things
did go catastrophically wrong'' in the territory once China resumes
political control of Hong Kong in 1997.
   ``The plain fact is that there is simply no way that the British
government could grant to several million people the right to come
and live in Britain,'' Howe told about 250 community leaders.
   ``It dismays me that some have suggested that this is a matter of
race. It is nothing of the sort,'' Howe said. ``It is a practical
problem'' that would test Britian's capacity in housing, employment
and transportation.
   Howe said Britain is considering plans to speed up local
democratic reform and draft a bill of rights for the colony.
   He also pledged a thorough re-examination of a clause in the
constitution for post-1997 Hong Kong being drafted by China that
allows Beijing authorities to declare a state of emergency in the
territory.
   Hong Kong residents have demanded the right to live in Britain
since China unleashed a violent crackdown on the movement for
freedom in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   Although more than 3 million Hong Kong Chinese are eligible for
British passports, they are not allowed to live in Britain.
   Under the 1984 British-Chinese agreement, China guarantees that
Hong Kong can keep its capitalist system and freedoms for 50 years
after the turnover and enjoy a ``high degree of autonomy.''
   Howe, on a three-day mission to gauge opinion in the colony after
the Beijing crackdown, said China has a huge economic stake in Hong
Kong. He said China remains committed to keeping the territory
prosperous and stable.
   ``Hong Kong has seen hard times before. You've always shown the
resilience and the resourcefulness to live through such times and
emerge from them stronger than ever before,'' he said. ``Hong Kong's
future will I'm sure continue that bold tradition.''
   The heckling at Howe's speech was extremely rare in this British
colony. It demonstrated the degree of bitterness many of Hong Kong's
people feel toward London's refusal to grant them the right to live
in Britain.
   Albert Cheng, head of the Right-of-Abode organization, said he
found the speech ``totally unconstructive.''
   ``When someone comes to Hong Kong from so high up and delivers a
speech like that, I am sure it will hamper the confidence of the
people once more,'' he said.
   He described the feelings of Hong Kong's people as ``frustrated,
disappointed and angry.''
   Legislative councillor Dame Lydia Dunn said she found the speech
``disappointing'' because it included nothing new.

<HEAD>Official Sees Final Settlement in Angola This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Herman Cohen, the new U.S.
assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said Monday he
believes Angola's civil war will be settled by the end of the year.
   Angola's Cuban- and Soviet-backed government has been fighting
rebels armed by South Africa and the United States for 12 years, but
the two sides agreed last month at an African summit in Zaire to a
cease-fire and negotiations.
   ``There have been some tremendously important developments in
Angola and I believe it's on the right track,'' Cohen said. ``I
expect a final settlement in Angola certainly before the end of this
year.''
   The process is slower in Mozambique, he said. Both countries are
former Portuguese colonies where guerrillas wars broke out when the
Portuguese hastily withdrew in the late 1970s. South Africa
supported rebels in both countries but now states that policy has
ended.
   ``In Mozambique, I believe things seem to be moving toward a
political settlement a bit more slowly than Angola, but I think it's
on the right track as well,'' Cohen said.
   He arrived in South Africa on Sunday night and is to visit
Angola, Mozambique, Zambia, the Congo and Ivory Coast. He said in
general he is optimistic about the Southern African situation, but
would not comment specifically on U.S. policy toward South Africa
until President Bush's administration completes a policy review
expected by the end of September.
   However, he did say, ``There must be a negotiated settlement.
Nothing can be done unilaterally in this country anymore.''
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha, who had just met with Cohen for more
than an hour, nodded in agreement. Cohen spoke to reporters as he
walked out of the Foreign Ministry building.
   Cohen met Monday with Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, and
invited Govan Mbeki, a member of the outlawed African National
Congress and the South African Communist Party, to dinner Monday
night.
   Mbeki was among eight ANC leaders given life sentences in 1964
for plotting to overthrow the government. He was released in 1987
because he was ill. Mbeki is banned from speaking publicly, being
quoted by the press, or leaving his home in Port Elizabeth without
police permission.

   Police are reviewing repair records of a
company that charged the city $60,400 over the last year for work on
a 4-year-old bus that cost $38,800.
   Officials of Mobile Equipment Repair Service Inc., which repaired
Bus No. 8 and 26 others under a recently terminated agreement, would
not comment.
   Records for Bus 8, obtained by the San Jose Mercury News, show
the same parts being repaired and replaced month after month. Horns
broke repeatedly. Switches and circuit breakers failed over and over
again. The bus also had a new engine and a rebuilt transmission
installed.
   Police said they are investigating whether any of the repairs are
fraudulent or if the bus happened to be a real lemon.
   The city ended its repair contract with Mobile on Friday after
critical reports cited deficiencies in the maintenance and repair
operation.

   Pro-choice groups Monday said the Supreme
Court's abortion decision is a ``giant step backward'' that
threatens the livelihoods and health of American women, but abortion
foes cheered the ruling as ``a victory for life.''
   ``This is an outrage,'' said Judith Widdicombe, founder of
Reproductive Health Services, the Missouri clinic involved in the
court decision. ``This is the beginning of a war. It will become our
Vietnam of the 1990s.''
   ``The court's decision is a victory for life, and the biggest
winners today are the tiniest people of all _ children within the
womb,'' said Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis, president of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
   The court stopped short of overturning its 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision that legalized abortion. But in allowing Missouri to
restrict the use of public money, medical personnel and facilities
in performing abortions, the justices gave states new freedom to
restrict a woman's right to end a pregnancy.
   People for the American Way, a nonpartisan constitutional
liberties group, predicted ``a state by state bloodletting that
could be among the most painful in our history.''
   The court also appeared to invite further challenges to its
landmark ruling. It said it will hear three new abortion cases next
term.
   The ruling ``begins the process of restoring a fundamental right
of the American people _ the right to protect human life,'' said
John Willke, president of the National Right to Life Committee.
   ``We are horrified,'' said Lori Schroyer, spokeswoman for the
California Abortion Rights Action League. ``Access to abortion is
going to be limited to those of privilege. It will force people
across state lines and into back alleys.''
   Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League, said the ruling ``is a giant step backward for
this country and a tremendous loss of liberty for every American.
   ``Women's lives hang by a thread, and the justices this morning
handed politicians a pair of scissors,'' she said.
   Randall Terry, founder and director of Operation Rescue, whose
members have blockaded abortion clinics across the country, said the
ruling is the first step toward ending abortion nationwide.
   ``It's a faltering step under which children will continue to be
murdered, but this decision indicates that Roe's days are
numbered,'' he said.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and a key abortion foe in Congress,
called the ruling ``a major victory for the pro-life cause'' and
said he remains ``hopeful the court will soon overturn Roe
outright.''
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,
said the series of votes that restored key provisions of a Missouri
law restricting abortion shows ``we are only one justice's vote away
from complete reversal of Roe.
   ``This is the first of a one-two punch that will completely knock
out abortion rights,'' she said.
   NOW and the many other groups favoring abortion-rights for women
said they will begin lobbying statehouses across the country and
promised to make abortion a major issue in elections nationwide.
   ``Every person who stands for election in this country is going
to have to answer,'' Yard said.
   Norma McCorvey, who as ``Jane Roe'' brought the case that led to
the 1973 ruling, said she was deeply disappointed by Monday's
decision.
   ``It saddens my heart very deeply to know that poor women are
once again going to be out there going to backstreet abortions and
possibly be mutilated,'' McCorvey, a Dallas housekeeper, told Cable
News Network.
   The Center for Population Options said the ruling ``will sentence
thousands of teen-agers each year to bear children they are not
ready emotionally, physically or financially to raise.''
   ``Access to abortion is going to be limited to those of
privilege. It will force people across state lines and into back
alleys,'' Lori Schroyer, spokeswoman for the California Abortion
Rights Action League.
   Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said the decision ``made women wards
of the state. Their rights are all dependent on what states decide
to do.''
   Sarah Weddington, a Texas attorney who successfully argued the
Roe vs. Wade case in 1973, said that while the decision is effective
immediately, ``it will have no practical implication until state
legislatures pass new laws.
   ``So in terms of is abortion legal or illegal in the various
states, tomorrow it's going to be the same as today. But what we are
going to see is a tremendous surge of legislative activity in all of
the state legislatures depending on which ones are in session and
which ones are not,'' she said.
   Despite that reassurance, many women appeared to be fearing the
worst.
   At Women's Health Services Inc., a Pittsburgh abortion clinic,
executive director Sue Roselle, said, ``The telephones are ringing
off the hook. Women are saying, `I want my abortion now before they
change the law.'''

<HEAD>Panama Barred from Loans by International Monetary Fund</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
in Panama was declared ineligible on Monday for new loans from the
International Monetary Fund fund because it has fallen behind on
repayments of $163 million borrowed earlier.
   Panama's total debt is over $5 billion.
   There are 151 member governments in the fund, including Panama.
The United States has the largest bloc of votes.
   The fund's External Relations Department announced that the ban
on Panama was decided by the 22 members of the Executive Board, who
meet behind closed doors. They usually act by consensus.
   U.S. financial sanctions against Noriega since 1987, following
his indictment on drug charges in this country, have so far failed
to dislodge him from his commanding position at the head of Panama's
armed forces.
   Acting President Manuel Solis Palma said in March that the U.S.
ban on payments to the Panama government caused a 20 percent drop in
the country's production last year.
   Panama becomes the ninth government to be banned from receiving
new loans from the fund. The others are Vietnam, Guayana, Liberia,
Sudan, Peru, Zambia, Sierra Leone and Somalia. Arrears in repayments
to the fund have been authoritatively estimated at close to $3
billion, both from these nine countries and from others which have
not yet fallen far enough behind to be sanctioned.
   In the past, debtor countries gave priority to meeting their
obligations to the fund but arrears have piled up in the continuing
debt crisis that began in 1982.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors may seek felony charges against
Rep. Donald Lukens if he successfully appeals a misdemeanor
conviction of having sex with a 16-year-old girl, the prosecutor's
office said Monday.
   The charges would stem from accusations that Lukens had sex with
the same girl when she was 13, said Tom Tornabene, a spokesman for
Franklin County Prosecutor Michael Miller.
   ``If, on appeal, the conviction is overturned, we will consider
pursuing felony charges. No final decision has been made yet,''
Tornabene said.
   Thomas Tyack, an attorney for the 58-year-old Republican
congressman, said disclosing such a plan was an attempt to
discourage Lukens from pursuing an appeal.
   Lukens was sentenced Friday to 30 days in jail and fined $500 on
a charge of contributing to the unruliness of a minor. He is free on
bond pending appeal.
   On May 26, a Franklin County jury convicted Lukens after hearing
Rosie Coffman testify that Lukens paid her $40 and gave her gifts
after having sex with her at his Columbus apartment last November.
   Ms. Coffman, now 17, told the jury that Lukens knew she was
underage.
   In February, the grand jury that indicted Lukens on the
misdemeanor charge also considered allegations that he had sex with
Ms. Coffman not only last year when she was 16 but in 1985 when she
was 13, when it would have been a felony charge.
   But the grand jury cited conflicting testimony from the girl and
did not indict Lukens on the more serious charge.
   Tournabene said that since February, however, another witness
with information about the alleged 1985 incident has been located
who would be available to testify before a second grand jury.
   Little testimony relating to Ms. Coffman's relationship with
Lukens before last November was admitted at trial, but the girl
referred to it several times on the stand.
   Lukens served two terms in Congress in the 1960s and early 1970s
before dropping out in an unsuccessful try for the Ohio
governorship. He was elected to the House again in 1986 and was
re-elected last November.

<TEXT>
   Sarah Weddington, the Texas attorney whose
victorious arguments in Roe vs. Wade legalized abortion 16 years
ago, called the Supreme Court decision Monday carving back that
right a personal defeat.
   Saying she was ``wrung out'' by the ruling upholding Missouri
regulations limiting abortion rights, Ms. Weddington said at a news
conference that it was up to the young to carry on the fight.
   Ms. Weddington, 44, represented Norma McCorvey, a Dallas woman
who took the pseudonym Jane Roe, in the landmark 1973 case.
   She called Monday's ruling a personal defeat and said the day had
been burned into her memory.
   ``My heart stopped and my mouth went dry,'' she said. ``I've
invested 20 years of my life in this and now have been handed a
major defeat.''
   Ms. Weddington said she had expected the court to ``whittle
away'' the case that established the abortion precedent.
   But she added: ``I did not expect what they did and that was to
chop away at that decision.''
   She said the future of the abortion issue rests with young
adults, but she vowed to continue to speak out for the cause.
   The court, in a series of mostly 5-4 votes, restored several
Missouri abortion regulations that a lower court had invalidated for
unduly interfering with women's constitutional right to abortion.
   Ms. Weddington questioned the implications of the Missouri law _
which defines life as beginning at conception _ on some forms of
birth control and in vitro fertilization.
   ``Frankly, it makes me tired to think about the future,'' Ms.
Weddington told reporters at Texas Woman's University, where she is
an adjunct professor.
   Young adults must pick up the fight to maintain abortion rights,
she said.
   ``If people don't really say `No we're not going to have this,'
if they don't lobby their own state legislatures,'' abortion will
become illegal, she predicted.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Who Went North to Be Charged With Espionage; More Sought</HEAD>

   A lawmaker who went to North Korea for
talks with communist leaders will be charged with espionage, and
arrest warrants were issued for five more people in the case,
authorities said Monday.
   A search was also under way for radical students who helped a
22-year-old student defy the government and travel to North Korea
for a youth festival.
   Prosecutors said Suh Kyung-won, of the opposition Party for Peace
and Democracy, would be charged with espionage. This brought to
eight the number of people charged in connection with the
legislator's trip to visit North Korean leader Kim Il Sung.
   Suh said the trip was to discuss unification of the two nations.
He was jailed June 28 after he returned and surrendered.
   One of the eight people charged in the case is Suh's secretary,
Pang Yang-hyun, who was accused of receiving $12,000 from a North
Korean agent in Frankfurt, West Germany, and giving $10,000 to Suh.
   Five more poeple believed to have known about Suh's trip were
being sought.
   President Roh Tae-woo went on national radio to remind citizens
that travel to North Korea is a crime, and he said that despite
talks on unification, North Korea is still intent on spreading
communism to South Korea.
   ``Unification is a national aspiration. It can be freely
discussed by anybody,'' Roh said. But he said direct contacts with
North Korea must be made only through government channels.
   Police said 2,757 students have been arrested since Friday for
trying to march to the North Korean capital of Pyongyang for the
World Festival of Youth and Students, now under way.
   About half were released and the others were being detained for
questioning, police said. Six students arrested en route to the
border were charged Monday with violations of the national security
law.
   One of those who reached North Korea is Im Suk-yong, of Seoul's
Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. She faces arrest when she
returns.
   Intelligence agents are investigating how Miss Im obtained a
passport and funding for her trip and whether there is a connection
between her trip and that of Suh.
   Intelligence officials said they would send investigators to
Japan and West Germany, where both Suh and Miss Im were believed to
have contacted anti-South Korean organizations before proceeding to
Pyongyang.
   Suh's case was considered more serious than the trip to the North
in March by a leading dissident clergyman, the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan,
who is on trial. Officials noted Suh was a legislator and unlike
Moon's visit, the trip was kept secret by both Suh and North Korea.

   A Taiwanese fishing trawler
loaded with frozen squid ran aground Monday, but the crew was
rescued by a South African air force helicopter.
   The 340-ton Mengya 366, on its way home to Taiwan after leaving
Cape Town on Saturday, signaled it had run aground after hitting a
submerged object in rough waters less than a mile from the mouth of
the Tsitsikamma River in southern South Africa.
   The accident site, west of Cape St. Francis, is known for its
rugged coastline.
   The air force helicopter plucked the crewmen from the vessel and
flew them to the beach, according to the South African Broadcasting
Corp. They were later transported by police to the town of
Humansdorp.

   China last year registered a deficit of $2.1
billion, down slightly from earlier estimates, Finance Minister Wang
Bingqian said Monday.
   Wang told the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress that final calculations put China's revenues in 1988 at $71
billion and its expenditures at $73.1 billion.
   In March, Wang had estimated the deficit at $2.16 billion, about
the same as China's 1987 deficit. The nation's deficit in 1986 was
about $1.89 billion. That was low by international standards,
representing only 3.4 percent of state revenue and 0.75 percent of
the gross national product.
   China's largest deficit was in 1979, when expenditures outweighed
revenues by $4.86 billion.
   Wang said $17 billion was appropriated for capital construction
last year. State investment in agricultural production and cultural,
scientific and health projects increased considerably last year, he
added, but did not give any figures.

   The Supreme Court ruling Monday giving states the
right to ban abortions in public hospitals and other
taxpayer-supported facilities comes as an apparently declining
number of such hospitals are performing the procedure.
   The number of public hospitals providing abortions in 1985 was
265, down from 331 in 1982, according to the latest complete
statistics from the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a private research
organization specializing in sexual issues.
   The total number of hospitals providing abortions in 1985 was
1,191, versus 1,405 in 1982, according to the institute.
   The institute had no figures on how many abortions are performed
in public hospitals.
   About 12 percent of the roughly 1.6 million abortions performed
in the United States each year are paid for with public money,
statistics indicate.
   The Supreme Court's rulings on Monday gave states the right to
ban the use of public hospitals or taxpayer-supported facilities to
perform abortions not necessary to save a woman's life. States may
also ban public employees from performing those abortions.
   In 1985, $66,171,000 in public money paid for 187,997 abortions,
according to the Guttmacher Institute. States paid for all but 484,
which were paid for by the federal government.
   In 1985, there were 1,588,550 abortions reported in the country,
11.8 percent of which were publicly funded. That percentage has
likely remained steady in succeeding years, the institute said.
   Thirteen percent of all abortions were performed in hospitals, 60
percent in abortion clinics, 23 percent in other clinics and 4
percent in physicians' offices, the institute reported.
   Abortion clinics made up only 15 percent of the providers, but
accounted for 60 percent of all abortions. Of all abortions
performed in 1985, 75 percent took place in facilities having annual
caseloads of at least 1,000.

<HEAD>Soviet Defense Minister Reappointed, But Just Barely</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov won his bid for
reappointment Monday, but his support among Soviet lawmakers was so
lukewarm that he would have been rejected without a last-minute
procedural change.
   Yazov, criticized by some members of the Supreme Soviet as too
conservative and too old for the post, garnered 256 votes in his
favor, with 77 against and 66 abstentions, Soviet television
reported.
   Legislators' ``main objections concerned the age of the
candidate,'' and his ``traditional way of thinking,'' the official
news agency Tass said.
   Others accused Yazov, 65, of paying too little attention to
soldiers' living conditions, Tass said.
   Earlier Monday, the legislature decided that to be confirmed,
nominees needed only a majority of those members actually attending
the session. Formerly, nominees needed a majority of the entire
542-member Supreme Soviet.
   The procedural change followed last Friday's failure by Vladimir
Kamentsev, the nominee for head of the Foreign Economic Commission,
to receive the required 272 votes from among about 400 legislators
attending. Tass said Monday a second vote would be held on his
confirmation.
   Yazov, who holds the rank of general of the army, was appointed
defense minister in May 1987. He replaced Sergei Sokolov, who was
fired after West German teen-ager Mathias Rust evaded Soviet air
defenses and landed his light aircraft in Red Square.
   Several legislators said other generals were more qualified than
Yazov, including the head of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen. Mikhail
Moiseyev, and Gen. Boris Gromov, who commanded Soviet troops in
Afghanistan.
   ``But a majority regarded the candidate's stand, set out in his
answers to deputies' questions, as convincing enough for his
appointment to the post of defense minister,'' Tass said.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev endorsed Yazov, saying he ``holds
progressive views'' and has made impressive contributions in
restructuring the Soviet armed forces, Tass said.
   Yazov, replying to questions from deputies, said the military
doctrine of the Soviet Union should be defined only by the political
leadership and that the job of the defense minister is to implement
that doctrine.
   The Supreme Soviet, which has been revamped under Gorbachev's
political reforms into a smaller, full-time legislature, has broken
in the past days from its traditional automatic approval of the
leadership's nominees.
   Last week its committees rejected seven nominees, including a
Gorbachev protege who was nominated to head the government's food
program. Under pressure from lawmakers, Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov
withdrew their names from consideration by the full body.
   The rejected nominees included Culture Minister Vasily Zakharov
and Vladimir Gribov, head of the State Bank.
   In other action at Monday's session, the Supreme Soviet approved
as finance minister Valentin Pavlov, who told the legislature he was
against introducing currency reforms until the economy improves,
Tass reported.
   It appointed Lev Ryabev as the cabinet's energy chief after
grilling him on his positions on atomic power stations and nuclear
waste disposal.
   As Yazov's nomination was debated, the Defense Ministry released
draft changes in military manuals to bring them in line with the
latest changes in the country's political structure, Tass said.
   The drafts give greater legal protection for individual soldiers
and call for improved living conditions for soldiers and their
families.
   The Supreme Soviet is aiming to complete the formation of the new
Soviet government, involving about 50 additional appointments, by
the end of this week, Gorbachev announced Monday.

   President Bush, welcoming the Supreme
Court decision allowing abortions to be restricted, said today the
court ``appears to have begun to restore to the people the ability
to protect the unborn.''
   Bush has voiced support for a constitutional amendment to
overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortions.
   ``We continue to believe that Roe v. Wade was incorrectly decided
and should be reversed,'' Bush's statement said.
   But, it said, ``by upholding the Missouri statute, the court
appears to have begun to restore to the people the ability to
protect the unborn.''
   Chief of Staff John Sununu told a White House briefing Bush would
continue to actively support a constitutional amendment. He said
today's ruling might help build support for one, ``now that the
court has moved incrementally in this direction.''
   In the written statement, Bush said: ``Americans obviously differ
over the difficult issue underlying this case _ the morality and
appropriate legal status of abortion.''
   ``Any decision in this area will stir strong feelings.
Nevertheless, I have confidence that the American people will
continue to express their deeply held convictions on this subject
within the bounds of civility and our legal institutions,'' Bush
continued.
   Earlier, he voiced condolences to the family of the late Soviet
President Andrei A. Gromyko.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president would
be playing golf this afternoon and had no plans to react personally
to the abortion decision.
   ``He hasn't had a chance to look at it yet,'' Fitzwater said when
asked if Bush had any immediate reaction to the court's decision.
   Bush told reporters he first met Gromyko in 1971 when Bush was
U.S. representative to the United Nations. Gromyko, longtime Soviet
foreign minister, died Sunday at age 79.
   ``I'd just like to send condolences to his son, Anatoly, who I
also know, and to the rest of the family,'' Bush told reporters as
he began the day with a 20-minute jog.
   Bush was asked for his reaction on the Supreme Court decision as
he played golf with professional Doug Sanders at a local course.
   ``My position is very well known,'' Bush said. ``And now, I'd
like to concentrate on something else,'' he added, brushing off
further questions.
   Bush also planned to treat his neighbors to a day-early
Independence Day fireworks celebration.
   ``I'm tired,'' Bush, 65, confessed Sunday after a day of jogging,
tennis, swimming, fishing, golf and then more fishing.
   Bush said Sunday he regretted the decision of Adm. William J.
Crowe to step down as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in
September.
   ``Very candidly, I'd like to have had him stay,'' Bush told
reporters on the golf course. ``He did an outstanding job and is
doing an outstanding job.''
   Crowe announced his decision Sunday on NBC-TV's ``Meet the
Press.''
   Hundreds of people were expected to line the shoreline of this
oceanside resort to watch the Bush fireworks this evening, to be set
off from his six-acre compound on Walker's Point by the same company
that did the 1986 Statue of Liberty fireworks in New York Harbor.
   Fitzwater said an anonymous donor helped subsidize the $20,000
display by the New Castle, Pa., company of pyrotechnics specialist
George Zambelli. Zambelli has said he expects to set off two tons of
aerial explosives in the 15-minute display.
   Bush's stand on abortion has changed since he supported the right
of a woman to choose an abortion when he first ran for president in
1980. More recently he has favored a constitutional amendment to
outlaw the procedure.
   It is one of four constitutional amendments Bush is advocating.
The others call for a balanced federal budget, line-item veto
authority on spending bills and, most recently, an amendment to
restore the right of states and Congress to ban flag-desecration, a
power the Supreme Court stripped away last week in a controversial
5-4 decision.
   The president's flag pronouncements won Bush a fair degree of
public support, including from Bartley's Dockside Restaurant in
downtown Kennebunkport, which displays a different sign out front
each time the president visits.
   This weekend's offering: ``Protecting our flag means protecting
our freedom. Thanks Mr. President. We're glad you're here.''
   Bush on Sunday jogged, went to church, swam, played tennis, got a
carry-out lunch in his boat, went ocean fishing, played nine holes
of golf and then waded into the Kennebunk River to cast for striped
bass.
   Aides said the president also planned during his five-day
extended holiday to bone up with briefing books for his upcoming
trip to Poland, Hungary and the seven-nation economic summit. But so
far his days have been crammed with recreational activities.
   Thirty-five members of the Bush family are in town for the
Independence Day festivities.
   After morning services at St. Ann's Episcopal Church, Bush
plunged into a crowd of several hundred onlookers who had gathered
outside, shaking hands and wishing people well.
   ``I hope we get out there on the water, do some fun stuff,'' Bush
told one person in the crowd.
   The Independence Day fireworks have become a Bush family
tradition in recent years.
   However, because this year's display was to be more ambitious
than previous ones, the Bush fireworks were moved up to Monday night
so they would not compete with town fireworks scheduled for the
Fourth of July.

   Former Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko, the dour
diplomat who served and survived every Soviet leader from Josef
Stalin until Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ``new thinking'' pushed him out,
has died at age 79.
   A tough negotiator, he helped guide Soviet foreign policy through
the twists of Cold War and detente whoever was in charge at the
Kremlin.
   Gromyko spent 28 years as foreign minister and held several other
government and Communist Party posts over half a century, including
the then-largely ceremonial post of president, but was a private
citizen in retirement when he died Sunday, 16 days before his 80th
birthday. He lost his last position, a seat on the party Central
Committee, in April.
   No cause of death was announced, but a Foreign Ministry spokesman
said Friday that Gromyko had undergone surgery for an unspecified
vascular problem. Soviet TV, in a five-minute announcement reviewing
Gromyko's life, said he died after ``a long illness.''
   Gorbachev announced the statesman's death Monday in a session of
the Supreme Soviet legislature.
   ``His whole life was connected with history, with our
achievements, our problems, with everything that falls on the lot of
a person in the thick of events for whole decades,'' Gorbachev said
after deputies observed a minute of silence.
   Tass, the official news agency, called Gromyko ``one of the major
Soviet diplomats and statesmen of the senior generation.''
   Gromyko was the ultimate technocrat and a model bureaucrat,
executing policy without shaping it. With no political constituency
of his own, he posed no threat to the Kremlin hierarchy _ a surefire
formula for surviving.
   As a diplomat and foreign minister, Gromyko helped forge the
alliance that won World War II. He joined in drafting the U.N.
Charter and participated in superpower talks that shaped the modern
world.
   He outlasted Stalin, Nikita S. Khrushchev, Leonid I. Brezhnev,
Yuri V. Andropov and Konstantin U. Chernenko. As an ambassador, he
served in the United States, Britain and the United Nations.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said Gromyko
``was part of our history, with all its good sides and all its bad
sides,'' and historians should judge whether his ``influence was
good or bad.'' Gerasimov spoke to reporters in Paris where he had
gone in advance of a visit by Gorbachev.
   The funeral will be held Wednesday after the body lies in state
for five hours in the Red Banner Hall at Soviet army headquarters,
the nightly news program ``Vremya'' reported.
   Burial will be at Novodevichy Cemetery, the second most
prestigious resting place after the Kremlin, it said. Khrushchev,
Anastas I. Mikoyan and Vyacheslav M. Molotov are buried there.
   In a condolence statement on behalf of the U.S. government,
President Bush noted that Gromyko ``knew every U.S. president from
Franklin Roosevelt to George Bush, and every secretary of state from
Cordell Hull to James Baker.''
   Gromyko's death ``marks the passing of a generation that
witnessed many of the most historic events of this century,'' Bush
said.
   James Callaghan, the former British prime minister and foreign
secretary, said Gromyko ``was a good executor of a bad foreign
policy that has now changed.''
   Jean Francois-Poncet, a former French foreign minister, said
Gromyko ``was certainly one of those who incited the Soviet Union to
invade Afghanistan, and as a consequence, one of those whom Mr.
Gorbachev wanted to put ... aside.'' U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock
said: ``Even when relations were difficult, he was always
professionally courteous and considerate.''
   Andrei Andreyevich Gromyko was born July 18, 1909, into a
Byelorussian peasant family.
   During World War II, he took over the Foreign Ministry's U.S.
section and was appointed ambassador to Washington in 1943, at 39
the youngest ambassador in Soviet history.
   His career took him to Tehran, Potsdam and Yalta, where one story
says Winston Churchill threw cigar butts at Gromyko after he
whispered into Stalin's ear that he should demand Germany's
unconditional surrender.
   Gromyko stepped down as the first Soviet ambassador to the United
Nations in 1948 but returned almost annually to rail against U.S.
policies.
   Some observers attributed Gromyko's political longevity to his
flexibility, diplomatic expertise and apparent disinterest in
obtaining power for himself. He was not admitted to the Politburo
until 1973.
   Khrushchev, who appointed Gromyko foreign minister in 1957 and
often insulted him, once said in his presence: ``If I tell him to
sit on an iceberg, he'll stay there and freeze, but he won't move.''
   Gromyko gained a reputation as ``Mr. Nyet'' for casting frequent
vetoes as U.N. ambassador. He was nicknamed ``Grim Grom'' because he
rarely smiled, and his craggy face was instantly recognizable to the
world.
   During Andropov's leadership in 1982-84, Gromyko's star rose. In
March 1983, he became first deputy premier in addition to foreign
minister and Politburo member.
   When Gorbachev gained power in 1985, Gromyko supported his
reforms and displayed official respect even when the new leadership
condemned some foreign policy decisions taken during his tenure,
including the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
   Gromyko did not escape unscathed.
   A delegate to a party conference last summer suggested he and
others who shaped policy in the Brezhnev era resign. The delegate
was rebuffed, but Gromyko was dropped from the ruling Politburo and
presidency a few months later.
   To replace Gromyko as foreign minister in 1985, Gorbachev chose
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, a party official with no previous foreign
experience, to represent ``new thinking'' intended to dispel the
Kremlin's ``enemy image'' and improve relations abroad.
   Gromyko served as president, a largely ceremonial post, after
Shevardnadze replaced him. Gorbachev, in taking over the job of
president Oct. 1, has transformed it into a powerful executive
position.
   Gromyko had not appeared in public for months and little was
known about his health. He is believed to have suffered a mild
stroke several years ago that may have partially paralyzed his face
and affected his speech.
   At the U.N. General Assembly in September 1978, he slumped while
speaking and had to be escorted away. He returned to the podium an
hour later and finished the speech.
   Many officials have been dismissed and written out of official
history books when new leaders took over the Kremlin, but Gromyko
ended his career gracefully after helping vote Gorbachev into power.
   Former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance praised Gromyko's skill.
   ``As a thoroughly professional practitioner of the diplomatic
trade, he has few peers in the modern world,'' Vance said. ``He
represents his country with great skill, high intelligence and
spirit, tempered in decades of experience.''
   Behind Gromyko's poker face was a sharp wit. Asked once whether
he had enjoyed his breakfast, he replied: ``Perhaps.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Frees States to Impose Restrictions on Abortions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A divided Supreme Court ruled Monday that
states are free to impose new restrictions on abortions, igniting
intense reaction and throwing the volatile issue back to the
legislatures.
   In an end-of-the term decision cheered by abortion foes, the
justices stopped short of overturning a 1973 ruling under which
women have the right to seek abortions. But in a series of rulings,
many of them 5-4, they upheld several provisions of a Missouri law
that imposed new restraints and signaled they might be willing to
impose greater restrictions in cases to be heard next year.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, author of the 1973 ruling, said
Monday's ``very ominous'' decision in a Missouri abortion dispute
suggests the court may scrap Roe vs. Wade as early as next year. ``A
chill wind blows,'' he said.
   An impatient Justice Antonin Scalia, who voted Monday to reverse
the 1973 ruling, wrote, ``It appears that the mansion of
constitutionalized abortion law, constructed overnight in Roe vs.
Wade, must be disassembled door-jamb by door-jamb.''
   Anti-abortion activists hailed the decision. ``We are thumbs up
all the way,'' said John Willke, president of the National Right to
Life Committee. Elaine Bingham, a spokeswoman for Operation Rescue,
said, ``This is the first step in overturning Roe vs. Wade.''
   Such a reversal would leave states free to impose stringent
regulations on _ or even outlaw _ abortion.
   For the past decade, some 1.5 million legal abortions have been
performed each year in the United States.
   Abortion rights advocates reacted angrily.
   ``This is war against women,'' said Molly Yard, president of the
National Organization for Women. ``Pretty soon nothing much will be
left for a woman in controlling her reproductive life.''
   By 5-4 votes, the justices reversed a federal appeals court
ruling that had invalidated key provisions of a Missouri abortion
law.
   Perhaps most significantly, the court's slim majority ruled that
states may require doctors to determine through various testing
whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old is ``viable,'' or capable of
surviving outside the womb. Missouri and many states make it a crime
to abort a viable fetus.
   Roe vs. Wade, which said women have a constitutional right to
abortion, prohibited states from protecting fetal life until the
24th week of a pregnancy.
   The 1973 landmark said a woman's decision to have an abortion
during the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and
her doctor. It said states may regulate abortions during the second
trimester only to protect the woman's health, and may take steps to
protect fetal life in the third trimester.
   State authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester
was not made absolute, however.

   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, author of the
Supreme Court's abortion-legalizing opinion in 1973, said Monday the
court's new decision sets the stage for an outright ban that would
``cast in darkness the hope of every woman in this country.''
   ``For today, the women of this nation still retain the liberty to
control their destinies,'' Blackmun wrote. ``But the signs are
evident and very ominous, and a chill wind blows.''
   Blackmun, 80, acknowledged that the landmark Roe vs. Wade
decision of 1973 remains in place and abortion remains legal. But he
was critical of what he called the court's silence on the
implications of its ruling upholding Missouri restrictions on
abortion.
   ``By refusing to explain or justify its proposal,'' Blackmun
said, the court ``invites charges of cowardice and illegitimacy to
our door.''
   ``The silence is callous,'' Blackmun said during an unusual
nine-minute reading of his opinion from the bench. ``It is also
profoundly disruptive of this court as an institution.''
   In his opinion, Blackmun said three court members _ Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White and Anthony M.
Kennedy _ were trying to overrule Roe vs. Wade ``silently,'' and
accused that triumvirate of ``going about its business in ... a
deceptive fashion.''
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, who joined in the dissent, watched
intently as Blackmun read it in a calm voice in the Supreme Court
chamber. Other justices had impassive expressions.
   Blackmun said that reversal of Roe vs. Wade would force hundreds
of thousands of women each year to ``defy the law and place their
health and safety in the unclean and unsympathetic hands of
back-alley abortionists. Or they would attempt to perform abortions
upon themselves with disastrous results.
   ``Every year, many women, especially poor and minority women,
would die or suffer debilitating trauma, all in the name of enforced
morality or religious dictates or lack of compassion as it may be.''
   Blackmun was considered a conservative when named to the court by
then-President Nixon. But he soon carved out an place among court
moderates.
   ``When one is here, he develops his constitutional philosophy. I
would hope that in that respect I at least have grown,'' he said in
a 1986 interview. ``I'd like to think that I am a little more
sensitive to basic rights than I was before.''

<TEXT>
   The historic Treaty Oak, which has provided
shade for generations of Texans, will itself be shaded as part of
the effort to save the majestic tree that was poisoned with a
herbicide.
   ``The whole plan of attack is to try and minimize the stress on
the tree,'' Paul Roberts, an environmental specialist with the
Austin Parks and Recreation Department, said Monday.
   Later this week, 40-foot screens will be stretched across sets of
poles on the east and west sides of the 65-foot-high, centuries-old
tree. The mesh screens are made of a fabric similar to the kind used
to block sun and wind at tennis courts.
   ``There is tender foliage up there. It would be real easy to fry
it,'' Roberts said. He said the screens will reduce sunlight hitting
the tree by 50 percent to 60 percent.
   ``We're coming into a real stressful period for the tree. We can
expect upper 90s, 100-degrees for the next two months,'' he said.
   Legend has it Stephen F. Austin, the father of Texas, made peace
with Indians under the tree's branches.
   Leaves have turned brown and fallen off the tree since it was
poisoned with the potent herbicide Velpar, in what police say was a
ritual act to cast a spell or curse. Police have charged a man with
criminal mischief; he could get 20 years in prison.
   Workers are replacing soil that was excavated around the tree to
a depth of about 30 inches to remove any herbicide residue.
   In addition, 12 sprinkler heads have been placed in the tree's
canopy to mist the foliage with water five minutes per hour to cool
the tree, Roberts said.
   Latest test results indicate the tree was poisoned with more
Velpar than first suspected, nearly three times the amount needed to
kill the tree.
   But tree experts determined the poison did not seep as far down
in the ground as had been feared, said Bill Edelbrock, another
environmental specialist with the parks department.
   The poison travels through a plant's roots and into the leaves,
and when the leaves fall the poison they contain soaks into the
ground and the cycle begins again, Edelbrock said. ``We're out there
raking up leaves every day,'' he said.

<HEAD>Movie Shootout Erupts Over Popcorn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An argument between two men over who was first in
a popcorn line before the start of the movie ``Batman'' ended with a
deadly shootout Monday in a crowded theater, police said.
   ``The concession stand was running out of popcorn,'' said
Detective Christopher Horn.
   While they argued, one man threatened to get a gun from his car.
``The victim says, `Go ahead,' gets his popcorn and goes into the
movie theater,'' Horn said.
   The gunman, who did not get any popcorn, soon returned to the
theater, at a complex in the borough of the Bronx, and found a seat,
and then ``he spotted the guy across the aisle, three or four rows
down,'' Horn said.
   While the movie credits were rolling, ``The suspect yells
something like, `Hey, are you the guy with the popcorn?'''
   ``Then they both stand up and the guns come out,'' Horn said. The
victim squeezed off one shot from a .38-caliber handgun; his
assailant fired two shots, one of which struck the victim in the
head. No one else was hurt.
   The gunman fled. The victim, described as a man in his 20s, was
pronounced dead at the scene, Horn said.
   A manager at the complex, Brad Wick, said he could not comment.

<HEAD>States Can Enact Tougher Hazardous Substances Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday refused to bar
states from imposing rules on labeling hazardous workplace
substances that are more rigorous or extensive than federal
regulations.
   The court, without comment, rejected a challenge to a New Jersey
law by business and industry representatives who said federal law
preempts such state rules.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last February upheld a
federal judge's ruling that allowed New Jersey officials to enforce
that state's Worker and Community Right to Know Act of 1983.
   The appeals court said the judge was ``not clearly erroneous'' in
deciding the state law ``does not stand as an obstacle to the
accomplishment of the purposes'' of the federal Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970.
   The two laws are similar in their aim, requiring employers to
warn workers of hazardous materials. The New Jersey law also is
intended to warn the public about potential threats to the
environment.
   The state law goes further than the federal law in some respects.
New Jersey requires all chemical containers to be labeled, while the
federal law requires only containers of hazardous chemicals to be
labeled.
   The state requires that the five most predominant substances in a
mixture be labeled; the federal law does not.
   And New Jersey requires most labels to include the chemical name
and a special number used to identify the substance. The federal law
requires the chemical or common name, but not the number.
   The state law was challenged by the New Jersey Chamber of
Commerce and numerous chemical, flavor and fragrance manufacturers.
   They said dual labeling would confuse and overwhelm workers.
   The 2nd Circuit court said there was adequate testimony by
opposing experts that proper worker training would clear up any
confusion.
   The cases are New Jersey Chamber of Commerce vs. Hughey, 88-1845,
and Fragrance Materials Association vs. Van Note, 88-1868.

<HEAD>Bush Hails Supreme Court Decision on Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday hailed the
Supreme Court decision on abortion as a beginning ``to restore to
the people the ability to protect the unborn.''
   But a top aide said Bush does not plan to campaign on the issue
in the states that now will have the power to restrict abortions.
   The president also cautioned Americans who have strong feelings
on the issue to ``continue to express their deeply held convictions
on this subject within the bounds of civility and our legal
institutions.''
   In a two-paragraph statement released by his staff while he was
on the golf course during his five-day Maine vacation, Bush said:
``We welcome this decision ... The court appears to have begun to
restore to the people the ability to protect the unborn.''
   Chief of Staff John Sununu told reporters that Bush continues to
support a so-called human life amendment to the Constitution that
would bar abortion.
   Anti-abortion members of Congress have repeatedly pressed for
such an amendment without success.
   Bush supports the approach of Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said
Sununu. However, Hyde has not introduced a constitutional amendment,
but rather an amendment to the Health and Human Services
approprations bill that would bar use of federal funds for abortion
except when the mother's life is endangered.
   Bush's position on abortion is that it should be allowed only in
cases of rape, incest or endangerment to the life of the mother.
   While Sununu was briefing reporters, Bush was playing golf for
much of the afternoon. The president deflected questions on the
abortion issue from reporters who accompanied him to the golf
course, referring them to the statement his staff released.
   ``Not when I'm doing this,'' he said swinging his golf club. His
written statement, he said, would express his ``very strong
feelings. My position is very well known and now I'd like to
concentrate on something else.''
   Sununu said Bush had been on the telephone with White House legal
counsel Boyden Gray and other advisers talking about the ``legal
nuances'' of the ruling. He said it would merit further analysis,
but that Bush wished initially to put out a statement expressing his
support for the direction the court took.
   ``This is the kind of issue that he is strongly supportive of but
he understands that it moves now out into the states.''
   With Monday's court decision restoring to the states the powers
to restrict abortion rights, Sununu noted, many states now will see
legislative efforts to restrict abortion. Bush does not intend to
personally lead the crusade for legal changes in those states, said
Sununu.
   ``He would probably continue to speak on it as a national issue
rather than carrying the concern into the state capitals,'' Sununu
said.
   Asked about a controversy that arose in last year's presidential
campaign when Bush indicated during a debate with Democratic
contender Michael Dukakis that a woman who has an abortion should be
penalized, Sununu said that Bush did not want that result from
future state laws on abortion.
   ``When laws are written, we would hope that they would focus on
those who perform the abortion.''
   Bush's staff hastened after last year's debate to say that Bush
had not intended to call for penalties against women who had
abortions.
   The Monday ruling stopped short of overturning the historic 1973
Supreme Court Roe Vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion.
   Bush said in his statement that that decision ``was incorrectly
decided and should be reversed.''
   The president opposes violent activism such as the arson fire at
a Concord abortion clinic that occurred just hours before Monday's
high court ruling, said Sununu.
   ``Violent protest is against the law. Whoever is involved in that
should be apprehended and punished.'' he added.

<HEAD>Excerpts From High Court Ruling on Religious Displays</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Scotus-Religion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from Monday's Supreme Court
decision limiting religious displays on government property.
   From Justice Harry A. Blackmun's majority opinion:
   Precisely because of the religious diversity that is our national
heritage, the founders added to the Constitution a Bill of Rights,
the very first words of which declare: ``Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof.'' Perhaps in the early days of the Republic these
words were understood to protect only the diversity within
Christianity, but today they are recognized as guaranteeing
religious diversity and equality to the infidel, the atheist, or the
adherent of a non-Christian faith such as Islam or Judaism.
   Whether the key word is endorsement, favoritism or promotion, the
essential principle remains the same. The Establishment Clause, at
the very least, prohibits government from appearing to take a
position on questions of religious belief.
   The government's use of religious symbolism is unconstitutional
if it has the effect of endorsing religious beliefs, and the effect
of the government's use of religious symbolism depends upon its
context. Accordingly, our present task is to determine whether the
display of the creche and the menorah, in their respective
particular physical settings, has the effect of endorsing or
disapproving religious beliefs.
   The creche in this lawsuit uses words, as well as the picture of
the nativity scene, to make its religious meaning unmistakably
clear. Here ... nothing in the context of the display detracts from
the creche's religious message ... The county sends an unmistakable
message that it supports and promotes the Christian praise to God
that is the creche's religious message.
   Government may celebrate Christmas in some manner and form, but
not in a way that endorses Christian doctrine. Here, Allegheny
County has transgressed this line.
   The display of the Chanukah menorah in front of the City-County
Building may well present a closer constitutional question. The
menorah, one must recognize, is a religious symbol ... But the
menorah's message is not exclusively religious. The menorah is the
primary visual symbol for a holiday that, like Christmas, has both
religious and secular dimensions.
   Moreover, the menorah here stands next to a Christams tree and a
sign saluting liberty ... The display of the menorah is not an
endorsement of religious faith but simply a recognition of cultural
diversity.
   For purposes of the Establishment Clause, the city's overall
display must be understood as conveying the city's secular
recognition of different traditions for celebrating the winter
holiday season.
   
   From Justice William J. Brennan's partly concurring and partly
dissenting opinion:
   The city's erection alongside the Christmas tree of the symbol of
a relatively minor Jewish religious holiday, far from conveying the
city's secular recognition of different traditions for celebrating
the winter holiday season or a message of pluralism and freedom of
belief has the effect of promoting a Christianized version of
Judaism.
   
   From Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's partly concurring and partly
dissenting opinion:
   The majority holds that the County of Allegheny violated the
Establishment Clause by displaying a creche in the county courthouse
because the principal or primary effect of the display is to advance
religion. This view of the Establishment Clause reflects an
unjustified hostility toward religion, a hostility inconsistent with
our history and our precedents and I dissent from this holding. The
creche display is constitutional and, for the same reasons, the
display of a menorah by the city of Pittsburgh is permissible as
well.
   Obsessive, implacable resistance to all but the most carefully
scripted and secularized forms of accommodation requires this court
to act as a censor, issuing national decrees as to what is orthodox
and what is not. What is orthodox in this context means what is
secular; the only Christmas the state can acknowledge is one in
which references to religion have been held to a minimum. The court
thus lends its assistance to an Orwellian rewriting of history as I
understand it.

<HEAD>Trial of Former Bakker Aides To Begin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The inner workings of PTL founder Jim
Bakker's televangelism empire will provide the backdrop for the
federal tax evasion trial of two of his former aides that opens
Wednesday.
   Brothers David and James Taggart are accused of diverting about
$1.1 million in PTL money to pay their personal expenses, including
$55,000 for items bought at the exclusive Cartier jewelry store in
New York.
   The defendants were known for extravagant purchases and their
wardrobes included mink coats and designer clothes. They bought a
$660,000 condominium on Fifth Avenue in New York and a $317,000 home
in southeast Charlotte. In 1986, they gave each other Jaguars for
Christmas at a cost of nearly $90,000.
   The Taggarts were indicted in December on charges they evaded
about $494,000 in income taxes from 1983-87. The indictment came out
the same day that Bakker and his former top aide, Richard Dortch,
were indicted on charges of mail and wire fraud.
   Bakker and Dortch's trial on charges of diverting more than $4
million of PTL money to their own use and conspiring to defraud PTL
contributors is scheduled to open Aug. 28 in Charlotte. However, a
hearing will be held Wednesday to decide whether to move their trial
because of extensive national and local publicity.
   U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor wanted to conduct the hearing behind
closed doors, but several news organizations appealed his decision.
On June 27, a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Richmond ruled the hearing should be open.
   Dortch is also trying to get a separate trial. Taylor may rule on
that motion Wednesday.
   The witness list for the Taggarts' trial looks like a ``Who's
Who'' of televangelism, as Justice Department attorneys David Brown
and Joseph Bender may call evangelists Jerry Falwell, John Wesley
Fletcher, Rex Humbard and Rex Humbard Jr.
   Defense attorney Ben Cotten's witnesses could include Bakker's
daughter, Tammy Sue Chapman, and a former PTL board member, the Rev.
Aimee Cortese.
   Cotten has said he believed the Taggarts' lifestyles and their
relationship with Bakker would be the focus of the case.
   ``If I were the government, I would try to stress that these
people live high on the hog, and now it's time to pay the piper,''
he told the Charlotte Observer.
   But Cotten insisted his clients are innocent.
   ``There never was an intent to do anything,'' he said. ``There's
no question some taxes may be owed. The question is how and why that
came about. That's what this case is going to be about.''
   Prosecutors argue that David Taggart, 32, who was Bakker's
personal aide, and James Taggart, 35, PTL's former interior
decorator, used PTL credit cards to get large cash advances. The
indictment alleged they used the cash to pay personal bills.
   Prosecutors allege the Taggarts also used blank PTL checks to pay
American Express bills, and that two of those checks totaled $95,000.
   During jury selection, U.S. District Judge Robert Potter asked 48
potential jurors more than 80 questions, including whether they were
familiar with brand names such as Gucci, Jaguar, Cartier and
Mercedes-Benz. He also asked if they used credit cards, checks or
cash to pay for purchases and if they shopped in ``fine stores.''
   If convicted, the Taggarts each could be sentenced to 30 years in
prison and face fines totaling $1.35 million.

<TEXT>
   Producers of rabbiteye blueberries are urged to
be on the lookout for an newly discovered insect friend _ a bee with
a long tongue.
   The Agriculture Department said Monday that honey bees can't
pollinate rabbiteye blueberries because their tongues are too short.
But the new bee's tongue is longer and can reach into the
blueberry's flower for nectar.
   As it probes the flower with its long tongue, the bee also buzzes
it to loosen a cloud of pollen, said Jerry A. Payne, an entomologist
with the department's Agricultural Research Service.
   When the bee moves on, it carries pollen from one blueberry
flower to another, achieving pollination. Payne, who works at the
agency's Southeastern Fruit and Tree Nut Research Laboratory, Byron,
Ga., said in a report issued here that poor crops of rabbiteye
blueberries often result from poor cross pollination.
   The ground-nesting bee, Habropoda loboriosa, was found during a
three-year study with Auburn University in Alabama. The bee is
prevalent in the southeastern United States where rabbiteye
blueberries are grown on approximately 5,000 acres.
   Payne said the bee, which has been named the Southeastern
blueberry bee, is larger than a honey bee but smaller than a bumble
bee. The female has a black face minus a cream-colored dot that
distinguishes the male. Only the female gathers pollen.
   Depending on the season, consumers pay from $2 to $5 a pint for
rabbiteye blueberries.
   ``We don't know much about the bee's nesting habits,'' Payne
said. ``Therefore, we don't have any way yet to reintroduce it if
nests are destroyed. So we advice growers not to use insecticides
when blueberries bloom.''

   Lisa Robertson wondered just how warm
her welcome would be when she returned to her hometown last week
after winning the Miss Tennessee title.
   This southeastern Tennessee town, after all, is dominated by the
Seventh-day Adventist church, which discourages not only the wearing
of jewelry and makeup, but also any secular activities on Saturday,
the church's day of worship.
   And here was Miss Robertson, herself a church member, winning a
pageant held on a Saturday night while decked out in a sparkling
tiara and vivid cosmetics.
   But she needn't have worried.
   ``There were balloons on my driveway, a huge banner across the
house, and fire trucks escorted me in,'' Miss Robertson said Sunday.
``I was given a key to the city and a plaque as an honored alumnus
of Southern College.'' The school is a Seventh-day Adventist college.
   Miss Robertson, 23, acknowledged that some residents in this town
outside Chattanooga probably don't approve of her involvement in the
Miss America Pageant.
   ``But they haven't spoken up. And it doesn't violate my
conscience at all,'' she said. ``It doesn't bother me to things on
Saturday. I've come to my own peace about that.''
   As Miss Tennessee, she gets a crack at the Miss America crown in
September's pageant.

   The Army announced Monday it has temporarily
grounded its entire fleet of AH-64 attack helicopters while it
investigates the cause of a crash in Florida last week.
   The AH-64 Apache is the nation's newest and most sophisticated
helicopter gunship. The Army now has 486 of them in its inventory.
   The grounding follows last Thursday's crash in northern Florida
of an Apache gunship assigned to the Florida National Guard. The
co-pilot was killed and the pilot was seriously injured when the
tail rotor came off the aircraft, the Army said.
   The Army said it is analyzing the tail rotor assembly from the
gunship that crashed in Florida. The enginering study is expected to
take ``several days'' to complete, the service added, but could be
finished in as little as two days.
   The Apache fleet was last grounded in August 1987 while
investigators studied the failure of one component of the tail
rotor. The Army said Monday, however, it had already ruled out that
problem as a factor in last week's crash.
   The Apache fleet was grounded twice in 1986, both times for
relatively minor problems.
   The Apache is replacing the Cobra helicopter gunship as the
Army's primary attack helicopter. Designed to destroy enemy tanks,
the Apache is a twin-engine copter and is loaded with Hellfire and
Hydra 7 missiles and a 30mm cannon.
   It is built by McDonnell Douglas Helicopters, formerly Hughes
Helicopters, and costs roughly $13 million apiece.
   The Army said its engineering analysis was being performed at the
Corpus Christi, Texas, Army Depot under the guidance of the U.S.
Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker, Ala.
   While the Army has acquired 486 Apaches to date, 94 of those are
currently out of service because of damage sustained during a freak
wind storm on May 13 at Fort Hood, Texas.

   The Agriculture Department asked Monday for
public comments for designing the 1990 feed grains program.
   Officials said that one of the main items will involve how much
land farmers will be required to set aside in order to qualify for
price supports and other benefits on 1990 crops of corn, sorghum,
oats and, if designated, barley.
   The 1985 farm law requires the annual set-aside to be at least
12.5 percent and no more than 20 percent of a producer's acreage

<HEAD>Study Says Independent Body Should Buy Pentagon's Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration should set up a weapons
``procurement corps'' independent of the Pentagon to eliminate
conflicts of interest in Defense Department buying practices, a
private group study said Monday.
   ``The only way to stop the arming of our military with defective
weapons is to take responsibility for buying those weapons away from
the military,'' said Louis Nemeth, co-author of the study by the
Ralph Nader's Center for Study of Responsive Law.
   ``We're spending billions of dollars for planes that can't fly,
missiles that can't find their destinations and tanks that can't
roll,'' Nemeth said. ``The Pentagon has over and over proven itself
unwilling or unable to improve our procurement process.''
   The study cited a number of reasons for the Pentagon's weapons
problems, including overreliance on new technologies, insufficient
testing of new weapons, inadequate competition among contract
bidders and a ``revolving door'' between the Pentagon procurement
system and private defense contractors.
   It also blamed members of Congress for judging new weapons
projects on the potential economic payoff for their own state or
district rather than the actual need for the weapons.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney recently forwarded to President
Bush a package of recommendations for improving management of the
Pentagon, including changes in the procurement process. Details of
Cheney's recommendations have not been made public.
   The Nader group's study cited numerous weapons systems that have
been plagued by previously reported problems, including the
Midgetman and MX Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles,
the M-1 Abrams tank, the F-14 Tomcat fighter jet and the Bradley
Fighting Vehicle. It said this formed a pattern of ineffective
Pentagon control of procurement that undermines U.S. security.
   Among the study's recommended reforms:
   _Establish a ``procurement'' corps of weapons experts independent
of the Defense Department and the military services, to manage all
phases of weapons system acquisition. It would analyze the services'
weapons requests, determine when development of new systems was
needed, award production contracts and oversee testing.
   _Increase competitive bidding, in part by inviting foreign
military contractors to participate in design competitions.
   _End the practice of beginning production of a new weapon system
before the development stage has been completed.

   The following is a transcript of
President Bush's written statement in reaction to Monday's Supreme
Court decision restoring state powers to regulate abortion:
   We welcome this decision. By upholding the Missouri statute, the
court appears to have begun to restore to the people the ability to
protect the unborn. We continue to believe that Roe vs. Wade was
incorrectly decided, and should be reviewed.
   Americans obviously differ over the difficult issue underlying
this case _ the morality and appropriate legal status of abortion.
Any decision in this area will stir strong feelings. Nevertheless, I
have confidence that the American people will continue to express
their deeply held convictions on this subject within the bounds of
civility and our legal institutions.

   Secretary of State James
A. Baker III was flying to Japan Monday, intent on keeping
U.S.-Japanese relations on an even keel despite the setbacks
suffered by the government of Prime Minister Sosuke Uno.
   Talking to reporters while en route here for a refueling stop,
Baker said it is important to ``studiously avoid involving ourselves
in the internal affairs of the government of Japan.''
   Uno's Liberal Democratic Party was handed a stinging defeat in
municipal elections Monday, and the prime minister has been fighting
allegations that he kept several paid mistresses. Uno has denied the
reports.
   Baker was asked whether inviting Uno to a dinner Tuesday evening
was an attempt to deflect attention from Uno's problems.
   Baker indicated that he disagreed with the premise of the
question.
   He said stability in U.S.-Japanese relations is important not
just for the Pacific region but for the world as a whole.
   During his talks in Tokyo, Baker said he will emphasize the need
for the world's two largest economies to form a ``global
partnership.''
   Some analysts believe that the accumulation of problems over the
past month may force Uno to resign soon.
   The main purpose of Baker's visit is to take part in a conference
of donor nations on a proposed $10 billion, five-year multilateral
assistance and investment program for the Philippines.
   The meeting is being held under the sponsorship of the World Bank
with participation by the European Economic Community, Canada,
Australia and the United States, among others.
   The Bush administration has asked Congress for $200 million as
the U.S. contribution for the first year.
   Baker said he strongly supports the multilateral effort, arguing
that the Philippines is now on a democratic path and still faces a
determined communist insurgency.
   Questioned on another subject, Baker said he didn't find it
``particularly disturbing'' that two communists have been named to
the newly formed cabinet in Greece, a NATO ally.
   Baker noted that the coalition government in Greece has only a
three-month life expectancy and that, in any case, neither of the
posts occupied by communists deals with defense or foreign policy.
   After a day in Tokyo, Baker will fly to Brunei where he will meet
with his colleagues from the six-nation Association of Southeast
Asian Nations.
   One goal of that meeting is to try to find ways of avoiding civil
war in Cambodia after Vietnamese forces complete their scheduled
troop withdrawal in September.
   After two days in Brunei, Baker heads for Poland where he will
link up with President Bush for his four-nation European visit.
   He has a rest stop of a day and a half in Oman en route to Poland.

<HEAD>Suspension of Priest ``Virtually Assured'' for Starting New Church</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. George Stallings, founder of an
unauthorized new congregation for black Catholics, is ``virtually
assured'' of being suspended as a priest, a Roman Catholic official
said Monday.
   ``The penalty is given in such cases not for punishment, but in
hopes of reconciliation,'' said the Rev. William Lori, secretary to
Cardinal James A. Hickey, archbishop of Washington. He said he
thought Hickey would act ``quite soon.''
   Lori said Hickey might make a decision by Wednesday, three days
after Stallings celebrated the first mass of his Imani Temple.
   Should Stallings be suspended, he would lose his right to preach,
celebrate mass or officiate at weddings and funerals, Lori said.
   Efforts to reach Stallings by telephone for comment were
unsuccessful.
   Stallings, a convert to Catholicism, said Sunday, ``The church
can't throw me out, and even if they do throw me out, I have my own
opinion ... they have theirs.''
   He said he created his congregation because the established Roman
Catholic Church is not responsive to the cultural and spiritual
needs of black parishioners.
   The church hierarchy is not opposed to Stallings' efforts, only
the way he is going about them, said Lori, the cardinal's secretary.
   ``As Catholics, we look to the bishop for overall guidance on
when to establish a new parish,'' Lori said. ``We can't have a
priest setting up a new parish and saying, `Hey, we have a better
product over here.'''
   Eileen Marks, a spokeswoman for the archdiocese, said that more
than 40 parishes in the Washington area incorporate elements of the
African-American culture Stallings plans to emphasize in his
services.
   The ceremony at his church Sunday included traditional Catholic
prayers and liturgy, along with elements borrowed from African and
Southern black revival traditions. Black representatives of other
faiths, including Baptists and Muslims, attended to show support for
Stallings' move.
   At one point, Stallings told his congregation, ``We can't wait.
How much longer does the Roman Catholic Church need?''
   Later, he said, ``We can't just be sitting on the pew anymore.
We've got to start standing up on the promises.''
   Since Stallings announced his plans two weeks ago, he has been on
a collision course with church leaders.
   ``In spite of his claims to the contrary, Father Stallings'
action is a serious step toward separating himself from the Roman
Catholic Church,'' Hickey said recently in a statement.
   ``This situation has more to do with the needs and expectations
of Father Stallings than with broader questions about the adequacy
of Catholic ministry within the black community,'' Hickey said.
   Lori said Monday, ``Suspension is virtually assured.''
   Stallings said last week he had been fired by Hickey as
evangelist for the archdiocese, but Lori said no official action had
yet been taken.
   If Stallings is suspended, church officials will continue meeting
with him in hopes of solving their differences, Lori said.

   The U.S. envoy holding discussions with
mid-level Palestine Liberation Organization officials has not met
PLO chief Yasser Arafat, a State Department official said Monday.
   Radio Israel's report that Robert Pelletreau, the U.S. ambassador
to Tunis, has twice met Arafat is ``categorically denied,'' the
official said. He declined, however, to be quoted by name.
   The Radio Israel broadcast quoted a Kuwait newspaper's Monday
report as the source of its information.
   Pelletreau has been holding occasional talks since the end of
1988 with lower-ranking PLO officers after the U.S. government said
Arafat had met its conditions for the discussions by renouncing use
of violence and recognizing Israel's right to exist.

<TEXT>
   Two public hospitals in Missouri will
stop performing abortions because of Monday's Supreme Court ruling,
and the governor set up a task force to consider further
restrictions on abortion.
   ``We in Missouri will press on to protect the lives of our future
generations and literally to protect the future of the state,'' Gov.
John Ashcroft said at a news conference after the court upheld key
portions of Missouri's 1986 abortion law.
   In its ruling, the high court stopped short of overturning its
1973 Roe vs. Wade decision which barred the states from outlawing
abortion. But it restored Missouri regulations that among other
things prevent the use of public facilities for abortions, require
doctors to determine, when possible, whether a fetus at least 20
weeks old is capable of surviving outside the womb, and ban the use
of tax money for ``encouraging or counseling'' women to have
abortions not necessary to save life.
   State health officials said only 90 of the 17,382 abortions
performed in Missouri last year were performed in two public
hospitals, Truman Medical Center in Kansas City and the University
of Missouri Hospital and Clinics in Columbia.
   Dr. James Mongan, executive director of the 360-bed Truman
Medical Center, said the hospital will stop performing abortions,
which in the past have been paid for by the client. Abortions in
Missouri have not been financed with public money since the mid
1970s.
   Mongan said the number of requests for abortions at the hospital
has dropped over the years because the procedure can be done
elsewhere. UMC officials said their physicians will also stop
performing abortions.
   ``This is a tragedy ... that will affect mostly low-income
women,'' said B.J. Isaacson-Jones, executive director of
Reproductive Health Services, the private St. Louis clinic that was
party to the case. ``I am filled with grief, rage and bitter
disappointment.''
   RHS would ``continue to provide all choices to women, regardless
of their ability to pay,'' she said.
   The cost of abortions for low-income women at the private, St.
Louis clinic, is determined on a sliding scale. The standard fee for
first-trimester abortions is $260.
   Judith Widdicombe, founder of the clinic, called the decision an
outrage.
   ``There's a movement in this country that will not tolerate this.
It will become our Vietnam of the 1990s,'' she said.
   ``Their goal is no abortions,'' Widdicombe said. ``Next will come
birth control.''
   A 30-year-old St. Louis woman who had an abortion earlier this
year was at the clinic for the announcement of the decision.
   ``This is going to go on and on,'' said the woman, who asked that
her name not be used. ``And the quiet silent majority is going to
have to speak up. Every organization that's pro-choice is going to
have to fight a thousand times harder. It's like dominoes. If you
give up once, they keep falling down one by one.''
   Ashcroft said he will form a task force to recommend additional
measures ``to protect the health of mothers and protect the lives of
unborn children by reducing the number of abortions.''
   ``I think there's a clear message the pendulum has changed
direction,'' said Lou DeFeo of the Missouri Catholic Conference,
which helped draft Missouri's abortion law. ``The court has
apparently extended the invitation for legislatures across the
country to further protect human life from its beginning. It opens
new doors.''
   Missouri's abortion statute quickly drew a legal attack after it
passed in 1986 and a federal court blocked its implementation even
before it took effect.
   That was what supporters wanted because the law was passed with
the intention of making it a vehicle for challenging Roe vs. Wade.
   The Missouri case drew national attention, and a flood of briefs
for and against abortion poured into the Supreme Court, which heard
arguments on the issue last April.
   The law was the Missouri Legislature's third effort to restrict
abortions since the 1973 decision. Parts of a 1974 law enacted to
get around Roe vs. Wade were overturned by the Supreme Court in
1976. Another law requiring that abortions during the fourth to
sixth months of pregnancy be conducted in hospitals was overturned
in 1983.
   The Legislature voted overwhelmingly to pass the latest law,
which included a provision that ``the life of each human being
begins at conception.'' The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that
provision was constitutional.
   Attorney General William Webster, who argued the case before the
Supreme Court, said the decision ``means substantial prerogative
will be returned to all 50 states.''
   ``It doesn't take us back before Roe, but it does suggest states
will have more power than they have had in the past two decades,''
said Webster, a Republican.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Agrees To Explore Right to Jury Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to use a
race discrimination case from North Carolina to explore the right to
a jury trial by those filing civil lawsuits.
   The court said it will hear, during its next term beginning in
October, an appeal by a machinist who said he was fired because he
is black. A ruling in the case is likely in 1990.
   The machinist, John S. Lytle, had worked for more than two years
at the Household Manufacturing Inc. plant in Arden, N.C. He was
fired after failing to show up for work on Aug. 12, 1983.
   He said he was ill and wanted the day off to see a doctor. Lytle
said he planned to work on Aug. 13 _ a Saturday _ to make up the
time but was prevented from telling his supervisor of his plan
because the supervisor was angry with him over another incident.
   Lytle then filed a complaint with the federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, charging his employer with racial bias in
the firing.
   He also said the company, in retaliation for his EEOC complaint,
refused to provide him with a letter of recommendation to help him
get another job.
   Lytle filed a federal suit under a century-old civil rights law
first used to protect freed slaves.
   That same law was the center of a heated controversy last month
when the Supreme Court reaffirmed the act can be used to charge
private employers with bias. In that same ruling, the justices
limited the law by ruling that the statute cannot be invoked to
charge on-the-job racial harassment
   The case acted on Monday involves a different application of the
law.
   Lytle was denied a jury trial by a federal judge who in 1986
ruled that the 19th Century law did not offer him a remedy. The
judge then examined Lytle's complaint under the Civil Rights Act of
1964 which also forbids on-the-job racial discrimination.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 1987 that the
judge was ``apparently erroneous'' in barring Lytle's complaint
based on the older law.
   But the appeals court refused to reinstate Lytle's suit.
   The appeals court said the suit may not be revived because the
federal judge examined Lytle's complaint under the 1964 statute and
ruled there was insufficient evidence to support his bias claim.
   The appeals court said the handling of the employment
discrimination charge under the 19th Century law and under the 1964
act ``are identical.''
   ``Where the elements of the two causes of action are the same,
the findings by the (trial judge) in one preclude the trial of the
other,'' the appeals court said.
   The case is Lytle vs. Household Manufacturing, 88-334.

<TEXT>
   World leaders recalled Andrei Gromyko's toughness and tenacity
upon word of his death Monday, but former President Richard M. Nixon
summed it all up _ ``Gromyko was above all a survivor in the most
ruthless sytem in the world.''
   Nixon, himself no stranger to crises, noted that as Soviet
foreign minister Gromyko served leaders as different as Josef
Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev, Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and
Konstantin Chernenko.
   ``While I generally knew him as an adversary, I also respected
him as one of the most tenacious and able diplomats of the
post-World War II era,'' Nixon said.
   Gromyko, later Soviet president, died at the age of 79 in the
Soviet Union on Sunday. President Mikahil S. Gorbachev announced the
death Monday in a session of the Supreme Soviet legislature.
   President Bush also noted Gromyko's long service in a statement
expressing his condolences and those of his wife Barbara.
   ``Gromyko's career paralleled the course of U.S.-Soviet relations
for nearly 50 years,'' Bush said. ``Mr. Gromyko knew every U.S.
president from Franklin Roosevelt to Geroge Bush ... Andrei
Gromyko's death marks the passing of a generation that witnessed
many of the most historic events of this century.''
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar messaged Gorbachev
to express ``profound sorrow'' over the death. He described Gromyko
as ``one of the foremost architects'' of world society after World
War II.
   ``The absence of another such global conflict, as well as the
peace and stability enjoyed by his own continent over the past four
decades, owes much to his experience and wisdom,'' the message said.
   Perez de Cuellar arrived in Geneva on Monday for the 1989 session
of the U.N. Economic and Social Council.
   Former British prime ministers Ted Heath, a Conservative, and
Lord Callaghan, a Laborite, harkened back to their experiences with
Gromyko.
   ``He was more notorious, perhaps, for saying `no' than for his
constructive work, but in the negotiations which led to the
successful conclusion of the first Test Ban Treaty in 1963, he
played a positive part. ... For the next 15 years he pursued the
same purpose with the consequent decrease in tension between East
and West,'' said Heath, who was prime minister from 1970-74.
   ``He was a good executor of a bad foreign policy that has now
changed,'' said Callaghan, who, as James Callaghan, was foreign
secretary in a Labor government from 1974-76 and prime minister from
1976-79.
   Callaghan called Gromyko ``a very hard man to negotiate with. .
.. He represented Soviet foreign policy at a time when it was
expansionist and dogmatic. Toward the end of his period, especially
as president, he softened and I was astonished when he described me
as a good friend.''
   Spanish Foreign minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez sent a
message expressing condolences to his Soviet counterpart Eduard
Shevarndnadze.
   Abba Eban, Israel's foreign minister in 1966-1974, said on Israel
radio that Gromyko ``no doubt, was the high priest of diplomacy. He
was no prophet or reformist, and he owed his remarkable survival to
his ability to adjust to many successful leaders.''
   Recalling the days leading to the November 1947 U.N. decision on
the partition of Palestine, Eban said:
   ``The image of Gromyko is engraved in the memory as a positive
one.
   ``The surprising day was in April when Gromyko rose up at the
preparatory U.N. meeting ... and announced that there are two
possibilites. One is a federal state with Jewish and Arab cantons.
And if there is no agreement on it, we should not rule out the
possibility of dividing the land into two states, a Jewish one and
an Arab one. It changed all the prognoses and for the first time we
saw a real chance for success.
   ``This was a pleasant surprise because none of us could predict
this development. The assumption was that the Stalinist regime was
anti-Zionist and anti-Jewish in principle.''
   But Eban noted that ``the main strategic task of the Soviet Union
was to drive out the West that was then represented by Great
Britain.''
   And Eban also recollected about Gromyko:
   `He had that sorrowful expression, it was so characteristic of
him.
   ``I had said once that he smiled like a blue lamp in a
refrigerator.''

<HEAD>Security Council Postpones Meeting on Israeli-Occupied Territories</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Security Council on Monday postponed a
scheduled meeting on the Israeli-occupied territories, and diplomats
said the United States sought to water down criticism of Israel's
latest deportations.
   The meeting was rescheduled for Wednesday at 11 a.m.
   European diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
delay was caused by a U.S. bid to tone down language in a resolution
on Israel's expulsion of eight Palestinians from ``deplore'' to
``regret.''
   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering,
would not comment on language used in the draft resolution and said
only, ``We will continue to hold discussions.''
   Other diplomatic sources suggested the United States wanted to
hold off on the resolution until after Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc meets to consider Shamir's
peace plan. Shamir has proposed elections in the occupied
territories to choose Arab representatives to negotiate limited
autonomy with Israel.
   Last week Israel deported eight Palestinians from the Gaza Strip
and West Bank to neighboring Lebanon, saying they were leaders of
the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule.
   The United States, as one of five permanent members of the
Security Council, could veto any measure critical of its Israeli
ally. Last year the United States supported one resolution calling
on Israel not to expel Palestinians and it abstained from another
measure of condemnation.
   Israel has deported 55 Palestinians from the occupied territories
since the Palestinian uprising began 19 months ago. At least 538
Palestinians and 23 Israelis have been killed in the so-called
intefadeh for independence from Israel.
   The proposed resolution, sponsored by Syria and the Arab League,
deplores the deportations by Israel. It calls upon Israel to ensure
immediate return to the territories of deported Palestinians and to
stop deporting Arab civilians.
   It cites the Geneva Convention of 1949, which covers treatment of
civilians in time of war and prohibits their explusions.
   The council members are Algeria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia,
Ethiopia, Finland, Nepal, Malaysia, Senegal, Yugoslavia and the five
permanent members, the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain,
China and France.

   A sharply divided Supreme Court on Monday
strictly limited Christmas nativity scenes and other religious
displays on government property, banning them if they convey an
endorsement of religion.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said a Christmas nativity scene
standing alone inside the Allegheny County Courthouse in Pittsburgh
violated the constitutionally required separation of church and
state.
   But by a separate 6-3 vote, the court allowed a Hanukkah menorah
one city block away on the front steps of Pittsburgh's City-County
Building.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun said the menorah, a nine-branched
candelabra used during the Jewish holiday Hanukkah, was part of a
display ``conveying the city's secular recognition of different
traditions for celebrating the winter holiday season.''
   The menorah was surrounded by a much taller Christmas tree and a
sign saluting freedom, Blackmun noted.
   By contrast, he said, the nativity scene or creche _ carrying
signs hailing Jesus as the son of God _ gave the impression the
county was endorsing Christian principles.
   ``Government may celebrate Christmas in some manner and form, but
not in a way that endorses Christian doctrine,'' he said. ``Here,
Allegheny County has transgressed this line.''
   The important church-state ruling came on the final day of the
court term, but was overshadowed by a long-awaited decision in which
the court expanded state power to regulate abortions.
   The court stopped short of reversing its 1973 decision legalizing
abortion, but agreed to hear three other abortion cases _ from
Minnesota, Illinois and Ohio _ when the justices take the bench
again in October.
   In other actions, the court:
   _Accepted its first-ever ``right to die'' case and agreed to
decide whether a Missouri family may order removal of a life-support
system from a woman in an irreversible vegetative condition.
   _Agreed to review a 1984 federal law requiring that student
religious groups be given the same access as other extra-curricular
clubs to public high school facilities. The justices will decide
whether a Bible study group must be allowed to meet at an Omaha,
Neb., high school after class hours.
   In the religion case, the court reaffirmed a test it has used
since 1971 to determine when the wall between church and state is
breached.
   Blackmun was joined in striking down the nativity scene by
Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, John Paul Stevens
and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, participating in his first
church-state case since joining the court in 1988, voted to permit
the nativity scene. He was joined in that dissent by Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia.
   Voting to strike down the menorah display were Brennan, Marshall
and Stevens.
   ``Thank God for the Supreme Court,'' said Charles Saul, a
Pittsburgh attorney representing a Jewish group that owned the
menorah. ``The court is saying that when you put a menorah and a
Christmas tree and these kinds of things together, that all faiths
are welcome.''
   But other Jewish groups were less enthusiastic.
   Sholom D. Comay, President of the American Jewish Committee, said
``we believe that the court erred'' in permitting the menorah
display. ``There is simply no religious need for the display of
sacred symbols of any faith in or at government buildings.''
   Blackmun said the creche violates the Constitution because
``nothing in the context of the display detracts from the creche's
religious message.''
   That message, Blackmun said, is spelled out unmistakably in the
display.
   ```Glory to God in the Highest!' says the angel in the creche _
glory to God because of the birth of Jesus,''' he said. ``This
praise to God in Christian terms is indisputably religious _ indeed
sectarian.''
   Kennedy said the court, in barring goverment sponsorship of the
creche, showed ``an unjustified hostility toward religion, a
hostility inconsistent with our history and our precedents.''
   Monday's ruling relied heavily on a 1984 decision in which the
court upheld the constitutionality of a city-sponosred creche in
Pawtucket, R.I. That display included various secular symbols,
including Santa Claus and his reindeer.
   Lower courts across the nation have been confused about just
where the 1984 ruling drew the line between permissible governmental
acknowledgment of religious heritages and the unconstitutional
promotion or advancement of religion.
   Most lower courts have treated the 1984 decision as a narrow one,
and have disallowed various displays deemed too religious.
   Blackmun acknowledged Monday that the 1984 ruling is ``none too
clear.'' But he said the new ruling may help dispel the confusion.
   He said these are the guiding principles: ``The government's use
of religious symbolism is unconstitutional if it has the effect of
endorsing religious beliefs, and the effect of the government's use
of religious symoblism depends upon its context.''
   The Pittsburgh creche was displayed in the county courthouse from
1981 to 1987 for about six weeks during the Christmas season.
   The 18-foot menorah was displayed each year from 1982 to 1987 on
the front steps of the building that houses city and county offices.
It stood next to a 45-foot Christmas tree.
   The American Civil Liberties Union and others went to court
seeking removal of both.

   The court Monday also split 5-4 in ruling:
   _States may ban any public employee _ doctor, nurse or other
health care provider _ from performing or assisting most abortions.
   _States may ban the use of any public hospital or other facility
for performing most abortions.
   _A declaration in Missouri's law that the ``life of each human
being begins at conception'' and that ``unborn children have
protectable interests in life, health and well-being'' wrongly was
struck down by the appeals court because it has no legal impact.
   On each point, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, Scalia and
Justices Byron R. White, Anthony M. Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor
joined to form a majority.
   There was no one opinion speaking for the five, however.
Rehnquist wrote the court's main opinion, but only White and Kennedy
joined his reasoning on each point.
   The court also ruled that a dispute over one Missouri provision,
prohibiting the use of tax money for ``encouraging or counseling''
women to have abortions not necessary to save their lives, had
become moot.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall joined
Blackmun's strongly worded dissent to the overall opinion.
   In all, the decision yielded five opinions totaling 78 pages. The
authors were Rehnquist, Scalia, O'Connor, Blackmun and Stevens.
   The justices also ensured that abortion will dominate the court's
1989-90 term, which begins in October, by agreeing to review three
abortion disputes from Illinois, Ohio and Minnesota.
   In each, Roe vs. Wade is under attack.
   ``I fear for the future,'' said Blackmun. ``I fear for the
liberty and equality of the millions of women who have lived and
come of age in the 16 years since Roe was decided.''
   He added, ``For today, the women of this nation still retain the
liberty to control their destinies. But the signs are evident and
very ominous, and a chill wind blows.''
   Rehnquist cited high court abortion rulings since 1973 in
upholding the bans on using public money, public hospitals and
public employees for abortions.
   ``The Constitution does not forbid a state or city ... from
expressing a preference for normal childbirth,'' the chief justice
wrote.
   In upholding the Missouri provision requiring fetal testing,
Rehnquist, White and Kennedy criticized the trimester-by-trimester
approach of Roe vs. Wade.
   ``We do not see why the state's interest in protecting potential
human life should come into existence only at the point of
viability, and that there should therefore be a rigid line allowing
state regulation after viability but prohibiting it before
viability,'' Rehnquist said.
   Scalia provided a fourth vote to junk the trimester approach, but
O'Connor _ who has criticized that approach in previous abortion
rulings _ refused to go along.
   Although she voted to uphold the Missouri fetal-testing
requirement, O'Connor said, ``There will be time enough to
re-examine Roe. And to do so carefully.''
   As had been suspected even before Monday's ruling, O'Connor
clearly will be the key vote in any future abortion ruling.
   While Missouri officials were preparing their appeal to the
nation's highest court, former Reagan administration lawyer William
Bradford Reynolds suggested that the state's appeal include a call
for the overturning of Roe vs. Wade.
   In a brief filed two days after the presidential election last
Nov. 8, the Reagan administration supported Missouri's appeal.
   The Bush administration also backed Missouri's efforts to restore
its abortion regulations.
   In an attempt to sway the justices, Americans in record numbers
wrote and telephoned the court to express their views. Before the
April arguments, the court was receiving tens of thousands of
letters each day, and the court's two switchboards were so flooded
with calls that a rarely used third board had to be activated.
   Scalia referred to the public pressure, stating, ``We can now
look forward to at least another term with carts full of mail from
the public, and streets full of demonstrators.''
   In a more formal form of lobbying, the court also received a
record number of ``friend-of-the-court'' briefs _ unsolicited advice
from individuals and organizations not part of the Missouri
litigation.
   In all, 78 such briefs were filed.

<HEAD>Mounting Cries of Fraud in Five Mexican State Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WRIGHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICALI, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders from left and right
accused Mexico's long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party on
Monday of committing fraud in state elections that officials
promised would be clean.
   The charges came after the party, known as PRI in Spanish,
claimed victories in four of the five states that held elections for
new legislatures and mayors Sunday.
   In Baja California, which also chose a new governor, Margarita
Ortega, 38, of the PRI and Ernesto Ruffo, 37, of the conservative
National Action Party both claimed victory.
   Parties in this border state were basing claims on their own
counts and projections. By law, election boards have until July 9 to
announce official returns.
   If he wins, Ruffo, a former mayor of Ensenada, will become the
first opposition governor in Mexico since the PRI was founded and
took power 60 years ago.
   National Action leaders in Baja California and leaders of the
leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, running a tight race for the
state legislature in Michoacan, complained of balloting irregularies.
   ``The PRI has taken the decision to impose itself at whatever
cost,'' Cuauhtemoc Cardenas told a news conference Monday.
   Cardenas is the Democratic Revolutionary leader and a native son
of Michoacan.
   PRI-dominated electoral commissions in Baja California and
Chihuahua said irregularities existed, but denied they were
important or affected the results. In Michoacan, the PRI accused the
leftist opposition of irregularities.
   The opposition complained that ballot boxes were stolen, voter
credentials were burned, and voter registration rolls were tampered
with so many people could not cast ballots when they showed up at
polling stations.
   Congressman Norberto Corrella said he and other National Action
workers spent the night recovering ballot boxes stolen by PRI
workers. Corella said PRI workers stuffed the boxes and planned to
turn them over to the election commission in Mexicali, the state
capital.
   ``We recovered 17 ballot boxes,'' Corrella said, and complained
that tampered boxes ``all of a sudden'' showed the PRI winning
10-to-1. He said he filed complaints with the election commission
and the district attorney's office.
   Similarly, the Citizens' Action Committee of Human Development
reported 266 irregularities that included multiple voting, people
casting ballots without registration cards and harassment of
opposition poll watchers at the state's 1,166 polling places.
   The PRI said it also won a majority of the state legislature's 19
seats, but gave no figures.
   In Michoacan, the PRI said it won in 10 districts and led in
others and would get a majority of the 24 seats in the state
legislature.
   Opposition leaders and many reporters who watched the polls said
voter registration rolls were altered, other documents were tampered
with and many people were kept from voting.
   In elections for mayors in Chihuahua, where PRI said it was
ahead, National Action leaders complained that many PRI sympathizers
voted several times and that indelible ink to mark voters' fingers
to prevent fraud either was removed or was not indelible.
   The PRI claimed victories in its strongholds of Campeche and
Zacatecas, also electing state legislatures.
   Reports of turnouts ranged from 30 to 65 percent, depending on
which party was doing the reporting. Official figures were not
available.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has been promising clean
elections since he took office Dec. 1. But National Action spokesman
Jesus Hernandez in Ciudad Juarez called this ``just words.''
   ``These elections were dirty,'' he told reporters Sunday night.
   Baja California and Michoacan held center stage Sunday because
voters in both states gave Salinas one-third or less of their votes
in July 1988 presidential elections.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms with locally heavy rain were scattered
across much of the southeastern quarter of the nation Monday, and
extended northward into the Ohio Valley.
   Thunderstorms brought heavy rain to western sections of the
Carolinas and the central Gulf Coast.
   Some streets and small streams flooded in the Columbus, Ga.,
area, where 3.42 inches of rain fell in the six hours up to 2 p.m.
EDT, the National Weather Service said. Heavy rain also fell around
the Atlanta area, which got 1.37 inches in the same period.
   During the same six hours, 3.21 inches fell at Clemson, S.C., and
Montgomery, Ala., got 1.22 inches.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from Florida to the
Middle Atlantic States.
   Thunderstorms associated with a weak cold front were scattered
over upper Michigan and northern Wisconsin.
   Elsewhere, a few showers were scattered along the coast of the
Pacific Northwest, and there were a few thunderstorms along the
eastern slopes of the Colorado Rockies.
   Temperatures in the lower deserts of Arizona and California were
well over 100 degrees by noon. Record heat is possible during the
next couple of days over sections of Colorado, Utah and Arizona
because of an upper-level high-pressure system. Readings in Phoenix
could reach near 115 degrees, the weather service said.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 58
degrees at Quillayute, Wash., to 109 at Phoenix and Palm Springs,
Calif. Monday's low in the Lower 48 states was 28 at Truckee, Calif.
   The forecast for Tuesday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Ohio, Tennessee and lower
Mississippi valleys and the eastern and southern sections of Texas,
and a few showers in the Pacific Northwest.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted along the California coast; in
the 60s and 70s in the Pacific Northwest; in the 80s in the Rockies,
and from the Mississippi Valley to the East Coast; in the 90s in
Florida; in the 90s to almost 100 degrees in the great Plains, the
Intermountain region between the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada, and
interior valleys of California; and between 100 and 115 degrees in
the desert Southwest.

<HEAD>Investigator Concluded Seven Years Ago Peachtree 25th Was `Fire Trap'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fire investigator concluded seven years ago that
a 10-story office building which burned last week, killing five
people, was a ``firetrap,'' officials confirmed Monday.
   A woman who had been in critical condition since the fire died
Monday at Piedmont Hospital, said Sgt. Steve Martin of the Fulton
County Medical Examiner's Office.
   Fire officials said their investigation continues to point to an
electrical worker who apparently triggered an explosion while
changing a fuse.
   An inspector from the Atlanta Bureau of Fire examined the
Peachtree 25th building in July 1982, and concluded a disaster was
possible if fire broke out in the sprinklerless building, Acting
Fire Chief Tom Perrin said Monday.
   ``When he conducted his investigation some years back, he felt
like it was a firetrap,'' Perrin said. He added that at the time the
investigator, now a lieutenant with the fire department, did
``stipulate some things that needed to be done.''
   Perrin said the lieutenant reminded him of the 1982 inspection on
Friday, hours after the fatal fire at the midtown building.
Officials want more information from the lieutenant but he has since
left on vacation and will not be back for a few days, the chief said.
   The building apparently underwent some renovations in July 1982,
around the time of the lieutenant's inspection, but the
investigative file is inconclusive as to whether the renovations
would have placed the building under any additional code
requirements, said Deputy Chief A.D. Bell.
   ``We're still looking at how much renovation was conducted at
that time, and that would determine what type of codes would have to
be abided by,'' Bell said. ``Once we can determine that ... we can
ascertain what should or should not have been done.''
   American Management Co. of Torrance, Calif., which manages the
Peachtree 25th building, referred reporters to a representative of
its Atlanta office, Ken Poole, who did not return a reporter's call.
   Perrin said investigators were ``getting close'' to knowing
exactly what happened Friday, and believe the electrical repairman
was involved when he tried to change a fuse following a power outage.
   ``On that floor, where he had inserted the 200-amp fuse, we feel
... when he inserted that fuse, with the current still on, that's
what caused the explosion, and that's what caused the fire,'' Perrin
said.
   Perrin said errors on someone's part apparently contributed to
the fire, but declined to elaborate.
   The investigation could be finished this week, he said.
   Perrin said firefighters responding to the fire turned in a
textbook performance in saving people, but might have been able to
work faster if they'd had more help. Bureau officials estimate that
Atlanta's fire department, with about 1,070 employees, is about 105
short of its minimum needs.
   ``We're really strained,'' Perrin said. ``We don't have the
manpower we need for a major city. ... It's time to quit playing
games.''
   Bureau of Fire officials have been asking for more manpower for
about seven years, but have been thwarted by budget considerations,
officials said Monday.
   Several of the more than 30 people injured remained hospitalized
Monday.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Rebels Attack Army Post, Try Ambush Chief Justice</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas attacked a
military guard post in the capital early Monday after they tried and
failed to ambush a car carrying the nation's chief justice.
   Three people were reported killed and three wounded in the two
attacks.
   An army news release said rebels opened fire with automatic
weapons and rocket-propelled grenades on the military post guarding
a San Salvador residential suburb southwest of the capital where
many army officers live.
   Witnesses said the grenade explosions and rattle of gunfire at
dawn sent many residents in the Arce neighborhood tumbling out of
their beds. They said several officers rushed out of their homes in
pajamas or shorts, assault rifles in hand, and helped repel the
attack.
   The army said no military men were hurt, and the dead body of a
guerrilla, seen lying across the street from the guard post,
appeared to be the only casualty of the 30-minute gun battle.
   In a broadcast over their clandestine Radio Venceremos, the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front rebels said the attack was
part of a renewed action ``against the officers who command the
Salvadoran war.''
   At estimated 75,000 people have been killed since the rebels
started fighting for power in October 1979.
   On Sunday, Supreme Court Chief Justice Mauricio Gutierrez Castro
said another group of rebels tried but failed to ambush him and his
family as they drove back from a day at a beach near the port of La
Libertad.
   Gutierrez told a television news show Monday morning he was
grazed by a bullet in the neck, but that one of several bodyguards
riding in a second car behind the family was killed and another was
wounded.
   Authorities said a woman driving a car on the same road also was
killed and a male companion was wounded during the attempted ambush
about 10 miles south of the capital.
   Gutierrez said his bodyguards opened fire when they saw the
rebels had blocked the road with a parked bus, and the guerrillas
returned the fire. He said his driver made a quick U-turn and sped
away from the fighting.
   ``I don't think it was an attack on me personally, as they had no
way of knowing I would be traveling on that road,'' Gutierrez said.
   President Alfredo Cristiani named Gutierrez, a conservative,
chief justice last week. Cristiani was sworn in June 1 after being
elected on the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance ticket.
   Gunmen in June killed Antonio Rodriguez Porth, Cristiani's chief
of staff, and several others were slain later in similar attacks.
The government has blamed the guerrillas for the assassinations, but
the rebels have denied responsibility.

   The Supreme Court said Monday it will take up
three more abortion cases next term, providing ample opportunity for
further adjustments in the law.
   The cases, from Illinois, Ohio and Minnesota, will be heard by
the court after the 1989-90 term begins early in October.
   Monday's decision freed states to impose restrictions on a
woman's right to abortion, but stopped short of reversing the
court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   ``I think it's going to go down,'' Randall Terry, president of
the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, said of the 1973
precedent. Anti-abortion groups hope he's right.
   Solicitor General Kenneth Starr said it was too soon to determine
whether the Bush administration would seek to intevene in next
fall's cases. The administration supported Missouri in defense of
the state regulations largely upheld Monday.
   The Illinois case clearly poses the largest direct threat to Roe
vs. Wade, the 16-year-old ruling. It would be extremely difficult
for the court to revive the Illinois laws in question without
substantially dismantling its 1973 decision.
   The Illinois cse stems from that state's attempt to enforce
extensive regulations on abortion clinics.
   Lower courts said three Illinois laws, when applied to abortion
clinics, impermissibly interfered with women's abortion rights.
   A federal trial judge and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
said the regulations imposed by the Illinois laws would have forced
abortion clinics to become ``the functional equivalent of small
hospitals'' for no valid purpose.
   The three laws _ the Medical Practice Act, the Ambulatory
Surgical Treatment Center Act and the Health Facilities Providers
Act _ generally apply to all medical centers where outpatient
surgery is performed.
   The regulations covered staffing and equipment requirements and
even the size of the facility.
   One regulation required patient counseling that included a
discussion of alternatives, description of the procedure to be
performed and an explanation of risks and possible complications.
   The Ohio abortion law generally required doctors to notify a
parent of young, unmarried girls before performing abortions.
   Lower courts said the law impermissibly interfered with some
girls' constitutional right to seek an abortion.
   Passed by the state's Legislature in 1985, the Ohio law never
took effect due to a successful legal challenge by an Akron abortion
clinic and one of its doctors.
   The law would have required any doctor asked to perform an
abortion on an unmarried girl under 18 to contact one of the girl's
parents at least 24 hours before the operation.
   Doctors could satisfy the law's notification requirement by
telling the girl's brother or sister, if over 21, or a designated
stepparent or grandparent.
   Young girls could seek to bypass parental notification by seeking
the permission of a state judge to have an abortion.
   Among other flaws found by the lower courts was the fact that
Ohio had ``made no showing that (its interest in protecting immature
minors) is advanced by requiring the attending physician, as opposed
to another qualified, responsible person'' to do the notifying.
   The Minnesota law at issue requires some girls to tell both
parents at least 48 hours before having an abortion. It was upheld
by a federal appeals court.
   The Minnesota Legislature passed a law in 1981 requiring
unmarried girls under 18 and still living with a parent to provide
written notice to both parents, if possible, before obtaining an
abortion.
   The law also imposed a 48-hour waiting period, and made doctors
who perform abortions criminally liable for violations.
   After a judge blocked enforcement of the law, a judicial bypass
option took effect. It allowed girls to avoid notifying their
parents by convincing a judge they were ``mature and capable of
giving informed consent'' or that an abortion without notice to both
parents would serve the girl's ``best interest.''
   The notification law, with the judicial bypass option, was in
effect in Minnesota for five years before a federal judge ruled that
it was unconstitutional.
   The law had been challenged in behalf of minors, a parent, four
abortion clinics and two doctors.
   A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld that ruling, but the entire appeals court last Aug. 8 upheld
the law by a 7-3 vote.
   The 8th Circuit court postponed the effect of its ruling so
opponents of the law could seek Supreme Court review.
   The high court previously has upheld a state's parental
notification law, but it never before has handled a case involving
such a law that had been in effect.

<HEAD>U.S. to Open Budapest Studios in Budapest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty said Monday
they will open a full-time news bureau and transmission studios
later this summer in Budapest, Hungary, the first in a Soviet-bloc
country for the U.S.-financed broadcast systems.
   Hungary announced in March that Radio Free Europe would be
allowed to accredit a reporter to work in Hungary without any
restrictions.
   The new Budapest bureau ``will provide an invaluable window for
our newspeople and analysts covering events in Eastern Europe,''
said Gene Pell, president of Raqdio Free Europe and Radio Liberty,
which broadcasts to Soviet-bloc countries from Munich, West Germany.
   ``We welcome this development as a sign of the Hungarian
government's growing acceptance of the free flow of information and
ideas,'' Pell said.
   The announcement said other journalists from Munich headquarters
will make frequent visits to Hungary on reporting assignments, it
added.
   For years Hungary accused Radio Free Europe of meddling in its
internal activities. Accusations were also raised in the United
States and elsewhere that Radio Free Europe broadcasts in 1956
falsely encouraged the Hungarian people to expect U.S. and Western
support of the anti-Soviet uprising quelled by Soviet tanks that
year.
   Radio Free Europe broadcasts to Eastern Europe and Radio Liberty
to the Soviet Union in 23 languages for a total of more than 1,000
hours a week. News of the region unobtainable in official media
forms a heavy proportion of the broadcasts.
   Under its new ``glasnost,'' or openness, policy, the Soviet Union
ended 35 years of jamming Radio Liberty last November. Hungary and
Poland much earlier halted interference while Czechoslovakia and
Bulgaria stopped jamming in December.

   Anti-abortion lawmakers seized the U.S. Supreme Court's abortion
ruling Monday as a blueprint for restrictions in their states, and
advocates on both sides predicted the debate would turn their
legislatures into battlefields.
   ``I would expect warfare,'' said Rep. Arthur M. Read II, a Rhode
Island Republican who is state House minority whip. ``There are two
irreconcilable positions that are very strongly held.''
   ``It's going to be the same old fight, but more intense,'' said
Sen. Ben Vidricksen, a Kansas Republican. ``In fact, it's going to
be a bloody battle in the Legislature.''
   In Michigan, Republican Sen. Jack Welborn said he already has
drafted a law based on the Missouri abortion statute that the
Supreme Court largely upheld. From New York to Alabama to the West,
other legislators had similar plans.
   While the high court left a woman's basic right to abortion
intact, ``We can go a hell of a lot further in restricting
abortions,'' said Rep. Stephen Freind, a Pennsylvania Republican and
a leading abortion foe in his state.
   ``The right-to-life philosophy has been on the defensive since
Roe vs. Wade,'' the 1973 ruling legalizing abortion, said Sen. Tom
Rasmussen, a Montana Republican. ``This gives us greater impetus to
go on the offensive.''
   With most legislatures in recess, few if any laws appeared likely
to change immediately. Florida House Speaker Tom Gustafson, a
Democrat, has suggested a special session in Tallahassee to take up
the issue; Freind, in Pennslyvania, abandoned that idea for fear of
alienating his vacationing colleagues.
   While lawmakers around the country said their legislatures
undoubtedly will consider the issue, many said the outcome is
unclear. Montana's Sen. Rasmussen gave new abortion restrictions
only a 50-50 chance in his state.
   The state attorney general in neighboring Idaho predicted tougher
abortion laws will be enacted there as a result of the ruling.
Lawmakers in Wyoming made the same prediction: ``There does appear
to be a right-to-life majority in the Legislature,'' said Republican
Sen. Charles Scott. ``I suspect there will be a move to do whatever
the Supreme Court will allow.''
   In Iowa, however, ``I doubt that we will be passing any
restrictions,'' said Democratic House Speaker Don Avenson, a
candidate for governor. ``We will be very cautious about even
thinking of restricting women's reproductive rights.''
   The court upheld bans on any public employee performing or
assisting in abortions not neccessary to save the mother's life, and
on the use of any public hospital or other facility in such
abortions.
   It also said the states may ban the use of tax money for
``encouraging or counseling'' women to have abortions not necessary
to save their lives, and may require doctors to determine, when
possible, whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old can live outside the
womb.
   Sarah Weddington, a Texas attorney who successfully argued the
Roe vs. Wade case in 1973, noted that the decision will have no
practical implication until state legislatures pass new laws.
   In terms of abortion's legal status in each state, ``tomorrow
it's going to be the same as today,'' she said. ``But what we are
going to see is a tremendous surge of legislative activity in all of
the state legislatures.''
   One piece of legislation outlined by an Ohio legislator Monday
took the opposite tack from the abortion restrictions proposed
elsewhere. Rep. Joan Lawrence, a Republican, said she would
introduce a law assuring women the right to an abortion before their
25th week of pregnancy.
   ``The government has no business getting into the business of
deciding whether a woman should termiate a pregnancy,'' she said.
``But if they want us to regulate, this is the regulation.''
   In some states, new restrictions face even more powerful
opponents: Maine Gov. John R. McKernan Jr. decried the ruling as a
setback for abortion rights and said he would fight any effort to
adopt restrictions in his state.
   Gov. Steve Cowper of Alaska said changes were unlikely given
Alaskans' ``highly developed sense of privacy.'' And Maryland Senate
President Thomas V. Miller saw little chance for tougher abortion
laws there: Given the makeup of the Legislature, ``Any attempt to
change the law in Maryland will be an exercise in futility,'' he
said.
   While lawmakers in many states are expected to consider local
versions of the Missouri law, activists said some may be presented
with far more sweeping restrictions intended as further challenges
to legal abortion.
   ``Not only will Alabama introduce bills that will bring Alabama
into a more conservative mode with regards to abortion _ I believe
you'll see every state in America introducing legislation like
this,'' said Republican Rep. Greg Beers of Birmingham. ``I believe
the next 12 months will be a very tumultuous time in state
legislatures.''

<HEAD>Coffee Quotas Suspended</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBIN STAINER</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Coffee Organization Monday
suspended all export limits, foreshadowing a drop in coffee prices
worldwide.
   The 74-nation organization approved a two-year extension of the
current agreement, minus the quotas. Limits were suspended as of
midnight Monday.
   Members earlier rejected two proposals for a new agreement to
succeed the 6-year-old pact that expires Sept. 30. Both failed
proposals would have retained quotas to stabilize coffee prices.
   ``It's a free market, and all the surplus will now be available
for consumers,'' said Nestor Osorio, who headed Colombia's
delegation to the one-day emergency meeting. He indicated that South
American and Central American coffee producers are sitting on large
stockpiles.
   The United States _ the most powerful consumer nation _ and
11-nation Group of Mild Arabica Producers took a hard line against
quotas. The United States wanted lower consumer prices, and the
Central American nations wanted a larger market share.
   The United States was ``very determined not to have an
agreement,'' Osorio said.
   The International Coffee Organization, established in 1963, tries
to stabilize coffee prices by limiting sales of green coffee beans
by the producers to the consumers. The organization suspended quotas
twice before, first for 19 months in 1986-87 and then for six years
in the 1970s.
   The limits keep surplus coffee from world markets and maintain
the average world price above the target minimum of $1.20 per pound.
   The lifting of quotas could cost coffee producers, who currently
earn about $10 billion annually, up to $2 billion in lost revenues,
said West German negotiator Hugo Roerig. Coffee is a main
export-earner for dozens of countries, and in Uganda and other
African nations it accounts for up to 90 percent of sales abroad.
   The market fell dramatically before the coffee organization
announced its decision, and traders said it would likely collapse
further when trading opens Tuesday. Nearly 10 percent was knocked
off the price of coffee on the London market.
   The organization failed to agree on two proposals that would have
left the door open to continuing the present price-support regime.
   One proposal would have extended the existing agreement as is,
with no change in quotas. The other called for extension with
changes that would increase the availability of mild arabica coffees
- one of the most popular varieties.
   The suspension of quotas was part of a fall-back package drawn up
last week by the coffee organization's 16-nation executive board in
case an extension was not adopted.
   Delegates said this means a free market until at least September
1991, unless a completely new accord is negotiated and enters into
force before then.

   The sailor who said the Navy tried to
make him a scapegoat in the blast that killed 47 men aboard the
battleship Iowa charged Monday that drug use was widespread on the
ship.
   Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Kendall Truitt also accused the Navy of
having ``a motive of the week'' in its investigation of the
explosion, and he and his wife and their parents complained of
harassment by the Navy and the news media.
   Truitt said drug users aboard the Iowa included sailors who
worked in the 16-inch gun turret where the explosion occurred.
Truitt also worked in the turret.
   ``On the Iowa, a lot of the guys with us had serious drug
problems. t's pretty bad when your guys are dealing with gunpowder
and half of the individuals are doing drugs,'' Truitt said at a news
conference.
   The sailor said his friend, Gunner's Mate Clayton Hartwig, who
was killed in the April 19 explosion, had informed the Naval
Investigative Services of drug use by other seamen while stationed
at the Navy's base at Guantanamo, Cuba. Truitt said he had talked to
an officer aboard the Iowa about the problem.
   He said the two men were among the few in the turret who did not
use drugs.
   A Navy spokeswoman with the Atlantic Fleet public affairs office
in Norfolk, Va., said she could not comment on the drug-use
allegations or any of the statements made by Truitt of his family.
   ``It's a Navy policy not to comment until an investigation is
completed,'' Chief Petty Officer Glenna Houston said.
   Also at the news conference, Truitt's attorney, Ellis Rubin,
again demanded that the Navy formally apologize for smearing
Truitt's name by leaking false allegations that he was under
investigation in connection with the Iowa blast.
   Rubin said last week that two NIS agents had apologized to Truitt
and he demanded the Navy officially clear Truitt and tell the public
he was not homosexual and was not involved in a murder-suicide pact
that resulted in the explosion.
   Published reports earlier said that the Navy was investigating
the relationship between Truitt and Hartwig and the possibility of a
suicide or murder pact between the two sailors. Truitt was the sole
beneficiary on Hartwig's double-indemnity life insurance policy.
   The attorney also said he was considering legal action against
the news media which published and broadcast the leaked information.
   ``There are so many things in this investigation that are untrue
that it is ridiculous,'' Truitt said, adding that most of the leaks
had been debunked.
   Truitt was accompanied by his wife, Carole; his mother, Charlotte
Truitt; and his wife's parents, Ray and Micki Smith.
   Truitt's wife said Navy investigators last week extensively
questioned her about her sex life, including whether of not she had
ever been involved in a menage a trois or whether she had sex with
Hartwig.
   She said she wanted an apology from President Bush.
   Truitt was reassigned to the Mayport Naval Station in June.

<TEXT>
   A federal court on Monday ordered
the Defense Ministry to explain why a former junta member sentenced
to life in prison for human rights abuses was seen walking in the
city last week.
   Defense Minister Horacio Jaunarena said Sunday that former navy
chief Emilio Massera, 63, was given permission to leave Magdalena
military prison to be treated for a liver ailment at the naval
hospital in the capital, 60 miles away.
   But a photographer spotted Massera on Friday outside a building
about 60 blocks from the hospital. The newspaper Nuevo Sur published
the pictures on page one Saturday.
   Massera, a member of the junta that ousted President Isabel Peron
in March 1976, was convicted in December 1985 of human rights abuses
under the military dictatorship.
   Security forces arrested at least 8,960 purported leftists who
then vanished and are presumed to have been killed.
   A civilian government ended military rule in December 1983.
   The Massera incident caused an outcry.
   Attorney Eduardo Barcesat, a member of the Argentine League for
the Rights of Man, called it ``an affront to civilian rule and shows
the military is mocking justice.''
   Hernan Patino Mayer, a military adviser to President-elect Carlos
Menem, said, ``I knew the outgoing government had lost control of
the situation, but I didn't think it had gone so far.'' Menem,
elected on May 14, is to take office on Saturday, succeeding
President Raul Alfonsin.
   Justice Minister-designate Julio Oyhanarte said, ``If it is
confirmed that Massera was released from prison (on his own
recognizance), that would be really scandalous.''
   Civilian courts sentenced Massera and six other officers for
human rights offenses before Alfonsin, sensing military unrest,
pushed through Congress a partial amnesty that sheltered about 1,100
others from prosecution.
   The army staged insurrections in April 1987 and January and
December 1988 to force trials to end. Three admirals and 15 generals
still face prosecution.
   Menem says he will act quickly on the issue, but gives no
specifics. He and his aides indicated he favors calling off the
trials and possibly pardoning officers already convicted.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court decision Monday reinstating
key provisions of a Missouri abortion law yielded five separate
opinions _ 78 pages in all.
   The five basic votes in the majority came from Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, Byron R. White and Anthony M. Kennedy. The four basic
dissenting votes were cast by Justices Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul
Stevens, Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan.
   Rehnquist, O'Connor, Scalia, Blackmun and Stevens filed written
opinions.
   Here is a breakdown of the significant votes in the case:
   The court ruled unanimously that the Missouri provision banning
the use of tax money for ``encouraging or counseling'' women to have
abortions not necessary to save life has become moot.
   The court voted 5-4 that Missouri, and other states as well, may
ban abortions in public hospitals or by public employees.
   The majority consisted of Rehnquist, O'Connor, Scalia, White and
Kennedy. The minority included Blackmun, Marshall, Brennan and
Stevens.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court upheld the Missouri provision that
doctors may have to determine whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old
is capable of surviving outside the womb, by determining lung
maturity and other testing.
   O'Connor's reasons differed from the other four.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court ruled that part of the Missouri law
declaring that the ``life of each human being begins at conception''
and that ``unborn children have protectable interests in life,
health and well-being'' is not a live controversy because the
declaration has no legal impact. Stevens, Blackmun, Marshall and
Brennan dissented.
   Four justices _ Rehnquist, White, Kennedy and Scalia _ voiced
support for scrapping the trimester-by-trimester approach in Roe vs.
Wade. Only Scalia called for the outright reversal of Roe vs. Wade.

   Jim Backus, the muttering voice of the
nearsighted cartoon character ``Mr. Magoo'' and the self-indulgent
millionaire of ``Gilligan's Island,'' died Monday of pneumonia. He
was 76.
   The character actor, who played the fabulously wealthy Thurston
Howell III on television's ``Gilligan's Island'' and was featured in
dozens of movies, had suffered from Parkinson's disease for many
years.
   He had been treated for double pneumonia for more than two weeks
at Saint John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica and died
there Monday at 8:45 a.m., said hospital spokeswoman Paulette Weir.
   ``I'm a working man's hypochondriac,'' Backus said in an
interview five years ago. ``I used to do benefits and I'd come home
with whatever symptoms went with the disease I was benefiting.
   ``When they told me I had Parkinson's, I read a magazine article
on it, and overnight I had every symptom known to man. I became an
authority on it.''
   Backus' throaty baritone was known to millions as that of the
bumbling, myopic Mr. Quincy Magoo on the ``Famous Adventures of Mr.
Magoo.'' On the animated series, Magoo played various historical
figures, including Long John Silver, Friar Tuck, William Tell and
Rip Van Winkle.
   He subsequently was introduced to generations of television fans
on ``Gilligan's Island,'' the improbable comedy about a ragtag group
of people shipwrecked on an island with nothing to do but dream up
ridiculous rescue schemes.
   On the series, still popular in syndication, Backus' character
was adapted from his Hubert Updyke, the world's richest man on the
Alan Young radio show of the 1940s. Bob Denver, as Gilligan, and
Alan Hale Jr., as the skipper, joined Backus in the cast of
``Gilligan's Island,'' broadcast by CBS from 1964 to 1967.
   ``I love him,'' Tina Louise, who played the sexy movie star
Ginger Grant on the series, said Monday. ``I was so saddened to lose
him, except I don't feel I've lost him because he's always in my
heart.''
   Miss Louise recalled that at the 70th birthday party for
``Gilligan's Island'' creator-producer Sherwood Schwartz two years
ago, Backus was so ill he had to be carried up the steps.
   ``I asked him to dance and he bet me a million dollars he
wouldn't be able to dance, but he did,'' she said.
   ``He was a unique talent,'' said Schwartz. He said he created the
Thurston Howell character with Backus in mind ``because I don't know
anybody else who could play that character the way Jim did.''
   Backus also played Judge Bradley Stevens on ``I Married Joan,''
an early television situation comedy that ran from 1952 to 1955. He
was seen on ``Playhouse 90'' and ``Studio One'' and made many guest
appearances on television variety and panel shows.
   He was host in 1962 of CBS' ``Talent Scouts,'' which introduced
George Carlin, Charles Nelson Reilly and Louise Lasser to television
audiences.
   A native of Cleveland, Ohio, James Gilmore Backus studied at the
American Academy of Dramatic Arts, graduating in 1933. His acting
career began in stock theater and vaudeville, and he went on to
become a radio announcer in Cleveland, Detroit and New York.
   He appeared on Broadway in ``Paint Your Wagon'' and ``Too Many
Heroes.''
   His motion-picture debut came in 1949 with ``Easy Living,''
starring Victor Mature and Lucille Ball. His movie roles included
James Dean's father in the 1955 classic ``Rebel Without a Cause.''
   Other Backus credits included ``Deadline, U.S.A.,'' ``Half
Angel,'' ``Pat and Mike,'' ``His Kind of Woman,'' ``Bright
Victory,'' ``Above and Beyond,'' ``Androcles and the Lion,'' ``Man
of a Thousand Faces,'' ``Hurry Sundown,'' ``The Wonderful World of
the Brothers Grimm,'' ``It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,'' ``Hello Down
There,'' ``Myra Breckinridge,'' ``Crazy Mama,'' ``Pete's Dragon''
and ``Good Guys Wear Black.''
   Backus was one of the best golfers in the entertainment industry,
and he even made the cut once in the Bing Crosby Pro-Am, playing in
the final round with Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player.
   Backus and Henriette, his wife of many years, produced two humor
books based on his illness, ``Backus Strikes Back'' and ``Forgive Us
Our Digressions.'' He also wrote the books ``Rocks on the Roof'' and
``What Are You Doing After the Orgy?''
   He composed the records ``Delicious'' and ``Cave Man.''
   Backus is survived by his wife. The couple were childless.
   Weir said a memorial service would be announced at a later date.
Funeral arrangements were pending.

<HEAD>Kohl Drops Hope of Visiting Poland This Month; Talks Stalled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany said Monday that
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has dropped any plans to visit Poland this
month, and obstacles persist in talks aimed at binding up wounds
between the two countries.
   The two nations have been negotiating for six months on West
German economic aid in exchange for Polish recognition of its German
minority.
   It is believed the Polish government is not satisfied with the
amount of economic aid _ not disclosed _ that has been offered by
the West Germans. Poland is in an economic crisis.
   A final agreement and a visit by Kohl would be a symbolic boost
toward patching up bad feelings that predate Nazi Germany's 1939
invasion of Poland.
   But chief government spokesman Hans Klein said Kohl no longer is
thinking about going to Poland this month.
   Klein on Monday cited ``questions'' remaining in the negotiations
and a changing political scene in Poland.
   He said a visit this year cannot be excluded, but acknowledged no
definite date has been set for that or for the next round of
negotiations.
   The last round recessed on June 26.
   Klein said a Kohl visit ``should not be put under any pressures
of time.''
   He also said Kohl believes it will be ``in the best interests of
both sides'' to wait and see what changes will result in Poland
because of the changing political scene there.
   The Solidarity trade union has been scoring major political gains
in Poland at the expense of the governing Communist Party.
   Klein told reporters that Bonn solidly supports reforms under way
in Poland.
   ``The chancellor has underlined his great interest in supporting
the Polish reform process,'' Klein said.
   Lack of movement in Polish relations has been a nagging foreign
policy disappointment for Kohl's coalition government. The coalition
has built on earlier agreements with other East European countries
and considerably expanded its political, economic and cultural ties
in the region.
   West German officials want more recognition of ethnic Germans in
Poland, including teaching of German language in schools.
   Polish officials said they agreed to Bonn's conditions, but
disagreement remains on the issue of economic assistance.

<TEXT>
   Space shuttle Columbia, fresh out of
a three-year remodeling job, was rolled closer to the launch pad
Monday for final touches before carrying a secret Pentagon payload
into space.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is hoping for a
July 31 launch, but some space agency officials believe liftoff will
be delayed until early August because flight preparations have taken
longer than expected.
   Columbia last flew Jan. 10, 1986, the last mission before sister
ship Challenger exploded and the shuttle fleet was grounded.
   In another development Monday, investigators confirmed reports
that a bad turbopump bearing caused a shuttle engine to shut down
prematurely and catch fire during a June 23 test at NASA's Stennis
Space Center in Bay St. Louis, Miss.
   The incident is not expected to affect Columbia's launch because
the test involved a developmental engine, not flight hardware, said
Armis L. Worlund, chief investigator for a team of experts at the
Rocketdyne Division of shuttle maker Rockwell International Corp. in
Canoga Park, Calif., which dismantled and inspected the engine last
weekend.
   The turbopump circulates liquid oxygen through the shuttle's fuel
lines before launch, keeping them ready for main engine ignition.
NASA has had trouble with other turbopumps before. One carrying
liquid hydrogen shorted out during a launch countdown last April,
forcing a one-week delay in the flight of shuttle Atlantis.
   At the cape, workers, joined by four of the five astronauts who
will fly Columbia, towed America's oldest orbiter into the huge
assembly building at dawn Monday.
   Columbia, a source of spare parts for sister ships since 1986,
will be hoisted into a nose-up position and mated with its fuel tank
and twin booster rockets. Final preparations for the trip to the
launch pad are expected to take seven to 10 days.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Says Ex-Lab Worker Was Never Warned of Deadly Monkey Virus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former monkey handler at a research lab
sued the company, alleging he was not told that many of the animals
carry a deadly virus until after it killed a co-worker.
   Terrence Young said in a complaint filed in U.S. District Court
on Friday that unsafe working conditions at International Research
and Development Corp. of Mattawan may have exposed him to the herpes
B virus.
   The virus is found in more than 50 percent of rhesus monkeys, a
type of macaque, which are used in many laboratory experiments. The
virus is relatively harmless to the animals but has an estimated 70
percent mortality rate among humans once symptoms appear.
   Herpes B commonly is transmitted through bites and scratches.
Only about 30 cases of human infection have been documented in the
last 57 years.
   Young was employed at the company from April 28 to May 28. He
alleges in the complaint that he often was bitten and scratched
while handling monkeys.
   On one occasion, a monkey bit him so hard that a tooth penetrated
his thumbnail and went completely through his thumb, Young said. He
said he was treated by a staff nurse who told him the wound ``was
nothing to worry about.''
   Young also said protective gear for monkey handlers was
inadequate, including leather gloves with holes in them and a body
suit that was neither bite- nor puncture-proof.
   About a month after he quit, Young was given company forms
detailing the hazards of working with monkeys and the proper
procedure for caring for monkey bites and scratches, the complaint
said.
   Company officials didn't return telephone calls Monday seeking
comment, but have said in the past that every new employee is warned
of the virus before handling the monkeys.
   Young's co-worker Thomas McGeorge, 23, died of the virus June 20,
and another co-worker, who quit after one week at the company, has
been diagnosed with the virus and has been hospitalized since late
June.
   Young said he has been informed he also may have been exposed and
has been given a prescription for an anti-viral drug.
   Other current and former employees of the company also have said
they weren't told about the potential risks associated with handling

   A moderate earthquake struck an
unpopulated region of northern Utah on Monday afternoon, but no
injuries or damage were reported, authorities said.
   The quake measured 4.5 on the Richter scale, and was centered 11
miles west of this town in the Blue Spring Hills, said Jim Pechmann
of the University of Utah Seismology Center.
   A June 21 temblor measuring 3.7 occurred in the same area June
21, Pechmann said.
   Monday's quake was felt in Box Elder and Salt Lake counties,
Pechmann said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, 4 moderate damage and 5 considerable damage.

   Pete Rose's lawsuit against baseball
Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti was moved into federal court
Monday, but it may be sent right back to state court.
   Acting on a motion by baseball's lawyers, U.S. District Judges
Carl B. Rubin and Herman J. Weber said the court was accepting the
case because technical requirements had been met, even though there
was substantial doubt the lawsuit should be in federal court.
   Because Rose is closely indentified with the Cincinnati Reds and
Cincinnati, the judges said the case would be moved to federal court
in Columbus, Ohio, where it was assigned to U.S. District Judge John
D. Holschuh.
   Rose attorney Reuven J. Katz said papers would be filed Wednesday
with Holschuh asking that the case be sent back to state court.
   ``We do not believe there is any merit to'' baseball's motion,
Katz said. Judge Norbert A. Nadel of the Hamilton County Court of
Commons Pleas issued a temporary restraining order June 25 that
prevented Giamatti from holding a hearing on gambling allegations
against the Cincinnati manager. Rose claims that Giamatti has
prejudged the accusations against him.
   The restraining order is good for 14 days and Nadel has scheduled
a hearing for Thursday on Rose's request for a preliminary
injunction that would indefinitely put off Giamatti's hearing.
Nadel's hearing can take place only if the lawsuit is sent back to
state court.
   Baseball appealed the restraining order but a three-judge panel
of the 1st Ohio District Court of Appeals ruled that it had no
authority to hear appeals of temporary orders.
   Louis L. Hoynes Jr., baseball's lead lawyer, said Monday that any
challenge to the commissioner should be decided in federal court.
   ``The commissioner's powers traditionally have been reviwed by
federal court,'' Hoynes said. ``Federal court is a more appropriate
forum.''
   Katz, however, disagreed.
   ``It's not at all unexpected,'' he said. ``It's one of the
alternatives that they had.
   ``The whole thing now is put on hold,'' Katz continued. ``It was
put on hold by their appeal. Now it's put on hold by their attempt
to remove it to federal court.''
   Rubin, the chief judge among the three federal judges in
Cincinnati, is at the center of the dispute. On April 18, Giamatti
sent a letter to Rubin saying that Ronald Peters, one of Rose's
accusors, ``has been candid, forthright and truthful'' with baseball
investigators and ``provided critical sworn testimony about Mr. Rose
and his associates.''
   Rubin, who was to sentence Peters, criticized baseball and said
he believed Giamatti was conducting a vendetta against Rose. Rubin
later removed himself from Peters' case and that of Thomas P.
Gioiosa, another former associate of the Reds' manager.

<TEXT>
   Heavy artillery exchanges broke out
between Syrian and Christian forces in Beirut Monday night after
Syria's militia allies said they will lift a land blockade of the
Christians as a goodwill gesture.
   Police said it was not clear what triggered the barrages hours
after the announcement in Damascus, Syria's capital, that the
15-week-old land blockade of the Christian sector would be lifted at
noon Tuesday.
   Police said shellfire pounded residential districts in Christian
east Beirut and the Western Moslem sector, but they had no immediate
word on casualties.
   In Baghdad, Iraq, President Saddam Hussein told Arab League
envoys Monday peace will not come to Lebanon until all foreign
forces _ including the Syrians _ withdraw, informed official sources
there reported.
   Syrians and Christians engaged in artillery clashes and warring
Shiite Moslem factions in west Beirut had a second day of gunbattles.
   Justice Minister Nabih Berri, leader of the Shiite Amal militia,
said roads into the 310-square-mile Christian enclave would reopen
Tuesday ``to all people,'' including crossings on Beirut's dividing
Green Line and the airport.
   But Berri said, after he and five other Syrian-backed Moslem
militia leaders met Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, that a
blockade of Christian ports would remain to stop arms supplies
getting through.
   The Christian enclave north of Beirut has been besieged since
March 14.
   The airport, in Beirut's Moslem section, has been closed since
fighting began between Syrians and Christians on March 8.
   Monday's move appeared to be a guarded Syrian response to an
offer Sunday by Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival, to stop arms
shipments to the Christians if the Syrians withdraw from Lebanon.
   Iraq's Hussein called for an end to outside interference in
Lebanese affairs when he met Monday with the foreign ministers of
Algeria, Morocco and Saudi Arabia, the official Iraqi News Agency
reported.
   Hussein said he believes all foreign forces in Lebanon should
pull out. Syria has 40,000 troops deployed there. The Israelis also
occupy a border strip in south Lebanon, and Iran has about 2,000
Revolutionary Guards in east Lebanon.
   Iraq supports Lebanon's Christians and moved to aid them after
the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. Syria backed
Iran in that conflict.
   The three Arab ministers are seeking to get Syria and Iraq to
stop supporting their warring Lebanese allies to end the latest
flareup in the country's 14-year-old civil war. The 22-member Arab
League has asked leaders of Algeria, Morocco and Saudi Arabia to
settle Lebanon's crisis by November.
   Berri, spokesman for the six-group Lebanese National Front, said
maintaining the sea blockade ``is still necessary to prevent the
arrival of weapons and means of destruction.''
   That indicated Syrian forces and their allies will continue
shelling the Christian coastline, as they have done each day for
nearly four months.
   ``The situation of the ports will remain unchanged'' until the
Christian leader, Gen. Michel Aoun, lifts his blockade of
militia-run ports, Berri said.
   It was Aoun's blockade in March that set off the current round of
fighting. Police said 396 people have been killed and 1,533 wounded
in the latest violence.
   Berri's announcement was the first significant move toward a
settlement. He said it was ``an overture toward political dialogue''
with the Christians to formulate political reforms aimed at ending
the war.
   Earlier, Syrian troops traded tank and machine-gun fire with
Christian troops across Beirut's Green Line, and Syrian artillery
batteries pounded the Christian coastline north of the capital.
   Christian gunners retaliated by shelling the seaside boulevards
where Syrian guns are located. No casualties were reported.
   Militiamen of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, and
Amal battled wih rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns in west
Beirut. Police had no report of casualties in the fighting, which
shattered an overnight cease-fire called by the Syrians.
   Three people were killed and 11 wounded in street battles Sunday,
the first major clash between the rival factions for months. The
militias are battling for control of Lebanon's 1 million Shiites. It
is the country's largest sect.

<HEAD>Commission to Investigate Link Between Nazis, Right-wing Catholics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LYON, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A commission of historians will investigate
the link between Paul Touvier, one of France's most notorious Nazi
collaborators, and conservative Roman Catholics, the archbishop of
Lyon said Monday.
   The eight-member commission will have unrestricted access to
diocese files and will carry out its work with the ``required
independence,'' said Cardinal Albert Decourtray.
   ``I much prefer the truth, even unpleasant, to a lie, even
pleasant,'' Decourtray said.
   The commission will try to clarify any connection between the
Catholic community and Touvier, the archbishop said.
   Touvier, 74, headed a pro-Nazi French militia in Lyon during the
German occupation in World War II. He was arrested on May 24 at St.
Francis Priory in Nice. The priory is run by followers of Monsignor
Marcel Lefebvre, a fundamentalist priest who was excommunicated by
the Vatican last year.
   Touvier faces trial on charges of crimes against humanity.
   His arrest renewed questions about a possible relationship
between Roman Catholics and Nazi collaborators. There have been
persistent reports in recent years that extreme-right Roman
Catholics were protecting Touvier, who was in hiding for nearly four
decades.
   Named to head the commission was historian Rene Remond, president
of the High Council for Archives. Other members included Jean-Pierre
Azema, a specialist in World War II history from Paris' National
Foundation for Political Sciences.

   A lawyer who did marital counseling with her
police-officer husband chased him in a luxury car for two blocks and
ran over the off-duty lawman, killing him, authorities said.
   City police Sgt. Frank Howard and his wife, Olivia, both
practiced law, doing a lot of work in marital counseling, said
Police Director Claude Coleman.
   ``We knew he was having marital problems. We never knew they were
at that point,'' Coleman said. ``It's ironic that they were both
doing marital work and they were both suffering from marital
problems.''
   Howard, 48, of Orange, was knocked to the ground by a Jaguar XJ6
luxury sedan driven by Mrs. Howard, his wife of about 20 years,
Coleman said.
   Howard, a member of the force since 1967, was pronounced dead at
University Hospital in Newark, said hospital spokeswoman Ann Edgar.
   Howard was a legal analyst for the department and was to be
promoted shortly to lieutenant, police said.
   Mrs. Howard, 48, was being held in the Newark Jail and was to be
arraigned Wednesday on homicide charges, Coleman said.
   The couple had arranged to meet during their lunch hour, police
said. Both were in the car when Howard got out. Witnesses said Mrs.
Howard pursued him for at least two blocks the wrong way down a
one-way street.
   She then knocked him down with the car and ran over him, said
police Lt. McKinley Jackson.
   ``A police officer had tried to stop her and she almost ran him
over,'' Coleman said.
   Howard had a law practice in East Orange and graduated in 1978
from Rutgers Law School. Mrs. Howard shared a practice with her
husband but they had two offices, both in Orange, Coleman said.
   ``We're all very shocked by this turn of events,'' Coleman said.
``Everyone liked Frank. Everyone knew him.''

   A Greek tanker that spilled 420,000 gallons of
heating oil off the Rhode Island coast arrived Monday evening at a
shipyard here for repairs, the Coast Guard said.
   The World Prodigy arrived at New York Shipyard Corp., site of the
old Brooklyn Navy Yard, around 7:30 p.m., said Coast Guard Petty
Officer Kevin Moisan.
   Coast Guard spokesman Jim McGranachan said earlier that
commercial traffic in the harbor was normal but pleasure craft were
out in great number because of the holiday weekend.
   The World Prodigy was escorted from Rhode Island by the Mark
McAllister, a private tugboat with pollution gear aboard. A Coast
Guard port safety officer Lt. Cmdr. Larry Brooks, was aboard for the
trip, but the vessel's captain, Iakovos Georgudis, 43, was at the
helm.
   Aerial inspections on Sunday and early Monday showed no oil
leaking, he said.
   The tanker grounded on Brenton Reef on June 23, spilling a
portion of its 8 million-gallon cargo. Georgudis, who faces federal
pollution charges, has said it was a mistake to have entered
Narragansett Bay without a harbor pilot on board.

<HEAD>Hearing on Dotson Retrial Continued Until July 24</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gary Dotson has no right to a retrial on his 1979
rape conviction because he waited too long to request it,
prosecutors contended Monday at a hearing on his bid for another day
in court.
   However, Dotson's lawyer argued that the technology he says will
exonerate his client has only been available for a few years.
   Dotson was convicted of raping Cathleen Crowell Webb and
sentenced to a 25- to 50-year prison term.
   But in 1985, Ms. Webb recanted her testimony against him in a
case that drew nationwide attention.
   Gov. James R. Thompson granted Dotson clemency, saying his
punishment had been sufficient. The governor, however, said he did
not believe the recantation, and has refused to pardon Dotson.
   Dotson attorney Thomas Breen's bid for a retrial is based on
recent genetic tests that the attorney says prove Dotson was not Ms.
Webb's assailant.
   Assistant State's Attorney Gayle Shines said Dotson's right to
ask for a retrial expired two years after his conviction, even
though the genetic tests were not available then.
   Circuit Judge Thomas R. Fitzgerald continued the hearing until
July 24, saying he needed more time to study the matter.
   Dotson, 32, remains in an alcoholism treatment center as a
condition of his parole last August. He had been returned to prison
in December 1987 for a parole violation.
   Since his 1985 release, Dotson has had recurring problems with
the law.

   Heavy rain on Monday pummeled parts of the South, where Louisiana
faces up to two more weeks of flooding following a week of
downpours, and Texas and Oklahoma cleaned up after a blitz of severe
storms packing 90 mph wind.
   Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus declared a state of emergency Monday
in two flooded Delta counties.
   Scattered new lowland flooding was reported in parts of Tennessee
and Kentucky, and some roads were reported blocked. Bowling Green,
Ky., got 5.02 inches in 24 hours, the National Weather Service
reported. Columbus, Ga., got 1.43 inches in one hour during the
morning and 3.42 inches in the 6 hours up to 2 p.m. EDT.
   Flooding kept at least 500 people from their homes in southeast
Texas and 200 in Mississippi. About 700 homes in Louisiana remained
flooded and the weather service said the flooding could continue for
two weeks. Flooded roads isolated still more homes.
   Texas, Louisiana and their neighbors have endured more than a
week of heavy rain from the remnants of Tropical Storm Allison. One
Louisiana town got nearly 29 inches in less than a week.
   Allison and its aftermath were blamed for four deaths in Texas,
three in Louisiana and three in Mississippi.
   At Nashville, Monday's rain, plus heavy rain in June and a damp
forecast, prompted the Corps of Engineers to lower the Cumberland
River 4 feet to avoid possible flooding along Riverfront Park, where
a July 4 fireworks display is planned.
   ``It's pretty muddy down there, but it shouldn't affect
anything,'' said Kolleen Hudgins of the mayor's office.
   Rising water chewed away at the earthen Mirror Lake Dam in
Louisiana's Winn Parish, but civil defense director Steve Robertson
said Monday that officials believed the levee would hold.
   A dam break would swell Saline Lake downstream, delaying drainage
of houses already flooded and flooding several more, Robertson said.
   The disaster declaration in Mississippi's Coahoma and Bolivar
counties is a step toward seeking federal disaster assistance and
speeding local and state aid.
   ``The water has affected farmlands homes, roads, culverts,
ditches and everything in the county,'' Bolivar County supervisor
Victor Baioni said.
   Bolivar County Agent Joe Love said Monday that cotton, soybeans
and some other crops might not survive.
   Officials said 33 inches of rain had fallen on the fields from
March 16 to July 2, about four times normal. Normal July rainfall
for Cleveland, Miss., is 4.3 inches, but officials said 6 inches
fell Saturday.
   People were traveling in canoes in parts of Cleveland, said
resident Joe Springer. ``I've been sitting ... with my grandchildren
and as far as I can see it's water on the street both east and
west,'' he said. ``You've never seen so many kids out using the
streets for a swimming pool.''
   While Allison's leftovers eased off toward the northeast, a fresh
storm system bolted across Oklahoma and Texas on Sunday, blowing
down power lines, spinning off tornadoes and causing
lightning-sparked fires.
   Power outages affected 100,000 customers in the Dallas-Fort Worth
area alone, and at least 20,000 were still without power by
midafternoon Monday.
   TU Electric, the area's primary electricity supplier, sent out
pleas for help by phone, radio and television to workers off for the
Fourth of July holiday.
   ``We have tried to bring in as many extra people as we can,''
said Kathy Miller, a spokeswoman for TU Electric. ``We have people
coming from as far as Tulsa and Houston to help out. Everyone from
line crews to people who answer the telephone. We need everyone.''
She said 1,000 additional workers had been brought in.
   ``This is the worst storm damage in Dallas since the 1979 ice
storm,'' said Dick Ramsey, a spokesman for TU Electric.
   Storms also hit a Salvation Army community center, ripping holes
up to 4 feet wide in the roofs of the center's building.
   ``The wind was so forceful it just literally ripped this roof off
and shot it like missiles off the top of the building,'' said
Salvation Army Maj. Milton Wood. The flying debris shattered windows
in the organization's bus and cars across the street.
   The wind toppled commercial air conditioning units on one of the
buildings, and one of the units still was missing Monday. Water
gushed into the center's library and gym when the wind knocked over
a 2,100-pound exhaust fan and sent it through the roof.
   ``At that time we had 12 kids in the building. We were bringing
the kids home from camp and we didn't want to take them home in the
weather,'' Wood said. He said they took refuge in the vestibule of
the center's chapel.
   In Collin County, north of Dallas, homes and automobiles were
pelted with hail as large as baseballs during a furious downpour
Sunday that lasted 15 minutes.
   At Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, Texas, an Alabama and Charlie
Daniels Band concert ended in chaos when a storm dumped heavy rain
and hail on spectators.
   ``It turned this place from a dust bowl into a mud bowl,'' said
Sgt. Bob Matson. ``The hail was marble-sized for 20 minutes. It
didn't matter where you were, there was no protection.''
   Several people were treated for minor hail injuries and
heat-related problems.
   East of Abilene, a performance at the Shakespeare Festival of
Dallas came to an abrupt end when officials evacuated 1,000 patrons
minutes before the stage collapsed under 90 mph wind. No one was
injured.
   About 30 trees were uprooted and the 40-foot scaffolding holding
lights and sound equipment collapsed. Cast and crew huddled
backstage while the set crashed around them.
   ``We're very thankful we got the patrons out,'' said Steve
Player, of the festival's board of directors. ``We're lucky we just
got soaked.''
   In Oklahoma, the severe thunderstorms set a house afire in
Oklahoma City, blew over a Ponca City mobile home and knocked down
power lines and trees.

   An explosion in a chemical mixing vat
ignited a fire at a 3M Co. plant Monday, killing three workers and
injuring two others, plant officials said.
   The explosion occurred around 1:15 p.m., officials said. It took
firefighters about 45 minutes to bring the fire under control.
   The cause of the blast was not known, said Hugh Hillhouse, site
manager of the plant's chemical division. It was the first fatal
accident in the plant's 27 years.
   The vat was used in the manufacture of two chemicals that are
part of the production of high-temperature gaskets, Hillhouse said.
   Hillhouse said damage to the plant was significant, but there was
no immediate cost estimate.
   Morgan County Coroner Gene Shelton identified the dead as John T.
Crawford, 46, of Somerville; Jerry Lloyd Wilkerson, 49, of Trinity;
and James Michael Martin, 36, of Athens.
   The two injured were taken to Parkway Medical Center. One was
treated and released, and the other was admitted, a hospital
spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman declined to give the hospitalized
worker's condition.

   At least three people were killed and 1,500
arrested in Maharashtra state Monday as a strike called by Hindus to
protest Sikh violence paralyzed Bombay, India's commercial center,
officials said.
   State police chief S.V. Bhave said all three deaths occurred in
Chikli, 230 miles west of Bombay, when police fired on a mob of
5,000 Hindus.
   The Press Trust of India said the arrests were made during
sporadic violence in the 18-hour strike, which was organized by
right-wing Hindu organizations. Bhave said 1,500 reserve police were
deployed in Bombay in addition to the city's 10,000-member police
force.
   State-run television broadcast segments showing deserted roads
and closed shops in Bombay, a city of 9 million. Factories and
schools were shut down and the stock exchange was empty, officials
said.
   Transport was virtually paralyzed. Strikers hurled stones at
buses on the road and set buses afire, a transportation company
official said.
   Like other officials, he spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The strike was called to protest the June 25 killing of 26 Hindus
by Sikh extremists in Moga, northern Punjab state.
   Militants among the Sikhs have fought since 1982 to set up an
independent nation in Punjab, a rich farming state bordering
Pakistan. The Sikhs complain of social and cultural discrimination
by the Hindu-dominated government.

   A leading opposition theorist Monday
proposed that Solidarity support a Communist candidate for president
in exchange for a Solidarity candidate becoming prime minister and
forming the next government.
   The proposal by historian-essayist Adam Michnik, in a front-page
column in the opposition's Election Gazette, drew no immediate
response from Communist Party officials who have failed to name a
presidential candidate to succeed Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   Also Monday, the White House reported President Bush urged the
Kremlin to withdraw its troops from Poland.
   The White House released the text of Bush's interview with Polish
reporters, whom he told Friday: ``Very candidly, I'd like to see
Soviet troops out. ... I would like to see them start withdrawing
troops from Poland because I think there is no danger at all of an
invasion of Poland from the West.'' Bush is to visit Warsaw on
Sunday.
   Poland's PAP state news agency said the Military Council of
generals who oversee the armed forces held an extraordinary meeting
to discuss the army's position after a party plenum failed to name a
presidential candidate.
   In an apparent indirect endorsement of Jaruzelski, the council
said it expects ``the chairman of the State Defense Committee and
the chief of the army to be a person of proper competence and giving
constitutional guarantees for the safe development of the country.''
   It stressed ``the significance of strengthening of Poland's
international position'' within the Warsaw Pact.
   The next president will have charge of the military, and the
other candidate mentioned for the post, Interior Minister Gen.
Czeslaw Kiszczak, has no foreign policy experience.
   About 200 people demonstrated against Jaruzelski outside
parliament Monday, and a small group of youths later hurled tear gas
and threw stones at police. No one was reported injured.
   ``Jaruzelski must go!'' and ``Soviets go home!'' chanted
protesters from the banned Confederation for an Independent Poland.
They also opposed the candidacy of Kiszczak, Jaruzelski's longtime
associate.
   The Polish leader declared Friday he is too closely linked with
the 1981 martial law crack down on Solidarity to lead the country
during an era of reconciliation.
   The Communist Party has asked him to reconsider, however, and
party consultations continued Monday to try to persuade him.
   With Solidarity's support evidenced by overwhelming victories in
parliamentary voting and growing independence shown by the two
parties allied with the Communists, it does not appear that internal
discipline is strong enough to translate the Communists' 300-259
National Assembly majority into a sure victory for Jaruzelski.
   The assembly, composed of the existing Sejm and a new freely
elected Senate, is to convene for the first time Tuesday. A vote on
the presidency is expected Thursday.
   Solidarity legislators say they will not vote for Jaruzelski,
though a formal decision was postponed until Wednesday.
   ``Poland needs now a strong and trustworthy arrangement of
authority,'' Michnik wrote. ``No facade-like changes are sufficient.
   ``Discussing the personal advantages of generals Jaruzelski and
Kiszczak is a false road,'' he wrote. ``What is needed is a new
arrangement that can be accepted by all main political forces.''
   He suggested a Communist Party candidate become president and a
Solidarity candidate become prime minister. Under Poland's revised
constitution, the president has charge of the army and foreign
affairs, and the prime minister names the Cabinet.
   Walesa previously has rejected suggestions the independent
movement become part of a governing coalition, insisting it remain
an opposition force.
   But Michnik, who is close to Walesa, said his plan is the only
way to ``practice the postulate of a grand coalition'' and receive
Western help to rebuild Poland's economy.
   The government negotiated political and economic freedoms with
the opposition after realizing it could not control social unrest or
end Poland's financial plight.
   The atmosphere of reform has attracted Western interest in
renewing aid and investment cut off since martial law.

   A bus plunged down a 10-foot embankment after
its brakes failed on a hill Monday, injuring 23 migrant farm workers
and the driver, officials said.
   The bus, which had been traveling down the steep hill at about 50
mph when the brakes failed, came to rest in a cornfield, said
Tompkins County Sheriff's Deputy Mark Dresser.
   ``He was whistling along pretty good,'' Dresser said. ``They were
very fortunate. They just missed two very large trees. They went
right between them.''
   At least one of the injured required surgery, but none of the
injuries appeared life-threatening, said Gail Longfellow, a
spokeswoman at Tompkins Community Hospital in Ithaca.
   The hospital treated all 24 people on the bus, including several
children and two pregnant women, for broken bones, cuts, back pains
and other injuries, Longfellow said.
   All but five were released Monday night, she said. Four were
admitted, one in serious condition and the others in satisfactory
condition, while the fifth was transferred to St. Joseph's Hospital
in Elmira for treatment of spinal injuries.
   The workers were being taken from Florida to a farm in Kings
Ferry, about 30 miles southwest of Syracuse, Dresser said.
   Many of the workers originally were from Haiti and did not speak
English. French-speaking hospital workers were brought in to
translate, Longfellow said.
   The sheriff's department impounded the converted school bus and
planned to check whether it had been properly maintained.

   President Bush has challenged the
Soviet Union to withdraw all its troops from Poland and take
advantage of ``an historic opportunity to help end the postwar
division in Europe.''
   Bush, who visits Poland on Sunday on his way to the seven-nation
economic summit in Paris, made the proposal in an interview with a
group of Polish reporters last Friday in the White House. The
transcript was released Monday by Bush's vacation White House.
   The Soviets should withdraw their troops from Poland because
``there is no danger at all of an invasion of Poland from the
West,'' Bush asserted. It was the first time the president called
for a total Soviet withdrawal of troops from Poland.
   Bush, here for an extended Independence Day holiday, issued a
statement Monday welcoming the Supreme Court decision restricting
women's right to end pregnancies.
   ``By upholding the Missouri statute, the court appears to have
begun to restore to the people the ability to protect the unborn,''
he said.
   Bush has voiced support for a constitutional amendment to
overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortions.
Chief of Staff John Sununu told a White House briefing the president
would continue to actively support such an amendment.
   Earlier, the president voiced condolences to the family of the
late Soviet President Andrei A. Gromyko, saying his death ``marks
the passing of a generation that witnessed many of the most historic
events of this century.''
   Bush boated, jogged and played golf for the third day in a row as
he continued to enjoy a five-day July Fourth holiday.
   He also mounted a $20,000 fireworks display for his neighbors
Monday evening from his six-acre compound on a point jutting out
into the Atlantic Ocean.
   Thousands of people lined the shore to watch the 15-minute
display, with more in hundreds of small boats in nearby waters.
   The fireworks, produced by Zambelli International of New Castle,
Pa., the same company that did the 1986 Statue of Liberty fireworks
in New York Habor, were paid for by an anonymous donor, White House
aides said.
   Poland is Bush's first stop on a trip that will also include
visits to Hungary, France and the Netherlands. He arrives in Warsaw
on Sunday and will remain in Poland through Tuesday.
   Bush, in the interview with Polish reporters, said he was not
seeking to ``inflame'' the situation in Poland or ``do anything that
is going to cause a crisis.''
   But, he said that when he visits Poland next ``I'm going to feel
free to speak out about ... what we hold dear and what Polish
Americans think and what we want to see about a freer, a more whole
Europe.''
   The challenge of Soviet troop withdrawal builds on the plan he
proposed last month while attending a NATO summit in Brussels that
called for reducing NATO and Warsaw Pact forces in Europe to no more
than 275,000 apiece.
   ``Very candidly, I'd would like to see Soviet troops ... out,''
Bush said in his interview with reporters for three Polish news
organizations.
   The Soviet Union currently maintains 40,000 troops in Poland,
according to the London-based Institute of International and
Strategic Studies.
   Bush conceded it was probably unrealistic to envision a complete
withdrawal of all Soviet forces in eastern Europe ``as long as we
have this tremendous disparity in Soviet-deployed troops.''
   He said, however, Poland would be a good place for the Soviets to
start.
   ``In Poland, there's an historic opportunity now to help end the
postwar division of Europe,'' Bush said.
   He said he hopes to carry through on a package of economic aid to
Poland as a reward for its recent steps toward democracy. But, Bush
told the Polish reporters: ``We need to know that you're going to be
able to not only continue existing reforms, but expand on reforms so
that the economic system that works will be given a chance to work
unfettered.''
   Bush said that he wasn't going to be naive in suggesting ``that
we have no differences'' with Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev on the
future of divided Europe.
   ``It doesn't bother me as president of the United States that he
(Gorbachev) gets a good standing on the applause meters over there
in Europe, western Europe,'' Bush continued. ``Nor should it bother
him when I take (my) message of freedom and democracy to eastern
Europe.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abe Stolar is coming home for his first Fourth of
July in America in 58 years. Both he and the city have changed since
1931, when dreams of a Soviet workers' paradise inspired a journey
into disenchantment.
   Since leaving his West Side neighborhood at 19, Stolar lost his
father during the Stalinist purges, his mother and sister to camps
in Siberia and the sight in one eye to a German hand grenade.
   A Chicago-born U.S. citizen, he served in the Red Army during
World War II, then worked as a translator and announcer for Radio
Moscow. Even after nearly six decades in the Soviet Union, however,
his accent is pure West Side.
   After a 14-year fight to emigrate, Stolar, 77, left the Soviet
Union for Israel in March with his wife, son, daughter-in-law and
two grandchildren.
   ``He's a very up person no matter what's happening. ... I think
that has helped him stay healthy. I think that has helped him stay
young,'' said Linda Opper of Chicago Action for Soviet Jewry, which
is financing and arranging his visit.
   Though the family has settled in Israel, Stolar is still drawn by
Chicago _ the first stop Wednesday on a 12-city tour by Stolar and
his wife, Gita Rozovskaya, that covers both coasts. They also will
visit Anchorage, Alaska, and Miami before winding up with an Aug. 13
trip to Los Angeles.
   Stolar's hometown has changed.
   ``His memory of Chicago is just frozen in time, in 1931,'' said
David Carle, a spokesman for Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who helped
draw attention to Stolar's efforts to leave the Soviet Union.
   ``It will be a new look at the old town, which will really be all
new to me,'' Stolar said in a letter to Simon's staff.
   The Depression is over. The skyline is taller, marked with new
silhouettes. Humboldt Park, a working-class neighborhood of mostly
Eastern European Jewish immigrants in the 1930s, is largely
Hispanic. Tuley High School, his alma mater, has been replaced by
Roberto Clemente High.
   But Wrigley Field looks much the same, and the recent addition of
lights at the venerable ballpark will make it possible for him to
catch Wednesday's night game between the Cubs and the San Diego
Padres.
   Stolar dreamed of one day staying in the posh, 3,000-room Stevens
Hotel, a dream that will come true.
   The hotel, now the Conrad Hilton and Towers, has offered the
Stolars its 23rd-floor Chicago Suite. Despite recent refurbishing,
the grand ballroom and grand salon _ glittering with mirrors and
gold leaf _ are virtually unchanged, said assistant manager Peter
Borup.
   No special menu is planned during Stolar's weeklong stay _ he's
``a junk-food junkie'' who likes hamburgers and hot dogs, Borup said.
   Stolar plans meetings with old friends throughout his visit, and
there is talk of a high school reunion while he is in Chicago, Ms.
Opper said.
   When Stolar's Russian-born parents headed home to help build a
new Soviet society, he ``planned to stay only a short time,'' Ms.
Opper said.
   But change was shuddering through the Soviet Union, and history
got in the way. Years passed. There was little hope of leaving, and
Stolar gave it little thought.
   Then he married and had a son, Michael. One day, the boy came
home excited at winning a school contest.
   ``He looked at his son, so full of hope, so full of enthusiasm,
and he thought, `This boy will never go anywhere in this country.
We've got to get out,''' Ms. Opper said.

   Lech Walesa's wife and a son represented him
Monday night at a formal dinner preceding the award of the first
Philadelphia Liberty Medal to the Polish Solidarity leader.
   Danuta Walesa, and one of her sons, Yaroslaw, 15, will stand in
for Walesa at the city's traditional Fourth of July ceremony
Tuesday. They are to be presented with the medal and the $100,000
cash award that accompanies it.
   After Monday night's dinner, Mrs. Walesa was introduced to the
crowd of about 500 people by former U.S. Sen. Edmund Muskie,
D-Maine, who was secretary of state under President Carter.
   Mrs. Walesa received a standing ovation, then thanked her
admirers in halting Polish, which was translated into English.
   Tuesday's ceremonies will cap the four-day Freedom Festival,
which included a hot-air balloon race, parade, food festival,
concerts and several fireworks shows.
   Walesa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983, had said he could
not attend the ceremonies because of the effort to install a new
government in Poland following the communist country's first largely
democratic elections in more than four decades.
   Philadelphia civic leaders intended the award to focus national
attention on Philadelphia on Independence Day.
   More than 80 nominations were reviewed by an international
selection committee. The award is meant for ``an individual or
organization that has demonstrated leadership and vision in the
pursuit of liberty of conscience or freedom from oppression,
ignorance or deprivation.''
   The committee said Walesa was chosen ``not only because of his
courage over many years, but also because of his recent
accomplishments in Poland expanding the prospects of political and
economic liberty.''
   Solidarity was born in the occupation strike at the Lenin
Shipyard in Gdansk in August 1980. Walesa, a shipyard electrician
from the port city, led the strike and emerged a folk hero. The
union was recognized as the Soviet bloc's only legally independent
union, but Polish officials later suppressed Solidarity activities,
interned Walesa, and banned the union.
   In January 1989, the government decided Solidarity could be
formally registered again as an independent trade union.
   Walesa, 46, and his wife have eight children.

   Andrei A. Gromyko, the tough-negotiating former
foreign minister who survived five Kremlin leadership changes and
weathered the dramatic turns of East-West relations in a half
century of public life, has died at age 79.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who succeeded the grim-faced Gromyko as
president on Oct. 1, announced the statesman's death to the Supreme
Soviet legislature today, the official Tass news agency and Radio
Moscow reported.
   ``The deputies at the session, with a minute of silence, paid
homage to the memory of the outstanding government and party
leader.'' Radio Moscow said.
   Soviet news reports said the diplomatic ace who oversaw Soviet
foreign policy for 28 years died Sunday. The cause of death was not
announced, but a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Friday that Gromyko
was hospitalized after undergoing surgery for a vascular problem he
did not further identify.

   The founder of the new African American
Catholic Congregation says he will adhere to Catholic teachings on
issues such as abortion and priest celibacy while incorporating
African and southern black religious traditions.
   The Rev. George A. Stallings celebrated the Imani Temple's first
service on Sunday before about 2,000 people at Howard University Law
School.
   Stallings said he created the church because he believes the
establishment Catholic church had failed to meet the spiritual and
cultural needs of blacks. Imani means ``faith'' in Swahili.
   But Cardinal James A. Hickey of Washington has condemned
Stallings' plans for the new church, which were announced two weeks
ago, and forbade Stallings to celebrate mass.

   More innocent bystanders are being shot and
killed at crime scenes in four major cities, according to a study
that says criminals show a ``growing contempt for accidental
victims.''
   Forty-one innocent bystanders were reported shot in New York, Los
Angeles, Washington and Boston in 1986, and 20 of them died. In 1988
that number leaped to 135 shot and 37 killed, according to a study
by Lawrence W. Sherman, a University of Maryland professor of
criminology.
   Overall, in those three years, 250 innocent bystanders were shot,
of whom 71 were killed and 179 wounded.
   ``Homicide in America is becoming more barbaric,'' Sherman said.
``We may not expect honor among thieves, but we do expect some honor
among killers. The growing contempt for accidental victims is even
indicated by he name killers give them: `mushrooms' who `pop up' in

   UNDATED _ Flood waters kept hundreds from their homes today in
three Southern states, and a storm packing 90 mph winds raced across
Texas, uprooting trees and chasing Shakespearean actors from an
outdoor stage in Dallas.
   The storm system developed in Okalahoma, bolted across Texas and
moved into Louisiana and Mississippi early today. Powered by strong
winds, the storm blew down power lines, spawned tornadoes and caused
lightning-sparked fires.
   Power outages left 75,000 customers without electricity today in

   Many also were back on the street within hours.
   After the 48-hour roundup ended early Sunday, officers counted

   In the Hindu Kush mountains,
shattered, crumbling huts tell tales their inhabitants probably
never will, of the savagery that turned thousands of villages into
graveyards.
   Families that tilled the orchards and fields for unknown
generations have disappeared. The silence is broken by an occasional
burst of gunfire or a military convoy roaring through the valleys
where shattered villages cling to the 15,000-foot mountains like an
image of Armageddon.
   What happened to villages like Lalma, Babagilala, Babamardan and
Babashangrul will not be known until the war between the government
and Moslem guerrillas ends and accounts can be pieced together from
villagers who escaped.
   After a decade of war, the barbarity has become widely known. But
in the Hindu Kush mountains, along the river valleys and across the
plains where the armies of Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan once
marched, the scenes of devastation go beyond what was previously
known about the conflict.

<HEAD>Gathering Seen As Start of Sephardic Renaissance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATIA BLACKBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost 500 years ago, the 250,000 Jews who had
flourished in Spain for hundreds of years were forced to convert to
Christianity, flee the country or be burned at the stake.
   Called Sephardic Jews, wherever they later moved over the
centuries, they never lost their passion for their od folk songs,
food and Ladino, a Spanish-Hebrew language mixture that served as
their counterpart to Yiddish.
   Now they're nurturing their culture in America.
   After leaving Spain, many went to North Africa, Italy, Turkey and
Greece, where they learned the customs and language of new
homelands, often faring better in Moslem nations than under
Christianity.
   Many Sephardic Jews eventually moved to Europe, South America and
the United States.
   A recent meeting of more than 500 of them in Seattle, called
``Emergence: American Sephardic Jewry Today,'' was seen as a kind of
American coming-out affair for them.
   Hal Lewis, the new executive vice president of the American
Sephardi Federation, says the conference was the largest gathering
of Sephardic Jews in the nation's history and marks the beginning of
a Sephardic Renaissance.
   ``There was a time when Sephardic traditions were the shining
light of Jewish life and tradition,'' Lewis said in an interview.
   ``The Jewish community in Spain, pre-expulsion, were leaders in
Jewish life. They were scientists, poets, artists, philosophers,
advisers to kings. It was the Golden Age of Spain.''
   An estimated 2.5 million of the world's 16 million Jews are
Sephardim, including 60 percent of those who have settled in Israel,
but they remain mostly outside dominant circles.
   Also considered Sephardim are Jews who trace their ancestry to
the Middle East and northern Africa. They lack Spanish ancestry and
speak Arabic but share religious practices with the Spanish
descendants because both groups looked to the religious center of
Babylonia for rabbinic leadership and rituals.
   Ashkenazim, the majority of Jews worldwide today, are descended
from those who looked more to religious centers in northern and
eastern Europe.
   Since the expulsion from Spain in 1492, Sephardim have been
largely overlooked partly because of numbers, partly because of
their internal divisions, Lewis said.
   Sephardim, although a majority in Israel, are nonetheless a
minority in the Knesset. Sephardic studies aren't incorporated in
Jewish schools, much of the Jewish establishment is ignorant of
Sephardic culture and many Sephardic communities are isolated, he
said.
   Seattle has an estimated 4,000 Sephardic Jews, the third-largest
community in the nation, and 14,000 Ashkenazim.
   ``Seattle is the strongest community in the nation for its size,
and one of the most vibrant in the world,'' Lewis said.
   That strength is largely because Sephardic religious leaders have
long targeted youth, said Rabbi Solomon Maimon, spiritual leader of
Sephardic Bikur Cholim synagogue for more than four decades and back
from retirement in Israel to attend the conference.
   ``We played baseball and basektball with them,'' Maimon said.
``We had schools and camps, and through the youth we got to the
parents. It was healthy. It kept people within the fold.''
   Children are called to help lead prayers for the Sabbath and
holidays, and many can conduct the prayers in Ladino, even if they
don't understand what they're saying, Maimon said.
   ``We've done an outstanding job in preserving our heritage
here,'' Maimon added. ``Everyone can do it. It's the vehicle of
self-preservation and transition to the future. Traditions are our
tools.''
   He said the conference was an opportunity for participants ``to
celebrate where they've come from and to ask some serious questions
about where the Sephardic community in the United States is going.''
   The Sephardim have much to learn from their Ashkenazi
counterparts in organization, fund raising, education, philanthropy,
and helping Israel and Jews in distress, Lewis said.
   But he added that the Ashkenazi world has a lot to learn from
Sephardim, too.
   ``The Sephardim always prided themselves on tolerance, respect
for opinions and ways of others,'' Lewis said. ``It's possible to be
both a part of and apart from society in which they live. That's an
aspect of Jewish life that Ashkenazi can learn from.
   ``In many cases, Sephardic history is a lot richer in terms of
culture and tradition than Eastern Europe.''

   At a White House meeting, President Bush has
told a national delegation of Roman Catholic educators that he
supports parental choice in education both for public and private
schools.
   He also maintained his support for tuition tax credits for
parents of students in non-public schools, clariying an earlier
qualified comment that had puzzled Catholic educators about his
position.
   Sister Catherine T. McNamee, president of the National Catholic
Educational Association, called the meeting ``a good beginning.''
Sister Anne Leonard, Chicago archdiocesan director of educational
services, said:
   ``We also gave Mr. Bush insight into the strong contribution
Catholic schools make in the urban centers of this country, meeting
the needs of the poor and disadvantaged.''

   A Southern Baptist ethicist says the new
emphasis on ethics in Congress is probably rooted more in political
expediency than genuine concern for morality in government.
   ``Political expediency is the primary ethic'' in Congress,'' says
the Rev. Paul D. Simmons of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.
``Whatever works in favor of a political party or its agenda will
usually be trotted out.''

   The leader of Reform Judaism says its strategy
should not be fashioned with an eye toward possible Orthodox
approval or criticism.
   ``Our forbears did not forge Reform Judaism to have us trade it
in for a tinsel imitation of Orthodoxy,'' said Rabbi Alexander
Schindler, president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations.
   Cautioning against being ``frightened by those who counsel us to
retreat from some of our recent innovations lest we break Jewish
unity,'' he told the annual meeting of the Central Conference of
American Rabbis:
   ``Let us not become sycophants, truckling for favor by becoming
what we are not. ... We would only demean ourselves and lose our
distinctive character.''

   United Methodist Bishop C. Dale White
has critized an unofficial ``Mission Society for United
Methodists,'' saying its practice of sending evangelists overseas is
``completely out of touch with reality.''
   He calls the independent group, based in Decatur, Ga., ``a
divisive force.''
   White, head of the church's New York Conference, told its annual
meeting that overseas churches need missionaries such as doctors,
nurses and other skilled people ``but they are not asking for
American preacher-evangelists.''

   The National Baptist Convention U.S.A.
Inc. plans to launch a cable TV news magazine on black life and
achievements, says the denomination's president, the Rev. T.J.
Jemison.
   It will deal with `` education, politics, civics _ not just
religion _ all the problems of the world,'' said Jemison, in
Nashville for the deomination's annual meeting and dedication of its
new $10 million Baptist World Center.
   The 7.5 million-member denomination is the country's third
largest Protestant denomination, next to Southern Baptists and
United Methodists, and the largest mainly black denomination.
   Jemison of Baton Rouge, La., said the cable program, called ``The
Black World Today,'' will emphasize ``good news regarding the black
community'' instead of ``reports of drugs, crime and violence on the
nightly news.''
   The program is to be carried on the new Vision Interfaith
Satellite Network, or VISN, an interdenominational cable network
that reaches seven million homes.

<TEXT>
   With all flags flying, fireworks bursting in
air, Congress in recess and President Bush in Kennebunkport, there's
a holiday pause in the legislative race toward a constitutional ban
on flag burning.
   But not in the patriotic speechmaking.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley wants calm, careful deliberations
in place of the emotional rush to amend the Constitution and
overrule the Supreme Court.
   The political tide is not running that way.
   There's an amendment ready to go. Bush went to the flag-raising
Iwo Jima monument, overlooking Washington, on Friday to urge swift
congressional approval of a ``simple, direct and to the point''
amendment.
   It declares:
   ``The Congress and the states shall have power to prohibit the
physical desecration of the flag of the United States.''
   At a hastily arranged rally, the president said ``for the sake of
the fallen, for the men behind the guns, for every American, we will
defend this flag.''
   The defense is symbolic. There's no sign that the flag is in
danger of wholesale desecration, the court license notwithstanding.
   While in recess, House members who joined an all-night flagathon
can attest to their patriotism by shipping home television tapes of
the speeches they made during a session that kept going until nearly
9 a.m. Thursday. There was nobody on the floor to listen, but the
tapes won't show that.
   Before recessing for Independence Day, the Senate and House both
adopted resolutions assailing the Supreme Court's June 21 decision
that burning an American flag is a permissible expression of protest
under the First Amendment.
   The issue is easy and automatic. The agenda in Congress is filled
with close questions and hard choices. But not this one. It is black
and white. Or red, white and blue.
   Most everybody signed on. Three senators and five House members
voted against the resolutions, saying that the right to dissent was
too precious for tampering, even on flag desecration, which they all
denounced.
   One of them, Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire, offered a
conservative's common sense but was drowned out by the chorus of
flag speeches.
   ``No one likes desecration but this just seems to me an exercise
in silliness and even a little bit of hypocrisy, if I may say so,''
Humphrey told the Senate.
   In the House, Foley said Congress should act carefully on the
issue, with hearings on the best way to protect the flag.
   There does seem to be time for that, but it doesn't fit the
political mood.
   Behind it all lies a question the Supreme Court doesn't answer:
why the justices chose to deal with the flag case in the first
place. It was not an urgent issue; indeed, hardly a visible one
until the court ruled, even though 48 states and the federal
government had flag desecration laws. It involved a flag burning
conviction that already had been overturned by a Texas appeals court
_ which got no national attention.
   And there are other ways to punish people who burn flags in
public places. The court said it wasn't suggesting a flag burner
couldn't be prosecuted for stealing _ the flag involved was snatched
from in front of a Dallas, Texas, bank _ or for trespassing,
disorderly conduct or arson.
   But the court has said all it will say, and the next move is up
to Congress. It will reconvene on July 11, the House offering its
regular pledge of allegiance to the flag at the start of its
session. During the flag outcry, more than one member noted that
practice. No member noted its origin.
   The House pledge is hardly a tradition. It began last Sept. 13,
when Bush was making the pledge of allegiance into a campaign issue
against Gov. Michael Dukakis, who once vetoed a bill to require it
in Massachusetts classrooms.
   Until that happened, the House said the pledge once a year. On
Flag Day, June 14.

   Today is Saturday, July 15, the 196th day of 1989. There are 169
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   Twenty-five years ago, on July 15, 1964, Sen. Barry M. Goldwater
of Arizona was nominated for president by the Republican National
Convention, meeting in San Francisco.
   On this date:
   In 1606, the Dutch painter Rembrandt was born in Leiden, the
Netherlands.
   In 1870, Georgia became the last of the Confederate states to be
readmitted to the Union.
   In 1918, the Second Battle of the Marne began during World War I.
   In 1948, President Harry S. Truman was nominated for another term
in office by the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.
   In 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered U.S. Marines to
Lebanon at the request of that country's Christian president,
Camille Chamoun, in the face of a perceived threat from Moslem
rebels.
   In 1965, U.S. scientists displayed close-up photographs of the
planet Mars taken by the spacecraft Mariner IV.
   In 1971, President Richard M. Nixon announced he would visit the
People's Republic of China to normalize relations. (Nixon made the
trip the following February.)
   In 1975, three American astronauts blasted off aboard an Apollo
spaceship several hours after two Soviet cosmonauts were launched
aboard a Soyuz craft for a mission linking the two ships in space.
   In 1976, a 36-hour kidnap ordeal began for 26 schoolchildren and
their bus driver as they were abducted near Chowchilla, Calif., by
three gunmen and imprisoned in an underground cell. (All the
captives escaped unharmed.)
   In 1978, President Jimmy Carter, in West Germany for an economic
summit, presided over a ``town meeting'' where he fielded questions
from about 1,000 Berliners.
   In 1982, the U.S. Senate confirmed George P. Shultz as America's
60th secretary of state by a 97-0 vote.
   In 1986, the American League beat the National League for only
the second time in 15 years, winning baseball's 57th All-Star Game
by a score of 3-2.
   Ten years ago: In a national broadcast, President Jimmy Carter
delivered his now-famous ``malaise'' speech in which he lamented
what he called a ``crisis of confidence'' and scolded Americans for
lacking the spirit and self-discipline needed to combat energy
shortages and inflation.
   Five years ago: In the face of protests, Democratic
nominee-apparent Walter F. Mondale reinstated Charles T. Manatt as
the party's national chairman, after trying to oust him in favor of
President Carter's old confidant, Bert Lance.
   One year ago: The leadership of the Teamsters Union chose William
J. McCarthy to fill out the remaining term of the late Jackie
Presser as president, narrowly rejecting Secretary-Treasurer Weldon
Mathis, Presser's hand-picked successor.
   Today's Birthdays: Actor Ken Kercheval is 54. Actor Alex Karras
is 54. Actor Jan-Michael Vincent is 45. Singer Linda Ronstadt is 43.
Actor Willie Aames is 29.
   Thought for Today: ``Conform and be dull.'' _ J. Frank Dobie,
American folklorist and author (1888-1964).

<HEAD>Corporate Manners: Wither Have They Gone?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It will be a seething second half of the year in
corporate society _ in New York, in Washington and Tokyo, and
wherever else the captains of industry and their lawyers meet to
scrap.
   Corporate society, once a comradely caste who sat on each other's
boards, talked yachting at ``the'' club and shared the same parlor
car from summer-home communities, are now brawling like street
fighters.
   Why, you can hardly lift your arm in a toast to continued good
profits without some scoundrel picking your pocket. You never know
if the rascal you're chatting with might raid your operation
tomorrow and dump you on the streets.
   Corporate good manners, steadily eroding since the great
Industrial Revolution, have now been abandoned. The devices employed
by today's new and avaricious tycoons are ungentlemanly, even
scandalous and often illegal.
   Nobody knows how to behave. Michael Milken, the most successful
financier of all time, measured by the billions he has raised, has
been indicted. Paul Bilzerian has resigned as Singer Co. chairman
after being convicted of criminal charges. And, of course, several
big financiers are residing in the cooler.
   The decline is international. In Japan, T. Boone Pickens, the
Texas investor, was denied three seats on the board of Koito
Manufacturing, Tokyo, although he owns 20 percent of the company. An
insult, to be sure, but it gets worse.
   Pickens said he was prepared for the rebuff, but he probably
wasn't ready for the accompaniments. Days before the meeting, rumors
spread that the company had hired toughs to disrupt his
presentation. Then the company's Japanese and American advisers
issued claims that he had ties to the Japanese underworld.
   It was no better in New York, where J. Richard Munro, Time Inc.
chairman, erupted in anger when the nervy Martin Davis, Paramount
Communications chief, thwarted Munro's dream of a quick Time-Warner
Communications merger.
   Munro unloaded all his ammunition. He wrote a personal letter to
Davis, who offered $175 a share _ and later $200 _ for shares then
selling at about $l25, saying he had ``serious questions about your
integrity and motives.'' Davis, he added, was motivated more by
spite than strategy, and his offer was ``cynical if not downright
deceptive.''
   Indicating that some of the good old days somehow managed to
survive, Time had the foresight to induce several big banks to
refuse money to anyone seeking to raid the company.
   Time also determined that it could avoid giving shareholders a
say in the Time-Warner deal, although it is sometimes alleged that
shareholders own the companies in which they invest.
   Time's lawyers asked various communities in which Time held
cable-TV franchises to complain to federal officials about Davis'
offer. The Time board rejected Paramount's offer out of hand. It
declined to speak with Davis.
   Throughout this maneuvering the world wondered whatever happened
to shareholder rights, to the obligation of multi-millionaire
executives to those who helped make them that way, to noblesse
oblige or the appearance of it.
   As the first half of the corporate social year drew to a close,
an answer to those questions was scheduled for the courts. Maybe the
Securities and Exchange Commission would get involved, too. And the
Federal Communications Commission.
   And that, of course, meant more uncivil scrapping, right out
there in the public arena for all the hoi polloi to witness.
Couldn't anything be kept quiet anymore? Didn't anyone have a sense
of propriety?
   For the executive class it was downright embarassing and
degrading, and it seemed to be getting worse.

<HEAD>HBO's `Not Necessarily the News' Returns</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It looks more like a network newscast than its
predecessors, and the news reports are the freshest yet _ live, in
fact, the first showing each week.
   But first-time viewers of ``Not Necessarily the News' on Home Box
Office won't be confused for long. Particularly when the news anchor
reports that the Chinese are claiming the leader of the student
uprising was Morgan Fairchild. Or that Yassir Arafat's mother is
upset that he didn't come to dinner Sunday.
   The HBO comedy series that began seven years ago started its new
season May 31 with a new cast and new format but with the old
irreverence still intact.
   ``Not Necessarily the News'' also airs live each Wednesday, to
give it a topicality it didn't have before. It will be repeated, but
only within the same week.
   The new version has two anchors, Annabelle Gurwitch and Tom
Parks, plus some contributing editors. Lucy Webb is the only
returning member of the old cast.
   ``The trouble before was that it had no linear construction, no
link,'' said co-executive producer John Moffitt. ``You had four or
five cast members who played all parts, from newsmen to crazy
general. Our trademark was taking real news footage and manipulating
it and cutting it with phony questions from our newsmen cast.
   ``But there was no audience identification with our people. It
never achieved an audience following. It was bounced around the
schedule and there was never anyone in the cast you could get
attached to because no one ever had enough air time.''
   Nevertheless, the show is the most honored program on cable. It's
won 12 ACE awards, plus numerous other citations.
   The show was adapted by Moffitt and his partner, Pat Tourk Lee,
from the British program ``Not the Nine O'Clock News.'' It was
originally sold to ABC, but the network didn't know how to program
it and turned it back to Moffitt and Lee. They sold it to HBO.
   ``We'd previously done `Fridays' for ABC and it was censored,''
said Moffitt. ``We have no censorship on HBO, but now that we don't
have to push to get things on, we're more circumspect. Take China,
for instance. Now that things have turned sour there and the
students were killed and people are being executed, we're being more
delicate.
   ``We used President Bush's response to the China situation, which
was so wishy-washy. He expressed `deep regret,' which we said falls
just short of `total regret.' We made a point and made people
think.''
   The show was less forthright in poking fun at the proposed
Time-Warner merger and the subsequent bid by Paramount to take over
Time. HBO is a division of Time Inc. ``It's hard to bite the hand
that feeds you,'' said Moffitt.
   ``We did have a test tone like that of the Emergency Broadcast
System. The announcer said, `This is a test from the Corporate
Takeover Service. If this had been an actual takeover you would have
been advised what action to take.'''
   ABC's ``Fridays'' was a copy of NBC's ``Saturday Night Live.'' It
lasted two years, 1980-82, and is best known for the amazing
realistic fight scene that the late comedian Andy Kaufman engineered
on the show. ``There are still people who refuse to believe we
didn't set that up,'' said Moffitt.
   Moffitt and Lee also produce the annual ``Comic Relief'' for HBO,
which has raised more than $10 million for medical aid to the
homeless.
   ``Not Necessarily the News'' began on HBO in September 1982, and
in its first four years was a half-hour show. Later, it became a
series of one-hour specials, which made it difficult to be topical.
The show was severely affected by the writers' strike last year, but
returned in time to wrap up ``the Reagan legacy.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   BY ANY OTHER NAME _ Paramount's upcoming half-hour news and
information series has had its name changed from ``Tabloid'' to
``Hard Copy.'' The syndicated show will debut Sept. 18 and so far
has been sold in 120 markets. Alan Frio will be the news anchor of
``Hard Copy,'' which will ``delve behind the headlines to report the
untold stories about the people, places and events making news
today,'' according to Paramount executive Frank Kelly.

<HEAD>Denver, Playing White House, Wants to Play Horseshoes With President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Denver had more in mind than playing guitar
when he signed on as host of the first ``In Performance at the White
House'' of the Bush administration.
   ``I have a personal agenda in this. I want to play horseshoes
with the president,'' Denver said on a recent visit to New York as
host of a United Nations dinner on World Environment Day.
   ``I have tandem (horseshoe ) pits at my home,'' Denver said.
``I've been home in April and May for the first time in over 10
years, and my game has sharpened.''
   The one-hour ``In Performance at the White House'' airs tonight
on PBS. It also features actor Barry Bostwick, opera star Simon
Estes, Broadway singer Judy Kaye, the ragtime ensemble from the
Marine Band and ragtime pianist Joshua Rifkin.
   The executive producer of the show, John Musilli, presented
President and Mrs. Bush with several possible formats for this
season's ``In Performance at the White House'' series. They selected
one based on Earl Robinson's song, ``The House I Live In,''
referring both to the White House and the United States. Musilli
chose Denver as host of the opening concert.
   ``I called the Bushes,'' Musilli said. ``They said, `That would
be terrific. Do you think he'll do it?'''
   Denver, who was delighted to accept, said, ``Mr. Bush attended my
first concert at Carnegie Hall, in 1971, I think. I think he has
been a fan of mine.''
   Musilli hopes the two other shows in the series, like this
post-Fourth of July special, will have holiday themes, airing around
Columbus Day and Thanksgiving.
   The ``In Performance at the White House'' season in the Reagan
administration featured Broadway music.
   Denver will sing and play guitar as well as serve as host. He
said he would include his popular hits ``Rocky Mountain High,''
``Annie's Song'' and ``Country Roads.''
   Three ragtime pieces by Scott Joplin will be included, ``Pleasant
Moments,'' by Rifkin, ``The Pineapple Rag,'' with Rifkin
accompanying Miss Kaye, and ``Magnetic Rag,'' the last one Joplin
composed, by the Marine musicians, with Bostwick reading from E.L.
Doctorow's ``Ragtime.''
   Bass-baritone Estes will sing ``The House I Live In.'' The finale
will involve everybody joining in on ``Play a Simple Melody'' then _
since demand for an encore is expected _ Miss Kaye will sing ``Take
Care of This House'' from Leonard Bernstein's 1976 Broadway show,
``1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.''
   In the interview, Denver asked for maple syrup for his coffee,
but none is to be had. He likes it in coffee, he said, and on the
sourdough pancakes he makes for Sunday breakfasts. His sourdough
batter ``starter,'' he said, is more than 100 years old and gets
better all the time.
   Denver and his Australian wife, Cassie, had their first child, a
girl, in May. Jesse Belle was born by natural childbirth with Denver
assisting at Aspen Valley Hospital, where Denver had donated money
for a pediatric wing, named for his two older children, Zack and
Anna Kate. Denver said before the baby was an hour old, he held her
and sang to her. He can't remember what he sang except for an Indian
chant and a song he wrote in April, ``The Gift You Are.''
   He thinks it's one of his particularly good compositions. He'll
record it in July on an album for his own label, Wind Star. ``I love
it when I write a good song. You know when you've got a good one,''
he said.
   The song isn't just for the baby, he said. Denver said all people
must participate in the struggle to save the environment so that
human life can continue. ``The song is saying that each of us is a
gift to the world and to the people we love and we should live up to
that, in a sense.''

   Functional illiteracy in this country is widely
recognized as a serious problem. But beyond this, there are many who
can read enough to get by but find they'd rather do anything else.
For this group, a remarkable program based on children's books
offers a way of entry to the cultural mainstream.

   Marie Isenor, wife, mother and convenience
store clerk, dropped out of high school five months before
graduation. She's kept a low profile e``When I go to meetings, I'm always
the one in the back not
saying much. I've always been interested in graphic arts, but I
never since.
   ver did anything about it. I didn't think I was smart enough.''
   She's beginning to see herself differently, due largely to a
series of children's book discussions at the library. The
gatherings, led by an area scholar, brought together a wide range of
people, from Adult Basic Education students like Isenor to college
graduates.
   ``I wasn't there five minutes before I was involved in the
discussion,'' says Isenor, who lives in Quechee. Rather than drop
out after mily Reading Project. In her
case, as in most, the experiment seems to be working.
   ``I learned a lot about how other people think. Some thought a
lot along my lines. I pretty much always thought I was on my own,
that I was the only person who had those kinds of thoughts.''
   Discussion leader Nick Boke, who teaches history at a community
college, learned something, too. ``There's a statistic that gets
thrown around, that only 20 percent of the population can think
abstractly. This confirmed my belief: It's because only 20 percent
of the population has ever been asked.''
   The Family Reading Project is based on a modest formula: Choose
10 classic children's books on a single theme _ courage, for
example, or friendship. Give them to 20 or 30 adults from a
cross-section of the community, then invite them back for three
monthly discussions led by a humanities scholar.
   That simple recipe is yielding rich intellectual fare. It's also
shattering stereotypes, building self-esteem and easing isolation.
``I can go all winter and never see anyone,'' says P.V. Hall, a
mother of two who lives near Killington Ski Area.
   ``I started coming to the reading group thinking I was doing it
for the kids. I ended up feeling it was more for me.''
   The discussions also give adults from all layers of society the
same chance to discover the wonder of books and to pass it along to
their children.
   ``Reading is transformative,'' says project director Sally
Anderson, a former librarian and reading teacher. ``It's so
mean-spirited to make it a class issue.''
   Yet class-consciousness often trespasses into public education.
``We're so middle class. Our schools are so middle class. We take so
many things for granted,'' Anderson says. ``We say to parents, `Just
tell your kids to turn off the TV.' But some parents don't have the
self-esteem to take control of their families.''
   Others may lack the necessary vocabulary or reading ability to
decipher a complex, puzzling world, she says. ``We have all these
visual signs. If you don't know the signs you are really cut off, in
ways most of us don't even understand.''
   The Family Reading Project has its roots in a similar reading and
discussion program begun 11 years ago by a Vermont librarian to
encourage people to read better books. The program she started has
now been held in more than half of Vermont's 251 communities.
   In 1986, an Adult Basic Education tutor asked organizers to
create a similar program for her students. Many lived on back roads
not served by public transportation and felt cut off from their
communities and their neighbors.
   A discussion group for these people, complete with child care,
could provide an entree to libraries and other cultural centers,
Anderson thought.
   It also could show newly literate adults that reading can be more
than a survival skill, something new readers get too few
opportunities to find out.
   ``It takes a special genius to make reading boring,'' says
Anderson, an energetic, forthright woman who realized early in her
career that ``no one ever came to the library looking for the sequel
to `Dick and Jane.'''
   Most adult reading texts are no more compelling, she says. For
every ``see Spot run'' there's a grown-up equivalent: ``Bill had a
gun. It was black.''
   ``Once you take the richness out of language, who cares?''
Anderson says. ``Nobody comes home at night and says, `Oh God! I've
got a new stove! I can't wait to read the manual!'''
   Textbooks may teach reading, she thought, but they don't teach
the love of reading. That's literature's job. But what sort of
literature? Surely no one who reads at a fourth-grade level should
be expected to plow through ``The Grapes of Wrath.''
   But why not ``Charlotte's Web?'' Or ``Make Way for Ducklings?''
Why not the best of children's literature?
   Would grown men and women be insulted at the prospect of reading
the same books as their grade-schoolers? Anderson didn't think so.
``Children's literature is complex. Any of these books can be
discussed on deep psychological levels.''
   How about the college professors, writers and other highbrows
who'd be leading the discussions? How would they feel about focusing
their analytical skills on ``The Biggest Bear?''
   ``Good literature is good literature,'' says Nick Boke.
``Well-chosen words work. The main difference between adult
literature and children's literature is that children's books have
fewer words.

   ``The issues are the same. They are the human issues: loneliness,
love, fear, bravery, the small triumphs of day-to-day existence.''
   And so, with a grant from the Vermont Council on the Humanities,
the new program, Connections, made its debut in six towns in 1986.
Some books were more advanced than others, but participants were
given tapes to help them through the tougher ones. They also got
extra coaching from their tutors.
   The scholars got some coaching, too. Organizers urged them to act
as discussion leaders rather than teachers. ``As soon as a program
like this smacks of school, people can't hear. They shut down,''
Anderson says.
   At first, Boke recalls, participants were wary. ``There they sat,
book in hand, with a `now-what' look on their faces.''
   It didn't take long for the books to work their magic.
   ``Make Way for Ducklings,'' the story of a duck who escorts her
brood through Boston traffic to a new home in the Public Garden,
sparked a lively discussion about the trials of getting kids to
mind. ``Ramona and Her Father,'' about a girl whose father loses his
job, prompted a revelation: ``I never knew that kids worried,'' one
mother said.
   Tales of ducks, bears and spiders encouraged talk of love, trust
and courage. And the more people talked, the more evident it became:
Connections could do more than help people become better readers. It
also could help them become better parents.
   The next year, the program expanded to 14 towns, then to the
state hospital and the prisons, where corrections officials
witnessed a minor miracle: Inmates refrained from both ethnic slurs
and swearing during their book discussions.
   For a while, at the state hospital, it was unclear who were the
staff members and who were the patients. For a while, it didn't much
matter.
   Folks were connecting _ with books, with ideas, with each other.
That might have been that, had it not dawned on organizers that the
program was popular not only with adults.
   It also scored points with their kids.
   Some parents who sat down to read their new books to their
children discovered the kids already knew the stories. They'd been
busy memorizing the tapes.
   One mother, engrossed in ``Ramona and Her Father,'' told her
hungry family she'd be happy to fix their dinner _ as soon as she
finished her book. ``I couldn't feed those kids 'til 7 that night,''
she said.
   A mother unwilling to tear herself away from her book sends a
powerful message: Reading is fun!
   ``For some people, these were the first books they'd ever
owned,'' says Michael Bouman, executive director of the state
Council on the Humanities.
   ``One man moved his bowling trophies so he could more prominently
display his new books. All kinds of things were happening that we
didn't have the vision to anticipate.''
   Which gave Bouman, the well-educated father of two non-reading
teen-agers, an idea: Why not start a children's book discussion
group for experienced readers, with the goal of encouraging people
throughout Vermont to read to children?
   The Vermont Council on the Humanities' Family Reading Project
came off the drawing board last fall, with a grant from the National
Endowment for the Humanities and a lot of crossed fingers; at the
last minute, its architects decided to combine new readers with old
in some groups.
   Some organizers were worried. What if ABE students felt too
intimidated to take part in the discussions? What if integrating the
two groups produced only painful reminders of past school failures?
   Anderson was convinced the new readers could hold their own.
``The idea that poor people are dull, that they have no intellectual
curiosity, is absolutely false.''
   Leading an earlier Connections discussion group had helped her
clear the last vestiges of social stereotyping from her own mind.
Here was a chance to help others do the same.
   At first, Nick Boke says, ABE students did stand out, ``but only
by their incredible shyness. The sad thing is that in many cases
they've done little less than those who made it through school.''
   ``The ones who made it just lucked out a little, or put in that
extra 14th of a percent effort to get the degree. ABE students are
not dramatically different from a lot of high school graduates _
except in how they feel about themselves.''
   Watching feelings change and shyness disappear has been the
highlight of the project, says Boke. ``It's very exciting to watch
people find the joy of using their minds and being recognized for
it.''
   By year's end, organizers hope to complete 32 Family Reading
programs in 27 towns, with more planned for next year. Similar
programs are being developed in the other New England states, along
with a study to gauge their effectiveness. ABE tutors already report
that the switch from textbooks to storybooks has greatly increased
students' motivation.
   ``You have quite a brain on you,'' Nick Boke remarked to one
participant at the last session. ``What are you going to do with
it?''
   Marie Isenor, who never thought she was smart enough, has given
Boke's comments some thought. She's studying for her high school
equivalency diploma.
   And she recently took her first graphic arts course.

   In this the bicentennial of the French
Revolution, France's influence as a world power is waning. Be that
as it may, a large proportion of Frenchmen insist Charles de Gaulle
proved a generation ago that even a France on the ropes is a vital
force in the world.

   Divided at home, humbled abroad, the French
resolutely resist the judgment of a growing number of outsiders that
the nation has slipped into the second ranks of world power.
   France's economy is three-quarters the size of West Germany's, a
third of Japan's. Its latest foreign adventure, a relief attempt in
Lebanon, ended in debacle. Its influence in Africa is melting away.
   Although France keeps its own nuclear arsenal, it is edging
closer toward NATO, seeking a part in the vast electronic air
defense and battlefield command system planned by Atlantic allies.
   Steadily, its once influential foreign policy is slipping into
the shadow of West Germany.
   The comfortable old channels of domestic politics are blurred by
rebellion at the center, a new appeal by ecologist candidates toward
the left and anti-immigrant extremism at the far right.
   Traditional values are changing at an unprecedented pace. Young
rockers, new conservatives, rootless travelers _ the ``new tribes,''
according to pop commentators _ splinter sectors of society.
   And the nation that traces itself back to feisty Gauls who stood
up to Caesar is joining 11 European partners in a dream of unity a
popular French thinker calls a ``Darwinian nightmare.''
   Whatever indicators might show, however, a sizable proportion of
Frenchmen insist Charles de Gaulle proved a generation ago that even
a France on the ropes is a vital force in the world.
   Jacques Chirac, the former premier who lost presidential
elections last year to Francois Mitterrand, told reporters recently
that France was a waning power only because it acted like one.
   ``Gaullism is not an ideology, but a way of behaving,'' said
Chirac, now mayor of Paris, before leaving for New York to talk
about France on the bicentennial of its revolution.
   Chirac, a conservative who heads France's neo-Gaullist Rally for
the Republic party, argued that countrymen from across the political
spectrum subscribed to what the former president represented in
rebuilding postwar France.
   ``General de Gaulle followed two basic concepts, a certain idea
of the nation, and a certain idea of man,'' he said.
   ``Exactly,'' said Philippe Gillieron, marketing director for the
Eiffel Tower, who considers the soaring steel girders a symbol of
what France means to the world. He explained:
   ``Economically, if maybe we're bigger than Togo, or even Greece,
we're no major power. But in culture, for our ideas on human rights
and the evolution of humanity, we have an active, distinct role.''
   When the Eiffel Tower opened 100 years ago, Gillieron said, it
marked a new epoch of industrial prowess. Today, he said, centennial
festivities heralded a revolution in global communications.
   ``After all,'' he concluded, ``the Eiffel Tower is as well known
to the world as Coca-Cola.''
   Mitterrand is hard at work realizing an old dream, to build the
world's most modern library. According to the plan, work starts in
1991 on the billion-dollar complex, covering 17.3 acres.
   To emphasize its role as at least a symbolic power, France is
celebrating its bicentennial with everything from a string of
summits to sheep on the Champs Elysees.
   A two-hour July 14 parade, named ``La Marseillaise,'' included
Chinese break-dancers among the 8,000 participants from around the
world.
   Counting such monuments as the Opera Bastille, a glass pyramid
for the Louvre and new gold leaf for the Invalides dome, the cost
ran into the billions of dollars.
   Frenchmen who date their history back 2,000 years, not 200, tend
to dismiss the revolutionary rage as unseemly. Many regard
image-building abroad as a diversion from pressing problems at home.

   ``It's a fiasco,'' said Serge Barbarin, a 27-year-old winemaker
in Medoc, north of Bordeaux. ``Celebrations were planned at the last
minute, to lure tourists. These people in power are not serious.''
   Barbarin, heir to the Biston-Brillette vineyards at Moulis, is
not worried about grandeur. France, he said, has never failed to
change with the times and come out at the head table.
   Instead, he fears a race to compete on uncertain ground might
damage the quality, proportion and pace of life that once made
France so pleasant for Frenchmen.
   He leads a visitor among the oaken casks where deep red wine
takes its time to mature in centuries-old cellars. Suddenly, he
glances at his watch and says: ``Sorry to rush, but my computer is
arriving.''
   In almost every aspect, France today takes the cliche ``land of
contrasts'' to extremes.
   Along the Champs Elysees, franchise burgers are sold at seven
outlets between the Arc de Triomphe and the Concorde, but to most
Frenchmen ``fast food'' means leaving the table after the first hour.
   North of Paris, supersonic Concordes swoop over the farmlands of
Picardy, studded with stone cathedrals and still partly tilled by
peasants for whom a restaurant meal is an unthinkable luxury.
   Fast trains streak by canals where tiny boats carry produce to
the floating market at Amiens, not all that unlike traditional
markets in the far-flung places that France once colonized.
   Up along the English Channel and just inland from the Riviera,
speculators pay inflated prices for stately old houses and flimsy
eyesores that are popping up in empty spaces once left for gardens.
   On the beach near San Raphael, just down the coast from Cannes, a
developer is building a tourist village of 10,000 beds.
   But across vast sections of the center, historic hamlets collapse
in disrepair, and small farm families throw in the towel after
centuries on the land.
   At the edge of little towns all over the French countryside, vast
tin-sided ``hypermarche'' shopping centers are becoming as
ubiquitous as the mossy church on the square.
   In the Picardy town of Roye, Marcelle Carpentier-Vasset, in her
70s, still sizes up her customers to determine how many eggs to put
in the omelete. When impressed, she goes up to five.
   ``I'm afraid for my kids,'' she says. ``Things are going badly in
France. No jobs, few prospects. I don't know what to expect.''
   Unemployment, in fact, seems to be easing slightly from its
persistent level of 10 percent, and officials insist things will
improve after 1992 when European partners forge a single market.
   Premier Michel Rocard, along with most of France's political
leaders, pushes hard for a tightly linked Europe in which France,
they say, will inevitably play a leading role.
   Chirac wields a sheaf of studies that predict Paris will evolve
back into its natural role as the capital of Europe.
   But that seems to be at the heart of the malaise Barbarin
mentioned, which few of the people who share his sentiment can put
in specific terms.
   The attraction of Paris is largely geographic. Its fast trains
and large airports will accommodate a polyglot tide, ebbing and
flowing from Portugal to the Baltic Sea.
   Already, the treasured City of Light is slipping from real life
into tourist brochures. Paris awakes to rebroadcasts of Dan Rather,
in English. Its menus are subtitled in German and Japanese.
   On the outskirts, EuroDisneyland is hiring 12,000 people and
training them to smile at strangers all day long.
   If the French capital is the capital of a borderless Europe, a
lot of people are beginning to ask, what happens to their certain
idea of France?

   Few are those who can think of France and not
immediately think of food.
   French art may be on the wane. French literature leans heavily on
past reputation. And a French intellectual of international stature
is hard to find.
   But the country's reputation as one of the best places in the
world to eat is both enduring and well deserved.
   ``He who invents a new dish will have rendered humanity a greater
service than the scientist who discovers a planet,'' said Anthelme
Brillat-Savarin, the 18th century lawyer and government official who
wrote ``Physiology of Taste.''
   That is perhaps the best expression of a Frenchman's attitude
toward the dinner table.
   To be sure, not everything that comes from France is better. And
while ``haute cuisine'' may be as good as it ever was, restaurants
of medium quality where customers could always get a good meal for a
moderate price are fast disappearing.
   But there is little doubt the French brought the culinary art to
its apex. Top chefs, food historians and critics agree that the
basic reason is an accident of geography.
   ``We are privileged from the point of view of climate,'' says
three-star chef Emile Jung.
   Adds Bernard Naegellen, director of the Michelin Red Guide: ``All
of the agriculture of temperate countries is represented here. And I
think it's that, the great variety of agricultural products, meat,
game ... that has given the French the habit of eating well.''
   But to the products must be added the creativity.
   ``There is in the French genius for gastronomy something of the
Cartesian dream to order the universe, to refine the physical until
it is trembling on the brink of the ideal,'' wrote historian Sanche
de Gramont 20 years ago, perhaps getting a bit carried away.
   The genius of French cooking, according to Jung, lies in the
wine, both simmering in its sauces and in the glass.
   Also, the French are not afraid to spend an inordinate amount of
time thinking about what others may consider a frivolous subject.
   ``There is no place where they talk as much about food,'' says
food historian Philip Hyman. ``The French are very knowledgeable
about food.''

   Few events in recent medical history captured the
public's interest more than the implantation of artificial hearts in
humans. But the recipients all died within months and the procedure
has not been tried again in several years. Now, with a shortage of
donors of human hearts for transplantation, some in the medical
community want to resume using permanent mechanical hearts.

<TEXT>
   In the three years since the last of the
recipients of artificial hearts died, the man-made blood pumps have
been used only to keep patients alive until they could get a human
heart transplant.
   William J. Schroeder, 52, the second of five permanent artificial
heart recipients, was the longest to live. He died on Aug. 7, 1986,
of a stroke, 620 days after the operation.
   Now, with a shortage of human heart donors, a pioneer in the
transplant field says it's time to resume implanting permanent
artificial hearts, despite their shortcomings.
   But the inventor of the most successful artificial heart to date
disagrees, saying research efforts should be concentrated on
developing a better pump.
   And the surgeon most noted for implanting permanent artificial
hearts has indicated little interest in resuming the work.
   Nonetheless, Dr. Jack G. Copeland says the time has come to try
again.
   Copeland in 1985 became the first surgeon to use an artificial
heart successfully as a temporary bridge to transplantation of a
human heart. He says that despite its shortcomings he has now
changed his thinking about permanent implantation of the primary
artificial heart now in use, the air-driven Symbion J-7, formerly
known as the Jarvik-7.
   One of those shortcomings is that the recipient is tethered
through the abdominal wall to a pneumatic drive unit weighing about
300 pounds.
   In a recent interview, Copeland said the device should be used
for patients with end-stage heart disease who do not qualify for
transplants because of their age or other health problems.
   ``I think in small terms about individual lives, one at a time,
and why is somebody who's dying of heart disease any less valuable
to us than somebody who has an aortic valve replacement or a
coronary bypass?'' says Copeland, who heads the heart-transplant
program at the University of Arizona.
   ``I know there's something I can do for him. I just don't have
the money, I don't have the support, I don't have somebody who says,
`OK, Dr. Copeland, we give you approval for so many cases.' ''
   The biggest obstacles to anyone resuming implanting artificial
hearts, he says, are money, the pressures of life in a fishbowl, and
the public's inability to view such procedures as experimental and
``allow us to fail.''
   The International Society for Heart Transplantation says 2,650
transplants were performed worldwide last year, including 1,630 in
the United States. There were 1,441 in this country in 1987.
   Experts say the number of donor hearts is reaching a plateau,
though surveys have suggested that from 20,000 to 75,000 Americans
could benefit annually if the supply was available.
   Copeland believes the problems that plagued long-term recipients
of artificial hearts, including infection, bleeding, strokes and
clotting, can be solved and patients could be released to live in an
apartment within about three weeks after surgery.
   ``If I could get somebody to come up with enough bucks to do it,
I would do it,'' he says.
   ``I think that he's perfectly justified to do that,'' says Dr.
Robert Jarvik, inventor of the Jarvik-7 and Jarvik-7-70, artificial
hearts.
   But because of the expense of artificial heart implantation and
care, as well as their lack of mobility, Jarvik says it's unlikely
the currently designed pump will be pursued for permanent use.
   ``If Dr. Copeland has resources and the availability to work on
it, that's fine, it's ethically justified, he can help some
people,'' Jarvik says. ``But I think in general most people want to
work on electric powered systems.''
   Copeland concurs, but argues that until a better, internally
powered device is developed, tested and available, lives can be
prolonged by permanently implanting the current devices.
   ``I think we agree,'' says Gerson Rosenberg, assistant chief for
the Division of Artificial Organs at Pennsylvania State University's
Hershey Medical Center. Dr. William Pierce, the director, designed
the Penn State artificial heart, and its second recipient lived with
it for 397 days.
   Rosenberg says most people in the field agree that the long-term
answer will lie with development of electrically driven, permanently
implantable hearts. But he says the current devices could be put to
worthwhile use in some patients until then.
   Dr. William DeVries performed four of the five permanent Jarvik
implants. Schroeder survived a record 620 days. But he, three other
Americans and Leif Stenberg, who received a Jarvik-7 in Sweden, all
developed strokes and other fatal complications from the
plastic-and-metal pumps.
   Jarvik notes that the federal Food and Drug Administration, which
authorizes use of experimental medical devices, won't allow clinical
testing of a device unless it is intended for widespread use.

   On one trip, as we reached the Kansas-Nebraska line, Dad decided
to look up a distant cousin whom he hadn't seen since boyhood.
   ``Ed is the Burlington Railroad station agent in Beatrice,'' said
Dad.
   ``I thought he lived in Wymore,'' said Mother.
   Dad snorted in disgust at fallible female memories. We roared
through Wymore and proceeded 14 miles on an unbelievably bad road to
Beatrice. Cousin Ed ran the station in Wymore.
   Furious, Dad retraced the route as though he were driving Ben
Hur's chariot, and I remember poor Tony, hanging upside down and
squawking, ``Good night! Good night!''
   Blig was not a pet, but a four-footed family member. When the
snooty desk clerk at the Hotel Fontenelle in Omaha made it plain
that dogs were unwelcome, Dick and I managed to get the terrorized
animal seven floors up the fire escape. The next morning, we all
came grandly down the elevator to the astonishment, if not delight,
of the staff.
   Blig's trust in us was deep, but not bottomless. Once, following
a sudden rain, when our car had slipped off the road three times in
a mile, Blig took his place in the truck at the head of the tow
line, gazing back at us anxiously through the rear window. The bones
that served him for 16 years lie beneath a handsome oak in south
Tulsa. He deserves his rest.
   The good earth of the Midwest, as the world knows, grows fine
corn and wheat, and, properly graded, it makes a tolerable road if
you can stand the dust. But the first sprinkles of an earnest rain
back in the early '20s meant things would happen fast to cars with
narrow, high-pressure tires (guaranteed for 8,000 miles).
   One time, the storm hit us when the Lamoni, Iowa, water tower was
already in sight. We didn't make it, and had to be hauled to the
beginning of Lamoni's brick pavement by a team. There we stayed for
three days, waiting for the roads to dry out enough to get us to Des
Moines.
   In three days, you can get pretty well acquainted with Lamoni,
which got its name out of the Book of Mormon and still possesses a
Latter-Day Saints college. In driving I-35, I have occasionally
turned off two miles to see if Lamoni has changed. It hasn't.
   Another town I knew intimately was Wamego, Kan., where we
remained for five days while a differential gear was making its way
on the Union Pacific from Kansas City. At Wamego there was a summer
Chautauqua, a strictly American invention named for the vacation
colony in New York state. They flourished best in the pre-movie and
pre-radio days and brought culture and entertainment to the
boondocks.
   Chautauquas featured famous preachers, humorous speakers,
ex-governors, Swiss bellringers, and dramatic selections like East
Lynne and Simon Slick from Punkin Crick. But for the faulty gear, I
would never have seen one.
   Much of city-living Young America today, alas, rides the
interstates, which is like going through a pipeline, or flies over
the clouds, either way without contact with rural life. It was
different if you cross-countried in the '20s.
   Our favorite touring car was a large open Marmon, painted in two
shades of green. We called it the Cucumber. It was marvelously
commodious, but its make was rare, and when we snapped a fan belt
and sought a replacement in village garages we might as well have
asked for new main bearings for the Mauretania.
   Thus it was that we once went boiling across southern Nebraska
from windmill to windmill, making the acquaintance of astonished
farmers and harvest hands. Of course, we were invited to lunch.
   Rural hospitality was great, partly out of native kindness and
partly because our windblown party with its traveling zoo generated
irrestible curiosity. But there were dangers, too.
   On one occasion, when the Cucumber spent the night in the ditch
near Storm Lake, Iowa, a concerned farm wife accommodated Dick and
me on a straw tick in the attic with a kerosene lamp for company.
   There was nothing to read but Dr. Winfield's Home Counselor, and
for weeks thereafter I came down successively with polio, leprosy,
appendicitis, tuberculosis and various dementias.
   No modern youngster has any idea of the confusion when all
America simultaneously was trying to struggle out of the mud. Road
improvements meant detours and a detour (French for ``turn from'')
was invariably worse than the road for which it substituted. Once,
when they were trying to build a passable road between Nowata and
Coffeyville, we literally drove down a creek bed.
   At that time, it was impossible to get a car from Tulsa to St.
Louis, for there was no road at all over the Ozarks. Citizens of
Springfield, determined to visit relatives in Lebanon or Rolla, took
the Frisco.
   On our second or third trip, Dad did succeed in getting in one
day from Tulsa to Horton, Kan. _ 265 miles. The speed impressed him
so much that he wrote an editorial about it.
   Usually, it took us from seven to nine days to reach Grandma's,
barring a major breakdown. In the meantime, unexpected intelligence
came to us.
   I remember a Lions Club luncheon to which we found ourselves
listening in the hotel dining room at Iola, or was it Yates Center?
Enthusiastic evangelists from Claremore described the therapeutic
effects of ``radium water'' in such technicolor detail _ the
bleeding sores, the running pus _ that we had a short lunch.
   We would finally arrive at the wonderful Victorian house that
Grandpa had ordered built for $4,000, a prodigy of extravagance for
a young lawyer. It is now 125 years old and occupied by a bishop.
   In spite of Dad's clenched teeth and unpredictable explosions, I
think, as I look back on it, that he was a paragon of patience.
   The best, I'm sure, Dad never intended. But by daring to drive
his family to Wisconsin when roads featured dust or gumbo, when
accommodations were chancy or worse, when tires were thin and gear
boxes fragile we all had a look at an America that the city kids
were missing and that would never come again.
   After almost seven decades, our journeys to Grandma's still live
with me. They added much to the wonder of it all.

   Pepsi Cola recently found a buyer for 20 outmoded

   Are the fizzy ``cola wars'' about to be fought on a brand-new
battleground?
   Pepsi recently helped the Soviet Union sell 20 warships. That
puts them 13 more than seven-up on Coca-Cola. Coke has no navy. So
far.
   Has arms dealing opened a new chapter in American business? Will
Avis try harder by leasing tanks? Will Whoppers come with sesame
seed bombs?
   Pepsi Cola entered the arms race _ backward, actually _ by
finding a Norwegian scrap buyer for 17 Soviet submarines. Not the
kind of subs that in Boston come with sandwich meats, lettuce and
dressing. The kind that come with torpedoes.
   Pepsi was also middleman for sale of a Soviet cruiser, destroyer
and frigate, which is not exactly a glass of carbonated nost. It
gives ``down the hatch'' a new meaning for a soft drink guzzler.
   Pepsi scored a Kremlin coup over Coke in 1959 when boss Donald M.
Kendall adroitly cooled off the heated and world-televised
Khrushchev-Nixon ``kitchen debate'' by offering the combatants some
of his cola. Pepsi has had its toe in the Iron Curtain ever since.
   Pepsi now has 21 plants in the Soviet Union. In exchange it helps
Moscow import Stolichnaya vodka into the United States, which gives
parents pain relief from coping with the Pepsi Generation. Call it
fair trade.
   Recently Mikhail Gorbachev decided to sell off for scrap and hard
currency the 20 outmoded warships. It has been reported Pepsi
actually bought them. Nyet. It just found a buyer, for free.
Customer relations. Like taking a client to a ball game.
   Still ...
   Normally the weapons of business success in the United States
have been a better mousetrap or a smart lawyer. There have, however,
been infrequent corporate calls to arms.
   The very Associated Press that brings you this dispatch had its
origins in 1848 partly because packet boats of rival New York papers
hunting the seas for incoming European news began shooting at one
another in an excess of competitive zeal. Damn the torpedoes! (and
the expense) cried Manhattan's many publishers. Let's buy one packet
and pool the news. And the costs.
   One of the most memorable corporate defense forces belonged to
Jim Fisk, unarguably profiled by his biographer as ``an improbable
rascal.''
   Fisk rose from circus hand and Yankee peddler after the Civil War
to become a boardroom buccaneer, great of mirth and girth and a
waxed mustache ``the color of a Jersey cow.''
   When he acquired two steamers that plied between New York and New
England, he ornamented the staterooms with 250 singing canaries and
himself in the dress uniform of a U.S. admiral further embellished
with diamonds that festooned his corpulence.
   Admiral Fisk, who his biographer says couldn't distinguish a
compass from a capstan, later added a land force, New York's
languishing Ninth Regiment. He became its colonel and recruited from
his Grand Opera House where he oversaw both his Erie Railroad, whose
stock he lavishly watered, and the Demon Can-Can girls whom he as
liberally champagned.
   He enlisted the Opera House orchestra as regimental band, which
saluted him by playing ``Hail to the Chief.'' The colonel-admiral
even took the boys with him on bivouac to fashionable Long Branch,
N.J., where maneuvers were described by cynics as ``a monumental
weeklong drunk'' in the command post at the Continental Hotel.
   Fisk's army, alas, could not protect their leader from being
slain by a jealous rival for the pudgy but bejeweled hand of Josie
Mansfield, an aspiring actress delicately said to have bartered
``purity for subsistence.''
   Since Fisk's day, the corporate uniform of the day has quieted
down to dark suits enlivened by a necktie somber enough to be buried
in. Rather than 250 canaries and a regimental orchestra, Pepsi has
only Michael Jackson to sing its praises.
   But Pepsi has struck first in the battleship biz. While it is
helping to recycle old warships, Coke has only its familiar aluminum
cans to send to the smelter. Is there an arms racer on the horizon?
   Kendall reportedly chortled to Brent Scowcroft, the White House
security adviser, that Pepsi is ``disarming the Soviet Union faster
than you are.''
   If that is so and nose-tickling cola turns out to be the missing
key to world peace, Pepsi can boast it started the dove rolling
ahead of Coca-Cola. Somehow Coke is going to have to get into the
peace race, strive for the higher ground.
   Maybe, for starters, make a bid on scrapping the Iron Curtain.

   When social workers in Florida's Pinellas County
realized that homeless people weren't coming to the free medical
clinics, they decided to take a clinic to the people. A Mobile
Medical Team now seeks out people in need of health care, whether
they have the means to pay or not.

   Dr. Geoffrey Greene makes house
calls, but only to people who don't have homes.
   Greene heads a mobile medical team that makes the rounds of
Pinellas County shelters and soup kitchens to bring medicine _ and
hope _ to those down on their health as well as their luck.
   They work out of a $70,000 van set up like a doctor's office.
   ``I was destitute. I got immediate help here and I'm very
grateful,'' says Otis Simone, 53, an out-of-work barber who suffers
from bleeding ulcers and glaucoma.
   ``No one else cared,'' says Jim Daniels as he accompanied his
fiancee, Elizabeth Craps, to the blue-and-white miniclinic parked in
front of St. Vincent dePaul's soup kitchen. She was treated for
anemia and seizures.
   Greene, registered nurse Faith Bennett, social worker Phyllis
Kleckley and secretary-driver Ann Campbell make up the team. Their
workshop includes an exam table, scale, refrigerator for medicines,
cabinet for supplies, telephone, bathroom and a tiny desk with a
folder of files.
   Medical care is free to the homeless in what county officials say
is the only such mobile outreach operation of its kind in the
Southeast.
   ``The concept is to go where the people are,'' Greene says. ``A
lot of these people would have no medical treatment at all if not
for a program like this.''
   They see an estimated 15 patients daily, many with problems
related to alcohol and cocaine abuse. Others come with cuts from
fights or muggings, feet or skin problems, lice, viruses, sometimes
tumors. In kids, the team finds everything from colds to chicken pox.
   The program began last June and is operated by the county's
Department of Social Services under an annual budget of $265,000,
said supervisor Jim Dates.
   ``The only other program I know of that's like it is in New York
City,'' Dates says. ``There aren't a lot of us.''
   The county has two clinics that help the indigent. ``But we felt
very strongly that because the homeless people weren't coming to
them, we had to go out to them,'' Dates says.
   Greene was at the University of South Florida in 1986 doing his
residency in internal medicine when he grew disillusioned.
   ``I felt the emphasis was misplaced,'' he says. ``We need
specialties. But a lot of medical problems we see are treatable and
preventable long before they get to the intensive care stage.''
   When he heard about the program, he applied.
   The Mobile Medical Team also tries to plug in patients to other
assistance programs _ financial, vocational or established medical
clinics if the ailment is long term, such as diabetes.
   Greene had expected to treat mostly middle-aged alcoholics. But
he also found people with drug and mental problems, women with
dependent children on the run from abusive husbands, families who
couldn't make ends meet on unskilled minimum wage jobs and those who
just chose to drop out and live on the edge.
   ``Like everyone, I had misconceptions about the homeless,'' the
doctor says. ``You just don't realize how bad it is until you start
working with it.''
   Dates, who has been involved in social work for nine years, said
families account for the biggest increase in street people.
   ``In 1981-82 you almost didn't see homeless families,'' he says.
``Now, all of a sudden, family shelters are bursting at the seams.
And I don't see any program coming along that's going to get these
people out of the situation they are in.''
   Tanya Freeman, a 40-year-old grandmother, suffers from hearing
impairment, heart disease, epilepsy and shortness of breath. She
first met Greene at a shelter in July after she moved to Florida
from the Bronx in New York City.
   ``I was raped and beaten and they helped me,'' she says. ``I had
no place to go. Now, I'm in school studying electronics. I volunteer
at the soup kitchen. And I'm getting a healthy body back.''
   ``They let me feel comfortable. Ever since I met them my life is
going up, up, up and I refuse to let it go back.''

   Until NBC's ``L.A. Law'' came along, Blair
Underwood wondered if he was destined to play gang leaders the rest
of his career.
   ``I was 22 years old and that's all I was playing,'' Underwood
says. ``I was a street kid on the soap opera `One Life to Live,' a
parolee in the prime-time series `Downtown.'
   ``Then I was cast as attorney Jonathan Rollins in `L.A. Law.'
Young, arrogant, Harvard-educated and black. It's funny. Now all
people see me as a man in a suit and tie.''
   Underwood's character was first conceived as an entertainment
lawyer, but that idea was dropped.
   ``The closest he's gotten to that is defending a ventriloquist,''
he says. ``The ventriloquist had trouble communicating with people
and talked through his dummy. He had attacked a policeman because
the cop had attacked his dummy, which is an extension of himself.
The judge let him go.
   ``I've been doing a lot of courtroom work this year. My character
hasn't had a personal life until the last four episodes. They
brought in a love interest, Renee Jones, who's a law clerk at the
firm. She's new and going through a divorce. The way we ended the
season is that we've decided to become friends and take it slowly.''
   Lawyer Rollins has also taken a few lumps during the past season.
   ``It was a blow to Jonathan's ego when the law firm sent in Jimmy
Smits to help out in a case,'' he says. ``He'd gotten in over his
head. Jimmy told him to calm down. The jury was looking at him like
he was a monster. He'd been bullying witnesses and losing sight of
the case and his client's interests.
   ``The case involved a woman suing a company because the boss
pressured employees to go rock climbing. Her husband had fallen off
and was killed. Jonathan was able to turn himself around and
apologize for getting sidetracked. He ended up winning the case.''
   Underwood, finishing his second year as the cocky lawyer, is
currently playing civil rights worker James Chaney, who with Mickey
Schwerner and Andrew Goodman was murdered near Philadelphia, Miss.,
in 1964.
   The movie, ``Murder in Mississippi,'' tells of the events leading
up to the killings by white supremacists. The aftermath is told in
the theatrical movie ``Mississippi Burning.''
   Underwood was born in Tacoma, Wash., but grew up mostly in
Virginia. His father was an Army officer, so his early years were
also spent in Colorado, Michigan, Kansas and West Germany. He
received his degree in theater arts from Carnegie Mellon University.
   Underwood has set up his own production company to create
projects for himself. His brother, Frank Underwood Jr., a writer, is
putting some of the movies together.
   ``You have to create your own screenplays, to play the kind of
parts you want to play,'' he says. ``We're working on a Western in
which I would play a cowboy. We're also developing a major epic
about Hannibal, the Carthaginian who brought the elephants over the
Alps to attack Rome.''
   Underwood calls ``L.A. Law'' a great comfort zone because it
allows him to say no to projects he doesn't really want to do. He
doesn't have to take them to make a living.
   ``It was different three years ago,'' he says. ``You never know
how your career's going to take off. But it's a good feeling to be
able to say no to things.
   ``There are very few shows that tap into reality involving blacks
like `L.A. Law' or `The Cosby Show.' Writers don't always write for
blacks or write realistically for them. Every black or Hispanic
isn't low income. I wouldn't object to playing a street kid again,
but it would have to be a good role.''
   He has appeared in several feature and television films and on
various TV series in guest star roles. He spent three months on the
soap opera ``One Life To Live'' as street kid Bobby Blue.
   ``I get annoyed when people say I've been lucky,'' Underwood
says. ``There was a lot of hard work and a lot of risk taking.''

   When Debbie Shapiro won a Tony Award for ``Jerome
Robbins' Broadway'' last month, she screamed, parked her chewing gum
with husband Beau Gravitte, ran to the stage of the Lunt-Fontanne
Theater _ and fell apart.
   ``I'm not prepared at all because I didn't want to tempt the
gods,'' she burbled to an enthusiastic audience.
   ``I want to thank Jerry Robbins for letting me be whatever I
am,'' she continued. ``I still haven't figured it out.''
   The Tony may help. Miss Shapiro is blessed with what Broadway
veterans call ``a big voice'' _ the kind of lung power that used to
stop shows when performers rather than elaborate scenery got most of
the applause.
   In ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' a collection of musical numbers
from some of the famed director's biggest hits, Miss Shapiro shares
the stage with more than 60 other singers and dancers. She still
manages to stand out.
   It could be the way she belts her way through ``Ya Got Me'' from
``On the Town'' or her funny, pouty contribution to ``America'' from
``West Side Story'' or her back-breaking trumpet playing in ``You
Gotta Have a Gimmick'' from ``Gypsy.''
   More likely, it's her stunning solo of a little-known Irving
Berlin song, ``Mr. Monotony,'' a number cut from his ``Miss
Liberty'' and ``Call Me Madam,'' and never heard on Broadway until
now.
   She worked on the song for a long time. The extended rehearsal
process for ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' is already legendary. No
other recent musical has had such a painstaking and lengthy period
of auditions, reconstruction of lost dance numbers and rehearsal.
   Miss Shapiro's audition, back in March of last year, lasted two
and a half days. She learned nine songs, including several like
``Dreams Come True'' and ``I Can Cook Too,'' that never made it to
opening night, and two dance numbers.
   ``Jerry was extremely warm,'' she says of the audition. ``The
first day there was a room full of happy people. It was one of those
magical moments. I did four songs, and then I went and learned a
dance and a scene. It was happy, happy, happy.''
   She was told ``Mr. Robbins would like to see you again.''
   But the next day, everyone was ``miserable, miserable,
miserable,'' she recalls. ``Except Jerry.''
   After five more songs, another dance and another scene or two,
the master was satisfied. But it wasn't until May that she knew she
had the role. Her rehearsals began in August, even though the show
didn't open until February.
   Miss Shapiro savors the success of ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,''
which finally fulfills the promise that started more than 20 years
ago in Los Angeles.
   At age 13, Miss Shapiro used to watch her best friend sing and
then say to herself, ``I think I can do that.'' She did her first
show, ``The Pajama Game,'' the following year at a local community
theater and didn't stop.
   ``I was always into theater songs and standards,'' she says. ``I
still am. When I first got to New York, I worked in a Ramada Inn in
Darien, Connecticut, trying to sing pop songs. These people didn't
know what to make of me. Nobody wanted to dance and buy booze. They
just wanted to listen.''
   Miss Shapiro had headed east in 1977 at the suggestion of
choreographer Tony Stevens and musical director Jack Lee who worked
with her in a California production of ``Annie Get Your Gun.'' She
went into ``Spotlight,'' a musical starring Gene Barry, but the
musical died during its Washington tryout.
   ``I had no idea that if you do a Broadway show that it might not
come to New York,'' she says.
   Six months later, she joined the chorus of ``They're Playing Our
Song,'' also understudying star Lucie Arnaz for a year. She left to
go into ``Swing,'' another Broadway-bound show that didn't get past
Washington.
   New Yorkers finally noticed her in ``Perfectly Frank,'' a revue
featuring the songs of Broadway composer Frank Loesser. Although she
stopped the show and earned a love letter from The New York Times
critic, audiences had to look quickly. The show lasted 16
performances.
   But she never thought of leaving New York.
   ``I did have a period of frustration,'' she recalls. ``I had
finished doing a revival of `Zorba' and a lot of stuff where I just
sang. I had a problem with people thinking I couldn't speak. And my
answer to them is `When people sing, it's just talking, but holding
the notes.' That was always upsetting to me.''
   In 1986, she married Gravitte, an actor now in the CBS sitcom
``Doctor, Doctor,'' and went to Los Angeles with him. She got a role
in a short-lived television series, ``Trial and Error.''
   ``I just talked and didn't sing,'' she says. ``It was so easy to
do. I had forgotten when I started doing `Jerome Robbins,' how hard
the theater is.''
   Not only is the show physically demanding, but there is no place
backstage at the Imperial Theater to relax.
   ``There are 120 people running around back there. When I was in
`They're Playing Our Song,' which also was in the Imperial, I was in
the chorus, and I had my own dressing room. Now I'm finally starring
on Broadway, but there are three of us in one room,'' she says.
   Miss Shapiro shares a dressing room with Faith Prince and Susann
Fletcher. Each plays a variety of roles in the show, but all three
are strippers in the ``You Gotta Have a Gimmick'' number.
   ``Susann was not nominated for a Tony, which was somewhat of a
shock, and Faith was. So it was a little bit awkward with Faith and
a little bit awkward with Susann. It was weird, and it could have
been a lot worse. But we were all pretty sane about it in the end.''

   Older Americans will associate Brazilian music
with Carmen Miranda, whose trademark was a headdress that looked
like an overflowing bowl of fruit. Younger ones will recall the
``Girl from Ipanema'' and bossa nova of the early 1960s. Carmen
Miranda and the girl from Ipanema are still a part of Brazilian
music but there's much more to it these days and it has Americans
swaying more than ever to its beat. An AP correspondent who worked
2{ years in Brazil and now is assigned to New York traces the
music's evolution from colonial times to the present.

   Brazil's melodious blend of African, Portuguese and native Indian
rhythms is seducing American ears, and pop stars such as David
Byrne, Paul Simon and Sting, noted for discovering new sounds, are
looking southward.
   But hard to capture in the Brazilian-inspired American tunes and
the compilations are the cultural and political roots of Brazilian
music, which stretches from throbbing samba to the softer bossa
nova. Some of Brazil's top singer-composers were jailed or exiled
for their allegorical ballads during the 21-year military
dictatorship that ended in 1985.
   Three months ago, Byrne of the U.S. rock group The Talking Heads
released an anthology of Brazilian music from the 1970s, ``Beleza
Tropical,'' which has sold 100,000 copies. He is putting together
two others: a compilation of carnival samba and another of swinging,
syncopated ``forro'' from Brazil's northeast.
   Byrne and Simon have made pilgrimages to the northeast state of
Bahia, the source of Brazilian-African rhythms. Sting has traveled
in the Brazilian Amazon region studying Indian music and ceremonies.
   Brazilian singers Caetano Veloso and Djavan have made names for
themselves in the United States and recently recorded new albums on
American labels. Milton Nascimento, Gal Costa and Hermeto Paschoal
have just completed U.S. tours to wide critical acclaim.
Singer-songwriter Gilberto Gil began a U.S. tour in late June.
   Record producer Quincy Jones recently described the new interest
in the music of Brazil as ``the second wave.'' The first was bossa
nova, which saxophonist Stan Getz helped bring to the United States
in his jazz samba records of the early 1960s.
   Byrne said he sees a new openness among the American
``thirtysomething'' generation to foreign sounds and lyrics that
aren't necessarily in English.
   ``They're not very interested in Guns and Roses or Michael
Jackson, and there's little else,'' Byrne said, referring to the
heavy rock band and U.S. light pop star. ``They like things that
seem genuine, not a contrived commodity.''
   Larry Gold of the New York nightclub Sounds of Brazil agrees. He
said since the barriers fell between black rap and Carribean sound
and what was considered ``white'' music, the American public has
opened to regional sounds. Ticket sales at his 300-seat club are up
30 percent over last year, he said.
   Though some fear the new interest in Brazilian music will lead to
a more generic, international sound in Brazil, Gilberto Gil
disagrees.
   ``I think the new curiosity will bring out more of the
complexities and contradictions in the music,'' he said.
   Brazil, a mixed-race nation of 141 million, was colonized by the
Portuguese and now has 55 million people of African descent; about
220,000 native Indians live mostly in remote Amazon regions.
   ``The music reflects Brazil,'' said Morton Marx, an American
musicologist who has studied Brazilian music.
   Much of Brazilian music has been characterized as swing, and its
``lightness'' is often confused with American easy-listening music.
But as Byrne points out, many of Brazil's top singer-composers went
to jail or were sent into exile for their work.
   ``It's melodious yet there's a sense of depth,'' Byrne said.
``It's very innovative and there's an acceptance of anything. It
reinforces the basic notion of throwing out the rule book.''
   Beyond the melody, much of Brazilian pop integrates the
rudimentary percussion instruments used in Afro-Brazilian spirit
cults such as wooden drums known as ``atabaques,'' a three-bell
instrument called an ``agogo'' and something similar to maraca
rattles used by cha-cha bands.
   At the same time, the harmonic tones of Milton Nascimento and
free-wheeling improvisation of instrumentalists such as Hermeto
Pascoal long have inspired jazz musicians Pat Metheney and Miles
Davis among others.
   The melange of peoples, economic hardship and a history of
government repression in Brazil have created the innovations in
structure, lyrics and arrangements of its music.
   In coastal Bahia, the rhythms are heavily African, brought by the
3.6 million slaves who came from western Africa to work on the
sugar, cotton and coffee plantations and later to mine for gold and
diamonds. In Brazil, slavery spanned three centuries from the 1500s
through abolition in 1888.

   In the northeastern interior _ where the cattle ranges were vast
and there was less need for slave labor _ the music, forro, is of
European descent, brought by the Portuguese owners. The accordion is
central to the swinging, improvisational style that is now the
principal musical form of the northeastern poor. Their dance is
similar to a Quadrille, a square dance of French origin.
   But it is perhaps black African culture that has survived in its
purest form in the vast nation.
   The Portuguese crown encouraged plantation owners to keep
together slaves from the same tribes, hoping this would prevent a
larger binding of blacks. As a result, tribes were able to preserve
their own rituals, religions, dance and music.
   Some of Brazil's best-known and most creative singers and
musicians are from Bahia, including Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil and
bossa nova great Joao Gilberto, among many others.
   In Rio de Janeiro, samba, the music of the urban poor, is rooted
in the rhythmic drumming and dances used in African spirit religions
such as Candomble. Samba, like the African religions, once was
repressed as backward.
   But in the 1930s and 1940s President Getulio Vargas promoted
nationalist sentiment to compliment state-led industrial growth. He
encouraged samba as uniquely Brazilian and promoted carnival
parades, which began to feature themes in Brazilian history.
   White middle-class Brazilians traditionally looked to the United
States and Europe for their music.
   It wasn't until the late 1950s and early 1960s that samba stepped
from the hillside slums and toward the musical mainstream with bossa
nova.
   Antonio Carlos Jobim, Vinicius de Moraes and Joao Gilberto
combined a slow, soft samba with jazz tones and relied heavily on
strings and piano. Such songs as ``The Girl From Ipanema'' and
``Dindi'' hit the international scene.
   But only in the 1960s _ when Brazil staggered under a military
government that seized power in 1964 _ was samba firmly incorporated
into the musical mainstream.
   The country looked for a form of popular expression and turned to
protest singers such as Chico Buarque de Hollanda, Veloso and Gil,
who wrote allegorical lyrics on political themes in an effort to to
get around censorship. They also picked up the songs of traditional
samba composers such as Noel Rosa and Jorge Ben.
   The music itself became a political statement. It integrated
samba and native Indian wind pipes and rattles to illustrate an
acceptance of Brazil's African and Indian origins.
   Samba, which had been popular just once a year at carnival, was
showcased year round.
   Many singer-composers such as Veloso and Gil were imprisoned then
forced into exile.
   The years 1967-68 saw the flowering of ``Tropicalismo,'' led
principally by Gil and Veloso, who incorporated international
instruments such as electric guitars into the new national music.
   Today, the music almost universally reflects disillusion with
Brazil's civilian government that most feel has not responded
effectively to the poverty in which 60 percent of the population
lives, or to the effects on the masses of the nation's $115 billion
foreign debt, inherited from 21 years of military rule.
   New albums by Buarque de Hollanda, Veloso and Nascimento _ who
have remained at the forefront of the musical scene _ capture that
pessimistic spirit.
   In the album ``In Yauarete,'' released last year on a CBS label,
the lyrics of Nascimento's ``Carta a Republica'' (Letter to the
Republic) perhaps best illustrates the deception:
   ``Yes it's true life is freer and fear no longer lives in homes,
in bars, in streets. But I can't hide a bitterness at seeing the
dream slip backward.''
   The end of the military government saw the rise of a new
generation of directly political and angry Brazilian rock musicians.
   Singers such as Pepeu Gomes, Lobao, Palaramas do Successo, Legiao
Urbana and Cazuza sing about contemporary ills _ pollution, AIDS and
destruction of the Brazilian rain forests.
   Cazuza, who is dying of AIDS, describes his guitar as a ``machine
gun of resentment.''

   Across Asia these days, a U.S. college education has
become a ticket to the top.
   National leaders with American college or university degrees
include President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines, President Lee
Teng-hui of Taiwan and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan.
   They also include Rene Saquisaq, a U.S. student in the 1960s, who
turned down a high-paying job in law and now is the poorest but most
popular member of the Philippines Senate because of his activism;
and Satyen G. Pitroda, an Indian electronics engineer who sold off a
multimillion-dollar electronics company in the United States to
return home to help Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi modernize India's
telecommunications system for a government salary of one rupee (6
cents) a year.
   Asian students who stay in the United States after graduation are
recognized as helping to keep American standards up in science and
technology, fields especially favored by students from China and
India.
   Many more of Asia's brightest are in the U.S.-bound pipeline.
   The new wealth of many Asian countries enables governments and
parents to pay the fast-rising tuition, room and board at American
universities _ approaching $20,000 a year for Ivy League and similar
schools _ and at the same time add significantly to the revenues of
the American institutions.
   Asians are drawn to American campuses partly by the availability
of places, partly by growing consciousness of membership in the
Pacific Rim community, partly by admiration for the U.S. higher
education system.
   Atsuko Matsumoto, 24, said she hadn't been forced to study hard
for her degree at Yokohama City College and hoped for more
stimulation in an advanced American business course. She already has
been to an intensive English course at Spring Hill College in
Mobile, Ala.
   ``I heard that American university students study very hard, so I
think it's good to go to school there,'' Ms. Matsumoto said,
thumbing through university catalogs in the office of the
Japan-United States Educational Commission.
   The office's library was jammed with young Japanese exploring
course listings or paying 1,000 yen (about $7) for a 90-page
handbook on how to get ready for an American university education.
   It's a scene mirrored many places in Asia as youth in the heavily
populated arc from Pakistan to China plan their schooling. Some
intend to return home after U.S. study. Some stay in the United
States for high-paying jobs or research that cannot be done at home.
Others seek to leave behind forever the deprivation or oppression or
political uncertainty in their homelands.
   Soon after the dust settled in Beijing following the massacre of
pro-democracy demonstrators, young people braved watchful police and
lined up at U.S. consulates in Chinese cities to apply for student
visas.
   They face many barriers, especially if they need the government
financing that is given to 35,000 of the 80,000 Chinese studying
abroad this year.
   Most Chinese who are permitted to study abroad have to pass
competitive tests. Also important are family connections _ relations
in China who will ensure the student's eventual return _ and being
``ideologically and morally sound,'' in the words of rules issued in
1987.
   Despite such barriers, China had more students in the United
States than any other country this year, an estimated 40,000.
   One is Jiang Mian, the son of China's new Community Party leader,
Jiang Zemin. He is completing work on a doctorate in electrical and
computer engineering at Drexel University in Philadelphia, where he
has studied since 1986 and lives in a modest brick row house near
the campus. He declined to discuss his future with an AP reporter in
Philadelphia in late June.
   The Chinese government gives financial support mostly to graduate
students in engineering and business. Returned students play a major
role in advanced study within China, accounting for 30 percent to 50
percent of the teachers of postgraduate courses, said Yu Fuzeng,
director of the State Education Commission's Foreign Affairs Bureau
in Beijing.
   In the 1987-88 school year, Asian students numbered 180,500, or
50.7 percent of all foreign students in the United States, compared
with 28.6 percent in 1979-80, according to statistics in a
newsletter of the National Association for Foreign Student Affairs.
   The academic year 1987-88 was the first in which Asians were the
majority of foreign students, and Asian countries held eight of the
first 10 places in the ranking of nations with the most students in
U.S. colleges.
   William K. Cummings, director of the Office of International
Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, wrote in the
newsletter that ``one can reasonably anticipate continuing expansion
of the Asian appetite for overseas study.''
   Many more may be from South Korea, which liberalized overseas
travel in January and now permits anyone to apply for a passport.
The Foreign Ministry in Seoul reports issuing 27,000 passports to
students this year, 132 percent more than last year.

   Satyen G. Pitroda was an Indian village
boy who had never used a telephone when at the age of 21 he went off
for a U.S. education.
   Twenty-two years later, after acquiring a degree in electronics
at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, a
multimillion-dollar bank account, 50 international patents on
digital switching systems and the American nickname ``Sam,'' he came
home to try to revolutionize India's telecommunications system.
   Pitroda gave up the U.S. citizenship he had acquired and an
annual income of $550,000 when he returned to India in 1986 and
offered to work for the government for one rupee (6 cents) a year.
   Today he is Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's technology adviser and
holds the rank of minister of state.
   ``After 40 you don't get trapped in making money. You don't have
to worry about survival,'' said Pitroda, who retained major U.S.
shareholdings after selling his Chicago-based digital switching
company for $50 million.
   His main job now is to add 27 million telephone lines to the
existing 3 million connections in this nation of 880 million people
by the year 2000 and to integrate overall telecom development with
other national modernization programs.
   Gandhi entrusted him with other prime programs, safer drinking
water, eradication of illiteracy, immunization of children, dairy
development and cooking oil production.
   ``I would like to describe myself as a bit of a manager, a part
entrepreneur, a good telecom engineer and a committed worker,'' said
the 46-year-old Pitroda.
   The son of a carpenter, Pitroda was graduated from Maharajah
Sayajirao University in the western town of Baroda in 1964 with a
degree in physics. The university had telephones but Pitroda said he
never had the need to use one.
   He enrolled at the Illinois Institute of Technology and got a
master's degree in electronics in 1966.
   After working for other people, Pitroda set up a digital
switching company that in eight years commanded annual sales of $100
million.
   ``I really don't know why I went to the U.S.,'' Pitroda said. ``I
also don't know why I came back. But it has been immensely
satisfying. I don't think I'll go back to the U.S., although my two
kids miss it terribly.''

<TEXT>
   The Nationalist Chinese government and
party hierarchy have a distinct U.S. background and this has been
reflected in the more liberal policies of President Lee Teng-hui's
administration.
   Lee, 66, who is also chairman of the Nationalist Party, was
educated at Iowa State University at Ames and Cornell University in
Ithaca, N.Y., and 17 of the 25 members of his Cabinet studied in the
United States.
   Observers say time spent in the United States has made Taiwan's
new leaders more pragmatic and liberal than the older generation of
Nationalist leaders who fled to Taiwan in 1949 when they lost a
civil war to the Communists on the Chinese mainland.
   One of the new leaders regarded as the brightest is James Soong,
47, secretary general of the party, No. 2 behind Lee.
   Soong was educated at the University of California at Berkeley
and Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., before
earning a doctorate in political science from Georgetown University
in the U.S. capital.
   ``His U.S. education has made him bold to make reforms while most
bureaucrats merely followed old practices to avoid backlashes from
changes,'' said Kan Yu-lung, chairman of the China Daily News. Kan
spent five years as deputy to Soong when the latter was director of
the Government Information Office, which controls the media in
Taiwan.
   Insiders say Soong, when he was the party's deputy secretary
general in 1987, encouraged Lee's predecessor, Chiang Ching-kuo, to
end 38 years of martial law and allow Taiwanese and mainland Chinese
to exchange visits.
   Last year, after Chiang died, Soong risked his political career
by rebuking the party's old guard for their reluctance to support
Lee, Chiang's hand-picked successor, as chairman of the Nationalist
Party. The party, in the end, made Lee chairman.
   Soong, son of a Nationalist general, has shunned interviews and
maintained a low profile, but this had not hurt his popularity. He
also has won over party elders.
   ``He is a man of vitality who still retains many traditional
Chinese virtues such as modesty and respect to elders,'' said Kan.

<HEAD>At The Movies: `Weekend at Bernie's'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Film opens July 5.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Can dead bodies be funny? Alfred Hitchcock thought so, and in
1955 he made a minor classic, ``The Trouble With Harry,'' Harry
being a murdered man nobody could get rid of.
   One of the most side-splitting sequences of TV's ``Fawlty
Towers'' concerned John Cleese's attempt to hide a guest who had
checked out _ mortally _ at the hotel.
   Comedy corpses had less success in Blake Edward's ``S.O.B.,''
with Richard Mulligan as the errant cadaver, and ``W.C. Fields and
Me,'' in which Fields and friends took the deceased John Barrymore
on a last tour of nightclubs (it supposedly happened).
   Now comes ``Weekend at Bernie's'' to prove that yes, stiffs can
be hilarious. Credit goes to the feathery direction of Ted Kotcheff
(``Fun With Dick and Jane''), a wildly improbable script by Robert
Klane (``Where's Poppa''), and the razor-sharp work of two young
farceurs, Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman.
   McCarthy and Silverman are ambitious young employees at a
Manhattan insurance company. While preparing a moneymaking venture
for the firm, they uncover evidence of a complicated fraud scheme.
   When the pair present their boss, Bernie, with the discovery, he
suggests they join him for Labor Day weekend at his pleasure palace
at the Hamptons on Long Island. What they don't know is that Bernie
has been running the scam with the help of the Mafia.
   McCarthy and Silverman arrive at Bernie's and find him dead,
plugged by a hit man with pride in his job. To save themselves, the
two must make it appear that Bernie is still alive and well. They
somehow accomplish this at parties, on streets and in boats.
   That's about it, except for a romantic sideplot with Silverman
and Catherine Mary Stewart, the office beauty. But the interplay
between the two young men and their late boss is enough to keep one
helplessly laughing.
   What keeps ``Weekend at Bernie's'' from being a perfect comedy
such as ``Big'' is the sketchy characterization of the two leads.
McCarthy is an overbearing slob, and Silverman is so timid he can't
ask the gorgeous Stewart for a date. Both actors flawlessly handle
the comedy; too bad their roles weren't better defined.
   Special credit must go to Terry Kiser as Bernie. Playing dead
through most of a feature movie is no joke, and he admirably meets
the challenge.
   Victor Drai produced the 20th Century Fox release for Gladden
Entertainment. The rating is PG-13 with some swearing and much
macabre humor. Running time: 100 minutes.

   ``The Cocoanuts'' (MCA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $19.95)
   
   Dare we call a film starring the Marx Brothers, with music and
lyrics by Irving Berlin, and with a book by George S. Kaufman, a
bore?
   We dare.
   The movie in question is ``The Cocoanuts,'' made in the infancy
of the talk era.
   Now, to the balance sheet:
   No film with Groucho Marx could be all bad. Groucho, who plays
the proprietor of the ``Hotel de Cocoanut,'' has an absolute
monopoly on the funny moments in this spoof of the 1920s Florida
land boom.
   He and Chico do their classic ``Why a duck?'' bit. And as usual,
Groucho labors tirelessly and hilariously for the affections of
Margaret Dumont, the rich and available heiress in practically every
Marx Brothers film.
   ``You wouldn't love me if I was poor,'' she protests.
   ``I might, but I'd keep my mouth shut,'' replies Groucho.
   It's also kind of fun to see the flapper costumes the women wore.
And Hollywood historians can probably find all sorts of interest in
how paralyzed cameramen and sound crews were at that time.
   But beware _ of the long, long, long, long music and dancing
interludes. Every Marx Brothers film featured musical bits by Chico
and Harpo, as well as several songs by an annoying tenor _ facts
that Groucho himself often bemoaned.
   In ``The Cocoanuts,'' the long-forgotten Oscar Shaw, the
ostensible ``love interest,'' sings and acts so ridiculously and
badly that you will reach for your fast-forward button. It hardly
seems possible to make Berlin tunes sound rotten, but Shaw does it.
   The choreography is unwatchable, a kind of dopey callisthenics
rather than dancing, and not very strenuous at that.
   This is definitely not a Marx Brothers picture to create new fans
for the boys. Repeated viewing could even lose some old ones. Made
in 1929 in living black and white.

   ``Talk Radio'' (MCA Home Video. VHS-BETA, $89.95. Rated R)
   
   ``Talk Radio,'' Eric Bogosian's dialogue with the depraved and
the depressed as a talk show host, is one hour and 40 minutes of
compelling chatter.
   He roves out loud through the ravages of his own twisted
consciousness, and the net effect leaves one feeling like he or she
has scaled the Tower of Babel.
   ``Talk Radio'' is Oliver Stone's adaptation of Bogosian's one-act
play of the same title about a provocative radio personality. It
also is based in part on the story of radio talk show host Alan
Berg, who was killed in 1984 by white supremacists.
   Bogosian goads his racist callers, ridicules his fans and offers
a sympathetic ear to the truly troubled. His monologues build a
frenetic pitch of words, then stall for a gasp, and then begin all
over again.
   The talk show format is anything goes, so long as what's going is
controversial. A rapist calls to beg for help and describe his last
attack. Anti-Semites reel off strings of Jew-hating epithets.
Paranoids detail their convoluted fears, including one woman who is
obsessed with what she'll find at the bottom of her garbage disposal.
   Much of movie itself, in fact, resembles the verbal equivalent of
that goo and grime languishing in the dank crevices of a garbage
disposal. It's humanity at its worst, which leads Bogosian to
wistfully conclude, ``I guess we're stuck with each other.''
   It's riveting for a while, as voyeuristic thrills go, but after
the din dies the final sensation is exhaustion. That, and an intense
desire to shower off all that scum.

<HEAD>Star Watch: From Band Singer to Billionaire</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Merv Griffin made $250 million in
one week.
   Coca-Cola offered to buy his production company, and paid $250
million. In seven days, he became a Great American Fortune _ ``for
me and, I'm sure, for great-great-great grandchildren _ if I don't
blow the whole thing.''
   Griffin's transformation from band singer to talk show host to
billionaire is one of the remarkable stories of show business. It
amazes him, too. The latest phase, he admits, is all due to a few TV
game shows he concocted _ ``Wheel of Fortune'' and ``Jeopardy.''
Those were the prizes for which Coca-Cola paid all that money.
   Even with an empire that includes film and television companies,
the Beverly Hilton Hotel, resorts and casinos in the Bahamas and
Atlantic City and four radio stations, Griffin still yearns to sing
with a band. He was to do just that over the Fourth of July weekend
at his Resorts International in Atlantic City.
   ``You know something?'' he muses. ``Exactly 40 years ago I played
the Atlantic City Steel Pier with Freddy Martin's band. We appeared
before 150,000 people over the July 4th weekend.
   ``How much was I getting? Let's see, I started with Freddy at
$125, then got a raise to $150. When I had a hit record with `I've
Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts,' he raised me to $200.''
   Griffin, 64, talked about a variety of matters during a lunch at
his regular table in Mr. H's, the Beverly Hilton restaurant. He is a
bit stouter than in his talk-show days (``it's a constant battle''),
but he spoke just as ebulliently as when he was questioning authors
about their new self-help books.
   He gazed with pride at the swimming pool area that had once
looked like a motel with its all-weather carpet. Now it resembled an
oasis with lush greenery. Griffin also was adding a small forest on
the Wilshire Boulevard frontage, and everywhere in the hotel signs
of change could be seen.
   ``I have the most valuable property in Beverly Hills, nine acres
in the best location,'' he said. ``I had an offer two weeks ago from
the Japanese. I said, `No, thanks, I haven't finished it yet.' ''
   ``The Merv Griffin Show'' went off the air in 1986 after 23
years, and he devoted his attention to his busy production company.
Then the Coca-Cola buyout provided a shower of cash that was almost,
but not quite, embarrassing.
   ``I called Arthur Laffer, who was largely responsible for Mr.
Reagan's economic program,'' Griffin said. ``Arthur told me, `Spread
it around, Merv. Some in Treasury bonds, a little in the stock
market, a little in this.' He sent a lot of people to me, and I
chose the ones I liked.
   ``I did all that, and I was never so bored in my life. First of
all, they don't come and pile (the money) on a desk so you don't
know you got it. They call and say they wired it to your bank. They
wired my bank and the computer broke down. Then they roll it over,
and you get interest statements and all that.
   ``I said, `I'm not going to sit and do this for the rest of my
life.' That's when Barron Hilton said, `Merv, do you wanna buy the
Beverly Hilton?' I couldn't believe it.
   ``I had a little tussle with the Japanese. They topped my offer
by a lot, but then they had their Black Monday the same time we did.
So they pulled out, and I went back with my original offer ($102
million).''
   Then came the battle with Donald Trump over possession of Resorts
International. In the end they settled the dispute with Griffin
getting most of Resorts except for the unfinished Taj Mahal in
Atlantic City.
   Griffin, who doesn't seem to get mad at anybody, has mellowed in
his relationship to Trump.
   ``We're not buddies; we don't talk on the phone every day,'' said
Griffin. ``We speak through our representatives, but we get along
fine. His goals are a bit different from mine. He's a young man, and
he must constantly let the crowd out there perceive that he has won
on everything. He's only here on Earth to win.
   ``That's OK, because that's the business he's in. I am not in
that same business. I buy what I enjoy.''
   Griffin reported gleefully that he and Trump will join in a
mutual enterprise: as judges in the Miss America pageant _ ``we'll
both vote for each other.''
   The golden touch of Merv Griffin will soon fall on another TV
game show based on Monopoly, the venerable board game that uses
street and place names of Atlantic City. Pilot programs have been
produced under his supervision.
   ``It's so funny,'' he said. ``On the show we move these little
red houses around on Boardwalk and North Carolina and Connecticut
Avenue. In real life I own them anyway.''

   The light playing off the glass entryway to the new
National Gallery of Canada was dazzling as photographer Yousuf Karsh
arrived for his first glimpse of the largest retrospective ever
prepared of his work.
   ``No two mornings are alike,'' the 80-year-old photographer
observed.
   Given the choice of taking an elevator or walking up the ramp
full of light and shadow, Karsh started walking without hesitation.
   This, after all, is a man who describes his craft with such words
as dedication, curiosity, responsibility and challenge, then adds
that none of it should be evident.
   ``The human face is the great challenge in the world,'' Karsh
said, conducting the interview as he toured the gallery. ``I never
tire of it _ and everyone is different.''
   He described his recent trip to photograph Pakistani Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto as enthusiastically as his recollections of
getting Winston Churchill to pose in 1941.
   ``It's still to date my greatest diplomatic triumph,'' Karsh said
of the session nearly half a century ago that ended up on the cover
of Life magazine and clinched his reputation.
   The photo of a defiant Churchill ``appealed to the whole world,''
he said. ``It caught all the bulldog determination of the British
Empire. ... It was done without premeditation but with great
admiration and respect.''
   The portraits of the rich, talented, powerful and famous
certainly are the most prominent among the 198 photographs on
display at the National Gallery's main exhibition space through
September, but the retrospective shows that Karsh has other
interests as well.
   ``This is a very tender picture,'' he said, stopping at a
photograph for a commissioned ``Faces of Canada'' series taken at a
hospital in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1952. ``She was just a sick lady,
but look at the serenity of that face.''
   Karsh said the idea that he only photographed celebrities ``is
totally wrong, because I have photographed the people who are less
famous for all of my life.''
   Closest to the entrance to the exhibit are photos taken for
muscular dystrophy fund-raising campaigns, a special interest of
recent years and virtually the only ones he has taken not on
assignment or commission.
   The retrospective at the year-old National Gallery takes on
additional significance because it is just blocks away from Karsh's
studio in Ottawa's landmark Chateau Laurier hotel.
   The studio features Karsh trademark photos in its foyer _ the
writer Ernest Hemingway, Churchill, the artist Georgia O'Keeffe and
cellist Pablo Casals.
   The photographer described his living situation as ideal, being
able to maintain a home in peaceful Ottawa while traveling the world
on his assignments.
   Karsh is from an Armenian family that fled Turkey in 1922. He
came to Canada two years later, where he joined an uncle who was a
photographer. Although Karsh originally planned to become a doctor,
by 1932 he had opened his first Ottawa photography studio.
   His training was to photograph using available light, but
involvement with the Ottawa Little Theater taught him to use studio
lighting to create a mood. As a result, the lighting is often
dramatic in his photographs.
   He said he preferred to photograph his subjects as much as
possible in their own environment.
   ``The question is to know as much about the people as possible,
to do your homework in advance and to listen,'' he said. ``You have
to have true understanding of the subject you photograph.''
   Karsh's advice also is to be a student of the humanities, to
learn about history, music, art and travel. ``All this allows you to
be a more sensitive recorder of what you are doing,'' he said.
   The actual moment of taking a photograph, he said, ``becomes
intuitive more than anything else. You don't have time to analyze.''
   As he sat at the exhibition before his portraits of a young Fidel
Castro and author Vladimir Nabokov to have his own picture taken,
Karsh asked to be involved in conversation, to be provoked, so that
more action and expression could be captured.
   The Cuban president, he said, is ``never tiresome.'' Nabokov was
``a beautiful, sensitive, colorful writer, but as a human being he's
not my number one choice.''
   Karsh's wife, Estrellita, travels with him and had memories of
her own on seeing the photographs hanging at the National Gallery.
Artist Man Ray was ``so wonderful''; the artist Joan Miro gradually
relaxed as he sat in the Paris studio where he did lithographs, and
the manifestations of a famous artist faded into the kindly man seen
in his portrait.
   Estrellita Karsh stopped for a moment in front of the 1946
photograph of a young, spectacularly beautiful Ingrid Bergman.
   ``Was she that gorgeous, Yousof?'' she asked. ``Jeepers.''
   ``Yes, she was,'' Karsh quietly replied about the late actress.

   Chris Isaak's dark and dreamlike music has
long been a hit with audiences in the San Francisco area, but
national fame and a spot on the pop charts have eluded him.
   A hit single would be swell, says the 32-year-old singer and
songwriter, but it's not the most important thing.
   ``I like to sing. If I had a hit, that'd be great,'' Isaak says.
``I'd be really overjoyed to have a hit _ tickled pink. But I'm not
worried about that. I'm more worried about just keeping my job.''
   Maybe he's not a household word, but Isaak has a solid reputation
as someone who borrows the best from country-western and rock 'n'
roll to produce an original sound.
   His newly released album, ``Heart Shaped World,'' is more upbeat
than earlier efforts and possibly his best. Guitarist James Wilsey
adds a polished, heavily tremoloed background to Isaak's
velvety-soft vocals.
   Wilsey is largely responsible for the sound that has grabbed the
attention of critics. He has a sharp ear for what works with Isaak's
lyrics, but he says a sophisticated computer system is partly
responsible for the sound he achieves on stage.
   This is the band's third album since 1985, and the third time
observers have said Isaak is teetering on the edge of national
acclaim.
   But the man often compared to Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley, two
of his many idols, has a hard time being serious when describing the
new album.
   ``This is pretty much me singing a bunch of songs I wrote _ just
like the first two albums,'' he said. ``If you liked the first two
albums, this is pretty much the same route. If you didn't like the
first two albums, this is all different.''
   If Isaak in person was like the Isaak in his music, one would
probably meet a somewhat somber person dressed in black. His songs
often speak of lost, or nearly lost, love. One imagines the
songwriter sitting in an unlighted room peering out a window at a
grimy, pre-dawn city street.
   But the in-person Isaak is a regular cut-up. The Stockton,
Calif., native talks with a slightly goofy rural California accent _
which disappears when he sings _ and gets a kick out of telling
stories, like the one about how he learned to play guitar by
sneaking into his older brother's room.
   Nick Isaak had told his younger brother to stay away from his
prized instrument.
   ``Every day, it was forbidden. But he'd go to school and I'd play
his guitar. I'd put it back exactly where it belonged,'' the singer
said. ``One day, I was sitting there watching TV _ I had put the
guitar back _ and the string just popped. They'll do that sometimes.
I heard it go BRRROOOIING. I thought, `I'd been playing it. But I
wasn't playing it right now.'
   ``He worked me over pretty good for that one.''
   Then there's the one about how he acquired his first guitar, the
Silvertone he's played on all three albums and the inspiration for
his first band's name. He'd been eyeballing it every day as he
walked by a local pawnshop. Finally, he asked his brother for help.
   ``My brother was better at arguing on prices, so I said, `Why
don't you go see if you can get a deal.' So he called the fire
department and told them the pawn shop was a fire hazard, so they
had to get rid of a bunch of stuff.''
   He bought the guitar for $80.
   ``We didn't like the people at that pawn shop, anyway. They'd
sold my mother a single guitar string for $4,'' Isaak said.
   Fans are familiar with Isaak's brand of humor. He often
introduces songs with long whimsical tales involving members of the
band. He drives a 1964 Nova. At a recent record release party at the
Fairmont Hotel, he showed up in a floral-patterned suit made from
window drapes.
   And for some undisclosed reason, Isaak thinks Tikis are neat. He
keeps dozens of the Polynesian idols, big and small, on his dining
room table and in his kitchen. He even owns a painting of a Tiki, an
awful thing that looks like it might have been drawn under the
influence of mescaline.
   But the zaniness doesn't carry over into the music.
   Isaak has always thought of his style as country-western.
However, numerous influences are apparent, including rockabilly and
rhythm and blues.
   ``I try not to make things that are too angry-sounding,'' he
said. ``It makes me nervous when I hear music that is just people
banging away. If I listen to it, it's got to be pretty, like Bing
Crosby.''
   ``I don't like people who can't sing but say, `I'll make records
despite that fact.'''
   Critics often speak of the dark side of Isaak's music. One deejay
in Washington dubbed him the ``Baron of Brood,'' and singles such as
``You Owe Me Some Kind of Love,'' off his second LP, and ``Wicked
Ways'' off the new album exemplify that lonelier side.
   As a young man living in Stockton, a place he describes as
``Fresno without all the glitter,'' Isaak attended the University of
Pacific and took up boxing. But like early ideas of being a
filmmaker, the boxing career petered out. He went to Japan as a
transfer student, and spent much of his time singing and playing the
guitar.
   Isaak came to San Francisco in 1980 and later hooked up with Erik
Jacobsen, who produced his albums and eventually became his manager.
Until he met Wilsey, Isaak was the lead guitarist in his band.
   ``Jimmy and I met in 1982. I had a three-piece band and he said,
`Hey let me in, I can play guitar better than that.''
   Wilsey, who started out running the sound system for Isaak's
first band, said he was immediately taken with the budding singer.
   ``I realized he was the funniest person I'd ever met. It was nice
to hang around him and laugh when other things seemed depressing,''
Wilsey said.
   Aside from the music, Isaak has enjoyed a successful sideline
career as a film actor. He's appeared in two episodes of the TV show
``Private Eye'' and had a cameo in Jonathan Demme's ``Married to the
Mob.''

<TEXT>
   As a columnist for The New York Times and a
Pulitzer Prize-winning author, Russell Baker has settled into a
comfortable way of life.
   No more cruising the streets of Baltimore in search of crime
stories; no coronations to cover; no waiting in the halls of
Congress for politicians to lie to him.
   He and his wife, Mimi, have a home of their own now in Leesburg,
Va., just what his mother dreamed of when she raised him during the
Great Depression. Baker has stuck with journalism for more than 40
years, always remembering his mother's advice to never be a quitter,
to make something of himself.
   But he still has some unfinished business. ``Growing Up,'' the
best-selling account of his childhood, ended in the late 1940s with
his marraige and his early days with The Baltimore Sun.
   In a summer of sequels on the big screen, Baker continues his
life story with ``The Good Times'' ($19.95, Morrow).
   ``This book was inevitable after `Growing Up,''' he said. ``I was
amazed at the mail I had received and still receive. So many people
led the same life.
   ``Memoirs are by famous men and cast light on great events. These
are more letters to my family.''
   Baker was just another rewrite man and police reporter at the
Sun, horrified at the hopeless poverty he had witnessed in the slums
of Baltimore, when ``Buck'' Dorsey, the managing editor, phoned and
invited him to lunch at the posh Chesapeake restaurant.
   After several martinis, Dorsey stunned his young employee by
offering the assignment of London bureau chief.
   ``I really don't know why he did it,'' Baker said. ``I've got
some guesses, just guesses. Buck was a gambling man. ... All real
Baltimoreans are gamblers. He picked me out as somebody to bet on.
He was sort of running me, testing his eye.
   ``The London experience changed my life. It gave me an education,
humanized me, exposed me to theater, ballet and music. A few weeks
earlier, I had been writing stories about purse snatching, now I'm
covering Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden, being briefed by John
Foster Dulles.''
   ``The Good Times'' is a book of turning points, a chronicle of
unexpected breaks. Baker puts himself back in the mind of the
ordinary man astonished at his own good fortune.
   ``I wanted to get inside the skin of how events are happening at
the time. If I wrote it as an essay now, as an old granddad looking
back, it wouldn't be the same. I wanted to convey the sense of what
was going on as a youngster.
   ``I was like somebody thrown into swirling water. I was just
swimming. I didn't have any sense of going any place. I was
learning, and it was fascinating.''
   After returning to the United States in 1954, Baker was hired by
The New York Times and served as a correspondent in Washington.
   Unlike his colleagues, however, he didn't concern himself with
the differences between Democrats and Republicans. Instead, he
studied personalities and was fascinated by Lyndon Johnson, then the
Senate's powerful majority leader.
   ``He was a million things. It was like peeling an onion. He could
tell you a story and reduce himself to tears, then he could turn on
you with a snarl. He was one of the great mysteries,'' Baker said.
   ``Of all the politicians I covered, he was the one character that
would have interested Shakespeare. Sometimes he's like King Lear,
then he's like Macbeth, then he's a buffoon like Falstaff.''
   Baker also found himself oddly attracted to Richard Nixon, then
vice president under President Eisenhower. Like Baker, the gloomy,
awkward Nixon grew up poor and struggled to advance himself.
   ``(John F.) Kennedy was a rich man's son. He had been a hero in
World War II, everything had come easy to him. I could identify with
Nixon. He had suffered and was terribly scarred by the experience. I
could feel for him. I could sympathize for him, but it was almost
impossible to like him,'' Baker said.
   But presidents and congressmen never interested Baker the way
writers did. For a man whose heroes included Ernest Hemingway and
E.B. White, the intrigues of Washington never entirely consumed him.
   By 1962, he knew his days as a reporter were numbered, that a
leisurely lunch meant more to him than any Senate subcommittee. When
the Sun asked him to write for their editorial page, the Times
topped it, giving Baker the ``Observer'' column he still has today.
   ``When I went to London for the Sun,'' Baker recalled, ``once a
week there was a column we had called `From a Window in Fleet
Street' (the home of newspapers in London).
   ``That was my first experience at writing a column. I discovered
I liked it. It was a wonderful release from the rigors of objective
reporting. I could deal with character and color.''
   Baker has no plans for a ``Russell Baker III,'' or sequel to his
life's story.
   ``I'm just a columnist now, nothing happens to me anymore,''
Baker said. ``Nothing ever happens to a columnist; they just
ossify.''

   OK, buckaroos and buckarettes. Return
with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear when cowboys rode
into the sunset in a wild, untamed land.
   Riders in the Sky, a buckskin singing trio, have rejuvenated the
Western radio serial with their weekly Riders Radio Theater on 100
National Public Radio stations.
   For 30 minutes each week, the three sing such Western tunes as
``Tumbling Tumbleweed,'' perform zany skits and present serials with
old West and contemporary themes.
   ``We've staked out a patch of range on the airwaves,'' says
Ranger Doug, who calls himself ``the idol of American youth.''
   Ranger Doug, who really is Douglas Green, is joined by cowboy
cohorts Woody Paul, ``the king of the cowboy fiddlers,'' and Too
Slim, ``bassist and mercantilist supreme.''
   The gunslingers and desperadoes don't stand a chance against
these guys.
   ``I think we're bringing back a tradition that had been forgotten
for the last 25 or 30 years,'' said Too Slim, who is Fred LaBour in
real life.
   Taped in Nashville in the format of an old-time radio show, the
program has become one of the most popular on public radio since
Garrison Keillor's ``Prairie Home Companion.''
   The show, which airs in Canada and Australia besides the United
States, just won awards from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting
for technical achievement and general music.
   Commercial radio stations are beginning to sign up for the
program as well.
   ``This is a real breakthrough,'' said Woody Paul, who really is
Paul Woodrow Chrisman. He has a doctorate in physics from
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but would rather earn his
living playing the fiddle.
   Playing cowboy has enabled him and his faithful sidekicks to do
battle against the villainous Slocum, their arch enemy on the show
since its premiere last October.
   In a continuining saga titled ``Meltdown on the Mesa,'' Slocum
and other bunkhouse badmen tried to use a nuclear reactor against
prairie dogs. They attempted to buy off the good guys by generously
offering a condominium.
   The trio got able assistance from Sidemeat, their devoted trail
cook who bakes biscuits referred to as ``the hardest substance known
to man.''
   Another show fixture is the announcer, Bix Bender, ``the voice
that sold a million baby chicks.''
   But the program is more than humor. The trio sing with pristine
precision while playing acoustic guitar, fiddle and standup bass.
   ``Several people say it's the fastest half-hour in radio,''
Ranger Doug said.
   The three, all around 40 years old, say the show has developed a
cult following.
   ``There are people who know the plots and want to discuss them,''
Too Slim said. ``They miss a week and want to know what happened.
Some people make up their own plots and send them in, like `Sidemeat
and the Beanstalk.'
   ``They write long, literate letters about the show,'' he said.
``The public radio audience is quick and appreciative when you do a
quality show.''
   The trio have been donning 10-gallon hats, kerchiefs and faded
chaps to sing their Western music for more than 10 years. They
perform regularly on the Grand Ole Opry, and were hosts of a Western
movie show, ``Tumbleweed Theater,'' for three seasons on The
Nashville Network on cable TV.
   They have recorded about a dozen albums, including the current
``Riders Go Commercial.'' They were in the movie ``Sweet Dreams,''
about the life of country star Patsy Cline, and in the Kenny Rogers
TV movie ``Wild Horses.''
   They also were favorites on ``Prairie Home Companion.''
   The trio believe they have filled a void by representing Western
heroes for youngsters. For the past few years, kids have embraced
such characters as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Indiana Jones and now
Batman as their heroes instead of such buckskin baritones as Tex
Ritter who were idolized by their parents, the three said.
   ``They just don't know any singing cowboys,'' Ranger Doug said.
``A kid age 7 doesn't even know Roy Rogers. They know He Man and
Batman.''
   A key to the show has been its family orientation.
   ``We're in an age where there is not a lot of mass popular
culture that parents feel comfortable enjoying with their
children,'' Ranger Doug said. ``Riders Radio Theater has something
for everybody.''
   For Woody Paul, his role fulfills a childhood ambition.
   ``I dreamed of playing a cowboy when I was a kid and here I am,''
he said. ``I ask the kids at the concerts what they want to be when
they grow up and they say they don't know. I say I don't know
either.''

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews May 5-13 with 1,084 adults in the
continental United States.
   Phone numbers were selected randomly and interviews were
conducted with the adult who had the most recent birthday, a random
phenomenon.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of 20 times
its findings should be within 3 points of the result if every adult
American were asked the same questions. The error margin is larger
for subgroups; it is 4 points for women and 6 points for the 18-29
age group, for example.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:

   Share prices were stronger but off earlier peaks at
midday Monday as the release of final British sales figures for May
trimmed the market's advance, dealers said.
   Retail sales volume rose a revised 3.0 percent in May from April,
the Department of Trade and Industry said and was the highest since
April 1987 when the index rose 3.1 percent.
   Dealers said the market hardened from the outset, as some fresh
new buying emerged on the first day of the new account period and
the third quarter.
   But many traders weren't expected to enter the market until later
in the week.
   At about noon in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 11.5 points, or 0.5 percent, at 2,162.5, off
its late morning best of 2,167.0. The index began at its minimum
level of 2,154.9, a gain of just 3.9 points.
   Volume at midday was 258.5 million shares compared with 256.1
million shares at the same time Friday.

   Chesebrough-Ponds Inc. has agreed to pay $376
million for Minnetonka Corp., the maker of Calvin Klein personal
care items and fragrances including Obsession perfume, the companies
said.
   New York-based Unilever United States Inc., the parent company of
Chesebrough-Ponds, said Sunday it simultaneously is selling two
Minnetonka divisions to a Japanese-owned company for about $70
million.
   The deal gives Chesebrough-Ponds all products made by
Bloomington, Minn.-based Minnetonka's Calvin Klein Cosmetics Corp.,
including the fragrances Obsession, Obsession for Men, Eternity and
Calvin.
   It also adds to the burgeoning personal care empire of Unilever,
the giant European conglomerate that owns Unilever United States and
had 1988 sales of $31 billion.
   Calvin Klein Cosmetics also is used on leather accessories such
as handbags and belts. Calvin Klein Cosmetics had 1988 net sales of
$158 million, about 82 percent in the United States.
   The $22.86-a-share deal for all of Minnetonka's outstanding
shares values Calvin Klein Cosmetics at about $306 million.
Minnetonka closed Friday at $25-a-share in national over-the-counter
trading.
   ``After meeting with the management of Unilever, I feel we can
share the same goals for the growth of our business,'' Klein said in
a statement. ``We look forward to a long and productive
relationship.''
   As part of the deal, Minnetonka has agreed to sell its Fragrance
Marketing Group and Minnetonka Medical divisions and the Minnetonka
name for $70 million to Tsumura International Inc., the U.S.
subsidiary of Tsumura &amp; Co. of Japan. The subsidiary markets
cosmetics and toiletries in the United States.
   ``We are ... very pleased that the employees of our various
operating (companies) united will be joining well-regarded companies
that can continue the growth of these businesses and brands,''
Minnetonka Chairman Robert R. Taylor said.
   Unilever United States is the holding company for the U.S.
businesses owned by Anglo-Dutch Unilever, the maker of food,
detergent and personal care items.
   Unilever already owns fragrances including Elizabeth Taylor's
Passion, Cerruti, Scherrer and White Shoulders.

   Stock prices were mostly lower in a sluggish,
holiday atmosphere on Wall Street today.
   The 10 a.m. Dow Jones average of 30 industrials stood at
2,440.06, unchanged from Friday's close.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 3 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 331 up, 568
down and 396 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 12.22 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Wall Street was expecting a slow session, given the absence of
many market participants taking a long July 4 weekend. The markets
will be closed on Tuesday.
   That helped make it difficult for stocks to mount a rally from
last week's decline, which was the steepest in more than 15 months.
   Analysts said traders' thoughts had begun to focus more intently
of late on the chances that the economy might in for something worse
than the much-ballyhooed ``soft landing'' bullish forecasters have
been predicting.
   New evidence of softening business activity emerged this morning
from a monthly survey of corporate purchasing executives, who
reported the first drop in new orders in more than three years.
   Minnetonka, traded in the over-the-counter market, fell 2| to
22]. The company agreed to be acquired by Unilever N.V. for $22.86 a
share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.31 to 177.59. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .54 at 358.43.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 18.21 to
2,440.06, stretching its loss for the week to 91.81 points.
   That marked the biggest weekly drop for the average since it

<HEAD>Italian Chemical Giant Unveils New Plastic Brand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's largest chemical and agro-industrial
group on Monday announced plans to produce and market a new
biodegradable plastic made from corn starch.
   The Ferruzzi group, which controls the chemical giant Montedison,
said the biodegradable plastic will be used initially to make
plastic bags, packing and napkins.
   ``We are studying the market sectors to which the new plastic
could fit,'' said Amilcare Collina, head of Montedison's research
division. ``Production of the biodegradable plastic would be started
next year. It would initially amount to a few million tons a year.''
   Collina said that the major chemical groups worldwide are
studying and developing new brands of biodegradable plastic ``but as
far as we know our brand derived from starch should be the first
ever of its kind.''
   Ferruzzi experts said the biodegradable plastic will be more
costly than the plastic currently used for bags and packing, but did
not cite any figures.
   Collina also said that the production of corn starch will be
increased as a result of the Ferruzzi group venture. However, he
said he could not immediately estimate how much maize (corn)
cultivation would have to increase to meet higher demands for corn
starch.
   Ferruzzi also has interests in cereals and controls Italy's
largest sugar concern, Eridania.
   The group's plan for the biodegradable plastic comes amid growing
protests by environmentalists over the use of plastic materials and
an Italian government decision to levy a tax on plastic bags.
   As a result the price of plastic bags in Italian supermarkets
soared to 170 lire (12 U.S. cents) from 50 lire (3.5 cents). Paper
bags sell for 150 lire (10.7 cents).

   The stock market was mixed today in a sluggish,
holiday atmosphere on Wall Street.
   The a.m. Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 91.81 points
last week, recovered 9.30 to 2,449.36 by 11 a.m. today on Wall
Street.
   But losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 511 up, 603

   Volume on the Big Board came to 26.23 million shares at
midmorning.
   Wall Street was expecting a slow session, given the absence of
many market participants taking a long July 4 weekend. The markets
will be closed on Tuesday.
   That helped make it difficult for stocks to mount a rally from
last week's decline, which was the steepest in more than 15 months.
   Analysts said traders' thoughts had begun to focus more intently
of late on the chances that the economy might in for something worse

been predicting.
   New evidence of softening business activity emerged this morning
from a monthly survey of corporate purchasing executives, who

<TEXT>
   PepsiCo Inc. said today it agreed to pay $1.35
billion in cash for two large British snack food makers that the
French food and beverage giant BSN bought from RJR Nabisco Inc. just
a month ago.
   The companies, Walkers Crisps and Smith Crisps, were acquired by
BSN as part of its purchase of RJR Nabisco's European food
operations. RJR had sold those operations to reduce some of the debt
from its record $24.5 billion buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co. completed earlier this year.
   Walkers and Smiths are among Britain's largest sellers of potato
chips and snack foods, with sales estimated at $460 million this
year.
   ``This acquisition makes PepsiCo the largest snack food producer
in Europe,'' PepsiCo Chairman D. Wayne Calloway said in a statement.
   ``It provides us with a great strategic opportunity to
aggressively develop the entire European market, an opportunity that
takes on added significance because of the elimination of trade
barriers in 1992.''
   Wall Street, though, wasn't as enthusiastic. In late-morning
trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, PepsiCo fell 50 cents
to $52.75 a share.
   BSN had purchased five RJR businesses on June 6 for $2.5 billion.
Besides Walkers and Smith, they included the United Kingdom biscuit
business of Nabisco Brands; The Belin Group, a French biscuit and
pastry business; and Saiwa, a biscuit and snack producer in Italy.
   BSN said it would retain the three biscuit and pastry companies.
   BSN, which had 1988 sales totaling $7 billion, produces biscuits,
dairy and other grocery products, beer, champagne and mineral water.
   Pepsico, based in Purchase, N.Y., is one of the world's largest
consumer products companies with sales of $13 billion last year, 37
percent of which came from snack foods.
   Among its well-known businesses are Pepsi-Cola Co., Seven-Up
International, plus the Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried
Chicken restaurant chains. Its snack food operations, which hold a
60 percent market share in the United States, manufactures products
under the name Frito-Lay, Doritos and Lays.

<HEAD>Rig Count Increases for Sixth Straight Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs increased
by seven rigs this week to 817, marking the sixth straight weekly
gain, according to Baker Hughes Inc.
   The nationwide count increased by 15 last week. A year ago, the
count totaled 921, Baker Hughes reported Monday.
   The company's rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing
oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil tool making company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, California saw the biggest gain
with eight additional rigs, followed by Wyoming, five; Oklahoma,
three; Colorado, two and Louisiana and Ohio, one each.
   Texas had the biggest drop with nine fewer rigs, followed by
North Dakota, three; Michigan and New Mexico, two each, and
Pennsylvania, one. Kansas remained unchanged from last week.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices were lower, corn was higher
and soybeans were mixed this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade
in reaction to dry weather forecasts for the Midwest and a
government report on grain stocks.
   Wheat's modest decline stemmed from an Agriculture Department
report released Friday that pegged U.S. wheat stocks at 694 million
bushels as of June 1, far above the approximately 625 million
bushels that traders had expected.
   The USDA's tallies of warehoused corn and soybeans also were
larger than the market anticipated, but not to the same degree as
the wheat number.
   Corn and soybean traders paid closer attention to forecasts for a
weak of hot, dry weather in the Midwest. Crops in the western Corn
Belt are especially in need of rain.
   Soybean prices for near-term delivery were a little lower in
reaction to the devaluation of Brazil's currency, making Brazilian
soybeans more competitive on the world market.
   Early activity was quiet, with many traders stretching the Fourth
of July holiday into a four-day weekend.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 3{ cents lower with the
contarct for delivery in July at $3.96\ cents a bushel; corn was }
cent to 2{ cents higher with July at $2.67{ a bushel; oats were 2}
cents to 3\ cents higher with July at $1.52\ a bushel; soybeans were
2 cents lower to 7} cents higher with July at $7.33 a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, trading in hog and pork belly
futures was virtually frozen with all contracts down their permitted
daily limits in reaction to Friday's USDA hogs and pigs report.
   The USDA counted substantially more animals that the market had
expected.
   Cattle futures were sharply lower in sympathy with the pork
complex.
   Live cattle were .37 cent to .67 cent lower with August at 69.30
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .52 cent to .60 cent lower with
August at 80.30 cents a pound; hogs were 1.50 cents lower across the
board with July at 47.17 cents a pound; and, frozen pork bellies
were 2 cents lower across the board with July at 33.85 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled lower on Friday while pork futures

<TEXT>
   Construction spending, continuing to be led by
an increase in work on government projects, rose 1.3 percent in May,
the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department reported that spending on both public and
private construction rose to a seasonally adjusted $421.3 billion in
May, following a 0.8 percent drop in April and a 0.2 percent rise in
March.
   While public construction rose 6.7 percent in May to $86.2
billion, private construction remained flat at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $335.1 billion, the department said. Private
construction had fallen 1.6 percent in March.
   The construction industry has been among the sectors of the
economy hardest hit recently by the Federal Reserve's campaign to
halt inflation by tightening credit and thus boosting interest rates.
   May's spending level was 3.3 percent above the pace in May 1988.
   Spending on private, non-residential construction projects rose
2.6 percent in May to an annual rate of $98.7 billion.
   But construction of new housing units fell 2.5 percent to a
$138.6 billion annual rate. Spending on single-family homes fell 1.5
percent, while construction of multi-family units was off 6.7
percent.

<HEAD>LIN Asks Stockholders To Reject McCaw $120-a-Share Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LIN Broadcasting Corp.'s board of directors has
rejected as inadequate a $5.85 billion takeover offer from McCaw
Cellular Communications Inc. and is calling on stockholders to do
likewise, the company said Monday.
   LIN said its board concluded at a special meeting on Saturday
after conferring with financial advisors Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co.
that the $120-a-share offer was not in the best interest of
shareholders.
   LIN originally decided on June 19 to reject the offer from
McCaw's parent MMM Holdings Inc., and explore other alternatives.
   Lin, which has interests in cellular telephones, television and
publishing, said its alternatives included staying independent,
recapitalizing or selling itself to other potential buyers.
   On Friday, LIN lost a legal fight with Metromedia Co. over LIN's
claims to interests held by Metromedia in cellular telephone
companies in New York and Philadelphia.
   Had LIN prevailed over Metromedia, its stock value might have
risen as much as $40 a share, some analysts said. A defeat, they
predicted, could prompt McCaw to amend its offer.
   LIN's stock price tumbled $7.12{ a share on Friday to $115.87{ in
national over-the-counter trading.
   LIN said Monday that the company had rejected McCaw's offer last
month without taking the Metromedia litigation into consideration.
   ``Some might assume we thought our stock was worth more than $120
a share with the possible favorable outcome with Metromedia,'' said
Michael Plouf, a LIN vice president. ``We think it was worth more
than $120 regardless of the Metromedia litigation.''
   LIN said further that McCaw had not received approval from the
Federal Communications Commission and state regulatory authorities
to purchase LIN common stock and had not obtained adequate financing.
   James Abernathy, a spokesman for Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw,
said there was no new comment from the company. After Friday's
ruling, McCaw had said it was disappointed in the outcome of the
litigation and would review the court's decision.
   It also noted that McCaw reserved the right to amend its June 8
offer, which expires Thursday, in the event of adverse developments
in the LIN-Metromedia litigation.

   In the go-go days, they said what happened to
savings and loans in Texas could never happen here.
   Highflying thrifts loaned millions on tracts of desert, but
Arizona was different, they thought. Land flipped from buyer to
buyer at higher and higher prices. S&amp;Ls offered loans without down
payments, and some even made themselves partners in risky ventures.
Even the oldest, most conservative savings banks got caught up in
the pandemonium.
   But the multibillion-dollar bust in Texas, the birthplace of the
nation's S&amp;L crisis, would never happen here, they said.
   It did.
   Five of the eight S&amp;Ls based in the Phoenix area are now
insolvent and have been taken over by regulators. The real estate
market is in a free fall. Losses have run into the hundreds of
millions of dollars each quarter. Estimates of the cost to taxpayers
to clean up just the Arizona thrifts climb up to $6 billion.
   ``I think what happened in Phoenix is very similar to what
happened in Texas,'' said Gene Rice, chairman of MeraBank, Arizona's
largest thrift. ``The market became overbuilt because of too much
optimism in financial institutions and out-of-town investors. Then,
when it collapsed, everyone ran for a corner.''
   Arizona, added thrift analyst William Ferguson, ``appears headed
in almost the exact direction Texas went in. The ratios look about
the same.''
   Experts say the collapse of the thrift industry in the Grand
Canyon state, far removed from the plunge in oil prices that helped
trigger the Texas debacle, points out how pervasive the S&amp;L crisis
is, and how few lessons the industry has learned from Texas.
   In Arizona, the worst is not over, and in the end, taxpayers will
be stuck with a lot of tracts of dusty desert far outside Phoenix.
   To be sure, the bill awaiting taxpayers for the Arizona problem
is only a fraction of the $50 billion to $75 billion tab for Texas,
and experts say Arizona didn't suffer as much fraud as the Lone Star
State. But on a percentage basis, the Arizona crisis actually looks
worse than Texas.
   Texas has 204 thrifts; Arizona has only 11 savings institutions
based in the state. Five of them _ all in Phoenix _ are insolvent,
according to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   ``There's tremendous concentration in this market,'' said Bob
Stallings, chairman of Western Savings, who was recruited last
spring from a Dallas thrift. ``I'm seeing some of the same problems
here, and in fact, even worse.''
   Repossessed assets at Arizona thrifts have skyrocketed from $207
million at the end of 1986 to $1 billion at the end of 1988.
Regulatory capital _ a measure of the institutions' solvency _ has
plunged from $1.13 billion in 1986 to $343 million in 1988. Earnings
have reversed from a $110 million 1985 profit to a $657 million 1988
loss, with another $195 million loss in the first three months of
this year.
   And a recent poll in Phoenix found that despite the government's
$100,000 deposit insurance, six of 10 consumers believed S&amp;Ls were
risky places for their savings.
   Arizona officials have gone to Washington to ask for special
consideration in the Bush administration's S&amp;L bailout plan and to
plead for a guarantee the land won't be dumped at fire-sale prices.
   Regulators now control the bulk of thrifts' real estate assets in
Arizona _ more than $10 billion worth.
   ``The most important economic factor in Arizona is what happens
with the Bush plan,'' said state Banking Commissioner Hank Rivoir.
``The (regulators) could kill Arizona's economy for years to come,
or they could give us just a flesh wound.''
   Like Texas, Arizona has a liberal real estate law that allowed
the risky S&amp;L lending practices.
   When Texas was booming, developers fueled with easy-to-get loans
overbuilt, and when oil turned down, the market crashed. In Arizona,
an overbuilt market began to crash after the 1986 tax law removed
some incentives for real estate.
   Real estate values actually have fallen faster than in Texas,
Stallings said.
   The crash is the result of concern about the future of the
insolvent thrifts and whether the government will end up dumping
assets. For now, potential buyers are on the sidelines, watching
prices plummet.
   ``Everyone is pushing down trying to find the bottom. You keep
pushing, and there's nothing there,'' he said. ``Dallas-Fort Worth
was never as bad as values indicated they were, and I'm seeing the
same thing here.''
   Western Savings, Stallings' thrift, is much like some Texas S&amp;Ls.
One of Arizona's oldest thrifts and today the state's
second-largest, Western plunged into aggressive real estate lending,
much of which turned sour. It needed big returns on investments to
repay depositors. It even ventured into the junk bonds and preferred
stock of a much-troubled Dallas real estate investment firm,
Southmark Corp.
   Western lost. A total $46.5 million investment in Southmark is
now worth less than $10 million.
   Like other Arizona thrifts, Western has offered depositors some
of the highest interest rates in the country just to keep money in
the bank.
   Regulators forced the ouster of Western's top management, and
encouraged Stallings' hiring. But it was too late. In June,
regulators declared Western insolvent and took control.
   MeraBank had losses of $209 million last year and $29.2 million
in the first quarter of this year. Analysts say that despite its
more conservative management, MeraBank teeters on the verge of
insolvency.
   ``With the way the Arizona market has tanked, even the best-run
thrifts have trouble surviving,'' said SNL Securities analyst James
Marks.
   Longtime Merabank chairman Rice says he's been through five
downturns in the S&amp;L industry now _ each one worse than the previous.
   ``In good times, everyone thinks it will last forever. In bad
times, everyone thinks it will never turn around. And they're both
wrong,'' Rice said.
   The thrift does have the advantage of an agreement between
regulators and its parent company, Pinnacle West Capital Corp.,
which also owns the state's largest public utility. The agreement is
that Pinnacle will maintain adequate levels of capital.
   Rivoir, the banking commissioner, has assembled an advisory
committee and gone to Washington to press for mercy. Stallings has
proposed his own plan and met with business leaders he says are
eager to help.
   Thrifts are hiring loan work-out experts from Texas and importing
some of the techniques developed there to survive the thrift crisis,
according to Phoenix banking consultant Deborah Bateman.
   But investors and thrift executives can do little more than wait
for Washington to decide their fate. Ms. Bateman said she knows of
investors who are ready to grab banks, thrifts and their assets dirt
cheap, but regulators have put everything on hold until the Bush
plan is passed.
   ``We've got conservators that are babysitters right now,'' she
said. ``Nothing is going on.''

   The Weather Channel is just what its name implies
_ weather reports, non-stop, 24 hours a day. That's not
entertainment, but it's attracting enough viewers and advertisers to
keep things sunny at the 7-year-old cable television station.
   The concept of round-the-clock weather may sound unlikely to have
viewers glued to their sets. But The Weather Channel has grown to be
the nation's 14th-largest cable network in terms of subscribers.
   The channel, owned by Virginia-based Landmark Communications
Inc., is affiliated with 3,650 cable systems across the nation and
reaches 38.5 million households.
   By comparison, the nation's top cable channel, ESPN, is available
to 50 million subscribers, according to the National Cable
Television Association, an industry organization.
   ``People laughed at Landmark when we launched The Weather Channel
_ no way,'' said Michael J. Eckert, the president of the station.
``Industry observers really didn't give us more than a year, and we
proved them wrong.
   ``But we always knew, we were the ones who did the homework and
the research,'' he said. ``We weren't entertainment, we weren't
flashy, we weren't glamorous. You know, it's kind of everyday,
bread-and-butter information.''
   Eckert, interviewed in his office below the channel's suburban
Atlanta studios as a steady rain fell outside, said he sees the
attraction of full-time weather in fairly simple terms. Like
automated bank tellers, fast food and speedy oil changes, it's a
reflection of today's society in which quick information is at a
premium, he said.
   ``America is becoming more and more an on-demand, I-want-it-now,
instant-gratification society,'' Eckert said. ``People are also in a
position of requiring on-demand information.''
   Frequent travelers, outdoor workers, farmers, rescue agencies and
those in the aviation industry are among the station's regular
viewers, Eckert said. Families also want current weather information
to help dress the kids for school or plan weekend outings.
   Eckert said the station's planners knew from the start viewers
wouldn't watch weather programming like other TV fare.
   ``We knew we couldn't expect people to watch us as they watch a
half-hour TV program,'' Eckert said. ``Anybody that would watch us
for a half-hour is probably one of those weather nuts who is really
into weather as a dynamic.''
   ``They went out and filled a very valuable niche,'' said John
Wolfe, spokesman for the Washington-based cable association. ``If
you live on the Gulf Coast in the hurricane season, you develop a
real appreciation for them.''
   There is much competition for reporting the weather, Eckert said.
But local radio and television reports provide weather information
only a few minutes each day, and newspaper weather pages are printed
hours before the reader sees them, he added.
   ``While there is competition, it's not there all the time,'' he
said. ``In some cases, we supplement or complement what's there. In
others, we replace it.''
   Recently, the station has incorporated a series of documentaries
_ on such subjects as drought, coastal erosion and earthquakes _ but
the heart of the operation remains the continual weather reports and
forecasts.
   ``We live weather,'' Eckert said. ``That's our business.''
   The channel employs 50 meteorologists and is now offering to
cable systems a computer system called The Weather Star 4000 that
taps into the nation's more than 700 local weather zones to
coordinate the local forecasts that are incorporated into the
national programming about every five minutes, Eckert said.
   Because the typical Weather Channel viewer stays tuned in for
only about 10 minutes at a time, according to Eckert, the station
sells its advertising space more like radio than the average TV
station.
   Rather than selling, for example, one spot in a popular program,
The Weather Channel sells advertising spots to run many times a day
to catch the viewers during their brief periods of watching the
station, Eckert said. Instead of long breaks for clusters of
commercials, the weather station has frequent one-minute commercial
breaks.
   ``We generate audience like radio, lots of turnover, so
advertisers buy us that way,'' Eckert said.
   He said the channel currently has about 200 national advertisers.
   Though the main work of the station is to provide fast, accurate
weather information, Eckert said the channel is trying to make its
presentation more visually attractive.
   The reports are generally given from a set resembling a news
program, with maps the primary visual aid. But the station is making
increased use of graphics, taped reports and live shots, such as
footage from the scene of severe weather. During Hurricane Gilbert
in 1988, the channel had two crews in Jamaica to deliver live
reports, Eckert said.
   Eckert said many of The Weather Channel's viewers probably tuned
in the first time during a period of severe weather. He said he
hopes that once someone sees what that channel has to offer, they
will come back for more.
   ``We spend millions of dollars a year on viewer research,''
Eckert said. ``We are in a continual state of evolution. We're very
consumer-driven.''

   California's Apple Computer Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. were
among the 10 best manufacturing companies to work for, according to
a survey of industry experts released Monday.
   Commissioned by the Society of Manufacturing Engineers, the
report focused on U.S. manufacturers that produce parts or products.
   The report showed the 10 companies shared a similar employee
philosophy, society spokesman Tom Drozda said.
   ``Whether they organize them in teams, divisions, units or by
functions _ all 10 companies treat their employees, first and
foremost, as unique individuals. Employees are expected to
participate and contribute, and they are given the intellectual and
personal freedom to do so,'' Drozda said.
   The 10 companies, which weren't ranked, are:
   _Apple Computer, Cupertino, Calif.
   _American Telephone and Telegraph Co., New York.
   _Boeing Co., Seattle.
   _Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass.
   _Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, N.Y.
   _Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, Mich.
   _General Electric Co., Fairfield, Conn.
   _Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, Calif.
   _International Business Machines Corp., Armonk, N.Y.
   _Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh.
   The companies were evaluated in eight categories, including: pay
and benefits; stability and job security; commitment to producing
safe, high-quality products; location and climate; quality of
supervision; continuing education and encouraged personal
development; ambience and overall working conditions; and job
challenges and rewards.

<HEAD>Report: Economy Down for Second Straight Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In another sign of an economic slowdown, the
nation's purchasing managers reported Monday that the U.S.
manufacturing economy declined in June for the second straight month.
   Analysts said the monthly report by the National Association of
Purchasing Management provided more evidence of an across-the-board
economic slackening, but not a recession.
   ``It's telling us what we've already been sensing: that the
economy has been growing less rapidly,'' said Robert Chandross,
chief economist with Lloyds Bank PLC in New York. ``But I don't
think it is an indication that would signal we're in a recession.''
   The Purchasing Managers' Index slumped to 48.8 percent from 49.7
percent in May. The decline put the index at its lowest level since
July 1986 when it was 48 percent. The May decline was the first in
33 months.
   A reading above 50 indicates the economy is generally expanding;
below 50, that the economy is generally declining. The difference
from 50 indicates the intensity of the change.
   Production by the nation's factories was the only indicator to
increase, while new orders declined for the first time since May
1986 and inventories also fell. Vendor deliveries were faster for
the second month _ a sign of declining demand _ after 31 months in
which they were reported slower.
   ``The total economy continued down the path toward slower growth
as it ended the second quarter,'' said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of
the Tempe, Ariz.-based trade group.
   ``The best news is that inflation appears to be slowing at a
faster pace than the overall economy,'' said Bretz, director of
materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc.
   The purchasing managers' price index fell for the second
consecutive month, to 48.5 percent, down sharply from 57.6 percent
in May and the lowest since it was 42.8 percent in April 1986.
   It was the first time in 34 months that more purchasers reported
price decreases than increases, indicating that inflation may be
ebbing.
   While the purchasing report surveys only the manufacturing sector
and gives equal weight to small and large firms, it is the first
economic gauge released each month and generally receives wide
attention as an early signal.
   The group's figures are compiled through a monthly survey of
purchasing executives at more than 250 industrial companies. The
report was released Monday morning for immediate use in a policy
change from previous months when it was released on Friday and
ordered held for publication until Monday.
   The report follows economic news last month indicating further
softness.
   Orders to factories for manufactured goods slumped 2.7 percent in
May; the key Index of Leading Economic Indicators dropped 1.2
percent, its steepest decline since the October 1987 stock market
crash; durable goods orders plunged at the steepest rate in 10
months; and consumer spending also declined sharply.
   Many analysts believe the declines are consistent with the
Federal Reserve's attempt to engineer a so-called soft landing with
slower growth and less inflation that won't drive the economy into a
recession.
   ``We do expect to see a very slow economy in the next three
quarters but we do not expect to see a recession,'' said David Wyss,
chief financial economist for DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc. in Lexington,
Mass.
   The purchasing management group said its overall index has
averaged 51.4 percent for the first half of 1989 but 50.5 percent
for the second quarter. It said the second-quarter figure indicates
annual growth of about 2 percent in the gross national product, the
value of all goods and services produced.
   The group said the index would have to fall below 44 percent
before signaling a decline in the inflation-adjusted GNP.
   New orders declined in June after 48 months of expansion, falling
to 47.2 percent from 53.4 percent in May. It was the indicator's
lowest level since 47.2 percent in September 1984.
   Production, though, expanded in June for the 35th straight month,
rising to 52.4 percent from 51.1 percent in May. Inventories were
49.7 percent, the nearest level to growth since last December's 50.8
percent. The group's inventories index was 41.9 percent in May.
   The group said 65 percent of members that use steel plan to
increase inventories to guard against possible production slowdowns
when labor contracts expire at some mills July 31.

   Stock prices staged a modest upswing in very
quiet pre-July 4 trading today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 91.81 points last
week, recovered 10.05 to 2,450.11 by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 668 up, 611 down and 534
unchanged.
   Wall Street was expecting a slow pace of activity, given the
absence of many market participants taking a long July 4 weekend.
The markets will be closed on Tuesday.
   That helped make it difficult for stocks to mount a rally from
last week's decline, which was the steepest in more than 15 months.
   Analysts said traders' thoughts had begun to focus more intently
of late on the chances that the economy might in for something worse
than the much-ballyhooed ``soft landing'' bullish forecasters have
been predicting.
   New evidence of softening business activity emerged this morning
from a monthly survey of corporate purchasing executives, who
reported the first drop in new orders in more than three years.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, up \ at 112[; USX, up [ at 34|; Philip Morris, up } at
139], and General Electric, up \ at 51~.
   Minnetonka, traded in the over-the-counter market, fell 2{ to
22{. The company agreed to be acquired by Unilever N.V. for $22.86 a
share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.45 to 178.35. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .62 at 358.35.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 51.76 million shares with two

   Share prices staged a modest rebound from last
week's losses to close significantly higher Monday on the London
Stock Exchange.
   Enthusiasm generated by corporate takeover activity overcame the
negative implications of a sharp upward revision in British retail
sales for May, analysts said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 14.6
points, or 0.67 percent, higher at 2,165.6. At its best, the index
was up 16.0 points at late morning, shortly before the retail sales
data were released. The market opened at its lowest level, with the
100-share index showing a gain of 3.9 points.
   Volume was meager, subdued in part because of quiet trading on
Wall Street before Tuesday's U.S. Independence Day holiday. The
London market saw 410.8 million shares change hands, down sharply
from 550.4 million on Friday.
   There was a small amount of buying interest at the outset of
trading on the first day of a new quarter and a new trading account,
analysts said. Activity then picked up as Boots Co., a
pharmaceutical retailer, launched an 800 million pound ($1.26
billion) hostile takeover bid for Ward White Group, a diversified
retailer and manufacturer.
   ``That helped sentiment. But the tone of the market was positive
even before the bid came out,'' said one dealer.
   Some of the market's robustness was dented, however, by the
retail sales report, which suggested that spending by British
consumers hasn't been curbed by high interest rates.
   The data showed that retail sales volume rose a revised 3.0
percent in May from April, the largest monthly rise in more than two
years. The government, which originally reported a 2.5 percent rise
for the month, said that recent retail sales figures have been
erratic and cautioned against reading too much into the data.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index was up 7.1 points at
1,791.6. The Financial Times 500 index was up 7.77 at 1,231.31.

   Corn and soybeans futures prices closed sharply
higher Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts of an
extended spell of hot, dry weather in the Midwest.
   Oat futures also advanced while wheat futures prices fell
moderately in reaction to Friday's Argiculture Department
grain-stocks report, which indicated U.S. wheat stockpiles were
larger than traders had figured.
   Prices for most corn and soybean contracts rose at the opening
bell following a weekend of dry weather in the Corn Belt and were
bolstered by Monday's forecasts.
   ``Some forecasters don't see any rain at all for the next week or
so and that was the whole ballgame,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   The National Weather Service predicted mostly dry conditions in
the Midwest in a six-to-10-day forecast issued after the close of
trading, which could prompt further buying on Wednesday.
   The markets will be closed Tuesday, the Fourth of July.
   At the close, wheat settled 1 cent to 2} cents lower with July at
$3.94{ a bushel; corn was 4\ cents to 8} cents higher with July at

   The dollar finished lower against all major
currencies in thin, pre-holiday trading Monday following a selloff
overseas.
   Gold prices were sharply higher in response. Republic National
Bank of New York quoted a troy ounce of gold bullion at $377, up
$3.50 from late Friday.
   Currency traders said the dollar started out lower after a big
decline in Europe and Asia that was attributed in part to
profit-taking and reported intervention by the Bank of Japan.
   Many overseas traders also unloaded dollars following losses
suffered by Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party in the Tokyo
municipal elections.
   ``We really inherited the weak dollar when we came in this
morning,'' explained Trevor Woodland, a trader with Harris Trust &
Co. in Chicago. ``This was not a North American market move.''
   Woodland said concerns that the Federal Reserve will move toward
an easier credit stance due to a slowdown in the U.S. economy also
depressed the dollar.
   Trading, though, was very quiet, with many dealers getting an
early start on the Independence Day holiday on Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 1.45 Japanese yen to a closing 142.50 yen. It was
quoted lower at 141.25 yen in London, and at 141.25 yen in New York,
down from 143.82 yen late Friday.
   The dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $1.5775 to buy
one pound in London, more expensive than $1.5535 late Friday.
Sterling fetched $1.5775 in New York, up from $1.5530.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.9295 West German marks, down from 1.9515; 1.6550 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6757; 1.1953 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1966;
6.5545 French francs, down from 6.6290; and 1,397.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,412.5.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday, included
: 1.9285 West German marks, down from 1.9510; 1.6537 Swiss francs,
down from 1.6728; 6.5485 French francs, down from 6.6200; 2.1775
Dutch guilders, down from 2.2020; 1.1945 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1980; and 1,400.50 Italian lire, down from 1,410.50.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery jumped to $381.10 a troy ounce from $374.60 late Friday.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $375.05 an ounce, up
from late Friday's $371.75. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold rose to
$374.35 an ounce from $371.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.73 to close at a bid of
$375.93 an ounce.
   Silver prices also gained ground. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery settled at $5.230 a troy ounce, up from
$5.155 Friday. Silver rose in London to $5.20 an ounce from $5.14.

   Government bonds gave a mixed performance during
an abbreviated session Monday with long-term issues falling while
other maturities made modest gains.
   The volume of business in the credit markets was light and
trading ended earlier than normal ahead of the Independence Day
holiday, when U.S. financial markets will be closed.
   The 30-year Treasury bond, the market's benchmark issue, fell
13-32 point, or just over $3.25 for every $1,000 in face value. Its
yield, which moves in the opposite direction to price, finished
trading at 8.06 percent, up from 8.03 percent late Friday.
   Marilyn Cohen, president of the Beverly Hills, Calif., brokerage
Capital Insight, said that after a brief flurry of government bond
trading early on, the market settled down with most issues merely
marking time.
   ``I think most of the people who ended up staying home did the
right thing,'' said Cohen. ``It's been a non-event.''
   A monthly report from the National Association of Purchasing
Management had limited impact on bond prices or interest rates
because it didn't reveal anything unexpected.
   The Purchasing Managers' Index sagged to 48.8 percent in June
from 49.7 percent in May. The decline put the index at its lowest
level since July 1986, when it was 48 percent. The May decline was
the first in 33 months.
   Economists interpreted the decline in the widely-watched
indicator as the latest in a series of statistics pointing to
weakening business activity.
   But bond traders have already been operating under that
assumption so there was little incentive to buy or sell Monday based
on the news.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 1-32 point. The average yield to
maturity declined to 7.20 percent from 7.29 percent late Friday. The
size of the decline was due in part to the replacement of some
high-coupon bonds in the index that were sparsely traded by newer
issues with lower coupon rates, the Bond Buyer said.
   In corporate trading, industrials were up. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a
portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, rose 0.08 to 327.52.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term government issues rose 1-16 point to 5-32 point,
intermediate maturities rose by 1-32 point to 3-32 point and
long-term issues fell 11-32 point to 13-32 point, according to
Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, edged down by 0.23 to 1,185.64.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.21 percent as the
discount slid 3 basis points to 7.95 percent. Yields on six-month
bills held at 8.07 percent as the discount fell 5 basis points to
7.67 percent. Yields on 1-year bills declined to 8.02 percent as the
discount slipped 6 basis points to 7.47 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at the end of trading at 9 7-16 percent, up from
9\ percent late Friday.

   Factories closed and the stock exchange was
deserted Monday as a strike called by right-wing groups to protest
Sikh extremism paralyzed this commercial capital of India, officials
said.
   At least three people died, rioters smashed buses and a bomb was
detected at a railroad station during the 18-hour strike called
throughout the Maharashtra state, news reports and police in the
state capital of Bombay said.
   The deaths occurred in Chikli, 230 miles west of Bombay, when
police opened fire on a rioting mob of about 5,000 right-wing
activists, state Police Chief S.V. Bhave told reporters.
   The strike was called to protest the June 25 killing of 26 Hindus
by Sikh extremists in Moga, a town in the northern Punjab state.
   The victims belonged to a Hindu fundamentalist organization
called the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or the National Volunteer
Force, and were shot to death in a park as they practiced martial
exercises.
   The force was one of the organizers of Monday's strike that began
at midnight and ended at 6 p.m. local time. The other organizers
were the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, or the Indian People's
Party, and the Shiv Sena or Shiva's Army, named after the Hindu god
of destruction.
   The Shiv Sena along with the National Volunteer Force has a
strong following in this Hindu-dominated western state that is
governed by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress (I) party.

   The stock market, adrift in the midst of a long
summer holiday weekend, posted a modest gain Monday in the slowest
trading in more than 2{ years.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 91.81 points last
week, recovered 12.71 to 2,452.77.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
733 up, 587 down and 562 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 68.87 million
shares, down from 170.49 million Friday and the lightest total since
48.86 million were traded Dec. 26, 1986.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 80.56 million shares.
   Wall Street had expected a slow session, given the absence of
many market participants taking a long July 4 weekend. The markets
will be closed on Tuesday.
   That helped make it difficult for stocks to mount a rally from
last week's decline, which was the steepest in more than 15 months.
   Analysts said traders' thoughts had begun to focus more intently
of late on the chances that the economy might in for something worse
than the much-ballyhooed ``soft landing'' bullish forecasters have
been predicting.
   New evidence of softening business activity emerged Monday
morning from a monthly survey of corporate purchasing executives,
who reported the first drop in new orders since May of 1986.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, up ] at 112\; Pfizer, up ] at 57}; Philip Morris, up { at
139[, and General Electric, up { at 52[.
   Airline issues climbed on continuing speculation about possible
new takeover bids in the industry. UAL gained 5 to 144{; AMR 1~ to
63, and Delta Air Lines { to 68].
   Another pocket of strength showed up in Japanese issues. TDK rose
2{ to 83; Matsushita Electric 3{ to 165, and Kyocera 4| to 86\.
   Minnetonka, traded in the over-the-counter market, fell 2| to
22]. The company agreed to be acquired by Unilever N.V. for $22.86 a
share, a price well below what some traders had been hoping for.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $9.48 billion, or 0.30
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.61 to 178.51.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.34 to 364.82, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up 1.25 at 319.23.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
.71 to 436.00. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 358.83, down .14.

<TEXT>
   Cheap, badly labeled and inferior tuna and
other canned sea foods mostly from Thailand and Peru are flooding
the market, providing ``disloyal competition'' for Mexico's
fishermen and canners, a spokesman for the industry said Monday.
   Andres Armenta Gonzalez, president of the Chamber of Fishing
Industries, also complained in an interview with the Excelsior news
agency that new seafood farming in several nations and and cheap
fish meal from Peru are giving Mexican fisheries a rough time.
   Gonzalez said this year's sea catches are very good, with about
65,000 tons harvested up to now, and an estimated 150,000 projected
for the entire year.
   But he complained that canned tuna from Thailand and Peru comes
in to Mexico without proper labeling and, in some cases, is
unhygienically packed.
   Gonzalez also said products from seafood farms in China and
Ecuador, produced at lower costs, are tending to edge Mexican
sea-harvested items out of traditional markets.
   ``In addition to that, fish meal from Peru is entering this
country without any kind of quality control,'' he added. Fish meal
is used principally as feed for the poultry industry.
   Mexican industrialists have been complaining about foreign
competition ever since Mexico joined the General Agreement on
Tariffs and trade in 1986-87 and opened its doors to foreign imports.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Punitive-Damages Appeals; Allows Anti-Dumping Regulations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday rejected three
appeals raising the issue of whether skyrocketing punitive-damage
awards in personal injury lawsuits violate due-process rights.
   The decisions came one week after the court suggested it would be
willing to decide such cases.
   Without comment, the justices turned away the case of a $17.8
million award won by ventriloquist Paul Winchell over the
destruction of all videotapes of his popular children's television
show of the 1960s.
   The court refused to hear arguments by Metromedia Inc. that the
bulk of the California jury award _ $14 million in punitive damages
_ is unconstitutional.
   The court also refused to hear an appeal by Goodyear Tire &amp;
Rubber Co., which was ordered to pay $4 million in punitive damages
to a Minnesota service station attendant injured by an exploding
tire.
   And the justices refused to study the issue in an appeal by a
salt mining company ordered to pay $10 million in punitive damages
to Kansas farmers whose crops were ruined.
   In other business-related decisions, the high court:
   _Allowed the government to enforce regulations barring sales at
below market value in a way foreign companies and U.S. importers
claim improperly impedes international trade.
   The court rejected a Canadian steel producer's appeal that was
supported by a U.S. export-import association and an international
consumers group.
   _Agreed to re-examine how far states may go to prohibit
advertising by lawyers, in an appeal by an Illinois lawyer censured
for saying on his professional letterhead he is a civil trial
specialist certified by a private organization.
   _Ordered reargument of related cases from Arkansas and Florida on
whether a business that successfully challenges a state tax as an
undue burden on interstate commerce is entitled to be refunded money
it paid before the tax was invalidated.
   _Told a federal appeals court to restudy a lawsuit accusing
billionaire hotel owner Harry Helmsley and his business partners of
fraud in connection with a New York City condominium conversion.
   On punitive damages, the high court June 26 ruled that the
awards, no matter how large, do not violate the Constitution's ban
on excessive fines. The court said 7-2 that the ban does not apply
to civil lawsuits between private citizens or corporations.
   But it left open the possibility that due-process guarantees _
the Constitution's assurance of fair play _ may limit juries'
discretion to award enormous sums in civil suits.
   The court was being urged in the three cases to impose a broad
standard for judges and juries, particularly in states that have not
imposed ceilings on damage awards, not to rule on the
constitutionality of such limits.
   Business leaders have clashed for years with lawyers and consumer
groups over the legitimacy of multimillion dollar awards in a range
of lawsuits.
   Opponents say the big-money awards are catastrophic for U.S.
competitiveness and discourage development of potentially risky
products, particularly new forms of medical treatment. They also say
juries penalize the wealthy in order to benefit victims.
   Consumer activists and trial lawyers say punitive damages are a
powerful deterrent to corporate greed that poses a threat to public
safety. They say large corporations may view smaller compensatory
awards as an acceptable cost of doing business.
   The Winchell case stemmed from a 1965 contract calling for him to
produce and host the ``Winchell-Mahoney Time'' television show,
which featured Winchell's dummy, Jerry Mahoney.
   A dispute between Winchell and Metromedia arose in 1969 over
future broadcast rights of tapes of 288 shows. Metromedia erased all
288 tapes in 1972. When Winchell learned in 1976 that the tapes had
been destroyed, he sued Metromedia for breach of contract.
   In the case of the exploding tire, Goodyear was ordered to pay
$3.37 million in compensatory damages and $4 million in punitive
damages to Dale Hodder.
   Hodder, who worked at a service station in Remer, Minn., was 17
at the time of the accident on Dec. 19, 1981. The metal rim of a
truck tire manufactured in 1955 exploded while he was mounting the
tire on a customer's logging truck. Goodyear has since discontinued
making that type of tire, called a K-rim.
   In the Kansas case, General Host Corp. and its subsidiary Cudahy
Co. were ordered to pay Rice County farmers $3.06 million for actual
damages from 1975 through 1983 plus the $10 million punitive award.
   Salt mining operations run by the companies were found to have
polluted an underground stream, making the water unusable for
irrigation.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Sink To 8-Year-Low On Collapse Of Price Supports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices collapsed to an 8-year low Monday as the
International Coffee Organization suspended export quotas and
traders positioned themselves for an expected surge in available
supplies.
   ``I think it's a bonanza for the American consumer,'' said Bert
Ruiz, a vice president with the New York brokerage firm Balfour
Maclaine Corp., who predicted that wholesale prices of canned,
roasted coffee would drop by 20 cents a pound.
   On other markets, pork futures plunged their permitted daily
limits; corn and soybean futures rallied strongly; and precious
metals advanced.
   Oil futures were not traded Monday because the New York
Mercantile Exchange was closed for the Independence Day holiday. All
of the nation's commodity exchanges were scheduled to be closed on
Tuesday.
   Green, unroasted coffee settled 6 cents to 16.07 cents lower on
New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange with the contract for
delivery in July at 97.63 cents a pound and the most active
contract, for September delivery, at 93.84 cents a pound. It was the
lowest close since mid-1981, when coffee futures sank as low as
80.50 cents a pound.
   The collapse was triggered by the International Coffee
Organization's decision to suspend quotas on exports of coffee from
its producer members to its consumer members. The decision came
after representatives of the 74 nations that comprise the
organization, meeting in London, failed to muster majority support
for either of two proposals for a new agreement to succeed the
6-year pact that expires Sept. 30.
   Both failed proposals would have retained a quota system for
stabilizing coffee prices. Instead, the group approved a 2-year
extension of the current agreement, minus the quotas, which will
keep the organization alive as a record-keeping body.
   The largest coffee-consuming nations, including the United
States, had opposed any new agreement that did not increase the
availability of high-quality arabica coffees. Consumer nations also
wanted tighter restrictions on sales of coffee at cut-rate prices to
countries that are not members of the organization.
   Quotas have been suspended twice before, for a total of 8{ years,
since the ICO was established in 1963. The most recent suspension,
which ended in October 1987, lasted about 1{ years.
   Ruiz said the suspension of quotas will increase the availability
of high-quality coffees at lower prices, citing indications that
some of the major South American and Central American coffee
producers are sitting on large stockpiles.
   But other analysts said the world coffee surplus could be much
smaller than some believe and that there was no reason to assume the
coffee market will soon be flooded.
   ``The market had a very hysterical reaction and it was mostly
speculative,'' said an analyst for a large trade house who asked not
to be named. ``I don't think it necessarily means anything.''
   Pork futures tumbled their permitted daily limits on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in reaction to Friday's quarterly Agriculture
Department hogs-and-pigs report, which showed more animals than the
market had expected.
   Live cattle were .22 cent to .55 cent lower with August at 69.82
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent to .65 cent lower with
August at 80.35 cents a pound; live hogs were 1.50 cents lower
across the board with July at 47.17 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 2 cents lower across the board with July at 33.85 cents
a pound.
   Corn and soybean futures surged on the Chicago Board of Trade
amid forecasts for an extended spell of hot, dry weather in the
Midwest.
   ``Some forecasters don't see any rain at all for the next week or
so,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 2} cents lower with July at $3.94{ a
bushel; corn was 4\ cents to 8} cents higher with July at $2.72 a
bushel; oats were 7{ cents to 8 cents higher with July at $1.57 a
bushel; soybeans were 5{ cents to 19 cents higher with July at
$7.40{ a bushel.
   Gold and silver futures posted strong gains on New York's
Commodity Exchange, largely in reaction to the weaker dollar.
   Gold settled $3.70 to $3.80 higher with August at $381.10 a troy
ounce; silver was 7.1 cents to 7.5 cents higher with July at $5.23 a
troy ounce.

<HEAD>High Court Refuses to Let Officials Regulate Cable TV Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday refused to let
officials in Burlington, Vt., regulate the rates a cable television
company charges customers in that city.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that federal law
barred the local officials from setting cable TV rates.
   Burlington officials in June 1985 signed a contract with Mountain
Cable Co. to provide cable service to city residents.
   Mountain Cable took over the city cable franchise after acquiring
the company that had provided the service. Burlington has had cable
TV service since the 1950s.
   City officials said the agreement between the city and Mountain
Cable barred the company from raising customer rates until Dec. 29,
1987.
   The company raised its monthly rate from $10.50 to $12.50 on Jan.
1, 1987.
   The Vermont Supreme Court ruled last year that a federal law that
took effect Oct. 30, 1984, barred the city from regulating cable TV
rates.
   Burlington officials said the federal law limiting local rate
regulation was aimed only at ``franchising authorities.''
   The city officials argued that a Vermont state agency, the Public
Service Board, had the power to award franchises. Therefore, they
said, the city should be free to control rates charged by Mountain
Cable.
   The state court said, ``While the city may be correct in arguing
that the Public Service Board is a franchising authority here, the
city is also a franchising authority within the meaning of the
(federal) act.''
   The case is Burlington vs. Mountain Cable, 88-1816.

   Canola may become an economic lifesaver
for farmers in the South and Midwest as the low-fat cooking oil
squeezed from the plant's seeds becomes more popular with
health-conscious consumers.
   Canola oil is lower in saturated fat than other popular cooking
oils, including coconut oil, soybean oil and corn oil, experts say.
   Saturated fat has been linked to cholesterol, a substance that
can contribute to clogged arteries and heart disease.
   ``We think it will be a viable crop for the mid-South and at
yields that will be successful for economic returns,'' said John F.
Bradley, superintendent of the University of Tennessee Agriculture
Experiment Station at Milan. ``It will give our farmers in this area
an alternative crop.
   ``We are not saying it's going to be the salvation of the farmer
but it is real promising,'' he said.
   Canola is a variety of rapeseed, from which the oil is squeezed.
   Canada and Europe are the largest producers of canola. Before
1985, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration listed the seed's oil as
toxic to humans and banned its growth. But genetic engineering
produced an edible variety and the FDA removed the restrictions.
   ``This released us from having to import from Canada and
Europe,'' Bradley said. ``We have found that it can be grown in the
mid-South and the Midwest.''
   Nevertheless, only about 70,000 acres are now grown in the United
States. U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics show 440 million
pounds of canola oil were imported this year.
   Researchers say canola's seed production is high and that on a
profit basis it outperforms soybeans.
   Kentucky and Illinois are the chief producers of canola in the
United States. Kentucky growers planted about 2,000 acres of canola
in 1987, then 8,000 acres as it caught on in 1988, according to a
study by the University of Kentucky.
   Farmers in Indiana, Tennessee, Ohio and Michigan so far have only
dabbled in the crop. But Bradley believes over the next five years
canola will become commonplace throughout the mid-South.
   Canola has become more popular with consumers recently as health
concerns have arisen over the use of tropical oils, found to be high
in saturated fats.
   ``I think we will see probably more people going over to canola
oil as their cooking oil,'' said Wayne Flinchum, professor of plant
and soil science at the University of Tennessee Agriculture
Extension Service in Jackson, Tenn.
   ``I don't think we will see a shift by the billions, but you'll
see more and more people over time shift to canola oil as their
deep-fat frying oil.'' Food companies have begun switching to canola
and other lower-fat oils in response to concerns over health risks
associated with highly saturated tropical oils. Procter &amp; Gamble's
Puritan brand cooking oil is 100 percent canola oil, and a company
spokesman said demand is good and is expected to grow.
   The taste of canola oil differs slightly from soybean oil and
will develop a fishy taste if used for more than one frying, said
Sharon Melton, a professor of food technology and science at the
University of Tennessee at Knoxville.
   Before Canola, which grows best from October through June, wheat
was the only crop that could be grown in the winter.
   Canola yields about the same amount or slightly less per acre
than wheat and uses the same equipment and supplies, such as
herbicides.
   The growing season is also attractive because domestic canola is
harvested in summer just after Canadian farmers have planted their
crop.
   It also brings more per bushel at current market prices than
winter wheat _ about $7 per bushel of canola versus $4 per bushel of
wheat, Bradley said.
   Perhaps the only problem is making farmers aware of canola.
   ``Farmers are real traditional and it takes them awhile to try
something new,'' Bradley said.

   James A. Linen IV, executive vice president
of Media General Inc. and head of the Richmond-based company's
broadcast operations, died in London from injuries suffered in a
jogging accident.
   Linen, 51, died early Sunday in Westminster Hospital, officials

   Linen, vacationing in London for the Wimbledon tennis
championships, was hit by a van in a pedestrian crosswalk as he was
jogging Wednesday. Authorities said Linen suffered multiple
fractures and massive internal injuries, and that he died from
pulmonary dysfunction.
   A native of Scranton, Pa., and a 1960 graduate of Yale
University, Linen joined Media General, which publishes the Richmond

   He was promoted to senior vice president in 1981, and four years

   Morton Thiokol Inc. completed the spinoff of its

new name Thiokol Corp., the company said.
   The new company set up to handle the non-aerospace businesses
will be called Morton International Inc. and its shares will be

   Thiokol will keep the company's aerospace divisions and will have
its headquarters in Ogden, Utah. Morton International will have its
base of operations in Chicago, where Morton Thiokol had its
headquarters.
   Shareholders will receive one share of Morton International
common stock for every share of Morton Thiokol held, the company
said.
   In addition, Thiokol, also to be traded on the New York exchange,
announced a two-for-five reverse split of Morton Thiokol shares.
   The spinoff and name change, announced in February, returns the
company to its roots, in a sense. Morton Thiokol was formed in 1982
from the merger of Morton-Norwich Products Inc. and Thiokol Corp.
   The company's troubled aerospace division made the booster
rockets that were blamed for the explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger in 1986.

   Officials said the cash tender offer calls for payment of $11.50
a share to the holders of 28.7 million shares, or 91.3 percent of
GNC's outstanding common stock, on or before Monday.
   The tender offer is to be followed by a merger in which remaining
common stock will be exchanged for preferred stock.
   GNC Chairman Jerry D. Horn said the company's management was
``extremely pleased'' by the deal.
   ``Our commitment to enhance shareholder value while providing
General Nutrition with a new, more growth-oriented investor base has
been realized,'' Horn said.
   Horn said the $11.50 tender price represents a 48 percent premium
over the market price of GNC stock on March 23, the day before GNC
said it was considering selling the company.
   Neither Lee nor GNC officials said how the sale would affect the
company's management or its operations, which include 1,100 stores
nationwide.
   GNC's shares rose 37.5 cents Monday to close at $10.75 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Thomas H. Lee and ML-Lee own or partly own Playtex Family
Products Co., Stanley Interiors Corp., National Shoes and American
Health Cos.
   GNC said it wanted to sell the company as an amicable way to
resolve differences between management, which wanted to expand the
company, and the family of late founder David Shakarian, which
controls 57 percent of the company's stock.
   One shareholder filed suit Monday in Allegheny County Common
Pleas Court to block the sale.
   Peter Stuyvesant Ltd., a Philadelphia investment group, claims
that the Thomas H. Lee offer is ``grossly unfair and inadequate''
and does not reflect the instrinsic value and growth potential of
GNC. No date has been set for the hearing on Stuyvesant's claim.
