<BYLINE>Apprehension Tempers Celebration by Romanians in U.S. ^By JOSEPH
NEFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   About 400 Romanian-Americans sipped champagne in
a rally to celebrate the downfall Friday of Romanian President
Nicolae Ceausescu, but their joy was tempered by continued
bloodshed in their homeland.
   ``I have mixed feelings about the overthrow,'' said Lumi Sava, a
rally organizer. ``It's extremely sad that so much innocent blood
was spilled _ women and children. It's a high price for freedom,
but's it's worth it.''
   Thousands of civilians have been reported killed in Romania
since the revolt against the last Soviet bloc dictator began Dec.
15 in the western city of Timisoara. Hundreds more reportedly died
Friday in the uprising that sent Ceausescu fleeing from the
presidential palace.
   In New York, demonstrators gathered in 12-degree cold across the
street from the Romanian mission to the United Nations, the same
spot where many of them have held nightly protests against
Ceausescu since the upheaval in their homeland began.
   The ralliers sipped champagne from plastic cups, waved red, blue
and yellow Romanian flags _ minus the socialist symbol _ and
chanted ``Victory, Victory.''
   Speakers addressed the crowd in Romanian and English, presenting
their demands for a completely new Romanian government. Sava called
on the U.S. government to send emergency medical and food aid to
Romania.
   ``Blood is especially needed _ we have heard that Ceausescu
bombed the blood bank and main hospital in Bucharest,'' she said.
   Sava said the coalition Romania 21 would ask the U.S. government
to seize the assets of the Romanian government in this country, to
set up a congressional observation team to report on what happened
in Romania, and to bring Ceausescu to trial in the U.N. Security
Council.
   Some members of the crowd were able to reach friends and
relatives in Romania by telephone Friday.
   ``My mother was crying _ all she could say was `I'm free',''
said Horia Dugala, 26, who spoke with his mother in Brasov on
Friday afternoon.
   After hours of trying to contact his family by phone, Radu
Tuian, 32, reached a friend in Bucharest.
   ``The most important thing was that he could speak freely for
the first time,'' Tuian said. ``After 45 years of darkness, they
came out into the light.''
   Mircea Ionescu, a playwright who fled his country after his
works were banned by the Ceausescu regime, said Romanians will be
able to celebrate Christmas openly for the first time since the end
of World War II,
   ``But it's not Christmas _ it's bloody Christmas,'' said
Ionescu, editor of the Romanian-language weekly Lumea Noastra.
Still, he added, ``Now I'm proud of being Romanian.''
   A demonstration celebrating the revolt also is planned Sunday at
Chicago's City Hall. An estimated 20,000 Romanian emigres live in
the Chicago area.
   ``For us this is really the biggest day of our lives,'' said
Rodica Perciali, director of the Romanian Folk Art Museum in
suburban Evanston, Ill. But she too expressed remorse at the loss
of life in the upheaval.
   Mrs. Perciali said Romanians had felt ashamed as the rest of
Eastern Europe enacted sweeping reforms of their communist
governments.
   ``We felt guilty and also powerless _ we almost lost hope to see
any change in Romania,'' she said.

   Here is a brief summary of events in Romania:
   _The 24-year reign of President Nicolae Ceausescu collapsed as a
citizen uprising was joined by rebellious troops. A top defense
official who joined the rebels said they controlled most of the
country, with only scattered resistance.
   _Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, fled the presidential palace by
helicopter. Some reports said they had been arrested; others
indicated their whereabouts were unknown.
   _Ceausescu's son, the interior minister, the chief of the secret
police and other key figures of the regime were arrested.
   _Fighting continued into Saturday between rebel troops and
security forces loyal to Ceausescu in Bucharest and elsewhere in
the country.
   _Hundreds were reported killed in the fighting, in addition to
the thousands believed killed earlier in the week of unrest.
   _A National Salvation Committee was formed to run the country
temporarily.
   _Jubilant Romanians rallied in Bucharest and throughout the
country.
   _Hundreds of people dug up mass graves near Timisoara, in
western Romania, in search of as many as 4,500 people killed last
weekend when protesters were massacred by security forces.
   _The Bush administration said a ``terrible burden'' had been
lifted from the Romanian people and expressed hope for a peaceful
transition to democracy.
   _The European Community foreign ministers pledged immediate aid
to Romania and the Red Cross in Geneva flew four tons of medical
supplies to Bucharest.

   William C. Greenough, developer of the
variable-annuity pension and one-time head of the biggest pension
fund in the United States, died Wednesday of complications from a
heart attack. He was 75.
   Greenough was president and then chairman of the Teachers
Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund
from 1957 until his retirement in 1979.
   He put forward the idea of a variable-annuity stock fund in the
early 1950s when he was vice president of the fund. The approach
was based on his perception that over the long run a diverse
portfolio of common stocks would outperform traditional pensions.
   Greenough was also a director of the New York Stock Exchange for
10 years beginning in 1972 and in 1979 served on President Carter's
Commission on Pension Policy.

   A Thai Airways Boeing 747 made an unscheduled
landing here after two of its three inertial navigation systems
malfunctioned and the plane flew more than 600 miles off course,
the Federal Aviation Administration said.
   The errant Flight 741, en route from Seattle to Tokyo, was
spotted by the Anchorage International Airport air-traffic control
center, said FAA spokesman Paul Steucke.
   He said a controller gave directions to the nearest FAA
navigation aid, at St. Paul Island in the Bering Sea, about 800
miles southwest of Anchorage, so the captain of the jet could
establish its location.
   After learning that the plane carrying 319 people lacked fuel to
reach Tokyo, the controller provided directions to Anchorage,
Steucke said.
   Problems with the jetliner's inertial navigation systems were
discovered when FAA inspectors checked them after the plane reached
Anchorage, he said.
   The navigation devices were replaced in Anchorage and the plane
continued on to Seattle, where passengers transfered to a
Tokyo-bound flight, officials said.
   In 1983, Korean Airlines Flight 007 was shot down by a Soviet
warplane after it ranged more than 100 miles off course over the
Siberian island of Sakhalin, killing all 269 people aboard.
   It was speculated at the time that a failure of the plane's
navigation systems might have figured in the course error, but a
federal jury ruled in August that the victims' families could
collect damages for the flight crew's ``willful misconduct.''

<HEAD>Lyme Disease Test Results Vary Widely in New Jersey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wide discrepancies surfaced in results of
Lyme disease tests last year, indicating a crying need for
standardization to help in diagnosis and research, a new study says.
   ``The low agreement among laboratories has many implications for
the diagnosis of Lyme disease and for future research in this
field,'' researchers say in an article appearing Friday's issue of
the Journal of the American Medical Association. ``Finally, the
economic implications are of concern and need to be addressed.''
   In an accompanying editorial, Louis Magnarelli of the
Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven says
commercial test kits should be evaluated and state or federal
proficiency testing for laboratories is ``critically needed.''
   The study focused on tests performed on New Jersey residents.
About 90,000 tests for Lyme disease were performed last year in the
state at a cost of $3.5 million, the researchers reported. Patients
were charged $35 to $63.
   ``As the test is increasing in use, it's important to take a
step back and see how the laboratories are agreeing on those
tests,'' said the study's lead author, Dr. Brian Schwartz, formerly
of the University of Pennsylvania and now with Johns Hopkins
University.
   Lyme disease, named for the Connecticut town where it was first
documented in 1975, can cause rashes, headaches and sore muscles,
and if not detected early, arthritis and heart irregularities. It
can be treated with antibiotics.
   The disease is spread through tiny deer ticks and is most common
in suburban and rural wooded areas.
   According to the Centers for Disease Control, 4,572 cases of
Lyme disease were reported in 1988, almost double the 2,368 in
1987. The CDC said only nine states, all west of the Mississippi
River, have not reported Lyme disease.
   For the study, blood specimens from 132 workers of the New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection were sent to four
laboratories _ a state Department of Health laboratory, one large
commerical lab near Philadelphia and two research centers. The
researchers compared results among the four labs and among samples
sent to the same laboratory.
   All participants had at least two tests, 105 had at least three
and 100 had at least four blood samples taken. The laboratories
used one of two common types of tests.
   The laboratories had a ``low to moderate'' level of agreement
and the results from different samples sent to the same lab showed
similar discrepancies, according to the study.
   The researchers said the discrepancies arose from subjective
interpretations of results, differences in how blood specimens were
prepared, the non-standardized tests and the unreliability of tests
adminstered shortly after a person shows the first symptoms of Lyme
disease.
   The lack of standardized tests harms not only humans who may be
infected, but impedes research on the disease, according to Dr.
Daniel Cohen, associated dean of Penn's veterinary school.
   ``There is a real need for the U.S. government to step in and
standardize the tests,'' Cohen said. ``It's very difficult to pass
judgment'' on comparing research based on different standards.
   The study shows physicians should not rely only on current
laboratory tests, which do not always diagnose the disease in its
early stages, according to Magnarelli.
   ``The clinical picture should come first,'' followed by
laboratory testing for confirmation, Magnarelli said Thursday,
   ``We now have antibody tests of varying sensitivity and
specificity values, and it is not surprising that interlaboratory
comparisons of test resuls often show poor agreement,'' he wrote.
``When one considers the health-care dollars spent on serological
testing, these discrepancies do not rest well with the medical
community or the public.''

<HEAD>Posthumous Court Victory For AIDS Victim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who died of AIDS won a posthumous legal
victory in his fight with a nail salon that refused to give him a
pedicure.
   The state Court of Appeals on Wednesday upheld the
constitutionality of a West Hollywood ordinance that bans
discrimination against people with acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   Paul Jasperson had sued Jessica's Nail Salon for cancelling his
July 1986 appointment for a pedicure after he mentioned to a client
that he had AIDS.
   ``I'm just overwhelmed with happiness. I spoke at his funeral.
... All of us wanted to win this for Paul and for the millions of
people with AIDS,'' his attorney, Gloria Allred, said Thursday.
   In a March 1988 Los Angeles County Superior Court ruling, a
judge found that Jasperson was denied service because of his
illness, but refused to issue an injunction.
   Judge Lawrence Waddington ruled that the pedicure potentially
exposed salon workers to AIDS, and the risk, though marginal, was
unacceptable.
   Jasperson, 37, died of AIDS in May, but his appeal continued.
   On Wednesday, the three-member Second Circuit Court of Appeals
court ruled 2-1 to reverse the lower court ruling and enforce the
ordinance.
   The court said the ordinance, by preventing discrimination,
serves a public health function by encouraging those with AIDS to
make their illness known to ``providers of personal services,'' who
then can take precautions.
   ``This case was extremely important, because we were seeking to
enforce the West Hollywood city ordinance which had been used as a
model and copied by many other cities throughout the nation,'' Ms.
Allred said.
   Attorneys for Santa Monica and Los Angeles, which have similar
ordinances, had filed briefs on behalf of Jasperson, as did the
city of West Hollywood and the American Civil Liberties Union of
Southern California.

   This final part of a three-part Christmas series
is about the big Galilean family of which Jesus was a part.

   Baffled and sometimes upset by Jesus' independent streak, his
family tried to curb him. ``Even his brothers did not believe
him,'' the record says. But they stuck by him, eventually becoming
pillars of his cause.
   A putative aunt sought to curry preferential status for her
sons, supposed cousins, but he wouldn't play favorites. When still
a boy of l2, he distressed his elders by quitting them to converse
with Temple scholars.
   ``Son, why have you treated us so?'' his mother remonstrated,
noting that she and her husband, Joseph, had hunted him for three
days. They did not understand his explanation about being drawn to
God's house.
   The push-and-pull of those closest and dearest is a common
experience in the best of families. That sort of pressure rimmed
Jesus' life _ the chafing, caring concern of relatives. He had many
in that small close-knit enclave of Israel, bound together by its
belief in one God in a pagan world.
   Relationships, near and distant, pervaded that tiny, insulated
society. It was a hemmed-off, connected household, especially in
Jesus' rural hometown of Nazareth in upland Galilee.
   ``A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and
among his own kin, and in his own house,'' he said, indicating the
negative reactions of ``kin'' to his newly launched ministry.
   He ``marveled because of their disbelief,'' Mark's gospel notes.
   His family must have been aghast when Nazareth townspeople
dragged him angrily from the synagogue after his first sermon about
liberty for captives and the oppressed and ``good news to the
poor.''
   Neighors intended to hurl him from a cliff, but stopped at the
last moment, hesitating. His gaze burned into them, and they shrank
back, opening a path for him. He walked away, never going home
again.
   He ``who loves father or mother'' or ``son or daughter more than
me is not worthy of me,'' he said, adding that his truth requires
greater devotion than to parents, wife, children, brothers, sisters
or even to one's ``own life.''
   His immediate family included a flock of ``brothers and
sisters,'' the record says, naming James, Joses, Judas and Simon,
plus an unspecified number of sisters.
   Differences exist about their exact relationship because of
Catholic belief in Mary's perpetual virginity. Some hold that the
brothers and sisters were offspring of Joseph by a previous
marriage, though this is without biblical support.
   It also has been claimed they were cousins in the loose
terminology of ancient times. In any case, a batch of them were
linked in Scripture with Joseph and Mary and obviously shared an
upbringing with Jesus.
   Scripture, in saying Jesus was Mary's ``first-born son,''
implies she later had others, and in saying Joseph ``knew her not
until she had borne a son,'' implies subsequent marital relations.
Whichever, it was a big family.
   It tried to deter Jesus' ministry at the outset. Distressed by
talk that he was ``beside himself,'' his family descended on a
synagogue where he was preaching, intending to seize him.
   When word reached him that ``your mother and your brothers are
outside, asking for you,'' the personal pain of it must have torn
him. He lowered his head momentatily, then spread his arms wide and
said:
   ``Who are my mother and my brothers?'' His gesture embraced
everyone. ``Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does the
will of God is my brother, and sister and mother.''
   A poignant interlude, it projected Jesus' work beyond intimate
bonds to humanity at large. But it must have hurt. Such steps are
never without pain, said the late theologian Paul Tillich.
   Noting that the ``depth of the gap'' between him and his family
became acute only with the start of his public ministry, Tillich
added:
   ``Something unconditional breaks into the conditional relations
of the natural family and creates a community which is as intimate
and strong as the family relations, and at the same time infinitely
superior to it.''
   Jesus' apparently rich aunt is identified in three of the
gospels _ John referring to ``his mother's sister,'' Mark to
``Salome'' and Matthew to the ``mother of the sons of Zebedee.''
   Zebedee ran a properous fishing fleet on the Sea of Galilee and
two of his sons, James and John, quit the business to become
disciples of Jesus, presumably also cousins. Salome evidently was
among wealthy women who supported Jesus ``out of their means.''
   That James and John were cousins is further indicated when
Jesus, on the cross, assigned care of his mother to John, a family
responsibility not likely to be placed outside blood ties.
   Salome was a strong-minded, practical woman, something of a
firebrand like her sons, whom Jesus nicknamed ``sons of thunder.''
She also was ambitious, and she saw majestic prospects for Jesus.
   While some relatives doubted his course, she felt sure of it,
even though misconstruing his goal as a restored Jewish kingdom.
She wanted some key places reserved for family.
   She put it bluntly, a senior to a younger clan member. ``Command
that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one
at your left, in your kingdom.''
   Jesus looked fondly at his aunt and slowly shook his head. ``You
do not know what you are asking.'' It aroused jealousy among his
apostles. He told them his domain would not be run like the Roman
occupation _ by force and domination.
   Impatience also was registered by Jesus' ``brothers.'' His
growing impact in rural Galilee impressed them, John 7 notes, and
they proposed he go to Jerusalem for a coming festival to establish
himself at the heart of Judaism if he could.
   ``Leave here and go to Judea,'' they urged, suggesting somewhat
skeptically that if his works were genuine he could gain greater
fame. ``For no man works in secret if he seeks to be known openly.
If you do these things, show yourself to the world.''
   He looked at them affectionately, reading their doubts. ``My
time has not yet come, but your time is always here ... Go to the
feast yourselves.''
   Later, however, he went. Curious crowds besieged him, leading to
his crucifixion by Roman authorities, and his resurrection.
   That event transformed his brothers, binding them to him in
unwavering loyalty. The oldest brother, called James the Just,
became head of the church in Jerusalem, his leadership ranked above
the 12 apostles.
   He presided over the church's first council, which widened doors
of the new faith beyond Jews to Gentiles, to all the world. Many
scholars ascribe to him the biblical epistle of James with its call
to apply Jesus' teachings in deeds.
   ``Be doers of the word,'' he wrote. ``Faith, if it has no works,
is dead.''
   After James was slain in rising revolutionary tides of the early
A.D. 60s, church historian Eusebius says, another brother of Jesus,
Simon, took over church leadership in Jerusalem.
   Initially unresponsive, relatives became mainstays of the
world-girdling faith Jesus started. However, he says the principle
relationship extends beyond blood to all believers.
   ``I am the vine,'' he said, ``you are the branches.''

   From the blue-collar housing projects
of cockney east London to the gardens of the gentry, grown men scan
the skies for hours most weekends, waiting for their pigeons to
race home.
   They rhapsodize about pigeon racing, the sport known as ``the
fancy'' and now one of Britain's more popular pastimes.
   ``All you see is a pinprick in the sky,'' said Maj. Edward
Camilleri. ``They fly toward you and you hope its yours. Then they
fold their wings, they drop out of the sky, they literally do. They
come straight down like bullets.''
   Says Bernie Bennett, who has 60 pigeons: ``Unless you're a
pigeon fancier, you just find it very hard to understand, to see a
person out in the garden, like me yesterday, bucketing down with
rain, looking for pigeons to come from 100 miles.
   ``With pigeons I find one thing and one thing only: You're the
jury, you're the prosecution, you are the judge. All that happens
down in your backyard is down to you.''
   Camilleri, a retired soldier who runs the Royal Pigeon Racing
Association, estimates Britain has more than 200,000 pigeon
breeders and racers among its 56 million people.
   Nearly 2 million pigeons, many with meticulously documented
pedigrees dating back several avian generations, are registered
with Camilleri's association alone.
   The sport has an honorable history: The ancient Egyptians kept
pigeons; Hannibal took them over the Alps; they served in both
world wars, carrying messages for the Allied intelligence forces in
Europe. Thirty-one pigeons were awarded the Dickens Medal, the
``Animal Victoria Cross,'' in World War II.
   In Britain, pigeons were traditionally associated with
beer-drinking, cloth-capped men, but it has moved upmarket in
recent years, attracting lawyers, actors and titans of industry. At
the top end of the scale, Queen Elizabeth II maintains a pigeon
loft.
   Britain's largest pigeon breeder, Louella Pigeon World, is a
high-tech enterprise that paid a world record 77,000 pounds
($120,120) in 1988 for the racing pigeon Emerald II.
   ``That, pound for pound, makes it more valuable than the Derby
winner,'' Camilleri said, referring to Britain's most prestigious
horse race.
   Emerald II is moved from one secret location to another, because
with the large sums sometimes at stake in bets and prize money,
sabotage and pigeon-napping are not unheard of.
   However, high prices don't always guarantee success, Camilleri
said, and a good racing pigeon can start as low as 20 pounds ($32).
   ``Stockmanship comes into it, knowing and understanding
pigeons,'' he explained. ``They all have their individual
characters and what you've got to do is understand their character
well enough and encourage them to come home quicker than the next
pigeon.''
   No one knows exactly how pigeons they find their way home after
being released, sometimes hundreds of miles away.
   ``The sun is definitely one (factor) and magnetic field is
definitely a second,'' Camilleri said. Research in Europe indicates
the sense of smell also may help.
   There's also a very basic urge.
   Most pigeons in Britain are kept on the ``widowhood system.'' As
soon as a hen and cock produce a pair of young, or squeakers,
they're separated. Only the males are raced, and the only time they
get to see their hens is when they return to the loft at the end of
a race.
   Each fancier's loft is registered and the distance between it
and any of the 200 official British ``liberation sites'' measured
to the nearest yard.
   Pigeons are bundled into baskets, sometimes the night before a
race, and taken to the liberation site in air-conditioned trucks.
Each wears a rubber band about the size of a wedding ring on its
leg with the details of where it came from.
   The pigeons are all released at the same time. They ascend
rapidly, quickly become oriented and head for home.
   When they land, the fancier removes the rubber band and puts it
in a timeclock that is sealed and taken to the local racing club.
The flight distance is divided by the time it took to determine who
won the race.
   What is it about pigeons that engenders such passion and loyalty?
   ``The fascination about it: You get a few pigeons, you start
winning races, and from then on it's a lot like horse racing, only
cheaper,'' Camilleri said.
   ``You can pit your wits against nature.''

<TEXT>
   It would seem at first glance that Lille
Berger has much to be thankful for this Christmas.
   An amnesty for political prisoners has freed her younger son,
and the parting of the Berlin Wall has brought home the older one
she feared she'd never see after his escape to the West in July.
   Like many East Germans, Mrs. Berger is grateful for the first
fruits of reform that have eased a life of torment and allowed a
holiday reunion of her family.
   But the division of Germany now runs through her heart, with one
son lost to a new life in Hamburg and the other committed to the
revolt for change at home.
   ``I have nothing to be happy about this Christmas,'' said Mrs.
Berger, whose lined face and red-rimmed eyes testify to 53 years of
hardship and worry. ``For me, this year has been like 1945.
Everything in my life has been ruined.''
   Despite the heartening hurtle toward democracy that has
engendered new hope for a united Berlin, an atmosphere of anxiety
pervades both sides of the city deeply scarred by four decades of
division.
   Christmas and the approaching new year are a time for
reflection, and burdened and preoccupied Berliners this year are
counting mixed blessing.
   A glittering consumer wonderland has danced before the eyes of
millions now free to travel West, to see what they cannot yet have.
   Champagne celebrations and the euphoric street party that
erupted when the wall fell on Nov. 9 have given way to West Berlin
resentment of the daily invasions of frustrated consumers.
   ``My daughter is a physician who earns a good salary and has
everything our life has to offer. But she says she feels like a
second-class citizen when she comes here,'' said Maria Schwage, 74,
of Dresden, who was shopping with her grandson at West Berlin's
famed Ka-De-We department store.
   ``As a pensioner I was able to travel before the reforms, and I
must say the atmosphere is now very different,'' she said.
   No East German visitor can miss the discouraging glance of the
red-haired hostess passing out Christmas cake nibbles as inducement
to buy gourmet ``baumkuchen'' for $17, a fortune in the eyes of
most East Germans.
   Cheap goods like $5 umbrellas and fake gold necklaces have been
relegated to sidewalk sales bins, encouraging the crowds of
cash-short East Germans to do their window shopping outside.
   Little remains for the holiday season of West Berliners' spirit
of sharing that choked millions with emotion seven weeks ago, when
Stalinist bounds were broken by the forces for freedom.
   ``There is a lot of dissatisfaction over the hectic nature of
this Christmas,'' said Ziegfried Kasper, a West Berlin cab driver
born in a far corner of the former German empire in what is now
Soviet Russia.
   ``As an immigrant myself, I feel empathy for those coming
over,'' Kasper added. ``But this is not the kind of reunification
many people expected.''
   East and West Berlin have been released from forced division,
but their differences remain apparent and will take years to
overcome.
   West Berlin is awash in light and bustle, its neon-flanked
shopping boulevards strewn with fresh evergreens, its light
standards beribboned in red, gold and green.
   Handmade ornaments are hawked from rustic wooden booths at the
central Christmas market and an aroma of plenty fills the damp,
cold air, pungent with hot-spiced wine and sizzling sausages.
   Along East Berlin's Karl Marx Allee, a monotony of white lights
illuminates the grime of the coal-dusted city that is ominously
quiet in the last days before Christmas.
   Poorly stocked stores are being spurned this year by a people
set free on the West, and political turmoil has cast a shadow of
uncertainty over the very survival of the East German nation.
   ``What I feel mostly is fear,'' said Ursula Engel, a
well-traveled researcher for Leipzig's Institute for Foreign
Studies. ``No one knows where we are going, yet we are racing ahead
with all speed.``
   With the breaching of the wall a bitterness has been loosed
among many of the middle-aged, who have sacrificed their prime
years to a socialist system now being swept into the scrapheap of
history.
   ``No one can give me my life back,'' said Gabriela Kleiner, 42,
a translator of Russian novels who expects little improvement
during her lifetime. ``We have hope for the future, but this will
be enjoyed only by our children and grandchildren.''
   Hope tempered by uncertainty rides higher with the very young,
who have time on their side in the long struggle for prosperity.
And the elderly who have lived through the Nazi period and 40 years
of socialism have little fear of what democracy could have in store
for them.
   Sylvia Deutschmann, 26, a file clerk and mother of two, hasn't
spent much time thinking about the consequences of the reform
movement dominating East German politics and the media.
   ``We're all hopeful that conditions will change for the
better,'' she said, perusing the slim pickings of her neighborhood
grocer's at a grimy corner on Krausnickstrasse. ``But for now life
goes on as normal. I still have to get the kids fed and to bed each
night.''
   Like many young East Berliners, the Deutschmanns have made their
pre-Christmas trek to West Berlin to collect the $55 per person of
``welcome money'' from the West German government.
   The radio and leather fashions bought with the handout may make
their holiday a little brighter. But the drudgery of making ends
meet on small incomes in a ravaged economy will confront them with
reality soon after the start of the new year.
   ``No one would dispute that our lives are better now. We
suffered for 40 years,'' said Kostina Hoeft, an East Berlin
scientist watching workers prepare to cut a new hole in the wall
near the symbolic Brandenburg Gate.
   ``I think we are patient enough to wait through the next hard
years of recovery,'' she said. ``For those who have nothing there
is always hope.''

   In cardboard boxes and carefully sealed
envelopes, Leibl Koniuchowsky carried with him tales of the
Holocaust for more than four decades.
   The files, which meticulously document civilian Nazi
collaboration through eyewitness testimony, were known only to a
few Yiddish-speaking scholars and researchers as publishers
rejected Koniuchowsky's queries over the years.
   But his recent decision to donate the records to a Holocaust
archives in Israel has given Nazi hunters new leads on war crime
suspects and drawn attention to the civilian role in the mass
killings of European Jews during World War II.
   ``The Nazis signed the death papers, but the common people who
pulled the triggers are the greater murderers,'' the 80-year-old
Koniuchowsky said in an interview Wednesday at his home west of
Fort Lauderdale.
   ``It's something different to aim the gun and look into the eyes
of someone about to die,'' said Koniuchowsky, who lived in the
Lithuanian city of Kovno.
   His records are now at Jerusalem's Yad Vashem memorial, which is
documenting the slayings of an estimated 6 million Jews by Nazi
Germany.
   Koniuchowsky keeps a silver medal from Yad Vashem in its wood
and velvet case. English translations of some of his records are
stored under a bookshelf in his condominium.
   Nearby, a photograph shows a 19-year-old Koniuchowsky standing
behind his parents, who died in one of the killings of Jews across
Lithuania.
   ``Why I survived is just a miracle,'' he said. ``Long ago, I
stopped looking for answers.''
   The Baltic states were annexed into the Soviet Union under the
secret Molotov-Ribbentrop treaty of 1939. Following the war,
Koniuchowsky, a civil engineer, took a government job traveling the
Lithuanian countryside looking for salvageable machinery.
   He began to keep a diary of his conversations with Jews in the
villages. He would transcribe their descriptions of the executions
and record names of civilians the witnesses said had participated.
Hand-drawn maps and photographs of the mass grave sites were made.
Each page was signed by the person who was interviewed.
   Lithuania, a center of Jewish culture in Eastern Europe, had a
Jewish population of nearly 1.5 million at the turn of the century.
About 26,000 were left after World War II, according to Yad Vashem
records. More than 200,000 Jews are believed to have been killed by
the Nazis in Lithuania.
   ``Some places there were only one or two Jews left,'' said
Koniuchowsky. ``Their stories would have died with them if someone
didn't listen.''
   Koniuchowsky quit his job and spent four years traveling through
villages and refugee camps collecting stories from Jewish survivors
in Poland, Germany and Austria.
   The testimony of 153 Jews was gathered in nearly 1,700 pages
written in Yiddish. The records included the names of about 1,300
alleged Nazi collaborators and sympathizers.
   Koniuchowsky emigrated to New York in 1951 then moved to Israel
in the mid-1970s. He returned to the United States following a 1983
heart attack.
   Koniuchowsky's files are significant because few records exist
of Jewish killings in the small villages, said Efraim Zuroff,
director of the Jerusalem office of the Los Angeles-based Simon
Wiesenthal Center, which compiles records of the Holocaust and
assists in tracking down suspected war criminals.
   ``Based on our past experience this can lead us to numerous Nazi
war criminals now living in the United States, Canada, Australia
and the United Kingdom,'' Zuroff said Tuesday in Israel.
   Zuroff said the center will add names from Koniuchowsky's
records to the list of sought-after war criminals.
   ``After the war, everyone wanted to get the big guys, the top
Nazis,'' said Koniuchowsky. ``But I know that the real criminals
mostly got away. The people who did the killing walked away.''
   John Loftus, an author and former Justice Department war
criminal prosecutor, said the cvilian role in Nazi atrocities has
never been fully examined. Loftus's 1982 book ``The Belarus
Secret'' chronicles the paths to the West taken by those involved
in the massacre of nearly 40,000 Jews in the Belorussian section of
Eastern Europe.
   ``For every known war criminal there are many others who
committed horrible acts but were simply passed over because no one
was there to tell the story,'' said Loftus from his St. Petersburg
home.
   Koniuchowsky says he doesn't seek revenge. He decribes himself
only as a messenger with a sad tale.
   ``I did what I did because it was an order. It was an order
directly from those who were being taken to die,'' he said. ``They
would look back and shout, `Please remember us. Please don't
forget.'''

<TEXT>
   Candles flickered in the bitter cold
of a Scottish winter night, lit by still-grieving American
relatives to remember the 270 people killed one year ago in the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   The candle lanterns, provided by an Albany, N.Y., couple whose
only daughter died in the terrorist attack, cast a soft
illumination over a granite memorial bearing the names of each
victim.
   ``It's a beautiful memorial,'' said Paul Hudson, an attorney who
heads the American relatives support group Pan Am Flight
103-Lockerbie.
   ``I think most of us will be back here many times.''
   Later Thursday, many of the more than 20 Americans who crossed
the Atlantic attended a memorial service at the small stone
Tundergarth church three miles outside town, near where the plane's
blue-and-white nose cone smashed down.
   The Rev. Cameron Gibson called the bombing ``an act of
indescribable evil and wickedness'' and read the biblical passage,
``Vengeance is mine . . . saith the Lord.''
   The service concluded just about the time the Boeing 747
exploded last year, and some relatives made short pilgrimages to
the surrounding farms and fields where 90 bodies were recovered.
   Flight 103, bound for New York and Detroit, exploded in midair
at approximately 7:03 p.m. on the Wednesday before Christmas last
year, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground.
   Police say a bomb made of plastic explosives was concealed in a
radio-cassette recorder in a suitcase loaded into a forward cargo
hold.
   The dedication of the memorial by local clergymen began poignant
and somber commemorations that culminated in an outdoor ecumenical
service in Lockerbie's town square. No formal invitations were
issued, but U.S. Ambassador Henry Catto was present and Queen
Elizabeth II sent a representative.
   The lanterns, wax-coated paper bags filled with sand containing
a candle and each inscribed with the name of one of the victims and
the silhouette of a dove, were made for Hudson and his wife,
Eleanor, by students at the Albany Academy for Girls. Their
16-year-old daughter, Melina, had attended the school.
   As darkness fell, the lanterns lined both sides of the footpath
leading to and surrounding the Garden of Remembrance, the memorial
site carved from the local cemetery.
   Later outside the town hall, a temporary morgue in the days
following the disaster, more than one-third of the town's 3,500
residents gathered to hear the Rev. Patrick Keegan say, ``From this
disaster there is no complete recovery.''
   ``Quite simply, life cannot be the same again. It has changed.
We have changed,'' he said.
   ``To say that there is no recovery, that things won't get better
... is to say to the terrorists: `Here, you can have our lives as
well.'''
   Many of the American relatives wore simple blue-and-white lapel
buttons bearing the words ``Pan Am 103 _ The truth must be known.''
   Relatives in the United States and Britain have closely
monitored the police investigation in their campaign to bring the
bombers to justice and to improve airport security.
   Police confirm they have investigated the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command, and are interested in
Mohammed Abu Talb, a member of another radical Palestinian faction
sentenced Thursday to life in prison in Sweden on unrelated bombing
charges.

   A 3-week-old boy was reported missing from a
hospital Thursday night after his mother went to pick him up after
a brief treatment for an illness, hospital officials said.
   Ellis Lyles, born Nov. 28 in Norwegian-American Hospital Inc.,
was to be released Thursday night after a three-day hospitalization
for stomach problems, said hospital president Michael H. Sussman.
   ``When the mother came in to pick up the baby this evening, the
baby was not on the pediatric unit where he was supposed to be,''
Sussman said.
   The baby was last seen by hospital staff just before 8 p.m., the
hospital said.
   ``We are talking to the mother to find out if she knows of any
relative or friend that may have come in to see the baby before she
came in,'' Sussman said.
   He said the infant was taken home after he was born late last
month and was readmitted three days ago with acute gastroenteritis,
an inflammation of the stomach and intestines.
   Police said they had no information on the case.

   U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston announced Thursday
he has called off his plans to marry a 49-year-old woman on
Christmas Eve, a spokesman for his office said.
   The Democratic senator, under intense scrutiny for his role in
the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan scandal, said through a spokesperson
that the wedding would be unfair to his fiancee, Cathy Lee Pattiz
of Beverly Hills.
   ``When the press pounced upon us before we filled out the
marriage license forms, it became clear to me that this is not an
appropriate time to start a marriage and it would not be fair to
Cathy to bring her into the middle of a stressful situation, so we
will not be married on Dec. 24,'' Cranston said in a prepared
statement.
   Cranston, 75, surprised associates recently by announcing he
would marry Pattiz at his sister's home in Los Altos Hills. The
marriage would have been the third for Cranston, whose last
marriage ended in divorce in May, and the first for Pattiz, an
Illinois native who has known Cranton since 1968.
   No other details of the decision were immediatley available.
   The couple appeared smiling Tuesday when they posed for
photographs while taking out a marriage license in Palo Alto.
   Cranston is one of five U.S. senators under fire for accepting
large contributions from Charles Keating Jr., the conservative
Arizona financier who ran Lincoln. In 1987, the five interceded on
behalf of Keating with a federal regulator involved in probing
Lincoln, which declared bankruptcy last April.

<TEXT>
   Six years after U.S. troops invaded
Grenada and threw out a Marxist junta, the tiny Caribbean island
boasts a sturdy democracy but an expected economic bonanza has
failed to materialize.
   ``The story in Grenada has been a very mixed one,'' Larry Birns,
director of the Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs,
said in a telephone interview Thursday. ``One of the failures is
that Grenada hasn't developed a dependable economy.''
   ``It still faces a rather precarious future,'' he said.
   Just this week, Grenada _ the last country invaded by U.S.
troops before Panama _ demonstrated its commitment to parliamentary
democracy with a smooth transfer of power after the death of Prime
Minister Herbert Blaize.
   Blaize, 71, the first prime minister elected after the 1983
intervention, died Tuesday after a long illness. The same day,
Deputy Prime Minister Ben Jones was sworn in to head an interim
government and prepare for elections within 90 days in strict
accordance with the constitution.
   But the former British colony of 94,000 inhabitants on the
southern tip of the Caribbean chain has been going through a long
period of political uncertainty and economic difficulty.
   This month, 7,000 public workers staged a crippling one-week
general strike after Blaize reneged on a promise to pay them $9.25
million in back wages, saying the government did not have the money.
   In 1983, Grenada was ruled by a revolutionary regime allied with
Cuba and the Soviet Union. A power struggle within the government
led to a bloody coup and the firing-squad execution of Prime
Minister Maurice Bishop. The radical junta that seized power
imposed a 24-hour curfew.
   A force of U.S. Marines and paratroopers, numbering 7,000 at its
height, along with 300 soldiers and policemen from neighboring
Caribbean islands, invaded on Oct. 25, 1983, and quickly gained
control.
   The Reagan administration, already alarmed by Bishop's Soviet
and Cuban ties, said the invasion was necessary to protect the
lives of 480 American medical students and their families on
Grenada and to keep the island from being used as a staging post
for communist aggression in the region.
   Despite criticism abroad, the invasion was almost universally
welcomed by Grenadians, who refer to the operation as a ``rescue
mission'' and observe Oct. 25 as an annual holiday known as
Thanksgiving Day.
   Since 1983, the United States has pumped more than $110 million
into Grenada's economy with the stated aim of transforming the
island into a haven for American investment.
   But U.S. aid has dropped off sharply in the past few years and
only a handful of American companies have set up operations on the
island.
   ``Unfortunately, foreign and private investment has lagged
behind optimistic expectations ... and only recently have we seen
an increase in new projects,'' said a 1988 report by the Grenada
office of the U.S. Agency for International Development.
   Although the economy grew by a respectable 5.3 percent last
year, Grenada remained saddled with a foreign debt of $48.7
million, a domestic debt of $35.9 million and a trade deficit of
$59.6 million by the end of 1988, according to the Caribbean
Development Bank.
   Unemployment is officially pegged at around 20 percent, and
among youthful workers is estimated as high as 40 percent.
Alcoholism and drug addiction are said to have reached record
levels.
   The lucrative tourism business is growing, but business leaders
complain that Americans tend to avoid Grenada because of a lack of
direct flights and the island's lingering image as a war zone.
   Meanwhile, years of factional disputes over Blaize's handling of
the economy and his authoritarian style of leadership have left
Grenada's centrist political parties in disarray.
   The disunity raises the prospect of a split in the moderate vote
in the upcoming election and a possible comeback by Sir Eric Gairy,
the eccentric former prime minister once described by The Economist
magazine of London as a ``corrupt buffoon.'' Gairy was ousted in
1979 by leftist elements ultimately overthrown by the United States.
   ``If Gairy wins, we may very well be back to square one,'' Birns
said.

<HEAD>Lawyer: Plea Bargain in Imelda Marcos Case Discussed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for Imelda Marcos met with federal
prosecutors earlier this month to discuss a possible plea bargain
in the racketeering case against the widow of former Philippine
leader Ferdinand Marcos, an attorney said Thursday.
   John J. Tigue, a Marcos lawyer in New York, said a series of
discussions, initiated by the Philippine and United States
governments, took place in California over Dec. 9-12.
   He said the talks were ``preliminary chitchat. ... Nothing came
of it.
   ``In this sort of case, these things happen all the time.'' he
said.
   Tigue said Mrs. Marcos' defense team was still preparing for her
scheduled trial March 14 on charges she and her late husband
siphoned more than $100 million from the Philippines treasury and
funneled it into this country for the purchase of New York real
estate and art.
   According to Tigue, the proposed plea agreement called for Mrs.
Marcos to plead guilty to mail fraud and obstruction of justice
charges in exchange for a suspended prison term.
   Under the proposal, Mrs. Marcos would have to provide a full
financial disclosure and forfeit hundreds of millions of dollars in
assets, Tigue said. She also would have to remain on probation in
the United States as long as the current Philippine leader, Corazon
Aquino, was in power.
   Tigue said the prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles
LaBella, gave Mrs. Marcos until Jan. 12 to decide whether to accept
the plea agreement. He however, dismissed the date as an
``artificial deadline.''
   The attorney also said any settlement of the criminal charges
also would have to include several civil racketeering lawsuits
brought by the Philippine and U.S. government against the Marcoses.
   LaBella, reached in his office in New York, said he could not
comment on the reported plea bargain discussions.
   Tigue said Mrs. Marcos's attorney in San Francisco, John J.
Bartko, was her representative at the talks. Also present were
LaBella and representatives from the Philippine government, he
said. Bartko was not in his office Thursday and did not return
phone calls for comment.
   Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, one of Mrs. Marcos's
co-defendants in the racketeering case, said Thursday that he also
was aware that negotiations were taking place with Mrs. Marcos's
lawyers.
   Khashoggi, who was in court to formalize a change in attorneys,
said he had not had similar discussions. He said he was still
hoping to have the charges against him dismissed.
   ``I'd like to see an innocent man go free as soon as possible,''
said Khashoggi, who was released on $10 million bail while he
awaits trial.

<TEXT>
   After days of scouring Panama for Manuel
Antonio Noriega, U.S. forces still don't have their quarry. But
they do have a surplus of tips and rumors about the whereabouts of
the fugitive general, thanks largely to the posting of a $1 million
reward.
   The number of calls jamming U.S. military switchboards in Panama
rose sharply on Wednesday in response to the White House's
announcement that the money was available for anyone providing
information leading to Noriega's capture.
   ``We got lots of nibbles. A lot of it turned out to be very
bogus,'' said Rear Adm. Ted Sheafer, an intelligence specialist for
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Sheafer said callers reported sighting Noriega in at least 12
locations throughout Panama, 10 sites in Panama City and in three
foreign countries _ Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Mexico.
U.S. officials said, however, they believed Noriega had not left
the country.
   Noriega's wanted poster ``will be in every post office in
town,'' President Bush told reporters jokingly at a White House
news conference Thursday, adding that ``that's $1 million bucks I'd
be very happy to sign the check for.''
   But Noriega proved an elusive target for the commando forces and
intelligence analysts who set their traps for him.
   After rumors spread that Noriega or other members of the
Panamanian Defense Forces high command were in the Nicaraguan and
Cuban embassies, U.S. troops in armored personnel carriers
surrounded the two missions.
   But despite the massive dragnet for Noriega, aided by a force of
24,000 troops, U.S. hopes lay almost solely on reliable
intelligence information.
   ``We're looking for him very hard,'' said Lt. Gen. Tom Kelly,
the Pentagon's operations chief. ``Of course, that's all contingent
on intelligence.''
   American interrogators questioned hundreds of captured
Panamanian soldiers for clues about Noriega's plans, said one
official who asked not to be named.
   Kelly said American forces were ``turning on all our looking,
listening, and hearing devices to see if we can't pick'' up Noriega.
   The man in charge of the Panama strike, Lt. Gen. Carl W. Stiner,
who now commands the 18th Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, N.C.,
formerly headed the U.S. Special Operations Forces which are tasked
with commando-style activities.
   Special Forces units reportedly were deployed to look for
Noriega, aided by infantry troops of the 7th Army which are
especially trained for urban warfare.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater conceded that finding
Noriega in Panama City would be difficult. ``In a city of a million
people, it's not hard to hide out,'' he said.
   Pentagon officials also held out the possibility that U.S.
troops may have to stalk Noriega or his loyalists in Panama's
jungles.
   Although he is vastly outnumbered by the 24,000-strong U.S.
strike force, Noriega _ former head of military intelligence and
paid informer for the CIA in the 1970s _ is hard to outmaneuver,
officials said.
   ``He's a crafty devil, as you know,'' said Kelly. ``He grew up
in a very tough academy, so he's been used to this for many years.''
   It was unclear how many forces Noriega still has under his
command although Sheafer said, ``We do not think he is effectively
in command of anything at this time.''
   Bush said he would not be satisfied until Noriega was brought to
justice in the United States, and would keep up the search as long
as it took.
   But Noriega has vowed to fight to his death, and those who know
him well say he would resist capture at all costs.
   Said reserve Col. Charles Stone, who served in Panama until 1987
and often met with Noriega: ``I think before he'd face that, he'd
take his own life.''

   Dissent has been rare in Romanian
President Nicolae Ceausescu's realm, where a vast secret police
force and a wide network of informants have traditionally stifled
public criticism of the Bucharest regime.
   Many of those who have protested Ceausescu's policies are
unknown to Westerners, largely because of the regime's swift
repression. Critics have landed in jail or been committed to mental
hospitals for speaking to the Western media or standing up for
human rights.
   Leaders of a worker protest by some 10,000 people in Brasov in
November 1987 disappeared without trace.
   Here is a list of some of the most prominent people known to
have criticized Ceausescu's policies:
   _ Doina Cornea, 60, a French teacher who lives in the western
city of Cluj, is the most prominent dissident. She has been
persecuted repeatedly, put under surveillance and house arrest and
beaten by police for her outspoken support for human and religious
rights.
   Cornea has been especially vocal in criticizing a national
resettlement plan that Western human rights activists say could
destroy village culture and tradition.
   _ Laszlo Toekes, a Protestant minister who has championed
religious rights as well as those of the ethnic Hungarian minority
in Transylvania. An attempt to arrest him one week ago sparked the
anti-government protests in Timisoara that have now spread around
Romania.
   _ Silviu Brucan, 73, a former ambassador to the United States,
who early this yeasr joined five other prominent former Communists
in signing a letter to Ceausescu criticizing the president's
policies and disrespect for the law.
   Brucan also issued a statement to Western media after the 1987
worker protest in Brasov, supporting the worker's demands. For that
he was placed under house arrest for several months.
   The other signatories of the letter to Ceausescu were Gheorge
Apostel, a former Politburo member and first deputy premier;
Alexandru Birladenanu, a former Politburo member and former
minister of foreign trade and chief of state planning; Corneliu
Manescu, a former foreign minister and ambassador to France.
   Constantin Pirvulescu, one of the founding fathers of the
Romanian Communist Party who accused Ceausescu in 1979 of putting
personal interests above the interests of the party, also signed
the letter, as did Grigore Raceanu. Raceanu held various positions
in the Central Committee, was purged in 1958 and later
rehabilitated.
   His son, Mircea Raceanu, a diplomat in the United States in the
1970s, was arrested in January and charged with espionage. His
arrest was linked in the official media with the letter of the six
party veterans.
   Among others harassed for critical stands is poet Dan Desliu,
who in April sent a letter to Ceausescu deploring the lack of human
rights in his country. He was reported on hunger strike in March
and was later placed in a mental hospital.
   Writer Dan Petrescu, a resident of the northern university town
of Iasi, was arrested for a month before November's party congress
in Romania after he gave an outspoken interview to Radio Free
Europe. He is now reported again under house arrest in Iasi.
   Mircea Dinescu, also a poet, was fired from his job with the
literary weekly Romania Literara for an interview published in the
French daily Liberation in March in which he criticized official
policies on writers.
   Four people were reportedly arrested in January for other
criticism of Ceausescu's policies. They were Petre Mihai Bacanu and
Anton Uncu, from the government newspaper Romania Libera; theater
critic Mihai Creanga of the magazine Romania Pitoreasca; and
Alexandru Ghiroiu, who worked as a linotypist at Romania's largest
state publishing house of Casa Scinteii.
   Others imprisoned for their dissenting views include:
   _ Ion Puiu, veteran politican of the National Peasant Party who
gathered mostly young supporters of the outlawed party.
   _ Florian Russu, leader of two independent youth groups.
   _ Nicolae Stancescu, who was arrested after giving interviews to
Western news media.
   _ Mihai Pavelescu, who was detained after describing the
repressive policies in an interview with a French news agency.
   _ Nestor Popescu, a film editor and Baptist activist who was
placed in a psychiatric hospital.
   _ Dumitru Mazilu, a U.N. human rights investigator who has been
prevented from leaving the country to file his report on youth and
human rights.

<HEAD>Concern for Patients' Rights Called Critical in AIDS Fight</HEAD>

   Successes and failures in the war against AIDS
show that concern for patients' rights is essential if health
authorities hope to stem the epidemic, the director of the World
Health Organization's AIDS program says.
   In an interview Thursday, Dr. Jonathan Mann said many of the
discriminatory laws put in place during the initial panic earlier
in the '80s have been repealed as governments discovered the laws
were impeding efforts to fight the disease's spread.
   ``We made a big discovery during the 1980s that ranks right up
there with the discovery of the virus and the modes of spread,''
Mann said by telephone from Geneva. ``And that discovery is that to
fight this global epidemic of infectious disease, you must also
fight against prejudice and discrimination.''
   Health officials have been successful in curbing risky sexual
behavior among homosexual men in San Francisco and among female
prostitutes in Nairobi, Kenya and Peru, among other places, Mann
said.
   ``All of those programs have in common ... the careful attention
to developing a supportive social environment that refuses
discrimination against infected people,'' he said. ``We've realized
that in order to fight successfully against AIDS, it is vital to
protect the rights and dignity of people.''
   Mann said that more than 35 countries, including the United
States, passed laws in the 1980s restricting immigration by people
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Other countries, including the Soviet Union, South Korea and
Iraq established mandatory screening for HIV infection. Some,
including China, South Africa and Chile, passed laws that require
the isolation of people infected with HIV, Mann said.
   ``In Cuba, when people were found to be infected, they were
asked to leave their home and their job and go to a renovated
hospital on the outskirts of Havana where they were given a salary
but were basically `kept,''' Mann said.
   Such laws have crippled efforts to block the spread of AIDS, he
said.
   ``If you knew that being tested for HIV infection could result
in your having to leave your family, lose your job, and in every
other way be separated from society, would you be tested?''
   Mann noted that Illinois and Louisiana recently repealed laws
requiring AIDS tests for couples seeking marriage licenses,
concluding that the laws were ineffective and wasteful.
   Costa Rica repealed a law requiring that foreign sailors display
a certificate showing they were free of AIDS before they could come
ashore.
   ``It sounds like good sense, superficially, to `build a wall'
around a country and say everybody who comes into this country has
to be tested for HIV infection,'' Mann said. ``Then you get into
the realities.''
   In 1987, a group of experts convened by the World Health
Organization concluded that HIV screening for international
travelers ``would at best _ and at great cost _ retard only briefly
the dissemination of HIV both globally and with respect to any
particular country.''
   ``A virus, a disease, doesn't respect walls,'' Mann said. ``As
the Berlin Wall has shown, walls don't protect people; they
actually endanger the people within the walls.''

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two U.S. planes late Thursday bombed
a strong pocket of resistance in the capital manned by troops loyal
to fugitive Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as the second day of the
American invasion ended.
   Flares lighted the moonless sky. Helicopters flew low over parts
of Panama City, shining bright lights.
   On Thursday afternoon, hours before the bombing, U.S. troops on
armored personnel carriers shouted over megaphones for residents
near the Tinajitas garrison in the northeastern San Miguelito
neighborhood to evacuate. Sporadic machine-gun fire could be heard.
   U.S. soldiers throughout Thursday ducked occasional gunfire in
mop-up operations and ringed the Nicaraguan and Cuban embassies
with armored personnel carriers in case the elusive Noriega was
inside.
   Thousands of U.S. servicemen swept into Panama City on the
second day of their huge offensive, trying to wipe out die-hard
resisters and hunting for Noriega, while also searching for missing
Americans believed to be hostages.
   President Bush pledged in Washington Thursday that U.S. forces
would scour Panama ``as long as it takes'' to capture Noriega. He
said the military operation he ordered created stability in Panama
and said ``it's been worth'' the American lives it cost, while
expressing sorrow over the deaths.
   He has ordered a $1 million bounty for the capture of Noriega,
who has been charged in the United States with drugrunning and
money-laundering.
   Looters swarmed the streets of Panama City like locusts
Thursday. Thousands, from children to grandparents, stripped store
shelves down to bare wood on Central Avenue.
   U.S. soldiers were too busy with snipers and small bands of
armed Noriega loyalists to challenge the looters.
   The force in San Miguelito was composed of fighters from the
civilian, paramilitary ``Dignity Battalions'' and other Noriega
loyalists.
   U.S. armored personnel carriers were seen heading Thursday night
toward San Miguelito, a large working-class neighborhood of 340,000
people.
   Residents said people they believed were Panamanian combatants
were fleeing to more secure areas and the poor were being evacuated.
   Elsewhere, machine guns rattled and explosions boomed near Cerro
Patacon hill behind Santa Maria University, close to U.S. Army
communications installations.
   Pentagon officials said U.S. troops had military control of
Panama City. They said most units of Noriega's Defense Forces had
fled into the jungles, and U.S. troops may be ordered in to follow
them.
   They reported 21 Americans killed, 208 wounded and four missing
in two days of fighting.
   Figures for Panamanian casualties were hard to come by.
   An official in the office of Leonardo Diaz, medical director of
the Santo Tomas Hospital, said the hospital had taken in 80 dead
and more than 1,000 wounded.
   ``We have really lost count of the wounded,'' she said, refusing
to give her name. She said many of the wounded were civilians
coming from areas of fighting near Defense Forces barracks.
   ``The morgue is now full. We have no place to put the dead,''
she said.
   She added the hospital was running low on medical supplies.
   Santo Tomas is the hospital nearest the bombed and burned-out
Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters, flattened on the first
night of the invasion.
   An exhausted emergency room doctor at the hospital could give no
breakdown of civilian or military casualties. The Dignity
Battalions and some of Noriega's elite units, such as the Machos de
Monte, wear civilian clothing.
   A Spanish photographer was killed and a French and an English
photographer were wounded Thursday in crossfire between U.S. troops
who mistook each other for Panamanian forces in the Marriott Hotel
parking lot, other journalists said.
   An Associated Press photographer saw flares being fired Thursday
night near Anton, 60 miles southwest of Panama City and a few miles
from the Panamanian Defenese Forces base of Rio Hato. People were
taking refuge in a local school.
   Troops from the 82nd Airborne Division stopped the photographer,
Matias Recart, at Anton and refused to let him continue to Panama
City.
   Residents said Panamanians attacked American positions at Rio
Hato, then apparently went into the mountains.
   Dignity Battalions were seen at several points between Anton and
the western city of David.
   China on Friday came to Noriega's defense, saying U.S. troops
invaded because the Panamanian strongman opposed U.S. attempts to
gain permanent control over the Panama Canal. The official Xinhua
News Agency called it a ``rather novel and sensational'' cliche
that America sent troops to bring to trial ``what it called a `drug
trafficker.''
   In Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, officials ordered troops and
armored vehicles to encircle the U.S. Embassy because of its
embassy in Panama City was surrounded by American forces.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said in a TV interview that
reinforcements sent to aid the troops based in Panama may be able
to leave ``within a few weeks.'' Earlier, officials said they hoped
the action could take three days.
   Looters who capitalized on the chaos set up stands in alleyways
and sidewalks to hawk their wares to jostling hordes of Christmas
buyers.
   Slumdwellers peddled designer brassieres, French champagne and
Gucci watches at bargain prices. Ritzy stores on Avenida Espana,
Panama's main thoroughfare, were stripped of goods.
   ``Look,'' a young man said proudly, showing a gold watch. ``I
bought it for $20, the salesman didn't even realize it is a Gucci.''
   New President Guillermo Endara, sworn in by a Panamanian judge
as U.S. forces invaded at midnight Tuesday, announced an 18-hour
curfew that ends at 6 a.m. Friday. It had no immediate effect on
the crowds.
   Panama's newly installed leaders appeared at the legislative
assembly building under heavy U.S. guard. U.S. soldiers in jeans,
sweatshirts and other civilian clothes were sprinkled throughout
the building.
   Scattered bursts of gunfire came San Miguelito and from a
central hotel district taken over temporarily by armed Noriega
supporters. They did not appear to be seeking confrontation with
U.S. forces, however, but vandalized and looted hotel rooms and
stole cars.
   In Chitre, 100 miles southwest of Panama City, a Panamanian
Defense Forces officer said the garrison of about 200 men had not
been attacked.
   ``We are with ... (Noriega) until the last bullet. We are ready
for the gringos. We are waiting for orders,'' he said.

   Women with furs are facing a new threat on the
streets _ not muggers, but animal-rights activists who have adopted
confrontational tactics in their fight to mothball the fur industry.
   Women strolling down the street in fur coats report they've been
jeered at, sprayed with ketchup or red paint, even had their coats
slashed.
   ``We're encouraging people to go up to fur wearers and to say
something to them,'' said Dana Stuchell, national director of
Trans-Species Unlimited, one of the country's leading animal-rights
groups.
   ``Some people are extremely mild, some people are more abrasive,
but the point is to let them know how you feel about their fur coat
and to explain that animals had to suffer and die for it.''
   Trans-Species Unlimited says it doesn't condone violence _
``that's what animal rights are all about _ non-violence,''
Stuchell said.
   But the attacks on fur-wearers and vandalism at some fur stores
by extremists has begun to raise the hackles of furriers.
   ``There was a feeling a couple of years ago that the thing would
go away, that if we responded to it it would just lend credit to
the movement,'' said Jack Neal, a spokesman for the Fur Information
Council of America. ``But it's gotten to the point where furriers
were under such attack that we couldn't ignore it.''
   The animal-rights movement has been growing in recent years.
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals was started in
Washington by two friends in 1980. It now has 250,000 members, a
staff of 70 and a $7 million budget, said spokeswoman Carol L.
Burnett.
   Trans-Species Unlimited, based in Williamsport, Pa., led the
first national anti-fur protest in 1985. Since then, it has
organized ever larger annual marches the day after Thanksgiving _
kickoff day of the holiday shopping season.
   This year, protests were held in 94 cities, including a march
with more than 3,000 people on New York's Fifth Avenue, led by game
show host Bob Barker. One fur store in Miami's posh Coconut Grove
allegedly was vandalized by activists.
   On another front, Aspen, Colo., voters are being asked whether
their tony ski resort should become the world's first fur-free zone.
   The Aspen City Council voted last month to hold a special
election in February on banning fur sales within city limits. They
have already banned the use of steel-jawed leg-hold traps and the
sale of all furs caught in such traps.
   ``Instead of Aspen's being known as a glitzy, egocentric kind of
place, I think it can be known as a town that's sensitive to the
environment and sensitive to the delicate balance between humans
and wildlife,'' Mayor Bill Stirling said.
   The measure could put the city's four furriers out of business
and drastically change the stock in another 25 to 30 ski accessory
shops.
   The fur industry denies the animal-rights movement has had any
economic impact.
   Sales of fur items have quintupled since 1972, and retailers say
they are selling more coats each year. But overproduction and
price-cutting have kept the total sales figure at a flat $1.8
billion since 1986.
   Mink, the most popular fur, has dropped in price from a recent
high of $43 a pelt in 1987 to about $26 this year, according to
David Bavins, marketing director at the Seattle Fur Exchange, which
handles most of the U.S. crop.
   New York-based Fur Vault Inc. announced last month that it is up
for sale after losing $7.2 million in the past two fiscal years.
   Animal-rights groups _ which generally oppose use of animals for
research, food and clothing _ like to take some credit.
   ``People are starting to change their attitudes about fur,''
Stuchell said. ``They're no longer a symbol of status.''
   Although this year's fur season is still young, early reports
are that furriers are doing better than last year, thanks in part
to the frigid temperatures in much of the country.
   Chuck Kehoe, president of Revillon Furs, which are sold at Saks
Fifth Avenue and other stores nationwide, said business in the
first three weeks of December was up 12 percent over last year.

   If Don and Lee Williams of Edgewater, Fla., are
wondering what happened to the check they mailed with their water
bill last month, it just arrived _ in New York City.
   The $33.87 check sent to ``City, Box 100,'' was rerouted by the
post office in Jacksonville, Fla., to the Big Apple, where it
showed up at the Department of Investigation, said department
Commissioner Kevin Frawley.
   ``This is the kind of thing, if you live in New York, that
convinces you this is `The City' in this country,'' said Frawley.
   Box 100 is an address set up by New York City officials for
residents to send complaints, tips on wrongdoing or just about
anything else, Frawley said. The same address in Edgewater,
apparently is where you pay your water bill.
   Frawley said he had not yet contacted the Williams couple to
find out if they have had any trouble with their water service.

   If President Bush doesn't eat the 75-pound
health-food tamale sent by a tortilla factory, he can donate it to
a homeless shelter, but he ought to try some of the smaller tamales
included in the box, said the tamale maker.
   Taylor Ford of La Suprema Tortilleria restaurant and tortilla
factory said Thursday he hoped the 5-by-3-foot, 22-inch thick
chicken tamale would ``promote good eating. You know, the president
is going to need his energy during this Panama crisis.''
   Ford's wife, La Suprema manager Lucy Cruz, said the tamale is a
``Texas-size holiday greeting to the president and his family.
President and Mrs. Bush can eat healthy but still enjoy holiday
feasting.''
   Unlike other tamales _ a native Mexican food of minced meat,
peppers and seasonings rolled in cornmeal and wrapped in corn
shucks _ the one steamed for El Presidente contains no
preservatives, lard, salt or sugar, Ford said.
   It contains 50 pounds of organic blue corn meal and 25 pounds of
chicken smothered in pureed red chile. ``Red, white and blue _
isn't that appropriate?'' Ford said.

   George Bush, the most public of presidents, is
surely among the most private of presidents, too. He meets anyone
and travels anywhere yet he acts alone, surprising the world _ and
his own closest advisers.
   He is his own secretary of state, his own director of Central
Intelligence, his own China expert, his own national security
adviser.
   He is such a product of government _ the House, the Republican
National Committee, the CIA, the United Nations, the embassy in
Beijing, the vice presidency _ that he does not need advice from
the professionals who surround him. He was there first.
   ``George Bush is very comfortable with himself,'' says Clemson
University political scientist Charles Dunn, an observer of
presidents. ``He has a good sense of person, of who he is. He is
not awed by the Oval Office or by the press.''
   Moreover, says Dunn, secrecy has worked for Bush. ``He has
thrived by exceeding, at least modestly, the level of expectations
for himself,'' Dunn says.
   Bush says that's the way he is, take it or get someone else.
   ``You've got your job,'' he told reporters Thursday afternoon.
``... But I have mine. And that is to conduct the foreign policy of
this country the way I think best. If the American people don't
like it, I expect they'll get somebody else to take my job.''
   ``Bush doesn't like handlers,'' says Fred Greenstein of
Princeton University. ``He's going to do it his way.''
   Bush's tendency to look inward showed up even before he won
office.
   His most important political decision was the choice of a
running mate. He made the selection of Dan Quayle by himself and
kept it to himself.
   Last June, he decided to propose a summit conference to Mikhail
Gorbachev in December and kept it under his hat.
   He sent Brent Scowcroft off to China and had it announced at 2
a.m. on a Sunday morning, astonishing even the China experts on his
team.
   Later it came out that Scowcroft made a similar trip in July
when Bush was publicly isolating China for the terror at Tiananmen
Square.
   When reporters complained Thursday that he had misled them, Bush
at first fell back on a seeming technicality. ``I said no `high
level exchanges' (had taken place. So please look at it
carefully,'' he told reporters.
   Questioned further about his decision to keep the secret, he
said, ``I have an obligation as president to conduct the foreign
policy of this country the way I see fit.''
   Without asking the CIA for advice, Bush decided in October to
sit out an attempted coup against Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   Then, in maximum possible secrecy, on Sunday afternoon he
decided to commit armed forces to the biggest U.S. military
operation since Vietnam.
   Yet this keep-a-secret president is among the most talkative of
presidents. He conducts so many news conferences that reporters run
out of questions.
   Someone who counted up early this month determined that Bush had
held 105 one-on-one meetings with presidents, prime ministers and
kings. Those he hasn't seen, he's telephoned. If he hasn't, he will.
   Greenstein, chairman of Princeton's politics department, says he
sees another aspect in Bush _ an occasional ``spasm of
impulsiveness.''
   He cites Bush's ``hotdogging at Malta'' _ his decision to ride a
cutter through rough seas _ and his determination to attend a
hemispheric drug summit in Colombia, where drug producers have put
a $30 million price on his head.
   Other presidents have been secretive, and as Bush pointed out
they have to be when planning a military operation. The public
understands.
   Some secrets are political. Harry Truman called a special
session of Congress from the rostrum of the 1948 Democratic
National Convention without telling anyone beforehand. Lyndon
Johnson astonished his closest advisers by tacking his announcement
that he would not seek re-election in 1968 to the end of a Sunday
night television speech on Vietnam.
   Bush, even while flying to the Republican convention in 1988,
didn't tell most of his political advisers that he had chosen a
little-known senator as his running mate. When he made the
announcement upon landing, jaws dropped.
   Presidential secrecy can be risky, says Greenstein, but so can
consultation.
   ``Students of decision making say that solitary decision-makers
are likely to miss some facet of the problem; they're bound to have
some blind spots,'' he says.
   On the other hand, he says, ``like-minded people can become
isolated,'' locking out of the process all who are likely to
disagree while reassuring one another of their astuteness.
   Dunn agrees to this extent: presidents who want support when
their decisions go sour had better confide in advisers in advance.
   He cites an adage: ``If you want me with you on the landing,
make sure I'm with you on the takeoff.''

<HEAD>Yeutter Wants Private Sector Pressure on Trade Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says the
private sector should get behind the U.S. negotiating effort to
gain more freedom in international trade for farm commodities.
   Negotiations under the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade are aimed at revamping global trading rules. The
talks in Geneva, Switzerland are scheduled to end a year from now.
   At a news conference on Thursday, Yeutter said American farmers
are closing out one of their best years financially and that
decisions in Congress and Geneva will bear heavily on their
fortunes in the 1990s.
   Yeutter said it will require ``an immense amount of effort and a
strong political commitment'' on the part of the United States, the
European Economic Community, Japan, the developing countries and
others to bring the GATT talks to a close a year from now.
   The private sector, including farm groups, also will be
important in reaching U.S. objectives during the negotiations, he
said.
   ``They can disagree about tactics if they wish, or they can
disagree about particular nuances of the program,'' Yeutter said.
``But it's important that we have broad support for our fundamental
objectives.''
   Yeutter said he believes there is broad support for the Bush
administration's GATT proposals but that it is not unanimous.
   ``We have seen some evidence of some undercutting here and there
by particular groups, but we'll have to try to minimize that, of
course, because that simply reduces and weakens our negotiating
leverage in Geneva,'' he said. ``And we're going to need all the
negotiating leverage that we can possibly muster if we're going to
make the progress that we believe is important.''
   Meanwhile, Yeutter said, farm income reached near-record levels
in 1989, agricultural exports have improved and that the farm
credit situation has eased for both lenders and borrowers.
   This will help provide building blocks for new farm legislation
due next year as well as the GATT talks, he said. The 1985 farm law
will expire next year, and Congress is writing a new bill to
succeed it.
   Yeutter was asked if he thought there would be a freer
international market by 1999, one of the goals sought by U.S.
negotiators, particularly for agricultural products.
   ``My personal assessment is that we have the best chance for
significant trade liberalization in agriculture that we've
experienced since the GATT began'' 40 years ago, he replied.
   ``I do believe it'll be a freer market 10 years from now than it
is today, and I also believe firmly that that will work to the
advantage of the American farmer.''
   The United States at the GATT talks has sought a gradual
reduction and eventual elimination of all trade-distorting
subsidies and policies. But administration officials have adamantly
insisted that no U.S. programs would be scrapped unless other
countries did likewise.
   ``Though we may want to make some changes in all of these
programs in the 1990 farm bill because those may be desirable in
their own right ... we're not going to unilaterally disarm
internationally in that legislation,'' Yeutter said.
   ``So, whether we're talking about sugar, the wheat program or
any other program, I determined that we not forgo any of our
negotiating leverage in that 1990 legislative debate,'' he added.
``But at the same time, I am not prepared to accept the arguments
of any individual industry to the effect that says all changes in
the program are off-limits.''
   Yeutter, who joined President Bush's Cabinet last January, was
U.S. trade representative in the Reagan administration and has been
in the thick of Uruguay Round negotiations since those began Sept.
20, 1986, in Punta del Esta, Uruguay.
   While many farm organizations have endorsed all or parts of the
U.S. plan to overhaul global trade, some have reservations about
``free trade'' and how that might affect specific commodities.
   Mike Dunn, legislative director for the National Farmers Union,
said in an interview that GATT operates in many legitimate areas
but that ``free trade'' raises serious questions.
   The Bush administration, he said, has a ``rather myopic view''
that free trade is a total solution to agricultural woes.
   ``But if free trade ends up hurting (U.S.) producers, then we
ought not to be pursuing that,'' he said. ``I think we ought to be
pursuing fair trade.''
   One of the fears expressed by Dunn is that under a global system
of free trade, a country that produces a commodity at the lowest
cost would have an automatic competitive advantage.
   ``I have serious reservations about the wholesale shipping of
commodities to other nations simply because they can do it
cheaper,'' he said.
   Assurances by Yeutter that no U.S. farm program or price support
structure would be abandoned by GATT negotiators unless all other
countries did likewise are not good enough, Dunn said.
   ``When he can come up with positive proof that what they're
trying to do would increase the net farm income of individual
operators _ family farmers _ I think we would support it,'' he
said. ``But that's not the case.''

<HEAD>Signing Santa Makes Christmas Complete for Deaf Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA PERLMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dozens of giggling children lined
up to see Santa Claus at the shopping mall fell silent and watched
intently as 10-year-old Jeannette Johnson climbed into his lap and
started talking with him.
   Jeannette and Santa used sign language to speak. Jeannette is
deaf, making Bruce Partridge one of the few Santas to whom she can
tell her wishes.
   With hands fluttering, she told him what presents she wanted _
including a guitar. ``If it's very loud I can feel it,'' she said.
   Using his white wool-gloved hands, Santa promised to stop by on
Christmas Eve. ``Ho, ho, ho,'' doesn't exactly translate, so he
made the sign for laughter, a kind of rotating motion from the
belly.
   This is the third year that Partridge, a Kent County sheriff's
deputy, has put his sign language talents to as St. Nick.
   ``Adults think it's such a small thing, but it's so important
for kids to believe that Santa can sign, too,'' Partridge said.
   ``Deaf kids grow up in a hearing world, on the outside looking
in. But they don't want pity; they want to participate. ... This is
one way to show them it's OK to be deaf.''
   Partridge, 36, began signing about five years ago to communicate
with deaf relatives and because he occasionally dealt with deaf
citizens on the job.
   Now a part-time interpreter at a local school district,
Partridge and another Grand Rapids man began posing as Santas for
an annual potluck dinner for deaf people a few years ago and
``decided that there were other deaf children in the area who might
like to talk to Santa.''
   While deaf children may miss out on the bell choirs and holiday
music, Partridge believes that after seeing Santa, ``they go away
happy that they can have Christmas, too.''

<HEAD>First Outbreaks of Flu Reported in Colorado, Minnesota</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The first outbreaks of the 1989-90 flu season
have been reported in a Colorado day-care center and a Minnesota
nursing home, the national Centers for Disease Control said.
   Twenty-four children in the day-care center became ill in
November, and a test performed on one child found the influenza
type researchers know as A-H3N2, one of the three major flu types,
the CDC said Thursday.
   Then, during the week of Dec. 4, an outbreak began in the
Minnesota nursing home, eventually spreading to four residents and
two employees. A test found the same kind of influenza again.
   The CDC noted that all of the A-H3N2 influenza viruses it has
tested this winter are the ``Shanghai'' flu, which the current flu
vaccine protects against.
   In all, sporadic flu cases have been reported in 19 states. A
few cases of a different strain of flu have been found. They
resemble the ``Taiwan'' flu, which the vaccine also protects
against.
   The CDC recommends flu vaccine, especially for people at
increased risk of complications from influenza, including the
elderly and those with heart or lung trouble.

<HEAD>US Automakers See Competitive Edge in Safety</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American automakers, inspired by consumer
demand for safer cars, are trying to regain the competitive edge by
offering more safety features than imports, says the head of a
private consumer group.
   That change is reflected by an increase in the number of
American cars among the highest rated in the 1990 edition of ``The
Car Book,'' an annual car buying guide, said Jack Gillis, exectuive
director of the Center for Auto Safety and principal author of the
book.
   ``We are seeing a marked improvement in the overall quality and
safety of cars being offered to the American consumer,'' said
Gillis in a telephone interview following release of the book
Thursday.
   ``The reason is because more and more consumers are considering
safety in the purchase of a new car and because the automobile
represents one of the most potentially dangerous products that we
will purchase,'' Gillis said.
   ``Most of the cars tested very well. There were very few poor
performers,'' added Gillis, explaining crash test information is
not available for many of the vehicles.
   Gillis said the government hasn't crash tested them because
requirements for automatic crash protection standards _ safety
belts, air bags or other mechanisms _ are new with 1990 cars.
   The guide also rated cars on their performance in five other
categories _ fuel economy, repair costs, warranties, insurance
costs and complaint history.
   Gillis gave more weight to crash safety than to other rating
components. However, since that information was limited Gillis'
guide names only automobiles in various size categories that were
``best'' in the overall rating.
   Gillis said U.S. carmakers are taking back the competitive
advantage they lost in the late 1970s when Japanese auto
manufacturers built more safety into their small cars.
   ``Now we see the pendulum swing the other way and the U.S.
carmakers ... are gaining a strong safety competitve advantage over
the Japanese because of the widespread offering of air bags,'' said
Gillis.
   The tenth edition of the guide, first produced in 1981 for the
government but now published as a private venture, also offers a
list of cars which include air bags as a standard or optional
feature.
   The Center for Auto Safety is an non-profit consumer group
established in 1970 to improve vehicle quality and highway safety.
   The group's book offers a best and worst list of 1990 minivans
because those vehicles, which don't have to meet the same safety
standards as cars, have been crash tested.
   The best overall rated 1990 cars and minivans include 13
American, 4 Japanese and one German cars.
   But he said the distinctions may soon disappear as more cars are
jointly produced by manufacturers.
   According to Gillis, here are the best overall rated 1990 cars
by size category:
   _ Subcompact: Toyota Corolla, Mercury Tracer, Volkswagen Golf,
Pontiac LeMans, Ford Escort. Only the 1989 Mercury Tracer is
offered for sale until introduction of the 1991 model.
   _ Compact: Pontiac Grand AM 2-door, Buick Skylark 2-door, Toyota
Camry, Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais 2-door.
   _ Intermediate: Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera, Oldsmobile Cutlass
Supreme, Buick Regal.
   _ Large: Pontiac Bonneville, Mazda 929, Cadillac Eldorado.
   _ The book lists the best minivans as the Plymouth Voyager,
Mitsubishi Van and Dodge Caravan. The worst includes the Ford
Aerostar, Volkswagen Vanagon, Chevrolet Astro and Toyota Van.
   A companion guide, ``The Used Car Book'' names the 30 best and
worst older autos based on a complaint index devised by Gillis. The
index is based on the ratio of the number of complaints received by
the government from carowners to the number of cars sold.
   The government figures show four cars _ three Japanese and one
American _ had no complaints.
   Copies of ``The Car Book,'' published Harper &amp; Row, may be
obtained at bookstores or by writing to the Center for Auto Safety,
2001 S St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20009. The cost of $10.50 includes
postage and handling.

<HEAD>Watkins Says Arms Plants Might Need Health-Protection Changes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department is considering whether
to modify its nuclear weapons plants in response to a report that
exposure to low-level radiation may carry more cancer risk than
previously believed.
   A National Research Council committee said in a report this week
that exposure to low-level radiation poses a cancer risk three to
four times greater than previously thought.
   Many workers in the 17 major weapons facilities work with
equipment that emit low-level radiation, and recent government
reports on plants in Ohio, Colorado, Tennessee and Texas said
workers have too little protection from radiation exposure.
   On Thursday, the department released copies of a memorandum from
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins ordering his acting assistant
secretary for environment, safety and health, Peter N. Brush, to
assess the implications of the radiation study for the weapons
program.
   ``Your report should include recommended options for modifying
operations where such changes appear warranted,'' Watkins wrote in
the memo dated Wednesday. He did not indicate whether he believed
any changes would be necessary.
   Watkins asked for an interim report within 90 days and a final
report by June 30, 1990.
   The National Research Council committee used new methods of
estimating and assessing the health effects of radiation, and it
concluded that a 1980 study by another NRC committee significantly
underestimated the cancer risk from low-level radiation.
   The risk for solid tumor cancer is three times greater than the
earlier estimate, and the risk from leukemia is four times greater,
the committee concluded.
   And the committee found a much greater danger for mental
retardation among unborn babies exposed to low-level radiation from
the eighth to 15th weeks after conception. Its study was based
partly on the medical history of 76,000 survivors of the 1945
atomic bombings in Japan, health studies of workers at nuclear
facilities and the records of patients treated with X-rays for
certain medical conditions.
   In a separate report released Wednesday, another NRC committee
said past and current releases of radiation from the nuclear
weapons plants appear to be too low to have caused any significant
increase in risk to public health. It added, however, that the
Energy Department should do more to study the health effects.

<HEAD>Boston Launches Huge Shopping Center in Northern Ireland</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In what was billed as the largest American
investment in Northern Ireland, Mayor Raymond Flynn announced the
development of a $100 million shopping center in the economically
troubled city of Londonderry.
   ``We're all keenly aware of the trouble in Northern Ireland,''
Flynn said at a news conference Thursday with British and Irish
officials and Cardinal Bernard Law. ``But today, what is happening
in America is very special. We're reaching out and bringing a new
kind of hope, one that transcends words. It brings jobs and
economic opportunity.''
   Groundbreaking will begin next fall on the 300,000-square-foot
complex, which should provide about 1,400 jobs in office, service
and construction, Flynn said. The shopping center, funded by a
Quincy-based developer, is expected to open in 1992.
   The project stems from Boston Ireland Ventures, a non-profit
group founded in 1987 by Flynn and Northern Irish political leader
John Hume to spur economic growth in the north and west of Ireland.
Hume leads the Social Democratic and Labor Party, representing
moderate Catholics in Northern Ireland.
   Londonderry, also known as Derry, the second largest city in
Northern Ireland, is in one of the poorest areas in the country,
with unemployment rates of up to 45 percent.
   After 18 months of negotiations with the British government,
which rules Northern Ireland, O'Connell Development Co. agreed to
build the complex. The company's other projects include waterfront
complexes such as the World Trade Center and Bayside Exposition
Center in Boston and the Marina Bay complex in Quincy.
   ``This is the essence of cooperation,'' said Liam Canniffe,
consulate general of Ireland. ``They are welcoming you on the
streets of Derry. There are great ties between America and Ireland
and now there are great ties between Derry and America.''

<HEAD>Former President Husak, 31 others, Suspended from Communist Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The discredited Communist Party,
trying to salvage its image as it prepares for free elections next
year, is moving to purge hard-line members linked with repressive
policies of the past.
   Ending a two-day extraordinary party congress, delegates
suspended 32 party leaders who are to be investigated for abuse of
power, including former President Gustav Husak.
   They also voted to expel Vasil Bilak, the party's former chief
of ideology, ``as a representative of forces who initiated the
invasion'' by Soviet tanks and troops in 1968 that crushed ``Prague
Spring'' reforms.
   The party is trying to win the trust of the people it ruled for
41 years, persecuting its critics.
   Bilak is viewed by many Czechoslovaks as the man most
responsible for the inviting the Soviets to invade in 1968. He
stepped down from the party's ruling Politburo last year and from
Parliament's Presidium on Dec. 12.
   During the congress, delegates voted in a progressive
leadership, streamlined the party's policy-making Central Committee
and adopted an ``action program'' that rejected Stalinism.
   The congress, attended by more than 1,500 members, also
abolished a hated paramilitary force and apologized for persecuting
those who disagreed with the party line.
   The party's stranglehold on power was broken during four weeks
of peaceful mass protests that led to the formation on Dec. 10 of
the country's first non-Communist dominated government since 1948.
   The month-old revolt forced the resignation of Husak, who took
power after the Communist leader of the ``Prague Spring'' reform
movement, Alexander Dubcek, was ousted and expelled from the party.
   The party on Wednesday issued an unprecedented apology to the
Czechoslovak people for the 1968 invasion and to those, like
Dubcek, who suffered ``unjustified repression.''
   Husak and the other party leaders were suspended for ``serious
political mistakes'' which will be investigated by a special
commission set up Thursday by the party's new Central Committee.
   Others who have had their membership suspended and will be
investigated include Alois Indra, former Parliament chairman who
resigned last month, Jan Fojtik, Communist Party ideology chief
until Nov. 24, Ignac Janak, until recently head of the Slovak
Communist Party and Lubomir Strougal, a former premier.
   Former Politburo members Josef Lenart and Karel Hoffman, who
with Indra and Bilak are often linked to the Warsaw Pact invasion,
former Foreign Minister Bohuslav Chnoupek, who lost the post last
year, and former Prague party boss Antonin Kapek also will be
investigated.
   ``There is the possiblity that the commission during its work
could expand the list,'' party spokesman Josef Hora told reporters
at a news conference Thursday.
   Results of the investigation, which could lead to expulsion from
party ranks, are to be delivered at the regular party congress in
May.
   Party spokesman Hora said the streamlined 138-member Central
Committee elected Thursday contains a majority of new faces. The
old Central Committee had 156 members.
   The ``action program'' adopted by the congress emphasized the
break with the past and called for the party to become ``a modern
political party which will become a party of the democratic
movement of the European left.''
   It also called for the rapid elimination of the ``Stalinist
model of the party and society.''
   The party began purging undesirable members in late November,
beginning with hard-line party leader Milos Jakes, who was replaced
by Karel Urbanek.
   Urbanek lost the post he had held for four weeks on Wednesday,
but he was elected Thursday to head the control committee
responsible for overseeing finance and operations.
   The all-powerful position of secretary-general was divided into
two posts during the congress, which elected two men known for
their ability to work with the opposition.
   Former Premier Ladislav Adamec was elected party chairman and
Politburo member Vasil Mohorita was tapped for first secretary.
   Delegates voted Thursday to disband the despised paramilitary
People's Militia, which had already been disarmed.
   Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry announced that it was
dissolving the state secret police and transferring all equipment
used for wiretapping and bugging from the phone company offices
where it had been installed by the secret police to the Transport
and Telecommunications Ministry.

<HEAD>Scientists Discover Master Builder Gene of Immune System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists delving into one of the
immune system's deepest mysteries reported today they have
discovered the genetic trigger that equips the body to hunt down a
bewildering array of invading germs.
   One expert described the discovery as one of the most important
ever made in the young field of immunology, the study of the body's
built-in defenses against disease.
   Researchers from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research
said they found a gene that ceaselessly reshuffles the genetic
library inside newly made white blood cells. This lets the body use
a limited amount of genetic material, or DNA, to concoct an endless
assortment of antibodies capable of zeroing in on bacteria and
viruses that it has never before encountered.
   Their discovery should improve understanding of how the body
arms itself against infection. While it doesn't immediately open up
new ways to treat disease, it may someday let medicine fine-tune
the body's weapons to improve health.
   The gene _ dubbed the recombination activating gene, or RAG-1 _
was discovered by graduate students David G. Schatz and Marjorie
Oettinger. They described their work in today's issue of the
journal Cell.
   ``It's one of the top 10 or 20 discoveries in the history of
immunology,'' commented Dr. Michael Lieber of Stanford University.
``It deals with the basic way that our bodies make antibodies in
the most fundamental sense.''
   The researchers believe the gene makes all or part of an enzyme
called recombinase, which cuts and splices bits of DNA. These
scraps of genetic material are assembled into new genes, which in
turn provide the danger-sensing radar for B cells and T cells, the
body's principal warriers against invading microbes and cancer.
   B cells work by secreting uniquely shaped chemicals called
antibodies. Occasionally, an antibody encounters a microbe with a
spot on its surface that is a mirror image of the antibody. When
this happens, the antibody latches onto this spot, known as an
antigen. This marks the invader for destruction by other soldiers
in the immune system.
   T cells attack invaders directly, and they look for them with
uniquely shaped structures on their coats that are known as antigen
receptors.
   The body constantly pumps out B cells and T cells equipped with
an ever-changing assortment of these unique shapes, and each unique
form requires the work of a unique gene. The body gets these genes
by randomly piecing together scattered bits of DNA from throughout
the cell's genetic archives.
   Two years ago, Dr. Susumu Tonegawa of Japan was awarded the
Nobel prize for discovering that this shuffling explains the
diversity of antibodies.
   ``Since then, we have learned surprisingly little'' about how
the body achieves this rearrangement, said Nobel laureate David
Baltimore, a co-author of the latest work. ``This is the first step
toward finding a chemical basis of diversity.''
   Schatz compared the immune system to an automobile factory. In
this analogy, RAG-1 is the assembly line worker who puts together
the cars' engines.
   ``This reaction is the very heart of what makes the immune
system go,'' he said.
   Schatz said it may soon be possible to watch and manipulate this
assembly process in the test tube and someday even in the human
body. One potential, though distant, application is in replenishing
the ravages of AIDS.
   The AIDS virus selectively seeks out and destroys a particular
variety of blood cell called helper T cells. ``Maybe in time we
will be able to specify the production of these particular cells,''
he said, replacing those lost to the disease.

<HEAD>Refunds Checks Going to 27 Million Medicare Recipients</HEAD>

   Nearly 27 million elderly people will get
refund checks in February and April to offset overcharges early
next year in their Medicare health premiums.
   The Treasury Department on Thursday announced an unusual
two-step process in which the government will overcharge the
elderly on their Medicare premiums and then turn around and mail
out refund checks.
   Bush administration officials said the process was necessary
because Congress repealed the controversial law providing Medicare
catastrophic health benefits after computers were set up to make
the deductions.
   The Treasury plans to issue a refund of $10.60 in February to
cover deductions of $5.30 in January and February. Another $10.60
refund will be issued in April to cover March and April deductions.
   Nearly 27 million Social Security beneficiaries who have
Medicare premiums deducted directly from their benefit checks will
be forced to pay an overcharge of $5.30 a month from January
through May. Officials said there was no way to adjust government
computers quickly enough to halt the withholding of the extra
premium for catastrophic coverage.
   The law providing catastrophic health coverage was intended to
prevent a serious illness from wiping out the finances of a
retiree. But it sparked a revolt among senior citizens who
complained that they already had sufficient coverage and did not
want to pay the higher costs of the new program.
   After President Bush signed the law repealing catastrophic
coverage on Dec. 13, members of Congress urged the administration
to come up with a plan to expedite refunds to retirees, arguing
that a Treasury-favored proposal to make only one lump-sum refund
late in the spring would penalize retirees on fixed incomes.
   ``I am pleased that millions of Medicare beneficiaries will not
be deprived of money they may urgently need,'' said Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark. and chairman of the Senate Aging Committee. ``Five
dollars and 30 cents can be a lot of money to someone on a fixed
income.''
   The Financial Management Service, which issues the government's
checks, said it expects to complete the computer reprogramming in
time for the May Social Security checks to reflect the correct
Medicare premium.
   ``This two-phase plan will provide the most timely service to
recipients without jeopardizing over a quarter-billion other
payments, including regular Social Security benefits and tax
refunds, which we make at this peak time of the year,'''
Commissioner W.C. Douglas of the Treasury's Financial Management
Service said in announcing the decision Thursday.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Thursday he
was pleased with the operation of the media pool that accompanied
the U.S. invasion force to Panama, despite complaints that
reporters had been kept away from the action.
   ``I think there was adequate coverage. I think our commanders on
the scene had their priorities straight,'' said Cheney, noting that
media executives had called his office demanding that the military
protect reporters who were not in the pool.
   Later in the day, about 50 more journalists arrived in Panama
with 300 expected by early Friday.
   Lt. Col. James Swank, a military spokesman, said the reporters
would be allowed to camp out in the officers club restaurant, but
by Friday night would be expected to have their own accommodations.
   Several non-pool photographers were killed or wounded in the
action, and other journalists were taken hostage by forces loyal to
ousted Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams, sitting with Cheney in an
interview with 11 newspaper and wire service journalists,
acknowledged that ``we wish we could have done a better job getting
people around'' on Wednesday.
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin Powell,
also said he was pleased with the operation of he pool, especially
because the news organizations involved had not leaked word of the
invasion in advance.
   ``I think it worked marvellously,'' Powell said, noting that it
had not always gone well on previous occasions. The institution was
created following the secret 1982 invasion of Grenada. News
organizations which take part in the pool agree in advance to keep
its activation a secret.
   ``We did what we promised you we would do and the media in the
pool did what they promised they would do,'' Powell said. Pool
members were collected late Tuesday night and flown to Panama with
the invasion force.
   ``There never was any concern in my mind it would break security
and it didn't,'' Powell said of the pool.
   Oddly enough, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater earlier
Thursday had charged that a pool participant had ``divulged their
participation and departure before they left here.'' He wouldn't
say what organization had done so.
   Williams, speaking to reporters earlier, said his office had
complained to field commanders because pool members had been
restricted largely to interviews with U.S. embassy officials during
most of the first day of the invasion.
   He laid the problem to ``incompetence'' and said, ``There really
is no excuse for it.''
   Later he said he was personally responsible for the operation of
the press pool and was accepting the characterization of
incompetence for himself rather than for the officers in the field.
``They've been working day and night for five days,'' he said of
the Southern Command officers.
   Williams spoke at the close of a news conference at which top
military officers also were asked why they had not taken more steps
to protect U.S. reporters, who were not members of the pool, from
being taken hostage at the Marriott Hotel.
   The spokesman and other senior Pentagon officials said the first
objective of the invasion force had been to disperse the Panamanian
Defense Forces and occupy their base, which they said they
accomplished on Wednesday.
   The lives of American hostages became a prime concern for U.S.
forces as the fighting died down. Williams said there were reports
of an unknown number of Americans being held in three separate
incidents.
   ``We take them all seriously,'' he said. Those held were said to
include Jon Meyersohn, a CBS News television producer.
   U.S. troops evacuated 29 Americans and 35 foreigners, mostly
Panamanians, from the Marriott Hotel in Panama City late Wednesday
night, but Williams said a list of the evacuees was not available.
   Overall, 35,000 U.S. citizens live in Panama, and ``there are
Americans scattered throughout the city,'' said Williams.

   Laboratories that conduct AIDS tests should
double-check their results and report them clearly to doctors, say
researchers who got incorrect or confusing AIDS reports from six of
13 labs.
   The researchers also suggested that criteria be developed to
help labs lessen the number of ``indeterminate'' results, so they
can say with more certainty whether a person carries the AIDS virus.
   The report, in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association, was based on tests on blood samples sent to 13 labs,
all but two of them in California.
   Dr. Abram Benenson of the San Diego State University School of
Public Health said in a telephone interview Thursday that
laboratories frequently return their results to doctors and
hospitals with ``so much gibberish on the report that it hides and
obscures the data.''
   He and his colleagues urged supplemental tests and standardized
criteria to ensure positive results.
   In the summer 1988, the researchers provided medical facilities
with specimens that carried the human immunodeficiency virus, which
causes AIDS.
   The hospitals, clinics and one doctor's office that got them
were asked to submit the samples to the laboratories they generally
use for AIDS tests. The laboratories weren't told the samples were
part of a study.
   The medical facilities were all in San Diego County while some
of the laboratories were elsewhere in California and in two other
states.
   Benenson said that most laboratories first test for the virus
using an enzyme immunoassay, or EIA, test. If that test is
positive, they repeat it.
   If the second test is also positive, labs often then use another
test _ frequently one called the Western blot _ to verify the
results.
   The problem with the Western blot test, Benenson said, is that
it has had inconsistent criteria which made a positive
determination ``a matter of interpretation.''
   Of the 13 labs reporting back in the study, all reported
positive results to the EIA test on the sample that did in fact
carry the AIDS virus.
   But at the next stage, in which the positive result is verified
by a second kind of test, the labs didn't fare as well, the study
said.
   Eleven used Western blot testing to back up the EIA results. Of
those, five reported the specimen was positive, five reported
indeterminate results, and one lab returned the raw results to the
physician and told him to do his own interpretation, the study said.
   One of the labs didn't do a confirming test, and one used an
immunofluorescence test to correctly confirm the positive result.
   The researchers said some of the labs gave ``excessive and
potentially confusing information'' when reporting back. Some of
the language was so confusing it would be difficult for a physician
to know if the test was positive or negative, the authors said.
   One lab said a positive result ``is not diagnostic of AIDS, only
of possible risk-exposure.''
   ``So far as we know, if you have a positive seriological test,
you have the virus and you are capable of transmitting the
infection,'' Benenson said, adding that labs may use obscure
language ``to try to be kind and not frighten the patient.''
   In an accompanying editorial in the journal, two doctors at the
federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said they
``enthusiastically endorse'' the study's recommendations for clear,
concise laboratory results.

Romania and urged other Americans to leave the country because of
the ``deteriorating situation'' there.
   The department issued a travel advisory warning Americans to
avoid traveling to Romania, where numerous deaths have been
reported in a violent crackdown against anti-government

   ``There has been no immediate threat directed at U.S.

   She said the dependents of American embassy workers and

   ``The department, therefore, is strongly advising U.S. citizens
reident in Romania to depart and the embassy will provide
assistance to those who do,'' said the department statement.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Bush Should Speed Bailout</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's thrift institutions will continue
to suffer heavy losses unless the Bush administration speeds up its
savings and loan bailout, private analysts contend.
   The country's 2,903 S&amp;Ls, including 256 under government
control, lost $3.8 billion in the July-September period, down only
slightly from a record $4.1 billion in the second quarter, the
Office of Thrift Supervision said Thursday.
   For the first nine months of 1989, industry red ink totaled
$11.5 billion, on track to top the $13.4 billion loss for all of
1988, a post-Depression record.
   About two-thirds of third quarter loss, $2.6 billion, came in
institutions already under government management and earmarked for
liquidation or sale. All but $275 million of the remaining $1.2
billion loss occurred at 223 institutions targeted for government
takeover but still under private management.
   ``I just don't really see any hope of turning around the overall
profit numbers ... until we get these insolvent institutions out of
the market,'' said economist Catherine England of the Cato
Institute, a conservative research organization.
   About half of the red ink at government-controlled thrifts, $1.3
billion, was from non-operating losses, mostly from recognizing
sour loans that had long ago gone bad. But, the other half was from
current operations.
   ``The faster we get the ... depositors paid off and those
institutions closed, the lower the ultimate cost of the cleanup is
going to be and the sooner we'll be able to turn around the
marginal and healthy thrifts,'' Ms. England said.
   Only about 35 failed S&amp;Ls have been dealt with since the Aug. 9
enactment of President Bush's rescue plan. The others are open and
continue to lose money.
   Economist Edward Kane of Ohio State University said managers at
weak, but still open, institutions have every incentive to take big
risks in hopes of staving off closure.
   ``When you get desperate people doing desperate things, on
average they tend to lose money,'' he said.
   The S&amp;L bailout law provided $50 billion through 1991 to close
or rescue failed thrifts, but many analysts say mounting industry
losses show that won't be enough.
   ``We still have as much as $20 billion in losses out there that
haven't come to the surface,'' said Bert Ely, a financial
institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va. ``It's like a water
torture. It's going to continue quarter after quarter after
quarter.''
   Ely estimated that third quarter losses would have been about
$1.6 billion greater if not for what amounts to a continuing
government subsidy to 220 institutions rescued in 1988.
   Also, as part of the Bush plan, the government poured $8.5
billion into thrifts under its control during the last half of the
third quarter, paying off high-cost deposits. Although that reduced
costs at those institutions, Ely said it probably did little to
blunt total industry losses.
   Thrift office economist James Freund attributed losses at S&amp;Ls
outside government control to restructuring taking place in
response to stricter capital requirements that took effect Dec. 7.
   Many institutions must shrink to meet the standards and when
they sell assets, they often are forced to recognized embedded
losses, he said.
   Non-operating losses at S&amp;Ls outside government control were
$1.9 billion, up from $1.4 billion in the previous quarter.
   Meanwhile, operating profits at the non-government thrifts
slipped from $900 million to $800 million because of the recent
pattern of interest rates, he said. Short-term rates paid on
deposits are almost as high as long-term rates S&amp;Ls can earn on
loans.
   Texas, as usual, recorded the biggest loss by any state, $998
million. However, that was an improvement from the $1.7 billion
loss a year ago. The second biggest loss came in Arizona $443
million, followed by California $426 million, Pennsylvania $322
million and Arkansas $246 million.
   Twenty-nine states recorded losses while 21 and the District of
Columbia and Puerto Rico reported profits. The largest profit, $24
million, came in Washington state.
   Former thrift office economist, James R. Barth of Auburn
University, warned that real estate problems once confined largely
to the Southwest were spreading.

   The government moved tanks and armored
cars into positions outside the U.S. Embassy Thursday after U.S.
soldiers surrounded the Nicaraguan Embassy in Panama, but later
withdrew them without explanation.
   President Daniel Ortega said earlier Thursday that ``if the U.S.
government withdraws the armored cars and troops that surround the
Nicaraguan Embassy, then we will respond in the same way here.''
   A curfew was in effect in Panama City and it was not immediately
known if the U.S. troops left the Nicaraguan and Cuban missions.
   Associated Press photographers in Managua saw at least seven
Soviet-made T-55 tanks, three armored personnel carriers and three
trucks of anti-aircraft weapons leave the embassy between 9:30 and
10:30 p.m. (10:30 and 11:30 EST).
   Embassy spokesman Lou Falino said people at the embassy heard
the noise of several engines ``but they could not determine if the
tanks were withdrawn because it was dark.'' He was contacted at his
home.
   American armored cars, part of a U.S. invading force, surrounded
the Nicaraguan and Cuban embassies in Panama City Thursday after
rumors spread that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was hiding in one of
the two missions.
   ``We have ordered exactly that the same thing be done here,
around the U.S. Embassy, as was done in Panama City,'' Foreign
Minister Miguel D'Escoto told a news conference. He indicated he
was holding the United States responsible for the safety of
Nicaraguan diplomats in Panama.
   Reporters in Managua saw the Soviet-made T-55 tanks and armored
carriers brought in Thursday afternoon and parked, partially
hidden, behind the U.S. Embassy.
   Each vehicle was manned by a crew of six and armed with a
machine gun and a light cannon. Col. Julio Ramos of the army
general staff personally supervised the deployment shortly after
midday.
   An AP photographer at the scene said at first the armored
carriers were pointing their machine guns and cannon away from the
embassy compound. But an officer ordered the crews to keep the
weapons aimed at the mission.
   Asked for comment, Ramos said he was acting ``on higher orders,
for reasons already explained by Foreign Minister D'Escoto.'' But
an unidentified officer, interviewed live by state radio, said
``this is in response for what they are doing to us now in Panama.''
   ``They have just surrounded our embassy in Panama, and they
think we are going to remain here with our arms crossed?'' the
officer added.
   D'Escoto told reporters Nicaragua has demanded ``the immediate
withdrawal of the invading, imperialist U.S. military presence
around our diplomatic mission in the independent and sovereign
Republic of Panama.''
   ``As soon as they dismantle their deployment there, we are going
to do the same here _ so, we are going to wait until they become
reasonable,'' D'Escoto added, calling the American encirclment of
the embassies in Panama City ``an act of intimidation.''
   He said there were women and children, as well as diplomats,
inside the Nicaraguan Embassy in Panama.
   Soviet-made T-55 tanks, guns, mortars and antiaircraft cannon
were in place all over Managua and in other strategic locations
around the country early Wednesday, hours after American troops
invaded Panama to oust and try to capture Noriega.
   The deposed strongman is wanted in the United States on
drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges.
   Nicaraguan officials said the measures were taken in case the
United States instigates military action against this country.
   For many years, Sandinista spokesmen have been saying the United
States intends to invade Nicaragua. U.S. officials have persistenly
denied this.
   Charge d'affaires John Leonard has been the senior diplomat here
since Ambassador Richard Melton was expelled July 11, 1988, after
the ruling leftist Sandinistas accused him of interfering in
Nicaragua's internal affairs.
   Relations between the Sandinista government and the United
States have been steadily deteriorating since 1980, about a year
after the Sandinistas came to power, when they established military
ties with Cuba and the Soviet Union.

   The bodies of 18 U.S.
servicemen killed in the invasion of Panama were returned Thursday
to Dover Air Force Base and honored during a brief planeside
ceremony.
   Shortly before midnight, the remains of 13 soldiers and one
Marine arrived on a C5 Galaxy in windy, 7-degree weather.
   Secretary of the Army Michael P.W. Stone said the servicemen
returned ``to a nation that is grateful, both for their duty in the
cause of liberty, and above all, for their sacrifice'' in defense
of demoracy.
   Earlier Thursday, the bodies of four U.S. Navy men killed during
the invasion of Panama were returned to the base and also honored
during a brief planeside ceremony.
   ``The four brave men we mourn here today now rest in the quiet
arms of a grateful nation and a loving God,'' said Navy Secretary
H. Lawrence Garrett III said. ``These magnificent young men have
made the greatest sacrifices for us all.''
   Garrett said the four men returned to ``our embrace'' having
fought for the liberty and dignity that Americans enjoy.
   Cmdr. Bob Prucha, a Navy spokesman, said the four were members
of the Navy special operations unit known as the SEALS. They died
leading the assault on Tortilla Air Field in Panama. Prucha did not
know if they were killed at the field or died later from wounds
suffered in the attack.
   ``All we can do is honor their memory by never forgetting that
our lives, under the banner of democracy, have been further
protected with their deaths,'' Garrett said.
   The four dead were identified as Boatswain's Mate 1st Class
Christopher Tilghman, 30, of Kailua, Hawaii; Lt. j.g. John P.
Connors, 25, of Arlington, Mass.; Chief Engineman Donald L. McFaul,
32, of San Diego, Calif.; and Torpedoman's mate Second Class Issac
G. Rodriguez III, 24, of Los Angeles.
   All four were stationed at the Naval Amphibious Base in Little
Creek, Va., near Norfolk.
   The base mortuary opened in 1968 and has handled the remains of
servicemen killed in the Vietnam War, Marines killed in a terrorist
bombing of their headquarters in Beirut and the remains of Navy men
killed in the USS Iowa explosion.

   President Bush says the United States will
hunt for deposed dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega for ``as long as
it takes'' to bring him to justice, at the same time thousands of
U.S. troops settle in on Panamanian soil to help restore order in a
chaotic country.
   ``This operation is not over, but it's pretty well wrapped up,''
Bush said Thursday at a news conference that coincided with return
of the first bodies of U.S. soldiers killed in the massive strike
in Panama.
   ``General Noriega is no longer in power. He no longer commands
the instruments of government or the forces of repression that he's
used for so long to brutalize the Panamanian people,'' Bush said.
   At the same time, the president said the U.S. military operation
was ``open-ended as far as going after Noriega, open-ended as far
as restoration of order in Panama,'' where looters were hauling
away goods from virtually every shop in Panama City. Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney said a sizeable troop presence would remain
until a ``condition of normalcy'' had returned.
   The Pentagon said 21 troops were killed in the first two days of
battle, 208 were wounded and one was missing. American military
aircraft were bringing the bodies of the dead back to Dover Air
Force Base in Delaware, their coffins draped with American flags.
   Bush, Cheney and other key administration officials hastened to
claim success for the military strike force at the same time the
United States came under criticism from Latin American nations for
its armed intervention. The Organization of American States held
backstage meetings on a resolution condemning the action, and Peru
withdrew its ambassador from Washington.
   U.S.-backed Panamanian President Guillermo Endara, in a
telephone interview from Panama City with ABC's ``Nightline,'' said
Thursday night he hoped to organize a new police force to take over
from the U.S. military within a month.
   Some congressmen called for the troops to be brought home
quickly, though one _ Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee _ said some might have to remain as policemen
until ``Christmas eve a year from now.''
   Said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater: ``We
certainly aren't willing to give a timetable to it. But everyone
recognizes this is not going to be a case of going in Wednesday and
coming out Thursday.''
   The president readied a formal report today for Congress
justifying his use of military force, as envisioned under the War
Powers Act.
   Asked at his White House news conference whether the potential
capture of Noriega was worth the cost in American lives, Bush
replied:
   ``No way can you do an operation this large and not have
American casualties. Every human life is precious. And yet, I have
to answer: yes, it has been worth it.''
   Military casualties, he said, ``are a burden which a nation must
endure and all presidents have to face up to, but which we can
never accept.''
   U.S. officials said 59 Panamanian soldiers were killed and 66
wounded. Army Lt. Gen. Tom Kelly said U.S. troops had taken 1,500
prisoners, most of them regulars from the Panamanian Defense Force.
   An American civilian, Candy Helin, 43, was killed by stray fire
from the Panamanian Defense Forces, officials said.
   Speaking a day after ordering 9,500 fighting men into Panama to
join more than 13,000 already stationed there, Bush said that
helping provide a stable environment for Endara's government helps
ensure the integrity of the Panama Canal.
   At one point, he used the word ``invade'' to refer to the U.S.
operation in Panama but caught himself and changed it to ``send in
those troops down into Panama.''
   Bush said that with Noriega on the run and Endara in office,
``The government is beginning to function and the man (Noriega)
controls no forces. And he's out. But, yes, I won't be satisfied
until we see him come to justice.''
   Meanwhile, Fitzwater said Bush still anticipates attending a
Feb. 15 drug summit with Latin American leaders in Cartagena,
Colombia, even though Peru's president, Alan Garcia, pulled his
ambassador from Washington in protest of the Panamanian
intervention and called for postponing the summit.
   Noriega is under indictment in the United States on
drug-smuggling charges and the president has offered a $1 million
bounty for him.
   ``His picture will be in every post office in town,'' said the
president. ``He's a fugitive drug dealer and we want to see him
brought to justice. And if that helps, if there's some incentive
for some Panamanian to turn him in, that's a million bucks that I
would be very happy to sign the check for.''
   The president acknowledged he had changed course from October,
when he was criticized for not supporting or joining the effort by
Panamanian officers to overthrow Noriega.
   ``I think what changed my mind was ... the death of the Marine,
brutalizing, really obscene torture of the Navy lieutenant and the
threat of sexual abuse and the terror inflicted on that Navy
lieutenant's wife, the declaration of war by Noriega,'' he said.

<HEAD>Controversy Over Whether Reporters Should Have Been Allowed Closer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. military in Panama opened the doors
to about 350 journalists today after two days of controversy about
restrictions put on the small pool of reporters who accompanied the
original troops.
   Some 50 newsmen and women arrived by charter plane late Thursday
from Costa Rica, and the U.S. Southern Command, based in Panama,
was bracing for the arrival early today of a jumbo jet carrying up
to 300 more.
   A special media pool, in its most significant test since the
concept was created, was activated Tuesday night and flown from
Washington to Panama. However, military officers on Wednesday kept
the journalists from actually covering any hostilities.
   Military commanders in Panama are doing their best to protect
members of the media covering the U.S. military action in that
country, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said.
   Asked about the problem, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
had a complaint of his own, claiming that a news organization had
broken pool security. He would not name the organization.
   ``We were greatly disturbed that one of the major organizations
had divulged their participation and departure before they left
here,'' Fitzwater said.
   It ``does call into question the integrity of the pool and the
commitments made,'' he said.
   News organizations which take part in the pool agree in advance
to keep its activation a secret. Tuesday night, the pool was
activated about six hours before the military assault was announced
publicly.
   Military officials in Panama said Thursday they would let the
new wave of reporters camp in the officer's club restaurant
initially but expected them to have their own accommodations by
Friday.
   Fitzwater's complaint about security was not echoed by the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin Powell.
   ``I think it worked marvelously the other evening,'' he said.
   ``We did what we promised you we would do and the media in the
pool did what they promised they would do,'' he said. Pool members
gathered late Tuesday night and were flown to Panama with the
invasion force under a promise of secrecy.
   ``There never was any concern in my mind it would break security
and it didn't,'' said Powell.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams, sitting with Cheney in an
interview with newspaper and wire service reporters, acknowledged
that ``we wish we could have done a better job getting people
around'' on Wednesday.
   ``I think there was adequate coverage. I think our commanders on
the scene had their priorities straight,'' said Cheney, noting that
media executives had called his office demanding that the military
protect reporters who were not in the pool.
   A photographer who was not in the pool was killed, and other
journalists were taken hostage by forces loyal to ousted Panamanian
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Before the joint Cheney-Powell interview, Williams was asked why
pool members had been restricted largely to interviews with U.S.
Embassy officials during most of the first day of the invasion. He
responded: ``Incompetence ... There really is no excuse for it.''

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega kept
extravagant quarters on the military base shared by the United
States and Panama, said U.S. soldiers Thursday who toured and
helped secure the building Noriega used.
   The structure, known as Building 8 at Fort Amador, contained a
cache of automatic weapons, a private movie theater and a poster of
Adolf Hitler on the wall in Noriega's library, the soldiers said.
   Until the U.S. invasion early Wednesday morning, the base was a
joint installation under terms of the Panama Canal Treaty.
   ``They have all our military manuals because we were allies,''
said Sgt. First Class Joseph Torregrossa, who looked over the
Noriega quarters Thursday.
   Torregrossa said the DEA report discovered was a 1986-87
hardcover book that read: ``The Battle Against Drugs in Panama.''
   Torregrossa said he found night-vision goggles in Noriega's
offices and fully-automatic weapons, top-of-the-line items like
Israeli Uzis. In all, about 250 weapons, including small
Derringers, were discovered, he said.
   Soldiers said Noriega's quarters, in the upper two floors of the
Building 8, contained plush carpeting, a fancy dining room and a
movie theater. There are no windows where Noriega spent his time,
one soldier said.
   ``This is what freaked me out,'' said another soldier identified
only as Sandridge. ``Underneath his glass coffee table he had a
ceramic leopard.''
   Sandridge said there was a row of Noriega bats and baseball caps
on a shelf and a box of Havana cigars, wrapped in paper printed
with the words: ``Manuel Antonio Noriega, 4 Stars.''
   Originally, reporters were to be taken to a so-called ``witch
house'' that is owned or was frequented by Noriega.
   According to folklore, the house contains entrails and vats of
blood. But after being diverted to the Army base to get clearance
to view the house, reporters were told ``a boobytrap'' had been
found inside and the house was not yet open to visits.

<TEXT>
   The losing candidate gained only 113 votes
in a recount that certified the victory of Democrat L. Douglas
Wilder as the first elected black governor in the nation's history.
   The recount, conducted at Republican J. Marshall Coleman's
request, was certified Thursday by a three-judge panel.
   While accepting the results, the Coleman camp claimed the tally
uncovered evidence that thousands of felons voted illegally,
indicating a need for election law reform.
   The recount conducted Wednesday found that Wilder defeated
Coleman 896,936 votes to 890,195 votes. The difference was 6,741
votes, making the gubernatorial race the closest in Virginia
history. The tally certified by the State Board of Elections on
Nov. 27 showed Wilder winning by 6,854 votes.
   Coleman issued a statement conceding that ``the outcome of this
hard-fought contest is no longer in doubt.''
   ``As an individual and as the nominee of my party, I cannot deny
that it hurts to come so close and yet fall short,'' Coleman said.
``But the system has worked, the people have spoken, and Doug
Wilder deserves and will have my full support as our new governor.''
   Wilder, who has said all along that the election would withstand
Coleman's challenge, repeated that position Thursday night.
   ``I never had any doubt about the outcome,'' Wilder said in a
brief written statement.
   Coleman contended that his investigation of alleged voting
irregularities found that as many as 4,000 felons are registered to
vote. As many as 3,000 of them may have voted, contended Coleman's
attorney, William Hurd.
   ``Clearly that was not enough to change the outcome of this
election,'' Hurd said.
   In Virginia, a citizen is automatically stripped of his right to
vote upon a felony conviction; the right can be restored under
certain circumstances.
   GOP legislators likely will introduce legislation to catch
felons who try to vote, Coleman said.

<HEAD>Study Supports Limited Use of Electroshock for Mental Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even though electroshock therapy may have had
a bad reputation in the past, the treatment is safe, effective and
important for a small percentage of mental patients, according to a
new study by the American Psychiatric Association.
   ``Despite its reputation in some circles, ECT (electroconvulsive
therapy, or electroshock) is not justified to be known as an unsafe
procedure,'' Dr. Richard Weiner, chairman of an APA committee that
studied the therapy, said at a news conference on Thursday.
   He said that use of ECT is controversial because ``it has had a
bad reputation in the press and it has had some abuses,'' but in
the hands of competent doctors electroshock is safe and effective.
   About 30,000 mental patients receive electroshock therapy
annually, said Weiner. Eighty percent of these patients suffer from
a profound, major depression that has not responded to drugs and he
said electroshock often represents the only way to put the illness
into a remission that would allow the use of other therapies.
   ``I think in the elderly it is considered the safest treatment
available, particularly for depression,'' Weiner said.
   Dr. Herbert Pardes, president of APA and a former director of
the National Institute of Mental Health, called ECT ``a safe and
very effective treatment for certain severe mental illnesses.''
   ``ECT's effectiveness in rescuing severely ill patients ... is
well accepted by psychiatrists, by the rest of the medical
community and by thousands of patients who are better because of
it,'' Pardes said.
   But, he noted, the therapy ``is not a cure and it does have some
adverse effects, such as memory loss in some patients.''
   Weiner, an associate professor of psychiatry at Duke University
Medical Center in Durham, N.C., directed an APA task-force study of
the use of ECT. The committee report released Thursday proposes
guidelines for the use of electroshock and details the type of
training health care workers need to receive before administering
it.
   Electroshock, in one form or another, has been used to treat the
mentally ill for more than 50 years. Its popularity with
psychiatrists has risen and fallen, but is enjoying renewed use.
   The therapy consists of using electrodes to send small charges
of electricity through select portions of the brain. The shocks
cause short seizures, similar to epileptic convulsions, that, for
reasons not understood, have a beneficial effect on some patients.
   In a typical course of treatment, patients receive six to 12
treatments at the rate of three a week. If the therapy puts the
illness into remission, doctors then use other treatment, such as
drugs, in an attempt to gain a cure.
   Despite its renewed use, Weiner said electroshock will continue
to be used for only 1 percent to 2 percent of all mental patients.
   ``For the majority of patients with significant depression,
there is an effective drug,'' he said. ``Only a very small
percentage have to go to ECT.''

<HEAD>Reagan and Judge in Poindexter Case at Odds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan and the judge in John
Poindexter's Iran-Contra case appear to be on a collision course
over the use of the ex-president's notes and diaries in court.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene on Thursday gave Reagan until
Jan. 7 to turn over to the court excerpts from those documents for
possible use at Poindexter's trial.
   Greene said he wants to review material from the ex-president
before deciding whether it should be supplied to Poindexter, who
subpoenaed documents Reagan may have relating to 67 meetings and
events. Fifty of them concern assistance to the Contras and 17
relate to the administration's secret arms sales to Iran.
   Greene said he is moving the start of the trial back a month to
Feb. 20 to deal with the subpoena and other issues.
   The former national security adviser says Reagan's documents
will bear out that the former president authorized activities for
which Poindexter now is charged with crimes.
   ``The Court will ... promptly conduct its ... review of the
Reagan documents ... and it will render a decision on the segments
of the subpoena that will be quashed and the parts of the Reagan
diary, notes and notebooks that must be made available'' for
Poindexter's defense, said the judge.
   Lawyers for Reagan and the Justice Department had offered to let
Greene see excerpts from the diary, but only if the former
president and the Bush administration were permitted to see a
proffer Poindexter filed spelling out why he believes he needs the
Reagan material.
   The judge flatly refused to let them see the proffer now.
   ``It would be going too far to accord to the attorneys for
President Reagan and for the incumbent president ... a special role
in the determination whether particular documents'' must be turned
over, said Greene. The judge noted their ``direct interest in the
outcome'' of the subpoena dispute and said transferring the court's
responsibilities to them would be ``unprecedented.''
   Greene said the Justice Department and Reagan will be permitted
to see the proffer next month, if the judge decides to turn the
material over to Poindexter and Reagan invokes executive privilege.
   Using executive privilege, presidents can shield from public
disclosure documents used in carrying out their constitutional
duties.
   Poindexter is accused of conspiracy, two counts of obstructing
Congress and two counts of making false statements. The charges
focus on his alleged lies about a November 1985 CIA-assisted
shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran and denials that North was
raising money and providing military advice to the Contras.
   Meanwhile, Iran-Contra prosecutors say Greene's restrictions on
Oliver L. North's testimony may make it impossible to use the
former White House aide as a witness against Poindexter.
   Greene said he would limit North's testimony because it might
have been tainted by Poindexter's immunized testimony on Capitol
Hill in 1987.
   The judge's decision rules out use of most of North's testimony
from his trial in April, in which North frequently mentioned his
former boss.
   But the office of the independent counsel Lawrence Walsh urged
Greene to ``permit North to testify to all events he currently
recalls ... even if his current recollection has been refreshed by
Poindexter's immunized testimony.''
   Refreshing his recollection from Poindexter's congressional
appearance ``does not constitute an impermissible use of that
immunized testimony,'' said prosecutors.
   North said last week he doesn't want to testify against
Poindexter.
   North's ``demonstrated unwillingness to answer substantively any
question posed to him by the government ... may well preclude ...
from calling this witness at all,'' Walsh's office said in court
papers.

<TEXT>
   U.S.-backed President Guillermo
Endara, promising ``peace and justice in Panama,'' is moving to
establish his government by organizing a new national police force
and making his first handful of appointments.
   Under heavy U.S. guard, Endara and his two vice presidents met
Thursday with members of the national legislative assembly. Later,
he said he hoped to organize a new police force to take over within
a month from U.S. military forces now seeking to impose order and
searching for ousted dictator Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``I think we can lift up the country and ... do our duty in
making peace and quiet in Panama, peace and justice in Panama with
Noriega in hiding,'' Endara said in a telephone interview with
ABC's ``Nightline'' program Thursday night.
   ``I hope in a month we can put up a police force, a public force
good enough to keep peace and order in all Panama. And then the
U.S. forces would leave according to what Mr. Bush promised us,''
Endara said.
   In Washington, President Bush told reporters on Thursday, ``I'm
pleased that the Endara government is taking charge, and they made
several appointments today _ starting to govern the country.''
   Endara said he talked to Bush by phone and asked him for
immediate emergency help in ``food and medicine for those who are
injured, hungry and sick.'' He said he was told aid was coming.
   Gunshots echoed in the streets outside as Endara _ making his
first appearance since he was sworn in early Wednesday _ and Vice
Presidents Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo Ford presided over
the legislative meeting. Sprinkled through the audience were U.S.
soldiers who wore jeans, sweatshirts and other civilian clothes at
the request of Panamanian officials who sought to avoid the image
of heavy U.S. control.
   In New York, Endara's designated envoy to the United Nations,
Eduardo Vallarino, said if Noriega is captured he should not be
extradited to the United States to face drug-smuggling charges but
should be tried in Panama.
   ``If Noriega is apprehended by the authorities in Panama, he
will have to be duly charged and tried in Panama,'' Vallarino said,
but added that the situation was ``irregular.''
   Speaking to the legislative assembly, Endara held out an olive
branch to Noriega's followers and said he would welcome back
members of Noriega's defense forces ``who can show they support our
democracy.''
   But he said on ABC that in organizing his new police force, he
would rely on officers ``that were not implicated in any kind of
corruption, officers who were not implicated in any kind of beating
of the people.''
   Endara asked Panamanian exiles to return because ``the military
dictatorship has fallen.''
   Endara ordered a curfew, expiring this morning, in hopes of
maintaining law and order as thousands of looters roamed the
streets smashing in windows and hauling away goods from virtually
every shop in the city.
   ``One of our first problems is that of anarchy and the civil
order,'' Endara told the national assembly. ``I hope these steps
and others will restore the order that we need,'' he said.
   Several people attending the session said they were grateful for
the U.S. intervention.
   ``The United States is responsible for delivering the dream we
have had since 1968,'' said cattleman Felix Espansona, an assembly
member in 1952-1956. ``We have had a dictatorship for 20 years and
now we feel liberated.''
   Vice President Ford said it will take some time to restore
order, but U.S. troops should leave ``the sooner the better.''
   The new government, by the accounts of most foreign observers,
overwhelmingly won an election on May 7, but Noriega canceled it
and continued his rule until U.S. troops invaded early Wednesday.
   Endara contended on ABC that even if Noriega remains at large he
would not be a major threat to the new government because he lacks
popular support.
   ``He was able to thwart the will of the people because he had a
dictatorship that was powered by fear,'' Endara said, but added,
``The people are not hiding Noriega ... I think Noriega really does
not count that much in Panama.''
   Endara appointed First Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon as
minister of government and justice, responsible for internal
security. He named Second Vice President Ford as minister of
planning and political economy.
   Endara also announced the appointments of Vallarino as
ambassador to the United Nations, Lauren Fabrega as ambassador to
the Organization of American States and Carlos Rodriguez as U.S.
ambassador.
   Francisco Rodriguez, who was appointed Noriega's provisional
president after election results were annulled, told reporters
Wednesday, ``We are prepared to resist.'' Rodriguez apparently was
in hiding Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Christmas and New Year's weekend traffic
accidents may claim as many as 770 lives this holiday season,
according to statisticians at the National Safety Council.
   The Chicago-based council issued its annual estimate Thursday,
basing it on data from previous years, seasonal weather factors and
national driving safety trends.
   The council said alcohol, a factor in more than half of all
fatal crashes, is a particular threat over the holidays, when
parties can lead to overindulgence.
   The council estimated between 320 and 420 people would die in
vehicular crashes during the official Christmas period, which
begins at 6 p.m. EST on Friday and ends at 11:59 p.m. local time
Monday.
   An additional 15,000 to 19,000 people may suffer disabling
injuries during the period, the council said.
   During last year's Christmas holiday, 386 people died and some
17,900 were injured.
   For the New Year's holiday period, which begins at 6 p.m. EST,
Friday, Dec, 29, and runs through 11:59 p.m., local time, Monday,
Jan. 1, the council predicted between 250 and 350 fatalities, plus
from 12,000 to 16,000 disabling injuries.
   Last year, 317 people died and about 14,700 suffered disabling
injuries over the New Year's period.

   The first sign of trouble came with the planes _ giant C-141 and
C-5 jet transports landing every ten minutes at Howard Air Force
Base, only four miles west of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's Panama
City headquarters.
   Hours later, just after midnight, mortar blasts and machine-gun
fire lit the sky. The dark shapes of helicopters roared through the
moonlit night, their running lights out.
   Operation Just Cause was under way. President Bush was striking
for Noriega, the accused drug trafficker who had controlled Panama
and thumbed his nose at American power for years.
   Thousands of soldiers, Marines, sailors and pilots were on the
move by 12:30 a.m. Wednesday. Paratroopers landed at Omar Torrijos
International Airport to secure it for landing.
   In a blaze of gunfire, American soldiers battled Panamanian
forces and surrounded Noriega's Defense Forces headquarters. By 2
a.m., flames a hundred feet high rose from the building.
   ``We're kicking ass tonight,'' boasted one U.S. soldier.
   But the target, Noriega, disappeared into the night. Noriega
bodyguard Lt. Asuncion Gaitan said by radio that the dictator had
been warned.
   Shortly after the fighting broke out, opposition leader
Guillermo Endara was sworn in as president and asked Panamanian
forces to surrender.
   Noriega loyalists, however, did not. And the massive U.S.
military operation turned bloody in the metropolis of 1 million.
   With garrisons destroyed or under siege, many Panamanian
officers in Noriega's 15,000-strong Defense Forces joined
paramilitary groups and the so-called Dignity Battalions of armed
citizens.
   A media war began.
   U.S.-controlled television urged surrender and said ``The United
States has no territorial ambitions in Panama,'' an unintentional
reminder that until a decade ago Washington controlled a
10-mile-wide zone through Panama's center.
   On a pro-Noriega radio network, radio announcers called for
neighborhood resistance and guerrilla war.
   The Panama Canal, the root of U.S.-Panama conflict by its very
existence, closed at 1 a.m. even though there were ships in the
waterway. Under 1977 treaties, the United States cedes control of
the canal by century's end.
   Frightened residents fled combat zones around the neighborhoods
of Chorillo and Old Panama, the colonial quarter of the city where
a Panamanian cavalry unit was based. In the neighborhood of San
Miguelito to the northeast, U.S. jets strafed a Defense Forces
barracks.
   Fighting was also reported at the Panamanian bases of Fort
Cimarron, 20 miles east of the capital; Rio Hato, 80 miles
southwest, and David, 240 miles to the west, where U.S. troops hit
the airport.
   Panamanian forces also attacked the U.S. Embassy and caused
light damage before it was secured by U.S. forces at around 4:30
a.m.
   During the morning armed Panamanians raided the luxury Marriott
Hotel and temporarily held 12 people, including eight Americans.
Elsewhere in Panama, Noriega supporters targeted U.S. citizens for
capture.
   Although scattered combat continued through the day, by 4 a.m.
Wednesday the heaviest fighting was over.
   At dawn, a pall of smoke lay over the city as dazed civilians
sought shelter. Santo Tomas Hospital, near the Defense Forces
headquarters, counted 80 bodies in its morgue and about 1,000
injured, hundreds of them civilians.
   Red Cross ambulances raced to pick up bodies rotting in
99-degree heat.
   The Pentagon said U.S. troops took 1,500 prisoners, most from
the Defense Force.
   In a somber speech on national television at 7 a.m. Wednesday,
President Bush announced that American servicemen had been killed.
The U.S. death toll began a climb into double figures.
   Bush said he ordered the invasion to protect the lives of 35,000
Americans in Panama in light of Noriega's announcement five days
earlier that Panama was in a ``state of war'' with the United
States.
   Bush said the assault was aimed at capturing Noriega, who had
just been named Panama's chief executive, to bring him to trial in
the United States on charges of cocaine trafficking.
   It was the first U.S. attack against a government since the 1986
air raid on Libya and the first U.S. invasion of a country since
the Grenada intervention in 1983.
   Latin American allies condemned the action and called for
withdrawal. The Soviet Union called it ``gunboat diplomacy.''
   Sources in Washington later said Bush decided on Sunday to mount
the assault, one day after a U.S. Marine lieutenant was killed at a
Panamanian Defense Forces checkpoint and a U.S. Navy couple was
held, beaten and the woman threatened sexually.
   Panama was tense after the killing of the Marine, with American
troops on maximum alert and Panamanian news media trying to whip up
a frenzy of anti-American sentiment, screaming that Bush was
preparing an invasion.
   On Monday, a U.S. Army officer wounded a Panamanian policeman
because he thought the man was going to draw a weapon.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III claimed the invasion came
after the administration received unconfirmed reports Noriega
planned to attack a U.S. residential neighborhood.
   On Wednesday, the Bush administration offered a $1 million
reward for information on Noriega's whereabouts.
   From an undisclosed location that night, the elusive Noriega
spoke briefly over national radio and vowed to fight. ``We're in
trench warfare now and we will maintain the resistance,'' he said.
   Pro-Noriega radio stations were able to keep broadcasting all
day, but finally were shut off the air shortly after Noriega made a
brief statement.
   On Thursday, the U.S. troops were in control of Panama's
strategic points but scattered fighting took place in the capital.
Despite a massive manhunt, Noriega remained at large.
   A massive wave of looting that began Wednesday spread throughout
the city Thursday. Every kind of business from bakeries to car
dealers was picked clean by swarming hordes of Panamanians.
Entrepreneurs stripped warehouses and set up bargain street stalls
to sell the merchandise.
   Endara, the candidate elected in a May 7 election nullified by
Noriega, left his shelter on a U.S. base and spoke at the National
Assembly, announcing a curfew to try to control looting.
   In the absence of police, who as members of the Defense Forces
were either in combat or vanished, his order had little effect.
   U.S. troops rescued 29 Americans and 35 foreign nationals
Wednesday night at the Marriott Hotel, but other U.S. citizens were
still missing Thursday and three photographers were shot, one of
them dead, by American troops in the hotel parking lot.
   The 51-mile Panama Canal opened Thursday, but only during
daylight hours. Not enough workers could get in to keep the canal
open at night, a spokesman said.
   The White House said the occupation could last for a
considerable time but Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said some
troops might return by Christmas. Other officials worried the
United States had impulsively entered an open-ended commitment that
might end in guerrilla war.
   Bush said Thursday the military mission ``is not over, but
pretty well wrapped up.''
   He vowed to continue the search for Noriega, who had commanded
the Defense Forces since 1983 and earned a reputation as a miracle
man by defying U.S. economic sanctions and frustrating two coup
attempts.

<TEXT>
   Uncertain prospects over interest rates in Japan
and the United States, coupled with the Panama situation, slumped
the dollar against the Japanese yen and share prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange today.
   The dollar closed at 143.67 yen, down 0.10 yen from Thursday's
close of 143.77 yen. After opening at 143.67 yen, the currency
ranged between 143.65 yen and 143.79 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 296.52-point
loser Thursday, lost 175.11 points, or 0.45 percent, closing the
week at 38,040.37.
   Masahiko Sahara, a dealer with Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd.,
said the market was ``unable to find the dollar's direction,''
squeezed by the issues of Japan's official discount rate and signs
of easing U.S. monetary credit.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, reiterating his earlier
stance of three days ago, told a news conference this morning that
current price and monetary conditions in Japan do not require
changes in monetary policy.
   But Hashimoto added monetary authorities will look at movements
in currency and money markets in determining when to raise the key
lending rate.
   Lower interest rates make a country's currency less attractive
to investors.
   Yasushi Mieno, the new governor of the Bank of Japan, said in an
interview with the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's largest economic
newspaper, that a discount-rate hike would be needed to stem
excessive price rises and stabilize the foreign exchange rate, the
paper reported today.
   During a briefing Thursday on wholesale price trends, central
bank officials said upward price pressures have been increasing
over the last few months.
   A Bank of Japan official, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity, said higher prices for oil and natural gas, the yen's
continued weakness and the effect of higher wages on prices in
certain sectors, such as machinery, were threatening price
stability.
   Earlier this week, news reports said the Bank of Japan planned
to raise its official discount rate by 0.5 percentage points from
the current 3.75 percent points some time this week. The Finance
Ministry and central bank officials have denied any central bank
action would be taken in the near future.
   The official discount rate, the rate the Bank of Japan charges
on loans to commercial banks, influences other domestic interest
rates.
   ``Speculation that the central bank now is considering to hike
its key lending rate next year, probably in January or early
February'' sent many investors reteating to the sidelines, said
Sachiko Hata, a dealer with Nikko Securities Co.
   Investors were wary how the situation in Panama following
Wednesday's U.S. military intervention in that Central American
country would develop, she said.
   Ms. Hata said prospects that the U.S. monetary authorities would
lower the nation's discount rate early next year also worked as a
negative factor in the day's securities market.

   The nation's worst drunken-driving
disaster has prompted federal and state officials nationwide to
work to make school buses safer.
   Kentucky, in particular, has approved new safety standards for
future school buses and is poised to toughen its drunken driving
laws after the fiery bus crash that killed 27 people, including 24
children.
   The crash happened when a church bus collided with a pickup
traveling the wrong way on Interstate 71 near Carrollton, Ky. A
jury on Thursday convicted the pickup's driver, Larry Mahoney, of
27 counts of second-degree manslaughter.
   The former school bus, owned by the First of Assembly of God
Church in Radcliff, Ky., burst into flames upon impact. Defense
lawyers contended that safety defects in the 1977 bus caused the
loss of more lives.
   Investigators said the victims were trapped inside the bus with
only one working exit and were overcome by smoke from a fire that
spread among highly flammable seats.
   The magnitude of the tragedy, exacerbated by its young victims'
ages, has drawn attention from all parts of the United States.
   ``There's been a lot of changes as a result of the Carrollton
accident than anything else we've seen,'' said Don Carnahan,
director of pupils' transportation in Washington state.
   Since the May 14, 1988, crash, officials at all levels of
government have taken steps to add emergency exits, install less
flammable materials, reconsider the location of the gas tank on
buses and restrict the use of older buses.
   Across the country, school officials, government regulators and
bus manufacturers say the crash has torpedoed a decade of
confidence in the safety of school buses _ confidence dating back
to the last extensive changes in federal regulations in 1977.
   The crash ``has caused more dialogue within the industry than
any other accident in recent history,'' said Ray Kroll, director of
transportation for Minneapolis schools and president of the
National Association for Pupil Transportation.
   In Kentucky, the state school board approved new safety
regulations in July for new school buses that will require them to
have roof-escape hatches, fire resistant interiors and a wider
space by the emergency exit.
   Those were among some of the recommendations made by the
National Transportation Safety Board after it concluded an
investigation of the bus crash.
   The board also urged the state to enact stricter laws for
driving under the influence.
   In its final report, the board praised the work of a task force
on drunken driving appointed by Gov. Wallace Wilkinson.
   Among the task force recommendations was proposed legislation
that would make it an offense for any driver to test above a 0.10
level on a blood alcohol level. Current law presumes that a driver
is intoxicated if they have a test at that level.
   A state attorney general's task force later recommended the
state lower the blood-alcohol level at which a person would be
considered legally drunk.
   Both proposals, among numerous others, will be dealt with when
the state Legislature convenes in January.

<HEAD>Chaos in Streets, Looters Drive Off With BMWs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taking advantage of chaos in the
streets and the absence of police, Panamanians ignored a curfew to
strip store shelves bare and drive spanking new BMWs off new car
lots.
   While people in some poor districts hawked the spoils of their
sprees at cut-rate prices, others fled bombs and gunfire as U.S.
troops hunted soldiers and paramilitary bands loyal to Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   To try to control the situation, U.S.-installed President
Guillermo Endara on Thursday ordered a curfew that was to last
until 6 a.m. today. But there was no one to enforce it.
   The police are part of the Panamanian Defense Forces, which
either scattered after the U.S. attack or are still fighting. U.S.
troops were busy chasing the resisters.
   At U.S. Southern Command, an officer said plans were being made
to start enforcment action.
   ``This city has been raped, both by the U.S. Army and by
looters,'' said one man along the Via Veneto, a row of fancy stores
near the hotel district.
   Planes dropped two bombs late Thursday in San Miguelito,
location of the Tinajitas garrison where Dignity Battalions and
other Noriega loyalists were holding out.
   Flares lit the dark sky and machine gun fire rattled in the
night. The firing had tailed off by early this morning.
   U.S. troops and armored personnel carriers surrounded the Cuban
and Nicaraguan embassies _ once they found them.
   ``Do you speak English? Do you know where the Cuban Embassy
is?'' asked one armored vehicle driver who had parked near the
Spanish Embassy. When told where to go, he roared off.
   Soldiers at U.S. checkpoints scrutinized identifications. At
some checkpoints soldiers checked IDs against lists of suspects.
Hundreds of Panamanians had been detained at the checkpoints but it
was unclear what was happening to them.
   Dignity Battalions temporarily took over a central hotel
district but appeared more interested in looting, vandalizing and
stealing cars than confronting U.S. troops.
   Thousands of people from children to grandparents poured through
peeled back iron doors on stores along Central Avenue, finding
products with flashlights and matches.
   Some looters hit the basics, like food, soap and toothpaste,
which could become scarce. Many were poor and said they had come to
look for clothes or Christmas presents.
   ``Somebody's going to take it anyway,'' said one embarrassed man
carrying a trash bag stuffed with loot. Like most Panamanians met
on the street, he refused to give his name.
   Others ran to more expensive tastes.
   On the road to the airport, where looting continued through the
afternoon, new BMWs were being driven off a car lot.
   At a large supermarket, one man got to the last case of
champagne, 12 bottles, picked it up and began walking out.
   ``Merry Christmas,'' he said.
   Teams of four or five men lugged furniture and large appliances.
A warehouse district near San Miguelito was sacked and some
buildings were burned.
   Some storeowners stayed put or hired armed guards.
   Stores that were open made customers stand outside barred gates
and give their orders to the owners, who took the money and passed
out merchandise through the bars.
   Much stolen merchandise ended up in impromptu markets in poor
districts. Designer brassieres, French champagne and Gucci watches
were going at bargain-basement prices.
   ``He doesn't have any running shoes for me, but I ordered a pair
for tomorrow,'' said a buyer, about 50 years old, at one of the
markets.
   ``Look,'' said a young man showing off a gold watch. ``I bought
it for $20. The salesman didn't even realize it is a Gucci.''
   Looking down on the scene from a nearby balcony, a middle-aged
woman shook her head in dismay.
   ``It makes me feel like sitting down and crying,'' she said as a
couple of handcarts were rolled down the street full of looted
merchandise.

<HEAD>Bush to Attend Drug Summit Despite Peru's Panama Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush still plans to attend a
February drug summit in Colombia even though Peru, the world's
largest cocaine producer, canceled its participation to protest the
U.S. assault on Panama.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday that Bush
will still go to Cartagena, Colombia as a show of support for
President Virgilio Barco, whose nation has been at war with drug
lords.
   Peru issued a strongly worded statement Wednesday condemning the
use of force in Panama, recalling its ambassador from Washington
and calling for a postponement of the scheduled Feb. 15 summit. It
did not offer an alternative date.
   The other two nations scheduled to attend the summit, Colombia
and Bolivia, issued statements condemning the U.S. actions in
Panama but did not mention the drug summit.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors say they will try again to convict
the teenager who is accused of selling undercover agents the crack
cocaine that President Bush used as a prop in a television address
on drugs.
   A federal judge declared a mistrial Thursday after jurors failed
to reach a verdict in the criminal case against Keith Jackson, who
is charged with selling the cocaine in Lafayette Park across the
street from the White House. Jackson, 18, also is accused of
distributing crack at a mall and twice near a high school.
   Federal drug agents who said they had bought drugs from Jackson
were ordered to buy cocaine in Lafayette Park for the president's
anti-drug address. Bush displayed a bag of crack cocaine in his
national address Sept. 5, saying that it showed the extent of the
drug problem.
   But jury forewoman Cheryl Adams-Huff told The Washington Post in
an interview published today, ``The majority of the jurors felt it
was a setup.''
   U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin scheduled a new trial
to begin Jan. 8.

   President Bush says he will press Mikhail S.
Gorbachev for freedom for Jews denied the right to emigrate from
the Soviet Union to join their families elsewhere.
   ``We'll get the job done,'' Bush promised an audience Thursday
at a ceremony in the Old Executive Office Building commemorating
the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, which begins Friday.
   Bush said that during the Dec. 2-3 summit with Gorbachev in
Malta, he presented the Soviet president with a list of 20
``refuseniks.''
   Gesturing toward the audience, which was sprinkled with newly
emigrated youngsters, Bush said, ``For sake of the children who are
with us today, from countries that still deny freedom of faith, we
will strive for the religious freedom their parents have never
known.''
   The Soviet Union has greatly loosened emigration restrictions in
recent years, and as a result Bush may grant that country trade
concessions denied in previous years.

<HEAD>Measles Explosion Bringing Increased Death, Too</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Measles has claimed more lives in 1989 than in
any year since 1971, mainly among unvaccinated preschoolers and
schoolchildren whose shots didn't work, federal health officials
say.
   So far this year, there have been 42 deaths among 14,714
reported measles cases, compared with 90 deaths among 75,290
measles cases reported in 1971, measles specialist Dr. William L.
Atkinson of the national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday.
   But Atkinson said the seemingly higher fatality rate _ 2.9
deaths per 1,000 measles cases so far in 1989, compared with 1.2
deaths per 1,000 cases in 1971 _may be deceptive. He suspects that
many milder cases have gone unreported in some urban areas this
year.
   As it is, there have been five times as many measles cases
reported in 1989 as the 2,876 reported by this time last year.
   In the first six months of this year, 30 percent of the cases
occurred in children under 5, who are too small to be covered by
school-vaccination laws, while 51 percent occurred among people
5-19.
   Half the cases were among people who had been vaccinated, the
CDC said.
   The CDC recommended this fall that children be given two
vaccinations, one at age 15 months, the second at about age 5. That
strategy is designed to break the spread of measles among
schoolchildren who were vaccinated young _ and had to prove it to
get in school _ but whose vaccinations, for some reason, failed to
protect them.
   But the new double-dose recommendation will do nothing to combat
the outbreak of measles among unvaccinated preschoolers, Atkinson
noted.
   ``We've got to find some sort of clever ways to motivate parents
to get their kids vaccinated,'' he said. ``A 15-month-old doesn't
walk in on his own.''
   Federal health officials believed measles eradication was within
reach early in this decade; just 1,497 cases were reported in 1983.
   But the disease, characterized by fever and a red, spotty rash,
has bounced back, although it remains far less common than it was
before a measles vaccine was introduced in 1963. Before then, it
was not unusual for the nation to report half a million cases a
year.

<HEAD>Flight 103 Anniversary Services Mix Sorrow and Anger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bells tolled and candles flickered in memory of those killed on
Pan Am Flight 103, but sorrow mixed with anger for some of the
mourners who feel their loved ones fell victim to inadequate
warning of the terrorist bombing.
   Memorial services in several Eastern cities and in Lockerbie,
Scotland, marked the first anniversary of the Dec. 21 disaster that
occurred when a bomb splintered the New York-bound 747, killing all
259 aboard and 11 on the ground.
   To the bereaved, as to the world at large, the tragedy seemed
more dreadful because it came at the height of holiday
preparations. Mary Mann, a friend of 20-year-old victim Julianne
Kelly, described the feeling to 500 mourners at St. Susanna's Roman
Catholic Church in Dedham, Mass.:
   ``On a day that began with making plans to attend Chistmas Mass,
we received word that Pan Am Flight 103 had exploded. Our holiday
season will never again be as happy as it was before the tragedy.''
   In North Adams, Mass., candles set in brown paper bags lined the
walkways to St. Francis of Assissi Church, where the names of all
the victims were read at a service for native Wendy Amy Lincoln, 23.
   Church bells pealed for the dead at 2:02 p.m. EST in Greensburg,
Pa., and Ramsey, N.J., among other places. Services were held in
New York City, Washington, D.C., and Ridgefield, Conn.
   In Lockerbie, a line of lanterns _ one for each victim _
flickered against a granite memorial dedicated before grieving
relatives and residents in a 19th century graveyard.
   Pan Am held memorial services at airports in New York, London
and Frankfurt, and employees observed a moment of silence at 2:02
p.m., said spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon.
   For some the anniversary was a time to vent anger at the airline
and the government for their perceived failure to warn travelers,
to detect the bomb hidden in a radio-cassette player, to prevent
the mass murder or to catch the terrorists responsible.
   In New York, about 50 of the 330 who attended services at St.
George's Episcopal Church held a silent march outside Pan Am's
offices, carrying signs with messages like, ``Pan Am Flight 103,
the truth must be known.''
   ``The pain will never go away and we have a great deal of
bitterness and emptiness at the lack of support from the
government,'' Jack Schultz, father of victim Thomas, 20, said at
the Connecticut service.
   In the year since the crash, relatives of the dead formed a
group called The Vicitims of Pan Am Flight 103 to work for better
airport security and press the government on the case.
   ``We feel this is a commitment we have made to our son's memory
and we must struggle to do everything we possibly can,'' said Doris
Cory of Old Lyme, Conn., whose son, Scott, was one of 35 Syracuse
University students killed. ``In this instance, my husband and I
feel this was a preventable terrorist act.''

   The Salvation Army in this
southeastern Massachusetts city has closed its doors because it has
run out of money, because of what officials said was an sharp
increase of people seeking aid.
   ``We've gone into using the canned food we had put aside for
January and February,'' Maj. Robert Pfeiffer, who runs the office,
said Thursday.
   Pfeiffer blamed local unemployment for bringing 1,600 families
to the office in the past year _ 300 more than last year. There
have been about 1,000 layoffs in the area in the last month, he
said.
   Pfeiffer said he didn't know when the office will reopen, but he
said he expects the doors to remain closed just through the
Christmas season.
   When he closed the doors at 2 p.m. Thursday, there were still
about 100 people waiting for help.
   ``We're going to help them, but at this point, we can't take any
more,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Long County, known as one of the Georgia
coast's great speed traps, became a goodwill trap for a day.
   Motorists got a firm handshake, a bag of fruit and an invitation
to return _ instead of a ticket. The project was the brainchild of
Danny Norman, chairman of the Long County Commission.
   Norman, Sheriff Cecil Nobles and off-duty Deputy Fred Williamson
made up the welcoming delegation. They had about a dozen large bags
of fruit to give away, and spent the afternoon waiting along U.S.
301 and U.S. 82 until they spotted a license plate from another
state.
   With blue lights flashing, they'd take up the chase.
   Norman said the idea would go a long way toward overcoming the
national notoriety as a speed trap that the county once possessed.
   ``You don't understand how much good, as small a thing as this
is, can do,'' Norman said. ``Multiply the number of people in the
car by 250, and you'll see what kind of positive impact you can
have with a bag of fruit.''
   One car they pulled over carried Arthur and Mildred Green of
Inglewood, Fla., who were en route to Dayton, Ohio. Norman told
them:
   ``Tell all your folks, and everyone you see, we want folks
coming through Long County.''
   Nobles suggested that the Greens ``come back and see us.''
   ``Thank you for everything,'' Green responded.

<HEAD>Murder Investigation Reopened After Civil Verdict Against Marcoses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investigation of the 1981 murders of two
Filipino union leaders has been reopened after a civil trial found
the late Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos liable for their
deaths, a prosecutor said.
   The victims, Silme Domingo and Gene Viernes, worked in this
country against Marcos, and their survivors claimed they were
killed on orders from the Philippines. Police laid their deaths to
union activities and three men were convicted.
   On Thursday, after meetings with attorneys for the dead men's
families, the King County Prosecutors Office announced the probe
would be reopened.
   ``We plan on taking a very serious look at the matter,'' said
prosecutor's spokesman Dan Donohoe.
   The follow-up investigation should take about two months,
Donohoe said.
   Last week the families of Domingo and Viernes won a civil suit
in U.S. District Court here against the estate of Marcos, who died
in September, and his widow, Imelda.
   The civil jury decided that Marcoses were conspirators in the
deaths of the two men and were negligent in failing to control
their intelligence agents in the United States. The families were
awarded more than $15 million.
   After the trial, Seattle attorney Michael Withey, who
represented the families, said the survivors wanted criminal
charges filed against the man whose gun was used in the killings in
light of evidence presented in their civil suit.
   The gun belonged to Constantine ``Tony'' Baruso, 61, of Seattle,
who was never charged in the case. Baruso was president of the
Alaska Cannery Workers Union when Domingo and Viernes were gunned
down at the union's Seattle headquarters.
   Baruso and Dr. Leonilo Malabed, a San Francisco physician who
allegedly managed an intelligence fund for Marcos, also were named
in the civil suit. Baruso and Malabed waived their right to a jury
trial and U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein has yet to rule on
their part of the case.
   In a related matter, attorneys defending Mrs. Marcos in a
federal racketeering case in New York have discussed a plea
bargain, but are preparing for the March 14 trial anyhow.
   The talks with prosecutors were ``preliminary chitchat'' and
haven't led to any sort of deal for her to plead guilty to lesser
charges, said Mrs. Marcos's lawyer, John J. Tigue.
   The charges stem from allegations she and her late husband
siphoned more than $100 million from the Philippines treasury and
funneled it into this country for the purchase of New York real
estate and art.
   The prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella, refused
to comment on the negotiations.

   Plenty of evidence of winter was available today on the first
full day of the season, with wind chill readings down to 80 degrees
below zero and up to 1{ feet of snow in the nation's Northern
regions.
   Meanwhile, Miami reported a record high of 81 degrees Thursday,
tying a 1948 record for the date.
   Brutally cold, windy conditions were reported across much of the
Central and Northeastern United States. On Thursday, strong
northerly winds kept temperatures dropping right through the
morning and afternoon hours.
   Temperatures remained below freezing all day from the Texas
plains to the northern half of the Atlantic Coast.
   Temperatures remained below zero all day across the upper half
of the Mississippi Valley, the northern Plains and much of the
central Plains. In north-central Montana, the mercury hovered close
to 40 degrees below zero all day at Havre.
   A total of 40 cities reported new record lows Thursday,
including 13 cities in Iowa.
   The cold created shortages of heating oil in some Northeastern
depots, and led the Tennessee Valley Authority to ask its customers
to reduce their morning electrical use. Schools were closed in many
Central and Northern states.
   More records were expected to be broken today and Saturday.
   Wind chill readings of 70 to 80 degrees below zero were forecast
for early today in the north-central states and down to 50 degrees
below in the Northeast. Squalls were producing heavy snow over
parts of the Great Lakes, with up to 16 inches in northern Indiana,
and smaller amounts in Ohio and Pennsylvania.
   A mixture of snow, sleet and freezing rain was forecast for
southern Texas, with a snow advisory in effect for the panhandle
and Texas plains.
   A gale warning was posted along the western Gulf late Thursday.
   Temperatures were above 50 degrees Thursday in extreme southern
Texas, Florida and parts of Georgia and South Carolina.
   The high for the nation Thursday was 82 degrees at Key West, Fla.
   Sunny skies and mild temperatures prevailed west of the Rockies,
with highs mostly in the 40s and 50s, and in the 60s and 70s in
Southern California and southern Arizona.

<TEXT>
   Romania's embattled leadership declared a
state of emergency Friday as a popular revolt spread throughout the
country, Yugoslavia's official Tanjug news agency reported from
Bucharest.
   Tanjug's report said the situation in the country that President
Nicolae Ceausescu has ruled with an iron fist for 24 years was
``dramatic.''
   Some reports said Ceausescu was preparing to flee the country.
   Troops reportedly killed at least 13 people in Bucharest on
Thursday in a crackdown on thousands of demonstrators who jeered a
speech by Ceausescu.
   Various news agencies said Defense Minister Vasile Milea had
committed suicide. The British Broadcasting Corp. said he had
blamed himself for the nationwide unrest that was touched off by
the weekend massacre of hundreds of protesters in the western city
of Timisoara.
   New protests reportedly occurred in Bucharest Friday morning,
and Tanjug said security forces opened fire. There were no reports
of casualties.
   Tanjug said protesters began gathering at 9:00 a.m. in the
capital, chanting ``join us, join us,'' as they marched through the
streets.
   Later Friday, the Bulgarian state news agency BTA reported from
Bucharest that the army had withdrawn from the streets and that
soldiers were ``fraternizing with the people.'' It said that all
police in front of the Intercontinental Hotel _ the scene of
protests Thursday _ had withdrawn.
   The massive unrest, reported in at least eight cities, indicated
Romanians have been caught up in the pro-democracy movements
sweeping Eastern Europe and are no longer willing to tolerate
Ceausescu's repression and the harships he has forced on them.
   There were reports of a general strike in Timisoara and
similarly unconfirmed reports that a major factory in Bucharest
which employs some 20,000 people had gone on strike on Friday.
   Austrian television quoted Romanian exiles as saying Ceausescu
could possibly be leaving the country and heading for exile in
China.
   Western reports, citing witness accounts, said planes were seen
being loaded at Bucharest airport with goods, indicating Ceausescu
and his family could be preparing to leave.
   Ceausescu declared a state of emergency in the Timisoara region
late Wednesday, but the nationwide declaration indicated the unrest
had spread to other parts of the country.
   Romanian Television announced a special program on Friday and
radio was playing military music, Hungarian Radio said.
   A presidential decree said the state of emergency was necessary
because of ``the serious violation of public order through
terrorist acts, vandalism and destruction of public assets,'' the
BBC said, quoting Hungarian Radio.

   Dwane Wallace, who guided Cessna Aircraft
Co. to dominance in the light plane industry, died Thursday of a
stroke at age 78.
   Wallace worked briefly as an engineer for Walter Beech, founder
of Beech Aircraft Corp., in 1933. He assumed control at Cessna
after his uncle, company founder Clyde Cessna, was forced to close
by the Depression.
   Wallace and his attorney brother, Dwight, reopened the company
in 1934 in Wichita. Clyde Cessna, who had started it in 1927, was
installed as president. Dwane Wallace was general manager.
   The first Dwane Wallace design Cessna manufactured, the C-34,
was a classic monoplane that became world reknowned as the Cessna
Airmaster.
   Wallace relinquished his board chairmanship at Cessna in 1975,
staying on as a $75,000-a-year consultant and a board member.

Romania for 24 years.
   The Communist leader was reported preparing to flee the country,
Romanian emigres said.
   Demonstrators who took part in anti-government marches marched
on the radio, which broadcast their declaration, ``Our beloved
Romanians, we are coming now from the center of the capital. We
must take our fate in our hands.''
   Widespread unrest began over the weekend in the western city of
Timosoara and spread to other cities after troops fired on
demonstrators, killing hundreds of people.

   Drum rolls echoed through the
frigid night air as 14 flag-draped caskets were carried slowly from
a cargo jet and loaded into waiting hearses.
   The remains of U.S. servicemen killed in Panama were brought
home early today in the second such ceremony in less than 24 hours.
   On Thursday, the remains of four Navy men arrived to a solemn
runway ceremony at this base, which houses the Defense Department's
largest mortuary.
   Just after midnight this morning, military officials and the
family of one of the dead men braved 7-degree temperatures and wind
that made it feel like 25 below to honor 13 Army soldiers and one
Marine killed in the U.S. invasion of Panama this week.
   U.S. Army Secretary Michael P.W. Stone said the men died
defending freedom.
   ``We honor now the men whose lives represent our country's
latest losses in that long-lasting vigil ... We honor your courage,
your devotion and your loss. The nation honors your memory,'' Stone
said.
   Marine Lt. Gen. Norman Smith said Cpl. Garreth C. Isaak, 22, of
Greenville, S.C., ``paid the ultimate in carrying out his mission
to help preserve human dignity and freedom.''
   The parents and two brothers of Army Staff Sgt. Larry R. Barnard
of Hallstead, Pa., attended the ceremony. The Rev. Marilyn Barnard,
her husband, Raymond, and their two sons declined to talk to
reporters.
   Friends said Larry Barnard married his high-school sweetheart,
Tammy, and they had a 10-year-old daughter and a younger set of
twins.
   Ten evacuees from Panama, all of them believed to be civilians,
also arrived at the base Thursday night, according to base
spokesman Capt. Walter Thorp. They refused to comment to reporters.
   The Navy divers were killed leading the assault on Paitilla Air
Field, where deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega kept
aircraft, said Cmdr. Bob Prucha Prucha, a Navy spokesman.
   The remains will be prepared for burial and then transferred to
their next of kin.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega had begun work on
his memoirs and met with a New York lawyer to discuss publishing
rights the day U.S. forces invaded Panama, a newspaper reported
today.
   The Panamanian strongman knew at the time of the Tuesday meeting
that a U.S. invasion was imminent, a member of the law firm told
New York Newsday.
   Noriega had gathered material, including details of his work for
U.S. intelligence and his rise to power through the Panamanian
military, said attorney Barry Slotnick.
   ``He realized his time was very short in terms of his ability to
maintain himself in Panama,'' Slotnick said. The firm Slotnick and
Baker has held extensive talks with Noriega about the U.S.
indictments against him on drug trafficking charges, Slotnick said.
   He said Noriega met a member of the firm Tuesday in Panama City
to discuss publishing arrangements. Noriega said a ``substantial
portion'' of the manuscript had been finished.
   ``He knew the Justice Department wanted him on trial; he was
aware the United States was going to invade; he felt they wanted to
kill or capture him,'' said Slotnick, adding Noriega appeared calm
during the meeting.
   U.S. forces invaded Panama at midnight Tuesday.
   A publisher hasn't been found and a price hadn't been discussed,
Slotnick said. He said Noriega refused to approach a publisher in
the United States, or permit a U.S. company to base a movie or
television drama on it.

<HEAD>FBI Disputes Tale of Hoffa Burial at Giants Stadium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI says it hasn't solved the disappearance
of Jimmy Hoffa, but isn't giving much credit to a mob informant's
story that the union leader was dismembered and buried under Giants
Stadium in New Jersey.
   After investigating a description of the ex-Teamsters union
leader's death by Donald ``Tony the Greek'' Frankos in the November
issue of Playboy magazine, the FBI said Thursday that evidence
doesn't support the account.
   Frankos claimed Hoffa was shot to death in the Detroit area, and
that his dismembered body was trucked to New Jersey and buried
under the football stadium, which was being built in East
Rutherford, N.J.
   ``We have conducted an investigation concerning his assertions
and cannot find any substantiation for what he said,'' said Hal
Helterhoff, special agent in charge of the FBI in Michigan. ``Never
say never, but it is a remote possibility he is buried there.''
   The Hoffa case remains open, Helterhoff said, adding that the
FBI was investigating statements by Frankos and other leads
unrelated to his story.
   The former Teamster leader disappeared without a trace in July
1975 outside a Detroit restaurant.
   FBI officials have said previously they believe Hoffa was slain
and know who did it but are unable to get proof.
   Helterhoff said parts of Frankos' story in Playboy were true,
but nothing specific about the alleged murder and burial of Hoffa
was substantiated. Agents investigated mob figures Frankos
mentioned and assessed times and dates to check his story,
Helterhoff said.

<HEAD>United Artists Plans To Close Theater Where Oswald Was Captured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A perservation group is trying to save the
landmark Texas Theater, the movie house where Lee Harvey Oswald was
captured after the assassination of President Kennedy.
   The theater, built in 1931 by billionaire Howard Hughes and
considered one of the finest movie houses in Texas at the time, is
scheduled to close Dec. 31. United Artists, which owns the theater
in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas, says the Texas is losing money
showing second-run movies for a dollar.
   The Texas Theater Historical Society made a hurried appeal to
the company Thursday after learning of its decision earlier this
week to close the theater. The group says the Texas has historical
significance _ both as an example of a 1930s-style movie palace and
because of the Oswald connection.
   ``It's just losing money,'' said Dale Chappell, general manager
of the southwest division of UA Theaters. ``Our company's policy is
to close down the theaters that are not profitable.''
   ``We're not picking on the Texas,'' Chappell said, noting that
UA had closed 17 theaters this year, including five or six in this
region, because of their inability to make money.
   On Nov. 22, 1963, the movie house gained notoriety as the place
where Dallas police captured Oswald after Kennedy was shot.
   The Warren Commission later concluded that Oswald shot Kennedy
from a sniper's perch in the Texas Schoolbook Depository building
on the edge of downtown Dallas.
   The historical society was formed to work with UA or a future
owner to preserve the theater and help it turn a profit, the
society's president, Dennis Hamilton, said in a letter to UA. The
society is seeking to buy, lease or be given the theater, the
letter said.
   ``They say it's not making any money and that they're trying to
cut their losses,'' said Cheryl Griffith, secretary of the Texas
Theater Historical Society. ``But you can't give a movie house
third- and fourth-rate movies and expect it to make money,'' she
said.
   This week, the theater was showing ``Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade,'' which made its big splash in the summer.
   UA's Chappell said the company, which has owned the theater
since the mid-1950s, would consider proposals from the preservation
group.
   ``I think there's a real possibility of leasing it out,''
Chappell said. ``Some of the others we've closed, we've leased
out.''
   Donating the property, however, would be another matter, he said.

   The dollar fell against all major foreign

prices were up slightly in thin dealings.
   Traders said many market players already have left for extended

   The first foreign journalist known to
die in the U.S. invasion was a photographer for a Spanish newspaper
killed in ``friendly'' crossfire between American troops in the
capital.
   Two other photojournalists were wounded Thursday in the same
exchange.
   A CBS news producer seized by Panamanian gunmen on Wednesday was
still missing today. He had been grabbed the Marriott Hotel before
it was secured by U.S. troops in the force that invaded to depose
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   In the action, a Mexican television crew was briefly detained by
Panamanian gunmen.
   Juan Antonio Rodriguez, a photographer for Spain's largest
newspaper, El Pais, was killed Thursday outside the Marriott Hotel,
said Tomas Lozano, the Spanish ambassador.
   Rodriguez died when American troops mistakenly fired upon each
other in the hotel parking lot, said Maruja Torres, a correspondent
for El Pais.
   Patrick Chauvel, a French photographer for the Sygma photo
agency, was shot in the stomach, said Jacques Rummelhardt, France's
ambassador to Panama.
   Chauvel was listed in serious condition at the U.S. military's
Gorgas Hospital, Rummelhardt said. He was on assignment for
Newsweek magazine.
   Malcolm Linton, an English photographer for the Reuters news
agency, was shot in the leg, said Tom Brown, a Reuter editor.
Linton was listed in good condition at Gorgas Hospital, Brown said.
   U.S. troops had occupied the hotel Wednesday night to rescue
trapped guests and were evacuating them Thursday when the incident
occurred.
   Six journalists were standing outside in the parking lot when a
U.S. armored personnel carrier began approaching, Torres said.
   Apparently thinking the personnel carrier belonged to Panamanian
forces, U.S. troops inside the hotel yelled at the journalists to
get out of the way, then opened fire as they scattered, said Torres.
   ``They fired on us savagely, they don't have any respect for
journalists,'' said Torres.
   The personnel carrier, which turned out to be American, returned
fire briefly, said Torres.
   The journalists took refuge in a nearby house and were trapped
for a time by gunfire in the area.
   In New York, CBS asked U.S. and Central American officials for
help in finding missing news producer Jon Meyersohn, according to
CBS News President David Burke.
   Gunmen abducted Meyersohn and ABC News producer Robert Campos on
Wednesday morning in the lobby of the Marriott. Campos was freed
unharmed that afternoon.
   A television crew for Mexico's private Televisa network was
detained for 2{ hours Thursday by members of the civilian Dignity
Battalions that support Noriega.
   Televisa correspondent Rita Ganem said she and three cameramen
were confronted by the militiamen in the city of Concepcion, about
15 miles east of Panama's border with Costa Rica.
   The paramilitaries took their passports and other
identification, money and jewelry before releasing them, Ms. Ganem
said. The journalists made their way back to Costa Rica. Also
detained were cameramen Alfredo Acosta, Antonio Jasso and Anastasio
Valle.
   Meanwhile, a London-based television news agency charged
Thursday that a U.S. Army soldier confiscated the tape of a TV
cameraman who shot pictures of American troops surrounding the
Nicaraguan and Cuban embassies in Panama City.
   Robert Sullivan, New York bureau chief of Worldwide Television
News, said the agency planned to file a complaint with the
Pentagon. WTN is co-owned by ABC and includes ABC and CNN among its
clients.
   Sullivan said cameraman Alejandro Carbonnel was shooting
pictures when an army sergeant approached him and confiscated the
videotape. The unidentified soldier said Carbonnel ``had to have
permission from the Southern Command to shoot here,'' Sullivan said.
   The Southern Command is responsible for all U.S. military
operations in Latin America.

   There's finally light at the end of the tunnel
for a train full of sewage that was rejected from two states.
   The 61 carloads are to be unloaded at the sewage plant where
they originated, but the latest problem is cold _ it's slow work
unloading frozen sludge.
   Rejected from dumps in Louisiana and Mississippi, the train and
its 5,000 tons of waste has come home, to be returned to the Back
River Waste Treatment Plant, where the ordeal began nearly three
months ago.
   The odors that offended noses down South are now just an
unpleasant memory, as workers use jackhammers and special front-end
loaders to break up the frozen cargo to meet a state-imposed
deadline of Dec. 31 for disposal of the sludge.
   George G. Balog, director of the city's Public Works Department,
said Thursday that the sludge would be stored temporarily in the
Back River ``winter storage lagoon,'' then disinfected and
partially retreated for combining with the plant's normal output of
waste.

<TEXT>
   Latin American states voted today an
expression of deep ``regret'' of U.S. military force in Panama and
urged an immediate end to fighting there.
   The vote after a marathon emergency session of the Organization
of American States also called for the withdrawal of troops used in
the U.S. action, but it did not condemn the intervention outright
and sought no timetable for the American troops to leave.
   A resolution by Nicaragua to condemn the use of force to oust
Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from power was not formally
considered.
   John Maisto, the U.S. deputy permanent representative to the
OAS, called the final resolution ``a mixed bag. ... We're a little
disappointed. It certainly wasn't an extreme resolution, but it's a
little detached from what is really happening in Panama.''
   The OAS political council voted 20-1 with six abstentions ``to
deeply regret the military intervention in Panama.''
   The Spanish-language version of the resolution distributed after
the vote used the words ``deplorar profundamente,'' which
translates more closely to ``deeply deplore.'' But James Todd, a
spokesman for the U.S. delegation, said the stronger Spanish
language was a mistranslation of a resolution drafted in English
and he expected a clarification later in the day.
   ``The English version was circulated and voted on. We're using
the English,'' said Todd.
   The resolution noted ``the serious events (in Panama),
especially the armed clashes resulting from the military
intervention by the United States and the deplorable loss of lives
and property.''
   U.S. Ambassador Luigi Enaudi cast the only negative vote on the
motion engineered by Peru, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Uruguay and
Argentina.
   The resolution urged ``the immediate cessation of hostilities
and bloodshed (in Panama) and the launching of negotiations between
the various political sectors of that country that will lead to a
concerted solution of the Panamanian institutional crisis.''
   ``There was not a condemnation,'' said Maisto. ``It was just an
expression of the need for withdrawal (of troops), which is not
unlike what President Bush has called for _ when the job is
completed.''
   A U.S. attempt to term the invasion a ``military action'' failed
with only three votes among the 26 delegates who attended the
17-hour debate and negotiation. Only Honduras and Costa Rica
supported the United States.
   Another amendment by Costa Rica and Guatemala to blame Noriega
for the ``chaos and anarchy'' that prompted the U.S. move was also
defected by a 7-2 vote with 12 abstentions.
   Venezuela was the only leading Latin democracy to abstain from
the final vote. Venezuela has urged the OAS to express some form of
recognition to the U.S.-installed government of President Guillermo
Endara.
   The OAS said it ``reaffirmed that solving the crisis Panama is
undergoing at this time necessarily requires the full respect for
the right of the Panamanian people to self-determination without
outside interference and faithful adherence to the letter and
spirit of the treaties'' under which the United States is to turn
the Panama Canal over to Panama in 2000.
   The security of the canal is one of the reasons cited by the
Bush administration for launching the invasion.
   Enaudi also failed by an 11-4 vote with two abstentions in an
attempt to add to the resolution a mention that the OAS charter
itself allows each nation the right of self-defense.
   Enaudi said that once Noriega declared a state of war against
the United States, the U.S. government ``clearly have the
legitimate right of self-defense''.
   Enaudi also said the U.S. has tried to work out a peacefully
solution of the Panamanian situation thought the OAS but ``it is
impossible to reason with a dictator. At the end, Noriega has got
what he deserved.''

<HEAD>Protests In Three Capitals, Garcia Says He Won't Meet With Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of protesters angered by the invasion
of Panama marched outside the U.S. Embassy in Lima and at American
missions in two other Latin American capitals.
   President Alan Garcia, a strong critic of the U.S. action in
Panama, on Thursday repeated his proposal to postpone the Feb. 15
drug summit with President Bush and the presidents of three Andean
nations.
   ``I cannot meet with the leader of an invading nation,'' he said.
   In Washington, the Organization of American States suspended its
session Thursday five minutes after it opened because delegations
were divided on the wording of a resolution condemning the U.S.
action.
   OAS Chairman Angus Albert Khan of Trinidad and Tobago said he
was approached by several delegations asking for more time before
debate begins on a resolution submitted Wednesday by Nicaragua. He
did not say when the session would resume.
   Thousands of American troops were sent to the Central American
nation Wednesday to topple the government of Gen. Manuel Noriega,
who is wanted in the United States on drug trafficking charges and
who voided free elections in May.
   Hundreds of protesters chanting anti-American slogans marched in
downtown Lima Thursday night and burned an American flag near the
U.S. Embassy to protest U.S. military actions in Panama.
   In Mexico City about 2,000 people, shouting ``Yankee killers!''
and ``American terrorism!'' gathered outside the U.S. Embassy for
the second such demonstration there in as many days.
   Protesters threw rocks and eggs filled with red and blue paint _
the colors of Panama's flag _ leaving the embassy's white marble
facade speckled with at least a dozen stains. More than 100 police
officers kept the crowd from rushing a barricade and no injuries or
other incidents were reported.
   In the Dominican Republic, about 200 protesters picketed in
front of the U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo. President Joaquin
Balaguer condemned the U.S. invasion, calling it a violation of
Panamanians' right to self-determination.
   Bush is to meet with Garcia and Presidents Virgilio Barco of
Colombia and Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia on Feb. 15 in Cartagena,
Colombia, to discuss how to fight drug trafficking in the four
countries.
   But in a communique released Thursday by the Peruvian government
news agency Andina, Garcia said, ``Holding a dialogue with a pistol
on the table cannot be tolerated.''
   The communique did not give a time or set conditions under which
the summit should be held.
   Referring to the U.S. intervention in Panama, Garcia said in the
communique that the United States ``could seek to do the same in
Peru if it should think the (Peruvian) government isn't doing
enough to fight drug trafficking.''
   In Bogota, Foreign Minister Julio Londonno said the United
States must pull its invading forces out before Latin American
nations will work for a solution to the Panama crisis.
   ``No country can assume the right of intervene, directly or
indirectly, in other state's affairs, whatever reasons or purposes
it may have, much less militarily,'' he told a news conference.
   Some Latin American leaders, including Venezuelan president
Carlos Andres Perez, have proposed a recognition of Guillermo
Endara as Panama's president in exchange for an immediate
withdrawal of U.S. troops.
   Endara, winner of the May 7 presidential elections annulled by
the Noriega government, proclaimed himself president on Wednesday
as the invasion began.

<HEAD>Farmers Offer Initiative to Counter Proposed Pesticide Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State farming and grocers' groups hope to
weed out an anti-pesticide ballot initiative sponsored by
environmentalists with a countermeasure aimed at cultivating more
trust in food safety.
   A coalition of agricultural groups Thursday unveiled a proposed
59-page ``wholesome food'' initiative that would double the amount
of food tested by the state for pesticide residues.
   But advocates of the anti-pesticide measure, which would phase
out the use of suspected cancer-causing pesticides over six years,
say the farming groups' countermeasure was designed to enhance its
image without eliminating toxic bug-killers.
   ``This is not to protect food, this is to protect their
privileged position, their status quo,'' said Assemblyman Tom
Hayden, who is co-sponsoring the anti-pesticide initiative with
Attorney General John Van de Kamp for the November 1990 ballot.
   The measure promoted by Hayden, Van de Kamp and environmental
groups deals with a variety of issues, including global warming and
offshore oil spills.
   But to farmers, the important part is the provision to phase out
the use of known cancer-causing pesticides. Opponents say that
would eliminate 70 percent to 80 percent of the registered
chemicals now used on California-grown food, reducing quality and
quantity.
   ``The Hayden-Van de Kamp measure is irresponsible. It takes a
sledgehammer approach rather than a common-sense approach to the
food safety issue,'' said Jasper Hempel, vice president of
government affairs for Western Growers Association.
   ``We've come up with a better mousetrap to reassure, or assure,
the public that our California-grown food is in fact safe,'' he
said.
   The farmers' measure is being pushed by a coalition calling
itself Californians for Responsible Food Laws, or CAREFUL.
   It would, among other things, double the amount of food tested
for pesticide residue, mandate a state review of children's health
protection laws and increase Mediterranean fruit fly eradication
research.
   But Hempel said the main goal of the measure was to forestall
the ``radical'' pesticide phase-out proposed in the environmental
bill.
   The coalition, which plans to begin gathering signatures for the
ballot measure in February, has hired a political consulting firm,
the Dolphin Group, and is prepared to spend $3 million to $5
million on the initiative campaign, said Lee Stitzenberger, a
political consultant with Dolphin.
   Signatures to qualify the anti-pesticide measure for the
November ballot already were being collected.
   Each bill needs 372,178 signatures of registered voters to
secure a place on the ballot.

   U.S. troops storming the ``Witch
House'' quarters of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega found cigarettes
smoking in ashtrays and believe they missed the Panamanian fugitive
by minutes, military sources say.
   The Witch House, one of Noriega's residences, was filled with
bizarre black magic paraphernalia. Another of the ousted dictator's
quarters was decorated with portraits of Nazi dictator Adolf
Hitler, American servicemen told reporters on Thursday.
   The Witch House is on the sea coast near Panama City, close to
several U.S. military bases.
   Military investigators believe that the house may have been
booby-trapped and would not allow reporters and photographers
inside until it could be made safe, said Gen. John Huston.
   Soldiers on the scene some six hours after the fighting started
said they thought Noriega may have made a narrow escape.
   ``The cigarettes were still smoking in the ashtray and the women
left their purses, which no woman would ever usually do,'' said a
soldier familiar with the house.
   Troops who saw the house spread word that the room in which the
purses were found was apparently devoted to the occult, with signs
of animal entrails and ``vats of blood,'' the soldier said.
   Military officials could not immediately confirm the soldier's
account. He declined to permit use of his name.
   Sgt. 1st Class Joseph Torregrossa said there were some bizarre
trappings in Noriega's private office in the No. 8 building of
Panama's military barracks at Fort Amador.
   ``When we went inside, there were all of these expensive prints,
but he also had a portrait of Adolf Hitler and a lot of expensive
weapons, mostly automatic,'' Torregrossa said.
   ``He had German Lugers, Israeli Uzis (and) all sorts of real
sophisticated stuff.''

   The United States' intervention in Panama was
rejected today by Latin American neighbors who called for an end to
the bloodshed and a U.S. withdrawal. President Bush notified
Congress that he could not predict the ``precise scope and
duration'' of the military operation.
   The War Powers Act requires the president to formally notify
Congress anytime he commits military force. In a written message,
Bush accused deposed Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega of
directing ``vicious and brutal acts'' against Americans and
asserted that the lives and welfare of U.S. citizens had been
``increasingly at risk.''
   ``Although most organized opposition has ceased, it is not
possible at this time to predict the precise scope and duration of
the military operations or how long the temporary increases of U.S.
forces in Panama will be required,'' Bush said.
   In Panama City, thousands of U.S. troops were settling in to
restore order in the chaotic streets while in Washington, within
blocks of the White House, the Organization of American States'
political council voted 20-1 with six abstentions ``to deeply
regret the military intervention.''
   The United States cast the sole ``no'' vote. In a Spanish
translation, the resolution used the words ``deplorar
profundamente'' _ profoundly deplore. A resolution to ``condemn''
the invasion was never formally taken up.
   The Pentagon, revising its casualty report, said 20 American
troops and two female dependents were killed in the first two days
of battle, 202 were wounded and two were missing. American military
aircraft were bringing the bodies of the dead back to Dover Air
Force Base in Delaware, their coffins draped with American flags.
   U.S. officials said 122 Panamanian soldiers were killed and 45
wounded. Army Lt. Gen. Tom Kelly said U.S. troops had taken 1,500
prisoners, most of them regulars from the Panamanian Defense Force.
   ``This operation is not over, but it's pretty well wrapped up,''
Bush said Thursday at a news conference that coincided with return
of the first bodies. This morning's report to Congress, ``Our
additional forces will remain in Panama only so long as their
presence is required.''
   Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., called
on other Latin American states to recognize Panama's
newly-installed U.S.-backed president, Guillermo Endara. The OAS
group had not taken up the matter.
   Warner said it was time for ``the hand wringing and second
guessing to stop.''
   The senator in a television interview also said it would be
helpful if Panama's neighbors would ``begin to rally behind him and
perhaps even send in their own police ... so that President Bush
can withdraw our troops as soon as possible.''
   Endara acknowledged in an interview on ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' that he could not safely walk the streets of his country
today _ ``nobody is secure right now,'' he said _ but he claimed
that he was the country's legitimate leader.
   ``I have the wholehearted support of the people right now,''
Endara declared. He said Noriega's capture was ``not absolutely
necessary'' for an Endara government to establish roots.
   If Noriega is caught by Panamanian forces, Endara said, he could
not under Panama's constitution be extradited to the United States,
where he is under indictment on drug trafficking charges, ``so
therefore I'm not looking for him.''
   Following the OAS vote, U.S. representative John Masisto said,
``We're a little disappointed. It certainly wasn't an extreme
resolution but it's a little detached from what is really happening
in Panama.''

<HEAD>Court Document Says Oakland Housing Police Stole from Undercover

   Undercover investigators who went into
public housing projects posing as drug dealers were beaten and
robbed by housing authority police, according to a court document.
   The 396-page affidavit filed in a probe of the Oakland Housing
Authority's 19-member force gives graphic accounts of nine alleged
run-ins between investigators and housing police, including
allegations that officers brutally beat unarmed investigators and
pocketed more than $900 in cash. The document was unsealed Thursday.
   The probe of the Oakland Housing Authority and its chief,
William H. Smith, was begun three months ago by the Oakland Police
Department, Alameda County District Attorney's Office and the state
Department of Justice.
   Smith previously denied any wrongdoing and any knowledge of
alleged wrongdoing by his officers.
   His agency operates 3,300 units that house 11,000 people.
   Authorities began the undercover operation to investigate
allegations of misconduct by the housing police, including
beatings, sexual assault, theft, falsification of arrest reports
and extortion.
   The affidavit was filed in Alameda County Municipal Court when
authorities sought a search warrant. After the warrant was issued,
investigators raided housing authority offices Dec. 11.
   Housing police, some videotaped by undercover teams, also
planted drugs to bolster arrests, said the affidavit signed by
Oakland Police Officer Marc Burrell.
   The male and female undercover officers posing as drug dealers
carried large amounts of cash into the city housing projects but
carried no drugs, the document said.
   Authorities would not comment further on the status of the
investigation.

<TEXT>
   Nicolae Ceausescu, the president and
Communist Party leader of Romania, created a cult of personality
and ruled his country with an iron hand during 24 years in power.
   The 71-year-old Ceausescu's hold was so firm that he could carry
out a foreign policy independent of the Soviet Union and the other
East bloc countries. He also managed to outlast old-line leaders in
Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia.
   But the changes encouraged by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
also swept over Romania. After seven days of widespread
demonstrations and attempts by security forces to quell them by
force, Ceausescu was driven from power by a mass uprising.
   The old-style Marxist invested billions of dollars in a crash
industrialization program that led to widespread food and energy
shortages, and despair for Romania's 23 million people.
   The longer the food lines and the more vocal the people's
complaints, the more harshly the regime cracked down on critics.
   At a mass meeting in Bucharest earlier this year, Ceausescu
said, ``The triumph of the revolution requires unity, severe
discipline and a spirit of sacrifice. A firm organization is needed
as well as a tested political leader who knows how to unite and
lead the masses.''
   Ceausescu's ``firm organization'' was the Romanian Communist
Party which he turned into a personal instrument after taking over
in 1965.
   He gradually pushed aside all leaders who opposed his policies
and installed loyalists on the ruling 23-member Politburo,
including his wife, Elena, a chemist.
   The personality cult he encouraged, particularly after he was
sworn in as Romania's first president, took on the trappings of
worship and pervaded practically all aspects of public life. His
pictures lined the streets in Bucharest and other Romanian cities
and bookstores were full of works attributed to him.
   When he was elected president in March 1974, an official picture
showed him holding a silver scepter as the symbol of authority.
   During the Ceausescu era, Romania, once known as the breadbasket
of the Balkans, became one of Europe's poorest countries. Still,
the official media frequently described Ceausescu's long tenure as
Romania's ``Golden Epoch.''
   Billions of dollars were spent on industrial and public works
projects, and food was rationed as the government exported all it
could to pay off its foreign debts. The debt was eventually paid
off in the spring of 1989, but the shortages continued.
   A massive secret police kept strict control on religious and
political expression, and dissent was quickly crushed.
   As he grew older and turned more dogmatic, Ceausescu rejected
the need for reform adopted by other bloc allies, such as Poland
and Hungary.
   Romania became increasingly isolated in both East and West,
particularly after 30,000 Romanians, mostly ethnic Hungarians, fled
to Hungary last year.
   The Hungarians complained about alleged discrimination and
denial of their ethnic and cultural rights, but they also sought
refuge in Hungary to escape chronic hardships under Ceausescu.
   Ceausescu viewed the changes in Eastern Europe with alarm and
accused other Warsaw Pact countries of abandoning Communism.
   The United States and other Western powers originally encouraged
Ceausescu's relatively independent foreign policy stand within the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. Two U.S. presidents visited Bucharest,
Richard M. Nixon in 1969 and Gerald F. Ford in 1975.
   Ceausescu, who took power as Communist Party leader on March 22,
1965, maintained diplomatic relations with Israel even after other
Soviet bloc countries broke them during the 1967 Middle East War.
   In keeping with his maverick image, he denounced the Soviet-led
invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, refused to participate and
refused to allow any foreign troops in Romania.
   Romania was the only East bloc country to send athletes to the
1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, breaking the Soviet-led boycott.
   Ceausescu placed members of his family in key posts.
   His wife Elena was a Politburo member and first vice premier,
and by the mid-1980s she had become the virtual second-in-command
of national life and shared the limelight with her husband.
   Nicu, their youngest son, was regional party chief in central
Romania. Valentin, an adopted son, Zoia-Elena, their daughter, and
Ceausescu brothers held prestigious posts, as did several in-laws.
   Western analysts and knowledgeable Romanians estimate that some
40 members of his family held top jobs in the party and state
hierarchy.
   Born Jan. 26, 1918, in Scornicesti, Ceausescu was the third son
of a large peasant family. An elementary school dropout, he was
apprenticed as a shoemaker, took a job in a factory and joined the
illegal Communist Party youth organization at age 15. He became a
party member three years later, in 1936.
   Before and during World War II, his Communist activities landed
him in jail several times. He became a protege of Communist leader
Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, rose quickly in the party, and succeeded
his mentor after his death.
   The party under Gheorghiu-Dej had grown accustomed to one-man
traditional Stalinist rule, and Ceausescu continued the tradition,
moving trusted associates into key posts.
   ``I don't give orders,'' he once quipped to visiting U.S.
Secretary of State William Rogers. ``I make suggestions. But they
had better be carried out.''

<HEAD>World Not Just Black and White To Dogs, Study Concludes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world isn't all black and white
for man's best friend, but pooches are better at spotting Blue and
Big Red than Old Yeller, a research study concluded.
   Three dogs named Flip, Gypsy and Retina helped scientists at the
University of California, Santa Barbara, dispel the belief that
dogs live a colorless life, according to a study published in
January's Scientific American and in the journal Visual
Neuroscience.
   The yearlong study found that dogs do distinguish colors, but it
also showed the animals have limited color vision, similar to men
who suffer from a type of colorblindness once known as ``green
blindness.''
   The dogs could not distinguish yellow, green, orange and some
other shades, the study said.
   Psychologists Jay Neitz and Gerald H. Jacobs and technician
Timothy Geist used greyhounds Flip and Gypsy and toy poodle Retina
in the studies exploring photopigments, the molecules in the eye's
receptor cells that help differentiate colors.
   The researchers trained the dogs to respond to colored lights on
a display panel, the study said.
   In each test, two lights would be of the same color, while a
third would be different. The dogs were trained to push the
different light with their noses, and they got a snack if they
pushed the correct one.
   The dogs had no trouble distinguishing red and blue _ the colors
at the opposite end of the spectrum. They could even tell more
subtle differences in the similar hues of blue and violet.
   But the dogs ``could not discriminate among colors from
greenish-yellow through orange to red,'' the account in Scientific
American said.
   The study was partly funded by the National Eye Institute.
   Jacobs, interviewed by telephone Thursday, said the research
team was careful to make sure the dogs weren't simply
distinguishing between shades of gray.
   ``We went to elaborate lengths to make sure they could not go on
brightness cues,'' he said.
   Besides disproving the popular notion that dogs see in black and
white, the study gives insight into the eye's mechanisms for
differentiating color, he said.

<HEAD>New Test Allows Determination of Sex of Fetus from Blood Sample</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sensitive new genetic test has enabled
researchers to determine the sex of 19 fetuses merely by taking
blood from their mothers' arms, says a new report.
   The technique might one day be used to diagnose birth defects
before birth, replacing present methods in which cells must be
obtained from the uterus, researchers said.
   The test, called the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, was used
to search for Y chromosomes in the blood of the 19 mothers. Females
do not have Y chromosomes.
   The researchers were hoping that enough fetal cells had leaked
into the mothers' bloodstreams that the Y chromosomes from male
fetuses could be detected.
   They detected the Y chromosomes in seven of the mothers, and
predicted that those women were carrying males. All seven delivered
boys. All of the 12 women in whom Y chromosomes were not found
delivered girls.
   ``With stringent precautions against contamination, this
technique may assist prenatal diagnosis of sex-linked disorders,''
said the researchers, led by Dr. Kenneth Fleming of John Radcliffe
Hospital in Oxford, England. The researchers reported their results
in the Dec. 9 issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal.
   In May, Dr. Diana Bianchi of Boston Children's Hospital used a
different technique for analyzing mothers' blood samples and
correctly predicted the sex of two out of three male fetuses.
   Other studies had raised the possibility that fetal cells could
be found in mothers' blood, but no one had proven that fetal cells
could be reliably distinguished from the mothers' cells.
   The sex of a fetus can now be determined as early as the eighth
week of pregnancy through a technique called chorionic villus
sampling, or CVS, in which cells from the precursor of the placenta
are removed and tested.
   CVS allows the testing of cells for any of the genetic
abnormalities for which tests exist, including such disorders as
Down's syndrome, Huntington's disease and sickle cell anemia.
   The hope is that mothers' blood can one day be used for the
detection of these other genetic abnormalities, because getting a
blood sample is simpler and safer than CVS or the standard sampling
method, amniocentesis.
   In that procedure, a small amount of the amniotic fluid that
bathes the fetus is withdrawn about the 16th week of pregnancy.
Genetic testing is done on fetal cells that have escaped into the
fluid.

   U.S. troops in helicopters rescued 11 people
associated with the Smithsonian Institution early today, removing
them from a remote schoolhouse two days after they were abducted by
Panamanian troops.
   ``At 8:45 a.m., the Department of Defense notified the
Smithsonian that all 11 people from the Smithsonian Tropical
Research Institute in Panama were safe at Clayton Air Force
Base...,'' the Smithsonian said in a statement.
   The group, which had been working on the San Blas islands in the
Caribbean, were forced by Panamian troops to go to the mainland on
Wednesday, shortly after the U.S. invasion.
   They were reported to be free on Thursday, but they remained at
an isolated area on the mainland until their rescue by American
troops.
   ``Early accounts indicate that the group was picked up at a
remote schoolhouse between the towns of Carti and El Llano and
transported by U.S. military helicopters,'' the Smithsonian said.
   Before their rescue, members of the group had access to a radio
that enabled them to contact Smithsonian employees in Panama City,
according to Madeleine Jacobs, a Smithsonian employee.
   The group _ five Americans, five Panamanians and one Venezuelan
_ performed marine research on the coral reef.
   The Americans were identified as Dr. Nancy Knowlton, a
Smithsonian biologist; her daughter, Rebecca, 4; Preston Hardison,
a graduate student at the University of Washington; Steve Travers,
research assistant at the research institute, and Greg Summers, a
student at the University of Washington.
   Robert McC. Adams, secretary of the Smithsonian, praised
government officials for their help. ``We are extremely grateful
for all the assistance we have received ...,'' he said.
   Besides its station at San Blas and the headquarters at Panama
City, the tropical institute has several other stations throughout
the isthmus. About 200 people, including 140 tropical institute
employees and 60 visiting scientists and research fellows, work at
the institute.
   The Americans make up 34 employees.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Acting President Matyas Szueros
announced today that the country's first competitive elections in
41 years will be held on March 25, the state MTI news agency
reported.
   On Thursday, Parliament approved a motion to dissolve itself on
March 16 to pave the way for the first multiparty elections since
1948.
   Hungary will become the first Soviet bloc country to hold free
elections resulting from the reform movement sweeping Eastern
Europe.
   A non-Communist government took power in Poland in August after
opposition candidates won all the seats they were allowed to
contest, then formed an alliance that forced the Communists to give
them control of the Cabinet.
   Free elections are expected next year in three other Soviet bloc
countries.
   East Germany has scheduled elections for May 6, and Bulgaria and
Czechoslovakia have announced plans for free elections before the
end of June.
   In contrast to East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, where
popular revolts swiftly forced hard-line Communist leaders from
power, Hungary's evolution to democracy has been gradual.
   Legislation was passed in Parliament in October to set the legal
groundwork for the free elections, and the Communist Party
disbanded, reconstituting itself as the Hungarian Socialist Party
and aspiring to democratic ideals.

   A record-breaking cold snap caused power outages today in at
least three states, posed perils for the citrus industry and
threatened the lives of the homeless and impoverished elderly from
the Rockies to the East Coast.
   Thursday night, the longest of the year, was ``one not fit for
man or beast,'' said Hugh Crowther of the National Weather Service
in Kansas City.
   Temperatures sank even lower today _ the first full day of
winter _ following a day that saw wind chill readings of 89 degrees
below zero at Dickinson, N.D., the mercury steady at 40 below at
noon in Havre, Mont., and temperatures about zero as far south as
Tennessee and Alabama.
   Record lows set this morning included 29 below at Rapid City,
S.D., 13 below at Syracuse, N.Y., and 3 below in Memphis, Tenn.
   Light snow was falling in Houston this morning for the first
time since January 1985.
   Thousands were without power today in Texas, West Virginia and
Ohio.
   The weather service was predicting bone-chilling weather at
least until Sunday.
   As for a white Christmas, ``We've got it already,'' said John
Hart of the weather service in West Virginia, where wind-chill
readings reached 40 below early today and the snow was squeaky dry
underfoot. ``It's certainly not going anywhere.''
   Storm systems had dumped up to 1{ feet of snow early today
across the Great Lakes from Indiana to upstate New York. The cold
was forcing homeless into packed shelters and was blamed for more
than 50 deaths.
   Oil companies said Thursday that the cold had drained heating
oil supplies, causing temporary shortages in some areas of the
Northeast and driving up prices. Exxon USA, Mobil Corp. and Star
Enterprise, a Texaco Inc. affiliate, reported temporary oil
depletions at their terminals.
   Utilities in several states reported record demands for power.
Most of the power outages reported were caused by system overloads
from the increased demand or cold-related equipment failure.
   In Texas, an estimated 12,500 homes were without electricity in
the Fort Worth area early today because of such demand, and a TU
Electric spokesman predicted it would take several hours to restore
power. The temperature dropped to 5 and the wind chill index was
minus 26 at the time of the outage.
   About 10,000 customers in Kentucky, 2,300 in several Ohio
counties and about 500 in the Charleston, W.Va., area lost power at
least temporarily, utilities spokesmen said.
   Potomac Electric Power Co., which serves the District of
Columbia and the Maryland suburbs, cut voltage by 5 percent this
morning due to extremely heavy demand, said spokesman Tom Welle.
   Natural gas and electricity delivery problems were reported in
Missouri and Texas.
   The National Weather Service predicted a possible repeat of the
killer freeze of December 1983, which destroyed the citrus crop in
the Rio Grande Valley and parts of Louisiana.
   If the predicted freeze today through Sunday is as bad as 1983,
citrus growers ``will suffer the same consequences _ go broke,''
said Jerry Walzel of the Texas Citrus and Vegetable Association.
   ``When it gets down below 20, (citrus trees) just explode _
they're evergreen trees and are full of water, and they split,''
Walzel said. ``You can actually hear it _ it sounds like a .30-.30
rifle cracking.''
   About a third of the $30 million crop was picked, and the
weather service urged farmers to pick as much as they could
Thursday.
   The cold front brought snow early today to the mountains of
northern Georgia, and record lows Thursday of 12 below in Kansas
City and 22 below in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., where an 18-foot deep
wall of brash _ broken ice left by passing ships _ mired the
Canadian freighter Travailleur in the St. Marys River.
   On a day where the mercury rarely reached zero, those
unfortunate enough to be working outside had to devise tricks to
save extremities from frostbite.
   ``We rotate,'' said Rick Kiolbasa, an assistant manager for
Cablevision In Lincoln, Neb., where the cold knocked out service to
20,000 households. ``There are three guys in the truck. One guy
goes out for five minutes, gets cold, and then the next guy goes
out.''
   Bad as it was to work outside, it was worse to be living there.
   In New York City, where an estimated 80,000 people live on the
streets, 9,140 people were in the city's shelters Thursday morning,
up 1,200 over last year at this time, officials said.
   At least 15 weather-related deaths have been reported in Chicago
since the cold snap began, according to the Cook County Coroner's
office.
   Some homeless were itching for a fight so they could be jailed
through the worst of the cold.
   ``It's pretty typical this time of year for homeless and needy
people to act intentionally _ or unintentionally _ so they can be
locked up,'' said Dale Davis, executive director of the Michigan
Sheriff's Association.
   But Michigan jails are too crowded for inmates who aren't
dangerous, Davis said, so most of the idlers are held only briefly.
``If we can get them shelter elsewhere, we will,'' he said.
   The Christmas holiday came early in Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri,
North Dakota, New York, Iowa and Minnesota, where schools were
closed Thursday by officials worried at the thought of youngsters
waiting for buses that might break down in the cold.
   In Farmington, Maine, hundreds of townsfolk _ most wearing
earmuffs _ turned out to celebrate Chester Greenwood Day, in honor
of the man said to have created the muffs in 1873.

   Word that the Salvation Army in this
economically troubled city would be closed for the rest of the
holiday season for lack of funds brought a flood of donations,
allowing the office to reopen, an official said today.
   ``The outpouring of the public has been marvelous,'' Maj. Robert
Pfeiffer, who runs the office, said this morning. Pfeiffer said
several thousand dollars was donated by corporations and
individuals after word of the closing went out.
   ``We are not turning anyone away,'' Pfeiffer said. ``The
Salvation Army is alive and well in New Bedford.''
   Pfeiffer announced Thursday that the office would close
indefinitely, saying a sharp increase in the number of people
seeking assistance was to blame.When the doors were closed at 2
p.m., there were still about 100 people waiting for help, he said.
   ``We've gone into using the canned food we had put aside for
January and February,'' Pfeiffer said Thursday.
   Pfeiffer blamed unemployment for bringing 1,600 families to the
office in the past year _ 300 more than last year. There have been
about 1,000 layoffs in the area in the last month, he said.
   The Salvation Army is a national religious and charitable
organization that is organized along military lines.

<TEXT>
   Manuel Antonio Noriega's longstanding
relationship with the CIA could pose problems for federal
prosecutors if the deposed Panamanian strongman is caught and
brought to trial on U.S. drug trafficking charges, government
sources say.
   Federal prosecutors expect Noriega would try to force the
government to drop charges against him by seeking court disclosure
of classified information that he was an informant for the spy
agency, these officials added.
   Such an approach would mirror the legal defense strategy used by
Oliver North and others with some success in the Iran-Contra
affair, in which independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh was forced
to drop some key charges when the government refused to allow
disclosure of secrets in open court.
   At the same time, Justice Department officials said Thursday
they do not expect the secrecy problems in Noriega's case to
scuttle any of the charges that the Panamanian helped Colombian
drug lords smuggle cocaine and marijuana through Panama to this
country.
   Noriega was indicted in 1988 by grand juries in Miami and Tampa,
Fla.
   Prosecutors are anticipating that Noriega will claim that his
alleged drug activities were sanctioned by the U.S. government
because he was a CIA informant.
   But the government is prepared to offer evidence that none of
the drug-trafficking activity was approved by the U.S. government,
said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Prosecutors
will argue that just because Noriega may have been an informant for
the CIA or the Drug Enforcement Administration he is not immune
from criminal prosecution, the source said.
   The secrecy issues involving Noriega's case were among the items
discussed at a meeting about the case Dec. 15 attended by
prosecutors, top officials of the Justice Department's criminal
division and other law enforcement agents, said spokesman David
Runkel.
   Officials decided at that meeting to try Noriega first on
charges filed in Miami that he took a $4.6 million bribe from
Colombia's Medellin cartel to protect cocaine-smuggling and
money-laundering operations in Panama.
   Runkel said last week's meeting had been scheduled for several
weeks and was not convened in anticipation of the U.S. invasion of
Panama.
   The secrecy problems in Noriega's case were termed
``manageable'' by one official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. But the official quickly conceded that Iran-Contra
prosecutors probably thought the same thing about their case
against former White House aide North.
   Walsh was forced to drop major charges that North conspired to
divert U.S.-Iran arms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels,
because the government wouldn't release information deemed relevant
to the defense. The Classified Information Procedures Act empowers
judges to dismiss criminal charges if the government refuses to
allow the disclosure of secrets needed for a trial.
   North was convicted of charges that he tried to cover up his
involvement in the Iran-Contra affair. But all Iran-Contra charges
against a former CIA agent, Joseph Fernandez, were dismissed
recently when the Bush administration blocked disclosure of
classified information.
   In Noriega's case, ``there is certainly going to be a CIPA
problem,'' said Victoria Toensing, a former senior Justice
Department official who now practices law in Washington.
   ``When people are saying he was on the CIA payroll, then you are
going to have the more complicated level that some of these things
regarding sources and methods are classified,'' she said.
   Before Noriega was indicted in 1988, prosecutors consulted with
the CIA and other intelligence agencies, said a government source,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The agencies posed no
objections to proceeding with the case, the source said.
   Between the Miami and Tampa cases, Noriega is charged with
pocketing some $10 million in bribes and commissions for protecting
money-laundering and smuggling operations in Panama.
   Runkel said the Justice Department decided that Noriega would be
tried first on the charges in Miami because prosecutors there have
a stronger case.
   If convicted of all the charges against him, Noriega faces a
possible sentence of 145 years in prison and more than $1.1 million
in fines.

<TEXT>
   A former police official accused of defrauding
investors and of stealing from the department was ordered jailed to
keep him from fleeing before his next court appearance.
   Kenneth Weiner, former deputy chief of the Detroit Police
Department, was arrested early Thursday at Detroit Metropolitan
Airport.
   He was carrying dozens of charge cards, airline flight coupons,
a passport and $3,100 in Canadian money, FBI agents testified at
Weiner's U.S. District Court bond hearing.
   Magistrate Virginia M. Morgan sent Weiner, 43, to jail without
bond on a federal fraud charge until his pretrial hearing Jan. 2.
The charge, which carries a possible sentence of five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine, stems from his alleged involvement in a
scheme to defraud investors of $20 million.
   Morgan said Weiner has an ability to manipulate the system, to
appear or disappear whenever it was in his interest to do so.
   Weiner's attorney, Robert Harrison, said an appeal will be filed
immediately but acknowledged Weiner likely will be held until after
Christmas.
   `He's very unhappy right now, obviously,'' Harrison said outside
the courtroom. ``He feels the truth did not come out.''
   Harrison said the flood of media reports on the mystery of
Weiner's whereabouts in the past few weeks tainted the case, making
Weiner appear evasive.
   ``He's a man who travels in his own name all over the country,''
Harrison said.
   He said Weiner was flying to Detroit from Los Angeles to meet
with his attorneys regarding an Internal Revenue Service
investigation.
   Police Chief William Hart recently accused Weiner of stealing
from a $1.4 million Detroit police secret service fund used for
undercover operations. Weiner had access to the fund from 1980 to
1986.
   FBI Agent Thomas Cannistra, who has been investigating Weiner
since May 1986, testified Thursday that Weiner sent $1.3 million
from the secret service fund to dummy corporations in California.
   Federal investigators have said that two of the corporations
named by Cannistra paid a $3,000 monthly rent bill for a house in
Beverly Hills, Calif., occupied for two years by Hart's daughter
and son-in-law. Hart has denied knowing about the rent payments.
   Cannistra said the fraud charge is unrelated to the police
investigation but is from a pyramid investment scheme involving the
sale of gold and silver. He said between $5 million and $10 million
remains missing from the scheme.
   Weiner's court troubles began in 1986 when Caine Steel Co. of
Detroit filed a civil suit against him, charging that he defrauded
the company of $379,000. He was accused of duping as many as 90
investors out of about $20 million in a scheme that involved
trading of gold and silver.
   The alleged investment scheme used new investors' cash to
provide large returns to previous investors. Such plans collapse
when new investors can't be found.

   Four Navy SEAL members whose bodies were the
first to return home from Panama died while capturing an airfield,
Pentagon officials said.
   The men were part of an assault against an airfield used by
ousted Panamanian dictator Gen. Manuel Noriega, said Lt. Gen. Tom
Kelly, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. U.S.
intelligence had feared Noriega would use the field to flee the
country, but he did not, Kelly said Thursday.
   Atlantic Fleet officials in Norfolk identified the four Sea, Air
and Land commandos as Lt. j.g. John Patrick Connors, 25, of
Arlington, Mass.; chief engineman Donald Lewis McFaul, 22, of San
Diego, Calif.; boatswain mate Christopher Tilghman, 20, Kailua,
Hawaii; and torpedoman Issac George Rodriguez III, 24, of Missouri
City, Texas. Their bodies were flown Thursday from Panama to Dover
Air Force Base in Delaware.
   The team was part of the Naval Special Warfare Group Two based
at the Little Creek Amphibious Base in Virginia Beach.
   ``He was a fine fellow; he was doing exactly what he wanted
to,'' said Tilghman's father, Taylor Tilghman.
   Tilghman enlisted in the Navy after he graduated from the
Kalaheo High School in Kailua, Hawaii, in 1979.
   ``He was following in my footsteps. He joined right after high
school,'' his father said in a telephone interview from his home in
Kailua. Taylor Tilghman was in the Navy for 15 years and the Coast
Guard for another 15.
   Paul Bennett, former executive officer of Connors' college
military training program, said Connors ``was a quiet kid, not the
kind of kid who walks around with `Soldier of Fortune' in his back
pocket. But he loved his country, and had a strong sense of value
and freedom.''
   Connors was a graduate of Worcester Polytechnical Institute, in
Worcester, Mass., which he attended on Naval ROTC scholarship.
   The SEAL teams are trained to undertake intelligence, hostage
rescue, and other operations needing a small, nearly invisible
force to succeed. Their training includes underwater demolition,
courses at the U.S. Army's Special Forces and Ranger schools, and
electronics and communications courses.
   Organized in 1962, the SEALs were used extensively in the Mekong
Delta area of Vietnam for anti-guerrilla warfare and secret
intelligence gathering operations during the Vietnam War. In 1965
and again in 1984, SEAL teams led the way for the invasions of the
Dominican Republic and Grenada.
   During the Reagan administration, a special unit was formed
within the SEALs that was believed to have been trained in hostage
rescue and covert intelligence gathering. The team reportedly was
put ashore by submarine in Libya in 1987, where team members
sabotaged communications and gathered information on coastal
defense.
   The Navy has two SEAL teams, one in California and the other at
Little Creek, with about 2,000 men in all.

<HEAD>Bradley May Have Broken Campaign Limit Law, Paper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Tom Bradley may have broken the law in
his method of reporting tens of thousands of dollars in campaign
funds from a series of inner-city carnivals, it was reported today.
   The fund raisers apparently were held on city-owned land without
permission, the Los Angeles Times reported in today's editions.
   Bradley's campaign accountant has said the mayor told him to
list the money on disclosure statements as anonymous donations of
$100 or less, the report said.
   The City Charter prohibits anonymous contributions totaling more
than $200 for any one campaign. Any surplus must go to the city
treasury, Assistant City Attorney Anthony Alperin said.
   Bradley said in a statement Thursday that he would ``take
whatever steps are necessary to correct any mistakes, if any were
made.''
   ``I relied on the campaign attorneys and accountants to decide
how the carnival contributions should be reported,'' said the
mayor, whose financial dealings have come under city and federal
scrutiny.
   The carnivals were held in 1987 and 1988, as Bradley was gearing
up for a campaign fight against City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky.
During that period, the mayor's re-election campaign received
$164,000 in anonymous and unattributed donations of under $100 _ an
unusually large figure, campaign experts told the Times.
   The amount of smaller contributions dropped sharply after
Yaroslavsky dropped out of the race, the Times said.
   The paper said it obtained copies of $20,000 in money orders
payable to Bradley's re-lection campaign by one of two firms used
for at least 11 carnivals. Bradley's campaign did not receive
permission to hold two of the fund raisers on city land, several
unidentified officials told the paper.

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of jubilant Berliners surged
through new openings in the Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate
today for the first time in 28 years.
   The celebrants braved an intermittent rain as they filled the
square in front of the towering symbol of the postwar division of
Germany that is becoming a monument to the rapprochement of East
Germany and West Germany.
   East German Premier Hans Modrow met West Germany Chancellor
Helmut Kohl at the border for the 3 p.m. (9 a.m. EST) ceremony,
then they walked together into East Germany. They were nearly
mobbed by the crowd as they walked to a platform in front of the
gate to address the exulting Berliners.
   Kohl called the occasion ``a fantastic thing.''
   Thousands drenched by the rain uncorked champagne and danced
atop the Berlin Wall, the once impregnable concrete barrier that is
quickly crumbling.
   The opening was televised live in both countries. ``This is
where the heart of Berlin pounds,'' said a commentator for West
Germany's ZDF network.
   Two banners were unfurled near the new crossings to protest the
killings of demonstrators in Romania.
   ``The last time I was here was as a kid when I used to play on
this very spot. I never thought I'd come here again, it's really
wonderful,'' said Peter Rebachmann, 42, of East Berlin.
   ``What a beautiful Christmas present. I am so elated that I can
experience this,'' said a middle-aged woman.
   The crowd cheered and set off firecrackers when East German
workers started dismantling the wall Thursday night. The workers
used a crane to remove the rounded top of the wall.
   ``This is an experience that will go down in history. The gate
was a symbol of division of Germany,'' said Jozef Polak, a West
Berlin mechanic.
   More than 10,000 people had jammed the western side for the two
sections of the wall to fall down. Some climbed on trees to get a
better view. More people kept arriving throughout the night.
   A loud cheer sounded through the night air as the East German
crane lifted a 3{-foot-wide segment of the concrete to make the
first hole in that part of the wall shortly after midnight.
   The two new crossing points are 15 feet wide each. One is for
Westerners going into East Berlin, the other for East Germans going
to West Berlin.
   Although more than 20 border crossings have been made at the
wall since East Germany opened its borders to the West on Nov. 9,
the Brandenburg Gate has the most symbolic meaning for Berliners.
   The 200-year-old gate, Berlin's most famous landmark, remained
on the eastern side when East Germany's Communist authorities built
the Berlin Wall in 1961.
   Graffiti on the western side at one of the segments to be
removed said, ``One day every wall must fall down.''
   Friedhelm Brinkman, a salesman from Dortmund, West Germany, said
he drove 360 miles to see the event.
   ``This was the central place in Berlin where everything happened
(before the war). I always thought this place would be opened again
and that's why I came tonight,'' he said late Thursday.
   Some people in the crowd shouted, ``Germany, United
Fatherland,'' _ the rallying call of East German supporters of
German unification.
   
   The crowd was kept well away from the wall by barricades and
cordons of West Berlin police to prevent them from possibly trying
to cross the wall.
   After East Germany's dramatic opening of the borders, thousands
of people danced on the section of the Berlin Wall at Brandenburg
Gate.
   Crowds pulled down one segment of the wall in unforgettable
scenes seen on television worldwide. Thousands of people had waited
in vain for the gate to be opened in the first few days after the
Berlin Wall started crumbling down in the wake of East Germany's
peaceful revolution.
   Kohl and Modrow announced the agreement to open the two
crossings when Kohl visited Dresden on Wednesday.
   The gate, the size of a five-story building on top of which is a
bronze chariot with the goddess Victoria, was the backdrop for
Hitler's rise to power and his last stand. It was also where East
German workers began a 1953 uprising that was crushed by Soviet
tanks.
   In East Berlin, the famous Unter den Linden boulevard ends at
the gate. On the Western side, the sprawling avenue that leads to
the gate was renamed June 17 Street, after the date of the uprising.
   Nazi brown shirts staged a triumphant torch parade through the
gate when Adolf Hitler was named chancellor on Jan. 30, 1933.
   In the final days of World War II, the six-column sandstone gate
was heavily damaged as Soviet tanks closed in on Hitler's bunker in
the chancellory. It marked the border between the Soviet and
British sectors when the victorious allies divided conquered Berlin
into four sectors.

<TEXT>
   Threatening follow-up letters have been sent to
at least two of the four targets of mail bombs that killed a
federal judge and a lawyer, investigators said.
   In revealing the existence of the letters Thursday,
investigators said they may have been sent by those responsible for
the bombings, which are believed to be linked to civil rights cases
in the South.
   Officials refused to reveal where the two letters were sent or
their contents.
   The four targets of the bombs were federal Judge Robert S.
Vance; his court, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta; Savannah attorney Robert Robinson; and the Jacksonville,
Fla., NAACP.
   Vance was killed in his suburban Birmingham, Ala., home Saturday
when a nail-studded bomb exploded; Robinson was killed in his
office by a bomb Monday. The packages sent to the court and the
NAACP office were defused safely.
   Vance's wife, Helen, was in serious but stable condition today
with injuries received in the bombing.
   ``There have been follow-up letters sent since receipt of the
bomb parcels,'' said Leo Shatzel, postal inspector in charge in
Atlanta. ``It appears they may have been sent by the individual who
sent the parcels.
   ``They were threatening additional mailings to other
individuals.''
   Asked if the letters specifically threatened further bombings,
he said, ``No.''
   None of the letters specifically claim responsibility for the
bombings on behalf of a person or group, said William Hinshaw,
chief of the FBI's Atlanta office; nor do they describe ``to a T''
the details of the four mail bombs, which would lead investigators
to believe the follow-up letters were sent by the bomber.
   ll four packages have been linked to civil rights cases: Vance
and other 11th Circuit judges have handled school desegregation and
other civil rights cases from Georgia, Alabama and Florida; the
Jacksonville NAACP recently won a school desegregation case in the
Atlanta court; and Robinson had represented the Savannah NAACP in a
school desegregation case.
   The Atlanta Constitution reported today that the FBI is
investigating threatening letters mailed to at least 13
broadcasting stations nationwide last summer, which could be
related to the bombings.
   One of letters was mailed to WAPT, an ABC affiliate in Jackson,
Miss. Vickie Taylor, news assignment editor at the station, said
today that the letter, postmarked Atlanta, was received Aug. 24. It
used the term ``declaration of war'' and threatened poison gas
attacks in densely populated areas because of unspecificed
``biased'' rulings by federal appeals courts, she said.
   In Alabama, there were bomb scares at two court buildings
Thursday, but nothing was found.
   One was at the Birmingham court of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Clifford Fulford of Birmingham, who gave the eulogy at Vance's
funeral Wednesday.
   In Decatur, Ala., a suspicious package was found outside the
building which houses the post office and bankruptcy court. It was
detonated, but found to contain only clothing, said Decatur police
Sgt. Johnny Coker.
   In Savannah, Robinson's family scheduled his funeral for
Saturday.
   Security will be tight, said Savannah Police Capt. Dan Reynolds,
adding that police have been told to expect NAACP Executive
Director Benjamin Hooks.
   An FBI behavioral psychologist with experience in serial killing
cases has joined the investigation of the bombings, said bureau
spokesman Tom Moore.
   The psychologist, FBI agent William Hagmaier, has gone to
Birmingham to help develop a profile of the person who sent the
package to Vance, Moore said.
   Hagmaier interviewed mass killer Theodore Bundy before Bundy's
execution and worked on the ``Night Stalker'' case in California,
in which Richard Ramirez was convicted of a string of grisly
slayings.

   Financial records found in Manuel Antonio
Noriega's offices may help investigators trace money the deposed
Panamanian leader earned from drug trafficking, the Justice
Department said today.
   Department spokesman David Runkel said U.S. investigators are
reviewing the records seized in Noriega's offices at the Panamanian
Defense Forces headquarters.
   ``We believe there are assets and we are checking records to
determine where those assets are currently located,'' Runkel said.
   ``We have been in contact with foreign governments and financial
institutions as well as people here'' to trace the cash and other
holdings that Noriega is believed to have amassed from his
involvement in drug trafficking, Runkel said.
   Runkel said he had no information to specifically identify any
assets either in this country or abroad.
   But the spokesman said two foreign governments, which he would
not name, are currently assisting the Justice Department's efforts
to trace and freeze Noriega's holdings.
   The Treasury Department also was participating in the effort to
trace the assets, Runkel said.
   The records seized during the U.S. invasion might contain
evidence that Noriega looted the Panamanian treasury too, he said.
The records will be studied in Panama by officials of the new
Panamanian government installed after the U.S. invasion, he said.
   If useful, the records would be turned over to federal
prosecutors in Miami and Tampa, Fla., where Noriega faces drug
trafficking charges. He is accused of pocketing $10 million by
allowing Colombian drug lords to smuggle cocaine and marijuana
through Panama to the United States.
   The search for Noriega's assets was stepped up as the White
House announced that U.S. troops in Panama had found about 110
pounds of cocaine worth $1.25 million in the Panama City building
where Noriega had an office.
   The cocaine was found during a ``floor-by-floor'' search of the
building at Fort Amador, said White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.

   If Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega manages to make his way to a
foreign embassy in Panama City, he could be there a long time.
   U.S. troops have put the Nicaraguan and Cuban embassies in the
Panamanian capital under tight surveillance in case the ousted
leader attempts to seek sanctuary there. So far, U.S. officials
say, there is no sign Noriega is inside either embassy.
   Under international law, embassies are sacrosanct ground. An
embassy's territory belongs to the country it represents, not to
the country where it is situated. Forces from the outside cannot
legally enter embassy territory to seize a person the embassy wants
to shelter.
   But an embassy's right to grant sanctuary to someone does not
mean that person has a right to free passage out of the country. A
refugee may have to wait inside the embassy for years until
political conditions permit his departure.
   In June, Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi took refuge inside the
U.S. Embassy in Beijing. Although talks since then between U.S. and
Chinese officials have reportedly touched on Fang's case, he
remains holed up in the embassy, liable to arrest if he comes out.
   Perhaps the longest instance of political refuge in an embassy
involved Hungarian Cardinal Josef Mindszenty, who hid out for 15
years at the U.S. Embassy in Budapest. He was arrested by Hungary's
Communist rulers in 1948 as an enemy of communism and sentenced to
life in prison.
   Hungarian revolutionaries freed him during the 1956 uprising,
but Mindszenty took refuge in the U.S. mission in Budapest after
Warsaw Pact forces crushed the revolt. He lived there until the
Vatican arranged for his release to the West in 1971.
   Elsewhere in the East Bloc, seven Pentecostalists claiming
religious persecution lived for five years in a cramped room at the
U.S. Embassy in Moscow, leaving in 1983.
   The largest number of people to seek refuge at a foreign embassy
at once may have been in Cuba in April 1980, when 10,000 Cubans
entered the grounds of the Peruvian Embassy seeking to emigrate.
Cuban authorities finally persuaded the crowd to go home, and
eventually almost all of them received exit visas.
   In 1973, after Salvador Allende was overthrown as president of
Chile and died in a battle in the presidential palace, his widow
and her children received refuge in the Mexican Embassy in
Santiago. The Mexican government then flew them out of the country.
   In South Africa, some 20 prisoners and anti-apartheid activists
have taken refuge in the U.S., British, West German and Dutch
diplomatic missions in recent years. Most were eventually allowed
to go free, with South African government assurances that they
would not be punished.

   Federal health officials have a grim holiday
message for the nation: 1,770 Americans are going to die in highway
crashes in the next 11 days, half in wrecks where somebody was
drinking.
   Alcohol-related highway deaths seem to be declining slightly,
the national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday. But
statistics show a higher rate of highway deaths _ and a higher rate
of drunken-driving wrecks _ during the year-end holiday period.
   ``This is not to say don't travel,'' said Dr. Terence L. Chorba,
a CDC researcher. ``This is to say don't travel drunk, particularly
if you're the one behind the wheel.''
   The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration projects
that 1,770 highway deaths and 48,000 injuries will occur on the
roads over the Hanukkah-Christmas-New Year's holiday travel season,
which began Thursday and extends to Jan. 2.
   Statisticians at the National Safety Council in Chicago came up
with a lower projection of as many as 770 lives deaths over the
long Christmas and New Year's weekends. The estimate was based on
data compiled during the holidays in previous years, seasonal
weather factors and national driving safety trends.
   The worst day of the season is expected to be Saturday, when the
highway administration predicts 235 traffic deaths. Friday is
second, with 197, followed by Sunday _ Christmas Eve _ with 176 and
New Year's Day with 165.
   ``Over the holidays we see more ... miles traveled, and you have
an increase in the number of fatalities _ but you also have an
increase in the number involving drunk driving,'' Chorba said.
   Last year, 50 percent of the deaths on Christmas involved
drunken driving, compared to 39 percent on non-holiday days. For
the day of New Year's Eve, it was 36 percent, but for New Year's
Day, including the hours after midnight, it was 58 percent.
   In 1988 overall, 47,093 deaths were reported in U.S.
motor-vehicle crashes; 18,503, or 39 percent, involved drunken
driving _ someone with a blood-alcohol count of 0.10 or more,
legally drunk in most states.
   That percentage is down somewhat from 1987, when 18,529 drunken
driving crashes were reported, 40 percent of the 46,386 traffic
deaths. The figure was 46 percent in 1982.
   Chorba noted, however, that fully half of the fatal crashes
still involve someone who has been drinking, even if the person is
not legally drunk.
   ``Fifty percent of the fatalities on the roads have some alcohol
component to them, whether it's a driver or a bicyclist or a
pedestrian,'' he said.

   Actor Daniel Day-Lewis says that confining
himself to a wheelchair for the six weeks of filming ``My Left
Foot'' was necessary in portraying disabled Irish artist Christy
Brown.
   ``I took the liberty of thinking that it was imperative to do it
this way and did not think about any inconvenience I might have
caused because, in the end, it was beneficial to show the people on
the set what we were trying to do,'' he said.
   Day-Lewis remained in the wheelchair even during breaks,
communicating only with grunts and requiring aides to feed and
carry him.
   Brown, who died in 1981, was written off by doctors as a mental
defective but later rose to prominence as a writer and painter. The
cerebral palsy victim used his left foot, his only controllable
limb.
   In researching Brown's life, Day-Lewis said he learned that
Brown never considered himself handicapped and wanted desperately
to be considered normal.
   ``He has unwillingly become a spokesman for the disabled,''
Day-Lewis said, ``and he probably is the worst person in the world
to be a spokesman. He ... had an overwhelming sense of his own
disabilities. I don't think he ever came to terms with it.''

   Two men face life in prison for
fatally beating a 25-year-old man during an arugument that began
over the victim playing his radio too loud.
   Alex Abdalla Sr., 47, and Juan Rosado, 19, must serve at least
30 years before they can be eligible for parole.
   During sentencing Thursday, Superior Court Judge Barnett Hoffman
said the pair acted like ``a bunch of jackals attacking a
carcass.'' Hoffman said they beat and kicked Mario Santos, 25,
although he lay unconscious on the ground.
   Abdalla and Rosado were convicted Oct. 6 of beating Santos in
the parking lot of a New Brunswick housing complex during a dispute
that began when Abdalla told Santos to turn down the volume of
radio, said Middlesex County Assistant Prosecutor William Fetky.
   The two men argued and Santos was hit repeatedly by Abdalla, and
Alex Abdalla Jr., 17, who joined his father, Fetky said.
   As Santos was leaving, Rosado kicked him in the face and Abdalla
Sr. beat him with a metal spring while he lay unconscious on the
ground, Fetky said.
   Abdalla Jr., who was 16 at the time of the August 1988 beating,
pleaded guilty to juvenile delinquency in the case. He was
sentenced Oct. 12 and is serving up to four years in juvenile
custody.

<TEXT>
   Two public officials who defied the
Supreme Court by leading a prayer before a high school football
game in August have decided not to fight the case in court.
   Mayor Emory Folmar and Montgomery County Commission Chairman
William Joseph agreed not to conduct prayers before high school
football games, saying the school board has control over pregame
activities at the city-owned stadium.
   The reponse Wednesday by Folmar and Joseph to civil libertarians
who filed a lawsuit over the pre-game prayers leaves only a slim
chance that the case will go to trial as scheduled Jan. 4,
attorneys said.
   ``I think they've done the responsible thing,'' David Schoen, a
Montgomery attorney who filed the suit, said Thursday.
   A federal judge last month dismissed the Montgomery County Board
of Education from the case because it agreed not to sanction or
permit prayers before school-sponsored events. Folmar and Joseph
said they would honor that agreement.
   ``It's not a question of saying we were wrong or they were wrong
or the world is wrong,'' said Folmar. ``We in effect were stopped
from doing it by the school board.''

   Agnes Belushi, mother of actor Jim Belushi and
the late actor John Belushi, has died. She was 64.
   Mrs. Belushi died Thursday at her home in suburban Addison after
a battle with cancer.
   She and her husband, Adam, raised their four children in
Wheaton, where Belushi owned a restaurant and Mrs. Belushi worked
in a pharmacy.
   John Belushi bought a house for his parents in California after
his fame grew from appearances on television's ``Saturday Night

   Ethiopia has asked local aid
agencies to determine how to supply food to hundreds of thousands
of drought victims facing starvation in rebel-held northern zones,
a government official said Friday.
   If it comes about, it would be the first time President Mengistu
Haile Mariam's 15-year-old Marxist government has taken part in the
distribution of relief supplies to rebel areas.
   Foreign Minister Tesfaye Dinka, in describing his government's
plans to ambassadors and relief officials, said the drought was
affecting the northern provinces of Eritrea, Tigre, Wello and
Gondar, as well as parts of Harrar in the east and Omo in the south.
   Only Tigre, which is controlled by the rebel Tigre People's
Liberation Front, posed a problem, he said.
   The front, which has been fighting since 1975 for increased
autonomy and Mengistu's ouster, took control of Tigre in an
offensive this year. The province has an estimated population of 3
million.
   Because of the security situation, Tesfaye said the government
had asked its relief organization, the Relief and Rehabilitation
Commission to study how emergency food can be supplied to the area.
The commission is expected to have an anser within a month, he said.
   Other agencies to be involved are the Ethiopia Red Cross, the
Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the Mekane Yesus Evangelical Church, and
the Catholic Church, he said.
   The United Nations has estimated crop failures in northern
Ethiopia could threaten as many as 4 million people with starvation
and has appealed for 600,000 tons of emergency food. The
government's preliminary estimate of the number under the threat of
starvation was 1.8 million.
   Tesfaye did not mention the possibility of establishing safety
corridors through which food and supplies could move unhindered
into the embattled areas. President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya said
10 days ago that Mengistu had agreed to such a plan. Ethiopia has
not acknowledged Moi's announcement.

<HEAD>Government Says Mandela Won't Be Freed Before New Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government said Friday
that jailed black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela won't be freed
before the end of the year.
   Speculation remains strong, however, that Mandela will be freed
in January or early February.
   A broad range of black leaders say Mandela must be released
before they can accept President F.W. de Klerk's invitation to
negotiate a new Constitution that would extend political rights to
blacks.
   Rumors that Mandela would be freed before Christmas spread
earlier this week following unsubstantiated reports that British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher asked South African authorities to
take this step. Mrs. Thatcher's office denied that any time frame
had been added to her standing request that Mandela be freed ``as
soon as possible.''
   South Africa's Bureau for Information said Friday: ``In response
to numerous press inquiries concerning the possible release of Mr.
Nelson Mandela, the bureau would like to make it clear that there
will be no developments in this regard during the festive season.''
   The bureau said that meant Mandela would not be freed before
Jan. 1.
   Mandela, 71, is South Africa's best-known black leader. He has
been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for
plotting an anti-government sabotage campaign to be carried out by
his African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   Mandela lives at a staff house on a prison farm outside Cape
Town, and has been meeting frequently with anti-apartheid leaders
and government officials, including talks last week with de Klerk.
   Mandela met for six hours Friday with a five-man delegation from
the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the country's largest
and most militant labor federation.
   ``Mr. Mandela said he wants to be released into an environment
where he would be able to move freely amongst his people,'' said
one of the union leaders, John Ernstzen. ``He would like to see the
cessation of all hangings, treason trials and other methods the
state is using.''
   The mayor of Cape Town, Gordon Oliver, Friday released the text
of a letter he sent to Mandela requesting a meeting. Oliver said
the all-white City Council would like Mandela's advice on how to
carry out its goals of creating a city free of discrimination.
   The Prison Services confirmed Friday that Mandela had been
allowed the use of a telephone to confer with two of the African
National Congress's top exiled leaders. Col. Ray Gamble, a prison
spokesman, said Mandela was permitted to speak by phone Tuesday
with ANC secretary general Alfred Nzo and ANC external affairs
sectrary Thabo Mbeki while they were attending a political congress
in Zimbabwe.

<TEXT>
   The Christmas menu at the county jail of
turkey, dressing and cranberry sauce started some inmates thinking
that they may be eating better than some people on the outside.
   Len Singleton, who is serving time for disorderly conduct and
resisting arrest, wrote a letter to Sheriff Simon Leis Jr., asking
permission to organize a collection among the inmates.
   Some 500 inmates at the Hamilton County Justice Center and
Cincinnati's Community Correctional Institution responded by giving
up cigarettes and snacks, and Singleton on Thursday presented a
check for $361.41 to the Freestore-Foodbank.
   ``A lot of inmates who will be incarcerated are members of the
community. They still have their hearts there, and they wanted the
community to know that,'' Singleton said.
   ``One of the inmates said to me, `I can remember one time when I
was on the streets and the Freestore helped me out.' They said they
can always get cigarettes, but this is more important,'' he said.
   Prisoners are allowed money accounts, usually a few dollars left
by relatives to buy incidentals. Singleton said some inmates
donated their entire allowance.
   ``We've never been involved with anything like this,'' said
Steve Gibbs, the Freestore's executive director who accepted the
inmates' check Thursday at a jailhouse news conference. ``We
appreciate what they've done.''
   Gibbs said the private operation has a daily budget of $10,000
and will feed about 3,000 families during the holidays.
   ``Some of us will not be going home for Christmas to be with our
loved ones, but that doesn't mean we can't be involved in the
spirit of giving,'' Singleton said in his letter to Leis.
   Leis said he was skeptical, and almost threw the letter away.
   ``On further reflection, I thought it was a very good idea,''
Leis said. ``Going along with it was one of the smartest things
I've ever done as sheriff of Hamilton County.''

   A woman faces up to life in prison and a $10,000
fine after a jury convicted her of injuring her brain-damaged son
by blowing air through a feeding tube while the infant was
hospitalized.
   Brenda Garza, 23, of Lake Jackson, was secretly videotaped by
authorities at Texas Children's Hospital on June 8. Hospital
officials became concerned because the condition of Jesus Garza III
improved when he was with nurses but deteriorated after his
mother's visits.
   On the tape, she was seen blowing air into a tube that had been
inserted into the child's stomach. She also appeared to hold her
fingers against the child's windpipe.
   She then complained to a nurse that her child's stomach was
swollen. When the nurse would leave, the woman would blow through
the tube again, prosecutor Jan Krocker said.
   Jurors who convicted her of the first-degree felony Thursday and
now must consider punishment. Ms. Garza's attorney, Felix Cantu,
said his client deserved a second chance and wants jurors to
consider probation.

   Bowing to opposition led by the widow of the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the Board of Education has reversed
itself and decided to keep ROTC out of the high school named for
the late civil rights leader.
   The board voted to cancel the three-year program of the Air
Force Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps that was to have begun
in February, Robert F. Wagner Jr., board president, said Thursday.
   The board had approved the program in June, two months after the
faculty voted 102-59 against it.
   Wagner said a letter from Mrs. King to the board on Nov. 15 was
decisive. It said: ``My late husband, Dr. King, believed in the
principles of non-violence and worked tirelessly to pass this
message on to the youth of America. While I understand the need for
ROTC programs in other high schools, I believe that a military
program has no place in a school named in his honor.''
   Three city high schools have ROTC programs, which afford
students who complete the course a chance for scholarships and
possible admission to service academies.
   Air Force officials have said that if the program scheduled for
King High were not instituted there, it would be moved to another
city, possibly Rochester.

   ``Although no words were exchanged, Mr. Williams perceived
somehow that the victim wanted his turkey leg, took the 10-inch
knife and stabbed the other man once in the heart,'' O'Leary said.
   A patrolling transit police officer came upon the scene and
arrested Williams. Formal charges were being determined.
   The knife was recovered.

<HEAD>White House, Kremlin in Role Reversal</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's something of a role reversal and, it
seems, a rule reversal as well in the way the Kremlin and the White
House are dealing with each other on the American intervention in
Panama.
   Their words and contacts point to an effort on both sides to
keep the episode from intruding on the thaw in East-West relations.
   The Soviet Union denounced the U.S. military move, calling it an
invasion and an act of aggression _ but adding to that predictable
response the observation that it will not necessarily become a
problem issue between Moscow and Washington.
   President Bush sent a personal message to Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on the military action he ordered early
Wednesday against the Panamanian regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   He told a news conference Thursday that he needs to explain the
operation to Gorbachev more fully.
   ``It's not altogether surprising that he doesn't understand some
of the special arrangements the United States has in Panama,'' the
president said.
   Bush said he had responded to provocations that included the
killing of an unarmed American Marine, the brutalizing of American
citizens, the denial of office to a freely elected leader.
   Given all that, he said, his message would be:
   ``Then, Mr. Gorbachev, please understand, this president is
going to do something about it.
   ``So we have to explain,'' he said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the critical Soviet
statements were not unexpected, and that the initial comments may
have been issued before the first Bush message reached Gorbachev.
   Not that it would have made much difference. American
intervention, whatever the cause or justification, is guaranteed to
produce critical reaction from Moscow, just as the United States
has assailed Soviet moves in Afghanistan and elsewhere.
Furthermore, Noriega has close ties with Cuba, the Soviets' Western
ally, and with the Marxist government of Nicaragua.
   ``The United States must immediately stop its armed intervention
in Panama,'' said Vadim P. Perfiliev, spokesman for the foreign
ministry in Moscow. A Tass commentary said the U.S. action
encroaches on the progress attained elsewhere in world affairs.
   But those comments were tempered by Perfiliev's observation that
superpower relations have moved beyond the point at which any such
episode, anywhere in the world, was deemed a matter of East-West
confrontation.
   The U.S. intervention comes as the Soviet Union watches barriers
fall and governments turn from Communist dominance toward democracy
and free market economic systems. Moscow once proclaimed a doctrine
of limited sovereignty for the satellite states, insisting on its
right to intervene against threats to their Communist regimes.
   Intervention to keep the satellites in line was a Moscow habit
during the height of the Cold War. It happened then in East
Germany, in Hungary, in Czechoslovakia, in Poland.
   Gorbachev turned away from that posture. Indeed, while the
Romanian government was trying to put down protests with force, the
Soviet president said Wednesday that changes in Eastern Europe
should come ``peacefully, without violating public order and the
rights of citizens.''
   Moscow has not resisted the freedom movements that have changed
the face of Eastern Europe, most dramatically with the dismantling
of the Berlin Wall, and on Friday with the overthrow of the
hard-line Communist government in Romania.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, noted the possible connection, saying it was unfortunate
that the United States ``was required to take these steps in Panama
at a time when we are urging restraint on the part of the Soviet
Union toward other nations and on the part of China toward the
democratic aspirations of its own people.''
   Baker said the Soviet Union is supporting democracy through its
forbearance, and argued the United States is doing so by doing the
opposite in Panama, by intervening.
   ``Let me say that I think both the United States and the Soviet
Union today are supporting democracy,'' Baker said at a first-day
briefing on U.S. intervention in Panama.
   ``The difference is that the Soviet Union supports democracy by
staying out of countries and thus permitting democracy to proceed.
In this one and very unique instance, the United States did it by
going in to assist a democratically elected government against a
dictator.''
   The Panama operation drew protests from most Latin American
capitals, even from governments hostile to Noriega. He may be
detested, but so is Yankee intervention.
   Mexico, for example, said Panamanian problems must be resolved
by the Panamanian people.
   But they tried, and Noriega wouldn't let it happen, which is the
Baker argument.
   Noriega reneged on this year's elections because he was losing,
and installed his proxies to govern. The Organization of American
States tried to talk him into yielding power to an elected
government; five times its emissaries went to Panama City on that
futile mission.
   Latin American states voted at the OAS on Friday for a
resolution assailing ``the military intervention in Panama,'' a
measure that gained something in the translation.
   The English language version expressed regret, the Spanish
translation deplored the operation.
   The OAS urged an immediate end to the fighting and said American
troops should be withdrawn. The vote was 20 to 1; only the U.S.
delegate voted no.
   The Latin protests were inevitable. And despite the easing of
East-West tensions, Soviet officials and commentators weren't about
to let Washington off the hook easily.
   Georgi Arbatov, a Soviet expert on U.S. affairs, called the
operation a return to gunboat diplomacy and said it could
strengthen hardliners opposed to arms reductions.
   He also said in an ABC-TV interview that Noriega is a problem
the United States created for itself, by training him and once
having him on the CIA payroll.
   For all of that, there remains the possibility that the Panama
precedent could be argued in connection with future Soviet
intervention, if it comes to that, in a place like Lithuania. That
Baltic state has been part of the Soviet Union since 1940; an
independence movement there is strong and gaining despite Kremlin
warnings that it will come to grief and great trouble.

<HEAD>U.S. Planning to Resume Loans to Iraq</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration plans to lift a
congressional ban of government loans to Iraq, a move likely to
antagonize lawmakers who are critical of Iraq's human rights abuses
and credit problems.
   Officials say President Bush will exercise his right to lift the
ban, imposed by Congress several months ago, on grounds of U.S.
national interests. The officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the move is expected within several weeks.
   U.S. oil companies and other businesses have exerted heavy
pressure on the administration to broaden trade ties with Iraq
since the 1988 end of its ruinous eight-year war with Iran. The
administration wants to increase its influence over the government
of Iraqi strongman Sadam Hussein, who commands one of the Middle
East's strongest and most proven armies, as well as the world's
second-largest proven oil reserves.
   However, the move may anger lawmakers who are expected to take
up debate over reports of recent Iraqi testing of two long-range
missiles when Congress returns of the holiday recess next month.
   Iraq announced the testing earlier this month, saying it had
also test-fired a rocket able to carry satellites into space. The
Pentagon confirmed the test-firings, but has declined to discuss it
further.
   U.S. officials say they are concerned by the implications of
such a missile program for the arms race in the Middle East, and
have raised their concerns with the Iraqis.
   Critics also say the administration failed to act against Iraq
for attacking its Kurdish minority with nerve and mustard gas last
year.
   Congress voted to suspend $200 million in annual short-term
credits to Iraq by the Export-Import Bank, a U.S. government
institution that promotes the export of American goods. To head off
a presidential veto and respond to pressure from U.S. businesses,
Congress agreed to incorporate the executive branch's right to a
waiver.
   ``But there were many up here who didn't like it and wanted a
flat-out prohibition on Iraq,'' said a congressional source who
spoke on condition he not be named.
   ``We couldn't do that. Iraq is a major untapped market for the
U.S. in the Middle East,'' said one official, also speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Even with the credit problems, U.S. exports to Iraq nearly
doubled from 1987 to 1988, reaching $1.2 billion. For the first
nine months of 1989 exports totaled $909 million, mostly
agricultural commodities, according to Commerce Department
statistics.
   American oil imports from Iraq have risen sharply, from a daily
average of 83,000 barrels in 1987 to 345,000 barrels in 1988,
according to Energy Department figures. The year-end figures for
1989 are expected to show about a 40 percent increase over 1988.
   Iraq has run up a debt to foreign governments and banks
estimated at between $30 billion and $70 billion.
   In the long-run, Iraq's past performance and future oil capacity
make it a worthy credit risk. The government plans to increase its
daily oil output from 2.5 million barrels to 4 million once its oil
terminals, damaged in the war, are repaired.
   The Baghdad government is eager to attract U.S. business so it
can profit from American technology and build up its
export-oriented industries.

   A jury today recommended a 16-year prison
sentence for the man convicted of causing a fiery crash that killed
27 people on a church bus in the nation's worst drunken-driving
accident.
   Under Kentucky law, Larry Mahoney would have to spend eight
years in prison before he could be considered for parole. He was
tried on 27 counts of murder, which carried a life sentence, but
the jury convicted him Thursday of 27 counts of second-degree
manslaughter, lesser charge.
   Mahoney, 36, was composed as he stood to hear Judge Charles
Satterwhite read each of the sentence recommendations, but he
appeared to have tears welling in his eyes by the time the judge
concluded.
   Satterwhite must schedule a formal sentencing. He could give
Mahoney a lighter sentence than the jury recommended but cannot
exceed the jury's recommendation.
   The jury recommended 16 years of a possible 20-year sentence on
each of 12 counts of first-degree assault. It recommended maximum
prison terms of 10 years on each of 27 counts of second-degree
manslaughter, five years on each of 27 counts of first-degree
wanton endangerment and one year on each of 14 counts of
second-degree wanton endangerment, a misdemeanor.
   The jury then exercised its option of recommending that the
sentences run concurrently. The jury could have recommended
consecutive sentences in any possible combination.
   The recommendation was ``a big letdown'' for families of the
victims, said Bill Nichols, whose only child, 17-year-old William
Joseph Nichols Jr., was killed.
   ``Those people don't know what we're going through and I hope to
God they never have to,'' Nichols said. ``I've forgiven Larry
Mahoney, but he's got to pay for his crime and eight years is not
enough.''
   At a sentencing hearing Thursday, Mahoney had pleaded for a
chance to atone, saying he could warn schoolchildren of the dangers
of drinking and driving.
   The prosecutor, during the sentencing hearing, said Mahoney
should draw a long prison sentence because his victims, 24 of them
children, ``will never get the opportunity to ... talk to other
children.''
   Mahoney, a chemical plant worker, was driving on the wrong side
of Interstate 71 near Carrollton on May 14, 1988, when his pickup
collided with the bus. Autopsies showed the resulting fire, not the
crash, killed the victims.
   Mahoney also was convicted on 12 counts of first-degree assault,
for the children who were badly burned in the fire; on 27 counts of
first-degree wanton endangerment, representing others who escaped
the bus; and 14 counts of second-degree wanton endangerment, for
motorists who had to dodge his truck.
   He was acquitted of a 42nd wanton-endangerment charge.
   The penalty for first-degree assault is 10 to 20 years in
prison. Wanton endangerment in the first degree is a felony,
punishable by one to five years in prison, and a misdemeanor in the
second degree, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $500 fine.
   The final conviction was for drunken driving and the jury set
Mahoney's punishment at 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
   Defense attorneys had acknowledged that Mahoney was drinking on
the day of the accident, but they argued that a defective bus
design was the primary cause of the deaths, and that he had been
tricked into drunkenness.
   The bus was a 1977 model former school bus bought by the
Radcliff First Assembly of God church in Radcliff, Ky.
   In the sentencing hearing after the verdict, Mahoney took the
witness stand and told the jury he intended, after prison, to visit
schools to tell students ``never to drink and drive.''
   ``I know God kept me alive for a reason,'' he said.
   ``If I just save one life,'' Mahoney said, beginning to lose his
composure, ``at least that will be one life saved.''
   Mahoney later sobbed, as did his parents, sisters and other
relatives and some on the jury as Russell Baldani, one of Mahoney's
lawyers, pleaded for leniency.
   Baldani asked the jury to recommend 10-year sentences on the
assault charges and to exercise its option of ordering all
sentences to run concurrently. Mahoney would be eligible for parole
consideration after five years.
   Special prosecutor Paul Richwalsky, visibly disappointed by the
jury's refusal to convict Mahoney of murder, scoffed at the plea.
   ``For crime, there must be punishment,'' Richwalsky said. ``I am
sorry, (Mahoney) is sorry. But there are 27 people dead, 24 of them
children. They will never get the opportunity to go around and talk
to other children. ... They will never get the opportunity to
repent and atone.''
   The victims' lives were worth more than five to 10 years in
prison, Richwalsky said.
   Neither time nor Mahoney's conviction has healed the victims'
families' wounds, said one parent who attended a Radcliff First
Assembly of God board meeting Thursday night.
   ``I think some of us have put our lives together and can cope
with it now, but it's never over,'' said Jacob Pearman, whose
brother, John, drove the bus struck by Mahoney's pickup and was
killed.

<HEAD>Durable Goods Orders Suggest Economy Can Avoid Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for durable goods
posted the sharpest gain in a year last month, the government said
Friday in a report that analysts said suggests the economy can
avoid a recession.
   ``It's Merry Christmas to the economy,'' said Robert Brusca,
chief financial economist at Nikko Securities Co. Intl. in New
York. ``This report suggests there's more life in the economy than
a lot of people thought.''
   The Commerce Department report of a 5.1 percent jump in durable
goods orders ``shows that reports of an economic demise are
premature,'' added William K. MacReynolds, forecasting director for
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   Orders for durable goods _ ``big-ticket'' items expected to last
more than three years _ increased to a seasonally adjusted $130.7
billion last month after dropping 0.7 percent in October and 1.2
percent in September.
   The gain in orders was spread through all categories and was the
largest since a 7.4 percent jump last December. It averted the
first three-month decline since 1986.
   Brusca said there still are weak spots in the economy, but
added: ``I think we have to really distinguish between saying the
economy is weak and saying it is weakening. I think we can say the
economy is weak, but those who say it is still weakening are
holding on too long to an old forecast.''
   He said the economy apparently hit a trough in late summer,
brought down by high interest rates initiated by the Federal
Reserve to fight inflation. As inflation moderated, the central
bank has gradually permitted short-term rates to drop including a
quarter percentage point this week.
   MacReynolds said the new orders will lead to increased
production in the manufacturing sector of the economy which has
been particularly hard hit by the credit pinch.
   The closely watched non-defense capital goods sector rose 8.3
percent last month to $39 billion, the largest gain since a 10.1
percent increase last December. Economists use this category as a
barometer of business investment plans.
   Transportation orders posted the largest gain in the civilian
category, 10.5 percent to $36.7 billion after rising 2.1 percent in
October. Both aircraft and motor vehicles showed large increases,
the department said, surprising some in view of plummeting
automobile sales since the new models were introduced in October.
   Excluding transportation, durable goods orders would have risen
3.1 percent last month.
   Orders for electrical machinery jumped 7.9 percent to $21.7
billion, virtually all in communications equipment.
   Non-electrical machinery orders, including computers and a wide
variety of industrial equipment, rose 6.6 percent to $22.9 billion
after a 4.7 decline in October.
   Orders for primary metals were up 1.7 percent to $22.1 billion
after a 3.4 percent decrease in October.
   Defense orders rose 15.6 percent to $11.2 billion after a 9.1
percent decline the previous month. Excluding this volatile
category, orders would have gained 4.2 percent in November.
   Shipments of durable goods in November rose 1.5 percent to
$123.7 billion after a 3.1 decline in October.

<HEAD>Hidden Gifts Thrown Out with the Trash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKEWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jennifer Rachman thought a box of
bulging trash bags would be a good place to hide presents for her
family. Her husband thought the box should go out with the trash.
   The box, concealing luggage for her husband and a TV set for her
8-year-old son Jake, was gone for two hours Wednesday before Mrs.
Rachman found out. A frantic call went out to BZ Disposal.
   ``They were sorry, but they said there was absolutely no chance
I could find my box,'' Mrs. Rachman recalled. ``They said by then
it was buried under tons and tons of garbage. I called the dump,
and they said the same thing. Then I sat down and cried for two
hours.''
   But she underestimated the disposal company. Truck driver Genaro
Duran was curious about the box and set it aside. Later he found
the gifts and, figuring some thief had dumped loot, told a
supervisor, Manuel Sarinana.
   The supervisor took the box to the company office and there
someone remembered Mrs. Rachman's telephone call.
   ``It was,'' Mrs. Rachman said, ``my little miracle.''

<HEAD>At Russian Bookstore, Monopoly Games Amid the Samovars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panicked over finding a Christmas gift for
somebody who's got everything? Why not pick up a Russian-language
version of Monopoly, where glasnost-happy capitalists can build
hotels on Gorky Street and pay 200 rubles to get sprung from jail.
   The trendy tribute to Gorbachev-style openness is available for
$29.50 at the suburban Rockville, Md., headquarters of Victor
Kamkin Inc., the largest Russian bookstore in the Western world.
   The Monopoly game follows the format of the long-popular U.S.
version and both are published by Parker Brothers Inc., but the
board names are Russian and the play money is rubles.
   The most expensive property is not Boardwalk but the Arbat, a
fashionable historic district of Moscow, which sells for 400 rubles
(about $75).
   ``The game is bought mostly by our American customers who speak
Russian, and is very popular among students,'' said Anatoly
Zabavsky, the bookstore's vice president and general manager.
``Russian emigrees are not familiar with Monopoly. They consider it
more a purely capitalist invention.''
   Nestled among the samovars, lacquered wooden dolls and
balalaikas at the Kamkin gift counter, the Monopoly game is a
symbolic reminder of the way that Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has turned East-West relations upside down.
   Not to mention the glasnost's impact on the Kamkin bookstore,
where business is booming.
   The store was founded by Russian emigre Victor Kamkin and his
wife, Elena, in 1953. Zabavsky, who was born in Poland of Russian
parents, moved to the United States from Germany in 1951 and, after
becoming an electrical engineer, joined Kamkin nearly 20 years
later.
   Since Kamkin died in 1974, Zabavsky has shared day-to-day
supervision of the business with Elena Kamkin.
   The bookstore boasts about 2.5 million volumes and an estimated
250,000 separate titles, as well as numerous Russian magazines and
newspapers. It had $2.5 million in sales last year. Its biggest
customers are U.S. government agencies, the academic community,
corporations and Soviet emigrees.
   ``I see grandmothers _ babushkas _ coming in here and spending
their pension money on Russian children's books, to make sure their
grandchildren will learn their mother tongue,'' he said.
   By all accounts, those figures make Kamkin the biggest Russian
bookstore outside the Soviet Union. In Moscow, the four-story Dom
Knigi (``House of Books'') a mile from the Kremlin stocks more
volumes _ many of them obscure, unread political documents _ but
students of Soviet affairs say Kamkin offers a much wider selection
of titles.
   Glasnost has meant the end of Kamkin's role as a clandestine
rendezvous point for Cold War adversaries, Zabavsky said in an
interview.
   Nowadays, he said, U.S. intelligence agents and KGB officers
from the Soviet Embassy no longer appear regularly to roam Kamkin's
aisles, spying on each other in the hope of learning what the other
side is reading.
   Moreover, Zabavsky says he's astounded by the abundance of
Russian books flooding the export market, many of them once
suppressed or banned by Soviet authorities.
   ``We publish a weekly catalog of books for our 18,000 mail-order
subscribers, and we offer about 1,000 new titles every month,''
Zabavsky said. ``In the past, a half-dozen of those titles might be
bestsellers. Now we have a problem deciding because everything is a
bestseller, many of them never been published before.''
   He shakes his head as he mentions Soviet exports of works by
once-disgraced authors Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Vasily Aksenov, Roy
Medvedev, Vasily Grossman and Vladimir Voinovich. Even Vladimir
Nabokov's erotic ``Lolita'' is now published by the Soviets, he
says.
   ``Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would ever see them
in print,'' he said. ``This glasnost, it's really overwhelming.''

<HEAD>Salvation Army Office Reopens in Time for Christmas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A flood of overnight donations saved
the Salvation Army here, which had been swamped by needy families
and closed four days before Christmas.
   ``The outpouring of the public has been marvelous,'' Maj. Robert
Pfeiffer, who runs the office, said Friday. Pfeiffer said several
thousand dollars had been donated by corporations and individuals
after word of the closing spread.
   On Thursday, Pfeiffer closed his doors because he ran out of
money for food and gifts for those in need. Pfeiffer's $80,000
budget, which proved adequate in past years to take the local
office from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, fell short this year because
more families than usual needed assistance.
   The money that came in Thursday night and Friday morning will
keep the office afloat, Pfeiffer said.
   ``We are not turning anyone away,'' Pfeiffer said. ``The
Salvation Army is alive and well in New Bedford.''
   Pfeiffer blamed recent layoffs of 1,000 workers at various
businesses for the increase in needy families. Friday, 400 more
were laid off as the Carol Electronic Cables closed, he said.
   ``The families I was seeing were basically recently unemployed
people _ people who didn't have great life savings,'' Pfeiffer
said. ``I had people who said `Last year we gave to you, and this
year we have to come and take.'''
   His office usually helps about 1,300 families during the
Christmas season. This year, 300 additional families came.
   On Thursday, Pfeiffer shut down after more than 100 people came
to the office seeking help. He offered assistance to those
families, but said he could not take anybody else.
   ``We've gone into using the canned food we had put aside for
January and February,'' Pfeiffer said.
   About half a dozen bell ringers were scattered through New
Bedford seeking more money Thursday, Pfeiffer said.

<HEAD>Educators' Pension Fund Head Was 75</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William C. Greenough, developer of the
variable-annuity pension and one-time head of the biggest pension
fund in the United States, has died of complications from a heart
attack. He was 75.
   Greenough died Wednesday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical
Center.
   The Indiana-born and -educated economist was president and then
chairman of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College
Retirement Equities Fund from 1957 until his retirement in 1979.
The $82 billion fund covers more than a million educators and
administrators in 4,300 institutions.
   Greenough put forward the idea of a variable-annuity stock fund
in the early 1950s when he was vice president of the fund. The
approach was based on his perception that over the long run a
diverse portfolio of common stocks would outperform traditional
fixed-dollar pensions.
   Greenough was a director of the New York Stock Exchange for 10
years beginning in 1972 and in 1979 served on President Carter's
Commission on Pension Policy.
   Greenough is survived by his wife, Doris; two sons, David, of
Downington, Pa., and Walter, of Chicago, and a daughter, Martha
Alice.
   A service will be held Jan. 12 in All-Souls Unitarian Church.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Soviet
legislators today voiced support for the popular uprising in
Romania.
   During today's session of the Soviet Congress, Gorbachev, who
chaired the proceedings, periodically doubled as news announcer and
read aloud the latest reports from Romania as the regime of
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu toppled.
   When he announced that Romanian Radio was reporting Ceausescu
had been arrested, the Congress broke into applause.
   He then proposed a resolution to send Romanians a vote of
support for the changes there, and the motion passed overwhelmingly.
   ``At this crucial period for the fate of Romania,'' the
resolution said, ``the Second Congress of People's Deputies offers
its decisive support for the just cause of the people of Romania.''
   ``We declare to the citizens of Romania our traditional feeling
of friendship and good-neighborliness and stress our sincere
striving for close cooperation in the interest of socialism and
peace,'' it concluded.
   Earlier in the day, the Congress passed a resolution expressing
serious concern over the dramatic events in Romania and called for
a peaceful end to the unrest.
   The first resolution was adopted after Gorbachev announced that
information received from Soviet diplomats in Romania indicated
that the situation had seriously worsened overnight. He did not
elaborate.
   That resolution expressed hopes for a peaceful settlement of
Romania's problems ``in the spirit of tolerance, humaneness and
respect for human rights.''

<TEXT>
   The U.S Post Office's refusal to let the
post office in this village put Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
stickers on holiday mail has some people seeing red.
   The Postal Service, citing cost and time, told Rudolph
Postmaster Joanne Patton she couldn't add stickers bearing the face
of Santa Claus' most famous aides to envelopes this holiday season.
   ``I think it stinks,'' said Paul Davidson.
   Each year, the small post office is swamped with cards from
people who want the village's postmark on their mail. Last year,
Mrs. Patton decided to add putting stickers on each piece of mail.
   More holiday mail than ever came through Rudolph.
   ``We had a lot of fun with it,'' Mrs. Patton said. ``People told
us how wonderful it was and it put everyone in the holiday spirit.''
   The sectional postal center in Toledo, however, decided the
stickers were taking up too much time and money, and ordered Mrs.
Patton not to use them this year. Last year's batch of stickers
cost several hundred dollars.
   Bob Hill, director of Postal Service field operations in Toledo,
said the response to the stickers overwhelmed the small post
office. The village has 500 residents.
   Since each letter had to be handled by employees, it interfered
with automation, Hill said.
   Mrs. Patton said mail dropped off at the post office after the
decison to drop the stickers. The Rudolph branch will handle 4,000
letters and cards this holiday season compared with 7,000 in 1988.
   ``I hate to have the Postal Service coming off sounding like
Scrooges,'' Mrs. Patton said. ``I understand their concerns. It
took a lot of time for us to put them on and it did get rather
expensive. But it was fun and people liked them.''

   A cigar box in a tavern was the first honor
this small community could offer a hometown soldier who was killed
during the U.S. invasion of Panama just days before his birthday.
   The box was placed in the tavern to raise money for a memorial
for Pfc. John Mark Price, who would have turned 23 on Christmas Eve.
   ``He did not have enough money'' to come home for the holidays,
said his mother, Diane Price. ``His presents are not under the
tree, they're in the mail.''
   This holiday season was the first since her husband's death
three years ago that Mrs. Price put up of Christmas tree and
decorated her house. Her husband, John, died suddenly of a heart
attack in October 1986.
   ``I lost a husband. I thought that was bad. But this is even
harder,'' she said in a telephone interview Friday.
   Mrs. Price said the Army had not released details of her son's
death during the invasion Wednesday. His body has been taken to
Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for preparation for burial.
   ``He will be buried by his dad,'' a weeping Mrs. Price said.
   Friends in Conover, a town of about 150 near the
Wisconsin-Michigan line, said they remembered the Army Ranger as a
polite, hard-working, jovial young man who enjoyed his military
service.
   ``He was an extremely friendly person and outgoing for a young
chap,'' Postmaster Lorrayne Maki said. ``He dearly was loved by
everyone. He was the most ideal American boy you would find.''
   Price was a paratrooper based at Fort Lewis, Wash. He enlisted
in the Army in 1988 to raise money so he could return to college,
his mother said. His two brothers are also in the Army.
   ``I just couldn't understand why he wanted to do it. I guess he
was a person who wanted a challenge,'' Mrs. Price said. ``Whatever
he was in, he gave it 100 percent. He was very religious and he
really loved the Lord.''
   Mrs. Price, an ambulance worker, said she talked to her son Dec.
10 and he hinted he was headed on a big mission, but he did not say
where he was going.
   ``He just said something big was going to happen, just watch the
news,'' she recalled.
   Penny Lafata, 30, talked with him during his last visit home in
June.
   ``He just really loved being in the Rangers. He was really
enthusiastic about it,'' she said. ``He talked about the survival
training, those kinds of things.''
   Price, who went by his middle name Mark, was the oldest of four
children. His sister, Ruth Ann, 21, attends college in Illinois.
His 20-year-old brother Jim is an infantryman based in Oklahoma,
and his brother, Dan, 19, is an artillery man bases in Kansas. Both
were returning to Conover on Friday.
   Townspeople started a collection to buy a memorial, probably a
bronze plaque, for Price. By Thursday night, a cigar box at the
Cocktail Corner tavern contained $10 for the ``Mark Price
Memorial.''
   Mary Ann Manijak said she would place coffee cans throughout the
town to collect more money.
   ``There are 50 states, and Conover, which is so small, to have
this happen to one of our boys...'' she said.
   At Eagle River Memorial Hospital, where Mrs. Price works, the
flag was at half-staff Friday, said Nancy Rozga, an ambulance
supervisor and friend of Mrs. Price. Hospital workers were passing
around an envelope for money, she said.
   Mrs. Price said she supported President Bush's decision to
mobilize troops in Panama to out Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``I am not angry about what happened. When there is war people
get killed,'' she said.
   Price graduated from Northland Pines High School in nearby Eagle
River in 1985. He attended college briefly in the Chicago area,
worked in a paint factory, returned to Conover and worked in a car
wash before joining the Army.
   ``He was small town kid. He knew everybody. He loved hunting,
fishing, the outdoors,'' Mrs. Price said. ``If God created a person
to live up here in the northwoods, it would be him.''

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega told an American
lawyer that he expected the United States to invade his country,
hours before U.S. troops attacked, New York Newsday reported Friday.
   A member of the law firm Slotnick &amp; Baker met with Noriega to
discuss publishing rights to his memoirs, which the now-deposed
Panamanian leader has been writing for several months, partner
Barry Slotnick told the newspaper.
   Noriega said he had completed a ``substantial portion'' of the
manuscript, describing his rise to power through Panama's military
and detailing his work for U.S. intelligence, Newsday reported.
   ``He realized his time was very short in terms of his ability to
maintain himself in Panama,'' Slotnick said. ``He knew the Justice
Department wanted him on trial; he was aware the United States was
going to invade; he felt they wanted to kill or capture him.''
   He said Noriega appeared calm during the afternoon meeting
afternoon in Panama City. U.S. forces invaded at midnight Tuesday.
   Slotnick said no publishing agreement was reached. He said
Noriega would not allow any U.S. company to publish the book or buy
the film rights.
   The lawyer did not return a telephone call Friday.

   President Bush appealed today to Americans
to demonstrate compassion for victims of AIDS, saying that a
``misplaced fear'' of the deadly disease was preventing some people
from helping.
   Bush underscored his point by touring the clinical wards of the
National Institutes of Health, meeting children ranging in age from
less than a year to early teens who are being treated with
experimental AIDS drugs. He was accompanied by his wife, Barbara.
   Later, addressing health professionals involved in fighting
AIDS, Bush said, he wanted to educate ``Americans who don't want to
help, don't want to become involved because of a misplaced fear.
   ``They're afraid of holding an AIDS patient because they're
frightened of getting AIDS,'' the president said.
   ``Barbara and I want to say and we hope we can continue to
demonstrate this: They are wrong. They are simply uninformed. They
are wrong about that.''
   He praised the courage of doctors and nurses and parents and
counselors who are working against AIDS.
   Bush said that after being ``in a room full of kids with AIDS
... I thought of how there is no reason to fear for your health _
just their health,'' the president said.
   ``And I want to thank those who are not afraid, especially
foster parents who have opened their homes and their hearts and
those of you here today who do so much for so many.''
   Bush said, ``Only together can we wage all-out war against this
terrible killer.''
   There are about 30 children in the NIH AIDS wards now. They are
all being treated experimentally with a variety of doses and types
of drugs designed to fight the human immunodeficiency virus, or
HIV, that causes AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``I think the visit is to cheer up the troops who work with AIDS
patients,'' said spokeswoman Ann Thomas.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis D. Sullivan and his
wife, Ginger, were accompanying the president and Mrs. Bush on the
45-minute NIH tour.
   An HHS source said Bush asked Sullivan to arrange the visit ``to
say think you to the NIH staff.''
   ``He really wants to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of
these people,'' the source said.
   Sullivan told reporters that Bush is making the tour ``to
demonstrate his personal support for biomedical research and NIH.''
   No personnel announcements were expected during the presidential
visit. The directorship of NIH has been vacant since James
Wyngaarten resigned last July.
   The children infected with the AIDS received the virus from
their mothers at birth or from blood transfusions.
   They are being treated with zidovudine, commonly called AZT, and
with a new experimental AIDS drug called DDI.
   ``All of the patients are here as voluntary research subjects,''
said Ms. Haske.
   It was research of this type that led Sullivan in October to
approve distribution of AZT for treatment of children with AIDS.
AZT, which now is the only approved AIDS drug, formerly was
reserved only for adult patients because there was concern that
side effects from the drug would be more severe among children.
   DDI is now in advanced clinical trials, but has not been
approved for general prescription use.

   NBC News anchorman Tom Brokaw says he
has bought an interest in a 4,000-acre ranch as a mountain retreat.
   Brokaw said he has been looking for Montana property since 1981,
when he came to the state to film an NBC special and became
enchanted.
   ``I think the world of Montana and I've always wanted to be a
part of it,'' he said. He now is honorary chairman of Friends of
Montana, a program of the Nature Conservancy.
   ``Of course, one of the reasons I bought it was to be able to
get away from the frantic life I lead and to have some privacy,''
Brokaw told the Billings Gazette in an interview published Friday.
   ``I don't want to get involved in a lot of controversy there,
but I do want to support some of the things I think are
important,'' he said. ``One of those is certainly protecting the
wide open areas that make Montana so attractive.''
   Brokaw's ranch is near the north flank of the Absaroka-Beartooth
Wilderness Area in an area known for its spectacular peaks and
blue-ribbon trout streams. Actres-model Brooke Shields, actor
Michael Keaton and novelist Tom McGuane are other local landowners.

   Times have mellowed for Ron Kovic,
the former Marine whose life is depicted by Tom Cruise in ``Born on
the Fourth of July.''
   Once the angry man who rallied the Vietnam Veterans Against the
War, Kovic is now occupying himself with artwork and other creative
undertakings. He co-wrote the script for the autobiographical film
directed by Oliver Stone. Stone collaborated on the script.
   The film outlines Kovic's nightmarish passage from all-American
boy and superpatriotic soldier to wheelchair activist against the
war.
   In a recent interview, he described his joy that Stone, a friend
and fellow Vietnam veteran, undertook bringing his life story to
film.
   Kovic, 43, said he was at first skeptical about Cruise. Now, he
says he is astonished at his performance.
   ``Many people wondered, `Could Tom Cruise do it? Could he pull
it off?''' Kovic said. ``When he did, it was just so exhilarating.''

   A 10-year-old Fort Mill, S.C., girl
waiting for a heart transplant was given permission to go home for
Christmas, but not before she got a stellar sendoff from actor Tom
Cruise.
   ``When he came in the room, her heart monitor showed her heart
rate went up to 170 beats a minute,'' Ginger Mason said. ``She was
absolutely so excited she couldn't stand it.''
   Cruise, who was filming Paramount Pictures' ``Days of Thunder''
at Charlotte Motor Speedway, brought Brandi Mason a hat and shirt,
autographed her pillowcase and then visited some of the other
children at Charlotte Memorial Hospital on Thursday.
   Doctors said they don't know when a heart will be available for
Brandi, who was found to have myocarditis, a rare viral infection
of the heart, in July.

   Christmas is a special time, a time when one
politician can spend tax money sending special holiday greetings,
and another politician can complain about it.
   Mayor Andrew Young sent jumbo Christmas cards this year to 1,500
area reporters, ministers, supporters and public officials,
including Lt. Gov. Zell Miller _ who just happens to be a candidate
for governor next year, just like the mayor.
   The 9x14 cards, featuring a montage of Atlanta accomplishments,
Young's smiling face and the legend ``Municipal Leader of The Year
1989,'' cost the city a little more than a buck apiece to print,
and 65 cents to mail.
   ``I think it is inappropriate to spend $1 apiece to send a
Christmas card out at the city's expense,'' Miller said Thursday.
``If the man is elected governor, what will he send out in 1991 _ a
billboard?''
   The response from the Young camp? ``What a Scrooge,'' said press
secretary Lee Echols.

   U.S. troops think they almost got
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on the first day of the intervention
when they broke into a fortified house, finding signs of panicky
flight and, by one account, ``vats of blood'' and animal entrails.
   The abandoned office and house, on the seacoast near here and
close to several U.S. military bases, was stormed by U.S. soldiers
on Tuesday, about six hours after the U.S. invasion began.
   ``The cigarettes were still smoking in the ashtray and the women
left their purses, which no woman would ever usually do,'' a
soldier familiar with the house said Thursday.
   But Noriega was not to be found in the retreat that had been
specially built for him, and soldiers continued scouring the
countryside Friday for the deposed leader wanted in the United
States on drug charges.
   The American soldier, who would not give his name, said troops
who saw the house spread the word that one room was apparently
devoted to the occult, with blood and entrails.
   Military officials could not immediately confirm the soldier's
account.
   Saying the house might have been booby-trapped, officers would
not allow reporters and photographers inside, Gen. John Huston said.
   Another soldier, Sgt. 1st Class Joseph Torregrossa, said there
were bizarre trappings in another of Noriega's quarters, his
private office in Panama's military barracks at Fort Amadar.
   ``When we went inside, there were all of these expensive prints,
but he also had a portrait of Adolf Hitler and a lot of expensive
weapons, mostly automatic,'' Torregrossa said. ``He had German
Lugers, Israeli Uzis, all sorts of real sophisticated stuff.''
   Travel restrictions, including a nighttime curfew, were still in
effect Friday, and new fighting was reported with men loyal to
Noriega attacking the headquarters of the U.S. Southern Command.
   A two-hour tour through a bombed-out shopping district that once
was a Noriega stronghold showed scenes of near chaos as thousands
of looters seized refrigerators, microwaves, automobile tires,
gasoline and other goods.
   They cheerfully stopped, however, to shout ``Viva Bush, Viva
Bush'' or ``Bush, Bush, Bush'' as they waved to soldiers and
journalists. One held up a knife sharpener and joked, ``It's a
present from Bush.''
   Noriega's nine-building headquarters was a smouldering hulk, its
windows blown out by tank and artillery fire. It was closely
guarded by dozens of U.S. troops.
   Less than a mile away, the body of a man, face down and
shirtless, lay trapped in the crushed wreckage of a sedan. A U.S.
infantry sergeant said an armored personnel carrier rolled over the
car after the driver was seen passing out AK-47 rifles.
   An old section of the city around Noriega headquarters contained
many of Panama City's poor and homeless, but they had largely
abandoned it, taking refuge in quarters provided by U.S. military
at the American-owned Balboa High School in the suburbs, U.S.
officials said.

<TEXT>
   A motorist who struck and killed a
pedestrian today drove for nearly nine miles with the victim on the
hood, police said.
   The motorist, James A. Vandermeer of Rochester, 25, was charged
with felony driving while intoxicated. Police would not comment on
whether he knew the victim was on the hood.
   The pedestrian was identified as Gilbert T. Nettles Jr., 26.
   Rochester Police Capt. Michael Karnes said Nettles was struck as
he walked in the right lane of Interstate 390 about 2:40 a.m.
Nettles' auto apparently had broken down on an exit ramp in the
Rochester suburb of Greece.
   Police said Nettles hit the front passenger windshield, and was
apparently caught in the shattered windshield.
   Vandermeer continued south on I-390 and was spotted by a Monroe
County sheriff's deputy investigating an unrelated traffic accident.
   ``He saw this vehicle pass with the man on top of it,'' Karnes
said. ``Obviously he was startled by the sight. He had no way of
pursuing it, so he broadcast it over the police radio.''
   Karnes said Vandermeer called police from his apartment at 3:11
a.m. to report an accident. Police found Nettles' body on the trunk
of the car, where it had apparently been moved.
   According to state Department of Motor Vehicles records,
Vandermeer does not have a valid New York state driver's license.
He was convicted Dec. 1, 1986, for operating a motor vehicle
without a license.

<HEAD>Soldiers Kill 3 Palestinians in West Bank</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers shot and killed three
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank on Friday, including the
16-year-old sister of a suspect they sought to apprehend in a
village raid, Arab reports said.
   The army confirmed two deaths from the village raid and said the
suspect was among the seven people wounded in Jaba village. He was
identified by Arab reporters as Mohammed Taysir Alawneh, 22, who
had been sought for anti-Israeli activities in the two-year
Palestinian uprising.
   The deaths came a day after Israeli troops shot and killed two
Palestinians in a similar raid in the nearby village of Beit Furik.
   In a separate incident, soldiers fatally wounded 19-year-old
Yaacoub Ramahi in a clash with stonethrowing youths in the town of
El-Bireh, Arab reporters said.
   Israel radio said the youth was part of a group of masked
Palestinians throwing building blocks and iron bars at a military
patrol.
   An army spokesman said the military was investigating the
incident.
   Also Friday, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy from Bethlehem died
of wounds reportedly suffered when an Israeli civilian fired on him
four months ago.
   The child, who died at Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital, was
Mohammed Jamil Eid Kamel. He had been paralyzed since Aug. 7, when
Palestinian witnesses reported he was shot in the neck by a passing
Israeli motorist.
   A general strike to mourn Kamel's death closed shops and
businesses Friday in Bethlehem, residents said. Hundreds of
Christian pilgrims are expected in the biblical town starting
Sunday for the Christmas holiday.
   The latest deaths raised to 637 the number of Arabs killed by
Israelis since the Palestinian revolt against Israeli rule began in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in December 1987.
   At least 161 other Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs,
most on suspicion of collaboration with Israel. Forty-three
Israelis also have died in the violence.
   The army said soldiers ``met resistance'' during a Friday raid
in Jaba, six miles north of Nablus.
   As troops were trying to enter the home of a suspect, an officer
fired in self-defense when he was attacked by a Palestinian woman
with a knife, the army said. The woman was killed, and the officer
slightly wounded, it said.
   Arab reports said she was Asmahan Taysir Alawneh, 16, the sister
of the suspect.
   The army quoted hospital officials as saying a Palestinian
teen-ager was fatally shot in a subsequent stone-throwing clash
with troops in Jaba. Arab reports identified him as Iyad Mohammed
Said Hassan, 18.
   Nine Palestinians were shot and wounded in stone-throwing
clashes with Israeli troops in the Gaza Strip on Friday, Arab
reports said. The army said it was checking the reports.

<HEAD>Six Beheaded in Saudi Arabia For Drug Smuggling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six people convicted of drug
smuggling were beheaded in public Friday in the northeastern city
of Arar, the government said.
   The six _ three Saudi Arabians, a Syrian, a Jordanian and a Turk
_ were convicted by Islamic courts of smuggling hashish into the
kingdom, the Interior Ministry said.
   Capital punishment for drug importing was introduced by the
kingdom in recent years in an attempt to curb drug smuggling, which
has been spreading rapidly since the oil bonanza years in Saudi
Arabia and the rest of the region.
   The theocratic kingdom rules by the Koran, which prescribes
beheading for murder, stoning for adultery and hand cutting for
theft.
   Moslem theologians ruled that capital punishment was applicable
to drug smugglers because beheading covered those who ``spread
corruption on the face of the Earth.''
   About a dozen other drug smugglers have been beheaded this year,
most of them Pakistani nationals.
   Beheadings are usually carried out in public squares opposite
mosques following the Friday prayers, and sometimes the bodies are
hung on crossed beams to act as a deterrent.

<HEAD>Lithuanian Lawmaker Calls on Kremlin to Start Talks on Independence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Lithuanian lawmaker Friday challenged the
Kremlin in front of the entire Soviet parliament to begin talks
leading to full independence for his Baltic republic.
   Lithuania ``was forcibly included in the Soviet Union,'' said
deputy Kazimeras Motieka. If the Kremlin is serious about reform,
he said, it should move to eliminate the results of the crimes of
dictator Josef Stalin, who annexed the Baltic region.
   ``As a person empowered by the voters of Lithuania, I call upon
the government of the U.S.S.R. to begin official negotiations in
the near future with fully empowered representatives of Lithuania
on the liquidation of Stalinist crimes and on the restoration of
the independence of the Lithuanian state,'' Motieka told the
Congress of People's Deputies, or parliament.
   Drawing a parallel with Romania, where President Nicolae
Ceausescu was overthrown Friday, Motieka said: ``We also have a
dictator: Moscow. If the Soviet Union is building a government of
laws, well, legality and occupation don't go together.''
   The challenge by Motieka, a lawyer, came two days after the
Lithuanian Communist Party voted to declare itself independent from
its mother party in Moscow.
   It was the first time a delegate from one of the restive Baltic
republics used the national parliament to advance demands for full
independence, and it marked the latest step in the Baltic
progression from calls for sovereignty to outright secession.
   After Motieka's speech, Lithuanian deputy Vytautas Landsbergis
said the Lithuanian parliament had already created a commission
that is working on the steps necessary for the Baltic state to
achieve independence. Motieka's appeal stemmed from that
commission's work, said Landsbergis, head of the Lithuanian
people's front, known as Sajudis.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev responded sharply to the
Lithuanian Communist Party's decision Wednesday to separate from
the Soviet Communist Party.
   Gorbachev sent a message to Lithuanian Communists on Thursday
saying their decision could only be assessed ``as a step aimed at
the split of the Lithuanian Communist Party from the Soviet
Communist Party.''
   His message said the ruling Politburo would convene an emergency
meeting soon to address the move.
   Landsbergis said he thought the Lithuanian Communist Party's
decision to secede was a normal ``step in perestroika.''
   Delegates from the Baltic republics have been struggling for the
last two days over Congress' plans to create a committee to rule on
conflicts between local laws passed in the republics and national
Soviet law.
   Baltic deputies object that because they were unlawfully
incorporated into the Soviet Union, they should not be forced to
comply with Moscow's laws. Baltic deputies say it makes no sense to
establish a committee to oversee a constitution that is being
rewritten as the country reforms.
   A committee that developed the legislation offered a compromise
that would limit the Constitutional Oversight Commission's right to
review certain ethnic issues, but Baltic republics said the wording
of the compromise was too vague. It was sent back to the committee.

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Khmer Rouge guerrillas Friday claimed
to have captured the third district capital since Vietnam's troop
withdrawal from Cambodia three months ago, according to the
guerrilla radio.
   The Voice of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea said the
guerrillas had been besieging the area around the town of Anlung
Veng since mid-November.
   ``On the 19th and 20th of December, our Cambodian national
resistance forces launched an offensive to destroy and completely
liberate the strategic Anlung Veng position,'' said a transcript of
the radio report seen in Bangkok.
   If true, the seizure of Anlung Veng would one of the most
important Khmer Rouge victories since their seizure of the western
town and district capital of Pailin Oct. 22.
   The Khmer Rouge also say they have taken the district seat of
Samlot.
   The radio said Anlung Veng had protected the entire government
defense network along the Dangrek mountain range, which marks the
border between Cambodia and Thailand.
   ``The attack and liberation of this position ... has basically
dismantled the networks defending the positions of the Vietnamese
enemies and their puppets along the Dangrek mountain range,'' it
said.
   The guerrillas also claimed they had ``attacked and swept''
other positions along route 69 and to the south and east of Anlung
Veng.
   The Communist Khmer Rouge is the strongest of the guerrilla
factions fighting the government Vietnam installed in Phnom Penh
after its late-1978 invasion.
   The invasion ended a 3{-year reign of terror by the Khmer Rouge
in which hundreds of thousands of Cambodians were killed.
   Since Hanoi's avowed late-September troop withdrawal, the
guerrillas have launched big attacks and seized several towns in
the northwestern part of the country. The Khmer Rouge maintain that
Hanoi's withdrawal was a trick and that tens of thousands of
disguised Vietnamese soliders remain in the country.
   The radio report said the area around Anlung Veng was defended
by the Vietnamese 302nd division and government soldiers from the
4th military region.

   A prosecutor calls it ``witchcraft'' and a
psychologist says it's as reliable as a coin toss.
   After years of debate, court rulings and federal legislation,
use of the polygraph has dropped sharply, despite supporters who
insist the test is a good indicator of whether someone is telling a
lie.
   ``They have been useless and give misleading information,'' said
Leonard Saxe, a visiting professor of psychology at Brandeis
University and a leading opponent of polygraph testing. ``They
suggest whether you're guilty or innocent. You might as well flip a
coin.''
   Last week, the state Supreme Court banned lie detector tests
from being introduced as evidence in criminal trials. Massachusetts
had been one of the last remaining states that gave defendants the
right to use polygraphs to support their alibis.
   The court, noting polygraph studies have shown success rates
varying from 95 percent to just above 50 percent, said: ``There
remains no consensus among experts as to the accuracy of polygraph
testing to detect deceit.''
   The court was not alone in deciding against polygraphs, which
attempt to determine someone's honesty by their physiological
response to certain questions.
   Last year, Congress prohibited most private sector employers
from using lie dectectors to screen job applicants or randomly test
workers.
   Exempted from the rules were federal, state and local
governments, firms that do sensitive work for agencies like the CIA
and FBI, companies that provide security services and those that
make or distribute controlled substances.
   ``I think it's appropriate to seek if someone is lying, and the
most appropriate way is to seek evidence,'' said Judy Crockett, who
fought on behalf of the federal law for the American Civil
Liberties Union. ``Polygraphs tend to be an attempt to short-cut
investigations.''
   The federal law, which took effect a year ago, has taken a big
bite out of the polygraph business.
   ``There's been a definite decline in the private sector,'' said
Chris Fausett, product manager for Lafayette Instrument Co., based
in Lafayette, Ind., one of the country's largest makers of
polygraph machines.
   He declined to give specific numbers, but he said the drop was
``about as sharp as you can get.''
   ``No doubt businesses have had to abandon 75-80 percent of
polygraph tests,'' said Joseph Buckley, a spokesman for the
American Polygraph Association, a trade group based in Chattanooga,
Tenn.
   Buckley said his group had about 3,000 members a year ago, but
the number has dropped by a third. ``A lot of them had to change
careers,'' he said.
   However, these trends do not mean polygraph testing is dead.
   Law enforcement agencies use lie detectors to interview
witnesses when investigating crimes.
   The Department of Defense uses polygraph testing to search for
spies, and also to screen job applicants if something suspicious
arises in background checks, said spokesman Jim Turner.
   Reading from a Defense Department statement regarding the use of
polygraphs, Turner said:
   ``In all instances the polygraph exam process produced data of
important security or criminal significance which was not otherwise
obtainable. It was also invaluable in establishing the innocence of
people confronted with serious accusations.''
   Many states allow polygraph evidence to be introduced if both
the prosecution and defense agree.
   New Mexico is the one state where either party can introduce a
polygraph examination as evidence, with the trial judge deciding
whether the tests meet certain standards. But not everyone in the
state supports it.
   Timothy Cornish, a prosecutor in the New Mexico attorney
general's office, called polygraph exams ``witchcraft.''
   ``It can, if used in an unbridled way, change the entire
truth-seeking process,'' he said. ``It replaces the jury.''
   David Raskin, a University of Utah psychologist often called
upon to support polygraphs in the courtroom, said he favored the
federal law because lie detectors were being misused to predict
future performance in the workplace. But he said they are reliable
tools in determining someone's past actions.
   ``Every piece of evidence has a dose of uncertainty,'' Raskin
said. ``Jurors are very cautious with polygraph evidence. They are
overly skeptical. They do not ignore other evidence and concentrate
on the polygraph.''

   Failure of U.S. troops to achieve complete
surprise in their attack in Panama resulted in the disappearance of
substantial forces loyal to ousted leader Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said today.
   Reporting on a three-hour briefing by Pentagon officials, Nunn
and Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said substantial amount of cocaine and
cash were seized in Noriega's personal headquarters in Panama City.
Noriega faces drug-trafficking charges in the United States.
   Nunn and Warner, the chairman and ranking Republican member,
respectively, of the Senate Armed Services Committee, noted that
Noriega last year had been given the opportunity to leave Panama
and go to a country from which he could not be extradited to the
United States.
   ``He was given the opportunity to shove off and go to another
nation and spend his dollars and not come back,'' Warner said.
   Warner said Noriega's refusal of the offer to leave the country
was evidence of irrationality.
   ``His psychology, his neurotic tendencies were beginning to
overcome him and destabilize him to the extent that ... he pushed
those options aside, hunkered down and determined to cross that
line which he had adhered to in the past, of not seeking Americans
as targets of opportunity,'' Warner said.
   The diplomatic initiative came not just from the United States,
but from other countries as well, Warner said.
   Because of that downturn and Noriega's increased
``irrationality'' and attacks against Americans, President Bush
``had every reason to believe violence was going to escalate if he
did not act,'' Nunn said.
   He said an exhaustive search is continuing, but ``we did not
have Noriega pegged down and he is still at large.''
   Nunn said that while there was some surprise in the U.S. attacks
that began at 1 a.m. Wednesday, it was not complete and that at
least two companies of Panamanian troops are entirely unaccounted
for.
   He said some troops and members of Noriega's paramilitary force
known as the Dignity Battalions have dispersed into the
countryside, where he said ``thuggery and violence'' are going on.
He described the forces as ``armed and certainly very dangerous.''
   Nunn said it is obvious that American military police will have
to be used in Panama to stop looting and restore order. ``If that
kind of chaos and looting goes on, I think Americans will be looked
at by the Panamanian people with increased distaste,'' he said.
   Nunn said the administration intends to speed economic aid to
Panama, adding that it is important ``that we get food in there
very quickly.''
   Army Lt. Gen. Tom Kelly, director of operations for the Joint
Chiefs of staff, and other defense officials conducted the
congressional briefing.
   Nunn said the briefing, which lasted more than three hours,
reinforced his earlier view that Bush was fully justified in
ordering the invasion. He cited Noriega's ``increasing
irrationality'' and said more American lives might have been lost
had Bush not acted.
   Nunn was critical, however, of the Reagan administration's
indictment of Noriega on drug charges last year, saying he thought
the move was ill-considered and had led to unnecessary trouble.
   ``Looking at lessons learned, when the Justice Department
indicts someone, they ought to know what they are going to do
next,'' Nunn said. ``I hope the Justice Department will learn a
lesson out of this.''

   Federal investigators are conducting an
international search for assets they say Manuel Antonio Noriega
amassed from drug trafficking, the Justice Department said Friday.
   Financial documents among records seized by U.S. troops in
Noriega's offices at the Panamanian Defense Forces compound may
help authorities trace assets and bank holdings stashed in foreign
countries, said spokesman David Runkel.
   ``We believe there are assets and we are checking records to
determine where those assets are currently located,'' Runkel said.
`Our concern is for assets resulting from illegal drug trading'' by
Noriega, whom Runkel described ``an international thug.''
   ``The Panamanian government would be interested in assets of Mr.
Noriega which resulted from the looting of the public treasury,''
he said, adding the records may contain such evidence.
   ``We have been in contact with foreign governments and financial
institutions as well as people here'' to trace bank accounts and
other holdings, Runkel said.
   So far, two foreign governments, which Runkel would not
identify, are cooperating. If the documents are useful as evidence,
they will be turned over to federal prosecutors, Runkel said.
   Noriega is accused in two separate U.S. federal indictments of
pocketing $10 million in bribes and drug profits he received in
return for allowing Colombian drug lords to use Panama as a base
for smuggling and money laundering.
   Justice Department officials said the U.S. invasion has
eliminated Panama as a base of operations for the Colombian cartels.
   ``The cartel's mobility is obviously narrowed,'' said Frank
Shults, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration. ``The
flexibility they have to move large and vast sums of money has been
restricted.''
   Also seized at the compound was 110 pounds of cocaine with an
estimated street value of $1.25 million, the White House said
Friday.
   Meanwhile, officials familiar with the Noriega case say that if
he is captured, he will use his dealings as a CIA informant to try
to scuttle U.S. drug charges against him. However, sources say that
Justice Department prosecutors are confident that the threatened
exposure of intelligence secrets in open court won't hobble the
cases.
   Prosecutors expect Noriega would try to use the same
``graymail'' tactics successfully employed by lawyers for former
White House aide Oliver L. North and other Iran-Contra defendants,
said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Defense lawyers in the Iran-Contra cases won court rulings
requiring the disclosure of secrets the government was unwilling to
release. That resulted in the dismissal of major Iran-Contra
conspiracy charges against North and others.
   The Justice Department has decided Noriega would be prosecuted
first in Miami on charges of helping Colombia's Medellin drug
cartel smuggle cocaine through this country. He also faces federal
charges in Tampa, Fla., of conspiring to smuggle marijuana through
Panama.
   The secrecy issues surrounding Noriega's case were discussed
last week at a meeting held at the Justice Department by
prosecutors and senior officials in the criminal division.
   One official termed the secrecy problems in Noriega's case
``manageable,'' but quickly conceded that Iran-Contra prosecutor
Lawrence E. Walsh probably took the same view of the North case.
   Before Noriega was indicted in 1988, prosecutors consulted with
the CIA and other intelligence agencies, said one government
source. Those agencies posed no objections to proceeding with the
case.
   The government is prepared to offer evidence to refute an
expected claim by Noriega that his alleged drug activities were
sanctioned by the U.S. government because he was a CIA informant,
the source said.
   Prosecutors will argue that just because Noriega may have been
an informant for the CIA or the DEA he is not immune from criminal
prosecution, the source said.
   If convicted of all the charges, Noriega faces a possible
sentence of 145 years in prison and more than $1.1 million in fines.

   The Army Chief of Staff today handed out
Purple Hearts and other medals to soldiers wounded in Panama,
telling them he and the president are proud of their ``selfless
commitment to the service of this nation.''
   Gen. Carl Vuono arrived at Wilford Hall Medical Center, one of
two large military hospitals here that since Wednesday have
received more than 200 men injured in the Panama invasion, the
largest influx of casualties since the Vietnam War. Twenty soldiers
died in the assault.
   Officials said 112 men remained hospitalized at Wilford and an
additional 89 remained at nearby Brooke Army Medical Center, which
Vuono planned to visit later in the day.
   ``Right before I got on the helicopter down here I got a phone
call from the president of the United States, the
commander-in-chief,'' Vuono told the first soldiers he visited.
``He wanted me to tell you and every other troop down here how
proud he is of each and every one of you for your sacrifice.''
   Vuono first handed out Purple Hearts to Pvt. Christian Robinson,
no hometown available; Pfc. Bobby Miller of Franklin, Pa.; and
Spec. 4 Albert Harris, of Jackson, Miss. All three suffered gunshot
or shrapnel wounds. Reporters were not allowed to accompany Vuono
on the rest of his visit.
   Of the at least 210 servicemen brought here, two were recovered
enough to be released to their units this morning, while an
additional 53 would probably be released later today or Saturday, a
spokesman said. But 18 were described as ``seriously ill.''
   When American servicemen are wounded or burned overseas, they
usually are brought to San Antonio, home to four Air Force bases
and an Army post. Wilford Hall is one of the nation's main military
hospitals, and Brooke is a leading burn unit.
   On Wednesday and Thursday, military authorities said four
transport planes from Panama landed at Kelly Air Force Base
carrying 191 soldiers, along with four men who died en route or
shortly after arrival. A fifth plane, carrying 21 wounded soldiers,
arrived early this morning, bringing the reported total of wounded
brought here to 212.
   This morning, Wilford Hall and Brooke hospitals reported they
had 201 patients, and seven other wounded men had been transferred
to hospitals near their respective bases. Counting the two men
already released, that would bring the total brought here to 210.
There was no immediate explanation of the discrepancy.
   The hospitalized soldiers were in good spirits, doctors said.
   ``It is amazing what they have tolerated and they're doing it
without whimpering,'' said Lt. Col. Robert Solenberger, Brooke's
chief of surgery.
   Solenberger and his counterpart at Wilford Hall said 18 patients
could be considered ``seriously ill.'' But hospital officials had
no exact count this morning on how many were listed in critical or
serious condition.
   Injuries ranged from broken bones to gunshot and shrapnel
wounds, said Lt. Col. Johnny Whitaker, spokesman for Lackland Air
Force Base. The names of the injured, most of them Army personnel,
were not released.
   A reception center for relatives of the wounded was set up at
Fort Sam Houston. Housing was arranged for the families, and
several San Antonio hotels offered free or reduced-price rooms.
   ``This is kind of a way of life for us,'' said Caryl Hill,
executive director of the local United Service Organizations.
   ``The people of San Antonio are a little bit more aware of
military life,'' Ms. Hill said. ``When there's a war, it's not
unusual that we're going to be receiving the wounded.''
   Doctors and nurses worked extra shifts and postponed vacations
to handle the largest influx of casualties they've had since the
Vietnam War, Whitaker said.
   ``There's a lot of tired people. These have been long days.
People seem to be fairly upbeat, holding their own,'' he said.
   Richard and Linda Turner of DeSoto, Texas, were some of the
first parents to arrive. They visited their son, Pvt. Richard
Turner Jr., who suffered a concussion when a bullet grazed his
helmet.
   ``He saw one of his friends killed,'' Mrs. Turner said. ``He
cried quite a bit.''
   Her son's injury failed to shake Mrs. Turner's support for the
invasion, though.
   ``I definitely think that (Noriega) is one of the main runners
of drugs,'' the mother said. ``Because of this awful man, the drugs
are so heavy in our country.''
   Military officials said medical procedures were running
smoothly, the soldiers were in good spirits and many of them may be
cleared to return to their units today.
   ``They're taking it very well. If there's a predominant feeling
that these men have, it's that they wish that they were back there
fighting,'' said Air Force Col. William Burner III, chief of
surgery at Wilford Hall.
   Two soldiers, he said, refused to sit while they were initially
examined for leg and arm injuries. ``They basically stood at
attention while I examined them.''

   Nicolae Ceausescu imposed sacrifice on
all Romanians except his chosen few and established a personality
cult the like of which has not been seen in Eastern Europe since
Josef Stalin.
   His severity earned him the nickname ``Draculescu,'' for Bram
Stoker's bloodthirsty count of Transylvania.
   Absolute power and the cult were his twin props as he pursued
nationalist policies, strayed from the Soviet line in foreign
dealings and ultimately deprived his oppressed people of even
life's basic necessities.
   He invested billions of dollars in a crash industrialization
program and rigidly followed a policy of domestic austerity to pay
off Romania's entire foreign debt of $11 billion.
   Food and energy shortages were pervasive. Despair spread among
the nation's 23 million people as hardships became more severe
through the 1980s, and in the end not even the ubiquitous secret
police or the army could keep them down.
   As his 24 years of autocratic rule ground along, increasing
opposition arose to Ceausescu, the customary star of the daily two
hours of Romanian television, and his crackdowns on dissent grew
harsher.
   About 30,000 coal miners in the Jiu Valley struck in 1977.
   A decade later, in Brasov, at least 10,000 workers demonstrated,
demanding freedom, better living conditions and Ceasuescu's
dismissal. Police arrested hundreds of the protesters and their
leaders disappeared in mysterious circumstances.
   On Dec. 17, his security forces opened fire on thousands of
demonstrators in Timisoara who demanded freedom and a better life,
beginning the chain of events that brought him down. Reports
indicated thousands of unarmed civilians may have been killed in
the Transylvanian city.
   As democratic reform spread through the Soviet bloc, Ceausescu,
71, stuck to rigid Communist orthodoxy.
   ``The triumph of the revolution requires unity, severe
discipline and a spirit of sacrifice,'' he told a Bucharest mass
meeting this year. ``A firm organization is needed, as well as a
tested political leader who knows how to unite and lead the
masses.''
   His ``firm organization'' was the Romanian Communist Party,
which he had turned into a personal instrument since taking over in
1965, and a vast network of security forces.
   He had gradually pushed aside all leaders who opposed his
policies and installed loyalists on the ruling 23-member Politburo.
They included his wife, Elena, who became the second most powerful
person in Romania.
   Ceausescu began building his personality cult in earnest after
1974, when he made himself the first president in Romania's history.
   His pictures and sayings lined the streets of Bucharest and
other cities Bookstores were filled with works attributed to him.
   When he became president in March 1974, an official picture
showed him holding a silver scepter as the symbol of authority. The
propaganda line was the ``golden era'' of Ceausescu, even when the
country that had been known as Europe's breadbasket became one of
its poorest.
   Secret police kept a strict rein on religion and political
expression. Ceausescu said Warsaw Pact allies that pursued reform
were abandoning communism, and Romania became isolated in the East
as well as the West.
   The United States and other Western powers originally had
encouraged Ceausescu's relatively independent stand within the
Soviet bloc. Two U.S. presidents visited Bucharest: Richard M.
Nixon in 1969 and Gerald R. Ford in 1975.
   Britain made him an honorary knight and Norway gave Ceausescu
and his wife the honorary Grand Cross of St. Olav. The awards were
withdrawn Friday.
   Ceausescu continued diplomatic relations with Israel when the
rest of the Soviet bloc broke them in in 1967. He denounced the
Soviet-led invasion that crushed Czecholsovakia's reforms of 1968.
   His was the only East bloc country to send athletes to the 1984
Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, breaking the Soviet boycott.
   He also looked to the West commercially and the United States
was for a time Romania's biggest Western trade partner, largely
because it granted Most Favored Nation trading status.
   Criticism of Ceausescu's human rights abuses grew, however, and
relations with the West deteriorated.
   At home, Ceausescu exhorted Romanians to work hard, and imposed
a six-day work week on nearly everybody despite shortages of food,
medicine and heat in winter.
   ``He was worse than Hitler, who, for all his crimes, at least
sincerely wished the welfare of Germany,'' said Mircea Stoica, a
law professor at Bucharest University who fled to Hungary.
``Ceausescu hates his people, and his wife Elena has often referred
to Romanians as `worms.'''
   He also took care of his family. Mrs. Ceausescu was vice premier
and their son, Nicu, was a regional party chief. Valentin, an
adopted son; Zoia-Elena, their daughter; and Ceausescu brothers
Marin, Ilie, Ion and Nicolae Andruta were given important jobs, as
were several in-laws.
   Romanian and Western sources say about 40 relatives were in the
party and government state hierarchy.
   Ceausescu was born Jan. 26, 1918, in Scornicesti, the third son
of a large peasant family. He did not finish elementary school and
was apprenticed as a shoemaker.
   He later worked in a factory and joined the illegal Communist
party youth organization at age 15, becoming a full party member
three years later in 1936.
   Communist activities landed Ceausescu in jail several times
before and during World War II. He became a protege of Communist
Party chief Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, rose quickly through the ranks
and succeeded to the party leadership after Gheorghiu-Dej's death.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of people surged through
two new Berlin Wall openings Friday and celebrated at the
Brandenburg Gate, a monument to German unity that became a symbol
of division when the wall went up in 1961.
   The new passages, immediately north and south of the towering
gate, were opened at 3 p.m. in a ceremony attended by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl of West Germany and the East German premier, Hans
Modrow.
   Berliners rushed through them, back and forth, then uncorked of
champagne and drank to the famous landmark that was sealed inside
East Berlin for 28 years.
   Security on both sides collapsed as the vast crowd broke through
metal barriers and rushed to the gate, filling the vast Paris
Square, where people hugged each other and danced together.
   A sea of people who had waited patiently for hours in
intermittent rain surrounded the 200-year-old sandstone monument.
   West Berlin police said about 30,000 people gathered on the
Western side before the gate was opened. The crowd on the Eastern
side appeared much larger, but there were no official estimates of
its size.
   More than 20 crossings have been cut through the wall since East
Germany opened its borders Nov. 9, but the freeing of the
Brandenburg Gate was the emotional climax of the coming together of
a people divided since the end of World War II.
   In addition to being cut off from West Berliners, the gate also
was inaccessible to East Berliners until Friday because it lay in
the off-limits East German border zone.
   Flags of Berlin, West Germany and East Germany flew above the
huge crowd. Several people who climbed the wall held up a sign
saying ``Come Together.''
   Hundreds of people climbed atop the thick section of wall that
remains directly in front of the gate, dancing and hugging in
chaotic scenes reminiscent of November.
   Kohl called the opening of the gate a ``fantastic thing.''
   He and Modrow met at 3 p.m. on the border, shook hands and
walked together to a platform to address the crowd. They were
nearly mobbed by the exultant crowd.
   National television of both countries broadcast the event.
``This is where the heart of Berlin pounds,'' said a commentator
for the ZDF network of West Germany.
   Modrow said the historic Brandenburg Gate's new function should
be ``to serve the peace.''
   The speeches were drowned out by the mass of people, many with
tears in their eyes, shouting with joy.
   Peter Rebachmann, a 42-year-old East Berliner, said: ``The last
time I was here was as a kid, when I used to play on this very
spot. I never thought I'd come here again; it's really wonderful.''
   ``It's great, but it's too bad my father didn't live to see
it,'' said Hans Achtzehnig, another resident of East Berlin.
   ``What a beautiful Christmas present!'' said a middle-aged woman
who did not give her name.
   Several signs carried by the crowd called for German unity, a
demand made by a growing number of participants in East German
demonstrations.
   ``Berlin, One city, One Nation,'' said one sign.
   People on the eastern side of the wall greeted Kohl with shouts
of ``Helmut! Helmut!'' He and Modrow announced the agreement to
open the gate during a visit Kohl made to East Germany on Tuesday
and Wednesday.
   Thousands of people cheered and set off firecrackers earlier
when East German workers began knocking the new holes in the wall.
   The Brandenburg Gate, its battle-scarred columns are topped with
a bronze chariot of the goddess Victory in a chariot, was the
backdrop for Adolf Hitler's rise to power and his last stand. It
also was where East German workers began an uprising in 1953 that
was crushed by Soviet tanks.
   In East Berlin, the Unter den Linden boulevard ends at the gate.
On the Western side, the avenue that leads to the gate was renamed
June 17, for the date of the uprising.
   Nazi ``brown shirts'' made a triumphant torchlit parade through
the gate when Hitler was named chancellor on Jan. 30, 1933.
   In the final days of World War II, the six-column gate, five
stories high, was badly damaged when Soviet tanks closed in on
Hitler's bunker in the chancellery. It marked the border between
the Soviet and British sectors when the victorious allies divided
Berlin into four sectors.

   U.S. helicopters rescued an 11-member
Smithsonian Institution research team Friday morning from a jungle
where they had been taken by troops loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   The group, including a 4-year-old girl, was taken from an island
laboratory and put on a forced march into the jungle by 30 infantry
soldiers who then abandoned them without food or shoes.
   ``The worst part was walking down the main landing strip off to
the side and into the woods. Everybody thought they were going to
shoot us,'' said Steve Travers, a marine biologist with the
Smithsonian group.
   Nancy Knowlton, another scientist, said the group expected
trouble because of the U.S. invasion when it saw a Panamanian
patrol boat heading for the laboratory Wednesday morning.
   The research team talked the soldiers into letting them grab a
few belongings before they were hurriedly taken ashore. They
managed to sneak out three two-way radios with which they would
later guide U.S. armed forces to their location for rescue.
   Greg Summers, another member of the group, said they were taken
by boat to the airfield and then into the jungle. They walked from
11 a.m. Wednesday until 1 a.m. Thursday, he said.
   ``We really didn't know we were going to be walking halfway
across Panama,'' Knowlton said. At one point it appeared to the
hostages that their captors feared that they themselves were
isolated when word reached them that Americans were in control of
Panama City. They asked their captives to tell the American troops
that the researchers had been taken into protective custody. Then
the group was abandoned on Thursday.
   Using the radios they had hidden, the group contacted
Smithsonian officials in Panama City.
   Lt. Col. Joseph Umbarger, who coordinated the rescue, said at
first the U.S. military thought the situation might be a potential
trap, but then sent three helicopters on a dangerous nighttime
search over the jungle about 20 to 25 miles north of Panama City.
Although the pilots scoured the area for hours, the initial aerial
search team was forced to return without the hostages when their
fuel ran low.
   The group received help from a school teacher who, on Friday
morning, started taking them in a flatbed truck to the town of
Chepo. A second flight of helicopters which took off at dawn from
Fort Clayton spotted them in transit, when they jumped off the
truck and waved their clothing in a pre-arranged pattern to tip off
the soldiers.
   ``That was a fantastic moment, seeing the helicopters come,''
said Travers.

<HEAD>Official Says Westinghouse May Appeal Bonus Payment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. is considering
appealing for an increase in the $3.9 million bonus it won for
running the Savannah River nuclear weapons plant despite safety
lapses such as workers sleeping on the job, an Energy Department
official said Friday.
   Westinghouse officials at the South Carolina plant, however,
said there were no plans to appeal.
   Stephen A. Wakefield, the department's general counsel, said
Westinghouse President Paul E. Lego told Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins in a meeting earlier this week that the company was
considering contesting the amount of the award.
   ``I know they're considering it,'' Wakefield said in an
interview in his office, adding that Lego gave no indication that a
firm decision had been made.
   At the Savannah River plant, near Aiken, S.C., Westinghouse
spokesman Jack Herman said James Moore, president of the
Westinghouse subsidiary that operates the facility, told him
Friday, ``There's no intention to appeal.''
   ``We view this as a fait accompli,'' Herman said in reference to
the department's decision announced earlier this week to give the
company $3.9 million out of a maximum possible award fee of $7.5
million for its first six months as operator.
   Wakefield said Westinghouse was unhappy that it had been docked
so heavily for not meeting the Energy Department's expectations for
improving the plant's performance.
   Westinghouse, which runs all or parts of five other Energy
Department weapons plants, took over from E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp;
Co. at Savannah River last April amid rising public criticism of
environmental, health and safety problems in the weapons complex.
   Savannah River's three nuclear reactors, which are the nation's
only source of tritium needed to make nuclear warheads, have been
closed down for more than a year for safety reasons. Westinghouse
has been conducting a massive overhaul of the plant in preparation
for restarting the reactors next year.
   In a letter Dec. 13, P.W. Kaspar, DOE's manager of the Savannah
River operations office, told Moore that although Westinghouse had
made some important improvements, its overall approach to
instilling more discipline in plant operations was too narrow and
not yet effective.
   Kaspar said the company had not adequately reacted to
``anomalies throughout the site.'' Among the anomalies cited were
employees found asleep when they were supposed to have been
monitoring the testing of cooling pipes at one of the reactors.
   Westinghouse said unspecified disciplinary action was taken
against the two workers found asleep. They were not fired.
   Another problem cited by Kaspar was that Westinghouse employees
had intentionally disabled alarms meant to detect excessive
radiation. The company said two employees recently were fired for
tampering with alarms, one in a reactor area.
   Wakefield said Westinghouse's displeasure with the amount of its
bonus payment did not indicate that the contract relationship was
deteriorating. He said Savannah River operations had improved
greatly since Westinghouse took over last April, and that no one
was aware then of how bad the problems there were.
   ``Westinghouse found a much more difficult situation there than
they expected or than we expected,'' said Wakefield. ``Du Pont had
really let the place run down.''

   American military leaders today called on
Panamanian police to join with them in restoring order in the
beleagured country, urging officers once loyal to Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega to return to work for the new government.
   Lt. Gen. Tom Kelly said he hoped local police would work side by
side with U.S. military police. ``The primary endeavor of the
movement is to clear Panama City and assist the government in
restoring law and order,'' he said.
   Kelly, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
spoke at a Pentagon briefing at which he also said it might take
five to 10 days for the U.S. troops to restore aide and raised the
possibility that even more American troops might be sent to Panama.
   The comments by Kelly and others suggested that what U.S.
officials repeatedly have referred to as a ``mopping up'' operation
was far from over.
   In an interview Thursday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the
Bush administration intends to maintain a signficant military
presence in Panama to restore a ``condition of normalcy,'' even if
some U.S. troops are withdrawn relatively quickly after this week's
massive strike.
   Cheney said U.S. troops in Panama City were ``not trying to hold
every street corner. ... We're moving to areas where there
continues to be resistance or where there is a need for presence.
   ``We're not attempting to occupy the entire city because we
don't have that many troops down there,'' he said.
   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
the principal goal for the U.S. military forces ``is to restore a
semblance of civic order. I still think we're in the mopping-up
phase with respect to resistance'' from forces loyal to deposed
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega, he said.
   Cheney acknowledged that U.S. troops were still involved in
``conflict and firefights'' in Panama City well into the second day
of the American intervention.
   As of this morning, the U.S. military casualty count stood at 20
killed in action, 202 wounded and two missing. In addition, two
civilian American women were reported killed. The Pentagon said 122
members of the Panamanian Defense Forces were killed and 45 were
wounded.
   Cheney said the operation was ``enormously successful'' during
its first 36 hours, even though Noriega had eluded capture. Both
the defense secretary and Powell appeared somewhat weary but spent
more than 30 minutes answering reporters' questions.
   President Bush said U.S. troops would pursue Noriega ``as long
as it takes'' and said the nation's commitment to the operation in
Panama was ``open-ended.''
   Neither the secretary nor the four-star general would provide
any details of the manhunt for Noriega, except to say they believed
he still was in Panama. U.S. officials have offered a $1 million
bounty for the deposed leader.
   Powell said that while there still appeared to be resistance by
Noriega loyalists in Panama City ``for the most part it is
disorganized resistance ... it will dry up over time.'' The
four-star general said he did not believe the resistance was
``under the direction of a central command.''
   The defense secretary pledged to get U.S. forces in Panama home
``as quickly as we can,'' but he also said the date would stay open
as long as Noriega remained at large and civil unrest continued.
   The secretary said that over time, as the government of
Guillermo Endara demonstrates it ``is there to stay ... all the
violence will cease ... and we'll get back to a condition of
normalcy.''
   The secretary noted that the 9,500 military personnel sent into
Panama was a supplemental force to the 13,000 who are permanently
based there.
   ``When we went in, we did not know precisely how long we would
have to stay and we still don't know that,'' Cheney said, noting
that the U.S. military has a right to be in the country under the
Panama Canal treaties.
   ``So even after we bring out those forces that were sent in ...
there will still be a significant military presence in Panama,'' he
said.
   Cheney acknowledged the possibility of individual terrorist
strikes and the taking of U.S. hostages.
   ``Clearly, we haven't resolved all the potential situations
where there may be Americans being held,'' Cheney said. ``We are
aggressively working every one of those cases.''
   Both men argued that nabbing Noriega was not the primary
objective of the mission _ the nation's largest military endeavor
since the Vietnam War.
   ``Our purpose was not to snatch Noriega. Our purpose was to
safeguard American lives, safeguard American interests under the
(Panama Canal) treaty, help restore democracy in Panama,'' Cheney
said, adding, ``We'd love to get Mr. Noriega. We're going to
continue to work on that and we may in fact be able to do that,
too.''

   One exiled Romanian dissident said Friday that
Nicolae Ceausescu had ``lost touch with reality,'' while another
said he was ready to return to help shape his country's future.
   ``I am ready to assume my responsibility and to save my
people,'' Mihai Botez said in an interview from New York City.
   Botez, a mathematician and economic planner exiled by Ceausescu
in 1987, said all political scenarios are open for Romania's
future, but one model is ``over, and that's Stalinism.
   A former economic adviser to the Romanian government before he
fell out of favor 10 years before his exile, Botez said he would
like to see the country develop a strong private sector, ``although
some socialist, nationalized enterprises will remain at first.''
   Vladimir Tismaneanu, a resident scholar at the Foreign Policy
Research Institute in Philadelphia, said that when Ceausescu
ordered troops to fire on anti-government protesters last week, it
was ``a clear indication that Ceausescu had completely lost touch
with reality.''
   Ceausescu's cult of personality and ``megalomania'' during his
24-year reign were compounded by his wife Elena's
``idiosyncracies,'' Tismaneanu said.
   Corneliu Manescu, the 73-year-old former foreign minister who
assumed leadership of a provisional government in Romania after
Ceausescu fled, is ill and will probably only serve as a
transitional leader until free elections are held, Tismaneanu said.
   But Ion Iliescu, a former Central Committee secretary ousted by
Ceausescu in 1971, would likely play a major role in the new order
in Romania, he said.
   Iliescu, who announced Friday that a ``National Salvation
Front'' had been set up to rule the country, was a classmate of
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at Moscow State University in the
1950s, Tismaneanu said.
   Botez, who has been a guest scholar at several U.S. think tanks
and universities since his departure from Romania was achieved with
the help of the State Department, says he has not been able to
contact his wife since he left Romania.
   His wife, also a prominent dissident, has been under house
arrest, as he was for several months before leaving Romania.
   The first priority, Botez said, is to supply food and clothing
to Romanians ``and stop the desperate suffering.''
   The foreign ministers of the European Community pledged
immediate aid to Romania on Friday and the International Committee
for the Red Cross dispatched two planes carrying 4 tons of medical
supplies to Bucharest.

<HEAD>Daytona Beach Wants to Tone Down Spring Break</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Daytona Beach has established a
spring break task force to prevent a repeat of destruction and
chaos caused last March by an estimated 400,000 revelers.
   ``Spring break in 1989 was totally out of control,'' Mayor Larry
Kelly told the Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale. ``Frankly, there
was an attitude by certain businesses and public officials to let
it all hang loose. And I think it was a serious mistake.''
   Daytona Beach's problem sounded familiar to officials down the
coast in Fort Lauderdale. They had told the spring break crowd
three years ago it was no longer welcome in Fort Lauderdale.
   Daytona Beach began a campaign to lure the young vacationers to
their city. But now, the task force will study how it might follow
Fort Lauderdale's lead to tone down the partying.
   Last March, Daytona Beach private and public property was
destroyed and visitors urinated in back yards, brawled in the
streets and more. The experience prompted the establishment of the
Spring Break Festival Task Force.
   ``The accent is on that third word because that's what we're
trying to make it _ a festival instead of a free-for-all,'' said
Suzanne Smith, director of special events for the Daytona Beach
Chamber of Commerce.
   Fort Lauderdale Mayor Bob Cox once told Kelly on network
television that he'd be only too glad to let Daytona Beach become
the new mecca for spring break.
   ``He turned to me and said, `You can have them,''' the Daytona
Beach mayor recalled. ``And I got them.''
   City officials and business leaders in Daytona Beach eager to
boost local revenues mounted expensive advertising campaigns
touting their sandy shores to vacation-hungry college students no
longer wanted in Fort Lauderdale.
   Cox said he would gladly share tips with Daytona Beach officials
on Fort Lauderdale's successful steps to shed its decades-old
party-time image.
   He said two important measures include cracking down on alcohol
on the beach and erecting walls along the Strip to separate
pedestrians from motorists.

   Fighters loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega attacked Quarry Heights, site of the U.S. military's
Southern Command today. Assailants tried to assassinate the
U.S.-installed vice president, Ricardo Arias Calderon.
   Members of pro-Noriega Dignity Battalions opened fire on Arias'
car shortly after he left the National Assembly building, according
to Arias aide Teni de Obaldia.
   De Obaldia, reached at Arias' home by telephone, said Arias
wasn't injured but that two of his aides were wounded. He said
Arias was with the wounded aides at Gorgas Hospital, a U.S.
military hospital near Southern Command headquarters.
   Arias was installed as first vice president shortly after the
U.S. attack on Panama began at midnight Tuesday. He was declared a
winner in elections in May that Noriega, the military dictator,
declared null.
   Fighting was heavy for about an hour around the Southern Command
center, which controls all U.S. forces in South and Central America.
   Mortars were launched from railroad tracks below Southern
Command headquarters at Quarry Heights, overlooking Panama City, at
about 11:25 a.m. Snipers were reported in the hills above, and the
sound of helicopters and machine-gun fire could be heard overhead.
   U.S. military officials and journalists took cover under tables
as the building they were in shook.
   Witnesses in the area said the target of the attack appeared to
be two U.S.-occupied Panamanian government buildings below Quarry
Heights. About a dozen pro-Noriega men attacked U.S. soldiers at
the secret police headquarters and the building that houses
Panama's transportation department, the witnesses said by telephone.
   By 12:30, fighting had died down.
   Elsewhere, the Panamanian Defense Forces barracks in the western
city of David, 200 miles west of Panama City, raised white flags
and surrendered this morning, residents of that city said by
telephone.
   U.S. troops battled stubborn bands of Panamanian fighters in the
chaotic capital, where fighting intensified late Thursday as U.S.
warplanes bombed enemy positions.
   On the third day of what was originally planned as a three-day
operation, President Bush told Congress he could not predict how
long it would last. U.S. military commander Jim Snell said it could
take months to clear the capital of Noriega loyalists and weapons.
   But this morning, some remaining pockets of resistance appeared
resigned to defeat.
   ``It's clear that the gringos are in control of everything. We
don't have the strength they have. We don't have any guidelines. We
don't know where Noriega, our commander, is,'' said a pro-Noriega
municipal official at the Tinajitas barracks in the northeastern
neighborhood of San Miguelito.
   The official, who refused to give his name, said supporters of
the elusive Noriega had run out of munitions and could provide no
resistance when U.S. troops rumbled into the neighborhood Thursday
night.
   Panamanian forces who had controlled several posts along the
Costa Rican border in the province of Chiriqui fled today after
rumors spread that U.S. troops were on their way, said Juan
Barrantes, a Costa Rican border official.
   In Washington, the Organization of American States this morning
``deeply deplored'' the invasion, which has killed 22 Americans,
and called for withdrawal of U.S. forces. The resolution was
approved on a 20-to-1 vote with the United States voting against it
and six members abstaining.
   Three Americans were missing, and Noriega's whereabouts was a
mystery. U.S. soldiers were too busy with snipers, and
house-to-house searches to challenge looters who had helped
themselves to everything from designer underwear to gleaming BMWs.
   ``There are pockets of stiff resistance in the city,'' U.S.
Embassy spokeswoman Jan Edmonson said today by telephone. ``And
also there's just the great element of fear. These people are going
through parts of the city in just mobs, breaking windows, entering
private homes, looting at will.''
   The newly installed U.S.-backed president, Guillermo Endara,
admitted in an interview on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' today
that he cannot safely walk the streets but claimed he had the
``wholehearted support'' of the people.
   ``We would need twice as many soldiers if we were to take over
every small garrison in this country,'' a U.S. Army officer said,
on condition of anonymity.
   Spurred by a $1 million bounty offered by President Bush for
Noriega's arrest, Panamanians reported sightings of the general
throughout the capital.
   There were rumors he was holding out at the Tinajitas garrison,
in northeastern Panama City. One Israeli television report said the
general was spotted on the resort island of Contadora, 40 miles off
the Pacific coast. It said he was preparing to escape to Nicaragua.
   U.S. soldiers who stormed the ``Witch House'' on Wednesday, one
of Noriega's residences, found cigarettes smoldering and believe
they missed the Panamanian fugitive by minutes, military sources
say.
   The Witch House was filled with black magic paraphernalia, and
another of the ousted dictator's quarters was decorated with
portraits of Adolf Hitler, American servicemen told reporters
Thursday.
   There was no word on the whereabouts of most of the members of
Noriega's general staff, although a U.S. Army source confirmed that
Noriega's brother-in-law, Lt. Col. Aquilino Sieiro, had surrendered.
   The U.S. Army announced it had 1,500 prisoners of war, mostly
members of the Panamanian Defense Forces.
   Bush pledged Thursday that U.S. forces would scour Panama ``as
long as it takes'' to capture Noriega, who was indicted in the
United States in 1988 on federal charges of trafficking in
Colombian cocaine and money laundering.
   In a message today to Congress, Bush said: ``Although most
organized opposition has ceased, it is not possible at this time to
predict the precise scope and duration of the military operations
or how long the temporary increases of U.S. forces in Panama will
be required.''
   Bush said he had sent 11,000 U.S. troops to back up the 13,000
already here. U.S. officials previously said they hoped the action
could be completed in three days.
   Pentagon officials today reported 22 Americans killed, including
two civilian women, 202 wounded and two military men missing. It
said 122 Panamanians were killed and 45 wounded.
   CBS news producer Jon Meyersohn, abducted by Panamanian gunmen
from the Marriott lobby Wednesday, also was missing today.
   An official in the office of Leonardo Diaz, medical director of
the Santo Tomas Hospital, said the hospital had taken in 80 dead
and more than 1,000 wounded.
   ``The morgue is now full. We have no place to put the dead,''
the official said, refusing to give her name.
   The dead included a Spanish photographer caught in cross fire
between U.S. troops who mistook each other for Panamanian forces in
the Marriott Hotel parking lot.
   Looters had a field day Thursday, sacking vendors of everything
despite a curfew ordered by Endara, sworn in by a Panamanian judge
minutes before the invasion began at midnight Tuesday.
   Endara and Arias were declared winners in presidential elections
in May, but Noriega nullified the results.

   Radical students and police fought
with firebombs and tear gas Friday when the students tried to march
against the U.S. invasion of Panama and the presence of American
troops in South Korea.
   Students in Seoul and four other cities also demanded the
release of a jailed leader authorities believe sympathizes with
Communist North Korea.
   Police estimated the total number of protesters Friday
throughout the country was 1,800. They reported some arrests, but
did not give figures.
   About 250 students shouting ``Yankee go home!'' and ``Drive out
the Yankees who invaded Panama!'' fought riot police who blocked
them from marching off the Dongkuk University campus after a rally
against the government and United States.
   The students denounced the U.S. invasion of Panama as ``an
imperialistic show of military force.''
   Police fired tear gas to keep the Dongkuk students from marching
into the streets. There were no reports of arrests or injuries in
the 90-minute confrontation.
   The Dongkuk students shouted slogans demanding immediate
withdrawal of U.S. troops from Panama and South Korea. About 43,000
American soldiers are stationed in South Korea under a 1954 mutual
defense treaty.
   Police raided the Dongkuk campus before dawn Friday and seized
30 radical students accused of pro-North Korean activities.
   Clashes also took place near a downtown market in Seoul when
hundreds of students from several colleges occupied a section of an
eight-lane street. Police firing tear gas dispersed the students,
who threw hundreds of firebombs.
   Riot police firing barrages of tear gas moved into several
campuses in the southern cities of Kwangju, Taegu, Pusan and Taejon
to crush violent protests demanding the release of radical leader
Im Chong-suk.
   Im, 23, leads a radical group called the National Council of
Student Representatives and police had sought him for six months in
connection with previous violent demonstrations.
   He also is accused of sending a woman radical student leader, Im
Su-kyong, to a world youth festival in North Korea in July without
government approval. The two Ims are unrelated.
   South Korean citizens are not allowed to visit the North without
official permission.
   Three leaders of the largest dissident group, the United
National Democratic Movement, delivered a letter denouncing the
U.S. military action in Panama to the U.S. Embassy on Friday. The
embassy said it would have no comment.
   Korean radicals are a vocal minority in the nation of 42
million, but have little public support because of their extreme
views and actions.

   The Organization of American States, in a rare
move, closed ranks formally against the United States on Friday for
invading Panama. A State Department spokesman said: ``We are
outraged.''
   A pre-dawn OAS vote followed a marathon emergency session that
began Wednesday hours after thousands of U.S. troops assaulted
Panama and attempted to capture dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   OAS members cast aside Nicaraguan and Panamanian calls for
condemnation, approving instead a resolution ``to deeply regret the
military intervention in Panama'' and call for the withdrawal of
troops used in the U.S. action. It did not specify a timetable.
   The written resolution was considerably milder than the oral
debates in which even staunch U.S. allies spoke out against the
invasion. But it was the first time since the so-called tuna wars
along South America's Pacific coast in early 1970s that the OAS
issued such a strong document against an American action.
   The United States, however, said it opposed any type of rebuff.
   ``We are outraged,'' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
said. ``It is unacceptable.''
   A prepared State Department statement said: ``We are
disappointed that the OAS missed an historic opportunity to get
beyond its traditional narrow concern over nonintervention. The
resolution is unbalanced. It does not cite the root problem _
Noriega. It also fails to recognize the threat to Americans in
Noriega's `state of war' declaration, our Panama Canal Treaty
rights and our sovereign right to self-defense.''
   The State Department statement noted that the language of the
resolution was to ``regret'' rather than condemn. The Spanish
version of the resolution, however, translates closer to ``deeply
deplore.''
   ``That's how they sold it to the Caribbean nations,'' said a
State Department official who asked not to be identified.
   Shastri Ali, the No. 2 at the Trinidad and Tobago Embassy, said
Friday: ``What we voted in favor of was to deeply regret. It seems
we agreed to different things.''
   John Maisto, the U.S. deputy permanent representative to the
OAS, earlier called the final resolution ``a mixed bag. ... We're a
little disappointed. It certainly wasn't an extreme resolution, but
it's a little detached from what is really happening in Panama.''
   The OAS approved the resolution on a 20-1 vote. Abstentions came
from El Salvador, Honduras, Venezuela, Antigua and Barbuda, Costa
Rica and Guatemala.
   The resolution noted ``the serious events (in Panama),
especially the armed clashes resulting from the military
intervention by the United States and the deplorable loss of lives
and property.''
   The State Department statement said ``part of the explanation''
for the resolution was ``that the rightful representative of the
new Panamanian government was not at the meeting.''
   The OAS members rebuffed a request by Panama's newly installed
President Guillermo Endara to seat his appointed representative.
Noriega loyalist, Jose Maria Cabrera, spoke out repeatedly against
the ``criminal abuse'' by the United States.
   U.S. Ambassador Luigi Einaudi cast the only negative vote on the
motion outlined by Peru, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Uruguay and
Argentina.
   He failed on an 11-4 vote with two abstentions to add to the
resolution a mention that the OAS charter itself allows each nation
the right of self-defense.
   Einaudi said that once Noriega declared a state of war against
the United States, U.S. officials ``clearly have the legitimate
right of self-defense.''
   The ambassador also said the United States has tried to work out
a peacefully solution of the Panamanian situation through the OAS
but ``it is impossible to reason with a dictator. At the end,
Noriega has got what he deserved.''
   A U.S. attempt to label the invasion a ``military action''
failed with only three votes among the 26 delegates who attended
the 17-hour debate and negotiation. Only Honduras and Costa Rica
supported the United States.

   Thousands of refugees on Friday
jammed soccer stadiums, churches and schools to seek shelter from
the fighting that has left the capital with a mounting shortage of
food and medicines.
   Reporters estimated around 3,000 refugees at a high school
soccer stadium in the neighboring city of Balboa, on the Pacific
entrance of the Panama Canal.
   ``They had water but we're very short of food,'' said a Red
Cross worker who like others refused to give his name for fear of
reprisals. He said U.S. Army units were providing some rations, but
it was not enough.
   Another 500 were at the Revolution Soccer Stadium in Panama
City, 200 at the capital's Venezuela high school, 100 at another
school and 100 more at the Santa Ana Roman Catholic Church.
   Untold thousands more roamed the streets, slept in public parks
or were taken in by relatives and friends. Many just knocked on
doors of strangers who took them in.
   Three families were living in a one family home in the Chorillo
neighborhood _ none had known each other before.
   ``I'm still very scared,'' said one man in a telephone interview
from his invalid mother's two-room apartment, where a total of 15
people were herded.
   ``First I fled to a stranger's home. But then I had to leave,
and I made my way through the fighting until I was able to reach my
mother's house.''
   A Red Cross spokesman said many people were donating food to the
refugees _ ``as much as they can spare.'' He said the organization
has been appealing for help.
   Looting remained rampant for the third consecutive day; there
were no policemen, not even to direct traffic.
   The police were part of fugitive strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega's Defense Forces and the organization collapsed with the
U.S. military invasion Wednesday.
   Most stores remained closed. About 300 people lined up outside
supermarkets that opened their doors, and many complained there was
little left to buy.
   Even some gas stations that didn't open for business were looted
by motorists short of gasoline.
   First Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon, who is also
temporarily the interior minister, on Friday named anti-Noriega
Majs. Ricardo Reyes Dutary and Juan Antonio Guisado to organize a
traffic and police force.
   Santo Tomas Hospital, one of the capital's biggest, on Balboa
Avenue overlooking Panama Bay, was crowded with dead and wounded
and running short of almost everything, from alcohol to analgesics
and surgical gauze.
   Dr. Elmer Miranda, the deputy director, said there were about
200 dead bodies in the basement and he heard from a colleague of
about 60 more in Gorgas Hospital, run by the U.S. Southern Command.
   Among the bodies was that of Spanish photographer Juan
Rodriguez, who was killed by U.S. troops near the Marriott Hotel,
and a Peruvian military attache, officials said.
   Miranda said the hospital's 21 wards were so full that some of
the less-seriously wounded were sleeping on the floors.
   All 21 wards of the hospital were full, and one official
estimated there were 1,000 wounded in the hospital. They said that
while many of Noriega's troops wear civilian clothes, they believed
most of the victims they had seen were civilians.
   They said most of the injuries were caused by flying glass and
bullets.
   U.S. troops visited the hospital during the morning, saying they
were ``just checking,'' according to two nurses.
   Doctors and nurses were working on 16 and even 24-hour shifts,
and the hospital was very short of food. ``They are all very tense.
Besides everything, not only is there no transportation but the
staff is scared to go outside,'' he added.

   President Bush hugged a group of children with
AIDS, assuring one youngster that a cure will be found, and then
handed out Christmas candy during a tour of AIDS wards Friday at
the National Institutes of Health.
   ``I hope they find a cure for AIDS,'' Brett Lykins, a 9-year-old
who suffers from the disease, told Bush as the president and Mrs.
Bush sat in a circle with six young AIDS patients.
   ``I'll bet it happens,'' Bush said.
   Both the president and his wife wished each child a merry
Christmas, and twice Bush embraced a youngster in a grandfatherly
hug. Mrs. Bush also held several of the children.
   ``Has there been a change toward a more compassionate view
(toward AIDS) in the communities?'' Bush asked at one point.
   Vonzella Johnson, sitting beside the president and holding her
2-year-old daughter, said that she hadn't experienced that
compassion in her hometown of Painesville, Ohio.
   She said she's received little help or support at home.
   ``I'm going to move because I have other kids,'' she said.
   Mrs. Johnson said that both she and her daughter, Mary
Catherine, ``are infected'' and that the NIH clinics offered their
only hope.
   ``This place is a blessing,'' she said.
   Kevin Charles Porter, an 11-year-old from Jacksonville, Fla.,
said he had been on a new AIDS drug, called DDI, for four months.
   ``How do you feel?'' the president asked. ``Like when you wake
up in the morning. Or does it just depend?''
   The boy ducked his head and his father, Charles Porter, spoke up.
   ``Our son has shown great improvement,'' he said. ``What we'd
like is a strong committment from you to help, not just these kids,
but lots of kids with AIDS everywhere.''
   ``We certainly want to do that,'' Bush said. ``Good luck to
you.''
   The children presented the Bushes with sweatshirts decorated
with a drawing of a rising sun.
   Dr. Phil Pizzo, who is in charge of the pediatric clinic, said
the drawing was by a child who had died of AIDS.
   ``We offer it in his memory,'' Pizzo said.
   Bush took a gold-wrapped package from an aide and said it could
be opened after he left. Then he changed his mind and removed the
wrapping to reveal a sealed box of candy.
   He started to open the box, but Mrs. Bush, shaking her head,
spoke up.
   ``I don't think the doctors will like that,'' she said.
``George, this is very dangerous.''
   The president opened the box, anyway, and then grinned like a
happy Santa as he handed the children small white boxes, each
printed with an American flag and the presidential seal. The small
boxes were filled with M&amp;M candies.
   Bush and his party earlier visited a ward of adult AIDS patients.
   Later, during a brief speech in a packed auditorium, Bush told
NIH doctors, nurses and other AIDS workers that ``only together can
we wage an all-out war against this terrible killer.''
   He praised the health-care workers and said, ``I am with you and
extraordinarily grateful for what you are doing.''
   Bush called for ``educating Americans who don't want to help,
don't want to become involved because of a misplaced fear.''
   ``They're afraid of holding an AIDS patient because they're
frightened of getting AIDS,'' he said. ``Barbara and I want to say,
and we hope we can continue to demonstrate this, they are wrong.
They're simply uninformed. They are wrong about that.''
   Bush, Mrs. Bush, Health and Human Services secretary Louis
Sullivan and his wife, along with George Bush Jr., flew by
helicopter to Bethesda Naval Hospital and were taken across a
street by motorcade for the 90-minute visit to NIH.
   Just before the presidential party arrived, a military unit of
about 30 men in camouflage combat uniforms deployed around the
helipad, spacing themselves in a protective formation facing a
wooded area, a parking lot and the street.
   They remained there in the bitter cold until the president's
helicopter lifted off, taking the presidential party toward Camp
David, Md., where Bush will spend Christmas.

   Folks in the Midwest and East got more snow
and cold than they wanted, but at least it was free. In sunny
Southern California, residents can buy artificial snow for their
yard, but it sets 'em back $100 a ton plus labor and delivery
charges.
   Maurice Gonzalez, 32, of suburban Canoga Park was one of more
than two dozen customers who paid an ice company to pretend they
were having a white Christmas for a couple of days this season. His
5-inch ``snowfall,'' really pulverized ice, was put down Wednesday.
   ``We had a lot of people stopping by with kids,'' Gonzalez said
Thursday. ``They play with it, grab a little bit to show their
parents. It's fun just watching them.'' With daytime temperatures
around 70, the snow was down to a few patches by late Thursday.
   Gonzales said the fun factor made it worth the cost, which came
out to about $100 per inch on his size yard. The family also has
put up such decorations as a Santa Claus with reindeer, a Nativity
scene and figures of a boy and girl sledding.
   ``I didn't really plan to do all this, this year _ it just kind
of happens,'' Gonzalez said. ``If you have kids, you just start
doing things and you get in the spirit of Christmas.''
   Jeff Lucas, a driver for North Hollywood Ice Co., said the
company uses mobile ice crushers to pulverize 300-pound blocks of
ice, and blowers to spray the fine particles across the yard.
   ``It's the same grade as snow,'' said Lucas. ``We lay it on so
thick, it'll last a while even in the sun.''
   The company has delivered yuletide snow-on-demand since the
1970s and got more than 25 residential orders this year, manager
Fred Rymond said.

   A listing in the local telephone
book for Rudolph Reindeer is actually an unlisted phone number at
nearby Fort Carson, an apparent Christmas prank that has gone
little noticed for seven years.
   The telephone number _ complete with non-existent address _ was
assigned to Rudolph on Dec. 16, 1982, said Abel Chavez, a spokesman
for U S West Communications. The number is one of thousands
assigned to Fort Carson.
   ``It was a humorous stunt, I would guess,'' Chavez said. ``It's
kind of amazing that it's lasted this long and was not brought to
our attention.''
   It was also kind of amazing to Fort Carson officials, who said
few people called the number asking for ``Rudolph'' until a news
story about it was published Friday.
   ``It was supposed to be unlisted,'' said spokeswoman Ann Smith.
``How it got in the phone book, we don't know. I think there's
somebody with a silly sense of humor.''
   The base has nearly 6,000 telephone numbers, assigned to
different departments as needed. Smith said ``Rudolph's'' number
has been assigned to a weather station in a trailer on the base
since 1987, Smith said. She was not sure which department had the
number in 1982.
   A newspaper story about the listing Friday prompted a flurry of
calls to the weather trailer, said Sgt. Mike Howard, base spokesman.
   ``They have received about 100 calls, from children to
grandparents. The people who work in the trailer provide
meteorological information (for Fort Carson units). This morning,
they spent their morning answering the telephone.''
   Chavez said it's too late to get it out of the 1990 phone book,
but it will be pulled from future editions.

   The European Community foreign ministers pledged
immediate aid to Romania on Friday and saluted the people's courage
in overthrowing the Stalinist regime of President Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva sent two
planes with 4 tons of medical supplies to Bucharest. Two
non-government aid agencies based in Paris also prepared to send
doctors and medical equipment.
   After a special meeting called by Foreign Minister Roland Dumas
of France, ministers of the 12-nation European Community said
Romanians paid a ``heavy price'' in toppling Ceausescu, who ruled
for 24 years.
   ``So that Romania can reclaim its destiny, the European
Community and its member states solemnly reaffirm their will to
give it the immediate aid and cooperation of which the Ceausescu
regime has unjustly deprived it,'' said a statement released by the
ministers.
   Dumas said later the aid would be in food, but he did not
specify the type or amount. He said community officials would meet
next week to work out the details.
   In Brussels, the European Commission decided to send $1.2
million in medical aid to be distributed by the French agencies
Doctors Without Borders and Doctors of the World, the French Red
Cross, the West German Red Cross and the International Red Cross.
   It appeared the Community also would review recent sanctions
taken against Romania, including an announcement Thursday
suspending preferential trading agreements on some Romanian
products.
   ``The Community is ready to furnish emergency aid to the
Romanian people, who have suffered so much,'' Dumas said.
   In their communique, the ministers invited Romania to rejoin the
35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe that
drafted the 1975 Helsinki accords on human rights.
   The ministers saluted ``the courage of the Romanian people, who
reconquered the liberty to which, like all other people, they have
a right.''
   The ministers were in Paris for the second day of a two-day
meeting on coordinating trade policy with the 22-member Arab League.
   Juerg Bischoff, a Red Cross spokesman in Geneva said national
Red Cross and Red Crescent societies in neighboring countries were
standing by to help. The Red Crescent is the Moslem equivalent of
the Red Cross.
   He said officials in Bucharest gave permission for the two Red
Cross planes to land, he said, and ``we suspect there is very
little medical material in Romania at the moment.''
   The planes will carry seven Red Cross workers and one
representative of the World Health Organization to Romania to
establish longer-term requirements.
   Doctors Without Borders and Doctors of the World said they were
sending medical personnel to Bucharest.
   ``The Romanians are short of everything: first-aid, antibiotics,
syringes, food and clothing,'' said Jacques Lebas, president of
Doctors of the World.
   Doctors Without Borders said it would send an eight-member
medical team and 1.2 tons of equipment Friday, and more flights
Saturday with 18 tons of equipment from Paris and Brussels.

   Exiled King Michael of Romania said Friday he's
ready to return to his country as head of a constitutional monarchy
``if the people want me to come back.''
   ``I have been waiting for this for 40 years,'' he told a news
conference convened hastily after the reported overthrow of
President Nicolae Ceausescu. ``If people want me to come back, of
course, I will come back.''
   ``Romania has had a constitutional monarchy before the war and
it proved itself,'' he said. ``If things turn the right way I don't
see why this could not happen again.''
   Michael, 68, left his country in the first days of 1948 after
signing an act of abdication but he repeated Friday that he did so
under duress.
   ``Therefore, I consider that I have remained king of Romania and
the head of state for the past 40 years,'' he said. ``It has never
stopped.''
   He said he was flooded with telephone calls and messages telling
him of the rapid developments in Romania but that he has had no
direct contact with his native country up to now.
   When asked about his feelings, he replied: ``Overwhelmed.''
   ``You cannot find the right words to express it,'' he said. ``It
has been a great relief and sadness at the same time because of
this terrible bloodshed.''
   Before the question-and-answer session, which was mostly in
English, he read a statement in French in which he paid ``homage to
my courageous compatriots, men and women.''
   He urged legalization of all democratic organizations and
parties, free elections in six months, release of all political
prisoiners and ``absolute respect for the transitional government.''
   Michael renewed an appeal for an end to violence and urged
Romanians to adopt a spirit of reconciliation, ``despite the
humiliations and the cruel living conditions imposed on you.''
   ``We have too much to do to rebuild our country than to lose our
time for personal revenge,'' he said later.
   Asked what he would suggest should be done with Ceausescu, he
said: ``Maybe I have some ideas,'' drawing laughter from the
journalists.
   Then he continued that ``it is up to the people at home to
decide,'' adding that he thought it only right that those ``who
have been leading the country for the past 20 or more years should
get the just answer, that they should be tried.''
   He was flanked by his wife, Queen Anne, a Princess of
Bourbon-Parma, and his oldest daughter, Princess Margarita, who
would be the first in line to succeed him.
   Michael, who holds a British passport, moved to Switzerland more
than 30 years ago.

   An outraged nation today drove Romanian
President Nicolae Ceausescu from power, but forces loyal to the
Communist hard-liner staged a counterattack and battled for control
of the country.
   There were conflicting reports about Ceausescu's whereabouts.
One report said he was arrested while fleeing the country, another
said he had escaped, and a third said he was holed up in a town
northeast of Bucharest.
   Ceausescu's son Nicu, former Communist Party chief in the south
Transylvanian town of Sibiu, was captured and shown on Romanian
television.
   A uniformed man and a civilian held his arms and said he would
be brought to trial. Nicu had a little swelling and traces of blood
above his left eye. He was being pushed around as he was led away.
The uniformed man said Nicu had left Sibiu giving orders to
security forces loyal to his father not to shoot.
   In Bucharest, the presidential palace was on fire, and
demonstrators waved Romanian flags in front of the burning building
as gunfire rang out. Reporters in the city said the Central
Committee building also was damaged.
   Yugoslav television reported hundreds killed. It did not cite
sources.
   The counterattack began after rallies by hundreds of thousands
of people in the streets of Bucharest and other cities to celebrate
Ceausescu's ouster after 24 years of hard-line rule.
   Romanian television said about 2,000 pro-Ceausescu forces moved
into the capital, and radio reports said loyalists were also
fighting for control in Brasov, a city 90 miles to the north.
   Romanian radio, which was taken over by protesters earlier
today, reported ``fierce battles'' between army troops and
pro-Ceausescu forces that it branded ``terrorists.''
   ``Eventually, the terrorists surrendered, but there are other
attempts to crush our revolution in other parts of the city,'' an
unidentified man said on the radio.
   Ceausescu was toppled by a popular revolt that lasted less than
a week but that is believed to have claimed the lives of thousands
of anti-government demonstrators.
   The upheaval in Romania comes at the close of a remarkable year
during which the hard-line leaderships of Poland, Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Bulgaria were ousted by massive
protests and replaced by reformers.
   By early evening, anti-Ceausescu appeared to have gained the
upper hand, with radio reporting that security forces had laid down
their arms. ``Criminal elements were neutralized or arrested,'' the
radio reported tersely.
   But shortly after 7 p.m. (noon EST), news media said
pro-Ceausescu forces were attacking Bucharest. ``Dead and wounded
are reported from all parts of city,'' the Czechoslovak news agency
CTK said.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said there was heavy shooting in
Bucharest.
   Television said Bucharest jails had been opened by the
anti-Ceausescu supporters. Engineer Nicu Stefanescu, one of those
released, said that thousands of people had been arrested Thursday
night during the huge unrest that forced Ceausescu to flee.
   Even children were detained, he said, reporting that there were
so many wounded in the jail that blood was seen in the corridors.
   News reports said Ceausescu, 71, and his wife and second-in
command, Elena, fled their palace by helicopter. Romanian
television, urging everybody in the country to stop the ruler
fleeing, said they landed at the Titu military airport outside
Bucharest, then fled by car.
   Television reported first that they had been seized near the
town of Tirgoviste, 45 miles northwest of Bucharest. Minutes later,
television cast doubt on its report, saying Ceausescu apparently
fled again.
   The Romanian news agency Agerpres said Ceausescu had been
arrested, but it appeared to be referring the first, outdated TV
report.
   A later report from the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said he was
holed up at the town of Trgoviste. Then, in the evening, Romanian
television announced without further detail that Ceausescu and his
wife Elena had left the country.
   Earlier reports described fierce fighting between army troops
and paramilitary police in Sibiu, where Ceausescu's son had ruled.
``A massacre is going on,'' an unidentified general said on
state-controlled media.
   Later, an unidentified general, who may have been the same
officer, claimed that fighting had ceased throughout the country.
   Corneliu Manescu, a 73-year-old former foreign minister, said on
Romanian television that he was head of a provisional government
that would stay in power until free elections could be held, the
East German news agency said.
   Manescu has for many months been under house arrest in an
agro-industrial complex in the vicinity of Bucharest, informed
sources said. In March, he and five other senior officials sharply
criticized the Ceausescu leadership.
   The Romanian state news agency Agerpres, which announced the end
of censorship and promised truthful reporting in the future, said
Ion Iliescu, a former Central Committee secretary ousted by
Ceausescu in 1971, had announced on television that a ``National
Salvation Front'' had been set up.
   Speaking from a balcony of the Central Committee building in
Bucharest, Iliescu told a jubilant crowd there were reports the
ousted ruler had been arrested near Tirgoviste.
   ``If these reports are confirmed, he will be arrested and
submitted to public justice,'' Iliescu said.
   Hundreds of thousands of people were in the streets of Bucharest
and in the streets of Timisoara, the west Romanian city where
troops fired on protesters last weekend, igniting the week of the
nationwide revolt against Ceausescu's autocratic rule.
   An Associated Press reporter said from Timisoara that the entire
city appeared to be on the streets.
   ``This is something we never expected to happen. The dictator is
gone,'' Ingeborg Kziraska said in front of a cathedral where she
said more than 30 children were gunned down Sunday during protests.
   Reports from Timisoara put the deaths during the week of
protests in the city at between 2,000 and 4,500.
   The two other countries in East Europe that are not part of the
Soviet bloc are Albania, which remains a hard-line socialist state,
and Yugoslavia, which has been torn by ethnic unrest that has
overshadowed reform proposals.
   Ceausescu was the last hard-line Soviet alliance leader. With
his family he strictly controlled the spartan society he had built
and refused to adopt reforms despite chronic shortages of food and
energy that made life miserable for most Romanians.
   He apparently felt so secure with the dominance of his cult of
personality that he traveled to Iran earlier this week during the
growing protests, and held a pro-government rally on Thursday that
turned into a huge chorus of denunciations of his rule.
   Ceausescu tried one more time to address crowds before fleeing
from his palace, the Bulgarian news agency BTA reported. He was
shouted down with cries of ``Death, Death,'' the agency said.
   While still in Ceausescu's hands, Romanian radio reported early
today that defense minister Vasile Milea had committed suicide and
blamed him for the national unrest. But a later radio report denied
that.
   The uprising began on Dec. 15 with a few hundred people
defending an ethnic Hungarian pastor threatened with arrest in
Timisoara. The protests swelled last weekend, with thousands of
protesters chanting for more food and the overthrow of Ceausescu.
   Security forces massacred hundreds, possibly thousands, of
unarmed civilians in Timisoara last Sunday. The Hungarian news
agency MTI reported today that two mass graves containing 632
bodies had been found outside Timisoara, while Czechoslovak media
gave the latest death toll as 4,700.
   Other Romanian cities, learning of the reported massacre, also
staged anti-Ceausescu protests during the last week.

   With Panama in chaos, U.S. officials said
Friday that military police trained to restore and enforce law and
order will play a large role in the country, possibly staying as
long as a year.
   Gen. Maxwell Thurman, head of the U.S. Southern Command, told
reporters at a new conference in Panama that a top U.S. priority
was to ``raise the (Panamanian) police force and get it back in
operation.''
   In Washington, Gen. Tom Kelly, director of operations for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, stressed the importance of the military
police.
   ``The role we will play is assisting the Panamanians ... in
maintaining order and recapturing and controlling of their
institutions like the police,'' he said.
   ``We've got to re-establish law and order throughout Panama
City,'' said Lt. Col. Bill Bennett, a top military planner.
   Military experts said the military police might work with
Panamanian Defense Forces loyal to new President Guillermo Endara,
training them and incorporating them on patrols.
   U.S. officials spoke while mobs, some devoted to ousted Gen.
Manuel Noriega, roamed Panama City, ``breaking windows, entering
private homes, looting at will,'' according to Jan Edmonson, the
U.S. Embassy spokesman in Panama City.
   By Friday _ the third day of the U.S. intervention _ the
military police numbered 3,000, Bennett said. Some 1,500
reinforcements from Fort Bragg, N.C., were brought in to help. All
told, U.S. troops number about 24,000.
   U.S. military officials refused to say how long they would keep
combat troops in Panama, but Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of
the House Armed Services Committee, predicted the military police
might be in for a long haul.
   ``I would not be surprised to see them there on Christmas Eve a
year from now,'' he said.
   Military police _ or MPs _ have a number of specific tasks,
including security and law enforcement at U.S. bases, the support
of combat forces and protection of prisoners of war. In Panama,
some 1,400 pro-Noriega loyalists are being held prisoner, Thurman
said.
   American MPs ``are not too much unlike a civilian police
force,'' said Michael Abrams, a spokesman at Fort McClellan near
Anniston, Ala., home of the U.S. Army Military Police School.
   MPs were recently in the headlines when they were sent to the
Virgin Islands to restore calm after Hurricane Hugo. But Abrams
said the situation in the Virgin Islands differed substantially
from that in Panama.
   In the islands, MPs worked in concert with local law enforcement
officers, letting the civil authorities play the lead role in
making arrests and controlling disorderly conduct.
   But in Panama, ``it seems like the whole country has been turned
upside down,'' he said. ``I haven't the faintest idea how they are
operate.''
   Richard Armitage, a former Defense Department official,
suggested the new government in Panama temporarily might empower
the MPs with authority to make arrests and handle other problems.
   MPs, often the most visible servicemen because of their public
function, are trained to handle scores of tasks from criminal
investigations to traffic. On bases, they commonly patrol housing
areas, set up speed traps and make arrests.
   They also protect convoys, set up perimeter security and quell
disturbances.

<HEAD>Government to Drop Appeal of Nuclear Plant Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department is dropping its appeal
of a $78 million judgment in a class-action lawsuit filed by
neighbors of an Ohio nuclear weapons plant, but doesn't know how it
will pay the 14,000 plaintiffs, the department's top lawyer said
Friday.
   ``We're not going to pursue our appeal,'' Stephen A. Wakefield
said, adding that ``the bad news'' is that the department
discovered earlier this week it cannot pay the judgment from a fund
it planned to use.
   The historic settlement came when the government, for the first
time, acknowledged that a nuclear weapons plant might have harmed
people living near it.
   The Fernald, Ohio, plant has spread uncounted tons of powdered
uranium dust into the surrounding area. Operations were suspended
earlier this year to intensify efforts to clean up the
contamination.
   Wakefield said verbal notice of the decision was given to the
plaintiffs' lawyers Thursday, but he would not say specifically why
the department changed its mind about the appeal.
   The government had never contested the amount of the judgment,
but appealed because it disagreed with a judicial interpretation of
the terms of the settlement.
   ``We think it's really past time,'' said Lisa Crawford, one of
the plaintiffs who contended in a 1985 lawsuit that releases of
radioactive material from the plant had damaged their property
values and caused them emotional distress.
   ``My question is, when are they going to put the money in the
bank?'' she said.
   In an interview, Wakefield said the Justice Department told him
earlier this week that he could not pay the $78 million from a
federal contingency fund as planned because the lawsuit was brought
not against the government but against National Lead of Ohio Inc.,
which ran the plant under federal contract until 1985.
   The Energy Department was required under terms of the operating
contract to shield National Lead against liability in the case.
   Wakefield said the department would have to ask Congress for a
special appropriation to cover the settlement and that payments
probably would be made in installments.
   ``That's terrible,'' said Paul Nemann, one of three
court-appointed trustees overseeing the settlement.
   He said the department's lawyers had said ``in no uncertain
terms'' at the time of the settlement last summer that the money
would be available by October. The department filed a notice of
appeal Oct. 17.
   Stanley Chesley, the lead lawyer for Fernald residents,
applauded the Energy Department's decision to abandon its appeal.
   ``That's encouraging. We'd like to work with them and get the
money,'' he said.
   The settlement clears the way for federal funds to pay for
long-term medical monitoring of the health of people living within
five miles of the Feed Materials Production Center at Fernald,
which processes uranium for the weapons program.
   The purpose of the medical study is to determine whether there
was an excess of cancers or other health problems that could be
traced to radiation released from the plant, which has operated for
38 years. It is 18 miles from Cincinnati.
   The department appealed the settlement to the 6th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Cincinnati because U.S. District Judge S.
Arthur Spiegel ruled in September that the deal did not prevent two
companies near the site from suing the department for environmental
damage to their property caused by the weapons plant.

   A member of a Smithsonian Institution
research team rescued Friday by U.S. troops said it was a fantastic
moment when the group saw U.S. helicopters arriving.
   The 11-member research team had been abducted Wednesday from an
island research center and forced to march into the jungle by about
30 soldiers loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The Smithsonian group, including a 4-year-old girl, eventually
was abandoned without food by the soldiers. U.S. military forces,
after a fruitless search for the researchers on Thursday, located
them on Friday as they were being taken by a friendly schoolteacher
to a nearby town.
   ``That was a fantastic moment, seeing the helicopters come,''
said Steve Travers, a marine biologist with the Smithsonian group.
   Mary Knowlton, another scientist, said the group expected
trouble because of the U.S. invasion on Wednesday. Those fears were
realized when a Panamanian patrol boat arrived at the research
center, she said.
   The research team talked the soldiers into letting them grab a
few belongings before they were hurriedly taken ashore. They
managed to sneak out three two-way radios with which they would
later guide U.S. armed forces to their location for rescue.
   Greg Summers, another member of the group, said they were taken
by boat to an airfield and then into the jungle. They walked from
11 a.m. Wednesday until 1 a.m. Thursday, he said.
   ``The worst part was walking down the main landing strip off to
the side and into the woods. Everybody thought they were going to
shoot us,'' said Travers.
   ``We really didn't know we were going to be walking halfway
across Panama,'' Knowlton said. At one point it appeared to the
hostages that their captors feared that they themselves were
isolated when word reached them that Americans were in control of
Panama City. They asked their captives to tell the American troops
that the researchers had been taken into protective custody. Then
the group was abandoned on Thursday.
   Using the radios they had hidden, the group contacted
Smithsonian officials in Panama City.
   Lt. Col. Joseph Umbarger, who coordinated the rescue, said at
first the U.S. military thought the situation might be a potential
trap but then sent three helicopters on a dangerous nighttime
search over the jungle about 20 to 25 miles north of Panama City.
Although the pilots scoured the area for hours, the initial aerial
search team was forced to return without the hostages when their
fuel ran low.
   The group received help from the school teacher Friday morning.
The teacher was taking them in a flatbed truck to the town of Chepo
when a second flight of helicopters from Fort Clayton spotted them
in transit.
   The researchers said they jumped off the truck and waved pieces
of clothing in a pre-arranged pattern to tip off the soldiers.

   Western governments have stepped up
intelligence gathering in East Germany to get a grip on the new
political situation, the official ADN news agency said Friday.
   The United States and West Germany are interested especially in
acquiring information from political, economic and military
sources, the agency said, citing the Agency for Protection of the
Constitution, as the country's counterintelligence service is known.
   The new service, which bears the same name as its West German
equivalent, was created when the Stasi _ the hated secret police _
was dissolved and reorganized.
   Western intelligence agencies are seeking to get a fix on the
new leaders who have emerged since the collapse of the Communist
Party to be able formulate a new German policy, the agency said.
   The agencies have concluded that German reunification is on the
poltical agenda, but have yet to decide whether German unity is a
military danger to European stability or if Western governments
should support the rapprochement, ADN said.
   The ouster of former Communist Party leader Erich Honecker on
Oct. 18 as well as his successor Egon Krenz on Dec. 3 has pushed
little-known groups into the political limelight.
   The future role of the newly renamed Communist Party remains
unclear to the Western agencies, ADN reported.
   As a result of political fragmentation and the emergence of new
political groups, Western intelligence services are trying to
recruit new sources on a wider political basis.
   The creation of a new pool of agents in strategic positions in
the government, economy military and security service is of key
importance to the West, ADN reported.

   The U.S. ambassador to Panama, Arthur Davis,
has authorized $25,000 to purchase food and medicine for needy
Panamanians, the State Department said Friday.
   In addition, as part of the restoration of normal relations with
Panama, the Treasury Department released $100,000 in Panamanian
funds which had been frozen in the United States, department
spokesman Richard Boucher said.
   The frozen funds were to be turned over to President Guillermo
Endara for payment of salaries, officials said. The $25,000 came
from a fund the embassy maintains for emergency situations, Boucher
said.
   Panama's assets in the United States were frozen last year. The
total is estimated at $371 million.
   Meanwhile, Panama's new ambassador to Washington, Carlos
Rodriguez, moved into the embassy on Friday. The keys to the
mission were turned over to him by a State Department official in
late afternoon.
   The embassy was shut down Sept. 1, the date on which the term of
office expired of President Eric Arturo Delvalle. The Bush
administration regarded Delvalle as Panama's legitimate authority
even though he had been ousted in February 1988.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Soviet
lawmakers on Friday threw their support to the Romanian people who
overthrew the 24-year regime of Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Members of the parliament broke into applause when Gorbachev
announced that Romanian radio had reported Ceausescu's arrest.
Then, on Gorbachev's suggestion, they adopted a resolution offering
``decisive support for the just cause of the people of Romania.''
   The evening news show ``Vremya'' showed stunning footage of
hundreds of thousands of Romanians packed into vast squares in
downtown Bucharest, demonstrating to topple Ceausescu's regime.
   Jubilant Romanians dumped books from the balcony of the
Communist Party building, rode armored personnel carriers through
the streets and waved tri-color national flags with gaping holes
where the emblem of socialist Romania had been cut out.
   ``At this very moment, the capital of Romania is swept away with
happiness,'' reported Sergei Zheleznyak from Bucharest.
   However, later reports from East bloc media said that
pro-Ceausescu forces attacked the city, and that fierce battles
raged between army units sympathetic to the protesters and security
forces loyal to their fallen leader.
   The official news agency Tass, formerly a mouthpiece of
Communist orthodoxy, graphically chronicled Ceausescu's ouster.
   ``Hundreds of people have climbed up on tanks and APCs (armored
personnel carriers) and unfurled slogans, such as `We are for
freedom!' `We want democracy!' and `Away with the dictatorship!' ''
it said.
   At the parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies, about 200
deputies crowded around a Tass news monitor in the lobby when it
flashed the first report of Ceausescu's flight.
   ``It's a holiday!'' said deputy Roald Z. Sagdeyev.
   Another deputy was heard to comment, ``We are the only two
dictatorships left _ Albania and the Soviet Union.'' A more
conservative colleague muttered, ``They are surrounding us from all
sides.''
   Soviet officials refrained from condemning the violent
confrontations between the government and demonstrators this past
week, until it was reported that Ceausescu was trying to flee.
   On Thursday, government spokesman Vadim Perfiliev would say only
that ``We will be very sorry for them'' if reports of casualties
were correct. Even Friday morning, Gorbachev supported a mild
resolution that merely called for a peaceful solution.
   At midday, Gorbachev announced the latest news to a hushed
session: 500,000 people were marching in the streets, the army had
gone over to the people, the defense minister had committed suicide
and helicopters were hovering over Ceausescu's home.
   Left hanging with that tantalizing report, the deputies broke
for lunch.
   At the close of the session Friday night, Gorbachev announced
that Romanian radio was reporting that Ceausescu had been arrested,
and the majority of the Congress broke into applause. Gorbachev
then proposed the resolution, and it passed on a show of hands.
   ``Vremya'' said thousands of people responding to an overnight
call for a strike moved to the center of Bucharest on Friday, and
soldiers fraternized instead of shooting as they had on Thursday.
   When students captured the Romanian government TV station,
``Vremya'' said, it broadcast speeches by ``the best people of the
country: writers, actors, poets'' who declared the end of the
tyranny and called for army transport to bring representatives from
around the country to form a democratic government.
   ``Vremya'' also kept up with electrifying new developments,
interrupting the news moments after its first report to announce
unconfirmed reports that Ceausescu had been arrested.
   In Soviet Moldavia, which was once part of Romania, about 8,000
people demonstrated in downtown Kishinev on Friday evening,
sporting signs that congratulated their Romanian brothers and
calling Ceausescu a ``fascist,'' according to Moldavian People's
Front activist Serjiu Burke.
   Other slogans called for the border fence to be ripped down,
portending possible further ethnic trouble for the Soviet Union.
Some Moldavian activists have said they would like to reunite with
Romania if it were not ruled by Ceausescu.

<HEAD>Ruling Party Rejects Calls Against Marxist-Leninist Dictatorship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN EDLIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling party Friday ignored calls to
heed the collapse of Communism in eastern Europe and pledged to
create a one-party Marxist-Leninist state.
   The decision, on the final day of the four-day Patriotic Front
congress, was contained in a document approved by 4,200 delegates.
   It restated the dream of President Robert Mugabe to transform
one of Africa's few Western-style democracies into a single-party
nation, which he may do next year.
   The party's aim is ``to establish and sustain a socialist
society guided by Marxist-Leninist principles but firmly based on
our historical, cultural and social experience and to create
conditions for economic independence, increased productivity and
equitable distribution of the wealth of the nation,'' it said.
   Mugabe, who led the former white-ruled British colony of
Rhodesia to independence as black-governed Zimbabwe on April 18,
1980, strenuously urged delegates to reject calls to abandon this
goal in favor of multiparty democracy and a free enterprise economy.
   The debate behind closed doors was ``heated but healthy,'' said
party spokesman Nathan Shamuyarira, who is also minister of foreign
affairs.
   Pro-democracy groups had hoped Zimbabwe would follow some other
African states that abandoned radical leftist policies in line with
events in eastern Europe.
   In Benin, a former French territory in West Africa, the
leadership early this month denounced Communism and promised
constitutional reforms.
   In Ethiopia, Africa's most rigid Marxist state, President
Mengistu Haile Mariam has been forced to hold peace talks with
guerrilla chieftains since the Soviet Union began reducing military
supplies to fight secessionist wars. This has raised the prospect
he might pursue political liberalization.
   More and more African countries also are jettisoning outdated
economic policies in favor of reforms proposed by the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund.
   In recent months, as pro-democratic movements have swept eastern
Europe, Mugabe has come under pressure to abandon the aim of a
one-party state.
   Mugabe's Patriotic Front has been avowedly Marxist-Leninist
since independence. Former opposition leader Joshua Nkomo was more
centrist.
   But the two decided two years ago to merge forces, a move that
was formalized by their first joint congress this week.
   The ruling party can pass laws and rewrite sections of the
British-drafted constitution, a document signed by all parties 10
years ago.
   Those constitutional talks ended nine decades of white minority
rule, halted a seven-year war waged by guerrillas loyal to Nkomo
and Mugabe, and steered Zimbabwe to independence.
   The constitution guaranteed Zimbabwe would be a multi-party
democracy for the first 10 years of independence.
   After the 10th anniversary, Mugabe may ban opposition and
establish a single-party state with two-thirds of the votes in
Parliament.

   U.S. soldiers who stormed one of Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega's guest houses here narrowly missed
capturing four Brazilian voodoo witches who performed rituals for
his protection, officials said Friday.
   The so-called ``witch house,'' a fortified structure specially
built for Noriega, contained an estimated 50 pounds of cocaine, a
bucket of blood, voodoo artifacts and a brewery for making
concoctions and potions, Col. Mike Snell, the officer in charge of
the area, said.
   Snell said it was not known whether the blood was human or
animal or for what the potions were used. Officers said some of the
cocaine had been wrapped in a banana leaf and placed in the freezer.
   Gen. Maxwell Thurmand, commander of the Panama-based Southern
Command, said at a press briefing that Noriega's ``voodoo
practitioners ... practiced rituals for Noriega's protection.''
   Lt. Curtis Vinyard said the house had apparently been occupied
until shortly before it was stormed by U.S. troops.
   Other military officers said the house was where Noriega ``kept
his Brazilian withces.''
   ``There was still a candle burning,'' he said.
   Some of the soldiers who stormed the house said there were
smoldering cigarettes in ashtrays and women had left their purses,
and they believed they might have come close to capturing Noriega
himself.
   In any event, Noriega was still at large.
   The house, on the seacoast near here and close to several U.S.
military bases, was stormed by U.S. soldiers on Tuesday, about six
hours after the U.S. invasion began.
   An American soldier who would not give his name but was familiar
with the incident said troops who saw the house spread the word
that one room was apparently devoted to the occult, with blood and
entrails.
   Reporters were also shown odd trappings in two offices used by
Noriega. His office in Panama's military barracks at Fort Amador
had two display cases full of plastic frogs, framed pictures of
Adolf Hitler, Mother Theresa and Moammar Ghadafi, and dozens of
electronic toys such as a video wristwatch. U.S. officials showed
reporters Christmas trees, more electronics and more frogs at his
former headquarters office downtown.
   Snell said collections of pornography wre found in both offices
and the Fort Amador house was stocked with Noriega's private brands
of cigars and champagne.
   U.S. intelligence officials scoured the offices in the hope of
finding records would help trace Noriega's assets.
   Sgt. 1st Class Joseph Torregrossa said the Fort Amador office
also contained expensive prints and ``a lot of expensive weapons,
mostly automatic. He had German Lugers, Israeli Uzis, all sorts of
real sophisticated stuff.''
   Thurmand told reporters, ``He was clearly dedicated to
outfitting a substantial force, outfitting dignity battalions,
which in the long run would have given us a tremendous challenge in
this area.''
   Travel restrictions, including a nighttime curfew, were still in
effect Friday, and new fighting was reported with men loyal to
Noriega attacking the headquarters of the U.S. Southern Command.
   A two-hour tour through a bombed-out shopping district that once
was a Noriega stronghold showed scenes of near chaos as thousands
of looters seized refrigerators, microwaves, automobile tires,
gasoline and other goods.
   They cheerfully stopped, however, to shout ``Viva Bush, Viva
Bush'' or ``Bush, Bush, Bush'' as they waved to soldiers and
journalists. One held up a knife sharpener and joked, ``It's a
present from Bush.''
   Noriega's nine-building headquarters was a smouldering hulk, its
windows blown out by tank and artillery fire. It was closely
guarded by dozens of U.S. troops.
   Less than a mile away, the body of a man, face down and
shirtless, lay trapped in the crushed wreckage of a sedan. A U.S.
infantry sergeant said an armored personnel carrier rolled over the
car after the driver was seen passing out AK-47 rifles.
   An old section of the city around Noriega headquarters contained
many of Panama City's poor and homeless, but they had largely
abandoned it, taking refuge in quarters provided by U.S. military
at the American-owned Balboa High School in the suburbs, U.S.
officials said.

   For the Roman Catholic Church,
crippled and corrupted by the Communist state, Christmas will be a
joyous reawakening of hope after more than four decades of
persecution.
   ``It will be a Christmas in freedom,'' said Cardinal Frantisek
Tomasek, who will say Mass in Prague's gothic St. Vitus Cathedral
on Christmas Day. ``It is now possible for our priests to speak
freely.''
   Mass was said in churches last Christmas, but only by priests
licensed by the state. Authorities discouraged attendance by the
nation's estimated 9.3 million Catholics, 60 percent of the
population.
   Many believers stayed away while an unknown number of others met
secretly in cramped apartments for Christmas Mass performed by
banned priests.
   Now, everything is different. The peaceful revolution that began
in November bringing an end to Communist domination has opened
unlimited possiblities for the church.
   On Sunday, Mass will be said in virtually every church to
hundreds of thousands of faithful. Millions more will watch it
broadcast live on state TV, an event unimaginable a year ago.
   Last Christmas, the Rev. Vaclav Maly was shunned as a dissident.
Ducking secret police, he said Mass for about a dozen people who
gathered around him at great risk.
   This year, Maly will stand before hundreds on the altar of
Strahovsky Klaster, a 13th century monastery overlooking to Vltava
River.
   Jailed for joining the human rights group Charter 77, Maly
worked between stints in jail as a night watchman and coal stoaker
while ministering secretly. On Jan 1, he will begin leading his own
church.
   ``The 11 years I could not work in public were not in vain. I
met all levels of society and learned to talk to atheists as well
as believers. I was thrown into life with my faith as my only
support,'' said Maly, 39, whose name is being mentioned to replace
Tomasek as primate of Czechoslovakia.
   Tomasek, 90, said he plans to discuss his retirement with Pope
John Paul II when he visits Czechoslovakia, possibly next year.
   Tomasek himself spent three years in jail in the 1950s for being
named a bishop without state approval. Dozens of others shared his
fate.
   Monastic orders were dissolved, religious associations banned.
An estimated 8,000 of the country's 12,000 monks disappeared into
labor camps.
   Clergy became employees of the state, receiving their salaries
from the government who had veto power over all church appointments.
   As a result of this power, Bishoprics fell vacant while the
Vatican and Communist state argued over who should fill them. As
recently as a year ago, 10 of the nation's 13 bishoprics were empty.
   On Thursday, three of these were filled. By the end of next
month, Tomasek hopes they will all be full.
   ``We've waited 30 years for this,'' Tomasek said in an
interview. ``Now it seems the freedom of the church is certain and
will be fully respected.''
   The reform government announced last week that freedom of
religion will no longer be limited. The 1949 law requiring the
licensing of priest will be stricken from the books.
   But forbidden fruit is sweetest, and some fear that after the
first flush of religious freedom, believers may stray.
   ``Before it was a simple, the powerful against the powerless,''
Maly said. ``The church was attractive because it embodied values
denied or oppressed by Marxist ideology.''
   But in the pluralistic society being built, the church will have
to compete.
   ``There will be a richness of values, and the church's role is
an open question,'' Maly said. ``But I believe the church will
succeed in attracting more people than ever if it has the internal
strength to preach tolerance and help society remember forgotten
values like forgiveness, trust, love, faithfulness, respect for the
individual.''
   ``The church has an excellent chance. People are spiritually
hungry after such a long time.''

   Western Europe rejoiced Friday at the downfall of
Nicolae Ceausescu, pledging immediate aid, and Romania's erstwhile
Eastern allies joined in welcoming the demise of the Soviet bloc's
last hard-line ruler.
   The United States said a ``terrible burden'' had been lifted
from Romania.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev read out a news update
from the podium of parliament, and Soviet deputy and space
scientist Roald Z. Sagdeyev declared: ``It's a holiday.''
   Leaders elsewhere saluted the courage of Romanians who were
mowed down by tanks and bullets in the uprisings, the only killings
in the wave of democracy spreading through Eastern Europe. Many
pleaded for an end to the violence.
   ``To win this victory, the people of Romania have paid a heavy
price: the yoke of tyranny throughout long years, the massacre of
innocent people in the course of recent weeks,'' the 12-nation
European Economic Community said from its headquarters in Brussels,
Belgium.
   Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, in a ``a sign of revulsion,'' and
Norway's King Olav V each stripped Ceausescu of royal honors
awarded a decade ago.
   Romania's exiled King Michael, deposed by the Communists in
1947, told his countrymen in a broadcast from Switzerland, ``I am
and will always remain with you.''
   In dozens of countries, national radio and TV interrupted
programs with news from Romania and gave constant updates,
emanating in stunning detail from East bloc news agencies,
including the Soviet Union's Tass.
   Before Gorbachev's policy of openness, reports of any troubles
in an allied country would have taken days or weeks to reach the
official media _ if ever.
   Ceausescu had closed Romania's borders to black out news of
violent suppression of protests ignited a week ago in the western
city of Timisoara, but some reporters were able to reach the
troubled city on Friday.
   There was no immediate comment from China, a Ceausescu ally and
bastion of tough Communist rule. The main Chinese dissident group,
the Paris-based Front for Democracy in China, said: ``The wind of
history blowing in Bucharest will soon reach Beijing.''
   Emerging democracies in Eastern Europe welcomed the news and
appealed for peace.
   Premier Miklos Nemeth of Hungary, a Warsaw Pact ally at odds
with Romania over Ceausescu's treatment of ethnic Hungarians, said:
``At last we have to come to terms with each other. We cannot let
the historic opportunity pass,''
   In Czechoslovakia, opposition leader Vaclav Havel asked with
Romanians, ``in the name of our velvet revolution,'' not to take
violent revenge.
   ``In our country, there was a slogan shouted, `We are not like
them,''' Havel said in a message to Romanians. ``You should ask for
a just punishment for Ceausescu, but not the death penalty. Stop
the wave of violence. Otherwise it will flow over all of Europe.''
   President Bush called the upheaval ``a dramatic change.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said ``a terrible
burden appears to have been lifted'' with the ouster of Ceausescu.
   ``The United States shares the rejoicing of the Romanian people
and joins them in their hopes for a peaceful transition to
democracy,'' Fitzwater said.
   In Brussels, the European Commission of the 12-nation community
announced an immediate $1.2 million grant in emergency aid to
Romania.
   The community's foreign ministers, after a hastily convened
meeting in Paris, promised political cooperation too. They invited
Romania to rejoin the 35-nation Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe that drafted the 1975 Helsinki accords on
human rights.
   ``So that Romania can reclaim its destiny, the European
Community and its member states solemnly reaffirm their will to
give it the immediate aid and cooperation of which the Ceausescu
regime has unjustly deprived it,'' the ministers said.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross and two
humanitarian organizations in France said they were flying doctors
and medical supplies to Bucharest.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher declared
that Romanians ``have won a great victory over a dictatorship
contemptuous of mankind.''
   At Friday's opening of the historic Brandenburg Gate in the
once-divided city of Berlin, East German Communist Premier Hans
Modrow welcomed the news.
   Among other fledgling democracies of the East, Poland's
Solidarity-led government said, ``We wish the young republic all
the best.''
   In Yugoslavia, TV and radio devoted virtually non-stop live
coverage and the government said it welcomed ``all efforts leading
to prosperity ... liberty and human dignity'' in neighboring
Romania.
   In London, the Foreign Office announced that the queen in an
unprecendented move has stripped Ceausescu of an honorary
knighthood ``as a mark of revulsion at the abuse of human rights in
Romania for which President Ceausescu is responsible.''
   She will return his award, The Star of the Socialist Republic of
Romania First Class.
   Like the Norwegian monarch, the British queen honored Ceausescu
a decade ago when he was regarded as a sort of liberal in the
Communist bloc.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, on the steps of her
No. 10 Downing St. residence, saluted Romanians for having ``taken
liberty for themselves.''
   ``We should spare a thought for the very courageous people who
were not prepared to knuckle under in a bloodstained tyranny ...
and who paid for it with their lives,'' she said.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, current president of the
European Community, said as he arrived home from a two-day visit to
East Germany, ``The Romanians are free, Europe lives, it's great
news for everyone.''

   Romanian-Americans reacted with joy and surprise Friday to the
triumphant revolt against the man one woman called ``an absolutely
pathological character.''
   ``We are free, we are free, finally we are free!'' said Lucian
Cruceanu, a spokesman for Romanian Faith and Freedom Coalition in
Los Angeles. ``That is the first words they told me on the phone
(from Romania) this morning.''
   President Nicolae Ceausescu was ousted from power by an outraged
public after a week of protests in which thousands reportedly died.
The revolt ended 24 years of oppression and brought down the last
hard-line rule in the Soviet bloc.
   The Rev. Constantine Alesce of the Holy Trinity Romanian
Orthodox Church in Los Angeles called Ceausescu ``the worst
dictator that ever existed on the face of the Earth. We just prayed
that Christmas would bring the greatest gift to Romania, the
freedom ... of the country.''
   Dr. Virginia Sulica, a Washington, D.C., physician with family
and friends in Romania, said she had visited the country recently
and ``people did not have electricity, did not have food. I came
out very upset, but I'm very happy now. I think this is wonderful
news for everybody.''
   ``We all expected it to happen. Unfortunately, it happened with
bloodshed. We hope now that's over with. It was the last country to
go, but that man, that Ceausescu, was an absolutely pathological
character. It's the only way I can explain it.''
   The most famous Romanian exile in the United States, Olympic
gymnast Nadia Comaneci, had no public comment. She has been
incognito for the past 1{ weeks, after criticism arose over her
purported romance with a married Romanian immigrant.
   Ms. Comaneci, 28, who became world famous as a teen-ager with
her unprecedented perfect scores in the 1976 Olympics, escaped her
country last month. She was last seen in public at a Pompano Beach,
Fla., hotel on Dec. 12.
   Viorel Catarama, 33, of Hinsdale, Ill., who came to this country
in 1982 and is now an American citizen, said ``happy is not enough
to say. I'm just trying to find the proper words to say.''
   Referring to the victims of the uprising, he added, ``My heart
is with the people who died. ... They paid the price but it's worth
it in a way.''
   He said Romanian-Americans planned a weekend rally at Chicago's
City Hall to celebrate the revolt. In Los Angeles, a Friday evening
rally was planned.
   Catarama, now a U.S. citizen and owner of a construction
company, said, ``I hope for the best, I hope for democracy, I hope
for freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to express
yourself, and most of all now I'd like to see the president being
brought to justice.''
   The Rev. George Gage, parish priest at St. Mary's Romanian
Orthodox Church in Chicago, who fled Romania in 1981, called
Ceacescu a ``butcher'' and said many priests were killed by the
regime.
   Dana Mester, 25, of New York City, who left Romania five years
ago, was at a party, celebrating with other Romanian friends.
   ``My radio came on to wake me up and when I heard, I jumped out
of bed. ... People had been saying Romania was the only country
that didn't do anything. I'm just so happy. ... After they shot
people, I was sure the dissent would end and nothing would happen.
But then this morning, Oh my God!''

<HEAD>Black Leaders Want National Guard in Miami</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black leaders in Miami have asked Gov. Bob Martinez
to send in the National Guard for fear their communities may be
ignored by police loyal to a convicted Hispanic officer.
   Martinez took no action in response to the request received
Friday in a letter from the NAACP but said he has faith in the
local police department, said his press secretary, Jon Peck.
   ``The governor has been fully briefed about security
arrangements in Miami and around the state,'' Peck said. ``He's
comfortable that everything that can be done is being done at this
point.''
   Johnnie McMillian, president of the Miami-Dade chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, wrote
the governor Thursday asking the state to assume responsibilty for
law enforcement in Dade County.
   ``There is an immediate crisis in the ability of the police
department in Dade County to provide protection for their
citzenry,'' her letter said.
   The letter was approved by the NAACP's regional office in
Atlanta and received support from other Miami black leaders,
including two prominent ministers. But the black leaders said they
knew of no specific incidents of lapses in police protection in
black neighborhoods.
   Police Chief Perry Anderson, Mayor Xavier Suarez and spokesmen
for the city's police union and Hispanic Officers Association all
said the letter was unwarranted.
   ``There isn't any reason for any kind of alarm,'' Anderson said
at a news conference. ``We'll continue to perform (our) duties in a
professional manner.''
   He emphasized that no unprofessional behavior would be
tolerated, but added, ``I think the emotion _ pro, con, favorable,
unfavorable _ reaction to the verdict is somewhat understandable.''
   Officer William Lozano was found guilty of two counts of
manslaughter Dec. 7 in the deaths of two black men. Motorcyclist
Clement Lloyd died after being shot by Lozano, and his passenger
Allan Blanchard died from injuries when the vehicle crashed.
   Their deaths Jan. 16 sparked three nights of racial riots.
Lozano's conviction was applauded in the black community, but
police officers viewed the verdict as a restriction of their right
to protect themselves in the line of duty.
   Several officers have worn black bands on their badges or black
wristbands _ normally a symbol of mourning _ to protest the
conviction.
   McMillian said she wants the National Guard to serve as the
local police until the department can prove it isn't divided and
can act impartially.
   The police chief denied that there was significant discord among
officers within the department, noting, however, ``We must all
attempt to work togther to solve our differences.''
   Suarez said the letter shows a lack of confidence in Anderson,
who is black. The mayor held a meeting last week with the leaders
of the city's police union and black and Hispanic associations to
discuss reports of police neglect.
   ``The one thing that came out of the meeting is a commitment
that there would be absolute professionalism,'' Suarez said. ``I am
convinced of that, now more than ever, because there is more
communication between the groups.''
   McMillian said she decided to send the letter after hearing
about a possible work slowdown and an unsubstantiated report of a
Hispanic officer hesitating before responding to a backup call.
   ``If I needed police protection, I would not feel comfortable
calling the police because of the attitude of some of the
officers,'' she said.

<HEAD>Drug Traffickers Slain in Colombia, Turf War Feared</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The slaying of a cocaine lord last week
may have touched off a bloody war by mid-level traffickers fighting
to take his place in the notorious Medellin cartel, police were
quoted Friday as saying.
   The national police investigations chief, Col. Oscar Eduardo
Pelaez, said Thursday six men were found dead at a south Bogota
dump. At least four of the victims, who were found Wednesday,
belonged to the slain cocaine boss' group, the official said.
   Four other bodies were found in a resort town late Thursday, and
five men died in a Bogota prison earlier in the week in a turf
fight between prisoners of rival drug organizations.
   Some officials had been predicting violence between rival cartel
factions since police shot and killed Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha in a
Dec. 15 gunfight on the country's northern coast.
   Rodriguez Gacha, the Medellin cartel's No. 2 leader, died with
his 17-year-old son, four bodyguards and another trafficker.
   Bogota's El Tiempo newspaper Friday quoted police sources as
saying that Rodriguez Gacha's organization of about 2,000 men had
been thrown into chaos by their leader's death.
   ``Some of them have given up their arms, others have fled, and
others have returned to their normal activities,'' said an
unidentified police official quoted by the paper.
   However, El Tiempo added that some officials fear that mid-level
traffickers are trying to take control of the dead drug lord's
operation and reorganize it.
   The six men whose bodies were found at the dump were apparently
killed as a result of internal power struggles in the cartel, said
Pelaez. He told reporters at a news conference the victims had been
gagged and shot, and their bodies showed signs of torture.
   One of the bodies matched witnesses' descriptions of a man who
drove a bus bomb into the secret police headquarters in Bogota on
Dec. 6, Pelaez said. The bus, loaded with about 1,100 pounds of
dynamite, exploded moments later, killing 63 people and injuring
about 1,000.
   Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, the secret police chief, had accused
Rodriguez Gacha of ordering the attack with the No. 1 man in the
Medellin cartel, Pablo Escobar. He remains at large.
   Police found four more bodies late Thursday along a road leading
from the capital to the resort town of Melgar, 55 miles to the
south. El Espectador newspaper, citing police sources, reported
Friday that the deaths were the result of battles between feuding
criminals groups.
   A police spokesman told The Associated Press by telephone that
he could not say whether the victims had worked for Rodriguez Gacha.
   Five men died Tuesday when two bands of prisoners battled with
knives at a Bogota jail. Police said Rodriguez Gacha's men attacked
a group of prisoners of a rival group that had been fighting with
the drug trafficker for control of emerald mines in central
Colombia.
   The family of Rodriguez Gacha issued a statement to the news
media Friday saying his ``battles, political ideals, and
convictions had been buried with him.''
   The statement, signed by two brothers of the trafficker, said
the family had no ``dark desire for vengeance or retaliation'' and
wanted peace for the country.

<TEXT>
   The ``Cholos'' infantry company of
the Panamanian Defense Forces earned the respect of U.S. troops who
fought them.
   ``It took us a day and half. They stood and fought,'' said a
U.S. officer Friday. ``Roger that, sir'' one of his men added.
   The Cholos held stubbornly to their positions at Fort Amador, an
installation at the southern entrance of the Panama Canal that was
shared by U.S. and Panamanian forces.
   Some U.S. forces had been moved secretly into the residential
areas on the U.S side of the base. They moved out at 12:45 a.m.
Wednesday as the assault on Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
government began.
   U.S. forces were received with some enthusiasm by the general
public, although many residents of this city, wracked by savage
looting and littered with debris, were too frightened to go out on
the streets.
   Marine Lance Cpl. Tracy Scott Jones of Dallas said that after
the shock of the first day's battle, ``People were cheering us on.
They are on our side. They clapped as we rolled through the
streets. There was no hostility.''
   Lance Cpl. William Young of Seattle said civilians were
``friendly. They give us the thumbs up sign.''
   ``When you go out on a mission at night the situation is pretty
tense. You just look at the darkness and all you can see are the
shapes of people,'' said Young. ``But, then when you go out in the
day, people are pretty friendly.''
   A busload of civilians passing by the Nicaraguan Embassy on
Friday morning waved white hankerchiefs and cheered the U.S.
soldiers standing by their armored cars.
   The Americans, who cordoned off the embassy following rumors
that Noriega was there, smiled and waved back.
   Language was a problem. A young driver who wanted some
Panamanians to clear a roadway kept yelling at a Panamanian about a
``vehicle'' as the Panamanians looked puzzled.
   ``Say `car' instead of vehicle,'' another soldier said. ``It's
easier to understand.''

   Israelis lighted candles in their homes Friday
as Jews worldwide began celebrating the eight-day Festival of
Lights or Hanukkah, marking the victory of a Jewish rebellion over
Syrians 2,000 years ago.
   The festivities came during yet another day of violence in the
occupied territories, where Palestinians have been battling Israeli
occupiers. Israeli soldiers shot and killed three Palestinians,
Arab reports said.
   Throughout Israel, Hanukkah celebrations went on. Bakeries sold
special sugar-coated doughnuts that are a holiday tradition in
Israel.
   Israeli newspapers reported that a bakery in Tel Aviv baked what
may be the world's largest doughnut to mark the holiday. The Yediot
Ahronot newspaper said the jelly doughnut weighed 26 pounds.
   Hanukkah marks the victory of the Jews over the Greco-Syrian
kingdom in 165 B.C. The kingdom had tried to impose its culture on
the Jews and desecrated the holy temple in Jerusalem with statues
of Greek gods. Jews rose in revolt and drove out the Syrians.
   According to legend, when the Jews entered Jerusalem and tried
to rekindle the temple's eternal flame, they found enough oil for
only one day. But the oil miraculously lasted eight days.
   To commemorate the miracle, Jews light candles at sunset for
eight consecutive days. The candles are placed in an eight-branch
candelabra called a menorah.
   One candle is lighted the first day, and a new candle is used
each day until eight burn in the menorah.

   Justice William J. Brennan Jr. cleared the way
Friday for a Jewish group to erect a menorah on the steps of the
City-County Building in Pittsburgh for the start of Hanukkah.
   Brennan vacated a ruling made just hours before by a panel of
the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals that would have prevented the
display, court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said.
   The eight-day Jewish festival of lights began at sundown Friday.
   Brennan's action reinstated a preliminary injunction issued
Wednesday against the city by a U.S. district court judge, Arberg
said.
   City officials had refused to allow the Jewish group Chabad to
set up an 18-foot menorah next to a Christman tree. City officials
said they had not authorized the area outside the building to be
used as a public forum.
   A federal judge Thursday denied a request from the city to delay
the lower court's decision. The city immediately appealed, and
Judge Joseph Weis of the 3rd Circuit Court temporarily stopped the
federal judge's order until three members of his court could review
it.
   Chabad and three Jewish residents sued the city a week ago,
alleging their civil rights were violated by the exclusion of the
menorah from the holiday display. The menorah was part of the
display for most of the 1980s.
   In a hearing before Senior U.S. District Judge Barron McCune,
Chabad lawyer Nathan Lewin argued that the area in front of the
building is a public forum where free speech, including display of
religious symbols, cannot be denied.
   McCune agreed, ordering the city to allow Chabad to erect the
menorah in the same place it had been in 1986. That was the year
the city was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union over the
menorah and a Nativity scene at the City-County Building.
   The Supreme Court ruled in July that the menorah, placed next to
the Christmas tree, was constitutional, but that the Nativity scene
was unconstitutional because it was not part of a general holiday
display.
   Pittsburgh Deputy Solicitor George Specter told Weis the area in
front of the building was not a public forum simply because city
officials did not stop demonstrations from taking place.
   ``There is no evidence in this area at all that the city of
Pittsburgh even openly and intentionally authorized the use of the
building as a public forum,'' Specter said.
   Another Chabad lawyer, Elliot Katz, argued the city created the
public forum by allowing the menorah to be displayed in past years.

   The Deep Freeze snapped temperature records Friday in more than
125 cities from the Rockies to the East Coast, making it one of the
worst cold spells on record, the National Weather Service said.
   The temperature dipped to minus 47 in the southeastern Montana
town of Broadus _ the coldest spot Friday in the Lower 48 states.
   It was so cold in the Adirondack Mountains in New York that a
bobsled competition was canceled. And Hot Springs, Va., wasn't even
lukewarm.
   ``It's just indescribably cold,'' Police Lt. Carl Goolsby said
Friday in Memphis, Tenn., where people ``just don't know how to
dress for this weather.''
   The bitter cold caused concern for citrus growers, farmers and
those who care for the homeless, the poor and the elderly.
Utilities reported record usage as customers tried to keep warm.
   In New York City, where the arctic chill sent 9,200 people to
shelters Thursday night, demonstrators erected four tombstones
outside City Hall to mark the deaths of four homeless people who
died of exposure while sleeping in the city subway system last
weekend.
   ``These tragic deaths have gone virtually unnoticed, and we more
affluent New Yorkers seem to have let our hearts grow colder and
more hardened than the bitter winter,'' said David Beseda of the
Coalition for the Homeless.
   Nationwide, nearly 60 deaths have been blamed on the week-long
cold spell. The cold was blamed Friday for the death of a
35-year-old Oklahoma City man who died while walking a half-mile
home after his car apparently ran out of gas.
   ``If it gets cold enough long enough, we've got a disaster,''
said William Moon, sales manager for Zellwin Farms in Jacksonville,
Fla., which has everything from carrots and lettuce to parsley and
radishes in the ground in northwest Orange County.
   The strain on utilities caused scattered power outages and
prompted Potomac Electric Power in Washington, D.C., to temporarily
cut its voltage by 5 percent Friday morning to prevent blackouts.
   Potomac Electric Power spokesman Tom Welle said oil-fired
generators were using fuel quicker than the pipeline supplying the
plant could deliver it.
   Among the cities to set cold records were: Beckley, W.Va., minus
13; Bismarck, N.D., minus 32; Calico Rock, Ark., minus 5; Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, minus 19; Del Rio, Texad, 17; Duluth, Minn., minus
22; Paducah, Ky., minus 10, Kansas City, Mo., minus 19; Omaha,
Neb., minus 25.
   The National Weather Service said more temperature records were
expected to topple throughout Friday.
   ``The number of record lows today was as great as that of
Christmas Day in 1983, and establishes this cold wave, along with
those of December 1983 and February 1899 as one of the most severe
of all time for the central and eastern U.S.,'' said Hugh Crowther
of the weather service.
   A reading of 23 degrees below zero in Indianapolis was the
coldest reading of the century in that city. It was minus 13 in Hot
Springs, Va.
   In the Adirondacks on Friday, a two-man bobsled competition
sponsored by the U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton Federation was called
off because temperatures reached minus 18 degrees at the top of
Mount Van Hoevenberg.
   The cold wasn't keeping shoppers home, however.
   ``'Tis the season and everyone's here doing their last minute
shopping,'' said Joan Lincoln, marketing director at Marketplace
Mall in Rochester, N.Y.
   Lincoln said many people put off their shopping until the last
minute because of December's wintry weather and ``Now they have no
choice.''
   The only readings above freezing in the nation were confined to
Florida, the Pacific Coast and southwestern deserts.
   Weather forecasters promise a return to more seasonal weather by
Christmas. It won't be warm, just not as cold.
   The lingering cold meant an early Christmas break for some
workers and students, as schools closed in Tennessee, Ohio,
Missouri, and Minnesota. Snow, sleet and ice shut down the bus
system in New Orleans, stranding commuters.
   ``This is state-of-the-art cold,'' said Ronnie Perkins, who
arrived for work Friday in downtown Nashville wearing a snowsuit
and face-covering muffler. ``I mean, we are talking high-tech
weather as we go into the '90s. This is the sultan of frigid.''
   On the Mississippi River, about 1,000 barges remained stalled in
the St. Louis area because of a massive bank-to-bank ice jam at the
confluence of the Missouri River, a Coast Guard official said. It
was the fourth straight day that river traffic had been restricted
between St. Louis and Cairo, Ill., because of ice and low water.
   And the cold prompted Missouri's major utilities to declare a
moratorium on shutting off service to non-paying customers. They
also have pledged to try to restore service to customers who had
been shut off.
   ``It's really wonderful,'' said Georgia Rusan, chief of family
services for St. Louis' Human Development Corp., which administers
emergency heating assistance to city residents. ``I know it will
take a lot of pressure off people and brighten their holidays.''

<HEAD>Petition Drive Puts King Holiday On Hold in Arizona</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A paid state holiday honoring slain civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr., a political quagmire in Arizona for
years, again has become a dream deferred.
   A bill trading in the Columbus Day holiday for King Day cleared
the Legislature earlier this year and was signed by Gov. Rose
Mofford, but opponents of the King holiday and fans of Christopher
Columbus formed an uneasy alliance to hold up the law pending a
possible statewide referendum.
   Secretary of State Jim Shumway declared the holiday suspended
and said he believed the groups had filed enough signatures to
force a referendum next November.
   State Rep. Sandra Kennedy, a backer of the holiday, called an
opponent, president Pat Quaranta of the Arizona American Italian
Club, ``a bigot'' and said she feared a statewide vote on the
holiday because ``this state is almost Mississippi.''
   Tempe architect Julian Sanders, a King opponent who started the
referendum drive, said he didn't accept ``the argument that we're
going to be embarrassed by having Arizonans express themselves at
the polls.''
   Sanders and his backers gathered about 40,000 signatures on the
referendum petitions, while Quaranta and his allies gathered about
45,000. It only takes 43,500 valid voter signatures to force a
referendum.
   Supporters of the bill said they would campaign for the holiday
if the measure gets on the ballot. They also said they were still
considering a legal challenge to the petitions or introduction of a
new bill in the Legislature.
   Controversy over a King holiday has dogged the state's
politicians for years. Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt declared a
holiday by executive proclamation as he was about to start a
presidential bid in 1986. But Republican Attorney General Bob
Corbin called it an illegal usurpation of the Legislature's role
and Republican Gov. Evan Mecham rescinded it days before it would
have taken effect.
   The furor fueled a recall drive against Mecham, but a Senate
Court of Impeachment ousted him on other grounds before the recall
vote could be held and the battle over King shifted back to the
Republican-controlled Legislature.
   GOP lawmakers offered to put the King Day issue on the ballot.
Supporters refused to go along, saying privately that they feared
such a bill would be defeated and publicly that they believed it
would be divisive and harm the state's image.
   Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, who succeeded Mecham, upped the
ante during a special session this year when she got business
leaders to say that a King holiday was needed to help Arizona's
chances of landing a Super Bowl.
   Lawmakers then agreed to King holiday, but only if it supplanted
Columbus Day so that state and local governments would not have any
additional expense.
   That angered two groups of voters: those who didn't believe the
civil rights leader deserved a holiday in the first place, and
those who wanted a holiday for King but did not want Columbus Day
downgraded.
   Quaranta said his faction favored a federal-style holiday that
would combine the state's separate Lincoln and Washington holidays
into a single Presidents Day to make room for a King Day without
affecting Columbus Day. Sanders said his faction opposed the
federal-style holiday.
   Supporters of the King Day bill, meanwhile, remain split over
whether to challenge the petitions in court, return to the
Legislature for a new bill that would effectively wipe out all the
petition signatures, or dig in for a campaign next year.
   ``I'm afraid of a vote,'' said the bill's sponsor, Sen. Carolyn
Walker.
   Babbitt, announcing the formation of a group to support King
Day, said he was ready to fight it out at the voting booth instead
of in the courthouse.
   ``Ultimately, people have the right to decide,'' he said,
echoing others who have said it would be hypocritical to deny
people a vote on the issue when King struggled for years to expand
voting rights.

   Havel, a dissident playwright whose works were banned, emerged
as the opposition leader during a peaceful revolution that began in
mid-November and ended four decades of Communist rule.
   Dubcek was Communist Party chief in 1968 and led the ``Prague
Spring'' of reform that was crushed by a Soviet-led invasion.
   CTK quoted a statement issued after Friday's meeting as saying:
``In agreement with the publicly expressed will of the Czechoslovak
public, we recognize as a respected representative ... for the
office of president Mr. Vaclav Havel and for the office of Federal
Assembly chairman Mr. Alexander Dubcek.
   ``We express our conviction that this manifested will is in
agreement with the spirit of Czechoslovak mutuality.''
   The talks also produced an agreement on restructuring
Parliament, which is to vote Dec. 29 on the two positions, the
agency said, but no details were available Friday.
   Although the majority of posts in the Cabinet are filled by
non-Communists, members of the party still dominate Parliament. The
Dec. 29 session is to be televised live.

   Barnard, who had just turned 29, was a nine-year veteran Army
infantryman and Ranger. He was the son of a Methodist minister, the
Rev. Marilyn Barnard, and her husband Raymond, of Hallstead, Pa.
   Barnard married his high-school sweetheart, Tammy, and they had
a 10-year-old daughter and a younger set of twins.
   ``Larry was a fine kid,'' said Jerry Thomson, athletic director
at Blue Ridge High School, where Barnard played football and other
sports.

   The 19-year-old infantryman was a native of Buena Park, Calif.
Brown's mother, Julie Otto, also of Buena Park, said her son had
phoned the family a week before his death, saying his unit had been
put on alert and was preparing to go into combat.
   Friends and relatives described the blond, blue-eyed young man
as a classic ``California boy'' who had looked forward to joining
the Armed Forces when he was still a student at Magnolia High
School in Anaheim. He had played trombone in the marching band.

enter the service in February. He completed infantry training at
Fort Benning, Ga., last summer.
   ``He liked survival sorts of stuff and hunting and fishing,''

   Steve Helin, who was not injured, works as a civilian financial
analyst for an organization that oversees operation of the Panama
Canal. The couple have two children, Stephanie, 16, and Tracey, 20.
   ``She was a very creative, intelligent person,'' Jane Sheaffer,

   EDITOR'S NOTE: The following is from a pool dispatch.
   FORT AMADOR, Panama (AP) _ U.S. military officers showed off a
house near Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's barracks where
they said he ``kept his Brazilian witches.''
   Inside they confiscated a packet of cocaine which had been
wrapped in a banana leaf and placed in a freezer.
   It was part of the 50 pounds of cocaine they said they found in
the Panamanian portion of Fort Amador, a shared U.S.-Panamanian
military facility.
   U.S. authorities said a bucket containing a rusty-red looking
substance in an upstairs bathroom was blood used in rituals.
   Spread out on a pallet in an upstairs office were two dead,
smelly fish that looked like they had been placed on a bed of rice
with slices of carrots. The fish were ceremoniously adorned with
colored ribbons. Something in the shape of a rotted papaya split in
half was stuck with dozens of toothpicks.
   On a nearby desk were bowls of popcorn _ popped and unpopped. It
was cluttered with dead flowers, broken statues and a newspaper
photo of Noriega.
   ``General Noriega kept his Brazilian witches here. You all know
he was a big believer in witchcraft,'' said Col. Mike Snell of the
Task Force Bayonnette Command.
   ``This was the brewery for the witches, if you will,'' Snell
said.
   He said the cocaine had not been analyzed but added ``we're sure
it's cocaine.''
   As he began his tour, Snell said ``We're going to see some
things that remind you of voodoo cults.''
   He said Noriega had been spotted at the house in the last
several months.
   The cocaine had been removed but a small residue of a powdery
looking substance remained in the freezer.
   Snell said pipe bombs had been found in the house which
subsequently has been searched repeatedly for booby traps.
   Because of the continuing concern about booby traps, lights in
the house could not be turned on. Even with a flashlight it was
impossible to verify that the bucket of blood was that.
   In a bedroom, gold spikes heels, pantyhose, face cream and other
women's garmets were left.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: The following is from a pool dispatch filed by
Kevin Marida of The Dallas Morning News, Kathy Lewis of the Houston
Post, Dick Thompson of Time magazine and Bill Clayton of the
Houston Chronicle.
   FORT AMADOR, Panama _ Military intelligence officers were
sifting through papers contained in Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
offices Friday, hoping to find clues to his whereabouts.
   ``That's the purpose _ try to evaluate it for intelligence
value,'' said Lt. Tod Furtado of the Army intelligence division.
``If there's something we can use to track the names of people who
might know his whereabouts, that's what we want to do.''
   ``The most important thing now is finding Noriega,'' he added.
   Reporters were given a tour of offices used by Noriega and the
Panamanian Defense Forces in a building on the Panamanian side of
Fort Amador _ a military installation that until Wednesday was
shared by Panama and the United States.
   It appears Noriega was careful not to leave many secrets lying
around, said Furtado. Even his calendars provided few clues about
his activities, he said.
   Military troops seized the building Wednesday morning after the
shelling of PDF barracks on the base.
   Military troops found 500 to 600 weapons inside, including a
variety of machine guns, hand guns and rifles. The tour of
Noriega's quarters revealed an opulent lifestyle and pornography.
   Military officials said they found a number of phallic symbols
and pornographic photos in Noriega's personal office. In another
tour of PDF headquarters Friday, photos of nude women in graphic
poses were lying around in Noriega's office.
   ``I couldn't see President Bush keeping crap like that,''
Furtado said.
   Military officials found one envelope, dated sometime in
September and stamped official, that contained nothing but
pornographic photos. It was sent from a Panamanian consulate in
another country with the note: ``Enjoy the good times. To the
seditious ones _ give them the stick.''
   The two floors of offices contained Noriega's collection of
stuffed bears dressed in military uniforms, two display cases of
frog statues, a video wrist watch and a Sharp Wizard computer
diary. On Noriega's personal desk was a bottle of Krog champagne.
He had an Acer computer and Sony stereo equipment.
   ``He lived a very opulent life,'' said Furtado.
   Col. Mike Snell, the Task Force Bayonet commander, said ``If
you've got to be a petty dictator, you might as well live well, I
guess.''
   Noriega kept a conference room and library at the building,
which was layered inside with plush carpeting.
   There was a decorated Christmas tree upstairs and one downstairs.
   In the courtyard was a parrot in a cage.

   Fourteen bodies were found in the
central hill district a day after pro-government vigilantes killed
at least 170 suspected militants in another part of the country,
military officials said Friday.
   Elsewhere, eight other people were killed Friday in the ethnic
violence, officials said.
   The officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said the latest bodies were found in the Kandy district Thursday
night and early Friday, and were believed to be Sinhalese radicals
killed by vigilantes. They said the victims had been shot and the
bodies burned to prevent identification.
   On Thursday, officials said 170 radicals had been killed in the
southern Hambantota district since Wednesday night.
   In other areas of the country, at least four radicals were
killed by police and three civilians and a soldier were killed by
the militants, the officials said.
   At least 6,000 people have been killed since Sinhalese radicals
began trying to overthrow the government in July 1987. The radicals
say the government made too many concessions in a peace agreement
designed to end a civil war started by Tamil separatists in 1983
that has taken about 8,000 lives.
   Three-quarters of Sri Lanka's 16 million people are ethnic
Sinhalese. Tamils make up 18 percent of the population and claim
discrimination by the Sinhalese, who control the government and
military.

   Leftist rebels said Friday they
would observe a cease-fire for the Christmas holidays, and the
government promised to lift a curfew imposed because of the latest
guerrilla offensive.
   A statement from the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation

Jan. 2 so Salvadorans could enjoy the holidays in peace.
   It also said, without elaboration, that the guerrillas had asked
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar ``to reopen a
process of real negotiations to end the war.''
   President Alfredo Cristiani's government said the 11 p.m.-5 a.m.
curfew would end on Christmas Eve.
   The curfew was imposed in November after the rebels began their
most intense and prolonged attack of the 10-year-old war, bringing
the battle to San Salvador for most of the month.

<BYLINE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with court members receiving threatening
letters. ^By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colleagues of a federal appellate judge who
was killed by a parcel bomb similar to one that fatally injured a
civil rights lawyer have since received threatening letters,
sources said Friday.
   The Justice Department, meanwhile, said four threatening letters
delivered this week bore physical evidence linking them to the
bombs.
   The letters to the judges were among those that surfaced after
parcel bombs killed 11th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert S.
Vance on Dec. 16 and Savannah, Ga., alderman and attorney Robert E.
Robinson two days later, said the sources.
   A letter addressed to Vance was also among those delivered, said
the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said he was unaware
that letters had been delivered to judges on the 11th Circuit.
   But he said there was ``solid evidence'' on four threatening
letters delivered this week linking them to the parcel bombs that
killed Vance and Robinson as well as two others found this week.
   Parcel bombs were also found at the the Jacksonville, Fla.,
chapter of the NAACP and the 11th Circuit courthouse in Atlanta.
Both were defused without incident.
   Runkel declined to describe the common characteristics of the
letters and the parcel bombs.
   But stamps, typing or other markings on the packages and letter
envelopes may give FBI crime lab specialists important clues.
   Comparing the typing on the letters and packages may enable the
FBI to determine if the same typewriter was used to address the
parcels and write the letters.
   Runkel said the physical evidence may also provide a link to
four other letters sent in August that declared war on the 11th
Circuit.
   The earlier letters, sent from Atlanta, threatened poison gas
attacks on population centers until ``widespread terror'' forces
the 11th Circuit to ``adopt the impartial and equitable treatment
of all.''
   Before Vance's death, the 11th Circuit had 10 active judges. The
Atlanta-based court considers appeals from federal district courts
in Florida, Georgia and Alabama.
   While the FBI continued its investigation of the bombings in the
deep South, a state judge was seriously injured by a parcel bomb in
his apartment in Hagerstown, Md.
   The FBI sent agents to assist local police and the Bureau of
Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms to investigate the blast that injured
Circuit Judge John Corderman.
   The FBI-led investigation has been concentrating on possible
racial motivations for the killings in Georgia and Alabama.
   Agents have been combing Vance's docket to determine if any of
his decisions, particularly in civil rights cases, may have
motivated the slaying.
   In September, Vance wrote an opinion in a Jacksonville school
desegregation case that was a victory for the NAACP. A three-judge
panel of the 11th Circuit unanimously reversed a lower court's
ruling that Jacksonville could stop busing students because the
school system was racially integrated.
   Robinson had represented the NAACP on an unrelated school
desegregation case involving Savannah schools.
   Investigators have found physical evidence linking the bombs,
which were made with nails and explosive material. The bomb parcels
all were mailed from towns in Georgia.
   Vance was killed in his suburban Birmingham, Ala., home after
opening a package. Robinson was fatally injured by a bomb that
exploded when he opened a similar package sent to his law office.
   Meanwhile, Savannah police said that security would be tight for
Robinson's funeral Saturday.
   Benjamin Hooks, director of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, is expected to speak at the service.
   The Justice Department said Deputy Attorney General Donald B.
Ayer, James P. Turner, acting head of the civil rights division,
and William Lucas, director of the department's Office of Liaison
Services would attend the funeral.

   It was the death of her 15-year-old
son that gave Wendy Stanek the will and guts to infiltrate the drug
menace corrupting Crystal Falls. But when she did, it hit closer to
home than she thought.
   The mother of six gathered enough evidence to bring cocaine and
marijuana trafficking charges against 23 people this week. Among
those arrested was a counselor at a group home for troubled youth.
   ``One of the guys I busted was my lifelong friend and he came to
me and I said, `Oh my God, I don't want to hear that,''' said
Stanek. Still, she turned him in.
   The 35-year-old woman, who made more than 20 drug buys during a
year of working for a narcotics team, added, ``I want people to
know they can do it. Anybody can do it.''
   The suspects were arraigned Tuesday in a marathon session in
Iron County District Court. Michigan State Police who headed the
sting declined to talk about Stanek's role in dealing with what
they say was a problem commonly known in the Upper Peninsula's
Crystal Falls and nearby Iron River.
   They said, however, that community support and tips are
important to their work.
   During the year she spent undercover, Stanek was amazed at how
easily cocaine flowed in Crystal Falls, an old-fashioned logging
town.
   A local health worker tried two years ago to start a drug
awareness group there. He was encouraged to stop. ``People just
didn't want to admit we had a problem,'' Jerry Schoup said.
   After Stanek made her first covert drug buy, dealers pestered
her with more offers than police could handle. ``It was a piece of
cake, in and out and just like buying groceries,'' she said.
   She was shocked at who was doing the selling _ friends and
childhood acquaintances.
   ``It's scum like you that sell it to the kids,'' Stanek said she
told a suspect who called her after Tuesday's arrests.
   The road that led Stanek to the Upper Peninsula Substance
Enforcement Team began with the death of her son, Ryan. He would
have turned 16 on June 30, 1987, but died days earlier, a passenger
in a car that crashed when a friend grabbed at the steering wheel.
   Tucked in a shoe of one of the passengers, Stanek said, she
found a marijuana pipe. Police filed no charges.
   The next day, Stanek began a log of the drug traffic she saw in
Crystal Falls. A year later, a friend in the Iron County sheriff's
department put her in touch with the newly formed UPSET. She began
the undercover buys.
   The biggest threat to the operation came from Stanek's own
children, who were unaware their mother was working undercover. Her
eldest son, 15-year-old Jamey, was upset at her consorting with
drug dealers.
   ``He said, `Keep your druggy buddies out of our house,''' Stanek
said. ``They were getting angry with me.''
   That and the suicide two weeks ago of one of Stanek's daughter's
friends ended the undercover work. The 14-year-old girl's death was
the second teen suicide in Crystal Falls this year. For Stanek, who
believes the community's drug problem plays a role in the suicides,
``it was just too much.''
   Stanek's kids now know about their mother, the drug buys and the
arrests.
   ``I feel good about what my mom did,'' 8-year-old Joey said.
   ``I think it's good because I know there's been a lot of drugs
going on around here for a long time,'' said Jared, 11. ``Some
people aren't happy because they think drugs are cool. ... I think
they're stupid.''
   And it makes his brother's death ``easier,'' he said.
   Stanek had two notable receptions to her work. One was a death
threat. ``Big deal,'' she said.
   The other was a box of chocolates delivered at her door. The
greeting said ``Thank you, Wendy, for saving our kids.''

   Israel television broadcast unique footage
Friday of a former French hostage in Lebanon interviewing Moslem
Shiite prisoners of an Israeli-backed militia.
   The taping by Roger Auque, who was released in November 1987
after 10 months of captivity in Beirut, marks the first time
outsiders have been allowed in the South Lebanon Army's el-Khiam
prison.
   The Israeli-backed militia had never allowed Red Cross or U.N.
officials to enter the prison, which is just north of the Lebanese
town of Marjayoun.
   Prisoners interviewed by Auque said they were treated
adequately, but they expressed hope that Lebanese Shiite militias
would agree to a prisoner exchange with Israel.
   The television said the Defense Ministry agreed to allow Auque
to tape in the stark prison to show conditions are acceptable and
to increase pressure on the Lebanon's Shiite Amal and Hezbollah
militias to agree to a prisoner exchange with Israel.
   Israel television said the broadcast was made for a French
television network but gave no other details.
   The television said an estimated 300 prisoners, mainly Shiites,
are held in el-Khiam. The prisoners include both guerrillas and
criminal suspects.
   Israel has offered to swap the prisoners and Sheik Abdul-Karim
Obeid, a pro-Iranian Shiite cleric abducted by Israel in August,
for three Israeli servicemen and all other foreign hostages held in
Lebanon.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of people Friday were digging
up mass graves discovered in the forest district of Timisoara,
trying to find the remains of their friends and relatives killed in
last weekend's crackdown.
   Three such mass graves are believed to be holding as many as
4,500 corpses of people massacred by the dreaded security forces on
Saturday, Sunday and Monday. There was no independent confirmation
of the number of dead.
   Timisoara, 500 miles from Bucharest near the Yugoslav and
Hungarian border, was the center of protests that were brutally
suppressed by the regime of President Ceausescu, who was reported
overthrown Thursday.
   West German television, apparently showing footage provided by
Romanian TV, showed muddied, naked corpses being dug out and placed
on white sheets, one after the other.
   All had their feet tied together with wire. A dead boy, about
three or four years old, was shown lying on the ground.
   ``Not even Hitler killed his own children, and here they used
automatic machine gun bursts to strafe them down,'' said Slavomir
Gvozdenovic, editor of a literary review in Timisoara.
   The situation in this city of 350,000 people was chaotic, and
there did not seem any authority at all beyond the downtown opera
square.
   Vasile Todorescu, an electrician, said he was trying to find his
20-year-old son, who disappeared during the unrest.
   He said the corpses had been transported by garbage trucks to
the area and the drivers were later shot by the police so no
witnesses whould be left.
   Sorin Oprea, head of the Democratic Front of Romania, which
seems to be at least in partial control of Timisoara, said his
group does not recognize the new national leadership being set up
in Bucharest.
   ``We want all Romanian citizens to elect the country's new
leadership,'' said Oprea, a mechanic. ``In Bucharest they only
fought for two days while our struggle was much longer.''
   Oprea, 37, was interviewed at the downtown opera house which is
currently being used as the headquarters of the provisional
municipal leadership.
   He was wounded in the leg during clashes with the police and has
not slept for three days, he said.
   ``Our struggle is not yet over,'' Oprea said.
   People approaching the opera house were being searched by
plainclothes volunteers, some of whom were armed with automatic
rifles.
   The people's militia, as the volunteers call themselves,
captured their weapons from troops during the weekend fighting,
they said.
   About 1,000 activists were occupying the opera building Friday
night in front of which more than 20,000 people were still
rejoicing over the ouster of Ceausescu.

   The Security Council began considering a
resolution Friday that would condemn the U.S. invasion of Panama
and demand the immediate withdrawal of American troops.
   Nearly all nations on the council have denounced the United
States for its military action in Panama. The United States,
possibly joined by Britain, was considered certain to veto a
resolution condemning the invasion.
   The council scheduled a vote for Saturday afternoon on the
resolution introduced by the group of nations that profess
non-alignment.
   Council members wrestled with another dilemma Friday after
inviting Panama to speak on the invasion but disagreeing over which
of the rival ambassadors should be given the floor.
   On Thursday night, the council voted 14-0, with the United
States abstaining, to hear Panama's views but did not decide who
was the legitimate ambassador. The council then met in private
Friday to continue arguing the issue.
   The United States attacked to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
as Panama's leader.
   His supporters have demanded that Mirla Bellavita, Noriega's
choice for ambassador, be allowed to speak for Panama. President
Guillermo Endara, installed during the U.S. assault, appointed
Eduardo Vallarino ambassador and asked that he speak for the
country.
   The council will confer a degree of legitimacy on the government
of whichever representative it allows to speak.
   Panama had no U.N. ambassador when the invasion occurred.
Leonardo Kam, who had held the position, was promoted to foreign
minister in September and no replacement had been accredited.
   Vallarino attempted a peaceful takeover of Panama's U.N. Mission
on Friday, but Mrs. Bellavita told him her group will continue to
be the sole occupants of the office just north of U.N. headquarters
in New York.
   Vallarino left after the polite discussion with Mrs. Bellavita,
but said he would pursue his claim.
   ``We intend to take possession of these offices; we will do it
in a very orderly process,'' he said. ``However, we will not do
anything rash or violent.''
   During discussion Thursday, U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering
said ``there is only one legal representative of Panama, and that
representative is here,'' meaning Vallarino.
   Soviet Ambassador Alexander M. Belonogov said: ``I have quite an
opposite opinion on who exactly should represent Panama on the
Security Council.
   ``We cannot be a party to any exercise which will add legality,
any legality in the United Nations at this moment, to the
government which has been ... installed by the United States in
Panama.''
   U.S. officials said privately they were hoping to stall the
issue until Endara's government was firmly in control of Panama.
   Endara is widely believed to have been the winner in
presidential elections May 7, but the balloting was rejected and
nullified by Noriega.
   Of the 15 Security Council members, only Britain has
wholeheartedly endorsed the U.S. action.
   Canada criticized the invasion but said Noriega provoked it;
France condemned both Noriega's dictatorship and the invasion.
   The other council members were highly critical of the U.S.
action.

   The government suspended joint operations with
U.S. drug agents in the coca-growing Huallaga Valley, the U.S.
Embassy said Friday, apparently to protest the U.S. invasion of
Panama.
   Foreign Minister Guillermo Larco Cox said Peru was opening its
embassy in Panama City to people seeking political asylum.
   In Lima, police used tear gas to break up a protest outside the
U.S. Embassy and arrested 10 people. The demonstrators were members
of the governing Aprista Party's youth wing.
   The announcement of the suspension of anti-drug operations came
one day after President Alan Garcia said he would not attend the
Feb. 15 drug summit with President Bush and the leaders of Colombia
and Bolivia.
   ``I cannot meet with the leader of an invading nation,'' Garcia
said Thursday.
   The summit was to be held in Cartagena, Colombia, and include
Presidents Virgilio Barco of Colombia and Jaime Paz Zamora of
Bolivia.
   In an interview published Friday in a Lima newspaper, U.S.
Ambassador Anthony Quainton criticized Garcia's reaction to the
U.S. decision to send troops to Panama.
   Garcia said Thursday that the United States ``could seek to do
the same in Peru if it should think the (Peruvian) government isn't
doing enough to fight drug trafficking in the Huallaga Valley.''
   The Huallaga Valley is the world's single largest source of the
coca leaf, the raw material for making cocaine. The valley is the
focus of the U.S.-sponsored anti-narcotics campaign in Peru.
   U.S. drug agents have been carrying out operations since
September with Peruvian police from a U.S.-built base at Santa
Lucia in the Huallaga Valley. The agents accompany polie on daily
raids against clandestine airstrips and coca-processing
laboratories.
   Between 20 and 40 Americans, including agents, pilots and
mechanics, operate from the $3 million base, which is located in
the jungle about 200 miles northeast of Lima. Eight U.S.
helicopters are based at Santa Lucia for use in interdiction
operations.
   Bush has proposed spending $2.2 billion in the next four years
to combat the drug trade in Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. About $73
million has been earmarked for Peru this year in mostly police and
military assistance.
   Analysts estimate about $1 billion a year comes into Peru from
the drug trade. Garcia recently praised the Bush administration for
offering economic assistance to the Andean nations to offset losses
caused by the cutoff of drug dollars.
   Garcia has been highly critical of the U.S. actions in Panama,
and Wednesday recalled Peru's ambassador in Washington in protest.
   He said the intervention was motivated by the United States'
intention to break the Panama Canal treaties of 1977, which call
for Panama to take control of the waterway at the end of the
century.
   In an interview with the newspaper Expreso, Quainton said, ``I
cannot accept the Peruvian government's argument that says we have
acted in order to break the treaties. We recognize the treaties and
understand that they carry great importance for the whole
hemisphere.''
   Quainton called on Latin American countries to support the
U.S.-installed government of Guillermo Endara, who was elected in
May but was blocked from taking power by Noriega.
   He criticized Garcia's decision to recall his ambassador,
saying, ``If there are differences at this moment concerning
Panama, and obviously Garcia is not very happy, this shouldn't make
us lose sight of the common interests that we have.''

   Officials from the Northeast meet
Saturday in Washington to discuss heating fuel shortages amid a
backdrop of record freezing cold and dwindling energy supplies.
   The meeting will bring together representatives of the region's
utilities, pipeline companies, propane distributors, transportation
officials and state energy regulators.
   Assistant U.S. Energy Secretary John Easton said he hopes to
``find out where they (shortages) exist and how serious they are.
   ``We have been receiving a lot of anecdotal data and our
interest is to determine how real the situation is from the
perspective of suppliers and consumers,'' said Easton, who called
the weekend meeting.
   New England is experiencing its coldest December on record,
along with other parts of the country. On Friday, the arctic
temperatures snapped records in more than 125 cities from the
Rockies to the East Coast, making it one of the worst cold spells
on record, the National Weather Service said.
   Forecasters predict moderating weather following the weekend,
but this month's supercold has already drained energy sources.
   ``We've already used as much fuel as we normally would by the
middle of January,'' said Robert Gladden, a spokesman for Bay State
Gas Co., with 250,000 customers in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and
Maine.
   The Energy Department meeting will also include representatives
from the Plains states and as far south as Virginia _ all areas
which are also beginning to feel a fuel pinch due to unseasonably
cold weather.
   But officials said the focus of the meeting will generally
remain on New England, where the problem is considered more serious.
   A severe shortage of propane has prompted some companies to
impose restrictions on deliveries. Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin and
propane operators announced this week that deliveries would not be
made until tanks drop to 10 percent capacity and that fill-ups
would be limited to 50 percent of capacity.
   Easton said some help is expected for propane users. The
department has already taken steps to locate additional sources of
the fuel, including contacting the operators of the major propane
gas pipeline that supplies the Northeast.
   Texas Eastern, whose pipeline ends near Albany, N.Y., has
increased the flow of propane through the line by one-third, Easton
said.
   In addition, the high demand for the home heating oil has sent
prices soaring. Oil that was selling for 95 cents a gallon last
week in the region was selling for $1.14 this week.
   ``We are beginning to have some concerns about the supply of
heating oil if this weather continues,'' said Ned Tudi, vice
president of energy relations for Agway Energy Products in
Syracuse, N.Y.
   Electric utilities were also concerned about the cold. A
regionwide appeal was made to cut back usage as utilities predicted
record demand for the weekend.
   On Friday, Rhode Island Gov. Edward DiPrete sent a letter to
Admiral James D. Watkins, the U.S. secretary of energy, urging him
to ``facilitate the transportation of energy supplies to the
Northeast.''
   New Hampshire Gov. Judd Gregg released a letter Friday afternoon
telling the U.S. Customs Service in Washington ``an emergency
situation now exists in that propane supplies to both gas
distribution companies and retail propane dealers in my state are
critically short.''
   ``The situation makes it imperative that all transportation
equipment be used to bring added supplies of propane to my state
and the region,'' Gregg wrote.
   He asked for a waiver to allow the Bay State Gas Co. to charter
a Danish and an Italian ship to transport propane from the Gulf
Coast to terminals in New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania.

   Romanian journalists pledged Friday to
break the bonds of censorship that kept them tightly muzzled for
decades under the harsh regime of Nicolae Ceausescu.
   In the streets of Bucharest, jubilant Romanians lifted the car
of a Bulgarian reporter in gratitude for his honest reporting.
   Demonstrators marched to the state TV and radio where they took
over the michrophones and announced, ``We have won.''
   For hours, there were continuous, live TV broadcasts as people
took turns at the microphones in the jammed studios. It also showed
scenes of hundreds of thousands of people on the streets.
   Previously, state-run TV had broadcast only two hours a day;
most of that time was filled with footage of Ceausescu, who built a
personality cult in the media.
   Only hours after a popular uprising toppled Ceausescu, the state
news agency Agerpres issued a statement pledging to report honestly
on events at home and abroad.
   As the media in the rest of Eastern Europe became more open in
the wake of democratic reforms sweeping their countries, the
Romanian media remained staunchly loyal to Ceausescu's hard-line
regime, eulogizing him and keeping silent on the changes in the
rest of the Soviet bloc.
   ``The Romanian news agency Agerpres no longer needs the
censorship's special approval to issue fake positions ... that have
no basis,'' Agerpres said.
   In the streets of the capital, jubilant Romanians thanked
reporters from neighboring East bloc countries who had filed vivid,
extensive accounts of what was happening in Romania this past week
and were nearly the sole source of information from that country
after Ceausescu sealed the borders Sunday.
   Many Romanians are able to pick up radio and TV broadcasts from
neighboring Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Romania or listen to Western
radio stations beaming programs into Romania which also relied
heavily on the East European news agency accounts for their
information.
   The correspondent for the Bulgarian news agency BTA, Peyto
Petkov, reported that grateful demonstrators lifted his car and
thanked him for informing the world of what had happened in their
country.
   The correspondent for the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said
reporters pushing through the crowd were greeted with cries of
``Thank you, neighbors!''
   The news agency's correspondent, Petar Tomic, said a Romanian
security agent had visited him Friday after the fall of the
Ceausescu regime and apologized for monitoring his telephone calls.
   Tanjug reports out of Bucharest were more detailed than those
from other East bloc countries, even before the reforms that swept
Eastern Europe. Its previous correspondent, Dragan Markovic, was
expelled last year for his reporting after having reported from
there for more than four years.
   The Agerpres statement said:
   ``Along with the entire central and local press, the radio and
television, all the mass media, Agerpres will do its duty and
inform faithfully, honestly and in a civilized manner the home and
international public opinion about all the events in Romania and
the world,'' the statement said.
   ``We will give ... a full and honest image of all Romanian
events,'' it said.
   The statement was issued by ``the Romanian news agency
journalists who never lost their professional conscience, those who
until yesterday were compelled to ... systematically disinform''
the Romanian and foreign public.
   Only hours after the people took over the radio and television
stations, Agerpres also began giving detailed accounts of the
events in the streets.

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu arrived on a Christmas
pilgrimage Friday after stirring anger in Israel by comparing its
treatment of Palestinians with South Africa's oppression of blacks.
   The black Anglican archbishop of South Africa, who won the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize, told reporters at Ben-Gurion airport: ``It is a
great honor and experience to celebrate Christmas in the Holy
Land.''
   In a five-day visit, Tutus plans to visit Bethlehem in the
occupied West Bank on Christmas Eve and preach in Jerusalem on
Christmas Day.
   At the airport, Tutu was greeted by the head of the Anglican
church in Israel, Bishop Samir Kafity, and two low-level Israeli
officials.
   The Israeli daily Haaretz published a telephone interview
Thursday in which Tutu was quoted as saying: ``The description of
what is happening in the (occupied) Gaza Strip and West Bank could
be describing what is happening in South Africa.''
   Israeli officials have been concerned that Tutu might make
statements during the visit that would put Israel in a bad light.

   Record low temperatures were reported in more than 125 cities
across the nation Friday while readings above freezing were limited
to Florida, the Pacific Coast and southwestern deserts.
   More records were expected to fall Friday night. The National
Weather Service said the number of record lows makes the cold snap
one of the most severe on record for nation's central and eastern
region.
   Morning lows of 23 degrees below zero at Kansas City, Mo., 26
below zero at Concordia, Kan., and 27 below zero at Goodland, Kan.,
were the coldest for any day or month of the year on record for
those three locations.
   A reading of minus 23 in Indianapolis was the coldest of the
century.

Florida. Strong northerly winds kept temperatures dropping during
the day across parts of the south-central and southeastern United
States.
   Temperatures in the single digits were was far south as northern
Mississippi and northern Alabama.
   Snow, sleet and freezing rain made travel hazardous across
southern Texas and southern Louisiana. Rain was expected to change

   A small group of Soviet
teen-agers occupied the U.S. Air Force's nuclear command center on
Friday as the invited guests of the Strategic Air Command.
   The tour marked the first time Soviets have been allowed in
SAC's new $88 million underground command post. Air Force officials
could recall only one other time in SAC history that Soviets have
been allowed in its inner sanctum.
   ``It was all very interesting,'' said Andrei Berezin. ``I can't
see this in my country.''
   Lt. Gen Donald Aldridge, SAC vice commander in chief, welcomed
the Soviet students in Russian as the teens sat in the hardened
underground bunker that is used to direct U.S. nuclear forces.
   The recent thaw in east-west relations was evident as Brig. Gen.
Kenneth Keller briefed the students on the command post's
capabilities. There was no reference to nuclear weapons or their
potential targets in the Soviet Union.
   The briefing instead focused on the design of the command
center, Air Force weather forecasting and SAC's communications
system.
   The students spoke by radio with the Looking Glass aircraft, an
alternate command post that is kept airborne round-the-clock. They
also got a weather briefing in English and Russian from Eielson Air
Force Base, Alaska, the closest SAC installation to the Soviet
Union.
   ``These systems are in place to ensure that we preserve peace in
the world and we work very hard at that job,'' Keller told the
students.
   Peace was on the mind of Marina Ovechkina, who wore a peace sign
button on the tour. Miss Ovechkina said she always wears the button
and did not consider that it could attract attention at SAC
headquarters.
   Air Force officials cited time constraints and the spirit of
good will in deviating from their standard tour program, which
includes briefings on U.S. and Soviet military capability.
   ``This is a tour where the youths understand and we understand
that this is something that is in the best interest of all of us to
work these peace issues through,'' said Col. Larry Greer, a SAC
spokesman.
   The Strategic Air Command is the Air Force's long-range strike
force of manned bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Since 1961 it has maintained the airborne Looking Glass, which
would take control of U.S. nuclear forces if the president and
other leaders were killed.
   The students, aged 15-17, said they were impressed by the tour,
which also included a look at EC-135 Looking Glass aircraft, Offutt
dormitories and the base gymnasium.
   ``This is very interesting and when I come back home I will tell
my friends and parents about this,'' said Natalya Gudkova.
   But Tatjana Zabortseva said she was more impressed by the
manners of Nebraskans. ``In Omaha, people say `excuse me' and
`thank you.' That I like,'' Miss Zabortseva said.
   The students have been in the United States since Nov. 27 in an
exchange program with Omaha's Westside High School. They are
scheduled to leave Wednesday, and a group of Westside students is
to visit the Soviet Union in late March.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called Friday for
improved commercial and diplomatic relations with Argentina, but
she also insisted Britain retain control of the disputed Falkland
Islands.
   In a Christmas address to the 1,800 islanders, Mrs. Thatcher
said Britain, in recent talks with the new Argentine government,
had not wavered from its position that control of the South
Atlantic islands is not negotiable.
   In the speech broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corp., Mrs.
Thatcher said Britain would uphold its commitments to residents of
the Falklands.
   Argentine troops invaded the British colony off southern
Argentina in 1982. Britain sent troops and drove out the invaders
in a 74-day war. Diplomatic relations between the two countries
were broken.
   Argentina has claimed sovereignty to the islands it calls the
Malvinas since 1832.
   On Argentina, Mrs. Thatcher said: ``We want to improve ordinary
commercial and diplomatic relations because that is in the
interests of us all, including the Falkland Islands.''

   The Pentagon ordered 2,000 additional Army
soldiers airlifted to still-chaotic Panama late Friday, a source
said, as President Bush shrugged off a Latin American appeal to end
the U.S. intervention and declared the troops would stay ``to do
what is necessary.''
   ``The decision has been made'' to bolster roughly 24,000 U.S.
troops already on the ground trying to quell the resistance being
offered by forces loyal to deposed dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega,
said the Pentagon source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``The movement will be taking place in the near future,'' he
added.
   Renewed resistance in Panama City also prompted the Pentagon to
give a new estimate of up to 10 more days for American forces to
seize complete control of Panama's capital city.
   Earlier, Lt. Gen. Tom Kelly, director of operations for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, ``We are looking to bring more troops
in. We are also looking at re-establishing the police force.''
   Meanwhile, in an indication the Army was settling in, military
officials also convened their first press briefing at the Southern
Command in Panama.
   In Washington, Bush told Congress in a formal notification
abiding by the War Powers Act that it was impossible to predict the
``scope and duration'' of the U.S. intervention.
   He underscored his support for the new government of Guillermo
Endara by welcoming Endara's ambassador, Carlos Rodriguez, in the
Oval Office.
   The administration also offered what it said was new evidence of
drug dealings by _ including a 110 pound stash of cocaine found
near Noriega's private office at a military barracks.
   Also uncovered at other locations were an arsenal of more than
5,000 weapons, a picture of Adolf Hitler and a bizarre assortment
of occult and witchcraft paraphernalia, according to U.S. officials.
   Noriega himself continued to elude U.S. forces.
   ``We continue to receive reports ... and the search continues,''
presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said of the deposed
general who faces drug-trafficking charges in the United States.
   The administration dismissed a vote by the Organization of
American States deploring the U.S. invasion and calling for an
immediate withdrawal. The OAS vote was 20-1, with the United States
casting the lone ``no'' vote. Six nations abstained.
   ``I don't think we're surprised that the OAS would take this
position,'' Fitzwater said, adding that the administration thinks
``that eventually the countries of Latin America will recognize and
support the new government.''
   Privately, he suggested, some Latin American leaders have been
more supportive.
   Bush mentioned the continuing chaos in Panama during a speech on
AIDS at the National Institutes of Health, saying: ``We sorrow at
the casualties in Panama, but we know nothing is more crucial to
peace on earth than freedom and democracy.''
   With American troops under fire at Christmastime, Bush told his
audience, ``I assure you that through these holidays we will not
forget our brave soldiers down there and their families.''
   ``We will continue to do what is necessary to help the people of
Panama achieve the democratic society that they voted for and that
they so rightfully deserve,'' Bush said.
   After the midday speech, Bush flew by helicopter to the
presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., where he will remain
through Christmas.
   Aides said that Bush would keep in touch on developments in
Panama by phone.
   On Sunday, Bush will deliver a holiday message to U.S. Armed
Forces worldwide over the Armed Forces Radio Network. A week later,
on Sunday Dec. 31, he will visit wounded soldiers who have been
flown from Panama to Lackland Air Force Base and at Fort Sam
Houston, both near San Antonio.
   Early Friday, Bush formally notified Congress of his reasons for
ordering the military assault.
   While asserting that the worst fighting had ended, Bush told
Congress, ``It is not possible at this time to predict the precise
scope and duration of the military operations or how long the
temporary increase of U.S. forces in Panama will be required.''
   Bush's notice to Congress complied with the War Powers Act,
which requires formal notification any time U.S. military forces
are sent into action. The administration contends the act is
unconstitutional, but follows it anyway.
   In his written message, Bush accused Noriega of directing
``vicious and brutal acts'' against Americans and asserted that the
lives and welfare of U.S. citizens had been ``increasingly at
risk.''
   He also said that Noriega's action had threatened the operation
of the Panama Canal, which the United States is under treaty
obligation to turn over to Panama in the year 2000.
   At the Southern Command headquarters in Panama City, Gen.
Maxwell Thurman delivered a lengthy denunciation of Noriega,
depicting him as a drug trafficker who had a picture Hitler in his
closet and pornography in his desk.
   Thurman said Noriega had been organizing a terrorist force with
the possible goal of taking over the Panama Canal.

<HEAD>Mom Says Prayers for Transplant Recipient Answered</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The thoughts and prayers of people across the
country have been answered on behalf of a tiny medical pioneer who
received part of her mother's liver in a precedent-setting
operation, the girl's mother said Friday.
   Doctors tell the family that 22-month old Alyssa Smith likely
will spend Christmas with her family and may leave the hospital by
the new year.
   ``We have really been blessed by the people and their generosity
and thoughtfulness in expressing their concern,'' Alyssa's mother,
Teri, said Friday as she sat by her daughter's bedside.
   Cards and ``many, many teddy bears'' have come from around the
country. ``When we get home we're going to get a map out and mark
each town we've gotten something from,'' she said.
   Late last month, doctors transplanted part of Mrs. Smith's liver
to her daughter in the nation's first liver transplant from a
living donor.
   A second child who underwent the same operation a few days after
Alyssa, Sarina Jones, also is doing remarkably well, said John
Easton, a spokesman for the University of Chicago Medical Center.
   Both children were in critical condition, but stable, Friday,
Easton said.
   Like Alyssa, 16-month-old Sarina, of Millington, Tenn., suffers
from biliary atresia, a usually fatal congenital defect that is the
leading cause of liver transplants in children.
   Doctors have said previously that the living-donor organ
segments the children received have performed much better than the
cadaver donors previously used in such operations. Use of a living
donor also offers a possible solution to the chronic shortage of
available cadaver organs for infants.
   Alyssa, who comes from Schertz, Texas, near San Antonio, likely
will be given a ``day pass'' to spend Christmas Day with her family
at a Chicago home for relatives of ailing children, Mrs. Smith said.
   ``She'll be able to eat lunch with us and open her gifts away
from the hospital,'' said Mrs. Smith, who was released from the
hospital two weeks ago. ``We're going to be together as a family _
that's a plus.''
   Mrs. Smith, a fourth grade teacher who has been on television
and in newspaper pictures since the historic operation, went
Christmas shopping Thursday and returned with more than her
purchases, Easton said.
   ``Wherever they went, people would stop and recognize her.
People would figure out who she was and say, `Take this back for
your little girl,''' he said.
   Sarina was much sicker than Alyssa at the time of her operation,
which makes her recovery slower, Easton said.
   ``A biopsy detected some minor rejection Wednesday, and they're
watching that,''eceived part of the liver of her father, Robert, during
the operation. The transplanted liver has performed well, and
Easton said doctors are optimistic.
   ``I think everyone is real pleased,'' he said. ``Her liver began
functioning immediately (and is) for all intents and purposes, a
normally functioning liver.''
   And while Sarina and Alyssa are not completely out of the woods,
their families say they trust 1990 will be a better year than 1989
for the young transplant recipients.
   ``We feel very strongly that God's hand has been over us,'' Mrs.
Smith said. ``The thoughts and prayers of the people who responded
have definitely been answered.''

<TEXT>
   President Hissene Habre was inaugurated
Friday for seven more years in power after winning 99.94 percent of
the vote in a national referendum where he was the only candidate.
   The government of Habre, who appealed for his opponents to
return to Chad's political life, Friday also freed 45 political
prisoners, including former Secretary of State for Agriculture
Mokhtar Bachar Mokhtar.
   The new constitution approved Dec. 10 in the national referendum
made Habre eligible for two more seven-year terms. He came to power
when his forces captured N'Djamena in a 1982 civil war.
   In a speech Friday, Habre said the new constitution
``institutionalized the rule of law and deepened the meaning of
democracy'' in the northern African country.
   He said the constitution allows all Chadians to take part fully
in the affairs of state ``with no restraint other than the law.''
   Habre appealed to Chadians in exile and to the tiny minority who
voted against him to rejoin Chad's political life, saying he
considered himself ``president of all Chadians.''
   Forces loyal to Habre have ousted Libyan-backed rebels from most
positions they held. Only the Aouzou strip in the extreme north
remains in the hands of Libyan forces.

   Pentagon officials said Friday that American
troops had seized 10,000 weapons in three separate caches in their
sweep through Panama City and were trying to move out ``looting
sniping'' remnants of Manuel Antonio Noriega's forces.
   ``The primary endeavor of the movement is to clear Panama City
and assist the government in restoring law and order,'' said Lt.
Gen. Tom Kelly, the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
   Meanwhile, a Pentagon source said Friday night an additional
2,000 Army soldiers were being flown to Panama ``in the near
future.''
   Earlier Kelly was asked about reports of a mortar round being
fired at U.S. military headquarters at Quarry Heights.
   ``Things like that can happen,'' he said. ``Popping off a mortar
round is a fairly easy thing to do.''
   Kelly called the weapons discovery ``little short of
astonishing.''
   ``One wonders what the intentions of Noriega were,'' the general
said, adding that the arms cache was composed primarily of Eastern
bloc weapons.
   Kelly, who raised the prospect that additional U.S. troops might
be brought to Panama, acknowledged that Noriega's defense forces
had put up a tougher battle than expected and that the ``mopping
up'' process would take longer than first thought.
   ``It's simply a difficult operation ... There are a lot of
places to hide (in Panama City),'' Kelly said. He said military
commanders' estimates for ``clearing the city range from five to 10
days.''
   The general also suggested a new direction for the U.S. troops,
saying ``we plan to move out to the west of Panama City,'' but he
declined to discuss what the target of the operation might be.
   While officials said Noriega remained at large, Kelly said, ``I
don't think he has a very long half-life. ... He sure is out of
power.''
   Kelly said that U.S. forces were encountering the remnants of
Noriega's armed civilian battalions.
   ``They are looting, sniping, they are lawless,'' he said. But he
said U.S. forces have been able to make some progress, including
taking the legislative building, the presidential palace, central
bank, and several ministries.
   ``I'm satisfied it's under control,'' Kelly said of the
military's urban operation. ``We're not getting anything we can't
handle.''
   In a pincer movement, Kelly said the 193rd Infantry _ which is
permanently based in Panama _ and the forces of the 82nd Airborne
were moving through the city from opposite points and hoped to link
up.
   Late Friday, the Pentagon updated its report of U.S. soldiers
killed in action, saying that 21 had been killed and 221 wounded
with two missing. In addition two civilian U.S. dependents were
killed.
   The Pentagon added that 127 members of the Panamanian Defense
Forces had been killed, 66 wounded and 1,663 were being detained.
   Rear Adm. Ted Sheafer, who joined Kelly at the briefing, said
there were still reports of three hostages cases that were ``not
resolved. There may be others,'' he said.
   The admiral, the intelligence chief for the Joint Chiefs, said
the administration was sending a team of experts to Panama from the
various intelligence agencies and departments to go through a
``treasure trove'' of documents that had been discovered in
Noriega's military headquarters.
   Kelly, asked whether he had enough military force to keep peace
in the city, said, ``We are looking to bring more troops in. We are
also looking at re-establishing the police force.''
   The general said that since the new government was offering to
pay the police, ``that may be an incentive for them to come back.''
   ``We would like to be able to put Panamanian police and U.S.
military police out in pairs _ one Panamanian, one U.S. military _
and in that way begin to restore law and order,'' he said.
   Later, the general said that two companies of U.S. military
police had been brought into Panama on Thursday and that ``they are
the ones we want in the street with the police, because they have
the training to do it.''
   Pentagon spokeswoman Maj. Kathy Wood said that Panamanian police
and U.S. military police have performed security duties at all U.S.
military installations in Panama since the inception of the Panama
Canal treaties, so the concept of dual patrols is not a new one to
the area.
   She pointed out that the Panamanian police, while part of the
PDF, are not soldiers and are considered public servants.

<TEXT>
   Despite the U.S. fighting in Panama, the White
House and State Department closed their press offices Friday night
for a long holiday weekend, not to reopen until the Tuesday after
Christmas.
   ``Any details on the military situation on the ground will come
from the Defense Department,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   The Pentagon planned to keep its press office open on Saturday.
After that, the Pentagon planned to follow the State Department and
White House in the practice of having a press duty officer
available by telephone.
   ``We do not expect to release any new information here unless
there's a dramatic turn in events,'' Fitzwater said at his briefing.
   Of course, the most dramatic event would be the capture or death
of deposed Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the target of a U.S.
manhunt in Panama.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III were booked for appearances Sunday on network talk shows.
   The State Department's Panama task force was to remain staffed
around the clock.
   Cheney cancelled a holiday trip to Wyoming and other plans to
remain in Washington to monitor the battle for Panama.
   President Bush, meanwhile, settled in at Camp David in
Maryland's Catoctin Mountains for a five-day stay. He was to
receive regular updates and daily briefings from Brent Scowcroft,
his national security adviser, as well as Cheney and Baker.
   Bush will remain at his presidential retreat until he departs
Wednesday for a vacation trip to Texas, returning to Washington on
New Year's Day.

   Soldiers wounded during the U.S. invasion of
Panama received Purple Heart medals and other awards from the Army
Chief of Staff who said he was proud of their ``selfless
commitment.''
   Gen. Carl Vuono, a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, handed
out more than 200 military honors and chatted briefly with soldiers
at two military hospitals in San Antonio where those hurt in Panama
are being treated.
   Vuono told the soldiers he spoke with President Bush and, ``He
wanted me to tell you and every other troop down here how proud he
is of each and every one of you for your sacrifice.''
   He gave Purple Hearts to Pvt. Christian Robinson of Federal Way,
Wash.; Pfc. Bobby Miller of Franklin, Pa., and Spec. 4 Albert
Harris, of Jackson, Miss. All three suffered gunshot or shrapnel
wounds in the attack.
   A pool of reporters was only permitted to accompany Vuono to
Wilford Hall Medical Center for the presentation to the three
soldiers. In addition to Wilford Hall, where 112 soldiers were
hospitalized, he visited nearby Brooke Army Medical Center, where
89 more were being treated.
   Military officials would only say that more than 200 awards were
presented, including Purple Hearts, infantry-combat badges and
other awards. The Purple Heart is awarded to members of the armed
forces wounded or killed in action.
   Lt. Col. Johnny Whitaker said 53 servicemen were to be flown out
late Friday afternoon to military bases in Georgia and North
Carolina.
   Two soldiers wounded in Panama were released Friday and another
seven were transferred to other medical centers. Another 21 were
flown in early Friday.
   The commander of a C-141 transport plane that brought the 21
injured servicemen to Kelly Air Force Base early Friday said the
soldiers he transported were in ``good spirits.''
   ``They were glad to be coming back to the United States. We were
glad to bring them,'' Air Force Capt. Peter Debusmann said.
``They're just glad to be coming home, back to the States, and home
for Christmas. And they're worried that their parents are worried
about them.''
   A reception center for families was set up at Fort Sam Houston
in San Antonio. Housing was arranged for the families, and several
San Antonio hotels offered complimentary or discounted rooms to
relatives of the injured.
   Lee Olivara of Cincinnati, brother of wounded Army Staff Sgt.
Louis R. Olivara, said Friday that his brother seemed to be
recovering all right from wounds to the head and chest.
   ``I think he's going to be all right,'' Lee said. He said his
parents, Ralph and Barbara Olivara of Branson, Mo., were expected
in later Friday.
   Lee Olivara said Louis, a member of the 2nd Battalion, 75th
Rangers, was separated from other members in his unit when he was
shot.
   ``He had told me that he saw the sun rise and the sun set and he
woke up in the darkness and said `I'm in trouble. I need to get
some help or I'm going to die.' Then he realized he had the radio
and he made the call.''
   ``He was in and out of consciousness and he was unable to move.''
   When U.S. servicemen are hurt overseas, they usually are brought
to San Antonio, home to four Air Force bases and an Army post.
Wilford Hall is one of the nation's main military hospitals, and
Brooke is a leading burn unit.
   Richard and Linda Turner of DeSoto, Texas, visited their son,
Pvt. Richard Turner Jr., who suffered a concussion when a bullet
grazed his helmet.
   ``He's in very good condition ... shaken up quite a bit but he's
in good condition physically,'' Mrs. Turner said. ``He saw one of
his friends killed. He cried quite a bit.''

<HEAD>Mercenary Who Held Islands Says He's Negotiating With South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bob Denard, leader of the
mercenaries who last week were forced to yield their control of the
Comoros Islands, said Friday he was negotiating with authorities to
leave South Africa as soon as possible.
   Denard has been in South Africa since Dec. 15, the day French
troops landed in the Comoros off southeastern Africa and ended a
takeover led by Denard and fellow European mercenaries.
   The Presidential Guard, which was led by the mercenaries, had
controlled the three-island Indian Ocean nation, a former French
colony, since the shooting death Nov. 26 of President Ahmed
Abdallah.
   At his first news conference in South Africa, Denard on Friday
described his stay in South Africa as ``obviously temporary'' and
said he hoped to depart soon after he and his lawyer, who had just
arrived from Paris, worked out details. Denard, a Frenchman,
thanked South Africa for its hospitality.
   More than 30 of the mercenaries flew to Europe last week, but
Denard was allowed to stay in South Africa temporarily while he
negotiated for permanent residence elsewhere.
   Three of the mercenaries initially stayed with Denard in South
Africa, but Foreign Affairs spokesman Rusty Evans said two had
returned to France during the week.
   France and South Africa are the main donors of aid to the
Comoros, but they suspended assistance following Abdallah's death
in circumstances that remain unclear. Many Comoreans blamed Denard
for the killing, but he again denied Friday that he was involved.
   ``I am not an assassain. I did not kill President Abdallah,'' he
said. He has previously said one of the president's bodyguards shot
him.
   Denard has told South African authorities that he was wary of
returning to France because he could face criminal charges for his
role in an attempted coup in the West African country of Benin 14
years ago.

<TEXT>
   The General Assembly on Friday unanimously
called for an end to driftnet fishing in the South Pacific in 1991
and a global ban on use of the huge nets a year later.
   The resolution, adopted by consensus, denounces driftnet fishing
as ``a highly indiscriminate and wasteful fishing method which is
widely considered to threaten the effective conservation of living
marine resources.''
   Driftnets stretch up to 30 miles, scooping up all fish and other
marine life. Dolphins, porpoises, sea birds and unwanted fish are
killed along with the desired catch.
   Japan, Taiwan and South Korea have made extensive use of the
nets in the Pacific Ocean to catch squid. More than 1,000 ships
from many nations, including France, Spain and Italy, use the nets
worldwide.
   The U.N. resolution recommends driftnet fishing be scaled down
immediately in the South Pacific and ended there by July 1, 1991.
It says a worldwide ban should go into effect on June 30, 1992.
   While not binding, the resolution will probably gain wide
compliance, diplomats say. Japan, considered the biggest user of
drift nets, has already announced it will stop.
   The ban, the resolution added, could be waived in a region
``should effective conservation and management measures be taken.''
   Small-scale use of driftnets in coastal waters would be
excluded. The resolution said such fishing is important to the
economies of developing countries.

<TEXT>
   Fighters loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega launched a bold daylight attack Friday on the headquarters
of U.S. military forces and tried to assassinate the vice president
installed by the United States.
   On the third day of the U.S. occupation, Panama City was near
anarchy. Refugees pleaded for food and medicine as waves of looters
ransacked stores.
   U.S. troops searched residential areas of the capital and other
parts of this West Virginia-sized nation for Noriega, but found no
trace of the ousted dictator they were sent in to capture.
   Panamanians seemed to greet the U.S. troops with some
enthusiasm, but many residents of this city, wracked by savage
looting and littered with debris, were too frightened to go out on
the streets.
   Some said they had set up their own defense patrols to protect
themselves and their neighbors amid the chaos, which reigned in
both lower- and middle-class neighborhoods.
   In Washington, Pentagon officials said U.S. troops had seized
10,000 weapons, mostly made in the East bloc, in three separate
caches in the city. Lt. Gen. Tom Kelly, director of operations for
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called the discoveries ``little short of
astonishing'' and said they led to questions about what Noriega's
plans may have been.
   A Pentagon source said 2,000 more soldiers would be airlifted to
Panama, bolstering the force of 24,000 already there, and President
Bush said the troops would stay ``to do what is necessary.''
   The U.S.-installed first vice president, Ricardo Arias Calderon
was leaving the National Assembly when members of pro-Noriega
``Dignity Battalions'' shot at his car. Arias was uninjured, but
two of his aides were wounded, said Arias aide Teni de Obaldia.
   The fighting around the U.S. Southern Command in Quarry Heights,
on the western edge of Panama City, started about 11:25 a.m. and
lasted an hour, with mortar blasts shaking the U.S. headquarters as
dozens of Noriega supporters attacked buildings nearby.
   Military officials at Rodman Naval Station, just across the
Panama Canal, said they had no information on casualties.
   The Supreme Court, about a mile to the southeast, was in flames,
and sporadic fighting swirled through parts of the chaotic city,
once a major international financial center but now a shell of
itself.
   Only several blocks away from southern command stands the Panama
Canal Commission headquarters. The headquarters itself was not hit,
but surrounding buildings including a warehouse were.
   Plumes of brown and black smoke could be seen from Rodman at
mid-afternoon, and U.S. Army helicopters flew over the area,
apparently searching for the attackers.
   Later Friday, U.S. troops fired shells and threw tear gas at a
residence adjacent to the Spanish news agency EFE where a friend of
Noriega reportedly lived in a wealthy neighborhood.
   Seven EFE journalists darted to the floor during the 20-minute
attack, which shook the office with three loud explosions and could
be seen from The Associated Press office 150 yards away.
   After the assault, neighbors with sledgehammers broke into the
residence and looted the house, which was apparently empty.
   Late Friday, the Pentagon updated its count of soldiers killed
in the assault so far to 21 along with two female dependents. It
said 221 were wounded and two were missing since the invasion
began. An American civilian, CBS News producer Jon Meyersohn, also
was missing after being abducted Wednesday from the Marriott Hotel.
   U.S. officials said 122 Panamanian soldiers were killed and 45
wounded.
   But Dr. Elmer Miranda, deputy director of Santo Tomas Hospital
in Panama City, said there were 200 dead bodies in the basement and
that he heard from a colleague of 60 more in Gorgas Hospital, run
by the U.S. Southern Command.
   Miranda appealed to Latin American nations and Europe to send
medical equipment because ``the United States is only giving us
bullets.''
   Thousands of refugees fleeing the fighting took cover in soccer
stadiums, churches and schools.
   ``They had water, but we're very short of food,'' said a Red
Cross worker who like others refused to give his name for fear of
reprisals.
   He said U.S. Army units were handing out rations but that it was
not enough.
   Noriega supporters in one district said they were running out of
ammunition and hope. Several pro-Noriega bands surrendered in
western Panama on Friday.
   But the dramatic attack on the very center of the U.S. military
area and the effort to kill Arias showed that U.S. efforts to
achieve control were falling short.
   About 200 reporters who arrived at Howard Air Force Base
overnight were not allowed into the city because military officials
said they could not guarantee their security, an indication U.S.
military forces are not in as much control of Panama City as they
have been claiming.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called Friday for
improved commercial and diplomatic relations with Argentina, but
she also insisted Britain retain control of the disputed Falkland
Islands.
   In a Christmas address to the 1,800 islanders, Mrs. Thatcher
said Britain, in recent talks with the new Argentine government,
had not wavered from its position that control of the South
Atlantic islands is not negotiable.
   Her message followed the restoration Thursday of consular ties
between Britain and Argentina, severed at the time of the 1982
Falklands War.
   Consular flags were hoisted Friday in London and Buenos Aires,
but full diplomatic links between the two countries remain severed.
   In the speech broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corp., Mrs.
Thatcher said Britain would uphold its commitments to residents of
the Falklands.
   Argentine troops invaded the British colony off southern
Argentina in 1982. Britain sent troops and drove out the invaders
in a 74-day war.
   Argentina has claimed sovereignty to the islands it calls the
Malvinas since 1832.
   The prime minister commended the Falklands' growing prosperity
from its fishing industry and independence.
   ``You're deciding the kind of life you want for yourselves and
your children, and you're taking a greater share of responsibility
for your own affairs,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in the message,
broadcast on the BBC's World Service ``Calling the Falklands''
program.
   On Argentina, Mrs. Thatcher said: ``We want to improve ordinary
commercial and diplomatic relations because that is in the
interests of us all, including the Falkland Islands.''

   The AP's Mort Rosenblum was among the first

<TEXT>
   Fighting continued in the streets of
Bucharest early Saturday, with automatic weapons fire erupting
around the TV and radio studios that had been captured by opponents
of President Nicolae Ceausescu.
   For all the joyous celebrations in the center of Bucharest on
Friday at the ouster of Ceausescu, the mood on the capital's
streets after nightfall was tense.
   All over town, there were makeshift roadblocks of buses,
bulldozers, even bakery trolleys, testifying to the impromptu
nature of the uprising.
   Army units supporting the popular revolt that forced Ceausescu
from power battled on after midnight against pro-Ceausescu security
forces.
   Just after 2:30 a.m. (7:30 p.m. EST Friday), heavy gunfire broke
out around the television station, where occupants ducked below
windows as shots rained toward the building. Lights went out as the
gunfire pounded in.
   Minutes before the shooting began, crowds still were outside the
TV building, chanting slogans in support of the popular revolt
against Ceausescu.
   Gunfire also was heard echoing through the streets around the
radio station about two miles away from the TV building.
   On arrival at the airport Friday night, a guard smiled at this
correspondent and said: ``Welcome to Romania.''
   When asked how things were, he replied, ``Now, it's OK.''
   A woman customs inspector also seemed relaxed, waving visitors
through with a big smile.
   Travelers from the airport to the Park Hotel in the north of
Bucharest had to pass through seven roadblocks.
   At one, soldiers and police flashed ``V'' for victory signs and
held up their fists in gestures of triumph. At another, soldiers
sat with sullen faces in the scoop of a bulldozer.
   Bucharest residents appeared happy that Ceausescu had fled the
capital, but were anxious as the fighting continued.
   The president's exact whereabouts were still unknown early
Saturday. On Friday, he left his presidential palace by helicopter
with his wife, Elena, but there conflicting reports in the hours
afterward on his detention.
   ``Ceausescu is finished,'' hospital worker Alec Florescu
declared with certainty.
   ``The people that are fighting now know that if they give up,
they're in big trouble,'' said Florescu, whop supports the
uprising. ``So they're fighting to the end.''
   He branded the shooting of unarmed civilians in Timisoara last
weekend and in Bucharest on Thursday as ``absolutely inhuman.''
   An unidentified man said troops had shot his girlfriend in the
arm Friday, but they were pinned down by gunfire as they tried to
reach a hospital. ``They were just shooting directly at people,''
he said.
   A man who gave a Western reporter a ride through the darkened
city, when asked what he thought of the situation, was more laconic.
   ``A small revolution in a small country,'' he said.

   A pipe bomb delivered to a county judge's
apartment exploded and injured him Friday, but appeared to be
unrelated to four other bomb attacks in four states since Saturday,
authorities said.
   Washington County Circuit Judge John Corderman, 47, was in
stable condition after undergoing surgery to remove shrapnel in his
abdomen and right hand, said Washington County Hospital spokeswoman
Diana Donegan.
   Corderman also lost the tip of his right middle finger and
suffered severe damage to both eardrums, but he never lost
consciousness and his life was in no immediate danger, hospital
officials said.
   A neighbor said the bomb exploded in Corderman's third-floor
downtown apartment about 10 minutes after a delivery man left a
package in the building. The judge apparently was alone at the
time, police said.
   ``Apparently, the device was situated outside when he arrived
home. He retrieved it, entered the apartment and a short time later
it exploded. We don't know whether it was opened or not,'' said
Chuck Jackson, Maryland State Police spokesman.
   Corderman made his way outside his apartment, used a fire alarm
to call for help and went back inside, where he collapsed, Jackson
said.
   ``This was a life-threatening bomb. It was not of small
proportion. The injuries however did not threaten him,'' said Dr.
Charles Chaney, a surgeon at Washington County Hospital. Based on
the injuries, Chaney said he believed Corderman was holding the
parcel in his lap when it exploded.
   A second, unexploded pipe bomb was found in the same package as
the device that exploded, and was designed to detonate when the
first one did, said Deputy Fire Marshal Faron Taylor. The second
device was disarmed by two bomb specialists, he said. The building
was evacuated.
   George Hopgood, an assistant special agent in charge for the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the explosion
appeared to be unrelated to four package bombs in the past week
that exploded or were defused.
   ``It is not similar to the ones that have been found in the
southeast. At this time there doesn't appear to be any
connection,'' Hopgood said.
   Hagerstown Police Chief Paul Wood said investigators had not yet
identified a motive.
   Earlier, police Lt. Robert Frick said the blast had some
similarities to the bombs that killed a federal judge in Alabama on
Dec. 16 and, two days later, a city councilman who was also an
NAACP attorney in Savannah, Ga.
   However, ``we've got a lot of leads to follow up,'' he said.
   Parcel bombs were also found this week at the Jacksonville,
Fla., chapter of the NAACP and the 11th Circuit courthouse in
Atlanta. Both were defused without incident.
   Colleagues of the U.S. appellate judge who was killed, Robert S.
Vance, have since received threatening letters, sources told The
Associated Press on Friday.
   In Washington, Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said he
was unaware that letters had been delivered to judges on the 11th
Circuit.
   But Runkel said four threatening letters delivered this week
bore physical evidence linking them to the bombs that killed Vance
and the attorney, Robert E. Robinson. He would not say to whom they
were delivered.
   Following the Hagerstown explosion, agents of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms arrived from the Baltimore office,
about 65 miles southeast of here. FBI agents were also on the scene.
   A neighbor of Corderman, Steven Keyes, 30, said he saw a
delivery man bring a package to the building about 20 minutes
before the 2:30 p.m. explosion.
   ``It looked like a normal person to me, a normal delivery,''
Keyes said. The delivery man stayed inside five to 10 minutes, and
the explosion occurred about 10 minutes after he left, Keyes said.
   ``I thought maybe it was a neighbor who had dropped something on
the floor. It sounded like a muffled-type bomb. My brother-in-law
thought the truck had backfired,'' Keyes said.
   Corderman, known as one of the toughest judges in the county,
was not at work Friday because the courthouse was closed for the
Christmas holiday.
   ``He's a judge. He's put a lot of people away,'' Frick said.
   Corderman obtained a gun permit several years ago because of
death threats.
   According to Baltimore attorney Chris Brown, ``He's the kind of
gentleman who you like him or don't like him. He has rubbed people
the wrong way.''
   Brown said the judge ``takes unusual stances and gives lawyers a
hard time. He's a very colorful outspoken, controversial judge.''
   Hagerstown attorney Edward Button called Corderman a legal
scholar and ``an extremely competent judge. He knows the law very,
very well.''
   The explosion blew holes in both Corderman's eardrums, and he
lost 75 percent hearing in his right ear and 50 percent in the
left, Chaney said. Reconstructive surgery could restore some of
Corderman's hearing, he said.
   He said the judge was under guard and would probably stay in the
hospital for three days.
   ``His only concern was that the other judges be made aware of
the incident and take precautions,'' Chaney said.
   An FBI-led investigation has been concentrating on possible
racial motivations for the killings in Georgia and Alabama.
   Brown said Corderman is unlikely to have handled racially
sensitive cases because few of them arise in Washington County,
which has a relatively small black population. However, inmates at
two state prisons in Washington County often go before circuit
judges in Hagerstown.
   A Democrat, Corderman gave up his state senate seat in 1977 at
age 35 to fill a vacancy on the bench and was elected to a 15-year
term as judge the next year. He was elected in 1983 as president of
the Maryland State Bar Association, the first judge in decades to
hold the post.

   Two women accused of taking a 3-week-old boy boy
from a hospital were charged with kidnapping Friday, hours after
the infant was found unharmed in an apartment, police said.
   Ellis Lyles Jr., born Nov. 28 at the hospital, was to be
released Thursday night after a three-day hospitalization for
gastrointestinal problems, said hospital president Michael H.
Sussman.
   He was found, safe and apparently well-cared for, at the
apartment of Sonia Rodriguez early Friday, hours after he was
reported missing from the pediatric unit at Norwegian-American
Hospital, said Detective John McKenna.
   Rodriguez, a 40-year-old mother of four, was charged with
aggravated kidnapping, as was Carmen Calderon, 20, said Detective
Philip Ducar.
   ``Apparently because they didn't see any parent of the baby for
two or three days, they thought the baby was abandoned, so they
were going to take him home and raise him as their own,'' Ducar
said.
   Rodriguez smuggled the baby out under her coat and Calderon was
a lookout for security guards and took some supplies to care for
the baby, Ducar said.
   The two women were in custory pending bail hearings.
   The baby, the son of Janice Holliday and Ellis Lyles Sr., was
last seen by hospital staff shortly before 8 p.m. Thursday, the
hospital said.
   Sussman said the infant was readmitted Dec. 18 with acute
gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach and intestines.

   A jury on Friday recommended 16 years in
prison for the man who caused the nation's worst drunken-driving
accident, but some families of Larry Mahoney's 27 victims said it
wasn't enough.
   Mahoney, 36, who had been free on bond prior to his conviction,
was led in handcuffs out of the Carroll County Courthouse and taken
to the local jail after Circuit Judge Charles Satterwhite
discontinued his bail.
   Satterwhite is to sentence Mahoney formally in February. The
judge can give Mahoney a lighter sentence, but cannot exceed the
jury's recommendation.
   It came one day after Mahoney was convicted on 27 counts each of
second-degree manslaughter and first-degree wanton endangerment, 12
of first-degree assault, 14 of second-degree wanton endangerment
and one of drunken driving.
   The recommended sentences totaled 611 years, but the jury opted
to have them run concurrently. That effectively gave Mahoney 16
years of a possible 20-year sentence for assault, the most serious
offense, and he would be eligible for parole consideration in eight
years under Kentucky law.
   The jury determined that Mahoney caused the crash of a
church-owned school bus on May 14, 1988, as he drove on the wrong
side of Interstate 71 while intoxicated.
   The crash five miles south of Carrollton caused a fire that
killed 24 children and three adults who were returning to the
Radcliff First Assembly of God church.
   Forty people escaped, but 12 children suffered severe burns.
They were represented by the 12 assault charges.
   Lawyers on both sides noted the irony of Mahoney's being
convicted of a more serious offense for the burn injuries than for
the deaths. The maximum sentence for second-degree manslaughter is
10 years, which the jury recommended on each of the 27 counts. But
that was made moot by the recommendation that the prison terms be
concurrent, not consecutive.
   The jury's verdict and sentence recommendations were ``a big
letdown'' for the victims' families, since the state had charged
Mahoney with murder in each of the deaths, said William Nichols,
whose only child, 17-year-old William Joseph Nichols Jr., died in
the bus fire.
   ``I've forgiven Larry Mahoney, but he's got to pay for his crime
and eight years is not enough,'' said Nichols.
   ``I really don't think he understands what he's done to all of
our lives,'' said Nichols' wife, Madeline.
   ``It was not manslaughter. It was murder,'' said Janet Kytta,
whose husband, Charles, burned to death on the bus. ``I can't say
Chuck's life was worth five years or 10 years or 20 years, but it
was worth the word `murder.'''
   The leader of a group fighting drunken driving said the jury
missed a chance to send a sobering message nationwide.
   ``It sends out a message that's been sent out thousands of times
before,'' said Ken Nathanson, president of Citizens for Safe
Drivers Against Drunk Drivers and Other Chronic Offenders. ``It
just indicates that American society isn't that serious about drunk
driving.''
   Assistant Attorney General Paul Richwalsky, who prosecuted
Mahoney, said he was disappointed both by the jury's refusal to
convict the chemical plant worker of murder and by the recommended
sentence.
   ``I asked for consecutive (sentences) but they gave
concurrent,'' Richwalsky said. ``I thought all the carnage ... was
worth more than eight years.''
   William Summers, lead attorney on Mahoney's three-man defense
team, said he was ``basically ... pleased with the verdict.''
   ``We beat 27 murder counts,'' Summers said. ``At least (Mahoney)
can hold his head up. He's not a mass murderer.''
   Mahoney is remorseful regardless of the length of his prison
sentence, Summers said. ``If putting him away for life would take
away some of the hurt, he'd do it,'' Summers said.
   
   One of Mahoney's last requests while waiting for the jury's
verdict on Thursday was to meet with Kentucky State Police Trooper
Henry ``Sonny'' Cease, who was the case's lead investigator.
   Cease had to remove the victims' burned bodies the day after the
crash, when the bus was hauled to a temporary morgue at
Carrollton's National Guard Armory.
   In their brief meeting, Mahoney ``just said he holds no grudges
against me,'' Cease said. ``I told him I feel the same way he does:
I wish we weren't here.''

<HEAD>Jubilant Passengers Return from Panama on Eastern Flight</HEAD>

   Jubilant passengers on the first commercial flight
to arrive here from Panama since fighting broke out described
Friday how hotel employees helped them hide from belligerent
Panamanian soldiers.
   Most of the passengers, many disheveled and tired, were from the
Caribbean and Latin America and had been guests at the besieged
Marriott Hotel in Panama City.
   Several said the Panamanian soldiers questioned them and
separated them from American citizens who were at the hotel.
   Eastern Airlines Flight 8302, with 57 passengers and eight crew
members, was the first commercial flight from Panama to arrive at
this international air travel hub. Airline spokesman Robin Mattel
said he's not aware of any earlier commercial flights from Panama
to this country.
   Those on the flight said they either were aided by Marriott
employees to hide from Panamanian soldiers or were liberated when
American soldiers retook the hotel.
   ``The flight back was completely euphoric,'' said Colin Cleary,
who lives in Colombia with his wife and 18-month-old child. ``We
were so grateful to Eastern to get us back. We had been stuck at
(Howard Air Force Base) since 1 Thursday afternoon.
   ``We were happy and relieved,'' he said of the passengers. ``A
lot of us were sleeping on the plane because we haven't had much
sleep.''
   Cleary said he was hidden in the laundry after being told
Panamanian troops were in the hotel. He said many of the Americans
were put in ``safe rooms'' by hotel workers early Wednesday.
   ``Between 2:30 and 3 a.m., the goon squads entered the hotel.
They went directly to the 11th floor where there was the biggest
concentration of Americans,'' said Joe Clark, a 58-year-old Miami
businessman.
   ``I jumped from my room to the fire escape. I hid on the fire
escape all Wednesday morning. I remained there until 5:30 or 6.
   ``The security man from Marriott took me to a safer place,'' he
said ``The goons were coming in and the goons asked him if any
Americans were there, and I was hiding behind a door.''
   An Eastern pilot, Jay Skinner, said he and other Americans hid
in the hotel's basement while the PDF searched the upper floors.
Some of the flight attendants hid inside industrial-sized washing
machines. Skinner's co-pilot, Ron Smith, said he hid in a ditch
covered with a cloth.
   Uta Baker, a 45-year-old flight attendant wearing a tuxedo
jacket given her by a Marriott maitre d', said she saw flares going
up in the middle of the night and thought it was a celebration.
   ``I went back to sleep and at 6 in the morning, the captain
called and told us we were under siege,'' she said.
   Some passengers told of being under fire as they were taken to
the air base. While U.S. officials have described the continuing
operation in Panama as ``mopping up,'' Moses Leader, a Jamaican,
said it looked like a battle to him.
   ``Downtown Panama City is in rubble,'' he said. ``The Americans
underestimated the staying power of the PDF,'' Panama's armed
forces.
   ``We had to take cover at the air base. We had to get away from
the glass,'' he said.
   Fairborn Maxwell, a 45-year-old Jamaican, was upset because he
was gambling in the casino when the Panamanians stormed the hotel.
They briefly held him but released him when they found he was not
American.
   He brought his chips back to Miami, because he couldn't cash
them in.
   ``I was winning with a stack of chips when they came in and took
us,'' he said ruefully.

<HEAD>Former Unisys Security Guard Charged With Manipulating Payroll</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former head of security for Unisys Corp.
was charged Friday with manipulating payroll records, leading the
company to overcharge the federal government $70,732.
   Joseph Schulz, 60, of Richboro, was charged with causing false
statements to be made to the Department of Defense from September
1986 to September 1988.
   During that time, Schulz was employed as a guard captain for
National Guardian Security Services, which provided security to
Unisys on government contract work, according to U.S. Attorney
Michael Baylson.
   Schulz was responsible for scheduling and supervising guards at
Unisys.
   According to the charges, Schulz manipulated payroll records to
show that more security guards were on duty than actually worked,
resulting in Unisys sending false invoices to the Defense
Department for payment.
   If convicted, Schulz faces a maximum penalty of five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine, according to Baylson.
   No one answered at a phone listed in Schulz's name to comment on
the charge Friday night.

<TEXT>
   China on Saturday denied giving sanctuary to
ousted Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu.
   ``The notion that Ceausescu has fled to China is utterly
groundless,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
   The 71-year-old Ceausescu was variously reported to have fled
Bucharest after being overthrown Friday, but his whereabouts remain
unknown.
   Beijing has long been a staunch supporter of Ceausescu's
hard-line government, and there was speculation he might seek
refuge in China.
   Ceausescu backed China's bloody suppression of the student-led
pro-democracy movement last spring, and China's Communist Party
chief Jiang Zemin spoke recently of the ``sincere and profound''
friendship between the two countries.
   The Foreign Ministry declined comment on Ceausescu's demise, and
there were no reports of events in Romania in either the official
Xinhua News Agency or the Communist Party's People's Daily.
   Ceausescu has visited China at least six times during his
24-year reign. His last official trip was in October 1988.

<TEXT>
   North Korea launched a campaign Friday to promote
socialism, warning that it could be destroyed by political reform
and a multiparty system.
   Radio Press, a private Japanese news agency that monitors
Communist news reports, said the campaign suggests that North Korea
is watching the recent reforms in East Europe with ``a strong sense
of crisis.''
   ``If political pluralism and the multiparty system were allowed
in socialist society, they would bring grave consequences.
Anti-socialist forces may come to the fore and destroy the
political unity of the popular masses and fundamentally demolish
the socialist system,'' ruling Communist officials of North Korea
said.
   Official Radio Pyongyang broadcast news of the campaign in a
50-minute report from the Communists' Workers Party organ, Rodong
Sinmun. The Korean Central News Agency carried a full text of the
Rodong Sinmun article as well as eight other related stories.
   North Korean media have remained silent on the dramatic changes
in Eastern Europe, and the reports Friday did not mention them.
   However, an article carried by the Korean Central News Agency's
English service said socialism ``is facing a grave challenge.''
   The article asserted that the socialist system was bound to win
out. ``Socialism tomorrow which withstood challenge of the
imperialists today is sure to be crowned with the honor of final
victory,'' it said.
   North Korea, one of the most isolated countries in the world,
has been making a timid attempt to emulate the policies of openness
and economic reform undertaken by China and the Soviet Union.
   However, the hard-line state remains firmly under the grip of
President Kim Il Sung, who has been ruling it since 1945. Neither
he nor his heir-designate son, Kim Jong Il, has shown signs of a
desire for major reform.
   The party article said, ``The capitalists not only oppose the
socialist, communist idea _ a great ideology which indicates the
path of a worthy life of man _ but also spread reactionary
bourgeois ideology and culture ....
   The article went on to say: ``If there is a crisis in socialist
countries, it is not a crisis resulting from `lack' of commodities,
but a crisis resulting from lack of communist ideology.''
   ``The only effective prescription to cure the fatal disease of
the capitalist society and achieve world peace and common
prosperity of mankind is to liquidate the capitalist exploiting
system and advance toward socialism,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   More than a decade of separation was all but
forgotten when six members of a Vietnamese family joyously reunited
with their parents, three brothers and a sister Friday at Los
Angeles International Airport.
   Sobs and screams greeted the long-awaited arrival of 65-year-old
Nguyen Van Nhu, his wife Yen and three of their children, who were
seeing the rest of their family for the first time since the
Vietnam War tore them apart.
   ``Thank you, America, thank you!'' shouted Barry Nguyen, 29, one
of six members of the family who reside in the United States.
``This is the greatest day of my life.''
   Tears streamed down his face as he ran to embrace his parents,
whom he had not seen since leaving Vietnam in 1978.
   For his 32-year-old brother Bruce, the wait had been even
longer. He last saw his mother and father in 1972 before he left
his native Saigon to join the army.
   ``It means so much to see my father for Christmas,'' he said as
his three sons met their grandfather for the first time. ``Now they
have freedom.''
   The Nguyens flocked together in the middle of the airport
terminal, hugging and crying as a group of more than 20 friends and
relatives welcomed the new arrivals with flowers and gifts.
   Three of the Nguyen children have been in the United States
since 1975 when the fall of Saigon forced them to flee by boat to
Thailand. Since then, Bruce, Catherine, 28, and Anna, 29, have been
joined by two brothers and a sister. All now have children of their
own.
   Friday's reunion capped a six-year effort to bring the rest of
the family to the United States permanently. The new arrivals
included Duc, 25; Hoa, 23; Binh, 22, and Thinh, 21. One sister,
35-year-old Luu, remains in Vietnam due to emigration problems.
   ``I remember my brothers and sisters in Vietnam when they were
just little children,'' said Bruce, who like most of his siblings
have adopted Anglicized names.
   Bruce, Catherine and Barry work for the U.S. Postal Service.
They, along with John, 30, and The, 37, have secured housing for
their parents and jobs for their siblings.
   ``The first thing we will do is have a party to celebrate,''
Bruce said.

   Here is a brief summary of events in Panama:
   _Supporters of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega fired mortars and
attacked buildings near the U.S. Southern Command. The fighting
lasted about an hour. Sporadic fighting and sniper fire continued
in many areas of Panama City.
   _A Pentagon source said an additional 2,000 Army soldiers would
be flown to Panama to supplement the 24,000 already in the country.
   _Noriega loyalists tried to assassinate the Panamanian vice
president installed by the United States. He was not injured.
   _Several pro-Noriega bands surrendered in western Panama.
   _Gen. Maxwell Thurman, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, said
until Noriega is captured he will be a ``guiding hand'' behind
resistance to the U.S. occupation.
   _American forces rescued a Smithsonian Institution research team
abducted by Noriega soldiers.
   _Looters ransacked stores for the third day. Refugees fleeing
the fighting took cover in soccer stadiums, churches and schools.
   _President Bush told Congress it was impossible to predict the
``scope and duration'' of the U.S. intervention.
   _The Organization of American States said in Washington it
``deeply deplored'' the invasion and called for withdrawal of
American forces.
   _Twenty-one American troops and two female dependents have been
killed, 202 wounded and two soldiers and one civilian are missing.
U.S. officials said 122 Panamanian soldiers were killed and 45
wounded. Hospital officials said they believed half the Panamanian
casualties were civilian.

   President Bush says the United States will
hunt for deposed dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega for ``as long as
it takes'' to bring him to justice, at the same time thousands of
U.S. troops settle in on Panamanian soil to help restore order in a
chaotic country.
   ``This operation is not over, but it's pretty well wrapped up,''
Bush said Thursday at a news conference that coincided with return
of the first bodies of U.S. soldiers killed in the massive strike
in Panama.
   ``General Noriega is no longer in power. He no longer commands
the instruments of government or the forces of repression that he's
used for so long to brutalize the Panamanian people,'' Bush said.
   At the same time, the president said the U.S. military operation
was ``open-ended as far as going after Noriega, open-ended as far
as restoration of order in Panama,'' where looters were hauling
away goods from virtually every shop in Panama City. Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney said a sizeable troop presence would remain
until a ``condition of normalcy'' had returned.

   U.S.-backed President Guillermo

and making his first handful of appointments.
   Under heavy U.S. guard, Endara and his two vice presidents met
Thursday with members of the national legislative assembly. Later,
he said he hoped to organize a new police force to take over within
a month from U.S. military forces now seeking to impose order and
searching for ousted dictator Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``I think we can lift up the country and ... do our duty in
making peace and quiet in Panama, peace and justice in Panama with
Noriega in hiding,'' Endara said in a telephone interview with
ABC's ``Nightline'' program Thursday night.
   ``I hope in a month we can put up a police force, a public force
good enough to keep peace and order in all Panama. And then the
U.S. forces would leave according to what Mr. Bush promised us,''

   President Bush is preparing to lift a ban on
federal government loans to Iraq, a move expected to rile lawmakers
opposed to the country's human rights abuses, heavy indebtedness
and ballistic missile program, administration officials say.
   Bush is expected to invoke a provision allowing him to lift the
ban _ imposed by Congress several months ago _ on grounds of U.S.
national interests, according to the officials who spoke Thursday
on condition of anonymity.
   The United States, which reestablished ties with Iraq in 1984,
has been seeking to increase its influence over the government of
strongman Sadam Hussein.
   The administration is especially eager to expand trade with
Hussein, who commands a powerful military force and the world's

   Successes and failures in the war against AIDS
show that concern for patients' rights is essential if health
authorities hope to stem the epidemic, the director of the World
Health Organization's AIDS program says.
   In an interview Thursday, Dr. Jonathan Mann said many of the
discriminatory laws put in place during the initial panic earlier
in the '80s have been repealed as governments discovered the laws
were impeding efforts to fight the disease's spread.
   ``We made a big discovery during the 1980s that ranks right up
there with the discovery of the virus and the modes of spread,''
Mann said by telephone from Geneva. ``And that discovery is that to
fight this global epidemic of infectious disease, you must also
fight against prejudice and discrimination.''
   Health officials have been successful in curbing risky sexual
behavior among homosexual men in San Francisco and among female
prostitutes in Nairobi, Kenya and Peru, among other places, Mann
said.

<HEAD>Book on Swiss Army Hits Best-Seller Lists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It doesn't compare with his
``Stiller'' or other works that won worldwide attention. But at 78,
novelist-playwright Max Frisch has broken eight years of literary
silence and has returned to Swiss best-seller lists.
   The subject of his new book is Switzerland's militia army, which
has not fought a foreign war in five centuries. The army has
fascinated him since he boarded a train on Sept. 1, 1939 to join an
artillery unit based in the Alps. At that time he was convinced he
would help defend the neutral country against an invasion by the
Nazis. His concern focused on a German Jewish resident of Basel,
who was then his girlfriend.
   Two of his books, published in 1940 and 1974, deal with his
wartime experience, marking his conversion to increasingly radical
pacificism. The third was jotted down in barely two months last
spring.
   It was timed to add fuel to a nationwide debate on a recent
proposal that sought the abolition of the 625,000-man Swiss army.
   Frisch's new ``Switzerland Without an Army?'' features a
sparsely worded dialogue between a ``grandfather,'' easily
identifiable as the author himself, and his ``grandson,'' Jonas.
   Subtitled ``A Palaver,'' it is actually a collection of pros and
cons in the debate, though Frisch makes no secret of his opinion.
   ``We need the army, seriously,'' the grandfather at one point
tells a doubting Jonas, who is thinking of possibly emigrating to
the United States. The grandfather lists the well-worn whys _
``school of life, school of men, school of the nation'' _ before
adding what to him is the principal reason, ``the bodyguard of the
reign of the wealthy.''
   Once more, Frisch shows himself as a disillusioned critic of the
Swiss system.
   ``Their misery is the purchasing power without any great hope,''
the grandfather says of his compatriots. ``They spend their
vacations in the service of economic growth.''
   The army is not ``our army,'' Jonas is told, but an ``army that
is maneuvering on our territory as the army of the Swiss society of
finance and officers.''
   The book went into its fifth edition three months after
publication, and has been translated into four languages.
   A dramatized version, ``Jonas and His Veteran,'' premiered at
Zurich's prestigious Schauspielhaus theater Oct. 20, directed by
Benno Besson, a Swiss disciple of Bertolt Brecht. A French language
version went on stage one day later at Lausanne. The performances
drew rounds of applause, but reviewers were mixed.
   ``It is a convincing text,'' said the Zurich weekly
Sonntagszeitung, praising Frisch's ``subtle argumentation, (and)
his stylistic elegance.'' The reasons presented are of such
``cogent logic that the question ought to be on the mind of
everyone leaving the theater: How could one ever believe in the
institution of the army?''
   For the Berner Zeitung of Bern, the play showed that the idea of
a Switzerland without an army can be the subject of a ``spirited
discussion.''
   Another Bern newspaper, Der Bund, said the play ``lacked the
stylistic power, the poetic weight and dramaturgic logic of
`Triptych,''' the last work Frisch wrote exclusively for the stage
in 1978.
   Frisch's ``grandfather'' is sure the Swiss army is sure to stay.
``If the Swiss army is ever be disbanded, it will not be by a
referendum but by a war.''

expanded in size. But there is no sign Israel is ready to withdraw
from southern Lebanon and leave the fighting to its allies.
   With Israeli advisers and reporters watching, the SLA recently
showed off its gunnery prowess in a live-fire exercise with a dozen
Soviet T-55 tanks captured by the Israelis from the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Gun barrels flashed and the aging tanks, painted gray, knocked
out rusty trucks on a hillside nearly a half-mile away.
   The Lebanese crews, silhouetted on a ridgeline, could be seen
jumping and waving their arms with delight.
   The exercise, Israeli advisers stressed, marked a significant
improvement in the military capabilities of the militia that helps
Israeli troops patrol a security zone that is 2.5 to 12 miles deep
just north of Israel's border.
   However, some observers see a major problem with the militia's
reliability and discipline.
   The SLA has caused Israel political embarrassment by getting
involved in shooting incidents with the nine-nation, 5,700-member
United Nations peackeeping force that patrols north of the security
zone.
   It also has stirred up anti-Israeli sentiment with
indiscriminate shellings of Shiite Moslem villages.
   The SLA commander, Antoine Lahad, 62, a retired Lebanese army
general, told reporters his force made a ``lot of improvement''
since Israel withdrew the bulk of its troops from Lebanon in 1985.
   ``The SLA was more like a militia. Now it has developed into a
small regular army,'' he said, adding the force numbered 3,000 men,
up from 2,000 a year ago, and may expand further.
   Lahad, who survived a communist-inspired assassination attempt
in November 1988, said an Israeli presence was needed until Syria
withdrew its 40,000 troops from Lebanon.
   ``The day we face Lebanese opponents only, we can do without the
backing of the Israeli army,'' said Lahad, a Christian whose
militia controls an area with a predominantly Shiite Moslem
population of 200,000.
   Israel has stationed troops in Lebanon since shortly after
Lebanon's civil war began in 1975.
   Col. Renaan Gissin, deputy spokesman for the Israeli army, said
Israel had no plans to leave but also had no interest in Lebanon
beyond protecting its 60-mile border.
   He added that the zone had proved a success because life in
northern Israel was normal and no Israeli civilian had died in an
attack from Lebanon since 1985.
   The SLA's reliability remains a major question mark, however.
   In recent years, the Christian-led force was riddled with
defections by Shiites, had its positions overrun by Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrillas and proved unable to stop Palestinian
infiltrations into the security zone.
   The SLA has also borne the brunt of Shiite and Palestinian
attacks, suffering 188 killed and 600 wounded in the past four
years. So far this year, the SLA came under 350 guerrilla attacks,
about half the level of the previous year.
   Despite the improvements, some experts are less confident of the
SLA's ability to restrain its militiamen from exacting revenge and
say the force is incapable of standing up to guerrilla attacks
without Israeli troops, estimated by foreign reports to number at
least 1,000.
   ``The SLA will hold on as long as Israeli army is the backbone.
Discipline is good as long as Israeli officers are there,'' said
Yoram Hamizrachi, a retired colonel who was in charge of training
the SLA from 1977 to 1980.
   ``They are improving in military skills. They can read maps and
coordinate their actions. But they have a tendency to lose their
tempers. I wouldn't trust them in anything major.''
   In early December, for example, SLA gunners retaliated for the
ambush killing of three SLA militiamen by firing sporadic barrages
at civilian areas north of the security zone. Lebanese reports said
nine civilians were killed in the Shiite town of Nabatiyeh.
   The Shiite leader, Nabih Berri, responded with a warning that
his Amal militiamen would shell Israeli settlements if the SLA
attacks persisted.
   Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, Israel's northern front commander,
conceded in a recent interview that he had frequent arguments with
SLA commanders about the use of force.
   He said that it was normal for Lebanese militias to fire 100 to
300 shells into a small village.
   Peled said it was ``quite difficult'' to get the SLA to
understand Israel's objections but ``during the past two or three
years we succeeded to change their behavior. I don't know if it
will go back the way it was, but there has been a tremendous
change.''

   This is another in an occasional series of
articles on the proliferation of moviemaking outside Hollywood.
Tempted by friendly officials eager to please, filmmakers are
flocking to out-of-state locations, spending billions of dollars
that once would have stayed in California.

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only a handful of bystanders watched as actor
James Spader strode out of Ed's Sandwich Shop, tossed his scarf
over his right shoulder and turned around to do it over again and
again and again.
   Hollywood comes to midtown St. Louis.
   If it weren't for the fact that the street was blocked off for
the cameras, the sight hardly would have stopped traffic.
   ``It's not like we're setting houses on fire,'' said Spooky
Stevens, the publicist for the movie ``White Palace,'' starring
Spader and Susan Sarandon. ``After 20 minutes of standing out here
and freezing to death, they'll go home.'' Sure enough, most people
didn't stay long, but then St. Louisans have gotten used to having
the ``White Palace'' crew around town.
   In fact, movie-making has become more and more routine all
across Missouri in recent years, thanks in part to the efforts of
the Missouri Film Commission and the St. Louis Film Partnership,
both just a few years old.
   The commission was formed in 1985 as a program of the state's
Department of Economic Development. The partnership was started two
years later. It is funded by the St. Louis County Economic Council,
the city of St. Louis, the St. Louis Convention and Visitors
Commission, the Regional Commerce and Growth Association and the
Regional Cultural and Performing Arts Development Commission.
   The two groups have jumped headfirst into a worldwide tussle for
movie dollars, competing with more established film commissions in
other states, cities and even foreign countries. All try to woo
filmmakers with slick catalogs, location scouting and expert
technical help.
   Still, even though 42 states have film offices and actively
compete for business, California remains the film leader of the
United States, with New York close at its heels.
   Though not always cheaper, it's easier to make a movie outside
California. One-stop, state-controlled film offices are preferred
to California's patchwork approach, where local governments issue
permits with fluctuating fees and have requirements that are 70
years old.
   
   And the long-held belief that Hollywood could re-create anything
from the Tara plantation in ``Gone With the Wind'' to the Las Vegas
Strip in ``One From the Heart'' has been abandoned by filmmakers
who want greater realism.
   ``It's very stale to shoot in the same place,'' said Kate
Arnold, production coordinator for the Missouri Film Commission.
``Authenticity is important these days.''
   It's important for the cities and states that land the films,
too. During the first year of its existence, the film commission
helped bring in $4.1 million to the state's economy. Last year, the
film industry meant $16.5 million to Missouri.
   ``On-location filming is a growing industry that brings dollars
and jobs to the state,'' said Gary Gonder, manager of the
commission. ``These major projects also put the spotlight on
Missouri, which helps our state industrial recruitment efforts,
too.''
   Since May, four features have been filmed in the state:
   _ ``White Palace,'' based on St. Louisan Glenn Savan's first
novel about a yuppie St. Louis advertising executive who, after the
death of his young wife, becomes obsessed with a lusty, older woman
who works in a fast-food restaurant. All but three days are being
filmed in and around St. Louis, and the movie is expected to be
released in the fall of 1990.
   _ ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge,'' starring Paul Newman and Joanne
Woodward and filmed around Kansas City. Based on two novels, ``Mrs.
Bridge'' and ``Mr. Bridge'' by Evan S. Connell, the story spans 40
years in the lives of a quintessential American couple in Kansas
City. Shooting is completed, and the movie is expected to be
released next summer. Arnold said that while Newman was filming in
Kansas City, the makers of Cordon Negro champagne spent more than
$1 million there to film a commercial with him.
   _ ``Miss Missouri,'' a French production filmed in Kansas City
and surrounding communities. The story is about a former Miss
Missouri who travels to Europe and falls in love with a Frenchman.
Afraid he will discover that she had been married before and has a
child, she flees and returns to her home. The shooting is
completed, and the movie is scheduled to premiere at the Cannes
Film Festival next spring.
   _ ``Detour,'' an independent production directed by Kansas
Citian Wade Williams and filmed mostly in Kansas City. It's a new
version of a 1945 movie about a man who picks up a hitchhiker and
gets involved in murder. The shooting is scheduled to be completed
in December.
   What sold the movie moguls on Missouri?
   In the case of ``White Palace,'' a big reason was the desire to
capture the real flavor of St. Louis, where the story takes place.
``Why try to import natural flavor when you have it right here?''
said Stevens.
   The efforts of the two film commissions paid off, too, she said.
   But sometimes winning the hearts of a movie producer doesn't go
so smoothly.
   The makers of ``Parenthood,'' a story supposedly set in St.
Louis, opted to forfeit realism for warm weather and shoot in
Orlando, Fla. But then again, ``Escape From New York'' was shot in
St. Louis, not New York.
   Janis Rockwell-Strong, executive director of the St. Louis Film
Partnership, set about luring the producers of ``White Palace'' to
St. Louis months before their cameras rolled into town. When she
heard that the movie rights to the book had been bought, she
started firing off letters.
   ``I said I'm from St. Louis, this is a book from St. Louis and I
want you to know we're interested,'' Rockwell-Strong said.
   Over the following months, Rockwell-Strong took dozens of
pictures of various St. Louis neighborhoods and sent them off to
the producers. Then she took them around town when they came to
look for themselves.
   ``I rented the van and we showed them St. Louis,''
Rockwell-Strong said. ``We showed them the various looks.''
   It worked. Filming began Oct. 25.

<HEAD>British Engineering Workers Take Up Fight for 35-Hour Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   KINGSTON-UPON-THAMES, England (AP) _ Engineering workers have
taken up the cause of a 35-hour work week in Britain, where they
are striking for longer weekends without cuts in pay.
   Among those targeted have been Rolls-Royce PLC, a maker of
aviation engines, and British Aerospace PLC, which makes Harrier
vertical-takeoff ``jump jets.''
   The Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions has
brought 10,000 workers out on strike since mid-October in a
selective campaign to shorten Britain's basic 39-hour work week for
its 2 million members, nearly all in engineering industries.
   ``If you give people the opportunity, they would opt for a
longer weekend or an extra holiday rather than a pay raise,'' said
its general secretary, Alex Ferry.
   ``The hours of relaxation have become more and more important.''
   The 17-union confederation targeted four companies, and has
already reached agreement on a 37-hour week by 1992 with three of
them, including Rolls-Royce aviation subsidiary Smiths Industries
PLC of Cheltenham in southwest England, and NEI-Parsons Ltd., an
engineering company in Newcastle in the northeast.
   Some 2,000 manual workers at Rolls-Royce in Glasgow, Scotland,
voted Dec. 16 to end a six-week strike after being offered a
37-hour week by November 1991.
   In return, local unions have agreed to greater flexibility on
working practices and on job training to enable workers to become
more adept and more productive.
   A month-old strike of 7,100 manual workers at British Aerospace
plants in Preston, Chester and Kingston-upon-Thames is expected to
last into the new year.
   The confederation has threatened to hit more of Britain's 5,000
engineering companies with walkouts in 1990 if they do not reduce
their basic hours without cutting pay.
   The Engineering Employers Federation on Nov. 16 suspended
nationwide bargaining with unions over the 35-hour dispute, and
left each company to hammer out individual deals.
   For years, labor unions have argued that a shorter work week
will create new jobs and curb high unemployment.
   The 35-hour goal was at the heart of a key West German metal
workers strike in 1984.
   The campaign, which also surfaced periodically in countries such
as Denmark, France and Italy in the 1980s, has lowered the average
basic work week for manual workers to between 37{ hours and 39
hours in at least 10 West European countries, according to the
International Labor Organization in Geneva.
   That compares with the standard U.S. work week of 40 hours,
which has remained unchanged since World War II.
   In recent years, average annual paid vacations also have
lengthened to at least five weeks in France, Spain, Denmark,
Finland, Austria, Luxembourg, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and
West Germany.
   In the United States, manual workers get an average of 12 days
annual leave.
   At British Aerospace's military aircraft division in
Kingston-upon-Thames near London, 1,200 manual workers have been on
strike since mid-November.
   British Aerospace is insisting on a return to work as a
precondition of negotiations.
   Deryck Gomez, a 21-year company veteran, says British Aerospace
already presses workers to work an extra six hours a week on
average to meet its production schedule of 24 Harriers for the U.S.
Marine Corps and 20 for Britain's Royal Air Force.
   ``The leisure is more important to me than working overtime,''
Gomez said. ``You spend more time with the wife and kids.
   ``People who work here, they get so uptight. There's been more
work on the Harrier than ever before. It's more detailed work.''
   Skilled assembly-line workers at British Aerospace earn the
equivalent of about $340 a week in basic pay and get five weeks'
vacation.
   Engineering unions favor the shorter week as an inflation-proof
pay rise, and argue they have earned it because productivity has
risen 43 percent since 1979, when the work week slipped from 40 to
39 hours across most of Western Europe.
   The unions claim a shorter work week also will recover some of
the 1 million engineering jobs lost to recession and technological
advances in Britain in the last decade.
   But employers fear that without flexibility, a 35-hour week
could blunt further Britain's competitive edge against overseas
rivals.
   ``What companies have to ensure when they make these agreements
is their productivity doesn't suffer,'' said Brian Balcomb,
spokesman for the employers federation.
   He said trade union statistics show productivity in British
engineering lags that of France and West Germany by 55 percent and
Japan and the United States by more than 100 percent.

<HEAD>Academy Award Race Will Feature More Modest Movies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The entries for the 62nd Academy Awards have
all made their appearances, and the race shapes up as a contest
between the little people and the giants.
   Critics' awards have already appeared, and although they tend to
be more esoteric than the Oscars, the choices indicate a trend
toward more modest films.
   Spike Lee's ``Do the Right Thing'' was named best picture by the
Los Angeles critics, edging out ``Drugstore Cowboy.'' The New York
Film Critics Circle chose ``My Left Foot,'' and the National Board
of Review selected ``Driving Miss Daisy.''
   Observers believe that Academy voters will nominate many of the
independent and minor-budget films and pay little heed to the
multimillion-dollar grossers of 1989, such as ``Batman,'' ``Indiana
Jones and the Last Crusade,'' ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' ``Look
Who's Talking'' and ``Ghostbusters II.''
   Victory for the independents would mirror the 1985 awards, when
two low-budget films won acting honors: Geraldine Page in ``The
Trip to Bountiful'' and William Hurt in ``Kiss of the Spider
Woman.''
   Here's how the Oscar race appears to this onlooker:
   _ Best Picture. The question is: Will Academy voters remember
well-praised films released earlier in the year? If they do, such
pictures as ``sex, lies and videotape,'' ``Do the Right Thing,''
``When Harry Met Sally...'' and ``Field of Dreams'' might be
recognized. But the voters have notoriously short memories, and
they may select such recent arrivals as ``Enemies, A Love Story,''
``Glory,'' ``Driving Miss Daisy'' and ``Born on the Fourth of
July.'' Two imports, ``My Left Foot'' and ``Henry V'' also stand a
chance.
   _ Best actor. Morgan Freeman seems a certain nominee for his
role as the devoted chauffeur in ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' rather
than his supporting role as a Union soldier in ``Glory.'' Daniel
Day-Lewis is a favorite as the cerebral palsy victim in ``My Left
Foot.''
   However, oldline Academy members may want to reward the
veterans: Gregory Peck as the iconoclastic Ambrose Bierce in ``Old
Gringo''; Jack Lemmon as the befuddled oldster in ``Dad''; Jack
Nicholson as the Joker in ``Batman''; Paul Newman as roistering
Earl Long in ``Blaze.'' Then there are the noteworthy newcomers:
Tom Cruise, the Vietnam veteran in ``Born on the Fourth of July'';
Kenneth Brannagh as the ruler ``Henry V''; Ron Silver as the
much-married Holocaust survivor in ``Enemies, A Love Story.''
   _ Best actress. The leaders present a marked contrast: Jessica
Tandy, the cantankerous widow in ``Driving Miss Daisy'' and
Michelle Pfeiffer, the sexpot chanteuse in ``The Fabulous Baker
Boys.'' Other favorites are Andie MacDowell, the betrayed wife in
``sex, lies and videotape''; Pauline Collins, the liberated
housewife in ``Shirley Valentine''; and Meg Ryan, the career woman
looking for love in ``When Harry Met Sally...''
   Kathleen Turner could attract votes for her battling wife in
``The War of the Roses,'' as well as Sally Field for her grieving
mother in ``Steel Magnolias.'' Other contenders could very well be
Jessica Lange, the lawyer defending her father in ``Music Box,''
and perennial nominee Meryl Streep, the romance novelist of
``She-Devil.''
   _ Best supporting actor. Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman
could both be contending as the Union soldiers in ``Glory.'' Martin
Landau and Alan Alda might compete for their roles in ``Crimes and
Misdemeanors.''
   Other possibilities include James Earl Jones, ``Field of
Dreams''; Danny Aiello, ``Do the Right Thing''; Armin
Muehller-Stahl, ``Music Box''; Robert Loggia, ``Triumph of the
Spirit''; and the late Ray McAnally, ``My Left Foot.''
   _ Best supporting actress. There's a mixed field including Julie
Roberts, ``Steel Magnolias''; Laura San Giacomo, ``sex, lies and
videotape''; Anjelica Huston and Lena Olin, ``Enemies, A Love
Story''; Diane Wiest, ``Parenthood''; Mary Stuart Masteron,
``Immediate Family''; Olympia Dukakis, ``Dad''; and Brenda Fricker,
``My Left Foot.''
   _ Best director. This category is usually dictated by the
choices for best picture. The leading candidates are neophyte
Steven Soderbergh, ``sex, lies and videotape''; Paul Mazursky,
``Enemies, A Love Story''; Oliver Stone, ``Born on the Fourth of
July''; Bruce Beresford, ``Driving Miss Daisy''; Costa-Gavras,
``Music Box''; and Jim Sheridan, ``My Left Foot.''
   Some of the above will receive the best possible Valentines when
the Academy nominations are disclosed on Feb. 14. The winners will
be announced from the stage of the Los Angeles Music Center on
March 26.

<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the more successful books of the
Christmas selling season is a work of art, ``In The West,'' a bound
portfolio of some of artist Georgia O'Keeffe's best work. It costs
$100.
   While that in itself is a story, since book publishing has had
its woes, the saga behind the book is a rare one of
entrepreneurship involving a young publisher guided by heart and
soul rather than a business degree.
   Nicholas Callaway was a Harvard classics student in 1973 when
the artist came to the school to receive an honorary degree. ``I
wanted to see the person I had admired in the photographs (by her
husband, Alfred Stieglitz),'' he said.
   A junior, Callaway wasn't involved in the ceremony, so he had to
improvise. O'Keeffe loved flowers. ``I went to a florist in Harvard
Square and bought a peony,'' he said, and then worked his way
through the crowd in the yard.
   ``There she was,'' he said, ``the woman in the photographs.'' As
she passed in procession he held out the peony, saying ``This is
for you Mrs. O'Keeffe.'' She took it, instinctively, it seemed, and
held it throughout the ceremony.
   O'Keeffe, then 85, seldom corresponded with admirers, but
Callaway had been mesmerized. He wrote to her the following year.
She replied, saying she had always wondered who gave her the peony.
She invited him for a visit.
   Callaway spent a day with O'Keeffe at Ghost Ranch, her studio
near Abiquiu, N.M. It intensified his feelings. At the time, he had
no thought of publishing, but the classics scholar felt drawn more
intensely toward studio arts.
   He recalled the flower episode a few days ago, and briefly dwelt
on its meaning in his life, and perhaps in the lives of would-be
entrepreneurs.
   ``When you are drawn to something you must seize the
opportunity. There is no reason to hesitate in pursuing an
intuition, attraction or interest,'' he said.
   ``Had I not handed her the flower,'' he reflected, ``a lot of
other things might not have happened.''
   Callaway experimented with photography before he left Harvard,
traveled to Europe on a fellowship, studied art, apprenticed
himself to a fine printer in Paris and then was asked by a friend
to run an art gallery there.
   The experiences were revealing. Callaway, 23, found he could
combine art and business _ that, in fact, he was a good
businessman. The elements were coming together, he said, and
convinced him to have his own operation.
   Back in America, his brother, like his father, an entrepreneur,
lent him money to publish his first book, ``Brancusi: The Sculptor
as Photographer.'' He sold 3,000 copies at $19.95.
   He went to see O'Keeffe again, found she wanted to publish a
book of her husband's photographs, couldn't resist the challenge
and daringly won the right to co-publish the work with The National
Gallery of Art. He had four employees.
   The book was a huge success, critically and commercially. He was
on his way, working from a Greenwich Village studio but printing in
Kyoto, Japan.
   Callaway Editions, Inc. still has only eight people, but
smallness is its strength. Big up-front costs, typical in book
publishing, are not easily met by small companies, so Callaway
restructured and focused his efforts.
   That restructuring seems to have defined the way fine books are
published in the future. Callaway and similarly small companies now
often co-publish with large, established houses, combining the
strengths of each.
   The small company specializes in concepts, editorial matter and
production. ``We concentrate on making the book, and they (bigger
publishers) do what they do best: financing, marketing, sales and
distribution,'' he says.
   The Callaway staff is intense, perfectionist, dedicated,
creative. And enterprising: They must, for instance, develop leads
from decades-old telephone books to find owners of paintings, and
then seek permission to photograph.
   ``In The West'' is the second of four O'Keeffe volumes scheduled
for co-publishing with the esteemed house of Alfred Knopf, part of
Random House, and edited by Callaway and Doris Bry, an O'Keeffe
associate and scholar.
   The first, ``One Hundred Flowers,'' in two years sold nearly
75,000 hardbound copies at $100, and more than 100,000 in a $29.95
softcover edition. Previously, no $100 trade art book had sold more
than about 15,000 copies.
   That's just part of the commercial success. Callaway and Knopf
have found that O'Keeffe, an American icon, is a world industry.
About 150,000 ``One Hundred Flowers'' calendars sold at $12.95,
with another edition out for 1990.
   Parts of ``In The West'' also will take multiple forms: a wall
calendar to be sure; a $16.95 engagement desk book (75,000 copies),
a $9.95 post card book with two images of 12 paintings (30,000),
and an $18.95 address book (35,000).
   The works will be published in Canada, the United Kingdom,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Scandinavia, again with partners
in each country. ``We could not do what we do without larger
companies,'' says Callaway.
   But what they do is what they love to do, eight intense people
in a small Greenwich Village studio. It makes a difference.

<HEAD>Housing Is Still A Good Investment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For financial analysts seeking an audience there
is an almost sure formula: forecast that the housing market is
going to be reduced to rubble.
   Anything about housing has a wide audience. More than 60 percent
of households own their homes, and many renters would like to own.
   Homeowners have big investments. They worry about their money,
and they are alert to anything said or done that might affect it.
That includes forecasts, and helps explain why forecasts of housing
debacles never cease.
   Several years ago, in fact, a book was written about the coming
collapse of housing prices. The event was never recorded by any
economic statistic or seismograph, but it didn't deter the
forecaster.
   Similar warnings have been issued throughout 1989 and the surest
bet you can make is that the outpouring of doom, much of it from
financial people who tend to measure housing as an investment only,
will continue in 1990.
   At the moment, in fact, there exists a popular notion that
single-family home sales and prices have declined sharply in much
of the country, especially in the Northeast. Specific collapses,
always available, are used to illustrate.
   The specifics, however, don't always make a generalization.
   National data show that the median price of existing
single-family homes in October 1988 was $88,900. One year later, in
October of this year, it was $92,100. That's a gain of 3.6 percent.
   Data for the Northeast, compiled by the National Association of
Realtors, shows the price of typical new single-family homes in
October 1988 was $144,400, and in October 1989 $143,300. That's a
decline of 0.8 percent, hardly a disaster and one barely worth
mentioning in the stock market.
   At that, the significance might be overdone. Oddly, that decline
in the price of new houses, tiny as it is, might indicate strength
rather than weakness. To wit:
   Falling interest rates in 1989 encouraged buyers who earlier had
been priced out of the market. Clearly, these people wouldn't seek
the most expensive homes; they would buy in the middle ranges,
creating a lower median.
   In spite of warnings and forecasts, home prices have been
remarkably stable or strong year after year. Industrial and
commercial real estate might not have done well, but single-family
housing is distinct from them.
   What has changed is the fortunes of banks that made bad loans,
and in this way a banking problem becomes a so-called crisis in
real estate.
   Since 1972, Census Bureau figures show not one year in which
prices of new and existing homes have failed to rise nationally,
although there have indeed been been regional or local declines.
   But, while bad news in one stock, unless it is IBM or General
Motors, rarely is used to suggest a general market decline, that
reasoning isn't always applied to housing.
   Housing is, in fact, an even better investment than shown on
some popular Wall Street charts of relative values. Most charts of
comparative investments relate the percentage gains in housing to
the total price. However, most Americans put down but a fraction of
the price when buying homes. They take loans instead.
   When ordinary folks buy stock they usually pay full price rather
than go on margin, or borrow from the broker. To borrow may be
unwise because of volatility. So, if a $10 stock rises $1 they
usually have a 10 percent gain.
   When a $50,000 house, bought with $5,000 down, rises in value to
$55,000 the apparent gain is also 10 percent. But, since it was
purchased with only $5,000 down the real return to the homeowner is
100 percent.
   The homeowner pays interest on the mortgage, and real estate
taxes, insurance and upkeep, but he or she also receives big income
tax deductions not available to shareowners, and gets to sleep in
the home-investment.
   Remember it the next time financial ``experts'' proclaim the end
of the world in housing. And remember, some of these are the same
ones who created a brokerage house recession and billions in bad
loans for banks.

<HEAD>Dorian Harewood Plays Tough Base Commander on `China Beach'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dorian Harewood is a hard-nosed Army major
who meets the hardhearted K.C. on ``China Beach'' and sees himself
as her Henry Higgins.
   ``He knows she's a prostitute, but he thinks he can be her
savior,'' said Harewood, who makes guest appearances on three
episodes of the ABC series.
   ``He wants to take this hard-as-nails prostitute and mold her
into a great human being. ... He falls for her and she for him, but
they have a communication problem and their flaws get in the way.''
   Harewood made one earlier appearance as Maj. Melvin P. Otis, the
new commander of the Vietnam medical and recreation center that is
the focus of the series. He returns Wednesday in the first of two
more episodes.
   K.C., played by Marg Helgenberger, is a prostitute who is
sometimes referred to as an ``entrepreneur'' since she's out to
make money off the war. K.C. doesn't want to be changed. In one
scene, where she tries on a dress Otis bought her, she looks in a
mirror and says, ``Donna Reed'' _ an obvious reference to Reed's
prostitute role in ``From Here to Eternity.''
   Little is made of the interracial aspect of the romance. ``There
is one scene where someone of limited thinking _ I won't call him a
redneck _ doesn't like to see a romance between a black man and a
white woman,'' Harewood said. ``What's great is that they don't
make that much over the fact that we're different colors.
   ``It focuses on the relationship. These characters have flaws.
They have personality problems. But neither is concerned about
their relationship being interracial.''
   Harewood said that in 1977 he was cast as a doctor in a pilot,
after the female love interest had already been set. ``She was
white and the producer said, `Why change it?' It got great reviews.
But the network was too gutless to put on a series about a black
doctor.''
   Harewood talked about his ``China Beach'' stint while wearing a
blue hospital robe, his head swathed in bandages, for a role in a
new feature film, ``Solar Crisis.'' He co-stars with Charlton
Heston, Tim Matheson and Peter Boyle in the science fiction
thriller set in the 21st century. Interior sets for a spaceship
filled an old warehouse near downtown Los Angeles.
   ``The story is that the Earth's burning up and we're trying to
return the atmosphere to a good condition,'' he said. ``One man
with a multinational corporation is making money off people's
misery and tries to stop us.
   ``I'm an astronaut who's tough but nice. He's similar to my
character on `China Beach,' although Maj. Otis is more of a bad
guy.''
   Early next year, Harewood and Perry King begin work on a new
pilot for ABC called ``The Knife &amp; Gun Club,'' based on a book
about emergency room surgeons.
   It's the second pilot for Harewood and King, who first
collaborated in the 1975 TV movie ``Foster &amp; Laurie.'' They were
police partners who were killed in an ambush in the true story.
   In another pilot, created by Harewood' wife, Ann McCurry, ``We
played brothers who had the same mother and met for the first time
at her funeral. We teamed up as investigative reporters for a
magazine. It was a great idea that wasn't translated to film. ABC
said it didn't work, but liked the chemistry between Perry and
myself and asked us to try again.''
   In ``The Knife &amp; Gun Club,'' slang for an emergency room, they
play two longtime friends who give up their practices to contract
with a hospital to run the emergency services.
   Harewood also is negotiating for a new movie and is developing a
Broadway musical based on ``To Sir With Love.''

   Dr. Sherif Awadallah came two years ago
to set up a program in reproductive endocrinology at Charleston
Area Medical Center.
   Last summer Awadallah pulled up stakes and went back to Ohio,
joining an exodus of doctors who say an indifferent legislature and
a hostile insurance industry make West Virginia a grim place to
practice medicine.
   ``It's complicated,'' he said. ``There was a lot for me to do
there. If I wasn't married with children I probably would have
stayed. But concerns about the regional economy, plus problems with
insurance _ that's a double whammy.''
   A decline in doctors, a national trend, has been worse in West
Virginia in recent years, threatening gains in medical care made
since the 1960s.
   Since the beginning of the year, more than 80 doctors have
stopped practicing in West Virginia, according to a legislative
task force, and fewer are settling here. The state Medical Board
licensed 318 new doctors in 1989, down from 346 last year and 414
in 1987.
   The Charleston Area Medical Center had three applicants for
every opening in its residency program a decade ago. Today, 22 of
118 slots are unfilled. And while 23 percent of the students at
West Virginia's three medical schools come from out of state,
nearly 35 percent won't stay once they've graduated.
   Those trends have left the state with 152 doctors per 100,000
residents, 37th among the states and well below the national
average of 189, according to the American Medical Association. Some
counties have no doctors at all.
   ``Some of the good people that you want standing over you in
surgery are leaving,'' said Dr. Phil Branson, an orthopedic surgeon
in Princeton. ``At this point I am watching how things go.''
   Many of West Virginia's 3,000 doctors blame the state's
political leadership, which they say traditionally has lagged in
controlling medical costs and protecting doctors from excessive
malpractice awards. The Legislature this year moved to control
runaway medical costs. Lawmakers say those measures may drive
doctors away temporarily but ultimately will make going to the
doctor less painful for everyone; most doctors say the law only
deepened the crisis.
   ``The state has never maintained good control of its health care
costs,'' said Dr. Richard Capito of Thomas Memorial Hospital in
South Charleston and a member of the Legislative Task Force on
Uncompensated Health Care.
   ``When corporate America was forming HMOs and PPOs and holding
down costs, West Virginia was an open book _ you charge us and
we'll pay it,'' said Capito, a native of Weirton who graduated from
West Virginia University Medical School.
   Health Maintenance Organizations and Preferred Provider
Organizations are groups aimed at reducing health care costs
through an agreement with a captive group of doctors or hospitals,
guaranteeing income in return for discounts.
   Doctors and lawmakers also blame federal programs in the 1960s
that brought care to isolated areas where people were too poor to
pay for it. One-third more doctors practice here than in the
mid-1970s, and the infant death rate has been halved since 1960,
according to the Department of Health and Human Services.
   But many doctors say they aren't paid enough, and most say they
sometimes aren't paid at all. A West Virginia State Medical
Association report said that doctors write off $142 million in
health care each year.
   High malpractice rates also scare away young doctors, said
Capito, who belongs to a group of emergency care doctors that
contracts services to Thomas Memorial. Each doctor pays $20,000 in
annual malpractice premiums; one who left and moved to South
Carolina now pays $2,000 a year for similar coverage because that
state has set up a joint underwriting association for doctors.
   The Omnibus Health Care Act, which went into effect in July,
averted a $100 million financial crisis by controlling how much the
state spends on care.
   But many doctor say the main features _ fee caps and requiring
doctors and hospitals who see state-insured patients to see 15
percent covered by Medicaid _ will only make things worse.
Lawmakers argue that the state had act to head off a fiscal crisis
that would have jeopardized the entire budget.
   ``It's a piece of the answer, a step in the right direction,''
said Del. Pat White, the administrator of a clinic and a leader of
two legislative health care committees, who has been meeting with
doctors to discuss possible changes in the bill in the coming
session.
   ``In the past there wasn't that dialogue,'' said George Rider,
the West Virginia Medical Association's executive director.
   Advocates for the poor occupy a middle ground between doctors
and legislators, so they haven't been key players in making health
care policy, said Charles Tindley, coordinator of the Mountain
State Health Care Campaign.
   ``To me it's a real attitude of selfishness,'' said Tindley.
``The doctors have become so hostile that they think anyone on the
so-called other side is their enemy. The enemy is poor health
care.''
   Rider applauded the governor for appointing the association's
chief to a task force studying how medical schools can help keep
doctors in the state.
   Not all Rider's 2,300 members are so optimistic. Task force
recommendations aren't due until August, long after the end of the
legislative session. And even then, doctors don't pull much weight
in the Legislature, Rider said.
   ``In dealing with the Legislature in the last three or four
years, there's been little open-mindedness to listen to the medical
community,'' Capito said. ``The health care act affects one-quarter
of the state's population, but there was not a single practicing
physician consulted.''
   The consensus among doctors is that lasting solutions won't come
easy.
   ``The Omnibus Act is a problem, but as an isolated problem it
wouldn't be such a big deal,'' said Awadallah, who now practices in
Cincinnati. ``It's gratifying to practice where people really need
you, but for physicians it's a long-term economic picture.''
   Universal health care would save the state money and help with
the problem of uncompensated health care, analysts say. But doctors
say such a plan would likely drive them away by imposing caps on
the price of procedures.
   Insurance reform will mean making lawmakers face up to one of
the state's most powerful industries. Doctors also face the
possibility of changing the way they practice _ doing fewer tests,
for example, _ to lower fees.
   ``A realistic solution is politically unpopular,'' Branson said.
``It involves a lot of sacred cows.''

   Severin Schurger spends weeks perfecting a violin,
days just carving and eyeing the scroll of his creation to ensure
its curves are even.
   ``Something I would like to achieve would be to make a nice
scroll quickly,'' says Schurger, who studied playing and making
violins in Japan, where his mentors could carve two perfectly
shaped spruce scrolls a day.
   So carefully does he work that he carves just two or three
violins a year out of spruce and maple, making about 25 violins,
six violas and three cellos in 18 years. The instruments sell for
about $6,000 each.
   ``I just sort of stopped practicing and I wanted to devote my
life to repairing and making violins so other people can play. I
had a passion for it. It's something I really enjoy.''
   In addition to that passion, Schurger brought to the craft his
experience as a cabinetmaker on sailboats. ``There's a big
similarity between a sailboat and a violin,'' he says, likening a
violin's bridge to a sailboat's mast, its scroll to the sailboat's
decorative stem.
   Watching a violin take form is enjoyable, he says, but ``when I
put the varnish on, that's when it comes alive. That's a real big
turn-on.''
   For fun, Schurger spends his free time with voice lessons and
singing in a Miami opera company. But violins are his first love,
and he equates each of his finished instruments to a child that's
ready to leave home.
   ``I don't really get attached to one _ you can't. ... This thing
you are making is going out on the world stage. It's like a part of
yourself.''

<HEAD>Fewer Deals Getting Done at '80s' End</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a binge of corporate buyouts and takeovers
for much of the 1980s, Wall Street investors have gone on a spartan
diet in recent months.
   Along with shrinking profits and payrolls at many securities
firms, the results have produced a slower pace of turnover in the
ranks of companies holding a dominant position in the stock market.
   To reach that conclusion, Thomas Doerflinger, an analyst at
PaineWebber Inc., examined changes in the roster of names that make
up Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock composite index _ the yardstick most
commonly used by professionals to measure market trends.
   In 1988, Doerflinger found, deals were announced for 26 of the
S&amp;P 500, with an aggregate market value of $44.7 billion before the
bids were made.
   Over the first 11 months of this year, by contrast, only 14,
with a total value of $26.9 billion, attracted offers to buy.
   The most commonly cited cause of the slowdown has been a
prolonged slump in the market for high-yielding ``junk'' bonds,
which rose to prominence in the mid-1980s as a primary means of
financing takeovers and buyouts.
   Lenders shied away from further deals that might go the way of
Campeau Corp.'s troubled retailing empire or the
employee-management group that would-but-couldn't buy UAL Corp.
   Though that did indeed play a prominent part, Doerflinger
observes, it wasn't the only wilting influence on the takeover boom.
   ``In 1988,'' he noted, ``U.S. companies were on the
international bargain counter.
   ``In the wake of the 1987 market crash, stock prices were
depressed, even though corporate cash flow was very strong. U.S.
equities looked even cheaper to foreigners, because the U.S. dollar
was depressed.
   ``This process reversed in 1989, as stock prices rose, cash
flows weakened, the dollar appreciated, and turmoil in the junk
bond market slowed deal acitivity.''
   Although it has tapered off, the takeover wave promises to have
some lasting effects in the 1990s.
   For one thing, Doerflinger points out, it has significantly
altered the personality of the S&amp;P 500, which is used as a sort of
role model by many managers at investing institutions.
   Pension assets of millions of Americans these days are invested
in funds set up to duplicate the ups and downs of the 500
(``index'' funds) or in porftolios that play off the 500 with
computer models in the hopes of beating its performance.
   From January 1984 through November 1988, Doerflinger says, 121
stocks were displaced from the index _ and so were 16 of the names
that replaced them.
   ``It is very important to remember that S&amp;P does not attempt to
replace a deleted company with another company in the same
industry,'' he said.
   ``As a result, the structure of the S&amp;P 500 has changed over
time, as large companies in mature industries have been replaced by
fast-growing mid-sized companies, which tend to be in the consumer,
financial, technology and service sectors.''
   Instead of old-line industrial America, Doerflinger says, ``the
index looks more and more like a highly diversified growth stock
portfolio.''
   It remains to be seen whether that might help or hurt the
results turned in by the S&amp;P 500 in the 1990s.
   But it is already evident that the takeovers and buyouts of the
'80s forced a ``modernization'' of the 500, even as it did many
areas of the corporate world the index represents.

   The wind blew and the earth shook. And the wall came down.
   There it is: 1989 in review. A year of disasters that rivaled
Old Testament plagues, of triumphs that challenged credulity _ a
year that led people, again and again, to the same words: ``I never
thought I'd see the day.''
   For a while, it seemed that this would be the Year of the Oil
Spill. Then the Year of the Hurricane. Then the Year of the
Earthquake.
   But the last turbulent year of the decade will be remembered,
finally, as the year the Iron Curtain lifted.
   Twenty-six years earlier, John F. Kennedy had stood before the
Berlin Wall and said of free citizens everywhere: ``Let them come
to Berlin.'' In 1989, they came _ and from the least imaginable
direction. They came from the East.
   ``What joy!'' a West Berliner exclaimed; and people from East
and West Berlin danced and laughed and hugged atop a wall that no
longer divided them.
   ``We live in exciting times,'' President Bush observed. ``The
rapidity of change is mind-boggling.''
   Indeed it was.
   In Poland, the Solidarity trade union was illegal at the
beginning of the year; it had ousted the Communist government by
the end. Then came Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia: One by
one, Eastern Europe's ruling Communist parties followed Poland's
lead and agreed to step aside and allow democratic, multi-party
elections.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had loosed the shackles
that once bound Eastern Europe. And after a seasick summit with
Bush in the tempestuous Mediterranean, he declared that the Cold
War was over.
   Even Romania, among the most stalwart of the old-line Communist
states, was overwhelmed by democratic fervor that ultimately drove
President Nicolae Ceausescu from his palace.
   Images of Eastern Europe's peaceful revolution will stick in the
memory for a long time, but so will a sadder picture: a lone man
standing before a phalanx of tanks near Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   It had been a hopeful spring in the square, where tens of
thousands of students demonstrated daily to demand democratic
change. Military officers at first balked at suppressing the
protesters _ 100 officers signed a statement saying the army ``will
never shoot the people.'' But, on June 3, the army began shooting
the people.
   The death toll may never be known. Estimates ranged from 300 to
3,000.
   Brute force blocked democracy in China, but U.S. troops
forcefully imposed it in Panama, where an invasion just before
Christmas ousted the dictatorship of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
and installed an elected president.
   On a smaller scale, too, it was a year of tumultuous transition.
   The TV lights went out for televangelist Jim Bakker, who got a
45-year prison term for conspiracy and fraud.
   Zsa Zsa Gabor finally starred in a film that everyone remembers
_ her trial on cop-slapping charges. She played Beverly Hills'
official court jester, and was rewarded with a conviction and jail
term.
   Leona Helmsley was the queen of a hotel empire, but she was
mocked and reviled outside her kingdom and was sentenced to four
years in prison for tax evasion.
   Pete Rose became as closely linked with betting as batting, and
agreed to a lifetime suspension from the game to which he'd devoted
his life.
   John Tower, President Bush's choice as secretary of defense,
lost the nomination and a sizable chunk of his reputation when he
was pilloried as a liquor-tippling ``party animal.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright resigned in a furor over outside
income; Tom Foley took his place.
   Time merged with Warner. Sony merged with Columbia. Mike Tyson
split with Robin Givens.
   The year's obituaries noted the passing of both famous and
infamous:
   Irving Berlin and Bette Davis, Lucille Ball, Robert Penn Warren,
Salvador Dali, Vladimir Horowitz, Herbert von Karajan, Laurence
Olivier, Mel Blanc.
   Ferdinand Marcos, Ayatollah Khomeini, Emperor Hirohito. Abbie
Hoffman. Rep. Claude Pepper.
   Sugar Ray Robinson, A. Bartlett Giamatti. Secretariat.
   Mass murderer Ted Bundy was put to death; other killers died at
their own hands. They included Patrick Purdy, who killed five
schoolchildren in Stockton, Calif.; Joseph Wesbecker, who killed
eight people in a printing plant in Louisville, Ky.; and Marc
Lepine, who systematically gunned down 14 women engineering
students in Montreal.
   Ramon Salcido allegedly killed his wife, two daughters, and four
other people near Santa Rosa, Calif., before fleeing to Mexico. He
was captured five days later and awaits trial in California.
   More than 20,000 Americans died of AIDS. Scientists continued
searching for a vaccine and a cure, and the government tried to
find new ways to make experimental drugs available more quickly.
   People worried about homelessness and hunger, abortion and child
care, flag-burning and the ``greenhouse effect.''
   The most-honored movie of the year _ ``Rain Man'' _ suggested
that the ``Me Decade'' ethic might be softening. It was the story
of a fast-talking wheeler-dealer from Southern California who found
some measure of humanity in caring for his autistic brother.
   Then again, the Grammy Award for best song went to Bobby
McFerrin's ``Don't Worry, Be Happy.''
   Historically speaking, the year began on a chilly, cloudy day in
January when George Bush took the oath of office as the 41st
president of the United States.
   ``A new breeze is blowing,'' he declared in his inaugural
address, ``and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push
on: There is new ground to be broken, and new action to be taken.''
   If presidencies are defined by symbols and styles, Bush set out
to cast his as open, informal, active _ sort of an aerobic Teddy
Roosevelt. He opened the White House to the public the day after
his inauguration; he met with the press far more frequently than
did President Reagan; and he seemed at times to be cultivating an
image as the Triathlete President _ jogging, golfing, fishing,
speedboating, playing tennis, tossing horseshoes, tussling with
grandchildren.

<HEAD>Late Payments On Bank Loans At Decade High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of consumers 30 days or more behind
in their payments on bank loans rose sharply during the
July-September period to the highest level of the decade, a banking
group reported.
   According to a survey by the American Bankers Association, 2.88
percent of closed-end installment loans were delinquent in
September, compared with 2.30 percent in June and 2.42 percent in
September 1988. The steep rise followed two quarter-to-quarter
declines.
   Virginia Stafford, a spokeswoman for the bankers' group, said
Thursday that the next-highest end-of-quarter total was 2.74
percent, reached in the second quarter of 1980 when the country was
in recession.
   Robert Dugger, the association's chief economist, said an
increase was expected because of the slowing economy. However, he
called the current rate ``still in the manageable range.''
   Also, banks are making fewer new consumer loans. That means as
borrowers pay off old loans, the proportion in delinquency rises.
   The delinquency rate is based on a nationwide survey of 800
banks. It includes seven different types of closed-end consumer
loans: personal, two types of auto loans, mobile home, recreational
vehicle, property improvement and home equity.

   The cold snap gripping much of the nation has
drained heating oil supplies, causing temporary shortages in some
areas and driving the price of the fuel sharply higher, industry
officials said.
   Oil companies said Thursday they're taking steps to ensure there
is enough heating oil for all their customers. But the increased
demand has sent the price consumers pay for oil as high as $1 a
gallon.
   Exxon USA, Mobil Corp. and Star Enterprise, a Texaco Inc.
affiliate, reported that some of their Northeastern terminals
suffered temporary oil depletions and that customers have been sent
to other facilities or forced to wait for new supplies to arrive.
   ``These outages ... have been maybe for a few hours,'' said
Exxon spokesman Jim Davis, who said customers at the company's
Everett, Mass., terminal were directed to nearby Waltham, where
supplies were more plentiful.
   At Mobil, spokesman John Lord estimated that some customers in
the Northeast were kept waiting an hour for heating oil to arrive
by barge or pipeline, but ``that is not the norm. The norm is no
outages.''
   The wait was longer at Star Enterprise's East Hartford, Conn.,
terminal, which ran out of oil Thursday and was hoping for a
delivery today or Saturday, said Texaco spokesman Top Ingram.
   The companies placed the blame for the shortages squarely on the
weather, as customers burned more oil or tried to stock up on extra
fuel. Bad weather has also made it hard for oil barges to unload
their cargoes in some East Coast harbors.
   A series of arctic air blasts has chilled the eastern half of
the United States for 10 days, and cold weather in Europe has
placed a further strain on inventories.
   Because of the increased demand, Amoco Corp. is producing about
1 million barrels of oil a month above its usual 8 million, said
spokesman Richard Judy. Amoco has not reported any shortages at its
terminals.
   Exxon is limiting its customers to the amounts of oil specified
in their purchase contracts, Davis said, adding, ``We believe that
our heating oil inventories should be adequate to meet our monthly
contract volume.''
   At Star Enterprise, where heating oil sales are running 50
percent above projections for December, the company also is
``trying to figure out a way to distribute it on an equitable
basis,'' Ingram said.
   Oil prices have climbed steadily as temperatures have dropped.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, a gallon of home heating oil
for delivery in January cost 79.81 cents Thursday, compared with
62.71 cents on Nov. 30.
   Heating oil prices normally rise and fall by fractions of a
cent, but Thursday's price was up more than 4 cents a gallon from
Wednesday, a further reflection of the increased demand.
   Mobil's Lord said prices the oil company has paid on the open
market have shot up 25 cents over the last three weeks and
distributors in New Jersey reported a similar increase.
   Homeowners and businesses are already paying higher prices.
Platt's Oilgram News, an oil industry newsletter, said some
consumers are paying $1 a gallon in the New York City area, where
heating costs are the highest in the nation, and about 10 cents
less in the Midwest.
   The National Weather Service was predicting some relief might
arrive by Christmas. The oil companies said that as long as the
cold abates, they should have enough supplies.
   But officials were still a little uneasy.
   ``It's keeping your fingers crossed that you don't run out,''
said Texaco's Ingram.

<HEAD>Gift Certificate Fraud Popular During Holiday Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HELEN J. SIMON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talented con artists won't be stopping at
forged checks and stolen credit cards this holiday season,
retailers and security experts say. Gift certificates have become a
hot new tool of the trade.
   ``The economic criminals are getting away from buying hard
merchandise and they're buying gift certificates,'' said Jack
Scott, director of loss prevention for JBS Associates of Ringwood,
one of the country's largest check guarantee companies.
   ``They realize it's a weakness in the merchants' system,'' he
said.
   The thieves use stolen credit cards or bogus checks to buy the
certificates because they are more difficult to trace, more
flexible and can be resold.
   ``Once they get the gift certificate it's like money in their
pocket,'' said Ray Watson, a loss prevention detective for Sears,
Roebuck and Co. Inc.
   Some certificates are redeemed for merchandise, which also can
later be resold. Thieves may also buy an item with the certificate
and later take it back, asking for a cash refund.
   Scott, whose company guarantees the credit-worthiness of checks
for merchants, estimates the going rate for gift certificates on
the street is 70 to 75 cents on the dollar compared to 35 cents on
the dollar for merchandise.
   In one case, Scott said, a con artist was able to pass more than
$50,000 in counterfeit gift certificates in less than two weeks
before he was caught.
   Gift certificates are easy targets because few merchants keep
track of them by serializing them or recording numbers of documents
that have been redeemed, he said. Gift certificate purchases are
often rung up as cash, making it difficult to later trace them.
   In addition, they often are printed on regular paper instead of
on paper with watermarks or other means of preventing reproduction
by increasingly sophisticated laser copiers, he said.
   Lewis Shealy, vice president of loss prevention for the
Chicago-based Marshall Fields department stores, said his company's
25 stores had gift-certificate losses of about $10,000 last year
even though they serialized their certificates.
   ``They were using photocopy machines to counterfeit them and
they looked very, very good,'' he said. ``During a busy Christmas
season your chances of passing them are 100 percent.''
   This year, the store hired a company that designs federal bank
notes to create a system under which the word ``void'' appears on
photocopies of gift certificates, he said.
   Officials from federal and state agencies and the National
Retail Merchants Association said they had no figures on gift
certificate fraud.
   ``That's not an area we've been called into at all,'' said
association spokesman John Gary.
   Richard Adams, a spokesman for the U.S. Secret Service in
Washington, D.C., said the agency does not keep statistics to
distinguish certificate fraud from other fraud like credit card
misuse.
   Scott estimated the use of stolen checks or credit cards to buy
gift certificates is up by about 20 percent this year.
   Scott said the extent of the problem was brought home to him
this summer through interviews with the arrested heads of a
national ring estimated to have cashed more than $35 million worth
of stolen checks in the last three years.
   ``They predicted there is going to be a major loss to retailers
this holiday season because of the popularity of gift certificate
fraud among economic criminals,'' Scott said.
   Not all stores are victims of gift certificate fraud.
   ``I don't have any known fraud in my gift certificate areas,''
said Ed Barclay, director of loss prevention for Saks Fifth
Avenue's 46 stores, which serialize their certificates.

<HEAD>Lifting U.S. Sanctions Should Benefit Panama's Sickly Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. government attorneys are hard at work on a plan to free
about $375 million in Panamanian assets held in the United States,
a move that is sure to be a big boost for Panama's ailing economy.
   A spokesman for the Treasury Department said Thursday he did not
know when a plan would be completed that would unblock Panamanian
bank accounts and allow the Latin American country to collect back
taxes from the U.S. corporations that operate there.
   President Bush called for the ``orderly unblocking of Panamanian
government assets'' held in the United States after the swearing-in
of the democratically elected Guillermo Endara as president earlier
this week.
   The sanctions were imposed by the Reagan administration to
pressure Gen. Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian dictator who has been
indicted in the United States on drug trafficking charges.
   The United States cut off all military and economic aid in July
1987. Further sanctions sharply restricted U.S. companies that do
business in Panama, froze Panamanian assets held in the United
States, held payments relating to operating the Panama Canal in
escrow and forbade American companies from paying taxes and fees to
the Noriega regime.
   Companies were allowed either to put money due the Panamanian
government into escrow accounts overseen by the Federal Reserve
Bank or establish reserve accounts on their own books.
   The Treasury spokesman said the government must develop a plan
that ensures ``the assets go to the legitimate goverment'' and that
U.S. residents and corporations that made escrow payments to cover
fees and taxes owed to Panama be given proper credit.
   An official of a large U.S. company operating in Panama,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ``There has been no
signal at this point from the administration as to those taxes
going to this particular government.''
   Economists have estimated that the sanctions cost Panama about
$225 million last year, when the nation's gross domestic product
fell 17 percent.
   For Panama, gaining access to $375 million will mark the first
step in getting its economy in order.
   ``It's not big money to us, but it's certainly big money to
them,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc.
   As relations warm, U.S. banks will be more inclined to lend to
Panama, where loan availability has been off sharply.
   ``Noriega's access to the U.S. banking system ... was being
impeded to the greatest extent that we could, and it's very hard to
run a modern economy that way,'' Brusca said.
   Panama owes the rest of the world about $5.3 billion. Though the
figure pales in comparison to other developing countries, it is
extremely high on a per-capita basis. Panama's debt equals about
$2,200 per capita while Brazil's debt is roughly $790 per capita,
according to figures provided by the World Bank.
   Panama first missed a payment to banks in mid-1987 and since has
faced increasing difficulties servicing its debt, said Luis R.
Luis, director of the Latin America department of the Institute for
International Finance.
   Luis said the money due Panama from the lifting of U.S.
sanctions ``could be used to pay back the arrears. It would be a
very good use of funds as far as banks are concerned.''
   Experts said the lifting of sanctions would certainly improve
Panamanian citizens' view of America.
   ``This can really help to pull more of the people onto the U.S.
side. If we can kick out the rat (Noriega) and lift sanctions, it
would improve the economic lot of a lot people,'' Brusca said.
   In addition to lifting sanctions, the U.S. government said it
would not proceed with an order, which would have gone into effect
at the end of January, barring ships bearing Panama's flag from
U.S. ports.
   It was unclear whether a ban on the import of Panamanian sugar
would be lifted, but experts said the amount is insignificant and
that sugar is a minor factor in Panama's economy.

<HEAD>SEC Proposes Stiffer Disclosure Rules for Mutual Funds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is
seeking public comment on proposed new rules that would require
mutual funds to simplify and expand the information they are
required to supply investors.
   The SEC agreed to submit the proposals to public scrutiny on
Thursday.
   One proposals seeks to clarify descriptions of funds to
investors, a second would provide better measures of fund
performance and a third would require disclosure of who is making
fund investment decisions.
   At least one of the proposals, requiring funds to identify those
managing their stock portfolios, is expected to meet with the
stiffest industry opposition, SEC staffers acknowledged.
   ``I would say the majority of the industry people that we've
heard from think it's a bad idea,'' said Kathryn McGrath of the SEC.
   Ms. McGrath, head of the SEC's Division of Investment
Management, conceded that previous attempts to implement a fund
manager disclosure rule were ``blown out of the water by a wave of
criticism.''
   The Investment Company Institute, a mutal fund industry group,
opposes portfolio manager disclosure, claiming it would be an
additional burden for the funds and create a ``superstar'' system
of fund managers.
   ``We did not agree with the fund manager disclosure, which
places undue emphasis on the cult of personality. It ignores the
actual basis on which funds hire advisers,'' said Betty K. Hart, a
spokeswoman for the trade group.
   ``In 1972, 1982 and 1984 this issue has come up and we have
always opposed it. We still oppose it. There are some very
succesful funds that run by committee,'' she added.
   Ms. Hart said the ICI was willing to go along with the
disclosure rule in just two instances: ``where a fund promotes an
individual to the press and the investment public, or if the
individual is of such critical importance to the advisory
organization that it would cease to exist in the same manner if
they left.''
   The two other proposals are less controversial. To simply
information in a mutual fund's prospectus, the SEC staff suggested
shortening tables listing a fund's total return per share.
   To provide investors with more information to easily evaluate a
fund, the staff proposed following one of two alternatives: A
fund's managers would be required either to discuss and analyze its
fiscal year performance in relation to its investment objectives or
compare its total returns over one-, five- and 10-year periods to
the performance of a securities index.
   The commission, which regulates investment companies as well as
the securities industry, voted to submit the proposed rules for a
60-day public comment period.
   Following that period, Ms. McGrath said her staff will review
comments _ both pro and con _ make any changes deemed necessary and
submit the proposed rule changes to the commissioners ``and they
will vote it up or down.''
   She said the staff hoped to submit the proposals to the
commission by late spring or early summer.

   The Federal Aviation Administration has
awarded a contract potentially worth $853 million to a unit of
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. for up to 40,000 computer
workstations at Transportation Department offices around the
country, officials said.
   AT&amp;T Computer Systems announced Thursday it had won the
``networked computing contract,'' which will provide computer
hardware, software, training and maintenance for FAA and other
government transportation offices.
   Initial value of the three-year contract is $18.8 million, but
both government and company officials said it could reach $853
million with five one-year options to install a network of
computers in all department regional, branch and local offices.
   The department now uses ``a hodgepodge'' of 56 brands of
microcomputers, several incompatable software programs and a
variety of local area computer networks, said FAA spokesman John
Leyden. He said the new contract covers desk, laptop and other
computers in a network for administrative offices and is not part
of plans to upgrade FAA air traffic control operations.
   Leyden said it was the biggest contract FAA has awarded. He said
about $534 million worth of equipment and work would be for FAA
offices and the rest for other Transportation offices.
   The system to be installed is called OATS, for Office Automation
Technology and Service.
   ``We believe this is one of the largest desktop office
automation contracts ever awarded, '' said Gordon J. Bridge,

<HEAD>Last-Minute Buyers Boost Business But Retailers Still Under Pressure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Bargain-hunting Christmas shoppers have had a field day this
year, with sale signs competing with holiday decorations for
attention at many of the nation's department stores as troubled
retailers scrap to pay their debts.
   But some industry analysts say the lower prices may have hurt
the traditional last-minute buying spree.
   ``I think that we're seeing a moderate increase in retail
momentum in the last week,'' Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc. analyst
Walter Loeb said Thursday. Sales of coats, sweaters and other warm
clothing have been better than expected because of bitterly cold
weather around the country, he said.
   However, Loeb said, ``some of the excitement of the last-minute
shopping was undermined.''
   As the days tick down toward Christmas, retailers are counting
on down-to-the-wire buyers to boost business and bolster profits at
this crucial time of year.
   Several store executives said Thursday said they noticed a
pickup in sales heading into a final weekend that could decide if
this is a ho-hum or ho-ho-ho holiday season.
   Bargain hunters have been enjoying a jolly time since
Thanksgiving, finding plenty of prices marked down _ particularly
at department stores owned by cash-starved Campeau Corp. and their
competitors.
   In the dog-eat-dog New York market, Campeau-owned Bloomingdale's
as well as rivals Macy's and Lord &amp; Taylor have been advertising
price cuts of 20 percent or more on dresses, sweaters and other
apparel. Bloomingdale's, which is being sold by Campeau, is under
extra pressure to pump up sales so that it will fetch the best
possible bid.
   The price competition isn't as fierce in all metropolitan areas
as it is in New York but analysts say that this year generally has
been more promotional than normal.
   Retailers offering enhanced services, such as personal shoppers
and pre-wrapped presents, say the effort is paying off. Many
retailers are pleased with their results so far.
   John Buller, senior vice president of marketing at The Bon
Marche, said the Seattle-based department store chain, owned by
Campeau, is having one of its best years ever.
   Sales at The Bon Marche's 43 stores mostly in the Pacific
Northwest have been running in the ``high single digits'' above
last year, spurred by numerous merchandising ideas, Buller said.
Every floor of each store has displays of gifts wrapped and ready
to be put under Christmas trees.
   Luxury gifts and accommodating service have pulled in customers.
Kenneth Watson, chairman and chief executive officer of Gump's,
said that in addition to providing personal shoppers _ staff who
act as elves for customers _ Gump's is offering free delivery in
the San Francisco Bay area and direct telephone lines to make it
easier for shoppers to place orders.
   Watson said holiday business at the upscale specialty chain is
about 12 percent ahead of year ago. ``I would say in our case it's
much better than expected or anticipated,'' he said.
   Crystal, watches, pens, travelers' clocks and leather bags have
been fast sellers at the tony Cartier jewelry stores, said Thierry
Chaunu, vice president of marketing.
   In addition to discounted apparel and accessories, moderately
priced home furnishings appear to be selling well, store executives
and analysts said.
   Clark A. Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer of Pier I
Imports Inc., a specialty furnishings chain of 511 stores, said
Christmas sales are running about 20 percent above 1988. The
strongest regions have been Florida, northern California and the
Pacific Northwest, while Texas and the Boston area have been the
weakest.
   Spending on consumer electronics seems to have held up despite
overall sluggish sales of expensive durable merchandise, such as
home appliances.
   The 90-plus franchisees of Software City have reported ``pretty
brisk'' business since Thanksgiving, president Shep Altshuler said.
   Maria Cirino, marketing vice president for the New Jersey-based
discounter, said sophisticated computer systems previously
associated with businesses are being bought for home use.
   Programs that help people organize budgets or tax information
and educate children are hot sellers, she said. Broder Bund's
software including ``Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego'' or
``Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego,'' intended to teach geography
and history, are two sought-after programs.
   Many retailers were reluctant to assess their performance
knowing that the next few days could be crucial. A late rally last
year salvaged the holiday season, which typically accounts for half
or more of a retailer's annual profits.
   ``The question is: `What happened this week?''' said Rosalind
Wells, chief economist of the National Retail Merchants Association.
   Even if it meets retailers' most optimistic dreams, there will
be stores stuck with slow-moving merchandise that will have to
slash prices to unload seasonal goods.
   Said Loeb of Morgan Stanley: ``There will be heavy clearance
markdowns. You've got to get rid of seasonal merchandise.''

<HEAD>Government Picks 13 Coal Technology Projects in 10 States</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department says it plans to award
$540 million to 13 companies to help finance ``showcase'' ventures
in 10 states to develop ways of burning U.S. coal with fewer
emissions of harmful gases.
   The proposed awards are part of the department's ``clean coal
technology'' program, a $5 billion, five-year effort to make
coal-burning power plants less polluting and more efficient.
   ``The technologies to be field tested by these flagship projects
represent environmentally superior weays to use U.S. coal,'' Energy
Secretary James D. Watkins said Thursday in announcing the
selections. ``They are this country's best hope for using its most
abundant energy resource, coal, while preserving ... our
environment.''
   The actual awards of federal money for the ventures is subject
to the completion of cooperative agreements with the companies
involved in the projects. Watkins said the negotiations would be
completed by December 1990.
   The 13 projects were selected from among 48 submitted last
August. Twenty-seven other projects already had been selected from
two previous rounds of competition in 1986 and 1988, and two more
rounds are planned for next year and 1991.
   The proposed awards of $540 million in federal money for the 13
projects would be in addition to $777 million to be contributed by
the companies and state governments. Watkins said some of the
private financing would come from foreign companies.
   The largest project, costing $403.6 million and proposed by CRSS
Capital Inc. of Houston and TECO Power Services Corp. of Tampa,
Fla., would use a new technology to convert coal to gas for use in
generating electricity for the city of Tallahassee, Fla.
   Others are headed by AirPol Inc., of Teterboro, N.J., costing
$4.9 million and sited at West Paducah, Ky.; Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co.
of Alliance, Ohio, costing $9.8 million, at Aberdeen, Ohio; Bechtel
Corp. of San Francisco, costing $8.5 million, at Seward, Pa.;
Energy and Environmental Research Corp. of Irvine, Calif., $14.5
million, at Denver, Colo.; and LIFAC North America of Oakland,
Calif., $18.7 million, at Richmond, Ind.
   Also, MK-Ferguson Co., of Cleveland, costing $66.2 million, at
Niles, Ohio; Public Service Co. of Colorado, of Denver, $24.6
million, at Denver, and Alaska Industrial Development and Export
Authority of Anchorage, $191.7 million, at Healy, Alaska; Dairyland
Power Cooperative of La Crosse, Wis., $183.9 million, at Alma,
Wis.; Bethlehem Steel Corp., of Bethlehem, Pa., $104.3 million, at
Burns Harbor, Ind.; and ENCOAL Corp. of Houston, $72.6 million, at
Gillette, Wyo.
   Air Products &amp; Chemicals of Allentown, Pa., and Dakota
Gasification Co. of Beulah, N.D., are jointly heading a project
valued at $213.7 million and sited at Beulah.

<HEAD>Half of GM's Linden Plant Shutting Down Indefinitely in February</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. is eliminating one of two
shifts at a New Jersey car assembly plant, adding to the production
woes of the nation's auto industry.
   On Thursday, GM spokesman Phil Workman in Lansing said the
second shift at the automaker's Linden plant would stop production
Feb. 26 and about 1,600 workers would be laid off indefinitely. The
first shift will continue producing Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta
automobiles.
   Also on Thursday, GM and Chrysler Corp. added to their lists of
factories temporarily suspending production in January. That brings
to 42 of the Big Three's 53 U.S. assembly plants which will be down
for at least one week each next month.
   More than 127,000 workers will be affected.
   In addition to state unemployment benefits, laid-off workers can
draw on special funds that can boost their pay during factory
shutdowns to as much as 95 percent of their straight-time wages.
   The effect of the shutdowns on the country's auto industry
supply community is difficult to measure, and it's likely that
thousands of other workers could face temporary layoffs next month.
   All the assembly plant closings are caused by slumping sales and
high new-vehicle inventories.
   Demand for Corsica and Beretta cars, which are also produced in
Wilmington, Del., has been slipping. Sales this year through Dec.
10 were 12.7 percent behind last year's pace. GM's domestic car
sales, meantime, were off 8.3 percent for the same time.
   Combined inventory of the two cars _ essentially the same except
Beretta has two doors and Corsica has four _ stood at 123 days at
the end of November, based on the current selling pace according to
Ward's Automotive Reports, a weekly industry newsletter.
   Inventory for the eight major U.S. automakers stood at 88 days,
Ward's said.
   News of the Linden shutdown hit workers hard.
   ``It's no Merry Christmas when a person has been trying to dig
in with the company, working twice as hard, working with the
management, trying to sell the cars ourselves, putting our heart
into it,'' said United Auto Workers union Local 595 President
Charlie Marshall.
   ``To hear there's only one shift is a big letdown for
everybody,'' he added. ``We all feel like we've been had.''

   Traders took heart from the market's upward move, which was
achieved despite a weak showing earlier in Tokyo.
   At about noon in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange

<HEAD>Excel, Union Reach Agreement on Meatpacking Injuries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Excel Corp. and the union that represents
many of the company's workers have reached an agreement aimed at
reducing injury rates at Excel's meatpacking plants.
   Both parties said the agreement is unique because Excel, based
in Wichita, acted voluntarily.
   ``Obviously we hope that the rest of the industry will respond
as responsibly as Excel has,'' said Al Zack, spokesman for the
United Food and Commercial Workers in Washington. ``We've gone
through a lot of battles with other companies just to prove that
problems existed.''
   Battles with other packers, notably IBP and John Morrell &amp; Co.,
have resulted in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
levying more than $10 million in fines. The union's complaints have
centered on injuries caused by repetitive-motion stress.
   Zack said provisions of the agreement were similar to those
ordered by OSHA in the IBP and Morrell cases.
   The agreement will first be implemented at Excel's Plainview,
Texas, plant and later expanded to beef-processing plants in Dodge
City; Friona, Texas; Nebraska City, Neb.; Schuyler, Neb.; Sterling,
Colo.; Marysville, Calif.; a beef-distribution center in
Philadelphia; and pork-processing operations in Beardstown, Ill.,
and Ottumwa, Iowa. The union represents about 8,600 workers at
those plants.
   Zack said the union had brought safety issues to Excel's
attention at the Plainview and Ottumwa plants. The company
responded with a proposal, rather than denying that injury problems
existed, he said.
   Under the terms of the agreement, Excel will hire an ergonomic
consultant and other medical personnel, and union members will be
trained as monitors to survey work areas, spot symptoms of
repetitive-motion stress and recommend solutions. The program will
involve testing of production flows and equipment, experimental
work stations, worker training on the causes and prevention of
injuries and revised procedures to treat and rehabilitate injured
workers.

   Liu, 39, succeeds Kane, a 15-year veteran of the company who was
leaving Knight-Ridder to pursue other interests, according to a
company statement released Thursday. Liu's new position is
effective Feb. 2, 1990.
   Liu, who has been chief financial officer of the chain's San

   Liu is a certified public accountant who joined Knight-Ridder in
1978 as a financial officer at the Boca Raton (Fla.) News. He
transferred to San Jose in 1983.
   Liu was born in Taiwan and came to the United States in 1976. A
graduate of national Chen-Chi University of Taiwan, he also has an
MBA degree from Florida Atlantic University and is working towards
a doctorate in business administration at Nova University in Fort
Lauderdale, the statement said.

<HEAD>Whitbread Sells Liquor Businesses to Allied-Lyons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whitbread &amp; Co. PLC, a British brewer, said Friday
it is selling its liquor division to Allied-Lyons PLC, a major
British liquor company, for the equivalent of $877 million.
   The deal follows Whitbread's announcement in October that it had
decided to concentrate on brewing and leisure retailing activities,
particularly pubs, restaurant chains and hotels.
   Whitbread's liquor division is made up of two main companies,
James Burrough Distillers, which produces brands such as Beefeater
Gin and Long John Scotch whisky, and the Buckingham Wine Co., which
imports and distributes wines and liquors in the United States.
   Whitbread's 85 percent holding in the Atlas Peak Vineyards in
California, as well as Julius Wile Napa Californian wines are
included in the deal.
   Pre-tax profit of the businesses being sold was $38 million in
the year ended Feb. 2. The company didn't break out after-tax
profit and revenue.
   Allied-Lyons' acquisition follows its $325 million takeover of
Dunkin' Donuts, a U.S.-based doughnut and coffee franchise
restaurant chain. It obtained control of Dunkin' Donuts on Thursday.
   ``The sale (of the liquor division) will help us strengthen
Whitbread's balance sheet and provides us with the resources to
develop our beer brands,'' said Peter Jarvis, Whitbread's group
managing director.
   He added: ``These (liquor) businesses are better able to achieve
their full potential as part of a significantly larger
international drinks group.''
   Allied-Lyons said, ``The acquisition will enhance our already
strong position in the world wines and spirits market.''
   The deal will provide it with valuable brand names, additional
production facilities and valuable stocks, Allied-Lyons said.
   Allied-Lyons' main brands include Ballantine's and Teacher's
Scotch whiskies, Canadian Club whiskey, Courvoisier cognac, Tia
Maria coffee liqueur, Harvey's Bristol cream sherry, and Coburn's
port.
   Completion of the sale, which must be cleared by British
regulators, is expected by the end of January.

<HEAD>Sears Forms ESOP, Faces Lawsuit Over Ads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. is giving its employees a
bigger stake in the company, and is fighting accusations that its
new ``everyday low pricing'' policy is a fraud.
   The Chicago-based retailing and financial-services conglomerate
announced an $800 million employee stock ownership plan Thursday
that will increase its workers' share of Sears common stock to 21
percent from 15 percent and save the company money.
   But even as Sears trumpeted the benefits of the ESOP, its
retailing division was forced to defend its claims of lower retail
prices against the New York State Attorney General's contention
that prices at Sears stores are the same or higher than under old
pricing policies.
   ``We have a valuable reputation for trust and integrity with
American consumers and we intend to prove these malicious charges
are false,'' said Michael Bozic, chairman and chief executive
officer of the Sears Merchandise Group.
   The employee stock ownership plan will provide Sears with a
cheaper way to fund its profit-sharing program since it can deduct
from its taxes dividends paid on the ESOP shares, said Sears
spokesman Douglas Fairweather.
   The ESOP will buy the shares, totaling about 22 million at the
current stock price, on the open market over the next several
months with money loaned by the company.
   The loan will be repaid from dividends on the ESOP shares and
future contributions to the profit-sharing plan, Fairweather said.
   Sears stock was up 25 cents at $36.87{ at midday in New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   In a prepared statement, Sears Chairman Edward Brennan said the
``increased ownership of Sears shares reinforces our employees'
commitment to Sears' success.''
   About 280,000 of Sears' 520,000 employees will participate in
the ESOP, Fairweather said.
   Sears was one of the first U.S. companies to establish a
profit-sharing plan for employees, in 1916. Under that plan, the
company buys stock and distributes it to employees.
   Fairweather said that with the ESOP, ``we're buying 15 years
worth (of stock) in one fell swoop and putting it in a trust. It
doesn't really affect the employees participating in the
profit-sharing plan; it's just a different way to fund it.''
   With the ESOP, Sears joins a growing list of companies that have
created such plans for a variety of reasons.
   Employers hope that employees who are also shareholders will
work harder to make the company grow and increase the value of
their investment.
   In addition, some companies have created ESOPs as a takeover
defense, believing that employees would be less likely than other
shareholders to sell their stock to an uninvited suitor.
   Fairweather said the Sears ESOP is not a takeover defense,
although there has been speculation the company could become a
takeover target because its value if broken up and sold is higher
than its stock price indicates, according to stock analysts.
   In addition to its retailing operation, Sears owns the Dean
Witter Reynolds brokerage house, Allstate Insurance and the
Coldwell Banker real-estate company.
   The lawsuit filed in New York State Supreme Court in Buffalo
attacks Sears' new retailing strategy, which the company
implemented with much fanfare last spring in a bid to win back the
market share Sears has been steadily losing to discounters such as
K mart and Wal-Mart.
   Sears began a $90 million advertising campaign in March touting
its new pricing policy, which said customers would receive
substantial savings over Sears' old prices, New York State Attorney
General Robert Abrams said.
   Sears contended in a statement that Abrams' charges were
distorted, untrue and based on a skimpy investigation that sampled
only a few of the more than 100,000 items sold by the chain.
   The state asked the court to fine Sears, stop it from engaging
in such practices in the future and order restitution for consumers
``who were induced to buy items because of the fraudulent
advertising and sales practices.''

<HEAD>GE Wins $500 Million Engine Contract From South Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LYNN, Massachusetts (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. says it has won
a $500 million contract to build fighter plane engines for the
government of South Korea.
   The Koreans plan to buy about 250 F404-GE-402 engines to power
120 F@A-18 fighters, a plane built by McDonnell Douglas, GE
announced Thursday. The governments of Kuwait and Switzerland have
purchased smaller numbers of the engine.
   ``These foreign sales are important because they help offset
potential reductions in the U.S. defense budget,'' said Robert
Turnbull, GE's vice president of military engines.
   Turnbull estimated that the plant in Lynn, Mass., which will
handle the South Korean order, would be building 200 F404 engines a
year for the next 10 years. He said it was likely the U.S. Navy
would scale back its purchases in the early 1990s.
   GE was once sole supplier of the F404 engines. Then in 1984 Navy
Secretary John Lehman brought in Pratt &amp; Whitney, a United
Technologies Corp. unit, as a second source.
   That decision was recently reversed, however, and GE is once
again the only firm building the engine.

<HEAD>Boeing Chairman Confirms Layoffs Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. plans to lay off about 1,200 employees
in the first half of 1990, with most of the cuts to be made among
production workers at Everett, Chairman Frank Shrontz said.
   Shrontz's comment, in interviews with the Seattle Times and the
Morning News Tribune of Tacoma, confirmed recent speculation that
jobs would be cut.
   The exact size of the layoffs or where they might occur has not
yet been determined, but it will likely be in the general range of
1,200 employees, Shrontz said.
   The company is studying how it can transfer rather than lay off
workers, he said. That study should be completed by early next year.
   ``The continued impact of the defense budget on some of our
programs has made it now look like we can't hold the decline to
just attirition and there will be layoffs in the first half'' of
next year, he said. aIn the early 1970s as many as 60,000 workers
lost their jobs in a two-year period.
   Boeing employs about 165,000 people worldwide.
   Shrontz said the company anticipated a reduction in production
workers who were needed for startup work on the 747-400 jetliner,
but had not thought layoffs would be necessary.
   Increased experience and productivity on the assembly lines is
lessening the need for more workers, Shrontz said, even though the
company is experiencing a record surge in orders _ 888 jets worth
$46.7 billion this year. There is also an $85 billion backlog of
more than 1,700 planes.
   Shrontz said he had hoped excess workers could have been
transferred to work on the B-2 Stealth bomber, but B2 work was
slowed as part of defense-budget cutbacks, leaving the extra
commercial jet workers nowhere to go. Boeing, a subcontractor to
the Northrop Corp. on the new bomber, has had nearly 10,000 working
on the B2.
   Layoffs here will most affect production workers, Shrontz said,
but some engineers in Wichita, Kan., may also lose their jobs.
   A 48-day machinists' strike that ended last month ``clearly hurt
our profitability,'' Shrontz said, but he declined to be specific.
   Boeing had been expected to deliver 94 jets during the fourth
quarter but now may deliver less than half that number.
   ``We hope to get (the factories) back up to speed in the first
quarter,'' he said.
   Boeing ``clearly has been hurt in image'' but a flurry of
federal investigations and charges filed this year, he conceded.
   ``The defense business is very difficult,'' he said. ``There is
still a significant resentment against defense contractors by the
public and I foresee this climate will continue.''
   Richard Fowler, a former Boeing Aerospace employee, was recently
convicted of 39 counts of document trafficking and fraud in federal
court in Alexandria, Va. Boeing agreed to pay a $5.2 million fine
and pleaded guilty to two counts of illegally receiving secret
government documents in the case.
   ``What's so frustrating about this is that it occurred in the
early 1980s,'' said Shrontz. ``I think we've gained substantially
in ethics since then.''
   He said the company has found no further evidence of fraud or
misconduct in federal investigations of project billings. The
government continues to investigate the overbilling allegations.
   On other topics, Shrontz said while Boeing is reorganizing its
defense business divisions, the company will stay in defense work.
   ``We'll find our niche,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Orders to U.S. factories for durable goods
jumped 5.1 percent in November, posting the biggest increase in a
year and averting the first three-month drop since mid-1986, the
government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods _
``big-ticket'' items expected to last more than three years _
increased to a seasonally adjusted $130.7 billion last month after
dropping 0.7 percent in October.
   Durable-goods orders also fell 1.2 percent in September. Orders
had not fallen for three straight months since 1986.
   The November gain, the largest since a 7.4 percent jump in
December 1988, was an exception to recent evidence that the U.S.
manufacturing sector is in a severe slowdown. Many economists are
forecasting a growth rate of 1 percent or less in the current
quarter and some fear the economy's unprecedented seven years of
peacetime expansion may end.
   Much of the softness has been concentrated in the auto industry,
where weak sales have prompted layoffs and production cutbacks. But
the softness has been spreading recently to the computer and
defense-related industries.
   As a result, economists and government officials have been
calling for a further relaxation of the Federal Reserve's grip on
credit, which the central bank had applied early this year in
efforts to cool the economy and reduce inflation.
   The Fed began loosening its grip gradually last June as
inflation moderated, and it apparently acted earlier this week to
permit short-term interest rates to fall further for the first time
since late November.
   A surprise in today's report was an increase in the closely
watched non-defense capital goods sector, which rose 8.3 percent
last month to $39 billion, the largest gain since a 10.1 percent
increease in December 1988. Economists use this category as a
barometer of business investment plans.
   The Commerce Department reported Thursday that a survey
completed in November indicated that businesses plan to increase
their plant and equipment spending only 4.9 percent next year _ a
rate nearly half the 8.5 percent increase this year.
   Defense orders rose 15.6 percent. Excluding the volatile defense
category, orders would have gained 4.2 percent in November after
increasing 1.8 percent in October.
   Transportation orders rose a sharp 10.5 percent to $36.7 billion
in November after a 2.1 percent gain in October. The November
advance came from increased demand for both aircraft and motor
vehicles. Aircraft represented 40 percent of the gain.
   Excluding the transportation category, durable-goods orders were
up 3.1 percent last month.
   Orders for non-electrical machinery, including computers and a
wide variety of industrial equipment, rose 6.6 percent to $22.9
billion after a 4.7 decline in October.
   Electrical-machinery orders jumped 7.9 percent to $21.7 billion,
virtually all in communications equipment.
   Primary metals were up 1.7 percent to $22.1 billion.
   Shipments of durable goods in November rose 1.5 percent to
$123.7 billion after a 3.1 decline in October.

   Local telephone companies will lose their
guaranteed profit margins on interstate revenues in 1991 under a
regulatory plan for better service at lower costs, the chairman of
the Federal Communications Commission said.
   New FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes, fulfilling the promises of his
predecessor, Dennis Patrick, said Thursday that beginning Jan. 1,
1991, many local phone companies will switch from the current
``rate-of-return'' pricing system to an incentive-based regulation
known as price caps.
   In the meantime, these companies will continue under the
rate-of-return formula that allows them to earn 12 percent above
their investments, the FCC decided in a 4-0 vote.
   Price caps will apply to the revenues local phone companies
collect from connecting their callers with long-distance companies.
Local phone companies with more than $100 million in annual
revenues will fall under price caps, which the FCC says is designed
to lower phone rates.
   When the FCC imposed price caps on the American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. this year after two decades of rate-of-return
regulation, it said consumers would reap $900 million in savings
over the next four years as AT&amp;T raised or lowered rates within
certain inflation-based price bands.
   Rate of return for the local companies, which was due to expire
Dec. 31, will continue into next year pending completion of a more
comprehensive study of the process.
   Sikes said the price cap ``is the best available means of
ensuring the United States the kind of efficient and effective
telecommunications system that it needs.''
   Local phone companies have been earning 12 percent since 1986,
which a consumer advocate said was too high under current market
conditions.
   ``The record clearly shows the rate of return should be
reduced,'' Gene Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation of America
said following the commission's vote. ``Consumers ought to be
seeing rates coming down because the companies' earnings are
excessive. ... Here was a chance to cut out the fat.''
   But the commission said the 12 percent rate was still ``just and
reasonable.''
   Patrick, the former FCC chairman, had said earlier this year he
wanted price caps for the local phone companies, but his aggressive
deregulatory approach ruffled many feathers in Congress.
   Richard Firestone, chief of the FCC's common carrier bureau,
said Thursday he had ``every expectation of being able to work
successfully with Congress.''
   Sikes made clear he was unsatisfied with the amount of
investment the local phone companies have been making in new
facilities and equipment under the current rate-of-return process.
   ``This past fall, when I addressed the U.S. Telephone
Association convention in San Francisco, I questioned the level of
industry investment in new plant and facilities,'' Sikes said.
``Since then, many companies have assured me that their plans for
1990 and beyond involve stepped-up modernization programs.''
   Sikes, noting his previous experience as overseer of the
Missouri Public Service Commission, said the cost-plus approach to
pricing used there ``ill-served the consumer.''
   Firestone said the FCC expected to adopt a price cap scheme by
the fall of next year, while also completing its rate-of-return
study at about the same time.
   Local phone companies must file comments on the present
rate-of-return scheme by Feb. 16.

   The stock market gained ground today, aided what
analysts described as yearend ``bargain hunting.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.69 to 2,695.82 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 562 up, 380 down and
526 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 18.55 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Traders appeared to be shopping warily among recently depressed
stocks, hoping that the market will gather strength after the
pressure of tax selling is lifted with the arrival of the new year.
   At the same time, however, the rally bid was faced with an
obstacle in the form of the Commerce Department's report that new
factory orders for durable goods rose 5.1 percent last month.
   That increase contrasted sharply with advance estimates of
little or no change in orders for relatively high-priced,
long-lasting goods.
   The suggestion it carried of unexpectedly brisk economic
activity helped push interest rates higher in the credit markets.
   Caterpillar dropped 2 to 55| on top of a 1~-point loss Thursday,
when the company reduced its earnings projection for the fourth
quarter.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.28 to 190.78. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .17 at 369.38.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average gained 3.20 to
2,691.13.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 926 up, 619 down and 463 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 175.15 million shares, against 176.52
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>New Muni Bond Rules Effective Jan. 1 Should Help Inform Investors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Starting Jan. 1, investors should have more
information available to make an informed decision when dabbling in
the municipal bond market.
   That's when federal disclosure rules for municipal bonds take
effect. The rules, released earlier this year by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, are designed to prevent such debacles as the
1983 bond default by the Washington Public Power Supply System.
   The $2.25 billion worth of bad WPPSS bonds _ the largest default
in municipal bond history _ led to these first-ever disclosure
rules for municipal bonds. Many brokerages that underwrote WPPSS
bonds later said they never were told by the utility consortium of
its financial problems.
   Muni bonds were exempt from the disclosure requirements placed
on other securities when the SEC was established in 1934.
   The new rules require brokerages underwriting municipal bond
issues of more than $1 million in value to obtain extensive
information about the projects financed by the bonds.
   Brokerages also must obtain information on the credit history of
the state or local government or agency issuing the bonds and any
foreseeble risks to investors.
   Brokerages must release this information to all potential buyers
in the form of official statements, which resemble the prospectuses
that companies are required to issue before they sell shares of
stock.
   Most muni bond issuers have been putting out official statements
for years, but the SEC rules make them mandatory and also tighten
the time frame in which they must be issued.
   Under the rules, a muni bond underwriter must make sure an
official statement is available within seven business days of a
bond issue's first selling day.
   Currently, it is common for a 30-day lag before an official
statement is released, said Christopher Taylor, executive director
of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the industry's
self-regulatory body established by Congress.
   ``We found that the problem with disclosure documentation was it
was produced but it wasn't disseminated in a timely fashion,''
added George Brakatselos, a vice president of the Public Securities
Association, a trade group for the municipal bond industry.
   Since the rules require brokers to describe potential risks of
bond issues, they could make it easier for investors to sue
investment houses in the event of a default.
   However, the rules don't apply to the billions of dollars in
municipal bonds now in investors' hands.
   The SEC rules also promote the creation of a central repository
to store and update the official statements.
   Under the rules, a brokerage must make official statements
available for 90 days after the end of a bond's underwriting
period. But if the statements are filed with a central repository,
the brokerage only has to make them available for 25 days after the
end of the underwriting period.
   The creation of a central repository could mark a turning point
in the municipal bond industry.
   The hope is that municipal bond issuers take it upon themselves
to update their disclosure forms periodically so that the
repository is viewed as the source of current information on
municipal issues that have been on the market for some time.
   If such a system develops, official statements could begin to
resemble the quarterly financial reports that corporations are
required to issue for their stock and bondholders.
   ``Issuers have long said, `Gee, I'd like to let the world know
how I'm doing but I have nowhere to send the information,'' Taylor
said last week.
   Four companies have said they want to set up a central
repository. In addition, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board,
which originated the idea, is devising plans for a computerized
repository of its own. The SEC has yet to select which group or
groups will be designated as official repositories.
   Under the rulemaking board's plans, it would make the statements
available to anyone for a nominal fee.
   Taylor said he envisions private companies repackaging
information from the rulemaking board's library and reselling it in
a form that may be more useful to bond traders, brokers and
investors.
   The Public Securities Association says it's pleased with the
government's new rules, especially those encouraging a central
repository.
   ``I think it will benefit everybody because right now there is
no single place you can go to get an official statement,''
Brakatselos said.

<TEXT>
   Like nomads at a desert oasis, investors here and
abroad are gulping shares of Britain's newly privatized water
industry, lifting prices to unexpected highs but raising fears of
foreign control over a necessity of life.
   The government sold 10 water utilities in England and Wales for
$8.4 billion earlier this month. It was the latest in a series of
privatizations and surprisingly successful in an otherwise sluggish
stock market.
   The government offered 2.183 million shares at the equivalent of
$3.84 each. The shares, which began trading Dec. 12, quickly rose
in price and by Friday were worth about 50 percent more on the
London Stock Exchange.
   ``They have done fairly well,'' said Stephen Doe, a water
industry analyst at the London investment firm Smith New Court PLC.
   British investors weren't the only ones to perceive the water
industry as an opportunity. Foreigners including a French water
company also were aggressive buyers of the stock.
   Within less than a week of the trading launch, the French group
Lyonnaise des Eaux announced it acquired stakes in three water
companies _ 9 percent in Anglian Water, 6 percent in Wessex Water
and 2 percent of Severn Trent.
   France's two other big water companies, Generale des Eaux and
Societe d'Amenagement Urbain et Rural, also are expected to be big
buyers of the British shares.
   There's no immediate takeover threat to the big water utilities
because the government retained ``golden shares'' limiting holdings
in them to 15 percent for five years.
   However, Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley recently has expressed
reservations about this limitation, suggesting it might be lifted.
   The French water companies are keen to invest because they
believe the British water companies are undervalued and offer good
prospects for earnings growth, analysts said.
   The French companies have the expertise and technology to
capitalize on the opportunities, which aren't available in other
European countries where the water industries are mostly
state-controlled.
   But some Britons oppose foreign control on their sources of
water, particularly if the owners are French, an historical British
rival.
   The resentment has been suggested in Britain's financial press,
which has quoted critics of the water privatization as portraying
the French water companies as raiding opportunists.
   But the Times of London wrote in an editorial: ``While the
government might have preferred to see British rather than French
predators, it can hardly object when it is committed to a level
playing field in the takeover game in Europe. We are all good
Europeans now.''
   The water shares are popular with other investors for other
reasons. They are considered recession proof because water is a
vital commodity. Built-in price increases in the form of rate hikes
virtually guarantee good profits for at least the next few years.
   Nigel Hawkins, water industry analyst for Security Pacific-Hoare
Govett Ltd., said the water shares' average yield is attractive at
7 percent, a 50 percent premium on the average market yield.
   The shares have been boosted by speculation about the French
companies' buying intentions.
   There had been concerns that the water sale would fail because
it followed the sharp drop in world stock markets a few months ago.
But demand for the shares greatly exceeded the supply.
   ``We have proved our critics wrong,'' Environment Minister
Michael Howard said.
   The water sale is the first privitization since the government's
divestment of its one-third stake in British Petroleum Co. PLC,
which was a failure because it coincided with the October 1987
stock market crash. Many brokers suffered severe losses from the BP
fiasco.
   The water privatization also faced stiff opposition from critics
who believed such a vital utility should remain in state hands for
reasons of security and water quality.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's critics said she was becoming
too extreme during her third term, taking a privatization program
too far. But she is proceeding.
   The government also plans to sell the country's electricity
industry by mid-1992. That sale could raise more than $32 billion,
dwarfing the other privatizations.
   Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative government has sold $53 billion
worth of state-owned companies in the past decade as part of a
broader economic policy of encouraging private enterprise and
investment by British citizens.

<TEXT>
   Smithkline Beecham PLC, a major international
pharmaceutical company, said Friday it has agreed to sell its U.S.
and Canadian household products businesses to a West Germany
company for $107 million in cash.
   Smithkline said the sale to Joh. A. Benckiser GmbH is consistent
with its strategy of focusing on international healthcare following
the merger of Smithkline Beckman Corp. with Beecham Group PLC
earlier this year.
   Household products included in the sale are Calgon, a leading
U.S. bath additive, Cling Free, a fabric softener used in driers,
and Delicare, a detergent for delicate products.
   Smithkline said most of the products are made at a plant in
Rockwood, Michigan, where 130 people are employed.
   The products were acquired in 1977 from Merck &amp; Co., which
retains the right to use the Calgon name for industrial products.
   Benckiser previously marketed Calgon household products in
Europe and the purchase will give it the right to sell them in
North America and other countries.

   Share prices rose after a shortened session Friday
on the London Stock Exchange, with most dealers and investors
remaining on the sidelines before the long holiday weekend.
   At 3:30 p.m. local time, when the market officially closed, the
Financial imes-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 9.0 points, or
0.4 percent, at 2,362.0. The market normally closes at 5 p.m.
   Volume was a light 375.3 million shares, down from 438.0 million
traded on Thursday.
   ``There have been one or two small buyers and no sellers,'' said
one dealer. ``There's no real trade.''
   Dealers said they didn't wish to take fresh trading positions
ahead of the long weekend. British financial markets won't reopen
until Wednesday.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 8.9 points at 1,862.2
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 3.43 points
to close at 1,280.27.

   Soybean futures prices settled moderately lower
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade in quiet, sporadic trading.
The grain markets finished mixed in the shortened pre-holiday
session.
   Analysts said the soybean complex was dominated by one large
trade house that was seeking to press the price for March delivery
below $5.88 a bushel, and by independent ``local'' traders who were
sellers in the soybean meal market.
   March soybeans finished at $5.85} a bushel.
   Wheat settled slightly lower but the corn and oat markets were
nearly unchanged in extremely quiet trading with many traders
absent because of the sub-zero weather in Chicago or the upcoming
holiday weekend.
   The markets will reopen on Tuesday.
   Wheat futures settled { cent to 1{ cents lower with the contract

   The stock market gained ground in quiet
preholiday trading today, aided what analysts described as yearend
``bargain hunting.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 17.49 to
2,708.62 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 9 to 5 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 891 up, 503
down and 490 unchanged.
   Traders appeared to be doing some last-minute shopping among
recently depressed stocks, hoping that the market will gather
strength after the pressure of tax selling is lifted with the
arrival of the new year.
   At the same time, however, the rally bid was faced with an
obstacle in the form of the Commerce Department's report that new
factory orders for durable goods rose 5.1 percent last month.
   That increase contrasted sharply with advance estimates of
little or no change in orders for relatively high-priced,
long-lasting goods.
   The suggestion it carried of unexpectedly brisk economic
activity helped push interest rates higher in the credit markets.
   Regional telephone stocks were standout gainers, following word
that the Federal Communications Commission plans to regulate local
phone companies on the basis of price rather than profits under a
plan to take effect Jan. 1, 1991.
   Bell South gained 2\ to 58; Pacific Telesis ~ to 49; Nynex 2| to

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices fell Friday in abbreviated
pre-holiday trading on a lower dollar overseas, concerns over
Japanese interest rates and a buoyant report on U.S. durable goods
orders.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond declined 5-16 point, or
$3.13 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices
fall, jumped to 7.88 percent from 7.85 percent late Thursday.
   The credit markets shut down at 1 p.m. EST in advance of the
Christmas and Hanukkah holidays.
   William V. Sullivan, director of money-market research for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., said dealers sold bonds in an effort to
reduce their portfolios before the end of the year.
   He said a drop in the dollar in overseas trading also spurred
some selling, as did concern that Japan may raise its key lending
rate by half a percentage point over the long holiday weekend.
   The U.S. financial markets are closed Monday for Christmas.
   Economists said Friday's report showing orders for durable goods
_ costly items expected to last more than three years _ up 5.1
percent in November caused an immediate selloff. The increase was
the biggest in a year and averted the first three-month drop since
mid-1986.
   The November durable goods gain was an exception to recent
evidence that the U.S. manufacturing sector is in a severe slowdown.
   `It seemed to suggest that although there are pockets of
weakness in the economy, we're not in a position that would
indicate that a recession is at hand,'' Sullivan said.
   An economic slowdown generally boosts demand for long-term
fixed-income investments such as bonds, which are seen as a hedge
against hard times.
   Kathleen Camilli, a money-market economist with Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., said the increase in durable goods orders was sharply
higher than economists' projections ranging from no increase to up
0.5 percent.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term government issues fell 7-32 point to \ point,
intermediate maturities were down 5-16 point to 13-32 point, and
long-term issues were 9-32 point lower, according to Telerate Inc.,
a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 3.36 to 1,194.16.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.82 percent as the
discount gained 3 basis points to 7.58 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 7.83 percent as the discount increased 7 basis points
to 7.44 percent. Yields on one-year bills jumped to 7.69 percent as
the discount rose 5 basis points to 7.16 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8 3-16 percent, down from 8\ percent late
Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds closed at 93}, down 1-32 point. The average
yield to maturity held at 7.22 percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>38,000 and Rising: Sun Doesn't Set on Tokyo Stock Exchange</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange is heading for the 40,000
barrier that bullish Japanese analysts hope will make it a
bellwether for the world's financial markets.
   While American markets have been battered by recession fears and
volatile swings, Japanese stocks have risen ever higher, buoyed in
part by the nation's growing sense of itself as a global economic
leader.
   ``Until a couple of years ago, the first thing in the morning
brokers used to do was to check how the Dow Jones did overnight,''
said Kenji Maeda of Yamaichi Securities Co., referring to the
widely watched New York Stock Exchange barometer.
   Now, he said, ``it's not just Wall Street but something else _
political, economic news or disaster _ that affects us here and
elsewhere, too.''
   Tokyo is certainly not immume from the jitters that plague
investors in other markets. Just this past week, worries about
rising interest rates in Japan and the implications of the U.S.
attack in Panama knocked stock prices off their record-setting pace.
   But, over the course of the last several weeks, the Tokyo market
has set a string of new highs. Since Wall Street's Oct. 13th
debacle, when the Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 190
points, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average has gained more than
3,800 points, or about 10 percent.
   It took only six trading days for the Nikkei to jump from 36,000
to 37,000, and 10 more trading days to surpass the 38,000-point
mark recently.
   The index has risen more than 8,000 points, or nearly 30
percent, in the course of the past year, hitting its current record
of 38,586.18 last Monday. Analysts predict it will hit 40,000 early
next year.
   The Dow Jones average, by comparison, is up about 500 points
over the year, or a little less than 25 percent.
   The Nikkei closed out the week Friday at 38,040.37, dragged down
by the concerns over interest rates and Panama.
   Not everyone reads the year's numbers as good news. Many foreign
economists say the Tokyo market is overpriced and they play down
its worldwide importance. They say European markets still follow
New York, as they did during the October drop, though Tokyo is
admired for its resilience.
   Analysts credit affluent investors, a shortage of traded shares
due to Japan's interlocking companies, fairly stable foreign
exchange and interest rates, and widely used index-linked buying
for Tokyo's steady rise.
   Political events such as the opening of the Berlin Wall also
have fueled optimism in Japan, whose economic power could be
further enhanced by the growth of consumer economies in Eastern
Europe. In addition, the Tokyo market tends to rise at the end of
every year as dealers create momentum to get the New Year off on
the right foot.
   ``Participants are reacting in anticipation of future trends in
the world, instead of trading restlessly, watching economic
fundamentals and indicators on a day-to-day basis,'' said Masahiro
Umemori, an analyst with Normura Securities Co.
   Added Maeda: ``The recent quick rises in share prices made
investors impatient and feel obliged to buy so that they won't miss
the bus.''
   Kazuyuki Suzuki, a dealer with Daiwa Securities Co., said the
Nikkei picked up speed when the Berlin Wall was opened in early
November.
   ``The index has been rising overwhelmingly fast since then,
although nothing in the economy has changed, except for investors'
expectations for more business opportunities in eastern Europe,''
he said.
   Others said recent statements in Washington that the United
States may cut defense spending because of easing East-West
tensions has boosted the Nikkei.
   In Tokyo, only about 25 percent of the total number of stocks
are traded on the market, while the rest are held by business
alliances among companies and never offered for sale.
   Rinichi Kozaki, chairman of Toyo Trust Investment Management
Co., said the practice magnifies share-price rises because a lot of
money is chasing the small number of shares that actually change
hands.
   Dealers said index-linked buying _ which has been blamed for
causing turmoil in the U.S. stock market _ has enabled a few rich
institutional investors to push up the Japan market's direction.
   Individual investors accounted for 31.6 percent of trading in
November, while corporate investors had the rest, according to
Tokyo Stock Exchange statistics.
   Thanks in part to the increased value of the yen since 1985, the
Tokyo exchange has become the world's largest in terms of the value
of listed companies. The total value is about $4 trillion, compared
with about $3 trillion for New York Stock Exchange-listed companies.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 20 years ago, Linda Higson was working as
a teen-age nanny in Italy when she was talked into playing a
featured role in a Coca-Cola commercial that showed dozens of young
people singing on a hilltop.
   ``I'd like to buy the world a home and furnish it with love,''
the 19-year-old, blonde-haired Briton sang to open the 1971 Coke
commercial that became an industry classic.
   The ad led to some minor modeling jobs for Miss Higson, but she
eventually went home to a catering business in England, got married
and had four children.
   Early next year, television viewers are going to see her again,
this time with her 10-year-old daughter Kelly, in prominent roles
in a new version of the ad that reunites about 25 original cast
members and includes dozens of children.
   Coca-Cola has been revving up the publicity machinery in recent
weeks to stoke interest in the reunion ad that debuts Jan. 28 on
the CBS telecast of the Super Bowl, the National Football League's
championship game that usually draws a huge audience.
   The company recently flew the former Miss Higson, now 38 years
old and known as Mrs. Neary, and Stephanie Roos, another original
cast member now living in Indianapolis, to New York to talk with
reporters about the commercial.
   In one illustration of how much has changed since the first ad
was shot, the two women said they had each rejected an offer of a
flat fee for the new commercial and chose a compensation plan tied
to how often the commercial runs.
   They each declined to say how much the onetime buyout offer was
worth, and noted they were gambling that the new commercial would
be a hit in deciding to take a pay plan linked to air time.
   For the original ad, they had each been happy to get the flat
fee of about $50 and did not get any residuals based on how often
it ran.
   ``The first one was shown so much I said, `I wish I had a penny
for every time it was shown,''' Mrs. Roos said.
   The Atlanta-based Coca-Cola and its ad agency McCann-Erickson
had to do some detective work to locate original cast members for
the new commercial, which was shot on the same hill near Rome as
the original ad.
   McCann got a break when a box was found in its New York office
full of photos and ID's for some of the original cast. But many of
them had long since moved from Rome, and several women had new last
names by marriage.
   The search for the former Miss Higson was complicated by the
fact that her name had been listed as ``Hipson.'' A detective
agency was hired to search Great Britain for a woman with that last
name to no avail.
   As the shooting date approached last fall, the agency took out a
classified ad in several widely-circulated English language
newspapers in Europe.
   ``Linda Hipson, where are you? If you're the Linda Hipson who
was in a Coca-Cola commercial 20 years ago, please call (a
McCann-Erickson telephone number in New York). We'd love to hear
you sing again,'' the ad said.
   The former Miss Higson _ Mrs. Neary _ missed the ad, but a
friend spotted it while reading the International Herald Tribune in
the Stockholm airport. He contacted Mrs. Neary, who called the ad
agency and agreed to go to Rome for the reunion.
   Altogether, about 25 of the 40 principals in the original ad
appear in the new version, said McCann-Erickson executive Paul
Cappelli.
   Mrs. Neary said teaching the world to sing again ``in perfect
harmony'' _ this time with her daughter _ was an interesting
diversion from her routine.
   ``It's like being picked up out of your life and if you are a
housewife, it's a little like Cinderella, don't you think?'' Mrs.
Neary said.

   The dollar tumbled Friday in abbreviated
pre-Christmas foreign-exchange trading, weighed down by continuing
demand for the West German mark and expectations that U.S. interest
rates are headed lower.
   Gold prices edged higher in New York after turning in a mixed
performance overseas. Republic National Bank in New York quoted an
after-hours bid for a troy ounce of gold at $413.75 as of 1 p.m.
EST, up from $412.20 late Thursday.
   Traders said the dollar was little affected by the continuing
U.S. intervention in Panama and the fall Friday of Nicolae
Ceausescu, the long-time Romanian leader.
   The currency markets finished the trading day at around midday,
several hours earlier than normal as traders got a headstart on the
three-day holiday weekend.
   ``The dollar traded in a range early and fell off late in the
session,'' said Jeff Mondschein, managing director of foreign
exchange for Continental Bank in Chicago.
   But he cautioned against reading much into the decline, saying
trading was so light that a few orders were all that was needed to
move the market.
   The underlying factors that have affected the dollar for the
past few days _ a weakening U.S. economy and the expectation that
interest rates are headed lower _ continued to depress the
currency, Mondschein said. Falling interest rates hurt the dollar
by cutting yields foreigners can get on dollar-denominated
investments.
   In Europe, dealers said the dollar was hurt by the strength of
the mark and said that as the dollar fell below the 1.7250-mark
level, dealers who had instructions from some customers to sell
dollars at that level began executing those orders.
   But trading activity also was curtailed in Europe, as most major
banks cut the trading day short in advance of the Christmas holiday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.10 Japanese yen to close at 143.67
yen. Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at 143.05 yen. In New
York, the dollar fell to 142.35 yen from 143.65 yen late Thursday.
   The dollar also lost ground against the British pound. In
London, the pound rose to $1.6205 from $1.6125 late Thursday.
Sterling rose to $1.62425 in New York from $1.6145 late Thursday.
   Selected dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.7070 West German marks, down from 1.7260;
1.5490 Swiss francs, down from 1.5580; 5.8345 French francs, down
from 5.8910; 1,277.75 Italian lire, down from 1,285.50; and 1.1592
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1597.
   Other afternoon dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.7090 West German marks, down from 1.7250;
1.5475 Swiss francs, down from 1.5575; 5.8385 French francs, down
from 5.8955; 1.9330 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9560; 1,277.75
Italian lire, down from 1,287.50; and 1.1585 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1605.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery rose
$1.30 a troy ounce to $413.20.
   Earlier, gold fell to a late bid of $412.25 a troy ounce in
London, down from $412.75 late Thursday. In Zurich, Switzerland,
the metal finished at $413 an ounce for the third session in a row.
   Gold rose 33 cents in Hong Kong to close at $411.69 an ounce.
   Silver rose 1.7 cents a troy ounce to $5.560 on the Comex in New
York. Silver rose in London to a late bid of $5.58 a troy ounce
from Thursday's $5.57.

<HEAD>Baby Boomers Like Humor For Christmas Cards But Tradition Prevails</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DWIGHT WOODWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   'Tis the season to be traditional, but silly
Santas, laughing reindeer and teddy bears are arriving in mailboxes
nationwide this year as Christmas card makers appeal to a trend in
card buying that transcends race, religion and sex _ humor.
   Those who like the offbeat can send a card showing cow udders
singing a Christmas carol or Santa kicking a football through the
antlers of a laughing reindeer.
   While the majority of the 2.3 billion Christmas cards sent this
year will reflect more customary symbols of the holiday, humor is
where the growth is, said Terry Carney, spokeswoman for American
Greetings Corp., the largest publicly owned greeting card company
with $1.2 billion in annual sales.
   ``But it's not usually the kind of humor that is nasty, rude or
sarcastic,'' said Ms. Carney.
   About 500 members of the creative staff at American, based in
suburban Cleveland, produce about 2,300 designs a year of which
about one-third are Christmas cards, Ms. Carney said.
   In addition to laughs, specialty cards with a regional flavor _
cactus for the Southwest, for instance _ or messages aimed at
particular occupations are popular.
   As with most consumer tastes, the explanation is demographic.
   ``The bulk of the cards purchased are by people between 35 and
59,'' said E. Gray Glass III, a New York stock market analyst with
Prudential-Bache Inc. Glass. ``These are people that move around a
lot and they want to keep in contact with their friends.''
   Barbara Miller, spokeswoman for Hallmark Cards Inc., agreed that
humor is in this year, but she said tradition dies hard.
   ``Wreaths, holly trees, bells, fireplace and sleigh scenes _
these are the symbols people see as Christmas,'' she said.
   That doesn't mean the giant Hallmark hasn't cultivated a Yuppie
sense of humor. One Hallmark offering shows a dazed cat with a
stocking cap swinging on an ornament attached to Christmas tree
lights. Inside, the caption reads, ``In the air there's a feline of
Christmas.''
   Among the specialty cards designed to suit distinctive tastes
are ones ``for the barber, the teacher, bus driver or the
mailman,'' Ms. Miller said.
   With annual sales of more than $3.5 billion, the privately held
Hallmark, based in Kansas City, Mo., has the biggest single share
of the greeting card market, producing 2,700 card designs for
over-the-counter sales and another 400 different boxed sets of
multiple cards, Ms. Miller said.
   Glass said Hallmark produces about 44 percent of U.S. Christmas
cards, followed by American with 32 percent and Cincinnati-based
Gibson Greetings Inc. about 10 percent.
   Another 700 to 800 U.S. companies produce the remainder of U.S.
Christmas cards with a negligible portion coming from foreign
manufacturers, Glass said.
   Among the strangest, if not funniest, cards to emerge are
pet-to-pet missives.
   ``From our cat to your cat, from our dog to your dog _ people
consider their pets part of the family,'' Ms. Miller said. ``They
are cute cards, not drippy or sentimental.''

<HEAD>Ford To Offer $1.55 Billion in Debt Securities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. intends to sell $1.55 billion
in debt securities to pay for its recent acquisition of Associates,
the nation's third-largest independent finance company, according
to documents filed Friday.
   In a registration statement filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Ford said it is seeking to issue the debt
securities through Ford Holdings Inc., a subsidiary formed in
September to acquire Associates.
   The debt securities will be sold ``to reduce short-term debt,
including borrowings to fund the acquisition of Associates,''
according to the registration statement.
   Ford acquired Dallas-based Associates First Capital Corp. from
Paramount Communications Inc. for $3.35 billion on Oct. 31.
   According to the statement, Ford financed the Associates
acquisition through $2.25 billion in loans and the issuance of $800
million in flexible rate auction preferred stock.
   Last month, a Ford subsidiary began a $2.5 billion cash tender
offer to acquire Jaguar PLC, the British luxury carmaker.
   ``Continued large capital expenditures for new automotive
products and facilities improvements, together with the
acquisitions of Associates and Jaguar, have used and will continue
to use substantial amounts of cash,'' the statement said.
   ``Consequently, Ford and its affiliates may substantially
increase borrowings in 1990 and thereafter.''
   Associates is the third-largest independent finance company
based on total assets of $14 billion. The company has dealings in
real estate-secured loans, credit cards, direct installment and
revolving loans.
   Ford's SEC filing said the debt securities would be sold through
underwriters which may include Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices were generally lower in
thin trading Friday as investors squared their positions in advance
of the long holiday weekend.
   Home heating oil prices, which surged in recent weeks as the
temperature plunged, were mixed with the January and February
contracts rising in anticipation of increased demand and the later
months declining. The January contract rose 1.93 cents to settle at
81.74 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange after
rising more than 4 cents on Thursday.
   Crude oil and gasoline futures prices fell across the board.
   The February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the leading
grade of U.S. crude, fell 23 cents to $21.29 per 42-gallon barrel
after rising 31 cents in Thursday's session. The January contract
for wholesale unleaded gasoline was down 0.18 cent after soaring
2.41 cents on Thursday.
   William Byers, an oil market analyst with Bear Stearns &amp; Co.,
said investors were liquidating contracts before the three-day
Christmas holiday weekend because of forecasts of warmer weather in
the Northeast.
   Trading was thin and the markets closed early.

``bargain hunting.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 20.26 to
2,711.39, cutting its loss for the week to 28.16 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in

   The suggestion it carried of unexpectedly brisk economic
activity helped push interest rates higher in the credit markets.
   Regional telephone stocks were standout gainers, following word

<HEAD>A Tale of Two Blue Chips</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One blue-chip stock multiplied your money to
nearly 10 times its former value. Another turned your dollar into
less than a dime.
   That, in microcosm, was the story of the 1980s on Wall Street _
a decade in which many fortunes were made, and more than a few were
lost, in a roaring bull market.
   To pick the biggest winner among the 30 stocks that now make up
the Dow Jones industrial average, you had to ignore a gathering
storm over the tobacco industry.
   The company in question was Philip Morris, whose shares
increased almost 850 percent in value from the beginning of the
'80s through mid-December, according to calculations by William
LeFevre at the investment firm of Advest Inc. Adjusted for splits,
Philip Morris stock soared from $4.50 to $40-plus.
   Philip Morris, widely known as the producer of Marlboro and
several other cigarette brands, began a diversification program
many years ago with Miller Brewing Co.
   In the '80s it claimed the status of world's largest
manufacturer of consumer products with the acquisitions of General
Foods and Kraft Inc., gaining such familiar product lines as
Maxwell House coffee and Post cereals.
   Meanwhile, it strengthened its hold as the dominant force in the
tobacco industry.
   At the other end of the standings, Navistar International was
the biggest loser among the Dow 30, falling from $39.12 at the
start of the '80s to less than $4 recently.
   Navistar, known a decade ago as International Harvester, left
the farm- and construction-machinery businesses to concentrate on
making trucks and diesel-powered equipment. It suffered through a
seven-year spell of losses before recently returning to
profitability.
   Among the winners, Philip Morris wasn't alone in benefiting from
the ravenous consumer appetites of the '80s.
   Close behind it in the Dow performance ranking stood McDonald's
Corp., up nearly 700 percent; Coca-Cola, up nearly 600 percent, and
Merck, the health care giant, up more than 500 percent.
   Like Navistar, Bethlehem Steel, which was down more than 20
percent, and International Business Machines, up less than 50
percent, reflected the many problems of the economy's industrial
sector.
   What did all this mean for a diversified portfolio of stocks?
Once the big winners and losers are balanced out, the Dow Jones
industrial average has more than tripled. ``All in all, not a bad
10 years,'' LeFevre observed.
   In the past week, the average suffered something of a setback,
beset by fears that softening real estate markets might increase
the odds of a recession in 1990. It closed Friday at 2,711.39, down
28.16 from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 1.50 to
191.95; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
rose .73 to 444.57, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was down 1.50 at 191.95.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 168.70 million shares a day,
against 185.54 million the week before.
   Just how the experience of the '80s might translate into good
decisions for the '90s remains to be seen.
   Some say the new decade, like the old one, may begin with a
recession, especially since the great prosperity of the past
several years has left a lot of debts to be paid.
   Others contend that the pessimists and the skeptics, who missed
many an opportunity in the '80s, may just wind up repeating the
same mistake.
   Whatever happens, however, people in the stocks and bonds
business say the story of the '80s' big winners and losers provides
a dramatic demonstration of the virtues of a diversified investment
program.
   Anyone who owned $10,000 each of the best and worst blue chips
through the '80s would have an $80,000-plus Philip Morris profit as
consolation, and then some, for a $9,000 Navistar loss.

<HEAD>Profit-Taking Cuts Orange Juice Gains in Wild Session</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Orange juice futures prices fell sharply Friday on the New York
Cotton Exchange as skittish players took pre-weekend profits in a
wild session that featured a one-hour trading halt to prevent
mixups in the flood of orders.
   ``We had a really crazy market here,'' said Celeste Georkakis,
an analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc.
   On other commodity markets, heating oil futures posted fresh
gains as the nation's record-setting cold spell continued; precious
metals advanced; livestock and meat futures were mixed; and grains
and soybeans were mixed.
   Most commodity exchanges held abbreviated trading sessions to
give traders and employees an early start on the long holiday
weekend.
   After rising sharply in the four previous sessions, frozen
concentrated orange juice futures fell 1 cent to 4.7 cents Friday
with the contract for January delivery settling at $1.37 a pound.
   The runup earlier in the week had been fueled by forecasts for a
damaging freeze this weekend in the Central Florida citrus belt,
and those forecasts remained in effect on Friday.
   But many traders fearful of carrying their positions through the
three-day weekend opted to take profits rather than risk a market
dive when trading resumes on Tuesday.
   The lowest temperatures were expected to reach Florida on
Saturday and Sunday, so the threat of damage to Florida fruit will
be long past when the orange juice futures market reopens.
   The market opened with a surge and quickly rose the permitted
5-cents-a-pound limit for daily trading on heavy speculative
buying. But trade selling emerged at mid-morning and speculators
joined in, pushing prices nearly limit-down before the exchange
called a trading halt at 11 a.m. EST. Heavy selling continued when
trading resumed at noon.
   Heating oil for near-term delivery rose sharply for the sixth
straight day and the 17th time in the last 18 trading sessions on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. The buying again was linked to
weather-driven demand for shrinking supplies of home heating oil.
   Dealers have reported spot shortages of fuel oil in the heavily
populated Northeast, where temperatures have been below normal
since late November.
   Heating oil futures settled .83 cent lower to 1.93 cents higher
with January at 81.74 cents a gallon; West Texas Intermediate crude
oil was 23 cents to 27 cents lower with February at $21.29 a
barrel; unleaded gasoline was .18 cent to .65 cent lower with
January at 55.45 cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures rose modestly on New York's Commodity
Exchange, reflecting expectations of lower interest rates and a
weaker dollar.
   The Commmerce Department's report of a 5.1 percent rise in
factory orders for durable goods last month also was a supportive
factor, analysts said.
   Gold futures finished $1.20 to $1.30 higher with December at
$413.20 a troy ounce; silver was 1.6 cents to 1.9 cents higher with
silver at $5.56 a troy ounce.
   Most live cattle and hog futures retreated on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange on expectations that warmer temperatures next
week in the Great Plains and Midwest will lead to increased
livestock marketings.
   Live cattle settled .25 cent lower to .07 cent higher with
February at 76.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent lower
to .13 cent higher wiith January at 84.82 cents a pound; live hogs
were .60 cent lower to .02 cent higher with February at 48.87 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .42 cent lower to .17 cent higher
with February at 49.77 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures settled moderately lower on the Chicago Board of
Trade in quiet, sporadic trading. The grain markets finished nearly
unchanged.
   Analysts said soybeans were pressured by perceptions of improved
growing conditions in soybean-growing areas of South America and
slack export demand.
   Wheat futures settled { cent to 1{ cents lower with the contract
for delivery in March at $4.11} a bushel; corn futures were
unchanged to } cent higher with March at $2.39 a bushel; oats were
\ cent lower to \ cent higher with March at $1.54\ a bushel;
soybeans were 2\ cents to 3 cents lower with January at $5.72\ a

<HEAD>Orange Juice and Heating Oil Jump Because of Cold Wave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Speculators in orange juice and heating oil futures are having
an especially merry Christmas because of a record-busting cold
front that prompted fears of a Florida freeze and created spot
shortages of fuel.
   Most other commodity markets were fairly quiet ahead of the long
holiday weekend.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice for delivery in January settled
at $1.37 a pound Friday on the New York Cotton Exchange, about a 9
percent increase from $1.26 a pound a week earlier. The contract
traded as high as $1.4225 on Friday but finished the day with a
steep loss as traders took pre-weekend profits.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, heating oil for January
delivery rose 16 percent to 81.74 cents a gallon from 70.42 cents.
   The dramatic rise in both markets was almost entirely due to the
relentless southerly advance of a cold air mass that meteorologists
rated as one of the most intense of this decade.
   The leading edge of the chill that hit North Florida early
Friday was expected to bring near-record lows to the entire state,
including the citrus-growing region in the middle of the Florida
peninsula.
   About 85 percent of Florida's $1 billion-plus citrus crop is
still on the trees. The last major killing frost, on Christmas Day
1983, damaged at least 30 percent of the orange crop.
   Citrus specialists estimated less than 5 percent of the state's
700,000 acres of trees were protected by costly heaters or wind
blowers.
   But the 1983 freeze and another in 1985 prompted citrus growers
to shift production further south. So while the projected lows of
15 to 29 degrees in the citrus belt would be enough to damage
fruit, analysts said the damage would probably be less severe than
six years ago.
   ``The situation was quite different in 1983,'' said Celeste
Georkakis, an analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc. ``If the
groves were where they were then, we'd have the same effect, but
they aren't.''
   This year's Florida orange crop is projected at 133 million
boxes vs. 170 million in 1983. But Brazil has since become a major
producer of orange juice and is expected to harvest a record large
crop this year.
   Therefore, Ms. Georkakis said, any frost-damage shortfall in
U.S. production can be made up with Brazilian imports, reducing
excess supplies on the world market.
   Some heating oil suppliers in the Northeast reported temporary

   Star Enterprise, a Texaco Inc. affiliate, said sales of home
heating oil were running 50 percent above projections for the month

   The extraordinary domestic demand extended to six weeks a
heating-oil price rally that ran its first leg on concerns about
supplies of fuel oil in Europe.

<HEAD>Judge Unseals Mobil Documents in Wrongful Firing Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Friday unsealed confidential
corporate documents in a lawsuit against Mobil Oil Corp. but
withheld the order when lawyers for the oil giant said they would
appeal.
   The company is fighting to prevent the disclosure of the
documents _ reports on environmental conditions at its chemical
division plants _ because it says they are self-critical
evaluations.
   Disclosing such reports would have a chilling effect on a
company's efforts to be candid about its operations, Mobil argued.
   But U.S. District Judge Harold A. Ackerman, ruling in favor of
The Associated Press and a former Mobil employee suing over his
firing, said the public's right to know was paramount.
   ``Public access to civil judicial proceedings is of vast
importance,'' Ackerman said. Such access ensures justice and
contributes to the public's understanding of government and the
legal system, he said.
   Ackerman dismissed the company's argument that its candor would
be chilled if the public were able to see self-criticism. He also
noted that Mobil didn't object to disclosure of the documents until
Ackerman ruled Dec. 11 that the case should be heard by a jury.
   Mobil said it would appeal Ackerman's order to the 3rd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia.
   The judge also said he was baffled by Mobil attorney Richard
Reibstein's efforts to keep the documents from coming to light and
to keep the news media from covering the case.
   Ackerman on Friday admitted the AP into the courtroom over
Mobil's objections.
   Valcar Bowman Jr. claims he was fired as Mobil Chemical Co.'s
environmental affairs manager for refusing to go along with changes
ordered by company lawyers in the reports.
   He claims revisions were imposed to minimize pollution problems.
   Mobil says the changes were innocuous and that it was committed
to environmentally sound practices. Mobil says that Bowman, 47, of
Riverdale, Ga., was let go in an economic cutback.
   Bowman had worked at the division's Princeton, N.J. office.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Overextended consumers and a slowing economy
could combine like cheap-spiked eggnog to give many retailers a
hangover from the last Christmas season of an extravagant decade.
   From the swank gauntlet of perfume counters at cash-starved
Bloomingdale's to the kiddie departments at K mart, retailers this
past week were hoping that the most crucial days of the year would
not leave them holding vast quantities of unsold merchandise.
   Storeowners will take awhile to assess the final days before
Christmas. Historically they have been the busiest and in many
cases have helped merchants finish the year profitably. A few store
chains already say they've done well.
   But the general tone of this shopping season has been troubling,
with some big retailers trying to fend off bankruptcy and most
struggling to eke out slim sales increases over last year.
   Similar spirits were haunting other sectors of the economy
during the week. The big automakers said they would have to lay off
thousands of workers next month because of slow sales.
   Northeast banks were taking urgent steps to protect themselves
from a rapidly weakening real estate market into which they've
loaned billions of dollars.
   The real estate woes even touched off a sudden drop in the stock
market on Monday.
   The pressure on the retailers has been starkly evident on the
streets of New York _ in the racks of sale items at B. Altman &amp;
Co., the once classy Manhattan department store that is going out
of business because parent company L.J. Hooker is in bankruptcy
court, overwhelmed by creditor claims.
   It's been evident in the heavy discounting at Bloomingdale's and
other department stores owned by another retailing company bobbing
in debts, Campeau Corp., which warned that its stores might default
on their loans and might run to bankruptcy court as well.
   The pressure on Campeau intensified earlier in the week when a
leading apparel supplier and two key lenders in the retailing
industry curbed business dealings with the company for fear they
wouldn't get paid.
   To a large extent, Campeau's problems are rooted in one of the
leading causes of economic growth and consumer spending of the
1980s _ the rapid accumulation of debt.
   Campeau relied on debt for its $6.6 billion purchase of
Bloomingdale's parent, Federated Department Stores, in 1988.
   Consumers wooed by the enticements of buying with borrowed money
nearly doubled the number of credit cards in in the 1980s and
racked up a total debt of more than $700 billion.
   Debt wasn't the only deterrent to hitting the malls this past
week. Nature was a co-conspirator in the retailing industry's
troubled season, plunging much of the country into record cold that
discouraged shoppers from leaving home.
   Perhaps the largest lump of coal lobbed at a retailer came from
New York State's consumer-activist attorney general, Robert Abrams,
who sued Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. for what he called its phony policy of
low prices.
   The nation's leading department store chain, which has been
struggling in recent months to find the right recipe to compete
with aggressive lower-priced rivals like K mart and Wal-Mart
stores, said it was shocked by Abrams' accusations of false
advertising and would fight to clear its name in court.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The Commerce Department said third-quarter economic growth was
revised upward to 3 percent from 2.7 percent; a Commerce survey
showed businesses plan to increase capital spending next year
despite forecasts of a slowdown; and orders for durable goods
increased sharply in November.
   _Eastern Airlines shrank and American Airlines swelled in
another repositioning that reflected the consolidation of their
industry. American bought Latin American routes and other assets
from Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. for $471 million.
   _A well-known takeover speculator convicted of stock
manipulation was sentenced to three years' probation and a $250,000
fine, the lightest punishment doled out so far in the series of
prosecutions stemming from the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal.
Salim B. Lewis, who had pleaded guilty to stock manipulation, was
ordered to spend the probation helping drug addicts.

<TEXT>
   Liz Claiborne Inc., a top women's apparel maker,
was the most profitable public firm in the United States during the
1980s, according to a survey by Forbes magazine.
   Liz Claiborne had an average 51.8 percent return on equity
during the nine years since it went public, placing it ahead of the
second most profitable firm, Rollins Inc., a pest control and alarm
system firm, which had an average return on equity of 47.2 percent,
Forbes said in its Jan. 8 issue.
   In compiling its rankings, Forbes said it considered only firms
for which at least eight years' worth of financial data was
available. The magazine said it evaluated 1,150 U.S. companies in
20 industries.
   To be considered for Forbes' rankings, a company must have
revenue of at least $400 million, or in the case of banks and
electric utilities, $800 million. Biotechnology firms do not have
to meet the minimum revenue requirement.
   Return on equity is a measure of corporate profitability
expressed as a percentage of a company's net worth.
   Forbes ranked the wholesaler Price Co. third with an average
return of 40.5 percent, while the apparel retailer Limited Inc. was
No. 4 with an average return of 39.9 percent and the publisher
Commerce Clearing House Inc. ranked fifth with a 39.7 percent
return.
   Cereal maker Kellogg Co. was No. 6 was a return of 38.9 percent,
General Motors Corp.'s EDS subsidiary ranked seventh with a return
of 37.9 percent, Highland Superstores Inc. was eighth with 37.3
percent, Student Loan Marketing Association was listed ninth with
37.1 percent, and Apple Computer Inc. ranked 10th with 36.6 percent.
   The median return on equity for the entire survey was 14.3
percent, Forbes said.
   Forbes noted that a company's average return on equity during
the decade may not necessarily be a good indicator of how well the
company has fared most recently. For example, Apple Computer had a
36.6 percent average return during the decade, but in the past 12
months has enjoyed a return of 43.2 percent.
   The magazine also pointed out that special dividends paid out
during a corporate restructuring could distort a firm's results.
   The most profitable industry group during the 1980s was the
health industry, Forbes said. The 39 companies that comprise the
industry according to the magazine's rankings had a median average
return on equity of 18.7 percent.
   The food, drink and tobacco industry was second, with a median
average return of 18.4 percent; No. 3 was entertainment and
information, with a return of 17.3 percent; business services and
supplies was fourth with 16.7 percent; and retailing ranked fifth
with 16.7 percent.
   The No. 6 industry was aerospace and defense, with a return of
15.7 percent; consumer nondurables ranked seventh with 15.2
percent; No. 8 was chemicals with 15 percent; insurance was ninth
with 14.4 percent; and financial services was 10th with 14.3
percent.
   No. 1 Liz Claiborne is based in New York, the home city for the
most industry group leaders in the Forbes rankings. Other industry
group leaders included Exxon Corp. among international oil firms,
Bankers Trust Co. among multinational banking companies, CBS Inc.
in the broadcasting industry, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. among retailers
and Lockheed Corp. among aerospace and defense firms.
   While looking back over the 1980s, Forbes also looked ahead to
the 1990s, and selected 20 firms that it said were best positioned
for the coming decade. They included Boeing Co., Kelly Services
Inc., Emerson Electric Co., Dow Chemical Co., Apple Computer,
Ryland Group Inc., General Motors, Johnson &amp; Johnson, PacifiCorp,
Consolidated Natural Gas Co., Walt Disney Co., BankAmerica Corp.,
Sysco Corp., International Paper Co., Humana Inc., Geico Corp.,
Lafarge Corp., Wal-Mart, Norfolk Southern Corp. and AMR Corp.

<HEAD>Fed Remained Open To Lower Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve policy makers decided not to
change monetary policy at their late fall meeting but left open the
possibility of lower interest rates if economic events dictated,
according to minutes released Friday.
   ``While current indicators of economic activity suggested a
somewhat weaker expansion, most of the members agreed that a steady
policy course was desirable at this point, especially in light of
the stimulus provided by recent easing actions,'' said the minutes
of the Nov. 14 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.
   Most of the policy makers agreed, however, ``some further easing
might be needed if the incoming information on business activity
suggested more softening than most members currently expected.''
   The Fed permitted short-term interest rates to drop a quarter of
a percentage point earlier this week to 8.25 percent. It was the
first decrease since Nov. 7 when the central bank also permitted
the federal funds rate to decline a quarter of a percentage point.
   Manipulation of this rate, the interest rate that banks charge
each other for overnight loans, is the primary lever the Fed uses
to control short-term interest rates. It has used this lever
several times since last June, when it began relaxing its grip on
credit to slow inflation.
   The initial decision to keep policy unchanged was reached on a
10-1 vote of the open market committee, composed of Fed governors
in Washington and five of the 12 Fed regional bank presidents.
   Gov. Martha Seeger cast the dissenting vote, contending a
further easing was needed in view of persisting weakness in the
manufacturing sector, particularly automobiles, and a likely
softening in construction and capital expenditures.
   The committee met again Monday and Tuesday, but minutes of that
meeting will not be released until next month. The committee
gathers in secret eight times a year to formulate monetary policy
and confers by telephone as needed.
   In its review of economic conditions last month, it found that
the economy continued to expand, ``though unevenly and at a
somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year.
   ``While the service-producing sector appeared to be growing
moderately, manufacturing had been weak, owing to sluggish demand
and to strikes and other disruptions to production,'' the minutes
said. ``Price increases had been smaller since midyear, but there
had been no abatement of wage inflation.''
   Non-farm employment grew appreciably in October, it said, but
slower than in previous months.
   ``Widespread job gains were apparent in the service-producing
sector, but manufacturing payrolls declined further as a result of
continued weakness in motor vehicles and other durable goods
industries,'' the report said.
   The minutes also showed the Fed staff expected the economy was
likely to grow at a slower pace over the next several quarters.

<HEAD>Columbia Pictures Moves Tri-Star Pictures Ad Account to McCann-Erickson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. said Friday
that it had decided to put McCann-Erickson Worldwide in charge of
placing domestic advertising for both its Columbia Pictures and
Tri-Star Pictures movies.
   The decision could mean an extra $70 million to $75 million in
annual billings for the giant New York-based agency, which had
previously held the assignment only for Columbia Pictures ads.
   The loser is AC&amp;R Advertising, a unit of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co.
PLC, which had been responsible for placing the Tri-State Pictures
advertising.
   Among Tri-Star's recent films have been ``Steel Magnolias'' and
``Look Who's Talking,'' while Columbia's recent films have included
``When Harry Met Sally ...'' and ``Ghostbusters II.''
   Calls were placed to both agencies, but went unanswered Friday
afternoon. Many businesses closed early Friday in advance of the
three-day Christmas holiday weekend.
   The move comes a month after Columbia Pictures Entertainment was
acquired by Japan's Sony Corp. in a $3.4 billion buyout, but a
Columbia spokesman who asked not to be identified said the decision
was unrelated to the buyout.
   The Columbia and Tri-Star studios merged their marketing
departments last March and had reportedly been reviewing ad agency
assignments for several months.
   In response to inquiries, the Columbia Pictures spokesman in
Burbank, Calif., said the decision to consolidate North American
media placement for the two studios was the next step in the merger
of the marketing departments.
   The spokesman declined to disclose how much the studios spend on
advertising their films.
   But industry sources said that annual spending came to between
$140 million and $150 million this year evenly divided between the
two studios.
   McCann-Erickson, whose total U.S. billings amounted to $1.3
billion in 1988, has handled media placement for Columbia Pictures
for about two years.
   Among its other clients are Coca-Cola Co.'s soft drinks, General
Motors Corp.'s Buick division, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s
business-to-business advertising and Exxon Corp.'s gasoline and
motor oil products.
   It recently won a $25 million assignment for Taster's Choice
coffee from Nestle, a $25 million job for unspecified new products
from RJR Nabisco and a $10 million account for Fidelity Investments.
   AC&amp;R Advertising had U.S. billings of $355.6 million in 1988.
Its clients include Austin Rover of North America, Fosters Lager
Beer and Regency Cruises.

<HEAD>Bank of New England Rescinds Stock Dividend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of New England Corp., which expects heavy
losses due to bad real estate loans, on Friday rescinded a common
stock dividend it had declared last month.
   The announcement came one week after Bank of New England said it
would boost its loan reserves above $1 billion and that it expected
a ``substantial'' loss for the year.
   At the time, the bank also said it was exploring the sale or
merger of its assets and was considering rescinding a 34 cents per
share dividend for the fourth quarter ending Dec. 31.
   In a brief statement late Friday, the bank said its board of
directors had agreed to rescind the dividend.
   Analysts said such action is highly unusual but reflects the
serious trouble Bank of New England faces due to a real estate
slump that has battered many of the region's banks.
   ``We're looking at a real estate market that is deteriorating
very rapidly and very dramatically, and Bank of New England is a
major real estate player,'' said James Moynihan, senior vice
president of Advest Inc. in Boston.
   While 28 banks in New England have eliminated or cut dividends
since April, Moynihan said: ``I've never seen a cash dividend
declared, then rescinded.''
   Bank of New England, the region's second largest bank, has come
under increased scrutiny by regulators, and analysts predict
changes could be forthcoming in the company's management. The bank
last week reassigned a senior executive overseeing its real estate
group.
   Moynihan also said the possibility is growing the bank could be
acquired by an another bank or outside investor.
   ``One of the things you have to address is customer
confidence,'' he said, noting the bank could have trouble restoring
credibility without outside help.

<HEAD>Meredith-Burda to be Sold for About $570 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co., the leading
commercial printer in North America, agreed Friday to buy the
Meredith-Burda printing business jointly owned by Meredith Corp.
and the Burda family of West Germany in a deal valued at about $570
million.
   Meredith, a Fortune 500 company that publishes Better Homes and
Gardens magazine and also has interests in television stations and
real estate, said it would use its share of the proceeds to
strengthen and expand its core businesses.
   ``It's a continuation of a trend that's been going on for some
time. The industry is consolidating,'' said Robert A. Dunlap, who
follows Donnelley for the New York Securities firm of Brown
Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.
   Analysts said the deal should benefit both companies.
   On the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Donnelley rose 87{ cents
to finish at $48.75 a share and Meredith jumped $3.37{ to $35.25 a
share.
   Donnelley said it would pay $487.5 million in cash, to be
divided between Meredith, and Franz and Frieder Burda of West
Germany. It also agreed to assume $80 million in Meredith-Burda
debt.
   The deal, subject to government antitrust review, is expected to
be closed early in 1990, the companies said. Jack Rehm, the
president of Meredith, said he anticipated no objections on grounds
of restraint of trade.
   Donnelley, based in Chicago, accounts for an estimated 6.4
percent of the $50 billion U.S. commercial printing market and
should expand its share to about 7 percent through the acquisition,
Dunlap said.
   Donnelley prints and binds many national publications, including
Time, Newsweek, TV Guide and Business Week. It also prints
telephone books, encyclopedias and school and religious books and
has about 25,000 employees at nearly 100 factories and offices in
the United States, Britain, Ireland, the Caribbean and Asia.
   In 1988, Donnelley earned $205.3 million on sales of almost $2.9
billion.
   Meredith-Burda, formed in 1969, generated $456.7 million in the
fiscal year ended June 30 and employs 3,205 people nationwide,
including about 1,100 in Des Moines. It has printing plants in Des
Moines; Newton, N.C.; Lynchburg, Va.; and Casa Grande, Ariz. Its
photo preparation centers are in Lynchburg and at Hickory and
Greensboro, N.C.
   Meredith-Burda also owns 40 percent of plants in Lynchburg and
at Greenfield, Iowa, where Siegwerk Inc. manufactures ink.
   Donnelley spokesman James Ratcliffe said there are no immediate
plans for cutbacks, although some sales and administrative
positions at Meredith-Burda may be eliminated in the future if they
overlap with Donnelley operations.
   ``We did not buy this to dismantle anything,'' Ratcliffe said in
a telephone interview.
   Meredith, which earned $33.2 million on revenue of $792 million
in the latest fiscal year, already had a working relationship with
Donnelley, which prints Meredith's Ladies' Home Journal and SAIL
magazines and several Meredith books. Rehm said Donnelley would be
printing other Meredith publications, the bulk of them at the Des
Moines plant.
   Rehm said Meredith officials began considering the sale of the
capital-intensive printing business early in 1989 and soon began
discussions with Donnelley.
   ``It's a solid financial decision for our stockholders,
employees, customers and communities,'' Rehm said. ``Our long-term
goal and our vision for Meredith Corporation is to create growth
through acquisitions and new product development. With this
decision, we can focus our energy, our skills and our capital
resources on our core businesses.''
   Rehm said Meredith was receiving about twice the amount it had
been carrying on its books as the value of the operation.
   He told reporters that no decisions had been made on how to
spend the money, which will be divided about evenly between
Meredith and the Burdas. But he noted that acquisition
opportunities in the media business tended to surface at a moment's
notice.
   ``If a television station came up in the foreseeable future and
if we thought it was a good fit at the right price, we'd probably
look at it,'' Rehm said.
   He also said the company was exploring launching new magazines
as well as acquiring existing publications.
   ``I think everybody makes out on this deal,'' Dunlap said.
   Dunlap said Meredith gets out of a business that has had a low
return on investment and gets some needed cash for its other
operations. He said Donnelley gets plants that fill voids in its
operations.
   John Walter, chairman and president of Donnelley, said: ``The
acquisition of Meredith-Burda by Donnelley is an outstanding
opportunity for both parties. Meredith-Burda is a strong,
high-quality printer with an excellent customer base and a leading
market reputation. The fit with Donnelley's existing facilities is
remarkably good.''
   Cornelius Sewell, who follows the printing business for Argus
Research in New York, called Donnelley a consistent performer.
   Sewell said Donnelley is so broad-based that it can avoid the
damage that cyclical swings cause smaller printing operations.
   ``They're pretty smart guys,'' he said.

   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. has agreed to pay a $250,000
fine to the Chicago Board of Trade for failing to pay fees for
exchange services, the exchange said Friday.
   The Board of Trade also announced a $50,000 fine levied against
Fossett Corp., a futures trading firm, and a 30-day suspension and
$50,000 fine for an associate member of the exchange who
overstepped his privileges.
   Merrill Lynch neither admitted nor denied the exchange's
allegations, the Board of Trade said. The company agreed to pay
certain fees and interest charges in addition to the fine.
   Fossett was charged by an exchange committee with failing to
maintain adequate capital, an allegation the company neither
admitted nor denied. In addition to the fine, the company agreed to
take corrective measures to ensure against future violations of
minimum capital requirements.
   The exchange's board of directors found that Anthony Stack, an
associate member of the Board of Trade, allowed his agents or
employees to act as brokers and handle orders outside the scope of
his associate member privileges.
   The board also concluded Stack had helped a non-member gain
admission to and make transactions on the exchange floor.

   A federal judge Friday rejected a request
by Georgia-Pacific Corp. to move up a meeting of Great Northern
Nekoosa Corp. shareholders to consider a $3.8 billion takeover
offer.
   U.S. District Judge Gene Carter said he did not want to cut off
debate prematurely in the merger battle and rejected
Georgia-Pacific's motion for a temporary restraining order and
preliminary injunction.
   ``This discussion is of great concern to the public, and the
public's interest as well as that of the shareholders is served by
letting the discussion mature,'' Carter said.
   ``... harm may accrue to Great Northern and the public if the
deal is rushed to completion and it is then determined that the
newly formed corporation is in violation of the antitrust laws,''
the judge said.
   Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific asked Carter on Thursday to move
the Great Northern shareholders meeting from March 20 to within 30
days, saying it wants shareholders to have a quick say in the rival
paper maker's merger offer.
   Georgia-Pacific also sought to force Norwalk, Conn.-based Great
Northern to provide it and the court with 72 hours notice of any
financial restructuring that could make the $63-a-share tender
offer less attractive.
   Great Northern already has agreed to provide Georgia-Pacific
with information on any changes it makes, and Georgia-Pacific could
challenge any changes if it thinks they are improper, Carter's
ruling said.
   Georgia-Pacific on Friday extended its offer through Jan. 5 and
said 73 percent of Great Northern's shares had been tendered. It
said it was disappointed with the ruling.
   Great Northern spokesman Stephen Hill called ruling
``wonderful.''
   Carter has not yet ruled on another Georgia-Pacific motion
seeking to set aside part of the ``poison pill'' provisions in
Great Northern's bylaws intended to thwart a hostile takeover.
   Hill said the deal would violate antitrust laws, an issue to be
decided in a federal trial scheduled to begin Wednesday in
Bridgeport, Conn., in a lawsuit brought by Great Northern.
   The ruling Friday came in motions filed in a separate lawsuit
challenging Great Northern's poison pill and Maine's antitakeover
law.
   The Federal Trade Commission in Washington had faced a Thursday
deadline for deciding whether it believed the proposed merger would
run afoul of antitrust laws, but an FTC spokeswoman said no
announcement was planned.
   Georgia-Pacific said the deadline passed without any action by
the FTC, ``satisfying one of the material conditions to
Georgia-Pacific's offer.''

   Orders to U.S. factories for durable goods
posted a 5.1 percent gain in November, the sharpest increase in a
year, the government said. Analysts said the report suggested the
economy can avoid a recession.
   The Commerce Department said Friday that orders for durable
goods _ costly items expected to last at least three years _
increased to a seasonally adjusted $130.7 billion last month after
dropping 0.7 percent in October and 1.2 percent in September.
   The gain in orders was spread through all categories and was the
largest since a 7.4 percent jump last December. It averted the
first three-month decline since 1986.

   Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied
Stores Corp. said Friday they have received notices that the
companies failed to comply with reporting requirements under their
bank credit agreements.
   The notices, which were dated Thursday, said reports must be
made within 10 days or the loans would be considered to be in
default, the two Campeau Corp. divisions said.
   Federated and Allied said they reported in quarterly filings on
Oct. 28 that they were unable to determine whether they were
solvent, although they also could not determine if they were
insolvent.
   In separate but identical statements, Federated and Allied said:
``The company believes it is in full compliance with its reporting
obligations under its credit agreement, and it has advised the
lender that it believes the lender's assertion of a default on such
basis is wholly without merit.''
   Trading in Campeau stock was halted Friday at the Toronto Stock
Exchange. Campeau has been publicly foundering in financial
difficulties since September, when it announced that its cash flow
might not be adequate to meet its cash needs in the coming months.
   At that time it received $250 million in new financing from
Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. Bloomingdale's, Campeau's prize
retail chain, was put up for sale and Robert Campeau was forced to
give up control of the company he founded.
   About a half dozen bidders reportedly are considering buying the
17-store Bloomingdale's chain. Among those who have expressed
interest are JMB Realty Corp., a shopping mall developer; Japan's
Tokyu Department Store Co.; real estate developer Donald Trump; a
group led by Joseph Brooks, chairman of the Ann Taylor store chain;
and a group led by Bloomingdale's Chairman Marvin Traub.
   A sixth bidder, possibly Japanese, also is expected to take part
in the second round of bidding.
   Campeau has said it hopes to complete the sale by February.
   Negotiations have been under way for the past week between
Campeau's restructuring committee, chaired by Olympia &amp; York
representative Lionel Dodd, and the company's creditors to
restructure much of its $10 billion debt.
   After Campeau's third-quarter results were released last week,
the company said its U.S. retail operations might be forced to file
for protection from creditors under U.S. bankruptcy law because
cash flow doesn't appear adequate to cover debt payments.
   Retail analyst Karen Sach at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. in New York
said there was speculation that Campeau would soon announce that it
wants to sell other retailers besides Bloomingdale's or that it had
decided not to sell Bloomingdale's.
   Campeau's stores around the United States include Abraham &amp;
Straus, Burdines, Lazarus, Rich's, The Bon Marche, Jordan Marsh,
Maas Brothers and Stern's.
   Although sales and operating profits are up from last year,
financing costs have increased so much that Campeau lost $390
million in the first nine months of the year, compared with a loss
of $24 million for the same period last year.

<HEAD>Braniff Moves to Install New Chief Executive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc. asked a federal bankruptcy
judge Friday to install an interim chief executive officer, only a
day after the struggling carrier's top two executives resigned.
   David Murchison, 41, who himself stepped down last month as
Braniff's vice president, general counsel and secretary, was
recommended for the top job by both creditors and management, said
Braniff spokeswoman Ann Cook.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge C. Timothy Corcoran in Orlando will review
the recommendation and make the final decision. He has not set a
date to consider the motion.
   ``Braniff has a very strong mid-level management that is capable
of running the company until the judge makes his decision,'' Ms.
Cook said.
   Murchison was a vice president with Piedmont Aviation for three
years before joining Braniff in 1988. The plan is for him initally
to serve as an interim chief executive and he may take over the job
permanently, Ms. Cook said.
   The management changes come at a time when the carrier is
struggling through bankruptcy proceedings, and both creditors and
employees are calling for new management.
   Orlando-based Braniff, which filed for Chapter 11 protection
Sept. 28, has only 275 of its 4,800 pre-filing workers and has
trimmed its schedule to just charter flights.
   ``We don't want liquidation,'' said Tom Burnette, chairman of
the Teamsters union's Braniff committee. ``We want to preserve some
jobs, if there's a possibility at all.''
   William McGee, Braniff's chief executive officer, and W. Howard
Mackinnon, chief financial officer, submitted their resignations
Thursday of their own accord, Ms. Cook said.
   ``They simply feel the company has reached the point where their
services are no longer needed, and they left to pursue other
interests,'' Ms. Cook said.
   The resignations came the same day Braniff announced a drop in
earnings. For the third quarter ended Oct. 31, Braniff showed a net
loss of $134.9 million, compared with a loss of $7.8 million for
the same period in 1988.
   Braniff also announced it's giving up its rights to five leased
Airbus jets rather than go to court over the aircraft.
   Ireland's GPA Group Ltd. had sued Braniff for the five jets
because the airline owed $3 million in lease payments. Braniff said
the Airbuses are being returned as a ``gesture of good faith.''
   Scott Hamilton, editor of the Commercial Aviation Report in
Dallas, said Braniff had little hope of keeping the planes once GPA
sued.
   ``Yes, Braniff could have fought tooth and nail, but to what
end?'' he said. ``They would have lost the airplanes, and meanwhile
they would have lost the legal fees.''
   The return of five Airbuses does not affect Braniff's agreement
to lease and purchase another 45 jets, according to a statement
issued jointly by Braniff and GPA. The undelivered Airbuses are the
airline's chief asset.
   Braniff, whch has been sustaining itself recently by selling off
assets, is trying to find a customer for the lease agreements and
purchase options.
   Braniff lost $175.7 million in the first nine months of its
fiscal year on revenue of $391.8 million. The $134.9 million
quarterly loss is equivalent to $9.15 a share and includes a $64
million writeoff for intangible value the company lost when it
filed for bankruptcy protection, plus $22.4 million related to the
bankruptcy filing.

<TEXT>
   Resorts International filed a
reorganization plan in bankruptcy court Friday that seeks to shed
about two-thirds of its $912 million in debt.
   Analysts said the plan, which formalizes a bankruptcy petition
filed Nov. 13 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Camden, N.J., will buy
the company badly needed time to get its finances in order.
   The plan seeks the court's approval of company owner Merv
Griffin's proposal to swap 78 percent of his Resorts stock for
about $600 million of the outstanding debt, said company spokesman
Rob Shepardson.
   In addition to the approval of the bankruptcy court, the plan
requires the approval of half the Resorts bondholders, New Jersey's
Casino Contol Commission and the government of the Bahamas, where
Resorts owns a casino.
   Shephardson said the companies would likely mail proxies in late
January to bondholders.
   Resorts' casinos in Atlantic City and the Bahamas will not be
affected by the plan, Shepardson said.
   In August, Resorts suspended interest payments on its
outstanding bonds, which Shepardson estimated at $912 million. In
September, the company announced a restructuring plan aimed at
preventing a bankruptcy filing.
   Bondholders attacked the plan and split into two groups, one
holding subordinated unsecured debt and the other with senior
secured debt.
   The plan filed Friday would give senior secured bondholders
$187.5 million in new notes with a 4-year term, bearing interest of
6 percent in the first year, 9 percent in the second, 12 percent in
the third and 15 percent in the fourth. Those bondholders also
would receive 2.5 percent of Griffin's shares.
   Holders of Resorts' highest paying bonds, 16| percent, would
receive 32.4 percent of the shares. The remaining bondholders would
get 43.1 percent of the company stock.
   The deal would leave Griffin as chairman of a newly constituted
six-person board of directors.
   The plan also would require Griffin to invest a total of $30
million in the company and fund a $5 million kitty for any legal
action against billionaire developer Donald J. Trump.
   Trump had been Resorts chairman and controlling shareholder
before Griffin bought the company in November 1988. As part of the
deal between the two, Trump received the unfinished Taj Mahal
casino in Atlantic City for $230 million, less than half the $500
million Resorts poured into construction.
   Attorneys for some bondholder groups say they may sue Trump for
``fraudulent conveyance.'' Trump has said Griffin bears
responsibility for the deal.
   Analysts have said Griffin paid too much for the casino and
weighed down his purchase with too much debt, which Shepardson
estimated at $912 million.
   But analysts said Friday that Griffin's plan may yet save the
company.
   ``I think it's the only alternative,'' said John Uphoff, a
casino analyst for Raymond James &amp; Associates in St. Petersburg,
Fla.
   He said the scheduled spring opening of the massive Taj Mahal
next door may bring in new customers for Resorts.
   ``The opening of the Taj will give them some extra business that
they desperately need,'' Uphoff said.
   Daniel R. Lee, an analyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which
issued $325 million in bonds for the transaction, said the Taj
Mahal is a ``plus and a minus.''
   ``It will be a big competitor sitting on Resorts' doorstep,'' he
said. ``But it's also going to bring in a lot of business.''
   The casino's most recent financial results showed a $34.9
million net loss for the third quarter.
   Resorts, which was the first casino to open on Atlantic City's
Boardwalk in May 1978, posted a ``win'' total for November of $17.1
million, an 8.1 percent decrease from the $18.4 million of November
1988.
   Yearly figures show a win of $214.9 million, 9.4 percent lower
than the $228.5 million for the first 11 months of 1988.

<HEAD>Eastern Airlines Reducing Schedule</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines, which just sold its Latin
American routes, also is cutting back some domestic flights, the
company said Friday.
   In the first announced reduction of its flight schedule since
Eastern began rebuilding from a crippling strike, the carrier said
it will reduce daily flights from 830 to 803 on Jan. 31.
   Among the reductions are cuts in nonstop service from Miami to
Boston, Philadelphia, Orlando, Tampa and several Caribbean cities.
That will reduce Eastern's departures from its Miami home base from
78 to 51, with deeper cuts ahead next year when the sale of Latin
American routes to American Airlines is completed.
   In a message to employees this week, Eastern said ``some
furloughs may be necessary as we reduce operations.''
   ``It's a reflection of the revamping we're in the process of
doing on the current operation, which is going to involve a return
to the basics of the business plan that was presented in April,''
company spokesman Robin Matell said Friday. ``We're trying to
develop the best possible schedule that opens the most potential
for profitability.''
   Hobbled by the strike of its three unions that began March 4,
Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection five days later
and in April said it would rebuild as a carrier about two-thirds
its pre-strike size. Negotiations to sell its Central and South
American routes to rival American stalled in August, and Eastern
officials said they would keep that service and build back to 90
percent of Eastern's pre-strike size.
   However, projected cash shortfalls displeased some Eastern
creditors, and the company and its parent Texas Air Corp. this week
sold the Latin routes and other assets to American.
   Eastern will continue operating the routes until the deal
obtains approval from the Department of Transportation and U.S.
bankruptcy court, expected to take as much as six months.
   However, the carrier is going ahead with other adjustments back
to the plan for operations two-thirds that of its pre-strike size,
Matell said.
   Eastern had more than 30,000 employees and 1,040 daily flights
before the strike.
   The company has about 20,000 workers, mostly non-union, now.
Matell said no layoffs of pilots, flight attendants or mechanics
are anticipated.
   American, the nation's largest airline, has said it will absorb
Eastern's employees in Latin America when it takes over the routes.
   Officials of the Machinists union, the lone union still striking
against Eastern, said Eastern's planes are flying at less than half
capacity, despite the carrier's sharp fare discounting in hopes of
luring back passengers. Matell said Eastern's flights have been at
about 50 percent for the first half of December, but were picking
up for the holidays.
   At Machinists Local 702, strikers and their families gathered
Friday evening for a Christmas party, with Santa Claus handing out
gifts donated from the AFL-CIO and several other national unions,
local President Frank Ortis said.
   ``We're going to have a happy Christmas after all, despite the
Scrooge (Chairman) Frank Lorenzo,'' Ortis said.

<HEAD>Herbert Hunt Bankruptcy Concludes</HEAD>

   A chapter in the turbulent financial saga of the
Hunt brothers _ once among the richest men in the world _ drew to a
close this week as William Herbert Hunt relinquished his estate to
a liquidating trustee.
   Hunt's resolution of one of the biggest personal bankruptcies in
history came on the heels of his brother Nelson Bunker Hunt's
settlement last week.
   It brings an end to the more than $3 billion fortune received
from their father, famed oil wildcatter H.L. Hunt.
   Both brothers will formally emerge from bankruptcy in early
January.
   ``I don't plan to sit on my fanny,'' Herbert Hunt said when
asked about his plans.
   On Thursday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson signed the
order that will transfer the fallen oilman's estate to a
liquidating trust within 10 days. Herbert Hunt's $169 million
estate will be liquidated to pay creditors over the next six years,
absolving him of nearly $1 billion in debt.
   Missing from Thursday's hearing were the television cameras,
crowds or fanfare that dominated the end of Bunker Hunt's
bankruptcy case.
   ``Bunker got much more attention because he is much more
interesting, but this was the harder of the two cases to resolve,''
said Hugh Ray, attorney for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., a
creditor in both bankruptcies. He noted that Herbert's assets are
less liquid.
   ``Bunker had a lot more cash,'' he said.
   Ray said it was ``miraculous'' to have two such sizable
bankruptcy cases resolved within 15 months.
   Under the plan confirmed Thursday, Herbert will be stripped of
his assets, which are concentrated heavily in depressed Texas and
Arizona real estate. His largest holding is a $50.5 million
interest in a 4,000-acre Phoenix housing development.
   Herbert will lose his $400,000 salary, but he will keep his
Cadillac, $1.2 million Dallas mansion, personal effects totaling
$50,000 and a 50 percent interest in non-producing oil and natural
gas properties.
   In addition, if Hunt can enhance the selling price of his
Byzantine coins and bronze statues, he will receive a portion of
those proceeds. Herbert's children will be given a chance to buy
his one-half interest in his Vail, Colo., home as well as his wife
Nancy's English pottery collection.
   Seventy percent of Herbert's holdings will go to the Internal
Revenue Service and the other 30 percent will be divided among the
remaining creditors, including Manufacturers Hanover and Minpeco
SA, a Peruvian mining company.
   In addition, the IRS will be paid $75 million out of future
gifts, income and inheritances.
   Herbert's financial problems began in 1980 when he and his
brother lost $1.5 billion speculating in the silver futures
markets. The silver losses were compounded by falling real estate
prices and the collapse of the oil market.
   The brothers filed for bankruptcy protection in September 1988,
shortly after a New York jury found the Hunts had conspired to
corner the silver market.

   A group of powerful investors, including oil
fortune heir Gordon P. Getty, increased its stake Friday in Avon
Products Inc. to 8.7 percent and extended its credit agreement with
several banks.
   Chartwell Associates, a limited partnership, said in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it paid $14.5
million to purchase 401,000 more shares of Avon common stock
between Dec. 1 and last Tuesday.
   The stock, purchased for between $35.25 and $36.62{ per share,
increased Chartwell's holdings to 4.9 million shares for a total of
$166.3 million.
   The SEC filing said the partnership has extended its credit
agreement so it can continue borrowing until Jan. 31, 1990.
   Avon, a New York-based cosmetics company, has twice rejected
takeover proposals earlier this year and fended off takeover
feelers from Dallas-based Mary Kay Corp., the privately held parent
of door-to-door marketer Mary Kay Cosmetics.
   A subsidiary of Mary Kay is among the general partners of
Chartwell, which also include the Gordon P. Getty Family Trust and
the Fisher real estate family of New York.

<HEAD>Prison to Probation: Disparity Marks Wall Street Punishments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ivan Boesky gets three years in prison for
masterminding an unprecedented insider trading swindle. Fraud-mate
Boyd Jefferies squeals on others and is freed in appreciation.
   Admitted stock manipulator Salim B. Lewis will work as an
executive in a drug rehabilitation clinic after pleading guilty;
stock parker Paul A. Bilzerian will go to prison after a jury
conviction.
   As the number of cases resolved in the government's Wall Street
fraud investigation grows, one thing is clear: Disparity, not
clarity, has been the main characteristic of punishments.
   Whether ordering prison time or probation, federal judges in
Manhattan who have meted out sentences in the crackdown have
decried financial swindling and said they were ``sending a
message'' to Wall Street.
   But the message has varied, and judges, defense lawyers and
legal experts appear troubled over whether securities professionals
who plead guilty or are found guilty by juries should go to prison
at all.
   ``You are a perfect example of the serious burdens placed upon a
court in trying to deal with this kind of conduct,'' U.S. District
Judge Mary Johnson Lowe told Lewis, a respected trader and former
Securities and Exchange Commission adviser, before sparing him
prison time last week.
   ``You should be sentenced in a way so that your talents will not
be wasted,'' she said. ``Warehousing your body will be a deterrent.
But it will do little to benefit society.''
   Lowe's comments were cheered by lawyers who said the punishment
fit the crime _ an isolated incident of scheming to boost a stock
price.
   But it was the first time a securities felon received only
probation without cooperating with the government. A wide majority
of those who have come before the bench in the last three years
have gone to prison.
   ``Judges will deny it, but there's no doubt that if you plead
guilty the sentence will be lighter than if you go to trial,'' said
Elkan Abramowitz, whose client stockbroker Robert Chestman is
serving a two-year term after an insider trading conviction.
   Jefferies, who collaborated with Boesky, was placed on probation
and fined $250,000. He provided information that led to successful
prosecutions of Bilzerian, Lewis, GAF Corp. and its vice chairman,
James T. Sherwin.
   Bilzerian, a Florida investor, got four years after he was
convicted of making millions by illegally concealing ownership of
stock in takeover targets by temporarily ``parking'' it with
stockbroker Jefferies. Among stock-related offenses, Bilzerian's
term has been the longest.
   The longest overall has been eight years for David Bloom, a
24-year-old aspiring financial adviser who was convicted of mail
and securities fraud for bilking investors of $15 million he spent
on art, fast cars and luxury homes.
   Manhattan U.S. attorney's office records show that of 43
individuals prosecuted for securities-related offenses since 1986,
23 have been sentenced to prison against six placed on probation.
The remaining either were acquitted or are awaiting trial or
sentencing.
   ``You see more sentences of imprisonment now than you did 10 or
15 years ago in white-collar fraud cases,'' said criminal defense
lawyer Alan Kaufman, who has represented several Wall Street
professionals.
   Many defense lawyers believe the benchmark for securities
offenses should be the three years for Boesky, who was accused of
rampant insider trading and cooperated with prosecutors in the case
that has embodied Wall Street's scandals.
   Others say that for first-time violators, straight probation and
community service should be the standard, along with hefty fines
and expulsion from the profession _ punishments they say hurt
financial executives most while replenishing federal coffers.
   ``White-collar criminals should be treated differently,''
Abramowitz said. ``They do not pose a physical threat to society.
(Financial crime) does not grip the city with fear.
   ``It does affect the ethical quality of our society, and to that
extent it is important and should be prosecuted. But the punishment
should be comparable with the crime in that framework.''
   While judges more and more send a message via prison sentences
that white-collar criminals shouldn't get preferential treatment
just because they are predominantly white, male and wealthy,
``warehousing'' a stock manipulator costs taxpayers.
   According to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, it cost $26.60 a day,
or about $9,700 a year, in fiscal 1988 to keep an inmate at a
minimum-security prison camp, where most Wall Street felons are
sent.
   The number of inmates at such facilities _ the lowest security
level in the federal prison system _ was 12,623 as of Dec. 5, up
6.1 percent from 11,898 at end of fiscal 1988 and 18 percent from
10,686 the previous year.
   Off Wall Street, financial scammers increasingly are getting
lengthy prison terms _ hotel queen Leona Helmsley's four years for
tax evasion and televangelist Jim Bakker's 45 years for fraud have
been the most publicized.
   New federal criminal sentencing guidelines threaten to increase
the use of prison even more.
   The guidelines, which apply to crimes committed after Nov. 1,
1987, and as such haven't been used in most of the Wall Street
cases, provide strict sentences for each offense. In white-collar
cases, the length of the term often is determined by the dollar
amount of the fraud.
   Judges have little room to apply discretion based on other
elements, such as whether community service might be more effective
for defendant and society. Lewis, for instance, whose crime
occurred in 1986, would have received a mandatory prison sentence
under the guidelines.
   ``They do not take into consideration the differences in conduct
and people,'' said securities lawyer Gerald Lefcourt. ``They
attempt to make things uniform where it is impossible to do that.''
   According to a U.S. Sentencing Commission study, 57 percent of
criminal tax-law convicts in 1985 received only probation. Under
the guidelines, the figure would have been 3 percent. In fraud
cases, 59 percent got probation; under the guidelines, it would
have been 24 percent.
   ``The guidelines made a deliberate effort to increase the
severity of white-collar sentences and will greatly increase the
frequency of prison sentences,'' said University of Chicago
criminal law professor Albert Alschuler.
   ``You really ought to think about taking the white-collar
offender and reducing him to bankruptcy before you start piling on
prison sentences,'' he said.
   Defense lawyers generally agree incarceration is necessary in
some white-collar cases, but say it's counterproductive and
wasteful to send nonviolent felons into a prison system already
overflowing with hard criminals.
   Lefcourt said: ``The attitude of the country is somehow you can
solve complicated problems in people's condition by just throwing
the book at everybody. I think that's very unfortunate.''

<HEAD>Rio's Most Famous Hotel Sold to American Businessman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN SILVERSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Copacabana Palace Hotel, a Rio
landmark that once hosted European royalty and Hollywood movie
stars but fell on hard times, has been taken over by the American
businessman who restored Europe's Orient Express train.
   ``The Copa,'' on Rio's famous Copacabana Beach, on the South
Atlantic coast, has been declining for more than 20 years. But
James Sherwood has pledged to restore the hotel's glory.
   The new general manager, Philip Carruthers, would not say how
much Sherwood paid in September to buy a controlling interest in
the hotel. Local press estimates ran from $70 million to $100
million. But he said no expense would be spared to modernize and
improve the hotel.
   ``The hotel is considered to be part of the country's heritage,
so the facade won't be touched. But the inside will be completely
modernized, so we can make the place successful again,''
Carruthers, a Brazil-reared Englishman, said.
   Sherwood is chairman of the London-based, $2 billion, Sea
Containers Ltd., a leading producer of shipping containers.
   Sea Containers owns 42 percent of Orient Express Hotels, Inc.,
which will run the Copa. The purchase of the hotel is the first
tourism investment in South America by Sherwood, whose firms
already run hotels in the United States, the Bahamas, Italy,
Scotland, England and Portugal.
   Orient Express Hotels refurbished the famous train of the same
name, which during its heyday in the 1920s ran from Istanbul,
Turkey, to London, crossing the English Channel by ferryboat.
   The train, which suspended service in the early 1970s, resumed
operations in 1983 and now makes a twice-weekly run between London
and Venice.
   ``The Orient Express has been re-established as a luxury form of
transport, fully restored in 1920s style,'' said Carruthers, adding
that Sherwood hopes to do the same with the Copa, once considered
one of the world's 20 best hotels.
   ``Mr. Sherwood has always been keen on the hotel. It's an
imposing building on an extraordinary site, with wonderful black
and white pavement,'' said Sea Containers Ltd. spokeswoman Naida
Stancioff in London. She was referring to the wide mosaic sidewalk
that lines the 2{-mile long Copacabana Beach.
   The Copa, inaugurated in 1923, was the creation of Brazil's
then-president Epitacio Pessoa, who lamented Rio's lack of a
first-class luxury hotel to accommodate prominent visitors with the
same pomp with which he was received in Europe.
   Businessman Octavio Guinle, whose family controlled the Copa
until it was bought by Sherwood, told Pessoa he would construct a
hotel to rival Europe's finest if he could install a casino. At the
time, Rio had no large tourist market and Guinle felt gambling was
necesasary to make the hotel profitable.
   Pessoa agreed. Guinle imported cement from Germany, marble from
Italy, crystals from Czechoslovakia and furniture from France.
   The hotel, designed by architect Joseph Gire, contains 223
rooms, including a huge presidential suite overlooking the ocean,
14 party rooms, a theater and the ``Golden Room'' for special
attractions. The facade, inspired by hotels in Cannes and Nice,
France, is a mix of classical styles.
   The hotel always was more famous for social significance _
people here say there was a time when coming to Rio and not staying
at the Copa was like going to Rome and not seeing the Pope.
   Over the years, Maurice Chevalier, Nat King Cole, Edith Piaf and
Ella Fitzgerald performed in the Golden Room.
   The hotel has welcomed world leaders ranging from Dwight
Eisenhower to Eva Peron, Fidel Castro to the Shah of Iran. Animals
were prohibited in the Copa after Magda Lupesco, paramour of King
Carol I of Romania, kept eight Pekinese in her room and they ate
the drapes.
   The most legendary stories concern movie stars.
   Orson Welles, in a drunken stupor, threw a bed into the swimming
pool from his second-floor window after Delores Del Rio broke off
their romance.
   In 1939, Errol Flynn pranced naked through the halls. Nudity
reared its head again in the early 1960s when Jayne Mansfield
nonchalantly sat topless at poolside and made headlines for a week.
   Other famous guests who have stayed at the Copa include Brigitte
Bardot, Joan Crawford, Clark Gable and Tyrone Power.
   In 1946 President Eurico Dutra outlawed gambling, and the Copa
casino closed. But the hotel continued to reign as queen of Rio's
social life until 1960.
   In that year, the national capital was moved from Rio to the
inland city of Brasilia, and the hotel lost the glamour of putting
up visiting VIPs.
   The real crunch came in the 1970s, when several international
firms opened modern five-star hotels in Copacabana. By the early
1980s the number of Copa employees had been cut by two-thirds, and
the hotel was barely breaking even.
   ``The Copa had been resting on its laurels for years. The owners
were so used to being THE hotel in Rio they felt they no longer had
to compete,'' said Carruthers.
   He said current problems range from leaky plumbing to shoddy
interiors.
   But renovations, set to begin by next April, should be completed
by mid-1991. Carruthers said there are even plans to reopen the
Golden Room and bring back world-class performers.
   ``When the work is completed, the Copa will be the best hotel in
Rio again,'' he said.
