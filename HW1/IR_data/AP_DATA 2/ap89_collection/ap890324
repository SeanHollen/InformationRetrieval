   Joel Steinberg was sentenced Friday to the
maximum 8 1-3 to 25 years in prison for killing his illegally
adopted daughter in a case that riveted national attention on the
problems of domestic violence.
   Steinberg, a disbarred attorney, spoke about the charges for the
first time just before he was sentenced by state Supreme Court
Justice Harold Rothwax in Manhattan on his manslaughter conviction
for the 1987 death of 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg. Rothwax
recommended against parole.
   ``His extraordinary narcissism and self-involvement, his extreme
need to control everyone ... led him to become the instrument of
Lisa's death,'' Rothwax said before passing sentence. ``There is
nothing in the record to mitigate the extreme callousness and
harshness of his conduct.''
   Steinberg denied hitting the girl and said she received
``constant love.''
   ``Those children were not locked in a house of horror,''
Steinberg said of Lisa and the infant boy he also adopted illegally.
   But Assistant District Attorney John McCusker told the court
Lisa's death resulted from Steinberg's ``life of violence,
selfishness and self-gratification at the expense of other people.''
   ``Mr. Steinberg has shown not one ounce of remorse for killing
Elizabeth,'' McCusker said.
   ``I understand the meaning of remorse,'' said Steinberg, 47, who
did not testify at his trial. ``I have remorse about losing my
life.''
   ``I feel that pain every day,'' Steinberg told the judge, adding
that the loss belongs to all those ``whose life Lisa touched (and
received) the love that she gave.''
   Hedda Nussbaum, Steinberg's battered companion, watched the
sentencing on television at the Manhattan office of her attorney,
Betty Levinson, who quoted her as saying, ``How can he stand there
and lie with such a straight face?''
   ``He just got up there and lied and she's furious,'' Ms.
Levinson said of Ms. Nussbaum's reaction to Steinberg's statements.
``He was weaving together this totally untrue and fantastic
rendition of what happened.''
   Steinberg was convicted Jan. 30 of first-degree manslaughter in
Lisa's death but was acquitted of the more serious charge of
second-degree murder. He had received the child at birth from an
unmarried teen-ager and raised her as his own rather than
fulfilling his promise to arrange for the baby's adoption.
   On Nov. 2, 1987, Lisa was taken unconscious from the Greenwich
Village apartment Steinberg shared with Hedda Nussbaum. A
16-month-old boy also was found and eventually returned to his
natural mother.
   Lisa died three days later; murder charges were filed against
Steinberg and Ms. Nussbaum. Charges against Ms. Nussbaum were
dropped when prosecutors said she was ``so physically and mentally
incapacitated on the night of the murder that she was not
criminally responsible for Lisa's death.''
   In testimony against Steinberg, Ms. Nussbaum described an
11-year relationship with him that included beatings, brainwashing,
food deprivation, bizarre punishments and drug use.
   Steinberg told the judge Lisa received ``constant nurturing,
constant caring, constant love'' and desribed their relationship as
``joyous, superb, delightful.''
   Steinberg said he regretted a delay in medical attention that
may have contributed to Lisa's death.
   ``I feel I should have sensed when I came home a need for
medical attention,'' he said. ``If there was anything wrong with
Lisa when I left, I would not have left.''
   He denied hitting the child, but said, ``I don't deny that
during the course of administering CPR, OK, I could have caused
some'' injury. He dispassionately discussed the technical aspects
of Lisa's bruises.
   ``The testimony established Joel was basically a fine human
being,'' defense attorney Perry Reich said.
   Steinberg had a ``happy and cheerful nature'' and never hit
Lisa, Reich said.
   Steinberg smiled, chuckled and fidgeted while his lawyers
offered lengthy presentencing motions.
   Behind them sat Michele Launders, Lisa's biological mother, and
Grace Ann Smiegel, the grandmother of Travis, Steinberg's other
illegally adopted child. Both women cried when the sentence was
delivered and Mrs. Smiegel nodded in approval.
   ``It's a lie,'' Ms. Launders said after Steinberg's declaration
of mourning. ``I don't believe he feels anything. I don't think he
has the capability to feel for anybody but himself.''
   Four jurors and an alternate from the trial also attended the
sentencing. ``I think he deserved the maximum,'' said juror Allen
Jared.
   ``Society should be protected from him,'' said juror Helena
Barthell. ``I think he's a very violent person who committed a
terrible, heinous crime.''
   Under the general practice in New York, Steinberg would serve a
maximum of 16 years and eight months _ two-third of the legal
maximum _ if he earns time off for good behavior.
   Technically, Steinberg will be eligible for parole in seven
years because he has served 16 months of the 8 1-3-year minimum
term since he has been held without bail from the time of his
arrest on Nov. 2, 1987.
   Reich said a notice of appeal was filed Friday, adding, ``We're
very optimistic. It is fair to say this was just round one.''
   Rothwax received hundreds of letters _ from adoptive parents,
childless couples and people abused as children _ urging him to
give Steinberg the maximum term in Lisa's beating death.
   ``We had recommended that he get the maximum. Few defendants
have so richly deserved that recommendation,'' District Attorney
Robert Morgenthau said later. ``We hope the case serves as a
catalyst to stem child and drug abuse.''
   Court sources said the letters came from around the country and
as far away as Alaska and Florida. None of the letters recommended
leniency for Steinberg, the sources said; some demanded the death
penalty, which New York does not have.

   A 50-pound mountain lion was seized
Thursday in a one-bedroom Long Island apartment, where it had spent
the last few months ``running around, bouncing off the furniture,''
a state spokesman said.
   ``It was fully clawed, not an ideal pet for an apartment,'' said
Scott Florence, an officer with the state Department of
Environmental Conservation.
   He said the owner, whose name was not made public but who lived
in Deer Park, ``called our wildlife unit last Monday and said he
wanted to turn the cat in.''
   The owner said he had bought it as a 3-month-old kitten and
``thought it would be a neat thing to have'' but then it apparently
outgrew its cuteness, Florence said. The owner was charged with
possession of an endangered species.
   ``The cat was just being kept in his apartment,'' Florence said.
``He kept it in a small room. He put it on a leash when we got
there.''
   ``He had a dog in there and the 50-pound mountain lion in there
running around, bouncing off the furniture,'' said Greg Drossel,
general manager of the Long Island Game Farm in Manorville, where
the cougar was taken.
   ``She's in very good shape, like a big tabby.'' He said the cat,
6 months old and 18 inches high, about a third of its full-grown
size, had all its teeth.
   Drossel said the farm would keep the cat as a favor for the state
until the DEC decided what to do with it. ``It's not like they could
take it to Bide-A-Wee and hope some one adopts it,'' Drossel said.

<HEAD>Minimum Wage Battle Shifts To Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House passage of a plan to raise the minimum
wage shifts the partisan battle to the Senate, where the leading
proponent of an increase is urging President Bush to refrain from
further veto threats while Congress settles on a final bill.
   The House voted 248-171 Thursday in favor of legislation that
would raise the minimum wage from the current $3.35 an hour to $4.55
by October 1991, with the first increase taking effect later this
year.
   The House then joined the Senate on an Easter recess that ends
April 3.
   High on the Senate agenda when it returns is a bill sponsored by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., that would raise the minimum wage
to $4.65 by 1992.
   Kennedy has said he is open to amending his bill, and in a
statement issued after the House vote he asked Bush, who has
threatened to veto any attempt to raise the hourly minimum above
$4.25, to keep an open mind until the House and Senate agree on a
bill.
   ``This is an excellent opportunity for Congress and the
administration to demonstrate that they can work together and in
doing so achieve a fair increase in the minimum wage and an honest
training wage,'' Kennedy said.
   Bush has insisted that a six-month sub-minimum training wage
covering all newly hired employees be created in any legislation to
raise the minimum wage, a provision he said will help offset
potential job losses caused by raising the minimum.
   Sponsors of the House bill, while disputing GOP projections of
massive job losses, added a provision allowing a sub-minimum wage to
be paid to new hires for two months provided it was their first job.
   That falls far short of the White House demand and, with Kennedy
also opposed to Bush's training-wage proposal, that issue likely
will be a major sticking point in any attempts to reach a compromise.
   Several Republicans insisted that Democrats were going to have to
give in to Bush _ who appears to have the votes to sustain a veto _
or let a ninth year pass without any change in the minimum wage.
   ``The question is do you want a bill or do you want a political
issue?'' Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., said during an unsuccessful
GOP effort to substitute Bush's proposal for the House leadership's
measure. ``If you truly want to raise the minimum wage this is the
only game in town.''
   But Democrats argued they had given enough by cutting the final
increase from $4.65 an hour to $4.55 and by adding the new-hire wage.
   As amended, the House bill would boost the minimum wage to $3.85
an hour on Oct. 1, to $4.25 on Oct. 1, 1990, and to $4.55 a year
later. The provision for the new-hire wage, to be pegged at 85
percent of the minimum wage, would expire Sept. 30, 1992.
   It also would expand exemptions allowing small businesses to pay
wages lower than the minimum wage and would allow employers of
workers who earn tips to pay them 50 percent of the minimum wage,
down from the current 60 percent.
   Current law exempts service businesses with annual sales of less
than $362,000 from the minimum-wage law; the House bill increased
that level to $500,000. The provision is rarely used, however,
because of confusing regulations lawmakers say will be simplified in
conference committee if the Senate passes a minimum-wage bill.

<HEAD>Chilean Grapes Returning _ at Higher Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fresh Chilean grapes are being trucked across
the country today after a two-week absence from store shelves
because of a cyanide poisoning scare, industry leaders say.
   Consumers may see slightly higher prices on the produce
initially, but prices are expected to drop back to pre-scare levels
in a couple of weeks when supply catches up with demand, they said.
   Losses to Chilean exporters and to U.S. fruit importers as a
result of the cyanide scare over grapes and other produce are
estimated at $240 million, Ronald S. Bown, executive director of the
Chilean Exporters Association, said Thursday.
   Some of those losses may be offset by a plan being developed by
the Chilean government to compensate U.S. importers, wholesalers and
retailers as well as Chilean growers and exporters, Bown said.
   Officials at the Chilean embassy in Washington did not return
telephone calls for comment on the plan Thursday.
   An estimated $50 million to $75 million worth of Chilean fruit is
being destroyed under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's
advisory that was issued after the agency on March 12 found traces
of cyanide in two grapes from Chile. Earlier in the month an
anonymous caller to the U.S. embassy in the Chilean capital of
Santiago had threatened to inject cyanide in export fruit.
   Some 2 million to 3 million crates of the fruit _ grapes,
berries, pears, nectarines, peaches, melon and apples _ had been
removed from store shelves or was being held in warehouses until the
FDA concluded last week that it would have to be destroyed because
it could not be readily inspected.
   The FDA then announced a plan for stepped-up inspections of
Chilean fruit at the docks and on ships to clear the way for the
Chilean exports to get back into the stores with safety assurances.
   Bown said the Chilean fruit industry is anticipating a
``sustained level of consumer demand'' in the United States and is
doing all it can to ensure that fruit coming from Chile will be
``fresh, nutritious, of premium quality and available at a
reasonable price.''
   The reason, he said, is simple: ``The U.S. is by far our biggest
and best customer _ and we want to keep it that way.''
   Exporters are concentrating their efforts on returning table
grapes to U.S. markets, since they constitute 70 percent of Chilean
fruit exports. Pears and nectarines will follow, and should be on
some store shelves by the weekend, Bown said.
   There was no estimate when other fruits may begin appearing. The
FDA has been holding up distribution until laboratory tests can give
inspectors a better idea how to see evidence of cyanide tampering.
   Prices initially may be ``slightly higher'' than they had been
before the scare began because of pent-up demand, said George F.
Carstens, president of the American Produce Association, which
represents 65 companies that import Chilean fruit.
   ``When you return fruit to the pipeline, the initial demand will
be very, very strong and ... the initial impact of the first few
days might be perhaps slightly higher in terms of our prices to the
retailers,'' he said.
   Speaking for retailers, Charles Tryon, director of produce for
3,200 Super Valu stores and president-elect of the Produce Marketing
Association, said: ``We won't see dramatic increases in costs.''
   Neither Bown nor David Holzworth, general counsel for the Chilean
Exporters Association, would discuss details of the Chilean
government's plan for compensation.
   Holzworth said the Chileans are negotiating with the World Bank
on a line of credit so that Chile can ``set up a financial structure
that will allow importers working with their buyers to get the fruit
(that must be destroyed) out of the pipeline'' and get new shipments
of fresh fruit back in U.S. stores.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Say USDA Ignoring Current Drought Conditions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm state lawmakers say the U.S. Department of
Agriculture is mishandling last year's emergency drought relief and
ignoring this year's arid, potentially disastrous conditions on the
High Plains.
   Rep. Bill Sarpalius, a Texas Democrat and member of House
Agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains, said
the Texas Panhandle is extremely dry, yet he can't find out ``from
anybody'' what ``we can do to help our farmers.''
   At a hearing Thursday, an angry Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., said
the central part of the country is ``blowing away ... and I can't
get any damn answers,'' because of the Bush administration's slow
pace in filling key policy jobs at USDA.
   ``People are crawling out of train wrecks faster ... than they're
getting people on board,'' Roberts said during a subcommittee
hearing on USDA's handling of the $3.9 billion drought bill.
   Milton Hertz, administrator of USDA's Agricultural Stabilization
and Conservation Service, countered that farmers receiving drought
benefits do not face an undue paperwork burden. He also said he
doesn't believe the agency has suffered during the transition to the
Bush administration.
   As of Feb. 28, more than 558,000 producers have received disaster
payments and emergency feed assistance amounting to more than $2.7
billion, Hertz testified.
   The amount paid to date represents 70 percent of what the agency
anticipates will go to farmers stricken by the devastating drought
of 1988, he said.
   Hertz said he was not aware of efforts at USDA to draft 1989
drought relief, although subcommittee chairman Rep. Dan Glickman,
D-Kan., said it's ``no secret the central part of America is blowing
away right now.''
   Sarpalius said he supports another drought-relief bill this year,
because Texas Panhandle wheat crops are ``burned up'' and decimated
by insects. Livestock also has suffered.
   Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, said
drought conditions extend from North Dakota to South Texas.
   ``The dust is blowing. ... The seed won't germinate,'' said de la
Garza, asking Hertz to determine whether farmers must plant seed
when they know it won't germinate in order to collect disaster
relief.
   Ron Rivinius, an Elgin, N.D., wheat producer and
secretary-treasurer of the National Association of Wheat Growers
Inc., said Congress needs to consider extending drought disaster
assistance.
   G. Chandler Keys III, director of congressional relations for the
National Cattlemen's Association, said USDA had ``problems,
misunderstandings, foul-ups, and general disregard for the intent of
Congress'' when promulgating regulations for emergency livestock
feeding programs under the drought bill.
   ``For all the good intentions in the drought bill, it may be for
naught with many livestock producers because of the lack of good
follow-through and good faith on the part of the USDA,'' Keys said.

<HEAD>Integration Gains in Danger, Report Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southern schools are the nation's most
integrated as a result of court orders and federal compliance plans
dating from two decades ago, but a new report says clear signs of
erosion are threatening their achievements.
   Alabama and Mississippi ``show major increases in segregation and
have joined the list of the nation's most segregated states for
black students,'' said the study released Thursday by the National
School Boards Association.
   Other Southern and border states, including Florida, are
experiencing gradual declines that may reflect a failure by many
fast-growing districts to update their desegregation plans, the
report says.
   The report, based on federal statistics, cited encouraging trends
in black-white integration through mandatory city-suburban busing
plans in St. Louis, Las Vegas, Indianapolis and elsewhere.
   But the picture was uniformly grim for Hispanics. ``Hispanic
students are becoming more highly segregated in virtually every part
of the country and among each major subgroup,'' the report said.
   Hispanic students are increasingly isolated in center cities with
declining white enrollments, it said, and have been largely ignored
by the government agencies and civil rights groups that brought
about the desegregation of black schools.
   ``The march to school integration is certainly not over, and
school systems are finding no quick and easy solutions,'' James
Oglesby, president-elect of the association, said in issuing the
study of desegregation trends from 1968 to 1986.
   At the national level, the study found that school desegregation
remained relatively stable in the 1980s ``in spite of the harsh
attacks by the Reagan administration and the widespread impression
that the policy was being abandoned.''
   Nevertheless, the study said, the federal government should ``end
its attacks on school desegregation and its efforts to dismantle
plans that are stable.'' Other positive steps would be to resume
research on effective desegregation techniques and offer assistance
to districts trying to desegregate, it said.
   Gary Orfield, a University of Chicago professor and co-author of
the study, suggested that the nation make a concerted effort to
achieve residential integration which would automatically result in
integrated local schools. He also said rapidly developing areas
should update their desegregation plans.
   The report uses federal statistics to rate regions, states and
cities on their desegregation efforts. Orfield said it is not meant
as a commentary on the quality of education in particular
communities, but noted there is ``a very strong relationship''
between high minority student populations, low test scores and high
dropout rates.
   The study said Hispanic segregation has always been worst among
Puerto Ricans in the Northeast but statistics show alarming trends
elsewhere. The percentage of Hispanic enrollment in
90-percent-to-100 percent minority schools rose from 6.8 percent in
1968 to 23.5 percent in 1986 in the Midwest, and from 11.7 percent
to 24.7 percent in the West.
   The growing proportion of Hispanic students and the lack of major
desegregation litigation ``suggest a future of continuingly
increasing segregation,'' the report said.
   For blacks, the most segregated states are Illinois and New York
while integration is at its highest levels in the South. ``We made
the largest effort in the South and it had the largest impact, but
we're beginning to see in the 1980s a slow resegregation of the
South,'' Orfield said.
   The most striking example of the trend is in Alabama, the report
said. The percent of the state's black students attending schools
with white majorities fell by 8 percent in the 1980s; the proportion
of students in highly segregated schools rose by 9.3 percent in the
1980s; and the percent of white enrollment in a typical black
student's school fell almost to the level of 1970, ``before the
implementation of the large urban busing orders.''
   In contrast to the black and Hispanic experiences, the study says
Asian students are not segregated. The average Asian student attends
a school with a majority of whites, 20 percent Asians and 25 percent
blacks and Hispanics.

<HEAD>Winter Winds Skim Tons of Soil from Great Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fierce winds have eroded nearly 4.7 million
acres of land in the Great Plains this winter, one of the most
extensive losses on record, according to an Agriculture Department
survey.
   ``Much of this damage is due to the drought,'' Wilson Scaling,
chief of the department's Soil Conservation Service, said Thursday.
``We went into the wind erosion season with poor cover in much of
the Great Plains because of the drought. Then this winter, we've had
a combination of no snow cover and high-velocity winds in many
areas.''
   Scaling said 88 percent of the acreage damaged was cropland, with
rangeland accounting for most of the remainder.
   The SCS surveys Great Plains damage annually from Nov. 1 through
the following May 31, a seven-month period when winds are highest
and soils are driest. The damage to 4.7 million acres was through
February.
   Scaling said the northern plains were hard hit, with Montana
showing damage to nearly 1.4 million acres, about 30 percent of the
10-state total. Losses in Montana and Wyoming have been greater than
at any time since SCS began the regular surveys in 1955.
   Agency records go back to the mid-1930s, but figures for some of
those years were obtained from other sources.
   The worst damage was done to about 16 million acres in 1954-55,
although the old Dust Bowl probably exceeded that in the early 1930s
before annual figures were compiled.
   But the 1987-88 season was bad, too, with more than 13 million
acres damaged in the region. Another was in 1980-81 when the agency
reported 12.5 million acres.
   Land is considered wind-damaged when the effects of wind are
apparent to the eye. By that time, according to conservationists,
the erosion rate has reached about 15 tons per acre a year, usually
at least three times faster than is ``tolerable,'' or naturally
replaceable.
   A loss of five tons per acre translates into a layer of soil
about the thickness of a dime spread over one acre.
   Scaling said farmers used emergency tillage on more than a
million acres to help reduce the blowing by roughing the surface
exposed to wind. Texas accounted for 80 percent of the emergency
tillage, about 880,000 acres.
   In addition to the land damaged during the four-month period,
Scaling said more than 22.5 million acres were ``in condition to
blow'' as of March 1, the most in 32 years. Highest on the list are
Kansas, North Dakota and Texas, he said.
   According to the survey, which was made in 541 counties of the
region's 10 states, here is the state-by-state breakdown comparing
damaged acres in November, December, January and February with the
same four months of 1987-88:

   A new 55-page handbook has been designed by the
Agriculture Department to help farmers, shippers and local
communities cope with the loss of railroad service.
   Martin ``Buzz'' Fitzpatrick Jr., head of the department's Office
of Transportation, said Thursday the handbook contains information
on rural rail assistance from a number of sources and summarizes
regulations as these apply to rail abandonments.
   ``Many of the light-density branch lines being cast off are
located in agricultural regions,'' he said. ``Without rail
transportation, the marketing options of local producers are
limited.''
   The topics include abandonments, alternatives to abandonment, and
guidelines for evaluating the possibility of small railroad
operations. Information is included for potential buyers who have
little or no railroad experience.
   Fitzpatrick said many, if not all, of the major railroad
companies have programs or plans for assisting in line sales. And
many of those have worked with rural communities and shippers to
explore ways of retaining rail service. This information is also in
the handbook, he said.
   Copies of the booklet are being sent to federal, state and local
organizations involved in rural railroad service assistance, he
said. A limited supply is available free of charge for general
distribution.
   For more information, contact: John Batson, USDA-OT, P.O. Box
96575, Washington, D.C., 20090-6575. Or call 202 653-6108.

   The Agriculture Department says egg production
is down about 6 percent from a year ago, mostly reflecting a sharp
cutback by producers because of low prices last year.
   Total production during the first three months of the marketing
year that began Dec. 1 was estimated at 16.7 billion eggs, down from
17.7 billion a year earlier, the department said Thursday in a
report.
   As of March 1, laying hens totaled 271 million, down from 282
million a year ago. The March 1 flock included about 232 million
hens producing eggs for consumer use, and 38.9 million producers of
hatching-type eggs.
   The department's Economic Research Service says 1989 egg
production is expected to be down around 2 percent from last year
because of the reduction in laying hens.
   Producers cut back flocks in response to the lowest net returns
since USDA began estimating those figures in 1972, the agency said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Soviet Ambassador Exudes Glasnost</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Over spicy Thai shrimp and piquant vegetables
in a Washington restaurant jam-packed with reporters, Soviet
Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin exuded glasnost and good cheer.
   Superpower relations are on the upswing, and Dubinin was all
smiles _ except on NATO's plan to extend the range of short-range
nuclear missiles.
   ``It's unacceptable, at any rate not for the Soviet Union but for
the process we are talking about,'' Dubinin said. ``It's just
something which is going against the mainstream of peaceable
development of the world. It's something which goes against the
process of disarmament.''
   His tone of voice serious, Dubinin added: ``There's absolutely no
need to do it, because we have begun in Europe a historic process of
reducing forces, unilaterally by the Soviet Union and multilaterally
in negotiations.''
   In any event, Dubinin said, the Soviet Union will not modernize
its own battlefield nuclear weapons. ``We are strongly in favor of
beginning negotiations to eliminate this class of weapons, too,'' he
said.
   Indeed, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is on a disarmament
offensive, and the United States and its allies are caught up in the
process.
   A treaty in 1987 banned all U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range
nuclear missiles. Negotiations have begun in Vienna between NATO and
the Warsaw Pact to reduce tanks, antiaircraft artillery and possibly
other conventional armor in Europe.
   And Gorbachev is unilaterally cutting Soviet defense spending,
withdrawing six tank divisions from Eastern Europe, and has
announced a projected reduction of 500,000 troops overall.
   Dubinin fielded questions with ease after reading a prepared,
boilerplate speech. English is his fourth or fifth language, but
Dubinin needed only occasional help from an interpreter. And when he
was done, he gave an interview in Spanish to a journalist from
Madrid for good measure.
   Soviet news conferences, here and in Moscow, have become a
frequent occurrence. A few weeks ago, Dubinin called in American
reporters at the Soviet embassy and answered their questions for
nearly two hours.
   At the session Thursday at the Thai restaurant, Dubinin said the
Soviets would be willing to reduce their military aid to Nicaragua _
a bone in the U.S. throat _ as part of a peaceful settlement in
Central America.
   He said Jews were free to leave the Soviet Union, or to return,
if they wished, and even leave again. Perhaps, he suggested with a
smile, they were coming and going ``for the love of travel.''
   Dubinin said Moscow accepts as a ``reality'' the growing union in
Western Europe and said his government wants to develop ``a normal
relationship'' with the 12-country community.
   And he declined to criticize the Bush administration for delaying
a resumption of negotiations to reduce long-range nuclear missiles.
   ``The delay is a delay,'' he said. ``It's absolutely clear. But
we understand the new administration needs some time to get things
together. It's understandable.''
   The NATO plan to make U.S. Lance missiles more powerful also is
running into obstacles within the Western alliance. West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, with support from some other allied leaders,
is seeking a delay.
   The United States is determined to go ahead, but still has to
convince Kohl, whose chance for re-election next year may hinge on
the missile issue in a country where disarmament forces are strong.
   Congress, meanwhile, is unlikely to fund the modernization with
West Germany on the fence.
   Soviet criticism of the NATO plan could deepen the division
within the alliance. Whatever the outcome, Dubinin said the Soviets
would not modernize their own battlefield nuclear weapons.
   The ambassador spoke with the confidence of a government that
seems to believe momentum is on its side.

<HEAD>Quayle Endorses `Brilliant Pebbles' Defense Missile Technology</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle has become the
administration advocate for the strategic defense concept known as
``brilliant pebbles,'' a method of seeding outer space with
satellites that track and destroy missiles.
   In a speech Thursday to the Navy League of the United States,
Quayle stressed the relatively small size, comparative low cost and
fast schedule for development of the satellites.
   Cost, complexity and pace of development are among the issues
raised by critics of the Star Wars program.
   ``In short, if tests of the brilliant pebbles concept show the
promise that is expected, it could revolutionize much of our
thinking about strategic defense,'' Quayle said in his speech.
   The brilliant pebbles technology relies on thousands of small
satellites that would float freely in space, tracking incoming
missiles and destroying them by colliding with them.
   The system, based on research under way at the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory, has been touted by the retired director of the
Star Wars program, Lt. Gen. James A. Abrahamson.
   Quayle, however is the first high ranking administration official
to speak out on brilliant pebbles. Others have declined to say
whether the concept might re-focus U.S. research on the strategic
defense initiative.
   Abrahamson urged the Pentagon in February to embrace the
technology, saying it offered better performance and dramatic cost
reduction over other techniques.
   Brilliant pebbles could be used in an opening phase of the Star
Wars system at a cost of not more than $25 billion, according to
Abrahamson.
   One administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
on Thursday said that while no decisions have been made on whether
to go with brilliant pebbles, it ``certainly is a very attractive
prospect and one that is being looked at closely.''
   Quayle also said that despite the Soviet Union's internal changes
under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, ``I know of nothing that has
occurred since 1983 that should change our thinking about strategic
defense.''
   The Pentagon has estimated that a first-phase Star Wars system
using both ground-based and space-based weapons and sensors would
cost about $69 billion. Critics say the system probably would be far
more expensive and wouldn't work anyway.

   Showing Aaron and Nick Gerstler pictures of his
five children, Rep. Dick Armey explained how each has a different
personality. One son, Armey said, is a worrier.
   ``Does he worry about dying?'' asked one of the Gerstler brothers
in a quiet, small voice.
   Armey deftly changed the subject, and to the amazement of the
brothers from DeSoto, Texas, presented them with a flag that had
flown over the Capitol a day earlier.
   ``Is it ours?'' asked Aaron, 10.
   ``Where'd you get it?'' asked Nick, 9. ``Do we get to keep it?''
   And so began, Armey promised, a great adventure for two children
with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, a rare form of the disease that
usually takes the life of its victims by the age of 15.
   With their parents, Harold W. and Penny, pushing their
wheelchairs, Armey in the lead, and Nick's twin sister, Angelee
scampering ahead of everyone, the little convoy set out to explore
the Capitol in the dim light of evening, when the click of heels on
the tiled floors resonates through the empty corridors.
   The brothers rubbed the feet of Will Rogers' statue for good
luck, saw where machine gun bullets grazed across a table in the
House chamber three decades ago, and blood stains that had seeped
into a marble staircase during a shootout involving a Kentucky
congressman and newspaper reporter in the early days of 1890.
   While on the floor of the House chamber, Aaron asked Armey if the
lawmakers leave a lot of trash littered about at the end of the day.
   ``They talk a lot of trash,'' said Armey, a Republican from
Texas. ``But they don't mess the place up.''
   ``You can't call anybody a bad name,'' Armey said, explaining how
congressmen ask each other ``Will the gentleman yield?'' when they
want to talk.
   ``We don't say shut up,'' said Armey, whose office arranged for
special tours for the boys during their week in Washington,
including visits to the FBI and a visit Thursday with President Bush
in the Oval Office.
   The boys said Bush showed them pictures of his new puppies, and
each child received an autographed picture of the president.
   Angelee was given a stick pin with the presidential crest. The
boys got tie clips.
   They gave the president a picture taken from above, of children
in one of their schools lined up to spell ``Drug Free,'' and stories
from Nick and Angelee's fellow third graders.
   Bush asked them about their tour of Washington, sponsored by the
non-profit ``A Wish for Wings'' in Arlington, Texas, which helps
children with life-threatening illness live out a wish that would
otherwise have been financially impossible.
   ``Meeting the president was an extra bonus,'' said the boys'
mother as the family shivered outside the White House in chilly
weather and no coats. ``We were really thrilled,''
   Mrs. Gerstler said the family had expected warmer weather, and
the jackets they had brought weren't dressy enough for the White
House.
   She said the trip to Washington was the boys' first choice for
their Wish with Wings, ahead of Hawaii and all the Nintendo games
ever made. The boys are A students with a big interest in social
studies, she said..
   ``I like the building,'' Aaron said of the Capitol. ``It's big. I
like the statues, all of the detail.''

   Mrs. Carter told a Nova University luncheon that the country met

   City Council is considering a request to
remove Barbara Mandrell Boulevard signs from a two-mile section of
highway because the country music star has moved 15 miles away.
   Jeannie Gregory, executive director of the Gallatin Chamber of
Commerce, said she believes the two large signs should be removed
``if the posts can be used to advertise civic groups or for some
other fashion.''
   The signs, costing a total of $10,000, were erected in 1983 along
the stretch of U.S. 31E about five miles from Mandrell's former
palatial home on Old Hickory Lake. The singer moved to Joelton last
year.
   ``There are no hard feelings because she left,'' Gregory said.
   City council members studied the matter Tuesday night, and will
discuss it again April 4.
   Jeannie Ghent, a spokeswoman for the performer, said there will
be no ill feelings if the signs come down.
   ``We were so honored when they made that stretch of road, but
with her moving out, we don't blame Gallatin at all,'' she said.
``We were honored by the time we had it.''

   Actress Meryl Streep has neither accepted
nor rejected an invitation from apple processor Tree Top Inc. to
view Alar testing, her agent's office said.
   Tree Top, the nation's largest apple juice maker, issued its
invitation Tuesday. It wants Ms. Streep to visit its headquarters
and view how it tests to make sure Alar is not present in its
products.
   ``I have no idea if she is aware of the invitation,'' Susan
Anderson, who works for agent Sam Cohn in New York City, said during
a telephone interview Thursday.
   She said Ms. Streep will be out of the country until Tuesday,
plans to attend the Academy Awards on Wednesday, and will leave the
country again the next day.
   Tree Top, based in the Yakima suburb of Selah, contends that the
nationwide Alar controversy _ with Ms. Streep as a vocal opponent of
the suspected carcinogenic farm chemical _ has been a ``blanket
indictment'' of the entire apple industry.
   Tree Top for years has rejected Alar-treated apples for its own
products, but contends that the nationwide scare is hurting its

   Free enterprise has collided with the Academy
Awards, and everybody's trying to pick up the pieces.
   With Oscar statuettes selling at auction for more than $10,000
and a Chicago trophy company casting alleged Academy Award clones,
the National Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is
scrambling to make sure Oscar's golden sheen isn't tarnished by
Hollywood hucksterism.
   ``If you know about an infringement and fail to object to it, you
risk having your trademark become public domain,'' said Bruce Davis,
the Academy's executive administrator, in explaining the lawsuits
the organization has filed to protect its beloved hunk of
electroplated pewter.
   But despite the Academy's crusade against crass commercialism,
this year's awards ceremony will feature a new merchandising
wrinkle: Some 800 limousines delivering the most famous stars to the
Oscar telecast will be equipped with door-mounted coolers jammed
with Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Classic and other Coca-Cola Co. beverages.
   When the limo doors swing open in front of the Shrine Auditorium
and the celebrities tumble out, the Coke logo will be on display in
front of an audience that includes millions around the world.
   ``It seemed like a good marketing opportunity,'' said Coca-Cola
spokesman Ira Gleser. ``The Academy approached our local bottler in
Los Angeles and said we're going to have a lot of thirsty people.''
   But even as the Academy embraces this new intrusion of
merchandising, it has lashed out at whatever else it considers a
blemishing of the Oscar name.
   When MGM-UA, the distributor of ``Rain Man,'' published newspaper
advertisements touting the film's Oscar nominations before the
nominations were even announced, the Academy issued a harsh
statement condemning MGM-UA's promotional gamble. After the ads
appeared, ``Rain Man'' collected nine nominations.
   ``We regard this as a serious matter, and we have communicated
our concern,'' said Richard Kahn, president of the Academy.
   For nearly 50 years, the Academy has maintained strict security
around both the nominations and the award winners. It also has
envisoned the statuette itself as something of an icon.
   So auctioning the Oscar has greatly distressed the Academy.
   The Collector's Book Store, local sponsors of monthly
entertainment memorabilia auctions, has sold off seven Oscars in the
past year, including the best picture trophy for 1951's ``An
American in Paris'' ($15,760), Marlon Brando's best actor prize for
1954's ``On the Waterfront'' ($13,000) and the black and white
interior decoration Oscar for 1941's ``How Green Was My Valley''
($17,715).
   None were sold by the original recipients; heirs or friends who
had later received the trophies put them on the block.
   When Malcolm Willits, the book store's owner, announced that he
would hold a February auction for the 1957 best-picture trophy for
``Around the World in 80 Days,'' the Academy said enough, initiating
a court action that, for now, has blocked any future trophy sales.
   The Academy insists that a contract signed by Oscar winners
mandates that they will not sell the trophies without first offering
them to the Academy for a nominal fee.
   ``But now that the word is out that these awards are worth
$10,000 to $50,000, people are reluctant to sell them back to the
Academy for $10,'' Willits said.
   ``The Academy has created something of great value here. This is
the most famous award in the world _ the most instantly recognizable
award. The Nobel Prize might be a greater honor, but people know
more about what an Academy Award looks like.
   ``And they're very limited, too. There's not too many of them
around. ... Twenty years ago, you wouldn't have a movie poster in
your living room unless you were a college student. Now, you can go
into Beverly Hills homes and there's a movie poster, and the darn
thing's worth $10,000 or $20,000 dollars.''
   When the Academy won a court order temporarily blocking future
auctions, Willits decided to sell his store. ``It seemed to be the
final straw. I don't like lawsuits,'' he said. ``I'm getting older
and I'd like to write movie scripts.''
   Yet the Academy has lost its most recent attempt to save its
trophy's integrity: A copyright infringement suit brought against
the Houston International Film Festival was dismissed March 16 in a
California federal court.
   The Academy had claimed the Lone Star Statuette, designed and
built by Chicago's Creative House Promotions, was ``practically
identical'' to the Oscar. The court found otherwise.

<TEXT>
   Christopher Columbus' discoveries in the
New World brought riches to this ancient city in southern Spain.
Five centuries later, Columbus is doing it again.
   This time it is Expo '92, an exhibition commemorating Columbus'
voyages. It will run for six months and end on Oct. 12, 1992, 500
years to the day the explorer reached land in the Caribbean.
   Expo '92 is a gamble by Spain's Socialist government to catapult
one of Europe's most beautiful and most neglected cities into the
21st century.
   On an island across the Guadalquivir River from the old city's
narrow streets and shaded patios, construction workers labor under a
warm sun to transform about 600 acres of largely barren space into
the biggest international exposition ever held.
   The monastery where Columbus' remains were once buried is being
restored as the Spanish Royal Pavillion, where King Juan Carlos
expects to greet dignitaries from the 88 countries, including the
United States, that have signed up to take part in Expo '92.
   A new railroad station will be built on the tracks that run by
the site and a bullet train will carry passengers to the exhibition
in half the three hours' time it takes now.
   But right now Seville is snarled in traffic as work progresses on
dozens of new bridges, roads and other public works that must be
completed by opening day, April 20, 1992.
   In addition to the $922 million the government has budgeted for
administrative costs and on-site construction, authorities will pour
an estimated $5.6 billion into public works projects to improve
roads, railways and airports throughout southern Spain.
   ``Seville is going to have a difficult time, because it's a small
city for so much construction,'' said Antonio Rodriguez Almodovar,
who coordinates public works funded by the regional Andalusian
government.
   ``We've got to ask residents for patience and compassion because
after 1992 this is going to be the most important city in southern
Europe,'' Rodriguez added.
   The government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, a native of
Seville, has billed Expo '92 as the starting point for the city's
economic renaissance.
   Angel Ojeda, the Andalusian autonomous regional tax commissioner
and a member of the Expo '92 Corp.'s board of administrators, said
the project is expected to break even on the proceeds from entry
fees, royalties, pavillion rental and sponsors' contributions.
   Once the administrative capital of Spain's overseas empire,
Seville now presides over Andalusia, the country's poorest region,
where unemployment runs at about 30 percent compared to the national
jobless rate of 18.7 percent.
   A recent study by the National Employment Institute estimated the
exhibition will generate 130,000 construction jobs over the next
four years. About 7,000 other people will be needed to keep Expo '92
running.
   Forty million people are expected to visit the exhibition, which
will leave Seville with an Olympic stadium, a communications center,
a huge municipal park, several theaters and hundreds of new
buildings that organizers hope will house a research and development
complex. Spain will be the host of the 1992 Summer Olympics.
   Six high technology companies _ IBM, Alcatel, Telefonica de
Espana, Fujitsu, Rank Xerox and Siemens _ have signed contracts to
convert their pavillions into research and development and
job-training centers after the fair ends.
   The Expo '92 Corp. has what it calls the ``1993 Plan,'' a
post-exhibition project to cut travel time between Seville and the
coastal resort areas of Malaga to the southeast, Huelva to the
southwest, and Cadiz to the south, rather than massive investments
in hotels in Seville itself. The number of hotel beds in Seville
will be doubled, however.
   ``It's better to improve communication with the Huelva coast,
which will be 45 minutes away, than build hotels in Seville that are
forced to close in 1993,'' said Jacinto Pellon, general director of
the Expo '92 Corp.
   Three luxury hotels are planned for the Expo '92 site, along with
an ``Expo City'' of residential units for people who come here to
set up the exhibitions.
   Expo '92 project has not missed any construction deadlines so
far, and public works coordinator Rodriguez said contracts called
for all the major public works to be finished on time.
   But Pellon said poor administrative coordination has held up
approval of Marina de Sevilla, a private, $69.6-million complex that
includes a civic center, 300-room hotel, a marina and shopping
center on about 40 acres of public land along the river.
   Marina de Sevilla's managing director, Arturo Moya, said if the
city and central governments do not approve the development by May 1
investors will reconsider the project. Among the investors is
Management Resources of Tustin, Calif., which has pledged a
33-percent stake.

<HEAD>Once A Rising Star, Philadelphia Mayor Faces Big Problems</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's birthplace has big problems, and
its mayor, once mentioned as a potential vice president, is taking
the heat.
   Residents complain about too few police, too many dirty streets
and reduced services. They blame Mayor W. Wilson Goode, whom they
have forced to back off from a proposed $70 million tax increase.
Even a political ally admits the mayor ``has been a disappoinment.''
   Goode was mentioned as a vice presidential possibility in 1984 by
Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale. But that was
before the 1985 debacle in which 11 people were killed when police,
with Goode's go-ahead, confronted the radical MOVE group and forever
damaged the mayor's image.
   Goode has insisted that things in Philadelphia are not as bad as
critics claim. But last week, he abruptly halted a telephone
interview on the first question when asked if the city was in
trouble.
   ``I don't want to talk about it,'' he said. ``Just say the mayor
doesn't want to comment.''
   Challenges remain for Goode, the first black mayor in the
nation's fifth-largest city, who is nearly halfway through his
second four-year term.
   Fresh off reversing the city's commitment to a new
courthouse-jail complex after spending $30 million on it, Goode
faces the wrath of the city's legal community and a federal court
order to relieve prison crowding. Forced by public pressure to back
off the tax increase, Goode is trying to put together a budget amid
projections of a $100 million deficit and the clamor for more
services.
   Even a special Tax Policy and Budget Review Committee appointed
by Goode rebuffed the mayor's tax proposal.
   ``I thought it would be a whitewash and it wasn't. That in itself
indicates the severity of the problem,'' said W. Thacher Longstreth,
the senior Republican in City Council.
   Many contend Goode hasn't been a good manager, and even
supporters such as Edward Mezvinsky, former Pennsylvania Democratic
chairman and co-chairman of Goode's 1987 re-election campaign,
acknowledge his political dilemma.
   ``He's got to take unpopular positions because there is a lot
less money available,'' Mezvinsky said. ``The city has to make it on
its own. It's got to pull in its belt and cut out unnecessary
services. It has to be done if the city is going to survive.''
   At recent town meetings, which Goode arranged this winter in a
futile effort to sell his tax plan, tempers frequently flared as
citizens confronted the frustrated, sometimes angry mayor, demanding
more police protection, clean streets, and charging that drug
dealers control too many neighborhoods.
   Former Mayor William Green, under whom Goode was city managing
director, declined to discuss the managerial style of his successor.
   ``The facts speak for themselves,'' Green said.
   Several top Democrats did not return phone calls or declined to
comment publicly on the mayor's standing. The political ally who
said Goode has been a disappoinment would speak only on condition of
anonymity.
   ``He really isn't running the city well. He is not a dishonest
person and is trying to do his best but integrity isn't enough to
manage, and his mismanagement has allowed his detractors to have a
field day which has undermined his effectiveness,'' the Goode ally
said.
   ``This city is more divided today than ever before. All the blame
isn't Goode's alone. Others have to share it, like the council, like
the business community, the judiciary. Everyone seems to have an axe
to grind ... and Goode has been unable to bring the diverse elements
together so the city can be run well,'' the ally said.
   Republicans looking ahead to this fall's district attorney and
city controller elections smell blood. It's been nearly four decades
since Republicans last controlled the government of this city, which
has a 3-to-1 Democratic registration.
   ``If you listen, you can hear people saying Philadelphia is ready
for a complete change in government and politics,'' said state Sen.
M. Joseph Rocks, the GOP choice for controller.
   Goode has shown he's listening. He said recently he would hire
400 more police this year, and then add 300 more in each of the next
three years to a force now at about 6,000, down from the 7,800 when
he took office in 1984.
   Councilman James Tayoun, a Democrat often at odds with Goode,
said the mayor must cooperate to get things done.
   ``He's now being forced to understand that he has no higher taxes
in sight, that he has to increase the police, that he has to clean
the streets, and if he does that the city will begin to turn
around,'' Tayoun said.

   A man on a rampage with a submachine gun
Thursday abducted a woman, killed her and her mother-in-law, then
raped another woman, was cornered by police and shot two officers
before fatally shooting himself, police said.
   The gunman, identified as Eugene Frank Thompson Jr., was taken
into custody with a head wound around 3 p.m. from a duplex in this
suburb south of Denver where he shot the officers who entered the
building on a house-to-house search.
   The suspect, armed with a MAC-11 submachine pistol, opened fire
on the two officers, hitting one in the chest and neck and wounding
the other with flying glass, as they entered a townhouse in the
Arapahoe Ridge subdivision.
   The gunman then shot a 18-year-old hostage in the back, and went
upstairs and shot himself in the head, police said.
   ``All he said was, `Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, he shot me and
then went upstairs and shot himself,'' Arapahoe County Sheriff Pat
Sullivan quoted the hostage, Jake Carper, as saying.
   A police SWAT team rescued the wounded officers, lobbed flash
grenades into the house and found the hostage and Thompson, Sullivan
said.
   The gunman was taken with the wounded officers to Swedish Medical
Center, where he died at 5:56 p.m., said hospital spokeswoman
Beverly Jacobsen.
   Carper was in critical condition with multiple gunshot wounds;
Deputy Arthur L. Hilton, 37, was in serious condition with a chest
wound; and Deputy Daniel Thomas, 36, was in good condition with a
leg wound and face cuts, hospital officials said.
   Sullivan, a critic of assault rifle sales, said the gunman used
the semiautomatic MAC-11, which is sold over-the-counter, and that
said there was evidence the weapon had been modified to fire fully
automatic.
   When the weapon was recovered there were only five rounds left of
its 32-round magazine, he said.
   Authorities were at a loss to explain a motive for the one-man
crime wave.
   ``This man is ... extremely dangerous,'' said Douglas County
Sheriff's Lt. Bill Walker. ``We have four or five crime scenes and a
lot of people hurt and injured.''
   The state Department of Corrections said its only record of
Thompson was that he had been charged for second-degree burglary.
But he never served time in state prison, apparently having been
granted probation, officials said.
   Eugene Strauber, regional vice president of the Cenikor
Foundation cocaine residence treatment program in suburban Lakewood,
said Thompson had been enrolled in the program as part of his
probation and eventually was kicked out for stealing, but never
hinted at violence.
   ``He left about three months ago. We ask people how severe their
addictions are and he reported he had a $30-a-day cocaine habit. He
was a very average person. ... Not the type who stands out. He came
in at age 20 and had a long history of substance abuse,'' Strauber
said.
   ``He never exhibited mood swings here. If he had shown violent
behavior, we would not have allowed him to stay here,'' Strauber
said.
   More than 100 officers from three counties and the State Patrol
joined a manhunt in southern metropolitan Denver, where creeks with
grassy floodplains run amid housing subdivisions.
   Authorities said the man broke into a house in Jefferson County,
southwest of Denver, about 3 a.m., and a woman there called a police
emergency number. She hung up before she could give her address, but
authorities traced the call and found her garage door open, and the
woman and a car missing.
   Authorities said Thompson kidnapped Beverly J. Swartz, 47, from
her home in a burglary gone sour, and forced her to drive to the
home of her mother-in-law, Janice Irene Swartz, 68, in rural
Littleton.
   Shortly after 6 a.m., the Louviers Fire Department got a report
of shootings in a subdivision in Douglas County. Authorities found
the two women dead, and two men in shock.
   Douglas County Sheriff Steve Zotos said the women were tied up
and shot with a semiautomatic weapon. The two men were tied up but
not harmed and were able to untie themselves and telephone
authorities. Their names were not disclosed.
   The gunman then stole a car, and drove about 10 miles to a
southern Denver subdivision and pulled in behind a limousine that
had arrived to pick up residents.
   ``He pulled in behind the limousine, apparently assaulted the
limousine driver, and apparently the victim was either outside or
came outside and he forced her back into the house,'' Zotos said.
The woman's husband and an infant were also in the house.
   The gunman sexually assaulted the woman, then fled in the
limousine and wrecked it a short time later when he crashed into a
fence, authorities said. He fled on foot to the Arapahoe Ridge
house, about three blocks distant, and holed up with Carper. It was
not immediately clear whether Carper was living at the townhouse.
   Based on the damage to the car, authorities believed the man was
injured in the accident. The man was acting erratically, and may
have been taking drugs, Walker said.
   ``He's high on something, high and desperate for some reason.''

and the transit police are dividing the river of morning commuters
rushing toward the trains: women on the right, men on the left.
   Any man found on the wrong side is apt to be publicly humiliated.
   ``Excuse me, sir,'' a uniformed official said to a young man
joining his female companion in the women's line.
   ``Over there,'' the officer ordered, pointing. Morning commuters
silently stared as the couple moved over.
   Mexico City has the only subway system that segregates its
passengers by sex during rush hour, said Miguel Gerardo Requis
Bustos, manager of stations and transportation.
   Women who use the Metro on weekdays between 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. and
4 p.m. to 9 p.m. say there's only one reason.
   ``They separate us because the men are abusive, they like to grab
the women,'' said seamstress Modesta Baez, 50, who rides the women's
cars daily. ``Women don't try to grab other women.''
   Itziar Lozano, a feminist counselor who has been sexually
harassed on the Metro, agreed.
   ``Although the women's cars are just as crowded, and you can't
move or breathe, you don't have to worry about sexual aggression,''
Lozano said.
   Requis said the segregated cars, which began 10 years ago, are
necessary for ``maintaining order'' on the subway. The modern system
daily moves an estimated 5 million people over almost 90 miles of
track.
   ``It is the only Metro in the world that gives additional
attention to women and children by separating them,'' Requis said.
``This way they can travel more comfortably.''
   Women can ride in the men's cars during rush hour, but men are
prohibited from the women's cars.
   Mexico City doesn't have a corner on Metro mashing, said Antonio
Santamaria, a psychoanalyst who has written extensively on Mexican
male aggression, known as machismo.
   He said such harassment occurs elsewhere, but the fact that
segregated subway cars exist only in Mexico says a lot about Mexican
culture.
   Santamaria believes the cars exist because Mexican men want to
protect their women from other men like themselves.
   ``You have to understand that this is a society in which the
woman is an object, something that can be carried away, taken,'' he
said.
   Ever since the Spanish conquistadores ran off with the Aztecs'
wives, the Mexican male has worried other males will try to
``steal'' his women, Santamaria said.
   That insecurity, says Santamaria, also leads the Mexican male to
try to conquer women who ``belong'' to others.
   Mexican writer Octavio Paz has said that to the Mexican, there
are only two possibilites: being the sexual aggressor or the one who
is violated.
   In his collection of essays, ``The Labyrinth of Solitude,'' Paz
writes, ``One word sums up the (male) aggressiveness, insensitivity,
invulnerability and other attributes of the macho: power.''
   Few men interviewed agreed with Santamaria's theory.
   ``It isn't machismo or a way to protect women from the damned
Mexicans,'' said Hector Castillo, an urban sociologist from the
National University of Mexico. ``It's just a space of greater
comfort for the women and children because the men are stronger.''

<TEXT>
   A 52-foot sport fishing boat with 10
people aboard apparently sank Thursday night off the Virginia coast,
the Coast Guard said.
   The Blue Goose, described as a Hatteras-type fishing vessel,
radioed at 9:30 p.m. that it was taking on water, said Coast Guard
spokesman Kenneth Crump.
   The Coast Guard sent a helicopter and two patrol boats to aid the
vessel, which reported its position as about five miles off Virginia
Beach. ``We're assuming it did go down. We haven't had any contact
with the vessel since 10:30 p.m.,'' Crump said.
   The helicopter from Elizabeth City, N.C., arrived on the scene
just before 11 p.m., and began its search. The patrol boats were en
route from the Little Creek Coast Guard Station, and a Navy vessel
was steaming to the scene, he said.
   Crump said the helicopter had not spotted any of the vessel's
occupants.

<HEAD>Yale Architectural Study Targets Des Moines As U.S. Model</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN STEFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yale University and a Chicago
architectural foundation have chosen a model for 21st century urban
development: Des Moines.
   Mario Gandelsonas, a New York City architect and faculty member
at Yale University, will spend much of the next three years studying
the city's layout and architecture. In turn, they hope to teach the
rest of the country how cities should grow.
   ``Every city wants to have little skyscrapers growing up,'' said
Gandelsonas. ``And there are secondary office boxes growing up in
suburbia without any order, producing total chaos in the landscape
without any rational organization.''
   Gandelsonas has studied the development of U.S. cities, but he
has yet to find one that could serve as a futuristic model for the
``city beautiful'' movement that started in Chicago during this
century's first decade.
   That movement arose from the Burnham Plan written for the
Columbian Exposition in Chicago during the early 1900s. The plan has
served as the blueprint for the expansion of that city until now.
   In looking for a new city to serve as a model for urban
development, Gandelsonas said he wanted a place in the middle of the
country with a strong architectural heritage, a riverfront and a
healthy economy.
   Des Moines, he said, ``was a natural.''
   ``Des Moines has a long tradition of planning, which very few
people know about,'' he said. ``Des Moines got into planning at the
turn of the century with Chicago. And throughout the century there
have been a number of plans. And there's a fantastic architectural
tradition in Des Moines.''
   Gandelsonas has been working with the city's artistic, business
and political leaders for several months to start the study. He led
a group of 10 Yale graduate students who spent several days taking
hundreds of photographs of Des Moines.
   Since then, Gandelsonas said, he has been constructing computer
models of Des Moines at the Chicago headquarters of the
Skidmore-Owens-Merrill Foundation.
   The work will end in 1992 with the publication of a book showing
how other American cities can grow by following Des Moines' example.
   Among his findings so far are that University Avenue, the city's
major east-west thoroughfare, serves not only as a physical dividing
line but also as a socioeconomic meridian for the city. He said he
is also impressed at the physical separation between the state
Capitol and downtown Des Moines and the views along several downtown
streets.

   Some legislators want the state to cash in
on credit cards as a way of balancing demands for increased spending
and lower taxes.
   A House committee on Thursday approved legislation that would
have the state issue MasterCard or Visa cards for a commission.
   If approved by the full House during the next week, it would be
sent to the Senate.
   This predominantly agricultural state of 804,000 residents could
reap in millions of dollars in extra revenue by sponsoring the card,
said Democratic Rep. Mark O'Keefe.
   Montana's chief tax collector, Revenue Director Ken Nordtvedt,
thinks it's a good idea.
   ``Every organization under the sun is doing this,'' he said. ``I
have two of those cards in my pocket right now from fraternal
organizations. ...
   ``And this being our centennial year, where there's a little more
sense of pride in Montana, the Department of Revenue is certainly
willing to administer such a program,'' he said.
   O'Keefe, who sponsored the legislation, said the idea came from a
constituent.
   ``At first, I thought the guy was crazy,'' O'Keefe said. ``But
the more I looked into it, it seemed it was not only legal but it
might work.''
   The card would have a special Montana design and would be issued
by banks, which would assume all liability and would process the
transactions, O'Keefe said.
   Each bank would pay the state a commission, perhaps 1 percent of
sales.
   The plan could mean up to $7.6 million a year for the state,
depending on the terms it negotiates with banks and how popular the
card becomes, O'Keefe said.
   Such groups as labor unions, wildlife organizations and the
National Rifle Association sponsor such ``affinity'' cards, O'Keefe
said. Banks like the idea because it gives them a broader base of
cardholders and more interest income.
   ``It's such a cutthroat industry that the affinity cards have
become big business for banks,'' he said. ``It increases the number
of people who want to carry these cards and all of these
organizations are making money on it.''
   O'Keefe, who believes Montana would be the first government
entity in the nation to try the idea, took his proposal to the House
Taxation Committee this week.
   There, a lobbyist for the Montana League of Savings Institutions
liked it so much he proposed an amendment to allow savings and loans
to participate along with banks.
   The panel questioned whether state funds would be at risk under
such a plan, as collateral for credit charged to the cards. But
O'Keefe said participating banks would assume all the risk.
   The bill, approved 13-5 by the committee, calls for half the
money generated by commissions to go to the state's general fund.
   The rest would be used for public schools, which must receive
more state money because of a February ruling by the state Supreme
Court overturning Montana's school finance system.
   Using the card to support public schools would only be right,
O'Keefe said, considering all the retired Montanans who spend their
summers in the mountains but desert Montana in the winter for the
Sunbelt.
   ``All of our snowbirds in Arizona all winter _ 1 percent of their
purchases could come back to fund their grandchildren's education,''
O'Keefe said.

   A Western journalist has been prohibited from
working for one month in China after he broke Chinese regulations
and went to Tibet following the declaration of martial law.
   Two other reporters were given warnings by the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs.
   The ministry revoked the press credentials of Robert MacPherson,
a Canadian working for Agence France-Presse, for one month as of
Wednesday, MacPherson said today.
   He said the ministry accused him of violating a rule under which
all foreign journalists wishing to travel in China must inform
provincial authorities of their plans 10 days in advance.
   MacPherson admitted breaking the regulations, but those rules
often are relaxed by Chinese authorities in the interests of news
reporting.
   The Canadian went to Lhasa, Tibet's capital, on March 8, the day
martial law began. Chinese authorities imposed the crackdown after
three days' violence between Tibetan activists and Chinese security
forces left up to 30 people dead.
   The ministry also warned Guy Dinmore of Reuters and Jasper Becker
of the British newspaper the Guardian, according to the Reuters'
Beijing bureau.
   Both men had applied to go to Tibet 10 days before they arrived
there but the ministry said they did not receive permission.
   While in Lhasa, Dinmore was fined by police for allegedly
breaking Lhasa city regulations after he took photographs of
demonstrations. Becker also was questioned by police.

   Two South Korean warships violated North Korea's
territorial waters Thursday, the North's official news agency said.
   The warships crossed into North Korea's territorial waters off
Tungsangot in the Yellow Sea between China and the Korean peninsula
before dawn said the Central News Agency.
   The two ships ``fled south in haste'' when North Korean patrol
boats tried to approach them, according to the agency, monitored in
Tokyo.
   It condemned the violation as a ``grave military provocation''
caused by the U.S.-South Korean Team Spirit military maneuvers.
   About 200,000 South Korean and U.S. soldiers are taking part in
the annual 10-day exercises, which began March 14.
   The communist North has charged the exercises threaten stability
on the divided peninsula. U.S. and South Korean officials say they
are defensive and vital to South Korea's security.
   About 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual
defense pact are taking part in the maneuvers, along with 30,000
American troops stationed in the United States and other Asian
nations.
   The Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 at the end of World War
II. The countries fought a bloody three-year war after North Korea
invaded the South in 1950.

<HEAD>Hearts Get The Beat After Being Zapped By Radio Waves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AM radio waves, which have brought so many
songs that touched the heart, are now being used to zap the hearts
of patients whose rapid heartbeats can't be treated with drugs,
scientists said.
   The radio-wave method of treating arrhythmia is safer than
electric shock or surgery, researchers reported at the American
College of Cardiology's annual meeting, which ended Thursday.
   The technique, being tried by doctors in San Francisco and
Europe, ``is like using a ball peen hammer instead of a
sledgehammer,'' said Dr. Douglas Zipes, a professor at Indiana
University School of Medicine.
   Like radio waves, alcohol also is being applied directly to the
heart by catheters _ thin, long tubes that are inserted through
blood vessels _ to halt various abnormal heart rhythms without
surgery, Zipes said.
   So far, Dr. Jonathan Langberg and colleagues at the University of
California, San Francisco, have used radio waves to control rapid
heartbeats in 10 patients whose abnormal heart rhythm couldn't be
treated with drugs.
   It failed on six others, four of whom then were treated
successfully with electrical shocks.
   Langberg said about 1 million Americans suffer from
supraventricular tachycardia, which can make the heart beat up to
200 times a minute, causing patients to pass out or suffer shortness
of breath, lightheadedness and occasionally sudden death.
   The researchers hope to use radio waves to treat the much more
serious rapid heartbeat called ventricular tachycardia, which kills
about 500,000 mostly older Americans a year.
   For now, patients who have a pea-size part of their heart zapped
to death with radio frequency energy must wear pacemakers afterward,
as do almost all patients who have their abnormal heartbeats fixed
with the older method of shock, said Langberg, an assistant
professor of medicine.
   But radio waves can be applied in much smaller, controlled doses
than electricity, making it safer and less painful, he added.
   Langberg hopes to use radio waves to slow rather than cut the
cardiac electrical connection that causes rapid heartbeats, allowing
certain patients to do without pacemakers.
   Dr. Lawrence Epstein, also at UCSF, and French scientists already
have done that successfully for one type of rapid heartbeat using
milder electric shocks.
   For arrhythmia patients who aren't helped by medication, open
heart surgery to cut faulty electrical connections that cause
abnormal heartbeats has been supplanted in recent years by catheters
tipped with electrodes.
   Dr. Melvin Scheinman, who heads the UCSF research team, pioneered
the catheter method seven years ago. A pacemaker to maintain normal
heart rhythm is implanted at the same time.
   In the new method, also being tried in Europe, a radio
transmitter is connected to the catheter, which acts as an antenna
to zap the heart with radio energy at 550 kilohertz _ ``near the low
end of the AM dial,'' Langberg said.
   The method destroys offending heart tissue with only 30 to 40
volts, so it doesn't hurt and can be done with local anesthetic
where the catheter enters a vein. The shock method delivers 1,000
volts and requires general anesthesia.
   Langberg said the radio wave technique also is safer than shock
because it doesn't reset the heart's electrical activity or risk
burning a hole in the heart.
   If the radio device can be refined to avert the need for
pacemakers in those treated with it, then ``many (supraventricular
tachycardia) patients may opt to have a one-time-only hospital
procedure in lieu of a lifetime of pill-taking,'' Langberg said.
   Researchers also have used alcohol to kill tiny parts of heart
muscle that cause ventricular tachycardia, Zipes said. Five patients
in Holland and two in Portland, Ore., have been treated by having
the alcohol released by catheter into the coronary artery that
supplies blood to the arrhythmia-causing spot.

   The United States has ordered a New York-based
Soviet trade official to leave the country in the latest round of
tit for tat diplomacy between Washington and Moscow.
   The ouster of Sergei Malinin, an employee of the Soviet trade
organization Amtorg, was in retaliation for Moscow's expulsion of a
U.S. Army attache from the Soviet Union last week.
   With two Soviets expelled from the United States and one American
from Moscow thus far this month, State Department spokesman Charles
Redman said Thursday that the U.S. government hopes there will be no
further expulsions.
   Redman, asked whether Malinin had engaged in wrongdoing, said
simply he was being declared persona non grata. ``We expect that Mr.
Malinin's departure will put an end to this matter,'' Redman said.

   Bankers and consumer-advocacy groups say price
collusion has resulted from the insurance industry's exemptions from
antitrust laws.
   ``Consumers suspect they're not getting their money's worth from
insurers,'' said Philip S. Corwin of the American Bankers
Association, one of several witnesses who called on Congress
Thursday to narrow the antitrust exemptions.
   In testimony to the commerce, consumer protection and
competitiveness subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, Corwin endorsed in general terms a bill by the
subcommittee chairman, Rep. James J. Florio, D-N.J., to forbid some
collective activities that insurance companies may engage in under
their antitrust exemptions.
   Several insurance companies and trade groups argued against
Florio's bill, contending it would lead to a reduction in the number

   The Food and Drug Administration has lingering
concerns about the safety, accuracy and privacy of home AIDS-test
kits as currently proposed.
   FDA Commissioner Frank Young told the House subcommittee on
regulation, business opportunities and energy on Thursday that
``caution at this time is prudent'' because of concerns about
technical feasibility as well as privacy and counseling.
   ``In this disease ... there is a death sentence given with a
positive test and without the appropriate interpretation and
counseling, the Food and Drug Administration is apprehensive that
some individuals might not only have major psychological concerns
but might do themselves harm,'' Young said.
   More than a dozen companies indicated interest to the FDA last
year in developing home AIDS-testing kits, all requiring users to
collect blood samples at home and send them to laboratories for
testing. The results would be supplied by mail or telephone.

   Residents hope normalcy will return to their
street now that a neighbor has been charged in the killing of a
13-year-old girl whose beaten body was found in his basement.
   Robert Golub, 21, pleaded innocent to second-degree murder in the
death of Kelly Tinyes at his arraignment Thursday before Nassau
County Court Judge Marvin Goodman. He was ordered held without bail
pending a March 29 court appearance.
   ``I hope it will be all over now, and the neighborhood can go
back to normal,'' said George Milano, who lives across the street
from the Golubs. ``I just hope they got the right guy.''
   The Golub family has been staying with friends since a few days
after the slaying when authorities asked them to vacate their home
in the quiet suburb of Valley Stream so police could search for
evidence.
   The Golubs tried to return to their house on New York's Long
Island over the weekend, but angry neighbors and relatives of the
dead girl taunted and chased them, forcing them to pack up and leave
again.
   The slain girl's parents, Richard and Victoria Tinyes, stood
quietly in a courtroom hallway as Golub was arraigned. The two
families live on the same street in the suburb.
   ``We have forensic evidence at the scene that points to Robert
Golub. ... All of the evidence we do have points to him,'' said
Nassau County Chief of Detectives Wayne Seay after the arrest.
   A palm print _ in the slain girl's blood _ found on the basement
doorway was identified as Golub's, a source who spoke on condition
of anonymity told The Associated Press.
   ``There are still a lot of unanswered questions ... there's too
many missing pieces that are not adding up,'' said Robert Player,
Kelly's uncle and spokesman for the family. ``However, there is a
fraction of relief that someone is finally behind bars.''
   Kelly was stabbed with a World War I bayonet, strangled, slashed,
kicked and punched by her killer, authorities said. The bayonet was
also recovered, said Seay. He said the investigation was continuing.
   Kelly was last seen entering the Golub house March 3. Her body
was found in the basement there a day later.

<HEAD>India Airlifts Supplies To Kabul, Rebels Blow Up Bridge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight tons of food and medicine was
airlifted by India into this capital, which is surrounded by Moslem
rebels trying to overthrow the Afghan government, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said today.
   Rebels meanwhile destroyed a bridge on the main highway linking
Kabul to the strategic eastern city of Jalalabad, the government
said Thursday.
   The anti-government forces have pressed in on Jalalabad in an
effort to bring about a quick demise of Kabul's Marxist government
in the wake of the Soviet troop withdrawal.
   The Afghan capital is surrounded by rebels trying to oust the
government of President Najib, and convoys carrying supplies into
this city of 2.25 million people are occassionally attacked or
delayed.
   The Indian supplies were flown in Thursday, said the spokesman,
who cannot be identified under briefing rules. Another shipment of
nine tons of supplies is being readied, the spokesman said today
from New Delhi.
   The Indian government announced earlier this month that it would
provide humanitarian and economic assistance to Afghanistan.
   India is the only non-Soviet bloc nation that maintained
relations with Kabul after the Soviet Union intervene militarily in
1979 to prop up its client regime in Afghanistan.
   The last Red Army soldiers left Afghanistan on Feb. 15 as part of
a U.N.-sponsored peace accord.
   Blowing up the bridge could signal a renewal of guerrilla tactics
rather than direct battle in the 18-day battle for Jalalabad. The
guerrillas have found it difficult to confront an army with air
power and long-range missiles.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani told reporters
Thursday that the bridge near Sarobi, midway between Kabul and
Jalalabad, was destroyed by explosives planted on the span. He said
the bridge was one of about 100 on the paved highway.
   He said three other roads, all unpaved and more circuitous,
remain open to military convoys between Kabul and the city, which is
75 miles to the east near the Khyber Pass.
   Moslem insurgents, who are based in Pakistan and also backed by
the United States, launched their offensive on the eastern city on
March 6. But they have not succeeded in dislodging government troops.
   Soviet troops completed their withdrawal last month after more
than nine years of intervention in a civil war that began with a
communist coup in April 1978. The Soviets continue providing
military supplies to Kabul's government.
   Amani said the guerrillas fired 2,000 rockets and artillery
shells at government positions outside Jalalabad in the previous 24
hours.
   No government forces were killed, but five soldiers and five
civilians were wounded, he said. He said 89 guerrillas, including
four local commanders, were killed in the same period.
   Soviet-made Scud-B rockets have been fired daily from Kabul
toward Jalalabad since the battle began, according to foreign
observers and residents of Kabul. They have a range of at least 175
miles.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said
Pakistan had grossly violated the U.N.-mediated agreement by
allowing the rebels to form an interim government on its territory.
They hope the government will soon take power.
   Shevardnadze also charged arms were being delivered to the rebels
from the United States via Pakistan in violation of the accord.
   He said many Soviet civilian specialists remain in Kabul as well
as the staff of a large embassy. ``Any attempts to encroach upon
their security will draw a most resolute Soviet response,'' he said
Thursday without elaboration.
   Reports on casualties and fighting around Jalalabad are
impossible to verify from Kabul. Guerrilla headquarters in Pakistan
have reported far lower death tolls for the mujahedeen than the
government.
   Thousands more Afghans have fled recently to Pakistan to avoid
the fighting, swelling a refugee population estimated at 3.5
million. About 2 million other refugees are in Iran.
   Guerrilla and other sources said the government imposed a 24-hour
curfew on Jalalabad to avert an exodus. Insurgent leaders said they
were reluctant to attack the city because of the civilian casualties
it would cause.

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Higher, Share Prices Off Marginally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar closed higher against the Japanese
yen Friday, while share prices fell slightly on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
145.42 points Thursday, shed 20.14 points, or 0.06 percent, to
finish the week at 31,568.52.
   The dollar closed at 131.27 yen, up 0.39 yen from the previous
day's 130.88-yen finish. The currency started trading at 131.35 yen
and moved in a narrow range of 131.27-131.43 yen.
   The market's key index started falling shortly after the start of
morning trading as market investors began reacting to an overnight
drop in the Dow Jones industrial average in New York, said Tatsuo
Kurokawa with Nomura Securities in Tokyo.
   ``Because the Tokyo market, which has been adjusting its price
levels recently, was not in an uptrend with stock-buying incentives,
the drop in New York stocks directly affected the market,'' he said.
   The dollar's firmness in foreign exchange dealings also
discouraged participants, Kurokawa added.
   In currency dealings, the dollar's higher opening in Tokyo
followed an increase overnight in New York, where investors bought
the currency after U.S. Federal Reserve Board Governor H. Robert
Heller indicated he backed a stronger dollar, dealers said.
   Heller, in a speech Thursday before the Richmond, Virginia,
Society of Financial Analysts, said using a weaker dollar to improve
the U.S. trade balance would result in rising import prices,
aggravating U.S. inflation problems.
   Allowing that ``much work remains to be done'' on improving trade
imbalances, Heller said that ``under the present circumstances, a
dollar depreciation is unwarranted and uncalled for.''
   After opening higher, the dollar remained almost unchanged in
Tokyo Friday as Japanese investors stepped to the sidelines prior to
the start of the Easter holidays overseas, said one dealer with a
commercial bank in Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The New York currency market will be open Friday, but most U.S.
banks and other financial institutions will observe a three-day
Easter holiday weekend beginning the same day, while European
markets will be closed for four days until Tuesday.

   Randall Dale Adams returned home to hugs
from his mother, flowers from well wishers, a job offer from the
mayor and word from Texas that a murder charge for which he was
nearly executed was being dropped.
   ``I couldn't have dreamed this. I knew I would be home, but not
this way,'' said Adams, whose 1977 conviction was questioned in the
12th year of his prison term by the movie ``The Thin Blue Line.''
   Adams was set free Tuesday, a few weeks after the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals set aside the conviction, saying prosecutors had
suppressed evidence and witnesses had given perjured testimony.
   In the film documentary, an inmate on death row for another
murder recanted his testimony against Adams and all but confessed to
the 1976 killing of Dallas Police Officer Robert Wood.
   About 100 people cheered loudly Thursday as the 40-year-old
suburban Grove City native rushed through an airport gate and into
the arms of his mother, Mildred Adams.
   He was presented with a daffodil lei, an Ohio State Buckeyes cap
and an Easter basket topped with a yellow ribbon.
   ``I feel happy, really happy,'' said Mrs. Adams, clutching her
son's arm as they left the gate. ``You're supposed to have a
resurrection around Easter. I guess this is it.''
   Adams fought back tears as he embraced Errol Morris, director of
``The Thin Blue Line.'' Another cheer arose minutes later when news
arrived that the Dallas County district attorney announced he was
dropping the case.
   But Adams, who appeared flushed and complained of feeling ill
shortly after arriving from Texas, cautioned against enthusiasm.
   ``I'll wait until I hear it from my attorney,'' he said.
   In Houston, Adams' attorney said his client's name has been
cleared and that Adams has been vindicated.
   ``I'm now satisfied the final chapter has been written,''
attorney Randy Schaffer said.
   District Attorney John Vance told reporters in Dallas that it was
unlikely enough evidence could be produced to retry Adams.
   ``It's almost impossible to find sufficient, credible evidence to
try a case that is 13 years old,'' Vance said.
   But Vance, who was not in office when the case was tried,
defended prosecutors' actions, including a legal fight earlier this
week that delayed Adams' release.
   ``The easy route would have been to release Mr. Adams
immediately. However, my obligation is not to the media or to play
the part of the hero,'' Vance said. ``My responsibility in every
case is to the victim, his family, Dallas County citizens and the
state of Texas.''
   Adams, who was unemployed before his arrest, said he had no
immediate plans, although he is mulling a job offer from Columbus
Mayor Dana Rinehart, who was among those greeting him at Port
Columbus International Airport.
   Rinehart said he will discuss what jobs are available with Adams
once he settles in at home.
   Adams, who in 1980 came within three days of execution before his
sentence was commuted to life in prison, said he harbors no ill
feelings toward Texas officials and gave Morris and his film partial
credit for his release.
   ``I still believe I eventually would have won. It may have taken
us some time, but thankfully ... Errol was sent to me by my fates.''
   Mrs. Adams agreed.
   ``I don't have any hard feelings for anyone. Randy's home,'' she
said, adding that she now considers Morris ``another one of my
sons.''
   Adams and his family planned to spend the evening at a private
gathering at Mrs. Adams home.
   ``It's going to take some time. We need time to have the family
together,'' he said.
   ``I've been standing in a twilight zone for the past 12{ years.
... I was in that twilight zone until the door opened. Thank God it
did.''

   Police removed and detonated a small bomb
that arrived in the mail at Montana Highway Patrol headquarters
after they were alerted by a secretary's suspicions.
   ``The bomb wasn't powerful enough to blow up a building, but it
could have seriously injured someone,'' Capt. George Olsen of the
Helena Police Department said Thursday evening.
   Col. Robert Griffith, the Highway Patrol's administrator, said
his secretary became suspicious of a parcel about the size of a box
of kitchen matches and addressed to ``Police Force, Capitol.''
   It arrived at his office Thursday afternoon.
   ``It was delivered to the mail room in the basement,'' Griffith
said. ``When the mail was brought up to us, my secretary looked at
it and felt it was a very suspicious-looking package. She said her
intuition or her instinct told her she'd better not open it.''
   The secretary, who was unidentified, took the parcel to state
Justice Department criminal investigators in the same building, a
block north of the Montana Capitol, and the investigators agreed the
package was suspect and notified Helena police, Griffith said.
   ``They came over and looked at it and they called the bomb
squad,'' he said.
   Police wrapped the parcel in a specially designed ``bomb
blanket,'' put it in a city dump truck filled with sand and took it
to a city-run auto salvage yard north of town, said Griffith. There,
police fired a shotgun into the parcel and it exploded, he said.
   Griffith said authorities had no idea who might have sent the
package, or about any motive.

<HEAD>Dollar Gains Against Yen, Share Prices Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar gained ground today against the
Japanese yen, while share prices finished lower on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, although the index started to make up some of the losses
from early trading.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
145.42 points Thursday, shed 20.14 points, or 0.06 percent, to
finish the week at 31,568.52.
   The market's key index lost 95.23 points during the morning
session mainly discouraged by an overnight decline in the Dow Jones
industrial average in New York.
   But it erased some of the losses later, as buy-orders from
speculative investors increased when the index touched it's low of
the day, said Kenji Ishizuka with Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.
   The dollar's rise against the yen also discouraged Japanese
investors, he said.
   Trading became thin as participants stepped off to the sidelines
in the absence of market-affecting news and before the weekend,
Ishizuka said. Volume traded on the first section was estimated at
650 million shares.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 131.27 yen, up 0.39
yen from the previous day's 130.88-yen finish. The U.S. unit started
trading higher at 131.35 yen and moved tightly between 131.27 yen
and 131.43 yen.
   ``Nothing was happening in Tokyo trading today. Hardly anyone was
participating from the beginning, mainly because of long weekends on
overseas markets for the Easter holidays,'' said a dealer with Daiwa
Bank in Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The dollar opened higher in Tokyo following its overnight
increase in New York, where investors bought the currency after U.S.
Federal Reserve Board Gov. H. Robert Heller indicated he backed a
stronger dollar, dealers said.
   Heller, in a speech Thursday before the Richmond, Va., Society of
Financial Analysts, said using a weaker dollar to improve the U.S.
trade balance would result in rising import prices, aggravating U.S.
inflation problems.
   Acknowledging ``much work remains to be done'' on improving trade
imbalances, Heller said: ``Under the present circumstances, a dollar

   The New York currency market will be open today, but most U.S.

   The State Department's second expulsion this month
of a Soviet official is retaliatory rather than punishment for
actual wrongdoing, the official news agency Tass said today.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman ``did not conceal that
the action was not prompted by any other considerations but by a
decision of the U.S. to respond to the recent expulsion from the
USSR of Lt. Col. Daniel Francis Van Gundy,'' Tass said in a dispatch
from Washington.
   Van Gundy was accused of secretly photographing military sites
and trying to enter a closed area. His expulsion came a week after
the March 8 arrest of a Soviet military attache who was accused of
spying by the FBI.
   The State Department on Thursday ordered Sergei Malinin, an
employee of the Soviet trade organization Amtorg, to leave by next
week.

<HEAD>Students Choose Work With Homeless Instead Of Beach</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen young people were heading home to West
Virginia today after spending their spring break as volunteers at a
homeless shelter in the Windy City rather than the beaches of the
Sunbelt.
   ``I knew I would get a lot more out of this than Florida,'' said
Jennifer Jackson, an 18-year-old high school student who traveled to
Chicago with the group.
   The 14 worked this week on the city's West Side at the Chicago
Christian Industrial League, which provides social services to the
homeless, mentally ill and substance abusers.
   They spent five days cleaning, doing maintenance work and meeting
people who use the shelter operated by the 80-year-old agency.
   The volunteers, affiliated with the Baptist Temple Church in
Huntington, W.Va., traveled by van to work in the nine buildings of
the league _ former warehouses west of the Loop that were donated by
several corporations.
   ``They came here to experience another kind of life, another type
of existence,'' said Richard Roberts, the league's executive
director.
   Renee Childers, 21, a sophomore at Huntington's Marshall
University, said the experience hit home.
   ``I think it is something to really make me grow up,'' she said.
``I didn't like how my life is going. It was at a standstill, and I
needed something to get me going.''
   She said she was impressed with the people she worked with.
   ``I was sort of afraid at first because of the homeless I saw in
Huntington,'' she said. ``I will look at the people at home
differently now. (These) people have hopes and goals. They want to
get their lives back in order.''
   The trip was the idea of Greg Creasy, the Huntington church's
youth leader who visited the shelter last summer as a member of a
singing group. He said a car wash and dinner was held to raise money
for the trip.
   ``We worked hard to get here and worked hard here,'' he said.
   In addition to cleaning off years of grease and grime in a
kitchen, the group cleared a basement of debris accumulated during
the decades the buildings were used as warehouses.
   ``They did a major service for us by cleaning out that area,
eliminating a fire hazard,'' said Roberts. ``It will allow us to
store more food donated for the homeless.''
   Roberts said the league helps about 400 people a day. It has a
full-time staff of 18, and depends on the homeless for much of the
work to maintain its facilities.
   The league is located in an area that once was Chicago's Skid
Row. It is now a focus of intense redevelopment, including an
upscale apartment complex two blocks away.
   ``It is not uncommon to see people lined up to use the soup
kitchens, while Jaguars, Mercedes-Benzes and Cadillacs drive by,''
said Roberts. It was something also noted by Creasy.
   ``There is a great need here,'' he said. ``And to go across the
street and see great wealth, it is sort of shocking to see that.''
   Roberts said he could understand the jolt the volunteers
received, coming from their middle class surroundings in West
Virginia.
   ``They were in the bowels of the inner city, working with
ex-felons, recovering alcoholics, and women who have been abused,''
he said.
   ``It was the most amazing trip I have had in my entire life,''
said Ms. Childers.

<HEAD>Rubella At All-time Low, But Still High In Young Adults</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reported cases of rubella have declined 99 percent
in the 20 years since a vaccine was licensed, but health officials
say many people who still get the disease are women of childbearing
age.
   Of the cases reported during a three-year period, 58.2 percent
occurred in people 15 and over, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
said Thursday.
   The statistics for 1985-87 did not indicate the sex of the
rubella patients, but the CDC noted that age group includes women of
childbearing age.
   ``The continued occurrence of rubella in childbearing-aged
populations suggests that potentially preventable cases of
congenital rubella syndrome may continue to occur during the next
10-30 years,'' the Atlanta-based CDC said in its weekly report.
   Rubella, also known as German measles, is most dangerous when it
attacks pregnant women, said CDC epidemiologist Dr. Paul A.
Stehr-Green.
   Though the main symptom of rubella is a mild rash for adults, it
can cause serious birth defects or fetal deaths, he said.
   ``The real danger of rubella is when a (pregnant) woman is
exposed to the virus,'' Stehr-Green said. ``It can cause serious
birth defects, including cataracts, heart disease, enlargement of
the liver and spleen and mental retardation.''
   The licensing of a rubella vaccine in 1969 followed a major
epidemic from 1962-64 in which 12.5 million cases were reported in
the United States and there were 11,000 fetal deaths.
   But the latest CDC figures show there were just 221 U.S. cases of
rubella reported in 1988.
   That amounted to 0.1 case per 100,000 people and represented the
lowest total since 1966, when the government began compiling
statistics on the disease.
   In 1987, the latest year for which complete figures are
available, there were 306 cases of rubella reported in the United
States, the CDC said.
   ``Though the numbers themselves are a lot lower, the proportion
of cases among young adults is increasing,'' Stehr-Green said.
   Statistics from Illinois, Michigan and New York City _ the only
areas that at the time reported rubella cases by specific age groups
_ indicate that from 1966-68, the last three years before the
rubella vaccine was licensed, people in the 15-and-older age group
accounted for just 22.9 percent of the cases.
   The Public Health Service, in its health objectives issued in
1980, set a goal of fewer than 1,000 overall rubella cases and fewer
than 10 congenital cases a year by 1990.
   ``Although the goal for (congenital rubella syndrome) has also
been reached, unacceptable morbidity is still occurring,'' the CDC
said in its weekly report.
   There was one case of congenital rubella syndrome reported in
1988, according to the CDC, but three already had been reported this
year through Wednesday.
   Stehr-Green said most of the rubella cases occurring now stem
from people failing to get vaccinated, though there are some cases
of the vaccine failing to work.
   ``There is some percentage of people who get the vaccine, and for
a variety of reasons, it doesn't take,'' he said. ``But this is more
an issue of failure to vaccinate rather than a failure of the
vaccine.''
   The government recommends that children get rubella vaccine when
they are 15 months old. Stehr-Green said adults who are not sure if
they've been vaccinated are advised to get the shot again.

   Government reluctance to make public an air
terrorism threat in Europe is bringing new calls from relatives of
the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing victims for disclosure of all serious
threats against commercial aviation.
   White House, State Department and Transportation Department
officials all attempted on Thursday to downplay the hijacking threat
against U.S. airlines in Western Europe. Still, some officials,
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner in particular, expressed
anger that it was released to the public in leaks to British news
media.
   But several relatives of victims of the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 over Scotland said they believe the way the government
handles terrorism bulletins warns diplomatic and military personnel
while keeping other potential passengers uninformed about risks.
   British investigators have concluded that a terrorist bomb
concealed in a radio-cassette player blew up the Boeing 747 over
Scotland, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 others on the ground
in Lockerbie, Scotland.
   The relatives, in telephone interviews, criticized government
failure to provide the public with information about terrorist
warnings, such as the March 16 memorandum sent by the Federal
Aviation Administration to airlines, airports and European security
officials.
   The FAA acknowledged the existence of the memo, but declined to
discuss its contents, which were nonetheless reported by the Daily
Express and other London news media.
   The newspaper said a hijacking by three Palestinians was
threatened during the Easter weekend. U.S. officials denied that the
bulletin contained any reference to this weekend. They also denied
the newspaper's assertion that U.S. diplomatic and military
personnel were warned of the threat.
   President Bush, in an interview published today, rejected the
idea of blanket public warnings, saying that could encourage ``a lot
of crackpots'' to call with threats.
   ``But it is prudent, and that's the existing directive ... to
allow the security people to know about these things and to take ...
as many precise steps as possible as relating to an individual
flight,'' Bush said in the interview with The Washington Times.
   Relatives of the Lockerbie victims say the lack of public
notification puts travellers at unnecessary risk.
   ``We don't think they should use the American public as live
bait,'' said Colleen Hermann, of Huntington, N.Y., whose brother
John Michael Ahern was killed on Flight 103.
   Bert Ammerman, a spokesman for the relatives of Lockerbie
victims, said the group is not calling for general public
announcements every time there is a terrorist threat.
   But he said that until ``prudent security measures'' can be taken
to protect American carriers throughout the world, a telephone
number should be set up for travellers to call to get information on
any threat against a flight they plan to take.
   ``I don't think that's going to paralyze the aviation industry,''
said Ammerman, of Demarest, N.J., whose brother, Tom, was killed in
the Pan Am bombing.
   Some of the relatives noted that Pan Am warned passengers of a
New York-Paris flight last week of a bomb threat and gave them the
option of taking another plane. Pan Am said only 17 of the 200
passengers left the plane, and 11 of those flew the same flight the
following day.
   Paul Hudson, an Albany, N.Y., lawyer who lost his 16-year-old
daughter Melina in the Pan Am explosion, said present security
policies amount to a selective warning system.
   ``What happens when this information is kept secret and yet is
passed around to literally thousands of security people is that it
is bound to leak out and hurt the credibility of security,'' Hudson
said. ``It then tends to sow panic even among those not directly
threatened.''
   Tim Cole, a Washington aviation consultant, said if all threats
were made public, they might become so commonplace that people would
simply ignore them. ``With 600 or so threats a year, you'd be crying
wolf all the time,'' he said.
   Officials say all but a handful of threats are hoaxes.
   Meanwhile, authorities in London, Frankfurt, Rome and Brussels
said security had been tightened after they received the FAA
warning, but authorities in Paris, Amsterdam, Athens and Madrid
reported no additional precautions.
   ``Travellers on U.S. air carriers should be confident that all
reasonable precautions are being taken to ensure that the highest
level of security exists,'' the FAA said in its statement Thursday.
   Skinner said the unauthorized release of an FAA bulletin
compromises intelligence-gathering efforts and ``jeopardizes the
lives of airline passengers.'' He ordered an investigation to find
out who leaked the bulletin.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Alfredo
Cristiani said he would accept peace talks with leftist rebels but
warned of any U.S. interference in El Salvador's civil war.
   ``We are willing to open doors to the guerrillas to incorporate
them in the Salvadoran democratic process,'' said Cristiani, the
victor in Sunday's presidential election.
   ``We are willing to work with the United States,'' Cristiani
added in remarks made available Thursday, ``but this partnership
must be based upon mutual respect and working together, not as an
imposition.''
   Although President Bush congratulated Cristiani on his victory,
some congressmen have said his right-wing Republican Nationalist
Alliance party, known as Arena, should demonstrate it has become a
democratic institution before more U.S. aid is provided. Human
rights groups, diplomats and others have linked Arena to
far-rightist death squads.
   The Salvadoran government has been the biggest recipient of U.S.
economic and military aid this decade, receiving more than $3.5
billion. Washington now provides $500 million a year in aid to El
Salvador.
   The president-elect said the leftist Farabundo Marti Liberation
Front ``must interpret for the first time the feelings of the great
majority of Salvadorans, that they no longer want violence, that
they want peace.
   ``If the guerrillas want to solve the Salvadoran people's
problems, they must come and express themselves publicly and
peacefully so that the people can judge whether what they offer is
valuable or not,'' he said.
   He made no specific proposals for talks, however. Before the
elections, rebels asked for a six-month postponement to give them
time to participate.
   The government and Arena both objected to the plan, and peace
talks never got under way.
   According to the final results, Cristiani won with 54 percent of
the vote in an election boycotted by the rebels. Francisco Merino,
also of Arena, was proclaimed vice president-elect.
   Fidel Chavez Mena, presidential candidate of the incumbent
Christian Democrats, received 36 percent of the vote. President Jose
Napoleon Duarte, suffering from terminal cancer, by law could not
run for re-election.
   More than 1.8 million Salvadorans were registered to vote, and
turnout was 52 percent, election officials said.
   In his remarks Wednesday, Christiani also said his administration
would oppose direct intervention by the U.S. government in the
nine-year civil war. The conflict has killed more than 70,000
people, most of them civilians.
   Arena was linked in the early 1980s to extreme-rightist death
squads blamed for the murders of tens of thousands of suspected
leftists. Former U.S. ambassador Robert White once called Arena
founder Roberto d'Aubuisson a ``pathological killer.''
   However, Cristiani contends his candidacy shows his party has
moderated its views.
   Cristiani said neither he nor his party are ``anti-North
American.''
   But he said ``if they want us to respect the democracies of other
countries, we expect that other countries respect the Salvadoran
democracy.''

   Children who are accident prone will probably
change, and likely needn't worry about suffering mishaps and
injuries for the rest of their lives, suggests a new study of more
than 50,000 school children.
   Also, the tendency to be accident prone may be preventable, since
it could result from foreseeable stresses _ growth spurts, family
disagreements, school pressures _ that are a typical part of growing
up, the study suggested.
   ``That is very good and optimistic news for parents, for
teachers, for injury control specialists and for pediatricians,''
says Dr. Mark Widome, chairman of the Committee on Accident and
Poison Prevention for the American Academy of Pediatrics.
   ``It means that we can look at psychological and environmental
influences that can warn us of increased risk and even things we can
change to decrease the risk,'' he said in a telephone interview
Thursday.
   The study looked at 54,874 school children ages 6 to 18 over a
three-year period in a Tucson, Ariz., school district. Researchers
recorded 8,429 injuries during school hours that were serious enough
to require a doctor's attention, to cause school absence or to
restrict sports participation.
   Seventeen percent of the injuries occurred to 1 percent of the
children, a significantly higher rate than could be expected from
chance alone, the researchers said in the March issue of the
American Journal of Diseases of Children.
   There were 574 children who suffered two or more injuries in a
single year, but only 15 youngsters suffered one or more injuries in
all three years, the researchers said.
   ``Most sustained only two injuries, and the vast majority of
injuries were clustered within a short time,'' said the researchers,
Dr. W. Thomas Boyce of the University of California at San Francisco
and Sue Sobolewski of the Tucson Unified School District.
   Injuries were most likely to recur among junior high school boys,
children engaged in athletic activities and youngsters attending
schools with longer hours or those that had alternative programs,
such as ``open'' classrooms or ``magnet'' curriculums, the
researchers said.
   ``Only an extraordinarily small group of children _ perhaps as
few as three in 10,000 _ seem to maintain an inordinate risk of
injury over an extended period of years,'' the researchers said.
   The study didn't cover why some children seemed to have clusters
of injuries, but the researchers theorized that stresses such as
family or social problems, or the onset of adolescence, could cause
the temporary accident proneness. More study could lead to ways to
prevent accidents in such children, they said.
   The study ``supports the widely held belief that there is not a
stable inborn personality trait called accident-proneness, that
accident-proneness is probably a state rather than a trait,'' he
said from Hershey, Pa., where he an associate professor at
Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine.
   ``States are something you have for a period of time, such as
when you're upset, you're having trouble in school, you're going
through puberty,'' he said. ``A trait is something you have all your
life.''
   Widome said that for most children, there are ``relatively brief
and transient periods when they're at increased risk for injuries.''

   A bus carrying workers to a nuclear plant
collided with a tanker truck on the coast of Veracruz, killing two
people and injuring 33, a government report said.
   The Notimex government news service said the crash occurred
Thursday in Nautla, a town 30 miles north of the Laguna Verde power
plant on the Gulf of Mexico.
   Witnesses said the Federal Electricity Commission bus was
rounding a curve when the driver apparently lost control of the
vehicle and slammed into the tanker truck, Notimex reported.
   The driver of the bus, identified as 35-year-old Alberto Ramirez,
and an unidentified electrical worker, were killed, the news service
said.
   The nuclear plant, Mexico's first, is scheduled to begin
operations later this year.

<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo said the leftist government should have declared a general
amnesty for political prisoners rather than just releasing 1,894
former national guardsmen.
   Meanwhile in Washington, congressional and administration sources
said Thursday that President Bush and lawmakers had agreed on a plan
to extend aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, through
February 1990. The aid was to expire this month.
   Critics have said extending aid would violate a regional peace
plan that calls for democratic reforms in Nicaragua in exchange for
the dismantling of Contra forces that have fled to Honduras.
   However, the U.S. plan includes a pledge to back the February
peace accord and eventual reintegration of the rebels into
Nicaraguan political life, the sources in Washington said.
   Through most of the Reagan administration, the United States gave
arms to the rebels. In February 1988, Congress stopped military aid
but continued sending humanitarian assistance.
   About 11,000 Contras now live in camps in neighboring Honduras.
   In remarks during a homily for Holy Thursday services in Managua,
the cardinal said the Contras should release any political prisoners
they hold now that the Sandinista government has freed the guardsmen.
   He also said it would have been best if the government ``had
decreed a general amnesty, bringing joy to the prisoners and their
families and thereby contributing to national reconciliation.''
   On March 17, the Sandinistas freed 1,894 former National Guard
members who had been jailed since the July 1979 Sandinista
revolution.
   The guard members served under former President Anastasio Somoza,
who fled Nicaragua two days before the Sandinistas marched into the
capital.
   However, the government denied freedom to 39 other former
guardsmen who served under Somoza, saying they were guilty of
heinous crimes against the Nicaraguan people.

<TEXT>
   Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's first
elected leader in more than a decade and the Moslem world's only
female leader, has presented the military with a ``medal of
democracy.''
   She said Thursday that the award recognizes the military's
decision to step out of politics after 11 years of direct
involvement.
   ``We are proud of our armed forces who gave national interests
precedence over personal considerations,'' the prime minister said.
   A plane crash killed military strongman Mohammad Zia-ul Haq last
August, paving the way for the first free elections since 1977. That
year, a coup engineered by Zia ousted Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, who was tried for state crimes and hanged in 1979.
   Several top generals and the U.S. ambassador died when Zia's
Hercules aircraft went down outside the city of Bahawalpur.
   Investigators say it was probably sabotage, but no definite cause
or suspect has ever been found.
   In a nationally televised speech, Ms. Bhutto also promised not to
break faith with the expectations of the people who propelled her to
power. ``We are determined to face every challenge with courage,
bravery and determination,'' she said.
   In 1940, seven years before Pakistan was carved from the western
edge of India, the nation's founding father Mohammad Ali Jinnah
promised his followers that the days of the British Raj were
numbered and formally declared independence. Pakistanis celebrated
that promise Thursday in what is called Pakistan Day, a national
holiday.
   Pakistan was created to give Moslems who felt maltreated by
India's majority Hindu population their own state.
   Reminiscent of colonial pomp, Pakistan's President Ghulam Ishaq
Khan arrived at Thursday's ceremonies in a gilded carriage.
   It passed in front of tanks, armored personnel carriers,
anti-aircraft weapons, long-range missiles and heavy artillery _ all
on display for the ceremonies.
   In her speech, Bhutto referred to the years of military rule
before her rise to power as an era of ``darkness everywhere.''
   ``There was a sense of want everywhere, clouds of pessimism and
helplessness were in all directions and there was tension on our
eastern and western frontiers.''
   Bhutto's left-of-center Pakistan People's Party won the largest
bloc of votes in general elections last November.
   The task before her government is formidable with a bankrupt
economy, ethnic unrest and an Afghan civil war that has sent more
than 3 million refugees fleeing to Pakistan.
   On Wednesday, Ms. Bhutto expanded her 23-member Cabinet to 41,
including her mother, Nusrat Bhutto.
   The elder Bhutto, co-chairman of the People's Party, won her
first election last November. She was named minister without
portfolio, several English-language daily newspapers reported
Thursday.

   A lobster who escaped the jaws of death when a
woman couldn't bring herself to eat him has found a home at the
Henry Doorly Zoo.
   The 24-pound crustacean called Clyde was the prize in a January
supermarket promotion, but the contest winner decided against making
a meal out of him and the Omaha zoo took him temporarily.
   A Clyde the Lobster Zoo Fund helped raise some $5,000 money to
keep the lobster in Omaha. At one point a man dressed as a lobster
stood on a downtown street corner and asked for donations, and a
radio station held a 28-hour fund-raising broadcast.
   Clyde was unveiled in his 240-gallon, $6,300 saltwater tank
Thursday. The zoo opens its 1989 season today.
   ``Everything appears to be fine,'' aquarium supervisor Kathy
Vires said. ``He eats, he's active, he keeps his tail tucked. Those
are all signs of a healthy lobster.''
   Zoo employees sometimes find him standing on his tail with his
claws open and extending above the top of his tank, she said.
   Zoo Director Lee Simmons said the zoo would like to establish a
larger cold-water exhibit. But for now, Clyde is the only cold-water
creature on display.

   Legislators often are accused of dealing
with pork in the budget, but pigs were among the few barnyard
animals absent from the Statehouse for National Agriculture Day.
   Cows, calves, goats, kids, ducklings and a turkey were among the
animals displayed on the Statehouse lawn Thursday.
   Inside the Capitol, people gathered in the Rotunda to sample free
West Virginia-grown products, including apples, country ham,
marinated chicken, potato chips, beef jerky and white and chocolate
milk.
   Outside, a barnyard aroma wafted through the air as hundreds of
kindergarten and preschoolers strolled around pens of live animals.
   ``We're doing it because it's fun,'' Agriculture Commissioner
Cleve Benedict said. ``It's fun for us and it's fun for the kids.
And it's all educational.
   ``You know, some youngsters, even growing up in a rural state
like West Virginia, live in a city like Charleston and think eggs
come from the ... store. They've never had a chance to pet a goat,
for instance.''

   A man with an insatiable appetite for
cocaine killed two women with a semiautomatic gun and wounded two
deputies and a hostage before killing himself during 10 hours of
rape and terror, authorities said.
   Eugene Thompson Jr., 20, of Littleton, was armed with a MAC-11
assault pistol when he broke into a woman's suburban Denver house
early Thursday and began his crime spree.
   The rampage, during which he raped two women, ended in a
gunbattle at a townhouse as 100 officers searched house-to-house for
him.
   Thompson opened fire on the two officers who burst into the
townhouse, hitting one in the chest and neck and the other in the
leg, authorities said. He then shot 18-year-old Jake Carper four
times in the back, went upstairs and shot himself in the head.
   ``A madman, it appears, is what we have,'' said Douglas County
Sheriff Steve Zotos. ``We were hoping it wouldn't end this way, but
I don't know of any other way it could have ended. There is just no
reason to this whole thing.''
   Thompson died at a hospital three hours after he shot himself.
   Carper, who lives in the townhouse, remained in critical
condition.
   Arapahoe County Deputy Arthur L. Hilton, 37, was in serious
condition with wounds to the chest. Deputy Daniel Thomas, 36, was
released after treatment.
   Thompson, a suspect in at least 140 thefts and burglaries, was
wanted on arrest warrants that were issued Monday for his failure to
appear in Golden District Court for probation revocation,
authorities said.
   He had been enrolled in a cocaine residence treatment program as
part of his probation for thefts but was kicked out after being
caught stealing, said Eugene Strauber, regional vice president of
the Cenikor Foundation cocaine residence treatment program in the
Denver suburb of Lakewood.
   ``He had an appetite for drugs _ mostly for cocaine _ that he
couldn't keep up with,'' said Lakewood police Detective George
McGlynn. ``And that's what led to this.''
   It wasn't known if Thompson was on drugs during his rampage _ an
autopsy was pending. But Douglas County Sheriff's Lt. Bill Walker
said, ``We know he had been using cocaine heavily in recent weeks.''
   The trouble began around 5 a.m. when Thompson broke into
47-year-old Beverly Swartz's house in Littleton, authorities said.
She called for help, but hung up before she could give her address.
Authorities traced the call but when they arrived she and her car
were gone. Her husband, Ralph, summoned from work, arrived at the
house and was talking with investigators when the telephone rang.
   It was his father, Oscar Swartz, calling for help.
   Thompson had driven the woman to her in-law's home outside
Littleton, broke in at gunpoint and tied up the three _ Beverly,
Oscar and his 68-year-old wife, Janice.
   ``He raped the younger woman downstairs, then executed her,''
Sheriff Zotos said. ``Then he executed the older one upstairs.''
   Thompson then stole a car, and drove about 10 miles to Douglas
County south of Denver, where he broke into a house, held a man,
woman and child at gunpoint and raped the woman, Zotos said.
   About 30 minutes after leaving the house, he crashed a stolen car
into a fence and fled, setting off the manhunt.
   During their search, police warned schools to lock their doors,
and told residents to stay inside. About 25,000 school children were
kept in their classes.
   ``What do you do if the crazy guy busts in the school? And I
don't know how to answer it. It's a shame it's got to a point in our
society where we've got to worry about this,'' said Bob Dye, Dry
Creek Elementary School principal.
   Officers tracked Thompson to Littleton, where he broke into
Carper's house and shot him and the officers.
   ``All (Carper) said was, `Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ! He shot me
and then went upstairs and shot himself,''' Arapahoe County Sheriff
Pat Sullivan said.
   The MAC-11 is a semiautomatic weapon that can be purchased
over-the-counter. Sullivan said there was evidence the weapon had
been modified to be fully automatic. He said the gun fires 32 rounds
and only five were left when the gun was finally recovered.
   A day before his deputies were wounded, Sullivan lashed out at
the sales of semiautomatic weapons in a nine-page position paper for
the state Legislature.
   ``Everything I say in this position paper is true. Our officers
are out-gunned by these weapons of war. These guns are designed to
kill and maim people,'' he said.

   A sheriff who had written a position paper against
semiautomatic weapons found his fears borne out hours later when a
man went on a rampage with an assault gun, killing two people and
wounding three, including two deputies.
   In the paper, Arapahoe County Sheriff Pat Sullivan said laws
should be tightened to control who can buy such weapons, and if they
can't be controlled, he urged the Colorado Legislature to ban their
sale.
   On Thursday, 20-year-old Eugene Thompson Jr. used a MAC-11
semiautomatic pistol to kill two women and shot the others,
including two of Sullivan's deputies, before killing himself,
authorities said.
   ``Everything I say in this position paper is true. Our officers
are out-gunned by these weapons of war. These guns are designed to
kill and maim people,'' he said.
   Sullivan said the MAC-11 can hold 32 rounds, and fire 10 times
faster than the standard .38-caliber pistol issued to all sheriffs.
   ``I am a western Coloradan who enjoys big game hunting and I
don't want to see anything that would hurt sport hunting,'' Sullivan
said in the position paper he wrote Wednesday. ``But we have to do
something about these weapons of war.''
   In the paper, Sullivan cited the January shootings in Stockton,
Calif., in which five school children were killed and 29 pupils and
a teacher were wounded by a man carrying a semiautomatic gun known
as the 56S, a copy of the Chinese-made AKM-47.
   ``This tragic event has stimulated city, county, state and
federal legislative efforts to control or ban these weapons of
war,'' Sullivan said.
   The California Assembly has approved a ban on 40 types of
assault-type weapons, and similar bills are pending in other states.
The Bush Administration temporarily has banned the import of
semiautomatic assault rifles. The MAC-11 used by Thompson would not
have been affected because it is American made.
   Sullivan said that although the Constitution gives citizens the
right to import, manufacture, sell and possess semiautomatic
weapons, there is also ``a burden to place some reasonable controls
on these weapons of war without abridging the sportsman's right to
legitimate sporting rifles.''
   Ted Strickland, president of the state Senate, said things might
not be so easy.
   ``What happens in the land of the fruits and nuts is not
necessarily applicable here,'' Strickland, a Republican, said. He
said the tragedy undoubtedly would trigger emotional reponses on
both sides.
   But as with previous gun-control measures, he said, ``there will
be an awful lot of heat generated, not much light and very few minds
changed.''

   The ailing Ferdinand Marcos received a bedside
visit from four of his former cabinet ministers who are under
subpoena to testify against the former Philippine president facing
federal racketeering charges.
   ``It was a sad reunion because of his condition,'' Marcos aide
Arturo Aruiza said Thursday at St. Francis Medical Center. ``They
introduced themselves, wished him well and encouraged him to fight
these ailments so he might someday return home. Mostly, they just
gave our president words of encouragement.''
   Marcos, 71, has been hospitalized since Jan. 15 with heart and
lung problems. He remained in guarded condition Thursday night.
   The former ministers were handed subpoenas Wednesday when they
arrived at Honolulu International Airport, and a fifth member of the
delegation, former Education Minister Jaime Laya, was arrested by
FBI agents on a material witness warrant.
   Laya, once head of the Philippines Central Bank, was released on
bail after relinquishing his passport and being ordered to appear
May 8 in U.S. District Court in New York.
   The visitors _ Blas Ople, former minister of labor; Estelito
Mendoza, former minister of justice; Conrado Estrella, former
minister of agrarian reform; and Sylvia Montes, former minister of
social services _ also were ordered to appear in court with Laya.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, are charged with plundering more
than $100 million from their country to buy art and real estate in
Manhattan. Mrs. Marcos is free on $5 million bail after pleading
innocent. Marcos' physical condition has prevented him from being
arraigned.
   Material arrest warrants or subpoenas were also issued for at
least five others, including five of the six former cabinet
ministers who had been scheduled to arrive in Honolulu Thursday or
today, said Ralph Girardi, assistant FBI agent-in-charge of Honolulu.
   ``After what happened yesterday (Wednesday), we don't have any
information that they're still coming,'' Girardi said. ``We don't
have any absolute word that they're not, but we're really not
expecting them anymore.''
   Earlier Thursday, Marcos received a visit from Philippine
Congressman Jose A. Rono, who is a former minister of local
governments, Aruiza said.
   Mrs. Marcos claimed the United States was working with Philippine
President Corazon Aquino in an effort to prevent former associates
from visiting her husband.
   ``These men come here to do a kindly act and they're going to be
arrested?'' Mrs. Marcos said. ``If Mrs. Aquino is so popular, why
can't they let a sick man go home? And why are they stopping
everyone who wants to see Marcos? America has become her hatchet
man.''
   Mrs. Aquino has repeatedly cited national security for refusing
Marcos' requests to return to the Philippines.
   The Marcoses fled here in 1986 when Mrs. Aquino came to power.

<TEXT>
   At least 11 people were
nailed to crosses and thousands of Filipinos beat their backs bloody
today as the only Christian nation in Asia commemorated the
crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ.
   About 5,000 people, including foreign tourists and U.S.
servicemen from nearby Clark Air Base, gathered on a rice field to
watch men dressed as Roman centurions hammer nails into the palms
and feet of Mario Castro and six other ``Christs.''
   The crucifixions have been an annual ritual for decades in this
village 40 miles north of Manila. They have become tourist
attractions in recent years, complete with stalls selling food, soft
drinks, straw hats, fans and other souvenirs.
   At the village entrance, the Department of Tourism posted a sign
saying ``Fiesta Islands,'' the theme of its current campaign to
attract foreign tourists to the economically pressed country.
   This year, the spectacle attracted seven ``Christs,'' all
voluntarily performing the ritual of having themselves nailed for
reasons ranging from atonement for sins and thanksgiving for favors
to requests for a bright future.
   In Kapitangan in neighboring Bulacan province, Luciana Reyes, 30,
had her palms and feet nailed to a wooden cross for the 13th
straight year. Another woman was also to have been crucified, but
she screamed in pain when the nails pierced her palms and the ritual
was discontinued.
   In Manila, about 3,000 union members and residents of city slums
held their own ``Calvary of the Poor,'' a four-hour series of
demonstrations with a march from the Senate toward the Presidential
Palace.
   They were protesting policies of President Corazon Aquino's
government, which they say favor wealthy businessmen and
multinational companies.
   At least two more crucifixions were reported in Ilocos Norte
province and one in Bataan, but details were not available because
of poor communication lines.
   To prevent infection, alcohol is poured on the crucifixion wounds
and sterile gauze is applied.
   The nails are stainless steel, extremely sharp and slender and
are kept in alcohol. Through years of practice, the ``centurions''
who hammer the nails have learned where to drive the nails to avoid
hitting bones. To ensure the smallest possible wound, only one
hammer blow is delivered to each nail.
   Today's rituals in San Pedro Cutud began with Castro, a
38-year-old bus driver and veteran of 10 crucifixions, carrying a
wooden cross over a 1{-mile route from the entrance to the village
to his makeshift ``Golgotha'' in the middle of the rice field.
   Behind him were men dressed as ancient Roman soldiers, including
two centurions on horseback, other costumed New Testament characters
such as Pontius Pilate, and about 50 hooded male zealots who drew
blood by continually whipping their naked backs.
   The crowds, many of whom carried cameras, yelled and pushed for
vantage positions during the two-hour crucifixions. Some women
shrieked and others giggled as they dodged sprays of blood from the
penitents' bamboo-tipped whips.
   First to be nailed was Castro, who was stripped of his white,
long-sleeved gown and left covered only with a section of white
cloth around his waist. He was followed seconds later by two other
men.
   Then, their arms and waists bound to the crosses with pieces of
cloth, the three men were hoisted up for a few minutes. They were
taken down and replaced on the crosses by the others, including Gary
Briones, 21, an auto mechanic from Manila.
   He told reporters afterward that it was his first crucifixion and
he decided to do it ``so that I will have a bright future.''
   ``My God, all this for a show!'' exclaimed one American as the
self-flagellants passed in front of him.
   Pamela Foster, a teen-aged tourist from England who came with her
parents, thought the entire spectacle ``kind of stupid. Christ had
to go through all this and bore all the sufferings so that we
wouldn't have to go through all this again. But they got it all
wrong.''
   Hundreds of other flagellants could be seen in San Pedro Cutud,
in Kapitangan and many other places throughout the country,
including vacant lots in Manila. The Roman Catholic Church
officially frowns on the practice in this premonately Christian
country but is helpless to stop.
   Most Filipinos commemorate Christ's suffering in less spectacular
ways, such as offering simple prayers in church. Some walk on their
knees in churches or barefoot under a hot tropical sun over steaming
asphalt or concrete streets.

<TEXT>
   William Bush, the younger brother of
President Bush, has agreed to work as a consultant for the Samsung
group, one of South Korea's largest congolomerates, a company
spokesman said today.
   ``A basic agreement has been reached and both sides are working
on details, including terms of a contract,'' said the spokesman, who
declined to be named.
   Under the contract, the spokesman said the younger Bush will
occasionally advise Samsung Chairman Lee Kun-hee on managerial
matters on a case-by-case basis.
   Samsung is a major exporter of electronics and machinery to the
United States. Washington is pressuring South Korea to admit more
U.S. imports to help reduce Seoul's trade surplus with the United
States, which reached $8.6 billion in 1988.
   President Bush visited Seoul last month for brief talks with
South Korean President Roh Tae-woo.

<HEAD>Fusion Claim Generates Hope, Skepticism</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two scientists say they have produced
controlled nuclear fusion through basic chemistry, a claim that has
evoked skepticism from other researchers.
   But some also expressed hope that a long-sought source of clean,
abundant energy may be on the horizon.
   Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton in England
and B. Stanley Pons, chairman of the University of Utah chemistry
department, said their electrochemical process has produced a
surplus of energy for periods of up to 100 hours.
   They cautioned that more research is needed to determine whether
the process will work on a large scale.
   ``What we have done is opened the door of a new research area,''
Fleischmann told a news conference Thursday. ``Our indications are
that the discovery will be relatively easy to make into a usable
technology for generating heat and power.''
   Hoping that will be the case, the University of Utah has applied
for patents.
   Edward Teller, director emeritus of the Lawrence Livermore
Laboratory and ``the father of the hydrogen bomb,'' said he
initially was skeptical, feeling that it could never happen, but,
``I am extremely happy now because I see a very good chance that I
was completely wrong.''
   Robert Sherman of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, a fusion
researcher for 14 years, said: ``Based on the sketchy information I
have, there's nothing to indicate they've really accomplished
anything.''
   In fusion reactions, the nuclei of two heavy hydrogen atoms are
combined to become the nucleus of a helium atom. The process
releases a tremendous amount of energy.
   Fusion occurs in the sun and in hydrogen bombs. But Pons said the
new process can be carried out in simple glass flasks at room
temperature.
   Heavy water _ water containing heavy hydrogen or deuterium _
circulates between a negatively charged palladium metal rod and a
positively charged platinum cylinder.
   The electrical current drives deuterium nuclei (deuterons) into
the lattice structure of the palladium. Pons says the lattice
structure holds the deuterons close together long enough for fusion
to occur.
   The two scientists say the heat generated in the experiment shows
that fusion has occurred.
   ``We took so much heat out, it cannot be accounted for in
conventional chemical reactions,'' Fleischmann said.
   The two said they have not measured the neutrons produced, and
that makes Sherman and some of his colleagues skeptical.
   ``We don't see that (the process) gets the nuclei close enough to
each other to interact,'' Sherman said. ``If they're going to have
fusion, they've got to show me they have neutrons of the right
energy and the right time.''
   He said he and others have used palladium for years to purify
hydrogen and ``nobody has seen such a reaction.''
   Teller said his experience with palladium makes him think the
process could work, and, if so, it ``will be very significant for
our knowledge of the solid state of metals and it may be very
important for our energy production.''
   Pons said he and Fleischmann developed the technique after 5{
years of research. They now are seeking a grant from the federal
Department of Energy to continue their research.
   For more than 30 years physicists worldwide have tried to produce
controlled fusion, but at a cost of millions of dollars and with
huge machines and lasers.
   Meanwhile, other scientists said the experiment will have to be
duplicated independently before the findings of Pons and Fleischmann
can be accepted.
   ``People are pushing cold-temperature nuclear fusion quite
vigorously these days. Like any science, this claim has to be
reproducable. If it is indeed there, it is quite a discovery,'' said
Chan Choi, a fusion researcher at Purdue University's School of
Nuclear Engineering.

<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz of Hungary met
today in the Kremlin with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for
talks that were expected to address Hungary's move toward a
multi-party political system.
   The Soviet new agency Tass said the focus of the meeting was an
``exchange of expertise and information about pressing issues of
socialist construction in both countries and the development of
cooperation in all areas.''
   Gorbachev and Grosz also were discussing foreign policy
questions, Tass said.
   Grosz arrived Thursday in the Soviet Union for a 24-hour working
visit.
   The talks are the first between Gorbachev and Grosz since
Hungarian officials declared their support last month for a
multi-party system. But Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth said after
visiting Moscow this month that Gorbachev approved Hungary's reforms
and does not oppose a multi-party system there.
   But Soviet officials are less positive about a multi-party system
in their own country. The Soviet Communist Party's Central
Commmittee launched an investigation of former Moscow party chief
Boris N. Yeltsin earlier this month after he was accused of
advocating a multi-party system.
   Yeltsin denies advocating the system, although he says the issue
must be discussed openly.

   A judge's experiment at a sink in his chambers
led him to acquit a man of all charges in the drowning of his
2-year-old daughter in a bathtub that had been plugged with a tennis
ball.
   Common Pleas Judge Raymond A. Novak took the tennis ball with him
when he adjourned to his chambers Thursday to decide whether Ernest
Walker, 31, of Pittsburgh, was guilty or innocent of involuntary
manslaughter and endangering the welfare of Lorrene Walker, who died
July 5.
   Novak said he put the ball in the sink and ran water over it. He
said the ball first went into the drain and later bobbed up, but
finally settled in the drain, allowing the sink to overflow.
   Police conducted a similar experiment before charging Walker. In
the police experiment, the ball kept floating and would not clog the
drain unless someone purposely used it to block the drain.
   Walker testified that he fell asleep with Lorrene next to him on
a bed. When he awoke, he said the child was lying on her back on the
flooded bathroom floor, the tub's hot water faucet was open and the
tennis ball had plugged the overflowing tub.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of bitter controversy, a gleaming and
renovated Louvre museum, crowned by a tall glass pyramid at its
entrance, is scheduled to open next week.
   For months, many Frenchmen and art lovers worldwide have been
holding their breath, waiting for a look at the high-tech,
ultra-modern facilities designed to turn a once-exhausting tour of
the Louvre's dark and dingy galeries into sunny joy.
   The six-year, $850-million overhaul will turn the Louvre into the
world's largest museum once the last of its 14 new galleries opens
in 1993.
   The pyramid entrance will be inaugurated next Wednesday by
President Francois Mitterrand and will open to the public on
Thursday.
   Visitors who once wandered in search of the museum's main
entrance won't have any trouble finding the new one. It soars
dramatically between the Louvre's two main wings, is set off by
three smaller pyramids and fountains illuminated at night.
   A graceful spiral staircase takes visitors down to a spacious
underground lobby where they will find ticket windows, bookshops,
restaurants, boutiques and a 400-seat auditorium.
   From below, the view is breathtaking: the ornate architecture of
the Louvre's twin towers looms against the ever-changing grays of
the Paris sky.
   Visitors will also find video screens indicating in several
languages which galeries are closed as well as the best routes for
finding key items like the ``Mona Lisa'' and ``Winged Victory.''
   With about 650,000 square feet of new space, dozens of important
works have been dusted off and put on display for the first time in
decades.
   Aficionados of 16th and 17th century French painters will
probably love the newly restored galleries on the third floor of the
Cour Carre overlooking the pyramid.
   Works to be shown there include ``The History of Alexander,'' a
huge, four-panel 17th century wall mural by Charles Lebrun not seen
in public since 1963. The 18th century ``The Meal at Simon's'' by
Pierre Subleyras, never displayed at the Louvre, will also grace the
walls.
   The guards will be dressed in chic new navy-blue outfits designed
by Yves Saint Laurent.
   The brainchild of French President Francois Mitterrand, the
Louvre project was plunged in controversy from the start. Problems
arose when Mitterrand picked celebrated American architect I.M. Pei
to design the project, bypassing the traditional architectural
competition.
   Pei's design _ a 70-foot pyramid of special thick, tinted glass
soaring between the Louvre's main wings _ was cause for further
outrage. Critics lambasted the clash of new and old, complaining
that the pyramid would turn the Louvre into a subway entrance or
``Disneyland annex.''
   Turning a centuries-old palace into a space-age museum was no
easy task. Before the pyramid went up, teams of archeologists worked
day and night excavating centuries of ruins under the courtyard.
   They unearthed thousands of artifacts as ancient as items from
the 13th century. Some of things they found _ animal bones,
porcelain dinnerware, cooking utensils, vases and pitchers, 200
silver coins dating from the French Revolution, and even common
latrines _ will be put on display.
   They will be used to tell the Louvre's history.
   The museum was built in 1200 by King Philippe Auguste as a walled
fortress to help protect Paris from English invaders.
   In the 1600s, the austere castle was made more livable but did
not become a royal residence until King Louis XIII made it bigger to
accommodate his ever-expanding court.
   A century later, after Louis XIV deserted the Louvre for more
sumptous quarters at Versailles, the Louvre declined. It was
gradually taken over by artists' colonies and turned into a museum
in 1793.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea's main dissident movement
today demanded the resignation of President Roh Tae-woo and radical
students hurling firebombs clashed with riot police to protest
government plans to arm police with semi-automatic weapons.
   The United National Democratic Movement of Korea, which
represents 200 dissident groups, said Roh must resign immediately
because of his March 20 decision to indefinitely postpone a
referendum.
   ``Since its indefinite postponement of the referendum proves a
failure to gain the public's confidence, the Roh Tae-woo regime must
step down immediately,'' alliance chairman Lee Bu-young told a news
conference.
   The alliance denounced Roh's decision earlier this week to issue
powerful semi-automatic M-16 rifles to police for self-defense
against protesters who attack police stations and government
buildings with firebombs and explosives.
   Lee charged the decision to distribute 13,000 M-16s to police was
a desperate attempt by the government to cling to power. He said
anti-government forces would not abandon their drive to oust Roh.
   ``The arming of the police with M-16s is an open threat to the
people. The decision must be rescinded immediately. The democratic
forces would never cease their fight against the dictatorship,'' Lee
said.
   About 1,000 radical students hurling firebombs and rocks battled
riot police in separate clashes at Sunkyunkwan and Hong-il
universities in Seoul to protest the decision to issue M-16s.
Students hurled hundreds of firebombs at riot police, who fired tear
gas at protesters.
   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo, who issued shooting orders,'' students
chanted. ``Down with Roh Tae-woo, who deceived the people.''
   About 500 students armed with firebombs and rocks clashed with
police at Dankuk University near Teajon in central South Korea,
according to Yonhap, the national news agency. Police officials had
no reports of arrests or serious injuries in either city.
   It was the second straight day of violent campus protests against
the M-16 decision. Riot police who clashed with the students were
not armed except for clubs and tear gas.

<HEAD>President Says D.C. ``Obviously Needs Help'' In Drug Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says the nation's capital
``obviously needs help'' from the federal government in its fight
against growing drug-related violence.
   ``I hope that we can find ways to supplement the police activity
in the area, because this city has become a high-profile city in
terms of violent crime,'' Bush said in an interview published today
in The Washington Times.
   Bush said he would let Mayor Marion Barry evaluate the crisis and
arrive at his own proposals to rid the city of its distinction as
murder capital of the United States. Most of the 120 killings this
year have been linked to the drug trade.
   The president said the city needs help, ``and that's one of the
reasons that (federal drug czar William) Bennett has targeted this
city.'' He said he is awaiting Bennett's recommendations.
   Asked about the sharp rise in the use of semiautomatic weapons in
drug-related crimes, Bush said the entire administration is trying
develop a more definite policy than ``just holding up those
imports'' of the weapons.
   The government last week suspended indefinitely imports of
semiautomatic assault rifles.
   Bush noted that one policeman was killed and another was wounded
in a shootout in suburban Alexandria, Va., Wednesday night with a
gunman who had taken five hostages after demanding crack cocaine.
The gunman, identified as an escapee from a Washington halfway
house, died in the battle with police, which took place a few blocks
from the home of the president's son Marvin.
   ``I want to find a way to help protect the lives of the policemen
that are laying their lives on the line for all of us ... as one did
last night,'' Bush said.
   ``I would like to add at that point, in the enforcement side, in
the penalty side... (that) we've condoned for too long those things
which we should have condemned _ in drug use, in tolerance for the
drug habit, in the media of glorifying the drugs _ the entertainment
media ....
   ``And so everybody has to think anew, including the president of
the United States. We are in that serious a situation.''

<HEAD>Poll Says Most Israelis Oppose PLO Talks, Palestinians Targeted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A poll published today said 56 percent of
Israelis oppose any peace talks with the PLO. Arab sources said
Palestinian moderates have been threatened with death if they
continue talking with Israelis.
   The poll by the independent polling group Modain Ezrachi,
published in the daily Maariv newspaper, contrasted with findings of
a survey published in December by Dahaf Institute, which is also
independent.
   The earlier poll said 54 percent of Israelis favored talks with
the Palestine Liberation Organization if it dropped terrorist
operations against Israel.
   The new poll of 1,251 randomly selected Israelis dropped any
reference to ending terrorism and found 56 percent said ``no'' when
asked: ``Do you believe there is room for negotiations with the PLO
and if so, towards what end?''
   Rachel Israeli of Modain Ezrachi said the reason for the swing of
opinion was because the new survey simply asked about talks without
the question of terrorism. ``Many people do not believe the PLO has
stopped their terror activities,'' she said.
   In the new poll, 8 percent favored talks with the PLO on an
independent state in the occupied lands, 17 percent endorsed talks
aimed at establishing a state in Jordan, 12 percent endorsed talks
on autonomy for Palestinians, and 7 percent said Israel should talk
to the PLO on other issues.
   The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percent.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat declared in December that his group was
renouncing terrorism and recognizing Israel's right to exist. The
statements led the United States to begin a dialogue with the PLO.
   Israel refuses to talk to the PLO, saying it is a terrorist
organization.
   In the West Bank town of Nablus, Palestinian sources said at
least seven Palestinian moderates have been threatened with death if
they continue exploratory talks with Israelis.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that on
March 17, two masked Arab youths claiming to represent the
Syrian-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine visited
the moderates and gave what they called a ``last warning.''
   The moderates, most of them Arafat supporters, were told to halt
meetings with Israelis and foreign delegations.
   The Popular Front, a Marxist PLO faction, is opposed to
concessions Arafat has made in a bid to start peace negotiations.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was quoted today as saying in an
interview with the Maariv newspaper that he still believes there are
non-PLO Palestinians available for negotiations with Israel.
   ``There can be leaders in the (occupied) territories who are not
connected with the PLO. There are among them wise people,
intellectuals, but I am not going to reveal their names because it
may bring them harm,'' said Shamir.
   Shamir vowed to continue a secret dialogue with Palestinians
before his trip to Washington in early April. He was quoted as
saying he would present to the Bush administration ``things which
perhaps have not been heard from me before.'' He gave no details.
   Also today, two Palestinians died of wounds sustained earlier,
raising to 407 the number killed since the Palestinian uprising
against Israeli rule in the occupied lands began in December 1987.
Eighteen Israelis have been killed.

   A defense psychiatrist testified that a
retired librarian was legally insane two years ago when he fired on
bystanders and police in shopping malls, killing six people and
wounding 10 others.
   William Cruse, 61, claiming temporary insanity on the night of
the crime, was and is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and has
brain damage, Dr. Walter Afield told the jury Thursday in Circuit
Court.
   Cruse is charged with six counts of first-degree murder, 24
counts of attempted murder and two counts of kidnapping in the April
23, 1987, shooting spree. Two police officers were among those
killed.
   Lawyers for Cruse do not deny he was responsible. Afield was the
first of several defense experts who were expected to try to
convince the jury that Cruse should be acquitted because he was
legally insane.
   Under Florida law, the defense has to show that the person was
mentally ill, that he did not understand what he was doing and that
he did not know the consequences of his actions.
   ``William Cruse is not a Ted Bundy or a Rambo. This is a madman.
He belongs in a mental institution,'' Afield said, adding that the
defendant had blocked out any recollection of his crime.
   Under cross-examination from Assistant State Attorney Chris
White, Afield admitted that his evaluation could have been affected
by the hunger strike Cruse was on when the doctor examined him for
1{ hours in December 1987.
   Also, the doctor said some of his background information was
based on newspaper accounts, some of which inaccurately described
the details surrounding the shootings.
   Eight witnesses have testified that Cruse was purposeful, precise
and without emotion during the shootout at two supermarkets in Palm
Bay on Florida's eastern coast.
   The trial opened last week. The prosecution is seeking the death
penalty.

   One person was killed and 10 were slightly injured
when a tourist boat collided with a barge on the Seine River near
Notre Dame Cathedral, police and fire department officials said
today.
   Sources close to an investigation opened by authorities quoted
the captain of the tourist boat as saying the barge was poorly lit,
while the barge captain said the other boat ignored a signal.
   Manuel Bessa, 28, a Portuguese tourist, was killed instantly when
a plate glass window swung shut from the impact of the collision and
slammed into his head, officials said.
   Police said the glass-enclosed tourist vessel was carrying about
500 people, mostly visitors, when it collided with the 2,500-ton
barge. The barge was in a convoy of five boats carrying sand.
   Officials said the injured were taken to nearby hospitals for
treatment of minor sprains and bruises.
   Divers who searched the river said it appeared no passengers had
been knocked overboard in the accident.

<HEAD>Teachers' Union Threatens To Withhold Midterm Grades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers won't file midterm grades with the
nation's second-largest school district unless their contract
demands are met and will strike May 1 if threatened with loss of
paychecks, a union leader said.
   ``Withholding grades from the district puts the pressure on,''
United Teachers-Los Angeles President Wayne Johnson said Thursday.
``It means if we do want to take action at the end of the year, it
will be very effective.''
   If teachers keep their grade reports from the school district,
students would be given their grades on union-supplied report cards,
Johnson said.
   Associate Superintendent Gabriel Cortina said Thursday the
district doesn't plan to withhold paychecks, which it threatened to
do last month when teachers attempted to withhold final grades for
the fall semester.
   But he said some pay will be deducted from paychecks of teachers
who don't turn in the midterm grades, which are due April 7.
   ``We have maintained that if teachers do not perform the
assignment of preparing the report cards, they will be docked,'' he
said.
   Teachers on Feb. 7 voted almost 9-to-1 to authorize preparations
for a strike. A second strike vote is scheduled April 19.
   Los Angeles' last teachers strike was in 1970.
   Union leaders said they decided to urge teachers to withhold
midterm grades because they believe the district is planning to
close the schools for the summer two weeks early in order to foil a
union threat to strike in June. The midterm grades would then be
used as final grades for students, Johnson said.
   Both Cortina and Bill Honig, state superintendent of public
instruction, denied there is such a plan.
   ``Nobody's talked to me about it,'' Honig said. ``And there's no
way they (district officials) could do that. It would cost them a
fortune.''
   The teachers and administrators have been bargaining for more
than a year over a new contract for the district's 32,000 teachers
and have deadlocked over the issue of pay.
   The teachers want a 21 percent pay increase over two years, while
the district has offered a 20 percent pay hike over three years.

   President Bush praised U.S. talks with the
Palestine Liberation Organization in an interview published today
and said he would try to convince Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir ``something good might come out of this kind of discussion.''
   ``I will tell him that the talks that we ... are having with the
PLO representatives there in Tunisia are good things, and we'll tell
him why I think they are good things,'' Bush said in the interview
with The Washington Times.
   Bush is scheduled to meet with Shamir, who refuses to speak with
PLO representatives, in Washington on April 6.
   Asked whether he would urge Shamir to join the talks with the
PLO, Bush told the newspaper, ``I don't know what I'll say to him
about that.
   ``But I'll say to him that we have got to move the peace process
forward. We may, by then, be ready with some specific ideas.''
   Shamir, in an interview broadcast today on the NBC ``Today''
program on the 10th anniversary of the Camp David accords which
brought peace between Israel and Egypt, reiterated his stand against
such talks with the PLO.
   ``It's not a question of talks,'' he said. `` ... For us it's a
question of life, a question of existence. The state of Israel will
not be able to exist together with a Palestinian state here in this
small country.''
   Shamir called for Palestinians on the West Bank to forsake the
idea of a separate state.
   ``I am convinced that the majority of the Palestinian Arabs will
come to this conviction that they have to live in peace with us, and
that the only way to live together with us is to negotiate, to talk
in order to achieve some peaceful solutions. And the time will come
for it,'' he said. ``We are ready.''
   But former Israeli Defense Minister Ezer Weizman, now the
country's science minister, said on ABC's ``Good Morning America''
he is convinced ``that we have to talk to (PLO Chairman Yasser)
Arafat.''
   Reminded that the Israeli electorate has rejected such
negotiations, Weizman said that with ``correct leadership'' and ``an
honest way of putting an issue, you can change the views and
opinions of the electorate.''
   Former President Carter, who brought about the Camp David
accords, said on the ABC program that there should be negotiations
with Arafat ultimately.
   But, he added, ``I think the first step will have to be direct
talks between the Israelis and Palestinian leaders chosen in the
West Bank and Gaza who have the full support and public endorsement
of the PLO, including Arafat.''
   In Tunis on Wednesday, U.S. and PLO representatives held their
first meeting since Bush became president.
   Arafat said Thursday that the 4{-hour meeting between U.S.
Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau and Yasser Abed-Rabbo of the PLO
executive committee was positive.
   ``There is a mutual interest and intention to lead this dialogue
to success,'' Arafat said.
   Bush took that view in the interview, saying that in his meeting
with Shamir ``I will endeavor to convince the prime minister that
something good might come out of this kind of discussion.''
   The Tunis meeting was the second formal meeting since talks began
in December, after Arafat publicly renounced terrorism and
recognized Israel's right to exist. There was no indication whether
a third meeting was scheduled, but the PLO chief's mood suggested
the dialogue will continue.

<TEXT>
   A newspaper said today that 14 days before the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 a U.S. agency warned that people posing
as police had questioned TWA staff members in West Germany about
transporting explosives.
   The Independent said the warning by the Federal Aviation
Administration was the fourth involving a potential terrorist attack
before the Dec. 21 bombing that killed 270 people.
   The flight, which orignated in Frankfurt, West Germany, and
changed planes at London's Heathrow airport, was blown up over
Scotland, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground.
Investigators say the New York-bound plane was destroyed by a bomb
hidden in a radio-cassette player.
   It said the FAA alerted airports, airlines and governments after
people posing as police twice asked American employees of TWA at the
Frankfurt airport how U.S. carriers transported explosives,
detonators and pistols.
   The newspaper said the Dec. 7 FAA bulletin was disclosed in
Washington by a House of Representatives transportation
subcommittee, which has been holding hearings on the Lockerbie
bombing.
   Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., chairwoman of the House Government
Operations subcommittee on transportation, on Sunday released an
analysis of 33 FAA bulletins on airline security, including one on
the TWA incident. The bulletins were issued from Jan. 1, 1988 to
Feb. 16, 1989.
   The Independent's front-page report was accompanied by a
reproduction of part of the FAA bulletin. It read: ``FAA Bulletin
21: two attempts to test Frankfurt security.''
   The bulletin continued: ``In an FAA bulletin dated Dec. 7, 1988,
the FAA described `two incidents that may indicate attempts to test
security procedures of a U.S. carrier operating from Frankfurt
International Airport.'
   ``On at least two occasions, individuals claiming phony law
enforcement status sought information from TWA on procedures for
transporting pistols, explosives and a detonator. In one incident
the man asked his questions at the TWA ticket counter. Apparently,
no attempt was made to detain and question him.
   ``The FAA noted that `the incidents occurred within a few days of
each other. There is a possibility they are related,''' the bulletin
said.
   The paper quoted the British Department of Transport, which
received other FAA alerts before the bombing, as refusing to say if
it had received the Dec. 7 warning.
   ``The West Germans said they had not been sent a copy,'' the
paper said.
   FAA officials were not immediately available for comment.
   The newspaper said the warning followed one the FAA issued after
the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki, Finland, was told on Dec. 5 that an
attempt would be made to bomb a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to the
United States in the next two weeks.
   Anti-terrorist officers found a radio-cassette bomb in an alleged
terrorist hideout at the end of October. The newspaper said the
Department of Transport issued two warnings on the bomb but did not
mail them until the second week of January.
   West Germany issued details and pictures of the bomb in
mid-November to Western countries and U.S. airlines.

<HEAD>Family of Marine Who Died in Desert Files Claim Against Marines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Marine Corps faces a $1.25 million claim
in the death of a Marine who was accidentally left behind in a
California desert during a training exercise.
   The family of Lance Cpl. Jason Rother filed the claim directly
with U.S. Marine Commandant Gen. Alfred M. Gray in Washington, D.C.,
on Wednesday, said family attorney James Schwebel.
   The claim seeks $1 million for wrongful death and $250,000 for
emotional distress suffered by Cecilia King of Minneapolis, Rother's
mother, Schwebel said.
   Mrs. King said Thursday night that she wanted the claim filed
``because I lost my son and it's the Marine Corps' fault.''
   Schwebel said Mrs. King suffered ``intense emotional distress''
during the week that the Marines ``failed to conduct an adequate
search and then actually called off the search for him.''
   Under federal law, Schwebel said, a party presenting a claim
against any agency of the U.S. government must first file it with
the particular agency. ``It's only when the agency denies the claim
that a person has a right to then file suit,'' Schwebel said.
``We're hoping this won't have to go that far.''
   A spokeswoman with the Marines in Washington said there would be
no immediate comment on the claim.
   Rother, 19, died of dehydration after he was left behind in
scorching heat in the Mojave Desert near Twentynine Palms, Calif.,
last August and was not missed by his superiors for two days. His
body was not found until December.
   Three Marines were court-martialed and found guilty of
negligence, although not of acting maliciously. Four higher officers
were reprimanded and removed from their commands.
   The most serious punishment was given to First Lt. Allen Lawson,
of Flint, Mich., who was sentenced to four months in the brig and
then was to be dismissed from the Corps.
   A report by the Corps after its investigation into the case
blamed the death on a ``total breakdown'' in accountability.

<TEXT>
   Peace talks arranged by the Arab League
failed to halt fighting between Christian and Moslem troops today,
and the United States announced it is withdrawing a military
training team from Lebanon.
   Fighting between Christian army units and Druse militiamen and
their Syrian backers killed 81 people this month. Police said 15
died in the past 24 hours.
   The Arab League sent Kuwait's ambassador to Syria, Ahmed Jassem,
to meet today with Gen. Michel Aoun, commander of the 20,000-member
Christian force and leader of the Christian Cabinet in Lebanon's
splintered government.
   Jassem later met with acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, chief of
the rival Moslem Cabinet battling for control of Lebanon.
   At a news conference after meeting Jassem, Aoun accused Syria of
seeking to ``reduce Lebanon to ashes.''
   The Syrian envoy said, ``Such a solution cannot be achieved in
one hour of talks.' Later, he refused to comment on a meeting with
Hoss in West Beirut.
   With no sign of an early breakthrough, the U.S. Embassy announced
it is pulling out three American officers sent in 1983 to train
Lebanese officers to use U.S. equipment bought earlier that year.
   ``We are withdrawing the technical assistance team at the Defense
Ministry as part the embassy's policy of reducing American personnel
due to the current situation,'' said a spokesman who declined to be
named.
   The spokesman denied Arab news reports that two of the Americans
were wounded in random artillery and rocket fire earlier this week.
   The embassy suspended consular services to non-Americans on
Wednesday.
   When Jassem was in Beirut on Tuesday, radio stations said Aoun
gave him a letter asking Syrian President Hafez Assad to withdraw
his 40,000 troops from Lebanon. Aoun and other Christian leaders say
the Syrians have failed in the peacekeeping task with which the Arab
League entrusted them in 1976.
   The Christians also bitterly criticize Syrian support for
Lebanese Moslems and leftists.
   Voice of the Nation, a radio station based in Moslem west Beirut,
said Aoun also sent a letter to President Bush requesting ``American
pressure on Israel to withdraw from south Lebanon.''
   Israel and allied Christian militiamen control a self-proclaimed
6-to-10-mile ``security zone'' in south Lebanon, to guard against
cross-border guerrilla raids on Israel.
   The day after Aoun sent his letters, Syrian army gunners joined
militiamen of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt in shelling the country's
main Christian communities. About 1 million Christians live in a
crescent-shaped, 310-square-mile enclave that includes Christian
east Beirut.
   The prestigious daily newspaper An-Nahar said today the United
States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China were considering
making a joint demand for withdrawal of all non-Lebanese troops from
Lebanon. It did not elaborate.
   Charles Redman, U.S. State department spokesman, says all foreign
troops should be withdrawn, except United Nations peacekeepers in
south Lebanon.
   The lastest round of fighting in Lebanon began after Aoun's
forces blockaded illegal ports used by Moslem militias to import
military equipment and supplies sold in regions they control.

   President Bush nailed down the first plank of
his emerging foreign policy by achieving a rare agreement with
Congress to extend aid to the Contra rebels and support Central
American peace efforts.
   Congressional and administration sources said the accord, in the
works for the past month, came together after a series of meetings
Thursday between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Democrats
and Republicans on both sides of the Capitol.
   Bush was to announce the two-page policy agreement in a White
House appearance today with congressional leaders. Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said the president met with Baker this morning
before the congressional group to finalize the language.
   ``We anticipate it will be finally approved at this meeting''
with the bipartisan congressional leaders, Fitzwater said. ``They
have been working on this and there are some changes.''
   As of Thursday night, the accord called for Congress to extend
aid to the anti-Sandinista Contra rebels, now scheduled to end after
this month, through Feb. 28, 1990. In exchange, the administration
pledges to support peace efforts of the five Central American
presidents and the eventual reintegration of the rebels into
Nicaraguan political life.
   Contra supporters say the continued presence of the 11,000
fighters along the Nicaraguan border with Honduras will maintain
pressure on the leftist Sandinista government to restore political
freedoms and hold free elections early next year.
   While the agreement mentioned no specific figure for continued
aid to the rebels, money was to flow at the current rate of about $4
million a month, putting the aid package at roughly $40 million.
   The presidents of Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala
and Nicaragua agreed in February to renew their peace efforts and
pledged to come up with a plan by mid-May to disband the Contra
force and for the rebels to be reintegrated into Nicaragua as
political freedoms are re-established.
   All new aid to the Contras must remain consistent with that
agreement, the accord stipulates.
   For the president, the agreement marked a significant step toward
his promise of a bipartisan foreign policy and was a welcome
accomplishment in the face of growing criticism that his
administration has been slow to get off the ground. Reviews of
policy on arms control, Soviet relations and the Middle East remain
uncompleted.
   The accord also represented an attempt to make a clean break from
the past polarization over Nicaragua, which plagued President
Reagan's relations with Capitol Hill throughout his two terms.
   ``We are trusting the administration, and they are trusting us,''
said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis. ``I do think the administration is
legitimate on this.''
   A key to the agreement was the insertion by Obey of a provision
that will allow any one of four congressional committees involved in
foreign affairs to cut off the rebels' aid after November if they
believe the presence of the Contras is harming regional peace
efforts.
   Another provision stipulates that aid will end automatically
should the Contras engage in military attacks or cross-border
incursions, or commit human rights violations. The package also says
the aid money can be used for ``regional relocation'' of the rebels.
   Baker won praise from lawmakers for his patience and
forthrightness during lengthy meetings with all sides on the
divisive issue, and for his non-ideological approach. Most described
Baker as someone who came to Congress not to sell a policy, but to
find one.
   ``There's no question that he wanted to find the center of
gravity and rest his policy on it,'' said Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C.,
a moderate Democrat who has been part of a group of ``swing'' voters
on Contra aid in the past. ``He has been trying to build a policy
based on political reality.''
   In Baker's early forays to the Capitol, he presented lawmakers
with a secret 10-page policy statement that included a timetable for
democratization steps in Nicaragua, along with rewards and
punishments the United States could mete out at each juncture.
   In the end, he was able to secure agreement only on a two-page
statement of broad goals which alluded to the need for carrots and
sticks to move the Sandinista government toward democracy, but which
eliminated most specifics.
   Much of the two-page U.S. policy statement, which had been
stamped ``Secret'' and kept under close wraps by Baker, consisted of
broad and general policy pronouncements reaffirming democratic goals
for the region. Missing from the document were the kinds of harsh
denunciations of the Sandinistas that characterized Reagan
administration rhetoric.
   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros said the accord ``will be a
positive element that will strengthen the possibility of achieving
democratization in Nicaragua, and peace.''

   The captain of a Japanese tanker that helped rescue
Vietnamese refugees from a sinking boat said he radioed three nearby
ships for help but that they ignored his request, according to a
document obtained today.
   Survivors of the accident on March 8 say that 130 of the refugees
died when the boat sank after colliding with the tanker in the South
China Sea.
   But the tanker's log said that waves created by its propeller
capsized the boat which was in distress before the tanker arrived on
the scene.
   The accident went unreported in Japan until the 35 survivors of
the accident arrived in Yokohama on Monday.
   ``We radioed a mayday call to three large vessels between three
and five nautical miles from our ship, but there was no response,''
Yasuo Kawamura, captain of the Nissei-Maru tanker, wrote in his log.
A copy of the log was made available to The Associated Press today.
   The Maritime Safety Agency said it is investigating the accident,
the latest in a series involving the growing number of Vietnamese
fleeing political repression and economic hardship in their homeland.
   The refugees, known as boat people, risk piracy and disaster in
hopes of achieving asylum in other countries.
   Survivors and the captain have given different accounts of the
accident, which occurred between Malaysia and Vietnam.
   Survivors said 165 Vietnamese left Long An in southern Vietnam
aboard the 32-foot-long wooden boat on March 4, bound for Malaysia.
   They said their boat capsized and sank after colliding with the
propeller of the Nissei-Maru while seeking assistance from the
tanker.
   ``The tanker came very close to our boat, and the waves pushed us
into the ship,'' survivor Chan Kin Kan told the Japan Broadcasting
Corp. ``Our boat capsized. The children and others trapped in the
boat were drowned.''
   Kawamura's log, however, says that about 40 people were first
sighted on the fishing vessel, which appeared to be in distress. In
the process of rescuing the Vietnamese, their small wooden boat
drifted behind the 239,000-ton tanker and was capsized by strong
waves, he wrote.
   Hampered in its rescue effort by strong winds and ocean currents,
the Nissei-Maru asked for help at least four times from three nearby
vessels, including a tanker and a container ship, but they didn't
reply, Kawamura wrote.
   The Nissei-Maru conducted a seven-hour search, he said, and then
proceeded to Singapore, where the refugees were refused entry. They
were brought to Yokohama on another Japanese vessel after Japan
granted them entry.

   DANVILLE, Ill. _ Police were hunting for one or more robbers who
fatally shot a teen-age pizzeria employee and critically wounded the
restaurant's manager.
   Tammy Erwin, 18, a student at Bismarck-Henning High School in
Bismarck, was killed in the robbery at Monical's Pizza, police said.
Robert Smith, 29, of Danville, was listed in critical condition
today at Carle Foundation Hospital in Urbana.
   The victims were found by someone making a delivery to the
restaurant Thursday morning, said Danville Police Investigator Larry
Thomason. He said the restaurant probably closed about 11 p.m.
Wednesday.
   Cash was missing from the register but Thomason did not disclose
how much.
   Police had no solid leads, he said. ``We're just interviewing
witnesses and-or people who might have been in the area.''

   Hoisting crosses to symbolize the
plight of political detainees, protesters marched through Durban on
Good Friday. Some visited a sick prisoner who has not eaten for 35
days to protest his detention.
   The protesters visited Sandil Thusi at a hospital, where doctors
said his hunger strike could leave him blind and brain damaged.
Thusi has conducted the longest fast of 600 black detainees who
stopped eating for varying periods since January, demanding they be
freed or allowed to stand trial.
   Hunger strikers ``are being crucified for the truth,'' the Rev.
Wilfred Napier, president of the Southern African Catholic Bishops'
Conference, told an ecumenical church service held on Good Friday in
solidarity with the detainees. ``They are suffering for their
God-given rights,'' Napier told 1,000 people at the service,
including anti-apartheid leaders and U.S. and West German diplomats.
   South Africa's white-led government says it has authorized the
release of 580 detainees, but human rights groups say several
hundred activists remain held without charge.
   After the service, the crowd marched through the port city's
business district to an Anglican church. Two men hauled a large
wooden cross at the head of the procession. About 70 others carried
small crosses in their hands.
   Some of the protesters then delivered flowers to St. Aidan's
Hospital for Thusi, and about 10 of the marchers walked past police
guards into his room and sang an anti-apartheid anthem until they
were evicted.
   Seven journalists at the hospital, including television crews
from CBS and WTN, were taken to a police station for questioning.
Their video tapes were confiscated, one of the reporters said.
   The Law and Order Ministry said on Friday that Thusi's status
would not be reconsidered until he starts eating.
   Thusi, a 26-year-old university researcher, reportedly has lost
57 pounds, about one-third of his weight, during the fast to protest
his nine-month detention without trial. He underwent surgery
Thursday for an ear infection.
   Doctors have attached an intravenous drip to his arm, which
supplies some nutrition. They say his condition is critical.

<HEAD>Strong Gain in Personal Income, Modest Rise in Spending</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans' personal income increased a strong 1
percent in February while spending rose at half that pace, as people
diverted more of their earnings into savings, the government
reported today.
   The Commerce Department said income rose to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $4.32 trillion last month, following a robust revised
gain of 1.7 percent in January.
   Consumer spending, meanwhile, rose 0.5 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $3.38 trillion in February after increasing
a revised 0.4 percent in January.
   Most of the gain in personal consumption expenditures, which
include virtually all consumer spending except interest payments on
debt, came in increased spending for services. Analysts said that
was partly a reflection of an upturn in heating bills last month
after January's mild weather.
   Spending on services rose 1 percent last month, while purchases
of non-durable goods edged up 0.1 percent and spending on durable
goods declined 0.3 percent, held back in part by slow car sales.
   Most analysts expect gains in income and spending to slow this
year in response to a campaign by the Federal Reserve Board to nudge
up interest rates and relieve inflationary pressures on the economy.
   Other government reports for February have suggested an economic
slowdown already may be setting in, with declines recorded in retail
sales, housing construction, factory operating rates and orders for
durable goods.
   Last month's changes in income and spending bolstered the
personal savings rate _ savings as a percentage of after-tax income
_ to 5.9 percent from 5.4 percent in January. February's rate
matched the savings level set in April 1986 and hasn't been
surpassed since May 1985, when the rate was 6.4 percent.
   February's increase in personal income included a large increase
in farm subsidy payments. Excluding that effect, income rose 0.7
percent last month.
   Disposable, or after-tax, income increased 1.1 percent in
February after a 1.7 percent gain a month earlier.
   Wages and salaries, a key component of personal income, rose 0.6
percent to $2.57 trillion in February following a 1.1 percent gain
in January.

   A couple who take in former psychiatric
patients as boarders successfully challenged a town zoning rule
limiting the number of unrelated people living in the same house.
   The New York state Court of Appeals, the state's top court, on
Thursday threw out a Long Island town's zoning law that restricted
the number of unrelated people living together, because the town did
not also restrict the number of related people who could live
together.
   ``I'm glad it's all over. It's been a long, drawn-out thing,''
said Rose Ann Baer of Brookhaven, who challenged the zoning ruling
along with her husband, Steve.
   The Baers, who have a Suffolk County license to run a rooming
house, were told in 1984 that they were in violation of town rules
nonetheless, because four women lived in the home along with the
couple's two children.
   The town's zoning law said no more than four unrelated people
could live under the same roof in a single-family district.
   Two women currently live in the home with the Baers, Ms. Baer
said.
   Her lawyer, Jane Reinhardt, said she was pleased with the
four-paragraph decision but disappointed with its brevity.
   ``I wish they had said some kind of socially conscious thing
about the need to help the elderly and disabled,'' Reinhardt said.
   Edwin Crawford, counsel for the state Association of Towns, said
the decision should make communities look more carefully at their
zoning laws. He predicted the decision wouldn't lead to a large
number of group or student homes opening in residential areas.
   ``This does not totally abrogate the ability of local governments
to use their zoning regulations to preserve the character of
single-family neighborhoods,'' Crawford said. ``It will just take
some careful draftsmanship.''
   Brookhaven's town attorney, David Fishbein, did not return a
telephone call seeking comment.

<TEXT>
   A government official said Sunday's
parliamentary election will be another step toward ``socialist
democracy'' in the communist-ruled Southeast Asian nation.
   The 121 candidates contesting the 79 seats of the Supreme
People's Council, the highest state body, ended campaigning today.
   About 1.8 million of Laos' 3.8 million people are eligible to
vote, Somsavath Lengsavad, the secretary of the national election
committee, said on Friday. All those 18 years old or older can vote,
he said at a briefing.
   The council comprised 45 appointed officials when it was
established Dec. 2, 1975, when the Communist Party seized power
after a struggle over the U.S.-backed government in Vientiane.
   Somsavath said the candidates included seven women and averaged
40 years of age. Six candidates are from the Communist Party Central
Committee and 60 percent to 70 percent are party members, he said.
   He said results from the country's 4,153 polling stations would
be counted by hand, and the final tally would not be known for a
week to 10 days.
   He called the election ``another step toward socialist
democracy.''
   Official media has said it will draft communist Laos' first
constitution.
   Thailand's ambassador to Laos, Niran Panupong, has cited
unconfirmed reports that some senior officials may retire after the
election, including Prime Minister Kaysone Phomvihane, who is in his
late 60s, and acting President Phoumi Vongvichit, 80. Kaysone has
led the party since he co-founded it in 1955.
   Laos is one of the world's poorest nations, with an estimated per
capita income of $135 in 1985. In late 1986, the party endorsed
Western-style reforms to try to reverse a decade of socialist
policies.
   The first nationwide district and provincial elections were held
last year.
   But a Thai political scientist, Sirichai Sirikai, said the
election Sunday is designed only to endorse the legitimacy of those
in power and convince the world of Laos' political stability.

   Hundreds of Christians from around the world
today walked along the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem's Old City, praying
and singing as they retraced Christ's path to his crucifixion on
Good Friday.
   The procession to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where
Christians believe Christ died on the cross, was led by 20 Roman
Catholic Franciscan monks in black robes tied with white rope belts.
   The crowd seemed smaller than in recent years. Pilgrims were seen
dragging only about a half dozen large, wooden crosses along the
narrow, cobbled street in the walled Old City.
   Because of the 15-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation in the territories, hundreds of police, border guards and
army soldiers were on duty, clustered in groups of six or eight on
the Via Dolorosa.
   No major violence was reported.
   In the Philippines, at least 11 people were nailed to crosses and
thousands of Filipinos drew blood by beating themselves on the back
today to symbolize the suffering of Christ.
   The crucifixions have been an annual ritual for decades in San
Pedro Cutud, 40 miles north of Manila, and this year drew 5,000
people. The rituals have become tourist attractions in recent years,
complete with stalls selling food, soft drinks, straw hats, fans and
other souvenirs.
   Pope John Paul II marked Good Friday by hearing the confessions
of six Italians and a West German religion teacher in the Vatican.
The Roman Catholic leader 10 years ago began hearing confessions in
St. Peter's Basilica on Good Friday to emphasize the importance of
the sacrament.
   In Jerusalem, 600 pilgrims marched behind the monks. The marchers
included groups carrying Canadian and Australian flags, as well as
the French fleur-de-lis. A guitarist led a group of Spaniards.
   John Eberlein, 56, of Manassas, Va., said he was deeply moved to
see Christians gathered together from around the world.
   ``You just feel you are part of a tremendous movement, this
Christian religion, no matter what denomination it might be,'' he
said. ``To see all colors here, all believing the same thing you
believe _ it's just very exhilarating, spiritually moving.''
   Eberlein was with a group of 11 Catholics who came from the U.S.
East Coast to walk the Via Dolorosa and attend the Mass for Christ's
resurrection on Easter Sunday.
   A group of American Christians from California performed a
pageant along the route.
   Ralph Beltran of Los Angeles, portraying Christ, was dressed in a
white robe and wore a crown of thorns. He carried a large wooden
cross and companions dressed as Roman guards ritually flogged him.
   Joanne Petranela of Brea, Calif., dressed as Mary Magdalene, ran
among astonished on-lookers shouting ``It's all my fault.''
   A German pilgrim from Munich, who identified himself only as
Helmut, termed it ``a disgrace to Christianity.''
   According to Christian tradition, the Via Dolorosa, or Street of
Sorrows, marks the path where Jesus was forced to carry the cross on
which he was crucified. Franciscans began the tradition of walking
the street in the 14th century.
   Israeli troops moved into the Old City and Arab east Jerusalem,
then Jordanian territory, in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Since then, Israel annexed Arab east Jerusalem and joined it into
the Israeli capital. But most foreign countries, including the
United States, consider east Jerusalem disputed territory and keep
their embassies in the Israeli coastal city of Tel Aviv.
   The Old City contains sites holy to the world's three great
monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Jerusalem
is a major point of friction between Jews and Arabs.
   Israel also seized the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 war.
The Palestinian uprising has demanded an end to that occupation.
   More than 400 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have been killed
during the rebellion.

   Pope John Paul II heard the confessions of
six Italians and a West German religion teacher in St. Peter's
Basilica in keeping with a Good Friday tradition he began 10 years
ago.
   In the evening, the Roman Catholic leader was to carry a wooden
cross in a procession at the Colosseum symbolizing Christ's walk to
his crucifixion on Calvary Hill in Jerusalem.
   John Paul, carrying a black overcoat, appeared shortly after noon
in St. Peter's Basilica and stepped into one of the hand-carved
mahogany confessional booths.
   During the next 70 minutes, he heard confessions from a Frankfurt
religion teacher and two Italian military students, a laborer, a
transport worker, a 40-year-old woman and her 12-year-old son.
   As he left the confessional, the pope greeted several thousand
people who had gathered nearby to watch.
   John Paul began hearing confessions in the basilica on Good
Friday to emphasize the importance of the sacrament.

<HEAD>Leaders Say China's Educational System Faces Crisis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   High school enrollment in China has dropped more
than 25 percent in the past 10 years, officials said today, and
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping acknowledged that Beijing's education
policies are in crisis.
   Elementary school enrollment has also fallen more than 14 percent
since 1978, when China embarked on an ambitious program to develop
its economy.
   ``Our biggest mistake over the last 10 years is that education
has not developed sufficiently,'' the People's Daily quoted Deng as
saying.
   Minister of Education Li Tieying said the educational system
declined because China failed to make education a priority and
because students are not convinced that an education will improve
their standard of living.
   He also said at a news conference that China's new agricultural
policies encourage families to remove children from school. Li said,
however, the state doesn't have the money to improve the education
system.
   He called for an education tax and said tuition should be raised
and schools should set up their own businesses to make money.
   China, which used to pride itself on its free education, has
begun forcing schools to set up small factories, restaurants or
hotels to pay for themselves.
   In some areas, schools charge tuition ranging from $27 a year to
$810 _ about twice the salary of an average Chinese urban worker _
to pay for books and other materials.
   The news conference came during a meeting of China's legislature,
the National People's Congress, which is studying a proposal to
raise the education budget by 15 percent, to the equivalent of $10
billion.
   Last year, China spent about $11 a person for education, one of
the lowest figures in the world.
   Consequently, in 1988 more than 60 percent of junior high schools
and 90 percent of elementary schools lacked sufficient facilities
and goods, Li said. He said teachers in China make less than the
average worker in a state-run factory and most don't qualify for the
job.
   The low priority given to education has meant only about
one-third of China's pupils finish primary school. Of those, less
than 10 percent go on to high school or college. The average Chinese
spends five years in school, despite a law mandating nine years of
education.
   As a result, there are 220 million illiterates in China, most of
them in the countryside, Li said. Part of the problem, he said, is
that recent agricultural policies giving land back to the peasants
have meant millions of children have abandoned school to till family
fields.
   In addition, there are few financial incentives for Chinese to
get an education, Li said. Highly-educated Chinese are underpaid.
Starting salaries for college-educated Chinese men and women hover
around $29 a month. A hairdresser can make 10 times that much.
   An increasing number of graduate students are leaving school to
seek higher wages outside of academia and research, Li said.
   When asked what should China do about the problem, Li declined to
be specific. He said China would implement laws to help education
and that a commission was working on a reform program.

<TEXT>
   A government commission has concluded that
thousands of people buried in a mass grave outside Kiev were killed
during Stalin's repressions, not by Nazi soldiers, Tass reported
today.
   The commission's conclusion supports the testimony of elderly
witnesses in the nearby village of Bykovnia, who said they saw
trucks dripping blood rumbling to the site in the 1930s, before the
Nazis occupied the area.
   Unofficial estimates say the grave contains 200,000 to 300,000
bodies.
   Villagers in Bykovnia broke five decades of silence to accuse
Josef Stalin's secret police after the Ukrainian government erected
a monument in May 1988 blaming Nazi occupiers for the crime. The
villagers in December forced Ukrainian authorities to establish the
commission, saying three previous investigations had covered up the
truth by blaming Nazi troops.
   Today report by Tass, the official Soviet news agency, did not
mention the earlier investigations.
   Viktor Kulik, head of the investigating commission, told Tass
that panelists found family names engraved on some objects in the
grave.
   ``Examination of the archives later confirmed that the victims
were `people's enemies' charged in the 1930s with
counterrevolutionary and nationalist activity, espionage and
conspiracy,'' Tass said.
   ``Official confirmation has been given to the version that in the
Darnitsa Forest near the village of Bykovnia outside the Ukrainian
capital of Kiev are buried victims of the repressions of the
1930s,'' Tass said.
   Western historians estimate 20 million Soviets were killed under
Stalin, particularly during the Great Purge of the late 1930s. But
Soviet officials ignored the dark side of Stalin for most of the
past 50 years. The examination of Stalin's crimes began briefly
under Nikita Khrushchev and was revived in 1987 under President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness.
   Earlier commissions blamed Nazis for the Bykovnia killings even
though villagers insisted the bodies already were there when the
Germans occupied Kiev in September 1941. Several villagers told The
Associated Press they dug up the graves on orders of the Germans.
   A local man, Mikola Lysenko, discovered the bones and skulls in
1987 after grave robbers uncovered them and set out on a personal
crusade for the truth.
   He located witnesses in Bykovnia and won support from the
Ukrainian Writers' Union and the newly formed Memorial Society,
which is dedicated to baring the truth of Stalin's crimes.
   Lysenko was unavailable for comment today as he does not have a
telephone.

<HEAD>Flight Attendants End Strike Against Continental</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Striking flight attendants today ended their
walkout against Continental Airlines, saying their protests had
accomplished the union's goal of publicizing its grievances. The
five-day walkout had had little effect on service.
   The airline, which has a largely ununionized work force since
Texas Air Corp. head Frank Lorenzo took Continental into bankruptcy
proceedings in 1983, said that only a few attendants had taken part
and that they had lost their jobs but have the right to fill future
job openings.
   The Union of Flight Attendants said its executive board ended the
strike, at 9 a.m. Union officials were notifying attendants to
report for their work assignments.
   ``This strike accomplished the objectives we set out to
achieve,'' Carla Winkler, union president, said in a statement.
   ``We have been able to bring to the public's attention the
disparate treatment between the wages and working conditions of
Continental flight attendants and flight attendants at other
carriers in the industry.''
   When the strike began, some of those on the picket line said it
was intended to last only 96 hours, a figure Winkler refused to
confirm.
   Union leaders had said that the strike was largely unrelated to
the Machinists union walkout against sister Eastern Airlines,
another brach of Texas Air. That strike, which began March 4,
virtually shut down the airline when most Eastern pilots opted not
to cross Machinists' picket lines.
   At Continental, officials said 180 attendants refused to report
for work during the job action and were replaced. The union said all
week that the number of strike participants was more like 1,000, and
claimed that some flights were canceled, but offered no proof.
   The Houston-based airline lists its flight attendant work force
at 6,440.
   ``We feel really good that we enjoyed the support of so many of
our flight attendants,'' airline spokesman Dave Messing said today.
``Not a single cancellation occurred as a result of the union
activity.
   ``It (the strike) just didn't have the support needed to cause
disruptions.''
   Messing said the 180 strikers had been permanently replaced but
were subject to recall when job openings became available and would
have seniority over new applicants.

<HEAD>Georgia Democratic Official Involved in Gingrich Book Deal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A close adviser to Georgia's Democratic
governor said today he was one of the 21 investors who put up $5,000
each to promote a 1984 book by Rep. Newt Gingrich, the newly elected
House Republican whip.
   Joel Cowan, a Peachtree City, Ga., real estate developer who is
treasurer of the Georgia Democratic Party and the honorary chief of
staff to Gov. Joe Frank Harris, said in a telephone interview that
he invested in the book promotion deal because he thought Gingrich
had a message for the public.
   Cowan's participation in the book promotion deal was first
disclosed in today's Wall Street Journal. Gingrich earlier this week
promised to list all 21 investors once he has contacted them
personally.
   The Journal said Cowan's company, Cowan and Associates, received
a $204,480 grant from the Department of Housing and Urban
Development last year, but Cowan denied today that his company ever
received such a grant.
   ``Unless there is just a total lapse of memory and organization
on my part, I didn't get it,'' Cowan said. ``And if I'm right,
clearly somebody used my name to get a grant ... I'm going to get to
the bottom of it.''
   Cowan said he has never supported Gingrich politically and and
has never contributed to any of his congressional campaigns. He said
he made a $500 contribution last year to Gingrich's Democratic
opponent, David Worley.
   Cowan said he has had very little contact with Gingrich over the
years. He said he once wrote him recommending an appointment to the
Air Force Academy and once visited him in Washington when he was
making calls on all members of the Georgia delegation for Harris
shortly after his election in 1982.
   Cowan said he became interested in Gingrich's book, ``Window of
Opportunity,'' in 1983 when the congressman mentioned the project
during a speech to the Aspen Group, a mostly Republican group of
people involved in real estate.
   Cowan said he invited Gingrich to speak at that meeting because
``I thought he had a message. At the time he was speaking out on
supply-side economics and he was an outspoken conservative voice.''
   Cowan said the members of the group who attended the Aspen
meeting split the cost of Gingrich's travel and lodging expenses.
   The partnership created to promote Gingrich's book was to have
received half of the publisher's profits in exchange for their
investment. But there were not enough sales to produce profits and
Cowan said all he got for his $5,000 was six copies of the book and
a tax writeoff.

<HEAD>STATEMENT BY BUSH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In my inaugural address, I advocated a bipartisan foreign policy.
   And today, we, the executive and the Congress, Republicans and
Democrats, will be speaking one voice on an extremely important
foreign policy issue: Central America.
   We've signed today in the Cabinet Room a bipartisan accord on
Central America, which sets out the broad outlines of U.S. policy
toward the region.
   We're seeking the same goals as those of the people of Central
America: democracy, security, and peace.
   In order to meet the challenge of realizing those goals, we must
work together with Latin American democratic leaders, with the
support of our European friends.
   Under the Esquipulas Accord, insurgent forces have the right to
reintegrate into their homeland under safe, democratic conditions
with full civil and political rights, and that is the desire of the
Nicaraguan resistance.
   To achieve our objectives, the bipartisan leadership of Congress
has agreed to support my request for continued humanitarian
assistance at current levels through the elections in Nicaragua
scheduled for Feb. 28, 1990.
   We do not claim the right to order the politics of Nicaragua.
   That is for the Nicaraguan people to decide.
   The Esquipulas Accord requires a free, open political process in
which all groups can participate, the playing field must be level.
   The burden of proof is on the Sandinista government to comply
with the promises that it has made since 1979.
   And if they comply, we have an opportunity to start a new day in
Central America.
   The Soviet Union also has an obligation and an opportunity to
demonstrate its new thinking.
   In other regional conflicts, it's adopted a welcome new approach,
but in Central America, what we've seen to date is only old thinking.
   The Soviet Union has no legitimate security interests in Central
America.
   The United States has many.
   We reject any doctrine of equivalence in the region.
   The Soviet Union and Cuba have an obligation to stop violating
the provisions of Esquipulas.
   Some see violence and despair in Central America, but I have a
different view of its future.
   I can see a democratic Central America in which all nations in
the region live in peace, where resources are devoted to social ends
instead of military defense.
   I hope the Esquipulas Accord and the bipartisan accord that we've
signed here will someday be seen as the first step toward that
future.

<NOTE>STATEMENT BY BAKER</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Ladies and gentlemen, I think if you examine American foreign
policy throughout the postwar era, one truth certainly shines
through.
   From President Truman's support for NATO to President Reagan's
INF agreement, every important achievement has enjoyed sustained
bipartisan support.
   A bipartisan foreign policy is based on honest and honorable
discussion and debate.
   It's not based on suppressing legitimate differences.
   In the end, it is also, I think, based on a recognition that we
are, after all, one people.
   We are one nation.
   And we must have one consistent foreign policy.
   Today we've taken the first important steps toward building a
successful bipartisan policy in Central America.
   If asked to summarize that policy in one word, I would say
democracy.
   Together we want the people of Nicaragua, as well as all others
in Central America, to be able to participate freely and fully in
democracy.
   And now, together, the executive branch and the Congress will
work to ensure that the promises of democracy in Nicaragua become
democracy in fact.
   I want to salute the speaker, the other leaders here, and many,
many others in the Senate and the House, whose dedication and hard
work and perseverance made this agreement possible.
   They have performed as leaders in the very best sense of that
term.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday honored
the task force that won the release of 30 young hostages in the
December hijacking of a Soviet jet to Israel.
   The task force, code-named ``Grom'' or ``thunder,'' was organized
quickly on Dec. 1 when an armed gang seized a busload of
fourth-graders and their teacher in the Caucasus town of
Ordzhonikidze.
   Gorbachev presented awards to the team, made up of
representatives from the Foreign Ministry, the KGB and the Civil
Aviation Ministry, at a ceremony in the Kremlin, Tass said.
   The four hijackers had demanded cash, weapons and a plane to fly
them to Israel. The Tass news agency said the captors didn't want to
leave the Soviet Union for any political or religious reasons, but
solely ``to enrich themselves.''
   The task force acceded to the hijackers' demands Dec. 2 after
they released the children unharmed.
   ``The Soviet leadership decided to do everything to save the
children,'' Tass said. ``The participants in the operation,
code-named `Grom,' had been told from the start not to take any
steps that might have endangered the kids' lives.''
   Israel sent the hijackers back to the Soviet Union, and on March
17, they were convicted. Ringleader Pavel Yakshiyants was sentenced
to 15 years in prison and three others received 14 years each.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was steady in very quiet trading in
Europe today, with most markets closed for the long Easter holiday
weekend.
   Gold and silver bullion markets in London, Zurich and Hong Kong
were closed.
   Market players said that with most European financial centers
closed for Good Friday, trading fizzled out with the winding down of
the Tokyo day. The European markets reopen on Tuesday.
   ``The last, shall we say operative, quotes were in Tokyo,'' said
a trader with a large Italian bank in Rome. He and others commented
that short of major new factors emerging to affect currencies during
the morning, it wasn't likely that any notable exchange rate moves
would take place.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.39 yen to a closing 131.27 yen. Later in Europe it
was quoted at 131.30 yen.
   ``Nothing was happening in Tokyo trading today. Hardly anyone was
participating from the beginning, mainly because of long weekends on
overseas markets for the Easter holidays,'' said a dealer with Daiwa
Bank in Tokyo.
   In Europe, the British pound fell to $1.7185, compared with
$1.7205 Thursday.
   Other dollar rates at late morning in Europe, compared with late
Thursday:
   _1.8718 West German marks, down from 1.8720
   _1.6250 Swiss francs, down from 1.6260
   _6.3355 French francs, up from 6.3315
   _2.1138 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1025
   _1,376.10 Italian lire, up from 1,370.12
   A rate was not available for the dollars against the Canadian
dollar. The rate was 1.1894 Canadian dollars on Thursday.

<HEAD>NRC Lawyer Warned Officials Against Paying Informants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Nuclear Regulatory Commission lawyer in 1986
warned officials against paying informants without congressional
approval, according to an internal document, but two years later the
agency paid a witness $4,000 for information against the NRC's No. 2
investigator.
   In a six-page memo dated Sept. 2, 1986, Assistant General Counsel
Hudson B. Ragan told NRC Investigations Director Ben B. Hayes that
informant payments ``would not be on sound legal ground,'' noting
that federal law and legislative history ``are all silent on the use
of such an investigative technique by the commission.''
   Ragan recommended that the commission either write such a
provision into the next year's NRC budget or seek informal approval
from Congress.
   But in an interview Thursday, Ragan said he believes such
payments can be made without congressional approval in special
circumstances where officials can prove the information is essential
to health and safety.
   Lawmakers and congressional aides who watch the NRC say they have
never heard of the commission paying informants and were shocked
earlier this week when Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., obtained an NRC
contract detailing a $4,000 payment to Douglas S. Ellison, a former
technician at the Nine Mile Point plant in upstate New York.
   Gejdenson accused the commission of trying to undermine the
Office of Investigations by paying Ellison, who had accused the
office's deputy director, Roger A. Fortuna, of misconduct.
   In the 1986 memo, Ragan gave commission officials a detailed
analysis of administrative precedent in other agencies showing that
in all but one other case the U.S. comptroller general ``strongly
admonished'' agencies either to seek specific legislative authority
or to make sure Congress did not object.
   He also pointed to specific congressional authorizations of
informant payments in other agencies as a precedent.
   ``These enactments create the implication that such expenditures
should not be incurred except by express authority or by expressly
informing Congress that such expenditures will be incurred,'' Ragan
wrote.
   But in a telephone interview from the NRC's Rockville, Md.,
headquarters, Ragan said such congressional approval would be
necessary only if the commission wanted to create a regular program
to pay informants.
   ``The main thrust of the memorandum is `you just don't go
engaging in this kind of activity without advising Congress or
getting special authority unless you have special circumstances,'''
Ragan said.
   ``Generally speaking, any agency that can show a substantial need
for obtaining information that is not otherwise available to them
can use their appropriations to obtain that information,'' he said.
   ``Our type of cases have been based upon a specific need of
health and safety,'' he added. ``The instances that we have (paid
informants), to the best of my knowledge, are very few and far
between and we don't think we have to establish such a program.''
   Ragan said he believes there have been only two or three
instances of NRC payments to informants in the past 10 years.
   Ellison contends that Fortuna passed along confidential
information provided by Ellison to Stephen Comley, a Massachusetts
anti-nuclear activist.
   NRC officials, who are trying to fire Fortuna for his refusal to
testify on the Ellison allegations, say they will not discuss the
case because it is still pending.
   One NRC official close to the Fortuna investigation, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity, said Ellison was not an informer but a
consultant.
   But Ellison said in an interview earlier this week that he was
paid to testify and provide the commission with tapes of
conservations he secretly recorded.
   The NRC official argued that Ellison's explanation and
interpretations of the tapes constituted consulting work.

   Chanting anti-abortion protesters gathered at
a health clinic today and pro-choice demonstrators followed as a
group called Operation Rescue went into the second day of its Holy
Week crusade against abortion.
   Police said about 150 abortion foes showed up at a clinic in Long
Beach early this morning, a day after 373 Operation Rescue members
were arrested while defying a court order and blockading a clinic in
suburban Cypress.
   There were no immediate arrests in Long Beach, said Lt. Columbus
Lowe.
   A caravan of Operation Rescue members earlier passed by a clinic
on Long Beach Boulevard where pro-choice demonstrators were already
waiting.
   Pro-choice forces have been stationed at mobilization centers
from which they can be dispatched to counter Operation Rescue
protests.
   Operation Rescue opened its Southern California campaign of civil
disobedience on Thursday in Orange County. About 500 protesters sang
hymns and prayed at the Family Planning Associates Medical Clinic in
Cypress, about 20 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
   Elsewhere today, more than 200 anti-abortion protesters in
Albany, N.Y., staged a Good Friday demonstration at a Planned
Parenthood clinic, with police reporting 80 to 100 arrests by
midmorning. Fifty protesters were charged with trespassing in
Syracuse for entering a Planned Parenthood center, while another 100
protested outside.
   Police arrested 124 protesters _ four busloads _ who gathered in
rain and gusting winds outside a downtown Philadelphia clinic, three
days after a federal judge barred such protests in the area. At a
second downtown site, 500 demonstrators assembled but left when they
learned patients had entered through a back door. Abortion rights
advocates staged a counterdemonstration.
   Some 100 demonstrators in the Detroit suburb of Farmington Hills
similarly dispersed when they found a clinic closed, said police
Inspector Richard Niemisto. In Cincinnati, 30 to 35 demonstrators in
front of two women's clinics were orderly and there were no arrests.
   Southern California was targeted as the center of most pre-Easter
National Week of Rescue because of its high abortion rate and many
clinics, organizers said.
   Operation Rescue has staged many similar protests throughout the
country, most notably during the Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta last summer.
   Leaders of the group had vowed to risk arrest by defying a
federal court order obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union
that prohibited protesters from blocking entrances or gathering
within 15 feet of certain clinics.
   Among those arrested was Randall Terry, the zealous 29-year-old
leader of Operation Rescue. Terry and many of his followers refused
to talk to reporters.
   Led by feminist attorney Gloria Allred shouting in a bullhorn,
advocates of a woman's right to an abortion applauded and gleefully
chanted ``Read him his rights, take him away,'' every time a
protester was arrested.
   Those arrested were booked for investigation of failing to
disperse, a misdemeanor. Under Terry's order, they fell limp during
arrests, forcing four police officers to drag each one off to a bus
that took them to City Hall.
   Los Angeles officials, who had expected protests by as many 2,500
people, followed developments during the day from a City Hall
command center. But Los Angeles clinics were spared.
   Police in suburban Inglewood had set up a temporary jail site at
the Hollywood Park race track, but it was unneeded.
   Operation Rescue began its blockades outside women's clinics in
1987 and since then, more than 21,000 of its anti-abortion
protesters have been arrested nationwide.
   In the most recent figures available, California recorded 304,130
abortions in 1985 with some 100,360 performed at about 75 clinics in
the Los Angeles area.
   Some 1.5 million abortions have been performed annually in the
United States since the U.S. Supreme Court decision of 1973 that
made abortion legal for women in all states.

<HEAD>Raisa Gorbachev Says Soviet Parliament Campaign Has Gone Well</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto MOS5</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

   First lady Raisa Gorbachev said Friday that
candidates in this weekend's parliamentary elections such as
communist firebrand Boris N. Yeltsin should be allowed to state
their views freely.
   She declined, however, to say if she'll vote for him.
   As she guided a group of Soviet and American students on a tour
of the Kremlin, the wife of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev offered a
rare glimpse of her views on domestic politics when asked twice by
reporters to comment on Yeltsin's campaign for a seat in the new
Congress of People's Deputies.
   ``Everything is normal,'' said Mrs. Gorbachev. ``Every candidate
has a right to his program, to stating it, to its reasoning. And the
people have a right to express their attitude to it.''
   Although Mrs. Gorbachev often answers reporters' questions when
she is visiting foreign countries with her husband, it was unusual
for her to comment on domestic politics.
   Communist Party leaders have criticized Yeltsin, ousted as Moscow
party boss by Gorbachev in 1987, and last week launched an
investigation into whether his views clash with the official party
line.
   At campaign appearances, the 58-year-old Yeltsin has railed
against the privileges of the Soviet elite, complaining that more
radical economic reforms are needed to put food on empty store
shelves.
   In Sunday's elections, Yeltsin is running against Yevgeny Brakov,
director of the huge Moscow ZIL limousine plant, for the country's
most visible parliamentary seat, the one representing all of Moscow.
Brakov generally conforms to the party line.
   Mrs. Gorbachev was asked whether she will vote for Yeltsin, whom
her husband brought into the Soviet leadership in 1985, or for
Brakov.
   ``Why namely for Brakov or Yeltsin? We have many candidates
running today,'' Mrs. Gorbachev said as she stood among the Soviet
and American students.
   Pressed to name the candidate of her choice, she said: ``Well,
elections are a secret matter, and I think it would not be polite,
not modest, for me'' to state a preference.
   Sunday's elections are the first national balloting involving
more than one candidate in the Soviet Union, and Mrs. Gorbachev said
the campaign has gone well.
   ``For us, it has great significance because it shows the
practical implementation of all the steps taken so far in the field
of political reforms. And so completely unusual social activity has
developed during the elections, and that's excellent,'' Mrs.
Gorbachev said.
   Yeltsin was fired as Moscow party chief in November 1987 for
complaining that Gorbachev's reforms were proceeding too slowly and
warning that a cult was developing around the Soviet leader.
   Yeltsin, who is still a member of the party's policy-making
Central Committee, has alleged in the campaign that the party is
using unethical tactics to make sure he is not elected.
   Mrs. Gorbachev met with 70 Soviet and 26 American students
holding what is billed as a ``Youth Summit'' to discuss ecology,
human rights, drugs and alcohol abuse and Soviet-American relations.
   The Americans, ranging in age from 9 to 19, are affiliated with
Youth Ambassadors of America, a group based in Bellingham, Wash.
   During the 45-minute Kremlin tour, Mrs. Gorbachev displayed her
knowledge of English, asking a 10-year-old Fazel Hussain of Tampa,
Fla., ``What's your name?'' and reading English words on souvenirs
she was given by the Americans.
   She told reporters she had studied German in high school and has
been studying English on her own.
   ``I read a little better. I speak only rarely, only when there
are meetings,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   An attorney for Jim Bakker says the
evangelist and former PTL owner won't be buying the former Nautilus
property as a broadcasting headquarters.
   Reports earlier this week that Bakker wouldn't be buying the
Nautilus sports medicine facility led opponents of the possible sale
to call off a meeting to protest Bakker's presence in the small
community.
   The 158,000-square-foot Nautilus facility reportedly carried a
price tag of $5.5 million.
   The two sides failed to reach agreement on the terms, said
Bakker's attorney George Davis. Negotiations with the current
Nautilus owner, Travis Ward, broke down after five minutes, he said.
   Davis said Ward wanted $2 million up front and a definite
commitment, conditions Bakker and his business backers from
Charlotte, N.C., said they couldn't provide.
   Nautilus founder Arthur Jones sold his Nautilus exercise
equipment company to Ward in 1986. Ward then moved the company to
Dallas after the purchase.
   Officials at Studio Six Productions in Orlando, part of the WCPX
television station, said Wednesday they had put in a bid to serve as
a temporary broadcast facility for Bakker's ministry, a WCPX news
report said.
   Bakker's lawyers said no decision has been made either on a site
or on any broadcast arrangement. They also refused to comment on
that report of the Studio Six Productions offer.
   Bakker, who has pleaded not guilty to charges that he and another
PTL leader took $4 million from the PTL ministry, has been searching
for a new site for his TV pulpit.

<HEAD>Anti-Government Rebels in Somalia Claim They Hold Most of North</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebels fighting Somalia's governmment claimed
Friday they hold almost a third of the strategically important
country on the Horn of Africa and are closing on two major northern
cities.
   Abdirahman Ahmed Ali, the rebel Somali National Movement's
executive committee member responsible for foreign relations, also
claimed Libya has provided nerve gas to the Somali government and
trained soldiers to use it. Ali said the gas was now in the port of
Berbera.
   The reports could not be independently confirmed.
   ``For some time we have been controlling 85 percent of the
northern region, which is about one-third of Somalia, and in the
past four weeks we have been closing on the main cities in the
north,'' Ali said in London, where he is based.
   Rebels were fighting government troops on the outskirts of
Hargeisa and Burao in northwest Somalia and expect to take control
of both cities ``very soon,'' he said.
   Last week, he said, rebels captured the town of Erigazo, near the
Red Sea, and the town of Odweine, between Hargeisa and Burao.
   ``We have also cleared a large costal area between Hargeisa and
the Red Sea,'' Ali said.
   The movement is fighting to oust army Gen. Mohamed Siad Barre,
who has ruled Somalia since a 1969 coup, and reestablish democracy.
The East African country of 5.3 million was once allied with the
Soviet Union, but switched allegiance to the West in 1977.
   Ali quoted Arab newspapers in Abu Dhabi as saying Barre had
called in Arab ambassadors in Mogadishu this week and appealed for
militry support. He said Libya was the only Arab country that had
provided the Somali government with some arms, tanks, ammunition and
nerve gas.
   ``We know the nerve gas is now in Berbera,'' the main port on the
Gulf of Aden, he said. ``It arrived there four weeks ago,
transported from Mogadishu, and 18 Somalis who have been trained in
Libya for use of nerve gas have now come back to Berbera. We know
because we have our own people there.''
   Ali said that on Wednesday, government soldiers in Kismaayo,
about 300 miles south of Mogadishu, broke into an army and police
armory, took all the ammunition and rifles, and went into the bush,
apparently defecting. ``So another front is going to start there
soon,'' he said.
   The rebel successes, he said, were the result of demoralization
in the army and an economic crisis.
   Somalia has accused neighboring Ethiopia of arming the rebels in
violation of a 1987 pact between the two countries that ended their
11-year war and stipulated they would not arm each others'
insurgents.
   In September, Amnesty International said the Barre government had
executed up to 1,000 civilians while trying to end the insurgency in
the north. In response, the U.S. Congress froze $55 million in aid
to the impoverished nation.
   Ali said the rebels were ``very concerned'' that two U.S.
military cargo planes were transporting arms and personnel for the
government from Mogadishu to Berbera and that the Americans also
were helping the Somali army with communications equipment and
training.
   ``We don't want the United States to be caught in civil war ...
and we hope they keep out of this conflict,'' he said.
   The rebels have been fighting Barre for seven years.
   Northern Somalia is a former British protectorate that merged
with the south, a former Italian colony, in 1960.

<HEAD>Chambers Brothers Sentenced for Running Detroit Cocaine Ring</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four brothers convicted of leading the city's
premiere crack cocaine ring by recruiting young people from a small
Arkansas town as workers were sentenced today to lengthy prison
terms and fines.
   Larry Chambers was sentenced to life in prison and a $250,000
fine; Billy Joe Chambers was sentenced to about 45 years and a
$500,000 fine; Otis Chambers was sentenced to 27 years and a
$350,000 fine; and Willie Chambers was sentenced to 21 years and a
$350,000 fine.
   Federal authorities said the ring supplied cocaine to as many as
half of Detroit's estimated 1,000 crack houses from 1982 to 1988.
   The four brothers and five other gang members, who were also
sentenced today, were convicted on conspiracy charges last Oct. 28.
In addition, Larry and Billy Joe Chambers were found guilty of the
more serious charge of continuing criminal enterprise, and Otis
Chambers was convicted of cocaine possession.
   ``Until we in the United States demand and are allowed to walk
down the street without drug dealers putting us in fear, we will
never improve our institutions,'' U.S. District Judge Richard
Surheinrich said in handing down the sentences.
   Also sentenced today were gang members Eric L. Wilkins, to 33
years in prison; Elaine Coleman Lucas, 10 years; Belinda Lumpkin, 25
years; Jerry Gant, 30 years; and Marshall Glenn, 30 years.
   Jurors heard six weeks of testimony in which former gang members
testifying in exchange for immunity and federal protection said the
Chambers brothers built their empire by recruiting youngsters from
their native Marianna, Ark.
   Some former workers testified the Chambers paid them as much as
$1,500 a week to break up crack into $5 and $10 chunks and deliver
it.
   At its peak, the ring sold an estimated $3 million worth of
cocaine a day in the nation's sixth-largest city, said U.S. Attorney
Roy C. Hayes.
   In the undercover operation that led to the indictments of gang
members, authorities seized 41 vehicles, including Mercedes-Benz and
Cadillacs, $1 million in cash and jewelry and 250 weapons.
   Attorneys for the convicted gang members have said they may
appeal, contending the trial should have been moved out of Detroit
because of intense media coverage.

   Planters LifeSavers Co. hopes customers
hungry for nostalgia will savor the return of some old-fashioned
flavors it hasn't sold in decades.
   The company's Holland plant recently began producing the
``Limited Edition Nostalgia Flavors'' _ ``Lic-O-Rice,''
``Choc-O-Late'' and ``Pepsin.'' Stores began carrying them a week
ago.
   The three flavors were developed in the 1920s. Lic-O-Rice and
Pepsin were discontinued in 1938 and Choc-O-Late was produced until
1968.
   ``Our society's general interest in nostalgia is booming these
days, and many Americans associate LifeSavers candy with warm
memories of their childhood and quieter, simpler lifestyles,'' said
Jeff Walters, associate product manager for the Winston-Salem,
N.C.-based company.
   When LifeSavers candies were introduced in 1912, Pep-O-Mint was
the only flavor available. Over the years, 45 flavors have been sold
at various times and 34 billion rolls have been purchased.
Currently, 17 flavors are on the market.

   The Coast Guard said today it has found no
sign of a sport fishing boat that radioed a distress call off the
Virginia coast and indicated 10 people aboard were abandoning ship.
Officials said they feared the boat had sunk but they couldn't rule
out a hoax.
   ``The helicopter is having a tough time due to the fog,'' said
Petty Officer 1st Class Rick Woods. ``Visibility was almost zero
last night, and it's real low this morning.''
   Petty Officer 1st Class Rick Barrett said today that an
84-square-mile area was being searched by the Coast Guard cutters
Point Huron, Point Highland and Point Arena, two Navy ships and a
Coast Guard helicopter.
   He said winds were blowing at 15 mph and seas were running 4 to 6
feet.
   Coast Guard officials have been unable to find any registration
records for a 52-foot vessel called the Blue Goose and were
considering the possibility that the distress call was a hoax.
   ``We don't know that this is a hoax, but there have been hoaxes
before,'' Petty Officer 2nd Class Steve Blando said late this
morning.
   The boat radioed late Thursday that it was taking on water and
that the passengers had donned life jackets and were abandoning the
vessel, said Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class Vernon Covington.
He said officials told them to try to stay together but did not
receive acknowledgement of that transmission.
   The helicopter from Elizabeth City, N.C., arrived to help in the
search but returned to its base shortly afterward because of 60 mph
winds and zero visibility, officials said.
   Seas were running 6 to 8 feet and the water temperature was 42
degrees, raising concerns that anyone overboard might suffer
hypothermia, Covington said.
   He said a computer check found 37 boats on the East Coast with
the name Blue Goose but that none fit the description of the missing
vessel. He speculated that the boat may be one of the many pleasure
craft that travel to and from Florida this time of year.
   The Blue Goose was described as a Hatteras-type fishing vessel,
which has a large deck area to the rear, a high cabin and sleeping
accommodations for six to eight people.

   Whoopi Goldberg and Sissy Spacek will
star in ``The Long Walk Home,'' a movie about the 1955 Montgomery
bus boycott that will be filmed entirely in Albama's capital.
   Mark Stricklin, director of the Alabama Film Office, said New
Visions Pictures officials notified him Thursday that the movie will
begin filming in Montgomery on May 22.
   The bus boycott, which began when black seamstress Rosa Parks
refused to give up her seat to a white man, helped launch the civil
rights movement that brought down racial barriers across the South.
No actual historic figures will be portrayed in the film, Stricklin
said.
   The film company wants to hire as many local actors and
production people as possible, Stricklin said. Up to 1,000 people
will be needed as extras, and a dozen feature roles may be cast
locally.
   Stricklin said the film, written by native Montgomerian John
Cork, isn't about the boycott but about a relationship between two
women and how it changes during the civil rights era.

   Kitty Dukakis says she was an alcoholic before
her husband lost last year's presidential election.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis's defeat at the polls was a
crisis but ``one event does not make one an alcoholic,'' Mrs.
Dukakis said in an interview published in Thursday's Los Angeles
Times.
   She said that on two occasions last March, both at the Dukakis
home in Brookline, Mass., she lost control while drinking but the
incidents were overlooked during the activity of the campaign.
   But Mrs. Dukakis was never inebriated in public.
   ``What happens often with men and women, though with women in
particular, is that you drink in private,'' said Mrs. Dukakis, 52.
   In February, Mrs. Dukakis checked herself into a Rhode Island
clinic for for treatment of her drinking problem. She left March 7
and has returned to a full schedule of speaking engagements and is
working on a memoir of the campaign.
   Mrs. Dukakis said she hid her drinking just as she hid her diet
pill addiction for 26 years.
   ``I was falling apart before my own eyes, and I was able to fool
people,'' she said.

   Famed mountain climber Reinhold Messner says
he will devote himself to team expeditions from now on instead of
the solo treks he has pursued in the past.
   Messner, 44, said at a news conference Thursday that he plans an
expedition to the South Pole and in the Himalayas.
   Messner, the only man to have climbed all 14 world peaks above
26,000 feet, said he will try to reach the South Pole next October
along with West German Arved Fuchas, without the help of dogs or
motorized sleds.
   Messner, who has made nearly 3,000 ascents, also plans to lead a
six-member expedition up the south wall of the 28,000-foot Lhotse,
in the Himalayas, in May, without the help of Sherpa guides and

   The two contestants in the Miss Wonderland International Pageant,
Julia Mikhejeva of Moscow and Laivi Loosaar from Estonia, are the
first Soviet citizens to be openly granted entry visas to Taiwan,
whose government was forced out of Mainland China by Communist
forces in 1949.
   However, the Foreign Ministry still refuses to allow the pageant
to display national flags of the Soviet Union and other Communist
countries _ Bulgaria, Poland and Yugoslavia _ that sent contestants
to Taiwan.
   The pageant was a regional contest in Malaysia before becoming an
international event in 1987. Contestants from 70 countries and
territories are participating this year.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today ``all
of our options are open'' on basing MX and Midgetman nuclear
missiles and said he was ``not happy'' with the Air Force chief of
staff for discussing compromise proposals.
   Asked about recent visits to congressional leaders by Gen. Larry
D. Welch, the Air Force's chief of staff, to discuss a compromise,
Cheney said, ``General Welch was free-lancing.''
   Cheney, marking completion of his first week on the job by
holding his first Pentagon news conference, declared that ``all of
our options are open'' on the issue of how to modernize America's
land-based nuclear arsenal.
   The four-star general ``was not speaking for the department,''
Cheney said. ``He was obviously up there on his own hook, so to
speak.
   ``No, I'm not happy with it, frankly. I think it's inappropriate
for a uniformed officer to be in a position where he is in fact
negotiating an arrangement. I will make known to him my displeasure.
Everybody's entitled to one mistake.''
   An Air Force spokesman later said Welch would have no comment on
Cheney's remarks.
   The Bush administration _ like the Reagan administration before
it _ is struggling to develop a plan for adding a mobile nuclear
missile to America's arsenal. The idea is to make it more difficult
for the Soviet Union to target U.S. forces, and thus deter Russia
from ever considering a first-strike attack.
   The Air Force and Pentagon have told Congress they would like to
buy 50 more huge MX missiles and place them on rail-car launchers.
Congressional Democrats, however, would prefer to see the
development of a small, one-warhead Midgetman missile that could be
deployed on a truck launcher.
   Welch and Adm. William J. Crowe, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, have in recent days been searching for a compromise.
   According to some congressmen, Welch has suggested an approach in
which 50 MX missiles already deployed in silos would be shifted to
rail launchers, while the number of Midgetman missiles to be built
would be scaled back from 500 to 300.
   ``I have as yet made no decision with respect to the question of
ICBM modernization,'' Cheney said today.
   ``All of our options are open. The president has not yet made any
decision on it. To say that a compromise is near, I think, would be
premature.''

   Oliver North's lawyers today sought to force
former President Reagan to testify when the defense opens its case
next Friday at the Iran-Contra trial, following disclosures about
Reagan's acts on behalf of the Nicaraguan rebels.
   ``The importance of Mr. Reagan's testimony to the defense of this
case is clear both from the record in the trial to date and from''
Reagan's efforts to quash a subpoena, said defense attorney Brendan
Sullivan.
   In a two-sentence motion, Sullivan asked that U.S. District Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell ``enter an order'' enforcing an earlier subpoena
for Reagan's appearance at the trial of the former White House
national security aide.
   Gesell ruled Jan. 30 that the former president shall remain
``subject to call'' in connection with a subpoena issued by North's
lawyers and served on Reagan on Dec. 30.
   Defense lawyers have brought out at North's trial that Reagan was
much more involved in secretly assisting the Contra rebels than has
previously been known publicly.
   Sullivan brought out that Reagan personally approved, based on a
recommendation by North and others on the National Security Council
staff, a secret 1985 deal to give Honduras $110 million in covert
aid as an inducement to support the Contras.
   The defense also brought out that Reagan apparently approved a
plan from North and others in the government to airdrop intelligence
data and recoilless rifles to the Contras for the purpose of
destroying ships carrying arms to the Nicaraguan government.
   Reagan's actions came at a time when Congress had banned U.S.
military aid to the Contras.
   Reagan told the Tower Commission, which investigated the
Iran-Contra affair, on Jan. 26, 1987 that ``he did not know that the
NSC staff was engaged in helping the Contras.''
   Reagan and then-Vice President Bush were served with subpoenas
from North's lawyers, and Reagan and Bush both sought to quash the
subpoenas.
   In a Jan. 13 court filing on their behalf, Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh said the subpoenas ``raise profound constitutional
concerns.
   The concerns are in connection with ``executive privilege ... but
also regarding the authority of the courts to compel appearances by
a former or sitting president,'' said Thornburgh.
   ``The spectacle of a former or sitting president being subjected
to peremptory judicial process may chill foreign governments in the
way they deal with the president now and in the future,'' said
Thornburgh.
   In his Jan. 30 ruling, Gesell said North had failed to
demonstrate that Bush ``has any specific information'' that would
make his testimony ``relevant and material'' to the charges against
North. The judge quashed the subpoena against the new president.
   Gesell said he would await developments in the trial with regard
to the subpoena for Reagan.
   On Thursday at North's trial, an NSC aide to North said he
assumed that profits from a 270 percent price markup on weapons
secretly sold to Iran were funneled to the Contras.
   Marine Lt. Col. Robert Earl testified that North brought him into
the Iran arms-for-hostage deal in April 1986.
   ``At some point in my briefing ... it was mentioned that part of
the monies hat the Ayatollah was providing would be going to support
the Contras in Nicaragua,'' Earl testified.
   As the NSC aide prepared for a May 1986 shipment of Hawk missile
spare parts, ``I remember Lt. Col. North asking for some help'' in
determining how much to charge the Iranians.
   Earl, a former Rhodes scholar, looked at the markup on a previous
arms shipment and, based on that, charged the Iranians $3.70 for
each dollar in cost to the U.S. government.
   North is charged with lying to the attorney general on Nov. 23,
1986, by denying that the NSC was involved in the diversion of funds
to the Contras and by saying Israel determined the amount of the
diversion.

   A jumbo jet carrying the space
shuttle Discovery landed here today, concluding a cross-country
journey home after an overnight stop in Texas.
   The Boeing 747 transport took off from Kelly Air Force Base near
San Antonio shortly before 10 a.m. EST and arrived at the Kennedy
Space Center here three hours later, touching down on a runway just
three miles from the launch pad where Discovery started a space
journey more than a week ago.
   After removing the shuttle from the transport, NASA will begin
grooming it for a classifed Defense Department mission in August.
One of the craft's three main engines will have to be replaced
because of a small combustion chamber leak discovered during
post-flight inspection.
   Space shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to make the next shuttle
flight, with launch set for April 28. Its crew will dispatch the
Magellan payload to orbit the planet Venus.
   The transport with Discovery aboard left Edwards Air Force Base
in California on Thursday and flew to Kelly, where it was refueled
and spent the night before departing this morning.
   Discovery blasted off March 13 on a five-day mission that
deployed the last of three Tracking and Data Relay Satellites to
complete the National Aeronautics and Space Administraion's shuttle
communications system.
   The orbiter landed at dawn Saturday in the California desert.

   The Zambian government, normally in the
forefront of a campaign for an economic blockade of South Africa, is
defending its airline for selling South African beer on its flights.
   ``Logistical problems'' forced Zambia Airways to buy beer from
South Africa, said Nephas Tembo, minister of state for transport.
   In the past, the airline bought beer from the Netherlands, but
deliveries frequently were delayed, he said.
   South Africa was the cheapest alternate source of the quality
beer that the airline needed to maintain its competitive standards,
Tembo added.
   Zambia, one of Africa's most indebted nations, brews its own beer
but shortages are common and production is hindered by a lack of
hard currency for imported ingredients.

   Investigators are looking into the theft of
three cases of condoms that an official said apparently were stolen
for ``recreational purposes.''
   Reported missing Wednesday were 1,728 individually wrapped latex
condoms that had been in a warehouse at Schmid Laboratories. The
condoms had a maximum retail value of $700 to $800.
   ``The fact that they didn't take but a few makes us believe they
took them for recreational purposes,'' said Roy Kelly, personnel
manager for Schmid, which also makes toothpaste, contraceptive foams
and jellies.
   Company officials say they probably will not find out who took
the condoms, which were awaiting shipment to a distribution center,
but hope whoever stole them will act responsibly.
   ``If nothing else, maybe it'll make a customer for us,'' Kelly
said.

   Belgians Patrice Raulier and Andre Fredrics, considered the
ringleaders of the group sending arms to rebels in Bolivia and

respectively.
   Marc Luick, a Danish shipping agent who rented the freighter
Jenstar, received three years in jail, and the Danish captain of the
ship, Joseph Andersen, received four years.
   All were fined between $1,500 and $3,000.
   The shortest jail term of two years and eight months went to
Italian Vito Manfredini, who cooperated with police following his

   The shipload of pistols, guns and ammunition was seized when the
Jenstar docked in Savona on Feb. 8.

   Premier Turgut Ozal said he may quit if
opposition parties make strong gains in Sunday's nationwide local
elections.
   ``If many want to see Suleyman Bey back in power, or Erdal Bey in
power, we will say, `OK, come take over,''' Ozal said Friday,
referring to former Premier Suleyman Demirel and opposition leader
Erdal Inonu.
   ``I am not glued to the (premier's) chair, let whoever wants come
run the country,'' he said at a news conference.
   Turks on Sunday will elect mayors, provincial assembly members,
city councilors, neighborhood representatives and village headmen.
   Voting does not directly affect the national government, and
Ozal's mandate extends to 1992. But opposition parties say Ozal
should call early elections if the governing Motherland Party
receives less than one-third of votes nationwide.
   ``This is not a general election and I would like to continue
until 1992,'' Ozal said. ``But if matters come to a point where we
cannot rule comfortably, I will say, `do whatever you like.'''
   Ozal's record is a major election issue. During his five years in
power, the nation of 52 million people has enjoyed economic growth
and built power plants, roads and an improved communications
network. Trade has been liberalized and it has applied for
membership in the European Economic Community.
   But inflation, which reached 75 percent last year, has hurt many
wage earners and prompted a drop in support for Ozal.
   Public opinion polls indicate the main opposition Social Democrat
Populist Party will win mayoral posts in the capital, Ankara, and
Turkey's third largest city, Izmir. The Motherland Party is expected
to maintain control in Istanbul, the second city where popular Mayor
Bedrettin Dalan is seeking a second five-year term.
   Ozal said he doubted the accuracy of the polls and doubted his
party would lose. He declined to say exactly what vote result would
make him consider quitting.
   Respected columnist Guneri Civaoglu of the daily Sabah said Ozal
may call general elections in six months if his party suffers a
crushing defeat Sunday.
   The popularity of the center-right Motherland Party has declined
steadily since it won 1983 general elections that restored civilian
rule. The party at that time garnered 45 percent of the vote.
   In general elections in November 1987, the party won 36 percent
of the vote but 65 percent of seats in the 450-member legislature,
through electoral laws that favor the largest party.
   Ozal threatened to quit before a national referendum in November
on advancing the date of local polls. Although he lost the
referendum, he stayed on, saying the 35 percent of votes he won
indicated he still had wide support.

<HEAD>Safety Program Ordered After Youth Dies in Highway Game</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The education minister ordered a traffic safety
program in schools Friday after an 11-year-old boy died playing a
daredevil ``game'' in highway traffic, Israel radio reported.
   Baruch Oren died last week after jumping in front of a speeding
car along the busy Tel Aviv-Haifa highway and trying to force it to
stop at the last moment, the radio said.
   The ``game'' is a new fad among elementary and high school
students, who also have been known to throw balls and school bags on
roads, and try to snatch them from in front of speeding cars. High
school students feel such reckless deeds toughen them before army
service, the radio said.
   ``It's a thrill,'' said one of Oren's classmates who was
interviewed on the radio. ``It makes kids feel strong and the girls
think they're heroes.''
   On Friday, Education Minister Yitzhak Navon met school principals
across the country after an investigation revealed Oren died while
playing the game.
   He ordered each school to open a road safety seminar Monday for
parents and children to stress dangers of the game.
   ``I don't know of a school in the country where the game is not
played,'' said Yaffa Saguy, principal of Ein Hayam school where Oren
was a student in northern Haifa city.
   ``Children stand by the road and when they see a car or bus
coming they throw a package and rush into the road,'' Ms. Saguy told
the radio.
   After Oren's death, she had the school psychiatrist hold a
seminar for students on the effects of the game.
   Shai Gadish, head of the Education Ministry's Road Safety Unit,
said children play the game to show their bravery and try to share
the dangers faced by older brothers or friends serving in the army.
   All Israelis are drafted into the army at age 18. Men serve for
three years, women for two.
   ``We are not talking about kids who don't know the dangers,''
Gadish said. ``They know the dangers and they do it.''
   Oren's classmates said it was the fourth time he had played the
game.
   One of his friends told the radio that Oren said ``Look, I can
stop cars,'' and walked into the middle of the road.
   ``He stood there and ... I heard a real loud sound from the
wheels and I saw Baruch fly into the air,'' said the friend, who was
not identified. He said he didn't want to play the game, but ``some
of the kids laughed at me so I did it.''

<HEAD>Thatcher Says She'll Visit South Africa After Mandela is Freed</HEAD>
<HEAD>Embargoed For Release 8 p.m. EST _ Time Set By Source</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 2 grafs with aide saying stance not new, background on
sanctions.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher says she believes
there are ``chances of things improving enormously'' in South Africa
if the government releases jailed nationalist leader Nelson Mandela.
   Until that happens, there is little hope for fruitful
negotiations on the nation's future, Mrs. Thatcher said in an
interview with the BBC's Africa service to be broadcast Saturday.
   She is visiting Africa next week, but South Africa is not on the
itinerary that includes Morocco, Nigeria, Malawi, and Zimbabwe.
   ``I have made it quite clear that I could not go until something
quite positive happens and Mr. Mandela is released,'' Mrs. Thatcher
said.
   ``I think that there are chances of things improving enormously
in South Africa once Mr. Mandela is released. It opens the way for
negotiations to start. But I could not go just at the moment until
there are more signs of that happening.''
   Asked what was the next likely stage of developments in South
Africa, she replied: ``I have indicated that if Mr. Mandela is
released I think that negotiations would become possible with some
of the other many leaders of black South Africans. Obviously they
are not a homogenous people any more than we are in Europe.''
   She doubted it would be possible for tribal leaders to negotiate
until Mandela was released.
   At the same time, she said she could not consider meeting with
the African National Congress that Mandela leads until the guerrilla
organization renounced violence.
   ``I think the government of South Africa would like a
renunciation of violence. We did not quite get that, and I do not
talk to those who in fact pursue their ends by violent means.''
   She continued: ``Look, we are trying to get a way through by
saying that Mr. Mandela should be released and should be free. This
is part of the bargain, he should be free in fact to put his own
view but not ... free to exercise violence.
   ``One tries to get a law-abiding country. Violence is anarchy.
The rule of the gun and rule by force is not something I've had any
sympathy with at all.''
   Asked if she believed in one man, one vote in South Africa, Mrs.
Thatcher said: ``I think you will have to have one person, one vote.
That does not necessarily mean a unitary state.
   ``They will have to work it out.''
   Mrs. Thatcher's comments do not represent a new approach. ``She's
said this for a long time now,'' an aide said.
   Mrs. Thatcher argues a moderate stance toward South Africa can
achieve more than advocating sanctions, which she argues would hurt
the country's black majority more than the white-run government, and
would devastate economies of nearby black-ruled states that depend
on South Africa's transport network to import and export goods.

<HEAD>Kidnap Suspect Once Lectured At Purdue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five weeks before his arrest on
charges of kidnapping a woman and demanding nearly $2 million
ransom, a businessman told a university business class his secrets
of success, but said he needed $500,000.
   Arthur J. Curry, 41, of West Lafayette, is accused of kidnapping
Gayle T. Cook on March 15 and demanding $1.7 million in gold bullion
and cash from her multimillionaire husband. He was arrested and Mrs.
Cook was freed the next day. He is charged with five felonies and is
jailed in Bloomington in lieu of $1 million bond.
   On Feb. 10, as a guest lecturer at Purdue University, he
expounded on his success on Wall Street and his willingness to risk
everything to succeed. He admonished students to never trust anyone
they were dealing with.
   Curry portrayed himself as a shrewd, methodical businessman who
scouted bankrupt properties for gold-mine opportunities.
   ``The first key to risk is that you have to be willing to lose
everything that you are doing,'' he said. ``You have to be willing
to say, `I've lost it all. It's all gone.' If you can't take that
risk, don't go in the business.
   He also said: ``In the next three weeks, I'm going to have to
scramble around and find a half-million dollars.''
   At the time of the lecture, a lien had been placed on the Coyote
Grill, a Lafayette restaurant Curry was developing. Another project,
a hotel in Michigan, was in bankruptcy, and Curry had just been
removed as a general partner in another Michigan hotel investment.
   He peppered his presentation with humorous remarks to make his
points about finding a risk and forming a business team to follow up.
   ``Who should be on your team? You need a lawyer. This is
absolutely fundamental,'' said Curry. ``My attitude toward a lawyer
is that I would never have a lawyer that I would invite to my home.''
   Mrs. Cook was abducted from in front of her home. A man
telephoned her husband and demanded $1.2 million in cash and
$500,000 in gold for her release.
   About 24 hours later, FBI agents and state police surrounded a
van Curry was driving behind a Bloomington shopping center,
officials said. Inside, they found Mrs. Cook, bound and gagged.
   Curry was charged with kidnapping, criminal confinement, battery,
criminal recklessness and auto theft.
   Mrs. Cook and her husband, William A. Cook, own and operate a
$250 million medical instruments firm they started 25 years ago with
a $1,500 investment.

   Space shuttle Discovery, with one of
its main engines in need of repair, returned to its launch site
Friday riding piggyback atop a jumbo jet.
   The Boeing 747 left Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., on Thursday
and arrived at the Kennedy Space Center after an overnight refueling
stop at Kelly Air Force Base in Texas.
   Discovery landed at Edwards last Saturday after completing a
five-day orbital mission during which its crew of five conducted
various experiments and deployed a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite
to complete a three-satellite space communications network.
   Discovery is scheduled to fly again Aug. 10 on a classified
Defense Department mission.
   One of the craft's three main engines will have to be replaced
because of a tiny combustion chamber leak discovered during
post-flight inspection.
   NASA said it did not know now whether the engine replacement
would have any impact on Discovery's launch schedule.
   Other than the small leak, which had no effect on the flight,
space agency officials said Discovery returned from space in better
condition than any previous orbiter.
   Meanwhile, technicians on Launch Pad 39B were continuing to groom
Atlantis for the next shuttle mission, scheduled for liftoff April
28. The shuttle's five-man crew is to release the $300 million
Magellan spacecraft on the start of a 15-month journey to the planet
Venus.
   Magellan, which is to orbit Venus and map its surface, was to be
loaded into Atlantis' cargo bay on Saturday.

   Eight chicken eggs carried into the

Purdue University student's experiment are due to hatch Saturday.
   The experiment was designed by Purdue senior John Vellinger to
learn if weightlessness has any effect on developing embryos, and
could help determine if humans can reproduce in space.
   Vellinger sent 32 eggs into space: 16 that were two days old and
16 that were nine days old. Thirty-two others were kept on Earth as
control or comparison groups.
   Half of each group was sacrificed after Discovery landed so the
chicken embryos could be studied, leaving eight eggs expected to
hatch sometime Saturday at the sponsoring Kentucky Fried Chicken
headquarters in Louisville, Ky., and eight more to hatch April 1.
   The chicks will be raised at the Baker-Purdue Animal Sciences
Center near Montmorenci, Ind., about 10 miles northwest of Purdue's
West Lafayette campus.

<HEAD>Report: Gov't to Review Probe Of Crash That Killed 256 Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Canada will review a report that blamed a buildup
of ice rather than an explosion or fire for a 1985 jetliner crash in
Newfoundland in which 256 American soldiers and civilians were
killed, a newspaper said Friday.
   A Transport Ministry spokesman, Rene Mercier, dismissed the
report in The Globe and Mail as speculation, but he said Transport
Minister Benoit Bouchard would make an announcement on the issue
next week. Mercier would not elaborate.
   The newspaper said Bouchard would announce the review next week
as part of a sweeping program to reassure Canadians about aviation
safety.
   In December, the Canadian Aviation Safety Board concluded the
crash at Gander, Newfoundland, probably was caused by ice on the
wings of the Arrow Air charter DC-8.
   That conclusion was approved by five of the board's nine members,
but the other four members issued a report saying an in-flight fire
or explosion was the most likely cause of the Dec. 12, 1985 disaster.
   The Globe's report from Ottawa said it was not clear whether the
inquiry would reopen the entire investigation of the crash or only
review the evidence compiled during the safety board's investigation.
   The crash was the worst aviation disaster ever in Canada. All
aboard were killed, including the 248 troops heading home to Fort
Campbell, Ky., after peacekeeping duties in the Middle East and
eight American crew members.
   Bouchard had announced early this month that he accepted the
board's majority conclusion and said a judicial review would not be
necessary.
   However, an internal ministry report that appeared in the Ottawa
Citizen rejected the majority conclusion and said the investigation
had focused on a ``pre-conceived'' icing theory.
   The Globe and Mail also said Friday the program to be announced
by Bouchard would include a promise to terminate the safety board
quickly and replace it with a new agency to review all types of
transportation accidents.
   It long has been believed that the government would replace the
safety board with a more comprehensive agency along the lines of the
U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.
   The board had been formed in 1984 so that an independent agency
would investigate air accidents rather than Transport Canada.
   The Globe and Mail's report said Bouchard also would appoint a
task force to examine the ministry's internal operations and its
efforts to cope with air congestion and the strained air traffic
control system.
   On March 10, an Air Ontario Fokker F-28 jet crashed near Dryden,
Ontario, killing 24 people in the first fatal crash of a regularly
scheduled commercial flight in Canada in 10 years.

   The head of the Environmental Protection Agency
ordered a review today of a controversial proposed dam and reservoir
in Colorado, a move said by agency officials to be a first step in
killing the project.
   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said he was concerned about
the Two Forks Dam project southeast of Denver because, as it was
approved earlier this month by the Corps of Engineers, it ``could
result in very serious adverse environmental impact.''
   The action amounted to a veto of a permit issued by the corps,
said Jim Scherer, the EPA's regional administrator in Denver, who
had leaned in favor of allowing the dam to be built.
   One senior agency source called Reilly's announcement ``the first
step'' in a process that is expected to scuttle the controversial
dam. ``This is the door through which you have to travel to get to a
veto'' of the entire project, said the official, speaking on the
condition that he not be identified further.
   The Two Forks dam project on the South Platte River southwest of
Denver has been the center of a bitter fight between
environmentalists and Denver area officials who say it is needed to
meet the region's future water needs.
   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly ordered the agency's regional
office in Denver ``to begin a review of potentially unacceptable
adverse enviromental effects'' the $500 million dam project might
pose.
   ``I am not convinced that the (Two Forks) dam project as proposed
will avoid environmental harm to the extent practicable or that the
proposed permit conditions will minimize or compensate for damage to
fisheries, wildlife habitat and recreation areas,'' Reilly said in a
statement.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., who has fought the Two Forks project
because of concern that it will harm wetlands in western Nebraska,
said in a telephone interview that Reilly's decision is expected to
kill the proposal.
   ``Those of us who have been fighting this proeject have won,''
said Exon. ``The EPA director has done everything that we asked him
to do. There's nothing more that he could have done. ... I think
this is the practical end to this project.''
   Reilly said the proposal as outlined by the Corps of Engineers
permit issued earlier this month ``does not resolve the critical
environmental issues'' that have surrounded the controversial
project.
   Environmentalists have said that EPA's decision on the dam will
be a barometer of how the Bush administration intends to deal with
environmental and conservation issues.
   City officials in Denver argue that the dam is needed to meet the
water needs of the metropolitan area in the late 1990s and beyond,
but environmentalists have said the 615-foot-high dam and reservoir
would be devastating to wildlife habitat up and down the river.
   Environmentalists have been urging Reilly to intervene in the
decision on the dam because the agency's regional administrator, Jim
Scherer, has indicated he favors the project if certain assurances
are included to protect the environment.
   Opponents of the dam said the provisions included in the
tentative construction permit approved by the Corps of Engineers
earlier this month do not satisfy the environmental concerns.
   ``You can hardly think of anything worse (environmentally) than
this project,'' said Daniel Luecke, an attorney for the
Environmental Defense Fund in Denver. ``It's an enormous project.
It's the most destructive way of supplying water to the city of
Denver.''
   Environmental concerns centered on the fact that the dam and
reservoir would flood a vast area where the South Platte and its
North Fork meet about 25 miles southwest of Denver. It would flood
about 20 miles of the scenic Cheesman Canyon, which has some of the
best trout fishing in the state and is home for a variety of
wildlife.
   The project also has been attacked by Nebraska officials who fear
that the dam will reduce the flow of water into the Big Bend region
of western Nebraska and the wetlands that have been a favorite
resting spot for whooping crane and numerous other birds.
   The project was proposed by the Denver Water Board and a
consortium of 41 Denver area water providers and municipalities.
   Proponents have said the dam is crucial to the region's growth.
They argue that the population of the Denver area will grow from 1.5
million people to 2.5 million people by the year 2035 and that such
growth will outstrip the area's water supply if the dam is not built.

   Cowboys fill their lives with roping,
wrangling, riding and writing _ poetry, that is. And so many of them
write they're going have an overflow convention, of sorts.
   Nearly 40 cowpunchers, farmers and ranchers from all over the
West will gather here this weekend for an exhibition of cowboy
poetry.
   Elko, Nev., home of the annual Cowboy Poetry Gathering, is the
undisputed capital city of cowboy poetry. But the popularity of
cowboy poetry has outgrown Elko in the last few years, and this
weekend's event is intended to provide the horseback bards another
showcase, said Dave Thompson, head of the organizing committee for
the First Annual Pendleton Cowboy Poet Roundup.
   Some of the cowboy authors like to conjure up images of the Old
West with poems about untamed horses and saloon gun battles.
   ``Most of mine, I try to put some humor in them,'' said Bud
Stewart, of Royal City, Wash. ``It either has to be something funny
or else a catastrophe to make an impression on an audience.''

   Lt. Gov. Lloyd Omdahl sent senators home
for a long weekend with a poem he wrote about the chamber's
rejection of a proposal to change the state's name from North Dakota
to simply Dakota:
   The Senate was on the 11th order
   As (Floyd) Stromme rose to speak
   He favored a change to Dakota
   A tear rolled down his cheek
   Soon rhetoric ran amuck
   As the cameras ground away
   (Steve) Yockim quoted Shakespeare
   And (Gerald) Waldera waxed away
   (Tim) Mathern talked of friendship
   (Rolland) Redlin voiced support
   The Democrats hadn't caucused
   But (Majority Leader William) Heigaard proved a sport
   Then the Grand Forks delegation
   Gave the negative retort
   And when the vote was taken
   Dakota was still somewhat North
   But it wasn't a decision on Dakota
   That wrenched each senate gut
   The vote was to save (Wayne) Stenehjem
   And the sex of (Raymon) Holmberg's mutt
   Stenehjem had spoken against the resolution, saying his
constituents suggested he should change his own name if he voted to
change North Dakota's.
   And Holmberg remarked that ``Fixing your name is something like
fixing your dog.''

<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said
Friday it was ready to license the operation of the $5.4 billion
Shoreham nuclear power plant, although the state already has agreed
to dismantle it.
   William Russell, regional administrator for the commission, said
a two-week plant inspection had turned up six items that needed to
be corrected before the license could be issued.
   Russell said at a news conference that 17 NRC officials who
inspected Shoreham gave the plant high marks in most areas, and said
it could be ready to operate as early as next month. The inspection
was a final step before a decision on whether to grant an operating
license to the Long Island Lighting Co.
   Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and William Catacosinos, the chairman of the
utility, signed an agreement last month under which the state would
buy the plant for $1 and dismantle it, and the utility would be
granted rate increases to make up some of its losses.
   But the utility has said it would continue to take steps to
obtain a full operating license until its full board approves the
agreement.
   Cuomo and other officials have argued that Shoreham should not be
allowed to open because the area around the plant could not be
safely evacuated during a nuclear emergency.

   President Bush voiced strong support for
further U.S. space exploration on Friday as he praised the Discovery
astronauts for ``exploring the new horizons of this nation's
technological future.''
   ``Gentlemen, your mission is accomplished. Your nation says, well
done, thank you,'' he told the five astronauts in a White House
ceremony.
   ``You showed exactly where we are going and why,'' Bush said.
   Pictures taken by the astronauts with the sophisticated IMAX
camera will add to the ``knowledge base'' of the global environment,
Bush said. ``That, in turn, will lead to reducing the threat to our
Earth's environment,'' he said.
   Bush greeted the five astronauts, who were clad in blue flight
suits, in a ceremony in the Old Executive Office Building. ``This
voyage of the shuttle Discovery is over, but its spirit lives,
linking the majesty of outer space with the greatness of Ameria.''
   ``And we're going to forge even stronger links as we reaffirm our
commitment to the shuttle program, as our science missions open up
new horizons of knowledge and as Space Station Freedom symbolizes
the promise of man,'' the president said.
   In turn, mission commander Michael Coats presented Bush with an
American flag carried aboard the shuttle on ``the first flight of
this administration,'' and said a gold shuttle charm also carried
into space had been given to first lady Barbara Bush.
   ``We deeply appreciate your words of support for our country's
space program,'' Coats said. ``We represent thousands of people that
work very hard to get the shuttle of the ground each time, and the
encouragement you've shown is deeply appreciated.''
   Coats and four crewmates returned to Earth last Saturday after
spending five days in orbit aboard space shuttle Discovery.
   The mission, the third since flights resumed following the
Challenger disaster, was the first of Bush's administration. The
president talked to the astronauts while they were in space and
invited them to the White House.
   While in orbit, Coats and his crew used a powerful 70mm camera
called IMAX to photograph areas of the Earth damaged by manmade
pollution or by violent natural events such as volcanoes. Film from
the camera is to be edited into a movie to be shown by the
Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum.
   The Discovery astronauts also launched a communications satellite
and conducted a series of experiments during the mission.
   The Bushes left the White House in early afternoon to spend the
weekend at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md.
   Travelling by motorcade because rain forced the cancellation of a
planned helicopter trip, the president stopped on the way to visit
former Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte, who is at Walter
Reed Army Medical Center in Washington for tests and treatment.
Duarte is dying of liver cancer.
   The first family was to be joined by three Bush chlidren and six
grandchildren over the weekend, as well as the family dog, Millie,
and her six week-old pups.
   Country singer Lee Greenwood, who frequently appeared at Bush
campaign events last year, and his family were to join the Bushes on
Saturday.
   The first family was to attend private Easter services at Camp
David, have their traditional Easter turkey dinner, then return to
Washington for the chistening of Ashley Walker Bush, who was born
Feb. 7.
   The child of Neil and Sharon Bush is the president's 11th
grandchild.
   On Monday, the Bushes, their children and grandchilden will
participate in the annual Easter egg roll on the White House lawn.

   Striking public employees Friday lifted
blockades of ports and airports that have isolated this French
Mediterranean island for more than a week, and they accepted a
government proposal for talks.
   Airlines operated normally from the two main airports at Ajaccio
and Bastia, carrying away tourists trapped in Corsica since the air

   Two boats unloaded 1,700 tons of meat and chicken, allowing
stores to start replenishing dwindling supplies.
   The strike by Corsica's public sector began six weeks ago, with
workers demanding a special bonus because of the unusually high
prices in Corsica.
   The cost of living in Ajaccio and Bastia, the two main Corsican
cities, is estimated at 4.2 percent above the French national
average.
   Unions Friday agreed to send representatives to Paris this
weekend for talks with the ministries of Public Services and Social
Affairs, union officials said.
   Tension had been mounting the past week with sporadic clashes
between demonstrators and police.

<HEAD>Dick Tracy Originals Missing From Museum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RYE BROOK, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No crook gets the better of Dick Tracy,
but someone has stolen valuable original panels of the famous
syndicated cartoon strip from the Museum of Cartoon Art.
   A number of Tracy panels were willed to the museum by the creator
of the jut-jawed champion of law and order, Chester Gould, who died
in 1985.
   Museum director Barbara Hammond said Friday that because of press
reports and rumors within the cartoon art community, she was
confirming that Gould strips are missing, but she declined to say
how many or what they depicted. Nor would she say how many panels
Gould had left the museum or how they had been displayed.
   ``To say more would jeopardize the investigation and the museum's
position in recovering any art work,'' Mrs. Hammond said.
   The Westchester County district attorney's office confirmed the
museum filed a complaint Tuesday but declined to give details.
   ``Those things go for a minimum of $1,200 to $1,500 apiece,''
said Dick Locher, who has been drawing the strip for Tribune Media
Services in Chicago for the past five years.
   His collaborator, Max Allen Collins of Muscatine, Iowa, who has
been writing the strip's story line since 1977, said that what Gould
left the museum ``were highly prized strips that obviously had been
set aside by the creator.''
   Collins was quoted in the Greenwich (Conn.) Time as saying he
believed some of the missing panels depicted important developments
in the history of the strip.
   Hallmarks of the strip, which originated in 1931, have been
Tracy's two-way wrist radio and its bizarrely named and drawn
characters, like the villains Pruneface, Flattop and Mumbles;
Tracy's girl friend, Tess Trueheart; and such friendlies as B.O.
Plenty and Gravel Gertie.

   Two unidentified men on Thursday delivered a colomba _ a special
Italian Easter cake _ addressed to Pasquale Raucci, the owner of a
cement company in Mercogliano, a small town about 25 miles northeast
of Naples.
   On opening the package, workers found the cake contained a
detonator and slow-burning fuse. They called police who defused the
bomb.
   Raucci, 44, has recently received anonymous telephone threats
telling him to cancel work contracts in the Port of Naples area, the
Italian news agency ANSA reported.

   Air Botswana in April will become the
first non-South African airline to provide service to Namibia,
following its independence, officials said Friday.
   The airline will begin service from Gaborone to Windhoek on April
2, a day after the U.N. independence plan for the South
African-ruled territory takes effect, said Air Botswana marketing
manager Joyce Thema.
   Until now, only South African Airways and small commercial
airlines from that country have flown to Namibia. Foreign visitors
must clear customs and immigration in South Africa before going to
the territory.
   The Air Botswana flights will bypass South Africa, but visitors
to the territory may still be checked by South African police and
other officials until independence is complete in about a year.

<HEAD>1988: Record-Breaking Year For New York Crime</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not only was 1988 the city's most murderous year,
it was also a record-breaking 12 months for aggravated assult,
larceny and car theft, according to figures released Friday.
   The reason for the crime wave can be summed up in a word: crack.
   ``It's sweeping the country,'' Assistant Chief Raymond Kelly said
of the highly addictive cocaine derivative. ``It's been here since
1986, that's when the figures started going up dramatically.''
   Murders and non-negligent manslaughters increased 13.4 percent in
a year, from 1,672 to 1,896. The old record was 1,826 people, set in
1981.
   In 1988, 36.8 percent of all the murders committed in the city
were drug-related, which means nearly two people a day lost their
lives because of drugs, Kelly said. ``And those are only the ones we
are definitely sure of. I'm sure there's more.''
   Drugs also play a significant role in auto thefts, which
skyrocketed 25.4 percent from 1987 to 1988. ``They're stealing cars,
reducing them to parts, selling them and using a portion of the
money to buy crack,'' Kelly said.
   The only decline in crime came in the number of reported rapes,
which dropped 2.7 percent from 3,507 in 1987 to 3,412 in 1988, Kelly
said.

<TEXT>
   The body of cave explorer William Floyd
Collins was laid to rest for the fifth time Friday, 64 years after
his entrapment and death in a cave.
   ``Hopefully this will be for the last time,'' said Collins'
nephew, Eugene Collins of Horse Cave.
   Collins was pronounced dead Feb. 16, 1925, 18 days after he
entered Sand Cave in western Kentucky.
   After his death, his body was recovered from the cave and buried,
later exhumed for public display, stolen and dumped along the Green
River, and then put back on display.
   The cave where Collins died is now part of Mammoth Cave National
Park, about 30 miles north of Bowling Green. Relatives and the
National Park Service worked out arrangements to re-inter the body.
   ``The story of Floyd Collins reminds us all we are fragile
beings,'' the Rev. Gary Talley told an estimated 50 friends and
relatives gathered at Mammoth Cave Baptist Church cemetery in the
park.
   Both the poor and the privileged shared ``their concern and
compassion for the plight of one of their own kind,'' said Talley,
minister at Cave Spring Baptist Church, which several of Collins'
relatives attend.
   Collins was 37 when he entered Sand Cave on Jan. 30, 1925. He was
trying to find a new entrance to Crystal Cave, the cavern he
discovered under his father's farm in Edmonson County in 1917.
   Caves in the area were privately operated then, and competition
for tourists' dollars ran high.
   Collins was on his way out of the cave when he was trapped in a
small passageway by rocks that fell onto his foot and ankle.
   More than 30 news organizations sent reporters to cover the story
of relatives, friends and strangers working to free Collins.
   The rescue efforts were ``hampered by the carnival atmosphere
swirling around the cave entrance,'' Mammoth Cave National Park
Superintendent Dave Mihalic said Friday.
   He said Collins probably remained alive most of the time he was
trapped, but died of exposure before he could be rescued.
   His body was removed from the cave and buried near an entrance to
Crystal Cave. Later, when the property was sold, his body was
disinterred, placed in a different casket and displayed in a large
cavern in Crystal Cave.
   Four years later, it was stolen and later found at the edge of
the Green River. People speculated that competitors _ jealous of the
attention his body created at Crystal Cave _ had stolen it, but no
one was ever arrested, said park historian Bob Ward.
   Eventually the body was returned to Crystal Cave, where it
remained in a black casket chained to a concrete base.
   At one point, Collins' casket was included on tours of the cave.
Until around 1948, visitors were allowed to view the body through a
window in the casket lid.
   The Park Service bought the cave in 1961 and closed it.
   ``For family members, today is a kind of a final end to what they
had considered a sore spot in their lives,'' Mihalic said.
   ``It's a final chapter; a closing of some sort.''

<HEAD>FTC Says Tentative Agreement Reached on Conditions for Purchase of
Bottlers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission said Friday it had
reached tentative agreement with Pepsico Inc. and General Cinema
Corp. on conditions for Pepsi's proposed $1.75 billion purchase of
17 soft-drink bottlers from General Cinema.
   The agreement, a draft consent order, calls for General Cinema to
retain distribution of competing brands in the Staunton, Va., and
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., areas. Both companies will maintain existing
assets and operations in those two locations while the commission
considers the order and decides whether to challenge the acquisition
in court.
   Under the draft order, the competing brands will be bottled by
Pepsi for General Cinema at cost for five years in the two cities.
General Cinema will not be required to rely on Pepsi to supply
products for distribution, according to an announcement from the
commission.
   Without such provisions, ``Pepsico would have been both a bottler
of those (competing) brands, as well as a supplier of Pepsi brand
products distributed by Pepsi-owned bottlers,'' the FTC said.
   A companion complaint, which the draft consent order would
settle, said ``the acquisition would eliminate direct competition in
branded soft drinks as well as all soft drinks between the acquired
bottler and other bottlers in the Staunton and Broward County (Fla.)
markets, and would increase the likelihood of collusion in the
markets, which are already highly concentrated and difficult to
enter.''
   In Staunton, the other brands are those of the Dr Pepper and
Barq's companies and in Fort Lauderdale they are those of Seven-Up,
Barq's and Sunkist.
   The other 15 bottlers being acquired ``are essentially bottlers
of Pepsi products,'' said Ronald B. Rowe of the commission's Bureau
of Competition.
   The draft consent order would require commission approval of any
transfer of the Staunton and Fort Lauderdale distribution operations
by General Cinema during the next 10 years. Pepsico would have to
obtain commission approval for any acquisition in those two markets
for five years, and would have to notify the commission for 10 years
of any bottler acquisition anywhere that would result in Pepsico
becoming a distributor of ``more than an insubstantial amount'' of
other brands wherever Pepsi supplies concentrate for Pepsi brands.
   The order remains open for public comment for 60 days. It is not
an admission of any allegations in the companion complaint, but if
adopted by the commission its terms carry the force of law and
violations may result in civil fines of $10,000.
   Pepsico, based in Purchase, N.Y., is one of the nation's largest
soft-drink and snack-food concerns with sales of about $11.5 billion
in 1987.
   General Cinema, based in Chestnut Hill, Mass., had revenue of
about $720 million from bottling operations in the fiscal year that
ended last Oct. 31, and also owns 1,359 movie screens in 318
theaters, a 60 percent interest in the Neiman Marcus group of retail
stores and 18 percent of Cadbury Schweppes PLC, the British candy
and soft-drink firm.

<HEAD>Contra Pact is Tacit Admission of Failure of Reagan's Approach</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's compromise policy toward
Central America was a tacit admission that his predecessor's
military approach has failed and a signal that Congress, in turn, is
willing to give Bush latitude in the region it was reluctant to
provide Ronald Reagan.
   But because the new bipartisan approach leans heavily on how
Nicaragua's Sandinista government behaves over the coming months, it
represents a respite, rather than a final settlement of the
long-running policy dispute between Congress and the White House.
   For now, both sides on Capitol Hill are willing to read the
somewhat vague and artfully drawn two-page policy agreement in their
own ways.
   Democrats stress language supporting regional peace efforts and
provisions permitting aid to the Contra rebels to be used to
relocate them into Nicaragua and re-integrate them into the
political process there. Republicans emphasize that such
resettlement is strictly voluntary, and that the agreement does not
bar future military aid to the rebels should Sandinista promises be
unfulfilled.
   The agreement means the United States ``still supports the
Contras as a viable force,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., whose most conservative colleagues were restless about the
policy accord signed by Bush and congressional leaders.
   Dole said he hoped the peace process would work and that the
Nicaraguan government would open its political system to opponents.
``But if not, if the Sandinistas continue to do what they have been
doing _ saying one thing and doing another _ you're going to see at
least an effort for military aid in the Congress.''
   But Democrats pointed out that Bush's new secretary of state,
James A. Baker III, had specifically de-emphasized that kind of
thinking during hours of talks with key lawmakers over the past
month. At the very outset of those conversations, they noted, Baker
said military aid _ the issue that bedeviled President Reagan's
relations with Congress _ would play no role in the discussions.
   Announcing the new policy at the White House on Friday, Baker
said, ``We all have to admit that the policy basically failed to
some extent, because we were not united.''
   That conclusion is underscored by an unreleased draft report from
the General Accounting Office, which concludes that Reagan's
single-minded reliance on military solutions, both in Nicaragua and
other countries in the region, ``slowed progress toward economic
reforms and development,'' which it says are the region's real
problems.
   ``U.S. policies toward the region since 1980 appear to have been
driven largely by a need to counter the threat of Soviet Bloc
expansionism,'' says the report, being prepared for Senate Foreign
Relations Committee Democrats.
   The new accord between Congress and the White House puts that
goal on a diplomatic track. It notes that continued communist
support for ``violence and subversion'' in the region violate the
five nations' peace agreements. But it calls on the Soviets and
Cubans to themselves come into compliance with the peace process by
ending their military backing for the Sandinistas and the rebels
fighting El Salvador's government.
   Congress' next step will be to pass, soon after it returns from
its Easter break next month, legislation providing the $45 million
or so needed to continue ``humanitarian'' aid to the Contras through
February 1990, after Nicaragua's scheduled national elections.
   Because of Baker's efforts to reach bipartisan accord on the
underlying policy, that step is expected to be far easier than past
aid renewals.
   More significant in the long run than the agreement to give the
new administration an extension of Contra aid is Congress'
willingness to restore to Bush the latitude to conduct policy in
Central America that it had revoked from Reagan.
   ``The Congress recognizes the need for consistency and continuity
in policy and the responsibility of the executive to administer and
carry out that policy, the programs based upon it, and to conduct
American diplomacy in the region,'' the document stated.
   Reagan's covert war against the Sandinistas, which led to the
Iran-Contra affair, also prompted a plethora of restrictions on
money spent in the region.
   For Bush, lawmakers are willing simply to say that they support
the use of rewards and punishments to encourage the Sandinistas
along the road to democratization, and for now will let the
administration decide which actions to take and when to take them.

<TEXT>
   An oil tanker ran aground today about 25
miles outside this port, spilling an estimated 200,000 barrels of
crude oil into Prince William Sound, the Coast Guard said.
   Cmdr. Stephen McCall, commander of the port at the southern end
of the Alaska oil pipeline, said the Exxon Valdez was heading
outbound from the Alyeska marine terminal with 1.26 million barrels
of oil aboard when it ran hard aground at Bligh Reef.
   Petty Officer John Gonzales estimated that by midmorning, an oil
slick streched southward five miles into the sound from the site of
the tanker, toward an open body of water.
   ``At present, we don't see it approaching any land,'' he said.
   There were no reports of injuries, officials said. The crew
remained aboard the tanker.
   ``The ship is hard aground. It's not moving at this time,''
McCall said.
   ``There definitely are holes in the hull,'' he said. Three tanks
on the right side of the tanker have holes, he said, and ``we think
the centerline tanks also have holes.''
   Gonzales said estimates put the leak at 200,000 barrels, or 8.4
million gallons, and said the tanker continued to leak at about
20,000 gallons an hour.
   Employees of the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., which runs the
800-mile trans-Alaska pipeline for a consortium of oil companies,
were on their way to try to contain the oil with booms, he said.
   Two Coast Guard investigators went aboard the tanker to begin
looking into the cause.
   Officials think the vessel may have gone aground as the captain
tried to maneuver around icebergs from the Columbia glacier,
Gonzales said. There is a hole or gash in the vessel below the water
line, he said, and divers planned to go down and assess the damage
in more detail.
   He said the new estimate of leakage came from looking at
videotapes taken of the scene by pilots flying over. Earlier, the
size of the spill was put at 150,000 barrels.
   The Coast Guard had no immediate detail on of damage to the
shoreline or marine environment.
   The 987-foot tanker, which has a capacity of 1.3 million barrel
in about 15 large tanks, left Valdez at 10 p.m. AST on Thursday and
ran ground about 12:30 a.m. today (4:30 a.m. EST), officials said.
The tanker is owned by Exxon Shipping Co., based in Houston.
   Valdez, the nation's northernmost ice-free port, is a town of
3,100 about 125 miles east of Anchorage. It looks out onto the
island-dotted Prince William Sound, which is near a number of
recreation areas. Fishing, as well as tourism, is an important
industry, but the main seasons for various types of fishing are
still weeks away.
   The Coast Guard was responding to two concerns _ pollution and
the safety of the ship, McCall said.
   ``It appears that the rate of release of the oil has been greatly
reduced. It probably lost the largest portion of that oil when it
ran aground. But it's still leaking.
   ``A concern we have, too, is the structural integrity of the
ship,'' McCall said. ``We're concerned about what further damage
would be done if attempts were made to remove it (the vessel) early.
   ``We've got the pollution to go after and the off-loading.''
   Another tanker, the Exxon Baton Rouge, is not far from the
stricken tanker and officials hoped oil could be transferred from
the Valdez to the Baton Rouge, McCall said.
   The worst oil spill in terms of financial loss claims was the 66
million-gallon spill from the tanker Amoco Cadiz off the coast of
Brittany in France in March 1978, according to the Guinness Book of
World Records. Losses were put at $1.7 billion.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's choice to
head the civil rights division resigned from that division in the
early 1960s shortly after he flunked the District of Columbia bar
exam, a Justice Department spokeswoman said Friday.
   However, spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade said she could not
confirm that William Lucas had been forced to resign because of the
failed bar exam, as Hearst News Service reported.
   Burstion-Wade said she did not have records from the personnel
office pertaining to whether Lucas was forced to leave the division
and had been unable to reach Lucas to ask him about it.
   He passed the Michigan bar exam in 1971, she said, adding that he
would not have to pass the District of Columbia bar if he became
assistant attorney general in charge of the civil rights division.
   Civil rights groups have expressed concern that Lucas, a black
Democrat-turned-Republican who ran unsuccessfully for governor of
Michigan in 1986, might be the wrong person to head the civil rights
division.
   Lucas was offered a job in the Justice Department's criminal
division in April 1962, and the former New York City police officer
took the position after he completed law school at Fordham
University. He was hired as an attorney contingent on his passing
the District of Columbia bar exam within nine months, Burstion-Wade
said.
   In August 1963, he became a legal assistant in the department's
civil rights division and, in November 1963, was given a one-month
extension to await the results of the bar exam, she said, adding
that such extensions are standard procedure.
   He did not pass the exam and, in December 1963, became an
investigator for the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, she said.
   Lucas remained with the Commission on Civil Rights for six weeks,
leaving in January 1964 to join the FBI, Burstion-Wade said. He was
assigned first to the Cincinnati field office and, in 1965 to the
Detroit office, where he remained until June 1968, when he resigned.
   Although Thornburgh announced a month ago that Lucas was his
choice to head the division, the White House still has not nominated
him formally.
   Burstion-Wade said part of the reason for the delay was that
Lucas ``was just interviewed last week by the FBI.'' People who had
been interviewed by the FBI several weeks earlier also have not yet
been formally nominated by the White House, she said.
   Lucas, who is in private legal practice in Detroit, has said on
resumes that he served as an ``assistant U.S. attorney'' or as ``an
investigator and attorney in the U.S. Justice Department,'' despite
the fact that he did not actually serve as an attorney since he had
not passed the bar.
   Lucas said recently that he ``was classified as an attorney,''
and believed that he ``was an attorney with the Justice
Department.'' But he also has said that discrepancies on his resumes
were due to ``carelessness.''

   Indian peacekeeping forces have killed
more than 300 Tamil civilians in a northern district, the most
powerful and biggest Tamil rebel group said Friday. India dismissed
the charge as propaganda.
   In New Delhi, the leader of the Tamils' semiautonomous government
warned there will be a blood bath unless authorities in Colombo give
his officials more power.
   An Indian High Commission official in Sri Lanka said the rebel
charges were their ``usual propaganda.'' He said 76 militants and 26
soldiers have been killed in operations this month in northern
Mullaitivu district.
   Sri Lankan officials said the dead include nine soldiers and six
militants who were killed in hand-to-hand fighting Thursday and two
soldiers killed when rebels blew up their jeep.
   ``The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam today accused the Indian
army of committing the crime of genocide against the Tamil people in
its desperate drive to crush the armed resistance of the Tamil Tiger
guerrillas in the northeastern region of Sri Lanka,'' a rebel
statement said.
   It said Indian troops have killed more than 300 civilians in
Mullaitivu since March 2, when the soldiers started searching the
area for rebels.
   It was not possible to investigate the rebel charges
independently.
   Mullaitivu is 175 miles northeast of Colombo, and the Tamil
Tigers are believed to be based in the district's marshy jungles.
   At least 40,000 Indian soldiers are in Sri Lanka to put down the
Tamil insurrection. The troops initially were deployed to supervise
a rebel arms surrender agreed in an Indian-sponsored peace accord
July 1987.
   The rebels reneged two months later. Nevertheless, the government
set up a Northeastern Provincial government to give Tamils limited
autonomy.
   In New Delhi, the new government's chief minister Vardarajan
Perumal appealed to the Indian government to intercede to save the
accord, which he said is jeopardized by the Colombo government's
``intransigent and adamant attitude.''
   Perumal said his government has no control over education,
administrative services, law and order and allotment and
distribution of land.
   ``If there is no reasonable solution, everything will collapse,''
Perumal told a news conference.
   ``How far (the Sri Lankan government) will devolve power will
determine the unity and integrity of Sri Lanka,'' he said. ``We will
ask, then we will request and then we will appeal. If there is no
response, we will take.''
   Perumal said Indian leaders had made no commitments.
   ``The Indian government says it will do the maximum but they are
requesting us to be patient,'' he said. ``We feel that if the
provincial council fails there will be no solution except a blood
bath.''
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and say
the majority Sinhalese discriminate against them in and jobs and
education.
   At least 8,500 people, including 800 Indian soldiers, have been
killed since 1983, when Tamil militants started a campaign for a
separate state. India got involved because of the sympathies of its
own 60 million Tamils.

in daylight heists, federal officials said Friday.
   The art works and antiques, ranging from the $2 million vase to
16 antique pocket watches, have a total value of $3.5 million,
according to the FBI.
   The works were taken from Jan. 12 to Feb. 25 from museums in
Boston, Baltimore, Detroit, Syracuse and Albany, N.Y., and Columbus,
Ohio.
   George A. Athanasatos, 34, and Ronald Corteselli, 28, both of New
York, pleaded innocent to theft charges and were ordered held
without bail.
   A total of 25 objects were stolen, officials said.
   The two men ``have been linked with some but not all of these
items,'' U.S. Attorney Benito Romano told a news conference where
most of the recovered objects were displayed.
   James Fox, head of the FBI's New York office, said most of the
objects were taken during normal working hours when the museums were
open to the public.
   They were removed from plexiglass-covered display cases which did
not have burglar alarms, he said.
   The five-count federal indictment charged the pair with
transporting across state lines and selling antique watches worth
$150,000, stolen from the Baltimore Museum of Art.
   Athanasatos also was charged with interstate transportation of a
$50,000 silver Tiffany pitcher stolen from the Detroit Institute of
Art on Jan. 12.
   The pitcher was recovered by the FBI on March 6 after it was sold
to an antiques dealer for $15,000.
   Both men were ordered detained without bail because of other
outstanding warrants, said defense lawyer Edward Rappaport.
   They were indicted last week by a federal grand jury in Boston on
stolen goods trafficking involving the 14th century, Yuan Dynasty
vase, worth $2 million, that was stolen from the Boston Museum of
Fine Arts.
   The blue and gray vase was among the recovered objects displayed
by the FBI.

   The front wheel of a jetliner with
83 people aboard got stuck in a runway pothole at an airport in
northwestern Brazil, but no one was injured, an official said Friday.
   The Varig airlines Boeing 737 had just landed Thursday at
Uberlandia, 600 miles northwest of Rio, after a flight from the
northern city of Belem, a spokeswoman for the Brazilian airline said.
   As it was taxiing to the gate, the front wheel slipped into a
runway pothole and jammed. The passengers were taken from the plane,
which was later towed from the runway, and the pothole was being
repaired, the spokeswoman said.

<TEXT>
   More than 5,000 opposition activists
marched through Dhaka on Friday to protest the rule of President
Hussain Muhammad Ershad, who seized power in a bloodless coup seven
years ago.
   ``Gen. Ershad has killed democracy and his government is ruining
the country's economy,'' said Khaleda Zia, head of the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party, the major opposition alliance, in an address to
the rally.
   Two other protest rallies were held elsewhere in the capital as
police in riot gear watched. Ershad is away on a three-day official
tour of France.
   Mrs. Zia said opposition groups will have to unite to achieve
``democracy and impartial elections.''
   Ershad, 59, took power in a bloodless coup on March 24, 1982, and
imposed martial law after sacking the civilian government of
President Abdus Sattar.
   Sattar was head of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, founded by
Mrs. Zia's husband, Ziaur Rahman.
   Ershad lifted martial law in November 1986 when he won the
presidential election. Opposition parties boycotted 1988 elections,
which were won by Ershad's Jatiya Party and were widely denounced as
fraudulent.

   Billie Hurst worked as a librarian at
Southwest Missouri State University for 30 years, yet she never got
around to cashing paychecks totaling more than $100,000.
   The 72-year-old woman got the money anyway Friday when State
Treasurer Wendell Bailey presented an $88,100.85 check to Miss
Hurst's cousin and guardian, Frances Jane Gleghorn, after a special
act of the Legislature made that possible.
   Bailey's office said it already had re-issued checks amounting to
$20,024.53 for uncashed checks not more than 5 years old, bringing
the total reimbursement to $108.125.33.
   Miss Hurst occasionally cashed a paycheck, Mrs. Gleghorn said,
but co-workers tried for years to get her to cash the rest of the
checks.
   ``I really don't know why she didn't cash the checks. That's what
everybody asks,'' Mrs. Gleghorn said. ``I know she was reminded
several times they should be cashed ... but she just didn't go ahead
and do it.''
   Mrs. Gleghorn said many of the uncashed checks probably were
destroyed when the rundown house Miss Hurst lived in for many years
was demolished for safety reasons.
   Miss Hurst retired in 1986 and now lives in a Springfield
retirement center. Mrs. Gleghorn, appointed Miss Hurst's guardian in
August, said her cousin has suffered from memory problems for
several years.
   Mrs. Gleghorn asked state Rep. Dan Woodall and state Sen. Dennis
Smith for help in getting the money. Working with state officials,
Mrs. Gleghorn verified records of Miss Hurst's paychecks between
1963 and 1983, except for a two-year period.
   Since the state treasurer is not obligated to honor an uncashed
check more than five years old, the Legislature had to enact a
special appropriations measure so Miss Hurst could be paid, and Gov.
John Ashcroft signed it into law.
   ``I'm relieved it's over,'' Mrs. Gleghorn said. ``Should she need
extra care in the future, it's good to know there's some money
there.''

   A glass-covered tour boat carrying 500 people on the
Seine River collided with a barge near Notre Dame Cathedral, killing
one person, officials said Friday.
   Police said the captains of the vessels blamed each other for the
crash Thursday night between the Notre Dame and Arcole bridges in
one of the most picturesque spots of central Paris.
   Firefighters treated 10 people for shock and took 10 others
suffering from sprains and bruises to hospitals, according to
police. Eleven Americans, two Spaniards and four Portuguese were
among those treated, police said. All those who were taken to
hospitals were released.
   Manuel Bessa, 28, a Portuguese student on the tour boat, was
killed when he was struck in the head by an open window that swung
shut in the impact of the collision, police said.
   Frogmen searched the river to make sure no one had been knocked
overboard.
   The accident occurred when the tour boat, known as the Bateau
Mouche, was hit head on by the 2,500-ton barge, part of a convoy of
five vessels.
   Sources close to the investigation quoted the tour boat captain
as saying the barge was poorly lighted. The barge captain said the
Bateau Mouche failed to respect the rules of navigation on the
Seine, ignoring a signal.
   The tourist boat is one of nine that ply the Seine daily,
lighting up historic buildings of old Paris with huge spotlights.
   The owner of Bateau Mouche boats said 1.75 million people went on
Seine cruises in 1988. Company officials said they could not recall
any comparable accident in the company's 40-year history.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Michel Aoun rejected a truce in his
Christian army's fight with Druse militiamen and Syrian soldiers,
and declared Friday he will settle for nothing less than Syrian
withdrawal from Lebanon.
   The 17-day-old artillery and rocket battle, in which Syrian
troops joined the Druse this week, resumed in the afternoon after a
14-hour lull.
   Hundreds of rounds fell on both sides of the line that divides
Beirut between Christians and Moslems, and on Druse and Christian
towns in the mountains overlooking the capital, police said.
   Rocket volleys and popping flares lighted the night sky and
rumbling explosions shook the city.
   Police had no immediate report on casualties, but have given the
total in previous action as 81 people killed and 253 wounded, most
of them civilians.
   It is the worst fighting since 1985 in Lebanon's 14-year-old
civil war and magnifies a political crisis that arose last fall,
creating sectarian army commands and competing Christian and Moslem
governments.
   Aoun said he would continue the battle even if Beirut is
demolished.
   ``This city has been wiped out by seven or eight earthquakes in
ancient history,'' he said. ``We will build a ninth Beirut if it is
destroyed in this confrontation.''
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said the United States was withdrawing
a military ``technical assistance team at the Defense Ministry as
part of the embassy's policy of reducing American personnel due to
the current situation.''
   He said one member of the three-man team already was abroad on
vacation. The Americans came to Lebanon in 1983 to train army
personnel in the use of U.S.-made equipment.
   In Washington, the State Department issued a statement saying
``everyone with influence ought to act in a responsible manner and
exercise restraint.'' It did not name Syria, but officials said the
U.S. Embassy in Damascus had spoken with Syrian authorities about
the need for a cease-fire.
   Aoun told a news conference the Americans were being pulled out
shortly before the end of their term and ``their withdrawal will
not have any effect on the army.''
   He leads the interim Christian government in addition to
commanding the 20,000 Christians in the Lebanese army, who are much
better equipped than the 22,000 Moslems led by Maj. Gen. Sami
Khatib.
   Khatib's men have helped blockade the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave north and east of Beirut but appear to have stayed out of
the fighting, which began two days after Aoun blockaded illegal
ports operated by Moslem militias.
   The Christian commander held a news conference at the
presidential palace in suburban Baabda after meeting with Kuwait's
ambassador to Syria, Ahmed Jassem, who told reporters they
discussed ``a cease-fire and a solution to the present
confrontation.''
   Jassem saw Aoun again after a session in Moslem west Beirut with
Salim Hoss, the Sunni Moslem premier of the Syrian-backed Moslem
government, then returned to Syria without comment.
   Aoun said his confrontation with the Syrians and Walid
Jumblatt's Druse militia was ``a nationalist march to liberate
Lebanon.''
   ``It is the responsibility of the whole people,'' he said. ``The
life of the Lebanese should no more be in the hands of a Syrian
soldier who can pull the trigger any minute.''
   Syria is ``a terrorist country,'' he said, and ``we can't figure
out how a terrorist country can have a peacekeeping role.''
   Neighboring Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League and Hafez Assad, the
Syrian president, has become this country's main power broker in
the chaos of civil war.
   Aoun said he is pursuing a ``nationalist cause, not a Christian
cause'' in fighting the Syrians and their allies.
   ``The Syrians are slaughtering us,'' he said of Lebanon. ``They
are trying to eliminate our country ... reduce it to ashes.''
   Asked whether the current violence would would block efforts by
an Arab League mediation committee to settle the crisis, he
replied: ``It shouldn't.''
   Jassem was sent to Beirut Thursday by the six-man Arab League
committee, which Arab foreign ministers formed at an emergency
meeting in January. Sheik Sabah Ahmad Sabah, Kuwait's foreign
minister, is the chairman.
   The crisis was born when President Amin Gemayel's six-year term
ended Sept. 22 and Parliament could not agree on a successor.
   Gemayel named Aoun to lead an interim government but Moslems,
with Syria's support, swore allegiance to Hoss, who had been
premier under Gemayel. The army commands split as a result of the
sectarian division in government.
   An unwritten covenant dating to independence from France in 1943
requires the president to be a Christian, the premier a Sunni
Moslem and the parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.

<HEAD>Georgia Democratic Official Involved In Gingrich Book Promotion Deal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Georgia Democratic Party official said
Friday he invested $5,000 to help promote Rep. Newt Gingrich's book
in 1984 because he thought the newly elected House GOP whip had a
message that ``ought to get out.''
   But Joel Cowan, a Peachtree City, Ga., real estate developer who
serves as treasurer of the state Democratic Party and honorary
chief of staff to Democratic Gov. Joe Frank Harris, said he has
never supported Gingrich politically and has never contributed to
his congressional campaigns.
   In fact, Cowan said in a telephone interview, he contributed
$500 last year to Gingrich's Democratic opponent, David Worley.
   Cowan's investment in a partnership set up to promote Gingrich's
book, ``Window of Opportunity,'' was disclosed Friday by the Wall
Street Journal in a article that also said Cowan's company had
received a $204,480 grant in 1988 from the Department of Housing
and Urban Development.
   Cowan denied having received such a grant. And HUD officials,
after searching department records Friday, said they could find no
evidence of a grant award last year to Cowan's company, Cowan and
Associates.
   But Beth Almond in the economics and analysis branch of HUD's
Atlanta regional office said Cowan and Associates was given
preliminary approval by HUD in 1978 for a 60-unit low income
housing project for the elderly in Peachtree City.
   The letter of approval said HUD would pay rent subsidies to the
tenants once the project was completed and the Farmers Home
Administration would guarantee the financing for the units.
   Ms. Almond said a 1980 letter involving the same project listed
the total annual rent subsidy pledged by HUD for the 60 units at
$204,480. But she said that letter was addressed to someone other
than Cowan and Associates and would ``appear to indicate'' Cowan
had dropped out of the project.
   Cowan was one of 21 investors who put up $5,000 each to promote
Gingrich's book in exchange for a promise of half the publisher's
profits. But there were not enough sales to produce profits and
Cowan said all he got for his $5,000 was six copies of the book and
a tax writeoff.
   Gingrich has promised to disclose the names of all 21 once he
can contact them and obtain their permission. Thus far he has
identified only three, including James Tidwell of Douglasville,
Ga., James Richards of Carrollton and former Georgia Rep. Howard
``Bo'' Callaway.
   Cowan said he became interested in Gingrich's book in 1983 when
Gingrich mentioned the project during a speech to the Aspen Group,
a mostly Republican group of real estate professionals.
   Cowan said he invited Gingrich to speak at that meeting because
``I thought he had a message. At the time he was speaking out on
supply side economics and he was an outspoken conservative voice.''
   Cowan said the members of the group who attended the Aspen
meeting split the cost of Gingrich's travel and lodging expenses.

   A survey released Friday indicated majority
support for Yitzhak Shamir's refusal to deal with the PLO, but
President Bush said he would try to persuade the prime minister
``something good might come'' from talks.
   Shamir and Bush are to confer in Washington on April 6.
   Israel radio and Arab sources said two Palestinians died of
wounds suffered earlier, and Arab reports said Israeli soldiers
wounded 25 Palestinians during protests in nine towns and refugee
camps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   One of the wounded was said to be a 4-month-old girl hit in the
head by a rubber bullet.
   The two deaths raised to 407 the number of Palestinians killed
since an uprising began in the occupied territories more than 15
months ago. Eighteen Israelis have been slain.
   Seven moderate Palestinian leaders in Nablus, the West Bank's
largest city, have been threatened with death if they continue
meeting with Israeli officials about peace, Arab sources reported.
   Friday's survey by the independent Modain Ezrahi organization
said 56 percent of 1,251 Israeli Jews chosen at random said ``no''
when asked: ``Do you believe there is room for negotiating with the
PLO and if so, toward what end?'' The survey's margin of error was
given as plus or minus 2 percent.
   A survey conducted in December indicated 54 percent of Israelis
favored talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization, on
condition it ceased attacking Israeli targets.
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism in December and
recognized Israel's right to exist. The United States initiated
contacts after Arafat's public declaration and the second formal
meeting was held Wednesday in Tunis.
   Rachel Israeli of Modain Ezrachi attributed the change in
response between December and March to the fact that organization
asked only about talks without mentioning an end to terrorism or
any other condition.
   ``Many people do not believe the PLO has stopped their terror
activities,'' she said.
   Bush was quoted in an interview published Friday in the
Washington Times as saying of his forthcoming meeting with Shamir:
``I will tell him that the talks that we ... are having with the
PLO representatives there in Tunis are good things'' and would try
to persuade the Israeli leader ``something good might come out of
this kind of discussion.''
   Asked whether he would urge Shamir to join the talks, the paper
said, Bush replied: ``I don't know what I'll say to him about that,
but I'll say to him that we have got to move the peace process
forward. We may, by then, be ready with some specific ideas.''
   Israeli news reports have said Bush planned to propose a first
stage of negotiations with Palestinians in the occupied
territories, with the PLO joining talks later on the final status
of the territories.
   Arab sources, speaking privately, said the death threats
involved two masked Arab youths from a dissident PLO faction who
visited the Palestinian moderates March 17.
   They identified the faction as the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, led by Dr. George Habash and based in
Syria.
   The Jerusalem Post said the men were threatened at knifepoint.
It said supporters of Arafat were among them, including Dr. Hatem
Abu Ghazaleh, a former member of the Nablus city council.
   Abu Ghazaleh was reached by telephone and denied receiving
threats.
   A leaflet circulated in Arab East Jerusalem urged Palestinians
to freeze contacts with Israeli officials to prevent Shamir from
pursuing plans to circumvent the PLO in peace talks, Israel
television reported.
   In an interview with the daily Maariv, Shamir was quoted as
saying he would pursue secret talks with non-PLO Palestinians.
   ``There are among them wise people, intellectuals,'' Shamir
said. ``I am not going to reveal their names because it may bring
them harm.''
   Hadashot, another daily, said he might have the Shin Bet secret
police investigate a leak last week of a secret military report
that concluded there were no non-PLO Palestinians with whom Israel
could negotiate peace. A Shamir aide denied the report.
   Marwan Abu Taman, 19, of Tulkarem in the West Bank, died Friday
of chest wounds suffered in a confrontation with soldiers two days
earlier, Arab reports said. Israel radio said Mohammed Aziz Nasser,
23, died at a hospital in Arab east Jerusalem the day after an
explosive device went off in his hands.

<TEXT>
   A militant Moslem group has acquired two
U.S.-made Stinger surface-to-air missiles originally intended for
Afghan guerrillas, Ash-Shiraa magazine reported Friday.
   The weekly quoted an unidentified source close to the group as
saying the shoulder-held missiles ``have reached Lebanon through an
embassy that provided part of the large sum paid.''
   The magazine did not identify the group or the embassy.
   It also did not specify whether the fundamentalists were Shiite
or Sunni Moslem. Sunni factions have been inactive in Lebanon for
some time, however, and the magazine implied the militants belonged
to a pro-Iranian Shiite group.
   The missiles were shipped by the United States to seven Afghan
guerrilla factions based in Pakistan, the magazine said. The
phrasing of the report indicated the Moslem Afghan guerrillas sold
the Stingers to the Lebanese group.
   The Stinger is the U.S. Armed Forces' most potent anti-aircraft
weapon. The Afghan insurgents used the missiles to shoot down
Soviet fighter-bombers, helicopters and transport planes in the
nine-year war against Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
   Ash-Shiraa said the Lebanese group was trying to smuggle the
Stingers out of the country, but did not elaborate.
   The report followed warnings of possible attacks on American
jetliners as part of Iran's confrontation with Western nations over
Salman Rushdie's book, ``The Satanic Verses.'' Many Moslems say the
novel defames Islam.
   Britain's domestic news agency, Press Association, quoted an
unidentified spokesman for the U.S. Federal Aviation Association as
saying U.S. airlines and airports around the world have been put on
alert for possible terrorist action.
   Ash-Shiraa gained international fame in November 1986 when it
broke the story of secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in return for
American hostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Shiite factions.
   But the magazine's recent reports on the 15 foreign captives
held mainly by pro-Iranian factions have been inaccurate.

   Hundreds of civilians fled from two
village after rebels of the Holy Spirit Movement attacked and
looted their homes, the government-owned New Vision newspaper
reported Friday.
   It reported women, children and elderly people thronged the road
to nearby Lira after the attack Thursday on Alawo and Anyeke in the
northern district of Apac, 280 north of Kampala, Uganda's capital.
   New Vision quoted one witness, who was not identified, as
saying, ``The rebels surrounded the villages and shouted, `Don't
run!' Moments later they started unleashing terror on the
villagers.''
   The newspaper said witnesses did not know how many people were
killed and wounded.
   The rebels, led by Joseph Konyi, have been terrorizing northern
villages since early last year. They first used the name Lakwena 2
after the Holy Spirit Movement led by warrior-priestess Alice
Lakwena was crushed by army troops in late 1987. Ms. Lakwena fled
to Kenya and her follower returned to their home region in northern
Uganda and regrouped.
   Konyi subsequently became leader and adopted the Holy Spirit
Movement name. Army sources estimate that he has from 1,200 to
2,500 followers.
   The sources say his rebels follow some of the practices
encouraged by Ms. Lakwena, including smearing their bodies with oil
in the belief it will repel bullets.

<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said Friday
he is directing his department's scientists to devote more
attention to new methods of nuclear waste cleanup to support a plan
to establish cleanup priorities and schedules over the next five
years.
   Watkins wrote members of Congress that he hopes to have the
cleanup plan in place by August.
   During the next five years, ``immediate problems'' will be
``corrected'' and detailed long-term cleanup plans will be drawn up
for each site, said spokesman Phil Keif.
   The department produces nuclear weapons in at least 16
laboraties and factories in 12 states. Waste, both nuclear and
chemical, generated since the formation of the World War II
Manhattan Project in 1942 has resulted in massive contamination of
some areas around the facilities.
   The laboratories include some of the national laboratories run
by the department, where some of the nation's best scientists have
conducted basic research in a wide range of scientific disciplines.
It is these scientists that Watkins will call on for more
environmental work, possibly designating facilities to be in charge
of particular techniques or fields.
   Watkins told a Senate committee earlier this month that he
doubts the accuracy of common cleanup cost estimates of $60 billion
to $100 billion. ``I don't believe we need all those gold
watches,'' or frills, he said then.
   In his letter to Congress, Watkins said the five-year plan will
be composed of site plans that will ensure compliance with all
applicable state and federal requirements; ``will characterize and
assess the extent of contamination, where it exists, and assess
potential risk. The highest priorities will be placed on facilities
where contamination has occured that may potentially affect public
heatlh and the environment.''
   In addition, the department will ``assess current technology
development activities and provide a basis for future research,
development and demonstration of new and innovative environmental
technologies.''
   He said he intended to ``establish with Congress and the states
agreed-upon milestones to address the development of new
technologies as well as our environmental cleanup
responsibilities.''

   Joel Steinberg today received a maximum sentence
of 8 to 25 years in prison for killing 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg,
his illegally adopted daughter.
   State Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax, saying Steinberg
showed ``extreme callousness'' and no remorse after the slaying,
also recommended against parole. Steinberg would normally be
eligible for parole in less than seven years because he has already
been jailed for nearly 17 months since his arrest.
   Steinberg, 47, was convicted of first-degree manslaughter Jan.
30 for the November 1987 beating death. Hundreds of letter writers
had urged that he get the maximum punishment.
   The death resulted from Steinberg's ``life of violence,
selfishness and self-gratification at the expense of other
people,'' Assistant District Attorney John McCusker told the court.
``Mr. Steinberg has shown not one ounce of remorse for killing
Elizabeth.''
   An emotional Steinberg, who did not testify at his trial,
addressed the court before his sentencing, saying, ``I understand
the meaning of remorse. I have remorse about losing my life.''
   He insisted he had not abused his daughter. ``At no point did I
ever ... neglect her, did I ever strike her in any way,'' he said.
   Steinberg _ who smiled, chuckled and fidgeted while his lawyers
offered lengthy presentencing motions _ wanted the judge to ``feel
he is worthy of redemption,'' defense attorney Perry Reich said
earlier.
   But Assistant District Attorney Peter Casolaro, in a presentence
report released this morning, called Steinberg an ``insensitive,
remorseless killer'' who should receive the maximum sentence
without chance of parole.
   ``In the year and half since (Lisa's) death, he has yet to
express any remorse for killing her,'' Casolaro wrote in an 18-page
presentencing memorandum.
   ``Society needs to be protected from such a self-centered,
insensitive, remorseless killer,'' the memo continued. ``The only
appropriate sentence is the maximum sentence ... with a
recommendation against any parole.''
   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Rothwax had
gotten hundreds of letters from adoptive parents, childless couples
and people abused as children urging him to throw the book at
Steinberg.
   The sources said letters from Alaska to Florida also came from
child advocacy groups and domestic violence projects, including a
Georgia organization responsible for writing more than 100 letters.
   Not one of the letters recommended mercy for Steinberg, the
sources said, and some demanded the death penalty, which New York
lacks.
   Rothwax, asked to make the letters public, said he had destroyed
any letters involving the case.
   But a family advocacy group, Family Dynamics Inc., showed
reporters its letter to the judge, which said the maximum sentence
``will communicate that unspeakable crimes against children shall
not be condoned.''
   A disbarred lawyer, Steinberg had received the child shortly
after birth from an unwed teen-ager and raised her as his own
rather than arranging for the baby's adoption as he had promised.
   Charges against Hedda Nussbaum, Steinberg's long-time live-in
companion, were dropped when prosecutors determined she was too
physically and mentally incapacitated to be responsible for the
girl's death.
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, testified under immunity as the star
prosecution witness in Steinberg's trial, during which defense
attorneys contended she was responsible for Lisa's fatal beating.
   The Steinberg case focused national attention on domestic
violence and the question of who should report cases of suspected
child abuse.

   Jurors who sentenced Randall Dale Adams to die 12
years ago say they are convinced they erred in declaring him
guilty, but blame a prosecutor for swaying their minds by
suppressing evidence.
   Adams, 40, was greeted by yellow ribbons and rousing cheers when
he returned Thursday to Columbus, Ohio, after the Dallas County
district attorney dropped the case against him.
   He was freed on bond Tuesday after the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals ordered a new trial. His case garnered wide attention after
``The Thin Blue Line,'' a documentary film, raised doubts about his
guilt.
   ``If he had gone to the death chamber and all this had come out
later, that would have been a horrible thing to have on my
conscience,'' said Bette Jane Fain, jury forewoman at Adams' 1977
trial.
   Adams came within three days of execution in 1980 for the
shooting death of Dallas officer Robert Wood before his sentence
was commuted to life in prison.
   ``Based on everything that I have seen and read and on this
man's reactions, I just don't believe the man is guilty,'' Ms.
Fain, 66, told the Dallas Morning News.
   Dallas County District Attorney John Vance said Thursday he
would not seek a new trial and filed a motion to dismiss the
capital murder charge against Adams.
   The appeals court, in ordering a new trial for Adams, ruled
prosecutor Doug Mulder had allowed a key witness to commit perjury
and had suppressed evidence that the witness' original description
of the killer did not match Adams.
   ``It makes you wonder sometimes about the judicial system,''
said juror Elliott Rammey. ``If somebody as powerful as the DA's
office can manipulate witnesses, it seems to me there's something
wrong.
   ``Hopefully, we'll all learn something from it,'' Rammey, 47,
said.
   Mulder has denied any misconduct and said he believes Adams is
guilty. He did not immediately return a telephone call Friday by
The Associated Press.
   ``If anything was kept from us, I blame Doug Mulder,'' juror
Doris Hooper, 74, said. ``What happened is not the jury's fault.''

   The veteran astronaut who commanded
the first space shuttle flight after the Challenger disaster
announced he will leave NASA next month to take a job at the
Pentagon.
   Navy Capt. Frederick ``Rick'' Hauck announced Thursday his
resignation after 11 years with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   Hauck leaves NASA April 3 and will become director of Navy Space
Systems on the staff of the chief of naval operations in late May.
   After the 1986 Challenger explosion, Hauck worked in Washington
as the NASA associate administrator in charge of congressional
relations.
   He returned to Houston and was commander of the Sept. 29 launch
of Discovery, which marked NASA's return to manned space missions.
   Hauck also commanded a 1984 shuttle mission and was a pilot
during his first shuttle flight in 1983.

<HEAD>EPA Raises Concerns About Proposed Project in Colorado</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency raised
serious concerns Friday about a controversial proposed dam and
reservoir in Colorado, threatening to scuttle the $500 million
project if no additional safeguards are provided.
   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said the Two Forks Dam
project near Denver ``could result in very serious adverse
environmental impact'' and ordered the regional office to
immediately examine ``alternative water sources'' with city
officials.
   Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb., said Reilly's decision is expected
to kill the proposal. ``Those of us who have been fighting this
project have won. ... I think this is the practical end to this
project,'' said Exon in a telephone interview.
   Reilly announced he had begun procedures which amount to
overruling a construction permit issued earlier this month by the
Corps of Engineers and which could lead to a veto of the project if
compromises are not worked out.
   ``This is the door through which you have to travel to get to a
veto'' of the project, said a senior EPA official, speaking on the
condition that he not be identified by name.
   The Two Forks dam project on the South Platte River southwest of
Denver has been the center of a bitter fight between
environmentalists and Denver area officials who say the dam is
essential to the region's future water needs.
   Environmentalists have said EPA's decision on the dam will be an
early signal of how the Bush administration intends to deal with
environmental and conservation issues.
   ``This action demonstrates the president is serious about
establishing himself as an environmental president,'' said Peter
Berle, president of the National Audubon Society.
   Environmental concerns centered on the fact that the 615-foot
dam and reservoir would flood a vast area where the South Platte
and its North Fork meet about 25 miles southwest of Denver. It
would put under 500 feet of water a 20-mile area including the
scenic Cheesman Canyon, which has some of the best trout fishing in
the state and is home for a variety of wildlife.
   The project also has been attacked by Nebraska officials who
fear that the dam will reduce the flow of water into the Big Bend
wetland region of western Nebraska, a favorite resting spot for
whooping crane and numerous other birds.
   Reilly said the permit as approved by the Corps of Engineers
could have ``very serious adverse environmental impacts ... and may
not provide adequate safeguards.''
   ``I am not convinced that the (Two Forks) dam project as
proposed will avoid environmental harm to the extent practicable or
that the proposed permit conditions will minimize or compensate for
damage to fisheries, wildlife habitat and recreation areas,''
Reilly said in a statement.
   Environmentalists have been urging Reilly to intervene because
the agency's regional administrator, Jim Scherer, had indicated he
favors the project if certain assurances are included to protect
the environment.
   At a news conference in Denver, Scherer said he was
``disappointed that the decision could not be made at the regional
level.'' Scherer said conditions had been put into the permit
``that satisfied a number of concerns I have had.''
   But Reilly overruled the regional administrator, saying that the
project as proposed does not meet the requirements of the Clean
Water Act and directed Scherer to initiate the veto process for the
existing permit.
   The EPA and Corps of Engineers as well as project applicants
have 15 days to try to work out safeguards that might satisfy
Reilly. If they fail to do so, the process would continue, possibly
over several months, leading to a likely veto of the project,
officials said.

<HEAD>China Says Its Education System Faces Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High school enrollment has fallen more than 25
percent since 1978, when China embarked on ambitious economic
development, and senior leader Deng Xiaoping says there is a crisis
in education.
   Elementary school enrollment has declined more than 14 percent
in the same period.
   Education Minister Li Tieying told a news conference Friday the
government cannot devote enough money to the problems and advocated
an education tax. He implied other funds should be raised through
tuition and schools starting their own businesses to make money.
   Deng was quoted in the People's Daily as saying: ``Our biggest
mistake over the last 10 years is that education has not developed
sufficiently.''
   He said the mistake surpassed errors that have created an
inflation rate of 36 percent, the highest since the Communist Party
gained power in 1949.
   China used to take pride in free education, but has begun
forcing schools to set up factories to pay expenses. Some now
charge tuition to pay for books and other materials.
   Li's news conference coincided with a session of the National
People's Congress, which is studying a proposal to raise the
education budget by 15 percent to $10 billion.
   Last year, China spent $11 a student, among the world's lowest.
   About one-third of all pupils now finish primary school and
fewer than 10 percent of those attend high school or college.
Despite a law requiring nine years of education, the average
Chinese spends five years in school.
   Several problems have combined to create the education crisis.
   Agriculture policies giving land back to the peasants caused
many to put their children to work. Li said 8.5 percent of
elementary pupils and 2.65 percent of high school students left
school last year and 220 million Chinese are illiterate, most of
them in rural areas.
   Educated Chinese are poorly paid. Starting salaries for Chinese
men and women with college diplomas are about $29 a month,
one-tenth of what a hairdresser can earn.
   ``This is not the kind of incentive that makes people want to
get an education,'' Li said.
   Statistics released Friday said 65.4 million youngsters were
attending high school in 1978, but the figure last year was 47.6
million.
   On the bright side, the number of students in college increased
from 856,000 to 2.7 million and the number of colleges doubled to
1,075, according to the statistics.
   An increasing number of graduate students are leaving school,
however, to seek higher wages outside teaching and research.
   The physical plant also has suffered. Li said more than 60
percent of the junior high schools and 90 percent of elementary
schools lacked sufficient facilities and supplies last year.
   Many teachers are not qualified, he said, but was not specific.
Li said teachers are paid less than the average worker in a
state-run factory.
   He said the responsibility rests with the State Council, or
Cabinet, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party.
   Li has led the State Education Commission for one year. Premier
Li Peng was education minister in 1985-88, when the commission was
given responsibility for elementary and secondary schools as well
as higher education.

<HEAD>Panetta Seeks to Halt Work on Three Offshore Oil and Gas Lease Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the
House Budget Committee, said Friday he is seeking legislation to
halt work on three offshore oil and gas lease sales in California.
   Panetta said work on the lease sales should stop until a
presidential task force finishes its analysis of the environmental
impact of outer continental shelf oil and gas leasing, and Congress
and the public have time to review it.
   The lease sales involve the area off the coast of Humboldt and
Mendocino counties, that portion stretching from San Luis Obispo
County to the U.S.-Mexico border and the area covering the central
coast area from Sonoma County to Monterey County.
   Panetta said he will request the legislation April 25 in
testimony before the House interior appropriations subcommittee.
   He said legislation is necessary because Bush administration
officials have said that before-lease steps for lease sales on two
sections of the coast will continue and that the central section is
not be to included in the task force's review.
   ``There is simply no point in continuing work on this sale until
we have more information on the environmental impacts of offshore
drilling in all critical areas of our coast,'' he said.

   A neighbor of former Premier Paul
Vanden Boeynants was charged Friday in the January kidnapping of
the wealthy businessman, who was freed a month later after his
family paid an undisclosed ransom.
   Officials said Michel Vander Elst, 41, is the lawyer of Patrick
Haemers, an escaped convict considered the key suspect in the
kidnapping. Haemers escaped from a prison transport truck in August
1987, and remains at large.
   Vander Elst was taken in for questioning on Thursday. He was
charged Friday with kidnapping, extortion, forgery and conspiracy,
officials said.
   Haemers' father and brother were questioned Friday, officials
said.
   Vander Elst is the second person under arrest. Basri Bajrami was
arrested in Metz, France, last month and is to be extradited to
Belgium.
   On Thursday, police found Vander Elst at his home, which is in
the same Brussels apartment building where Vanden Boeynants lives.
Several men abducted the 69-year-old Christian Democrat from the
building's garage as he parked his car on the evening of Jan. 14.
   Vanden Boeynants was held in a dark room at a house in Le
Touquet, France, and released in Tournai, Belgium, on Feb. 13,
officials say.
   He said he was held by as many as five armed men whose faces he
never saw and with whom he communicated in writing.
   The kidnappers, in rambling notes to Belgian media, claimed
responsibility for the abduction on behalf of a non-existing
left-wing group.
   Vanden Boeynants' family paid an undisclosed ransom through a
Swiss bank. Belgian newspapers have put the amount at up to $1.6
million.
   Vanden Boeynants was prime minister from 1966-68 and again from
1978-79. He also was defense minister for seven years during the
1970s.
   He has long been a controversial politician. In 1988, he
received a three-year suspended sentence for tax fraud and forgery
as head of a Brussels meat-packing company.

   A union representing 3,000 Education
Department workers has filed a court challenge to the department's
plans to begin a random drug-testing program next month.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court here Thursday, is the
latest of more than a half-dozen attempts by the American
Federation of Government Employees to block drug-testing programs
in federal departments and agencies. The cases filed previously are
pending at various levels of the federal court system.
   ``We are confident the courts will not sanction programs that
randomly select government workers and require them to submit to
humiliating urinalysis testing without any history or reasonable
suspicion of drug abuse problems,'' said AFGE President John N.
Sturdivant.
   A union spokeswoman said the Education Department on Feb. 21
distributed to employees a notice that the testing program would
begin on or after April 21. Federal agencies, as part of their
compliance with an executive order issued by then-President Reagan
requiring them to draft drug-testing programs, routinely give
employees 60 days' notice before begining testing.
   Education Department spokesman Jim Bradshaw said the department
had no comment on the union's suit.

   Pressing a 5-foot cross to his forehead, Pope John
Paul II led a torchlit Good Friday procession at the Colosseum to
symbolically relive Jesus' final agonies before his crucifixion.
   Before the hour-long ``Stations of the Cross'' procession began
in the windy night, the pope addressed the crowd of faithful who
followed him.
   ``Jesus is near to those who suffer and fall: to the ailing near
desperation because of a relapse; to the prisoner who, for loyalty
to conscience, languishes in jail and, weakened by persecution,
feels himself vacillating in his certainty,'' the pope said, his
thin silver hair blown by the chilly wind.
   In a comment taken as a reference to drug abuse, the pope said
that Jesus ``supports the slaves of vice who after having abandoned
the habit, fall again; he sustains those who, having been dogged by
tragedies, have doubts about God.''
   Then the pope, flanked by two young men holding long, lit
candles, started the slow walk from the Colosseum to the edge of
the ancient Roman Forum to evoke the tortures Jesus suffered as he
made his way to his appointment with death on Calvary Hill in
Jerusalem.
   John Paul wore a crimson, gold-embroidered robe over a white
cassock. The simple black cross he carried was slender and made of
lightweight wood weighing about one pound.
   Nuns, children, foreign tourists in Rome for the Easter holiday,
and elderly Italian women were among the many in the crowd who held
prayer books and small torches during the ceremony.
   Italian television carried the ceremony live and said it was
being shown to hundreds of millions of people around the world,
although it did not name the countries.
   The procession, known as the Via Crucis (Latin for way of the
cross) was long a papal tradition until a nearly 100-year-long
interruption following the creation of the modern Italian state.
Pope Paul VI in 1964 revived it as a highlight of the Vatican's
observance of Good Friday, the most solemn and sad day in the Roman
Catholic Church's liturgy.
   At times throughout the procession, the pope closed his eyes
tightly as he prayed and reflected, appearing to be feeling the
pain suffered by Jesus.
   ``My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?'' a lecturer read,
reciting the 14 stations of the cross, and the pope seemed
particulary moved by this passage from the New Testament about
Jesus' final moments on the cross.
   The flames of the torches were whipped by blasts of the
tramontana, a cold wind that blows down from the northern Alps over
the Italian peninsula, clearing the sky but making the crowd shiver
and button up their coats and jackets.
   Among the stations are Jesus' encounter with Veronica, who wipes
his sweaty face with her veil, and the three times Jesus stumbles
and falls under the weight of the cross.
   The title of each station was read in seven languages: Italian,
French, English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and, last of all,
Polish, the pope's native tongue.
   The pope spoke in Italian during the ceremony.
   Earlier in the day, the pope heard the confessions of six
Italians and a West German religion teacher in St. Peter's Basilica
in keeping with a Good Friday tradition he began 10 years ago.
   He heard confessions from two Italian military students, a
laborer, a transport worker, a 40-year-old woman and her
12-year-old son, and the Frankfurt religion teacher.
   John Paul began hearing confessions in the basilica on Good
Friday to emphasize the importance of the sacrament.
   No Mass is said on Good Friday, the only day in the church year
without its celebration. Easter will be ushered in on Saturday
night in a candlelit vigil service in St. Peter's Basilica. The
pope also says a midmorning Mass for the public on Sunday.

<TEXT>
   A House chairman urged government officials
Friday to block action on a $92 million loan to a Nevada company
whose rocket-fuel chemical was found in a Dutch Harbor en route to
Iran.
   James Fletcher, chairman of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, agreed to consider freezing action on the loan in a
conversation with a House committee chairman, congressional aides
said.
   Rep. Robert A. Roe, D-N.J., chairman of the House Science, Space
and Technology Committee, urged Fletcher to halt approval of the
deal, according to a committee staff member who asked not to be
identified by name.
   The aide quoted Roe, who was in New Jersey, as saying Fletcher
had told him NASA has found no evidence that the Nevada company,
Pacific Energy Production Co., knew that the chemical it produced
was bound for Iran.
   Roe replied in the telephone conversation with Fletcher that the
committee disagreed, according to the aide. He said the panel would
hold hearings on the controversy following next week's Easter
congressional recess.
   Acting on a tip from the Customs Service, Dutch police seized an
Iranian-flag freighter in the port of Rotterdam last year. It was
carrying ammonium perchlorate, an oxidizer used in solid rocket
fuels such as those powering the space shuttles' solid fuel
boosters, Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles and a host
of tactical weapons.
   Executives of Pacific Energy Production, based in Henderson,
Nev., outside Las Vegas, said they did not know anything about
plans to send the product to Iran. They said they had sold it to an
American subsidiary of a Swiss firm.
   The $92 million loan is being arranged through a bank with
NASA's aid to rebuild a Pacific Energy Production Co. plant that
exploded on May 4, 1988. The company is one of two in the United
States that produce the chemical and NASA has been concerned that
with the supply halved a shortage could develop.
   Roe said that after a meeting Thursday that he showed Fletcher
videotapes of containers at the Henderson site with labels bearing
the name of a German company that reportedly loaded the product
aboard the freighter at Rotterdam.

   West Virginia's state senators were
notified Friday to be prepared to sit as a jury for an expected
impeachment trial against the state treasurer at the end of May.
   ``It would appear likely that the House of Delegates will next
week send us a message containing the articles of impeachment
against state Treasurer A. James Manchin,'' Senate President Larry
Tucker wrote in a memorandum to his 33 colleagues.
   ``I would anticipate a starting date for the impeachment trial
being toward the end of May, and I also anticipate it lasting three
to four weeks,'' Tucker wrote.
   Tucker said he believes two-thirds or more of the 100-member
House will vote to impeach Manchin, 61, a two-term treasurer
tangled in allegations that a fund under his supervision lost $279
million in 1987, and that he failed to perform the proper
supervisory functions over the fund.
   Manchin has distanced himself from the losses. He testified
before the House Judiciary Committee last week that he never
discussed specific investment practices with his staff, didn't
understand investment documents when they crossed his desk, and
didn't learn of the losses until late November or early December
1988.
   The judiciary committee voted 19-6 Wednesday to recommend that
Manchin be impeached for maladministration, incompetence, neglect
of duty and high crimes and misdemeanors for his role in the loss.
   House Judiciary Chairman John Hatcher said his committee on
Monday will take up the formal articles of impeachment _ drafted
along the lines suggested by Wednesday's vote _ and vote on the
final document. The resolution then goes to the House.
   Only a simple majority is needed to recommend impeachment, which
is, in effect, an indictment of the treasurer. That would go to the
Senate, which would sit as a jury. It would take a two-thirds vote
by the Senate _ 23 of 34 members _ to convict.
   If convicted, Manchin would be forced from office and would lose
his pension, estimated at the end of 1988 by the Public Employees
Retirement System to be at least $2,128 a month, the agency's
acting director George Crum said Friday.
   The timetable for when the resolution will be presented to the
House has not been resolved, Hatcher said, but the 60-day
legislative session ends April 8.
   The last time a West Virginia state treasurer was impeached was
1876.
   Manchin's attorney, Frank Cleckley, has hinted, without
elaboration, that he may file a lawsuit challenging the impeachment
proceedings against his client.

   Leftist guerrillas raided two government
copper mines in the Andes, killing five people and blowing up a
barracks and offices, police said Friday.
   Miners have announced plans for a three-day nationwide strike to
begin Monday, but the official gazette El Peruano said Friday it
was illegal.
   Unions want all contracts for Peru's 70,000 miners to be
negotiated jointly rather than with individual companies, as is the
practice now. Two strikes on the same issue failed last year.
   Guerrillas of Shining Path, a Maoist group that began fighting
nine years ago, attacked the Yauricocha and Chumpe mines near La
Oroya, 95 miles east of Lima, on Thursday, police reported.
   They said the worst raid was the first, on Yauricocha, where two
policemen, two watchmen and an office employee were killed.
   Members of the guerrilla band used dynamite to blow up a vacant
barracks used by administration workers and stole drugs and
medicine from the mine clinic, the report said.
   Guards at Chumpe, about five miles away, apparently did not
resist, and the raiders destroyed mine offices with dynamite, the
police said.
   Both mines are are operated by state-owned Centromin, Peru's
largest mining company.
   Shining Path guerrillas have increased attacks on the mining
industry, which produces more than half the nation's export
earnings. More than 14,000 people have been killed since the
insurgency began.

<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic church leaders marked
Good Friday by calling for reconciliation among Nicaraguans and
criticizing both the U.S.-backed rebels and the Sandinista
government.
   At a Good Friday procession attended by an estimated 30,000
people, Monsignor Bismarck Carballo, the church spokesman, told the
crowd: ``This is the year all Nicaraguans hope will bring national
reconciliation.''
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, who led the procession
commemorating Christ's tortured journey to Cavalry, cried out,
``Long live Catholic Nicaragua, long live the pope!'' and people
cheered.
   They cheered again when he shouted, ``One church!'' referring to
the so-called Popular Church of dissident Catholics who support the
left-wing Sandinistas.
   Thursday night during a ceremony recalling Christ's washing the
feet of his disciples, Obando y Bravo said ``it would have been
beautiful'' if the rebel command ``had released all its prisoners
of war so they could reunite with their families.
   ``And it would have been a good thing if the government of
Nicaragua had declared a general amnesty to bring happiness to
prisoners and their families and to contribute to national
reconciliation.''
   Obando y Bravo urged faithful Catholics to take part in politics
to provide ``an example of responsibility and service for the
common good.''
   The cardinal has been a frequent critic of the Sandinistas,
accusing them of trying to impose a leftist government in
predominantly Catholic Nicaragua against the will of the people.
   Some former national guard members, who were among the 1,894
freed last week by the government, joined in the Good Friday
procession, and a few wore their old uniforms.
   Thousands of national guardsmen were imprisoned after the
Sandinistas gained power in 1979, ousting the right-wing regime of
President Anastasio Somoza.
   The government said only 39 ex-guardsmen remain in jail, and
they are ``very dangerous and undisciplined.''
   Last week's ceremonial release of nearly 1,900 guardsmen was
part of the revived Central American peace accord the presidents of
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala signed
in February. It includes plans to disband the Nicaraguan rebel
army, believed to have about 11,000 members.
   Government sources claim the rebels, known as Contras, are
holding at least 1,000 pro-Sandinistas prisoners, including
soldiers and civilians. The Contras acknowledged last year that
they held some prisoners but gave no figures.

   A Contra spokesman lauded the Bush
administration's newly announced humanitarian aid plan Friday as a
``very significant step'' that will keep their fighters alive while
diplomatic peace efforts are pursued.
   The Contras had expected they would get some continued aid, said
Nicaraguan Resistance spokesman Bosco Matamoros.
   The most positive aspect of the $45 million aid plan announced
at the White House was that it represents for the first time '`a
national policy on a bipartisan consensus,'' said Matamoros.
   In addition, he said, ``We have resolved a fundamental problem
which is the integrity of our combatants,'' who are encamped on the
Honduran side of the Nicaraguan border. They have been existing on
$27 million worth of U.S. non-lethal aid which runs out March 31.
   Contra leader Adolfo Calero, perhaps the most well known
resistance figure in the United States because of his longtime U.S.
travels for his cause, was in Guatemala and could not be reached
Friday by phone, said a man who answered the phone at his Miami
home.
   Another top Contra leader, Alfredo Cesar, was in Miami but could
not be reached for comment at his home there.
   During the Reagan administration, the Contras were taken care of
through a covert White House plan even when Congress halted
military aid, but dissension on Capitol Hill and within the
administration weakened their cause, Contra leaders have said.
   ``It's a very significant step taken by the United States,''
Matamoros said. ``The United States now enters with the Central
American countries and other Latin American countries in this
concert which enhances the possibility ... of arriving to a process
of democratization in Nicaragua.''
   As to the plan's provision of money for voluntary repatriation
on the part of the 11,000-member Contra army, Matamoros said,
``It's very clear that if there is democracy we are willing return
to our country.''
   But he said most of the rebels will likely wait to see how
Nicaragua's ruling Sandinista government lives up to its pledge for
democratic reforms and free elections early next year.
   The Contras also want to participate in a reconciliation
dialogue with the Sandinistas and the internal political
opposition, Matamoros said. Previous efforts were fruitless.

   A government commission has found that thousands
of skulls and bones buried in a mass grave outside Kiev were those
of victims killed during Stalin's repressions, not by Nazi
soldiers, Tass reported Friday.
   The conclusion supports the testimony of elderly witnesses in
the nearby village of Bykovnia who said they saw trucks that
dripped blood rumbling to Darnitsa Forest in the 1930s, before the
Nazis occupied the area.
   Earlier government estimates said the site contains from 6,000
to 68,000 bodies, but unofficial estimates said bodies of up to
300,000 people were stacked in the grave.
   The villagers broke five decades of terrified silence to accuse
Josef Stalin's secret police after the Ukrainian government erected
a monument in May 1988 blaming Nazi occupiers for the crime. The
villagers forced Ukrainian authorities in December to establish the
commission, saying three previous investigations had covered up the
truth by blaming Nazi troops.
   The report from Tass, the official Soviet news agency, did not
mention the earlier investigations.
   Viktor Kulik, head of the investigating commission, told Tass
that investigators found family names engraved on some objects in
the grave.
   ``Examination of the archives later confirmed that the victims
were `people's enemies' charged in the 1930s with
counterrevolutionary and nationalist activity, espionage and
conspiracy,'' Tass said.
   ``Official confirmation has been given to the version that in
the Darnitsa Forest near the village of Bykovnia outside the
Ukrainian capital of Kiev are buried victims of the repressions of
the 1930s,'' Tass said.
   Western historians estimate 20 million Soviets were killed under
Stalin, particularly during the Great Purge of the late 1930s, but
Soviet officials ignored the dark side of Stalin for most of the
past 50 years.
   The examination of Stalin's crimes begun briefly under Nikita S.
Khrushchev was revived in 1987 under President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policy of glasnost.
   Western historians also blame the Soviets for the massacre of
4,250 Polish officers unearthed in 1943 in a mass grave 310 miles
away in the Katyn Forest. Earlier this year, Polish authorities
said Stalin's forces killed the officials, although official Soviet
commissions have blamed the Nazis.
   A joint Polish-Soviet commission is examining Katyn and other
``blank spots'' in Soviet history.
   Earlier commissions on Bykovnia had blamed the Nazis for the
killings even though villagers insisted the bodies were already
there when the Germans occupied Kiev in September 1941.
   Several of the villagers told The Associated Press they
personally dug up the graves on orders of the Germans, one of them
just days after the Germans arrived.
   One man, Mikola Lysenko, discovered the bones and skulls in 1987
after grave robbers had uncovered them, and set out on a personal
crusade to uncover the truth.
   He located witnesses in Bykovnia and won support from the
Ukrainian Writers' Union and the newly formed Memorial society,
which is dedicated to baring the truth of Stalin's crimes.
   Lysenko was unavailable for comment Friday as he does not have a
telephone.
   Another resident, Petro Z. Kukovenko, said he summoned the
courage to speak after a Soviet commission reburied the bones and
erected the memorial blaming the Nazis. In an interview last month,
Kukovenko said a German officer forced him and four other men to
exhume the site four days after Nazi troops occupied the area in
1941.
   ``When they (the Soviets) put up this monument, I became ashamed
that they were blaming this on the wrong people,'' said Kukovenko,
74.

   Sikh militants in the northwestern state
of Punjab raided the house of a Sikh woman and killed her and six
members of her family, Press Trust of India said Friday.
   At least seven others were killed in other militant-related
violence in Punjab, said United News of India, another news agency.
   More than 455 people have been killed in such violence so far
this year, officials say.
   According to Press Trust, militants raided the house of Dhan
Kaur in Katran village near Amritsar, about 280 miles northwest of
New Delhi. The militants fired guns and killed Kaur, two of her
sons, three daughters and a daughter-in-law, the news agency said.
   It said police blamed members of the radical ``Bhindranwale
Tigers Force'' for the slayings. The group is one of about a dozen
underground militias based in Punjab fighting for a separate Sikh
state.
   Sikhs make up 2 percent of India's population but hold a slight
majority in Punjab, a prosperous farming state.
   Militants have killed thousands of Hindus and moderate Sikhs in
their insurgency for an independent Sikh nation since 1982. They
say they are discriminated against by the country's Hindu majority,
which makes up 82 percent of the population.
   The federal government, in an effort to curb the violence,
dissolved the state government in May 1987 and put Punjab under
federal rule.
   But authorities say Sikh militants killed at least 2,400 last
year, more than double the number killed in 1987.

   The leftist Sandinista government on
Friday condemned the bipartisan plan President Bush announced in
Washington to renew humanitarian aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Alejandro Bendana called the
plan drafted by the Bush administration and congressional leaders
``confusing and unclear'' and said it goes against a regional pact
that calls for dismantling the rebel force by mid-May.
   ``Humanitarian aid to a standing military force is a
contradiction in terms,'' Bendana said at a news conference, where
journalists had been told President Daniel Ortega was to speak.
Ortega's absence was not explained.
   Bendana and Manuel Espinoza, presidential information minister,
read a communique from the Nicaraguan government which said in part
that the U.S. government drafted the plan ``in order to save face
while it proceeds to dismantle its failed policy against
Nicaragua's sovereignty and integrity.''
   Answering journalists' questions later, Bendana said of the plan:
   ``We want to believe this is indeed a positive step, because
there are other steps ahead'' where the United States can show its
support of the peace accord that Ortega and the presidents of El
Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica reached in El Salvador
on Feb. 14.
   In the El Salvador accord the five presidents agreed to draft a
program by mid-May to dismantle the Contras, as the Nicaraguan
rebel force is known, and help them return to civilian life.
   Ortega also agreed to electoral and other reforms to guarantee
fair general elections, which he moved up by 10 months to Feb. 25,
1990.
   In speaking of ``other steps ahead,'' Bendana said he was
referring to support needed from the United States to have a U.N.
peacekeeping force sent to Central America and independent
observers to the Nicaraguan elections, both part of the El Salvador
pact.
   The United States, as one of the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council, can veto the measure.
   Bendana called the vote ``an acid test'' of U.S. intentions
toward Nicaragua.
   Congress voted in February 1988 to cut off military aid to the
Contras, which the United States began arming in 1981, and continue
only food, shelter, medical and other non-lethal assistance.
   The bipartisan agreement announced in Washington on Friday calls
for $45 million in new aid through February 1990 for the estimated
11,000 Contras living in Honduran jungle camps near the Nicaraguan
border with an equal number of relatives.
   The expressed intent of the aid renewal is to put pressure on
the Sandinistas to comply with the El Salvador pact. The current
$27.1 million aid package to the rebels runs out March 31.
   The new aid is expected to be approved by Congress soon after it
returns from its Easter break next month.
   ``There is an inconsistency in these two documents (the El
Salvador pact and the U.S. bilateral Contra aid plan),'' Bendana
said. ``Either you approve the dismantling of the Contras or you
don't.''
   He said that regardless of the U.S. Contra aid plan, the Central
American presidents will meet their mid-May deadline for the Contra
dismantling plan.
   Since the El Salvador accord, the Nicaraguan government has
released nearly 1,900 former members of the National Guard, most of
whom were jailed after a revolution that brought the Sandinistas to
power July 19, 1979.
   Nicaragua also sent to the National Assembly a list of reforms
on electoral and other laws, as part of the El Salvador accord.
Passage of the reforms is virtually assured because the
Sandinistas, with 61 deputies, control the unicameral 96-member
assembly.
   The Sandinistas and the Contras signed a temporary cease-fire in
March 1988 which has been broken by sporadic skirmishes. he plan
Bush announced Friday stipulates that aid can be suspended if the
Contras attack Nicaragua or if the presence of the Contras is
deemed detrimental to the Central American peace process.

   Hundreds of Christian pilgrims wept, prayed and
sang hymns along the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem's Old City in a Good
Friday procession that retraced Christ's path to his crucifixion.
   About a dozen devotees carried heavy wooden crosses to symbolize
Christ's walk of agony, and many knelt for communal prayers at the
14 stations that mark the route.
   A costumed American group, complete with a thorn-crowned Christ
figure, performed along the way. A minor scuffle broke out when
Roman Catholic and Protestant groups crossed paths, each demanding
right of way.
   The turnout was considerably lower than in past years,
reflecting fears over the 15-month Palstinian revolt that has torn
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and spilled into Arab
east Jerusalem. No major violence was reported.
   In the Philippines, at least 11 people were nailed to crosses
and thousands of Filipinos drew blood by beating themselves on the
back to symbolize the suffering of Christ. About 5,000 people
attended in ritual in San Pedro Citud, 40 miles north of Manila.
   Pope John Paul II heard confessions from worshipers in the
Vatican's St. Peter's Basilica before carrying a 5-foot wooden
cross in a Good Friday procession to symbolically relive Jesus'
final agonies before his crucifixion.
   Before the hour-long procession, the pope told the crowd:
``Jesus is near to those who suffer and fall.''
   In a comment taken as a reference to drug abuse, he said Jesus
``supports the slaves of vice who after having abandoned the habit,
fall again; he sustains those who, having been dogged by tragedies,
have doubts about God.''
   In Jerusalem, scores of city police and paramilitary border
forces armed with automatic rifles, tear gas grenades and riot
batons were moved into the Old City to ensure security for
worshipers.
   The Old City contains sites holy to Judaism, Christianity and
Islam, and is part of territory seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   The procession swept through the Via Dolorosa, or Street of
Sorrows, to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where tradition holds
Christ was buried after dying at the hands of the Roman rulers of
the Holy Land.
   The main procession was led by 20 Roman Catholic Franciscan
monks. About 600 worshipers followed, a fraction of the crowd that
traditionally participates.
   A scuffle broke out when the procession crossed the path of a
Protestant group moving in another direction. Police stepped in to
stop fistfights, then quickly set up a barricade.
   A guitarist accompanied Spanish devotees, whose songs echoed in
the narrow alleys. Palestinian Arabs sang hymns in Arabic, a
contrast to the Islamic call to prayer that rang out from the Old
City's mosques.
   ``You just feel you are part of a tremendous movement, this
Christian religion, no matter what denomination it might be,'' said
John Eberlein of Manassas, Va., who came with 10 other Roman
Catholics. ``To see all colors here, all believing the same thing
you believe, it's just very exhilerating, spiritually moving.''
   A California group provided the street theater. Ralph Beltran of
Los Angeles portrayed Christ, his head crowned with thorns. His
companions, dressed as Roman guards, pretended to flog him as he
dragged a wooden cross through the streets.
   Joanne Petranela of Brea, Calif., costumed as Mary Magdalene,
ran among astonished onlookers shouting, ``It's all my fault.''
   A German pilgrim from Munich, who identified himself only as
Helmut, termed the show ``a disgrace to Christianity.''
   Even though this year's turnout was smaller, the crowds still
proved too much for Gillian Prentice of Melbourne, Australia.
   ``It is difficult to move around easily, and it would be nicer
if it was a little quieter,'' she said. ``You need peace and quiet
to pray. I may come back tomorrow.''

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
will meet with Prime Minister Charles Haughey during an April 2
stopover at an Irish airport on his trip to Cuba, the Irish leader
said Friday.
   Their first-ever meeting, made at Gorbachev's request, is
expected to last several hours at a site near Shannon International
Airport in western Ireland, Haughey said.
   They plan to discuss international and bilateral issues
including the development of the ``excellent relationship between
Ireland and the Soviet Union,'' Haughey said.
   It will be the first official visit to Ireland by a Soviet
leader, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs.
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, will visit Britain from April
5-7. Gorbachev had been scheduled to visit Britain in December
after his visit to the United States, but postponed the trip to
rush to earthquake-devastated Soviet Armenia.
   British officials say Gorbachev and Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher will spend much of the time in talks dominated by
East-West relations, human rights and disarmament.
   Ireland and the Soviet Union exchanged ambassadors for the first
time in 1974.
   The overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country won partial
independence from Britain in 1921, and the Soviet Union was the
first country to recognize its republican government.
   The republicans negotiated with Soviet diplomats, but failed to
get an agreement on establishing diplomatic links.
   In September 1983, Ireland barred the Soviet state airline,
Aeroflot, from picking up or discharging passengers at Shannon for
60 days to protest the shooting down of a South Korean airliner
over Soviet airspace.

   Dusan Skala, an independent
publisher and political activist, was given a suspended sentence of
15 months after a one-day trial Friday, a leading dissident
reported.
   Anna Sabatova of the Charter 77 human rights organization said
the trial was held in a town near Brno, 125 miles east of Prague,
and Skala was convicted of incitement in connection with a banned
rally last October.
   Communist authorities began a crackdown on dissidents following
anti-government protests in August, October and January.
   Earlier this week an appeals court in Prague gave playwright
Vaclav Havel an eight-month sentence.
   Seven other activists were jailed, fined or given suspended
sentences last month.

   Acting Air Force Secretary James F. McGovern
announced late Friday he will step down later this spring to seek a
job in the private sector.
   McGovern has served as the under secretary, or No. 2, man, in
the Air Force's heirarchy since November 1986 and as the acting
secretary since last December.
   An associate of former Sen. John Tower, McGovern had been widely
expected to take on the Air Force post on a permanent basis had
Tower been confirmed as the secretary of defense.
   Tower's nomination was rejected two weeks ago by the Senate and
President Bush replaced him with former Wyoming congressman Dick
Cheney.
   ``In a meeting I had with Defense Secretary Cheney earlier this
week, I indicated that I was inclined to return to the private
sector so that I could finally give my two daughters the attention
they deserve and to pursue several other professional interests,''
McGovern said in a prepared statement.
   ``Without making any commitments, Secretary Cheney asked that we
both keep our options open. However, today I indicated to Secretary
Cheney my preference for leaving public service ...''
   An aide said McGovern is planning to leave in May.
   McGovern's announcement comes one day after administration
sources disclosed Navy Secretary William L. Ball is also unlikely
to keep his post in a new Cheney line-up.
   Ball, another associate of Tower, has said nothing about leaving
his job. But the sources said Thursday that Assistant Defense
Secretary Richard L. Armitage had been told by Cheney he was being
considered for the job of Navy secretary, among others.
   The secretary of the Army, John O. Marsh, long ago made it clear
he planned to retire as soon as the Bush administration selected a
successor and was not interested in remaining.
   McGovern's announcement Friday came as Cheney, during his first
press conference, publicly rebuked the Air Force's top general for
consulting privately with congressional leaders on how to modernize
the nuclear arsenal.
   The aide to McGovern, who asked not to be named, insisted that
controversy involving Gen. Larry D. Welch had played no role in
McGovern's decision.
   ``All this happened earlier in the week and there's no tie-in,''
said the aide. ``He's been thinking about it for a long time.''
   McGovern, a native of Dayton, Ohio, is a graduate of the U.S.

   Authorities have arrested a prominent
student leader and will act against political parties involved in
any anti-government demonstrations, the government said Friday.
   The arrest Thursday of Min Ko Naing was the first of a well
known student activist since military commander Gen. Saw Maung
seized power in a coup in September.
   Government spokesman Kyaw Sann said that from March 15-21, Min
Ko Naing made seven anti-government speeches at offices of the
National League For Democracy, a major political party headed by
dissident leaders Tin Oo and Aung San Suu Kyi.
   The student also violated the ban on public gatherings, Kyaw
Sann said.
   ``Min Ko Naing and his groups have repeatedly violated the law,
inciting the people to disrupt the peace and tranquility in the
country,'' he said at a news conference. ``They were also planning
to disrupt the forthcoming Armed Forces Day celebrations on March
27.''
   ``Action will also be taken against political parties involved
in these anti-government activities,'' Kyaw Sann said.
   Students took a leading role in street demonstrations last year
aimed at ending a quarter century of authoritarian rule in Burma.
   Saw Maung's troops killed hundreds of people in suppressing
dissent. He later allowed the formation of alternative political
parties and promised a general election in 1990.
   Min Ko Naing was a leader of the student group most prominently
involved in the campaign for democracy, the All Burma Student
Federation.
   Most members of the federation went underground or fled to areas
along the Thailand border after the coup. Min Ko Naing and two
other leaders resurfaced in Rangoon late in the year.

<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. has
advised its employees against flying U.S. carriers on some routes
until the end of next month because of the government warning about
a possible hijacking in Europe.
   ``On the basis of the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration)
alert, IBM notified its employees to avoid traveling on U.S. air
carriers from Europe and the Middle East until the end of April,''
IBM spokeswoman Colette Abissi said Friday.
   She said the notification was issued Thursday through the
company's internal security channels. IBM employs 163,904 people
outside the United States.
   It is strictly up to employees to decide what travel
arrangements to make, she said.
   The FAA confirmed Thursday it had issued a security bulletin to
airports and carriers March 16 about ``the possibility of a
hijacking of a U.S. airliner in Western Europe.''
   The warning did not mention any specific airline or airport that
might be threatened, nor did it cite any time for the warning, the
FAA said.
   The White House has sought to calm anxiety about the bulletin,
which leaked in a front-page newspaper story in London.
   Bush administration officials said the bulletin was similar to
many other terrorist alerts and travelers ``should be confident
that all reasonable precautions are being taken.''
   Security also was strengthened this week at Los Angeles
International Airport because of the warning, although it specified
Europe, airport officials said.
   ``We have the ability to react to any type of situation,'' said
airport manager Stephen Yee.
   Meanwhile, a spot check of travel agents did not find that
travelers were reacting by altering their reservations.
   H. Wayne Berens, president of Revere Travel Inc. in Trenton,
N.J., said he was unaware of any customers seeking to change their
travel plans.
   Herbert Teison, editor and publisher of two travel newsletters
including Travel Smart for Business, said ``My feeling is that the
majority of people will not pay attention to it'' if they already
are booked on a U.S. airline.
   ``If reservations are already made, they will let them sit,''
said Teison. ``But in making reservations they will lean toward
making them on a foreign carrier.''

<HEAD>Easter Travelers Fly Despite Warning; No Severe Delays</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European airport officials indicated severe delays
were averted Friday because travelers, aware of reports that a
hijacking might be attempted, checked in early and faced extra
luggage searches calmly.
   The Federal Aviation Administration warned U.S. airlines of a
possible hijack by Palestinian terrorists in Europe this weekend. A
London newspaper disclosed the warning Thursday, angering the
American government, which feared its sources might be compromised.
   International Business Machines Corp., which employs 163,904
people outside the United States, advised them not to fly U.S.
airlines on European and Middle Eastern routes until the end of
April.
   Police at Leonardo da Vinci Airport in Rome said the FAA warning
prompted increased security and that more staff members were
checking bags and working in the metal-detecting section.
   No takeoff delays were reported, and reservations agents at U.S.
airline counters said the number of cancellations was not unusual.
   Security experts in Italy also were wary because of the
approaching anniversary of the U.S. bombing of Libya on April 15,
1986.
   On April 14 last year, a bomb exploded a USO in Naples, killing
an American woman and four other people. The Japanese Red Army was
blamed.
   ANSA, the Italian news agency, quoted Libyan Ambassador
Abdulrahman Shalgam as telling reporters Friday that allegations of
Libyan involvement in attacks allegedly planned were an
``absurdity.''
   At London's Heathrow airport, passengers found themselves in
long lines as bags were carefully searched and their owners
questioned.
   Some passengers traveling on American lines faced double checks,
by the airport staff and the airlines. Airlines tightened security
after the bombing Dec. 21 of Pan Am Flight 103, in which 270 people
were killed.
   Most travelers appeared to have arrived early, as suggested, and
delays generally were limited to a little more than an hour.
   ``I think most people have been well informed and are taking
advice about arriving early and not carrying electrical
equipment,'' said Bob Hearn, manager of customer services at
British Airways Terminal 4.
   Investigators say the Flight 103 bomb was in a radio-cassette
player. British airports now insist that small electronic and
electrical goods be inspected and carried in hand baggage.
   At Gatwick, the other London airport, officials reported delays
up to four hours but said most flights took off on time.
   One traveler said on British Broadcasting Corp television: ``We
just keep our fingers crossed. That's all you can do.''
   The situation was complicated by a 90-minute fault in an air
traffic control computer in the morning, which delayed flights at
airports in central England.
   In Frankfurt, West Germany, an airport spokeswoman said
increased security was in effect and some flights were held up, but
the delays were not ``of a substantial nature.''
   Athens airport officials said security always is tight, and a
spokeswoman said: ``we had normal delays which had nothing to do
with extra security.''
   A Lisbon airport official said security checks were slightly
more rigorous than normal, particularly on U.S. airlines, but
flights were not delayed.
   Airport authorities in Amsterdam said security measures had been
``quietly beefed up,'' but caused no delays or cancellations.
   French police in charge of air transport reported nothing
unusual at the Paris airports.
   In Spain, security officials said the warning had not affected
standing rules, which require teams of armed paramilitary Civil
Guards and police to be on duty at all times at major airports.
   Control tower spokesmen at Madrid's Barajas airport and El Prat
in Barcelona reported no delays Friday in international arrivals.

<HEAD>Black GOP Group Says Won't Attend Meeting if Farrakhan Takes Part</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black Republican group is refusing to attend
next month's ``African-American Summit'' led by a group of
prominent blacks because of the possible participation of Nation of
Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
   In a letter Friday to former presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson, Fred Brown, chairman of the National Black Republican
Council, said he and the 150 members of his group would not take
part because the philosophies of Farrakhan and black militants
Angela Davis and Stokely Carmichael ``are offensive to us.''
   Brown's organization is an arm of the Republican National
Committee.
   Jackson is an honorary chairman of the African-American Summit
which is scheduled for April 21-23 in New Orleans. Other honorary
chairmen include Coretta Scott King, NAACP head Benjamin Hooks,
National Urban League president John Jacob, Dorothy Height of the
National Council of Negro Women and Joseph Lowery of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference.
   Richard Hatcher, former mayor of Gary, Ind., is the general
chairman of the bi-partisan summit which has the stated purpose of
developing an ``African-American agenda'' for the next four years.
   The coordinator of the summit, Kay Hixson, confirmed that
Farrakhan had been asked to participate as a panelist on black
families, but said she did not know about any participation by
Davis or Carmichael. She said the summit organizers have not
received a response from Farrakhan.
   A spokesman for Jackson said he was on the board of the summit
but was not involved in organizing it or inviting people.
   ``He has nothing to do with the planning of it,'' said spokesman
Eric Easter, who added however that the idea for the summit was
raised at a black leadership meeting Jackson held in Chicago in
December.
   Fred Brown in the leter to Jackson, with a copy to Hatcher, said
that the GOP group ``cannot serve on, nor participate in, the
African-American summit as long as these individuals are associated
with the cause.''
   Brown's letter says that Jackson on Jan. 27 informed the summit
steering committee that he also ``could not be associated with this
undertaking if these same individuals were allowed to be official
summit speakers.''
   The committee voted to exclude Farrakhan and tabled the issue of
Davis and Carmichael, the letter said.
   Subsequently, according to Brown's letter, ``some individuals
have fought diligently to have them included in the summit.''
   ``I feel that the move to revisit the question of participation
of these three individuals has been a breach of faith - not on your
part, but on the part of others,'' Brown wrote Jackson.
   Jackson's relationship with Farrakhan became an issue in his
1984 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, because
Farrakhan referred to Judaism as a ``dirty religion.'' Jackson
dissociated himself from Farrakhan's remarks but did not rebuke
him. Farrakhan played no role in Jackson's 1988 campaign.
   Hixson said Farrakhan was selected as a panelist ``because he
does play a prominent role'' in black family issues.
   Angela Davis, a Communist Party black radical, and Stokely
Carmichael, former head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee, were leaders in the militant black power movement on the
1960s.
   Republican National Committee Communications Director Mark
Goodin said RNC officials were unfamiliar with the summit or the
controversy, and had no comment on Brown's action except to say
that ``from all we've heard, his reasoning is sound.''

<HEAD>Pakistani In Hiding For Plans To Translate Rushdie's Book</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Pakistani living in Sweden said
Friday he has gone into hiding after receiving death threats for
planning to translate Salman Rushdie's book ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Police speculated that a Malaysian slain in Stockholm early
Wednesday was mistaken for the Pakistani poet, Yousaf Jhelumi. The
Malaysian was knifed from behind for no apparent reason close to
Jhelumi's apartment in a northern Stockholm suburb.
   Jhelumi, 36, a Moslem, told Swedish television he received death
threats after announcing plans last month to translate ``The
Satanic Verses'' into his mother tongue, Urdu.
   Urdu is the chief language of Pakistan, where the book has been
banned and violently denounced.
   Jhelumi closed his small shop after receiving the threats and
has since moved from hotel to hotel, he said.
   ``I want to make it clear to Moslems in Pakistan and India that
nothing in the book goes against Islam,'' Jhelumi said. He was
interviewed in a hotel room at an unidentified location.
   He said he would only start translating the book if he got
police protection.
   Rushdie's book has been banned in many Moslem countries and the
Indian-born British author has been condemned to death by Iranian
leaders, who say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam.
   The book includes a brothel scene in which the prostitutes take
the names of Mohammed's wives, and it suggests Mohammed wrote the
holy Koran instead of receiving it from Allah.
   Jhelumi said he considered the book an attack ``against the
conservative mullahs who wanted to see the world as old-fashioned
as it was during the time of Mohammed.''
   ``The fanatics can wring my neck, but they can't wring
history,'' he said.
   Jhelumi said he has been denounced in Pakistan and his relatives
there have been threatened with being socially ostracized.

   Packages of radioactive oregano were

the Italian news agency ANSA reported Friday.
   It said the oregano, imported by the Ducros Freres firm, was
confiscated after tests by the health institute in Catania
determined it had radiation levels higher than limits set by the
European Economic Community.
   ANSA said the Italian Ministry of Health is analyzing samples of
imported thyme and dried mushrooms for radiation levels.
   The Agency, in its report late Friday, did not say in what
country or countries the spices and mushrooms were grown or give a
possible reason for the radiation. Health officials could not be
reached immediately for comment.
   ANSA also said the Health Ministry in Rome ordered the Catania
tests but did not say what prompted the order.

   Rain fell over much of the northern half of the East Coast on
Friday, with freezing rain and snow in some inland spots, and light
rain fell over much of the West Coast.
   The low pressure system that dropped heavy rain along the
central Gulf Coast earlier in the week slid up the East Coast and
during the afternoon rain was widespread from Maryland and eastern
Virginia to New York state and central New England.
   The heaviest rain in the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST was 0.98 of
an inch at Fort Eustis, Va., the National Weather Service reported.
   The clouds and rain kept temperatures in the 30s and 40s from
New England to Virginia, with readings in the 50s over the
Carolinas and Georgia.
   In upstate New York, freezing rain was reported in the
Susquehanna and Catskill regions and Binghamton reported freezing
rain throughout most of the day.
   Snow and sleet were scattered over parts of western New England
and eastern New York, but temperatures were mostly above freezing.
Two to 4 inches of snow was forecast for the mountains of Maine and
New Hampshire.
   Gusty northeasterly wind blew across sections of the New Jersey
coast during the afternoon and gusts to 45 mph were reported around
New York City. Gale warnings were posted for the New Jersey coast
and Long Island Sound.
   A moist Pacific weather system spread rain throughout much of
the West Coast states, but most rainfall amounts were less than a
quarter inch. Snow was reported above 7,000 feet in the Sierra
Nevada range, with accumulation of 6 to 12 inches possible around
the Lake Tahoe area.
   In the middle of the nation, a few rain and snow showers spread
over the Dakotas and Minnesota.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 28
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 84 at Fort Myers, Fla. Friday's low
in the Lower 48 states was 2 degrees below zero at Houlton, Maine.
   For Saturday, showers were forecast in the early part of the day
over New England, New York state and western Pennsylvania. Widely
scattered showers were forecast over southern Texas, and across the
northern Plains and northern Rockies. Widespread rain was forecast
over the West Coast states, and northern and central sections of
the Intermountain region betwwen the Sierra Nevada and the Rockies.
   Highs in the 40s and 50s were predicted from the Pacific
Northwest across the northern Rockies, the northern Plains, the
upper Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes to New England; in the
80s over Florida, Louisiana, Texas and southern Arizona; and in the
60s and 70s elsewhere.

<TEXT>
   A judge set a $100,000 bond Friday for
Timothy Jacobs, one of two Indian activists acquitted of federal
charges and later charged by the state for holding up to 20
hostages at a newspaper last year.
   Jacobs, 20, was returned from Madison County, N.Y., Thursday
night to face 14 second-degree kidnapping charges. He dropped his
fight against extradition Wednesday after a New York appeals court
refused to block the order sending him home.
   Superior Court Judge Anthony Brannon set bond for Jacobs and
appointed him a lawyer during a hearing at the courthouse barely a
block from The Robesonian newspaper, where Jacobs and Eddie Hatcher
held hostages for 10 hours on Feb. 1, 1988.
   Both were found innocent of federal hostage-taking and firearms
violations after a three-week trial in Raleigh last October. But
they were indicted by a Robeson County grand jury last December on
state kidnapping charges.
   Jacobs fled soon afterward to the Onondaga Indian reservation
south of Syracuse, N.Y., but was captured Dec. 13 after a
high-speed chase. Hatcher was arrested in North Carolina, but fled
the state after the National Council of Churches posted a $25,000
bond for him. He first went to New York, then to an Indian
reservation in Idaho.
   Hatcher tried earlier this month to seek political asylum at the
Soviet consulate in San Francisco. But the Soviets rejected his
plea and turned him out of their building, allowing federal agents
to arrest him. He is being held in a jail in Oakland, Calif.
   Jacobs' family said they would find the money to get him
released.
   ``The money is no problem,'' said Eleanor Jacobs, Timothy's
mother. ``Timmy was hoping to be home for Easter. But with the
holiday today and the short amount of notice we had, we just didn't
have everything ready.''
   A bond can be secured with cash or a deed to property. Jacobs'
parents own their own home in Robeson County.
   The two Tuscarora Indians said they took over the newspaper to
draw attention to their charges of official corruption and
drug-dealing by Robeson County officials. A state task force formed
as a result of the takeover found no evidence to support those
allegations.
   Jacobs said before his court appearance he would plead guilty to
one of the kidnapping counts, provided he received probation with
no prison sentence. He said he would not testify against Hatcher,
31.
   District Attorney Richard Townsend, who made no comments
opposing bond for Jacobs, said he would not accept that kind of
plea bargain.
   ``I don't think we're interested in that at this point,''
Townsend said. ``We feel all of the charges need to be disposed of.
It might be something we would discuss at a later time, but not
now.''
   Townsend said he hoped to try Jacobs and Hatcher at the same
time.
   A decision is expected Monday whether to return Hatcher to North
Carolina to face a federal charge of unlawful flight to avoid
prosecution or to drop the federal charge and begin extradition
proceedings on the state charges in California.
   Hatcher said this week that Jacobs was abandoning ``the cause''
by dropping his extradition battle in New York. Mrs. Jacobs said
Friday she had hoped her son would continue that fight, but she
understood why he dropped it.
   ``He said he just got tired of fighting and wanted to get it
over with,'' she said. ``I can understand that.''

   Dick Cheney, who found winning congressional
confirmation as defense secretary easy, had less luck finding his
car.
   He told reporters on Friday how, in his first day on the job
last Saturday, he had set out from his office to get his car.
   What he got was lost _ in the basement of the world's largest
office building.
   Asked how he was finding the Pentagon building, which covers 29
acres, Cheney recounted:
   ``On Saturday, I guess it was, I was scheduled for a meeting
with the president ... over in the residence at the White House.
   ``I went out and got on the elevator in the secretary's suite
and went down to get in the car. And, when I went down in the
elevator, the doors opened and I stepped out the doors, the doors
closed behind me and there was no car there.
   ``I was in the basement of the Pentagon. It was a bit
disconcerting because I turned around to look for a button to push
to get the elevator.
   ``The fact is, of course, they don't want strangers wandering
into the secretary's suite by being able to punch in in the
basement. So I was lost in the basement of the Pentagon. I wandered
around for a few minutes, worried that I was going to miss the
meeting with the president.
   ``I finally found the stairs up to the River Entrance, and the
car was parked outside at that time at the River Entrance.
   ``Of course, people were running around out there wondering what
happened to the secretary. But I sort of tightened my tie and
walked out like I knew exactly where I was and arrived outside, and
nobody had the nerve to ask me where the hell I'd been all that
time.''
   ``Have you got a new chauffeur?'' a reporter asked.
   ``The chauffeur's all right,'' Cheney replied. ``I'm worried
about the guy who runs the elevator.''

<HEAD>Principal Makes Fifth-Grader's AIDS Project A No-Show At Science
Fair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAVELAND, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fifth-grader's science fair project on
AIDS won her an ``A'' but was sequestered in the principal's office
when school officials feared exposing students to a discussion
about the deadly disease.
   James Baldree, principal at Waveland Elementary School, kept
Angela Eades' project from appearing at the school's science fair
and a regional competition earlier this week.
   He also refused to allow anyone to look at it, including
teachers and parents.
   ``Students are required to verbally `defend' their projects for
the judges, and we felt it would be a severe imposition to expect
judges to have to question a 10-year-old girl about such a
project,'' he said.
   Angela's project, a pegboard with AIDS spelled in red letters
across it and pasted with magazine articles, earned her a blue
ribbon and an ``A'' grade, but Baldree said two teachers decided
the project did not meet science fair rules.
   The rules disallow projects on vertebrate animals and on
physical matters relating to humans. But there was also worry about
the display's sensitive subject matter, he said.
   ``Other fair participants usually listen in when the judges ask
questions _ students all the way down to kindergarten _ and we
didn't think it would be right to expose children of those young
ages to that kind of discussion.''
   Baldree described the project as sexually explicit. The articles
included information on how acquired immune deficiency syndrome is
most often spread _ through sexual contact, needles or syringes
shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from
pregnant women to their offspring.
   Angela said she had planned a project on the human heart. ``I
was looking through some books and found a lot of information on
AIDS. It's a disease anybody can get, so I decided that would be a
better project,'' she said.
   Teona Eades, Angela's mother, said she wasn't aware the project
did not meet the rules until a coordinator told her it was
unacceptable.
   ``We have no problem with (the school officials') actions; they
had to follow the rules,'' Mrs. Eades said. ``But if those rules
are going to shield our children from reality, that's not very
scientific.''
   Angela said she thought fourth- and fifth-graders should have
been able to see the project because ``we are already talking about
AIDS.'' She said her project could have helped educate other
students about the disease.

   The Food and Drug Administration on Friday
cleared the way for more Chilean fruit _ apples, peaches and plums
_ to be sold to U.S. markets after they are inspected for evidence
of cyanide poisoning.
   Import restrictions were lifted on pears and nectarines from
Chile on Tuesday, and on grapes and berries last Friday, allowing
the fruit to be released for sale after 5 percent of each shipment
is inspected and found free from cyanide.
   Grapes, which constitute 70 percent of the fruit Chile sends to
the United States, began appearing on produce shelves of U.S.
stores this week after a two-week absence due to the
cyanide-poisoning scare.
   More than 1 million cases of grapes and various types of berries
have been inspected at U.S. docks and airports and sent to
retailers since the hold on those fruits was lifted, the FDA said.
   Food graders should begin inspecting Chilean apples, peaches and
plums by the weekend, an FDA spokesman said.
   ``The public should be reassured that the government has kept
everyone informed and has moved promptly both to protect the public
health and to restore to the marketplace a healthy component of the
balanced diet that we recommend,'' said FDA Commissioner Frank
Young.
   Chile also exports melons to the United States at this time of
year, but FDA spokesman William Grigg said ``it is not clear
whether they will be returned to the (U.S.) market or not this
season.''
   Chilean fruit was removed from store shelves and unsold supplies
were held in warehouses, at ports, and on ships after the FDA found
traces of cyanide in two seedless red grapes. The FDA began looking
for evidence of cyanide tampering after two telephone calls to the
U.S. embassy in the Chilean capital of Santiago threatened to
inject the poison into fruit exports.
   An estimated $50 million to $75 million worth of Chilean fruit
that could not be readily inspected had to be destroyed. Meanwhile,
the FDA conducted tests on the different fruits to identify the
detectable damage caused by cyanide injections, so inspectors would
know what to look for.
   Evidence of cyanide poisoning includes discoloration and
deterioration of the fruit, the FDA said, and the agency advised
consumers to examine fruit as a precaution, including the area at
the stem, for discolorations and punctures.
   Inspectors have found no further cyanide contamination in any of
the fruit from Chile, despite a third telephone threat that was
received last Friday, shortly before the FDA announced its
stepped-up inspection plan to return Chilean fruit to U.S. stores.

   A man with a pistol killed the
former mayor of a small town in Calabria on Friday, and the Italian
news media said police suspected the regional Mafia was involved.
   Police said Ferdinando Martino, 51, the mayor of Bruzzano
Zeffirio from July 1987 to June 1988, was shot to death as he
chatted with several people in the center of the town, and the
killer fled.
   The investigation was assigned to a magistrate who has handled
cases involving the criminal organization that is the Calabrian
counterpart of Sicily's Mafia. Calabria forms the toe of the
boot-shaped Italian peninsula.

   STOKE-UPON-TRENT, England (AP) _ A fairground cable car buffeted
by strong winds became entangled in communications lines Friday,
trapping 11 people for more than two hours nearly 100 feet above
ground, an official said.
   The Skyride at Alton Towers leisure park in western England came
to a halt when one of three cable cars carrying 27 people became
entangled with overhead wires after a sharp gust of wind, a park
manager said on condition of anonymity.
   Some passengers rappeled to safety, bhave never been so scared in my

Bobby Hargreaves, 23. ``I thought I was going to die.''
   ``It's the best ride I've had all day,'' said another,

   Hungarian Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz said
Friday he and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev reached complete
agreement in talks on Hungary's drive for a multiparty system and
increasing calls for neutrality.
   ``There were no issues in our three-hour discussion where we had
differences in our views,'' Grosz told a Moscow news conference.
   Reforms began earlier in Hungary than in the Soviet Union and
have progressed further, making it both a laboratory for economic
and social experiments in the East bloc and a source of worry for
Moscow over whether Budapest is going too far.
   Grosz arrived Thursday on his first visit to Moscow since
Hungarian party leaders last month declared their support for a
multiparty system.
   Grosz said he explained the decision to Gorbachev, and added,
``This is strictly up to the Hungarian people and the Hungarian
leadership.''
   ``It is natural that the political structure of a country
develop in its own particular way,'' he said.
   Grosz said that neither a one-party system, prevalent in Eastern
Europe, nor a multiparty system either ensures or precludes
democracy.
   The Soviet Union, where the Communist Party remains intolerant
of any challenge, is seeking to implement reforms based on its own
history, Grosz said.
   Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth said after visiting Moscow early
this month that Gorbachev approved Hungary's reforms and does not
oppose introduction of a multiparty system there.
   Despite sanctioning competition, Grosz said he does not
anticipate becoming leader of an opposition party. The Hungarian
Communist Party, he said, ``is sure to win a leading role. I'm not
thinking of being an opposition leader, I'm thinking of being the
leader of the winning party.''
   Asked about growing demands in Hungary for neutrality, Grosz
said, ``We are continually working for elimination of the two
military blocs on the European continent. If that happens, there
will be no question about the neutrality of Hungary.''
   ``We met complete unanimity of views'' with Gorbachev, he said.
   The Hungarian news agency MTI said Gorbachev told Grosz that
present world circumstances do not give any Warsaw Pact members a
chance to be neutral.
   The two leaders also expressed their support for a continuing
re-evaluation of the Soviet invasion that crushed the Hungarian
uprising of 1956, Grosz said.
   In order for the two sides to form an accurate record,
historians on both sides must gain access to documents of the
period, he said. ``Gorbachev's support is necessary to ensure that
the historians who are looking into this matter get a look at
authentic documents,'' Grosz said.
   The Tass new agency said the focus of the meeting was an
``exchange of expertise and information about pressing issues of
socialist construction in both countries and the development of
cooperation in all areas.''

   The National Organization for Women said Friday
its message favoring abortion rights was refused by more than two
dozen radio stations in five northeastern cities.
   ``It never occurred to us that we wouldn't be able to place paid
ads on a subject that's on everyone's lips. It is the issue of the
day in terms of women's rights,'' Molly Yard, the president of NOW,
said at a news conference.
   NOW budgeted about $40,000 to place the 60-second spot on 35
stations in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and
Washington. Eight stations agreed to carry the spot and 26
declined; one station had not decided, Ms. Yard said.
   The spot was aimed at promoting an April 9 march in Washington
supporting the right to abortion. Ms. Yard said organizers expected
as many as 250,000 people to attend.
   NOW's advertisement was produced to sound like a newscast, with
an announcer setting a scene, followed by clips of President Bush
and Vice President Daniel Quayle voicing their opposition to
abortion.
   In the ad, actress Susan Sarandon concludes with the warning
that ``A woman's right to choose now hangs in the balance.''
   Ms. Yard said the radio stations had refused to run the
advertisement because of its controversial content.
   ``It's like the stupid decision that's made on condoms. They
won't talk about condoms, they won't show them on TV, and now
they're not going to talk about abortion,'' she said.
   However, executives at several radio stations that declined to
accept the advertising spot said they were bothered not by its
content but because of the format.
   ``We won't take anything if they're trying to simulate a
newscast. You can't fake a newscast,'' said Warren Maurer, general
manager of WINS-AM, an all-news station in New York.
   Jeff Messerman, national sales manager for WXKS-FM, a Boston
station playing contemporary hit music, said the station refused to
air the ad because of its newscast format and sound effects.
   ``It has exploding bombs, sirens, just things you don't want to
have on copy. We thought that this was a spot that was going to
cause people to tune out,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines has moved swiftly to capture
some of the business abandoned by strikebound sister carrier
Eastern Airlines, but it disputes union claims that its moves are
part of a master plan to grow at Eastern's expense.
   Amid its own labor problems _ flight attendants on Friday ended
a four-day walkout that had little impact on service _ Continental
has added flights on routes vacated by Eastern, taken over Eastern
gates at some airports and waged an aggressive ad campaign to
attract more East Coast passengers.
   Industry observers say the Houston-based airline has gained
passengers and revenue, but no more so than other competitors since
Eastern virtually shut down after the March 4 strike by its
Machinists union and subsequent walkouts by pilots and flight
attendants.
   ``Every carrier that still flies will be doing better now than
they were before the strike, with the exception of some of the
commuter lines who may have been feeding into Eastern flights,''
said George James, president of Airline Economics Inc. in
Washington D.C.
   ``So Continental will certainly see benefits, but I think that
there are a number of carriers who will have far greater benefits
than Continental,'' James said.
   Eastern is reorganizing under federal bankruptcy court
protection from creditors.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland in New York extended an
order Friday forcing rival airlines to honor agreements governing
ticket, baggage and cargo transfers essential to keeping
strike-crippled Eastern Airlines airborne. He also barred the
striking Machinists from picketing on Eastern property at Logan
International Airport in Boston.
   Separately, a federal appeals court in Miami told a lower court
to reconsider the airline's request that it force Eastern pilots
back to work.
   Eastern's unions have claimed that the parent of the two
airlines, Texas Air Corp., has been trying to funnel Eastern assets
to Continental, a largely non-union carrier. The Machinists and Air
Line Pilots Association have asked the federal bankruptcy court to
appoint a trustee to govern Eastern's daily operations and business
transactions, removing company management from that role.
   The unions also allege that Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo is
using Continental as a profit-generating tool against the striking
workers.
   But Continental officials say they _ like other airlines _
simply are responding to consumer demand created by the strike.
   Continental has added eight flights out of its Newark hub, nine
additional flights on Miami routes abandoned by Eastern and a new
Cleveland-Miami route.
   The carrier also took over eight Eastern landing slots at New
York's LaGuardia Airport and eight at Washington's National
Airport, under what Continental describes as a 60-day lease.
   ``These added flights are simply to help us address demand in
the marketplace, and this really is no different from what other
carriers out there are doing,'' said Continental spokesman Ned
Walker.
   Charles Bryan, president of Eastern's Machinists union, said
Lorenzo is ``using Continental like a war machine'' to offset the
Eastern strike, increasing revenues and expanding Continental
permanently into Eastern's markets.
   Robert Joedicke, an airline analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. in New York, said Continental's ability to offset Eastern's
losses for Texas Air was limited.
   ``There are some short-term advantages to Continental as they
pick up some additional flights and passengers, just as there are
to other airlines,'' Joedicke said.
   ``But the advantage through Continental from a Texas Air point
of view will come nowhere near making up for what is being lost at
Eastern as a result of the strike and the bankruptcy filing.''
   Eastern is averaging just over 100 flights daily, compared with
1,040 daily before the strike.
   Continental officials had no available figures on profits since
the Eastern strike began.
   ``When they release their March traffic results we'll be able to
make some judgments,'' said Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst for
Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York.
   Other analysts said that while there are some clear winners in
the Eastern strike, Continental appears to be a lesser player.
   ``Some are obviously seeing benefits, not the least of which is
Delta Air Lines' operations in Atlanta,'' James said.
   ``Delta and Eastern have had about 90 percent of the market
there with Delta holding about 55 or 60 percent, so with Eastern
down, Delta does not face a large amount of competition,'' he said.
   Also, James said, Pan Am has doubled its operations on the
lucrative New York-Washington-Boston shuttle during peak periods.
United Airlines, Trans World Airlines and USAir have capitalized on
flights between the Midwest and the East Coast.

   A federal bankruptcy judge on Friday extended an
order forcing rival airlines to honor agreements governing ticket,
baggage and cargo transfers essential to keeping strike-crippled
Eastern Airlines airborne.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland also barred striking
Machinists from picketing on Eastern property at Logan
International Airport in Boston.
   Separately, a federal appeals court in Miami told a lower court
to reconsider the airline's request that it force Eastern pilots
back to work.
   Earlier, Continental Airlines' flight attendants terminated a
four-day strike that had little apparent effect on Eastern's sister
carrier.
   The developments came on the 21st day of a walkout by the
8,500-member Machinists union being honored by pilots and flight
attendants. Eastern is operating a limited schedule on its
Northeast shuttle and on Latin and South American routes.
   In New York, Eastern attorneys said in bankruptcy court that the
airline was negotiating with rivals to maintain interline
agreements that allow passengers and bags to make connecting
flights on different carriers.
   Eastern said that without cooperation among carriers, its few
services would be crippled. The pacts do not govern agreements with
other airlines honoring Eastern tickets purchased before the strike.
   Lifland granted a two-week extension to an order that
competitors honor the agreements.
   ``We've had very substantial discussions and negotiations with
the major carriers,'' said Eastern's vice president for marketing,
George J. Brennan. ``They're all willing to resolve this.''
   Lifland also barred picketing on a 150-yard-long sidewalk in
front of Eastern's terminal at Logan International Airport after
the airline complained Machinists were trespassing on private
property.
   In Houston, Union of Flight Attendants spokeswoman Myra Clayton
said the union was notifying flight attendants at Eastern's sister
airline, Continental, to return to work.
   Continental said no flights were disrupted or canceled because
of the walkout. It said 200 flight attendants took part; the union
reported more than 1,200 strikers.
   The union, which represents more than 6,000 flight attendants,
called the walkout Monday to protest what it said were substandard
wages and working conditions at the carrier.
   In Miami, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals told a lower
court judge that he had the authority to rule whether the walkout
by Eastern's 3,600 pilots constitutes a primary or secondary strike.
   Eastern earlier this month asked the judges to overturn a lower
court ruling permitting the Air Line Pilots Association to honor
striking Machinists' picket lines under the Railway Labor Act of
1926.
   ``A claim of a sympathy strike cannot be used as a pretext to
shield conduct that otherwise would be a clear violation of the
Railway Labor Act,'' the appeals court said.
   It said U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis has the authority to
rule on what kind of strike the pilots are engaged in.
   The ALPA said it is buying advertising this weekend in major
newspapers in Miami, Atlanta, Washington, Boston and New York to
publicize its position and deter other pilots from going to work
for Eastern.
   The advertisement describes the alleged pitfalls of working for
Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air. Corp.,
including limited career opportunities and low pay scales, and
says: ``Pilots choose your career opportunities wisely.''

   A woman who pulled her car over when she
saw a blue light flashing behind her thought she was being stopped
by police, but instead was overpowered and raped by the driver of
an unmarked car, police said.
   Such blue lights cost $6.99 at auto supply stores, police said
this week. It is not illegal to buy them, although their use is
illegal, they said.
   The woman told police she was driving near the Connecticut
border Saturday night when a car behind her flashed its high beams,
then turned on a flashing blue light.
   When she stopped, a man in civilian clothes approached the car,
talked with her, then overpowered and handcuffed her before taking
her to an isolated stretch of road in Connecticut where she was
sexually assaulted, the victim told police.
   Eugene C. Texter III, 27, has been charged with kidnapping and
for violating the terms of his bail on a previous sexual assault
charge. Connecticut State Police were investigating the rape charge.

   The Coast Guard suspended its search for a
52-foot sport fishing boat Friday night after almost 24 hours of
battling rough seas and poor visibility with no success, a
spokesman said.
   ``We haven't got any new information,'' Petty Officer 1st Class
Rick Woods said. ``As of about six o'clock, the units that are out
there will finish their search patterns and come back in.''
   Woods said the area had been thoroughly and unsuccessfully
searched by three Coast Guard cutters, two Navy ships and a Coast
Guard helicopter.
   He did not know whether the search would be resumed.
   The Coast Guard received a distress call Thursday night saying
the Blue Goose, with 10 people aboard, was sinking off the Virginia
coast.
   About an hour later, the boat radioed that it was taking on
water about five miles off Virginia Beach and that the occupants
had donned life jackets and were abandoning the vessel. The Coast
Guard advised the people to stay together but received no
acknowledgement of that transmission.
   Driving rain, 50-knot winds and seas of 6 to 8 feet were
reported about the time the distress call was received.
   An all-night search turned up no sign of the boat or its
passengers. Water temperatures were in the 40s, which could cause
hypothermia in anyone who was overboard, said Petty Officer 1st
Class Vernon Covington.
   The Coast Guard searched boat registrations in every East Coast
state and found no record of a vessel named the Blue Goose that
matches the description of the fishing vessel, Petty Officer 1st
Class Rick Barrett said.
   ``If it's not a documented vessel and all we have is the name,
it's hard for us to track down the information,'' he said.
   Coast Guard spokesmen said the distress call sounded legitimate
and they had no reason to believe the call was a hoax.
   ``We don't know that this is a hoax, but there have been hoaxes
before,'' said Petty Officer 2nd Class Steve Blando.

   Health officials said Friday they will
begin vaccinating up to 4,000 people after an infant became the
sixth person to die in an outbreak of meningococcal disease.
   Yakima County health officials also conferred with the federal
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta on how to deal with about
400 participants from seven states at a basketball tournament
underway in nearby Wapato.
   Teams at the all-Indian tournament, which began Wednesday, are
from Kansas, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, California and
Oklahoma.
   Health officials want to ensure they do not carry the disease
back to their states. Options include quarantining participants,
vaccinating them, or sending them home with no treatment, said Dr.
Bob Atwood, county health director.
   Dr. Jay Wenger of CDC said a quarantine was unlikely because the
risk of participants contracting the disease is very low.
   It was a discouraging day for health officials, who on Wednesday
said they felt they were through the worst of the nation's largest
current outbreak of meningococcal disease.
   The meningococcus germ is carried in the nose and throat and
passed through sneezing and other secretions from the nose and
mouth. It is not considered highly contagious.
   In the Yakima outbreak, the germ is causing bacterial
meningitis, an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal
cord, and meningococcemia, in which it travels through the blood
stream and attacks organs.
   Adults who become infected usually do not become sick, but can
carry the disease to children. Symptoms are similar to the common
cold, and include fever, nausea, headache and a rash.
   An unidentified infant died Thursday in the latest case, making
it the 18th since Jan. 10. Of the six deaths, four were infants.
The state had only four deaths from meningococcal disease in all of
1988.
   ``This suggests there is a high rate of carriers in the
county,'' Atwood told an emergency meeting of the county health
board.
   That is troubling because the basketball tournament has drawn
large crowds, who have mingled with the out-of-town visitors,
making it impossible to do conventional contact-tracing techniques
to identify those most at risk of exposure, he said.
   As a result, health officials planned to vaccinate everyone
between ages 1 to 25 in the Wapato area on Friday and Saturday, a
total of about 4,000 people, Atwood said.
   The vaccine does not work on people under age 1 and people over
25 who are exposed rarely become ill, Atwood said.
   Most of the deaths in the outbreak have involved Hispanics or
Native Americans, and the common denominator is low-income families
living in crowded conditions, officials said.

   Japan's defense chief said Friday that a new round
of talks in Washington between Japanese and U.S. officials on the
FSX fighter project started with disagreement.
   ``The contents of the talks were very tough,'' Kichiro Tazawa,
director-general of the Defense Agency, said at a news conference.
   Agency Deputy Director Seiki Nishihiro and U.S. officials,
including Secretary of State James A. Baker III, met Thursday to
discuss the joint development of Japan's next generation jet
fighter plane.
   President Bush said this week he endorsed joint production of
the FSX fighter but with some changes to protect U.S. technology.
His decision followed criticism that the plan amounted to a
giveaway of up to $8 billion worth of American technology.
   Tazawa said, however, that Washington should stick to the terms
of the original agreement signed in November. Under the agreement,
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Japan's major defense contractor,
and U.S. aircraft maker General Dynamics Corp. would develop the
new fighter.
   Nishihiro, scheduled to remain in Washington until Sunday, will
continue to hold meetings with U.S. officials, Tazawa said.
   Japan originally planned to develop the fighter independently
but negotiated a joint development agreement after Washington put
pressure on Tokyo to buy U.S.-built planes.
   American critics, however, have warned that U.S. technology for
the plane could help Japan compete against American companies in
the manufacture of civilian aircraft, a high-technology field in
which Japan now lags but has targeted for development.
   Under the development agreement, reached after several years of
negotiations, Mitsubishi would be responsible for developing the
new fighter by using technology developed domestically and from the
F-16, developed by the St. Louis-based General Dynamics.
   General Dynamics would receive 35 percent to 40 percent of the
contract in the developmental stage.
   Initially, 130 planes would be built, with a possible follow-up
order for about 100 more. Each FSX would cost about $40 million,
Japanese officials say.

   Americans' personal income shot up 1 percent
last month while consumer spending advanced at a more restrained
pace, boosting the savings rate to its highest level in nearly
three years, the government said Friday.
   Personal income, bolstered by strong growth in employment and
wages, has posted two straight solid gains, rising to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $4.32 trillion last month after surging 1.7
percent in January, the Commerce Department reported.
   But when it comes to spending that money, consumers have been
showing more restraint. Personal consumption expenditures rose 0.5
percent in February to an annual rate of $3.38 trillion after
advancing 0.4 percent in January.
   ``The consumer is still getting a lot of dollars placed in his
wallet,' said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust
Co. in Chicago. ``But when it came to spending, consumers suddenly
have decided this income is not going to be disbursed as lavishly
as it has been.''
   The uneven advances in income and spending resulted in a healthy
jump in the personal savings rate _ savings as a percentage of
after-tax income _ to 5.9 percent from 5.4 percent in the previous
month.
   February's rate matched the savings level set in April 1986 and
hasn't been surpassed since May 1985, when the rate was 6.4
percent. The rate has been on the increase since it hit a 40-year
low of 3.2 percent in 1987.
   Analysts said the latest report on personal income and spending
demonstrated that the economy continued to show strength last month
even as some signs of a slowdown emerge.
   Most analysts expect the economy to cool this year as the
Federal Reserve Board continues to push up interest rates in an
effort to restrain growth and keep inflation in check.
   ``There are already a few signs that higher interest rates are
cooling off the overall economy, which means fewer jobs being
generated in the months ahead and smaller income gains,'' said
Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group in Washington. ``We will
continue to see consumer spending expanding, but at a more modest
rate.''
   Last month's gain in income included a large increase in farm
subsidy payments. But excluding that effect, income still rose a
healthy 0.7 percent last month.
   Wages and salaries, a key component of personal income, rose 0.6
percent to $2.57 trillion last month following a 1.1 percent gain
in January.
   On the spending side, most of the modest gain came in a 1
percent rise in spending for services, which analysts said was
largely a reflection of an upturn in heating bills last month after
January's mild weather.
   Purchases of non-durable goods edged up 0.1 percent and spending
on durable goods declined 0.3 percent. The decline in durable goods
_ ``big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years _
primarily was due to lackluster car sales, which have been held
back by higher interest rates and reduced demand after earlier
strong sales.
   William Dunkelberg, dean of the School of Business and
Management at Temple University, said the slower gain in spending
``should be interpreted as a return to normal spending behavior''
from earlier, unsustainably high levels fueled by strong employment.
   Analysts said the rise in the savings rate reflected the big
drop in auto sales and recent increases in farm income because
farmers generally don't alter their spending patterns based on when
they receive income and subsidies.
   Farm income, subject to wide swings, was up 32 percent in
February after shooting up 103 percent in January.
   Ms. Shaber said the savings rate also might be going up in part
because consumers are retrenching somewhat as they become ``a
little bit more concerned'' about the possibility of an economic
downturn.
   Consumers are more likely to feel the pinch of higher interest
rates this year as their adjustable-rate mortgages rachet upward
and slower income growth fails to ease the bite of other higher
financing costs, she said.

<TEXT>
   A 50-foot boat carrying about 100 Haitians was
intercepted Friday just outside U.S. territorial waters, and the
refugees will be returned to their homeland, the Coast Guard
reported.
   Officers determined that the Haitians' wooden sailboat was
intercepted 3.2 miles from shore, just outside the 3-mile limit,
said Petty Officer Luis Diaz.
   ``Real close,'' Diaz said. ``They did two readings and confirmed
that is the correct position _ perhaps they were just a breath away
from making it into the three miles.''
   If the Haitians had been inside the limit, they would have been
brought ashore for detention and processing, and their claims for
asylum would have been considered by Immigration and Naturalization
Service workers.
   Diaz said the Haitians were spotted early Friday by the crew of
a tanker about three miles east of Fort Lauderdale.
   Medical personnel were sent to the sailboat as a precaution and
the unsuccessful immigrants also were given water, Diaz said. Two
of the would-be immigrants were taken to Memorial Hospital in
Hollywood.
   ``They're suffering from exposure and dehydrated,'' hospital
spokeswoman Linda Hamlin said late Friday afternoon, adding it was
too soon to say if they would be admitted.
   A Coast Guard cutter was dispatched to return the Haitians to
their homeland.
   Leaders of Miami's Haitian community, meanwhile, attacked what
they call a racist immigration policy. While Cubans and Nicaraguans
are received with open arms, they say, Haitians aren't even allowed
into the country.
   ``It's clear they're playing games with the black refugees,''
said Gerard Jean-Juste, director of Miami's Haitian Refugee Center.
``We would like to see something done about it.''
   An INS official denied there was any discrimination in the
interdiction policy.
   ``It's just that more Haitians are coming in boats than any
other ethnic group,'' said INS district director Perry Rivkind.
``There's nothing really one can do.''

   Anti-abortion protesters were arrested by the busload at
demonstrations in several cities as the group Operation Rescue
kicked its Holy Week campaign into high gear on Good Friday.
   Arrests numbered in the triple digits in Philadelphia and
Albany, N.Y., as demonstrators chanted, prayed, picketed and
blocked entrances at women's clinics Friday. Long Beach, Calif.,
Syracuse, N.Y., Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio, and St. Paul, Minn.,
had more peaceful protests.
   Binghamton, N.Y.-based Operation Rescue has organized periodic
demonstrations of civil disobedience to publicize its stance
against abortion, and Holy Week has been a traditional time for
anti-abortion protests. Abortion rights groups used the anticipated
demonstrations to organize counterprotests in several cities.
   In Long Beach, site of the largest demonstration, about 350
abortion foes blocked doorways at a downtown medical office as some
300 abortion rights advocates chanted, ``Read 'em their rights and
take them away.''
   However, Police Chief Lawrence Binkley refused to make arrests,
saying the building was closed.
   It was not immediately clear whether the protesters, who had
arrived about 6:30 a.m., had kept the office from opening or
whether the facility was scheduled to be closed Friday.
   Operation Rescue's leader, Randall Terry, arrived on the scene
as the protest was well under way and declared, ``What a riot.'' He
repeated his claim that the news media is ``hiding the truth from
the American public.''
   One anti-abortion activist was charged with misdemeanor battery
for allegedly throwing himself onto three pro-choice activists
sitting on the ground in front of another clinic, said Sgt. Bill
Snow.
   About 1:45 p.m., a man called the administrative offices of
Planned Parenthood and ``said there's a bomb in the building and
it's going to blow up any minute,'' said Stephanie Alexander,
director of clinical programs.
   About 30 people evacuated the building but police found no bomb
and the workers returned an hour later, said Dr. Joan Babbott,
executive director.
   A day earlier 373 protesters had been hauled off by police in
the Los Angeles suburb of Cypress.
   In Philadelphia, 400 to 500 demonstrators on both sides of the
abortion issue gathered in rain and gusting winds outside two
downtown clinics a block apart. About 180 people _ more than four
busloads _ were carted off by police for blocking entrances at the
Planned Parenthood clinic and the Elizabeth Blackwell Health Center
for Women.
   Marcy McCook, a worker at Planned Parenthood, said abortion
rights advocates were staging a counterdemonstration because
``people are afraid they're going to lose their rights.''
   In Albany, some 200 protesters carried banners and signs that
read, ``Abortion, The Ultimate Child Abuse,'' ``Baby Humans
Slaughtered Here'' and ``Hitler Would be Proud of Planned
Parenthood,'' shortly after dawn at the downtown office of Upper
Hudson Planned Parenthood.
   About 115 protesters were arrested for blocking the clinic's
doors or standing on clinic property. They went limp, forcing
police to drag them into waiting vans and a converted passenger bus.
   ``We're trying to save babies,'' said Bishop Austin Vaughan of
the New York Roman Catholic Archdiocese, as he was carted away. He
said he'd been arrested five times before at similar protests.
   The demonstrators refused to say whether they were part of
Operation Rescue, but some sported ``O.R.'' armbands and Operation
Rescue sweatshirts. By afternoon, a pro-choice advocates had begun
a counterdemonstration across the street.
   In Syracuse, police used wheelchairs to haul away as many as 50
protesters who entered the Planned Parenthood Center while about
100 others picketed outside in a cold drizzle.
   ``They barged in and shoved at least one staff worker aside,''
said Jim Dessauer, the clinic's community relations director. ``I
don't think they pushed any patients, but they certainly verbally
harangued and harassed them.''
   In St. Paul, Minn., about 150 anti-abortion protesters, some
carrying large crosses, chanted and prayed outside St. Paul-Ramsey
Medical Center in their traditional Good Friday protest. Police
reported no arrests.
   About three dozen protesters from Cincinnati blocked doors at
the Dayton Women's Health Center in suburban Kettering. About 30
were handcuffed and put onto a police bus as the few remaining
demonstrators cheered.
   Mary Keck, a protester, said the group came to Dayton because
Cincinnati police were waiting for them. Earlier, in Cincinnati, 30
to 35 demonstrators picketed two women's clinics but no on was
arrested.

<TEXT>
   A popular high school teacher and class
adviser was killed Friday by a gunman with a semiautomatic weapon
who shot him three times in the back as he left for school, police
said.
   Detectives sought a student recently expelled from Grant High
School in suburban Van Nuys, but didn't consider him a suspect and
weren't sure if the victim played a role in his expulsion, said
police Lt. Warren Knowles.
   Harold ``Hal'' Arthur, 60, a social studies teacher and senior
class adviser at the school for 20 years, was shot as he put some
papers in the back seat of his car about 6 a.m., Knowles said.
   The killer, who fired six shots from a .22-caliber semiautomatic
gun, apparently was either standing in the street or sitting in a
car in front of Arthur's home in the San Fernando Valley suburb of
Sherman Oaks, the lieutenant said at an afternoon news conference.
   The teacher's wife, Virginia, and one of his two sons ran
outside to find him on the ground, and he was pronounced dead a
short time later at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital.
   Neighbor Hal Gelman, a screenwriter, said he heard the shooting.
   ``I heard this sound like `bap, bap, bap _ like an AK or an
Uzi,'' said neighbor Hal Gelman, referring to an AK-47 and another,
Israeli-made semiautomatic weapon. California legislators have
moved to ban the sales of such weapons since five children were
killed by a gunman in a Stockton schoolyard in January.
   Robbery was tentatively ruled out as a motive.
   ``He simply walked out, started to get into his car and was shot
from behind,'' Knowles said. ``No one approached him to take
anything from him.''
   A 16- or 17-year-old boy who had been expelled from Grant was
being sought at his home and at his new school, North Hollywood
High, where he hasn't been seen since Tuesday.
   ``Some of the students we talked to indicated it would be worth
our while to talk to him. They said he had a grudge against
(Arthur),'' Knowles said.
   Police did not specify whether Arthur had anything to do with
the boy's expulsion.
   As senior class adviser, Arthur helped students with social
activities and was well-liked, said Shel Erlich, spokesman for the
Los Angeles Unified School District.
   Counselors from the district's mental health crisis team rushed
to the school to help calm students, the spokesman said.
   ``Everybody seems to be down,'' Erlich said. ``Some students are
handling it better than others.''
   Gelman, Arthur's neighbor, said the victim used to throw
semester-end parties for students.
   ``Mobs of kids would come,'' Gelman recalled. ``He was very
popular.''

   A drug addict who cut a bloody path through a
Denver suburb with a submachine gun heated up debate over
semiautomatic weapons Friday in a state where residents jealously
guard their firearms and their freedom.
   Denver City Councilman Cathy Reynolds said she intends to
introduce a resolution Monday declaring the council's intention to
pass a law restricting or prohibiting the sale of such weapons.
   ``They're weapons of war, even if it's only a small war, like we
saw yesterday,'' said Reynolds, who expects strong opposition to
the measure.
   Eugene Thompson Jr., described by authorities as a 20-year-old
man with an insatiable appetite for cocaine, killed two women with
a semiautomatic machine pistol, raped another woman, and wounded
two deputies and a hostage before fatally wounding himself in a
10-hour reign of terror Thursday.
   Thompson used a semiautomatic MAC-11 submachine gun, which can
hold 32 bullets. Only five bullets were left when the manhunt for
him ended.
   Last week, following a trend of nationwide outrage over
semiautomatic weapons, state Senate President Ted Strickland
sponsored a bill that would ban the sale, transfer and receipt of
semiautomatic assault rifles.
   The Republican legislator said Thursday's tragedy would stir
emotions on both sides, but he doesn't expect the measure to be
very popular among Colorado's residents, who tend to love their
firearms and their freedom.
   ``There will be an awful lot of heat generated, not much light
and very few minds changed,'' he said.
   Authorities said Friday that the gunman, a drug addict with a
long criminal record, used a gun stolen during a March 19
burglary.Investigators said they also had arrested a suspected
accomplice, Donald Andrews, on charges of taking part in 71
burglaries with Thompson.
   Andrews was being questioned Friday to learn whether Thompson
had said anything prior to his rampage, according to Lt. Bill
Walker of the Douglas County Sheriff's Department.
   Thompson had been a suspect in at least 140 thefts and
burglaries, and had been sought on arrest warrants issued Monday
for failure to appear in Golden District Court for probation
revocation, authorities said.
   His 18-year-old hostage, Jake Carper, remained in critical but
stable condition Friday following surgery at Swedish Medical
Center, officials said.
   Arapahoe County Deputy Daniel Thomas, 36, and Deputy Arthur L.
Hilton, 37, were released from Swedish Medical Center after being
treated for gunshot wounds and shrapnel wounds from flying glass.
   In addition to Thompson, the dead included Beverly J. Swartz,
48, and Janice Irene Swartz, 68. Autopsies Friday showed that
Beverly was shot in the head and Janice was shot in the head, chest
and ankle after they were bound with rope. Shots were also fired at
Oscar Swartz, the husband of Janice Swartz, but he played dead and
survived, authorities said.
   Arapahoe County Sheriff Pat Sullivan, who took part in a
dramatic rescue of two of his wounded deputies by driving his car
through a fence, held up the MAC-11 after the shootings and
demanded that such ``weapons of war'' be regulated or banned.
   For comparison, Sullivan also held up the bloody .38-caliber
revolver used by one of his wounded deputies.
   ``Our officers are out-gunned. ... These guns are designed to
kill and maim people,'' said Sullivan, who had come out against
semiautomatic weapon sales before the rampage.
   The California Assembly already has approved a ban on 40 types
of assault-type weapons, and similar action is pending in other
states. California took the action after a man with an AK-47
assault rifle killed five schoolchildren and wounded 29 others
along with a teacher.

   A federal order Friday that could sink a $500
million proposed dam and reservoir drew angry charges of
interference from some Colorado officials, but environmentalists
praised it as wise and courageous.
   Denver Mayor Federico Pena and other members of the Denver Water
Board, themain sponsors of the Two Forks Dam, were dismayed after
hearing of the decision by Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator William K. Reilly.
   ``We feel Mr. Reilly has interjected himself in this process
outside the purview of the EPA's own regulations,'' said Denver
Water Board President Monte Pascoe.
   Pascoe said the project ``addressed environmental and other
concerns and has emerged far and away as the biggest long-term
water supply plan for the Denver metropolitan area.''
   The eight-year-old project on the South Platte River southwest
of Denver has been the center of a bitter fight between
environmentalists and Denver area officials who say the region
needs the dam for its future water needs.
   Reilly began procedures tantamount to overruling a construction
permit issued earlier this month by the Corps of Engineers, which
could lead to a veto of the project if compromises are not worked
out.
   Gov. Roy Romer called Reilly's position a ``basic disagreement
between federal agencies about how the decision should be made.''
   ``That disagreement is fertile ground for delay and
indecision,'' the governor said. He said he would prefer to see a
permit for Two Forks issued with ``a 25-year shelf life,'' and
added he would be willing to take action to compensate for damage
to the environment and wildlife.
   Pena said ``the impact of a final rejection of Two Forks, in my
opinion, will have stronger environmental consequences. That is the
message not communicated to the EPA office.''
   U.S. Sen. Tim Wirth and environmentalist organizations, however,
praised Reilly's action.
   ``I think we should view EPA's decision as a commitment by the
Bush administration to conserving one of America's most beautiful
canyons and conserving water resources,'' Wirth said.
   ``But today's decision does not mean that we should stop looking
for ways to provide more water for metropolitan Denver,'' he added.
   Dr. Jay D. Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation,
headquartered in Washington, D.C., said, ``I commend (the) EPA
administrator for a courageous position. ... It is economically a
bad project and environmentally, it's been a disaster.''
   Audubon Society President Peter A. Berle said the decision was
the first major environmental test for President Bush and he passed
it ``with flying colors.''

   Millions of dollars worth of programs are
planned to restore and modernize Athens in full confidence Greece
will win the right to host the 1996 Olympics, Culture Minister
Meline Mercouri said Thursday.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou and Ms. Mercouri said at a news
conference that the plans included construction of a new museum to
house the treasures of the Acropolis and new wings for existing
museums.
   Ms. Mercouri said an international architectual contest will
begin in April for the Acropolis museum.
   She said Greece was confident that it would be the site of the
Olympics in 1996, the 100th anniversary of the modern games, and
that the work would be done by then.
   Papandreou, 70, was accompanied by his 34-year-old live-in
girlfriend, Dimitra Liani.
   Scores of photographers pushed and shoved each other for position
to photograph Ms. Liani, who was wearing a bright pink spring outfit.
   Papandreou is seeking a divorce from his American-born wife, the
former Margaret Chant of Elmhurst, Ill. He smiled and waved to a
small group of supporters as he entered and left the press hall.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Andreas Papandreou's Socialist
government suffered a double blow Thursday when two of its most
prominent figures were accused of direct involvement in a massive
financial scandal.
   Yiannis Mantzouranis, former secretary to the Cabinet, told an
investigating magistrate that fugitive banker George Koskotas had
bribed a former minister to the premier, Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas, to
help cover up financial wrongdoings at his bank.
   Mantzouranis was an associate of Koskotas.
   In another development, Theofanis Tobras, the Public Telephone
Corporation's general manager, was jailed after testifying before
another magistrate investigating the Koskotas affair.
   Koutsogiorgas, a close friend of Papandreou's for 25 years, has
strongly denied any involvement in the scandal. No judicial action
has been taken against him so far. He resigned his post last week.
   Koskotas, the former chairman of the Bank of Crete, fled Greece
November 6 after being indicted in the $200 million fraud, forgery
and embezzlement scandal. He was arrested in the United States and
is awaiting an extradition hearing.
   In interviews from jail in Salem, Mass., Koskotas claimed that
Papandreou, Koutsogiorgas and other officials received millions of
dollars in payoffs and authorized the bank fraud.
   Mantzouranis, who was the banker's lawyer, was arrested March 9
and charged with accepting stolen money from Koskotas.
   Mantzouranis made the accusations during a second day of
testimony before Giorgos Skarlatos, the magistrate investigating the
scandal.
   ``The course of the investigation has shown that Koutsogiorgas
bears responsibilities for this crime,'' Mantzouranis' lawyer,
Filipos Damoflis, told reporters after his client testifed for 10
hours.
   He added that the judicial investigation should be finished and
sent to Parliament for examination.
   Under the Greek Constitution, Parliament is the only body that
can appoint a special judicial panel to investigate wrongdoings
perpetrated by acting or former ministers.
   The scandal has prompted both Conservative and Communist
opposition parties to call for Papandreou's resignation.
   In his written testimony, leaked to the press, Mantzouranis said
he arranged to deposit $2 million in a Swiss bank as payment to
Koutsogiorgas for a special secrecy act that stifled an audit of the
Bank of Crete in July 1988.
   ``I opened an account ... in three names. Mine, Mr.
Koutsogiorgas' and in the name of his son Dimitris Koutsogiorgas,''
said the testimony, which included the purported bank account number.
   Tobras was charged with breach of faith for depositing $12.5
million in the Bank of Crete last summer.
   He became the fourth manager of a public corporation to be jailed
for depositing large amounts of money in the bank at lower than
normal interest rates when it was suffering from a cash-flow problem.
   Among the corporations are Olympic Airways and the post office.
   Tobras, a Socialist, has in the past been charged with tapping
the telephones of opposition parties and using firearms to harrass
journalists. He has not yet been tried on the charges.

<HEAD>High Court Declines to Stay Execution for Triple Slayer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WHITE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court on Thursday
rejected a triple murderer's plea for a stay of his execution by
injection or hanging.
   The high court said the motion for a stay, based mostly on
Charles Rodman Campbell's absence during jury selection for his 1982
murder trial, was not worthy of further consideration.
   Campbell attorney Robert Gombiner conceded that Campbell had
signed a waiver of his right be present at jury selection, but
argued that ``by court rule a defendant in a capital case can never
waive his right to be present at jury selection.''
   Campbell is scheduled to die at 12:01 a.m. next Thursday for the
1982 knife slayings of Renae Wicklund, 31, her 8-year-old daughter
Shannah and Barbara Hendrickson, 51.
   In a neatly printed brief submitted to the court Wednesday,
Campbell also asserted that ``death by hanging is so psychologically
distressing and frightening to petitioner that the fear of being
hung will force petitioner to violate his religious beliefs against
killing and suicide, ... forcing petitioner to actively take part in
his own demise in order to escape death by hanging.''
   Campbell's lead lawyer Al Lyon said late Thursday he will seek a
stay of execution from U.S. District Court in Seattle within the
next few days, seeking a stay of execution.
   At the time of the murders, Campbell was living at a work release
center, serving a sentence for assault and sodomy. Ms. Wicklund was
the victim in those crimes and testified against Campbell at the
earlier trial.

<HEAD>Japanese Reported Seized In South Korea In Business Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A South Korean company has seized a Japanese
machinery company president for the second time in four months in a
business dispute, and his whereabouts are unknown, his company said
Thursday.
   Koji Kohno of the Japanese company Osawa Press Seisakusho said
the firm has received 12 telephone facsimile messages from Namil
Machine Co. in South Korea requesting $3.8 million.
   He said recent messages declared that Osawa Press president Tokuo
Osawa had been beaten, and that one of his fingers would be cut off
and sent to back up demands for payment. The messages also
threatened Osawa's family, Kohno said.
   Japan has asked South Korean authorities to cooperate in the
case, Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said.
   While it was up to the two companies to settle their business
dispute, he said, ``this kind of illegal action should not accompany
a solution of the case.''
   Osawa Press exported six press machines to Namil last year for
about $837,000, and Osawa went to South Korea in December to offer
technial assistance after Namil complained that the machines were
defective, Kohno said.
   He said Osawa was confined in Namil's villa on Dec. 24 for three
to four days until Korean police and Japanese Embassy staff helped
win his release. Kohno said another Osawa Press employee and the
president of a Japanese trading company also were held three days in
the villa.
   Meanwhile, he said, Namil filed a complaint accusing Osawa of
fraud, and he was not allowed to leave the country. After he had
stayed two months in a hotel, Namil seized him again on Feb. 20 and
his whereabouts now are unknown, Kohno said.

   President Bush told U.S. manufacturers Thursday
he would work to keep international trade open but ``will not
confuse involvement with interference.''
   Speaking to a National Association of Manufacturers luncheon,
Bush praised industry's recent gains in productivity and exporting.
``Nobody is second-guessing American manufacturing any more. Clearly
you all are playing a winning game,'' he said.
   Bush was applauded vigorously when he said he would ``keep on
fighting'' for his proposal to reduce the capital-gains tax rate to
a maximum of 15 percent, about half the current top rate.
   The proposal, part of his fiscal 1990 budget package, has been
cooly received by the Democratic-controlled Congress.
   The president contends that lowering the tax on capital gains _
proceeds from the sale of stock, homes, buildings, real-estate and
other assets _ would spur new business investment and bring as much
as $4.8 billion in new tax revenue to the government for 1990.
   ``This is a case where less means more,'' Bush said.
   He said a lower capital-gains rate would enhance U.S.
competitiveness abroad.
   Bush told the manufacturers, ``Your presence here today
demonstrates that you are fighting to win the international struggle
for continued growth.''
   ``I'm not saying you're going to have to do it alone,'' he added.
``There is a role for government. Sometimes political leadership is
needed _ for example to keep international trade free and fair.
However, I will tell you that this government will not confuse
involvement with interference.''
   Bush sounded again the anti-drug theme he has been stressing in
recent speeches, saying drug and alchohol abuse are cutting into
business productivity.
   ``We're determined to keep drugs out of the workplace,'' Bush
said. He praised a recent Supreme Court ruling on drug-testing,
saying it would give his administration's anti-drug efforts ``a much
better chance of success.''
   The court on Tuesday upheld the constitutionality of drug testing
programs for law enforcement and public safety workers.
   ``Employers can teach their people to recognize the signs of
substance abuse in their co-workers _ and understand how drug abuse
hurts the non-users on the line,'' Bush said.
   Later in the day, the president went for a two-mile jog under
chilly, gray skies at Fort McNair, inviting two reporters and
Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater to join him and a
few aides for the 20-minute run.
   Still later, Bush and his wife Barbara went by motorcade to a
Chinese restaurant in nearby Falls Church, Va., where they dined
with press secretary Marlin Fitzwater and White House photographer
Carol Powers, Fitzwater's finance.
   After the meal, Bush walked around the restaurant shaking hands
with other diners and the entire restaurant erupted in applause.

   After sitting silently in a courtroom where he
is on trial on 12 Iran-Contra charges, former National Security
Council aide Oliver North returned to the lecture circuit Thursday
to tell a conservative audience that he is ``still very wary'' of
the reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``I may be a lonely voice, but I will urge all of you to watch
very closely what Mr. Gorbachev does,'' North told a dinner audience
at a conference sponsored by the World Media Association.
   North, who is charged with lying to Congress about his alleged
fund-raising for Nicaraguan Contras at a time support for the rebel
forces had been outlawed, said Gorbachev ``is continuing to arm
Nicaragua and Cuba to the point where America could well be forced
in the future to move forces from Europe and elsewhere around the
world to defend our own southern border.''
   In his trial in U.S. District Court here, North has mostly sat
silently and listened as witnesses give varying portrayals of his
conduct as a member of the National Security Council staff in the
Reagan White House.
   In his speech, he said he found himself ``out of work and in this
new venue, given a chance to speak without a subpoena.''
   He said in the past eight years ``freedom fighter movements ...
truly have raised up new aspirations for the freedom of millions''
in Nicaragua and elsewhere.
   As for Soviet reforms, he said, ``There has been no reduction,
but rather an increase in support for radical communist regimes like
that in Libya, in Cuba, Angola and Nicaragua.''
   ``Despite the vast publicity, I must tell you that I personally
am still very wary,'' North said. ``Today, inside the Soviet Union
it is in vogue to criticize former dictators, but not the current
dictator.''
   Earlier, black veterans of the civil rights movement, describing
themselves as conservatives, criticized news coverage of racial
issues, portraying the media as distractive or even hostile.
   James Meredith, who in 1961 was the first black student to enroll
in the University of Mississippi, said, ``A very small band of
conspirators bent on dominating world affairs have maneuvered and
swayed all the media in the Western Christian world.''
   ``This group, which I will refer to as the liberal elite, has
determined that the subjugation of the black race is critical to the
success of its scheme to control the world,'' Meredith said.
   Roy Innis, a director of the Committee on Racial Equality, said,
``The media has exhibited a schizoid and dichotomous behavior on
race relations in America and also in the rest of the world.''
   ``On one hand that behavior has at times in terms of race
relations has been beneficial, but at most times, in particular at
this time, it has been invidious,'' he said.
   Innis praised aspects of media coverage of the civil rights
movement in the 1960s, saying, ``Without the media friendly I don't
think much of the gains we made could have been made.''
   At the same time, he said, the media depicted whites in the South
as ``bad guys'' and those in the North as ``good guys'' and ignored
``the decency and commmitment for change that was being expressed by
many white Southerners in order to project this simplistic vision of
good guy, bad guy.''
   Jim Martin, identified as a a founding member of the Student
Non-violent Coordinating Committee, told the group, ``The media and
the civil rights movement and its leaders and organizations are in
fact allies ... in a war and that is the war ... to detract the
people from fundamental issues of justice, common sense and
political reality.''
   ``Now I am not going to attribute all of these sinister motives
to a cabal of media professionals and civil rights leaders,'' he
said. ``It's just a crazy coincidence of timing that goes back many,
many years.''
   James Bevell, a former strategist for the Rev. Martin Luther
King, however, suggested that unfavorable images of some black
political leaders in the news media are the fault of the blacks and
not the media.
   Responding to a question about coverage of District of Columbia
Mayor Marion Barry and other black political figures, Bevell said,
``There is not an elected black official in America today that has
constitutional consciousness.''
   ```The media is not attacking black people,'' he said. ``The
black guys are not qualified, and will not say to the white guys who
know constitutional principles, `I would like to serve as an
apprentice' ... and so they play like they know government.''
   John Nettles, national vice chairman of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, was moderator of the panel.
   The discussion took place at the 10th World Media Conference of
the World Media Association, sponsored by the Washington Times Corp.
and News World Communications Inc. The association, which describes
itself as an organization devoted to journalistic ethics, was
founded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon of the Unification Church.

<HEAD>Rogers to Give Up Command in Routine Change, Navy Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navy Capt. Will Rogers III will give up command
of the USS Vincennes in May, a change the Navy called routine and
unrelated to the possible terrorist bombing of a van driven by
Rogers' wife.
   ``This has been in the works for a long time,'' Navy spokesman
Cmdr. David Dillon said Thursday. Rogers became captain of the
guided missile cruiser in April 1987, and a command usually runs
about two years, Dillon said.
   The FBI is investigating whether the March 10 bombing of Sharon
Rogers' van was in retaliation for the Vincennes' mistaken
destruction of an Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf last July.
All 290 aboard the plane were killed.
   Mrs. Rogers has been in protected seclusion since the attack,
which left her uninjured. Rogers was in command when the Vincennes
left last week on a training mission off Southern California.
   The new commander of the Vincennes will be Capt. R.B. Lynch,
Dillon said. He said he didn't know what Rogers' next duty
assignment would be.
   However, The (San Diego) Tribune, citing an unidentified Navy
source, said Rogers would take command of a shore installation in
the Point Loma area of San Diego. Rogers is eligibile for promotion
to rear admiral, the source said.
   Meanwhile, it was reported that Mrs. Rogers, who lost her
teaching job at La Jolla Country Day school after the bombing, has
written parents of her former pupils to say she wasn't a security
risk.
   Officials at La Jolla Country Day School announced last week that
she was leaving her teaching job by mutual consent to ensure the
safety of the school's students.
   However, Mrs. Rogers, who says she was fired by the school,
stated in her letter that an in-depth investigation by federal
officials found that ``no evidence exists of a direct or implied
threat against me or the school,'' the Los Angeles Times and the
Tribune reported Thursday.
   That finding, Mrs. Rogers wrote, left her ``prepared to resume a
full classroom schedule'' until administrators notified her last
Thursday ``that my services had been terminated.''
   One school official told the Times that Mrs. Rogers was not
allowed to return to her fourth-grade classroom partly because
administrators feared parents would pull their children out of the
exclusive private school if she remained on the faculty.
   School spokesman Jim Stewart again maintained that Mrs. Rogers
was not fired. ``We're just not renewing her contract,'' he said
Wednesday. ``No matter what kind of furor she expresses, she's not
coming back. Period.''

   A woman accused of performing an
abortion on herself to get rid of her full-term fetus was arrested
for investigation of murder, police said Thursday.
   Margarita Gutierrez, 19, was booked at the San Bernardino Medical
Center jail ward, where she was listed in good condition Thursday
following her arrest at her home Wednesday, said Sgt. Dan Hernandez.
   ``She apparently intentionally aborted her child, resulting in
the death of the child,'' he said.
   The boy, whom police called ``baby Gutierrez,'' was taken to the
San Bernardino County Coroner's Office, where an autopsy was
scheduled for Friday.
   ``It will determine whether it was a stillborn delivery or an
aborted fetus,'' said Deputy Coroner Tom Dewhurst.
   The autopsy will also determine how old the fetus was. Sgt. Bob
Evans said police believe it was full-term.
   Ms. Gutierrez was arrested by San Bernardino police after they
were contacted by a doctor who alerted them to the woman. Evans said
authorities haven't yet determined a motive or how the delivery
occurred.

   The government is offering the new operator
of the Savannah River Plant a bonus of up to $6.25 million for
efficiently restarting the reactors at the nuclear weapons material
plant.
   Westinghouse Savannah River Co., which will assume control of the
Department of Energy plant from Du Pont on April 1, is assured of a
fee of $1.25 million for its first six months.
   The federal government will add a bonus based on a formula which
includes a safe restart, efficient production and safety
improvements, the Augusta Herald reported.
   The plant, in South Carolina across the Savannah River from
Augusta, has been shut down since last summer because of safety
concerns.
   Du Pont operated the plant under a non-profit arrangement. The
company, which gained nuclear expertise at the plant, was reimbursed
for its expenses and will receive a ``profit'' of $1 when it
relinquishes the contract April 1.

   Grocer Lee Arthur Lawrence's longtime battle against
drug trafficking in his neighborhood provoked vandalism against his
business and home, physical attacks, and finally, authorities
suspect, his slaying.
   Homicide detectives have been working round-the-clock since
Lawrence of West Perrine was killed Monday in a spray of up to 30
bullets in front of his grocery store, Lee's Grocery.
   ``He was a fine man,'' said Sandra Alvarez, a staff member of
Perrine's Community Action Agency, which had Lawrence on its board.
   ``The lack of his leadership will be felt for a long time,'' she
said. ``The entire community is in a state of shock.''
   Late last week, three days before the Monday killing, Metro-Dade
Police Director Fred Taylor met with Lawrence, ministers and other
concerned citizens to discuss how to squelch the rampant drug
problem in West Perrine, south of Miami.
   ``You don't know how bad I feel,'' Taylor said Wednesday. ``They
were going to assist us by identifying some of the individuals. We
just can't live in this kind of society.''
   Detectives Thursday were still looking for two men in their
mid-20s, but had made no arrests. They have yet to establish a
motive, but they believe Lawrence was slain by professional killers.
   His family and neighbors, however, said they think the murder was
arranged by drug dealers.
   Last week, Lawrence filed a complaint with police about a death
threat. A friend had told Lawrence that a drug dealer was
threatening to kill him.
   Taylor said a detective was investigating the threat, and
officers were told to patrol the store.
   ``We can't assign a policeman around the clock to stay with
somebody unless we have some specifics,'' Taylor said. ``I don't
know what we could have done.''
   Lawrence, 51, was widely known in the neighborhood for his
anti-drug stance, visiting schools and organizing residents to fight
against dealers.
   Two years ago, shots were fired into his home and homemade bombs
were tossed into his store. He also was the target of two attacks in
which gunmen fired on him as he entered his house.
   No one was arrested, but police say they suspected drug dealers.
   The night Lawrence died, two men in military camouflage clothes
were lurking around Lee's Grocery, said King Lewis, a witness in the
parking lot.
   Lawrence's daughter, Nita, said her father cooperated with
police, letting them know about suspicious activity, and she talked
of how he stood up to the area's drug dealers.
   ``He let them know they weren't welcome,'' she said.

   The wife of kidnapped British journalist
Alec Collett, U.N. officials and fellow journalists appealed
Thursday for information about the hostage on the fourth anniversary
of his abduction in Lebanon.
   A radical Moslem group has claimed that Collett was hanged in
April 1986 in retaliation for the U.S. bombing raid on Libya, and
released a videotape purportedly showing his body hanging from a
scaffold. His body was never found.
   Collett was abducted on March 25, 1985, while on assignment with
the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees. A group
linked to Palestinian terrorists claimed responsibility for his
abduction.
   ``We are heading into our fifth year,'' Collett's wife, Elaine,
said Thursday during a service held by the U.N. Correspondents'
Association. ``It must be several lifetimes for Alec. There seems to
be a lack of urgency concerning his whereabouts.
   ``Have any of his fellow journalists let him down? Search your
hearts for solutions to get Alec and his fellow hostages home.''
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said in a
statement that he and his senior staff were pursuing every
opportunity to obtain information about Collett.
   Walid Mourani, president of the U.N. Correspondents Association,
said his group was doing the same.
   Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing in
Lebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped on March
16, 1985.

   A film produced by former Beatle John Lennon is
making its debut nearly two decades after it captured Ann Arbor's
counter-culture during a huge 1971 rally to support a jailed
activist.
   Screenings of the film ``Ten for Two,'' have been held up by
Lennon's own reluctance to release it during his lifetime and by
uncertainty over who owns the rights.
   The movie documents a benefit concert held at the University of
Michigan's Crisler Arena for John Sinclair, a radical activist who
was serving a 10-year prison sentence for possession of two
marijuana cigarettes. He was released shortly after the December
1971 concert, having served 2{ years.
   Lennon, who faced his own problems with drug charges in the
United States, apparently was unwilling to release the film that
features radical speakers, folk protest songwriters and fellow rock
musicians such as Stevie Wonder and Bob Seger.
   ``This film was not released because of John Lennon's immigration
problems,'' the film's director, Steve Gephardt, said. ``The
immigration people said if you let this out, (Lennon) might as well
book a boat home.''
   Ownership rights of the film, which runs about 80 minutes, still
haven't been settled, but it will be shown anyway April 1 in Royal
Oak, a Detroit suburb, and April 2 in Ann Arbor.
   ``I don't think there's anything in writing anywhere'' about the
rights, said David Clements of MediaVision, a non-profit film
company based in Hazel Park that's putting on the two showings. He
said there are no current plans for other showings.
   The film apparently has been seen only rarely, at a handful of
private parties and a brief showing in England.
   Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, perform three songs in the film,
including one composition Lennon dedicated to Sinclair and one song
Ono said she wrote ``for the women of Ann Arbor.'' Lennon played an
acoustic guitar and Ono played a drum.
   Others appearing in the film are radicals Bobby Seale and Jerry
Rubin, as well as Wonder, Seger, folksinger Phil Ochs and the rock
group Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen.
   Clements said Ono has not responded to queries about the film.
``This is one of the ways to see if she'll cooperate positively to
get it (the film) into public hands,'' Clements said.
   Sinclair, who now edits the Detroit Council of Art's ``City Arts
Quarterly,'' said after seeing the film Wednesday that it depressed
him.
   ``The people you see in this movie are responsible for all the
changes we had during the 1960s and '70s,'' he said.
   Lennon died in 1980, shot to death near his New York City home by
a deranged admirer.
   At the time of Sinclair's arrest, possession of marijuana was a
felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. He was arrested at
age 25 in Detroit while living as a poet and revolutionary who
founded the White Panthers. He received the maximum sentence.
   Lobbying efforts to free Sinclair eventually paid off, even
before the concert was held. The day before the concert, the
Michigan Legislature voted to reduce the penalty for possession of
small amounts of marijuana to a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a
year in prison.
   Because he already had served 2{ years, Sinclair was released
from prison three days after the concert.

   Colombia's justice minister on Thursday shrugged off
U.S. charges against leaders of the infamous Medellin Cartel, saying
the country faced a much bigger crisis than pursuing reputed cocaine
kingpins.
   ``For the American government, drug trafficking is the biggest
problem,'' said Guillermo Plazas Alcid. ``For us, it is one of many,
including terrorism and subversion.''
   Thirty people, including reputed cartel leaders, were indicted in
Jacksonville on Wednesday, accused of smuggling $1 billion in
cocaine into the United State through the Bahamas and other points.
   Plazas, who had no visible security guards, told a luncheon
gathering of 130 members of the Colombian American Chamber of
Commerce that the South American nation was doing its best to
confront the drug issue, but extraditing cartel leaders for
prosecution in the United States was not an option.
   The extradition treaty between the two countries was invalidated
by Colombia's supreme court after the capture of cartel co-leader
Carlos Lehder Rivas, convicted last year and sentenced to life in
prison for cocaine trafficking to the United States.
   Since then, the extradition issue has been on hold. Asked what
effect Wednesday's sweeping drug-trafficking indictment might have,
Plazas simply replied, ``the extradition treaty can't be applied.''
   Among those indicted was Pablo Escobar Gaviria, an alleged leader
of the cartel accused of plotting the assassination of Colombian
Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla in 1984 and the 1986 slaying
of drug informant Barry Seal.
   Plazas discussed for nearly an hour the reform and strengthening
of Colombia's judicial system in response to drug trafficking,
guerrilla activity, common delinquency and the weakening of the
public and private sectors.
   ``If we are not at the edge of the abyss, then we're getting to
the point of almost no return,'' Plazas said. ``This is like a
gigantic nuclear mushroom cloud penetrating the whole society.''
   Plazas said Colombia, as a producing nation, should not bear sole
reponsibility for the drug problem and insisted it was a worldwide
issue that needed to be addressed on that scale.
   ``Colombia is not responsible for drug trafficking _ it is a
victim,'' he said. ``We are all victims.''
   He referred to the United State's swift reaction to tainted
Chilean fruit, saying this country had the power to respond with
equal vigor to drug trafficking.
   U.S. prosecutors said they were confident many of the 30
defendants named in the Jacksonville indictment would eventually
face prosecution. In addition to Escobar, the indictment _ charging
bribery, murder and conspiracy to import 44,000 pounds of cocaine _
named alleged cartel leaders Jose Rodriguez Gacha, Gonzalo Mejia and
brothers Jorge and Fabio Ochoa Vasquez.
   Also indicted was Everette Bannister, an associate of Bahamian
Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling, who was charged with receiving
bribes to protect cartel smuggling operations in the island nation.
   The Bahamian government Thursday issued a statement strongly
denying Pindling was in any way linked to drug traffickers.
   ``The legal difficulties (of) ... Bannister, a private Bahamian
citizen, have nothing to do with the government of the Bahamas, its
institutions or its people,'' said Margaret McDonald, the Bahamian
ambassador to the United States.
   Others indicted in the Jacksonville case were alleged pilots,
managers of cocaine operations and distributors of the drug.

   A federal court extended a ban Thursday on U.S.
Forest Service plans to sell nearly 1 billion board feet of ancient
timber from nine national forests in two states where the northern
spotted owl lives.
   Environmentalists hailed the ruling, but a timber industry lawyer
said it could mean the loss of 11,000 to 14,000 jobs in Washington
and Oregon.
   U.S. District Court Judge William S. Dwyer also set a trial for
June 13 on challenges by the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund and the
Washington Contract Loggers Association to the agency's spotted owl
management plans.
   Wildlife biologists are still trying to determine whether the
owl, which is believed to inhabit only ancient forests, is really
threatened with extinction.
   Roughly 2,400 owls are thought to inhabit the woods of the
Northwest.
   ``It's obvious that once the habitat is destroyed, it cannot be
replaced in any time frame that our generation can deal with,''
Dwyer said. ``That, of course, demonstrates a form of irreparable
harm.''
   If timber interests prevail at trial, ``the trees in question
have been growing for hundreds of years, and they will still be
available for logging,'' he added.
   But he said the prospects that the environmentalists would
prevail were ``sufficiently strong'' to justify a preliminary
injunction, in effect extending by 60 days a temporary restraining
order he issued Friday.
   ``Today's injunction is not just a victory for the ancient
forest-dependent spotted owl but is also important to the increasing
number of people in the recreation, tourism, retirement and fishing
industries whose future livelihood is tied in large part to the
ancient forests' protection,'' said Wendell Wood of the Oregon
Natural Resources Council.
   Mark Rutzick, a lawyer for the loggers, said the 60-day
injunction against sales would mean a one-year delay in actually
logging the more than 18,000 affected acres of spotted owl habitat,
roughly 29 square miles.
   The more than 900,000 board feet of timber to be logged from
those areas amounted to a one-year supply of logs for 20 to 30
mills, Rutzick said.
   Rutzick said that, because of the ruling, ``I think it is very
possible that 20 domestic sawmills in Washington and Oregon ... will
close within the next 12 months.''
   He said that would idle 3,000 to to 4,000 mill workers and 8,000
to 10,000 others in timber-dependent work ranging from shopkeepers
to gasoline station attendants.

   Iran's interior minister on Thursday
assured Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that ``the children of Islam''
will implement his decree and kill British writer Salman Rushdie.
   Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a radical and staunch follower of Khomeini,
spoke at a gathering at Khomeini's residence in the northern Tehran
suburb of Jamaran to mark the birthday of Imam Mahdi _ the so-called
``Hidden Imam'' who Shiite Moslems believe will return as an Islamic
messiah.
   The speech was broadcast on official Tehran Radio, monitored in
Nicosia.
   During the speech, crowds in the background could be heard
chanting: ``You are our soul Khomeini, you are the idol smasher
Khomeini,'' and slogans condemning the United States and Israel.
   Last month Khomeini urged Moslems in a fatwa, or religious edict,
to kill Rushdie for allegedly blaspheming Islam in his novel ``The
Satanic Verses.'' The novel includes a brothel scene in which
prostitutes take the name of Mohammed's wives and suggests that
Mohammed wrote the Koran instead of receiving it from God.
   The 41-year-old author has been in hiding since Khomeini's death
threat Feb. 14.
   ``The oppressors and global arrogance must know that the children
of Islam will carry out the sentence against those who have risen to
battle against Islam, and this mercenary agent will see the
consequences of his deed, and the execution order will be carried
out at the hands of the children of Islam,'' Mohtashemi said.
   Britain and its 11 partners in the Economic Community withdrew
their ambassadors from Tehran to protest Khomeini's death sentence.
Iran later severed relations with Britain, accusing Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher of conspiring against Islam.
   EEC nations agreed this week to allow each country to decide on
its own if it wanted to send its ambassador back to Iran. Britain,
however, said it will not restore relations with Iran until Khomeini
revokes the death sentence.

   Government reluctance to make public an air
terrorism threat in Europe is bringing new calls from relatives of
the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing victims for disclosure of all serious
threats against commercial aviation.
   White House, State Department and Transportation Department
officials all attempted on Thursday to downplay the hijacking threat
against U.S. airlines in Western Europe. Still, some officials,
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner in particular, expressed
anger that it was released to the public in leaks to British news
media.
   But several relatives of victims of the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 over Scotland said they believe the way the government
handles terrorism bulletins warns diplomatic and military personnel
while keeping other potential passengers uninformed about risks.
   British investigators have concluded that a terrorist bomb
concealed in a radio-cassette player blew up the Boeing 747 over
Scotland, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 others on the ground
in Lockerbie, Scotland.

   Scores of pilgrims, carrying crosses and guarded
by hundreds of Israeli forces, made their way along the Via Dolorosa
on Good Friday to mark Christ's path to crucifixion.
   More than two hours before the official procession, pilgrims in
small groups with priests prayed and chanted today at the stations
of the cross, heading toward the site of Christ's death at the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
   Among the early pilgrims, who mixed with Palestinian shoppers,
were Germans and Italians. Two German men carried a 4-foot-long
wooden cross.
   Because of the 15-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation of the territories, hundreds of police, border police and
soldiers were on duty along the narrow, cobbled street in
Jerusalem's Old City.

   Fresh Chilean grapes are being trucked across
the country today after a two-week absence from store shelves
because of a cyanide poisoning scare, industry leaders say.
   Consumers may see slightly higher prices on the produce
initially, but prices are expected to drop back to pre-scare levels
in a couple of weeks when supply catches up with demand, they said.
   Losses to Chilean exporters and to U.S. fruit importers as a
result of the cyanide scare over grapes and other produce are
estimated at $240 million, Ronald S. Bown, executive director of the
Chilean Exporters Association, said Thursday.
   Some of those losses may be offset by a plan being developed by
the Chilean government to compensate U.S. importers, wholesalers and
retailers as well as Chilean growers and exporters, Bown said.

   A man with an insatiable appetite for

rape and terror, authorities said.
   Eugene Thompson Jr., 20, of Littleton, was armed with a MAC-11

early Thursday and began his crime spree.
   The rampage, during which he raped two women, ended in a

him.
   Thompson opened fire on the two officers who burst into the
townhouse, hitting one in the chest and neck and the other in the

   From street vendors in Bangkok, you can
buy:
   _ For $6, an expertly stitched, longsleeved cotton shirt bearing
the polo rider logo of designer Ralph Lauren.
   _ For $1, Anita Baker's recent ``Giving You the Best I Got''
album on an audio cassette.
   _ For $8, a Hollywood movie on video cassette _ titles ranging
from ``Casablanca'' to ``Rain Man.''
   _ For $33, the latest computer software, such as the popular
DBase IV program.
   Total bill for one of each: $48; in New York: as much as $783.
   The items in New York would be genuine. In Bangkok, they're
counterfeits, the result of wholesale piracy of foreign intellectual
property, including patents, copyrights and trademarks.
   Thailand is by no means alone. Outright counterfeits and various
shades of imitations are churned out in many countries, including
the United States, depriving creators and legitimate businesses of
what the Geneva-based World Economic Form estimates is $70 billion a
year.
   But Thailand lately has been in Washington's unwanted spotlight
because other Asian governments are more effectively cracking down
on counterfeiters in Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea
and Taiwan.
   Although Japan and West European countries are also unhappy about
violations of intellectual property rights, Washington has taken the
toughest action.
   In January the U.S. government began to deny duty free benefits
on about $165 million worth of Thai imports to the United States.
Thailand faces further, more serious penalties under provisions of
the U.S. Trade Act if improvements aren't forthcoming.
   The issue is economically important to both countries.
   The United States is Thailand's most important export market; the
Thais last year had a $1.4 billion trade surplus on exports worth
$3.4 billion to the United States. Serious retaliatory measures by
Washington could hurt the vibrant Thai economy.
   The United States in turn is trying to cope with massive trade
deficits; U.S. officials say billions of revenue dollars are lost
yearly to the piracy of American intellectual property worldwide.
   ``The United States is in turbulent economic times and forced to
take stronger stands on economic issues. That surprises allies like
Thailand,'' said Joseph E. Hart, president of the American Chamber
of Commerce in Bangkok. ``Some Thais understand this but others see
it as America bullying an old friend.''
   Both sides generally agree that with the exception of
pharmaceutical products and computer software, Thai laws now offer
considerable protection.
   But U.S. officials and businessmen charge that enforcement of
these laws is poor and penalties for violations are minimal. For
example, one shopowner found guilty of selling wallets and luggage
labeled as Louis Vuitton in January was fined $40.
   On Silom Road, the main business thoroughfare, products of
Thailand's low wage, highly skilled pirates are on open display in
sidewalk stalls.
   The merchandise includes often superb imitations of Gucci
handbags, Levi jeans and children's clothing adorned with Walt
Disney's Mickey Mouse and other trademark cartoon characters.
   A handsomely faked Rolex watch, the ``Submariner'' model, sells
for about $35 as compared to more than $1,200 for a genuine model.
   The issue has sparked debate in Parliament and the press with
opponents of protection arguing that countries such as Thailand can
ill afford to pay standard world market prices for such vital tools
for development as computer software, medicine and textbooks.
   The extreme anti-protection view was mirrored in a newspaper
article attributed to a university professor who otherwise was left
unidentified:
   ``Mozart, Beethoven and Tchaikovsky did not care what would
happen to their works and did not guard them covetously and
selfishly. Newton did not sell his apple theory.''
   But other Thais are concerned about piracy.
   ``I think the fact that we are joining the (economic) big leagues
means we have to pay more attention to intellectual property
rights,'' Parliament member Surin Pitsuwan said in an interview.
``Protection contributes to a safe and secure atmosphere for
investment, research and technology transfer.''
   Hart of the Chamber of Commerce noted that big, legitimate Thai
businesses recently have begun to speak up for protection,
indicating they don't want Thailand's booming export trade battered
by U.S. retaliation for the sake of a few counterfeiters.
   Surin stressed the need for an information campaign to get the
public to understand the long-term benefits of offering protection
to intellectual property.
   ``But it's difficult when the market forces are so strong,'' he
said. ``How can we stop it easily when the first thing visiting U.S.
congressmen do after the formal agenda is to go out and buy as many
alligator-label shirts as they can get?''

   From Senegal to Sicily and Morocco to Malaysia,
throngs of agitated people have besieged U.S. embassies and
consulates in recent weeks _ not in anger, but in eagerness.
   People anxious to gain information about a new program that will
grant 20,000 immigrant visas into the United States in 1991 and 1992
have kept embassy telephones ringing off the hook and snarled
embassy entry ways.
   _ In Cairo, the embassy was forced to shut down its entire
complex and call the local police recently to deal with a crowd of
2,000 people demanding details.
   _ In Bucharest, Romania, people began forming lines at 6 a.m.,
and police finally organized the crowds into groups of 20 persons
for entry into the embassy.
   The rush was touched off late last month when the State
Department announced that citizens from 162 countries will be
eligible for the special visa lottery. Some 20,000 entrants will be
chosen at random by computer, and applicants only have until Friday
to apply.
   Normally, immigrants have to prove they have a close relative in
the United States or a scarce profession in order to enter the
country, said Frances Jones, an official with the State Department's
Consular Affairs office.
   The enthusiastic response is understandable, she says, because
``suddenly, there's an opportunity for anyone to come'' to the
United States _ but only if they meet the other basic requirements
as well, such as good health and no criminal contacts.
   The last lottery, a more restrictive program in 1986, brought
10,000 people into the country; 1.4 million applicants lost out.
   Rep. Howard L. Berman, D-Calif., the prime sponsor of the law
that established the program, said it was designed to ``encourage
diversity'' in the nation's immigration program ``and to give
opportunity to those who have no family contacts to come to
America.''
   ``Immigration is good for America. It is a tremendous source of
economic innovation and growth,'' Berman said.
   It appears there will be no problem attracting applicants. Within
hours of the announcement, U.S. posts abroad were nearly under siege.
   ``The Marine on (weekend) duty in Kuala Lumpur was among the
first to feel the enthusiastic response _ he spent his shift
informing callers they'd have to wait until Monday morning for
information,'' Ms. Jones said the Malaysian embassy reported.
   In the first week, the embassy handed out more than 3,000
information sheets about the program and handled more than 1,000
phone calls. In desperation, the embassy installed a five-minute
telephone recording with information that logged about 100 calls a
day.
   Elsewhere around the world, Ms. Jones said embassies reported
similar situations:
   In Dakar, Senegal, a special telephone hotline was set up, and
the telephone ``has never stopped ringing,'' the embassy reported.
   In Rabat, Morocco, embassy officials put information on bulletin
boards so people waiting in lines could obtain background about the
program. But that didn't stop others from waiting in long lines,
trying to get help with their applications. In Casablanca, the post
handed out 5,000 information sheets in three days.
   In Amman, Jordan, the switchboard operator fielded ``thousands of
calls'' in the days after the program was announced.
   In Dacca, Bangladesh, the embassy reported interest from ``all
segments of society _ from university professors to rickshaw
drivers,'' along with heavy demand for information.
   But the fact that no application form was available appeared to
confuse some, as well as the request that the information required,
such as name, residence and address, be typed ``in the Roman
alphabet'' on a sheet of paper.
   ``More than one application arrived using Roman numerals,'' the
embassy reported.
   The embassy in Dublin, Ireland, reported an ``extraordinary
response'' that ``increased the workload of an already
hard-pressed'' consular unit.
   From the embassy in Suva, Fiji, officials reported being
``besieged'' with telephone calls, requests for information and
letters. More than 1,000 information sheets were handed out.
   ``Tongans, Rotumans, Vanuatuans and others in the South Pacific
are eager to participate,'' in the program, the embassy reported.
Tonga and Vanuatu are independent nations, while Rotuma is an island
grouping that is part of Fiji.
   In contrast, however, the residents of northern Italy and Denmark
seem uninterested in moving to the United States.
   The post in Copenhagen said the announcement did not attract
media attention ``or evoke any great public interest.''
   And even though some 162 requests came to the post in Palermo,
Sicily, ``no inquiries'' were received in the first weeks of the
program in Genoa, Milan, and Rome, Ms. Jones reported.

   Some doctors have taken on a new partner: a quest
for profit that influences the way they treat their patients. Among
those criticized for an overriding emphasis on the financial bottom
line are some of the walk-in clinics that have sprouted around the
nation, offering treatment at any hour without an appointment and
earning revenues in the billions of dollars. In this first article
in a continuing series, ``The Business of Medicine,'' Science Writer
Daniel Q. Haney and National Writer Fred Bayles look at allegations
that these clinics sometimes do unnecessary tests to pile up profits.

   Each month, doctors at many of the nation's 4,000
walk-in clinics receive report cards from their employers. Instead
of rating the quality of their care, these printouts rank the size
of their bills.
   To some health experts and doctors in the $2.5-billion-a-year
walk-in industry, these ``productivity sheets'' are just one example
of the lures and prods used by many storefront clinics to raise
profits through unnecessary charges.
   Doctors complain they are enticed with bonuses, inspired with pep
talks, chastened with reprimands and even threatened with dismissal,
all to keep them churning out lucrative but questionable X-rays,
tests and prescriptions to raise patients' bills.
   ``You could see people walk in with a simple head cold. The
doctors would order a chest X-ray, sinus X-ray, a few lab tests, and
pretty soon you've turned a head cold into a $150 extravaganza,''
recalled Dr. Anthony G. Bruzzese of his days at a Rhode Island
clinic.
   Dr. Arthur H. Herold of the University of South Florida, who
resigned from a walk-in chain, explained how some doctors try to
justify extraneous tests: ``If you can order a battery of tests and
do X-rays, patients think they've gotten good medicine _ and you've
made more money off of them.''
   Some say the often-anonymous brand of medicine practiced by the
so-called ``doc-in-the-box'' clinics _ no-appointment-needed,
no-medical-history-known _ leads to overuse of testing to reassure
patients and protect doctors from malpractice claims.
   ``You don't get sued for taking an X-ray. You get sued for not
taking it,'' said Dr. Robert Gordon, a partner in four New England
walk-in clinics.
   Clinic executives deny they encourage needless tests. One study
backs them up, though a medical authority says the survey didn't
check the right tests.
   Over the past decade walk-in clinics, mostly owned by individual
doctors, small local chains or hospitals, have sprung up on Main
Streets and in shopping malls across the country. Open at night and
on weekends, they recorded 50 million patient visits last year,
earning an estimated $2.5 billion.
   ``We have all heard anecdotal stories about clinics that put the
dollar sign ahead of the patient,'' said Dr. John J. Ring, chairman
of the board of the American Medical Association. ``It's very
definitely unethical to order or charge for a test or procedure that
the physician knows is unnecessary.''
   Clinic officials say productivity sheets and other inducements
simply remind payroll doctors that medicine is a business as well as
a profession.
   ``People find it hard to believe that doctors work on a
percentage, but that's the way it works in the emergency room and
private practices,'' said Dr. Stephen Dickey, owner of the Doctor's
Walk-In Clinic chain in the Tampa, Fla., area.
   Many doctors like walk-in medicine because they can practice the
way they want. They side with Dr. Martin Iser, who works at a
Weymouth, Mass., branch of Health Stop, the nation's biggest chain
with 112 clinics in Boston, Chicago, Atlanta and St. Louis.
   ``I've never felt any pressure by the company to order tests that
would be considered medically unnecessary,'' Iser said.
   Nonetheless, internal documents from Health Stop demonstrate the
company's emphasis on testing levels.
   One memo from the director of operations asked nurses to help
prevent ``underutilization of ancillaries,'' meaning diagnostic
procedures. It said they should ``obtain ... the necessary lab and
X-ray tests'' before the doctors see the patients. Doctors reluctant
to allow this were to be reported.
   Another memo, which began by noting that average revenue per
patient had dropped, urged nursing supervisors to keep patient
waiting time to a minimum, to give patients followup appointments
and to be ``more aggressive'' assisting doctors with billings.
   ``Offer suggestions regarding routine medical protocols for lab
and X-ray utilization at Health Stop,'' it said.
   Health Stop doctors are paid about $35 an hour or 21 percent of
their gross charges, whichever is higher. Many clinics offer doctors
a percentage of everything they bring in.
   At Health Stop and Doctors Walk-In, the doctors are sent monthly
computer printouts ranking them according to their average fees per
patient.
   The monthly report ``shows that if you wanted to make more money,
you could. There are definitely some doctors who order more tests
because of it,'' said Dr. Michelle Maffeo, a Boston-area Health Stop
physician who also said she herself was never pressured.
   ``There is always in the back of your mind the realization that
the more tests you order, the more finances you can generate for
yourself,'' said Dr. Andrew Garlisi of Tampa, a former Doctors
Walk-In physician. ``It wasn't the primary motivating factor, but as
human beings it's hard to ignore.''
   Dickey, owner of Doctor's Walk-In, denied the firm encouraged
physicians to run up the bill. ``I want them to treat patients
appropriately,'' he said. ``We are just trying to practice basic
medicine, to take care of sick people in a humane way.''
   A productivity sheet from Doctors Walk-In showed the top-ranked
physician charged $58 per patient. The last-place doctor had average
charges of $31. These sheets also showed how many patients the
doctors saw per hour and the total value of medicines their patients
bought at the clinic.
   A Health Stop monthly report from 1987 showed the average number
of X-rays, tests and procedures per patient for each doctor. The
doctors' total bills ranged on average from $76 to $44. The chain's
average was $62.
   The physician with the lowest charges was Dr. Thomas McGrath, one
of two Health Stop doctors who assert they were fired in 1987 for
doing too few tests and X-rays. Neither doctor had written proof of
this.
   McGrath, now a physician at the University of Connecticut student
infirmary, said he rarely used diagnostic machines.
   ``If somebody came in with a sore throat, they didn't need a
blood count. They (Health Stop officials) wanted routine tests done
for routine problems,'' he said.
   The other dismissed doctor was Randall S. Bock, who now operates
his own walk-in clinic in Revere, Mass. He said he resisted ordering
tests when his stethoscope and a physical exam provided all the
information he needed.

   While owners of walk-in medical chains deny pumping up patient
charges, some former employees assert they were pressured and
enticed to inflate the bills.
   Among the most frequently cited examples:
   _ Some chains encourage doctors to routinely perform simple
diagnostic tests, such as strep screens on all people with sore
throats, when there is little indication patients have diseases they
are being tested for. The tests typically cost about $20.
   _ Chest X-rays to check for pneumonia are routinely given to
people with coughs and bronchitis, even though most have simple
colds. Costs vary across the country but are often in the $50 range.
   _ Many chains give doctors bonuses for amassing big patient
bills. One doctor said his chain gave physicians 40 percent of every
bill that went over $60.
   _ Doctors are often encouraged to prescribe antibiotics to
patients who don't need them, so customers will feel they have
gotten their money's worth. When the clinics sell the drugs they
also prescribe, this of course further raises profits. At one
walk-in chain, one of every four patients bought medicines and paid
an average of $8.60 per prescription.

<HEAD>Takeover Brawlers Back in the Spotlight Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid outfoxed Shamrock, Perelman took
Coleman, Pennwalt escaped Centaur, Salomon Brothers and Kelly
cornered Envirodyne, Black &amp; Decker rescued Emhart and Bass spooked
Time.
   The spree of corporate takeover maneuvering sounded like a
financial clone of college basketball's March Madness and was about
the only thing that captivated Wall Street's attention this past
week _ besides brokers' bets on the nationally televised NCAA
tournament.
   One notable element of the latest merger deals was their
staccato pace. Three were announced the same day, resurrecting
memories of the frenzy of huge deals that had become almost routine
in the past few years but _ until now _ seemed to have waned in
1989.
   Stock speculators and others who follow buyouts said the rash of
announcements was more than coincidence.
   For one thing, more than five months have elapsed since the
granddaddy $24.53 billion RJR Nabisco Inc. takeover brawl, which
chilled many other deals, rumored and real.
   That megadeal raised fears that Congress would crack down on one
of investment banking's most lucrative businesses, partly because
of the enormous amount of debt used to finance many mergers and
because of questions over how it could be repaid.
   The RJR deal now has been digested, with little outwardly
dramatic impact. In addition, Washington lawmakers appear unwilling
or unable to more tightly regulate or constrict takeovers.
   Moreover, rising interest rates appear to be playing a role by
convincing some takeover investors to make their move now before
the cost of credit gets too expensive.
   But perhaps the most significant takeover news of the week was
the evident success of an antitakeover strategy.
   Instant camera giant Polaroid Corp., hounded for months by the
Shamrock Holdings Inc. investment concern, won a court battle
upholding the legitimacy of a stock repurchase that seemed to
squelch Shamrock's $3.2 billion bid. Shamrock declined to admit
defeat but planned to sell its Polaroid stock.
   In another successful escape, chemical concern Pennwalt Corp.
embraced a friendly $1.05 billion acquisition by France's Societe
Nationale Elf Aquitaine, foiling an unwanted takeover by the
Centaur Partners investment concern.
   Centaur dropped its bid but still walks away with big profits, a
demonstration that even in failure in the takeover business there's
success: it paid about $60-a-share for a stake in Pennwalt and can
sell out to Elf Aquitaine for $132 a share.
   A third corporate rescue concerned Emhart Corp., target of an
unwanted takeover threat from the investment partnership Topper
L.P. Toolmaker Black &amp; Decker Corp. agreed to buy Emhart for $2.8
billion, but Topper sought to stop the deal in court.
   Elsewhere, billionaire takeover investor Ronald Perelman decided
to add camping gear to his collection of perfume, licorice extract
and savings and loan businesses. Wichita, Kan.-based Coleman Co.
accepted a $545 million buyout offer from MacAndrews &amp; Forbes
Holdings Inc., which is controlled by Perelman, and spurned a rival
management-led offer.
   Another savvy takeover strategist, Donald Kelly, teamed with
Salomon Inc. to acquire plastics maker Envirodyne Industries Inc.
for $736 million. It marked Kelly's first takeover foray since he
helped investment concern Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. acquire
Beatrice Cos. three years ago.
   In the rumor realm, word leaked that billionaire investor Robert
Bass had purchased stock in Time Inc. with the possible aim of
buying the publishing giant. Stock in Time, which earlier this
month agreed to merge with Warner Communications partly as an
antitakeover move, soared on the Bass story.
   Finally, one friendly deal turned sour.
   Manhattan developer Donald Trump demanded at least a third off
the $365 million price he had agreed to pay for the Eastern
Airlines shuttle because the carrier has since been crippled by a
strike and has sought refuge in bankruptcy court. In response,
Eastern made the shuttle available to all bidders.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _A jury convicted an assistant bond trader at Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. of perjury and other charges, making her the first
employee of the securities firm to be found guilty as a result of a
massive federal fraud inquiry. Another jury deadlocked in
deliberating stock manipulation charges against GAF Corp. and a top
company officer, resulting in the second mistrial in that case.
   _One week after news about inflation frightened the financial
markets, new evidence emerged that the economy is slowing. The
government said durable goods orders fell in February, the second
straight monthly drop, consumer prices rose only moderately and
more Americans diverted their income into savings. The Big Three
automakers, meanwhile, reported soft sales for mid-March.
   _The House passed a minimum wage bill, raising the prospect of a
$1.10-an-hour rise in compensation for the nation's lowest paid
workers. The passage came during the same week a House panel
released report that showed a widening gap between rich and poor
from 1973 through 1987.

<HEAD>Eastern Bankruptcy Judge to Appoint Examiner with Broad Powers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Embattled Eastern Airlines has been granted its
request for a court-appointed examiner in its bankruptcy
proceedings, but the airline appears to be getting a more powerful
examiner than it wanted.
   In a surprising ruling Thursday, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge
Burton Lifland said he would appoint an examiner with unusually
broad powers to oversee strike-bound Eastern during its Chapter 11
reorganization.
   Lifland granted Eastern's request that an examiner be appointed
to review all transactions between Miami-based Eastern and
affiliated airlines. But he decided to give the examiner a broader
mandate than requested by the airline, saying it was in the public's
interest to do so.
   Among other things, the as-yet unnamed examiner would mediate
differences among Eastern employees, creditors and other parties to
achieve a consensus on a bankruptcy reorganization plan, Lifland
said. He described that role as ``banging heads together by an
independent entity.''
   The judge also refused a union request to order Eastern to
release about $24 million in pre-strike paychecks and benefits
frozen when the airline sought protection from creditors on March 9,
five days after the beginning of a strike by its machinists union.
   Eastern's pilots and flight attendants have refused to cross the
machininists' picket lines.
   The unions have asked the bankruptcy court to appoint a trustee
who actually would run the airline during its reorganization,
bumping Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo from that function.
   An April 7 hearing has been scheduled on the trustee request. But
an attorney for the Air Line Pilots Association indicated the union
might be willing to drop the request, because the powers of the new
examiner would be so sweeping.
   ``It's rather an extraordinary appointment,'' Bruce Simon, who
represented ALPA during Thursday's hearing, told reporters outside
the courtroom. He described the new examiner to be appointed by the
judge as a ``super-mediator'' and a ``super-examiner.''
   Simon said he would be prepared to examine the trustee issue with
Harvey Miller, Eastern's lead bankruptcy attorney. ``We'll look at
the order; we'll make a judgment,'' he said.
   Another participant in the hearing, who asked not to be
identified, also said the scope of the new examiner's mandate was
virtually unprecedented in a bankruptcy proceeding.
   ``We're extremely pleased with the ruling today,'' Eastern
President Phil Bakes said in an interview. ``We wish we had thought
of it,'' he said, referring to the judge's broadening of the
examiner's functions.
   Eastern has said it made the request for an examiner to dispel
arguments by its unions that transactions between Eastern, its
parent Texas Air and its affiliiated acarrier Continental Airlines
were not made in the company's best interests.
   Eastern's unions claim Texas Air has been stripping the airline
of its assets while trying to bolster Continental.
   ``What I'm hearing is a reflection of parochial interests; what
I'm not hearing is the public interest here,'' Lifland told Miller
and Simon after their presentations in front of a packed courtroom.
``The sooner we get into the gut issues here, the better off we
are.''
   Regarding the request to free the paychecks, Lifland said such a
move would be of ``no demonstrable benefit'' to Eastern's estate and
would consume about 10 percent of the company's cash on hand.
   Simon acknowledged that Lifland's decision on the checks was a
setback to Eastern's employees.

<HEAD>Car, Truck Sales Up 5 Percent in Mid-March</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Auto Sales-Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Car and light truck sales rose 5 percent in
mid-March, but an industry analyst said the improvement doesn't
indicate a turnaround in a slow sales start for 1989.
   The eight U.S.-based auto companies reported Thursday that
vehicles they made sold at an average daily rate of 39,225 during
the March 11-20 period this year, compared with a 37,344-per-day
rate during the same time last year.
   But that didn't impress analyst Ron Glantz of Montgomery
Securities Inc. of San Francisco.
   ``It's very disappointing when you consider that the industry
made the incentives more generous,'' he said.
   During early March, the Big Three automakers, which accounted for
90.3 percent of all the cars sold by the eight companies during the
second 10-day selling period of the month, boosted or extended
existing incentives.
   In mid-March last year, similar incentives were in place.
   ``What I think is happening is that consumers are reacting to
increased interest rates, not automobile rates, though,'' Glantz
said, adding that holders of adjustable rate mortgages may have
recently received notice of higher payments because of increases in
lending rates nationwide.
   Another analyst, Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. of New York,
was more bullish on the industry.
   ``I think a lot of people have been shopping, just kind of
looking for what to buy,'' Brady said. ``Why buy when there's a
chance of snow or rotten weather? Get past Easter Sunday and you
should see sales smooth out at a higher level.''
   ``All you're seeing is that the market is being jerked back and
forth by incentives or lack thereof,'' he said.
   Mid-March sales were bolstered by light trucks, which were
leaving dealer lots in numbers 8.9 percent higher than last year.
Car sales went up 2.8 percent compared with the same period last
year.
   Automakers have been looking for a sales resurgence in March and
April after a sluggish start early this year. Typically, U.S.
consumers head to automobile showrooms during the early spring to
get ready for summertime driving.
   For the year, cars and light trucks are selling at a pace 5.4
percent behind last year's tempo. The automakers sold an average of
34,475 vehicles a day through March 20 this year, compared with a
daily rate of 36,451 during the same period last year.
   Car sales were off 8.2 percent and truck sales were 0.3 percent
lower so far this year than they were during the Jan. 1-March 20
period last year.
   Chrysler Corp. said it sold 16.2 percent fewer cars during
mid-March this year compared with last year, with sales averaging
3,228 a day this year, compared with a 3,850 car-a-day clip last
year.
   Ford Motor Co.'s mid-March car sales were up 6.1 percent this
year and General Motors Corp.'s were 0.2 percent ahead of last
year's sales rate.
   Year-to-date car sales for each of the Big Three were running
behind last year's pace, with Chrysler down 20.7 percent, GM 12.7
percent lower and Ford off 2.1 percent.
   It was a different story for the Big Three on the truck side, as
Ford showed a 10.6 percent increase, Chrysler was up 6.7 percent and
GM's truck sales were 5.5 percent higher in mid-March this year
compared with the same period last year.

   Here are sales results for the eight major U.S.
automakers for second period of March 1989.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals. There
were eight selling days in the period this year and eight selling
days last year.
   For the first two sales periods of the month, there were 17
selling days this year and 17 selling days last year, and for the
year so far, 66 selling days this year and 67 selling days last year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and appear in
this table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and Chrysler
names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and trucks are
reported at the end of each month.

<HEAD>Big Name Chocolate Makers Taking Bigger Bite Of Easter Markets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major chocolate companies moving into the
Easter specialty candy market are getting a sweet reward in the form
of higher sales.
   The National Confectioners Association is projecting a 2 percent
increase in sales of Easter chocolate and candy this year, up to
$815 million.
   ``Seasonal chocolates are really big business,'' said Joan
Steuer, president of Chocolate Marketing of Los Angeles. ``There are
predictions that the market will top out _ how much more chocolate
can people take? _ but I believe that there's a world of
opportunity.''
   While seasonal confections were once supplied mostly by specialty
makers of chocolate bunnies and marshmallow eggs, candy giants such
as Hershey Foods Corp. and M&amp;M-Mars are trying to get a bigger bite
of the profitable Easter candy market with holiday versions of their
regular products.
   Hershey has packaged its chocolate Kisses in Easter _ and
Christmas _ colors for years. Its recent acquisition of Cadbury's,
which makes several popular chocolate Easter egg items, will
increase its seasonal sales considerably, company spokesman Carl
Andrews said.
   ``The company found that there's quite a market for special
packaging for existing products,'' said analyst R. Bentley Offutt of
Offutt Securities Inc. in Maryland.
   ``I can't tell you exactly what the incremental gain in sales has
been, but I do think it has surpassed their expectations by a large
margin,'' he said.
   Mars, which together with Hershey controls most of the chocolate
market, introduced red and green M&amp;M type candies at Christmas three
years ago, and last year added pastel versions at Easter.
   ``The sales results were very, very successful,'' said Mars
spokesman Hans Fiuczynski. ``The seasonal market certainly has been
growing.''
   Analysts and industry specialists said the chocolate giants'
foray into the holiday market is not hurting the smaller, specialty
confectioners.
   ``The big guys are starting to pay attention to the season,''
said Jan Kitt, associate publisher of The Confection magazine, based
in Orlando, Fla.
   ``It's healthy for the market and provides a greater choice. But
I don't believe it's taking sales away from the traditional sellers.
It's expanded the market.''
   The specialty producers have been expanding their sales at the
same time as the mass marketers, Ms. Steuer said.
   ``A lot of the importers are going to mass marketing outlets,''
she said. ``The mass companies are going upscale and the upscale
companies are going into mass marketing.''
   There is plenty of room for both in the Easter market, Ms. Steuer
said.
   ``It's really a matter of incremental business and expanding the
market,'' she said. ``I don't think anyone is pushing anybody out.''
   ``We're going back to more traditional thinking in terms of
holidays,'' said Dick O'Connell, president of the Chocolate
Manufacturers Association, based in McLean, Va. ``More attention is
being paid to chocolate bunnies and fancy Easter eggs and jelly
beans _ all the things that go with Easter.
   ``Easter's been doing very well.''

<HEAD>Delaware Court Frees Polaroid to Buy Back Shares</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a Delaware Supreme Court removed all obstacles
to Polaroid Corp.'s buyback of 16 million shares of its common
stock, it apparently dealt a fatal blow to Shamrock Holdings Inc.'s
8-month-old takeover attempt.
   The court on Thursday rejected Shamrock's request for an
extension of a one-week injunction against the buyback plan, an
effort by the instant camera giant to stymie Shamrock's $3.2 billion
takeover bid.
   In response, Shamrock and its affiliates announced plans to
tender to Polaroid all 4.96 million Polaroid shares purchased during
the takeover effort.
   But Michael Sitrick, spokesman for the Burbank, Calif.-based
company, refused to say whether Shamrock would abandon its bid for
Polaroid.
   Earlier this week, another Shamrock spokesman said the company
would not give up its battle for Polaroid even if the court ruled in
favor of the buyback.
   ``It would seem they're on the verge of giving up,'' said Eugene
Glazer, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in New York.
   ``It's somewhat of a fatal shot, almost a shot right to the head
of Shamrock,'' said Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities in New York. ``Their (Shamrock's sell-back) plan is
symbolically the same thing as throwing in the towel.''
   However, Henderson said, Shamrock is ``unlikely to go away'' and
may still stage a proxy fight although, as a result of the buyback
plan and individual stock ownership, Polaroid will own enough shares
to stop Shamrock.
   Shamrock, controlled by the family of Roy E. Disney, nephew of
the late Walt Disney, planned to wage a proxy fight for control of
Polaroid's board of directors at its as-yet unscheduled annual
meeting.
   ``They could continue to pursue'' a bid, said Glazer, ``but with
those defenses seeming so strong and supported by the Delaware
courts, their ability to get 50 percent of the shares to vote for
them seems very remote.''
   Glazer said the court's endorsement of Polaroid's actions to ward
off a takeover could send a signal to other Delaware-based companies
that defensive strategies will be backed.
   Polaroid has been resisting Shamrock's takeover attempt since

<BYLINE>IBM Denies Slowdown In High Tech Industry</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Top executives of International Business Machines
Corp. tried to allay fears of a high technology slowdown and its
impact on the economy, concerns raised when earnings forecasts were
cut for ``Big Blue'' and Digital Equipment Corp., the nation's
largest computer makers.
   During a meeting of securities analysts Thursday in Boston, the
men who run IBM predicted strong worldwide growth in demand for
computers despite a cooling domestic market.
   They promised to deliver ``kinder, gentler'' computers in the
short term, predicting it would be easier for individuals and more
efficient for companies to use.
   In the long term, they said businesses would find more and more
uses for computers, demanding ever larger amounts of memory capacity
for ``paperless offices'' in which products would be designed
entirely on computers.
   ``Far less than 2 percent of the data that mankind has generated
is coded and stored in any kind of a computer format ... so there is
still tremendous potential for growth,'' said Carl Conti, an IBM
senior vice president.
   IBM Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John F. Akers predicted
the computer industry would continue to grow at two to three times
the rate of the world's economy as a whole.
   But Akers said in an interview after his speech to the 150
analysts that the U.S. budget deficit is a wild card that could
change IBM's hand.
   ``Our financial position as a country is way out of balance,'' he
said. ``It's either going to come into balance, ... or there's going
to continue to be a lot of economic fragility.''
   The stock prices of IBM and its chief competitor, Digital
Equipment, plummeted during the past week when the companies
signaled their earnings in the current quarter would fall below many
analysts' estimates.
   IBM, the industry leader and the most highly capitalized company
in the nation, has blamed its lower earnings forecast on a microchip
manufacturing problem that has slowed delivery of its
top-of-the-line mainframe 3090S computers.
   Production of the chips, which pack up to 2,300 memory circuits
on a fingernail-sized slice of silicon, has proved more difficult
than the company expected. Only 2 or 3 of every 10 chips it turns
out are free of flaws and can be used.
   Digital, the second largest computer maker, said it has seen a
softening of demand for computers in the United States. At the low
end of the market, more and more powerful personal computers and
workstations have cut into sales of the larger and more expensive
minicomputers and mainframes.
   At the meeting Thursday, IBM executives said they have solved the
chip problem and will catch up with the backlog in orders by the end
of the year. They denied that the problem has hurt demand for the
mainframes.
   Because of the manufacturing delays, Wall Street analysts
forecast IBM will earn $10.25 to $10.75 a share this year, down from
previous estimates of $11 to $11.25 per share.
   Several analysts questioned the IBM executives closely about the
company's continuing reliance on sales of computer hardware for
approximately 70 percent of its revenue, while software and computer
services are the fastest growing segments of the market.
   George Conrades, a senior vice president, said IBM realized it
needed to emphasize software development and would begin ``wrapping
our hardware like a burrito'' in software and support services.
   While the IBM executives declined to make specific estimates for
sales or earnings growth this year, they said they expected rapid
increases in the Far East, slower growth in Europe and minor growth
in the United States.
   Akers also said IBM would compete vigorously in the market for
computers that use open, or freely licensed, operating systems based
on Unix, an increasingly popular system developed by American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
   He said that while IBM faces strong competition from Japanese
computer makers, it is poised to capitalize on heavy demand for
computers in Asia and the construction of computerized manufacturing
facilities by Japanese and Korean companies in the United States.

<HEAD>NYSE Cool To Electronic Stock-Trading Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Stock Exchange officials say they may
look at a 24-hour, electronic stock-trading system being developed
by a competitor, but they appear to be in no hurry to link up with
it.
   ``We're not sure there's interest in that right now,'' said
spokesman Richard Torrenzano. ``We're not sure that there's nough
demand to make the New York Stock Exchange go to 24-hour trading.''
   Nevertheless, Chicago Board Options Exchange President Charles
Henry indicated the New York Stock Exchange may be invited join the
computerized order-matching network for stocks and stock options
being developed by the Options Exchange, the Cincinnati Stock
Exchange and London-based Reuters Holdings PLC.
   ``We certainly have not discussed excluding other exchanges,''
Henry said Thursday in a telephone interview after the project was
announced.
   The network would be similar to electronic trading systems being
developed by Chicago's futures exchanges, theoretically giving
investors around the world 24-hour access to international financial
markets.
   But Torrenzano said the demand for round-the-clock stock trading
is probably limited to only about 100 ``world-class'' stocks such as
IBM and General Motors, some of which are already accessible 24
hours a day because they are listed on overseas exchanges as well on
U.S. boards.
   Officials said they could not estimate a start-up date for the
system, which will require approval from the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   The Chicago Board Options Exchange owns the majority of
memberships on the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, which lists the 300
largest-volume issues traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The Cincinnati exchange is the only fully computerized securities
market in the United States, using a computer to match buy and sell
orders. It averaged 1 million trades per day last year compared with
about 170 million trades per day on the New York Stock Exchange, by
far the nation's largest securities market.
   Henry said the decision to develop an electronic trading system
was a reaction to the increasingly international nature of investing.
   ``Take an IBM,'' he said. ``It's traded by investors in Europe,
in Tokyo, in Singapore, in the United States.''
   ``We're seeing globalization enter into the stock and securities
markets as it has in other markets,'' Henry said. ``We want to be at
the forefront by opening up access to our marketplace.''
   The Chicago Board Options Exchange is the world's largest market
for stock options and stock-index options. A stock option is a right
to buy or sell 100 shares of a given stock at a specified price by a
future date. Stock-index options involve baskets of stocks, such as
those represented by the Standard &amp; Poor's 100 and 500 indexes.
   Investors use stock options to reduce their risks in the stock
market or to speculate on price movements.
   London-based Reuters, a leading vendor of financial information,
would supply the technology for the system through its Instinet
Corp. subsidiary.
   Reuters and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are developing a
similar system, called Globex, for 24-hour trading of futures
contracts. A future is a binding contract to buy or sell a commodity
or financial instrument at a specified price on a future date.
   Globex is expected to become operational this fall, as is Aurora,
a competing system being developed by the Chicago Board of Trade,
the world's largest futures market.
   Globex already has received commitments from three other futures
exchanges, the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Sydney Futures
Exchange of Australia and the French futures exchange known as
MATIF, to offer some of their products for trading on the system.

<HEAD>Dow Sued Over Mortar Additive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Colorado court is trying to determine whether a
mortar additive made by Michigan-based Dow Chemical Co. caused walls
to crumble.
   A bank, hospitals, and now a hotel in Denver are among dozens of
plaintiffs that have sought damages in lawsuits spanning the last
decade stemming from use of the additive, Sarabond. They claim the
substance corrodes metal supports, letting bricks fall or entire
walls sag.
   But Dow says brickwork can deteriorate for many reasons and
argues that its corporate wealth _ $16.68 billion in 1988 revenue _
makes the Midland-based chemical giant an easy ``deep pockets''
target for lawsuits.
   Trial opened Monday in a suit brought by the Executive Tower Inn
in Denver. The hotel is seeking $190 million in actual and punitive
damages from Dow.
   The suit is one of 28 pending cases involving Sarabond, which was
sold by Dow from 1965 to 1976 and used in structures ranging from
hospitals to the Eisenhower Memorial Tunnel in the Rocky Mountains
west of Denver. Additional suits have been settled out of court.
   ``We do remain convinced that Sarabond is not deficient. We are
back in the courtroom this week defending our position,'' Dow
spokeswoman Terri McNeill said.
   Two previous suits have gone to trial and juries found Dow liable
in both, although one is under appeal.
   A 1979 complaint by Central National Bank in Cleveland resulted
in a $28 million damage award and later was settled for $13 million.
   A Johnson Circuit Court jury in Franklin, Ind., on May 3, 1988,
awarded St. Vincent's Hospital in Indianapolis $1.7 million in
actual damages and $5 million in punitive damages. That judgment is
being appealed.
   Meanwhile, new court actions continue to crop up.
   Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo filed suit last month,
claiming Sarabond-mortared brickwork on a service-elevator tower
built in the early 1970s was deteriorating. Bronson is asking
damages in excess of $10,000.
   Attorney Bill Dorigan of Minneapolis, who represents the
Executive Tower Inn, Bronson Hospital and other Sarabond plaintiffs,
has said the mortar additive releases chloride similar to road
de-icing salt.
   Metal supports tying the mortared brickwork to the building walls
or frame corrode, bricks or sections of wall crack and loosen, and
in some cases bricks have fallen, Dorigan said.
   He said he knew of no resulting injuries, and structural damage
to buildings has not been involved.
   Dow sold the Sarabond business in 1976 to Masonry Systems
International, and in the early 1980s the product ceased to be
marketed. McNeill said Dow sold the business because Sarabond was
unprofitable.
   Dow maintains the mortar additive did not cause the problems that
led to the lawsuits, McNeill said.
   The company used Sarabond in its own Midland headquarters
buildings as recently as 1981 with no problems, she said.
   Dorigan disputed that, in an interview prior to the Executive
Tower Inn trial. He said he visited the Dow headquarters twice _
after obtaining court orders in two previous lawsuits _ and found
rusted metal and cracked bricks both times.
   Dorigan said more than 20 other suits have been filed that never
came to trial. Dow wouldn't comment on the number of suits settled
or the total amount of the settlements, McNeill said.
   ``There have been settlements over the years,'' she said. ``They
are not an admission of liability. Where we can resolve suits
amicably we do our best to accomplish that.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court: EPA Can't Evade Acid Rain Question by Inaction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court in Manhattan has ruled
that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has to announce what
it's going to do about changing air quality standards _ even if it's
nothing.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-to-1 decision, has
ruled that federal district courts can compel the EPA ``to make some
formal decision'' on whether or not to revise air quality standards.
   The decision reversed a lower court ruling that threw out a
lawsuit by seven states and four environmental groups against the
EPA and its administrator, Lee M. Thomas.
   Filed in December 1985, the lawsuit sought to compel Thomas to
update the EPA's ambient air quality standards for sulphur oxides,
which cause acid rain.
   Those sulphur oxide standards, which haven't been revised since
the early 1970s, are used to set legal emission levels for
pollutants the EPA identifies as hazardous.
   While the EPA has revised the criteria for determining air
quality standards, it has taken no public action on the standards
themselves ``neither revising the existing standards nor formally
declining to revise them,'' noted the 2nd Circuit opinion written by
Circuit Judge Ralph K. Winter.
   Judge Ellsworth A. Van Graafeiland concurred but Judge J. Daniel
Mahoney dissented. The ruling was made Wednesday and announced
Thursday.
   The lawsuit was brought by New York, Vermont, Connecticut, New
Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Minnesota as well as the
Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Council, the
Sierra Club and the National Parks and Conservation Association.
   Last April, U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein ruled that for
technical reasons he did not have the authority to consider the
lawsuit.
   But the appeals court said that interpretation would leave ``a
bureaucratic twilight zone'' in which EPA action or inaction would
not be subject to court review.
   The 2nd Circuit panel ruled that while it's up to Thomas to
decide what specific changes to make in the air quality standards,
the EPA administrator has a ``duty to make some formal decision'' on
the need to update national air standards.
   The 2nd Circuit noted that shortly after Edelstein's decision,
the EPA announced that it was ``premature and unwise'' to change air
quality standards to address the acid rain problem.
   The appeals court said Edelstein should issue an order directing
the EPA to continue its public decision making process.
   ``This victory could not have come at a better time,'' said New
York Attorney General Robert Abrams in a statement issued by his
office. ``It shows that the EPA has had the power and the duty to
act against acid rain all along, but that it has refused, leading to
needless destruction of forests and waters throughout the
Northeast.''
   Abrams added: ``If the (Bush) administration accepts this
decision without further appeal and updates the standards it will
advance the cause of acid rain reduction.''
   Massachusetts First Assistant Attorney General Gerald Fitzgerald
said in a statement: ``The EPA for too long has taken a no-action
approach to air pollution and acid rain. It is unfortunate that it
takes litigation and a court judgement to force EPA to face up to
its responsibilities under the Clean Air Act. Now that the court has
ruled, we trust EPA will stop pondering the acid rain problem and do
something about it.''

<HEAD>Centaur Drops $110-A-Share Bid For Pennwalt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Centaur Partners has finally admitted defeat
in its months-long wrangle to take over Pennwalt Corp., leaving the
principal investors richer but also saying they feel disappointed.
   Centaur dropped its $110-per-share bid Thursday, three days after
Pennwalt announced a $132-per-share offer from the French
government-controlled oil and chemical concern Societe Nationale Elf
Aquitaine.
   Based on the number of Pennwalt's outstanding shares _ 8 million
_ Elf Aquitaine's offer amounts to more than $1 billion.
   Centaur's announcement that it would end its takeover bid
coincided with Elf Aquitaine's formal commencement of the offer,
three days after Pennwalt's board of directors voted unanimously to
accept the Elf Aquitaine deal.
   ``We are realistic enough to know when to stop fighting,'' said
Abbey J. Butler, one of the main Centaur investors.
   ``We wanted to buy the company,'' said Melvyn J. Estrin, Butler's
partner. ``But at this point, the way we see it, this price is
higher than we were prepared to go. We are happy with it. It
maximizes the value to all shareholders.''
   It is estimated that Centaur, which owns about 13 percent of
Pennwalt's stock, stands to make $60 million. The group began buying
stock in the chemical company in June, when the price was $65 a
share.
   Pennwalt's chairman, Edwin E. Tuttle, maintained throughout the
takeover bid that Centaur never actually wanted to acquire the
company but merely wanted to drive up the stock prices.
   Pennwalt's managers proved to be ``formidable opponents,'' Butler
said.
   ``I think Mr. Tuttle demonstrated his determination to oppose us,
and he preferred fighting rather than sitting down and talking,'' he
said.
   Butler and Estrin said they plan to make a bid for another
company.
   ``We will look to find other situations that we can buy that are
substantially undervalued,'' he said.
   Pennwalt had fought Centaur since the investment group first made
its plans known last June.
   Pennwalt went to court to stop Centaur from calling a
shareholders meeting, where the investment group hoped to replace
the directors, paving the way for the takeover bid to succeed.
   Pennwalt's stock closed at $130.25 Thursday in consolidated
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock's price jumped
$13.12{ _ about 11 percent _ to $130.12{ when Elf Aquitaine's offer
was made public Monday.

<TEXT>
   Investor Eli Jacobs of New York will pay
$27.6 million to revitalize Worlds of Wonder Inc., according to a
plan of reorganization and disclosure statement filed in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court.
   The documents filed Thursday contain details of a five-year
reorganization of the troubled Fremont toy company, which last month
announced an agreement to sell to investors headed by Jacobs, the
majority stockholder of a group buying the Baltimore Orioles.
   Worlds of Wonder, which began in a trailer in 1985 and saw sales
climb to $300 million with such toys as Lazer Tag and the talking
bear Teddy Ruxpin, filed for protection from creditors under Chapter
11 of bankruptcy laws in December 1987. It owed more than $300
million to creditors.
   According to the reorganization plan, Jacobs has agreed to buy
the company's inventory and assets for $10 million and will pay an
extra $17.6 million for stock and notes.
   Jacobs also will receive licensing rights to the company's
products, with the exception of Worlds of Wonder's Class Acts school
accessories line.
   Worlds of Wonder's major creditor _ the Algemene Bank Nederland
of New York, which is owed $32 million _ will be paid in full, said
Ann Jordan, a WOW lawyer.
   Five other financial institutions are expected to be repaid $30
million of the $78 million they are owed, Jordan said.
   Unsecured creditors, owed a combined $240 million, will be paid a
combined $5 million cash and $1.5 million in preferred stock, Jordan
said.
   Jacobs' partners are Franklyn S. Barry Jr., former president of
Fisher-Price Toys, and David Edleman, president of Sheridan
Companies Inc. of Buffalo. The adequacy of their plan will be
determined at a hearing scheduled for April 10.
   The reorganization proposal also must have the approval of
creditors.

   Planters LifeSavers Co. hopes customers
hungry for nostalgia will savor the return of its old-fashioned
flavors not seen on store shelves in decades.
   The company's Holland plant recently began producing the
``Limited Edition Nostalgia Flavors'' _ ``Lic-O-Rice,''
``Choc-O-Late'' and ``Pepsin.'' Stores began carrying them a week
ago.
   All three of the limited edition flavors were developed in the
1920s. Lic-O-Rice and Pepsin were discontinued in 1938, while
Choc-O-Late was produced until 1968.
   ``Our society's general interest in nostalgia is booming these
days, and many Americans associate LifeSavers candy with warm
memories of their childhood and quieter, simpler lifestyles,'' said
Jeff Walters, associate product manager for the Winston-Salem,
N.C.-based company.
   Company officials said the three flavors will be sold for a
limited time in a response to consumers' requests.
   When LifeSavers candies first rolled into stores in 1912,
Pep-O-Mint was the only flavor available.
   Over the years, 45 flavors have been sold at various times and 34
billion rolls have been purchased. Currently, 17 flavors are on the
market.

<HEAD>Pharmaceutical Company Strengthens Anti-takeover Measures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Upjohn Co., unaware of any efforts to
accumulate stock or gain control, nevertheless has strengthened
existing anti-takeover measures, Chairman Theodore Cooper says.
   The pharmaceutical company's board of directors adopted three
changes to a shareholders' rights policy adopted in 1986.
   ``The amendments are intended to reflect developments in case law
and make the plan a more effective deterrent to the abusive takeover
tactics that can be used to deprive shareholders of the full value
of their investment,'' Cooper said Thursday.
   Shareholders now can acquire stock at half-price if any party
acquires 20 percent of Upjohn's outstanding shares. Previously, an
acquirer also had to take other action such as a merger or sale of
assets.
   The market value of Upjohn's outstanding stock totals about $6
billion, meaning an investment of more than $1 billion would be
needed to gain a 20 percent stake.
   Making it easier for current shareholders to obtain additional
stock in the event of a takeover bid would increase the number of
shares outstanding, diluting a would-be acquirer's stake, spokesman
R.D. LaRue said.
   Another amendment would let the board accept Upjohn shares rather
than cash for such transactions _ extending the plan to stockholders
lacking ready cash.
   A third change would let the board carry out the transactions for
up to 30 days after anyone obtained 20 percent or more of the
company's stock, rather than only prior to that time.
   Upjohn, a worldwide manufacturer and marketer of human and animal
health care products and services, had 1988 revenue of $2.75 billion.

   A company that admitted selling defective heart
pacemakers has agreed to pay $5 million to settle claims that it
defrauded the government, the Justice Department says.
   The Cordis Corp. in Miami is satisfied with the agreement, said
Chick McDowell, vice president for corporate relations, who noted
that the company already has spent $4 million in legal fees and
associated costs.
   ``What we did is we paid $1 million yesterday with the signing,
and the balance of $4 million will be paid in three equal annual
installments at 7{ percent interest,'' McDowell said Thursday.
   The agreement, announced Thursday by the Justice Department, was
simply to reimburse the government for pacemakers purchased directly
by the Veterans Administration or that were subject to reimbursement
through Medicare and Medicaid programs. It would not provide
payments to anyone who had a faulty pacemaker implanted or the
survivors of anyone who died because of it, said Justice spokeswoman
Amy Brown.
   The Food and Drug Administration has alleged that the devices
could stop without warning, and said that between December 1983 and
October 1985 the company shipped 2,200 pacemakers subject to
potential failure and 6,000 batteries even though it knew they were
subject to corrosion.
   The settlement did not indicate how many pacemakers the
reimbursement covered.
   McDowell said there haven't been any suits brought by those
people who bought the pacemakers themselves or who had them
implanted by the VA.
   Ms. Brown said the settlement would not preclude such individuals
from suing the company.
   John R. Bolton, assistant attorney general in charge of the
department's Civil Division, said the settlement is believed to be
one of the largest Medicare recoveries ever.
   The out-of-court settlemet of civil claims is unconnected with
criminal charges against Cordis, which sold off its pacemaker
business two years ago to Telectronics, an Australian medical device
manufacturer.
   In the criminal case, U.S. District Judge Stanley Marcus in Miami
last October rejected a plea-bargain arrangement between Cordis and
federal prosecutors under which the company would have pleaded
guilty to 23 counts of selling defective pacemakers and would have
paid $123,000 in criminal fines and $141,000 in costs. The judge
said the payment was too low.
   A new agreement is to be presented next week to Marcus, McDowell
said. Under that plan, Cordis would plead guilty to 12 felony and 13
misdemeanor counts and pay the government more than $700,000 in
fines and costs of the investigation, he said.
   The agreement would not affect a separate indictment of four
former Cordis officers, who have all pleaded innocent.
   The company reported net losses of $56.1 million in 1987, but
underwent a major restructuring since selling the pacemaker
operation. Net earnings for 1988 totaled $2.4 million on sales of
$132 million.

   Cooper Industries Inc.'s purchase of Champion
Spark Plug Co. probably won't result in immediate changes for the
Toledo manufacturer, an auto analyst says.
   But William Prebe, an independent consultant and formerly Dana
Corp.'s chief economist, said Thursday that some white collar jobs
at Champion's Toledo headquarters are likely to be phased out over
the next year as Houston-based Cooper assumes more control of
Champion.
   ``Cooper will begin to absorb their name into their parts
network. Cooper also will begin to absorb Champion departments into
their operations. After a period of time, they will determine what
they will do with the Toledo operation,'' he said.
   ``But I see some of Champion's management, including department
heads, being let go or assigned new positions,'' he said.
   Cooper announced Thursday that it had purchased 83.2 percent of
Champion common stock, moving it a step closer toward a planned
merger with the spark plug maker.
   When completed, Cooper will have paid $707 million for the 33.6
million outstanding shares of Champion common stock.
   Cooper spokeswoman Ellen Meyers said Thursdsy that the company
bought the shares for $21 a share. Cooper needed 50.1 percent
ownership to take control.
   Champion stock closed at 20], down 1\, in trading on the New York
Stock Exchange Thursday.
   The merger was approved by directors of Cooper and Champion on
Feb. 22.
   ``We're in good shape,'' Ms. Meyers said from the company's
Houston headquarters. ``The merger will go through. The actual legal
merger won't take place until after May 1.''
   After the merger, shares not acquired in the original cash tender
offer will be exchanged for $21 a share in cash, she said.
   The deal, including debt reduction, legal fees and other
considerations, brings the total purchase price to about $800
million, she said.
   The announcement ends nearly two months of speculation and rumors
about a Champion purchase. On Jan. 25, Dana, a Toledo auto parts
firm, offered to buy Champion for $590 million in cash and stock. A
week later, Cooper said it would offer at least $21-a-share cash for
Champion.
   Champion stock has traded above $21 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange, fueling rumors that Cooper would have to up its bid.
   Cooper has not said whether it would move Champion's headquarters
from Toledo to Houston.
   Cooper's tender offer, launched Feb. 23, expired at 12:01 a.m.
Thursday.
   Among the shares tendered were those of Chinook Partners L.P.,
which was established in 1986 by the founding Stranahan family to
maintain a dominant voice in Champion's affairs. It controlled 35
percent of Champion's common Stock.
   Champion is the world's leading manufacturer of spark plugs for
all types of internal combustion engine. It has annual revenue of
about $720 million and employs about 9,200 workers worldwide.
   Cooper, with 1988 revenue of $4.3 billion, makes products for the
electrical, electronic, commercial, industrial, compression and
drilling markets.

<TEXT>
   Turner Broadcasting System's board of directors
has decided not to pursue a partial acquisition of Financial News
Network Inc., a published report said.
   The Atlanta Constitution today cited ``knowledgeable sources'' in
its report that the TBS board, in a closed meeting Thursday, decided
not to pursue a proposed purchase of a large block of FNN stock, but
did give a tentative go-ahead to creation of a regional cable TV
sports channel.
   TBS spokesman Michael Oglesby said today he could not comment on
the topics under consideration by the board.
   According to published reports, TBS would have paid between $100
million and $110 million for 45 percent of the stock of FNN, a New
York-based cable TV service which reaches up to 32 million homes
with business news and other programming.
   A regional sports channel of the kind now reportedly under
consideration at TBS could serve the Southeast with cable TV
coverage of area professional and college sports.
   Turner Broadcasting's ``SuperStation'' WTBS currently broadcasts
Atlanta Braves baseball, National Basketball Association games,
Southeastern Conference college football and other events. Turner
Broadcasting also owns Cable News Network, its sister channel
Headline News, the Braves, basketball's Atlanta Hawks and other
holdings.

   Five million Japanese women have entered the work
force in the past 13 years, but many suffer from sex discrimination
despite government efforts to protect them, an official report said
today.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's office said the number of women
in the work force has increased from 12 million in 1975 to 17
million in 1988 _ roughly 40 percent of the total work force.
   However, an official for the Takeshita's office, Kiyoko Fujii,
said few women get responsible positions in management or as
specialists, despite Japan's 1981 Equal Opportunity Employment Law.
For example, only 29 women are representatives in the 764-member
parliament, she said.
   More than 63 percent of all working women who responded to a
government survey in 1987 complained of unequal treatment, said a
report by Takeshita's office.
   Although many private companies have begun providing equal
opportunities for female job-seekers, women face discrimination in
promotions, pay and working conditions, Ms. Fujii said.
   She also charged that ``general position'' examinations for
promotions may discriminate against women. The test does not violate
the 1981 law because it involves promotion, not hiring, she said.
   Lack of child care facilities at work sites is also a big
obstacle for mothers who want to keep working. ``Many companies
don't allow mothers to bring their children to work,'' she said.
   In a 30-minute video at a government news conference today,
several career women with responsible positions were introduced.
   ``Japanese society is still ruled by men, and the roles of each
sex are stubbornly fixed. More women should take part in
decision-making processes in society _ especially in politics _ to
share responsibilities equally with men,'' feminist Yoko Nuita said
in the video.

   The economy expanded at a moderate 2.4 percent
annual rate in the last three months of 1988, the government
reported, but analysts said the figure was held down by last
summer's drought and masked strong underlying growth at year's end.
   The increase in the gross national product, the broadest measure

   A suspended Navy official faces up to 25
years in prison for bribery in the Pentagon purchasing scandal, and
a company that profited from his inside information will pay more
than $4.3 million in fines.
   Stuart E. Berlin admitted on Thursday that he accepted a bribe to
provide inside information on a $24 million contract eventually
awarded to Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif., a division
of Teledyne Industries Inc.
   Teledyne Industries Inc. pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud
the United States and two counts of making false statements to the
government, and agreed to pay $1.5 million in penalties, $2 million
in civil claims and $786,000 to reimburse the government for the
cost of the investigation.
   In addition, Teledyne agreed to give up its negotiated 13.5
percent profit on the contract that could result in a savings to the
government of $4 million over the next three years, the Justice
Department said.
   Berlin, 51, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United
States, to commit bribery, wire fraud and filing false statements,
as well as receiving a bribe as a government official and wire fraud.
   U.S. District Judge Claude Hylton set sentencing for June 2, when
Berlin could face up to 25 years in prison and fines of up to
$750,000. Berlin made no comment as he left the courtroom.
   As part of his plea agreement, Berlin also will cooperate with
prosecutors in the continuing ``Ill Wind'' investigation, including
the trial of his former co-defendants in the indictment.
   Those defendants in the trial scheduled to begin April 3 are
defense consultants Fred H. Lackner and William L. Parkin, as well
as three Teledyne officials: George H. Kaub, Eugene R. Sullivan and
Dale Schnittjer. Parkin was hospitalized last Friday after
reportedly taking an overdose of pills.
   With Thursday's action, the more than 2-year-old investigation
has resulted in a dozen guilty pleas that have been publicly
revealed, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph J. Aronica.
   He refused to say whether other people or companies under
investigation already have agreed to plead guilty.
   Aronica also would not disclose how extensively Berlin's
testimony might be used against other defendants, saying only, ``The
total investigation is moving along very quickly.''
   As part of the plea agreements, prosecutors dismissed counts of
bribery and wire fraud against Berlin and Teledyne. Racketeering
charges had been dropped at an earlier court hearing.
   Teledyne said in a statement that it decided to enter the plea
arrangement primarily due to ``the recognition that a former
employee, Michael Savaides, had entered into a corrupt and illegal
arrangement with William Parkin, a consultant to Teledyne
Electronics, and Fred Lackner, with whom the company had no
relationship.''
   ``Their purpose was to subvert the lawful operation of the
government's procurement process,'' the company said. Savaides has
pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing.
   Berlin had been a supervisory electronics engineer and branch
head of the ship systems engineering section at the Space and Naval
Warfare Systems Command in Arlington, Va., when the actions occurred.
   The Justice Department said Berlin received about $1,000 every
few months from Parkin and Lackner in exchange for giving them
classified documents. The indictment said the consultants were
getting their information from Berlin.
   He was reassigned to a non-procurement job in June 1988, when the
investigation became public, and he was suspended without pay
shortly after he was indicted in January.
   The Navy will review his plea agreement before deciding on
Berlin's employment status, said Lt. Bruce Cole, a Navy spokesman.
   The Pentagon, meanwhile, is re-evaluating its suspension in
January of Teledyne Electronics from new contracts, but had made no
decision Thursday.
   The $24 million contract at issue was for hand-held electronic
testing equipment that checks whether radar transponders are working
before military airplanes are allowed to fly. The Mark 12 IFF
transponder test set checks the equipment that helps identify
whether a plane flying nearby is a friend or foe.
   The Army, Navy and Air Force are using the equipment, and the
Navy purchased the sets under a master Air Force contract. Since
July 1987, when Teledyne was awarded the contract, the Navy has
received 105 of the sets, and plans to buy 43 more this year.
   The Pentagon's suspension of Teledyne Electronics did not affect
the contract already awarded.

   The American Suzuki Motor Corp. has settled
lawsuits brought by seven states by agreeing to publicize that its
Samurai model may roll over in sharp turns.
   The company, which is based in Brea, Calif., also will pay
$200,000 to cover what it cost New York, California, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, Missouri, Texas and Washington to brings suits accusing
Suzuki of false and deceptive advertising. The agreement was
announced Thursday.
   In the settlement, which took effect Tuesday, the company made no
admission of guilt or safety problems.
   Safety of the Samurai came into question last June after Consumer
Reports magazine gave the four-wheel-drive sport utility vehicle a
rating of ``not acceptable.'' It said the Samurai was too short,
narrow, light and high-riding to be safe and that it rolled over in
a routine obstacle-avoidance test.
   Consumers Union, publisher of the magazine, asked the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration to recall the more than
150,000 Samurais sold in the United States since its introduction in
November 1985.
   The federal safety agency declined to recall the car, saying in
September that the Samurai rollover rate was ``within the range of
most other light utility vehicles.''
   N. Douglas Mazza, vice president of the car company, issued a
statement that said the agreement with the seven states ``affirms
that the Samurai is a safe vehicle and strongly supports the federal
government decision that there is no reason to investigate the
safety of the Samurai.''
   While Suzuki is bound, under the settlement, to include the
warning in ads shown or published only in the seven states involved
in the case, the company said it would be included in all national
advertising.
   New York Attorney General Robert Abrams said Thursday that the
states took action because ``the federal government has, once again,
failed to act to protect the consumers of this country.''
   He said that under the settlement, Suzuki's print ads will have
to include the statement: ``This vehicle handles differently from
ordinary passenger cars. Federal law cautions to avoid sharp turns
and abrupt maneuvers which can cause vehicles of this type to roll
over. Always wear your seatbelt. For specific details, please read
your owner's manual.''
   A shorter version of the statement is required for television and
radio ads, Abrams said.

   The dollar moved higher in extremely quiet
domestic trading Friday and rose slightly in limited dealings in
Europe, where most markets were closed for Good Friday.
   Commodities markets were closed worldwide.
   ``Trading was almost nonexistent,'' said Bob Morrissey, a senior
trader at the Bank of Boston's New York office. He said activity had
virtually shut down at about midday.
   ``If anybody had a small position, there was small-position
squaring,'' Morrissey said.
   Earlier in Europe, traders said what little activity existed
fizzled out with the winding down of the Tokyo trading day. Most
leading European financial centers were closed for Good Friday and
will reopen Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.39 Japanese yen to a closing 131.27
yen. Later in Europe, it was quoted at 131.30 yen. In New York, the
dollar traded at 131.48 Japanese yen, up from 131.25 yen late
Thursday.
   In Europe, the British pound fell to $1.7190 from $1.7205 late
Thursday. In New York, sterling declined to $1.7195 from Thursday's
$1.7215.
   Other midday dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.8738 West German marks, up from
1.8715; 1.6275 Swiss francs, up from 1.6264; 6.4000 French francs,
up from 6.3333; 1,377.50 Italian lire, up from 1,376.88, and 1.1905
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1901.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.8733 West German marks, up from 1.8720; 1.6252 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6260; 6.3350 French francs, up from 6.3315;

   Gold and silver bullion markets in New York, London, Zurich and
Hong Kong were closed for the holiday.

<HEAD>Households Are Selling Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In spite of the promotional efforts of brokerage
houses, American households continue to withdraw from the stock
market.
   That news is a bit of a surprise to a lot of people, who assume
that the family next door and probably most of the other neighbors _
in fact, almost everyone but them _ has a cache of blue chips or
growth stocks.
   It's a common misconception, created in part by the strong
promotional efforts of brokers, by repeated media reports and
stories, and by a proliferation of how-to books that prescribe
exotic investing techniques.
   The reality is different. For six straight years household direct
ownership of stocks has fallen, and by massive amounts. Since 1982,
those households have been net sellers of more than a half trillion
dollars of corporate shares.
   Not all of that amount represents desertions from the market,
because many people today prefer to invest through stock mutual
funds, which act as intermediaries between market and customer.
   But even these funds became net sellers last year by about $14.7
billion, according to Federal Reserve data, although they remain net
buyers by more than $52 billion since 1983.
   Because every sell order is matched by a buy order, somebody must
be buying. Foreign investors?
   Not last year. While they were strong buyers in 1986 and 1987,
adding $17.8 billion and $15.5 billion respectively to their
portfolios, they too became sellers in 1988, reducing their holdings
by $1.3 billion.
   Private pension funds? No way. For the fourth straight year they
were net sellers, reducing their portfolios by $21 billion in 1988.
   Insurance companies? Yes and no. Life insurers reduced holdings
by $2.2 billion, but fire and casualty insurance companies added
$3.1 billion to theirs, double their net investments for 1987, the
year of the big crash.
   The one big category of institutional buying was state and local
government retirement funds, which increased net holdings by $23.1
billion for the year and by $128.5 billion for the past six years.
   A variety of factors help explain the phenomenon, at least
superficially.
   The proliferation of mutual funds has lured away once-direct
investors. The development of a great variety of less-risky debt
instruments, especially when interest rates are rising, adds to the
understanding.
   Some analysts include need as a factor.
   A demographic bulge of families in the home-buying years may have
been cashing in inheritances to buy houses, which have soared in
price in the 1980s. And retired parents, beneficiaries of big gains
from post-World War II investments, have come to a time in life when
redemption seems more sensible.
   The decline of household investments in the market, therefore,
need not be interpreted as a growing cynicism about stocks.
   But it does shatter a widespread and disturbing myth, that every
household but yours has a net egg of shares they can tap whenever
the need or urge arises.
   If they had such a cache, there's a good chance they've already
dipped into it. The statistics, at least, seem to suggest that.

<HEAD>Profit Down 25 Percent in 2nd Qtr.; Attributed to Sale of Hospitals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Medical International Inc.
said Friday its second-quarter profit was 25 percent below levels of
a year ago, primarily because the company sold 36 of its hospitals
to an employee stock plan.
   The health care company said it earned $18.1 million, or 26 cents
a share, in the second quarter, down from $24.1 million, or 30 cents
a share in the second quarter of 1988.
   Sales in the quarter ended Feb. 28 were $678.2 million, down from
$766.1 million a year ago.
   If the previous year's figure was adjusted to remove results from
the hospitals that were sold, the company said, second-quarter sales
would have totaled $611.3 million.
   American Medical owns 55 hospitals and psychiatric treatment
centers in the United States and 20 such facilities overseas.
   The company sold 36 hospitals to EPIC Healthcare, an employee
stock ownership plan, on Sept. 20, 1988.
   First-quarter profits also were depressed by the addition of $13
million to the company's reserve for potential malpractice suits and
$11 million to buy out leases as part of a headquarters
consolidation program.
   In the first six months of this fiscal year, American Medical
earned $18.6 million, or 26 cents a share, down from $63.3 million,
or 76 cents a share a year earlier. Sales were $1.32 billion, down
from $1.51 billion a year earlier.

   A green flag sent about 100 Europeans
thundering down the road in their vintage Mustangs Friday for a
seven-week tour of the United States to celebrate the 25th birthday
of the classic Ford sportscar.
   Some 37 pre-1973 Mustangs were shipped into the Port of
Jacksonville for the 7,000-mile trek. Drivers from Switzerland,
England and the Netherlands were joined on the first leg of the
journey to Pensacola by about 50 Mustangs from the Southeast.
   John Manners, a Swiss maintenance electrician who organized the
so-called American Pony Drive, said driving a Ford Mustang across
the United State is akin to an American driving a Porsche across
Germany.
   ``It provides an excellent excuse for everybody to do what
they've always wanted to do,'' said Manners, who has been planning
the tour for three years.
   The cars will cover 200 miles a day or less, Manners said. A
large number of American Mustang enthusiasts are expected to join in
along the way.
   Jerg Pflugger of Solothurn, Switzerland, proudly displayed his
restored 1972 Mustang, which is painted with a design or red, yellow
and orange. ``I wanted some exciting painting,'' he said.
   Jeff and Jane Holm, Mustang owners from Roswell, Ga., joined the
tour and planned to travel to New Orleans before returning home.
   Holm, 47, recently restored the car he bought new in 1964,
putting in a new engine and undercarriage. ``We were just kids when
we bought this car,'' he said. ``It was our fun car.''
   From Pensacola, the Mustang caravan will make stops in New
Orleans, Dallas, Tulsa, Okla., Albuquerque, N.M., and Flagstaff,
Ariz., among other stops.
   The caravan will hit Las Vegas on April 11, where 1,000 members
of Mustang clubs across the United States are expected make the run
to Los Angeles.
   The Mustangs leave Los Angeles on April 21 for stops in, to name
a few cities, Little Rock, Ark.; Memphis and Nashville, Tenn.;
Columbus, Ohio; Indianapolis and Pittsburgh, before ending in
Baltimore, on May 8.

<HEAD>Credit Card Interest Rates Creeping Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In springtime, consumers' thoughts turn to
sprucing up themselves and their surroundings. That often means
pulling out the plastic.
   But this spring, many credit cardholders who don't pay their
balances each month will shell out more in interest than they would
have a year ago because rates have been creeping up on cards since
last summer.
   Among the big credit-card issuers, Chase Manhattan Corp. this
month nudged up interest rates for new subscribers to 19.8 percent
annually from 17.5 percent. The interest rate for about one-third of
existing subscribers also is rising; for the rest, rates will remain
unchanged, the bank says.
   Chase, which handles more credit-card accounts than anyone in the
business besides Citicorp., had been offering the lowest average
rate of all major issuers.
   The interest rate was also raised by Baltimore-based MNC
Financial Corp., parent of Maryland National Bank, which ranks among
the top ten biggest issuers in the country. Interest rates on about
a quarter of its accounts went up to 18.9 percent annually from 17.9
percent.
   Industry leader Citicorp with about 23 million accounts
nationally says it hasn't changed rates for the past couple of
years.Bank officials declined to answer queries on whether any
increases are in the works.
   Citicorp's rates have been at the high end among the big issuers,
at 19.8 percent for holders of most regular, not gold, cards.
   People who track developments in the business say the latest
increases are part of a trend that started months ago, coinciding
with the direction taken by borrowing costs throughout the economy.
Some yearly fees on credit cards have gone up a bit, too, but only
slightly.
   In a number of instances, the rate increases are imposed
selectivel on cardholders with histories of late payments, analysts
say.
   Some issuers have vowed to hold out as long as possible before
hoisting interest rates.
   Rocky Mountain BankCard and United Bank of Denver, Colorado's two
largest credit-card issuers, are among those that intend to stick
with the status quo for now. But bankers at the two institutions say
they can't hold out forever if credit costs keep rising.
   ``We're not going to stand here and lose money,'' says Mac
Ruxton, senior vice president in charge of credit card operations
for United Bank.
   United Bank, which handles 225,000 accounts, is holding the line
at 18.8 percent interest and keeping its fee at $15.
   Rocky Mountain BankCard, Colorado's largest issuer and No.10
nationwide, will hold rates at the current 18.6 percent-level, with
a fee of $12, according to executive vice president Denny Dumler.
   John Pollock, editor and publisher of the newsletter Bank Credit
Card Observer, says ``We've been noticing there's been a gradual
rise since July in both interest rates and annual fees.''
   A survey of 200 banks around the country Pollock's newsletter
conducts every two months supports the point. The average annual
rate on cards was 17.24 percent in the July-August poll and 17.61
percent in the Jan.-Feb. poll.
   Annual average fees during the same respective survey periods
were $16.74 and $17.29.
   In the battle for market share, competing issuers are
concentrating on fostering customer loyalty and paying relatively
less attention to interest rate levels.
   Some analysts say annual interest rates on credit cards would
have to pass the 20 percent threshold before customers would squawk.
And, to the roughly 40 percent of cardholders who pay up each month,
the rate is irrelevant.
   ``There's an overwhelming attention to customer service, which
suggests that bankers have concluded that very few customers will
switch (cards) within a fairly wide range of interest rates,''
Pollock said.
   Citicorp, for instance, has emphasized enhancements in recent
years to woo customers. It offers cardholders fringe benefits
ranging from lost-luggage insurance to toll-free telephone
information numbers.
   ``They are a good example of the power of customer service and
enhancements and the willingness to accept cardholders with a wide
range of credit histories,'' says Pollock.
   ``The battle now for customer loyalty is not whether you can get
consumers to accept your card....'' but to ``encourage card use,''
he says.
   ``Wallets and purses are saturated with plastic right now.''

<HEAD>Coffee Market Turns Jittery; Return to Free Market Feared</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<HEAD>AP Business Writer</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A lot of coffee traders are getting the jitters these days, and
it's not because they're drinking too much java.
   The nervousness reflects a growing fear that international
tensions will destroy the market's 26-year-old price-support system
and allow free-market forces to prevail, with lower prices the
likely result.
   Concerns about that prospect took center stage at New York's
Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange during the past week and are likely
to intensify as representatives from the world's largest
coffee-producing and coffee-consuming nations prepare for a 2-week
conference in London.
   The April 4-19 meeting is the last regularly scheduled gathering
of the International Coffee Organization council before Sept. 30,
when the organization's 6-year price-support agreement expires.
   Delegates of the 74-nation group last met in February and made
negligible progress on addressing consumer-nation demands aimed at
increasing the availability of mild coffees, the type preferred by
growing numbers of coffee drinkers.
   Mild coffees are grown mainly in Central and South America while
the less-flavorful robusta coffees are produced primarily in Africa.
   The failure of the February session prompted heavy selling of
coffee futures in New York, dropping the price for May delivery
below $1.23 a pound on Feb. 21, just 7 weeks after the contract had
traded at a 2-year of nearly $1.60 a pound.
   A weak recovery pushed the May contract back up above $1.35 by
March 17 but prices tumbled again in the past week as pre-meeting
jitters gripped the market. Coffee for May delivery plunged below
$1.27 by Wednesday and finished the week Thursday at $1.2859 a
pound. The market was closed on Friday.
   ``I think perhaps the market was overcome by pessimism
surrounding the ICO conference in London,'' said Arthur Stevenson,
an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. ``It
does not look like the two sides have really come a long way in
terms of bridging their differences.''
   The United Nations helped create the International Coffee
Organization in 1963 after coffee-producing nations had tried and
failed for many years to control coffee prices through self-imposed
export quotas and stockpiling.
   The International Coffee Organization's price-control system also
hinges on export quotas designed to keep prices within a range,
currently $1.20 to $1.40 a pound. The organization's consumer
members agree to observe the price floor and to limit their
purchases of coffee from non-ICO producers.
   The main issue facing delegates to next month's meeting is a
demand by consumer nations, of which the United States is the
largest, that the quota system be revamped to increase the
proportion of mild coffees to less-flavorful robusta coffees in the
overall export mix.
   The producer nations, of which Brazil is the largest, object to
that demand on the grounds that growers of robusta coffees need
protection in the face of steadily declining coffee consumption.
   According to the International Coffee Organization, per capita
coffee consumption in the United States fell to 1.67 cups a day in
1988 from 3.12 cups a day in 1962. The percentage of coffee drinkers
in the U.S. population dropped to 50 percent from nearly 75 percent
during the same period.
   So fiercely have the two sides clung to their positions that both
the United States and Brazil have threatened in previous meetings to
drop out of the International Coffee Organization at the end of the
current agreement. Analysts say the organization could not survive
without the participation of both countries.
   ``With an agreement (on quotas) we hold these price levels,''
said Bert Ruiz, a coffee broker with Balfour Maclaine Corp.
``Without an agreement, we're going downtown.''
   Here are some commodity price trends for the past week, which had
only four trading days due to the Easter holiday:
   Grain futures prices declined while soybean futures rose slightly
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat for delivery in May settled Thursday at $4.28\ a bushel,
down from $4.40{ on the previous Friday; May corn fell to $2.77} a
bushel from $2.82\; May oats dropped to $2.05\ a bushel from $2.12};
May soybeans rose to $7.84{ a bushel from $7.83{.
   Cattle futures advanced while pork futures retreated on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   April live cattle rallied to 78.20 cents a pound from 78.05
cents; April feeder cattle rose to 81.02 cents a pound from 80.42
cents; April live hogs dipped to 42.70 cents a pound from 43.65
cents; May frozen pork bellies slipped to 38.15 cents a pound from
38.17 cents.
   Gold and silver futures declined on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   April gold inched down to $393.40 a troy ounce from $393.60; May
silver skidded to $6.058 a troy ounce from $6.195.
   Energy futures gained on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil for May delivery rallied to
$20.15 a barrel from $19.48 a barrel; April heating oil surged to
56.52 cents a gallon from 53.57 cents; unleaded gasoline advanced to
58.02 cents a gallon from 55.62 cents.

<HEAD>Exotic, Futuristic Expositions the Latest Rage in Japan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Exotic birds, a space camp and azaleas are some of
the attractions tempting travelers this year as cities throughout
Japan join this country's latest fad: the exposition boom.
   On Saturday, the port of Yokohama opens its $775 million
centennial exposition, the Yokohama Exotic Showcase, featuring a
space camp for kids, French and American art collectons and a
high-tech train.
   Yokohama is one of 15 Japanese cities investing millions of
dollars on expositions they hope will attract more Japanese and
foreign visitors and give them a more cosmopolitan image.
   Throughout the spring and summer, Yokohama will be competing for
visitors with the Himeji Shirotopia Exposition 1989 in southern
Japan; Fukuoka's Asian-Pacific Exposition, called Yokatopia;
Yamagata's Omiyage (Souvenir) World and Nagoya's Design Expo '89,
among others.
   The Asian-Pacific Expo in Fukuoka on the southwestern island of
Kyushu is typical of Japanese expositions in that it offers a bit of
something for everyone _ including many attractions only loosely
related to its theme of ``The Quest for New Communication in Our
World.''
   Visitors to the seaside expo site can see Micronesian villages
and exotic Asian birds, watch a three-dimensional movie, ride a
ferris wheel and sample foods from other Asian nations.
   Organizers said they expect more than 6 million visitors to
Yokatopia, which opened March 17 and runs until Sept. 3.
   At Himeji's exposition, which started March 18, visitors can see
a 3-D documentary or wander through a historic commercial
``district'' near the majestic white castle that dominates the city.
   The expositions have the added benefit of giving some cities a
facelift. Fukuoka, for example, has spent millions of dollars to
improve transportation facilities, organizers said.
   Yokohama plans to use revenues from its anticipated 18 million
visitors to help fund a waterfront development project.
   A tally of organizers' estimates shows attendance at expositions
this year could be more than 36 million.
   But the many expositions connected with centennial celebrations
of Japanese cities has raised the risk that some will suffer from
the competition, particularly the smaller ones featuring such
attractions as azalea displays, souvenirs and food.
   Last year, of the 14 expositions staged throughout Japan, at
least two lost a lot of money. The Sapporo World Food Festival on
the northern island of Hokkaido reportedly lost more than $62
million and another festival near the Seto Bridge in southwestern
Japan lost $651,000.
   Expositions aren't cheap. Tickets for this year's events cost
between $9 and $21 for adults and $5 to $10 for students _ prices
that make family visits expensive.

<TEXT>
   A General Motors Corp. plant in Linden will
be shut down next week to reduce inventories of Chevrolet Corsica
and Beretta cars, affecting about 140 assembly line workers, the
company said Friday.
   ``It's been decided that we need a week to bring our inventory to
what it needs to be,'' GM spokeswoman Nettie Seabrooks said.
   Ward's Automotive Reports, a weekly trade journal, said that as
of Feb. 28, the company had a 103-day supply of the Corsica-Beretta
cars on hand. GM's inventory for new cars was 83 days compared with
the 78 days in the domestic industry, according to Ward's.
   Ms. Seabrooks said the shutdown would not affect the entire work
force because some employees would be training at the plant,
scheduled to resume production April 3.

<HEAD>IRS Modifies Diesel Tax Collection For Farmers, Off-Road Users</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service, bowing to
pressure from farm state lawmakers, announced Friday that it will
allow small wholesalers and some retailers to make sales of diesel
fuel without the payment of tax.
   In issuing its notice, the IRS agreed to lower the standards for
wholesaler distributors ad some retailers to qualify for an
exemption from the 15.1-cent-a-gallon tax for sales to farmers,
fishermen and others who buy diesel for off-road use.
   For example, one new standard will allow distributors to
automatically qualify for an exemption if at least 70 percent of
their bulk sales of diesel are to users who do not have to pay the
tax, such as farmers.
   A key change will define bulk sales as those of at least 25
gallons involving storage tanks of 50 gallons or more.
   That means under certain circumstances, small retailers can
qualify for a tax-exemption if 50 percent of their diesel sales are
for bulk amounts of at least 25 gallons.
   Before the change, diesel distributors generally had to charge
the tax unless at least 30 percent of bulk sales were in amounts of
at least 250 gallons. The policy drew many complaints.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., who had urged a change
for smaller operations, said the old standards were ``simply too
high for distributors in rural areas whose customers often live
20-30 miles away and drive trucks with fuel storage tank capacities
of less than 100 gallons.''
   The diesel fuel tax dispute stems from a 1987 law by Congress
that shifted collection of the tax from retail outlets to
wholesalers and producers. That revision caused a storm of protest
because it forced farmers and other off-road users of diesel to pay
the tax and then apply for a refund.
   Last year Congress tried to end the controversy by allowing
diesel purchased for off-road use from wholesalers to escape the
tax. However, purchases from retailers continued to be subject to
the tax. The latest IRS action sought to resolve continuing
complaints by modifying regulatory definitions to cover smaller
sales, including by retailers operating as bulk distributors.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shamrock Holdings Inc. may have lost its battle to
acquire Polaroid Corp., but it is likely to walk away with a $40
million profit before expenses, analysts estimated Friday.
   Polaroid has yet to claim victory, and Shamrock has not conceded
defeat, but Wall Street analysts said the eight-month fight for
control of the instant photography company was essentially over.
   Shamrock, which offered $45 a share for Polaroid stock, was
stymied Thursday by a Delaware court decision clearing the way for
Polaroid to repurchase 16 million shares for $50 each.
   Polaroid spokesman Sam Yanes said stockholders had tendered a
total of 58.6 million shares to the Cambridge-based company by
Thursday's midnight deadline.
   Since that is roughly four times more shares than Polaroid plans
to buy, the company will pro-rate the number of shares it accepts
from each stockholder. Based on preliminary calculations, it
expects to buy 27 percent of the shares tendered by each owner,
Yanes said.
   Shamrock, which amassed 4.95 million Polaroid shares during the
takeover battle, tendered all of its shares, said Michael Sitrick,
a spokesman for the Burbank, Calif.-based radio and television
concern.
   According to filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Shamrock paid an average of about $31 a share for its
stake in Polaroid. By selling 27 percent of its shares back to
Polaroid at $50 each, Shamrock can expect to receive approximately
$67 million.
   The value of Shamrock's remaining shares is uncertain because
many analysts expect Polaroid's stock, which closed Thursday at
$40.25 on the New York Stock Exchange, to slip to $38 or $37 a
share after the buyback, said Alex Henderson, an analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Still, Shamrock's remaining 3.6 million Polaroid shares would
conservatively be worth more than $130 million, yielding a profit
of approximately $42 million before legal fees and other expenses.
   Polaroid said the final number of shares tendered under the
buyback offer and the definitive pro-rating formula will be
determined April 4.
   Shamrock still has appeals pending before the Delaware Supreme
Court on Polaroid's employee stock ownership plan and its sale of
$300 million in stock to Corporate Partners, a New York City-based
investment group that supports Polaroid's current management.
   Shamrock has not called off its proxy fight for control over
Polaroid's board of directors, even though tendering its shares
under the buyback plan sharply decreases its chance of winning that
fight.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the headlines focus on inflation worries
and tighter credit, some Wall Street analysts are sticking with
their forecasts that interest rates are headed lower soon.
   They contend that the economy sent out signals in February that
it was beginning to slacken, even though the producer price index
of goods traded at the wholesale level jumped 1 percent for the
second straight month.
   And they maintain that more evidence of a slowdown in growth is
coming soon, helping to persuade both bond traders and the Federal
Reserve that further increases in interest rates aren't needed to
restrain inflation.
   On Wednesday the Commerce Department is scheduled to report the
index of leading economic indicators for February.
   Peter Greenbaum at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. projects
that the index, which is designed to detect future swings in the
economy, will post a drop of about 0.5 percent. That would mark the
first decline in five months.
   ``A modest uptrend in inflation rates has taken hold, but the
market may be exaggerating the potential extent of the rise,''
Smith Barney said in its economic commentary for the week ahead.
   ``February economic data have been surprisingly soft. The
market's preoccupation with inflation suggests that this may have
been overlooked.
   ``Will today's inflation fears give way to recession fears over
the next two quarters?''
   Recession fears might be something less than a balm for the
stock market, but they would logically stand to benefit the market
for Treasury bonds.
   If bond traders were expecting the economy to slacken, they
might well bid aggressively for government securities to profit
from any approaching decline in interest rates.
   Joseph Barthel, an analyst at Butcher &amp; Singer Inc., maintains
that ``evidence is mounting that during the second quarter an
important peak in interest rates should occur.''
   Barthel says one significant signal in this direction has been a
decline since last summer in commodity prices, as measured by the
Commodity Research Bureau's futures index.
   Many bond market participants watch commodity price indexes
closely as a guide to what future trends in inflation might look
like.
   Past peaks in interest rates have come about 10 months after the
CRB futures index crested, Barthel says.
   ``About nine months ago we forecasted that the second quarter of
1989 was likely to produce an important low'' for bond prices, he
says.
   ``Although recent inflation data would seem to argue that
interest rates must move higher, we stand by our earlier forecast.''
   Whether the problem was inflation and interest rate worries or
increased talk of a recession, the stock market showed little zip
in the past week, shortened by one trading day in observance of
Good Friday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 49.10
to 2,243.04.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.02 to 162.64;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market dropped
1.25 to 400.94, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was down 3.49 at 324.87.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 148.40 million shares a day,
down from 177.28 million the week before.
   Last Monday, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. made a modest shift from stocks
to cash in its guidelines for the allocation of investors' assets.
   ``Clearly, the pressure is on the Federal Reserve to tighten its
credit policy,'' said Charles Clough, Merrill's chief investment
strategist.
   ``However, we believe that most of the upward pressure on rates
will remain at the short end of the yield curve and that any move
up from here in long-term Treasury bond yields will be limited in
time and degree.
   ``We believe that this rise in long-term rates will prove to be
an opportunity to lock in attractive yields.''

   Shipments of Washington red apples fell
sharply last week, the biggest drop since a nationwide health scare
over a controversial growth additive began in late February, the
industry reported Friday.
   Shipments also dropped significantly in Michigan, another major
apple producing state.
   Total out-of-state shipments from Washington fell by 159,000
boxes compared with the week before, according to the weekly
figures compiled by the state Agriculture Department from
warehouses.
   Shipments of Red Delicious apples, the top-selling variety, fell
by 178,000 42-pound boxes, but the loss was offset by a jump in
sales of Granny Smith apples to fill the void left when Granny
Smiths from Chile were pulled from markets, officials said.
   Alar is used primarily on red apples, although the industry
contends that only 5 percent of the crop is sprayed with the growth
regulator.
   Based on Thursday's prices for the top three varieties, the
sales drop will cost Washington growers about $1.3 million for the
week.
   ``I think it's a combination of Alar and the general fear a lot
of people seem to have involving all produce right now,'' said Bill
DeWitt of the Wenatchee Valley Traffic Association, which tracks
shipments.
   The shipment figures are considered an accurate measure of
consumer sales.
   Apple warehouses in Washington shipped 1.25 million boxes
out-of-state last week, down 11.3 percent from 1.41 million boxes
the previous week and off 19.9 percent from the 1.56 million boxes
the week before that, DeWitt said.
   The warehouses shipped 1.64 million boxes during the third week
of March last year, he said.
   In Michigan, the Fruit and Vegetable Market News of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture and Michigan Department of Agriculture
said shipments for the week ending March 18 were 110,955 bushels,
down 30 percent from the 159,149 bushels shipped the week ending
March 4. A bushel of apples, the USDA says is from 42 to 50 pounds.
   For the week ending March 11, 133,762 bushels were shipped.
   In Washington, apple exports showed a 57,000-box drop, from
138,000 the week before to 81,000 boxes shipped last week, DeWitt
said.
   Much of that is the decision by Taiwanese importers, the
industry's largest offshore market, to reduce purchases of
Washington apples by around 30,000 boxes per week, DeWitt said.
   In addition, the industry generally begins to suffer from
reduced exports at this time of year because of competition from
newly harvested apples from Australia, New Zealand and Chile, he
said.
   Washington is the nation's largest apple producer and generally
supplies over three-quarters of the nation's supermarket apples
this time of year, said Walt Shields of the Yakima Valley
Growers-Shippers.
   ``This is the first week we've been down appreciably from a year
ago,'' Shields said.
   The second consecutive week of lower sales is bad news for an
industry that still has 40 percent of the fall crop in special cold
storage, Shields said.
   Those 24.6 million boxes must be sold by the time of the fall
harvest, he said.
   In the past two weeks, shipments of Washington apples to
retailers, wholesalers, institutional buyers, exporters and others
have dropped by a combined 311,000 boxes, following three
consecutive weeks of record shipments.
   Among the major varieties, Red Delicious apples again showed the
biggest drop, 178,000 boxes to 701,000 shipped.
   Golden Delicious apples dropped 16,000 boxes.
   But shipments of Granny Smith apples rose to 220,000 boxes, to
fill the void left when Granny Smiths from Chile were banned in the
wake of a cyanide scare.
   Granny Smith prices are also rising, from about $20 per box
several weeks ago to $26 per box Thursday, said Jeff Main of the
federal-state Market News Service office in Yakima.
   The apple industry's troubles began in late February when the
Natural Resources Defense Council, a consumer group issued a report
that eating apples treated with Alar increased the cancer risk in
children.
   That report has been disputed by federal regulators and the
apple industry, but nevertheless prompted apple bans in school
cafeterias, cancelation of some foreign orders and reduced retail
sales.

<HEAD>Government Proposes Rule Change on Partly Cooked Chicken Strips</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department proposed on Friday
a change in federal rules to allow the manufacture of partially
cooked ``breakfast strips'' from poultry meat.
   Under the proposal, the poultry strips would have to be cooked
further by consumers to kill any food poisoning bacteria that the
product might contain.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said the change was sought by a
processor, Swift Echrich Inc. Poultry strips, he said, would
provide an alternative to beef strips and pork bacon.
   ``Some consumers may be interested in this type of product as a
lower fat alternative to traditional bacon, or because of religious
or dietary reasons'' he said.
   Current rules require that cooking temperatures for processed
poultry be an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit, or
155 degrees for cooked, cured products, to kill salmonella and any
other harmful organisms that might be present.
   Those heat levels are too high to successfully process a thin
breakfast strip, Crawford said.
   Under the proposal, the strips would be processed at 140 degress
and then cooled rapidly after production. The rapid cooling and the
curing process should inhibit the growth of food poisoning
bacteria, he said.
   Additionally, the poultry strips would have to carry specific
labeling instructions ``to assure that consumers know this product
must be further cooked before eating,'' Crawford said. The
instructions would tell consumers to cook the product until it is
well done.

   O'Hare International has reclaimed its
distinction as the world's busiest airport, according to statistics
that show it logged more traffic last year than Atlanta's
Hartsfield International.
   O'Hare served 58.9 million passengers, while Atlanta handled
45.9 million, according to the statistics from the Chicago
Department of Aviation, and the Chicago airport logged a record
803,453 departures and landings, to Hartsfield's 778,779.
   In 1987, Atlanta had 796,600 departures and arrivals _ about
4,000 more than O'Hare _ although the Chicago airport handled more
passengers, by 58.8 million to 47.5 million.
   John Braden, a Hartsfield spokesman, said a major reason for the
drop in traffic there was a decline in discounted fares and service
cuts by Eastern Airlines, a big Atlanta tenant.

<TEXT>
   Hurt by slumping sales, Yankee Publishing
Inc., publisher of the Old Farmer's Almanac, plans to lay off a
third of its employees and sell a book division and New England
Business magazine.
   Last year, the 54-year-old company sold two magazines, Texas
Business and ASTA Agency Management.
   President Joseph Meagher said sales dropped from $50 million in
1987 to $40 million last year, but he declined to disclose profit
and loss figures.
   ``It was not a good year,'' Meagher told the Keene Sentinel, but
he added that the company is financially healthy. He said he
expected finances to improve once the company consolidates.
   Besides publishing the Old Farmer's Almanac, with a circulation
of 3 million nationwide, the company publishes Yankee magazine,
which sells 1 million copies each month; Yankee Travel, with an
annual circulation of 200,000; Yankee Homes, 35,000 monthly
circulation, and Alaska, 235,000 monthly circulation.
   Meagher said New England Business, with a free circulation of
90,000 monthly, is a ``break-even'' publication. The book division,
which puts out six mostly non-fiction books a year on topics such
as cooking and photography, is profitable, Meagher said, but the
company wants to focus on regional magazines.
   Starting April 1, 68 employees who handled Yankee subscriptions
will be laid off and the work handled by a subcontractor, and on
July 1, the 16-person graphics department will be closed and the
work done by outside companies at less cost, Meagher said.

<HEAD>The Way Through San Jose Is By Trolley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an age of space shuttles and
supersonic jets, trolleys are making a comeback in America, part of
a multibillion dollar effort to reduce traffic, boost business and
make cities more civilized.
   San Jose, in the high-tech world of Silicon Valley, is the
latest to install an electric trolley system and endure the
discomfort of digging up streets to lay track.
   Similar light-rail systems are rolling through Buffalo, N.Y.,
Sacramento, Calif., Portland, Ore., and San Diego. Systems are
planned in Fort Worth, Texas, Seattle and Los Angeles.
   Though they lack the history of streetcars in New Orleans,
Philadelphia and Newark, N.J., the quaint cable cars in San
Francisco or the defunct systems in New York, Cleveland and
Pittsburgh, the new trolleys are quiet and reliable.
   San Jose's system revives an old idea. Trolleys ran along 126
miles of track throughout the Santa Clara Valley from the 1880s
until the late 1930s.
   Half of Santa Clara County's new $552 million light-rail line
began operating 15 months ago in San Jose and Santa Clara. The
other half, which will reach bedroom communities and giant
International Business Machines Corp. in South San Jose, is
expected to be completed in August 1991, cutting a 20-mile swath
through the county.
   So far, the sleek, steel-wheeled white cars, which draw
electrical power from overhead wires via antenna-like poles, have
performed well and generally pleased riders. Ticket machines, with
instructions in English, Vietnamese and Spanish, are easy to use
and the prices are as low as 25 cents during lunchtime and 75 cents
other hours.
   ``I just ride for the fun of it,'' said Art Esparza, 33, who
cruises through the city, between downtown San Jose and the Great
America amusement park in Santa Clara, after getting off his early
morning job. ``It's like a Sunday drive.''
   The problems that have plagued the system, however, could serve
as a warning to other cities considering trolleys.
   A $140 million cost overrun, accidents, business disruptions,
traffic jams, lawsuits, and accusations of mismanagement, bribery
and embezzlement all were part of the trauma of building the
light-rail line and transit mall.
   The transit mall contractor and his wife face federal tax
evasion charges stemming from alleged misuse of mall funds from a
$29.7 million contract with the county. The defendants have denied
the charges.
   Some of the light rail's problems were unique to San Jose, a
city founded in 1777 but searching for an identity after changing
from the center of an agricultural community to a part of
high-powered Silicon Valley. The city's population is closing in
fast on San Francisco's 740,000, but San Jose still lacks the
glamor, prestige and fame of its neighbor 50 miles north.
   Downtown San Jose deteriorated and the city's cohesiveness
suffered as it sprawled in different directions with new companies
and tract homes. Most fruit orchards vanished and the roads clogged
with cars.
   Voters repeatedly told pollsters over the last 10 years that
traffic was the area's worst problem. So light rail supporters sold
it to the public on the promise it would reduce traffic, attract
shoppers and tourists, helping the area gain a reputation as
progressive, livable community with great weather.
   The only promise kept so far has been the weather.
   The light-rail line is criticized by those disappointed in the
lack of quick improvement in downtown business and those who would
rather have used transportation funds for highway improvement.
   ``The bitterest pill of all is the delay of constructing the
freeways for a year or two after the light rail is finished,'' said
Dave Fadness, a critic of the line and chairman of the Santa Clara
County Transportation Commission. ``If the general public knew what
the politicians were doing, there would be a real hue and cry.''
   Ernest Glave, president of the Greater San Jose Business
Association and a jeweler in the city for 41 years, also has been a
persistent critic of the light rail because he thinks it doesn't
help solve the downtown problems.
   ``We've still got no attraction, nothing to draw people to,'' he
said. He argues that the system is increasing traffic congestion
rather than reducing it and is discouraging shoppers who would
drive to the city.
   Some shopkeepers, though, are doing very well. ``We've been
swamped,'' said Mario Chaidez, manager of the year-old Cobbler's
Bench, a shoe repair shop. ``At lunchtime, we've got people waiting
on line.''
   Rod Diridon, a county supervisors who's been dubbed the ``father
of the light rail,'' calls the line ``a resounding success,'' even
though it cost more than three times the $176 million spent on the
18-mile system that opened in Sacramento two years ago.
   The 6,300 rides per day on the Santa Clara County system over
the last six months, he notes, are more than double the original
forecast by transit engineers for the first half of the line.
   ``The only complaints are from the people who run red lights and
run into it,'' Diridon said.

<HEAD>Lockhead Faces $1.5 Million Fine For Safety Violations At Military
Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Friday proposed fining the
military aircraft division of Lockheed Corp. $1.5 million for
worker-safety violations at the California plant where it builds
the radar-evading stealth fighter.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration said it is
also starting a ``wall-to-wall'' inspection of the entire Burbank,
Calif., facility because of the more than 400 violations uncovered
during a four-month investigation of a classified area where the
fighter is assembled.
   Under OSHA procedures, Lockheed has 15 working days to contest
the proposed fine. Lockheed spokeman Jim Ragsdale said the company
had no immediate comment on the alleged violations and likely would
not comment until its management had an opportunity to review the
citations.
   OSHA cited 251 instances in which it said Lockheed Aeronautical
Systems Co. willfully failed to record illnesses and injuries to
employees and 88 alleged willful violations of federal regulations
requiring employers to inform workers about the potential dangers
of chemicals they work with and instruct them on proper safeguards.
   In addition, the company was cited for another 99 violations of
various OSHA standards, including alleged mislabeling or failure to
label chemical containers and alleged failure to include health
warnings on information the company was required to provide to its
workers.
   Other alleged violations included failing to list suspected
carcinogens on safety sheets provided to workers, overexposing
workers to asbestos and failure to provide workers with gloves
impervious to a hazardous chemical used on the fighter.
   The proposed fine follows a highly publicized OSHA inspection
that followed numerous complaints from workers at the plant, which
employs about 14,000 people.
   In October, a month after the inspection began, John C.
Brizendine, the president of the division, said: ``We have seen
nothing to indicate the materials we work with are fundamentally
unsafe of pose a health hazard provided proper procedures are
followed.''
   A month later, the government for the first time publicly
acknowledged the existence of the stealth fighter, a single-seat,
dual-engine jet that resembles a bat and is formally designated the
F-117A.
   The Defense Department has ordered 59 stealth fihters; 52 had
been delivered as of the November announcement.
   The fighter uses so-called stealth technology to help it evade
enemy radar, including radar-absorbing materials and other coatings.
   Seventy-five employees at the Burbank plant have a suit pending
against Lockheed and companies that make and supply the chemicals
used to help the fighter avoid radar detection. More than 100
workers have filed workers compensation claims alleging they suffer
from injuries caused by the chemicals.
   The suit and the claims allege composite materials used in the
fighter and chemicals used to mill and clean those materials cause
rashes, nausea, dizziness, memory loss and concentration problems.
   OSHA spokesman Frank Kane said the $1.49 million fine
represented the ninth-largest in the agency's 17-year history and
the largest ever levied in California. The record fine was $5.1
million against two companies involved in an April 1987 Bridgeport,
Conn., building collapse.

<HEAD>New CEO `Up To Eyeballs' Learning Company; Asset Sales Said Likely</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a few days remaining before he begins work
as the new head of RJR Nabisco Inc., Louis V. Gerstner was said to
be absorbed in learning about his new company and analysts
suggested he would take office ready to sell some of the tobacco
and food giant's assets.
   Gerstner, who takes over as chairman and chief executive officer
of the Atlanta-based RJR Nabisco April 3, has not said what his
specific plans are for the company, recently acquired by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. for $24.53 billion, the largest debt-financed
takeover in history.
   But analysts say Gerstner, who is leaving as president of
American Express Co. to head RJR Nabisco, probably will decide to
sell some of the company's brands to raise money to help pay off
the debt, including $3 billion in annual interest payments, picked
up by KKR with the acquisition.
   ``I think that's very much the case,'' said Emanuel Goldman, an
industry analyst with PaineWebber Group Inc. in San Francisco.
``That, I think, is in the forefront (to reduce the debt)...to sell
for as much as you can as quickly as you can.''
   Layoffs are possible but not certain, Goldman said. Personnel
moves could come after RJR Nabisco's divestiture _ with the new
owners of whatever divisions are sold making the decisions, he said.
   RJR Reynolds Tobacco USA, a subsidiary, announced last week that
about 700 employees will be offered early retirement enhancements
or cash incentives to leave their jobs voluntarily. But the move to
cut the workforce stemed from the failure of RJR's smokeless
cigarettes, not the KKR takeover.
   Goldman said the RJR Nabisco assets likely for sale _ including
Del Monte Foods and Planters-Life Savers _ are attractive holdings.
   ``Look at the cookies, the crackers, Del Monte, Planters, Life
Savers. This is not so bad. You have the creme de la creme of some
of the business,'' he said.
   ``I don't think they'll know what they'll end up selling until
they see what their actual value is,'' Goldman added.
   KKR has retained Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., reportedly to study a
possible sale of the RJR Nabisco subsidiary Del Monte.
   On March 13, the day KKR announced his appointment, Gerstner
said his new job was ``the greatest challenge in corporate
America.'' Since then, the native of Long Island, N.Y., has
declined requests for interviews.
   Pauline A. Howes, a spokeswoman for RJR Nabisco in Atlanta,
said, ``For the time being, he's up to his eyeballs in RJR Nabisco
immersion. He's going to take a month or two to get settled and
learn more about the company's operations.''
   Gerstner, at this point, won't publicly reveal his vision for
the company, Ms. Howes said.
   Financial concerns aside, asset sales are considered likely
because the Federal Trade Commission required some as part of the
regulatory approval process for the takeover.
   The FTC, responsible for preventing monopolies by enforcing
antitrust laws, said it would not challenge the takeover if KKR
within a year sells:
   _The Chun King oriental food line of RJR Nabisco or the La Choy
line of Beatrice-Hunt-Wesson Inc., a unit of KKR.
   _The Planters nuts line of RJR Nabisco or the Fisher nuts line
of Beatrice.
   _RJR Nabisco's Del Monte ketchup or Beatrice's Hunt ketchup.
   The commission said unless those units were divested, the
combined market share could result in unfair consumer pricing.
Together, RJR Nabisco and KKR's prior holdings account for
one-eighth of the food sold in U.S. supermarkets.
   Goldman said there is no doubt the FTC directive will be
followed, but he said the specific items named by the government do
not amount to a major portion of the company's business.
   Gerstner replaces the aggressive, flamboyant CEO F. Ross
Johnson, who left RJR Nabisco after losing to KKR in the
high-stakes takeover battle. Gerstner, 47, hugely successful during
his 11 years at American Express, has been described as a
methodical executive unafraid of shaking up a company.
   He reportedly will start at RJR Nabisco with a $2.3 million
annual salary and has received a signing bonus of more than $10
million.
   Lawrence Adelman, a tobacco industry analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds in New York, said that Gerstner is coming into a company
that already is ``very well run'' and he should not face any
immediate crises.
   ``Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has a lot of experience in the food
area,'' he added. ``It's not new to them, though it's new to him
(Gerstner). I'm sure he'll zero in and try to maximize his
opportunities.''
   Other analysts have said Gerstner's immediate tasks include
giving RJR Nabisco employees a firm sense of direction in the wake
of last year's bruising takeover fight and reversing the company's
loss, over the last few years, of its share of the domestic tobacco
market.
   If RJR Nabisco sells some food lines, tobacco will become even
more important because it will command a larger chunk of the
company's earnings, said John G. Nelson, an industry analyst with
Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. Currently, tobacco accounts
for about two-thirds of RJR Nabisco income.
   Also on the horizon could be a move of the company's
headquarters from Atlanta. A relocation to RJR Nabisco's former
home in Winston-Salem, N.C., has been rumored for months.
   Johnson moved RJR Nabisco from Winston-Salem, its home for more
than 100 years, to suburban Atlanta in 1987.

<TEXT>
   An Eastern Airlines flight attendant with 21
years' experience has her own plan to get striking employees back
to work.
   Marsha Atkins of Watkinsville, Ga., is filing a motion asking
U.S. Bankruptcy Court to appoint a supplemental trustee to run the
airline and to allow workers to return immediately at reduced pay.
   The motion, which her attorney husband Samuel Atkins sent to the
court on Thursday, suggests that thousands of striking Eastern
employees want to return to work, as long as it's not for Texas Air
Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo.
   ``Even though they're frustrated not working, they'd rather be
frustrated than working for Lorenzo,'' Samuel Atkins said in a
telephone interview Friday.
   Under Atkins' plan, if the court appointed a trustee to run the
airline instead of Lorenzo, who runs Eastern's parent carrier,
workers could return at 75 percent of pre-strike pay. The remaining
25 percent of their pay would accrue until Eastern reorganized
under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws.
   ``I was sort of frustrated by nothing happening in the case. She
was too,'' Samuel Atkins said. ``Everyone was trying to do
something to help the attorneys and the investment bankers. But no
one wants to do anything for the employees. They want to go back to
work.''
   Eastern's Machinists struck the carrier March 4 and pilots and
flight attendants are honoring the walkout. The airline sought
Chapter 11 protection from creditors on March 9.
   Eastern's pilots and Machinists already have asked Bankruptcy
Judge Burton R. Lifland to appoint a trustee to run the airline's
day-to-day operations, removing company management from that role.
   A clerk for Lifland said Friday that she was unaware of the
Atkins motion.
   Atkins said his wife was filing as a creditor owed $858.21 in
back pay.
   Lifland has scheduled an April 7 hearing on the pilots' trustee
request. Atkins said he hoped to bring a busload of employees from
Georgia to attend the hearing, at which he expects his motion to be
heard.
   Atkins, who lives in a town with a population of 2,000 about 60
miles northeast of Atlanta, admitted that a motion by one employee
was a tiny cry in proceedings dominated by powerful union and
corporate players.
   ``It's highly unusual,'' he said. ``This is an unusual case
anyway. We though it was worth a shot. It was definitely in the
public interest.''

<HEAD>Uproar Over FSX Reflects Tougher Attitudes Toward Japan</HEAD>

   American opinion leaders who favor a more
nationalist trade policy have found a cause celebre in President
Bush's plan to share U.S. fighter aircraft technology with Japan.
   Opposition to the FSX fighter deal has galvanized lawmakers,
executives, academics and others who say the United States should
discard its devotion to free trade and adopt Japanese-style measures.
   For a change, opposition to aspects of the jet fighter deal have
come not only from lobbyists and think tankers, but from prominent
figures in Bush's own administration, including Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher.
   The ferocity of the FSX debate marks it as a turning point in
American attitudes toward competition with Japan _ reshaped by the
persistent trade deficit and rivalries in semiconductors,
high-definition television and superconductivity.
   ``There is no doubt that the FSX issue is important, in that it's
the first evidence that some elements of the U.S. government are
starting to come to grips intellectually with the challenge of
Japan,'' said Chalmers Johnson, a professor of Asian studies at the
University of California at San Diego.
   ``For the first time in the postwar world, instead of trying make
the Japanese look like us, we are behaving ever so slightly like the
Japanese,'' Johnson said.
   Under the agreement signed late last year, St. Louis-based
General Dynamics Corp. would join forces with Japan's Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries to develop and produce the FSX, an advanced version
of the U.S. F-16 fighter.
   President Bush last week said he endorsed the deal, but agreed to
insist on modifications to safeguard U.S. technology and assure
American industry has a share in the plane's production.
   Some opponents say Japan should simply buy F-16s, which would be
cheaper for Japan and help shrink the U.S. trade deficit. Japan has
refused to do that, but only because it was not pushed to the limit,
they say.
   So far the debate hasn't led to bitter displays of emotion, like
last year's fury over Toshiba Machine Co.'s illegal sales to the
Soviet Union, which led congressmen to smash Toshiba radios outside
the Capitol.
   But as with any good rallying issue, the FSX reflects bigger
concerns, including the loss of America's high-technology leadership
and the dominance of military considerations in American foreign
policy.
   ``There's a sense of frustration in the country,'' said Kevin
King, editor of ``Japan Bashing Alert,'' which tracks comments about
Japan in 1,500 U.S. publications on behalf of Dentsu, of Japan, the
world's largest advertising agency.
   ``The aerospace is such a sensitive issue because it's the last
industry which we can safely say we still dominate,'' King said.
   In Washington, the seismic change in opinion has split the
Commerce Department, which promotes U.S. commercial interests, apart
from the State and Defense departments, which put global security
issues first.
   The Commerce Department's star is slowly rising, although the
adjustment ``is still lagging behind events,'' said Ernest H. Preeg,
a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington.
   A leader in the fight against the FSX, Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr.,
gave intellectual respectability to the cause of managed trade last
year in a book called ``Trading Places: How We Allowed Japan to Take
the Lead.''
   Prestowitz, a former U.S. trade negotiator, compared Americans to
lonesome cowboys and Japanese to settlers: ``Under attack they
circle the wagons together and take on all comers. And win.''
   The United States cannot be a free trader when Japan blocks
advanced American products from its own market while developing
competing products of its own, as in the case of supercomputers,
some of the new interventionists say.
   ``We must begin to act like we were a developing nation,'' said
Kathryn Harrigan, a professor of strategic management at Columbia
University. ``Our false pride continues to make us ethnocentric
about where ideas come from.''
   In contrast to those who fear foreign investment, Ms. Harrigan
said she favors it as long as Americans benefit with good jobs.
   ``We want the critical tasks done on American soil, so Americans,
I don't care who they work for, manage to keep themselves on the
cutting edge,'' she said. ``In time of war, we (could) exercise our
sovereign control over property.''
   All this talk of managed trade and industrial policy troubles
free traders such as Edward Hudgins, director of the Center for
International Growth at the Heritage Foundation in Washington.
   ``There is no way we could set up that sort of a management
system in the United States. It's a very fierce, aggressive,
no-holds-barred competition of special interest groups here. We do
not have a sort of consensus culture as they do in Japan,'' Hudgins
said.
   But even Hudgins sees some Japanese things worth emulating. He
favors repealing most antitrust laws, eliminating taxes on earned
interest income to encourage savings, and breaking down the
distinction between commercial and investment banks.

<HEAD>Publisher Drops Proposed Merger With Boston Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed merger between American City
Business Journals Inc. of Kansas City and a Boston company has been
dropped, the publishing concern said Thursday.
   American City, which publishes the Kansas City Business Journal
and about two dozen other publications, said it had rejected a
revised buyout offer from TA Associates Communications of Boston.
   TA Associates first offered to buy American City in October in a
deal that would have provided shareholders with $21.25 a share in
cash plus unsecured notes. A revised offer last month would have
lowered the cash portion of the deal to $15 per share.
   Rapid expansion of American City left the publisher with large
financial losses and heavy debt, but the company had begun recently
to profit after closing some papers and making other cost savings.

<HEAD>For Polaroid Employees, Takeover Is Fearful Prospect</HEAD>

   If it worked for the Chicago Bears,
Polaroid employees figured, it might work for them too.
   So one day earlier this month, booming over the speakers in the
lunchroom at Polaroid's film plant in Norwood, Mass., came the
company's new fight song.
   ``Used to have it all,'' it goes. ``But one man has come. He
wants to break up what we've done. Cut out the heart, and take the
money and run.''
   While that ``one man'' remained nameless in the song, his
identity was no mystery to anyone at the instant-camera giant.
   The clear villain of the piece was Stanley Gold, president of
Shamrock Holdings Inc., the Burbank, Calif., company that launched a
hostile takeover bid for Polaroid last July.
   It appeared this past week the takeover battle might be over.
Unable to defeat Polaroid's defensive strategy in court, Shamrock
said it was selling its stock under a Polaroid share buyback plan.
But Shamrock didn't say it was giving up.
   Although Shamrock is owned by the family of Roy E. Disney, nephew
of the late Walt Disney, it was Gold, a 46-year-old Hollywood
entertainment lawyer turned takeover specialist, who came to
personify the threat to Polaroid workers.
   As the eight-month-old takeover battle became increasingly
bitter, preoccupying top executives and filling the rank-and-file
with apprehension, Polaroid workers united passionately in
opposition to Shamrock and Gold.
   Nearly 6,000 of the company's 8,300 employees in Massachusetts
signed petitions against the takeover. The Employees Committee, a
32-member group elected to represent workers, was solidly behind
Polaroid's current chief executive, I. MacAllister Booth.
   ``Basically, it comes down to this,'' said Committee Chairman
Nicholas R. Pasquarosa. ``We don't want anything to do with Stanley
Gold.''
   Shamrock said the personality of its president is irrelevant.
   ``Making it personal _ that's a public relations maneuver to
obscure the issues,'' said Shamrock spokesman John Grimaldi. ``You
create a straw man so everyone focuses on that instead of on the
poor management of Polaroid.''
   Yet the employee campaign against Gold, if it was one, was so
homespun it belied a Madison Avenue effort.
   The not-exactly-catchy fight song, for example, was recorded by
Carl Saunders, a 40-year-old Polaroid lab technician who ``played a
little guitar in the '60s'' but hasn't done much musically since.
   While he got lots of help from his wife, Cindy, their two
children and friends, Saunders said, Polaroid didn't contribute a
dime.
   What's more, he admitted, he dreamed up the song mainly to give
his 16-year-old daughter, Kerry, a boost toward a singing career.
   ``I just thought it might get her some exposure,'' he said.
   Employee attitudes have been an important element in the battle
for Polaroid, because they were also stockholders, controlling
nearly 14 percent of the company's stock through an employee stock
ownership plan.
   Their attitudes were clear. Throughout its Cambridge headquarters
and manufacturing plants, Polaroid employees wore or hawked $10
T-shirts. They come in a choice of six colors, but all bore the same
message: ``Polaroid Family Says No To Stanley.''
   At the headquarters, four beige brick buildings around a
courtyard called Technology Square, one of the most popular
gathering places was a bulletin board with the latest news Wall
Street takeover battles, including Polaroid's.
   Librarian Richard Gurner, who posted the clippings each day, said
the most sought-after books in the corporate library were also about
high finance, reflecting ``a tremendous thirst'' in employees to
understand what was happening to them.
   Rather than an orchestrated campaign, Gurner believed the anger
toward Gold results from employees' attempts to put the conflict
into comprehensible terms.
   ``We know it's not just one man, because the same thing is
happening to other companies,'' he said. ``But we see our jobs
threatened, the company we have built threatened, and he is the one
we blame.''

<HEAD>Formica Corp. Says Its Offered $20 Cash Per Share</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAYNE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Formica Corp., facing a bevy of buyout offers,
announced Thursday it received a $256 million bid that tops a $230.4
million tender offer from a management-led group.
   Formica officials declined to identify the company that made the
latest, $20-per-share cash offer, but said Formica's committee of
independent directors instructed Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. to
begin negotiations with the company.
   Last fall, Malcolm Glazer, a Rochester, N.Y., businessman offered
$20 a share in cash and securities for Formica and was rebuffed.
After the management group announced its offer, Glazer said he was
considering a new bid.
   However it was not known if the latest bid was from Glazer.
   Shearson also is continuing discussions with six other interested
third parties, Formica spokesman Robert Way said.
   The management group, FM Acquisition Corp., has offered $18 a
share for Formica, which manufactures laminated products used in
kitchen countertops, tables and cabinets.
   Formica has said its directors have approved a definitive merger
with FM, but they also told Shearson to see if others might be
interested in bidding.
   Formica stock fell $1 a share to $21 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading Wednesday.
   Glazer, who owns television stations, nursing homes and real
estate, dropped his bid in November after Formica President Vincent
P. Langone _ who heads the management group _ said the company
wasn't for sale.
   Glazer sold his 1.09 million-share stake in Formica last November
to Chicago-based Great American Realty Inc. It is not known if he
owns any Formica shares.
