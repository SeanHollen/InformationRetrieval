   Crack troops staged mock assaults at
the presidential palace to simulate a rescue of President Corazon
Aquino from an ambush Wednesday, while Mrs. Aquino warned extremists
against trying to topple her government.
   Mrs. Aquino gave her warning during the third anniversary
celebration of her elite Presidential Security Group at the
presidential grounds.
   In her speech, Mrs. Aquino cited the role of her security unit in
thwarting the Aug. 28, 1987 coup attempt, the most serious of at
least six attempts against her government.
   The failed coup, led by renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan, left
about 53 people dead and over 300 others seriously wounded. Mrs.
Aquino's son, Benigno III, was injured and three of his security
guards were killed.
   ``The August 28 coup failed because the Presidential Security
Group increased to an intolerable level the price the enemies of
freedom would have to pay to take power in this country,'' Mrs.
Aquino said. ``There would be no casual walk into the seat of power
for them. The way would be littered with their shattered ambitions,
their dead and our heroes.''
   Honasan was captured in December 1987 but escaped the following
April and has been in hiding since. Rumors swept the capital last
week that he was recruiting followers for a new attempt.
   Mrs. Aquino said the ability of her security men to withstand
attacks had stalled several other attempts against her.
   During one exercise, an eight-man security team staged a mock
assault on a building. They charged from an armored personnel
carrier and entered the ground floor of a building supposedly seized
by renegade soldiers.
   In another, hooded members of an assault team stormed a bus which
the scenario said had been taken over by terrorists. Team members
used wooden ladders to scale the side of the bus, smashed the
windows with axes and pointed weapons inside.
   A third exercise simulated an ambush on Mrs. Aquino's limousine.
Troops simulated firing at the terrorists while loyal troops sped
the car to a helipad where a woman pretending to be the president
was helicoptered to safety.

   One policeman was killed and eight people were
wounded as leftist guerrillas carried out a dozen attacks in Lima,
half of them against offices of the governing center-left Aprista
Party, authorities said Tuesday.
   Elsewhere, police in the jungle town of Mazamari, 195 miles east
of Lima, shot and killed two men on a motorcycle late Sunday after
they ignored an order to stop.
   Police said the men were suspected of belonging to the
Mao-inspired Shining Path guerrilla group and were carrying dynamite.
   Police said Shining Path guerrillas bombed the six political
offices shortly before midnight Monday as their answer to President
Alan Garcia's vow to step up the battle against insurgency.
   Five Aprista members were wounded by flying glass and blast
fragments, police said.
   In a simultaneous attack, rebels from the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement fired on a patrol car from a passing car,
killing one officer and wounding his partner and two passers-by,
police said.
   The two rebel bands are not known to be linked and police called
the simultaneous attacks a coincidence.
   Shining Path guerrillas also tossed bombs at a bank, a police
post, a suburban municipal building and the home of an Aprista
member, causing minor damage but no casualties, police said.
   Maoist saboteurs also toppled a power pylon with explosives,
briefly blacking out a few zones in the city, police said.
   More than 12,000 people have died in the Shining Path's nine-year
insurgency to impose Marxist rule.
   The smaller Tupac Amaru group began attacks five years ago.

   Texas cattle broker Gretchen Polhemus claimed
the Miss USA crown Tuesday night, making it the fifth year in a row
a Texan has won the beauty pageant.
   ``It's absolutely wonderful,'' said the 23-year-old Fort Worth
beauty.
   She said she had expected Miss Oklahoma Jill Scheffert to win the
pageant, but, ``This was my year.'' Miss Scheffert, 20, of Oklahoma
was the first runner-up.
   The other finalists were, in order, Miss New Jersey Deborah Lee
Husti of Rockaway, N.J.; Miss Louisiana Elizabeth Primm of Houma,
La.; and Miss Georgia Michele Nemeth of Lilburn, Ga.
   Miss Polhemus was crowned at the conclusion of a dazzling,
internationally televised production from the Mobile Civic Center.
   A home-state delegation waved the Texas state flag in victory
when emcee Dick Clark announced the winner. Actress Angie Dickinson
was co-emcee of the two-hour pageant attended by 1,200 people.
   In her biography, the 5-foot-11, green-eyed new Miss USA said she
will pursue an entertainment career while continuing her current
real estate business and livestock broker business in Fort Worth.
   The program was highlighted by a dance number with broadway star
Tommy Tune and the 51 contestants stepping out to, ``Is It True What
They Say About Dixie?''
   The swimsuit display brought out hot pink and an array of colors
as the 10 semifinalists showed off one-piece swimsuits.
   The 51 women from every state and the District of Columbia
competed in categories of swimsuit and evening gown, where the focus
was partly on physique.
   However, celebrity judges said that the contestants' personal
interviews were where they revealed the best of their personalities.
   ``You want beauty, but there's a lot more to it _ like strength
and stamina,'' author Jude Deveraux said, prior to the judging.
   ``Personality, intellect, charisma, and endurance are
important,'' added judge Bonnie Kay, president of Select Model
Management of New York. ``Outer beauty counts 50 percent.''
   The judges were responding to criticism of the event from the
National Organization for Women, which denounced the two-hour
pageant as a ``Barbie doll contest.''
   ``We call for programs that encourage the development of the
whole woman. We call on society to value women for their
intellectual, charitable, athletic and artistic achievements,'' said
Betty Gartman, president of the local NOW chapter.
   The pageant winner will inherit the crown from Miss USA Courtney
Gibbs, 22. The winner will receive $200,000 in cash and prizes.
   Others on the 11-member judging panel were: Dick Rutan and Jeana
Yeager, pilots of the experimental Voyager aircraft; actress Stella
Stevens; tennis player Roscoe Tanner; Linda Shelton, an aerobics
instructor; Lillian Glass, author of ``Talk to Win;'' actor Richard
Anderson; Cecilia Bolocco, Miss Universe 1987; and former Olympic
diver Jennifer Chandler.

   Alicechandra Fritz comes from a long
line of Mount Holyoke students, the longest, in fact, in the
college's 152-year history.
   The 18-year-old freshman from Berkeley, Calif., extended the
streak to six generations when she enrolled, said Vee Wailgum,
spokeswoman for the women's college.
   The first was her great-great-great grandmother, Mary Ballantine
Fairbank, class of 1855.
   Including aunts, great-aunts and distant cousins, Fritz' family
has sent 55 women to the school founded in 1837.
   Fritz and her mother, Margaret Conkey, insisted they were not
forced to go to the school. ``Whatever pressure there was, it did
not mandate that we go to Mount Holyoke,'' said Ms. Conkey.

   About 35 people marched Monday in support
of the three animal rights activists who have spent the past week
atop a 160-foot crane to protest construction of a new university
animal research facility.
   University of California officials said they planned to seek jail
terms and fines for the crane sitters if they continue to defy
orders to come down, and estimated the protest was costing the
school $30,000 a day.
   The three protesters offered Sunday to come down if the
university dropped all charges against them, but school officials
refused.
   ``If we cave in to this kind of behavior to people who behave
like terrorists, then we're subject to this kind of behavior at
every turn,'' said Assistant Chancellor John Cummins. ``We're going
to wait them out. They'll get tired and they'll come down.''
   Jonnie Vermont, who climbed down from the crane Friday, told
supporters, ``If they're (the university) going to pay hardball,
we're going to play hardball.''
   A protester identified only as Lee climbed the crane Sunday with
the use of a mountain-climbing harness, blowing kisses and eating an
orange while dangling from a 20-foot rope.
   The protesters originally numbered six when they climbed the
crane last Tuesday. Four climbed down, but one went back with a
backpack of food and water Saturday. Since Saturday, campus police
have occupied the cab of the crane.
   ``We have no illusions that we are going to halt construction of
the facility for good,'' said Todd Paterson, who came down from the
crane after more than 84 hours. ``But we have been able to draw
attention to the issue and to let people know how dangerous this
would be.''
   Animal rights activists contend the lab will be used to conduct
cruel and unnecessary experiments on animals, is located dangerously
close to an earthquake fault and could release toxic material into
the environment.
   A counter-protest was held across the street from Monday's
demonstration.
   ``Animal researchers are as humane as anyone. And we make sure
the animals are not mistreated and abused ... that's all their own
fantasies,'' university physiology professor Charles Nicoll of the
Coalition for Animals and Animal Research said at the
counter-demonstration.
   The university won a court ruling Friday that ordered a halt to
the protest. Attorneys plan to return to court Tuesday to seek
30-day jail terms or $500 fines for protesters who resist.
   University spokesman Ray Colvig said there were no plans to try
to storm the crane and forcibly remove demonstrators because of the
potential danger.
   Howard Lichtig, a Castro Valley attorney representing the
demonstrators, said the university was being unreasonable.
   ``The university has foreclosed negotiations,'' he said.

<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Massachusetts has
rescinded an order banning five conservative clubs at the school
from renting meeting rooms and vending tables at the Campus Center,
a spokeswoman said Monday.
   However, the campus Republican Club and an affiliate of a
Cambridge-based Marxist group, the Spartacist League, remain under
the ban because of a brawl between members of those groups at the
school Feb. 9, said spokeswoman Jeanne Hopkins.
   A student was injured in the fight, which was the second
confrontation between the groups in a month. The head of the school
buildings departemnt is investigating the incident.
   Hopkins said the ban had been widened to other conservative
student groups because they were suspected of renting rooms for the
Republican Club in defiance of the ban.
   The school lifted the ban against the other groups on Friday.
Hopkins said the Office of Student Affairs felt the ban ``wasn't the
most appropriate way to handle the situation.''
   An attorney for the Republican Club said he believed the ban was
a violation of the club's right of free speech and assembly and that
he was speaking with university attorneys about lifting it.
   ``I believe if we went into court, it would say that the
university deprived the group of its rights,'' said Attorney Les
Black.

<HEAD>Fang's Treatment Shows Government-Intellectual Tension</HEAD>

   China's barring of its best-known dissident from a
banquet given by President Bush dramatizes the growing tension
between authorities and intellectuals clamoring for a voice in
modernization.
   It also illustrates how China's desire to build bridges to the
outside world clashes with its authoritarian tradition.
   The deployment of an estimated 100 police to stop Fang Lizhi from
making it to Bush's banquet Sunday could only have been ordered by
the highest level of leadership _ the Communist Party Central
Committee, or even senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Deng has particular reason to dislike Fang: the 53-year-old
astrophysicist recently sent him a letter calling for the release of
political prisoners, especially Wei Jingsheng, who has been jailed
since 1979 for criticizing Deng.
   Fang has beome a hero to many intellectuals, especially students,
because he dares say that economic and scientific progress is
impossible without freedom of expression.
   Despite China's increased prosperity under Deng, intellectuals
have become increasingly disaffected because they believe China
cannot ever catch up to developed countries unless the government
allows more open exchanges of ideas.
   Fang's harassment _ he had been invited by Bush _ appears a
signal that the leadership is fumbling for a policy toward the
troublesome intellectuals. It contradicts recent signs that a
gradual liberalization might be permitted.
   A two-year freeze followed the last burst of dissident activity,
but a new ferment of intellectual debate emerged late last year in
the arts and among social scientists.
   Growing numbers of informal discussion groups have popped up in
the cities, and artists have held daring new exhibits of nudes and
avant-garde paintings.
   Scholarly journals have published searching essays on China's
national character, its recent past and new interpretations of
socialism.
   No action has been taken against any of the government critics,
but top officials have expressed displeasure with the clamor.
   They have stressed in recent speeches the need for social order,
a message they reiterated in strong language in meetings with Bush.
   Fang's treatment supports the view that China's conservatives
have gained the upper hand over reformists led by party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang.
   Most evidence for this comes in the economic field, where since
September the government has reimposed a wide range of controls over
the economy that had been lifted during a decade-long effort to
stimulate growth.
   Chinese leaders do not support Fang's premise that free debate
across all fields is necessary for economic modernization. They have
indicated support for some limited debate on the best solutions for
China's current economic woes, doubtless in hopes that someone will
come up with a good idea.
   But generally, they regard public debate as destabilizing and a
possible threat to their hold on power.
   Few intellectuals believe that the police action against Fang
heralds the start of a full-blown campaign against liberalism, such
as has recurred regularly since the Communists came to power in 1949.
   But they say the move is troubling, if only because of its
apparent clumsiness coming during a U.S. presidential visit that was
supposed to celebrate the two country's 10 years of friendly
relations.
   ``It was crazy, stupid,'' said Fang's wife, Li Shuxian.
   Fang said he would not be silenced and predicted, ``More and more
intellectuals will speak the truth.''
   The confrontation between the government and scholars may come to
a head on May 4, the 70th anniversary of the start a major
intellectual movement for democracy, scientific thought and
nationalism.
   Beijing University students already have begun a countdown.

   Miss Minnesota Julie Knutson may not
have a chip on her shoulder but tonight she'll parade in an evening
gown made entirely of computer chips during the Miss USA beauty
pageant.
   The chip couture is the product of Minneapolis-based Cray
Research Inc., a supercomputer manufacturer with operations in this
Wisconsin town.
   The chips used to create the dress to be worn by Miss Knutson are
scrap components from Cray's manufacturing areas, Cray spokeswoman
Tina Bonetti said.
   A Minneapolis dress designer, with some input from Cray, designed
the gown.
   The top of the dress alone weighs 30 pounds, Bonetti said.
   One requirement of tonight's pageant in Mobile, Ala., is that
each contestant wear a costume that illustrates something related to
her home state. Miss Minnesota chose to go high tech because of all
the high tech industries headquartered in Minnesota, including Cray,
Control Data Corp., and Honeywell, Bonetti said.

   The opposition crumbled and the Legislature
declared the ``bizcochito'' the official cookie of New Mexico.
   The controversy wasn't over whether the light, sugary confection
should be the state cookie, but how to spell it. The tug of war
continued until the final vote Monday in the House of
Representatives, as it concurred with the spelling preferred by the
Senate.
   The bill now goes to Gov. Garrey Carruthers, whose preference is
unknown.
   Ever since the bill was introduced, there was a disagreement over
whether the cookie should be spelled ``bizcochito,'' or
``biscochito.''
   Legislation introduced several weeks ago by Rep. Edward Sandoval
would have made the ``biscochito'' the official cookie.
   But Spanish-language purists insisted the proper spelling was
with a ``z.''
   Legislators seesawed on the spelling, finally approving
``bizcochito.''
   Sandoval was neutral. He said he had reviewed several cookbooks
and ``three had it one way and three had it the other.''
   Added Rep. Ramon Huerta: ``It matters not a bit how it's spelled.
What matters is the pronunciation.''

<HEAD>Task Force to Recommend Mandatory Changes on Old Airliners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special task force of manufacturers, airline
operators and regulatory agencies is expected to recommend Tuesday
that mandatory modifications be made on aging Boeing jetliners.
   The group will make its findings public at a news conference
after meeting to put the final touches on its recommendations.
   The special committee, known as the Aging Transport Working
Group, was created as part of a 150-member group to study the
fitness of older transport aircraft.
   For the past nine months, it has examined the maintenance and
repair records of Boeing 747s, 737s and 727s and scores of
manufacturers' service orders and government directives affecting
the planes.
   The group has studied the various methods used for aircraft
inspection as well as the possible need to intensify the inspection
process or to make modifications to the aircraft themselves.
   In some cases, the group is expected to recommend that areas
which previously were allowed to be inspected for possible problems
should now be permanently modified to correct any defect.
   The task force's recommendations, if adopted by the Federal
Aviation Administration which has representatives on the panel,
would be a departure from a system that relied primarily on
inspection orders and mandatory repairs when needed.
   The average age of the world's 8,800 passenger airliners is about
13 years, with half the planes in many major U.S. fleets well over
15 years old, according to Avmark, an appraisal and consulting firm.
   The recommendations came four days after a hole ripped open in
United Air Lines' oldest 747, sending nine passengers hurling to
their deaths 17 minutes after takeoff from Honolulu. But
investigators in that incident said they found no signs of metal
fatigue that is often a factor in damage to older airliners and were
focusing on the possibility of a faulty cargo door.

<HEAD>Texas Town Offers Bounty For New Business</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GRAHAM, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Wanted: New Industry. $5,000 Reward.''
   So say printed enticements distributed by leaders of this feisty
little north Texas town of 9,000 near the sparkling waters of Possum
Kingdom Lake.
   Graham wants new business and industry and is willing to pay
someone for finding it.
   Who's eligible for the bounty? Practically everyone. (Bordello
operators need not apply.)
   ``The Graham Industrial Association and the Graham Chamber of
Commerce will confidentially and professionally follow up on your
suggestion,'' the ``Wanted'' posters proclaim.
   ``If your recommended company successfully locates in Graham and
provides at least 10 new jobs for a least six months you will
receive a $5,000 check for providing us with the contact person.''
   Graham is neither the first nor the last city to woo new industry
with incentives and innovative schemes, but the reward program does
have a fresh touch.
   Greed's the word that comes readily to mind, but the Graham
Covenant, as author Robert Ludlum would call it, really is just a
cash inducement to help rescue a small Texas town stricken by the
oil slump.
   ``We will give $5,000 to anybody and everybody who can provide us
with a lead that results in a new industry or business coming to
Graham,'' Mayor Ed Hinson tells anyone who'll listen.
   ``We want to get the attention of all Graham citizens _ clerks,
truck drivers, gas station attendants _ and give them the chance to
do something for Graham and help themselves in the process.''
   But Hinson and City Manager Larry Fields, who concocted the
scheme at a ``board meeting'' of coffee drinkers, stress that anyone
can win the bounty.
   The Graham Covenant maintains that the city can offer available
manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, office space, acreage for
new construction, utilities, a productive labor force and, for new
employees, a quality of life that features abundant hunting and
fishing opportunities.
   Deer, turkey, quail, duck and dove lure hunters from the
Dallas-Fort Worth area 100 miles to the east, and the bass fishing
at Possum Kingdom, while spotty, is among the best in Texas.
   ``That's what drew me to this part of the country,'' said Fields.
``They're catching some big bass down there now, including a couple
of 13 pounders.''
   But bass and birds aside, these folks are deadly serious, which
they demonstrated by hiring an executive director in February to
orchestrate the joint chamber-industrial association program.
   Their choice was E.H. Sheffield, an east Texas native with an
impressive record of attracting industry in Dallas' suburbs.
   ``In both Lancaster and Lewisville, he was involved extensively
in expanding and locating new industry for those communities,'' said
Glyn Gilliam, president of the industrial association.
   ``He brings a wealth of experience to the newly created position,
having served for more than 30 years in chamber management and
economic and tourist development.''
   Sheffield said he welcomes the opportunity and is up to the
challenge, which may be formidable.
   ``We're going to put him to the test out here,'' said Wayne
Pruett, publisher of the Graham Leader, the town's twice-weekly
newspaper. ``We didn't come up with this money for fun and games.''
   That's not to say the Graham Covenant escaped without a bit of
frivolity, since the most frequent recommendation concerns the
oldest profession.
   ``There's been a lot of inquiries about a cathouse for Graham,
but that doesn't qualify,'' Fields said with a grin.
   Hinson said at least three ``legitimate'' proposals were being
pursued but he could not discuss them out of fairness to the bounty
hunters involved.
   Oil and gas is the No. 1 industry in Young County and Carlisle
Memory Products, with 500 workers, is the town's leading employer.
Graham has several vacant buildings but actually has survived the
economic downturn better than most similar-size Texas cities.
   In the champagne days of abundant, high-priced oil, Graham was a
model of country prosperity, and to a certain extent it still is.
   Said the mayor:
   ``Graham's unique. If somebody has a good idea, he can raise a
lot of money locally.''
   Including $5,000 up front.

<HEAD>US Cotton Stockpile Growing, Demand Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. cotton stockpile is outgrowing demand
from domestic textile mills as well as from overseas markets,
according to an Agriculture Department report.
   Cotton exports in 1988-89 are forecast at 6.9 million bales, down
from 7.62 million bales last year.
   ``Aggressive pricing by major foreign exporters and heavy
movement of U.S. cotton under (government price support) loan have
been largely responsible for the decline,'' the report said Monday.
   When a farmer obtains a price support loan for cotton or another
commodity, it cannot be sold until the loan is repaid. Often when
market prices are low, a farmer will not repay the loan and forfeit
the commodity to the government.
   Despite a number of adjustments in the loan program to make U.S.
cotton more competitive in the world market, prices still remain
above those of foreign competitors, the report said.
   Meanwhile, cotton use by U.S. textile mills reached 7.6 million
bales in 1987-88, the most in 15 years. But this season's mill use
is expected to drop to 6.9 million bales.
   ``Reduced denim demand and consumer preference for more
fine-count yarn products are lowering mill use,'' the report said.
   As a result, U.S. cotton stockpiles, which were less than 5.8
million bales last Aug. 1, are expected to climb to 9.2 million by
this Aug. 1, the beginning of the 1989-90 cotton marketing year.

   President Bush's choice to head the new
Veterans Affairs Department faces questioning about why he tipped
off the South Korean Embassy 12 years ago that a Korean agent was
about to defect to the United States.
   Edward J. Derwinski initially denied that the tip had come from
him, only acknowledging it in 1983 in testimony before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee. That testimony was unpublished, but it
was uncovered in the National Archives last month by The Los Angeles
Times.
   Derwinski, a former Illinois congressman and recent State
Department official, was due before the Senate Veterans Affairs
Committee today for a closed-door hearing. The committee plans to
continue considering his nomination in open session on Wednesday.
   During a 1978 investigation of the Korean case, Derwinski denied
that the tip came from him and declined to answer a grand jury's
questions about the episode.
   In 1977, the defector, Sohn Ho Young, and his family were
spirited away from his New Jersey home by the FBI just a half hour
before the arrival of agents of the Korean Central Intelligence
Agency, for whom he worked.
   Derwinski at the time was a member of a House committee
investigating the ``Koreagate'' affair involving bribes by South
Korea to members of Congress.
   In a recent interview, Derwinski talked about the Koreagate
episode: ``It was dumb of me. That's easy to say now; it's
hindsight. I didn't have hindsight then.''
   Derwinski, a vigorous defender of the Korean government at the
time, said that when he learned the Koreagate committee was planning
to call Sohn as a witness, he told the embassy: ``Another PR blow is
headed your way. I didn't know his name, rank or serial number.''
   ``I thought the committee spotlighting him was uncalled for. I
thought the committee by its grandstanding was damaging U.S.-Korean
relations,'' Derwinski said.
   Derwinski said that in his recent courtesy calls on members of
the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, he found that ``basically,
they understand, if they put themselves in my shoes.''
   Derwinski acknowledged tipping off the Koreans in Foreign
Relations Committee testimony in 1983, when he was nominated to be
counselor to the State Department, a job he won after the redrawing
of his Illinois congressional district caused him to lose the House
seat he had held for 24 years.
   He later became an undersecretary for security assistance, the
post he held when chosen by President Bush to head the new Cabinet
department.
   The department will be created on March 15 out of the Veterans
Administration, a change long sought by veterans groups.
   In a speech Monday to the largest such group, the American
Legion, Derwinski warned against unrealistic expectations from the
change in status. ``We realize that with the budget problems facing
this administration, we're not going to be the priority group,'' he
said.
   Though medical officers of the VA have testified that their $10.8
billion budget for this year is $600 million to $1 billion short of
what is needed, Derwinski said after his speech that he did not
think he could get additional money this year.

   Mayor Coleman A. Young says he doesn't believe he
fathered a child born six years ago to a former city employee,
according to court papers.
   In a brief filed Monday in Wayne County Circuit Court, Young also
asked for a jury trial of the lawsuit filed Jan. 27 by Annivory
Calvert and that Calvert pay his legal expenses stemming from the
paternity suit.
   Calvert, 34, filed the suit shortly before leaving Detroit to
become director of public works in Fontana, Calif. She seeks to
establish Young, 70, as father of the child identified as Joel
Loving and obtain support for the boy.
   In the brief, attorneys for Young said the mayor ``neither admits
nor denies the allegation'' because he is ``without sufficient
knowledge or information.'' Young, who has said he dated Calvert,
``does not believe that he is the father,'' the brief said.
   Calvert's child is 6 years old. She said she withheld legal
action until moving to California to protect her child's interests.
   Young had no children from either of his two marriages, which
ended in divorce before he was elected mayor in 1973.

   Clara Hale, who has provided a home for
hundreds of drug-addicted babies, is being hailed as the winner of
this year's Truman Award for Public Service.
   Her choice was announced Monday in Independence, the Kansas City
suburb that was the home to the late President Truman.
   Mrs. Hale, 83, is founder of Hale House, a refuge in New York
City for infants and toddlers born addicted. She and her daughter,
Lorraine Hale, will receive the award May 6 at the Truman Library
and Museum.
   Clara Hale raised more than 40 children as a foster parent in
Harlem from 1941 to 1968. The following year her daughter met a
woman and her addicted baby and referred them to her mother for
care. Since then ``Mother Hale'' has provided a home for more than
600 babies born to addicted mothers.
   In most cases, the children are reunited with their mothers after
the mothers have undergone drug rehabilitation.

   Veteran country and gospel
singer-composer Stuart Hamblen faces surgery to remove a brain
tumor, but also suffers from inoperable lung cancer, a spokesman
said.
   Hamblen, 82, a longtime host of the ``Cowboy Church'' radio
program, has received well wishes from former President Reagan,
cowboy performers Roy Rogers and Gene Autry, and many others during
his stay at St. John's Hospital and Health Center, a hospital
spokesman said.
   Physicians said Hamblen would live about two months without the
brain tumor operation, which was scheduled for today. He was
expected to live six months with the surgery, Hamblen's spokesman
Garth Hintz said Monday.
   ``He has been telling the doctor he wanted to go to New
Zealand,'' Hintz said. ``He's a tough old bird and I expect if he
wants to go to New Zealand he will.''
   Hamblen's best-known song, ``It Is No Secret What God Can Do,''
written in 1950, has been translated into 50 languages. He ran for
president in 1952, running a distant third behind Dwight Eisenhower
and Adlai Stevenson.

   Actor Gary Busey will make his first public
comments Wednesday about the motorcycle accident that left him with
severe head injuries.
   ``Gary is coming along good and continuing therapy'' while
staying at a rehabilitation clinic, said his spokesman, Cheryl Kagan.
   Busey, 44, was injured Dec. 4 when he lost control of his
motorcycle and was thrown to the ground, striking his head. Busey,
an active campaigner against laws that would make helmets mandatory
for motorcycle riders, was not wearing a helmet.
   Busey, nominated for an Oscar as best actor for his title role in
the 1978 film ``The Buddy Holly Story,'' had just completed work on
a feature film, ``Hider in the House.'' Another film, ``Howling at
the Moon,'' has been put delayed by the accident.

   Kay Thompson, the author of ``Eloise,'' a popular
fictional character who roamed the halls of the Plaza hotel, has
turned down a request from Donald and Ivana Trump to use the
character in hotel promotions.
   ``What we would have liked was for Eloise to be reborn and live
at the Plaza hotel,'' said Dan Klores, spokesman for the Trumps, who
purchased the hotel during the past year.
   Eloise, whose exploits were chronicled in four picture books
during the 1950s, roamed the hotel with her dog and turtle. Her
character prompted three stories in Life magazine; an Eloise doll,
record and clothes; and even a real room at the Plaza where visitors
could speak to a person posing as Eloise's nanny.
   ``Unfortunately, the creator of Eloise simply doesn't want her to
exist anymore,'' Klores said. Thompson did not return several calls
to her answering service.

   With tears in his eyes, Don Shula watched as his

Miami Dolphins football team to take the same position with the
Dallas Cowboys.
   The elder Shula, head coach of the Dolphins, hired his son seven
years ago. That move drew criticism from detractors, who said David
Shula benefitted from nepotism.
   ``David took a lot of heat,'' Don Shula said. ``But all he's ever

   The Cowboys were sold Saturday night and Jimmy Johnson was

   The critically detested Tom Hanks film ``The
'burbs'' led the weekend box office charts again, and Oscar
nominations kept ``Rain Man,'' ``Dangerous Liaisons'' and ``Working
Girl'' in the top 10.
   ``The 'burbs,'' starring Hanks as a suburban home owner pushed to
the brink by unusual neighbors, collected $6 million to claim No. 1
for a second consecutive weekend.
   It was followed by ``Rain Man,'' the hit Dustin Hoffman-Tom
Cruise road drama, which has received eight Oscar nominations and
grossed $4.71 million for second place.
   In third was ``Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,'' a comedy
about two teen-age time travelers, with ticket sales of $4.66
million.
   ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' the drama about power-driven seductions
in pre-revolutionary France, moved up to No. 4 with $2.8 million.
The acclaimed movie, which has receved seven Oscar nominations,
played on more than twice as many screens as the previous week but
suffered a 58 percent drop in per-screen averages.
   ``Three Fugitives,'' featuring Nick Nolte and Martin Short as
outlaws on the lam with Short's young daughter in tow, finished in
fifth, grossing $2.7 million.
   It was followed by ``Beaches,'' starring Bette Midler and Barbara
Hershey, which collected $2.31 million. In seventh was ``Cousins,''
the romantic comedy with Ted Danson and Isabella Rossellini, with
$2.26 million.
   In eighth was the slimy sequel ``The Fly II,'' followed by the
corporate Cinderella story ``Working Girl,'' which has received six
Academy Award nominations, and the courtroom drama ``True Believer.''

<HEAD>Space Shuttle Discovery Could Be Launched Next Week</HEAD>

   The Discovery could be ready for
launch as early as next week, but a high-priority military rocket
liftoff could bump the shuttle flight at least two days, officials
said.
   A decision on a shuttle launch date will be made Friday at the
conclusion of a flight readiness review.
   On Monday, Thomas Utsman, deputy director of the Kennedy Space
Center, said the center was ready for the Discovery flight, but his
statement did not give a launch date.
   Other officials said the launch target date of March 9 has not
changed.
   Sources, however, said the Air Force has scheduled a military
launch about that time and that it would have priority over a
shuttle launch for national security reasons.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration relies heavily
on Air Force tracking facilities for a shuttle flight. Air Force
officials reportedly told space agency officials Monday they could
not support a Discovery launch before March 11, later if the
military launch is delayed on a day-by-day basis.
   The nature of the military launch was not disclosed, but there
are two flights being readied: the first submarine launch of the new
Trident 2 intercontinental range missile and a Delta rocket carrying
a payload for the Strategic Defense Initiative, or ``Star Wars,''
missile defense system.
   The conflict will have to be resolved at the Thursday-Friday
flight readiness review, during which top-level NASA managers will
examine all aspects of the shuttle mission.
   The Discovery launch had been scheduled for Feb. 23, but was
postponed after two tiny cracks were discovered in an oxygen
turbopump in one of Atlantis' main engines following a flight by
that shuttle in December.
   Because Discovery's three turbopumps went through the same
manufacturing process, NASA decided to replace them, delaying the
mission.
   Five astronauts, commanded by veteran shuttle flier Mike Coats,
are to deploy a large communications satellite and conduct medical
and technological experiments during Discovery's planned five days
in orbit.

<HEAD>Bush Trip: Fast and Photogenic but Few Major Moves</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's fast-paced Asian trip provided
a daily dose of telegenic photo opportunities but few clues about
his brand of foreign policy _ other than that it will tone down
America's approach on human rights.
   It seemed Bush's purpose in more than 18,000 miles of travel was
simply to touch base with other leaders and reaffirm friendly
relations.
   There was no sign of any new initiatives.
   Over five days, Bush zipped through Tokyo, Beijing and Seoul,
pumping hands and posing for pictures with more than 20 foreign
leaders in dramatic settings.
   The only time Bush stood still was during a three-hour appearance
at the funeral of Emperor Hirohito.
   Not everything came off quite as planned: The White House script
did not call for the trip to vie for attention with the drama at
home over John Tower's troubled nomination as secretary of defense.
   And, there was a diplomatic slap in Beijing where Chinese
authorities prevented the country's top dissident from attending
Bush's banquet.
   At the very moment that Bush was declaring the Chinese-American
relationship vital to the security interests of the United States
and was toasting ``the future of U.S.-China relations, a future
filled with achievement, good fortune and peace,'' the Chinese were
taking a step that they must have known would be seen as insulting.
   But the next day Bush restricted himself to a muted expression of
``regret'' _ regret, not outrage _ over the Chinese refusal to let
Fang Lizhi meet with him.
   To rub it in, the Chinese, through their foreign ministry
spokesman, gave Bush a public lecture on human rights, telling him
in effect not to raise the subject.
   ``Human rights was not discussed,'' White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater reported later. A day later, Fitzwater reversed
himself and said human rights were discussed privately in China by
Bush, but he couldn't say with whom.
   Fitzwater said Bush believes that quiet diplomacy is the
appropriate course for raising human rights in China.
   That was a sharp contrast with former President Ronald Reagan,
who highlighted human rights problems in communist nations and
always made the subject the very first topic of discussion in
dealings with the Soviet Union.
   Right from the outset, Bush was thrown on the defensive in Tokyo
about Tower.
   World leaders who were ushered in for 20-minute meetings with the
new American president saw him peppered with embarrassing questions
about the man he wants to run the Pentagon.
   The Tower issue followed Bush to Beijing, to Seoul and back to
Washington, where today the president was calling senators in
one-by-one to ask for their support.
   For all of Bush's activity in Asia, there was no sign of progress
on nagging trade frictions, particularly with Japan and South Korea.
   Members of South Korea's National Assembly applauded warmly when
Bush pledged not to remove the 42,000 American troops in that
country.
   But those same legislators sat stonily silent when he repeated
the U.S. complaint that Seoul needs to do more to reduce trade
barriers.
   In Tokyo, Bush met with leaders of Jordan, Egypt and Israel in
what the White House said was part of the search for peace in the
region.
   Afterward, Bush said there were ``new opportunities'' in the
Middle East but there was no sign that the United States was ready
to step in and try to capitalize on them.
   The White House was sensitive about suggestions that it is going
slowly and having trouble getting its act together.
   ``The worst thing you could do, the most foolish thing you could
do, is to try and enact foreign policy in a period of time measured
in days or even a few weeks after having been inaugurated,'' said
White House chief of staff John Sununu.
   ``Even if it were sound policy,'' he said, ``it probably would
have been perceived as doing something rashly and quickly without
consultation.''
   The other side of the coin is that Bush risks losing the
opportunity afforded a new administration for change and innovation
in the first days of its life. Already it seems to be settling down
to business as usual from the Reagan administration and the
honeymoon with Congress seems to be evaporating.

<HEAD>Rightist Given 20 Months For Sending Revolver To Takeshita</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 44-year-old rightist was sentenced to 20 months in
prison today for mailing a revolver and bullet to Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita to discourage him from running in party elections,
a court official said.
   Hideki Kashima, head of a rightist organization in Takamatsu,
southwestern Japan, was guilty of ``trying to sway the democratic
structure by forcing through his own political stance,'' the Tokyo
District Court said in handing down its verdict.
   Kashima was accused of mailing a parcel containing the firearms
and a leaflet criticizing Takeshita as a ``money-oriented
politician'' to his office in downtown Tokyo in September 1987.
   He was later arrested after investigators found his
organization's address on a separate letter sent earlier to
Takeshita's office.
   Kashima demanded that Takeshita, then secretary-general of the
governing liberal Democratic Party, not run for party president. In
Japan, the winner of the governing party's presidency also becomes
the prime minister.
   Takeshita, who became prime minister in October 1987, has
recently been plagued by a widening stock-profiteering scandal which
has toppled several ranking members in his administration.

<HEAD>Court to Rule on Fairness of All-White Jury for White Defendant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court is using an Illinois case to
study an unusual criminal justice question: whether a white
defendant is ever treated unfairly when prosecutors exclude blacks
from the jury.
   The court said Monday it will decide if a Chicago-area white man
who was sentenced to 85 years in prison after his conviction by an
all-white jury for rape, kidnapping and armed robbery should get a
new trial.
   The decision, expected sometime next year, might not affect a
significant number of cases. But it could limit further the
traditionally broad power of prosecutors to eliminate prospective
jurors from trials by using so-called peremptory challenges.
   Peremptory challenges allow disqualification of jurors without
explanation.
   The appeal contends the challenges violated a 1986 Supreme Court
ruling forbidding the use of racial criteria and denied the
defendant a jury representing a cross-section of the community.
   In other matters Monday, the court:
   _Agreed to take a new look at how far communities may go in
regulating sexually oriented businesses by judging the validity of a
Dallas licensing ordinance.
   The justices said they will decide whether the Dallas ordinance,
which among other things bars anyone convicted of certain crimes
from operating a sexually oriented business, violates free-speech
rights.
   _Refused to revive an affirmative action program in South Bend,
Ind., that called for hiring more blacks and Hispanics as
firefighters and police officers.
   But in a related case from Vallejo, Calif., the justices rejected
``reverse discrimination'' arguments by a white firefighter denied a
promotion that went to a black man with a slightly lower test score.
   In the California case, the court left intact a ruling that
upheld the black man's promotion to help achieve better racial
balance within the city's fire department.
   _Turned down the appeal of Bernhard Goetz, who in 1984 shot four
young men he said were going to rob him on a New York City subway.
The justices let stand Goetz's conviction for illegally possessing a
gun and the one-year prison sentence and $5,000 fine it drew.
   In the Chicago case, Daniel Holland is contesting his criminal
conviction on grounds that prosecutors used two of their 12
automatic challenges to exclude the only black potential jurors.
   Prosecutors denied that the two disqualifications were racially
motivated.
   The high court in 1986 barred prosecutors from ever disqualifying
potential jurors based on their race. But that equal-protection
ruling involved a black defendant and jurors of his race.
   The Illinois Supreme Court ruled that a white man such as Holland
lacks the legal standing to challenge the exclusion of blacks from
his jury.
   In addition to raising the equal-protection argument handled in
the 1986 Supreme Court decision, Holland's appeal says the exclusion
of blacks violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury representing
a fair cross-section of the community.
   The court in past rulings have applied that right in cases of
racial bias in the selection of pools of potential jurors but has
not yet applied it to particular juries picked.
   Holland was convicted in the May 4, 1980, rape and kidnapping of
a Des Plaines, Ill., teen-ager.

<HEAD>Death Toll Triples Average in 1988 Earthquakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The earthquake that killed 25,000 people in
Armenia pushed last year's earthquake-related death toll worldwide
to the highest level since 1976, when a Chinese earthquake killed at
least 10 times as many, the U.S. Geological Survey reports.
   The estimated earthquake death toll in 1988 includes an
additional 2,000 or more people who died in other earthquakes around
the world, the Survey reported Monday.
   Although the annual average death toll for earthquakes is about
10,000, in 1987 only 1,100 lives were lost.
   In addition to the deaths, some 13,000 people were injured and
more than a half-million were left homeless in the Armenian
earthquake, which had a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale. The
death toll of 25,000 is the most recent reported by the Soviets. The
exact toll in unknown.
   The main shock was followed within minutes by a second, measuring
5.8 on the Richter scale, which estimates the energy released by an
earthquake. An earthquake of 5.0 can cause considerable damage, and
the strength rises by 10 times for each whole number on the scale.
   Many of the deaths in Armenia were blamed on collapsing
buildings, as the earthquake rattled concrete structures until they
fell to the ground, according to subsequent analyses.
   Another recent earthquake in the Soviet Union, claiming about
1,000 lives, struck in Soviet central Asia. That one occurred in
January, however, and so does not count in the 1988 toll.
   Last year's second most deadly earthquake occurred Aug. 20 on the
Nepal-India border, killing 1,000. That earthquake, measuring 6.6 on
the Richter scale, destroyed thousands of homes and injured many
people.
   On Nov. 6 an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the scale claimed 730
lives and injured about 4,000 people on the border between Burma and
China, the Geological Survey reported.
   And on the India-Burma border three deaths were reported in an
Aug. 6 earthquake that caused landslides.
   The Survey said it recorded 61 significant earthquakes last year,
15 fewer than the year before. An earthquake is considered
significant if it has a magnitude of 6.5 on the Richter scale.
Earthquakes of lesser magnitude are included if they cause
casualties or considerable damage.
   Three significant earthquakes were recorded in the United States
last year, including the strongest shock of the year. That
earthquake, measured at 7.6, occurred March 6 in the Gulf of Alaska
and resulted in only minor damage.
   The only U.S. earthquake death last year occured when someone
suffered a heart attack after an earthquake measuring 4.8 in
Whittier, Calif., in February. The other significant U.S. earthquake
occurred Dec. 3 in Pasadena, Calif. It was measured at 4.6 on the
scale and caused some injuries and property damage.
   An earthquake centered in eastern Canada on Nov. 25 was felt
widely across that country and in the northeastern United States as
far south as Washington, the Survey reported. It had a magnitude of
5.7. Earthquakes in the eastern part of North America tend to be
felt over larger areas than earthquakes of similar strength in the
West.
   Europe recorded three earthquake deaths last year when one rated
at 3.0 killed a group of miners in Czechoslovakia on Sept. 2.
   In addition an earthquake rated at 5.8 caused several injuries in
Albania on Jan. 9.
   Injuries were also reported from two offshore earthquakes, one in
the Ionian Sea near Greece Oct. 16 and another near the Azores
Islands Nov. 21.
   In Africa, eight people working in a gold mine in South Africa
died Jan. 5 in an earthquake rated at 5.2.
   And Japan, usually very seismically active, recorded only one
significant earthquake last year, the Survey reported. That
earthquake measured 5.4 and resulted in 10 injuries and minor damage
in the Tokyo area.

<HEAD>Foreclosure Holdings Drop Slightly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The wave of bankruptcies and foreclosures that
engulfed thousands of financially troubled farmers during the
mid-1980s has left millions of acres in the hands of bankers,
insurance companies and other lenders, says an Agriculture
Department report.
   But the situation is slowly improving, according to the
department's Economic Research Service. As of mid-1988, about 7.93
million acres of farm property valued at $3.29 billion were held by
the primary lending groups, down from a peak of 8.98 million acres
and $3.59 billion on Dec. 30, 1987.
   The groups include the cooperative Farm Credit System, commercial
banks, Farmers Home Administration and life insurance companies.
   Lenders acquired much of the property through farm bankruptcies,
foreclosures or transfer of deed in lieu of foreclosure.
   ``The drop in lenders' property holdings reflects an improving
farm economy and rising land values,'' the report said. ``Earlier
fears that lenders would dump acquired farmland on already weak land
markets now appear unfounded. The drought last year probably had
little net effect on lenders' holdings.''
   One of the report's authors, economist Jerome Stam, said Monday
that he believed the decline in property holdings has continued but
that he had no idea what the figures might show by mid-1989.
   ``I'm not going out on a limb on that one,'' he said. ``But I
would like to think it would keep on going down.''
   Others who worked on the report include agency economists Gregory
Gajewski and Steven Koenig.
   Life insurance companies hold the most farmland, 4,125,000 acres
as of June 30, 1988, valued at more than $1.52 billion. The
companies surpassed the Farm Credit System, or FCS, in mid-1987 as
the largest holder of farm property.
   The holdings of the other major groups as of June 30, 1988,
included: FCS, 1,438,405 acres and a value of $706.1 million;
commercial banks, 882,300 acres and $428 million; FmHA, 1,487,845
acres and $628.6 million.
   Holdings by the FCS peaked at the end of 1986 at 2.7 million
acres worth about $1 billion.
   ``Most FCS institutions (which include federal land banks) have
been pursuing a more aggressive land sales strategy than the life
insurance companies,'' the report said.
   The four groups of lenders accounted for about 78 percent of the
$76.7 billion in farm real estate debt, excluding household debt, as
of Dec. 31, 1988. The remaining 22 percent was held by ``individuals
and others,'' including many who sold farms on contract or took a
mortgage as part of the sales agreement.
   Department economists said little is known about acquired or
reverted property held by this group.
   Comparatively, current farmland holdings are small compared with
those during the Great Depression. At the end of 1937, the top
lenders held about 28 million acres, compared with less than 9
million acres on Dec. 31, 1987.
   ``However, the runup in holdings during the 1980s took only a few
years,'' the report said. ``The Depression holdings grew throughout
the 1920s and 1930s.''
   Could sales of ``surplus'' farm property, including land and
buildings, be large enough to depress farmland prices?
   At the 1987 peak, lender holdings were equal to only 0.7 percent
of the total $550 billion value at that time, and represented only
0.9 percent of the roughly 1 billion acres in farms.
   But looked at another way, the lender-held property is larger in
terms of annual farmland sales. In the first quarter of 1987, lender
holdings were equivalent to about 24 percent of annual sales in
terms of acreage, and nearly 20 percent in terms of value.
   ``Lender holdings are large enough to overshadow other influences
on land prices,'' the report said. ``But sales of holdings have not
depressed prices because lenders do not sell all their holdings in
one year.''
   The life insurance companies, with their large holdings,
generally have been slow to sell, and attempts by the FmHA, an
agency of the Agriculture Department, have been hampered by Congress
and the courts. Nevertheless, the report added, the potential impact
of lender holdings is ``relatively greater'' in some regions.

   The Agriculture Department says China has been
authorized to buy an additional 2 million metric tons of U.S. wheat
at subsidized prices.
   Acting Undersecretary Richard W. Goldberg said Monday the wheat
will be available to China under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to
36.7 bushels of wheat.
   Under EEP arrangement, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   The subsidies have ranged from less than $20 to more than $40 per
ton of wheat, or in the range of 54 cents to $1.09 per bushel.
   Under previous EEP authorizations, China has bought more than 7.4
million tons of wheat for delivery in 1988-89. Only 10,000 tons
remained in the previous authorization issued on Dec. 30.
   China is the biggest foreign customer of American wheat farmers
this year, and also expected to be the world's largest single
importer of wheat in 1988-89.
   According to USDA projections, China may import about 15 million
tons of wheat from all foreign sources, while the Soviet Union is
expected to import 13 million tons.
   The Soviets, as of Feb. 23, had bought about 3 million tons of
wheat from the United States, compared with the 7.4 million tons by
China. All the 1988-89 U.S. wheat sales to the Soviet Union and
China have been subsidized.

   The dollar gained substantially against the Japanese
yen Tuesday, while share prices plunged on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar opened at 127.00 yen and moved between 126.92 and
127.20 before closing at 127.15 yen, up 1.15 yen from Monday's
close. The dollar had declined a total of 1.15 yen on the three
previous trading days.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 166.72-point
loser Monday, lost another 300.17 points, or 0.94 percent, closing
at 31,985.60.
   Dealers said the dollar's firmness was due mainly to prevailing
sentiment of possible higher U.S. interest rates in the future.
   Last Friday, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its discount rate,
its charge for loans to banks, from 6.5 percent to 7 percent due to
concern over inflation in the American economy.
   Higher U.S. interest rates tend to raise the value of the dollar.
   On the stock market, traders said the Nikkei index was weak
throughout the morning as institutional investors took a
wait-and-see position because of uncertainty over the trend of
interest rates abroad.

<TEXT>
   From school problems and sex education to the
hot issue of ``choice,'' school board presidents disagree frequently
with the public that elected them, according to a survey released
today.
   The attitude gaps were uncovered by the private National Center
for Education Information in a survey of school board presidents
across the United States.
   ``These people really do start out being representative of the
public,'' said center director Emily Feistritzer, a veteran
education analyst. ``But the longer people have been on school
boards, the more co-opted they are by the system and the more
resistant to any changes in it.''
   The survey found that 97 percent of school board presidents are
white, 71 percent are male, and 68 percent have never held any job
in an education system. Nearly half are in their 40s, 94 percent are
married, and almost two-thirds have children still at home. They are
better educated, make more money and are more conservative
politically than the average American.
   Generally, school board presidents who have been members of their
boards for short times were found to want changes in numerous areas
of education. Those who have been on their boards 10 years or more,
26 percent of the total, are ``more resistant'' to changes, the
survey found.
   Among the survey's most unexpected discoveries was the gap
between school board presidents and the public on public school
choice, the concept of letting parents select which local school
their child attends.
   A 1987 Gallup poll found that 71 percent of the public believes
parents should be able to send their children to the school of their
choice. Only 36 percent of school board presidents said parents
should be able to make that decision; 51 percent said no and 13
percent said they didn't know.
   The majority feel such a system would create inequities and
logistical nightmares, according to Feistritzer.
   ``They are very informed about choice and they are diametrically
opposed to it,'' Feistritzer said. ``With this kind of opposition,
the likelihood that choice will be a fait accompli in the next few
years is not very high.''
   Another area in which school board presidents diverged from
public opinion was in rating school problems. In a 1988 Gallup poll,
asked about the biggest problems faced by schools, 32 percent of the
general public cited drug use and 19 percent said lack of discipline.
   By contrast, only 10 percent of the board presidents picked drug
use and 4 percent, lack of discipline. But 61 percent of them said
lack of proper financial support for the school system was a major
problem.
   When asked to rate their own schools, 79 percent of the school
board presidents gave them an A or a B _ nearly twice as generous as
the 40 percent of the public that gave their local schools an A or B
in a Gallup poll last spring.
   But the board presidents agreed with the public that nationally,
U.S. schools are not doing too well; only 33 percent gave them an A
or a B grade. They also reflected prevailing public views in their
strong support for paying teachers on the basis of performance and
requiring them to pass competency tests before they can teach.
   The school board presidents went afield again in the area of sex
education, with 80 percent favoring elementary school instruction in
grades 4-8, compared to only 55 percent of the general public in a
spring 1987 Gallup poll.
   There are 40 million students enrolled in public schools in more
than 15,000 school districts across the country.
   The Feistritzer survey was based on questionnaires completed by
1,217 school board presidents or chairmen. Responses were weighted
to reflect all districts and the results had a margin of error of 3
percentage points.

<HEAD>Group to Sue for Lower Pesticide Levels in Fruits, Vegetables</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private group says it will sue the
Environmental Protection Agency to make it tighten its pesticide
standards because current allowable levels in fruits and vegetables
pose a risk to preschool children.
   The group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a
report released Monday that current standards fail to account for
the high amounts of fruits and vegetables children eat in proportion
to their weight.
   The study's findings were reported last week after a summary of
the two-year study became public. The group examined risks from the
use of eight cancer-causing pesticides on 27 fruits and vegetables.
   While no lawsuit has yet been filed, Al Meyerhoff, a lawyer for
the council, said the group plans to take the matter to court,
arguing that the EPA has failed to protect the public health of all
citizens.
   ``When the agency sets supposedly safe levels of pesticides in
food they ignore children,'' Meyerhoff said in an interview.
   The EPA has challenged the findings of the study.
   John Moore, acting deputy adminstrator, said last week the EPA
analysis on allowable toxicity levels of fruits and vegetables
already considers that children often consume large amounts of such
foods.
   The health threat to children also was disputed Monday by
representatives of the processed food industry, fruit and vegetable
industry, and chemical industry as well as some physicians.
   The National Food Processors Association said it routinely
conducts tests for pesticide residues in processed foods and has
always found them ``virtually non-existent in packaged foods and far
below allowable levels in the few cases when detected.''
   The group said that a recent examination of 17,843 samples of
processed fruits and vegetables showed 92 percent with no detectable
pesticide residues. It said another test of apple products showed _
with the exception of one sample with a low-level amount _ no trace
of the carcinogenic growth-regulator daminozide.
   But Robin Whyatt, an author of the council study, said the
group's findings suggest a health risk to children. She said the
findings are based on comparing government data showing consumption
of fruits and vegetables by preschool children and residue levels
that have been documented on such food products.
   The report said as many as 5,500 to 6,200 children among the
current preschool population ``may eventualy get cancer solely as a
result of their exposure before 6 years of age.'' This represents a
chance of 5 children in 20,000 getting cancer from such exposure,
250 times greater than the one in a million considered allowable by
the EPA in its risk analysis for the entire population.
   John McCarthy, vice president of the National Agricultural
Chemicals Association, called the NRDC study misleading and said it
was based on a ``worst-case scenario that does not represent real
world experience.''
   ``The chemicals in question have been widely used for more than
25 years yet available data show that the incidence of cancers that
could be attributed to overexposure to chemicals in the food supply
is not increasing,'' McCarthy said.

<HEAD>Tribal Leaders Don't Want BIA Abolished Yet</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Three tribal leaders told a Senate panel that
the Bureau of Indian Affairs still has a role to play despite
charges of neglect and corruption aired in a series of hearings.
   ``If your car quits running you don't discard it, you fix it,''
John Taylor, chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee, told a special
investigative unit of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs
on Monday.
   The tribal leaders were asked at the conclusion of the round of
hearings whether the bureau should be abolished.
   Taylor, whose tribe lives in the mountains of North Carolina,
said he is proud of his tribe's economic self-sufficiency, but he
doesn't think all tribes could survive without the BIA. ``We can
make the BIA accountable,'' he said.
   The bureau came under heavy criticism as the committee looked
into contracting fraud and child abuse on Indian reservations, and
organized crime infiltration into legal Indian gambling operations
such as bingo.
   BIA witnesses who testified since the hearings began Jan. 30
generally showed little knowledge of the problems, or admitted
failing to act quickly when abuse was revealed.
   Ivan L. Sidney, chairman of the Hopi tribe in Arizona, said he
believes the BIA will someday be unnecessary, ``whether it be next
year, 10 years 20 years.''
   But he said as the tribes work toward total sovereignty, they
must continue to work with the federal government.
   ``Our relationship is with the federal government, not with the
states,'' Sidney said. ``I believe a special assistant to the
president will assist us in the effort to minimize the BIA's role.''
   Last week, the three senators who comprise the special committee
asked President Bush to put a staff person in the White House in
charge of Indian affairs. There has been no response yet.
   ``I think there needs to be a presence because of our
relationship with the U.S. government,'' said John Washakie, chief
of the Shoshone and Arapho tribes in Wyoming. But he said it could
be minimized.
   In closing the session, Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who
chairs the committee, called the hearings on child sexual abuse ``a
case study on the shortcomings of the BIA and the IHS (Indian Health
Service).''
   ``The BIA has been grossly negligent in protecting the resource
that American Indians care about most deeply _ their families,''
DeConcini said.
   DeConcini said that he and his fellow committee members, Sens.
Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., and John McCain, R-Ariz., agree that
``increased accountability is the key to strengthening Indian
self-determination.''
   William Ragsdale, acting head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
told the committee he is sending a letter of apology from the
Department of Interior to the Hopi tribe and any others whose
children were sexually abused by BIA employees.
   Ragsdale said Monday that the insensitivity of some school
officials to parents whose children had been molested was
``inexcusable.''
   ``I started my career in the Indian bureau as a school teacher,''
said Ragsdale. ``It is difficult for me to understand why our system
totally broke down.''
   Ragsdale said that part of the breakdown in the BIA school system
could be blamed on Congress. He referred to a law which changed the
organizational structure of the BIA, and required that the 115 or
120 BIA schools across the country report directly to Washington.
   ``That's too much of a span of control for anyone to handle,'' he
said.
   DeConcini said that over the next few months, the special
committee will continue its probe into other aspects of Indian
affairs, including natural resource management, the Indian Health
Service, management trust funds, Indian education and HUD Indian
housing programs.

   The technician who runs the electronically
complex sound systems for rock 'n' roll bands is a creative artist
with First Amendment protections, according to arguments before the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   At issue is a requirement in New York City that it supply those
technicians for Central Park's Naumburg Bandshell.
   The city has required performers to use a city-supplied sound
system and technician since 1986 to control sound levels inside the
park's designated ``quiet zones'' and make sure that noise doesn't
bleed out into surrounding neighborhoods.
   But attorney William Kunstler told the high court on Monday: ``I
think this is a curb on creativity. This is an attempt to regulate
free expression.''
   The flamboyant attorney who has made a career defending radicals
and other unpopular cases is representing a promoter called Rock
Against Racism, which has sponsored rock concerts in the Naumburg
Bandshell since 1979.
   Kunstler argued that the sound technician, who controls the
volume of the instruments and the balance among the sounds, is an
intrinsic artistic part of a band.
   To replace a rock group's own mixer as a means of controlling the
sound level is akin to the city's deciding to replace the conductor
of the New York Philharmonic with the music director of the Chicago
Symphony Orchestra, he contended.
   ``They want to put Georg Solti in for Zubin Mehta ... that's what
they're saying,'' Kunstler told the justices.
   But a city lawyer argued that Rock Against Racism had not
originally made the argument that the sound person was an artistic
part of the band, and said the city-hired sound technician had been
used by 50 to 60 performers at the bandshell in 1986 without a
problem.
   ``Every group was satisfied,'' said Leonard J. Koerner, chief
assistant corporation counsel. Koerner also argued that it has
proven unworkable to have a city technician control volume while a
band technician works the sound mix.
   ``Some things happen in the heat of battle that don't follow a
neat and orderly pattern,'' he said.
   Rock Against Racism challenged the city's bandshell rules in
April 1986. The promoter lost its case at the District Court level
in April 1987 but it won an appeal in a federal circuit court in
June 1988. The city appealed to the Supreme Court.
   In its ruling last June, the appeals court found that the city's
approach violates performers' freedom of expression. But city
officials called the ruling unrealistic and hinted it might even
cause a riot if it leaves officials with no choice other than
pulling the plug on a concert that got too loud.
   A Supreme Court ruling is expected sometime before July.

<HEAD>FCC Sets Guidelines for Certain Public Phones</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long-distance telephone callers in airports,
hospitals, hotels and other public places will be getting more
information on whose service they're using and how much it will
cost, but no price break.
   The Federal Communications Commission on Monday ordered five
companies that provide so-called alternative operator service to
provide more consumer information. The FCC also told those companies
they must not block callers from using other long-distance carriers,
the FCC said.
   However, the FCC decided not to regulate alternative operator
service rates, which have caused numerous complaints from those
making collect or credit card calls who sometimes get a big surprise
when they receive their bill later at home.
   The FCC action was in response to a complaint filed by two
consumer groups, Telecommunications Research and Action Center and
Consumer Action, against Central Corp., International Telecharge
Inc., National Telephone Services Inc., Payline Systems Inc. and
Telesphere Network Inc.
   Providers of alternative operator services typically lease lines
from a long-distance carrier and then provide their own operators to
connect callers with that long-distance company. Businesses that use
the alternative operator services for their pay phones get a
commission from each call.
   Gerald Brock, chief of the FCC's common carrier bureau, said the
FCC had ordered the companies to:
   _Provide information on or near the telephone that an operator
call will go through a certain company and indicate how to contact
that company for rate information.
   _Make their operators identify what company they are with and
then give callers an opportunity to hang up without any charge.
   _Refrain from call blocking, in which a hotel, for example, will
place all its long-distance calls through a particular operator. The
alternative operator services companies cannot prevent callers from
using AT&amp;T, for example, if they choose to do so.
   Brock said an industry panel also will be asked how to solve the
problem of ``call splashing,'' in which an alternative operator
services provider uses an operator in Denver, for example, to handle
a call from Los Angeles to New York. If the caller decides not to
use that operator, the operator will hand off the call to another
long-distance operator in Denver and the caller will get a bill for
a call from Denver to New York instead of Los Angeles to New York.
   But Brock said the commission would allow the marketplace to set
rates.
   ``We believe that we are not the appropriate ones to limit the
consumer options,'' Brock said. ``So long as the consumers have a
choice, then we assume that they will choose the carrier that is of
most value to them, given the combination of service characteristics
and prices charged. ... A consumer who believes that an AOS
company's rates are too high should use a different carrier.''
   Brock said Monday's ruling is separate from a recent decision by
a federal judge that owners of buildings where public phones are
located must choose by April 1 which company will provide
long-distance service.

<HEAD>FCC Eases Requirements for Phone-Installation Help</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has decided to make it easier
for low-income people to qualify for subsidized telephone service.
   The Federal Communications Commission decided Monday that
low-income applicants for subsidized telephone service no longer
will have to show they've had no phone for the previous three months
or that they've received no federal phone aid for two years.
   The FCC said those requirements for ``Link Up America'' aid were
denying service to 15 percent of all applicants.
   The year-old federal assistance plan is designed to encourage
low-income households to get telephone service by helping pay for
installation.
   Qualifying households may receive up to $30 to help defray such
costs.
   Gerald Brock, chief of the FCC's common carrier bureau, said
there were 385,000 people in 37 states, the District of Columbia and
Puerto Rico in the program.
   Brock said the commission decided to loosen the requirements when
it was shown it would not cost the government very much.
   ``We are finding that it has been an effective program but it has
not been so well used that the financial requirements were
overwhelming,'' Brock told reporters.

   The Food and Drug Administration has issued
standards for expectorants in nonprescription cough-cold medicines
that allow only one proven active ingredient to remain on the market.
   Guaifenesin was the only ingredient found by the FDA to be safe
and effective in increasing sputum or phlegm volume and making it
easier to cough up.
   It is the most widely used active ingredient used in expectorants
and is contained in the major brands of cough-cold medicines, the
FDA said.
   About 20 other expectorant ingredients were found not to be
useful and products using these ingredients will have to be
reformulated or taken off the market within one year. The FDA said
eight products listed in the Handbook of Nonprescription Drugs would
fall into this category.
   Among the 20 ingredients are ammonium chloride, a plant extract
called horehound, pine tar, spirits of turpentine and squill, the
dried inner scales of a flowering plant.

   The European Community should break its
deadlock over eliminating farm trade barriers, in response to a
softened U.S. position on the issue, an Australian official says.
   When global trade talks resume in April, the United States will
be prepared to discuss short-term agricultural trade reforms short
of its goal of eliminating all barriers by the end of the century,
Michael John Duffy, Australian minister for trade negotiations, said
after meeting U.S. officials.
   This means that ``the United States has put the ball very much in
the European Community's court,'' he added. ``They haven't hit it
hard yet, but they're having a good look at it.''
   ``I am generally more hopeful than I have been in the past 19
months because the U.S. has now made it possible'' for realistic
negotiations to take place in the ongoing Uruguay Round of GATT, the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he said.

   Boeing is telling 747 operators to check cargo
doors like the one that ripped off a jumbo jet out of Honolulu, but
federal authorities say they have no plans to rush mandatory cargo
lock improvements.
   Airlines still have up to 16 months to strengthen cargo door
locks, even though Boeing first recommended the change in August
1987 after a door popped open on a Pan Am 747.
   Investigators of the incident Friday that sent nine United Air
Lines Flight 811 passengers to their deaths over the Pacific Ocean
were homing in on the possibility of a malfunctioning cargo door.
The accident left a 10-by-20-foot hole in the side of the
18-year-old aircraft.
   Boeing on Sunday sent notices to 747 operators around the world
to recheck their planes' cargo doors, although spokesman David
Jimenez said this did not imply any conclusion as to the cause of
the Honolulu incident.
   Lee Dickinson, a National Transportion Safety Board investigator,
said various electrical problems were reported in December and the
jumbo jet's door had to be closed manually. In January, a seal on
the cargo door was repaired, he said. Dickinson refused to speculate
on the seriousness of the door repairs, but said ``it is proper to
close this door manually.''
   The Federal Aviation Administration ordered prompt inspections
and any necesssary repairs of the doors on older U.S.-registered
747s last July. But it gave airlines either 18 months or two years
to strengthen undamaged cargo locks, depending on the type of lock
on each airliner.
   ``First of all, we've got to find out what happened'' before
considering any revisions in the order, FAA spokesman Fred Farrar
said.
   Flight data and cockpit voice recorders arrived at the National
Transportation Safety Board in Washington on Monday for analysis and
transcription.
   The recorders contain data from sensors throughout the aircraft,
voices and other noises that might add to information about the
incident.
   Matthew Finucane, air safety director for the Association of
Flight Attendants, said the union thinks the FAA ``as a general
rule, is too generous in the time frames for its mandatory safety
reforms.''
   Despite the lack of federal urgency, United and at least one
other airline were stepping up inspections of the cargo door locks.
Others said they already had made the changes ordered by the FAA.
   United officials said mechanics had inspected all the fleet's 31
747s and found no cargo door defects. Nonetheless, the airline was
assigning mechanics to check the doors before each flight.
   The change had not yet been made on the United 747 used on Flight
811 before Friday's incident, airline officials said.
   Northwest Airlines began precautionary inspections of cargo doors
on Sunday, said spokesman Bob Gibbons, and intends to complete them
on the 26 affected planes by tonight. Improved locks had earlier
been installed on 15 other jumbo jets, he said.
   Pan Am said through spokesman Jeffrey Kriendler that it was in
full compliance with the order for its 35 jumbo jets before the
accident.
   Trans World Airlines had already modified cargo door systems on
all 19 of its jumbo jets, said spokesman Don Morrison. But on
Saturday, he said, the airline ordered ``beefed up surveillance'' of
the cargo door area for all TWA flights using 747s.
   The July order required prompt inspections of locks after a Pan
Am jet's front cargo door opened slightly during a March 1987
flight, causing no damage or injuries.
   Boeing had recommended the alterations in service bulletins dated
Aug. 27, 1987, and April 14, 1988.
   The possibility of a cargo door failure raises a problem the U.S.
aviation industry thought it had licked years ago and one that is
separate from recent concern over aging aircraft and terrorist bombs.
   Although recent cargo door problems have not been given urgency
by the FAA, earlier cargo door incidents were more serious and led
to a series of FAA orders and industry changes.
   When a Turkish Air DC-10 crashed near Paris in 1974, killing 346
people, investigators determined that the loss of the cargo door
caused sudden depressurization, buckling the floor of the aircraft
and snapping control cables.
   Since then, floors have been strengthened and other design
changes made in both the DC-10s, manufactured by McDonnell Douglas,
and in Boeing 747s.

   Iran's parliament voted today to give
Britain a week to alter its reaction to Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's death decree against author Salman Rushdie or ties will
be severed, the government news agency said.
   In an earlier dispatch, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
said parliament had voted to break diplomatic ties with Britain,
which last week recalled its diplomats from Tehran to protest
Khomeini's ``death sentence.''
   Britain also asked Iran's envoys to leave London.
   Khomeini on Feb. 14 ordered Moslems to seek out and kill Rushdie
for his novel ``The Satanic Verses.'' Many Moslems consider the book
blasphemous.
   Fourteen other Western nations, including West Germany, have
withdrawn their top diplomats from Iran in the furor over Khomeini's
death decree.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said ``nearly all'' of the 201
deputies present in the 270-member Majlis, or parliament, voted fore
the measure, standing and cheering and praising the prophet Mohammed
and his descendants.
   To become law, the bill must be approved by the Council of
Guardians, a group of six Islamic religious leaders and six lawyers
that IRNA said would likely convene today to consider the measure.
   Britain and Iran all but broke ties after an Iranian diplomat was
arrested on shoplifting charges in Britain in May 1987 and a British
diplomat was detained and beaten in retaliation.
   They restored ties late last year, with Britain reopening its
embassy building in December for the first time in eight years.
   Khomeini said last week that the policy of restoring Iran's
contacts with the West, pursued by the moderates in the government,
was a mistake because the West was constantly hatching plots against
Iran.

   Attackers raided a Sinhalese village of
rice farmers in eastern Sri Lanka, shooting or hacking to death at
least 32 people _ nine of them children, officials said today.
   Police and military officials blamed the attack on a separatist
Tamil guerrilla group, but a spokesman for the group denied
responsibility.
   The target of Monday night's attack was the village of Welikande
in the Polonnaruwa district about 100 miles northeast of Colombo,
according to the police, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A military official in Colombo said the bodies of 19 men, four
women, and nine children were found. He said most of the victims
were hacked to death but some of the men were shot. He said two
village men were also missing.
   The police blamed the attack on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, the most powerful of the Tamil separatist groups that have
been waging a bloody campaign of guerrilla warfare and massacres
since 1983.
   The ethnic struggle against the Sinhalese majority of this island
off the southern tip of India has claimed more than 8,500 lives.
   The Welikande attack was the third massacre this month blamed on
the Tigers in northeastern Sri Lanka. At least 75 people died in the
three attacks.
   On Feb. 11 in Dutuwewa, 36 Sinhalese were shot and stabbed to
death. On Feb. 22 at Sinhapura, seven Sinhalese were killed.
   The Tigers' information office in London denied the first two
attacks were the work of their people. In telexes to Colombo
newspapers, the Tigers blamed the Dutuwewa and Sinhapura raids on
``quislings of the Indian government'' trying to discredit the
Tigers.
   A Tiger leader telephoned The Associated Press on Monday to deny
his men were behind the Welikande killings. Speaking of all three
attacks, he said: ``These killings are being done by armed groups
who want to discredit our just struggle on behalf of the Tamil
people.''
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, he added: ``They are being
done to give the Indian occupationary forces and the Sri Lankan army
and police a right to kill Tamils.'' He did not elaborate.
   An Indian peacekeeping force has been deployed in Sri Lanka since
the summer of 1987 in an effort to disarm the Tigers.
   A former Tamil rebel leader from a rival group claimed the Tigers
were on ``a headline-hunting exercise.''
   Vartharaja Perumal, now chief minister of the northeastern
administrative council, said the Tigers had been ``badly mauled'' by
Indian troops and were ``showing off their fangs by killing innocent
Sinhalese.''
   Perumal used to be the leader of the Eelam People's Revolutionary
Liberation Front, which once fought alongside the Tigers but now
says it has surrendered its arms in an effort to enter the political
mainstream.
   He is in Colombo this week to press his demands for the
government to embark on a promised rehabilitation project for the
predominantly Tamil northeast.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people and say they are discriminated against in jobs and
education by the Sinhalese majority that dominates the government
and military.
   Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, account for 75 percent of
the population. There also is a small Moslem minority and an even
smaller Christian community.

<HEAD>Austrian Team Reportedly Reached Mount McKinley Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALKEETNA, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A three-member Austrian party have
reported reaching the summit of Mount McKinley, according to the
pilot who flew them to North America's highest mountain two weeks
ago.
   A Japanese party was reported ``high on the mountain,'' and a
lone climber from Anchorage hopes to reach the top via the
treacherous Cassin Ridge route, the National Park Service said.
   Pilot Doug Geeting said Monday he established radio contact with
the Austrian party Sunday and was told all three members had reached
the summit of the 20,320-foot mountain.
   Geeting said the Austrians didn't say which day they reached the
top. Monday, they were at a base camp at 7,200 feet, awaiting a
flight out, but harsh weather restricted aviation.
   Up to this year, mountaineers had accomplished winter ascents of
McKinley nine times, with most traveling in parties. In 1988, Vern
Tejas, a professional climbing guide from Anchorage, became the
first person to climb McKinley alone in the winter and survive the
trip.
   The Austrian party of professional guides led by Helmut
Steinmassl, 29, began its expedition Feb. 14, a day before the
Japanese party of three began its ascent. Geeting and the Park
Service said the exact location of the Japanese climbers was not
known. The group was led by Nobura Yamada, 39.
   ``All we've heard about the Japanese is that they're hunkered
down,'' Park Service Ranger Bob Seibert said. ``I'm sure they can't
move in those winds.''
   The Austrians had relatively favorable weather for their climb,
Seibert said, but conditions changed drastically by Monday as fierce
gusts swept over wide regions of Alaska, including the McKinley area.
   The solo climber, 33-year-old Dave Staley, began his climb Sunday
and planned to follow the Cassin Ridge route, Park Service spokesman
John Quinley said. Such an ascent has been accomplished only once by
a team and never by an individual climber, he said.
   The Cassin Ridge is ``a lot steeper than the West Buttress
(route) ... and it has a lot fewer sheltered camping sites,''
Quinley said.

<HEAD>Radicals Claim Responsibility for Funeral Day Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ultra-leftist group claimed today it planted the
bomb that exploded on a highway embankment shortly before Emperor
Hirohito's funeral procession passed, according to a member of an
affiliated group.
   ``We received a communique today from the Revolutionary Army,
saying that they had set the explosion,'' a member of the Kakurokyo,
or Revolutionary Workers Association, told The Associated Press.
   He quoted the communique as saying: ``We carried out the
revolutionary ... offensive to directly attack the funeral
motorcade.''
   The group also threatened to conduct similar attacks on other
events related to the accession of Hirohito's son, Emperor Akihito,
he said. Such events are expected to continue for more than a year.
   The blast Friday occurred about 20 minutes before the motorcade
passed the site in Chofu, west central Tokyo.
   The bomb, hidden in the embankment, scattered mud and debris on
the pavement. No injuries were reported, and workers hurriedly
cleared the debris.
   Members of the imperial family, police escorts and the hearse
carrying Hirohito's body were in the 30-car motorcade that passed
the blast area without stopping en route to the imperial burial site
in Tokyo's western suburbs.
   The radical said the Revolutionary Army is closely affiliated
with Kakurokyo, believed to be Japan's second-largest ultra-leftist
group. He refused to elaborate.
   Police estimate Kakurokyo membership to be in the hundreds.
   Meanwhile, police said today that leaflets claiming
responsibility for the blast in the name of the Revolutionary Army
were distributed by radicals at universities in the Tokyo area.

<HEAD>Report: Winnie Mandela Reportedly Initiated Attacks on Three Men</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winnie Mandela personally initiated an attack
on four young men in her home, using her fists and a rawhide whip to
beat them, including a teen-ager who later died, the surviors
reportedly said in affidavits.
   According to sources who have seen the men's affidavits, Mrs.
Mandela's live-in bodyguards _ known as the Mandela United soccer
club _ then attacked them with whips and bottles and throwing them
against the walls, the Los Angeles Times reported today.
   Mrs. Mandela, wife of jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, has denied knowledge of the death of 14-year-old
Stompie Mokhetsi Seipei. The Times said she refused requests for
interviews.
   The Times said none of the three men making the affidavits claim
to have been seriously injured by Mrs. Mandela's attacks, although
they are said to still have scars and other marks from the alleged
beatings meted out by the bodyguards.
   The newspaper quoted the sources as saying affidavits also show
Seipei was suspended by his feet and repeatedly dropped on his head.
   He was taken from the house by the bodyguards two days later. His
body, beaten beyond recognition and stabbed twice, was found in a
field on Jan. 7.
   The graphic descriptions of the night of Dec. 29, when the four
blacks were allegedly abducted from a Methodist church hostel in
Soweto and held at Mrs. Mandela's home, are contained in the sworn
statements the surviving men made to their attorney.
   Details of the affidavits were obtained by the Times from sources
in the anti-apartheid movement familiar with the statements and the
efforts of civic leaders to win the men's freedom. The sources spoke
on condition of anonymity, the Times said.
   The allegation that Mrs. Mandela whipped the four and instigated
the beatings has been reported previously, including on Feb. 12, by
the South African newspaper The Sunday Star, which did not identify
its sources.
   Geoff Budlender, the attorney for the three men, has said they
told him in affidavits that Mrs. Mandela was involved in the events
on the night they were abducted and beaten. He has refused to give
more details or release the affidavits. He said today he did not
know the source of the Times' story.
   Five people have been charged in connection with the death.
Police said the investigation is continuing.
   According to the Times, the affidavits show Seipei and the three
men, ages 20, 20 and 29, were kidnapped and taken to Mrs. Mandela's
large home in Diepkloof Extension, a well-to-do Soweto neighborhood.
   At the house, they reported, Mrs. Mandela punched and used a whip
to hit Seipei and the oldest man, the Times said.
   She demanded that Seipei admit to being a police informant, but
he refused, the Times said.

   The city's ambulance service has filed a criminal
complaint against a hospital for allegedly failing to treat an
89-year-old woman who died 17 minutes after she was brought to the
emergency room, a spokeswoman said.
   Clara Dickson was brought to the private Montefiore Hospital in
the city's Bronx borough Sunday afternoon and went into cardiac
arrest.
   Lynn Schulman, a spokeswoman for the city's Emergency Medical
Service, said Dickson was not given quick help, even though
paramedics ``told an emergency room nurse they had a patient in
critical and worsening condition.''
   ``Apparently, there was some kind of a dispute between the
hospital staff and EMS about whether or not they were going to take
the woman,'' said a police spokesman, Sgt. Edward Burns.
   Schulman said EMS filed a complaint against the hospital with the
state Health Department and a criminal complaint with the Police
Department. Both agencies are investigating the complaint.
   A hospital spokesman disputed the charges, stating that Dickson
was treated ``immediately.''
   ``We believe our treatment was aggressive, speedy and
appropriate,'' said the spokesman, Fred Yaeger.

<HEAD>Praise For Nuclear Weapons Site Cleanup Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists, workers and lawmakers
welcomed an agreement to clean up the nation's most contaminated
nuclear weapons production site but said they would have to fight
for the billions of dollars needed to do the job.
   State and federal officials at a Washington, D.C., signing
ceremony Monday said the landmark agreement will provide a ``clear
road map'' for cleaning up the 570-square-mile Hanford nuclear
reservation and serve as a model for other Energy Department weapons
plants.
   ``It's an amiable agreement which is long overdue,'' said Mike
Fox, head of The Hanford Family, a group of about 300 Hanford
workers, relatives and supporters.
   Under the agreement, the department has promised to seek $2.8
billion for the cleanup over five years, but the appropriation has
yet to be endorsed by the Bush administration's Office of Management
and Budget and submitted to Congress for approval.
   After five years, the agreement calls for the state and the
Energy Department to come up with additional requests to finance
continued cleanup, which the department estimates could cost $57
billion.
   ``The cost ... means we need to win $1.9 billion per year in this
era of budget deficit-fighting in order for this agreement to clean
up Hanford within 30 years,'' said Gerald Pollett, who has been
lobbying for a cleanup on behalf of Heart of America Northwest.
   ``We are still going to have to fight for these funds,'' said
Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., a member of the House Appropriations
Committee.
   Key provisions of the 300-page agreement include:
   _ An accelerated program for cleaning up Hanford over 30 years,
rather than 50 years as originally envisioned.
   _ Specific cleanup milestones, with fines against the Energy
Department of up to $10,000 a week if it fails to meet the goals.
   _ Clear delineation of duties between the state, the Energy
Department and the federal Environmental Protection Agency.
   _ Justice Department agreement to allow enforcement through
lawsuits filed by the state or private parties.
   The federal government also agreed to provide the state with $2.9
million during the next three years to pay for monitoring.
   The agreement followed more than a year of negotiations and state
threats to go to court if the talks failed.
   The Energy Department released documents estimating that 5
billion cubic yards of hazardous solid and liquid wastes, both
radioactive and toxic, have been dumped at Hanford, which straddles
the Columbia River about 150 miles southeast of Seattle.
   The documents said ``above-background concentrations'' of
substances such as tritium, Iodine-129, uranium and cyanide have
been found in groundwater beneath Hanford and may threaten the
river. It also said releases of hazardous compounds continue.
   Tim Connor of the Hanford Education Action League of Spokane
welcomed the agreement but said it ``does nothing to expedite the
ending of liquid radioactive waste discharges directly into the
ground at Hanford.'' He said his group might sue to stop the
discharges.
   Besides being the most contaminated of the Energy Department's 16
nuclear weapons production sites, the Hanford reservation is
expected to be the most costly to clean up and take the longest.
   The site contains more than 60 percent of the nation's high-level
radioactive waste generated by weapons programs dating to World War
II.
   Scientists at the reservation worked on the bomb that was dropped
at Nagasaki. In the 1950s, Hanford was one of the largest weapon's
production complexes.
   At present, only one commercial nuclear power plant is operating
at the reservation and the department has announced plans to phase
out all weapons production at the site.

   Character actor Joe Silver, who appeared in more
than 1,000 TV shows and whose Broadway career spanned almost 50
years from ``Tobacco Road'' to ``Legs Diamond,'' has died at age 66.
   He died Monday of cancer.
   Silver made his Broadway debut in 1942 in ``Tobacco Road'' and
later appeared in New York in such shows as ``Gypsy'' (1959), ``The
Zulu and the Zayda'' (1965), ``You Know I Can't Hear You When the
Water's Running'' (1967) and ``Lenny'' (1971).
   In ``Lenny,'' the story of comedian Lenny Bruce, Silver played
nine roles and was nominated for a Tony award for best supporting
actor.
   The actor also appeared in more than 1,000 television shows
beginning in 1947 as a panelist on ``What's It Worth?'' He also was
in Red Buttons' television series in the early 1950s and in ``Fay''
with Lee Grant on NBC.
   His films included ``Switching Channels,'' ``The Gig,'' ``Almost
You,'' ``Rhinoceros'' and ``The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz.''
   Silver also had widespread credits off-Broadway, starring most
recently in ``Old Business'' at the New York Shakespeare Festival
Public Theater.
   He was a regular at the Burt Reynolds Jupiter Theater in Florida,
starring in ``I'm Not Rappaport'' and ``Teahouse of the August
Moon.''
   Silver's last stage role was as gangster Arnold Rothstein in
``Legs Diamond,'' the Peter Allen musical that closed Feb. 19 after
a short run.
   He is survived by his wife, actress Chevi Colton, a son,
Christopher, and a daughter, Jennifer, all of New York.

<BYLINE>Consortium Plans Lunar, Martian Landscape Simulator in Albuquerque

<TEXT>
   A consortium of businesses and research
institutions hopes a visit to Albuquerque will be like life on
another planet for some space engineers and scientists in the 1990s.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is expected to
decide by 1992 whether to recommend lunar colonization or a manned
mission to Mars in the early 21st century.
   In preparation, Los Alamos National Laboratory, the University of
New Mexico, the Air Force, the Army Corps of Engineers and several
New Mexico businesses are proposing the nation's first
extraterrestrial environment simulator, in Albuquerque at an
estimated cost of about $5.5 million.
   ``This fits right in with Lovelace (Medical Center in
Albuquerque) picking the Mercury astronauts,'' Los Alamos spokesman
Jeff Schwartz said in a telephone interview Monday. ``New Mexico has
been at the frontier of the space age since there was a space age.''
   Members of the consortium met here Monday with NASA officials to
discuss the project, called the Center for Extraterrestrial
Engineering and Construction, or CETEC. Talks were expected to
continue all week.
   Steve Howe, a program coordinator in Los Alamos' Energy and
Technology Initiatives Office, said it's possible to have CETEC
operating in 1{ to two years. He estimated a six-year cost of about
$5.5 million.
   ``That's less than a million a year,'' he said.
   About 65 scientists, engineers, contractors and government
officials attended Monday's session, Howe said.
   He said the basic configuration of CETEC would be ``a couple of
tanks doing tele-operated or robotic experiments ... vacuum tanks
that would simulate the conditions on the moon, where there's no
atmosphere.''
   He said experiments would address several key questions:
   ``How do you dig, how do you drill, how do you lay foundations,
can you make concrete out of the soil, can you make structural glass
out of the soil, can you extract oxygen from the soil to manufacture
fuel?''
   Consortium members would put up about $2 million worth of
equipment, land and expertise, he said, noting that the Air Force
already has the 60-foot-long, 16-foot-diameter steel vacuum tubes
needed for the project at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque.
   ``We are ready to contribute that if NASA comes in and says we're
ready to go,'' Howe said.
   He said rock formations in Minnesota and Iceland closely match
lunar composition and would be imported for the experiments.
   Jerry Leigh, senior technical adviser for UNM's New Mexico
Engineering Research Institute, said the university is prepared to
donate land in its academic research park south of Kirtland. Howe
said the site would be 2 to 5 acres, and UNM's land offer is a
selling point to NASA.
   He said the NASA has been encouraging.
   ``They clearly have other proposals, and to that extent they are
neutral, but ... we feel we're kind of aware of NASA's position, and
they're providing very good input as to where the national space
program may be going.''

<HEAD>U.S. Troops Block South Korean Dissidents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. troops today blocked South Korean
dissidents who were trying to reach the Panmunjom border truce site
to organize unsanctioned reunification talks with representatives of
communist North Korea.
   Culture and Information Minister Choe Byung-yul warned in a
statement that the government ``will be compelled to take
countermeasures'' should the dissidents try to meet with North
Korean officials at the border.
   He did not elaborate.
   The 30 dissidents blocked today were trying to get to nearby
Panmunjom to arrange a ``pan-national congress'' for Wednesday. The
radical United National Democratic Movement of Korea, or
Chonminnyon, had stated its intention to hold such a meeting
Wednesday at Panmunjom with 10 delegates from each side.
   The U.S. troops who help guard the area held back the dissidents,
who tried to force their way through one gate at the site and rush a
second gate, until South Korean police removed the protesters, a
U.S. military spokesman said.
   The American soldiers who help guard the Panmunjom border site
are among 42,000 Washington has in South Korea under a mutual
defense pact.
   The Democratic Movement, embracing about 200 radical groups in
the south, proposed the Wednesday meeting in January, and North
Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland
accepted it Feb. 15.
   Choe, the chief government spokesman, said the government ``wants
to make it clear that it will never tolerate the arbitrary attempts
by Chonminnyon or any other organization to contact North Korea
without consulting the authorities'' on an important issue like
unification of the two Koreas.
   He said ``attempts to call a pan-national congress at this
juncture would in no way serve to improve south-north relations and
would only lead the North Koreans to misjudge the situation.''
   North and South Korea have been holding talks on trying to
improve relations. The north has been demanding a halt to annual
U.S.-South Korean military exercises before agreeing to further
progress.
   Choe also said Chonminnyon's attempts to work with the North
Korean committee, an affiliate of the North Korean Communist Party,
to convene a pan-national congress would only encourage the North's
strategy of causing chaos in the South.
   Chonminnyon, which takes an anti-government, anti-U.S. stand,
maintains that the government has no right to monopolize
inter-Korean dialogue. It charges that the government is not
sincerely interested in seeking unification with the north through
dialogue.
   Panmunjom is a restricted area inside the Demilitarized Zone that
separates the capitalist South from the North. The two Koreas were
divided in 1945 at the end of World War II.

<HEAD>Schools Chancellor Plans To Purge `Axe' and `Youse'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's schools chancellor is declaring war on
bad speech with an edict to students: Don't ``youse'' guys ``axe''
any questions.
   In a memo to Mayor Edward I. Koch released Monday, Chancellor
Richard Green singled out 20 ``speech demons'' _ incorrect phrases
or pronunciations, some of them New Yorkers' own creations _ that he
means to eliminate from students' conversation.
   To wit: ``axe'' instead of ``ask,'' ``youse'' instead of ``you''
and ``he be'' instead of ``he is.'' Green's list also includes
``liberry'' instead of ``library'' _ an error Koch has acknowledged
making himself.
   ``Superb,'' pronounced the mayor, who has been nudging the
chancellor for some time to do something about the way students
speak.
   Green also plans to declare a Putting Your Best Speech Forward
Day and said he will convene educators in April to come up with a
long-term program.

<HEAD>Marcos-Linked Condo Sold for $3.7 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philippine government has sold for $3.7
million a Manhattan condominium said to have been owned by deposed
President Ferdinand Marcos, and it is seeking buyers for two other
properties.
   The seven-bedroom apartment on the 43rd floor of the Olympic
Towers, a glass tower next to St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth
Avenue, was sold Monday to an unidentified buyer, said Teresa Roxas,
spokeswoman for the Philippine Commission on Good Government.
   The property was surrendered to the Philippine government in 1986
by a Marcos associate, Antonio Floirendo, as part of a deal to avoid
prosecution.
   The condominium was among holdings allegedly purchased with some
of the $10 billion that the Philippine government claims Marcos and
his associates stole from the nation's treasury before he was ousted
and fled to Hawaii in 1986.
   Marcos' wife, Imelda, has pleaded innocent in New York to federal
racketeering charges and is free on $5 million bail. Lawyers have
argued that Marcos, 71, is too ill to appear in court. He is
hospitalized in Honolulu.
   The commission also is looking for buyers for the $4.5 million
Lindenmere estate on New York's Long Island and a $2.5 million home
in Honolulu. Both of them, like the condominium, allegedly were
owned by Marcos through fronts.
   The commission also is fighting in court to gain title to four
commercial buildings in Manhattan worth an estimated $400 million,
Roxas said.
   The condominium was the second piece of Marcos-linked real estate
in the United States sold by the commission. A home in Princeton,
N.J., sold in 1987 for $1 million.
   Nievelena Rosete, a commission member in Manila, said profits
from the sale will help finance the government's land reform program.

   Some need help in tracking down
missing spouses. Others appeal for government benefits. And they
come to President Corazon Aquino as their court of last resort.
   Every year, thousands of ordinary Filipinos turn to Mrs. Aquino,
as they did to her predecessors, for help with the mundane problems
of life and in side-stepping a bloated, cumbersome bureaucracy and
ineffectual local government.
   They might not be the sort of problems that would involve the
White House.
   But in a paternalistic society, tradition demands that the boss
take care of subordinates. The president is not only expected to
wrestle with complex issues of statecraft but also unravel red tape
and intercede on behalf of the average Filipino.
   ``With a historical background of colonialism and a succession of
governors-general in Spanish and American times, the datus (native
chiefs) and sultans before that, the Filipino has been oriented to a
strong, one-man leadership as the source of all solutions,'' wrote
commentator Luis Beltran in The Manila Standard.
   Ricardo Galing, director of the presidential Office of Public
Assistance, said his department processed more than 30,000 requests
for assistance in 1987, the last year when complete records were
available.
   The office was established in the 1950s and maintains a staff of
about 100 people to help with citizen complaints.
   Galing said some of the appeals come from town mayors, village
officials and even congressmen seeking help from constituents. But
most come from ordinary people, he said.
   ``About 80 percent of those who come here to ask the government
for help are our brothers and sisters in the depressed areas of the
country,'' Galing said.
   He said the most common requests involve applications for
government jobs, medical assistance or resolving rental, labor and
property disputes.
   A few seek help in marital disputes or tracking down spouses who
went abroad for work and disappeared, he said. There were no figures
on how many problems had been resolved to the satisfaction of the
applicant.
   ``Sometimes, we just refer walk-ins to the proper government
office and call ahead to say that so-and-so is on his way and to
help them,'' Galing said. ``Sometimes we have to refer the problem
in writing for a response.''
   Others put their problems directly to Mrs. Aquino in her weekly
radio broadcast, ``Ask The President,'' which the government radio
network carries every Sunday night.
   The government's Philippine Information Agency solicits and
screens the questions. Mrs. Aquino answers about a dozen of them
every week _ but sometimes short of what the supplicants had hoped
for.
   One caller, Alberto Tangapa of Cagayan de Oro, appealed recently
for a government job so he could overcome ``the injustices our
family had suffered due to the cruel society to which we belong.''
   ``Please submit your application to the Department of Labor,''
Mrs. Aquino replied. ``If you are qualified and if there are
available positions, you may be hired.''
   During another recent broadcast, a resident of Rizal province
complained that his neighbor's fence was blocking the pathway to his
home.
   ``The mayor knows what they are doing is illegal but they won't
stop it,'' he complained. ``What can we do?''
   ``Before I give a rightful answer to your problem, I first want
to know all the details,'' Mrs. Aquino responded. She ordered the
Land Management Bureau to look into the dispute.

<HEAD>Anonymous Caller Demands Release of Arab Prisoners For Soldier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY SEDOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anonymous caller belonging to a group
claiming to hold captive a missing Israeli paratrooper today
demanded the release of 1,500 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for
the soldier's freedom.
   Speaking Hebrew with an Arab accent, the caller told Israel radio
the 21-year-old soldier would be killed if the demand was not met.
   Also today, the army said a 25-year-old Palestinian was killed by
troops during the night during a clash in the occupied West Bank
village of Deir Abziye. Atwa Lufti Daromar died of a bullet wound to
the head, according to doctors at Ramallah Hospital.
   The death brought to 387 the number of Palestinians killed in the
14-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Seventeen Israelis also have died.
   Underground leaders of the uprising, meanwhile, ordered vehicles
off the streets during a general strike in the occupied territories
and Arab east Jerusalem.
   The shutdown was called to ensure that a Palestine Liberation
Organization-ordered boycott of today's municipal elections was
observed by east Jerusalem's 70,000 Arab voters. Leaflets said ``hit
teams'' would punish Palestinians who broke the transportation ban.
   Because of the elections for local representatives in 147 cities
and counties, the army ordered the occupied territories sealed from
midnight Monday to 10 p.m. tonight, barring West Bank and Gaza Strip
residents from entering Israel.
   Protests broke out in Gaza City and in the West Bank town of
Tulkarem. Arab medical workers reported two Palestinians were shot.
   Israel radio reporter Elihu Ben-On said the anonymous caller told
the station his group would release a videotape cassette showing the
missing Israeli soldier, Avi Sassportas, who disappeared 13 days ago.
   ``He said `We are the organization that is holding the soldier
and we want you to release 1,500 prisoners. If not, the soldier will
die,''' Ben-On told The Associated Press.
   He said the caller hung up immediately and the call lasted no
more than 15 seconds. The caller did not name the group he claimed
to represent.
   On Monday, a similar call to the Agence France-Presse news agency
said a group called the Palestinian Arab Army was holding the
soldier.
   The Palestinian Arab Army was not publicly known before the call,
but West Bank commander Amram Mitzna said it has been operating
since the start of the Palestinian uprising.
   He told Israel radio that Israel did not plan to comply with the
demand to release prisoners.
   An army spokesman said the call to Israel radio was being taken
seriously. ``We are checking every possibility,'' he said. He could
not be identified under army regulations.
   Army figures indicate as many as 9,000 Palestinians have been
jailed in connection with the uprising.
   Army officials said Monday that a PLO faction, the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, claimed last week that it was
holding the soldier. The claim was withheld by authorities at the
time.
   Sassportas disappeared Feb. 16 after leaving his base in southern
Israel to return home to Ashdod. He was last seen near Ashkelon,
wearing his uniform and armed with an M-16 assault rifle. The area
is close to the Gaza Strip.
   Some 2.7 million Israelis were expected to vote in today's
elections. Political analysts predict a rise in the power of
religious parties, mirroring the gains of the November national
elections when the religious parties added four seats to the 14
already held in the 120-member parliament.
   In Jerusalem, Mayor Teddy Kollek is expected to win a sixth term.
Mayor Shlomo Lahat is expected to win a fourth term in Tel Aviv.
   Among Israel's voters are 400,000 Arab citizens who are eligible
to cast ballots for 48 municipalities and regional councils. There
are 99 municipalities in the Jewish sector.
   The Labor Party now controls 54 municipalities, while the Likud
bloc controls 26 town councils. The others are run by local
political organizations or religious parties.

<HEAD>Ban On Hazardous Waste From Other States Takes Effect Soon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than half the states may be barred
beginning Wednesday from burying hazardous waste in South Carolina
unless they supply information on their own disposal laws, officials
say.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell, who set the March 1 deadline in January,
said states would have to certify that they had no impediments to
disposal within their borders, or that the repeal of such
impediments was imminent, to be allowed to continue sending their
waste to South Carolina.
   The order affects South Carolina's GSX landfill, which holds
close to a billion pounds of hazardous waste, about 70 percent from
out of state. Some 33 states, Puerto Rico and the District of
Columbia used the facility in 1987.
   State environmental officials sent letters to all 50 states and
Puerto Rico, informing them of Campbell's order. By Monday
afternoon, only 23 states had responded.
   ``Our policy has to be flexible enough to work with a state that
is genuinely moving to eliminate prohibitions,'' Campbell said
Monday. But, he said, ``I look for us to reach a point where there
will be some states that will be cut off.''
   Campbell said he hoped to see regional agreements that eliminated
impediments to waste treatment or burial and arrangements where one
state might handle a material that another state doesn't.
   ``The question is do you have a fair load sharing. That's the
kind of fairness we're looking for in this area,'' he said.
   Nine states _ North Carolina, Florida, Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Kentucky, Louisiana and Kansas _
accounted for about 40 percent of the waste going to GSX, officials
said.
   Hartsill Truesdale, head of the Department of Health and
Environmental Control's hazardous waste divison, would not say which
states had replied.
   GSX is one of only two commercial hazardous waste landfills in
the Southeast and accepts roughly 135,000 tons of chemical garbage
annually. The other landfill is in Alabama.

<TEXT>
   Israeli warplanes today bombed and
rocketed the Chouf Mountains southeast of Beirut, and police said
two Palestinian guerrillas were killed and 33 people were injured _
including 26 children.
   A police spokesman said the casualties were reported in the
village of Ainab, 10 miles southeast of Beirut. He said the dead
guerrillas were members of Naif Hawatmeh's Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist PLO faction.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named under police regulations, said
the children were wounded by shrapnel and flying glass in Ainab's
elementary school, about 200 yards from the base of the guerrilla
group.
   He said a rocket fired by one of six Israeli jets slammed into an
empty lot about 25 yards south of the school.
   The police spokesman said the jets also strafed bases belonging
to Syrian-backed guerrilla factions near the Druse villages of
Shemlan, Aitat and Bayssour. Those targets are about eight miles
southeast of Beirut.
   Democratic Front spokesman Suheil Natour said the group's base in
Ainab ``took several direct hits.''
   He said the front ``stresses its determination to step up the
struggle and military strikes against Israeli occupation forces.''
   U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Monday that
Democratic Front raids ``have a negative impact'' on the dialogue
between Washington and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The six Israeli fighter-bombers staged at least three bomb and
rocket attacks in 30 minutes, police said.
   An Israeli military spokesman said in Jerusalem that the raid was
directed against a command headquarters of the Democratic Front and
that all the jets returned safely after destroying their targets.
   Palestinian, Druse and Shiite Moslem militia gunners fired
anti-aircraft guns at the raiding planes from positions in the
mountains and around Beirut International Airport, but no hits were
reported, police said.
   Air traffic was brought to a standstill at the airport during the
raid, Israel's third on Lebanon this year, the police spokesman said.
   The Israeli said the air raid's target was used as headquarters
for guerrillas and as a point for organizing and launching attacks
against Israel and against Israeli targets in Israel's
self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon.
   The air strike coincided with the 20th anniversary of the
establishment of the Democratic Front, which lost three guerrillas
in a confrontation with Israeli-allied militiamen in south Lebanon
on Thursday.
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said Thursday's attack was
``another example of the inability of the PLO to fulfill its
declared statement of stopping terror.''
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat denounced terrorism during a meeting of
the Palestine National Council in November. The PLO maintains the
denunciation does not cover guerrilla attacks against Israeli
military targets.
   At least 128 people were killed and 356 wounded in 25 israeli air
raids on Lebanon last year.

   U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens denied having sex
with a teen-ager and said she set him up and asked him for money.
   The conservative Republican appeared publicly Monday in his
mostly rural district for the first time since the allegations
surfaced a month ago. He met with constituents at his office here
and gave several interviews.
   ``I was approached for money on the basis of the general
allegation,'' Lukens said. ``I said, `Hey, I'm not going to pay any
money. Nothing happened.'''
   A grand jury last week indicted the 58-year-old congressman on a
misdemeanor charge of contributing to the delinquency of a child by
having sex with the girl in November, when she was 16. The offense
carries up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Lukens, who is divorced, did not deny he knew the girl and said
he met with her on occasion.
   ``Did you have sex with (the girl)?'' he was asked in an
interview with Dayton TV station WDTN.
   ``No,'' Lukens replied.
   Lukens told the Dayton Daily News the girl approached him on more
than one occasion for money and that she threatened to go to police
and the news media.
   ``I believe that I was set up, and I know for a fact because I
was the person they asked for money,'' Lukens said in an interview
with The Associated Press.
   He vowed to complete his fourth term, which expires in 1990.
``The last reason I would ever think about resigning is because the
press wanted me to,'' he said.
   Columbus TV station WSYX secretly videotaped a meeting with Anna
Coffman at a fast-food restaurant in November in which she asked why
Lukens was ``messin' around'' with her daughter. Lukens told the
woman he thought her daughter was an adult, according to the
videotape, in which he also apparently offered the woman a job.
   The FBI said it found no evidence of bribery or extortion.
   The videotape was broadast Feb. 1.
   ``I didn't do it,'' Lukens told constituents during the office
meeting Monday. ``I'm going to be found innocent.''

   The doctor who wrote a letter attesting that John
Tower shows no signs of alcoholism says he didn't know it would be
used in a public campaign to rescue the former senator's nomination
as defense secretary.
   Dr. Warren Lichliter said he learned from reporters Sunday that
Tower had read a portion of the letter in TV interviews.
   The letter said an examination after Tower's recent colon surgery
showed ``no evidence at all of alcoholic impairment or alcoholism.''
   Lichliter, who is on the staff of Dallas' Baylor University
Medical Center, is not Tower's primary physician. He said he
prepared the letter because Dr. R.D. Dignan, who removed a benign
lump from Tower's colon in January, was out of town when Tower's
staff called and he routinely takes calls in Dignan's absence.
   Lichliter said he spoke Sunday with Dignan and Dignan ``backs the
letter 100 percent.''
   Dignan issued a statement earlier this month saying tests
``indicated no abnormalities within organ systems that might be
involved with alcohol abuse.''
   Calls to both doctors' offices Monday were referred to Steve
Habgood, Baylor University Medical Center spokesman.
   ``Both have indicated that their previous statements stand as
is,'' Habgood said.
   Tower, a Republican former senator from Texas, pledged to swear
off alcohol if approved as defense secretary.
   Allegations of a drinking problem were among the factors cited
when the Democrat-controlled Senate Armed Services Committee voted
11-9 along party lines Thursday to recommend that the full Senate
reject Tower's nomination.

   The murder trial of ``Night Stalker''
defendant Richard Ramirez may be aborted because his attorney is
suffering from nervous exhaustion after working on the case for 3{
years, a prosecutor said.
   Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan disclosed Monday that a doctor
has recommended psychological counseling for defense attorney Daniel
Hernandez. The physician said the lawyer needs four to six weeks off
to recover.
   ``The doctor feels he is not presently able to function
effectively as trial counsel,'' said Tynan, who would not disclose
the doctor's name.
   Testimony in the case began Jan. 30 after six months of jury
selection.
   ``Probably the chances of a mistrial are good,'' Deputy District
Attorney P. Philip Halpin told reporters. ``We can't keep this jury
hanging around indefinitely.''
   The judge scheduled a hearing on Hernandez' health for Wednesday
and ordered the lawyer to appear along with his co-counsel, Arturo
Hernandez, who is no relation.
   Arturo Hernandez left the trial without public explanation during
jury selection. Halpin said it was unlikely that he would be ordered
to take over for his ailing colleague.
   Ramirez, a 28-year-old drifter from El Paso, Texas, is charged
with 13 murders and 30 related felonies in grisly nighttime attacks
that terrorized Southern California in the summer of 1985.
   The press dubbed the killer, who often left behind drawings
associated with devil worship, the ``Night Stalker.''
   The cost of the case to Los Angeles County so far was not
available, but as of July it was $1.28 million in court and
investigatory fees, not including the $15,000 a month it cost to
keep Ramirez in a private jail cell.

   More than 200 fires have contributed to the deaths
of two firefighters, forced the temporary shutdown of a major power
line and scorched more than 6,000 drought-parched acres of brushland
across Florida.
   Wind of 10 to 25 mph Monday hampered hundreds of firefighters
trying to cope with the consequences of the months-long dry spell,
officials said.
   ``This is one of the worst years that I've seen, and we still
have a lot of dry months ahead of us,'' said David Utley, a state
forestry duty officer.
   The largest blaze was burning out of control today in the
Everglades west of Fort Lauderdale after blackening 2,700 acres
Monday and threatening power lines carrying electricity to South
Florida.
   At 8 a.m., a wall of fire 5{ miles long was heading away from
power lines and toward a highway, which firefighters hoped would act
as a fire break, officials said.
   Authorities have determined the blaze was set, said state
firefighter Michael Greenstein, adding that it began deep inside the
Everglades.
   ``There's just too much of the grasslands in the state'' to let
the fire burn itself out, said Jim Whitson, state forestry officer
in charge of the 400 foresters who have coordinated the battle
against the more than 200 fires since Sunday.
   Two volunteer firefighters who had just arrived at a grass fire
in the median of Interstate 75 in central Florida were killed when a
tractor-trailer slammed into their smoke-obscured pickup truck, the
Highway Patrol said.
   The deaths were the first by firefighters battling a wildfire in
Florida in more than four years, officials said.
   Three 500,000-volt transmission lines owned by Florida Power &amp;
Light were turned off when about 10 miles of lines were threatened
by fire near the Palm Beach-Broward County line, Utley said. ``We
had a helicopter up in the air dropping water on it and we had no
success whatsoever,'' he said.
   All three power lines were turned back on when the blaze died
down Monday night, and no blackouts were reported, said Stacey Shaw,
a utility spokeswoman.
   In 1985, an Everglades fire burned power lines and caused
blackouts from Lake Okeechobee to the Florida Keys, she said.
   Fires also covered 1,100-acres in Palm Beach County and 800 acres
near Fort Myers on the Gulf coast, Whitson said. A 500-acre brush
fire near Palatka in northern Florida forced the evacuation of
nearly 200 people for several hours and closed a highway Sunday.
   Showers may bring some relief to Central Florida on Thursday and
thunderstorms were expected Saturday for the northern two-thirds of
the state. No rain was in sight for South Florida through the
weekend.
   Most of the state has received only about half the normal
rainfall since November, the beginning of the six-month dry season.
The Miami area has received 7.5 inches of rain since September,
compared with an average rainfall of 24 inches for that period, the
weather service said.

<TEXT>
   About 500,000 angry Serbs massed in
Belgrade streets today to protest what they see as separatist
tendencies in Kosovo province, where an eight-day miners' strike
forced the resignation of three leaders.
   Yugoslav President Raif Dizdarevic addressed the crowd in front
of the federal parliament, promising the country's leadership would
``undertake all necessary measures'' to prevent Yugoslavia from
falling apart.
   The protesters frequently interrupted his speech with slogans
praising Serbia's Communist Party leader, Slobodan Milosevic.
   ``It is the duty of the presidency to defend the integrity of the
federation and the constitutional system of the country,''
Dizdarevic said.
   ``The presidency of Yugoslavia is undertaking and will undertake
all necessary measures, perscribed by the constitution and law, to
defend Yugoslavia, its system and security of all peoples in this
country,'' he said.
   Hundreds of ethnic Albanian miners ended their occupation of the
Trepca lead and zinc mine in Kosovo province Monday night after the
three provincial officials bowed to the strikers' demands and
resigned.
   However, the miners said they would not go back to work until all
their original demands are met, including abandonment of planned
changes in the constitution.
   The government imposed emergency measures in Kosovo province on
Monday.
   The three ethnic Albanian officials, including Kosovo's Communist
Party boss, Rahman Morina, were considered by the strikers as
supporters of the Communist Party in the republic of Serbia, which
has been demanding greater control over its nominally autonomous
province of Kosovo.
   Meanwhile, in a second lead and zinc mine Monday, 800 members of
Kosovo's Slav minority occupied their pits to protest the
resignations. Also denouncing the resignations at several protest
meetings in the province were thousands of Serbs and Montenegrins,
groups in the Slav minority in Kosovo.
   The province and other parts of the country were struck during
the past year with mass demonstrations by Slavs, who say their group
suffers discrimination from majority ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The
demonstrators called for greater Serbian control over Kosovo and
forced the ouster of dozens of national and regional leaders.
   Some protesters in Belgrade said they were prompted to march by a
televised report from Ljubljana, where leaders in the liberal
republic of Slovenia lent support to the striking miners. About
100,000 Slovenians signed a petition in Ljubljana protesting
introduction of emergency measures in Kosovo.
   Yugoslavia's state presidency, which imposed the emergency
measures in Kosovo province, said the constitutional system of the
country was jeopardized by the miners' strike and other work
stoppages by thousands of the miners' ethnic Albanian supporters in
Kosovo in the past week.
   The protests in Kosovo have centered on the ethnic Albanian
majority's worry that constitutional changes proposed by Serbia will
limit the province's autonomy. Yugoslav leaders have denied this.
   The collective leadership did not elaborate on the emergency
measures, but in an apparent show of force, military jets several
times flew over Pristina, the capital of Kosovo province.
   A long line of tanks was parked in front of the army barracks in
Pristina, and military vehicles full of soldiers were seen on a road
leading to Titova Mitrovica, site of the Trepca mine.
   Army reservists marched near the Trepca mine, indicating at least
a partial call-up in the region.

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Konrad Lorenz, the Austrian scientist who
won a Nobel Prize for his pioneering studies of human and animal
behavior, has died at age 85.
   The Austrian Academy of Sciences said today that Lorenz died
Monday night at his home at Altenburg, about 30 miles northeast of
Vienna. The Austria Press Agency said he died of kidney failure.
   Lorenz was the country's most famous scientist. He held
doctorates in medicine, zoology and psychology.
   In 1973, his studies on the organization of individual and group
behavior patterns won him the Nobel Prize in medicine together with
Karl von Frisch and Nikolaas Tinbergen.
   Lorenz turned to research in animal behavior shortly after
obtaining his medical degree. He had become an animal lover as a
child, collecting a variety of animals at his expansive boyhood home
outside Vienna.
   The collection included fish, dogs, monkeys, insects and
especially ducks and geese.
   His first important findings concerned the social life of birds.
Those studies convinced him that many aspects of the birds' behavior
were innate and instinctive, rather than learned.
   His views were controversial, and they became even more
controversial when he suggested that such instinctive behavior might
be important in humans, too.
   One of his best known findings was that young animals will, at
some time in their lives, become strongly attached to their
biological mothers, a process known as imprinting.
   He showed that the process could be altered, however, by
demonstrating that mallard ducklings would happily follow a human
who greeted them shortly after birth and imitated a mother's
quacking.
   Born in Vienna on Nov. 7, 1903, the son of a surgeon, Lorenz was
awarded his first doctorate in medicine at age 25. Further studies
in zoology and psychology followed in Vienna and New York,
culminating in a 1933 doctorate based on his research on the
behavior of birds.
   In 1939, Lorenz was given a chair in psychology at the
prestigious Immanuel Kant university in Koenigsberg, then a German
town and today the Soviet port of Kaliningrad.
   His tenure there and publications during that time led in later
years to allegations that Lorenz was a Nazi sympathizer.
   When accepting the Nobel Prize, he apologized for a 1940
publication judged to reflect Nazi views of science, saying that
``many highly decent scientists hoped, like I did, for a short time
for good from National Socialism, and many quickly turned away from
it with the same horror as I.''
   After World War II, Lorenz returned to Vienna, where he lectured
at the university and published dozens of books.
   One of his most controversial publications was the 1966 study,
``On Aggression,'' in which he asserted that aggressive impulses are
to some degree innate, drawing on analogies between human and animal
behavior.
   Later best-selling books included ``The Eight Deadly Sins of
Civilized Humanity,'' a plea against overpopulation and
environmental destruction, and ``The Decay of the Humane,'' a gloomy
look at mankind's future that sold 390,000 copies.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Druge Abuse Down Among High School Seniors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug abuse among high school seniors continued
to decline last year and reached its lowest level since 1975, a
national survey released today showed.
   The National High School Seniors Survey found a significant drop
in cocaine use for the second year in a row as well as a decrease in
use of crack cocaine, and continuation of the gradual decline in use
of marijuana.
   ``We can safely say that these decreases suggest that high school
seniors ... are hearing the messages about cocaine's dangers and are
avoiding drug use in general,'' said Charles R. Schuster, director
of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, sponsor of the survey.
   However, ``drug abuse in our youth still remains a major public
health problem,'' he said, noting that one of every eight high
school seniors tries cocaine before graduation and one of every two
seniors has used an illegal drug at least once.
   The survey, which has been conducted by the University of
Michigan's Institute for Social Research every year since 1975,
found that the proportion of high school seniors who reported having
ever used an illegal drug dropped to 53.9 percent in 1988. That is
the lowest level recorded since the survey began, when the rate was
55.2 percent.
   While the use of marijuana has been declining since a peak of
27.7 percent in the high school class of 1979, the level reported
for last year _ 21.4 percent _ remains higher than the rate of 19
percent reported in the first year of the survey.
   The proportion of seniors who have used cocaine at least once
dropped from 15 percent in 1987 to 12 percent in 1988, and the
proportion who said they had used cocaine at least once in the last
30 days dropped from 4.3 percent in 1987 to 3.4 percent in 1988.
   The survey also showed that 40 percent of those who had tried
cocaine also have used crack, a cheap and highly addictive form of
cocaine. However, the proportion of those who said they had used
crack at least once dropped from 5.6 percent in 1987 to 4.8 percent
last year.
   Some 16,300 high school seniors from 135 schools nationwide were
questioned for the survey.

<HEAD>Plan Adopted, But Vote Follows Racial Lines</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with blacks threatening lawsuit over new
plan, background on busing order.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A racially divided Boston School Committee has
adopted a plan allowing parents to choose the schools their children
attend, but blacks vowed to fight it, charging it will mean
resegregation of the city's schools.
   The nine whites on the committee voted for the plan Monday night.
The four blacks voted against, and one of them, John O'Bryant, said,
``We're going to end up where we were _ in court.''
   Opponents said it may resegregate schools. Supporters said
resegregation is not an issue because less than 25 percent of the
system's 55,000 students are white.
   U.S. District Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. ordered Boston's
schools desegregated in 1974, resulting in many students being bused
outside their neighborhoods to achieve racial balance. The busing
resulted in violent protests by whites.
   Garrity relinquished control over the nation's oldest school
system in 1985, but the busing plan has remained in effect.
   The new plan divides the city into three zones, each designed to
include people of all backgrounds.
   Parents will be given a choice of schools within the zone in
which they live, and will get their choice unless it causes
overcrowding or upsets a school's racial balance.
   The plan calls for all schools to reflect the racial breakdown in
its zone.
   Black members of the School Committee threatened to file a
federal lawsuit to block the plan.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
the main plaintiff in the 1974 desegregation case, said the plan
does not ensure that schools will improve.
   Louis Elisa, vice president of the Boston chapter of the NAACP,
called the plan ``the moral equivalent of a cheap coat of paint on
an old, rusted, broken-down car of segregation.''
   ``The car cannot move forward, and the paint will not last,'' he
said.
   School Committeeman Daniel Burke said, ``This plan is no panacea,
but it's a start.'' Charles Willie, a consultant hired by Mayor
Raymond L. Flynn to draft a student assignment plan, said it is
``light years ahead of what we have now.''
   The plan becomes effective in September for students entering
kindergarten through grade 6, and the following September for other
students.
   The original busing order was prompted by a lawsuit filed by
black parents. Garrity had found that the School Committee was
operating an unconstitutional, segregated system, with black
students often going to inferior schools.

   Iran's parliament voted today to sever
ties with Britain in a week unless London ends its diplomatic
embargo and denounces Salman Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses,''
Iran's official news agency said.
   Britain last week recalled its diplomats from Tehran to protest
Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's order that Moslems seek
out and kill the British author because of his novel, which many
Moslems consider blasphemous.
   Britain also asked Iran's charge d'affaires and his aide to leave
London.
   In London, British Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave
said Britain regrets the Iranian parliament's threat to sever
diplomatic relations but will not change its stance concerning
Rushdie.
   ``Clearly, the British position will not be altered by threats of
that kind,'' Waldegrave said. ``We regret the statement and hope
Iranian leaders will consider again what so many international
leaders have now said to them, that they have an obligation to
behave within international law.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of
Commons today that freedom of speech and expression are ``subject
only to the laws of this land ... and will remain subject to the
rule of law.
   ``It is absolutely fundamental to everything in which we believe
and cannot be interfered with by any outside force,'' she said.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said
``nearly all'' of the 201 deputies present in Iran's 270-member
Majlis, or parliament, voted for today's measure, standing, cheering
and praising the prophet Mohammed.
   It said they first voted to sever ties in principle, but then
included the ultimatum to Britain to revise its stance.
   The measure later was approved by the Council of Guardians, a
body of six Islamic religious leaders and six lawyers which must
sanction all laws.
   Prior to the parliament vote, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
said: ``In the future this will be our stand toward any country
which attacks Islam and Islamic sanctities,'' IRNA reported.
   Also today, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov
said Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze discussed the issue
with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and Iranian
President Ali Khamenei during Shevardnadze's visit to Tehran.
   In the first official Soviet comment on the matter, Gerasimov
said, ``the situation that has emerged about the book by Rushdie,
`the Satanic Verses,' causes the concern of the Soviet leadership.
Unless a reasonable solution is found, the implications can really
be unpredictable.''
   Gerasimov said Shevardnadze, who returned from Iran on Monday,
will raise the subject of Rushdie with other foreign ministers and
the U.S. secretary of state when they meet in Vienna on March 7.
   Fourteen Western nations besides Britain have withdrawn their top
diplomats from Iran to protest Khomeini's death decree, and Iranian
newspapers today lashed out at one of them _ West Germany.
   The daily Jomhuri Islami said Bonn should know that hurting
Moslems' feelings ``would lead to unpleasant consequences,'' IRNA
said.
   In addition to withdrawing its ambassador, West Germany says it
suspended plans to help finance Iran's efforts to rebuild after its
eight-year war with Iraq.
   The English-language Tehran Times said Bonn had been dragged by
Washington into ``a whirlpool of rash anti-Iran policies'' that
would hurt its economy, IRNA reported. West Germany is Iran's
biggest trading partner.
   Opponents of ``The Satanic Verses,'' first published in Britain
in September, have staged demonstrations worldwide, and at least 18
people have been killed in violence in India and Pakistan.
   Countries that have banned the book include Iran, Brunei,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Egypt, South Africa and
Bangladesh. Lebanon banned the book today.
   On Monday, Moslem theologians meeting in the holy city of Mecca
in Saudi Arabia branded Rushdie a ``heretic and a renegade'' but did
not endorse killing him. Islamic law condemns heretics to death, but
only after they are tried and refuse to repent.
   The 41-year-old Rushdie, who was born to a Moslem family in
India, has apologized for any distress ``The Satanic Verses'' may
have caused Moslems. Iran rejected the apology.
   Iranian clerics have put $5.2 million bounty on Rushdie's head
and he is in hiding under police guard.

   Drought poses a serious threat for California
and the next month or two could be crucial to the state's water
picture, the National Weather Service reported today.
   The snowpack in California is well below normal, posing the
potential for significant water supply problems in the state this
summer, said Dr. Michael D. Hudlow, director of hydrology for the
weather service.
   The potential for drought also exists in the Missouri Valley, in
the Boston and New York metropolitan areas and in the Delaware River
Basin, Hudlow said.
   On the other hand, saturated soils pose the danger of severe
flooding in the Ohio and Mississippi valleys, he warned.
   In addition there is a danger of snowmelt flooding in the
northernmost portions of North Dakota, Wisconsin and Minnesota, the
Upper Peninsula of Michigan and in northernmost New York and New
England, Hudlow said.
   But the spring flood and water supply report from the weather
service singled out California as the region for the greatest
concern because of the low mountain snowpack, the source of the
majority of the state's water supply.
   A continued drought in California this summer would bring the
state its third consecutive dry year, Hudlow said. That has not
occurred before in this century.
   There was some good news included in the report, however, with
the 30- and 90-day forecasts giving California a slightly above
normal chance of precipitation in the coming months.

   The Tennessee Supreme Court has outlawed
charity bingo, dealing a setback to churches, veterans organizations

   The high court Monday said that the state Constitution bars the
Legislature from authorizing lotteries and that bingo _ for charity

   Local governments may be forced to pay monetary
damages to people whose rights are violated by inadequately trained
public employees, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously today.
   Ruling in a case from Canton, Ohio, the justices said cities and
towns may be held legally accountable if the inadequate training
stemmed from governmental ``deliberate indifference.''
   In an opinion by Justice Byron R. White, the court said the
inadequate training also must be closely related to the ultimate
injury suffered before local governments can be forced to pay
damages.
   The ruling, although a potential threat to municipal treasuries
nationwide, might not result in numerous successful lawsuits.
   White said the court was imposing a stringent standard for those
filing such suits because any lesser standard would open local
governments to ``unprecedented liability'' and saddle federal courts
with ``an endless exercise of second-guessing municipal
employee-training programs.''
   Past Supreme Court decisions had made clear that a much-used
federal civil rights law could not be used to sue a local government
every time one of its employees violated someone's rights. The court
previously had ruled that the local government is not liable unless
the injury stemmed from some unconstitutional official policy.
   But in today's ruling, the court for the first time ruled that a
local government's valid official policy can be challenged
successfully in court _ if the policy is subverted by inadequate
training.
   The decision is a setback, but not a final defeat, for Canton
officials who sought to kill a lawsuit by a woman who says police
violated her rights by failing to get needed medical attention for
her after she was arrested for speeding.
   Geraldine Harris sued Canton over an April 26, 1978, incident in
which she was stopped for speeding while driving her teen-age
daughter to school.
   Police said they placed Mrs. Harris into a patrol wagon after the
52-year-old woman became uncontrollably upset and uncooperative.
When she arrived at the police station, Mrs. Harris was lying on the
wagon's floor.
   She repeatedly slumped to the stationhouse floor during a stay of
30 or 40 minutes but police officers did not call for medical help,
saying they believed Mrs. Harris was merely excited and would calm
down if left alone and permitted to see her family.
   When family members arrived, they arranged to have Mrs. Harris
taken by ambulance to a hospital. There she was diagnosed as
suffering from stress reaction, anxiety and depression.
   She was hospitalized for a week, and received subsequent
outpatient treatment for the next year.
   The Harris family sued the city in federal court, and a jury
awarded Mrs. Harris $200,000 after deciding that she unreasonably
had been denied medical attention by police.
   The presiding judge told jurors that the city could be held
liable even if the official city policy was to seek medical
attention for those persons in custody who require it.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, although ordering a new
trial in Mrs. Harris' case, ruled that Canton could be liable for
monetary damages because its police officers were not trained
adequately to summon medical help in such cases.
   Today's ruling returned Mrs. Harris' case to the 6th Circuit
court, which can now order a new trial or dismiss the suit.
   A second vote, to send the case back to the appeals court, was
6-3. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M.
Kennedy said Mrs. Harris' suit should be dismissed.
   Applying the ``deliberate indifference'' test, O'Connor wrote for
the three, ``There is no evidence in the record indicating that the
city of Canton has been deliberately indifferent to the
constitutional rights of pretrial detainees.''
   In the court's main opinion, White wrote, ``There are limited
circumstances in which an allegation of a failure to train can be
the basis for liability'' under federal civil rights law.
   ``Only where a municipality's failure to train its employees in a
relevant respect evidences a deliberate indifference to the rights
of its inhabitants can such a shortcoming be properly thought of as
a city policy or custom that is actionable,'' White added.
   Merely negligent conduct by government policy makers and
enforcers is not enough to hold the government accountable for
monetary damages, White said.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Said railroads and airlines may penalize strikers by giving
their jobs to employees with less seniority who stay on the job or
return to work before the strike ends.
   In a 6-3 ruling which was a victory for Trans World Airlines,
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said that such a policy ``of encouraging
pre-strike workers to remain on the job during the strike or to
abandon the strike and return to work before all vacancies were
filled'' is a legitimate ``exercise of TWA's peaceful economic
power.''
   _ Made it easier for the U.S. government to turn over tax
information to a foreign government.
   The 9-0 ruling allows Canadian officials to see financial records
of two Canadian citizens with bank accounts in Washington state.
   _ Reinstated a convicted Florida murderer's death sentence,
saying he should have been barred from mounting a successful
constitutional attack in federal courts.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court ruled that Aubrey Adams Jr., forfeited
his right to challenge his sentence in federal court on grounds he
failed to raise in state court.
   Adams was convicted of strangling an 8-year-old girl in Ocala 11
years ago.
   The city-liability case is Canton vs. Harris, 86-1088.

   ``Today'' show co-host Bryant Gumbel complained
in an in-house memo that weatherman Willard Scott's antics are in
``bad taste'' and that Gene Shalit's film reviews are often late, a
newspaper reported today.
   Almost no one associated with television's No. 1 morning news
show escaped reproach except co-anchor Jane Pauley, who is not
mentioned in the memo to Marty Ryan, executive producer of the NBC
program, New York Newsday said.
   The four-page, single-spaced memo was written last fall in
response to Ryan's request for Gumbel's opinions, according to
Newsday, which obtained the memo.
   Gumbel, 40, said that Scott ``holds the show hostage to his
assortment of whims, wishes, birthdays and bad taste,'' that
Shalit's reviews ``are often late and his interviews aren't very
good,'' and that consumer reporter David Horowitz ``is a walking
cliche.''
   Gumbel, who has a three-year, $7 million contract with NBC, also
criticized Ryan for a ``lack of guidance and a lack of willingness
to stand on folks and make sure they do what's necessary. Nice guys
may not finish last, but it's hard for them to stay in first.''
   Newsday quoted one unidentified on-camera person as saying,
``Gumbel wants as much editorial power as Tom Brokaw has on `Nightly
News.'''
   Asked by Newsday about the memo, NBC News President Michael G.
Gartner said he hadn't seen it ``and I don't want to see it,'' and
he refused to discuss it.
   ``It's a memo that was stolen and you have to question anyone's
motive in stealing it from a computer,'' Ryan said. ``Bryant and I
always have candid exchanges about the show.''

<HEAD>Mandatory Prison Terms Proposed for Criminals Who Use Guns</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 5 grafs new with official saying council needs more time
to study proposal. Picks up 5th graf pvs, The proposal comes.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia City Council needs
more time to study a proposal by Mayor Marion Barry Jr. requiring
five-year prison terms for criminals who use guns to commit crimes,
the council president said today.
   However, Council President David Clarke left open the possibility
that the legislation could be passed as early as Wednesday in a
special session.
   Barry's proposal would toughen the city's current misdemeanor gun
law. It includes a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $1,000
fine for those caught with unregistered weapons. Barry wants the
city to pass the legislation on an emergency basis.
   ``We're not going to let these gun-carrying thugs, dope dealers,
scourge of the earth...feel that because we have some difficulties
in our jail population, that there's no room,'' Barry told a
citizens group Monday night. ``We will find room _ find places for
them to stay in jail.''
   At a news conference earlier, Barry said the city is starting
``an all-out assault on weapons.''
   The proposal comes as the city struggles to slow the pace of
drug-related killings in Washington. Police blame about 60 percent
of last year's record 372 killings on drugs. So far in 1989, 90
people have been killed in the district, 36 more than at the same
time last year.
   The city's prison system is operating under court orders
requiring a reduction in overcrowding. Inmates have been sent to
several states to help alleviate the overcrowding.
   Barry's bill also proposes redefining the city's bail laws so
that those caught carrying an unregistered weapon, selling drugs or
using a weapon in an assault could be denied pre-trial release.
   Barry also wants to create a ``drug-free zone'' covering areas
1,000 feet or less from city schools. Under that bill, those caught
using or selling drugs in those areas would face an additional
three-year jail term.

   A third witness pointed today to Fawaz Younis
and identified him as the sky pirate who led a June 1985 hijacking
in Lebanon.
   His testimony came a day after federal prosecutors showed a
videotape of Younis reading a statement at the foot of the
aircraft's stairs before an explosion rocked the jetliner.
   Mouin Ajam, 24, a Lebanese passenger aboard the plane, pointed to
Younis across the courtroom and said he was``100 percent sure'' that
the defendant was the man who led a team of five heavily armed men
aboard Royal Jordanian Airline flight 402 as it loaded passengers
bound for Amman.
   Landry T. Slade, a vice president of the American University of
Beirut, and his son William testified Monday that the other
hijackers called Younis ``Nazeeh'' and treated him as their leader.
   While four of the men overwhelmed and bound Jordanian sky
marshals, Younis went to the cockpit, where he remained for most of
the 30-hour incident, all three witnesses testified.
   The other four hijackers stayed in the passenger compartment and
spent much of their time beating the five security guards, despite
Younis' instructions that they stop, the Slades said.
   Ajam testified that one of the hijackers, not Younis, pointed to
one of the bound marshals and asked one of the female passengers
``which one do you want us to kill first?''
   ``Do you want us to kill the one with the red shirt first?,''
Ajam said the hijacker asked the female passenger.
   ``She said, `No. Don't kill anybody,''' testified Ajam, who was
sitting one seat in front of the woman.
   The hijacker, apparently ``showing off,'' also told the young
woman that ``We've hijacked three airplanes. This is our third. We
always go into Palestinian camps and plant bombs. I've been in a lot
of fighting. I've killed lots of people,'' Ajam said.
   Federal marshals, acting under orders from U.S. District Judge
Aubrey E. Robinson Jr., asked media artists not to sketch Ajam,
apparently in order to protect him from possible reprisal.
   William L. Slade, now 22, said the hijackers, members of the
Lebanon's Amal militia, a Shiite Moslem group, hung pictures of Amal
leader Nabih Berri and Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on
one of the aircraft walls.
   William Slade testifed that the hijackers pushed the sky marshals
down in the main aisle, beat them, kicked them, dropped bayonets on
their backs and burned them with cigarettes.
   Younis came out of the cockpit several times, ordered the other
hijackers to stop abusing the marshals, and returned to the front,
at which point the beatings resumed, both Slades testified.
   Younis, 30, has pleaded innocent to a six-count indictment.
   The trial in U.S. District Court is a test of a 1984 law in which
the United States asserts ``long-arm'' jurisdiction over cases
involving Americans taken hostage overseas. Slade and his son were
the only two Americans among the approximately 70 passengers and
crew members.
   More than two years after the hijacking, on Sept. 13, 1987,
Younis was lured to a yacht in international waters off the coast of
Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea with the promise of a narcotics deal
and a party, according to evidence presented before the trial.
   Defense lawyer Francis D. Carter said in his opening argument to
the jury that Younis had given FBI agents a confession while he was
seasick and suffering, without medical attention, after the agents
had broken both his wrists.
   A federal appeals court has ruled that the confession may be used
as evidence, but Carter told jurors: ``You will have to determine
whether the statement that my client gave to the FBI was voluntary
or involuntary.''
   Carter argued that during the hijacking his client was acting
under orders from Amal, and that the incident involved a political
dispute among Arabs and was not aimed at the United States.
   ``No passenger received so much of an injury that could be
covered by a Band-Aid,'' he said.
   The hijackers tried to fly the plane to Tunis to read a statement
complaining about Palestinians in Lebanon, but Tunisian authorities
denied it permission to land and the aircraft returned to Beirut,
where the hostages eventually were released.
   Slade testified that as he and his son were led off the plane,
they saw two hijackers planting explosives.
   ``They were putting hand grenades into the seats,'' said Slade.
   Younis was standing at the foot of the aircraft stairs, shaking
hands with the passengers as they left and headed toward an airport
bus.
   Asked why he shook hands with Younis, William Slade said:
   ``I shook his hand because I was afraid that if I had not shaken
his hand, he might have taken offense and done something bad to me.''
   The prosecution produced as evidence a videotape of the last
minutes of the hijacking, in which Younis was standing at the foot
of the aircraft stairs reading a statement in Arabic.
   The videotape later showed an explosion at the front of the
jetliner.

<HEAD>Court Reinstates Convicted Florida Murderer's Death Sentence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today reinstated a convicted
Florida murderer's death sentence, saying he should have been barred
from mounting a successful constitutional attack in federal courts.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court ruled that Aubrey Adams Jr. forfeited
the right to challenge his sentence in federal court on an issue he
had failed to raise in state appellate courts.
   Adams was convicted of strangling 8-year-old Trisa Gail Thornley
in Ocala 11 years ago.
   His conviction and death sentence were upheld three times by the
Florida Supreme Court before being overturned by a federal appeals
court.
   Adams sought federal court review of his case in early 1986,
arguing for the first time that the trial judge's instructions
misled jurors about their role in determining what punishment Adams
should receive.
   Under Florida law, a jury recommends life or death for convicted
murderers in capital cases. The presiding judge is free to follow or
disregard the recommendation.
   The judge in Adams' case told jurors about that aspect of the
state's capital-sentencing law, adding, ``The final decision as to
what punishment shall be imposed rests solely upon the judge of this
court.''
   Adams argued successfully before the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals that the judge's instructions ran afoul of a 1985 Supreme
Court decision in which the justices said a death sentence is
invalid if a jury is misled about its role in determining whether
the defendant actuall will die.
   In the 1985 decision, the justices reversed a Mississippi
murderer's death sentence because a prosecutor told jurors their
decision would be reviewed automatically by an appeals court.
   Writing for the court today, Justice Byron R. White said the 11th
Circuit court never should have reached the merits of Adams' appeal.
   White said Adams' failure to raise the jury-instruction issue in
his state court appeals precluded him from raising it in a so-called
habeas corpus appeal in federal court.
   ``The ground for challenging the trial judge's instructions _
that they were objectionable under state law _ was a necessary
element of the subsequently available claim'' arising from the 1985
decision in the Mississippi case, White said.
   His opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall
and John Paul Stevens dissented.
   The case is Dugger vs. Adams, 87-121.

   Adolph Hitler Clark, a teen-ager who
said he turned to crime because of his name, has been sentenced to
10 years in prison for a drug murder.
   Clark, 18, whose birth certificate shows his middle name is
actually Hilbert, is trying to change his ways that made him
familiar to law enforcement officials since 1980, defense attorney
Bill White said at sentencing Monday.
   Clark pleaded guilty to murder in November. He being one of two
men who shot Terry Lamar Combs, 35, on Aug. 2 as he negotiated to
buy crack.
   The gunman, Anthony Michael Cobb, 18, pleaded guilty on Friday
and received 15 years in prison.
   In 1987, Clark told The Florida Times-Union that when he learned
about Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, ``I decided people expected me to
live up to his name.''
   He began skipping school and advanced to theft, which landed him
in prison when he was 16.
   Clark's father, Theodore Clark, said he gave his son the name
Hitler because it was famous. Although family, friends and police
have always known him as ``Adolph Hitler Clark,'' his birth
certificate shows a middle name of Hilbert.
   White, who recently found the birth certificate, said nurses or
hospital officials probably changed the birth certificate.

   The Supreme Court today made it easier for the
U.S. government to turn over tax information and financial records
to a foreign government.
   The 9-0 ruling allows Canadian officials to see financial records
of two Canadian citizens with bank accounts in Washington state.
   The Supreme Court said a federal law aimed at protecting
potential criminal defendants who also are being investigated by the
Internal Revenue Service does not apply to tax probes by foreign
governments.
   The Canadian Department of National Revenue, that nation's
equivalent of the IRS, sought records of Philip Stuart and Mons
Kapoor.
   Both Canadian citizens have accounts with the Northwestern
Commercial Bank in Bellingham, Wash.
   The Canadian officials said they are investigating the tax
liability of the two men for 1980, 1981 and 1982.
   The officials sought the help of the U.S. government under a 1942
treaty between the two nations. The IRS issued summonses to the bank
in 1984.
   Stuart and Kapoor then asked a U.S. federal judge to block the
summonses. The judge declined, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled in their favor in 1987.
   The appeals court said the bank records must be withheld unless
U.S. officials state that the Canadian tax investigation has not
reached a stage analogous to one in this country in which the IRS
would refer the case to the Justice Department for criminal
prosecution.
   U.S. government officials said the ruling could hinder U.S.
treaty obligations and impair the ability of U.S. investigators to
obtain foreign financial records.
   The Justice Department said tax treaties with 31 foreign
governments and also exchanges of information under other agreements
with Caribbean Basin nations would be affected.
   The Supreme Court today said the federal law barring an IRS
summons when a tax investigation has been referred to the Justice
Department does not apply to foreign tax probes.
   Justice William J. Brennan, writing for the court, said the law
is intended to safeguard rights of the accused by retaining the
grand jury as a principal tool of criminal prosecution. The law also
is aimed at assuring that criminal defendants will not be forced
before trial to divulge information to prosecutors in violation of
their rights.
   But Brennan said those safeguards are not relevant when the
investigation takes place in a foreign country.
   ``None of the countries with whom the United States has tax
treaties providing for exchanges of information employ grand juries,
and Canada has ceased to use them,'' Brennan said.
   Also, he said, the procedures in foreign countries requiring
targets of investigations to reveal information are considerably
different than in the United States.
   ``The concerns that prompted Congress to pass (the law protecting
suspects' rights) are therefore not present when the IRS issues
summonses at the request of most foreign governments conducting
investigations into possible violations of their own tax laws,''
Brennan said.
   ``So long as the summons meets statutory requirements and is
issued in good faith ... compliance is required, whether or not the
Canadian tax investigation is directed toward criminal prosecution
under Canadian law,'' he said.
   The case is U.S. vs. Stuart, 87-1064.

<HEAD>Rebels Say They Will Take Part In Peace Talks</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with rebel response to Duarte's proposal,
fighting continuing; EDITS througout to tighten. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels said today they
would participate in peace talks with the government, but that the
negotiations must be in San Salvador ``in full view of the people.''
   They also said the agenda must be broader than the one proposed
Sunday night President Jose Napoleon Duarte.
   Salvador Samayoa, a rebel chief now in Mexico, read the
guerrillas' response during a broadcast on radio YSU in San Salvador.
   Duarte proposed that peace talks begin today in Guatemala and
coincide with a three-month cease-fire. He also proposed that the
March 19 presidential election be postponed until April 30.
   The leader of the rightist party that controls the legislature
rejected the proposals Monday.
   The communique by the guerrilla group _ the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front _ said the talks should be begin March 4
at the headquarters of the Roman Catholic archdiocese in San
Salvador.
   If both sides agreed to a cease-fire, the talks should ``be held
among and in full view of the people,'' the communique read by
Samayoa said.
   It also said the rebels rejected Duarte's election date of April
30 and that his government must state beforehand that it would
discuss postponing the balloting until September.
   The rebels said negotiations must include their demand that the
government's armed forces be reduced from 56,000 men to the 12,000
level of a decade ago, before the civil war began. Another issue
that must be addressed is prosecution of military officers
implicated in gross human rights violations, they said.
   The insurgents gave Duarte 48 hours to respond.
   On Monday, Ricardo Alvarenga, a leader of the Republican
Nationalist Alliance and president of the Legislative Assembly, told
a news conference that ``the election date is set, and it must be
fulfilled. It is not by altering the constitutional order that
problems are resolved.''
   The rightist alliance, known as Arena, controls the unicameral
assembly and is favored to win the presidency from Duarte's
Christian Democrats. It has adamantly rejected any postponement of
the vote.
   Washington hailed Duarte's proposal as presenting the most
significant opportunity ever for peace in El Salvador. The United
States has been backing the government in a 9-year-old civil war
that has claimed more than 70,000 lives.
   Meanwhile, the rebels continued their attacks.
   The Armed Forces press office said today that a rebel attack on
the 6th Infantry Brigade headquarters in Usulutan province, 68 miles
east of the capital, wounded three soldiers and a civilian.
   In the town of Berlin, 70 miles east of San Salvador in Usulutan,
two police officers and four civilians were injured when police
tried to deactivate an explosive device.
   The military also said that three rebels died attacking a
military position at Nueva Concepcion, 42 miles northeast of the
capital in Chalatenango province. Rebel radio said 28 soldiers were
killed or wounded but the military denied the claim.
   The rebels said last month that they would participate in the
election and respect its outcome if the vote were postponed at least
four months. That was seen as a major turnabout by the Marxist-led
rebels, who have condemned the five previous national elections this
decade as shams.
   Duarte suggested Sunday that constitutional problems with
delaying the election could be resolved either through an accord
involving the three branches of government or by a plebiscite.
   He had originally rejected the guerrilla proposal, saying
postponement of the election past March 31 would be unconstitutional.
   He did not explain Sunday why April 30 could be considered a
legal date. The constitution says elections must be held at least
two months before the end of the incumbent's term.
   Duarte's term expires June 1. The 63-year-old president, who is
suffering from terminal liver cancer, is expected to survive until
then.
   Alvarenga noted that the legislature must analyze Duarte's
plebiscite proposal but said he opposed it.
   ``Why have a plebiscite? The presidential election is a
plebiscite, a consultation of the popular will, and it must be
carried out as scheduled,'' he said.

   A derailed train that exploded and burned
jumped the tracks again today while authorities were moving it,
forcing another evacuation just hours after 2,000 people were
allowed back in their homes.
   One tanker, which carried butane, derailed in the center of town
as officials were moving the train ``at walking speed'' to Canton,
where the cargo was to be put on undamaged cars, CSX Transportation
spokesman Lloyd Lewis said.
   The tanker punctured, but there was no fire. Eleven homes and
three businesses were evacuated, officials said. The number of
people evacuated was not immediately known. City buses stood by to
carry evacuees.
   The tanker car had 20,000 to 25,000 gallons of butane, but none
spilled, Lewis said.
   About 2,000 people had returned to their homes early today,
ending a two-day evacuation.
   A crew from CSX Transportation, which operated the train, had
righted seven tanker cars and were moving them when the second
derailment occurred.
   An eighth car continued to burn, but Fire Chief George Romanski
said it had exhausted most of its fuel and no longer posed a serious
danger. A ninth car was also left at the scene.
   The burning car was within yards of a B.F. Goodrich Chemical
Plant that houses butadiene, a petroleum derivative that can produce
hazardous smoke if it burns. Smoke from the burning train posed no
environmental threat, Mayor Don Plusquellic said.
   The regional bus system, which had been unable to operate Monday
because the bus garage is near the derailed train, was back in
service early today. That meant schools, which had been closed
Monday, could reopen.
   Homes and businesses within a half mile of the accident were
evacuated about an hour after the train derailed on the Goodrich
grounds Sunday night. The train was on a Willard, Ohio-to-Akron run
and was not scheduled to stop at Goodrich, CSX officials said.
   Twenty-one cars of the 45-car train derailed, but only two caught
fire, and one of those was extinguished quickly.
   No one was seriously injured. More than a dozen people were
treated at area hospitals, many of them complaining of sore throats
and nausea from the smoke, officials said.
   Most evacuees had found shelter with friends and relatives by
Monday. About 350 spent the night at Kenmore High School, where the
Red Cross provided cots, blankets, food and other needs.
   ``I'm used to the comforts of home. I don't like this at all,''
said Bill Lewis, 25, who spent both nights at the high school with
his wife and three children. ``I didn't think it was going to be an
all-night affair. ''
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, flew from Washington to Akron to
discuss the accident with city officials on Monday. He said
railroads should be prohibited from carrying hazardous materials
through populated areas or near chemical plants.
   ``It just doesn't make good sense,'' Metzenbaum said.
   Gov. Richard Celeste also said national legislation may be needed
to deal with the problem.
   The U.S. District Court in Columbus ruled last year that
railroads are not subject to a 1988 state law regulating the
shipment of hazardous materials.

   President Bush plunged into an uphill campaign
to salvage his nomination of John Tower as defense secretary today
with a series of private meetings intended to sway senators to vote
for confirmation.
   But the nomination suffered another setback when Republican Sen.
Larry Pressler of South Dakota announced he was ``very much leaning
against'' confirmation and urged Tower to withdraw before a vote.
   ``I think that he may very well be doing him (Bush) a favor in
this case,'' said Pressler, who said he was fearful that Tower would
not be capable of cleaning up the Pentagon procurement system if
confirmed.
   Pressler's comments were the most public indication to date that
Republican support for Tower _ and the president _ might not be firm
in the Senate.
   With Democrats holding a 55-45 majority in the Senate,
Republicans can ill-afford any defections from their own ranks if
Bush is to prevail in the first high-stakes political showdown of
his 5-week-old presidency.
   Vice President Dan Quayle entered the fray, telling reporters at
a hastily called news conference at the entrance to the Senate
subway that the White House is engaged in an all out drive to
``remove obstacles to the confirmation of John Tower.''
   He said he believes Tower himself already has removed a serious
obstacle through his pledge of abstinence.
   Quayle said he believes that when the vote is taken all 45
Republican senators, including Pressler, will vote for Tower.
   ``We are still searching for five Democrats and I'll make the
51st vote in favor of John Tower,'' said Quayle, whose role as
Senate president empowers him to cast tie-breaking votes.
   ``We'll take the votes anyway we can get them,'' he said, adding
that senators should not vote against Tower simply because he may
have ``stepped on a lot of toes'' during his service as a ``direct,
tough, competitive chairman'' of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Bush invited several Democrats to the White House for a series of
one-on-one meetings today to discuss the nomination.
   The first guest, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
did not talk with reporters as he left the White House but said
later he would announce his own position by day's end.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., said last Thursday he expected Mitchell
would oppose the nomination, which has failed thus far to attract
the public support of any Democratic senator.
   With the full Senate prepared to take up the nomination this
week, Bush rejoined the battle Monday night after returning to the
capital from the Far East. He told reporters on Air Force One: ``I
haven't wavered one iota and I don't intend to.''
   Democrats have been largely unimpressed with Tower's pledge to
swear off alcohol if he is confirmed, saying they are concerned with
the issue of his judgment in general and his past links with
military contractors. Bush wants to change their minds.
   In addition to Mitchell, Bush had individual meetings scheduled
with Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the ranking GOP member of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, and at least five Democrats whose votes
will be crucial if the former Texas senator is to be confirmed. They
are Sens. Charles Robb, D-Va.; Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas; Bennett
Johnston, D-La., Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Bill Bradley, D-N.J.
   ``We're going to work real hard,'' said White House Press
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``We're going to talk to a lot of people
and ask them to keep an open mind and to read the FBI report and to
talk to John Tower.''
   When Bush was asked whether Tower's no-drinking pledge would
help, he shrugged his shoulders and said, ``I don't know.'' Asked if
Tower's cause will prvail, he replied: ``Time will tell. I don't
have any predictions.''
   Following a White House meeting Monday night, Senate Republican
leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said there was no talk of pulling the plug
on Tower's nomination. ``There wasn't any plug mentioned,'' he said.
   Senators are using the time before formal debate opens on
Wednesday to troop into a guarded Capitol hearing room to read a
confidential FBI report on the former Texas senator's drinking
habits, alleged ``womanizing'' and the extensive and lucrative links
he forged to military contractors after retiring from the Senate
four years ago.
   Pressler, interviewed today on ``CBS This Morning,'' said, ``I've
said I'm leaning very much against him and probably will vote
against him... It's based on a strong feeling that John Tower is
very much a part of the problem. He comes out of the very group
that, that in my view has made the contractor problem over there.''
   However, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., told CBS he leaned toward
supporting Tower, adding: ``It is not a Supreme Court appointment.
Tower would serve at the pleasure of the president. He could fire
him at any time. If John Tower were to drink, become inebriated,
under current circumstances it would be known everywhere in the
world virtually instantaneously.''
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., considered by some a swing vote, said on
NBC's ``Today''' show the problem was ``a pattern of bad judgment,
bad judgment including drinking in the 1970s, placing himself in a
compromising position in Geneva in the mid-1980s and his association
with the defense industry in the late 1980s.
   ``That pattern raises a question as to whether this man is fit to
be secretary of defense,'' Graham said. ``I spent two hours last
night studying the FBI files and I have to say, the more I know
about John Tower and his background the less I am inclined to
believe that he should be secretary of defense.''
   ``There is something of greater significance than Tower's
pledge,'' said Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich. ``Sen. Tower made
representations in the Armed Services Committee of not using alcohol
in certain time periods _ and that turned out not to be true.''
   ``The fact he needed to make that pledge was a double-edged
sword,'' said Exon of Nebraska, who said that as recently as two
weeks ago the White House and Tower did not acknowledge Tower ever
had a drinking problem.
   ``Yet on Sunday, in a move to allay fears, John made that
pledge,'' Exon said. ``It seems to me it might be interpreted as
meaning he wants this job too badly.''
   ``It's like marrying someone who says, `Trust me, I'll reform,'''
said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill. ``The experience with people who have
problems with drink is that these pledges get broken much too
easily.''
   But many Republicans said Tower's high-visibility promise before
a television audience of millions would not be broken.
   ``John Tower's a man of his word,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
``If he says he won't drink, he won't drink.''
   ``We have to accept it totally,'' said Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.
``He is an honorable man. I've never seen John Tower break a
promise.''
   But would Tower's pledge change any votes?
   ``It may be it won't affect any,'' said Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss.
``It may be it will affect one. It may be that one will be the
difference.''
   The Democratic-controlled Senate Armed Services Committee voted
11-9 along party lines last Thursday to recommend the full Senate
reject the nomination.

<HEAD>Art Institute School Closes Show After Threats Over Flag Exhibit</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto upcoming</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citing threats of violence, the School of the Art
Institute of Chicago has indefinitely closed an exhibit featuring an
American flag on the floor.
   School officials met on Monday with representatives of veterans
groups, who requested that the show not reopen unless the flag is
off the floor. But no accord was reached, said Gene Connell, one of
the veterans at the meeting.
   Felice Dublon, the school's director of student affairs, said
Monday the show will remain closed as long as there are concerns
about the safety of students.
   ``There were various threats made, including threats of physical
violence to students. It was simply a matter of security,'' Tony
Jones, president the school, said through a spokeswoman.
   The exhibit was part of a show that displayed works by 66
minority artists.
   Last year, during an exhibit of student art at the school, black
aldermen stormed in to take down a portrait of the late Harold
Washington, the city's first black mayor, who was depicted in
lingerie.
   Dred Scott Tyler, the student artist whose work challenges the
reverence accorded the U.S. flag, said the controversy reinforces
his claim that the flag means different things to different people.
   As Tyler appeared outside the school Monday to read a statement,
about 60 students shouted, ``First Amendment!'' and ``Freedom of
Speech!''
   Tyler, wearing dark sunglasses and a black beret, said his work
``represents the hope and aspirations of many oppressed minorities
both here and internationally.''
   Tyler cited the flags worn on cavalry uniforms during the
suppression of American Indians and the flag on the atomic bomb
dropped on Hiroshima.
   About 60 veterans, many carrying small American flags, also
gathered outside the school to protest the exhibit. The veterans,
some of whom had lost limbs, labeled the artist's work a
desecration, unpatriotic and illegal.
   The School of the Art Institute says it was advised by police
that the exhibit is legal, although trampling or otherwise
desecrating the flag is a crime.
   In the exhibit, titled ``What is the Proper Way to Display the
American Flag?'' the flag lies on the floor beneath a montage that
includes photographs of flag-draped coffins and a picture of South
Koreans burning the U.S. flag.
   Visitors are invited to comment in a ledger on a shelf. The
veterans complain that most people will step on the flag to do so.
   Asked about the outcry from veterans, Tyler said, ``I feel
basically they're trying to enforce patriotism in this country. ...
I think that is outrageous.''
   Amvets state coordinator Robert Heppinger disagreed.
   ``All we ask is a little respect for our banner that led us in
the war to maintain the freedoms that these people are taking
advantage of,'' Heppinger said. ``The flag should be respected at
all times.''

<HEAD>Priest Finds Bounty Offer On Guns Backfires</HEAD>

   A priest who offered $100 for every handgun turned
in at his church has been stung by a political gadfly who exchanged
a cheap pistol to help pay for an assault rifle.
   The Rev. Marshall Gourley said 14 guns had been surrendered at
Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church as of late Monday in response
to the offer announced during Mass on Sunday.
   Robin Heid, a 35-year-old private investigator and free-lance
writer, exchanged a 5-year-old gun, then went before a waiting TV
crew to say he would use the $100 as a down payment on an AR-15, the
civilian version of an M-16 assault rifle.
   ``This is a capitalist country _ when you have a chance to make a
good deal, you make it,'' Heid said.
   He said the .22-caliber revolver he exchanged was worth no more
than $40.
   The priest, who presided over the funerals of two gunshot victims
in the past month, called the move a betrayal of his effort to
remove as many guns as possible from the streets of Denver. ``I'm
disappointed in him,'' he said.
   The bounty came from a $2,000 donation from a parishioner who
requested that the cash be used for something worthwhile other than
church repairs or the annual budget, Gourley said.

<HEAD>Survey Says They're Often Rubber Stamps for Superintendent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   School boards often are rubber stamps for
district superintendents instead of reflecting the communities they
are supposed to represent, concludes a first-time survey of board
presidents released Tuesday.
   The findings, based on questionnaires completed by 1,217 school
board presidents, show large gaps between the board presidents and
the public on issues ranging from school ratings and problems to sex
education and parental choice.
   Fully 81 percent of the board presidents said they were greatly
influenced by their superintendent, compared to 4 percent who
reported being greatly influenced by the PTA and 3 percent by
individual parents. The longer they are board members, the more
resistant they are to change, the survey found.
   ``The study shows that people come in energetic and interested in
reform ... but very quickly they are discouraged or it's just easier
to go along with the ride,'' said Emily Feistritzer, an education
analyst and director of the private National Center for Education
Information.
   The widest opinion gap came in the area of public school choice,
a concept championed by President Bush and supported by 71 percent
of the public in a 1987 Gallup poll. But only 36 percent of the
school board presidents said parents should have the right to select
which local school their child attends; 51 percent were opposed.
   Other areas of difference with the public:
   _A 1988 Gallup poll found the public considered drug use and lack
of discipline the two most serious problems faced by schools. School
board presidents overwhelmingly cited lack of proper financial
support as their schools' biggest problem.
   _Eighty percent of the school board presidents favored sex
education in grades 4-8. But only 55 percent of the public felt that
way in a spring 1987 Gallup poll.
   _Forty percent of the public graded their local schools A or B in
a Gallup poll last year. A full 79 percent of school board
presidents gave their own schools an A or B, even while agreeing
with the public that, nationally, schools aren't doing too well.
   The board presidents did reflect prevailing public views in their
strong support for paying teachers on the basis of performance and
requiring them to pass competency tests before they can teach.
   Asked what would improve education, 84 percent said requiring
students to perform at grade level to attain promotions. The next
most popular suggestion, winning 75 percent, was recruiting teachers
from other career fields.
   Two-thirds of the board presidents also favored giving individual
schools greater flexibility in determining what and how students are
taught and in deciding how the school will operate. Only one-third,
however, said teachers should have greater authority in running
schools.
   The survey found that 97 percent of school board presidents are
white, 71 percent are male, and 68 percent have never worked in an
education system. Nearly half are in their 40s, 94 percent are
married, and almost two-thirds have children at home. The presidents
are better educated, make more money and are more conservative
politically than the average American.
   There are 40 million students enrolled in public schools in more
than 15,000 school districts across the country. Responses to the
Feistritzer survey were weighted to reflect all districts and the
results had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.

   A court has convicted four men, including
two army officers, of plotting to assassinate President Matthieu
Kerekou, and sentenced to prison terms ranging from five to 20 years.
   Prosecutors in the trial, which ended Monday night, had demanded
the maximum penalty of life imprisonment for all four.
   Witnesses at the trial said the former Libyan ambassador, Mostafa
Aboucetta, had inspired the June 1988 plot. Aboucetta hurriedly left
Benin shortly after the four were arrested.
   Capt. Amadou Abdouramane and Ahmed Kadi Youba, a Mauritanian
Moslem holy man, were given 20-year sentences. The prosecution
described them as the ringleaders.
   Capt. Fousseini Gomina was sentenced to 10 years in prison and
Hama Bio Soumailia was sentenced to five years in prison. A fifth
conspirator is still at large.

   Leftist inmates ended a 19-day-hunger

a human rights group said.
   The 207 inmates, held in a high-security prison in Eskisehir, a
central city, began the strike to gain permission for more frequent
visits by their relatives and access to various publications,
including books and newspapers.
   Fevzi Argun, of the independent Turkish Human Rights
Organization, said the inmates ended the hunger strike when their
requests were granted. Relatives will be allowed to visit inmates
once a week, a change from once every other week, he said.
   Argun said at least two inmates were hospitalized during the
hunger strike.
   Eight people, including the wives and parents of inmates, also
held a hunger strike for one week at the headquarters of the Human
Rights Organization in the capital city of Ankara in support of the
prisoners. They also ended their hunger strike Tuesday, Argun said.

   Mayors of 24 towns along the Adige River on
Tuesday renewed warnings not to drink tap water because local
supplies have been contaminated by toxic chemicals.
   An estimated 150,000 people in the Rovigo area, 35 miles
southwest of Venice, have been without potable tap water since
Sunday. Residents have had to stand in long lines at mobile water
tanks set up by the army and municipal authorities to get water for
drinking and cooking.
   Italian newspapers reported the aqueduct that supplies drinking
water for the area has been contaminated by heavy metals and toxic
chemicals discharged by factories into the Adige, Italy's
second-longest river.
   Some cities, including Chioggia, on the Venetian lagoon, and
Cavarzere, have had their tap water turned off since Feb. 22.
   Local and regional councils have declared a state of emergency
and have asked that all toxic discharges into the Adige be stopped
immediately.

<TEXT>
   A New York newspaper office and two California bookstores were
firebombed early today in attacks possibly related to Moslem anger
over the novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' officials said.
   ``I can't imagine any other reason why people would be lobbing
bombs through bookstores,'' said bookstore owner Andy Ross as he
helped clean up the damage at his Cody's Books in Berkeley, Calif.
   Both Cody's, a Berkeley landmark near the University of
California campus, and a branch of the Waldenbooks chain a block
away were damaged when bottles filled with a flammable liquid were
tossed through windows, their owners said.
   The blaze at the Riverdale Press in the Bronx section of New York
City heavily damaged the building, authorities said. No one was
inside at the time.
   Witnesses said a station wagon drove by the offices about 4:40
a.m. and someone in the car tossed an incendiary device through a
window, police said. The firebombing may have been in retaliation
for an editorial the weekly paper ran last week supporting the right
to read Salman Rushdie's novel, said firefighter Tom McTigue.
   The novel has sparked violent protests among Moslems who consider
it blasphemous. Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered a death
sentence for Rushdie and his publisher.
   ``My guess is that it had something to do with something that was
printed in the paper,'' Riverdale Press co-publisher Richard Stein
said. ``But I don't know what.''
   McTigue and Stein stressed that no motive had been established
and that there was no definite link to ``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``I honestly feel it is nothing but speculation,'' Stein said.
``We have not received any telephone or written threats. No one has
taken credit for this.''
   Stein said the 39-year-old community newspaper, which has a paid
circulation of 14,000, would print its Wednesday edition despite the
damage.
   He said the paper, which was a Pulitzer Prize finalist last year
for the second time, is known for its activism and outspoken
editorial page, but he said he could not recall anything recently
that could be considered of ``incendiary import.''
   In an editorial last week, the newspaper criticized bookstores
that removed ``The Satanic Verses'' from display, he said.
   ``I cannot imagine why our paper would be singled out among the
thousands of newspapers around the country'' that published similar
thoughts, he said.
   In Berkeley, Waldenbooks manager Bob Gammon wasn't ready to blame
the firebombing on the furor over Rushdie's book.
   ``We've had no threats, no one claiming to have done it,' Gammon
said. ``So there's no evidence that it was due to `Satanic Verses.'
''
   Gammon and Ross said they had been told by police that the fires
resulted from a kerosene-type firebomb. Police would not confirm the
report but said arson investigators were sent.
   ``We had a broken window and a carpet caught fire,'' Gammon said.
   Ross estimated damage at less than $1,000. Ross had put out a
flyer Wednesday denouncing ``the intellectual terrorism that is
being directed against Mr. Rushdie.''
   Both men said their stores had sold all copies of the novel.
Waldenbooks, one of the nation's largest bookstore chains, pulled
the book off shelves for a week before announcing Friday that
managers could display it at their discretion.

<HEAD>More Than a Third of City Residents See Incomes Decrease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   More than one-third of China's city residents saw
their real incomes decline in 1988, a year of impressive economic
growth tempered by disturbingly high inflation and serious supply
shortages.
   The State Statistics Bureau, in an annual report announced
Tuesday, said per capita income in urban areas was $302, up only 1.2
percent from 1987 after deducting price increases.
   It said the spending power of 34.9 percent of urban families
declined because their incomes failed to keep pace with inflation.
In 1987, 20 percent of urban residents reported declines in their
living standards.
   Among the hardest hit were government employees on fixed salaries
and construction workers affected by policies intended to slow down
the overheated economy, bureau spokesman Zhang Zhongji said at a
news conference.
   In rural areas, where more than three-fourths of China's 1.1
billion people live, per capita income rose 6.3 percent after
inflation to $147.
   ``It was a year of joy and worry, with many difficulties,'' Zhang
said.
   The main worry was the highest rate of inflation in communist
China's history. Retail prices in December were up 26.7 percent over
the same month in 1987. The bureau said the prices of meat, poultry
and eggs, fresh vegetables and aquatic products were all up by more
than 30 percent.
   Among basic materials, the general price index for rolled steel
was up 21 percent, copper was up 50 percent and aluminum was up 38.6
percent.
   Zhang said the gross national product rose 11.2 percent to $374
billion, and national income totaled $312 billion, an increase of
11.4 percent.
   But growth, he said, was uneven, and ``the gap widened between
social supply and social demand.''
   Industrial output value shot up 20.7 percent to $489 billion.
Among consumer goods, production of color TV sets rose by 52.8
percent, refrigerators by 84.4 percent and motor vehicles by 37.1
percent.
   Industries such as coal and steel, however, showed relatively
slow growth, and 20 percent of enterprises can't operate at full
strength because of power shortages.
   Agricultural output value grew only by 3.2 percent, and grain
production, the crucial measure of the nation's agricultural health,
declined by 9 million tons to 394 million tons.
   Zhang said grain output fell about 22 million tons short of need
and that 40 million people in rural areas are short of food. About
11 million tons was taken from reserves and another 11 million tons
imported, he said.
   Zhang also said that 14,400 investment projects had been
suspended or cancelled since the government embarked last fall on a
tough austerity program to cool down economic growth and bring
inflation under control.
   He said that represented about 10 percent of all ongoing projects.
   Zhang could not give a figure for how many jobs had been lost in
the building clampdown, but estimated that unemployment will rise
from the current 2.1 percent of urban workers to about 3 percent by
the end of 1989. He said there are now 135.7 million urban workers,
up 3.6 million from the end of 1987.
   Zhang said the austerity program has shown results, with the
retail price index going up only 1 percent in January compared to
December.
   But despite the clampdown on projects in the last quarter of the
year, overall spending in projects under construction rose 12
percent over the year to $351 billion.
   ``This was mainly because too many unimportant projects were
started, and investments outside the budget increased greatly.''
   Zhang said the problems China faces are ``more complicated and
difficult'' than in 1984 and 1985, when there was a similar
situation of too rapid growth.
   China is saddled with stagnation in grain production; four years
ago, it was coming off bumper harvests.
   Another difference, he said, is that the government has less
control over the economy because it has relinquished some authority
under market-oriented reforms. The reforms have also allowed
enterprises to keep more of their profits, and price rises have not
translated into increased revenues for the state.

   Aurelio Buarque de Holanda
Ferreira, the author of a dictionary that bore his name and became
the top-selling book in the Portuguese language, has died at the age
of 78.
   Buarque de Holanda, who suffered from respiratory problems and
Parkinson's Disease, died Monday at his home in a Rio suburb, said
Claudio Lacerda, a spokesman for the Nova Fronteira publishing house.
   He was a household name in this country of 144 million, where his
best-selling dictionary was popularly referred to as the ``Aurelio.''
   Since it was first published in 1975, the ``Aurelio'' sold more
than 6 milllion copies in Brazil and abroad. It was also published
in Portugal and the Portuguese-speaking African nations of Angola
and Mozambique, Lacerda said.
   Born in the tiny town of Passo de Camaragibe in Brazil's poor
northeastern drought zone, Buarque de Holanda studied law and later
became a writer, translator and professor of Portuguese for
Brazilian diplomats.
   In 1938, he moved to Rio de Janeiro, where he became known as a
writer of short stories. His best-known collections were the
prize-winning ``Two Worlds'' in 1942 and ``Sea of Stories'' in 1945.
   Lacerda said further editions of the popular dictionary will be
published, including a computerized version due out this year.
   Burial is planned at Rio's Sao Joao Batista cemetery.

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rioters clashed with national guard
troops and thieves looted stores in the capital today, a day after
the worst street violence in Venezuela in 30 years. Police estimated
25 people were killed in Caracas alone and more than 1,000 arrested.
   The violence, triggered by bus fare increases, began Monday and
spread to at least seven cities and towns. It continued for a second
day today in Caracas, where sirens wailed as authorities put out
fires and battled looters in streets filled with shattered glass.
   Independent reports estimated damage nationwide to be in the
millions of dollars. On some Caracas streets, virtually every store
was looted. The rioting eased in the early morning hours, then
resumed later in the day as troops moved against thieves carrying
appliances and furniture from stores.
   ``It is a popular uprising. There are riots everywhere. They are
all furious,'' said Metropolitan Police Inspector Jose Lara
Montilla, who commanded a unit armed with shotguns.
   ``All police forces are in a state of emergency ... I cannot give
you exact figures, but around 25 people have died and no one knows
how many injured,'' another police official said this morning.
   ``Hospitals can no longer cope ... people just keep coming and
coming,'' said the police official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The figures were for Caracas and outlying areas, he said, adding
that information from other parts of the country was not available
immediately.
   Army trucks full of troops patrolled some streets in Caracas this
morning, while blocks away looters continued to remove goods from
stores. ``We're waiting for orders,'' said a national guardsman,
when asked why they were taking little action.
   Perhaps the worst violence occurred Monday in Guarenas, a
shantytown about 12 miles from the capital where the disturbances
began. People there formed human chains and threw rocks at national
guard troops in armored cars after the soldiers began firing
birdshot and tear gas at looters.
   A 32-year-old pregnant woman who was not involved in the rioting
was shot to death and at least 126 people were wounded, said
journalist Igor Camacho of the Voz de Guarenas newspaper.
   Rioters in the shantytown emptied dozens of stores and
supermarkets and set at least 14 vehicles ablaze.
   Officially, bus fares were to rise only about 30 percent _ on
urban routes, for example, from the equivalent of about a nickel to
7 cents.
   But Transportation Minister Gustavo Rada said today some
increases have been as high as 50 percent, apparently because of
price gouging by bus drivers.
   The increases are part of an economic reform package announced
last week by the government of President Carlos Andres Perez.
   Weak oil prices have seriously hurt the economy of Venezuela,
which for decades has been one of South America's most stable
democracies. More than 40 percent of Venezuelans live in poverty.
   Perez appealed for calm, and said the rioting was
``unjustifiable.'' However, opposition leaders called for continued
protests against the government's economic program.
   A woman caught in the crossfire Monday as she tried to get home
complained the looters were criminals taking advantage of what
started out as a protest.
   ``They're just criminals, robbing, burning. I've never seen
anything this bad,'' she said, crying.
   Fires in poor neighborhoods in the hills on the outskirts of the
city burned through the evening.
   Residents in San Agustin del Sur took over the Francisco Fajardo
highway, the city's main artery, on Monday. They fought a battle
with police that began with rocks and tear gas and ended with
gunfire from both sides.
   Drivers panicked and abandoned their cars on the highway. Public
transportation was brought to a standstill.
   Alex Martinez, a deputy police commissioner, said Monday that all
6,000 officers on the Caracas police force were called out and that
at least 100,000 people were stranded at work. The city's population
is nearly 4 million.
   Three guardsmen were hurt by rocks thrown by students in Merida,
more than 300 miles southwest of Caracas.
   ``It's an outright battle between students and the national
guard,'' said Ramon Suarez, a reporter for the newspaper Frontera in
Merida, home to the 10,000 students of the University of the Andes.
Tanks patrolled the streets.
   Students took the state governor, Orlando Guttierez, prisoner for
about an hour Monday when he tried to talk to the rioters.
   Two weeks after Perez was inaugurated Feb. 2, he announced his
economic austerity package, which includes food and gas price
increases.
   The country's $33 billion foreign debt is the fourth-largest in
Latin America. Later this week, Venezuela is to sign a $1.5 billion
credit with the International Monetary Fund.
   The last nationwide riots occurred in 1958 when dictator Marcos
Perez Jimenez was ousted.

   The United States and Laos have agreed to
conduct an excavation in the Laotian countryside at a site where
American servicemen may have died during the Vietnam War, the
Pentagon said Tuesday.
   The site in southern Laos ``may be associated with an incident
involving one or more Americans missing in Southeast Asia,'' the
Pentagon said in a statement.
   The Pentagon, without elaboration, said the site was discovered
and initially surveyed by a joint Laotian-American team of experts
last December. Previous excavations have been mounted only when
evidence of an aircraft crash has been found.
   The excavation will begin Saturday and will take from 10 to 14
days to complete, the Pentagon said.
   It will be the fifth excavation allowed by the Laotian government
since the war ended.
   ``The United States government appreciates this further step by
the Lao government in our cooperative effort to resolve the issue of
Americans still missing or otherwise unaccounted for in Laos as a
result of the war,'' the Pentagon said.

   Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial came to a halt
again today after it was discovered that government-censored memos
by North's Contra courier, Robert Owen, had already been made public.
   North's lawyers immediately moved to dismiss the indictment
against North, saying it was impossible for the former White House
aide to get a fair trial under federal secrecy procedures.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell sent the jurors home,
saying there were ``unresolved'' problems concerning the classified
material. He scheduled an afternoon hearing on the matter.
   ``We are dealing with problems inherent in the nature in this
trial: what is classified and what isn't classified,'' said North
lawyer Brendan Sullivan. He said the matter was ``so extraordinary
and so important it affects the ongoing nature of the trial.''
   The dispute was triggered by a memo by Owen, which stated the
name of a high Costa Rican official, former security minister
Benjamin Piza. Owen's memo containing Piza's name had already been
turned over in a lawsuit to the Christic Institute, an activist
group, that has been critical of U.S. policy in Central America.
   However, when the same document was introduced at North's trial,
Piza's name had been excised by U.S. intelligence officials on
national security grounds.
   The disclosure that the name had been turned over to the
institute last summer caused Gesell to call for the hearing.
   ``We have reached a point where I have to take some testimony
relating to legal matters,'' he told the jury. ``I did not realize
this situation confronted me until I arrived at 7 o'clock this
morning.''
   Owen was North's courier to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua and
was being cross-examined by Sullivan. Owen was to appear at this
afternoon's hearing.
   North's lawyers filed a motion asking that the indictment against
North be dismissed on the ground of ``misconduct'' by the
prosecution.
   They alleged in the motion that the office of independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh had known for at least 10 days that all but one of 19
memos by Owen to North introduced in the case had previously been
turned over to the Christic Institute.
   ``Instead of disclosing this critical fact, the IC (independent
counsel) hid it, and incredibly, insisted that the court and the
defense treat these already-public documents as classified,'' the
motion said.
   Sullivan complained that the defense ``has spent days trying to
devise means of tiptoeing around information, ... that the IC knew
all along had already been released to the public.''
   ``This misconduct mandates dismissal of the indictment,'' his
motion said.
   Ten of the Owen memos were censored ``because of perceived danger
to national security.''
   Sullivan's motion outlined the circumstances under which the
defense learned after 10 p.m. Tuesday from Owen's lawyer that the
uncensored versions of the Owen memos had been given to the Christic
Institute in the suit.
   Sullivan asked for the hearing to find out exactly when
prosecutors knew about this, what efforts they made to prevent the
institute from disclosing them and ``why the fact of public
disclosure was withheld from the defense and the court while these
matters were being hotly litigated.''
   The defense lawyer said the dispute demonstrates why the law
dealing with national secrets ``is unworkable and unconstitutional''
in the North case.
   ``The government is simply unable to manage the classified
information at issue here in a manner that permits a fair trial,''
said the defense motion. It asked that Gesell consider an earlier
request by the defense that the Classified Information Procedures
Act be declared unconstitutional.
   In court, the head of the prosecution team, John Keker, said
``there was knowledge'' within the independent counsel's office
about the Christic Institute and the Owen memos. But Keker denied
trying to mislead the court, saying ``we certainly didn't make a
representation yesterday that we knew weren't correct.''
   Sullivan said it is ``appalling to me what is happening ... I
believe there is a fraud on the defense.''
   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and a former National
Security Council aide, faces 12 felony charges, including
allegations he lied to lawmakers to cover up his secret efforts to
help the Contras when such assistance was banned by Congress.
   Gesell is assigning code names to mask the identities of foreign
officials and intelligence operatives the government wants kept
secret.
   A CIA headquarters official with whom Owen met in Costa Rica was
assigned the code-name ``CIA One'' during Monday's proceedings.

   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee
recommended on Tuesday that the Senate confirm five of President
Bush's nominees for diplomatic posts including his choice of veteran
diplomat Thomas Pickering to be U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., the committee chairman, said the
action by voice vote and without debate left the panel with no
further nominations before it.
   Bush has said he intends to send other nominations to the Senate
soon but has yet to do so. The delay apparently has been caused by
lengthy background checks each person must undergo before the
nomination can be made.
   The Senate panel approved Pickering, the current U.S. ambassador
to Israel, and four other nominees:
   _Robert M. Kimmitt, former general counsel of the Treasury
Department, to be undersecretary of state for political affairs.
   _Janet Gardner Mullins, who served as media director for the
Bush-Quayle campaign and formerly was chief of staff for Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., to be assistant secretary of state for legislative

   _Margaret Tutwiler, formerly spokesman for the Treasury
Department and a member of the Bush-Quayle campaign team, to be

   BONN, West German
(AP)_ The head of East Germany's renowned
Meissen porcelain company has defected to West Germany, security
sources said Tuesday.
   Reinhard Fichte had been director of the company, founded in 1710
and known around the world for its artistic craftmanship.
   The mass-circulation newspapers Bild and Hamburg Abendblatt
reported Fichte had remained in the West after attending a Frankfurt
trade fair.
   In addition to his duties at Meissen, Fichte was also a close
adviser to Guenter Mittag, an economist and member of the East
German Communist Party's Politburo, the Abendblatt reported.
   The Abendblatt said Fichte himself ``was to advance to the
Politburo.''
   ``He also was accorded many special privileges'' by the communist
authorities, the newspaper said.
   West German security officials confirmed that Fichte, 47, decided
to remain in West Germany after attending a Feb. 18-22 trade fair in
Frankfurt.
   The security officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
would not disclose Fichte's whereabouts and they also did not say
whether he may have had access to any East German security secrets.
   The Abendblatt reported the defection ``came as a complete
surprise to Meissen employees.''
   The newspaper said the porcelain firm in Meissen, East Germany,
did not know what had become of Fichte until informed by the West
German newspaper.
   Company officials had ``exhausted all possibilities ... and had
not excluded that Fichte might have been killed or kidnapped,'' the
newspaper said.
   The Abendblatt did not identify its sources at the Meissen firm.
   The newspaper said Fichte was one of the few East German
businessmen allowed to travel freely outside the East bloc.
   Abendblatt said that Fichte's wife, Jutta, was ``disturbed'' when
informed by the West German newspaper of her husband's plans to stay
in the West.
   Bild reported that Fichte failed to show up at a news conference
at the close of the Frankfurt exposition.

<TEXT>
   Except for a brief thaw late last year,
British-Iranian relations have been troubled for the past 8{ years.
Here is a summary:
   September 1980 _ With Iran's relations with the West in turmoil
over the seizure of the U.S. Embassy hostages, Britain closes its
embassy in Tehran and withdraws its staff for their protection. Four
diplomats stay behind to run a British interests section in the
Swedish Embassy.
   November 1985 _ British businessman Roger Cooper is arrested in
Iran and accused of spying, but is not charged or tried.
   May 1987 _ Police arrest an Iranian diplomat in Manchester on
shoplifting charges. In Tehran, a British diplomat is abducted and
beaten up, apparently in retaliation.
   June 1987 _ Over the years Britain has slowly built up a
19-member staff in its Tehran Embassy. But after a series of
tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions triggered by the Manchester
incident, London recalls all its diplomats in Iran and reduces the
Iranian diplomatic presence in London to a lone charge d'affaires.
   September 1987 _ Iran attacks a British tanker in the Persian
Gulf. Britain hits back by closing the London headquarters of Iran's
worldwide arms-purchasing operation.
   June 1988 _ Iran and Britain have talks in London on compensation
for damage done to each other's embassies in political violence in
1979 and 1980. The successful negotiations lead to broader talks on
British-Iranian relations, and agreement is reached to resume full
diplomatic ties.
   December 1988 _ The British Embassy in Tehran reopens. Nicholas
Nicola, a British tourist held in Iran for more than two years is
freed and comes home. Hopes rise for the release of Cooper, as well
as British hostages believed held by pro-Iranian abductors in
Lebanon.
   February 1989 _ Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini passes a death
sentence on British novelist Salman Rushdie, claiming his novel
``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam. Rushdie's apology is not
accepted in Tehran. Cooper is given a ``heavy'' but unspecified
sentence. Britain and its 11 European Economic Community partners
withdraw their heads of mission from Tehran. Britain goes further by
withdrawing all its diplomats from the newly reopened Tehran
Embassy, and ordering out Iran's two diplomats in London.
   Feb. 28 _ Iran's Parliament votes to sever diplomatic ties with
Britain.

   Police on Tuesday said they discovered a
cocaine refinery in a villa, leading to the arrest of two Italians
and three Colombians and the seizure of 4.4 pounds of pure cocaine.
   The coca paste used to produce the cocaine was smuggled into
Italy mixed with cardboard, which was then used to line suitcase
bottoms, the officers told the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
   Four of those arrested have been accused of criminal association
aimed at drug production and importation as well as drug possession,
ANSA said. A fifth has been accused of selling and possessing drugs,
ANSA said.
   The investigation began after 2.2 pounds of cocaine were seized
in Bologna in January, leading to the arrest of seven people,
including four Peruvians, police said.

   An avalanche swept away a group of French
soldiers training Tuesday in the Pyrenees, killing three and
injuring four, police said.
   The group of 19 paratroopers, based in Bayonne, was training near
Gourette when the avalanche occurred.
   Some of the soldiers were able to free themselves and go for
help. Rescuers found seven men buried in the snow, including the
three who died. Four others were taken to the hospital in Pau, the
nearest large city.

<HEAD>More Illegal Aliens Arrested On Cross-Country Flight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Immigration officials overnight seized 69
illegal aliens about to board the same cross-country flight on which
79 undocumented immigrants were taken into custoday the night
before, authorities said.
   The 69 were trying to board an Eastern Airlines flight to New
York by way of Atlanta, said Immigration and Naturalization Service
spokesman Joe Flanders.
   He said 54 were from Mexico, seven from El Salvador, four from
Colombia and four from Guatemala. Most will be allowed to go home or
request a deportation hearing, he said.
   Flanders said one man was arrested and may have been the
principal smuggler.
   On Monday, authorities seized 79 illegal aliens during Flight
80's 5:35 a.m. stopover in Atlanta, acting on tips from airline
sources and someone who often traveled the route and became
suspicious of fellow passengers.
   Investigators believe illegal aliens have been aboard the Eastern
overnight flight nearly every day for the past 30 days, said Tom
Thomas, an INS spokesman in Atlanta.
   Thomas said the flight might have been used because no plane
tranfers are involved and rates might have been cheaper.
   ``There's a commuter who regularly flies from Los Angeles to
Atlanta who called our office. ... and said, `Hey, it seems there's
an awful lot of Hispanic people who fly this flight. You might want
to check into it,''' Thomas said.
   Thomas said some of the aliens indicated they had paid up to
$4,000 for a package, but authorities don't know what that deal
included other than air fare from California to New York. The
package could have included living arrangements, phony documents and
a job, he added.
   On Monday, the cheapest fares available for the flight were $433
to $577, including taxes, according to a travel agent.
   One of the 79, Elias Quevedo-Gonzalez of Pachalun, Guatemala,
said he borrowed $1,400 from neighbors to make the trip so he could
earn money in the United States to send back to his wife and seven
children.
   ``About four people in my town have done that, and when they came
back I could see their families were much better off,'' the
39-year-old man said. ``They had better clothes and good food.''
   Thomas said Eastern has cooperated fully in the investigation.
   ``We don't in any way connect Eastern and don't want to intimate
that they were even remotely involved at this point,'' he said.
   In Miami, Eastern spokeswoman Virginia Sanchez said, ``All I know
is that the INS had told us they'd be monitoring a flight this week
and, of course, we cooperated with them.''
   In addition to Guatemala, the aliens taken off Monday's flight
came from Mexico, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras and
Ecuador, Thomas said. He said they would be transferred to INS
processing facilities in Florida and Texas for deportation.
   But one of the aliens, Juan De La Cruz-Rodriguez, 34, said he
would do whatever he could to stay in this country ``because if I go
back, they'll put me in prison. They'll kill me if I don't pay what
I owe.''
   De La Cruz-Rodriguez, who said he was trying to make money to
send to his wife and three young sons in the Dominican Republic,
said a smuggler in Mexico helped him and about a dozen others cross
the border, then arranged to have them transported by flatbed truck
to Los Angeles.
   ``I always had the image of America having a lot of money and a
lot of wealth, and that I could find work without any problem,'' he
said.
   He said he sold his truck to raise part of the money and gave the
smuggler almost $1,000. Holding up a quarter, he said, ``That's all
I have left.''

   A yellow cape, red tights and leather
mask might not be enough to draw a crowd in this freewheeling
college town, but Super Barrio has more than his costume, he has a
message.
   Professor Raul Hinojosa said he invited Super Barrio to the
University of California to speak Monday to a class on Latin
American politics because he is a symbol of social change in Mexico.
   Super Barrio, who is rapidly becoming a folk hero in Mexico and
among Mexican immigrants in the United States, first appeared in
1987 in Mexico City, persuading a landlord not to evict poor tenants
behind on their rent.
   Since then, he pops up regularly when there's trouble, traveling
in his Barriomobile. He has allied himself with the Assembly of
Barrios, a union of groups opposing the one-party dominance of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has ruled since the 1920s.
   Super Barrio's costume is a blend of Mexican wrestling lore and
the trappings of U.S. super heroes. But Super Barrio was quick to
point out that he is not Superman.
   ``Superman has super powers,'' he said. ``I do not. I am merely
human.''
   Super Barrio _ like comic book heroes _ keeps his identity
secret. He will only say that he lives in a housing project, is a
former professional wrestler, and is now a street vendor in Mexico
City.

<HEAD>Lujan Says He Intends to Reverse Lowered Royalty Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Manual Lujan Jr. said
Tuesday he intends to reverse his predecessor's plan to lower
royalties on coal taken from mines beneath federal lands.
   Lujan, testifying before the interior subcommittee of the House
Appropriations Committee, also said he would try to get Congress to
raise sharply the $2.50 per acre fee charged for converting oil
shale and other mining claims into outright ownership.
   But Lujan said he found he could not stop a change in the method
of valuing coal that lowers royalties, and it might be Nov. 1 before
he could promulgate a new regulation to revoke it.
   Former Secretary Donald P. Hodel had approved proposals to lower
the royalty on underground coal from 8 percent to 5 percent, and to
exlude state and federal taxes from the value of coal when
calculating royalties.
   While the rate change has not become final, Lujan said, the
valuation method change takes effect Wednesday. He said the
department's lawyers have told him he could not stop that change,
although he intends to try.
   Lujan said he would begin a study immediately of the change in
valuation methods and if production and royalty payments increase,
the aim of the change in the first place, ``then, of course, we
don't want to rescind'' the rule.
   Conceding final defeat in a lawsuit begun in 1920 that the
government had lost twice in the Supreme Court, Hodel issued deeds
of ownership at $2.50 an acre to 82,000 acres of shale land in
Colorado that the new owners promptly sold at a large profit.
   The department resolved to start processing other shale
applications while it decides on rules for determining the validity
of the claims _ a decision that brought much protest in Congress,
protest that Lujan clearly agreed with.
   There are 11 applications and 1,592 claims to 241,000 acres of
shale land in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming.
   ``I can't tell you I'm going to deny these groups (of claimants)
their rights,'' Lujan told the subcommittee. ``I can tell you I'm
going to develop red tape, or whatever the government does so well
... in a process by which we determine if they're valid and that is
going to take at least a year.''
   During that year, he said he would work with Congress to raise
the fee. He said department lawyers had told him his idea that the
fee be pegged to the value of the land could not stand legal
scrutiny.
   He did not mention a specific figure for a new fee, except to say
it should be much higher than $2.50 an acre, a fee that has remained
unchanged since 1872.
   Proposed rules for deciding on the validity of claims were sent
to the Office of Management and Budget in December, and department
spokesman Tim Locke said Lujan had written OMB asking that the draft
be returned ``so he can put it under his own microscope.''
   Half of all federal royalties are returned to state governments,
with just about all going to Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Utah, New
Mexico and North Dakota. Lujan said the states had protested both
planned changes.
   The Western Organization of Resource Councils estimated that
Wyoming would lose $11 million a year from the change in valuation
methods, Colorado would lose $1.3 million, Montana $4.7 million, New
Mexico $650,000, North Dakota $462,000 and Utah $710,000.
   The loss to the federal government would be roughly the same,
$18.8 million a year.
   In all, the federal government received $153 million in coal
royalties in fiscal 1987, the last year for which figures are
complete, and an estimated $246 million in 1988, according to
preliminary estimates.
   The reduction in royalty rate from 8 percent to 5 percent for
underground mines would cost the government $18.2 million to $20.2
million a year if production did not change, the department has
estimated.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Tuesday by the Supreme Court.
   
   CITY LIABILITY
   
   Local governments may be forced to pay monetary damages to people
whose rights are violated by inadequately trained public employees,
the Supreme Court ruled unanimously today.
   Ruling in a case from Canton, Ohio, the justices said cities and
towns may be held legally accountable if the inadequate training
stemmed from governmental ``deliberate indifference.''
   In an opinion by Justice Byron R. White, the court said the
inadequate training also must be closely related to the ultimate
injury suffered before local governments can be forced to pay
damages.
   White said the court was imposing a stringent standard for those
filing such suits because any lesser standard would open local
governments to ``unprecedented liability'' and saddle federal courts
with ``an endless exercise of second-guessing municipal
employee-training programs.''
   The case is Canton vs. Harris, 86-1088.
   
   STRIKERS
   
   The court said railroads and airlines may penalize strikers by
giving their jobs to employees with less seniority who stay on the
job or return to work before the strike ends.
   In a 6-3 ruling which was a victory for Trans World Airlines,
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said that such a policy ``of encouraging
pre-strike workers to remain on the job during the strike or to
abandon the strike and return to work before all vacancies were
filled'' is a legitimate ``exercise of TWA's peaceful economic
power.''
   The case is TWA vs. Flight Attendants, 87-548.
   
   TAX INFORMATION
   
   The court made it easier for the U.S. government to turn over tax
information to a foreign government.
   The 9-0 ruling allows Canadian officials to see financial records
of two Canadian citizens with bank accounts in Washington state.
   The case is U.S. vs. Stuart, 87-1064.
   
   DEATH SENTENCE
   
   The court reinstated a convicted Florida murderer's death
sentence, saying he should have been barred from mounting a
successful constitutional attack in federal courts.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court ruled that Aubrey Adams Jr., forfeited
his right to challenge his sentence in federal court on grounds he
failed to raise in state court.
   Adams was convicted of strangling an 8-year-old girl in Ocala 11
years ago.
   The case is Dugger vs. Adams, 87-121.

   At least three universities are ready for George
Bush to become a former president.
   Rice University, Texas A&amp;M University and Bush's alma mater, Yale
University, already have expressed interest in becoming the site of
his presidential library.
   In a typical case, funds for construction of a presidential
library are raised from private sources, and an institution, such as
a university, provides a site.
   ``Rice is certainly interested in the presidential papers, and we
have initiated conversations with the Bush administration on the
matter,'' Rice President George Rupp said in a statement. ``We are
continuing to work on the opportunity but no one has made a
commitment.''
   Rice partisans note that Secretary of State James Baker, a native
Houstonian and a close friend of Bush's, has begun depositing his
papers at Rice's Fondren Library.
   They also note that in 1978 Bush was an adjunct professor of
administrative science at Rice, teaching a graduate-level course in
``organization theory'' based on his experience as an oilman, member
of Congress, chairman of the Republican National Committee, director
of the CIA and U.S. envoy to China.
   Bryan Jones, head of Texas A&amp;M's political science department,
and a colleague, presidential scholar George Edwards, drafted a
memorandum urging the university to explore the possibilities of
gaining the presidential library.
   Newsweek magazine quoted Bush as saying he has already decided
his presidential papers should go to a Texas university. That has
not deterred Yale.
   ``I'm sure Yale will be making an effort to persuade the
president to locate his library here or at least some place near
here,'' said Jack Siggins, an administrator of Yale's library.
   ``I believe that possibility has been mentioned to President Bush
_ in fact, before he was President Bush _ by Yale's president, Benno
Schmidt.''

   Mayor Eugene Sawyer, lacking the monolithic
support among fellow blacks that twice put Harold Washington in City
Hall, bet his future on blacks voting in today's mayoral primary
against front-runner Richard M. Daley.
   ``We must win this race,'' Sawyer told a crowd of blacks Monday
night at his last campaign stop _ a South Side church with Jesse
Jackson.
   ``I've got to do it for Harold.''
   Daley, son of the quintessential political boss who ruled Chicago
for more than two decades, remained confident in his quest for the
Democratic nomination even though the most recent poll showed his
lead reduced from 10 points to 7.
   ``From every community,'' Daley told a Polish-American women's
group, ``you see some of the wealthiest people and some of the
poorest people. You see them all reaching out to you.''
   Light snow fell as the polls opened at 6 a.m., but skies cleared
by mid-morning. Project LEAP, a watchdog group, said its observer
reported as many as 25 late openings among the 1,600 to 1,700
polling places, more than in the previous seven elections.
   Sawyer and Daley, the Cook County prosecutor, are the top
candidates in a four-way race. The winner advances to the April 4
general election, which was forced by the death 15 months ago of
Washington, Chicago's first black mayor.
   Polls have indicated that Sawyer would get most of the black vote
and Daley most of the white and Hispanic vote.
   ``I think the mayor's message has gotten through,'' said Sawyer's
campaign spokesman, Larry Horist. ``The black community has pretty
much decided it's not right to abstain from voting, and they will
turn out.''
   Blacks and whites each comprise about 40 percent of the city's
population and Hispanics nearly 20 percent.
   The nominee will face the winner of the Republican primary,
whites Herbert Sohn or write-in candidate Edward Vrdolyak, and
third-party candidate Timothy Evans, who is black, in April.
   The winner of the general election will serve the final two years
of Washington's four-year term.
   The Chicago Board of Election Commissioners predicted 68 percent
of the city's 1.55 million voters would vote today. But Thomas
Leach, board spokesman, lowered that projection to 64 percent based
on early voting.
   Elsewhere today, three challengers in St. Petersburg, Fla., are
trying to unseat Mayor Robert Ulrich in a nonpartisan primary. And
in Wichita, Kan., where residents approved a change in the structure
of city government last November, 16 candidates are vying in the
first mayoral election since 1916.
   The Chicago campaign has been mostly devoid of the racial
polarization that marred many previous campaigns. Yet Sawyer knows
he must get some support from Evans' backers in order to block Daley
and keep the seat he won during a raucous City Council meeting in
December 1987, one week after Washington's death.
   Sawyer has received an enormous lift from Jackson, a Chicagoan
and 1988 Democratic presidential candidate who has walked downtown
streets, preached from church pulpits and shaken the hands of
commuters all with the aim of generating enthusiasm for the acting
mayor.
   During Monday night's rally, Jackson recalled the long struggle
for black voting rights.
   ``We died too young, bled too profusely and lost too many martyrs
to not vote,'' Jackson said. ``We stand tonight on the tombstone of
the martyrs who paid not with the dollar but their lives for the
right to vote.''
   Some people, however, were less than enthused with the choices.
   ``Nobody's really said anything about what they can do for the
city,'' said Theresa Hood, 22, a likely Sawyer voter who said
divisions in the black community since Washington's death have left
her disillusioned.
   ``It seems like when he died, we all forgot what he stood for.''
   Among Republicans _ who haven't had a mayor since William Hale
``Big Bill'' Thompson ran City Hall and ``Scarface'' Al Capone ruled
the streets _ the wild card was Vrdolyak and his bid to win the GOP
primary through write-ins.
   But Sohn, a doctor and the party's endorsed candidate, insisted
he would beat Vrdolyak, former alderman and ex-chairman of the local
Democratic party.
   Vrdolyak's entrance into the race was seen by some as a threat to
Daley.
   ``What we don't know is the effect of Vrdolyak's personal
campaigning in the last few days,'' said William Aukstik, a Daley
worker who was promoting his candidate in Vrdolyak's home ward.

<HEAD>Total Medical Costs of AIDS May Reach $24 Billion By 1992, Study
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lifetime cost of treating AIDS patients
diagnosed with the disease in the five-year period beginning in 1988
is estimated at $24.3 billion, according to a study released Tuesday.
   The report said that the lifetime treatment cost for a patient
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome is about $60,000, a figure
that may change as treatment improves.
   The report gives these estimates for the numbers of AIDS patients
diagnosed in the indicated year and total lifetime medical cost of
those patients:
   _ 1988: 39,000 AIDS new cases, total lifetime medical treatment
$2.6 billion.
   _ 1989: 54,000 cases, $3.5 billion.
   _ 1990: 71,000 cases, $4.7 billion.
   _ 1991: 91,000 cases, $6.0 billion.
   _ 1992: 114,000 cases, $7.5 billion.
   Fred J. Hellinger, an economist at the National Center for Health
Services Research and Health Care Technology Assessment and who
compiled the study, said the estimated $60,000 lifetime medical cost
per patient is lower than some earlier estimates because AIDS
patients now are spending less time in hospitals and receiving more
care as outpatients.
   Hellinger said that research by three insurance organizations
estimated that about $50,000 will be paid by health insurers for
each AIDS patient. For the study, he added $5,000 for expenses not
covered by the insurance companies and another $5,000 for the cost
of AZT, an antiviral drug approved by the Food and Drug
Administration in 1987.
   ``The costs of treating an AIDS victim may fall because treatment
throughout the nation becomes more effective,'' Hellinger said.
``But it is also possible that treatment costs may continue to vary
dramatically across sites and that the approval of new drugs to
treat AIDS patients will increase longevity and, thereby, offset any
savings realized through more effective treatment.''
   The study's projections of the numbers of new AIDS cases is based
on the 72 percent increase in diagnosed cases during the last two
months of 1987 and the first six months of 1988. Hellinger said the
study assumed that this trend would continue indefinitely.
   Hellinger's study appeared in Inquiry, a journal published
quarterly by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association in Chicago.

   An anonymous caller who said he belonged to a
group that claims to hold a missing Israeli paratrooper threatened
on Tuesday to kill the soldier unless Israel releases 1,500
Palestinian prisoners.
   The anonymous caller told Israel radio his group would release a
cassette to prove they were holding the soldier, Avi Sassportas,
according to radio reporter Elihu Ben-On.
   ``He said: `We are the organization that is holding the soldier
and we want you to release 1,500 prisoners. If not, the soldier will
die,''' Ben-On told The Associated Press.
   He said the caller, who spoke Hebrew with an Arab accent, read
from a prepared statement and refused to answer questions. He hung
up after about 15 seconds and did not name the group he claimed to
represent.
   On Monday, a similar call to the Agence France Presse news agency
said a group called the Palestinian Arab Army was holding
Sassportas, who disappeared 13 days ago. The caller said the group
was not linked to the PLO.
   The Palestinian Arab Army was not publicly known before Monday's
call. West Bank Commander Amram Mitzna told the Haaretz daily it has
been operating since the start of the Palestinian uprising, but
later said on radio nothing was known of the group.
   On Israel radio, Mitzna said the army was treating Tuesday's call
seriously but did not plan to comply with the demand to release
prisoners.
   The caller did not say which prisoners should be freed; army
figures indicate as many as 9,000 Palestinians have been jailed in
connection with the uprising.
   Sassportas was last seen Feb. 16 near Ashkelon after leaving his
base in southern Israel to hitch a ride home to Ashod. He was
wearing his uniform and armed with an M-16 assault rifle. The area
is close to the Gaza Strip.
   Thousands of people have participated in searches since then.
   Proof that he was kidnapped by a Palestinian group could
undermine a current shift in public opinion toward negotiations with
the PLO.
   Army officials said Monday the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, a radical Marxist PLO faction, had claimed
it abducted Sassportas.
   Israeli warplanes on Tuesday bombed and rocketed a base in
Lebanon belonging to the front. Lebanese police said two guerrillas
were killed and 33 people injured.

   Oprah Winfrey, dubbed an ``unforgettable woman''
in a new cosmetics ad, says she hopes the designation will inspire
young blacks.
   ``As a child, it never occurred to me I might be considered
beautiful, because none of the models looked like me,'' Ms. Winfrey
said Tuesday in USA Today. ``If just one little black girl sees the
photo and thinks she's beautiful because she sees a part of herself
in me, I will be grateful.''
   A photo composite by Richard Avedon of the newly slim,
leotard-clad talk-show host appears in ``W'' with a dozen more
magazines to follow.
   Ms. Winfrey was chosen because of a beauty that is ``heightened

said Revlon Chairman Ronald O. Perelman.
   Liza Minnelli, Brooke Shields and Audrey Hepburn preceded Ms.
Winfrey as ``unforgettable women'' in the ad campaign.

   Monroe, 77, has held the festival on his 94-acre farm near
Beanblossom for 22 years, but shocked fans last year by announcing
he had had enough and planned to sell the farm.
   Monroe, who had colon cancer surgery nine years ago, said then
that he was tired of the road and wanted to spend more time at his
home near Nashville, Tenn. But when countless letters and phone
calls from disappointed fans poured in, coupled with an improvement
in Monroe's health and no quick buyers for the farm, the musician
reversed himself.
   ``I feel pretty good. I'm in better shape than I was last year,''
Monroe told the Indianapolis Star on Monday. ``Everybody thought I
should slow down and maybe I did, too. But I feel so much better.''
   This year's festival will be June 15-18.

woman's search for self-fulfillment from the 1960s to the present.
   The play, which opened off-Broadway in December to critical
acclaim, moves to Broadway next week. Wasserstein, 38, established
her reputation as a wry social commentator with her off-Broadway
hit, ``Isn't It Romantic.''
   The $5,000 prize was awarded Monday to the playwright by actress
Jessica Tandy during a ceremony in New York.
   Timberlake Wertenbaker, a British playwright, was awarded a
$1,000 runner-up prize for her play ``Our Country's Good,'' set in
18th-century Australia. The prize was established in 1978 to honor
Susan Blackburn, the American actress and author who died in 1977.

   Rocker Joan Jett on Broadway? Hey, it's a dream
come true for the leather-clad singer who received a Grammy nominee
for her single ``I Hate Myself for Loving You.''
   ``When I was about 11, I was in a drama class and I wanted to
grow up and be an actress. I wanted to be on Broadway,'' Jett told
the Daily News on Tuesday. ``So in a weird way, I guess that came
true.''
   Jett opens a sold-out five-day run at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater
Wednesday with the Blackhearts _ a band she says epitomizes the true
spirit of rock 'n' roll.
   ``There are a lot of bands out there today that call themselves
rock 'n' roll when they really aren't,'' said Jett. ``To me, rock
'n' roll is a very sacred, spontaneous thing _ like Chuck Berry, the
Rolling Stones, the Who.''

   Premier Andreas Papandreou's daughter says
her father's live-in girlfriend has isolated him from his family.
   Sofia Papandreou-Katsaneva, 34, told the left-wing daily
Eleftherotypia Tuesday that the girlfriend, Dimitra Liani, had
ruined her relationship with her father. ``I can't believe that
everything that's happened has happened with his volition,'' she
said.
   Papandreou, 70, has been living with the 34-year-old airline
stewardess since he underwent open-heart surgery in September. He
has asked for a divorce from his wife of 38 years, Margaret, but
they have yet to work out the details.
   The Liani affair, his health and several financial scandals have
hurt Papandreou's standing among Greek voters, a public opinion poll
published Tuesday in the daily Ethnos indicated. The poll showed
Papandreou's popularity had slipped to 14.4 percent as compared to
18 percent for the leader of the main conservative opposition New
Democracy Party.

   A February half-price sale on fines has
cleared driving records, and perhaps consciences, for many
motorists, a judge said Tuesday.
   Traffic Judge Bill Watt estimated that payments increased by a
third during the month-long drive to reduce a backlog of more than
5,000 traffic warrants and 3,500 parking tickets.
   Little Rock Municipal Traffic Court told violators that they had
until Tuesday to clear their fines for half the amount owed. The
offer covered fines dating from 1986 to January 1989, Watt said.
   Many of the warrants included a charge of failure to appear in
court, which adds $100 to the original penalty.
   The cut rate is not costing the city money, because many of the
warrants would be uncollectible without the expense of sending
officers out to contact the violators, Watt said.
   ``If we get $1 in revenue off a warrant from someone voluntarily
surrendering themselves, we are not losing $2, which we might not
get anyway, we are gaining $1,'' he said.

   Overriding opposition from gun owners and the
city attorney, the City Council approved a ban on possession and
sale of assault weapons like those used in a Stockton schoolyard
shooting last month.
   The ordinance was approved 7-2 Monday.
   Council members also empowered police to impound for up to three
days semiautomatic assault weapons found during patrols. The
ordinance would allow police to determine whether the guns are
stolen or can be linked to a crime.
   Police previously could confiscate a gun only during an arrest.
   Several proposals to ban or restrict assault weapons have been
introduced in the Legislature since last month's schoolyard attack,
in which Patrick Purdy killed five children and wounded 30 people
with an AK-47 rifle before killing himself.
   Los Angeles, Stockton and Compton and Santa Clara County have
also passed bans on assault weapons, but National Rifle Association
members last week asked the state Supreme Court to overturn the Los
Angeles and Stockton ordinances.
   San Diego City Attorney John Witt argued that his city's
ordinance would probably be struck down because the state has sole
authority to legislate firearms.
   Councilman Wes Pratt, however, said the city needs to take such
weapons out of criminals' hands.
   ``Now is the time to act, and this is a reasonable approach,'' he
said.
   Semiautomatic assault weapons fire one round with each squeeze of
the trigger until the ammunition clip is expended.

<HEAD>Mississippi Working to Preserve Pre-Civil War Home of Free Black
Man</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NATCHEZ, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A movement is under way to preserve the
home of a black writer whose violent death went unpunished because
of pre-Civil War legal discrimination.
   William Johnson, a successful barber, businessman and diarist, is
considered by historians the most prominent free black man in
antebellum Mississippi.
   Freed from slavery by his white owner in Louisiana, Johnson built
a three-story brick home in this bluff-lined Mississippi River town
in the early 1840s. It remained in his family until purchased in
1976 by a garden club.
   ``What many people do not realize is that Natchez had almost half
of the state's entire free black population before the war,'' said
Mimi Miller, a historic preservation consultant. ``What made Johnson
so important was that he kept a diary that represents the most
complete and accurate account of a free black man during this period
of our history.''
   Miller, who has worked with the Natchez Garden Club to preserve
the home, said that through Johnson's writings, ``historians were
able to learn that, just as in the white society, different levels
of social class existed within the free black society. This society
was separate and distinct from blacks who were slaves.''
   The diary and other information indicates Johnson was ``accepted
and respected'' by the community, and when he died in 1851, ``he
received a very large obituary but the great and tragic thing is his
death went unpunished because he was black,'' Miller said.
   Johnson apparently was shot by a man named Baylor Winn after a
long dispute over land boundaries.
   Only blacks witnessed the shooting, and under Mississippi law at
the time a black man could not testify against a white man. Miller
said Winn represented himself as white, but prosecutors, in hopes of
allowing the testimony of black witnesses, argued he had some black
ancestry.
   ``Natchez was so outraged they had to move his trial to another
town so Winn could get an impartial jury,'' she said. ``The Johnson
family hired an attorney, Will T. Martin, who later became one of
Mississippi's highest ranking Confederate generals.''
   Despite Martin's efforts, Winn went free.
   Johnson's house proved to be a historical treasure trove
containing much more than the 16-year diary, which was published by
the Louisiana State University Press in 1951.
   In the attic were nearly 1,400 legal and financial documents,
personal and business correspondence, volumes of account books and
old newspapers and sheet music dating from 1793, said Margaret Moss
of the Natchez Garden Club.
   Miller said preservationists hope to use the home's ground floor
for an exhibit on Natchez's black history, and restore the living
quarters upstairs with period furnishings.
   In 1987, the Legislature authorized the state's Archives and
History Department to buy, restore and administer the home once
sufficient funds are secured, said director Elbert Hilliard. The
effort will require a $1.5 million endowment, Hilliard said.
   An advisory committee has been formed to study ways to raise
money from private sources. Meanwhile, the National Trust for
Historic Preservation and the Jack Daniel Foundation for Preserving
American Landmarks and Traditions is working on raising $4,000 to
make immediate repairs.

   The cargo door that ripped off a Boeing 747 over
the Pacific had electrical problems in recent months and a seal on
the door was repaired in January, an investigator said.
   For the pilot who safely landed the damaged jetliner, Capt. David
M. Cronin, the flight was to be his next-to-last before retiring,
and ``now, we will have another reason to celebrate,'' said his
daughter, Kelly Hart of Hawaii.
   After nine people were sucked out of the jumbo jet to their
deaths, the 59-year-old United Airlines pilot managed to turn the
plane around and land safely in Honolulu on only two of the four
engines.
   Her father ``gives all the credit to the Heavenly Father watching
over him,'' another daughter, Karen Twigg-Smith, told The Honolulu
Advertiser.
   Investigators looking into Friday's accident have focused on the
latching mechanism of the cargo door that tore off and left a
10-by-20-foot hole in the side of the 18-year-old plane.
   In December, electrical problems were reported more than once in
the airline's maintenance logs and the forward cargo door had to be
closed manually, National Transportation Safety Board investigator
Lee Dickinson said late Monday.
   In January, a seal on the cargo door was repaired, he said.
   Dickinson said he did not know whether those incidents required
reports to the Federal Aviation Administration. He also refused to
characterize the seriousness of the problems.
   ``We don't know what's normal,'' he said, but added, ``it is
proper to close this door manually.''
   Airline spokesman Rob Doughty also refused to comment on the
repairs, saying he needed to look at the records.
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said Monday that
although preliminary investigation indicates the cargo door opened
in flight, it was too early to speculate on the cause of the
accident.
   The cargo bay door closes down, electrically and manually. The
hatch is hinged at the top and has eight latching mechanisms along
the bottom, attached to the plane's frame, as well as a latching
mechanism and a hook pin on each side, Dickinson said.
   Boeing Co. on Sunday told the operators of 712 Boeing 747s
worldwide to check the cargo doors, but Boeing spokesman David
Jimenez said the notices were ``by no means'' speculating on the
cause of the accident.
   Dickinson said Monday's inspection revealed the plane's oxygen
system failed after the accident on the New Zealand-bound flight.
The accident occurred 100 miles south of Honolulu at 22,000 feet,
but none of the survivors appeared to suffer long-term affects from
lack of oxygen, officials said.
   Of the 354 people aboard Flight 811, 27 were treated at
hospitals, mostly for minor injuries caused by flying debris. Two
remained hospitalized Monday.
   A preliminary review of the cockpit voice recorder showed the
pilot had no warning of the accident and the cockpit crew discussed
only emergency procedures afterward, not a possible cause or
warning, Dickinson said.
   He refused to quote the recorder, but described it as a ``good
tape'' that captured the accident and its aftermath.
   United has refused to allow Cronin or the rest of the 18-member
crew to talk to reporters about the flight.
   Twigg-Smith said Flight 811 to New Zealand and Australia and the
return flight were to be her father's last after 34 years with
United.
   ``He said to me, `There were a couple of times I didn't think we
were going to make it.''' Twigg-Smith, who also lives in Hawaii,
told the newspaper. ``I'm pretty sure he told me he was scared. The
problem of losing altitude, of keeping the airplane up, scared him.''
   Hart said her father told her, ``I felt like I needed a cold
beer,'' when describing his feelings as he flew the crippled
jetliner.
   Cronin's daughters said the retirement party is still scheduled
for March 11 in Hawaii. Hart said her father, who has returned to
his home in North Lake Tahoe, Nev., has expanded the guest list.
   ``He wants to invite all the flight attendants who were aboard
Flight 811,'' Hart said.

<HEAD>FCC Chairman Pushes AT&amp;T Pricing Change Despite House Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL PAGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission said Tuesday he will press toward overhaul of AT&amp;T's
pricing system, despite congressional concern that the plan will
lead to windfall profits at the expense of consumers.
   After three hours of testimony before skeptical members of the
House telecommunications and finance subcommittee, FCC chairman
Dennis Patrick said the agency will vote on the ``rate cap'' plan
for interstate services on March 16. He said it would go into effect
July 1 if approved unless it is blocked by Congress.
   Although committee members agreed AT&amp;T's rate structure should be
changed, several complained about the FCC plan and one said it could
make the company ``an enormous profit-making machine.''
   Patrick had postponed the FCC vote from Jan. 30 because of the
congressional concern, but he said he would not delay it further.
   ``The questions asked by the committee were questions that have
already been discussed,'' he said after the hearing. ``We've made
several changes to satisfy their concerns and we'll continue to
discuss them. But the commission will consider the pricing matter on
the 16th.''
   The proposal would change the two decades-old ``rate of return''
regulation that allows American Telephone &amp; Telegraph certain
specified profits beyond its costs.
   The new plan _ what Patrick called ``incentive regulation'' _
would place a cap on what AT&amp;T could charge customers but would
allow the telecommunications giant to keep any funds after costs as
profit. The plan did not make it through Congress last year, but
Patrick is moving the changes through the commission by
administrative action.
   Patrick's plan to press forward leaves Congress under a tight
deadline to act on the complex matter if opponents are to come up
with an alternative. And subcommittee chairman Edward Markey,
D-Mass., said, ``At this point we don't have a consensus.''
   Patrick told the subcommittee the change would spur efficiency
and AT&amp;T's ability to modernize and develop new communications
technology ``to the benefit of consumers in both the short and long
run.''
   He said an FCC analysis showed the change would save customers
$900 million over four years, with $700 million of the savings going
to residential customers.
   But consumer groups contend the incentive would actually be for
AT&amp;T to seek higher-volume corporate business while raising rates
for consumers.
   Patrick outlined provisions that would limit AT&amp;T's ability to
raise or lower rates for various customers and said he would look at
other safeguards to ensure price changes for less populated regions
``remain within the zone of reasonableness.''
   But Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., said that despite ``making a move
in the right direction,'' the FCC had not done enough to protect
consumers.
   ``I think they should not go ahead with the vote ... in view of
the bipartisan concerns the committee has,'' Boucher said. ``I'd say
we would have price caps in due course. But under this plan, AT&amp;T
could be an enormous profit machine.''
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, suggested the FCC consider requiring
that consumers share half of all the profits above a certain level,
a proposal Patrick said the commission would discuss.
   Under the plan Patrick outlined at the hearing, AT&amp;T would have
to cut overall prices by 3 percent over four years.
   The plan would also divide AT&amp;T's services into three ``baskets''
_ one group including residential and small business customers, for
example _ and allow only certain price increases or decreases for
each service.

<HEAD>Growth Rate Slowest in 2 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy grew at a lackluster annual rate of
2 percent in the final three months of 1988, the slowest pace in two
years, reflecting a worsening trade deficit and the lingering
effects of the summer drought, the government said Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said the slowdown in the gross national
product, the total output of goods and services, was accompanied by
a pickup in the inflation rate as food prices and the costs of
imports both rose.
   While the 2 percent overall growth figure was unchanged from an
initial report a month ago, economists labeled the new GNP
statistics disturbing because of the weakness in trade, the speed-up
in inflation and an acceleration of consumer spending.
   ``The shape of the economy looks worse than we thought,'' said
David Wyss, senior financial economist for Data Resources Inc., of
Lexington, Mass. ``All the changes were in the wrong direction.''
   Economists were concerned because the new GNP report showed that
the country's trade imbalance worsened even more than previously
estimated during the fourth quarter as imports grew at an annual
rate of 13 percent, swamping a 7 percent gain in exports.
   Consumer spending rose at a robust 3.5 percent annual rate, too
fast given current constraints on production resulting from tight
labor markets and high operating rates, economists said. The jump in
consumer spending, which went primarily to big-ticket items such as
cars, also showed that Americans' appetite for foreign goods is
unabated.
   ``The surge in consumption pulled in more imports with the result
that the deterioration in the trade deficit was worse than
previously assumed,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the
National Association of Manufacturers.
   It marked the second consecutive quarter that the GNP trade
deficit worsened and served to emphasize economists' contention that
America's trade woes are a long way from being solved.
   The fourth quarter GNP increase followed a 2.5 percent
third-quarter rise and was the slowest quarterly increase since a
1.4 percent rate in the final three months of 1986.
   The fourth quarter figure was depressed by the lingering effects
of last summer's drought. Without the drought effects, the economy
would have expanded at a 3.1 percent rate.
   On the inflation front, a GNP price measure that reflects
changing consumption patterns rose at an annual rate of 5.3 percent
in the fourth quarter, up from a 4.7 percent rate of increase in the
third quarter.
   The GNP deflator rose at rates of 3.4 percent or less over the
last three years and economists said the spike above 5 percent would
set off alarm bells at the Federal Reserve, which has already
embarked on a new round of credit tightening in an effort to control
inflation.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, in his first
congressional appearance since the Fed boosted its key bank lending
rate Friday, repeated the central bank's ``determination to resist
any pickup in inflation'' and called on Congress and the
administration to agree on a credible multi-year plan to reduce the
budget deficit.
   In another economic report Tuesday, the National Association of
Realtors said existing single-family home sales fell a sharp 7.4
percent in January to an annual rate of 3.63 million units. The
median price of a home rose 3.2 percent to $91,500.
   In a third report, the Commerce Department said that the deficit
in merchandise trade, measured on a balance of payments basis,
climbed to $32 billion in the October-December quarter, 10 percent
higher than in the previous quarter.
   Economists said all the trade statistics show the improvement in
trade in the first half of 1988, which accounted for much of the
economy's growth last year, has stalled and will mean weaker growth
in 1989.
   For all of 1988, the GNP rose by 3.8 percent, the best annual
performance since a 6.8 percent rise in 1984. The annual figure was
unchanged from the initial estimate last month.
   The Bush administration is counting on strong economic growth of
3.2 percent in 1989 to generate higher government revenues and help
to reduce the budget deficit without a tax increase.
   However, many private forecasters are looking for a much smaller
GNP increase this year of around 2.7 percent, contending that
continued weakness in trade and the Fed's credit-tightening will
constrain growth.
   The central bank is attempting to engineer a ``soft landing'' in
which growth slows enough to control inflation but the economy does
not weaken so much that the country heads into a recession.
   But Richard Rahn, chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, said Tuesday that the weak 2 percent GNP rate in the
fourth quarter showed that the Fed was being overzealous in its
concerns about inflation.

   K.T. Oslin, who emerged as 1988's robust
queen of down-home music with ``Eighties Ladies,'' got five Academy
of Country Music Award nominations, including best record for ``I'll
Always Come Back.''
   Among the nominees announced during a Tuesday morning news
conference at Disneyland were eight who got three nominations
apiece, including such venerable performers as Reba McEntire, Randy
Travis and Hank Williams Jr.
   The 24th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards ceremony takes
place April 10 in Burbank and will be televised as a two-hour
special on NBC-TV. Ballots cast by the 2,000 academy members decide
winners.
   Miss Oslin also won nods for female vocalist, her album ``This
Woman'' and two video nominations, for ``Hold Me'' and ``I'll Always
Come Back.''
   In addition to competing for the biggest share of ACM ``Hat''
trophies, Miss Oslin joins ``Dallas'' star Patrick Duffy and
gentleman cowboy George Strait as hosts of the show.
   Miss Oslin, the academy's best new female artist last year,
failed to win a nomination in the coveted entertainer of the year
category, however. Those nods went to familiar faces: Alabama, The
Judds, Strait, Travis and Williams.
   Male vocalist nominees were Strait, Travis, Williams, Ricky Van
Shelton and Dwight Yoakam, while female vocalist contenders were
Miss Oslin, Miss McEntire, Tanya Tucker, Rosanne Cash and Kathy
Mattea.
   New female vocalist nominees were Vicki Bird, Suzy Bogguss, Cee
Cee Chapman, Linda Davis and Donna Meade, while contenders in the
new male category were Rodney Crowell, J.C. Crowley, Skip Ewing,
David Lynn Jones and Paul Overstreet.
   Top group nods went to Alabama, The Desert Rose Band, Highway
101, The Oak Ridge Boys and Restless Heart, and duet nominees were
the Bellamy Brothers, Rodney Crowell-Rosanne Cash, The Judds,
Sweethearts of the Rodeo and Dwight Yoakam-Buck Owens.
   Single record nominees included ``Don't Close Your Eyes,'' Keith
Whitley; ``Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses,'' Miss Mattea; ``I
Told You So,'' Travis; ``I'll Always Come Back,'' Miss Oslin; ``I'll
Leave This World Loving You,'' Van Shelton; and ``Strong Enough to
Bend,'' Miss Tucker.
   Best song contenders were ``Don't Close Your Eyes,'' Whitley;
``Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses,'' Miss Mattea; ``I Know How He
Feels,'' Miss McEntire; ``Set 'Em Up Joe,'' Vern Gosdin; and
``Strong Enough to Bend,'' Miss Tucker.
   Album of the year nominees were ``Buenos Noches From a Lonely
Room,'' Yoakam; ``Chiseled in Stone,'' Gosdin; ``If You Ain't Lovin'
You Ain't Livin','' Strait; ``Loving Proof,'' Van Shelton; and
``This Woman,'' Miss Oslin.
   Video contenders were ``The Old Man No One Loves,'' George Jones;
``Sunday Kind of Love,'' Miss McEntire; ``Hold Me,'' Miss Oslin;
``I'll Always Come Back,'' Miss Oslin; and ``Young Country,''
Williams.

designated contact, Ambassador Robert Pelletreau, criticized last
Thursday's raid as having a negative impact on the two-month-old
U.S.-PLO dialogue and on prospects for Israel-Palestinian talks.
   ``There is no ambivalence how we feel,'' spokesman Charles E.
Redman said. ``We don't condone this type of operation.''
   Three guerrillas from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, a radical faction of the PLO, attacked Israeli soldiers
and Christian militiamen in southern Lebanon about a mile from the
Israeli border. They were gunned down without other loss of life.
   The Israeli government said the guerrillas were attempting to
infiltrate Israel itself.
   In a similar incident, five guerrillas from two other factions of
the PLO were intercepted and slain in southern Lebanon on Feb. 4.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and spokesman Redman
criticized that attack, as well. Baker said on Feb. 11 that
``actions such as this _ directed against civilian or military
targets, inside or outside of Israel _ were something that gave us
trouble.''
   After the incident the State Department said it was conducting an
investigation. Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arad charged the attack was
evidence that Arafat had never given up terrorism.
   Pelletreau's meeting with the PLO official, Hakam Ballaoui, in
Tunisia was the fifth with the organization since Arafat issued
statements urged on him by the Reagan administration in mid-December
renouncing terrorism and accepting Israel's right to exist.
   At the time, Richard W. Murphy, who was then assistant secretary
of state for the Near East, and other senior U.S. officials said the
new U.S. dialogue with the PLO would be suspended if terrorism
recurred.
   Asked if either of the two incidents in southern Lebanon were
instances of terrorism, Redman said: ``We have said from the very
start there are going to be things that would have to be addressed
on a case-by-case basis. That's what we are doing. And as we see
these various cases that arise we are making our views known to the
PLO.''
   He said Pelletreau had given Ballaoui the view of the latest raid
Redman issued on Monday. It was that the PLO ``cannot escape
responsibility'' for the attack and that ``we do not condone this
type of activity.''
   Redman said the raids and Israel's attack Tuesday on Palestinian
guerrilla positions in the Chouf Mountains of Lebanon underscored a
need for security arrangements to protect the people of both
countries.
   ``We deplore the loss of life and needless suffering of innocent
people on both sides,'' the spokesman said.
   Lebanese police said two guerrillas were killed and 38 people,
including 26 children, were injured in the Israeli bombing.

<HEAD>Commissioner Says Budget Restraints Hurt Nuclear Safety Effort</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tight limits on the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission budget during the Reagan administration seriously hurt
the agency's search for ways to improve nuclear plant safety, the
commission chairman told Congress on Tuesday.
   Lando W. Zech Jr. told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
that since 1984 the agency's budget had declined, even as attention
to safety needs had increased.
   ``The reductions have had a significant impact on our safety
research program over the years,'' Zech said. ``We believe this
trend must be reversed.''
   The NRC's current budget is $426 million, compared with $466
million in 1984.
   In presenting the commission's request for an 11 percent overall
budget increase, to $475 million for the year beginning Oct. 1, Zech
said half the extra money was ``urgently needed'' to strengthen
safety programs.
   Zech told the panel the safety record of the nation's 108 fully
operating nuclear power plants had improved in recent years, but
stressed that more work was needed _ by regulators as well as plant
owners _ to make nuclear power more reliable.
   ``We have not yet achieved excellence across the board,'' in
nuclear plant operations, he said, although plant owners are taking
safety requirements more seriously.
   Zech said the NRC, with a bigger budget for safety programs,
would increase the number of agency staffers assigned as resident
inspectors at nuclear plants. The commission currently has at least
one such inspector at each plant.
   ``We believed that the NRC resident inspection program has played
a significant role in improving industry safety performance and that
the expansion of the program is necessary to achieve further
improvements,'' Zech said.
   The commission chairman also said an agency decision was due as
early as next week on a proposed rule change aimed at speeding up
licensing for nuclear plants.
   The change would allow utilities to get federal approval for a
construction permit and an operating license before starting the
project. Under current rules, the NRC does not consider the
operating license application until after the construction has
begun. As a result, utilities in some cases have completed plants
but been unable to win approval to operate them.
   Zech called the proposed change an ``historic ruling,'' although
he added that he was still reviewing the proposal and had not
decided whether to vote for it. Several members of the committee
told Zech they strongly favored the change.
   Rep. Bob Clement, D-Tenn., said the commission should move
quickly to adopt the streamlined licensing system in order to
encourage expansion of nuclear power.
   ``Without standardization and licensing reform, it is very
unlikely that there will be additional orders of commercial nuclear
plants,'' Clement said. No orders have been placed for nuclear
plants since 1979, the year of the Three Mile Island reactor
accident in Pennsylvania that raised new safety concerns.
   Zech also told the panel the NRC was preparing to adopt shortly a
regulation requiring random drug and alcohol testing of employees at
all nuclear plants.

<TEXT>
   More than a dozen eminent Chinese intellectuals on
Tuesday criticized a proposed dam on the Yangtze River as an
ill-considered, wasteful project that would serve only as a memorial
to its builders.
   In a move extremely rare in this authoritarian society, the
informal alliance of of writers, engineers and former government
officials held a news conference to issue a book criticizing the
hydroelectric project.
   ``There is only one Yangtze River, and it belows to the entire
nation and all mankind,'' said Dai Qing, a newspaper editor who
compiled the book of essays. ``Mankind should not abuse it.''
   ``We have discussed this back and forth for more than 30 years
and still cannot resolve'' the problems, said 96-year-old Sun Yueqi,
who heads the economic committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Committee, a prestigious but powerless body of
intellectuals.
   ``When it comes to producing electricity, the dam is no good, and
it will destroy (river) shipping,'' he said.
   The government is in the final stages of studying the proposed
Three Gorges Hyroelectric Project, which calls for a 610-foot-high
dam in central China where the mighty Yangtze passes through
towering cliffs eulogized by Chinese poets for centuries.
   The project would generate up to 17,000 megawatts of electricity.
Cost estimates range from the official one of about $10 billion to
some critics' estimate of $30 billion.
   The idea of harnessing energy from the river's turbulent passage
through the Three Gorges in Hubei province first was suggested in
the 1920s. It has been considered repeatedly over the years but
never acted upon because of the huge expense, engineering difficulty
and what critics say would be serious damage to the environment and
river shipping.
   Nearly 1 million people would have to be moved to make way for a
vast new reservoir. The area also has been hit by earthquakes in the
past, and some critics say a quake could crack the dam and cause a
massive disaster.
   Leading writer Zhang Jie told the news conference that backers of
the project have not evaluated it scientifically but look on it as a
sort of personal monument. ``We don't want to put up a memorial
plaque that will win much fame but little benefit,'' she said.
   Premier Li Peng, formerly Minister of Power, is believed to be
one of its main supporters. Proponents say the project would help
solve China's energy shortage, control flooding and make the upper
reaches of the river accessible to larger ships.
   A Canadian consortium of government and corporate experts
concluded after a two-year study that the project is feasible and
rejected many of the objections of the critics. However, the critics
noted that several companies in the consortium are potential bidders
for dam contracts.
   Tuesday's news conference was the first time a group of
intellectuals dared to band together and express their opposition
publicly.
   Ms. Dai said the debate had to brought out into the open.
   ``Ordinary people know that many large projects ... have a direct
impact on them individually,'' she said. ``If the project goes well
it is called government funded, but in reality everyone who pays
taxes pays for it out of his own pocket. Ordinary people cannot
afford not to hear all the viewpoints.''
   Li Rui, who was vice minister of hydroelectric power in the 1950s
and vice minister of water conservancy in the early 1980s, said
instead of building one massive dam, smaller dams should be built on
tributaries of the Yangtze.
   Wu Jing, a senior government engineer who came to listen, agreed.
   Wu said that across town several hundred government experts were
holding one of a series of meetings to discuss the latest official
feasibility study.
   ``We're having competing meetings,'' he chuckled.

<HEAD>U.S.: No Plans For Further Action on Fang Flap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy said Tuesday it had ``no specific
plan'' to remonstrate further after China rejected any criticism of
its treatment of a well-known dissident.
   ``Our position stands,'' said embassy spokesman Sheridan W. Bell
after the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it resented the United
States' inviting Fang Lizhi to a dinner given by President Bush.
   Chinese police stopped Fang en route to the dinner Sunday night
and refused to let him attend.
   ``We expressed our regret two times. We've made our position
clear,'' Bell said in an interview. ``I'm sure we will continue to
bring up the issue of human rights in appropriate forums in the
future as we have in the past.''
   Bush told Vice Premier Wu Xueqian as he left Beijing on Monday
that he regretted the police action against Fang. U.S. Ambassador
Winston Lord met later Monday with Vice Foreign Minister Zhu Qizhen
and repeated the message.
   Bell said Tuesday that ``to my knowledge'' the ministry had not
formally responded to the U.S. statements. However, late Monday the
ministry issued a statement via the official Xinhua News Agency
saying China resented the invitation to Fang and regretted that a
fuss was made over his absence.
   ``There is no specific plan'' for the embassy to make further
remonstrances, Bell said, adding: ``We have said many times that we
don't always see eye-to-eye on many issues.''
   He defended the embassy for not having anticipated the Chinese
anger and escorted Fang to the dinner.
   ``We were all surprised,'' he said. ``There were 250 Chinese
guests. We don't go out and pick up 250 people.''
   Fang, a 53-year-old astrophysicist, is China's best-known
dissident. He has criticized Marxism as a failure and said that
economic development is impossible without democracy and respect for
human rights.
   On Monday, Fang refused to criticize Bush for not having raised
human rights issues during his China visit. But he said he believes
the United States holds China to a lower human rights standard than
it does the Soviet Union, and said he hoped this would change.
   Other dissidents have called on the United States and other
foreign countries to stop investing in China until the Communist
Party ceases human rights abuses.

<TEXT>
   Bryant Gumbel grumbles about almost everybody he
works with on NBC's ``Today'' show in a confidential memo to the
show's producer, and says weatherman Willard Scott ``holds the show
hostage'' with his ``bad taste.''
   Gumbel, who never has been known for keeping his opinions to
himself, also says film critic Gene Shalit's reviews are ``often
late and his interviews aren't very good'' and that consumer
reporter David Horowitz is ``a walking cliche,'' according to the
memo reported Tuesday's editions of New York Newsday.
   In the memo, Gumbel complained that consumer reporter Betty
Furness' stories were often ``too local.'' He had some kind words
for medical correspondent Art Ulene, though his theme week reports
were ``boring'' to Gumbel. Music correspondent Rona Elliott reaped
none but Gumbel's praise.
   Scott was the target of Gumbel's strongest criticism.
   ``This guy is killing us and no one's even trying to rein him
in,'' Gumbel complained. He suggested ``nuking'' the assistant who
supplies Scott with viewers' birthdates. Scott spends part of the
weather segment wishing happy birthdays to those who reach 100.
   Scott ``holds the show hostage to his assortment of whims,
wishes, birthdays and bad taste,'' Gumbel writes.
   Gumbel was on vacation and couldn't be reached for comment.
   Scott declined to comment on the memo. Ulene said Gumbel is a
smart guy but doesn't understand the importance of, say, Cholesterol
Week to viewers. Horowitz said he stands on his record.
   Jane Pauley, Gumbel's co-host on the top-rated morning show,
escaped any comment in the memo, which was written last August when
Gumbel was still in negotiations on his new, three-year, $7 million
contract.
   Gumbel also griped in the memo to executive producer Marty Ryan
about Ryan's alleged ``lack of guidance and a lack of willingness to
stand on folks and make sure they do what's necessary.''
   Ryan told Newsday the memo was ``stolen'' out of a computer file
and that ``Bryant and I always have candid exchanges about the
show.'' On Tuesday, he declined to comment further.
   NBC News President Michael G. Gartner also declined to comment,
but sent an interoffice memo around last week supporting Ryan in the
job.
   Gartner will soon have to contend with more negative press. An
article in the latest issue of Manhattan Inc. magazine, due to hit
stands Thursday, criticizes Gartner's management of the news
division that he took over last July.

<TEXT>
   Whether lawyers may be forced to represent poor
people in non-criminal federal cases was the subject of a lively
debate in the Supreme Court on Tuesday.
   John A. Mallard, a lawyer from rural Iowa who specializes in
business cases, told the justices he did not feel qualified to
represent prison inmates in a civil rights suit assigned by a judge.
   ``In my estimation, I was not competent to provide the services
required,'' Mallard said.
   Justice John Paul Stevens said Mallard seemed perfectly capable
of representing himself before the nation's highest court even
though he had no experience there.
   ``You had the exact same experience'' in federal civil rights
cases, said Stevens. ``Is that it? You don't need the skills up
here, but you did down there?''
   Mallard said he believed ``the skills are very different ... to
elicit testimony before a jury'' or argue an appeal before the
Supreme Court, where there are no witnesses to question.
   Opposing Mallard was Deputy Attorney General Gordon Allen of
Iowa, who said Mallard has a responsibility as a lawyer to do his
share of ``pro bono'' work _ representing the poor without
compensation.
   ``Lawyers have an ethical obligation,'' Allen said, adding,
``When the court calls, I answer.''
   Mallard of Fairfield, Iowa, was ordered to represent two current
inmates and a former inmate at the Iowa state prison in Fort
Madison. The inmates said prison guards and officials had filed
false disciplinary reports against them, physically mistreated them
and endangered their lives by revealing they were informants.
   A federal judge picked Mallard in 1987 from a list of more than
100 lawyers compiled by the Legal Services Corp. of Iowa and that
state's bar association.
   In addition to saying he lacked experience in trial work, Mallard
said the federal courts do not have power to require an unwilling
attorney to represent someone in a civil case.
   The possible penalties Mallard faces for his refusal to take the
case were not discussed. But presumably he could be held in contempt
and be fined or jailed.
   Courts routinely assign lawyers to represent indigent defendants
in criminal cases and the lawyers are paid, at taxpayer expense,
generally a fraction of what they would receive normally.
   In civil rights cases, lawyers are paid expenses and may receive
a share of any damages won by their clients.
   U.S. District Judge Harold D. Vietor denied Mallard's motion to
be excused from the inmates' suit. The judge said Mallard was
competent and had litigation experience.
   Some justices expressed sympathy Tuesday for one of Mallard's key
points _ that the federal law authorizing legal help for poor people
in civil cases says a judge only may ``request'' any attorney to
take the case.
   Allen said a request is sometimes a demand, for example, when a
general in the Army issues it.
   ``Words have no meaning if we start talking like that,'' shot
back Justice Antonin Scalia.
   Scalia said a lieutenant who refuses a general's request may
forfeit the opportunity for promotion. But, the justice added, that
does not mean the lieutenant can be court-martialed for refusing.
   The court is expected to announce a decision in Mallard's appeal
by July. The case is Mallard vs. U.S. District Court, 87-1490.

the World Jewish Congress announced Tuesday.
   Permission for the new center, which will include a library and
offer Hebrew classes, was given after the opening of a Jewish
cultural center in Moscow.
   The two projects reflect the growing liberalization of Kremlin

   Tamils dressed in military uniforms
raided a village of Sinhalese rice paddy farmers and shot, stabbed
and hacked at least 37 people to death, survivors and officials said
Tuesday.
   At least 10 children and five women were among the victims of
Monday night's attack by the 20 militants in Welikande village in
the Polonnaruwa distict, about 100 miles northeast of Colombo.
   A military official in Colombo, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said soldiers patrolling the area discovered five bodies
Tuesday, raising the toll to 37.
   ``We have a total of 37 corpses: 22 males, five women and 10
children, most of them hacked to death. Some of the males had
gunshot injuries,'' the military official said. Under briefing
rules, he cannot be identified.
   Police who were contacted by telephone in Polonnaruwa town and
spoke on condition of anonimity blamed the attack on the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, but a Tiger leader telephoned The Associated
Press and denied his group was responsible.
   An official statement by the Tigers said, ``We condemn this as an
act of terrorism.''
   The Tigers are the most powerful of the Tamil separatist groups
that have been waging a bloody separatist war since 1983. The ethnic
struggle against the island nation's Sinhalese majority has claimed
more than 8,500 lives.
   The Welikande attack was the third massacre of Sinhalese
civilians in northeastern Sri Lanka this month. At least 80 people
were killed in the three attacks.
   On Feb. 11, 36 Sinhalese were shot and stabbed to death in
Dutuwewa. On Feb. 22, seven Sinhalese were killed at Sinhapura.
   The Tigers' information office in London denied the first two
attacks were the work of their people.
   Indian troops have been deployed in northeastern Sri Lanka since
July 1987 when Sri Lanka signed an agreement with India aimed at
ending the Tamil insurgency. Tamils were given a limited measure of
autonomy while Indian troops were deputed to disarm militants among
the Tamils.
   After initially agreeing to the accord, the Tigers reneged and
returned to opposing the Sinhalese-dominated government.
   Welikande is in predominantly Sinhalese North Central Province
near the border with Eastern Province, which has a mixed Sinhalese,
Tamil and Moslem population.
   A former militant Tamil leader-turned-legislator said the Tigers
were on ``a headline-hunting exercise.''
   The chief minister of the northeastern administrative council,
Varatharaja Perumal, said the Tigers had been ``badly mauled'' by
Indian troops and were ``showing off their fangs by killing innocent
Sinhalese.''
   Perumal earlier headed the Eelam People's Revolutionary
Liberation Front, a rebel militia and former ally of the Tigers. The
front surrendered its arms and contested provincial elections in an
effort to politically realise Tamil aspirations.
   Mostly Hindu Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people. Militants claim they are discriminated against in education,
employment and culture by the predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese, who
make up 75 percent of the country's population and control the
administration and military.

named or mentioned, they might withdraw from the package,'' said
Canon Leonard Moss.
   ``We are at a fairly delicate stage at the moment, but we did
want people to be aware that we are sufficiently confident to feel
we do not have to press ahead with the auction in June.''
   The cathedral had hoped to raise $4.4 million from the sale of
the map, which shows Jerusalem at the center of the world and
Hereford on the edge. Historical events, Bible stories, animals,
plans and 420 cities are shown on a sheet of vellum measuring 65
inches by 53 inches.
   The map, known by its Latin name ``Mappa Mundi,'' was drawn and
painted by Richard of Haldingham in 1275.
   Moss said the controversy had made the map so famous that it
could no longer be safely displayed in a dark corner of the
cathedral, and a separate building might be required.
   Emma Nicholson, a Conservative member of Parliament, said in
London that the news was ``a miracle among miracles.''
   ``I was appalled at the idea that a national treasure should be
auctioned at Sotheby's as if it was a cracked cup and saucer,'' Miss
Nicholson said. ``It is a pearl among pearls, beyond price.''
   Lord Gowrie, the chairman of Sotheby's and an adviser to the
cathedral, said he felt no regret at losing the sale.
   ``I am particularly happy that the conclusion which I personally
have always been striving for _ that the Mappa Mundi will remain in
Hereford _ has been achieved,'' he said.

<HEAD>Colorado's Second Oxygenated Fuels Program Ends</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colorado's four-month oxygenated fuels program to
cut carbon monoxide pollution ended Tuesday without having created
the stir that clouded the mandatory program's debut last year.
   ``There just wasn't the attention on it this year since everybody
had gone through it once,'' said Ted Hollman, senior air pollution
control specialist for the state health department.
   ``Once people found out all the doomsday predictions didn't come
true, they stopped thinking about it,'' he said.
   Mechanics in the Denver area reported few problems as a result of
the oxygenated fuels, although older cars had more trouble than
newer ones.
   As for suppliers, John Augustine of Conoco said the program ``was
much smoother this year because we had a lot of lead time. ... We
had the whole year to know it's coming and get the tanks and
everything ready.''
   Conoco even plans to continue offering an ethanol-blended
gasoline after the program ends ``and see how the sales go,''
Augustine said.
   State Rep. Tom Ratterree, a critic of the program mainly because
it is mandatory, said he still believes the fuels are creating
problems in people's cars and motorists simply aren't aware of the
cause.
   ``The car may not run but they don't know why,'' Ratterree said.
``If I were to generate an awareness level out there, then people
would come out of the woodwork again.''
   The program was in effect along Colorado's Front Range from Fort
Collins and Greeley in the north to Colorado Springs in the south,
including the Denver area.
   The oxygenated fuels are actually blends of ordinary gasoline and
either grain alcohol (ethanol) or the ether-based MTBE. Nearly 2
million cars and trucks ran on the fuels every day, Hollman said.
   At Denver's mile-high altitude, ordinary fuel burns incompletely
in engines, and the unexpended fuel emitted into the air adds to
pollution, especially during winter months when temperature
inversions trap the smog. High-oxygen fuels burn more cleanly.
   Last year, the oxygenated fuels program ran just two months and
cut carbon monoxide emissions an average 9.5 percent, officials said.
   This year, the goal was 12 percent. The amount of oxygen required
in the fuels was increased from 1.5 percent to 2 percent, resulting
in the use of more ethanol, Hollman said.
   Preliminary results of the oxygenated fuels program and the
three-month Better Air Campaign, which ended in January and included
voluntary no-drive days and voluntary and mandatory woodburning
bans, were expected later this week.
   The combined programs last year dropped Denver from first to
seventh place on the Environmental Protection Agency's list of worst
cities for carbon monoxide pollution.
   The Rocky Mountain Oil and Gas Association, a trade association
for the industry, opposes the program's mandatory provisions and
disputes its environmental benefits.
   ``As far as consumer satisfaction, consumers are relatively
satisfied because there has been a choice of oxygenated fuels,''
said special projects director Pam Oldham.

Tuesday.
   The stamp honoring the former New York Yankees hitter will be
issued June 10 at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
   Gehrig played a record 2,130 consecutive games, batting cleanup

<HEAD>Governors Talk `Fiscal Insanity,' Government Responsibility</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal budget deficits were decried Tuesday as
``fiscal insanity'' as the nation's governors wound up a meeting
marked by grudging acceptance of a steady drop in federal aid to the
states.
   ``A fundamental shift has taken place in American government,''
Gov. Gerald Baliles of Virginia, chairman of the National Governors'
Association, told a news conference at the end of the group's annual
midwinter meeting.
   The Democrat said that ``a large measure of the responsibility
for governing this country has shifted from Washington down to the
states.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, told the closing
session of the conference that the budget crisis was ``so critical''
the Democratic Congress and the Republican president had to ``summon
the resolve'' to come up with a plan together to reduce the deficit.
   Mitchell was responding to Democratic Gov. Cecil Andrus of Idaho
who referred to ``the fiscal insanity that presently prevails in
this city'' and who asked, ``Does the Congress have the will this
year to return us to some form of fiscal sanity.''
   ``It cannot be done alone by the Congress,'' replied Mitchell. He
said any progress would require the cooperation of the
administration.
   The Maine senator described the budget as ``a statement of our
nation's priorities,'' and he pointed out to the governors that they
had approved policy statements ``that call for increased federal
spending in a large number of areas.''
   At the same time, he said, the governors' association also had a
policy position ``which calls for meaningful deficit reduction.''
   Mitchell said he had attended a breakfast meeting with President
Bush and that they ``reaffirmed this morning our commitment to a
cooperative effort on the budget and other areas.''
   The governors put off until their summer meeting action on an
updated position on the the budget deficit.
   ``There are such a lot of unanswered questions about the details
of the president's budget, it's easy to understand why the governors
are not yet ready to adopt a budget policy position,'' Baliles said.
   He said the governors had supported past congressional efforts to
reduce the deficit and ``we will support Congress this year.''
   Among the policy positions adopted by the governors were:
   _ Endorsement of self-determination for Puerto Rico;
   _ Support of legislation to require uniform poll closing times
throughout the continental United States;
   _Tougher emissions standards for automobiles and reauthorization
of the Clean Air Act;
   _ Appropriation of $2.4 billion in federal assistance to the
states for construction of wastewater treatment plants. The proposed
federal budget would appropriate only half that amount.

<TEXT>
   The owner of a defunct roller skating rink says a
city law setting age limits at teen dance halls ruined his business.
He sued, and now the U.S. Supreme Court is reviewing the issue as a
freedom of association case.
   ``The court has never really squarely faced the issue of an
individual's right to associate for a purely social or cultural
purpose,'' said Daniel Sheehan, an attorney for rink owner Michael
Stanglin.
   Craig Hopkins, the assistant city attorney handling the case,
said he believes the justices want to go on record stating that
freedom of association in social settings is not covered by the
Constitution, a ruling that could effect civil rights as well as
protecting the recreational gathering places restricted to
teen-agers that have sprung up around the country.
   The Supreme Court is to hear the case Wednesday.
   Stanglin's Twilight Skating Rink fell under the dance hall law
because its floor, divided with traffic cones, had skating and
dancing sections. A city ordinance enacted in 1985 allows only
youngsters ages 14 to 18 and their parents or guardians in dance
halls that serve teen-agers.
   ``I think the city was well-intentioned with this, but they just
went over the line,'' Stanglin said. He contends the ordinance
unfairly singles out dancing establishments, while other gathering
places, such as parks or ice cream parlors, allow people of any age
to associate.
   ``That means that a 19-year-old guy cannot come in with his
18-year-old girlfriend,'' he said. ``If you had a 13-year-old in
there, you're in violation.''
   When he began complying with the ordinance, Stanglin said, his
crowd dropped from 800 one week to about 200 the next, then less
than 20 the third week.
   ``It has cost me a considerable amount of financial tragedy,''
said Stanglin, who closed the Twilight in 1986 but owns a second
rink in a Dallas suburb.
   Stanglin sued the city in July 1986, and a trial court ruled
against him.
   In October 1987, a state Court of Appeals ruled in Stanglin's
favor, striking down the part of the ordinance dealing with age. The
court said it interfered with young people's constitutional right to
associate with whom they please.
   ``It is primarily the responsibility of the parent, not the city,
to tell the minor how old his dance partner may be,'' the appeals
court said. ``The answer lies in supervision, not in strict
segregation by age group.''
   The Texas Supreme Court declined to hear the case.
   The city's request that the U.S. Supreme Court reinstate the
ordinance said, ``The potential harm comes from the association with
persons who may influence the behavior of the children not only at
the dance hall where supervision exists but also away from the dance
hall.''
   Hopkins said the ordinance does not limit freedom of association.
If anything, it expands it by creating a special category of dance
halls where teen-agers are allowed, he said.
   The Supreme Court already has defined freedom of association in
political and sex discrimination cases. In the 1950s the justices
upheld the right of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People to withhold its membership list from Alabama
authorities.
   In 1984, the Supreme Court ruled that the Jaycees could not
exclude women. The court has ruled that civic groups and private
clubs may only exclude people by sex or religion when it is
essential to the organization's purposes.

<HEAD>Deficit Grows 10 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit worsened in the final
three months of the year, climbing to $32 billion, as both U.S.
exports and imports hit record levels, the government reported
Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said the deficit from October through
December swelled by 10 percent from a third quarter deficit of
$29.17 billion.
   The trade deficit had shown steady improvement through the first
three quarters of 1988, helping to push the deficit for the entire
year down to $126.5 billion, 21.7 percent below the all-time high of
$160.28 billion set in 1987.
   While economists were pleased with the big improvement for the
year, they expressed fears that the improvement has now stalled and
will hold back overall economic growth in 1989.
   ``The trade deficit has stopped improving,'' said David Wyss, an
economist with Data Resources Inc., of Lexington, Mass. ``We made
some big gains in exports in 1987 and 1988 but they haven't been
enough to balance our big appetite for imports.''
   Tuesday's trade figures confirmed an improvement already noted in
the Commerce Department's monthly merchandise trade reports. Those
figures showed the deficit declining to $137.34 billion in 1988,
down from $170.3 billion in 1987.
   The new report, which measures trade on a balance-of-payments
basis, has smaller figures because it subtracts shipping costs and
military sales from the monthly numbers.
   Another measure of trade, contained in the report on the gross
national product released Tuesday, also showed a worsening in the
deficit for the fourth quarter of 1988. Unlike the other trade
figures, the GNP report removes the effects of inflation from the
import and export numbers.
   The report on merchandise trade on a balance-of-payments basis
showed that exports rose $2 billion to a record level of $83.6
billion in the fourth quarter while imports climbed $4.8 billion to
a record $115.7 billion.
   The trade deficit with Japan also set a record, rising by $3.2
billion to $15.5 billion in the fourth quarter.
   The largest increase in imports came in autos, up $1.8 billion,
reflecting higher shipments from South Korea, Japan and Mexico.
Imports of consumer goods, including apparel and household goods,
rose by $1.6 billion.
   On the export side, shipments of manufactured goods rose 4
percent while farm shipments fell by 6 percent.
   For the year, the decline in the deficit to $126.5 billion
reflected a 28 percent surge in export sales and a 9 percent rise in
imports.
   But Wyss said he expected little further improvement in 1989,
saying the trade performance will not move off current high levels
until the dollar weakens further, making imports even more expensive
and U.S. goods more competitive on overseas markets.
   Non-farm exports rose 28 percent to $61.6 billion in 1988, with
the largest increases in sales of U.S. capital equipment and
industrial supplies.
   Agricultural exports shot up 30 percent to $38.3 billion, their
highest level since 1984.
   The largest increases were in sales of corn, which were up $1.9
billion, reflecting higher sales to the Soviet Union, Japan and
Taiwan; and in wheat, which also climbed by $1.9 billion, reflecting
higher shipments to China and the Soviet Union.
   The farm sales increase reflected in part higher prices caused by
the severe drought. The average price of corn was up 38 percent for
the year, while the price of soybeans rose by 33 percent, wheat
prices were up 20 percent and cotton prices rose 20 percent.

<HEAD>United States, Cuba Clash Over Human Rights Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Cuba clashed Tuesday over the
first U.N. report on alleged human rights abuse under Havana's
communist government, with each side claiming the report backed its
stand.
   Cuba's deputy foreign minister, Raoul Roa Kouri, said the report
``categorically denies'' U.S. charges that Cuban authorities torture
and execute opponents and imprison thousands of political prisoners.
   Ambassador Armando Valladares, the chief U.S. delegate and a
former Cuban political prisoner, said the report ``indicates that
civil, political, economic, and social rights are violated in Cuba
every day, in a systematic manner, almost without exception.''
   The exchange over the 400-page report came during a debate before
the United Nations Human Rights Commission. The document was
compiled by a six-member U.N. delegation, which visited Cuba last
year in response to pressure by the United States to investigate
alleged human rights abuse in that country.
   The report, which was released Friday, included an extensive list
of alleged human rights violations along with denials by Havana. It
also included official statistics on improvement in education and
health care since that country's 1959 Marxist revolution.
   The delegation, which was led by Alioune Sene, Senegal's
ambassador to the United Nations, and included diplomats from all
major regions, made no assessments or recommendations in the report.
   It did, however, include questions on constitutional and legal
matters the group said had not been answered by Cuba.
   The United States and several Western countries urged the group's
mandate should be extended by the commission.
   President Bush said Monday the report should begin a ``long-term
effort to bring about true and lasting changes in the Cuban
government's performance on human rights.''
   Several Western speakers, including Britain, West Germany,
Belgium, Portugal and Spain, voiced concern at the Cuban human
rights situation. Spain's Mercedes Rico said while there was ``no
pattern of massive, flagrant and systematic violation of human
rights,'' restrictions of fundamental freedoms were ``alarming.''
   But several Third World and communist countries made plain they
were opposed to a new mandate for the group. Cuba has said that it
will not accept further scrutiny.
   Roa Kouri said Cuba restricted civil rights to protect itself
against ``U.S. aggression.'' He said the mission's visit to Cuba in
September followed a stepped up U.S. ``psychological warfare'' after
years of ``very limited results in efforts to destabilize and defeat
the revolution.''
   Mexico's chief delegate Claude Heller said any assessment of the
Cuban situation should take into account the ``particular
conditions'' confronting the country since the revolution, including
``even death threats against its leaders.''

<HEAD>Experts' Advice on Tower's Pledge: Believe it When You See it</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary-designate John Tower says
he'll stop drinking if the Senate confirms him to the Cabinet, but
experts on alcohol abuse say: Believe it when you see it.
   Professionals who deal daily with drinkers' rationalizations say
vows of sobriety are easily made, but rarely kept.
   ``I'm sure he intends every word that he says. The question is,
can he do it?'' said Marc Hertzman, professor of psychiatry and
behavioral sciences at George Washington University. ``I think the
Senate would be ill-advised to draw conclusions from that vow.''
   Tower, whose nomination comes before the Senate this week, has
admitted to heavy drinking in the past. But in an extraordinary
television interview on Sunday, he said he drinks less now and he
vowed not to drink ``beverage alcohol of any type or form, including
wine, beer or spirits of any kind'' if he is confirmed to the
Cabinet position.
   Hertzman denounces the idea that the urge to drink can be
controlled so easily.
   ``Let's assume that only a very small part of what has been
rumored about the gentleman has any validity to it at all,'' said
Hertzman. ``The notion that he could just stop is about 180 degrees
counter to anything that anybody knows about the problem of dealing
with drinking alcohol.''
   He said that in some cases, six months of total abstinence would
be convincing, but with other people it could take two years or
more, or even be a struggle that lasts a lifetime.
   ``If I were a senator, I think at the very least I would defer
his confirmation until he proves that he can go six months,'' said
the psychiatrist. ``That's a minimum figure to establish that you
don't need it. A year and a half is more like it.''
   Dr. William E. Flynn, director of the alcohol and drug abuse
clinic at Georgetown University, said that Tower's sobriety vow
alone is not persuasive to professionals in the alcohol treatment
field.
   He said if senators have to base their confirmation decision on
Tower's drinking history, ``it would be a tough one.''
   ``What a corporation would do (for an executive in a similar
situation) is decide that there must be an evaluation. But that's
not possible here,'' said Flynn. ``One would feel a lot more
comfortable if you get an evaluation and a clean bill of health.''
   Tower did release a letter from Dr. Warren Lichtliter, a Dallas
physician who examined the former senator recently in connection
with a surgical procedure. Lichtliter said Tower had a normal liver
function and showed no evidence of alcohol withdrawal.
   ``Based on these facts, it can be stated with relative certainty
that Senator Tower shows no evidence at all of alcoholic impairment
or alcoholism,'' the Texas doctor wrote. ``It is my professional
view that there is little basis for statements made concerning the
possible impairment by alcohol of his ability to perform his duty as
secretary of defense.''
   Hertzman scoffs at that reasoning.
   ``That's baloney, pure and simple,'' he said. The statement, he
said, ``doesn't tell us everything we need to know in order to
answer the questions that are relevant.''
   Flynn agrees, saying, ``The question is, would it be possible to
present these findings (from Lichtliter) and there still be an
alcohol problem? The answer is yes.''
   Tower said that he once drank scotch heavily, but gave it up 12
years ago and ``essentially has been a wine drinker'' only at meals
since then.
   ``All that tells me is that someone shifted their alcohol intake
from one form to another,'' said Flynn.
   ``A glass of wine is roughly equivalent in alcohol content to a
jigger of scotch,'' said Hertzman. ``Everything we know about
alcohol abuse suggests that it doesn't matter in what form you get
the alcohol. What matters is how much alcohol you get.''

<HEAD>Party Leader Warns That Reforms Cannot Derail Communism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski has
issued a strong warning that he won't let introduction of greater
freedoms threaten the country's communist system.
   Jaruzelski, emphasizing that he was addressing army officers,
decried ``noisy, confrontational and anarchy-prone pluralism leading
nowhere,'' according to excerpts of a speech Monday to the Communist
Party organization for the Pomerania army district. The excerpts
were published Tuesday.
   Jaruzelski spoke the same day Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F.
Rakowski apologized to the Soviet ambassador to Poland for student
demonstrations over the weekend in which officials say students
desecrated a monument to Soviet soldiers.
   Authorities have been cautiously introducing increased openness
and freedom in recent weeks, but appear anxious about the
possibility that the liberalization could lead to chaotic strikes or
demonstrations that could get out of control.
   ``A question appears here about safeguards so that we will not be
pushed off the road of socialism. That is out of the question,''
Jaruzelski said in the speech to army officers in the northwest city
of Bydgoszcz, according to the official PAP news agency.
   ``Whoever has such an intention, let him put it out of his head.
The fact that I state this at just this place, at just this time,
also will be a warning,'' he said.
   Jaruzelski, who imposed 1{ years of martial law in Poland
beginning Dec. 13, 1981, said the return of social stability has
made possible the current talks between the government and the
opposition.
   But he said questions were emerging, ``whether the 13th of
December 1981 and all of our joint, tremendous effort to save Poland
will be threatened and lost by the developing situation. This is a
justified question.''
   Since a January decision by the Communist Party to permit trade
union pluralism, which cleared the way for the talks on making legal
again the banned trade union Solidarity, Polish reforms have entered
a ``profoundly expanded'' phase, he said.
   The talks with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and other opposition
leaders began Feb. 6.
   Now, ex-political prisoners routinely sit at negotiating tables
across from representatives of the authorities who put them in jail,
underground press reporters question government ministers at news
conferences, and the once-forbidden Solidarity emblem is seen in
public places.
   The openness has also been accompanied by dozens of small strikes
and frequent demonstrations by students and other groups.
   ``There can be an enlightened pluralism, creative, constructive
and mobilizing national energy,'' Jaruzelski said. ``But there can
also be a noisy confrontational and anarchy-prone pluralism leading
nowhere.
   ``We intend to expand and consolidate the first one, but we
should and we will condemn and fight the latter.''
   The party leader, who is also commander-in-chief of the army,
said Poland is threatened by ``a strike-and-protest `festival''' and
by ``attempts at creating anarchy in social life.''
   Apparently referring to recent student protests in Krakow,
Jaruzelski said, ``I have always been and I still am an advocate of
reacting with patience and understanding to the emotions of young
people. However there are certain limits and they must not be
exceeded.''
   He said the police and education ministries should ``draw
appropriate conclusions.''
   Jaruzelski criticized as ``cowardly'' some previously silent
critics who are taking advantage of the new liberalized atmosphere
to attack authorities verbally.
   ``Some blows the party has been suffering are below the belt,''
he said. ``Some methods, be it publications, statements or
declarations, closely resemble what we had in 1981 (before martial
law) when the `rats' hurriedly abandoned ship.
   ``That ship, socialist Poland, has been unsinkable and so it will
stay.''

<TEXT>
   A drug smuggler who escaped from prison
has been arrested after a gunfight with security forces in
northeastern Iran, it was reported Monday.
   Safar Barahoui was wounded several days ago in a clash with
agents of Iran's revolutionary committee, the country's main law
enforcement agency, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   He had been captured in a major crackdown on drug smugglers, but
broke out of prison.
   The news agency quoted an unnamed official as saying the agents
seized 220 pounds of heroin in the raid, the latest swoop in a
nationwide anti-narcotics campaign. Since mid-January, 175 drug
traffickers have been convicted by Islamic courts and executed.
   The official said committee forces had seized 2,420 pounds of
TNT, apparently intended for use in terrorist attacks, from members
of Barahoui's gang.
   IRNA said that in recent days, committee agents have also seized
165 pounds of narcotics from 10 drug smugglers in provincial cities
and arrested 715 drug addicts.
   Tehran radio, also monitored in Nicosia, reported in February
that 1,750 addicts were rounded up in Iran's western provinces in a
24-hour period.
   It said that 7,358 addicts had been registered since a Jan. 21
anti-narcotics law that carries the death sentence for anyone found
with small quantities of narcotics went into effect.
   Iran's official media has estimated there are 1 million drug
addicts in Iran, which has a population of 50 million. Unofficial
estimates put the figure at twice that.

<HEAD>Boston Desegregation Fight Could Head Back To Court</HEAD>

   Fifteen years after the fierce battle began to
desegregate its schools, Boston appears to be back at square one
with school board members split along racial lines over plans to
improve integration.
   Civil rights leaders said Tuesday they're ready to go back to
court unless changes are made in a plan that would end court-ordered
busing by allowing parents to shop around for a school of their
choice.
   ``It's a back door into segregation, an old tired rusty car with
a new coat of paint,'' said Louis Elisa, president of the Boston
branch of the NAACP. ``If there isn't substantial change in this
process, (which is a) resegregation of the public schools, the NAACP
does not feel compelled to sit on the sidelines and let that
happen.''
   Supporters of the school assignment plan say the competition
would spur improvements, lure back whites to the system they fled
during busing, and cut long bus rides.
   Opponents say the plan could open the door to a further exodus of
white students, and that it could not work without more money to
improve the overall system.
   Monday night, the nine white members of the School Committee
voted for the plan. The four black members voted against it.
   Ellen Guiney, education adviser to Mayor Raymond Flynn, who is
supporting the plan, said city officials hope to work out an
agreement with the plan's foes, but are confident the assignment
plan will withstand any legal challenge.
   Under the assignment plan, the city would be divided into three
geographical zones and parents would be allowed to choose within the
zones, provided it did not upset racial balance and there is space.
The plan is scheduled to be implemented this fall for students in
kindergarten through grade 6. Other grades would be assigned in
September 1990.
   Thomas Atkins, an attorney who represented black parents in a
1972 suit demanding that Boston schools desegregate, said he's not
surprised that the city still hasn't laid the desegregation issue to
rest.
   ``Boston and the school committee has never been without those
whose most fervent desire was to return the system to the mode it
had before the federal court intervened,'' he said.
   Busing was imposed in Boston in 1974 by order of U.S. District
Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr., triggering rock-throwing violence and
white flight. Boston schools went from a 1972 population of 96,000
students, 60 percent of them white, to the current 59,000 students,
24 percent of them white.
   The system is plagued by a perennial budget crunch and a 40
percent high school dropout rate.
   Its poor academic reputation is well known. Boston University
basketball coach Mike Jarvis, for example, said recently that some
college recruiters told him they don't recruit players from Boston
because they feel they are a poor bet to keep up academically in
college.
   Guiney acknowledged that the school system is in trouble, but
said the assignment plan has at least focused attention on its
problems.
   ``We do know that the education in the Boston schools now is
generally unsatisfactory to everybody,'' she said. ``The problems
are serious. There is consensus that it's a system very nearly in
crisis.''
   Garrity returned some control of the system to the School
Committee in 1985. In 1987, a federal appeals court ruled that
Boston was complying with desegregation orders.
   Despite the continuing legal battle, Atkins said there has been
progress during the past 15 years, with desegregated schools and
more minority faculty members systemwide.
   He said the assignment plan prevents students from transferring
to a new school if that would upset the racial balance, but it does
not address the effect a student's departure would have on the first
school. He said in trying to balance Boston's schools, any risk of
imbalance cannot be taken.
   ``It's like a rubber band. So long as you keep it stretched
between your two hands it maintains its shape, but as soon as you
let go it snaps back,'' he said.

<HEAD>Senate Subcommittee Members Shy Away from Chairman's Proposed Trip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most members of a Senate panel are shying away
from a six-nation foreign trip that their chairman says is not a
junket but will combine work with visits to ``museums, art
galleries, and religious and historical sites.''
   In a letter dated Feb. 7, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, new
chairman of the Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee, invited
17 colleagues to join him on a trip to Germany, Italy, Turkey,
Egypt, Israel and Spain.
   ``Far from being a `congressional junket,' this trip will take us
to areas which I believe we need to visit to understand the
dimensions of the problems confronting U.S. national security and to
meet the responsibilities we face as members of the subcommittee on
defense,'' Inouye wrote. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the
letter.
   The trip is scheduled during the Senate's Easter vacation in the
last two weeks of March.
   ``I also intend to make a special effort to allow time for visits
to museums, art galleries, and religious and historical sites in the
capitals and the countryside of these countries,'' Inouye wrote.
   Such broad tours are crucial to understanding the ``shared
values'' which link the United States to its friends and allies, the
senator said.
   The itinerary calls for three nights in Munich, three in Rome,
two in Istanbul, three in Cairo, three in Jerusalem and one in
Madrid.
   The route was designed to allow members to see ```fracture
zones'' of the geopolitical world, said Inouye, whose subcommittee
oversees spending for the Defense Department and the CIA.
   Along the way, the senators would share Easter services with
American forces aboard a ship in the Persian Gulf and review
fundamental changes under way in the Middle East peace process.
   Inouye urged the senators to bring along their wives because of
``certain responsibilities in the areas of protocol and diplomacy''
associated with meetings with heads of state and high-level
officials abroad.
   Congressional spouses travel free with their mates on military
aircraft, but they must pay their own expenses. The government picks
up all expenses for members of Congress. They receive daily per diem
at the same rate as U.S. diplomats abroad. For example, the daily
rate is $163 in Munich and $98 in Cairo.
   The congressional party will fly on an Air Force jet ``to ensure
that we accomplish the objectives of our trip and to add a measure
of security,'' Inouye said.
   So far, only Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., has accepted Inouye's
invitation, according to an informal head count. ``He's new on the
committee and he wants to see all the installations,'' said his
spokesman, Steven Schlein.
   Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.; Bennett Johnston, D-La.; and Jake
Garn, R-Utah, are undecided about whether to go.
   At least 13 subcommittee members said they have no plans to go,
most of them citing prior commitments and more pressing business at
home.
   But Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., isn't going in part because he
doesn't like being in a ``large delegation. ... He tends to prefer
trips that are more focused,'' said his spokesman, Paul Jacobson.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said he didn't have problems with the
trip, but wasn't planning to go because ``I took those trips when I
was the chairman'' of the subcommittee. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
declined because he recently returned from the Middle East, an aide
said.
   A State Department official familiar with the trip, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said arrangements, such as the exact dates,
are not yet firm.
   In the Senate, foreign trips on behalf of a committee must be
approved full committee chairman, while those on behalf of the full
Senate must have the approval of the chamber's majority and minority
leaders.
   Inouye has yet to formally request the approval of Sen. Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the appropriations committee, according
to Marsha Berry, the committee spokeswoman.
   Byrd, also a member of the defense panel, will not accompany
Inouye. ``He plans to travel to West Virginia; that's the only
traveling he'll do in March,'' said Tina Evans, a spokeswoman.
   These senators have other plans for the recess, according to the
members or their aides: Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.; Jim Sasser,
D-Tenn.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.; Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa; James McClure, R-Idaho; Bob Kasten, R-Wis.; Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Thad Cochran, R-Miss.

<HEAD>Public TV Station Plans Service To Make Television Vivid For The
Blind</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A public television station that pioneered closed
captions for the hearing impaired has developed a new service that
makes television vivid for the blind.
   By tuning a special channel on a stereo television or home video
recorder, the service allows blind people to hear a narrator
describe the action in a program between pauses in dialogue.
   Boston's public station, WGBH, tested the service last year and
is now seeking funding to make it available to the nation's
estimated 12 million visually impaired people in January 1990.
   ``I never realized when I watched television, from a listening
perspective, that I was missing so much,'' Kim Charlson recalled
Tuesday. Blind since the age of 11, the 31-year-old Watertown
resident was among thousands of visually impaired people across the
country who tuned in last year to the service's trial run.
   Television ``is a major means of communiciation in society,''
Mrs. Charlson said. ``There's so much on television, you tend to
feel left out when you can't access it. I really commend them that
they're trying to do it, and do it right.''
   The new development, called Descriptive Video Services, allows
people with visual impairment _ or even sighted people stepping away
from their television set _ to follow the action. All they need is a
stereo television set or VCR that can be tuned to the Separate Audio
Program channel _ or SAP. During a musical interlude or breaks in
dialogue, a narrator is heard above the background music.
   WGBH enlisted nine other public TV stations to test the service
from January to July 1988 on the PBS ``American Playhouse'' drama
series. Stations participated in Washington, D.C.; metropolitan New
York City and Rochester in New York; Cleveland and Bowling Green,
Ohio; Milwaukee; Dallas; Pensacola, Fla.; and Lewiston, Maine.
   A viewer tuned to the play ``Lemon Sky,'' for example, could hear
as the credits rolled: ``A mountain silhouette in the distance, palm
trees closer. A boy's bike between a high, brown wooden fence. In
the foreground a white, mid-50s convertible gleaming in the sun, its
top down.''
   Then later, after a character spoke his lines: ``He strolls away
from the car toward the house, pausing in the doorway.''
   ``I see it as something that can become widely popular and should
be,'' said John De Witt, who evaluates high-tech aides for the blind
at the American Federation for the Blind in New York.
   ``It's not a question only of people who are totally blind,'' De
Witt said in a telephone interview. ``There are millions of people
who have very poor vision and cannot see small details on the
screen, people who are losing their vision at any time of life.''
   Credit for the idea is given to Margaret Pfanstiehl, founder of
Metropolitan Washington Ear, a radio reading service based in Silver
Spring, Md. Ms. Pfanstiehl found a way for theaters to offer
narration for blind people with audio headsets.
   It became accessible for television through stereo TV and VCRs
after establishment of the Separate Audio Program channel about five
years ago. About 10 percent of American homes can tap the audio
channel now. But Laurie Everett, director of Descriptive Video
Services predicted they will be commonplace before the turn of the
century.
   ``In a couple of years you won't be able to buy a television that
isn't stereo,'' she said.
   WGBH is trying to raise funds to launch the service nationally
five hours a week, Ms. Everett said, needing $300,000 to start up
and another $1 million annually.
   It was 15 years ago that WGBH pioneered closed captioning for the
deaf. With a decoding device, viewers can see subtitles across the
screen. Captioning is now available on 65 percent of all prime time
TV. It's used widely by publicly funded TV as well as on commercial,
cable and videotaped films.

   The stakes are substantial for President Bush
in the John Tower confirmation struggle, but lawmakers say a defeat
in his first major political battle may have no major lasting effect
on his ability to deal effectively with the Democratic majorities in
Congress.
   A victory would be an unquestioned personal achievement for the
president, particularly after his decision to take command of the
lobbying battle at a time when Tower's chances of confirmation as
defense secretary were in jeopardy.
   ``The president isn't going to rise or fall on the issue,'' said
Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., who is undecided on the Tower
nomination.
   ``I don't think it sets the stage for the next four years,''
agreed Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who is leaning against confirmation.
   ``You can read more into it'' than is warranted, agreed Sen.
Richard Shelby, D-Ala., a conservative southerner opposed to Tower.
He said if the nomination fails, Bush would ``take a solid lick. But
it is early in the presidency. It depends on how resilient he is.''
   That is not to say the struggle over Tower is without cost,
particularly since it has become a partisan struggle with most
Democrats opposed and most Republicans in support.
   Bush is faced with two equally unpleasant alternatives if it
becomes clear that Tower is not going to be confirmed, either to
withdraw the nomination without a vote or to go down fighting.
Either way, he comes out a loser.
   The administration has been functioning without a defense
secretary for a month. It will be weeks more until one can take
office if Tower is rejected.
   For their parts, Senate Democrats are wary of the possible costs
to themselves of sinking Tower's nomination. They had hoped to avoid
a showdown with the new president until a later date, and Democrat
after Democrat was eager to point out to reporters on Tuesday that
Bush's other Cabinet appointees have all been confirmed without a
single negative vote.
   One senior Democratic senator, speaking anonymously, said
Majority Leader George Mitchell and Armed Services Committee
Chairman Sam Nunn, were ``worried about the appearance of
partisanship'' in dealing with a newly elected president.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee has devoted practically all
of its time to the nomination, with hearings on defense strategy,
spending, procurement reform, and other matters been pushed aside.
   Nunn, D-Ga., who has spent years nurturing an image as a
bipartisan leader of the Senate on defense issues, has found himself
squarely in the middle of an issue that has become polarized almost
entirely along party lines.
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, says he has ``not seen passions
inflamed over an issue such as this one'' in several years, and says
it will hinder chances of formulating bipartisan defense and foreign
policy.
   Democrats and some Republicans whisper that Jimmy Carter was
ill-advised to withdraw Ted Sorenson's nomination as CIA director in
1977 in the face of Senate opposition _ and believe Bush would be
wiser to stand and fight than to cut his losses and signal Tower to
withdraw.
   But there are other senators who have publicly or privately
suggested that Bush withdraw the nomination _ a move that would
spare them the need to make an extremely tough decision on how to
vote.
   The effect on Bush's ability to deal effectively on other issues
isn't as easy to calculate.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., said, ``I think the president is
upping the stake substantially. I think if Tower is defeated it is
going to diminish his prestige here in Congress.''
   But Sasser, who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and
thus most likely to become the senator leading the Democrats into
battle with Bush, says budget concerns ``are independent of Tower.
   ``I think the administration can recover from the Tower problem
if the nomination is defeated but I think the real question is
whether the Tower problem is symptomatic of the failure of the
administration to get its program and its policies in a coherent and
convincing way.''

<HEAD>Greenspan Says Deficit Cut Would Bring Lower Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Tuesday that President Bush's proposed 1990 budget, if adopted,
would trigger lower interest rates even if it eventually produced a
deficit higher than $100 billion.
   Greenspan told the Senate Budget Committee that Bush has proposed
significant deficit reduction, but he also said the chance of
bringing the deficit under the congressional target of $100 billion
by the end of fiscal 1990 ``is really quite small.''
   ``I may say I would like to see Gramm-Rudman-Hollings targets met
literally (but) I don't think that is required to bring a
significant reduction in interest rates,'' he said.
   ``If, after the fact, the real number is $110 billion or $120
billion, in that vein, I would think that would be a major
improvement which the markets would take very positively,'' the
Federal Reserve chairman said.
   In his first congressional appearance since the central bank on
Friday escalated its fight against inflation by raising its key bank
lending rate, Greenspan said the Federal Reserve is trying to slow
economic growth to a pace sustainable without increased inflation.
   He told the senators they could help ease strains in the economy
and trigger lower interest rates with a credible plan to cut the
deficit from its 1989 level of about $165 billion. However, he
warned against resorting to accounting tricks that reduce the 1990
deficit without the prospect for further substantial cuts.
   ``What cannot have a positive effect is finding some set of
bookkeeping gimmicks which largely meet Gramm-Rudman for fiscal 1990
and then paper over `91, `92, `93,'' he said.
   Democratic members of the committee tried several times to prod
Greenspan into criticizing the ecnomic assumptions underlying the
Bush budget, which forecasts sharply lower interest rates and brisk
economic growth.
   Greenspan said he would have been more cautious in his
projections, but also said the differences between the Federal
Reserve and administration were ``within the range of forecasting
error.''
   His response drew a rebuke from Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., who
told him, ``You lose your credibility by the platitudes of that Bush
budget really doing anything to the deficit. It's a sham.''
   Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told the House
Budget Committee that both the administration and the Federal
Reserve have a firm commitment to fighting inflation.
   ``If there's a difference ... it's two people looking at the same
statistic and coming to a slightly different conclusion,'' Brady
said, in an attempt to soften previous criticism of the central bank.
   ``I am already convinced that interest rates will come down''
once Congress and the administration agree on a deficit-reduction
package, Brady said. In turn, he added, such an agreement would
allow the economic assumptions on which Bush's budget are based to
be met.
   At the Senate Appropriations Committee, White House budget
director Richard Darman came under fire from Democrats angry with
Bush for failing to specify the spending levels he would like to see
for hundreds of programs.
   The focus of the criticism was the more than 1,000 mostly
domestic programs that Bush has proposed limiting to $136 billion in
spending next year, the same amount as this year. Democrats have
complained that Bush has not revealed how he would accomplish this
freeze.
   ``It makes me wonder if the administration is leading us into the
age of Joe Isuzu federal budgeting,'' said committee chairman Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va., referring to the transparent liar portrayed in a
series of television commercials.
   Darman said that except for areas in which Bush had advanced
specific initiatives, the administration's starting point in budget
negotiations with Congress would be support of the proposals made by
former President Reagan.
   He also said the administration has given Congress hundreds of
pages of explanatory materials since Bush unveiled his spending plan
on Feb. 9.

<HEAD>Despite Small February Dip, Farm Prices 14 Per Cent Above A Year
Ago</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices farmers got for raw products declined
0.7 percent from January to February but still averaged 14 percent
more than a year ago, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its
preliminary report that lower prices for soybeans, lettuce, milk and
corn were mostly responsible for the decline from the January
average.
   Higher prices for tomatoes, strawberries, potatoes and hay partly
offset the decline in the other commodities.
   ``Prices of food grains increased from January to February while
feed grains and oilseed prices decreased,'' the report said. ``The
all-wheat price moved to the highest level since April of 1981, but
the average corn and soybean prices dropped from January to
February.''
   Tomato prices moved up sharply during the month, and the February
average for cattle and calves was the highest since May 1979.
   The report also included revisions showing that prices received
by farmers actually rose 2.8 percent from December to January
instead of the 1.4 percent gain reported a month ago.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, meanwhile, told Congress
that the farm economy as a whole ``is continuing to make real
progress in recovering'' from the hard times of the early and mid
1980s.
   Last year's drought helped reduce supplies of major crops,
including corn, soybeans and wheat, which has resulted in higher
prices.
   ``The higher prices have helped maintain a high cash income level
for those farmers with supplies to sell and for the sector as a
whole,'' Yeutter told the House Budget Committee.
   ``However,'' he added, ``the drought dealt a severe blow to many
producers in drought areas who lost much of their crop and who did
not have prior-year crops to sell. It also placed a heavy burden on
livestock, poultry and dairy producers who were faced with higher
feed costs.''
   According to the preliminary February price figures, based mostly
on midmonth averages, the index for livestock and livestock products
as a group declined 0.6 percent from their January average but was
still up 5.4 percent from February 1988.
   The department's all-crops price index for February was down 1.4
percent from January but averaged 27 percent above a year ago.
   No new price figures for farm production costs were included in
the February report. Those have been confined to quarterly averages
because of budget cutbacks.
   In January, however, new quarterly figures showed that prices
paid by farmers to meet expenses were up 1.2 percent from last fall
and were 6.1 percent higher than a year earlier.
   Although the projections are subject to change, USDA economists
say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $48
billion to $52 billion this year, compared with a near-record of $57
billion in 1988. That is the difference between cash receipts and
cash expenses during the calendar year.
   Department economists say cash expenses are expected to rise
moderately in 1989 with expanded crop acreages and costlier
production items.
   Food prices in 1988 rose an average of 3.7 percent. USDA analysts
say another increase of 3 percent to 5 percent is likely in 1989.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $70.70 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally,
up from $70.60 in January and $67.40 in February 1988. Those are
averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $40 per 100 pounds, compared with $40.90 in
January and $45.80 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.54 a bushel, was down from $2.60 in January but up
from $1.83 a year in February 1988.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $4.03 per bushel, compared with $4.01 in January and $2.79
a year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $6.55 per 100 pounds, up from $6.47 in January.
Rice was $9.37 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $7.23 per bushel, compared with $7.69 in January
and $5.96 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 53.1 cents per pound, down from
53.9 cents in January and 57 cents in February 1988.
   _Eggs were 62.1 cents per dozen, compared with 63.9 cents in
January and 46.9 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $13.10 per 100 pounds, compared with $13.40 in January
and $12.30 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 35.2 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
35.3 cents in January and 25.7 cents a year ago.

<HEAD>Firefighters Drop Incendiary Bombs To Block Everglades Blaze</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Helicopter-riding firefighters dropped incendiary
bombs along the route of a 10-mile-long Everglades wildfire Tuesday
to corral the spreading blaze and prevent it from damaging nearby
interstate power lines.
   Meanwhile, state forestry workers battled scores of other brush
fires around the state, including a 4,000-acre blaze just east of
Naples on Florida's southwest coast, and a 500-acre fire brought
under control just south of Jacksonville.
   The largest wildfire was burning sawgrass in the Everglades,
moving north along U.S. 27 toward the Palm Beach County line, and
running parallel to utility transmission lines that were shut down
again Tuesday to avoid blackouts.
   Firefighters initially tried to enter the swampy grassland in
all-terrain vehicles to pack down the sawgrass and create a
firebreak, but on Tuesday flames spread to 6,500 acres, burning an
area a mile across and 10 miles in length along U.S. 27.
   ``Our people were getting stuck _ it's very wet out there,'' said
David Utley, duty officer at the fire. ``We've decided to change
tactics, and use the helicopter to fight fire with fire, instead of
water.''
   The firefighers dropped small ping-pong-size balls filled with
potassium permanganate and ethylene glycol under the transmission
lines and along the western edge of the fire. Florida Power &amp; Light
Co. shut off power through the wires for four hours during the
backfire operation.
   ``The balls drop out, and when they hit the ground a chain
reaction starts and they catch on fire in about 45 seconds,'' Utley
said.
   The plan is to funnel the fire toward a canal blocking its path
to the north, he said.
   The fire _ which he said was apparently set sometime Sunday
morning _ did not directly threaten the 500,000-volt utility lines
or any inhabited areas, and firefighers hoped their new tactics
would have it under control within 24 hours, Utley said.
   Arson also figured in many of the other 65 fires the forestry
division was fighting Monday and Tuesday, said Charles Maynard,
spokesman for the agency in Tallahassee.
   Rainfall averaging only a third to a half of normal since the
fall has made the fires much more dangerous, as in 1985 when fires
burned over 100,000 acres around the state and caused a Miami
blackout.
   ``It's not as bad as in 1985, but it has the potential for
getting worse'' he said. ``We have certainly not had the rainfall
across the state that we need.''
   The National Weather Service was forecasting scattered showers in
some parts of the state over the next few days, but nothing that
would alleviate the growing fire danger, Maynard said.

   A mysterious man linked to the Medellin
cocaine cartel acknowledged he forged millions of dollars in
greenbacks and passed thousands along the U.S.-Mexico border, a top
law enforcement official said Tuesday.
   The man passed at least $100,000 worth of the phony money at an
unidentified bank in El Paso, Texas, before he was arrested Saturday
across the border in Ciudad Juarez, officials said.
   Deputy Attorney General Javier Coello Trejo told a news
conference that Mexican and American treasury experts are trying to
determine where the rest of the near-perfect fakes went.
   ``The U.S. Treasury experts we brought in were scared when they
saw the bills, which were in $10, $20 and $50 denominations. They
were almost perfect,'' Coello said, passing a couple of fake $100
bills to journalists.
   Coello said the man's identity is still a mystery despite
extensive questioning. He said the suspect had given the names of
Newton Peter von Gramm and Newton Peter von Shultz, among others.
   ``He went under many aliases and he operated in Canada for quite
awhile before coming to Mexico,'' Coello said, adding it is not
clear if the man is a German, Canadian or U.S. citizen.
   The man was arrested Saturday along with eight Mexicans when
Federal Judicial Police received a tip and raided a number of
clandestine engraving shops. Police seized at least $11 million
worth of U.S. bills.
   ``The man came to Mexico and hired two people from Tlaxcala
state, specialists in printing, and set up the engraving shops in
Juarez. They did some top work,'' he said, holding a fake bill up to
the light.
   ``We don't know yet how much money was forged. We are still
counting. Up until today we have counted about $11 million,'' Coello
said.
   The nine suspects were flown to Mexico City on Sunday for further
questioning and possible indictment. Forging currency is a federal
offense in Mexico.
   Coello said the man admitted he ``was connected to the Medellin
cartel'' and he had sent a sum of money to Colombia ``through some
traffickers in Monterrey, which federal agents are investigating.''
   ``We have already advised them and sent the information we have
to authorities in Colombia about that,'' Coello said.
   The Medellin cartel, named after the Colombian city which is it
home base, is considered the world's largest cocaine trafficking
ring.
   A source at the Attorney General's Office who insisted on
anonymity said the cartel may be running out of dollars as a result
of a crackdown on money laundering in Colombia, Mexico and the
United States and may be resorting to fake currency to meet expenses.

<HEAD>Mandatory Leave Bill Clears First Hurdle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee approved legislation
Tuesday to require large employers to provide up to 10 weeks of
unpaid leave for parents to spend with new children.
   The measure also would require employers to make 15 weeks leave
available to workers who need time off to care for a seriously ill
parent or child.
   The bill, which cleared the Education and Labor's subcommittee on
labor-management relations on a 11-5 vote, is similar to Senate
legislation strongly pushed for the last two years by Sen. Chris
Dodd, D-Conn.
   The House bill now goes to the full Education and Labor
Committee, where approval is considered certain.
   The Dodd bill reached the Senate floor for debate last year, but
died for lack of action. The full House did not debate its version
of the legislation last year.
   The House bill would apply to employers with 50 or more workers
for the first three years and to those with 35 or more workers after
three years.
   Backers estimate the House measure would cover about 39 percent
of the U.S. labor force the first three years and 43 percent
thereafter.
   The Dodd bill would apply to employers with 20 or more workers,
or about 47 percent of the total workforce.
   Although employers would not have to pay salary to workers on
leave, business generally opposes the legislation on grounds it
would be disruptive to planning and because employers would have to
continue paying any health insurance premiums for the employee on
leave.
   While the Senate took the lead last year, the informal plan now
being worked out among proponents for parental leave legislation is
for the House to go first this year while the Senate concentrates on
child care subsidies.
   However, Democratic leaders in both houses have said their first
priority on labor-management issues this year is raising the current
$3.35 an hour minimum wage.
   Bills on the minimum wage, child care and parental leave all
received extensive debate last year. Democratic leaders on both
sides of the Capitol are moving quickly to get bills on the floor
again this year with only minimal time for rearguing the issues in
the committees.

   The District of Columbia Council, in a new
attack on drug-related crime in the nation's capital, voted Tuesday
to bar many teen-agers from congregating on street corners and other
public areas late at night and during the early morning hours.
   But it refused to act immediately on Mayor Marion Barry Jr.'s
proposed emergency city legislation to create a mandatory five-year
prison term for anyone using guns to commit crimes. The council
decided more time is needed to study that proposal.
   The council approved a curfew that would bar those under age 18
from gathering on street corners, parks or other public areas
between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. on Sunday through Thursday and from
midnight to 6 a.m. on Friday and Saturday.
   Parents of a curfew violator would face no penalty in the case of
a first offense but would pay $100 if there is a second offense,
$200 for a third one, and $500 for additional violations.
   The emergency measure came as the city attempted to slow the pace
of drug-related killings. Police blame about 60 percent of last
year's record 372 killings on drugs. So far this year, 90 people
have been slain in the district, 36 more than during the matching
period last year.
   However, Frederick Cooke, the city's chief attorney, said the
bill may not slow the growth of drug-related homicides.
   ``The fact of the matter is the average age of the homicide
victim in the District of Columbia is (30) years of age and the
average age of perpetrators of these homicides is in excess of 18
years of age,'' Cooke said. ``It's not going to really address the
problem significantly.''
   The council decided to study Barry proposal to require five-year
prison terms for people who commit crimes with guns.
   The council agreed with its chairman, voting to delay action
until the proposal Barry submitted late Monday can be examined.
   ``We just need some time to review this matter,'' said Council
Chairman David Clarke. ``We've had some comments from (U.S. Attorney
Jay Stephens) and requests for more time.''
   Clarke has scheduled a briefing from city officials on the bill
and indicated he could convene a special session to enact the
legislation, perhaps as early as Wednesday.
   ``We're not going to let these gun-carrying thugs, dope dealers
... feel that because we have some difficulties in our jail
population, that there's no room,'' Barry told a citizens group
Monday night. ``We will find room _ find places for them to stay in
jail.''
   At a news conference earlier, Barry said the city is starting
``an all-out assault on weapons.''
   Barry's proposal would strengthen the penalty in the city's
misdemeanor gun law which already provides for a maximum punishment
of one year in jail and a $1,000 fine for those caught with
unregistered weapons.
   Barry's bill also proposes redefining the city's bail laws so
that those caught carrying an unregistered weapon, selling drugs or
using a weapon in an assault could be denied release before trial.
   Barry wants to create a ``drug-free zone'' of up to 1,000 feet
from city schools. Under that bill, those caught using or selling
drugs in those areas would face an additional three-year jail term.
   Barry acknowledged that his measures would add still more
prisoners to the city's jail system, which is already operating
under court orders requiring a reduction in overcrowding. Inmates
have been sent to several states to help alleviate that problem.

   With few exceptions, officials and newspapers in the
Far East rated President Bush's fast-paced visit a success in
showing the importance the new U.S. administration puts on relations
with Asian countries.
   Bush returned to Washington on Monday night after a five-day
swing to Japan, China and South Korea, his first overseas trip as
president. Asian commentators said it was the first time a new
president had visited Asia before Europe, and said the trip was
extraordinary in coming so early in Bush's tenure.
   The official Xinhua news agency in China called it an ``unusual
diplomatic initiative'' and said, ``China looms large in Bush's
foreign policy. Over the years, he has attached importance to
China's role in world affairs and cared for the expansion of
U.S.-China relations.''
   In Tokyo, Bush met leaders of 20 foreign countries in the swirl
of ``funeral diplomacy'' among dignitaries paying respects to the
late Emperor Hirohito. His stop in Seoul let him reassert the U.S.
determination to maintain its troop strength in South Korea and
support for democratic reforms. And in Beijing his presence lent a
counterbalance to the warming of Sino-Soviet relations.
   ``His visit ... clearly indicates the importance the Bush
administration attaches to Asia,'' the liberal Japanese daily Asahi
Shimbun said in an editorial.
   Bush's talks covered hot spots such as the Korean peninsula and
Cambodia as well as the softer issues of trade and human rights,
with a notable flap in Beijing when Chinese police prevented
dissident Fang Lizhi from attending a banquet to which Bush had
invited him.
   The Chinese, while saying Bush's visit would enhance Sino-U.S.
friendship, were angry at what they saw as U.S. interference in
their affairs.
   Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang said, ``The fact that some
Americans support those Chinese who are not satisfied with the
Chinese government will be detrimental not only to China's policial
stability and the progress of its reforms but also to the Sino-U.S.
friendship.''
   The conservative Hong Kong daily, South China Morning Post, said
Bush had been ill-advised to invite Fang.
   ``It was a rash and provocative gesture,'' it said in an
editorial. ``China, in turn, overreacted foolishly by physically
ensuring that the outspoken activist was not able to attend.''
   In Thailand, the conservative English-language Bangkok Post said
the Fang incident showed China was as authoritarian now as in the
1970s when Bush served as U.S. envoy to Beijing. It also showed the
Americans ``that their road to Chinese favor is just as bumpy as
that of the Russians,'' the Bangkok Post said.
   Thai government spokesman Suvit Yodmani said Bush's talks with
other world leaders gave them a ``good opportunity to reaffirm their
commitments and promote relations with more countries.''
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo, after talks with Bush, said
they would work to resolve ``various problems resulting from the
rapid expansion of economic relations between our two countries'' _
a reference to trade frictions.
   Roh said he had briefed Bush on efforts to reduce tensions with
North Korea. That country's official media sounded a sour note in
denouncing Bush's visit to Seoul and demanding that U.S. troops be
withdrawn from South Korea.
   The Rodong Sinmun daily of the ruling North Korean Workers
(Communist) Party said Bush's visit would be marked by ``aggression
and treachery between the new master and the new servant.''
   The liberal Australian daily, the Sydney Morning Herald, said
Bush's trip was ``a welcome reassurance of the continued U.S.
commitment to the Asia-Pacific region.'' It suggested that
Washington propose a reversal of the arms buildup in the northern
Pacific and also measures to reduce the risk of regional conflict.
   ``That would test the sincerity of (Soviet President Mikhail)
Gorbachev's stated desire to reduce tensions in Asia and the
Pacific. It would also give the U.S. an edge in the disarmament
debate in the region and may lead to agreements easing the security
concerns of Japan, South Korea and China,'' the Sydney paper said.
   The independent Indonesian daily Kompas, commenting on Bush's
call for progress in removing Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, said
Washington has less at stake in Cambodia than China and the Soviets
but still ``can contribute to the efforts to find a political
solution to the problem.''
   Japan's largest daily, the middle-of-the-road Yomiuri Shimbun,
welcomed the U.S. intention to play an active role in Asia.
   ``Asia is undergoing dynamic economic development,'' the Yomiuri
said. ``It is also in the process of the rearrangement of
multilateral relations, which was set in motion by Sino-Soviet
reconciliation. The United States must play its part.''

<HEAD>Cher's Boyfriend Pleads No Contest to Vandalism Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cher's boyfriend pleaded no contest Tuesday to
two counts of vandalism for smashing a photographer's camera
equipment outside the home of the Oscar-winning actress, a
prosecutor said.
   Attorney John Forbes entered the plea on behalf of Rob
Camilletti, 24, who was not in court, said Deputy City Attorney
Renee Laurents.
   Camilletti, a former New York bagel maker, pizza chef and
bartender, faces up to one year in jail and a $2,000 fine when he is
sentenced March 14.
   The charges stem from an incident last July in which Camilletti
had a run-in with free-lance photographers who were staking out
Cher's Benedict Canyon home.
   Camilletti was accused of trying to run photographer Peter Brandt
down in a Ferrari and damaging his camera equipment.
   ``He tried to kill me. He tried to run me over at a high rate of
speed,'' Brandt, 35, said after the incident.
   Camilletti was also charged with reckless driving, but Ms.
Laurents said she will move to dismiss that count at the sentencing.
``Not that I don't believe he wasn't driving recklessly; his pleas
justifies the case,'' the prosecutor said.
   ``He seems to be a nice young man,'' she added. ``I wouldn't
brand him a criminal, but what he did was against the law.''
   Cher and Camilletti, however, angrily denied at a news conference
after the incident that he tried to run the photographer down. Cher
blamed pesky paparazzi and the frustration of living under the media
spotlight for the flare-up since she won a best actress Oscar in
1988 for her role in the film ``Moonstruck.''
   Cher, 42, and Camilletti have been companions since meeting at a
New York nightclub on her 40th birthday. He is also pursuing an
acting career.

<TEXT>
   Two businessmen were acquitted Tuesday
of smuggling munitions to Iran and other countries in the Middle
East, the first verdict in a series of weapons sales scandals.
   The district court absolved Mats Lundberg, a former marketing
director of Swedish arms manufacturer Nobel Kemi, of charges that he
sold 1,300 tons of explosives worth $12 million to blacklisted
countries, including Syria and Egypt.
   Sweden, a neutral country, forbids weapons sales to countries at
war or in areas of conflict.
   The court also acquitted Karl-Erik Schmitz, an independent trader
who reputedly is Sweden's biggest private arms merchant, on charges
of mediating illegal arms sales.
   The court ruled the weapons were sold legally and exported again
to the banned countries without the knowledge of Nobel Kemi or
anyone in the government.
   Both Lundberg and Schmitz were convicted, however, of sending
samples of merchandise to Iran and fined the equivalent of $1,000
and $2,500 respectively.
   On Monday, Justice Chancellor Hans Stark released a report
accusing a state-owned munitions factory of violating the export
regulations for 20 years.
   In another case awaiting trial, former executives of another
Swedish company, Bofors AB, have been accused of selling
sophisticated missile systems to Iran through third parties. Bofors
owned Nobel Kemi during the 1981 to 1985 period Lundberg had been
accused of making the illegal sales.
   Partly as a result of the disclosure that Swedish weapons were
being used in the Iran-Iraq war, Sweden last year tightened its
export regulations.

   The Supreme Court, in a defeat for unions,
ruled Tuesday that railroads and airlines may penalize strikers by
giving their jobs to employees with less seniority who stay on the
job or return to work before the strike ends.
   The 6-3 decision was described by the dissenters as ``inherently
destructive of the right to strike'' but defended by the court's
majority as a lawful exercise of an employer's power.
   The court ruled that Trans World Airlines legitimately exercised
its ``peaceful economic power'' when it refused to rehire thousands
of striking flight attendants after the walkout ended.
   Many of the jobs went instead to flight attendants who remained
at work or abandoned the strike to return to work. Those employees
are called ``cross-overs'' for crossing the picket line.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, said TWA had
the right to retain cross-overs just as it has the power to hire new
employees to replace striking workers.
   ``That this decision had the effect of encouraging pre-strike
workers to remain on the job during the strike or to abandon the
strike and return to work before all vacancies were filled was an
effect of the exercise of TWA's peaceful economic power,'' she said.
   Rex Hardesty, spokesman for the AFL-CIO here, expressed regret
over the ruling but added, ``We have to live it.''
   Mona Zeiberg, a lawyer for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said,
``It's a positive ruling for business.''
   The decision was based on an interpretation of the federal
Railway Labor Act, which governs airlines as well as railroads.
   While it does not apply directly to other industries, O'Connor
said most employers have enjoyed the same power since a 1938 Supreme
Court ruling.
   She said the court then interpreted the National Labor Relations
Act to allow employers to give strikers' jobs permanently to workers
who did not honor the strike.
   Justice William J. Brennan, in a dissenting opinion, disputed
O'Connor's understanding of the 51-year-old ruling.
   He said the 1938 decision applied only to workers hired from
outside the company.
   Since that ruling, he said, ``It has been accepted that an
employer may hire permanent replacements ...(who) need not be
displaced to make room for returning strikers.''
   But he said the 1938 decision has not been applied before now to
``members of the striking bargaining unit who have crossed the
picket lines.''
   Tuesday's ruling ``is inherently destructive of the right to
strike as guaranteed by the Railway Labor Act and the National Labor
Relations Act,'' Brennan said.
   The case stems from a dispute between TWA and the Independent
Federation of Flight Attendants (IFFA). The flight attendants'
three-year contract expired July 31, 1984, and the union called a
strike on March 7, 1986, when negotiations failed.
   TWA hired more than 2,350 new flight attendants and trainees
after the strike began. In addition, some 1,280 TWA flight
attendants crossed picket lines either at the outset of the walkout
or as the strike continued for more than two months.
   After the strike ended, the union filed a federal lawsuit
charging TWA with illegally refusing to reinstate most of the 5,000
striking workers who stayed out the two months.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 1987 that striking
flight attendants were entitled to their old jobs at the expense of
less senior flight attendants who had crossed the picket lines.
   The flight attendants hired during the strike were allowed to
keep their new jobs and were not affected by that ruling or
Tuesday's decision that reversed the 8th Circuit court ruling.
   O'Connor said preferential treatment for cross-overs does not
violate seniority protections because workers who stayed out on
strike but were reinstated after the walkout ended retain their
seniority rights over cross-overs with less seniority.
   She was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Byron R. White, John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M.
Kennedy. Besides Brennan, the other dissenters were Justices
Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun.
   The Supreme Court, in a 4-4 ruling a year ago in another case
stemming from the TWA strike, held that an airline may be forced to
continue collecting union dues from workers after its contract with
the employees has expired.
   TWA had sought to discontinue the dues check-off after the strike
ended. The Supreme Court's tie vote upheld a lower court ruling that
the airline may not cancel the check-off provision unless it is
agreed to in negotiations with the workers.

   Iran's parliament voted Tuesday to sever
ties with Britain, restored to normal just three months ago, unless
it condemns ``The Satanic Verses'' and stops criticizing Iran for
ordering the author killed.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the parliament
gave Britain a week to meet the conditions, but Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government made clear it would not do so.
   ``The British position will not be altered by threats of any
kind,'' William Waldegrave, minister of state in the Foreign Office,
said in London.
   Mrs. Thatcher told the House of Commons freedom of speech and
expression are ``subject only to the laws of this land ... and will
remain subject to the rule of law. It is absolutely fundamental to
everything in whic we believe and cannot be interfered with by any
outside force.''
   Mohammed Basti, Iran's charge d'affaires, said on television
before leaving Britain: ``It is very unfortunate your government has
taken the lead in making this matter a purely political subject.''
   Salman Rushdie, 41-year-old author of ``The Satanic Verses,'' was
born in Bombay, India, to Moslem parents but now is a British
citizen and does not practice religion actively.
   He has been in hiding since Feb. 14, when Iranian patriarch
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini commanded followers to kill him.
Khomeini and many other Moslems believe Rushdie's novel blasphemes
Islam and the prophet Mohammed.
   In its first coment on the controversy, the Soviet Union said the
Kremlin leadership expressed concern.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, discussed the matter for
two hours with Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and President Ali
Khamenei during a three-day visit to Iran that ended Monday.
   Gerasimov said Shevardnadze will raise the issue with Secretary
of State James A. Baker III and other foreign ministers at a meeting
March 7 in Vienna.
   Charles Redman, the State Department spokesman, said Tuesday in
Washington the United States and Britain had urged Shevardnadze to
bring the subject up in Tehran.
   ``Every civilized nation has an international responsibility to
state its abhorrence to death threats,'' he said. ``No responsible
member of the community of nations should let them go unanswered.''
   IRNA said the decision by the Majlis, the Iranian parliament, was
endorsed by the Council of Guardians, 12 clerics and laymen who must
approve legislation.
   It said ``nearly all'' the 201 deputies attending Tuesday's
session voted for the bill, introduced two days ago. The Majlis has
270 members, but some were absent and the credentials of others have
not been approved since elections in April and May.
   The news agency gave this text of the bill: ``From the date of
the approval of this law, if the British government does not
officially declare in a maximum period of one week its opposition to
the unprincipled stand against the world of Islam and the Islamic
republic of Iran, and to the contents of the anti-Islamic book `The
Satanic Verses,' the Foreign Ministry of the Islamic republic of
Iran is obliged to break all bilateral political ties.''
   Deputies stood, cheered and praised Mohammed and his descendants
after the vote, the report said. According to IRNA, the amendment
giving Britain a week to comply with Iran's demands was proposed by
more than 100 deputies.
   Parliament has been dominated since the elections by radical
factions that do not always agree.
   Tuesday's debate indicated many members do not fully support
Khomeini's declaration that Iran does not need relations with the
West, which he considers decadent and anti-Islamic, or more liberal
policies following the truce last August in the eight-year war with
Iraq.
   Britain recalled its five diplomats from Tehran and asked Iran's
representatives to leave after Khomeini passed the death sentence on
Rushdie, to which Iranian clerics added a reward of $5.2 million.
   Its 11 partners in the European Economic Community were joined by
Norway, Sweden and Canada in withdrawing their top diplomats from
Iran, which also recalled its ambassadors to EEC nations.
   British diplomats returned to Tehran in December after a period
of virtually no representation that began in 1987 with the arrest of
an Iranian diplomat in northern England on shoplifiting charges.
   The embassy was closed for nine years and Iran had long
considered Britain its second-ranking enemy in the West after the
United States.
   Tehran radio said in a commentary the Majlis vote ``marked a
turning point in Iranian foreign policy,'' the first time Iran took
the initiative in ending ties.
   ``The Islamic Republic has demonstrated that it does not want
relations at any price,'' the radio said. ``The Iranian parliament's
reaction to anti-Islamic activities is a warning to governments
which are in any way involved in the struggle against Islam and
Moslems.''
   IRNA quoted Foreign Minister Velayati, who had advocated more
open relations with other countries, as saying before the vote: ``We
agree with the proposal and in future this will be our stand toward
any country which attacks Islam and Islamic sanctities. Safeguarding
the interests of Islam ... is not an easy job.''

<HEAD>Task Force Asks For $800 Million In Mandatory Work On Old Airliners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A task force of aviation industry and
government safety experts proposed Tuesday that the world's airlines
be ordered to do $800 million in work on older Boeing 747s, 737s and
727s.
   But the task force, moving to ensure the safety of an aging
international airline fleet, said none of the proposed repairs was
urgent and all could be done over several years' time.
   The group, set up the Air Transport Association, which represents
major U.S. airlines, asked the Federal Aviation Administration to
issue a massive ``airworthiness directive'' making mandatory
modifications and replacements recommended in 150 Boeing Co. service
bulletins.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner applauded the proposal
and said the FAA already had begun procedures required to issue the
massive airworthiness directive called for by the task force.
   The FAA has jurisdiction over planes flown by U.S. carriers.
Regulatory bodies in other countries issue the rules under which
those nations' planes operate.
   The transport association estimated that 30 percent to 40 percent
of the affected planes fall under FAA jurisdiction.
   The proposed work would apply to more than 1,300 Boeing aircraft
worldwide at an average cost of $600,000 per plane. A Boeing
representative on the task force joined in the unanimous vote to
make his company's recommendations mandatory.
   Clyde Kizer, transport association vice president, said the
proposed repairs and replacements would be tied to the number of
times an airliner had taken off and landed and its time in the sky.
   Emphasizing that none of the work was considered pressing, Kizer
told a news conference, ``There are no dangerous aircraft out there
flying right now.''
   Parts affected would include joints, fittings, outside skin and
some structural materials, Kizer said.
   ``What we are suggesting,'' he said, ``is that at some point in
an aircraft's history it is no longer acceptable just to inspect.''
   The FAA now requires airlines to conduct regular inspections of
older aircraft and, in most cases, to make repairs and changes when
problems are found.
   The task force proposal would mandate the replacement of specific
aircraft parts according to how much a plane had been used rather
than its chronological age.
   Kizer said the release of the report, which followed nine months
of work, had nothing to do with Friday's incident in which nine
people died after a hole opened in the fuselage of a United Airlines
747 over the Pacific Ocean.
   Investigators probing the crash are focusing on the possibility
of a cargo door problem that could be related to aging. Kizer said
the task force proposal covered no work involving cargo doors on
747s.
   The group, which also includes international aviation experts and
U.S. government representatives, began its work partly in response
to an April 1988 incident in which part of the roof of an Aloha
Airlines 737 peeled away over Hawaii, sucking a stewardess to her
death.
   The average age of the world's 8,800 airliners is just over 13
years, according to Avmark, an aviation appraisal firm. Its latest
survey, done in July, showed the average U.S. airliner in service
was 12.67 years old.
   Service records of older McDonnell Douglas aircraft _ such as
DC-10s, DC-9s and DC-8s _ and aircraft build overseas are also being
studied by task force committees. They are due to make
recommendations later this year.
   Ben Cosgrove, a Boeing vice president who was on the task force,
said his company supported the recommendations announced Tuesday.
   While aging airliners continue to be safe if properly inspected
and maintained, he said, ``we don't want to continue to inspect
them'' for potential problems, preferring instead that work
suggested in the bulletins be carried out.
   Airlines participating in the task force said they did not expect
immediate major expenses in part because they have already done or
planned much of the work voluntarily.
   ``We don't anticipate anything over and above what we've already
planned to do,'' said Bob Doll, a United Air Lines vice president
who helped draw up the recommendations.
   Pan American President Thomas G. Plaskett, who did not
participate in the task force, said his airline fully supports the
proposal. ``Unless we do this, the U.S. fleet is not going to be big
enough to meet the demand,'' he said.
   He noted that half the world's airliners are over 20 years old
while increased air travel and the growing world demand for
airliners is forcing carriers to wait several years for the delivery
of new jets.

<HEAD>Senate Hearings Open Wednesday for Bush's Nominee for Drug Czar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug czar-designate William J. Bennett spent
several weeks studying briefing books on the nation's drug situation
and expects few problems at Senate confirmation hearings, an aide
said Tuesday.
   ``No one's led us to believe this will be a hostile or circuslike
affair,'' said David Tell, Bennett's deputy chief of staff. Two days
of Senate Judiciary Committee hearings begin Wednesday.
   Although declining to say whether aides tossed tough questions at
Bennett to prepare him for the worst, Tell said: ``We've made sure
he's ready. ... He's looking forward to it.''
   Bennett has kicked his habit of smoking two packs of cigarettes a
day.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., the committee chairman, said he
doesn't care about the smoking. But Bennett made a commitment Jan.
12, when nominated by President Bush to become the nation's first
director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, to stop
smoking.
   Bennett attended a stop-smoking clinic, called ``Breathe Free,''
when he, his wife, Elayne, and son John went to a resort in Berkeley
Springs, W.Va., last week.
   ``It was the final vacation with his family before he starts the
new job,'' Tell said.
   ``I went in his office and there's no ashtray,'' said Tell,
although there are some crutches _ a bowl of fruit and lollipops.
   Biden said Tuesday that while he believes Bennett could be a good
drug czar, he'll have some tough questions for Bennett about the job.
   The director is to compile in his first 180 days a comprehensive
drug-control strategy covering all aspects of the battle against
illegal drugs.
   ``I'm going to be looking for a clear statement from Bennett that
he fully understands what the law says, what it is intended to do,
and how he believes he can and will wield his authority relative to
the remainder of the federal government, which has not had anybody
... in that job before. I'm sure he is going to meet some
resistance,'' Biden said.
   ``I'm looking for him to demonstrate a clear understanding and
agreement with the rationale for the creation of the office, the
requirement of coming up with a plan and how he intends to go about
that, an understanding of the authority and willingness to exercise
the authority to implement that plan from a budget standpoint as
well as a broader administration position standpoint,'' the senator
said.
   Biden added: ``Does he need a top-flight, well-known law
enforcement officer to make up for his lack of law enforcement
background? Does he think he needs someone in one of his two deputy
spots with background in existing programs, education as well as
treatment?''
   Paul Smith, an aide to Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, said the
senator ``expects the Democrats to bring up Bennett's lack of law
enforcement background.'' Still, he added, Bennett is ``going to get
out of the hearings without major problems. It should be smooth
sailing for him.''

<HEAD>Bush Announces Choices for Several State Department Posts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday announced his choices
for several sub-Cabinet-level State Department posts, including the
selection of Bernard Aronson to succeed Elliott Abrams as assistant
secretary of state for Inter-American affairs.
   Aronson, 41, is a Democrat who served as a White House
speechwriter for President Jimmy Carter and later was policy
director for the Democratic National Committee. More recently,
Aronson headed The Policy Project, a consulting firm in Washington.
   Among other announced State Department nominations, all requiring
Senate confirmation, were:
   _Douglas Mulholland, to be assistant secretary of state for
intelligence and research, succeeding Morton Abramowitz.
   Mulholland was an analyst for domestic policy and research for
the Bush presidential campaign committee. He held several positions
at the CIA between 1956-79.
   _Richard Armitage, to be assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific Affairs, succeeding Gaston Sigur.
   Since 1983, Armitage has been assistant secretary of defense for
international security affairs. He previously served as an
administrative assistant to Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., in 1978-79.
   _John H. Kelly, to be an assistant secretary of state for Near
East and South Asian affairs, succeeding Richard Murphy.
   Kelly has been the principal deputy director of the policy
planning staff at the State Department since last year. Before that,
he was the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon from 1986 to 1988.
   _Herman Jay Cohen, to be assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, succeeding Chester A. Crocker.
   From 1987 until the present time, Cohen had been the senior
director for African affairs on the National Security Council staff
at the White House. He held several positions previously at the
State Department.
   _John Bolton, to be an assistant secretary of state for
international organization affairs, succeeding Richard Williamson.
   Bolton has been assistant attorney general in charge of the civil
division of the Justice Department since last year. Before that he
was assistant attorney general in the office of legislative affairs
and had been a partner in the Washington law firm of Covington &amp;
Burling.

   Jamaica's new prime minister, Michael Manley,
has hired a Washington lobbying firm, Neill and Company, to promote
U.S. economic aid to his Caribbean island, a lobbyist for the firm
said Tuesday.
   The lobbyist, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said his
company has been asked to seek more direct congressional aid for
Jamaica as well as possible loans and guarantees from U.S.
government institutions.
   In addition, Manley wants the lobbyists to pursue private U.S.
investment in Jamaica, the lobbyist said. Neill and Company's other
clients include Pakistan, Kenya and Morocco.
   Manley's election earlier this month raised some concern in
Washington because of his past socialist policies. As prime minister
from 1972 to 1980, Manley forged close ties with Cuba's Fidel Castro
and brought in scores of Cuban doctors and technicians.
   His successor, conservative Edward Seaga, closed Cuba's embassy
in Kingston and turned to Washington.
   Manley has decided to reopen Cuba's embassy but has promised the
United States he will limit the Cuban presence in Jamaica.
   ``Obviously we're not in agreement with that policy,'' said a
State Department official, also requesting anonymity. ``We feel Cuba
should be isolated in the Caribbean. But Jamaica is a sovereign
nation and has the right to conduct its diplomacy.''
   Manley is planning an official trip to Washington in the spring
or summer, and the White House is trying to work out a meeting with
President George Bush.
   ``We want to get off to a good start with him,'' the State
Department official said.
   The United States has given Jamaica more than $150 million in
recent months for reconstruction of the damage from last September's
Hurricane Gilbert. Jamaica received $47.6 million in U.S. food and
development aid in 1988.

   A high-level advisory commission created to
craft a bipartisan solution to the country's deficit woes ended up
deadlocked and will issue a report Wednesday split virtually along
party lines, according to members of the commission.
   The National Economic Commission will issue a final report
supported by the seven Republicans on the commission and one
Democrat appointed by President Bush, Thomas Ashley, a former
congressman from Ohio, officials said.
   The majority report endorses Bush's stand against new taxes and
his proposal to cut the capital gains tax.
   The minority Democratic report, supported by the six members
appointed by the party's congressional leadership, will critize the
president's flexible freeze as an insufficient response to the
critical problem of the deficit but will stop short of endorsing new
taxes to deal with the deficit, officials said.
   Commission member Rep. William H. Gray III, a member of the
Democratic House leadership and a former House Budget Committee
chairman, blamed partisanship by Republicans for the group's failure
to succeed.
   ``The president didn't want a bipartisan deficit-eduction plan,''
he said. ``He wanted his own plan, the flexible freeze, and he
insisted on it from Republican members.''
   Gray said that as a result, ``instead of something bold that
could have moved us forward, we end up leaving it to Congress and
the administration to continue the fight.''
   The 14-member commission was created by Congress following the
October 1987 stock market crash. The panel's supporters hoped the
group, which was given a March 1, 1989, reporting date, would be
able to devise a plan to solve the government's huge budget deficits.
   Early in the presidential campaign, however, Bush derided the
panel _ which had the support of his Republican primary opponent,
Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan. _ as nothing but a stalking horse for tax
increases.
   After being elected, Bush did appoint the final two members to
the panel, Ashley and former Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev. But after
taking office, Bush refused to extend the panel's reporting deadline
for six months, as some members had hoped he would to give the panel
more time to reach a consensus.
   That decision all but sealed the panel's fate and with only a few
weeks remaining, the commission accepted that it would not be able
to reach a compromise and began preparing separate majority and
minority reports.
   Dean Kleckner, a Republican member of the commission, said
Tuesday that the majority report would call for reform of the budget
process through steamlining the congressional budget committee,
granting the president line-item veto authority of budget bills and
recommending a constitutional amendment requiring balanced budgets.
   He said the report would also recommend adoption of a two-year
budget process rather than the annual appropriation cycle now used.
   ``The report reflects the will of taxpayers throughout the
nation,'' Kleckner said in a statement. ``Testimony to the
commission from 85 witnesses and more than 1,300 responses from
private citizens and groups this past 11 months clearly indicated
opposition to higher taxes and irresponsible spending.''

   Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas, issued a terse
statement Tuesday supporting Defense-Secretary designate John Tower
but refused to comment on a published report that he told Senate
Armed Services Committee leaders that Tower used to drink up to a
bottle of scotch at a sitting.
   An unidentified congressional source told The Washington Post
that Combest's statement about Tower's drinking habits in the 1970s
came down on Sen. Sam Nunn, the committee chairman, ``like a ton of
bricks'' and was a factor in Nunn's opposition to the nomination.
   The newspaper reported that Combest later gave a different story
to the FBI, saying that Tower and a group of friends _ not Tower
alone _ had frequently consumed a bottle of scotch.
   After meeting with staff and advisers, Combest, who worked for
then-Sen. Tower in the 1970s, issued a two-sentence statement
supporting his fellow Texan.
   ``As a member of Congress, I have tremendous respect and full
confidence in the senator and his abilities to lead this country's
armed forces. In my judgment, John Tower will be a superb secretary
of defense,'' the statement said.
   Combest spokesman Rich Adams refused to comment further, and said
Combest was not available to speak to reporters.
   The Washington Post reported that Combest described for Nunn and
Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the
committee, Tower's heavy drinking bouts in the 1970s. A
congressional source was quoted as saying that Combest told the
senators that Tower would drink as much as a full bottle of scotch
two or three times a week.
   Trudi Boyd, Combest's administrative assistant, told the Post
that Combest originally went to Nunn and Warner to tell them Tower
had ended his previous excessive abuse of alcohol.
   Boyd also told the Post that a ``group of people'' drank the
entire bottle of scotch, not Tower alone. That was the account
Combest gave the FBI following his talk with Nunn and Warner, the
newspaper said. It said that in that account, Combest said that he
had only seen Tower drunk on two or three occasions.
   Tower has acknowledged that he drank excessively in the 1970s,
but says he has reduced his intake to wine with dinner. On Sunday,
he promised to not drink a drop of alcohol if confirmed as defense
secretary.
   Combest, 43, worked for Tower for seven years, 1971-1978, as a
legislative assistant handling agricultural legislation and policy.
Tower served in the Senate for 24 years, deciding not to seek
re-election in 1984. He was chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee from 1981 through 1984.
   The committee, now controlled by Democrats, voted 11-9 along
party lines last Thursday to recommend the full Senate reject
Tower's nomination.

<HEAD>Thousands March in Armenia to Mark Anniversary of Riot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Armenians marched in their capital of
Yerevan on Tuesday to mark the first anniversary of ethnic riots in
neighboring Azerbaijan in which at least 26 Armenians died, local
sources said.
   An editor with Armenpress, the official Armenian news agency, put
the number of marchers at 800,000, which would be two-thirds of
Yerevan's population of 1.2 million. There was no way to verify his
estimate.
   Rem Ananityan, deputy director of Armenpress, said in a telephone
interview that demonstrators carrying flowers gathered at a monument
on a Yerevan hillside commemorating victims of the 1915 massacre of
Armenians by Turks.
   Demonstrations are banned in Yerevan to reduce ethnic tensions,
but Ananityan said military authorities there allowed Tuesday's
demonstration to take place. He said no incidents were reported.
   Riots flared in Sumgait, Azerbaijan, on Feb. 28, 1988, weeks
after Armenians began demonstrating for annexation of the
Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, where most residents are
ethnic Armenians.
   Soviet officials say 32 people _ 26 Armenians and six
Azerbaijanis _ were killed, but Armenians insist the toll was much
higher.
   Further violence broke out in Armenia and Azerbaijan last June,
July and November, with more than 60 people killed. In January the
Kremlin imposed direct rule on Nagorno-Karabakh.
   In an interview printed Tuesday by the military daily Krasnaya
Zvezda, the Kremlin's special envoy to Nagorno-Karabakh, Arkady
Volsky, said tension there remains high.
   ``Mutual suspicion and mistrust persist, while reproaches and
accusations do not cease,'' Volsky told the newspaper, according to
a summary carried by the official Tass news agency.
   He said more than 200,000 people from Armenia and Azerbaijan fled
their homes because of the strife.
   Though populated largely by Armenians, who are traditionally
Christian, Nagorno-Karabakh was turned over by Soviet officials in
1923 to Azerbaijan, where most residents are Moslems.

   Sen. Sam Nunn's opposition to Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower has focused new attention on a 1964
incident in which a youthful Nunn pleaded guilty to leaving the
scene of a traffic accident.
   The Wall Street Journal in Tuesday's editions reprinted a Dec. 4,
1972, article from The Atlanta Journal detailing the Oct. 31, 1964
automobile accident based on Nunn's account and the official
accident report.
   ``If the Senate is entitled to pass judgment on John Tower's
personal history,'' the newspaper said in an editorial accompanying
the 1972 article, ``then the public is also entitled to know the
salient facts about those who judge Mr. Tower.''
   Nunn, D-Ga., is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
which voted 11-9 last week to reject Tower's nomination. Nunn and
the other 10 Democrats on the panel voted against Tower.
   According to police reports on the 1964 accident, Nunn had left a
Halloween party in his hometown of Perry, Ga., about 2:45 a.m. when
he swerved off the road and hit a parked car, then drove several
more blocks before going off the road and down an embankment.
   Nunn was charged with hit and run and leaving the scene of an
accident. Court records show he later forfeited a $115.50 bond on
the single charge of leaving the scene of an accident.
   Nunn, who has based his opposition to Tower's nomination in part
on allegations that Tower has a drinking problem, acknowledged in a
statement released by his office Tuesday that he had too much to
drink himself on the night of the accident 24 years ago.
   ``That evening, I had enough to drink so that both my driving and
judgment were impaired,'' Nunn, 50, said in the statement. ``I pled
guilty to leaving the scene, paid my fine, apologized to all
concerned and at the age of 26 learned a valuable lesson which I
have not forgotten.''
   Nunn repeated that statement later Tuesday in interviews with
Atlanta television stations and said he does not believe the
accident is relevant to the issue of the Tower nomination.
   ``The implication is that if I have an automobile accident in
1964, then I'm not qualified under the Constitution to render advice
and consent in 1989,'' Nunn said. ``I don't think that logic holds.
   ``I don't know that that is relevant to this, but I guess when
you're in this kind of fight, everything is fair game,'' he said.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Calls on Administration to Reassess Sudan Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
Tuesday urged the Bush administration to reassess future aid for
Sudan unless the government of the northern African nation improves
food deliveries to millions of hungry Sudanese.
   In a resolution adopted by the panel and referred to the full
Senate, the committee said another condition for aid should be
progress in negotiating a cease-fire with the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army to end nearly six years of civil war.
   The Sudanese army last week was reported to have given Prime
Minister Sadeq Mahdi a one-week ultimatum either to resign or begin
peace talks with the rebels.
   The Senate resolution _ and a similar one being introduced
Thursday in the House _ also calls on the administration to
cooperate with the Soviet Union in pressing the Sudanese government
and the rebels to settle their war.
   State Department officials say the United States has discussed
the Sudan crisis with the Soviets, but has not decided on joint
action.
   The resolution calls on President Bush to appoint a special envoy
to deal with Sudan.
   The Bush administration has put special emphasis on resolving the
Sudan problem, with Secretary of State James Baker issuing an urgent
call several weeks ago to the Sudanese government to allow foreign
relief shipments into famine areas.
   The United States and international relief agencies estimate that
some 2 million southerners are in dire need of food, and that more
than 500,000 died in 1988 from hunger.
   U.S. officials attribute the obstruction and delays of
international food deliveries to the fighting, to SPLA and
government restrictions, and to government inefficiency. Rebel
leaders have accused the government of withholding food from the
south as a form of genocide.
   The Senate resolution called on both the SPLA and the government
to refrain from using food as a weapon.
   The administration has asked Congress for $51 million for Sudan
in fiscal 1990 _ $45 million of it in economic and development aid
and $6 million for military projects. U.S. aid to the Sudan has been
dropping steadily in recent years as the coalition government has
lost some of its pro-Western orientation under the influence of a
strong faction of Moslem fundamentalists.

Tuesday that would pardon nearly 2,000 soldiers of the former Somoza
regime to comply with agreements made at a Central American summit
Feb. 14.
   Assembly president Carlos Nunez said the leftist Sandinista
government also would ask the legislature to pardon 800 jailed
Sandinista army soldiers. That appeared aimed at mollifying
government supporters angered at the proposal to release men who
served the late President Anastasio Somoza.
   Of the 1,932 on the list submitted to the assembly Tuesday, 1,688
are in prison and the rest under house arrest or free on probation.
   They were members of the National Guard, as the army was called
under Somoza, whose pro-U.S. government the Sandinistas overthrew in
July 1979.
   Passage of the amnesty bill is assured because the Sandinistas
have 61 seats in the 96-member assembly to 35 for all opposition
parties.
   Release of the political prisoners is stipulated in the
agreements reached at the summit by President Daniel Ortega and the
presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala.
   They also agreed to draft a plan within 90 days to dismantle
rebel forces supported by the United States. About 10,000 rebels, or
Contras, and 11,000 family members live in camps in Honduras, near
the Nicaraguan border.
   In a National Assembly debate Tuesday, before the amnesty bill
was sent to committee, a member said the pardon and release should
coincide with the end of the Contra organization.
   Otherwise, ``we would be letting out 1,000 National Guardsmen,
who could quickly form a military force, in exchange for a simple
promise'' to disarm and relocate the Contras, said Carlos Cuadra of
the opposition Marxist-Leninist Popular Action Movement.
   The assembly president, one of nine members in the Sandinista
National Directorate, urged the committee reviewing the bill to
report by March but did not specify a date. Neither did he say when
the request to pardon the 800 jailed Sandinistas was expected.
   Ortega is anxious to comply with the summit agreements because he
seeks financial aid, particularly from the 12-nation European
Economic Community. Several ambassadors from EEC nations have said
publicly and privately that further aid depends on increased
democracy in Nicaragua.
   Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto is attending a meeting of Common
Market and Latin American foreign ministers in Honduras to discuss
European economic aid to the region.
   Since Washington cut off aid and imposed a trade embargo in 1985,
Nicaragua has depended on help from the Soviet bloc and Western
Europe. A new U.S. government report estimates Soviet assistance at
about $500 million a year.
   Nicaragua's economy is a shambles. Inflation surpassed 20,000
percent in 1988 and the cost of living increased by 97 percent in
January. A government austerity plan calls 30,000 layoffs and
tighter credit.
   At the Feb. 14 summit in El Salvador, Ortega promised free
elections and moved the date forward by 10 months to Feb. 25, 1990.
He began meeting with opposition groups after returning from El
Salvador.
   In February 1988 the U.S. Congress cut off Contra military aid.
U.S. humanitarian aid runs out March 31 and President Bush has said
he will seek an extension.

   The government claimed Wednesday that
Honduran soldiers fired on Nicaraguan border posts 13 times this
year.
   A Defense Ministry statement said the latest incident was a
mortar attack Sunday on the Murupuchi outpost in Nuevo Segovia
province, 110 miles north of Managua. It did not mention casualties.
   On Monday, the ministry accused Honduran troops of firing three
times last week on posts near Teotecancinte, also in Nueva Segovia.
That report also said nothing about casualties.
   Honduras did not comment immediately, but such charges are common
and consistently denied.
   About 11,000 Nicaraguan rebels live with their families in camps
just inside Honduran and their presence has increased tension along
the frontier.

   Two bookstores that sold all their copies
of ``The Satanic Verses'' were damaged by firebombs Tuesday, and the
offices of a New York newspaper that recently defended the book were
wrecked in an explosion.
   Authorities in both cities said they weren't sure the bombings
had any connection to the controversial novel by Salman Rushdie, but
the owner of Cody's Books in Berkeley said he had little doubt.
   ``I can't imagine any other reason why people would be lobbing
bombs through bookstores _ Cody's or anyone's,'' said Andy Ross.
   Molotov cocktails were thrown through the windows of Cody's, a
Berkeley institution that helped nurture the Free Speech Movement in
the 1960s, and a Berkeley outlet of the Waldenbooks chain. Neither
store was badly damaged.
   A firebomb seriously damaged the offices of The Riverdale Press,
a weekly newspaper in the Bronx that published an editorial last
week defending ``The Satanic Verses.''
   The novel has outraged Moslems throughout the world, and prompted
Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to issue a death order for
Rushdie and the book's publishers.
   New York fire marshals said there was ``street talk'' that the
bombing was retaliation for the editorial in the Press, which has a
reputation for feistiness and has twice been nominated for Pulitzer
Prizes for its editorials.
   Richard Stein, co-publisher of the 14,000-circulation weekly,
said he guessed the bombing ``had something to do with something
that was printed in the paper, but I don't know what.''
   Connecting it to the editorial about Rushdie ``is nothing but
speculation,'' he said. ``We have not received any telephone or
written threats. No one has taken credit for this.''
   Similarly, the manager of the Berkeley Waldenbooks, Bob Gammon,
said he wasn't ready to attribute the attack on his store to the
book.
   The Berkeley bombings were reported to police at 4:28 a.m. One
man, Brett Rideout, 44, told officers he was sleeping in his van
outside Cody's when he heard crashing glass and a car roar away.
   A bomb squad detonated one unexploded pipebomb found inside the
store.
   Damage at Cody's was limited to broken glass, a few scorched book
shelves and some damaged books. Ross said he planned to leave a
charred end case in place for a while as a reminder of the incident.
   At Waldenbooks, a plate glass window was broken and a large
circle was burned in the carpet about five feet from the hole.
   Ross estimated damage to his store at ``a few thousand dollars,''
while a glass repairman at Waldenbooks said replacing the broken
window and glass would run close to $1,000.
   Cody's, which is on Telegraph Avenue about a block from People's
Park, is a local landmark. Original owner Fred Cody designed the
store with a corner setback to allow free speech demonstrators in
the 1960s to speak there without being cited for trespassing on a
public street.
   Bookstores throughout the country have been threatened if they
carry the book, but Tuesday's bombings were the first in the United
States since the furor arose over ``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``I've taken the threats very seriously,'' said Ross, who said he
nevertheless won't cancel his order for a new shipment of ``The
Satanic Verses.''
   Gammon said Waldenbooks also had no plan to halt its order for
the book, although he might if he received threats or feared for
public safety. The book sold out the day after the Khomeini's
threat, he said.
   Immediately following the threat, Waldenbooks, the nation's
largest bookstore chain, ordered ``The Satanic Verses'' removed from
display nationwide. The chain later said the decision on displaying
the book would be up to individual store managers.
   ``The firebombing of a bookstore is a very serious First
Amendment issue,'' Berkeley Mayor Loni Hancock said Tuesday. ``We
will take every step possible to protect and defend the safety and
constitutional rights of Berkeley's booksellers and book customers.''
   New York Mayor Edward I. Koch, who went to the scene of the
newspaper bombing, announced a $10,000 reward for help in finding
and convicting the bomber.
   Stein said the paper's insurance adjuster had not yet estimated
the damage to the building, which the Press owns. The Fire
Department described the damage as heavy on the first floor and
moderate on the second.

   A District of Columbia judge rejected
dissenting theologian Charles Curran's suit against Catholic
University of America on Tuesday, ruling the school was within its
rights in barring him from teaching theology there.
   Judge Frederick Weisberg said that in a struggle between academic
freedom and obedience to Pope John Paul II, ``the university may
choose for itself on which side of that conflict it wants to come
down.''
   Curran, a priest strongly criticized by Vatican officials for his
positions on abortion, homosexuality and other matters of sexual
ethics, had argued in court that the school breached his contract by
removing him from the moral theology courses he had taught for years.
   He sought full reinstatement in his lawsuit in Superior Court,
maintaining the university violated his contract as a tenured
professor
   In a written decision, the judge said, ``It is apparent that this
dispute is merely a piece of the larger struggle that has been
raging in Catholic higher education for many years. That struggle
seeks to establish the proper role of academic freedom within an
American Catholic university.''
   Curran said he would not appeal.
   ``I have fought for academic freedom at Catholic University for
more than 20 years,'' he said in a statement distributed by his
lawyers. ``I have lost. As far as I am concerned, this was the last
battle.''
   Later, in a telephone interview, he said, ``I think that Catholic
University was on trial more than I was. ... I think the judge was
wrong.''
   University officials said they felt vindicated.
   ``It doesn't surprise me, to tell you the truth,'' said the Rev.
William Byron, president of the school. ``This is really what I
expected, because we never breached his contract.
   Curran, who had taught at Catholic University since 1965, was
suspended in early 1987 and was formally told last year that he
could not return as a theology teacher. Since his departure he has
taught as a visiting professor at Cornell University and then at the
University of Southern California.
   Catholic University's action against him followed a Vatican
declaration that he was no longer suitable or eligible to teach
Catholic theology because of his dissenting views.
   Curran testified during his seven-day trial in December that
under principles of academic freedom prevailing at American
universities, a tenured faculty member may be removed from his post
only if his colleagues believe he is incompetent.
   University officials testified that their action was proper under
the school's special relationship with the Vatican.
   The Catholic church requires theology professors at the school to
have special authorization called a canonical mission, Cardinal
James A. Hickey, chancellor of the school, testified. The school's
board of trustees withdrew Curran's canonical mission last April .
   Curran contended the canonical mission requirement had fallen
into disuse in the 1960s when he joined the school's faculty. He
argued that he had never had a canonical mission so it could not be
taken away. Curran also said a 1981 church rule making canonical
missions mandatory did not apply to him because it wasn't in effect
when he joined the faculty.
   Hickey said that although the requirement was not spelled out in
church documents in the 1960s, it was ``implicit.''
   Curran said during the trial he wanted to prove ``that in the
last analysis academic freedom itself is for the good of the
church.''
   But Weisberg said in his ruling, ``What is good for Catholic
University or for the Roman Catholic Church is not a question
presented and not one the court has either the right or the
competence to decide. The question presented is whether his contract
gives him the right to teach Catholic theology at Catholic
University in the face of a definitive judgment from the Holy See
that he is ineligible to do so.
   ``The court holds today that it does not.''

   Sixty-nine illegal aliens were arrested as
they prepared to board the same Eastern Airlines flight that
immigration agents had raided on its previous trip, snaring 79
illegal aliens, authorities said Tuesday.
   In the second sweep, at Los Angeles International Airport Monday
night, agents also nabbed a Mexican they described as a principal in
the alleged smuggling operation. The man, whom police did not
identify, was arrested for investigation of transporting illegal
aliens.
   The first sweep had been at Hartsfield Atlanta International
Airport early Monday after Eastern's Flight 80, en route to New York
from Los Angeles, touched down for a stopover.
   U.S Immigration and Naturalization Service officials stressed
that several independent smugglers may have used Eastern's Flight 80
and that the group arrested in Los Angeles was not necessarily
linked to people seized in Atlanta. They also said the chief
smuggling operators remain at large.
   ``We feel like we have a number of individual smugglers who are
utilizing a rather low airfare to move their aliens away from the
border from Los Angeles and on up to the East Coast,'' said Thomas
Gaines, assistant Western District director for the INS.
   At a news conference at the INS' Los Angeles office, Gaines
speculated that the alleged smuggling operation may have gone ahead
Monday despite the arrests in Atlanta because the tickets had
already been bought.
   In Atlanta, the illegal aliens said they paid as much as $4,000
as part of a package deal to help start a new life in New York.
   Of those seized at the Los Angeles airport's Terminal Six, 54
were from Mexico, seven were from El Salvador, four were from
Colombia and four were from Guatemala, said Los Angeles INS Acting
District Director Donald Looney.
   INS spokesman Joe Flanders said most of the people, if found to
be illegal aliens, would be given the choice of going home or
requesting a deportation hearing. Flanders said some might be held
as material witnesses.
   One alien seized in Atlanta, Juan De La Cruz-Rodriguez, 34, said
he had come to the United STates to earn some money to send to his
wife and three young sons in the Dominican Republic. He told The
Atlanta Journal a smuggler in Mexico helped him and a dozen others
cross the border, then arranged to have them transported by flatbed
truck to Los Angeles.
   He said he sold his truck to raise part of the money and gave the
smuggler almost $1,000. Holding up a quarter, he said, ``That's all
I have left.''
   Gaines said the arrests at the Los Angeles airport resulted from
tips, but said the operation was not coordinated with the Atlanta
sweep.
   Tom Thomas, a spokesman for the INS in Atlanta, said thousands of
illegal aliens may have been shuttled across the country on the
daily Eastern Airlines flight from Los Angeles to New York. He said
Flight 80 might have been popular because no transfers were involved
and rates might have been cheaper.
   Gaines refused to speculate on how many people may have used the
flights, but said the technique is not new, recalling at least one
sweep in recent years that netted 200 people.
   Both Thomas in Atlanta and Looney in Los Angeles said Eastern
Airlines was not connected with the investigation.

<HEAD>Bill Would Ban Mailing Steroids</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two senators introduced legislation Tuesday
that would ban the use of the mails to distribute athletic
performance-enhancing steroids.
   ``The use of these potentially life-threatening drugs is one of
the most serious problems facing our nation today,'' Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., said in a statement issued by his office.
   The bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., would
make it a crime, punishable by three years in prison, to use the
mails to distribute anabolic steroids, drugs used by some athletes
to enhance performance.
   Use of the mails to solicit sales of steroids also would become a
criminal offense under the legislation.
   Congress last year banned steroid distribution, but authorities
say some dealers, particularly in Mexico and Europe, are using the
mails and telephone solicitation to get steroids to users.
   The latest legislation would enable postal inspectors to join the
battle.

   Two top Iranian leaders on Tuesday denied
Iranian dissidents were executed after rebels of the Iraqi-based
Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, pushed into the country
last summer.
   Iranian Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi had been quoted
earlier as telling the Paris-based Al-Mostaqbal weekly that: ``All
those were captured or those who joined them were executed.
   ``They had declared war against the people ... they killed and
got killed,'' Montashemi was quoted as saying. ``Any group or people
that raises arms and kills people deserves to be executed.''
   But Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted
Montashemi as saying Tuesday in Tehran that he had not made the
statements, but merely said that a large number of rebels were
killed when they thrust into western Iran in August.
   IRNA quoted Mohtashemi as saying the Al-Mostaqbal report was a
``product of the reporters' imaginings. ... In fact, the issue of
prisoners was not brought up in the interview at all.''
   In Paris, Iranian Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani denied
there were mass executions of Iranian rebel fighters, but said that
up to 5,000 were killed in a battle on the warfront following the
cease-fire with Iraq.
   In an interview on French TV, Rafsanjani said only ``certain''
jailed opponents had been killed.
   ``We have discovered that certain imprisoned hypocrites in Iran
were in contact with their fighting friends in Iraq,'' Rafsanjani
said in reference to the rebels. ``We killed them, but there
certainly were not 1,000. Any competent jurisdiction can easily
prove it.''
   The Mujahedeen Kalq has said hundreds of its supporters have been
arrested and executed inside Iran since an Aug. 20 cease-fire in the
8-year Iran-Iraq war.
   The National Liberation Army, the Mujahedeen Kalq's military
wing, has admitted it lost 1,000 fighters into the brief push into
Iran's Bakhtaran province shortly before the cease-fire.
   The rebels said in a statement sent to The Associated Press in
Cyprus Tuesday that they gave U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez De
Cuellar a list of the names of 1,634 Mujahedeen prisoners executed
by Iran.
   It said those executed were among 12,000 Mujahedeen prisoners
held in various Iranian prisoners. They included students, doctors,
engineers, army officers and a number of high-ranking clergymen.
   The statement said the wave of political executions was
continuing in Iran.

   Slowly but surely, voters filed into Serbian Hall
Tuesday, most of them taking Republican ballots in a precinct where
Democrats once were royal and the local prince was an alderman named
Edward Vrdolyak.
   A Republican now, Vrdolyak has lost two consecutive political
bids and his comeback effort as a write-in candidate for the GOP
mayoral nomination led a Chicago Tribune editorialist to label him
the ``Count Dracula of Chicago politics.''
   Vrdolyak, who represented this Southeast Side ward of heavy
industry and working-class neighborhoods for 16 years as a Democrat,
launched his latest bid less than a week ago.
   And in the neat wood-and-brick community hall on the grounds of
St. Simeon Serbian Orthodox Church, it looked like things were going
his way.
   ``We're going to get several thousand votes, thanks to a lot of
our people supporting me,'' Vrdolyak said, shaking hands with a few
supporters at the hall. ``And to those that aren't, I apologize for
getting into the race late after they have already made commitments,
but we'll get 'em next time.''
   The 10th Ward, with its primarily white, ethnic constituency, has
been loyal to Vrdolyak, a former Cook County Democratic Party
chairman. Some voters say that's because Vrdolyak has been loyal to
them.
   All the mayoral candidates talk about fighting crime and
promoting education, but top Democratic contenders Richard M. Daley
or Mayor Eugene Sawyer, cannot get the job done, said Creita Sadzak,
54, who wrote Vrdolyak in Tuesday.
   ``If Eddie gets in, then Eddie is going to do it,'' she said.
``It's not Fast Eddie any more,'' she said, referring to the moniker
hung on Vrdolyak for years. ``It's Ready Eddie.''
   The GOP endorsed Herbert Sohn, a doctor and attorney who has made
three unsuccessful bids for Congress.
   Whichever Republican is on the April 4 general election ballot,
the prospects do not look good.
   Republicans in this traditionally Democratic city haven't found
their way into the mayor's office since the 1930s.
   Voting for Vrdolyak required writing the words ``mayor'' and
``Vrdolyak'' and putting an ``x'' in a box, which political analysts
predicted would be too difficult for some people.
   Vrdolyak, who lost his GOP bid for circuit court clerk last fall,
countered that the thousands of pieces of instructional literature
sent to likely backers would help him get enough votes to beat Sohn.
   Vrdolyak cast his own ballot earlier in the day at St. Simeon,
which sits on a carefully manicured lot among bungelows in the
shadows of an industrial complex.
   One of the first people voters encountered at the hall was GOP
election judge Patricia Hansen, 53, who said she was Republican even
before Vrdolyak's switch.
   ``I always said, `Why should I be lost among the many when I can
stand out among the few,''' she said. ``I was considered a prominent
Republican.
   ``Now, I'm lost among the many.''

   Drug use among high school seniors last year
dropped to its lowest level since 1975, said an annual survey
released Tuesday. Still, more than half of all students use an
illegal drug at least once before graduating.
   Researchers and health officials said they were particularly
encouraged by results showing the second straight significant drop
in cocaine use and the beginnings of a retreat in use of the
smokeable and highly addictive form of cocaine called crack.
   ``The news is very encouraging,'' said Charles R. Schuster,
director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which sponsored
the study. ``But we don't want to imply that the war is won.''
   ``The problem is there are still pockets, primarily among those
who have dropped out of high school, where drug use remains at very
high levels,'' he said.
   The continued decline in drug use suggests that anti-drug
campaigns educating the young about the hazards of drug use are
being heard, said Lloyd Johnston, a University of Michigan social
psychologist and co-director of the study.
   ``These important successes have been achieved not through supply
reduction. They are due almost entirely to a reduction in demand,''
Johnston said.
   However, he said the 15 percent of youth that drop out before
completing high school present a troublesome issue because ``the
crack problem is particularly concentrated in this population,
especially in the inner cities.''
   Some 16,300 high school seniors from 135 schools nationwide were
polled in the survey. Johnston declined to identify the schools, but
he said they included public and private schools across the
continental United States.
   The survey, which has been conducted by the University of
Michigan's Institute for Social Research every year since 1975,
found that the proportion of high school seniors who reported having
ever used an illegal drug dropped from 56.6 percent in 1987 to 53.9
percent in 1988. That's the lowest level recorded since the survey
began, when the rate was 55.2 percent.
   Peak illegal drug use occurred in 1981, when 65.6 percent of
seniors reported having indulged at least once, according to the
survey.
   The proportion of seniors who reported using an illegal drug
within the previous year dropped from 41.7 percent in 1987 to 38.5
percent in 1988, and the percentage reporting use within the
previous 30 days dropped from 24.7 percent to 21.3 percent in the
same period, the survey showed.
   Although the use of marijuana has been declining since a peak of
27.7 percent in the high school Class of 1979, the 21.4 percent
reported for last year was higher than the 19 percent reported in
the first year of the survey.
   ``One of the most striking figures,'' Schuster said, is the drop
in daily use of marijuana among seniors _ down from 11 percent in
1979 to 2.7 percent last year.
   The proportion of seniors who have used cocaine at least once
dropped from 15 percent in 1987 to 12 percent in 1988, and the
proportion who said they had used cocaine at least once in the
previous 30 days dropped from 4.3 percent in 1987 to 3.4 percent in
1988.
   ``We predicted such a decline in cocaine use would occur once
young people began to see its use _ particularly experimental and
occasional use _ as more risky, and that's what now seems to be
happening,'' Johnston said.
   The survey found more than 89 percent of the Class of 1988
disapproved of even experimenting with cocaine, up from 80 percent
in 1986.
   One troublesome statistic for researchers was that 40 percent of
those who had tried cocaine also have used crack. However, the
proportion of those who said they had used crack at least once
dropped from 5.6 percent in 1987 to 4.8 percent last year.
   Besides marijuana and cocaine, the survey tracked use of
hallucinogens, heroin, sedatives, tranquilizers, stimulants and
inhalants as well as alcohol and cigarettes.
   Alcohol is by far the most widely use of the substances, with
nearly 64 percent of the seniors reporting that they had had a drink
within the previous 30 days. Cigarettes were next with nearly 29
percent having smoked within the previous month and 18 percent
reporting they were daily smokers.
   The survey also showed some regional variations in drug use:
Cocaine use was highest in the West, 12 percent, and the East, 9
percent, compared with about 6 percent in the rest of the country.
Crack use was also highest in the West, 5.6 percent, compared with
2.7 percent in the South and about 2.3 percent in the rest of the
country.
   For most drugs, use was higher among boys. However, use of
stimulants and tranquilizers was slightly more prevalent among
girls, however.

   Amnesty International on Tuesday accused Iraq of
torturing children _ including some infants _ to extract information
or executing them to punish their parents.
   In a 33-page report entitled ``Children: Innocent Victims of
Political Repression,'' the international human rights group said
children held by Iraqi authorities are routinely tortured by
beatings, whippings, sexual abuse and electric shock.
   It said the aim is often to ``force them to reveal information
about their relatives. ... In sum, children and young people have
become the innocent victims of a policy of political repression.''
   ``Opponents and critics of the government have frequently had to
pay a price for their activities in terms of the welfare _ and
sometimes the lives _ of their children,'' it said.
   Amnesty appealed to Iraq to stop the reported brutality and said
it asked the U.N. Commission for Human Rights, meeting in Geneva, to
investigate.
   Amnesty also devoted its March newsletter, ``Focus,'' which
became available Tuesday, to the problem. It details the cases of
Iraqi children allegedly mistreated from about 1983 to 1988.
   In one case, a former political prisoner released in 1985 after
five months' detention at al-Karkh Security Directorate told of the
abuse of his family in prison.
   ``My mother (aged 73), three sisters and three brothers, with
five children aged between five and 13, were arrested and brought in
front of me,'' then beaten on the soles of their feet, the prisoner,
who was not identified, was quoted as saying.
   Amnesty said he added: ``Usually they keep children in a separate
cell next to the mother's or father's cell and deprive them of milk
in order to force the parents to confess. I saw a 5-month-old baby
screaming in this state.''
   The human rights group said children have been lined up and
``summarily shot in public'' and others have been shot to death in
demonstrations in a series of killings of children by government
forces.
   The fingernails of Abd Rahman Ahmad Haji, 17, were pulled out
before his execution in Abu Ghraib Prison in 1985, it said.
   Other incidents reported by the independent London-based group
include:
   _ The repeated breach in spring 1987 of Iraqi law prohibiting the
death penalty in cases involving people under 18 years of age. It
said that among those teenagers killed were a number of supposed
supporters of the outlawed Kurdistan Democratic Party.
   _ The killing of 15 secondary school and university students in
spring 1986 in retaliation for an assassination attempt, reportedly
by Kurds, on a governor in the Abril region.
   Other children have simply disappeared, Amnesty said.
   It said that in 1983, 315 children, some as young as eight, were
among 8,000 male members of the Kurdish Barzani community who
disappeared after the community's forced resettlement.
   The government killed about 8,000 members of the Kurdish minority
in 1988, according to the U.S. State Department. It has also been
accused of a deliberate policy to depopulate Kurdish regions with
poison gas attacks.
   Kurdish rebels fought the central government for autonomy during
the eight-year Iraq-Iran war.

   A slow-moving cold front stirred up thunderstorms, high winds and
at least one tornado in parts of Georgia and Alabama on Tuesday, as
up to 10 inches of snow fell in northwest Montana and lighter snow
fell around the Great Lakes.
   In Georgia, a tornado was sighted in Needmore and a mobile home
was knocked off its foundation in Butler as thunderstorms moved
through the south-central part of the state.
   High winds accompanied the storms in eastern and central Alabama,
overturning a car in Montgomery. South of the cold front, warm and
humid air was trapped over Florida, with gusts clocked at up to 30
mph.
   Light rain fell from eastern North Carolina to the Middle
Atlantic states. Snow was reported from central Virginia to central
New Jersey, but with no significant accumulations.
   A low-pressure system over northern Michigan spread light snow
across northern Wisconsin, much of Michigan and northern Indiana.
Parts of the High Plains, from western Kansas to eastern Colorado
and Montana, also reported 1 to 2 inches of snow.
   Heavy snow occurred in parts of northwest Montana, where 8 to 10
inches of new snow fell near Marion Mountain, west of Kalispell.
Blowing snow limited visibility for travelers. Gusty winds and
temperatures hovering around zero produced wind chills of 40 below
at Minot, N.D., and 31 below at Cut Bank, Mont.
   Light rain fell over the Pacific Northwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from minus 2
at Cut Bank to 84 at Fort Myers, Fla. The morning low for the nation
was minus 9 at Alexandria, Minn.
   Wednesday's forecast called for showers and a few scattered
thunderstorms from South Carolina to Florida. Rain also was expected
in western parts of Washington and Oregon, with snow from the
Washington and Oregon Cascades to the the Dakotas, the upper
Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes and New England.
   High temperatures should range from zero to 10 degrees from
northern Montana to North Dakota and northern Minnesota; from the
teens to the 20s from the northern Rockies to South Dakota, Iowa and
the Great Lakes; the 50s and 60s from most of California to New
Mexico, Texas, the Gulf Coast states and the Carolinas, with highs
in the 70s and above in the southern tip of Texas, Southern
California, the desert Southwest and Florida; and be in the 30s and
40s elsewhere.

   Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial ground to a
halt and was thrown into confusion Tuesday by documents introduced
in court as classified but made available in uncensored versions to
a private activist group.
   North lawyer Brendan Sullivan asked the judge to throw out all 12
criminal charges in the case, asserting prosecutors were guilty of
``a fraud on the defense.''
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said he was ``not trying to
look for sanctions'' against anyone but was concerned about
``getting to the bottom of what's going on'' regarding the use of
classified information at the trial.
   ``My concern is whether this presents an example of looseness in
governmental dealings with this problem of classified information,''
the judge said during a lengthy afternoon hearing. He wondered aloud
whether all the pretrial work on rules for handling such information
would have to be done over.
   He said declaring a mistrial and starting over with a new jury
was ``out of the question.''
   The new stumbling block was the discovery that 10 memos
introduced in the trial with names and other information blacked out
had long ago been turned over, uncensored, to the Christic Institute
in connection with a lawsuit filed several years ago by the group
against North and several other people. The institute is strongly
opposed to administration policy in Central America.
   The memos had been written by Robert Owen to North during a
two-year period when Owen acted as a courier between North and
rebels fighting the government in Nicaragua.
   With the issue far from settled and creating unforeseen
implications for other classified material, the judge ordered that
the jury return Wednesday morning. Sullivan had asked for another
day to argue out of the jury's hearing, saying ``I'm not sure what
the rules are.''
   But Gesell said ``the longer the jury is not in that box, the
more difficult it is to revivify the case. I get very, very worried
about hauling citizens into the jury box all the time and not give
them anything to do.''
   During the three-hour hearing, chief trial prosecutor John Keker
disclosed that an inter-agency intelligence group had decided
Tuesday morning that it would no longer regard the Owen memos as
classified. The same group had censored the documents in the first
place _ after they had been turned over to Christic by Thomas
Hylden, Owen's lawyer.
   Called to the witness stand, Hylden said that at a conference
with prosecutors on Feb. 10, he noticed they were working from a
censored version of one memo and remarked that his copy was uncut
and that he had given a copy to the Christic Institute.
   Michael Bromwich, a member of the prosecution team who was at
that conference, said he called in security expert Allen Stansbury
who told him he would retrieve Christic's copy. But Bromwich said he
then forgot about the matter until the defense raised it late Monday
night.
   Stansbury, the security director of the independent counsel's
office, said he contacted the Justice Department about the Owen
memos having gone to a ``litigant in Florida'' which he now knows is
the Christic Institute. He said he thought of trying to retrieve the
documents but wanted to check further with Justice Department
superiors before doing anything.
   Bromwich said it was his understanding that a document could be
classified even though it was in the public domain already.
   ``For 2 1@2 weeks, a jury has been ready to try this case and
hasn't been able to try it,'' said Gesell. ``Now I hear we are
dealing with classified documents that can be classified ex post
facto.''
   Amid the discussion over government secrets, Gesell sent the jury
home early on Friday, again after the noon recess on Monday and at
the start of the day Tuesday.
   Gesell noted that he had a continuing motion from the defense
relating to ``whether or not a fair trial can be given'' under rules
set by a law governing disclosure of state secrets at trial.
   ``The government is simply unable to manage the classified
information at issue here in a manner that permits a fair trial,''
Sullivan said Tuesday in a motion filed with the court.
   Instead of revealing the ``critical fact'' that the memos had
been made available in uncensored form, he said, the independent
counsel ``hid it and, incredibly, insisted that the court and the
defense treat these already-public documents as classified.''
   Although the dispute went to the heart of the secrecy issues
woven through the fabric of the trial, the specific issue was
mention of the name of a high Costa Rican official, former security
minister Benjamin Piza. It was blacked out in the court document,
but was on the public record in the Christic suit.
   Later Tuesday, the Christic Institute, which strongly opposes
U.S. government policy in Central America, released the documents.
In the Aug. 25, 1985 memo central to the dispute, the fact that it
concerned a meeting with ``Ben and Johnny'' had been censored in the
version at the trial to read ``Costa Rican officials.'' Ben
apparently was Piza, Johnny apparently John Campos. The words
``another Costa Rican official'' masked ``a colonel in the civil
guard, Col. Jose Ramon Mendero Quesada.''
   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel, faces 12 felony
charges, including allegations he lied to lawmakers to cover up his
secret efforts to help the Contras when such assistance was banned
by Congress.

<HEAD>Irish Officials to Shun San Francisco's St. Patrick's Day Parade</HEAD>

   Irish government officials say they will
boycott the city's St. Patrick's Day parade because the grand
marshal is the local leader of an organization that supports the
outlawed Irish Republican Army.
   Parade organizers said the grand marshal was elected by a
cross-section of the city's large Irish community and the
controversy would not dim their celebration.
   Irish Consul-General Brian Nason said neither he nor the Lord
Mayor of Cork, San Francisco's sister city, will attend or
participate in the parade.
   ``It would be like going to a party with the IRA,'' Nason said of
standing on the reviewing platform with grand marshal Dan McCormick
on March 12.
   For years, Irish government representatives have turned their
backs or stepped off the reviewing stand when parade units of Irish
Northern Aid pass by. McCormick is president of the local chapter of
the Irish Northern Aid, a national organization dedicated to
supporting the IRA.
   Controversy erupted in New York City several years ago when
Michael Flannery of Irish Northern Aid served as grand marshal of
that city's parade, the biggest St. Patrick's Day parade in the
United States.
   This will be the first year that officials refuse to attend San
Francisco's parade.
   Despite Nason's declaration, parade officials are determined to
carry on with their plans.
   ``I have no intention whatsoever of making any changes,'' said
parade Chairman Denis Guiney. ``Let the parade continue as it is ...
I do not like politics in the parade ... Under no circumstances will
I be a party to the removal of the grand marshal.''
   Similarly, a spokeswoman for Mayor Art Agnos said Agnos still
plans to ride in the parade.
   ``As far as I know at this time, it's on his schedule to do,''
said spokeswoman Eileen Maloney, calling Nason's boycott ``serious
protocol for them. (But) I don't know what it means to us.''
   ``Generally, in San Francisco's parades a broad spectrum of
political opinion is not unusual,'' Maloney said.
   The Irish Republican Army is an outlawed, predominantly Roman
Catholic guerrilla group that has been fighting for more than 20
years to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the
Protestant-dominated province with the Irish Republic. But
Protestants in Northern Ireland, who outnumber Catholics in the
region, oppose unity with the Irish Republic, which is
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic.
   McCormick was elected grand marshal by a 2-to-1 margin by the
United Irish Societies, a group of about 30 local Irish civic and
cultural organizations.
   Vivian McDonagh, executive editor of the Irishman Newspaper, an
independent monthly publication, defended McCormick as more than a
leader of the Irish Northern Aid. She noted that he is a member of a
fife and drum corps and a former plumber's union official who helped
numerous Irish immigrants land jobs.

<HEAD>Governor Says State Will Pay Costs of Boy's Operation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE RECHT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Medicaid will pay for a bone-marrow
transplant that could save a 6-year-old boy's life, Gov. Judd Gregg
said Tuesday as he tried to defuse embarrassing reports that the
state wouldn't pay.
   ``This is not a new policy,'' Gregg said at a statehouse news
conference called to clarify the state's position on paying for
Derek Annese's transplant. Reports to the contrary were the result
of a ``communications breakdown,'' he said.
   Gregg's assurances apparently silenced the public outcry, but not
the disagreement that arose when the boy's doctor and lawyer were
told it would take private donations to foot the bill.
   Boston Globe reporter Bob Hohler said he stood by last Sunday's
story that became the subject of talk shows and a donation drive.
Hohler said he discussed the case with several state officials,
including Health and Human Services Commissioner Mary Mongan, Gregg
spokesman Brian Grip and state Medicaid Director Phil Soule.
   ``None of them said the operation was covered,'' Hohler said.
``And Soule said it wasn't covered, and when I asked him who changed
the rules two years ago to drop coverage, he told me, `I guess I
did.'''
   But Gregg said the Globe story was ``inappropriate in its
representation'' of the state's position.
   Speaking directly to Hohler at the news conference, Gregg said,
``I can't say that you are correctly reflecting Soule's comments.''
   Gregg indicated that the confusion might have resulted because
the state covers indirect costs associated with a transplant, but
not the actual surgery.
   Ron Eskin, a New Hampshire Legal Assistance lawyer representing
the boy, said there was no breakdown in communication.
   ``I regard that (the governor's statement) as a total reversal of
his position, and that's great,'' he said. ``I'm not criticizing the
governor. I'm just saying we're not all crazy out here.''
   Soule was on vacation and could not be reached for comment
Tuesday.
   The boy and his mother also could not be reached; they were
concluding a vacation at Disneyworld in Florida.
   Doctors say Derek, who lives with his mother and two brothers in
Nashua on about $800 a month on public assistance, needs the
transplant to stay alive.
   About $150,000 is needed to pay for the operation,
hospitalization and other expenses, according to the Globe.
   Gregg said the state waited until Tuesday to go public on the
matter ``until we could get all the numbers.''
   He said the state's Medicaid money will take care of more than
$100,000 for hospitalization and other costs other than the surgery.
   The surgery will cost between $10,000 and $25,000, Gregg said,
adding that he and the Executive Council will use discretionary
funds to help pay some of that amount.

<HEAD>Church Report Asks Tough British Policy on South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British church leaders on Tuesday urged the
Conservative government to adopt a tough policy against South
Africa, including an immediate ban on air links.
   In a report released Tuesday, the leaders said Britain is
encouraging South Africa to believe change is not urgent.
   ``Apartheid will simply reform, adapt and survive,'' it said to
Britain's policy of ``mild diplomatic pressure and waiting for
economic growth.''
   The report was drawn up by the British Council of Churches, the
main representative body of Christian churches in Britain, and a
voluntary organization, Christian Aid.
   British exports to South Africa, official figures show, rose by
nearly 20 percent to $1.4 billion in the first nine months of last
year, compared with the same period in 1987.
   Britain is South Africa's third-largest trading partner, behind
Japan and West Germany.
   The report said Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
largely stuck to the letter of 15 relatively mild sanctions _
ranging from a longtime ban on arms sales to a ``voluntary ban'' on
promoting tourism, but not the spirit.
   ``The message brought home to the South African government is not
that change is urgently needed, but that Britain regards these
measures lightly,'' said the report.
   Mrs. Thatcher argues her policy increased British influence for
change in South Africa. She says sanctions would hurt South African
blacks most, harden white resistance to change, be circumvented and
cost jobs in Britain.
   The church report said the British government encouraged trade
with South Africa.
   ``There have been computer and radar sales which could be of use
to the military,'' it said.
   ``The voluntary ban on the promotion of tourism (agreed in
mid-1986) appears to have been carried out only through the dispatch
of two letters to tourist federations, and is not monitored by the
government.
   ``British Airways heavily advertises its South African flights,
including a link to the United States of America which replaces the
direct flights banned by the U.S. Congress.''

<TEXT>
   Hollywood officials from across the
country made it clear Tuesday that they don't want to pay royalties
to California's Tinseltown for the use of their own name.
   The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce in California is seeking a
trademark on use of the community's name, but 11 other Hollywoods
held a summit here to plot opposition to the ploy.
   ``It's ridiculous. It's really a joke, if you want to know the
truth,'' said Rodney Thompson, a county commissioner from Hollywood,
Md. ``It would have ramifications down the road which would be hard
to swallow.''
   James Ross Dover, representing Hollywood in northeast Georgia, a
rural town that dates back to 1807, was agitated by what he called
the arrogance of the West Coast entertainment enclave, which is
actually a neighborhood within the city of Los Angeles.
   ``My heart's aching from the anxiety that's being caused,'' Dover
said. ``Let's kindle the fire a little bit hotter because I'm hot.''
   Mara Giulianti, mayor of this seaside city of 125,000, organized
the protest after winning a 30-day extension on review of
California's trademark application, which was proposed in 1986.
   California officials say they're aiming only at commercial and
marketing use of the name, but Hollywood, Fla., city attorney Maria
Chiaro said the restrictions could also extend to ``educational and
legislative activity.''
   ``They would own the name,'' Ms. Giulanti explained, wearing a
rhinestone ``Hollywood'' on her jacket lapel. ``Any restriction of
our ability to promote ourselves ... any infringement of our name
should not be allowed and will not be allowed.''
   The Hollywoods represented were in Florida, Maryland, Alabama,
Texas, New Mexico, South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana,
Illinois, and Arkansas.
   The Hollywood representatives agreed to work with trademark
attorneys to force Hollywood, Calif., to prove ownership of the
name, and agreed to draft a resolution for a joint fight and form an
unofficial sister cities program.
   Just to prove that some Californians are sympathetic to the other
Hollywoods, Marian Gibbons of Hollywoood Heritage Inc., the historic
preservation group for Hollywood, Calif., attended to show her
support.
   She carried a letter from the Sunset Plaza Civic Association,
representing about 400 households in the Hollywood Hills.
   ``It is our understanding that trademarks protect one's invention
or creation. It is obvious that the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce
did not create or invent Hollywood, rather the other way around,''
the association wrote to the U.S. Patents and Trademark Office.
   Ms. Gibbons confirmed that Hollywood, Calif., got its name from
an estate near Chicago, where Hollywood is now part of the village
of Brookfield, Ill.
   The Hollywood, Fla., meeting room was decorated with artwork and
essays from grammar school students who wanted to protect their
city's name.
   ``I love Hollywood because I like to shop 'til I drop. I like to
swim in the sea. I also like to go to a candy store. I like the
school the best,'' wrote second-grader Debb Lippman in an essay on
the theme, ``What Hollywood means to me.''
   Hollywood promoters distributed T-shirts and bumper stickers that
said ``We're the real Hollywood'' and a 7-foot costumed egret
attended as the Florida city's mascot.

<TEXT>
   Edward J. Derwinski said Tuesday his
confirmation as head of the new Veterans Affairs Department was
proceeding smoothly despite questioning by Senate panelists about an
incident with a South Korean defector.
   Emerging from a closed-door session of the Senate Veterans
Affairs Committee, Derwinski said his conclusion was based on ``just
my vibes'' and the nature of the committee's questions, which he
said went over old ground.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it was a progressive, positive
meeting,'' Derwinski said. ``I'm perfectly confident that as a
result of this meeting, my confirmation is coming along nicely. I
don't see anything, as a result of this meeting, detrimental or
negative.''
   Derwinski's optimism was shared by the committee's senior
Republican, Frank Murkowski of Alaska, who said the nominee was
``healthy and handles himself well.''
   But chairman Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said he would rather wait
until Wednesday's session before commenting. The committee takes up
the nomination in open session Wednesday afternoon.
   The department is being formed on March 15 by elevation of the
Veterans Administration to Cabinet status. Derwinski has been
nominated for both the jobs of administrator of the VA and the
secretary of the department.
   Derwinski, until recently undersecretary of state of security
assistance, science and technology, has admitted telling the Korean
embassy in 1977 that an agent was about to testify before a House
committee of which he was a member.
   The committee was looking into the ``Koreagate'' scandal in which
the Korean government paid large bribes to members of Congress in
return for favorable action on matters important to Korea.
   The Korean agent, Sohn Young Ho, was spirited away from his New
Jersey home by FBI agents just a half-hour before colleagues from
the Korean Central Intelligence Agency arrived.
   After his congressional testimony, he was placed in the
government's protected witness program under a new identity.
   In 1978, Derwinski denied being the source of the information and
declined to answer grand jury questions. But he admitted it in 1983,
in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
considering his nomination as State Department counselor after 12
terms in the House as a Republican from Illinois.
   Derwinski said he answered all questions ``to the fullest extent
of my recollection.''
   Derwinksi has said it did not occur to him that he could be
putting the agent in danger. He has said he did not even know Sohn's
identity.

   Consumers didn't like them, so R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co. is withdrawing its Premier brand ``smokeless''
cigarettes after five months on market testing.
   Industry analysts speculated that RJR spent $200 million to $325
million to develop and launch Premier, while the aborted national
rollout of the product would have increased the cost to about $1
billion.
   The company said Tuesday in a statement that ``while smokers are
very interested in the concept, the current product has not achieved
adequate consumer acceptance.''
   ``The two primary areas that the test showed us we have to work
on is taste and the aroma,'' company spokesman David Fishel said.
``All I can say for competitive reasons is that we learned a lot in
the test marketing that we will be able to use later on.''
   R.J. Reynolds had test-marketed Premier in Arizona and eastern
Missouri.
   ``They're terrible. They're nasty. They're beyond nasty,'' Mark
Padgett, an employee at a 7-11 store in Phoenix, said shortly after
the cigarette hit the market in October.
   Premier was advertised as ``the cleaner smoke'' because, the
company said, it substantially reduced certain compounds found in
the smoke of tobacco-burning cigarettes and virtually eliminated
cigarette ashes and smoke.
   Several health organizations, including the American Medical
Association, asked the Food and Drug Admininstration to ban sale of
the cigarette. The AMA said Premier was a drug-delivery device, not
a cigarette.
   The cigarette works by heating instead of burning tobacco.
Smokers light a carbon heat source at the cigarette's tip. During
inhalation, air is heated by the smoldering carbon and passed over
an aluminum-encased flavor capsule.
   ``We are pleased to see R.J. Reynolds withdrawing Premier from
the market,'' Dr. James H. Sammons, executive vice president of the
AMA, said in a statement Tuesday. He said the AMA would continue to
pursue its request with the FDA, which has not issued a ruling yet.
   ``This probably makes that a moot petition,'' said Bill Grigg, a
spokesman for te FDA in Washington. Grigg said FDA lawyers would
have to review the situation.
   Last year, Reynolds refused a request from the Arizona Board of
Pharmacy to voluntarily withdraw the cigarette.
   Reynolds said Tuesday that it had no plans to reintroduce Premier
or a similar product ``unless we have fully addressed the issues
raised in the test markets.''
   Fishel said the company had used small groups to test Premier
before moving into the two-state test markets. Asked if the results
of the test-marketing differed from the reaction of small groups,
Fishel said, ``I think that's a safe statement.''
   Reynolds' major cigarette brands are Winston, Salem, Camel,
Vantage, Doral, Century, More, NOW and Ritz.

   The right-wing Likud bloc scored major upsets
over the left-leaning Labor Party Tuesday in nationwide municipal
elections billed by Likud as a referendum on the Arab-Israeli
conflict, initial results indicated.
   In the key race in Jerusalem, pro-Labor Mayor Teddy Kollek was
re-elected to a sixth term but failed to win a majority in the city
council as religious parties doubled their representation.
   Throughout the country, ultra-Orthodox parties scored gains,
repeating their success of the November parliamentary elections.
   In Israel's Arab sector, Moslem fundamentalists ousted the
communist leadership of the second-largest city, Umm el Fahm,
sparking fears that anti-Israeli sentiments are spreading among
Israeli Arabs.
   Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip were barred
from entering Israel Tuesday as an election security measure, police
said. In clashes in the occupied lands, Israeli troops fatally shot
a 25-year-old Palestinian and wounded four others, according to the
army and Arab doctors.
   The death brought to 387 the number of Palestinians killed in the
14-month-old uprising. Seventeen Israelis have also been killed.
   With about 43 percent of the vote counted, Likud appeared to have
won in several Labor strongholds, including the southern port city
of Ashdod and the city of Beer Sheba in the Negev Desert.
   About 48 percent of Israel's 2.7 million voters went to the
polls, down from 55 percent in 1983, as many Israelis spent the
sunny day on beaches and in parks instead of casting their votes.
   At stake were 147 races for local council and mayor. In 1983,
Labor won in 54 towns, compared to 26 taken by Likud. The remainder
went to local slates or religious parties.
   Labor leader Shimon Peres, finance minister, appeared
disappointed. ``There is always a place for soul searching. We'll do
it after we know the final results,'' he said on Israel army radio.
   Labor leaders had insisted that only local, not national issues
were at stake in the vote. But a sweeping defeat would further
accelerate Labor's decline as a national political force. Labor,
once the dominant party in Israel, has failed to win in the past
four national elections.
   Likud minister Ronni Milo claimed victory for his party and
suggested that success on the local level further strengthened Likud
on the national level.
   ``Maybe this is an indication of where Israeli politics are
going,'' Milo, minister for environmental protection, said on army
radio.
   Voters cast two ballots, one for mayor and the second for a party
slate.
   In Jerusalem, Kollek won 64 percent of the vote, while his ``One
Jerusalem'' slate, a Labor affiliate, received about 11 or 12 of 31
council seats, down from 17 in 1983, TV projections said.
   Religious parties more than doubled their votes, from 8.9 percent
in 1983 to 19.6 percent.
   Kollek, re-elected to his sixth term, said he would try to govern
with a minority in the council rather than form a coalition.
   The results ``will not help the proper administration of the
city,'' the 77-year-old Kollek said on Israel television.
   Kollek lost the majority in the council in part because of the
boycott by east Jerusalem's 80,000 Arab voters, traditionally Kollek
supporters. Fewer than 2 percent of the Arabs went to the polls,
compared to 18 percent in 1983.
   The boycott was ordered by the pro-PLO leadership of the
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The
leaders called a general strike Tuesday to enforce the order and
urged Palestinians to punish those ignoring the boycott.
   ``I think each one of the over 3,000 Arabs who (has voted) is a
hero and should be given a medal,'' said Kollek.
   In Tel Aviv, Israel's second-largest city, Mayor Shlomo Lahat of
Likud won re-election to a fourth term with more than 50 percent of
the vote. Religious parties in Tel Aviv increased their vote from 10
percent in 1983 to 15 percent.
   But Lahat vowed that he would not succumb to demands by religious
parties, such as closing places of entertainment on the Jewish
Sabbath.
   In the port city of Haifa, a Labor stronghold for decades, Mayor
Arieh Gurel won 43 percent to narrowly defeat his Likud challenger,
Rami Dotan.
   The victory of the Islamic Movement in Umm el Fahm, a city of
more than 20,000 in northern Israel, sparked concern among Israeli
leaders.
   ``The Islamic Movement is a dangerous movement, and this reflects
what is happening in the Middle East,'' said Uzi Baram, Labor's
outgoing secretary- general.
   Results from other Arab towns were not yet available, but in the
past most have been run by communist or left-wing groups.
   About 10,000 police, civil guardsmen and volunteers were posted
at polling stations in case of violence.
   Police reported 152 election-related incidents, most related to
improper distribution of campaign material or ballot violations.
Twenty-four people were arrested.

   Israeli warplanes struck Palestinian bases
in the Chouf Mountains southeast of Beirut Tuesday, killing two
guerrillas and wounding 34 people, including 26 children at a nearby
elementary school, police said.
   Panicked children aged 4 to 10, some with blood streaming down
their faces, ran screaming and sobbing from the school, a teacher
said. A blackboard in one classroom still listed Tuesday's subject
for discussion: ``The War.''
   Five of the children were critically hurt when rockets exploded
within 25 yards of their school, only yards from a guerrilla base.
In addition, eight other people were wounded in the raid on the
bases by six fighter-bombers.
   The guerrilla casualties were members of the Democratic Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist group that is part of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, said a police spokesman, who
cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   Five of the wounded were militiamen of the leftist Druse
Progressive Socialist Party. They were manning a post near Ainab, a
mountain village 9{ miles southeast of Beirut.
   The air strike coincided with the front's 20th anniversary and
came five days after the guerrilla group lost three fighters in an
attack on Israeli-backed militiamen in south Lebanon.
   The spokesman said the Israeli warplanes struck at 11:28 a.m. and
also hit bases belonging to Syrian-backed guerrilla factions near
the Druse villages of Shemlan, Aitat and Baysour.
   The fighter-bombers swooped down through clear skies for at least
three bomb and rocket runs in what an Israeli military spokesman in
Jerusalem said was a raid on a headquarters of the front.
   Palestinian, Druse and Shiite Moslem fighters fired anti-aircraft
guns at the raiders from positions in the mountains and around
Beirut airport, but no hits were reported.
   ``All our planes returned safely, and the targets were
destroyed,'' the Israeli spokesman said.
   The children were wounded by shrapnel and glass shards when two
rockets exploded within 25 yards of Ainab's government-sponsored
elementary school on the second floor of a two-story house.
   In one classroom, the youngsters were discussing the war as part
of Tuesday's lesson when the jets screamed in, an instructor said.
   ``All of a sudden glass started spraying the room,'' said teacher
Raja Jaber, who suffered head wounds. ``There was panic everywhere.
The children started screaming as blood streamed down their faces.
One of them cried, `Miss, it hurts!'
   The tree-ringed guerrilla base _ a two-story stone house and two
olive-green tents _ took several direct hits.
   Suheil Natour, a spokesman for the front, told The Associated
Press the guerrilla faction will ``step up ... military strikes
against Israel's occupation forces.''
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said the front's attack
Thursday was ``another example of the inability of the PLO to
fulfill its declared statement of stopping terror.''
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said in Washington
that the Thursday incident and Israel's air strike underscored a
need for security arrangements to protect Israelis and Lebanese.
   ``We deplore the loss of life and needless suffering of innocent
people on both sides,'' he said.
   The U.S. designated contact with the PLO, Ambassador Robert
Pelletreau, criticized the Thursday raid as having a negative impact
on the 2-month-old U.S.-PLO dialogue and on prospects for
Israel-Palestinian talks.
   However, Redman said the State Department is still examining
whether the Thursday raid showed PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat broke
his promise in December not to engage in terrorism, which led the
United States to begin direct meetings with the PLO.
   The Israelis have charged that guerrilla raids launched since
then have undermined that declaration. The PLO says Arafat's
renunciation of terrorism does not include halting attacks on
military targets in Israel or Israeli-occupied territory.
   The Israeli raid was the third on targets in Lebanon this year.
By police count, at least 128 people were killed and 356 wounded in
25 Israeli air raids on Lebanon last year. There were no casualties
reported in the two raids earlier this year.
   In Beirut, rival Lebanese military forces on both sides of the
dividing Green Line on Tuesday reopened a crossing linking the
Christian and Moslem sectors that was closed for five years.
Pedestrians and motorists streamed across the Port Crossing, which
zigzags through the war-ravaged harbor area.
   Two other crossings in the center of Beirut have long been choked
by traffic and three other gateways in downtown Beirut and its
eastern suburbs remain closed.

   Richard M. Daley jumped to an early lead Tuesday
as he sought to oust Mayor Eugene Sawyer and capture the Democratic
nomination for the office held by his father for 21 years.
   Following a campaign that many observers found tame by Chicago's
raucous standards, turnout in the primary election was lower than
expected, the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners said.
   The lower turnout appeared to favor Daley, since early
indications from an elections official who declined to be identified
were that black turnout was running about 10 percentage points
behind white voting.
   Daley jumped into the lead in very early returns from
predominantly white wards on the city's Southwest and Northwest
sides. With 23 percent of the city's 2,911 precincts reporting, he
had 122,144 votes or 63 percent to Sawyer's 69,348 votes or 36
percent. Three other candidates divided the remaining votes.
   The Republican primary, normally a non-event in Chicago politics,
was turned topsy-turvy by former Democratic Alderman Edward
Vrdolyak's last-minute write-in campaign. With 16 percent of the
precincts reporting, he had 1,320 votes, or 35 percent, to the
GOP-endorsed candidate Herbert Sohn's 1,748 votes, or 47 percent,
but some precincts were not immediately reporting the write-in
votes. Businessmen William Grutzmacher and Kenneth Hurst each had 9
percent.
   Because of the difficulty of counting write-in votes, the outcome
of the Republican race might not be known before Thursday.
   Adding further to the maneuvering, the two primary winners will
face a third opponent in the general election _ Timothy Evans, a
black alderman who is mounting a third-party bid on The Harold
Washington Party ticket.
   Sawyer needed heavy black turnout in order to duplicate the
victories of the late Harold Washigton, who became the city's first
black mayor in 1983 and four years later, the first since the elder
Daley to win re-election.
   Sawyer campaign manager Reynard Rochon said he was disappointed
with the turnout.
   ``In the last hour and a half of voting, there was a surge in
Sawyer voters,'' Rochon said. ``Whether or not that surge came up
high enough to offset the gap in the turnout between the white and
black votes, we don't know.''
   In both of Washington's primary victories, black turnout was 75
percent, and 98 percent of those votes went to the late mayor.
   Daley, 46, a three-term Cook County state's attorney, was making
his second bid for the seat once occupied by his father, Richard J.
Daley, the legendary big-city boss who died in office in 1976.
   The younger Daley lost his 1983 bid in the Democratic primary to
Washington, who died in office in 1987.
   Sawyer, 54, who had been an alderman for 16 years, was appointed
acting mayor by a bitterly divided council a week after Washington
died.
   A Daley victory Tuesday, followed by another in the April 4
general election, would mark the first time a white has ousted a
black mayor in one of the nation's largest cities. The winner of the
general election will serve until 1991.
   A newspaper poll a week ago had Sawyer gaining on Daley but still
8 percentage points behind. Daley held a 7 percentage point lead in
a late poll sponsored by a local newspaper and television station.
   Thirty-one of the city's 1,406 polling places opened late in
light snow, but skies cleared and temperatures climbed into the 20s.
Tuesday afternoon, a circuit judge ordered the 31 locations to stay
open an exta hour.
   Sawyer voted about 9 a.m. near his South Side home, telling
reporters, ``I'm glad it's finally over.''
   Vrdolyak, 51, voted about the same time at a church in his South
Side ward and Daley cast his ballot about an hour later at a
recreation center a block from his home, saying ``I'm confident
about today.''
   Also on the Democratic primary ballot were former state
legislator James Taylor, 59, Sheila Jones, 38, a disciple of jailed
political extremist Lyndon LaRouche, and Alderman Lawrence Bloom,
who withdrew too late to have his name removed from the ballot.

   More very young children die from murder than
from any other category of injury-caused death, according to a new
study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University.
   The study, released Tuesday, says that from the years 1980 to
1985, a total of 1,250 children under one year of age died of
homicide, a finding that stunned researchers who compiled the
report, said Anna E. Waller of the Injury Prevention Center at Johns
Hopkins.
   ``The rate of homicide for that age group was very steady across
each of the six years,'' she said. ``The data probably has always
been there, but nobody has looked at it in just this way before.''
   Murder accounted for 17 percent of all of the injury deaths among
children in the age group, she said. The homicide death rate for the
infants was 5.68 per 100,000 per year, fractionally higher than for
infants killed in vehicle accidents, the most common type of injury
deaths among all other age groups.
   ``We don't have any good explanation,'' said Ms. Waller.
   Of the 1,250 infants murdered, one-third were reported to have
died of what was called ``child abuse,'' which would include beating
and battering, she said. About 11 percent died of suffocation or
strangulation, 3 percent from drowning, 3 percent from stabbing and
about 5 percent from firearms.
   Ms. Waller said 6.5 percent of the murdered infants died of what
is called neglect-abandonment. This would include babies left alone
or neglected ``with intent to injure or kill.''
   The balance of the infants died of unspecified or unreported
homicide causes.
   Infant homicides were included in a massive study by the Hopkins
group of all types of injury deaths among children.
   Though there were declines in most categories, Ms. Waller said
suicides among children aged 10 to 14 more than doubled from 1980 to
1985.
   ``This is the one category where we saw a great increase,'' she
said. ``It went up each year. It is terribly shocking.''
   Suicides in the 10- to 14-year-old group increased from a rate of
.76 per 100,000 in 1980, to 1.61 per 100,000 in 1985. Most killed
themselves with guns or by hanging.
   ``Some of the increase may be due to a greater willingness to
classify deaths as suicides,'' Ms. Waller said. ``But I don't think
that is enough of an explanation for the increases that we saw.''
   The Hopkins study found that injuries continue to be the leading
cause of death among children under age 14, with such traumas
costing about 10,000 childhood lives a year.
   As a whole, motor vehicle-related accidents killed the most
children. The report said that 22,174 children died in such
accidents during the six years studied, about 37 percent of all
injury-related child deaths.
   Other major causes of death were drowning, house fires,
suffocation, accidental shooting, falls, choking on food or other
objects, poison, electrical accidents and farm machinery accidents.
   Counting all causes, the average injury death rate among children
for the six years was about 19.3 per 100,000.
   For ages 1 to 4, injuries accounted for 44 percent of all deaths.
The rate was 51 percent for ages 5 to 9, and 58 percent for ages 10
to 14.
   In 26 states, injuries received as a passenger in a motor vehicle
were the leading cause of death for children 14 and under.
   For the same age group, house fires were the leading cause of
injury death in 11 states, drowning in 10 states, and pedestrian
accidents in Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.
   In the District of Columbia, homicide was the the leading cause
of death among children up to the age of 14.
   The study was published in the March issue of the American
Journal of Public Health.

   Eight people were charged Tuesday with running a
sophisticated drug ring that exported cocaine to Italy, where it was
traded for heroin that was shipped to U.S. drug dealers, federal
authorities said.
   A lengthy investigation by U.S., Italian and Canadian law
enforcement authorities resulted in the arrests on Monday at seven
locations in the city and on Long Island, law enforcement officials
said.
   The investigation centered on an Italian crime organization
called N'drangheta which is similar in structure to the Mafia and is
heavily involved in shipping heroin into the United States, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew C. McCarthy.
   The crime group imported heroin into the United States paid for
with cocaine, which was smuggled out of the country and shipped to
Italy, where it is in great demand, McCarthy said.
   The drug barter system to a large extent eliminated the trail
that would have been left had cash been used to pay for the heroin,
he said.
   The defendants allegedly shipped at least some cocaine to Italy
through the mail, authorities said.
   Last Thursday, two of the defendants charged Tuesday allegedly
mailed a box containing about 14 pounds of cocaine to Italy.
   However, drug agents who learned of the plan through a wiretap
intercepted the shipment of drugs, authorities said.
   Defendant Vincenzo Restagno, 24, who lives in Toronto, few there
a few days earlier from Italy with $350,000 in Italian currency,
which authorities say was brought to the United States and used to
buy cocaine.
   Searches and arrests, which went late into the night on Monday,
produced numerous weapons as well as drug paraphernalia, officials
said.

   He's known as the flying archbishop, but Roger
Mahony insists his new helicopter is a way to take on the city's
nagging traffic problem, not a takeoff of the 1960s television
series ``The Flying Nun.''
   ``It's part of the Southern California scene now. Traffic is
really a problem,'' said the archbishop, who demonstrated the
$400,000 gift Tuesday with a spin over parts of the
8,762-square-mile Archdiocese of Los Angeles.
   Mahony, 53, who has a helicopter pilot's license and about 140
hours flying time, flew the blue-striped, turbine-powered McDonnell
Douglas 500-D around Van Nuys Airport for about 15 minutes after a
news conference.
   The 160-mph helicopter, blessed by the archbishop and sporting a
St. Christopher medal on the instrument panel, was donated by a
group of businessmen to enable Mahony to better minister to the
nation's most populous Roman Catholic archdiocese.
   The three-county jurisdiction, larger than the nation of Israel,
has 275 parishes and nearly 300 schools in rural agricultural areas,
the Mojave Desert and the urban and suburban sprawl of metropolitan
Los Angeles.
   ``If in fact you could guarantee that every day, any hour, you
could get on the freeways and really go quickly, it would be I think
a little different situation,'' Mahony said.
   The helicopter has generated criticism from some advocates for
the poor who say the money could have been better spent in the
archdiocese, which serves 2.7 million Catholics in Los Angeles,
Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.
   Mahony said he accepted it under the strict condition that
acquisition and operation would not cost the archdiocese anything,
and he blunted the criticism by elaborating on the generosity of the
donors.
   ``Although they do not desire their names to be made public,
nonetheless I must emphasize that each is a major contributor to a
wide variety of church and community projects _ most contributing in
the million-dollar range for our inner-city Catholic schools,
projects for the homeless, hunger programs, and many other
charitable endeavors,'' Mahony said.
   Mahony is seeking landing rights near his downtown residence, St.
Vibiana's Cathedral, and at a number of Catholic high school
football fields. A number of local Catholic hospitals already have
helipads.

   The armed forces on Tuesday

   The armed forces press office said in a statement that the

and run through June 1, when President Jose Napoleon Duarte's term
in office ends.
   It asked the guerrillas to reciprocate ``to comply with the
Salvadoran people's desire to peace.'' It did not say whether the
armed forces would abide by the cease-fire if the guerrillas kept up
their military attacks.
   No immediate response to the announcement came from the rebels'
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN. The government
had no comment on the announcement.
   Political party leaders said late Tuesday they were still
studying the move by the armed forces.
   The gesture came after the five Farabundo Marti commanders said
in a communique that they were willing to discuss peace with Duarte
but rejected the venue and agenda he suggested Sunday night.
   It said the FMLN ``sees as positive Duarte's willingness to hold
talks among the government, our front and the political parties.''
   But it also lamented Duarte's ``invariable design to obtain our
surrender, which is unrealistic, illogical and impossible.''
   ``This design is made very clear by his suggestion of a closed
agenda that does not take into account our proposals,'' it said.
   It was unclear Tuesday if the conflicting positions could be
reconciled. Both stemmed from a Jan. 24 guerrilla peace overture
that called for postponing the presidential election now scheduled
for March 19.
   In addition, the executive branch and the opposition-controlled
legislature were at odds over how to respond to the rebels. The FMLN
has said lawmakers should be part of any peace talks.
   In a separate development, the insurgents announced they have
suspended the use of car-bombs in heavily populated areas because of
the danger to civilians.
   Duarte had proposed that the government and the rebels each
declare a three-month cease-fire beginning Tuesday and that peace
talks start the same day in Guatemala.
   The rebels rejected the venue, saying talks should be ``among and
in full view of all Salvadorans'' on Saturday and Sunday in San
Salvador.
   The insurgents also balked at a long, unilateral cease-fire. They
said they were ready for a cease-fire during the talks but a lasting
truce should be part of the negotiations.
   Duarte said Sunday the cease-fire should be in place before
negotiations begin.
   He said the talks would cover the definitive end of the war;
incorporating of the FMLN into the political mainstream and rebel
recognition of the government armed forces as El Salvador's only
legitimate military institution.
   The guerrilla agenda, reiterated Tuesday, includes reducing the
armed forces from their current level of 56,000 to the pre-war
strength of 12,000.
   They also repeated their demand that the three separate police
forces be disbanded and a single, civilian-controlled police force
be established.
   Military officers responsible for gross violations of human
rights must be tried and punished, the guerrillas said.
   Despite civilian rule, the army remains the country's most
powerful institution. The rebel demands regarding the armed forces
are considered major, perhaps insurmountable, stumbling blocks.
   A 9-year-old civil war has ravaged this Massachusetts-sized
country of 5 million people. An estimated 70,000 people have been
killed, and between 500,000 and 1 million people displaced.
   Washington has provided El Salvador with more than $3.5 billion
in economic and military assistance this decade.
   The State Department called Duarte's address ``the most
significant opportunity ever'' for achieving peace.
   But prospects for the main guerrilla demand _ postponing the
presidential election _ remained slim. The rebels say they would
participate in and respect the outcome of the vote if it were put
off several months.
   They have boycotted and condemned as sham the previous five
national elections this decade.
   The rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, which
controls the legislature and is favored to win the presidential
election, has opposed any postponement of the vote.
   The legislature has also given no indication it would take part
in talks with the rebels.
   Duarte's Sunday proposal has the support of the United States.

<HEAD>First Commercial Reactor Vessel Begins Journey To Washington State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHIPPINGPORT, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The huge pressure vessel from the
world's first dismantled commercial nuclear reactor began its
8,100-mile journey Tuesday to Washington state for burial.
   The 1,000-ton vessel and neutron-shield tank from Shippingport,
the nation's first commercial nuclear plant, left the area about
3:50 p.m. and was expected to arrive in the U.S. Energy Department's
dump at Hanford, Wash., in about 60 days, department spokesman Tom
Bauman said.
   ``Everything went smoothly and there were no problems,'' Bauman
said.
   The vessel and tank were packed in concrete and lifted onto the
200-foot seagoing barge Paul Bunyan in the Ohio River last month.
The trip was delayed until Tuesday because of poor weather.
   The speed of the barge's progress along the route, down the Ohio
and Mississippi rivers and through the Gulf of Mexico to the Panama
Canal and the Pacific Ocean, also will depend on the weather, Bauman
said.
   The reactor vessel was hoisted from its underground site at
Shippingport, about 30 miles from Pittsburgh, on Dec. 14.
   The Shippingport plant was dedicated by President Eisenhower in
1957 and retired in 1982 after generating 6.5 billion kilowatt-hours
of electricity.
   It is the world's only commercial reactor to be dismantled.
Several nuclear plants have been mothballed or entombed.
   The government hopes to show that reactors that have outlived
their usefulness can be dismantled safely and affordably.
   Federal officials intend to remove all radioactive material so
the Shippingport site can be returned to unrestricted use. No
decision has been made as to how to use the land.
   The decommissioning, which has lasted five years, is expected to
be completed by 1990 at a cost of about $98 million.

   The crisis over aging jetliners should mean more
new orders placed with manufacturers, some industry analysts say.
But others ask whether new orders will solve airlines' problems.
   ``At this point, pouring more orders into the funnel isn't going
to make more airplanes come out at the bottom,'' Wolfgang H.
Demisch, an aerospace strategist at the New York office of Union
Bank of Switzerland, said Tuesday.
   ``The greater risk is that in this rush suppliers will be
overstretched and can't deliver as quickly as expected,'' Demisch
said. ``Already there are components in tight supply, and that's not
going to get much easier.''
   Reacting to the Aging Aircraft Task Force's recommendation that
the Federal Aviation Administration order $800 million in mandatory
maintenance, many analysts predicted the pressure to replace older
planes would increase.
   Paul H. Nisbet of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said airlines
saw the need to replace planes several years ago as maintenance
costs began rising and began placing orders accordingly.
   ``I think a lot of orders seen in the last two or three years
have been for replacement,'' Nisbet said. ``Before that orders were
just for traffic growth.''
   Nisbet said that of the 600 to 700 new plane orders he sees in
each of the next few years as many as 200 to 300 will be to replace
older planes.
   ``The replacement cycle has begun,'' he said.
   Boeing Co.'s stock has held firm in the $60 range during the
latest incident involving a plane it built, a United Airlines 747
flying from Honolulu to New Zealand. Its forward fuselage ripped
after takeoff.
   Nine passengers were sucked from the plane and hurled to their
deaths. Investigators have focused on a forward cargo door as a
likely cause.
   George Shapiro of Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York said
consumers haven't blamed carriers or Boeing for the United incident,
the crash of a British Midland Airways 737, which killed 44; or for
the Aloha Airlines 737 which lost part of its cabin in flight,
killing a stewardess.
   ``There's no question Boeing is going through a string of
unfortunate troubles, from crashes, holes developing in its planes
in flight, and with quality problems on new aircraft,'' he said.
   ``But Boeing has more planes out there than any other
manufacturer and they are getting older,'' Shapiro said in an
interview with the Seattle Times.
   Boeing officials have said repeatedly that there is no connection
between the recent spate of accidents, and that their timing is the
result of coincidence and not quality problems on Boeing's assembly
lines.
   Demisch said manufacturers Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus
Industrie already face challenges in meeting commitments already
made. All three manufacturers are enjoying a boom in aircraft orders.
   For some models, orders placed today won't be fulfilled until
1996, he noted.

<TEXT>
   The government suspended constitutional
rights on Tuesday and imposed a curfew throughout the nation as
riots over price increases ravaged Venezuela for a second day and
looting spread.
   President Carlos Andres Perez appealed on television for an end
to the ``incredible tragedy''which, according to police estimates,
killed up to 50 people and injured 500.
   Even as Perez spoke, gunfire was heard in the streets and rioting
and looting continued in the worst violence in 30 years of
democratic rule. Authorities said thousands were arrested.
   In the eastern shantytown of Petare, battles between police and
rioters killed 17 people. Victims were carried down from the hills
to major avenues to be taken to hospitals while crowds watched, said
witnesses.
   Civilians and police exchanged gunfire and shop owners took up
arms to protect their property. The Education Ministry ordered
school and university classes suspended nationwide.
   The curfew was in effect from 8 p.m. Tuesday evening to 6 a.m.,
and beginning Wednesday from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
   Army patrols in Caracas patrolled the empty streets as the curfew
went into effect. Gunfire and explosions were heard as soldiers and
police fought snipers and looters in some neighborhoods in west and
east Caracas.
   The capital looked like a ghost town, with only ambulances and
specially authorized vehicles operating. Army units stood at
strategic downtown corners. Rough estimates said up to 10,000 troops
may have been mobilized in Caracas.
   Maracaibo, San Cristobal, Valencia, Maracay and Puerto La Cruz,
all scenes of rampaging violence earlier, were reported calm.
   Among the rights suspended indefinitely were those guaranteeing
public gatherings, limits on police searches and arrests, and
freedom of expression. The last time that happened was 1964, when
Venezuela was plagued by Cuban-backed guerrillas.
   Riots exploded Monday over increases in bus fares and gasoline
prices, announced in a recent economic package that included higher
prices for food and basic items. Violence began in Caracas and
rapidly spread to other cities.
   The measures, announced two weeks after Perez took office Feb. 2,
were required before the International Monetary Fund would grant
$1.5 billion in badly needed credit. Venezuela signed a letter of
intent for the credit on Tuesday.
   Perez said the riots meant the country was ``risking the
definitive consolidation of its democratic process. ... This is an
incredible tragedy ... Dozens have been killed and (hundreds)
wounded.''
   Perez said the IMF ``is the only option open to a country which
has run out of reserves.''
   Venezuela's operating reserves are down to $1.5 billion,
according to official figures. Bankers say the true level is closer
to $200 million to $400 million, or barely enough for two weeks of
imports.
   For 30 years one of the most politically stable countries in
South America, Venezuela's oil-based economy is now in a deep
recession. Inflation is expected to be at least 70 percent this
year, up from 35 percent last year.
   On Tuesday, Metropolitan Police Inspector Omar Bolivar said the
riots ``are much worse than yesterday. Rioters are better-armed than
we are. They have rifles, pistols, revolvers, even submachine guns
out there.''
   A police commisioner was shot dead by rioters Tuesday and 17
policemen were injured, police said.
   Policemen in Caracas fired shotguns and tear gas to disperse
crowds trying to gather in grocery stores. More than 300 shops and
stores were sacked in Caracas, according to official figures.
   Looting also was reported Tuesday in Valencia, Barquisimeto,
Carora, Puerto La Cruz, San Cristobal and Maracaibo. The casualty
tolls there were not known.
   Gun battles continued Tuesday in San Agustin, a shantytown in
west Caracas.
   One witness described how looters carried 50 cow carcasses from a
butcher shop and hauled off the scales before police arrived.
   Residents sacked and burned one of the city's largest shopping
centers in the wealthy neighborhood of San Bernardino in a scene one
TV reporter described as ``collective madness.''
   ``Some people brought cars and station wagons to carry things
away,'' said a reporter for Radio Caracas Television.
   Officially, bus fares were to rise only about 30 percent _ on
urban routes, for example, from the equivalent of about a nickel to
7 cents. But Transportation Minister Gustavo Rada said some
increases were as high as 50 percent, apparently because of
price-gouging by bus drivers.
   Caracas residents said rising food prices also were to blame.
   ``It was about time something like this happened. People finally
got fed up and came down from the hills to protest,'' said Josefina
Vasquez, a neighborhood leader.
   Others called the looters common criminals taking advantage of
mass confusion.

   President Bush's full-court press to salvage
John Tower's nomination as defense secretary produced no new
immediate pledges of support Tuesday, and Senate Republicans sought
to delay a showdown vote until next week.
   ``I'm working hard at it,'' Bush told reporters at a
picture-taking session during an afternoon Cabinet meeting after he
met privately with a dozen swing Democrats and wavering Republicans.
``I'm committed.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, speaking to
reporters after an evening meeting with Bush, said, ``We're going to
go to the mat.'' He said debate on the nomination would begin
Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, possibly delaying a vote until next
week.
   ``I would assume its going to take more than a couple of days,''
Dole said. ``We need some time to explain our case to the American
people because I sense a change going on.''
   Dole said the confirmation process ``so far ... has not been
fair'' to Tower.
   ``It's our hope we can see the record straight and do a thorough
debate with our colleagues on the Senate floor,'' he said.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking minority member on the Senate
Armed Services Committee, said Republicans planned a full floor
debate to persuade Americans that Bush has the right to his chosen
nominee.
   ``We cannot let this case stand as an example of whether or not
power was tried to be wrested from the president of the United
States by the majority in the Senate just for political reasons,''
Warner said.
   Before the evening meeting, Republican Sen. Larry Pressler of
South Dakota, a wavering senator important to the drive to hold all
45 Senate Republicans in line, announced he was ``very much leaning
against'' confirmation and urged Tower to withdraw before a vote.
   ``I think that he may very well be doing him (Bush) a favor in
this case,'' said Pressler, who said he was fearful that Tower would
not be capable of cleaning up the Pentagon procurement system if
confirmed.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that there
was ``no chance whatsoever'' of the president withdrawing the
nomination.
   ``We're going to fight it out as far as we can. We've convinced a
lot of senators and we hope to convince a lot more,'' said
Fitzwater, who refused to specify what senators had been won over.
   Formal debate on the nomination is scheduled to open Wednesday,
and senators are reading a confidential FBI report on the former
Texas senator's drinking habits, charges of womanizing and lucrative
consulting contracts with military companies.
   Although the White House has sought to portray the report as
clearing Tower of damaging allegations, Democrats have disagreed
with that assessment.
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., who indicated his opposition to the
nomination, said the report is ``overwhelming, it's not a close
call.''
   ``There are names, facts, absolute statements _ the words,
`crocked,' `bombed,' `excessive drinking,' `sloshing,' `stoned,'
`comatose,' too much of that,'' Hollings said. He said the
allegations against Tower are ``recent, credible and overwhelming.''
   A draft of the Senate Armed Services Committee's majority report
that will be presented to the full Senate cited Tower's personal
conduct, including his excessive use of alcohol and indiscreet
behavior toward women, said congressional sources, who requested
anonymity.
   The report also noted that Tower's practice of advising defense
contractors on arms control issues ``shortly after serving as arms
control negotiator created an appearance of using public office for
private gain.''
   ``In aggregate, these concerns led the committee to determine
that Tower's personal conduct, discretion and judgment did not meet
the demanding standards of the postion of secretary of defense,
especially in terms of his suitability to serve in the chain of
command.''
   A draft of the Republican committee members' report, a copy of
which was obtained by The Associated Press, said Tower is ``fully
and ably qualified to serve as the secretary of defense _ the facts
are not and cannot be altered by allegation, rumor or innuendo.''
   The Republican report also said Tower took the ``ultimate step''
in vowing to abstain from alcohol if confirmed by the Senate.
   The committee had been scheduled to meet to review both reports.
But Warner said the session was canceled so that he and Dole could
meet with Bush and Tower at the White House.
   Democrats on the committee still met Tuesday night to review the
two reports.
   Meanwhile, an ABC-Washington Post telephone poll conducted Monday
night showed 52 percent of those surveyed favoring Tower's
confirmation. A similar poll on Feb. 9 had shown only 44 percent
support for the Senate confirming Tower as defense secretary.
   In the latest poll, 44 percent said Tower should not be
confirmed, down from 46 percent in the Feb. 9 poll. A total of 531
adult men and women were polled. The survey had a margin of error of
5 percent, meaning that if everyone adult in the country had been
polled, the results might be up to 5 percentage points different in
either direction.
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a freshman Democrat from Connecticut, said
after meeting with Bush that he was still undecided but that if
possible, Bush ``should be given the benefit of the doubt'' on his
nominations.
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., a swing Democrat who met privately with
Bush in the Oval Office, said he was leaning against the nomination
based on Tower's drinking habits. The former senator has
acknowledged drinking heavily during the 1970s but says he now has
only an occasional glass of wine with dinner.
   Another Democrat who went to the White House, Sen. Dennis
DeConcini of Arizona, said he was somewhat more predisposed to vote
for Tower, but he too expressed concern over Tower's drinking
habits. DeConcini said a reading of much of the FBI report found
``damaging things in there, some outrageous things ... absurd.''
   Bush said he did not know whether he could win over senators who
have indicated opposition to Tower, saying only that ``I hope so.''
   But Vice President Dan Quayle said he believed that all 45 GOP
senators, including Pressler, would vote to confirm Tower. If five
Democrats can be persuaded to vote for Tower, that would allow
Quayle to cast the decisive, tie-breaking vote for the nominee.
   ``We'll take the votes any way we can get them,'' Quayle said,
adding that senators should not vote against Tower simply because he
may have ``stepped on a lot of toes'' during his service as a
``direct, tough, competitive chairman'' of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   With Tower sitting on his left in the Cabinet Room, the president
said he had not heard anyone ``challenge this man's knowledge and
his ability.''
   ``He's the best to do the job that needs to be done,'' Bush said.
``I don't believe that anybody should be pilloried on the basis of
unfounded rumor. I've known John Tower a long time, longer than many
that are criticizing him out there in various walks of life.''
   Senators citing concerns about Tower's drinking habits as the
reason for their opposition drew the ire of at least one leading
Republican _ Deputy GOP leader Alan Simpson of Wyoming.
   ``There are still a couple that still gallop around with a little
bit of grape and grain on their breaths. What a hypocrisy,'' Simpson
said. ``We're not going to sit still and watch this occur. This is
the height of stupidness.''
   Tower sought to allay the fears of his former colleagues, issuing
an extraordinary pledge Sunday to abstain from drinking if he is
confirmed by the Senate.
   With Democrats holding a 55-45 majority in the Senate,
Republicans can ill-afford any defections from their own ranks if
Bush is to prevail in the first high-stakes political showdown of
his 5-week-old presidency.
   Bush invited several Democrats and Republicans to the White House
for a series of one-on-one meetings to discuss the nomination.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who has not
announced his position, did not talk with reporters as he left the
White House. Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., has said he expected Mitchell
will oppose the nomination, which has failed thus far to attract the
public support of any Democratic senator.
   The president held meetings with Sens. Charles Robb, D-Va.,
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, Bill Bradley,
D-N.J., and Bennett Johnston, D-La.
   Tower chaired the panel from 1981 through 1984. The committee,
now controlled by Democrats, voted 11-9 along party lines last
Thursday to recommend the full Senate reject Tower's nomination.

infants ...,'' to ADD that brain-dead infants' organs often not fit for
transplant; SUBS 14th graf to CLARIFY.</HEAD>

   The directors of the national transplant
network on Tuesday adopted a policy discouraging the use of babies
who were born without most of their brains, but are not yet brain
dead, as organ donors.
   However, the board of the United Network for Organ Sharing said
it would be unwise to totally prohibit using anencephalic babies as
organ donors.
   Experts and ethicists have been divided for some time over
whether to transplant the hearts, livers and kidneys of anencephalic
infants into other dying babies, for whom there is an extreme
shortage of organs.
   Anencephalic infants are born with only part of a brain stem,
which controls respiration. Because they do have slight brain stem
activity, they are not legally brain dead, which is required before
organs can be removed.
   By the time such infants are brain dead, their organs often are
not fit for transplantation because of infection.
   Half of the 1,000 to 2,000 anencephalic babies born each year in
the United States are stillborn. The other half generally die within
one week.
   Only one anencephalic child has ever had its organs removed for
transplantation in the United States. That case, on Oct. 16 1987,
involved a Canadian donor and recipient and was performed at Loma
Linda University Medical Center in California.
   The heart recipient, a boy who was born the day of the operation,
is at home and doing well, said hospital spokeswoman Anita Rockwell.
   Loma Linda has had a moratorium since August on cases involving
infants suffering from the incurable birth defect.
   Anencephalic infants reportedly have been used, with family
consent, as organ donors in Canada, Europe and Japan.
   ``What the recommendation says is that people, for the time
being, approach the use of infants with anencephaly with extreme
caution, that it would not be wise to use any such baby as an organ
donor until a consensus has been reached about how to pronounce
death in a newborn,'' Art Caplan, director of the Center for
Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota, said in a
telephone interview from Minneapolis.
   Caplan was part of an ethics committee that recently presented
the recommendation to the network's 32-member board of directors.
The Virginia-based network administers the National Organ
Procurement and Transplantation Network.
   The board adopted the position during a regular meeting in New
Orleans. Members include doctors, organ procurement officials,
ethicists, theologians, lawyers and health-care finance
administrators.
   The board concluded that a moratorium would not be wise because
it would preclude organ donations by anencephalic infants who are
brain dead and whose parents strongly desire to donate their child's
organs, said Dr. Jeremiah G. Turcotte, chairman of the ethics
committee.
   The board said further study is needed and could prompt a
re-evaluation of its position.
   Brian Broznick, director of the Pittsburgh Transplant Foundation,
said there likely would be enough organs for the 400 to 500 children
awaiting liver transplants in the United States if anencephalic
infants were used as donors.
   ``We could probably take care of all those kids, and we can't do
anything about it,'' Broznick said. ``It's a real sad situation.''

<HEAD>Five Reported Killed In Rocket Attacks In Eastern Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long-range artillery fire and rockets
blasted residential areas in Afghanistan's eastern Nangarhar
province, killing five people, state-run Radio Kabul said Tuesday.
   The broadcast, monitored in Islamabad, said some victims were
killed in the provincial capital of Jalalabad, about 40 miles west
of the Pakistani border. Rockets also fell in Rodat and Mazina,
southeast of Jalalabad, it said.
   The attacks reportedly occurred during the previous 24 hours. The
radio blamed them on ``criminals,'' an apparent reference to
U.S.-backed Afghan rebels.
   Also in eastern Afghanistan, Moslem rebels shelled a communist
radio station after it broadcast repeated taunts and insults, a news
agency said.
   Agency Afghan Press, a private Pakistani news service which
favors the resistance, said the rebels prepared to attack troops
holding the besieged city of Khost on Feb. 24 but communist
``agents'' leaked the plans.
   The radio warned Khost residents that ``troublemakers'' were
preparing to attack.
   ``Abuse and filthy language were repeatedly used against the
mujahedeen (holy warriors) in the broadcasts, and the puppet
administration kept on posing the challenge,'' the agency said.
   Rebels responded by blasting the station with ``half a dozen
shells'' from a heavy gun and the radio has been silent since, the
agency said.
   It said 24 mujahedeen were killed in fighting last week around
Khost. It gave no figures for communist casualties.
   The guerrillas, headquartered in Pakistan, have been waging a
decade-long battle against Afghanistan's ruling communists.
   Moscow ended nine years of military intervention in Afghanistan
on Feb. 15. The Soviet Union sent troops into the Central Asian
country in December 1979 to replace one communist government with

<HEAD>`Free James Brown' Song Sent to Radio Stations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A local record producer and a songwriter are
deluging the nation's radio stations with a pop-funk single calling
for the release of soul singer James Brown from prison.
   Brown, the 55-year-old, self-proclaimed ``Godfather of Soul,'' is
serving a six-year sentence in a South Carolina prison on an array
of charges stemming from a two-state chase Sept. 24.
   The song ``Free James Brown'' was picked up by 386 ABC-affiliated
radio stations last week, and 1,700 copies of the single were being
sent to other stations nationwide this week.
   ``Free James Brown'' calls for the release of Brown, and includes
such verses as ``Butane James ... the man has too much soul.''
   Record producer Ron Deutschendorf said he has spent nearly $5,000
getting the song recorded and distributed. He and songwriter Robert
Lusson hope the record will start a movement to have Brown released
or transferred to a halfway house.
   Brown is known for such songs as ``Papa's Got A Brand New Bag''
and ``Living in America.''
   ``James Brown is a national treasure,'' Deutschendorf told USA
Today. ``He was instrumental in the development of pop music. I
don't think they would have treated Elvis this way.''

   Administrators at Big East schools
adamantly opposed Playboy's attempts to recruit students to pose for
its pages, but the magazine succeeded and the results hit the
newsstands Tuesday.
   Administrators at all nine Big East Conference schools, six of
which are Roman Catholic, barred Playboy photographers from
interviewing on campus and did not allow advertising in campus
publications, said Elizabeth Norris, a spokeswoman for the
Chicago-based magazine. Some area hotels also prohibited interviews.
   ``All this publicity just backfires on the schools by getting the
word out,'' she said, adding that sales have been known to increase
as much as 600 percent in areas featured in an issue.
   She said Playboy expects to exceed the standard monthly
circulation of 3.4 million issues, but would not specify how many
extra issues had been prepared.
   The Big East Conference comprises Boston College, Georgetown
University, Providence College, St. John's University, Seton Hall
University,and Villanova University _ all Catholic schools _ and the
University of Connecticut, University of Pittsburgh and Syracuse
University.
   ``It's such a strange way to represent your school,'' said Cathy
Liathead, a 20-year-old junior at Seton Hall in South Orange. ``The
students don't really support it, but I don't think anybody believes
anything should be done against them.''
   One of the models in the issue, Kimberly Adamonis, 22, of Rhode
Island's Providence College, said she is proud of her decision. She
said her boyfriend, now her husband, encouraged her to go to the
Playboy interview.
   ``I do respect Providence College, but you've also got to have
dreams and ideals for yourself,'' she said.

<HEAD>Younger Daley Struggling to Escape His Father's Long Shadow</HEAD>

   Richard M. Daley is short and stocky and, on
occasion, stubborn. Unmistakably his father's son.
   But as he stands within striking distance of the fifth-floor City
Hall office occupied for 21 years by his father, the late Richard J.
Daley, he can proudly say he got there the old-fashioned way _ he
earned it.
   To be sure, he has benefited from the name, the lucrative
assignments while he was a young attorney in private practice, his
election to the Illinois Senate at age 29, and the successful bids
for three terms as Cook County's top prosecutor.
   But the 46-year-old Daley, who defeated Mayor Eugene Sawyer in
Tuesday's Democratic primary, has suffered because of the name as
well. Critics have dogged his every step up the political ladder,
suggesting his achievements have been little more than an accident
of birth.
   ``If his name wasn't Richard Daley, he'd be working in the Post
Office,'' said Rob Warden, editor of Chicago Lawyer.
   Both assessments miss the point, said Eugene Kennedy, a Loyola
University professor, veteran political analyst and author of
``Himself,'' a biography of the elder Daley.
   ``There is an old Chinese proverb that says, in essence, `Grass
grows short under a big tree.' And plenty of sons are considered
failures when measured against their fathers,'' said Kennedy.
   ``The truth is, there's nobody like his father. ... But Rich has
acquired a confidence in himself and his judgment that resemble the
father in some ways. And he's overcome enough adversity on his own _
the loss of a young son, the loss in his first (mayoral) run in 1983
_ to establish a separate identity, to start the long climb out from
under his father's shadow,'' Kennedy said.
   The eldest of seven children, Daley cut his political teeth
working as an 18-year-old page for the Illinois delegation to the
1960 Democratic National Convention.
   Twelve years and a law degree later _ he passed the bar exam
after a third try _ Daley's political career began in earnest in the
Illinois Senate.
   He was criticized in his early years, labeled ``his father's eyes
and ears.''
   But Daley showed more acumen than many gave him credit for,
forging cautious alliances with reformers _ opponents of his
father's vaunted Democratic machine _ and championing social-welfare
legislation affecting nursing homes and abolishing taxes on certain
foods and medicine.
   His father's death in 1976 _ several months into a sixth term _
caused an irreparable rift in the political organization the
longtime mayor had so zealously guarded.
   As a result, four years later, the younger Daley ran for Cook
County state's attorney as an outsider against Alderman Edward
Burke, the party's endorsed candidate.
   Daley clobbered Burke, then twice won re-election as the county's
top prosecutor. Along the way, he proved himself a savvy campaigner,
able to use his name and his father's cronies, but receptive to new
ideas and alliances.
   That knack he may have gotten from his father.
   State Sen. Howard Carroll, who was a law school friend, recalled
that Daley carried a dictionary ``so he could look up any word he
didn't know.
   ``And while he was looking up that word, he'd always look for
another word he didn't know on the same page so he could learn a new
word,'' said Carroll.
   ``I think he got that from his father.''

   Barnett's remains have already been taken to California, the

<HEAD>Supervisors Vote To Seek Court Order Halting `Aryan Woodstock'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAPA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Napa County supervisors voted Tuesday to seek
a court order halting a so-called ``Aryan Woodstock,'' an outdoor
concert on private land planned for Saturday by white supremacists
and skinheads.
   After an emotional hearing attended by about 150 people, the
board decided to ask county District Attorney Jerry Mautner to seek
a temporary restraining order blocking the event.
   Mautner's office said the district attorney may seek the order as
early as Wednesday.
   Tom Metzger, director of the White Aryan Resistance, told the
board the event would be on private land and would be by invitation
only. He said some 2,000 people have been invited to listen to such
bands as the Boot Boys and Hammerhead.
   The issue, he said, is simple: ``Shall we have freedom of speech
and assembly or shall we not?''
   Choking back tears, Golda Lerman of Napa told the board she lost
much of her family to the Nazi Holocaust of World War II.
   ``I grew up with the legacy you people caused,'' she said,
referring to the concert sponsors. ``I have no aunts, no uncles.
   ``I believe in the freedom of speech and the right to assembly,
but not the right to violence against minorities,'' she said.
   Legal opposition to the concert is based on a rarely-used 1971
county ordinance requiring a permit for outdoor concerts. No permit
has been issued for Saturday's event.
   The concert is set to be held on a 70-acre private ranch being
leased from Dr. Howard Lonsdale, a prominent physician in nearby
Vallejo. He has declined comment on the event, and his receptionist
said he ``doesn't want to be bothered about this issue.''
   Sheriff's spokesman John Volpe said a stage is under construction
at the concert site, which he said was ideal for such an event
because it's out of the way and the noise will not disturb anyone.
   ``It's just another day in the battle,'' said Metzger. ``We just
go from one step to another.
   ``If you block (such events) from private land, where else is
there but the streets?'' he said, adding that he dislikes marches.
   ``But what alternatives do you give people?'' Metzger asked.
``We're going to have some speeches, we're going to have some music,
and we're going to go home.''

<HEAD>Trader Fined $1.125 Million, Banned From Board Of Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade has levied a $1.125
million fine against a man convicted of devising a scam that
involved wearing disguises to back out of ill-fated deals in the
trading pits.
   Thompson Sanders also was banned for life from the exchange, but
his attorney says he'll appeal.
   The commodity exchange's decision comes four months after a
federal judge sentenced Sanders to six years in prison and fined him
$300,000 for masterminding a scheme that involved disguising a
trader in a wig and makeup to make illegal transactions in the
Treasury Bond pit.
   Prosecutors said that because of the disguises, Sanders and three
others were able to pocket more than $300,000 from good trades while
backing out of losing trades without detection.
   The BOT fine of $1.125 million imposed on Sanders is the maximum
penalty that exchange rules allow for his 15 rule violations.
   At the time of his conviction, U.S. District Judge Marvin Aspen
said Sanders' crimes represented ``the tip of the iceberg'' and that
because of loose regulations, the BOT was a potential ``cesspool''
of corruption.
   Since disclosure last month of the FBI investigation into fraud
at Chicago's futures exchanges, the BOT has increased the maximum
fine from $75,000 to $250,000 per violation. The BOT also has
extended the period during which former members could be subject to
discipline, from 30 days to five years.
   In addition, the exchange said it would spend $1 million to
improve its computerized surveillance system.
   Sanders, free on $300,000 bond, has appealed the criminal
conviction. He also will appeal the BOT decision on grounds that the
board does not have jurisdiction over him, said his attorney,
Stephen Senderowitz.
   ``Sanders is not a member, nor was he at the time he was charged
in the criminal case or in the exchange disciplinary proceeding,''
Senderowitz said.

   Experts on treating alcohol abuse have these
words of advice about Defense Secretary-designate John Tower's
pledge of abstinence: Believe it when you see it.
   Marc Hertzman, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at
George Washington University, said it is easy and common for heavy
drinkers to take the pledge, but rare for such vows to be kept.
   ``Let's assume that only a very small part of what has been
rumored about the gentleman has any validity to it at all,'' said
Hertzman. ``The notion that he could just stop is about 180 degrees
counter to anything that anybody knows about the problem of dealing
with drinking alcohol.''
   Tower, whose nomination to become secretary of defense comes
before the Senate this week, has admitted to having been a heavy
drinker in the past. But in an extraordinary television interview on
Sunday, he vowed not to drink ``beverage alcohol of any type or
form, including wine, beer or spirits of any kind'' if he is
confirmed to the Cabinet position.

   It seemed Bush's purpose in more than 18,000 miles of travel was
simply to touch base with other leaders and reaffirm friendly
relations. There was no sign of any new initiatives.
   Over five days, Bush zipped through Tokyo, Beijing and Seoul,
pumping hands and posing for pictures with more than 20 foreign
leaders in dramatic settings. The only time Bush stood still was
during a three-hour appearance at the funeral of Emperor Hirohito.
   Not everything came off quite as planned: The White House script

   The growing numbers of homicides of infants and
suicides among 10- to 14-year-olds are matters of ``special
concern'' in the United States, according to a survey of childhood
injury deaths.
   Homicide is the leading cause of injury death among children
under age 1, and suicide among children aged 10 to 14 increased by
112 percent from 1980 to 1985, a team of Johns Hopkins University
researchers report in a study released today.
   Though the rate of injury deaths continues a decades-old trend
downward, the report said they continue to surpass disease as the
major killer of the young.
   As a whole, motor vehicle-related accidents, including bicycles
and pedestrian-victims, are the major killer of children. The report
said that 22,174 children died in vehicle accidents during the six
years studied. This is about 37 percent of all injury-related child
deaths.

   Alarms that have wailed in Rancho
Seco's control room are silent, but the problem-plagued nuclear
power plant is in the midst of perhaps its worst crisis just months
before voters will decide its fate.
   Utility operators are struggling to convince voters that a $400
million overhaul following a December 1985 accident made the plant
safe and efficient.
   But Rancho Seco, which restarted last year after a 27-month
shutdown, has been idled four times during the past three months by
mechanical problems. The latest shutdown, caused by the failure of
an auxiliary water pump on Feb. 1, isn't expected to be lifted
before early March.
   Critics say the recent performance shows that Rancho Seco, which
has had more than 100 outages since it opened in 1974 and until
recently was rated one of the nation's 10 worst nuclear plants, has
flunked a probationary measure passed by voters last June. The
measure gave operators a temporary reprieve to fix problems before
another vote to decide the plant's fate. The vote is scheduled for
June 6.

<HEAD>New United Church Head Nominated In Transitional Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A United Church of Christ committee has chosen
the Rev. Paul H. Sherry of Chicago as its nominee for the presidency
of the 1.7 million-member denomination as it enters a transitional
period.
   The long-term post is an influential office among America's
mainline Protestant bodies.
   Filling it comes as new ecumenical strides and headquarters
changes are being considered by the historic denomination whose
roots go back to the early American Pilgrims.
   Sherry, 55, who heads a church-renewal organization in Chicago,
was nominated after a year long search by a nominating committee
from among six finalists.
   The results were announced last week by church headquarters here.
   He was nominated to succeed the Rev. Avery D. Post, 66, who plans
to retire this fall after holding the top office for 12 years, or
three four-year terms.
   The election is to be at the biennial meeting of the
denomination's general synod June 29-July 4 in Fort Worth, Texas.
Other nominations may be made from the floor of that top
deliberative body, involving more than 700 delegates.
   They also are to consider recommendations that the church move
its headquarters from New York to Cleveland, which some agencies are
resisting.
   Delegates also are to act on a proposal for full communion with
the 1.2 million-member Christian Church (Disciples of Christ),
providing for mutual recognition of members, ministry and
celebrations of the Lord's Supper.
   Picking a new president also comes amid friction between an
evangelical wing wanting more emphasis on winning souls to Christ
and a long-predominant liberal wing stressing work for social
justice.
   The denomination, a 1957 merger of the Evangelical and Reformed
Church and Congregational Christians stemming from the colonial
Puritans, also is grappling with an ``identity problem'' to shape a
more distinctive image.
   The 18-member nominations committee began its search in January
1988, after Post disclosed he would not run again. It initially had
a pool of 46 potential candidates, 39 men and seven women.
   They were suggested by various sectors of the church across the
country. The list had been pared down to five men and one woman who
were interviewed at the committee's meeting in Cleveland.
   Concerning Sherry, the Rev. Patricia Ross of Portland, Ore., who
chairs the nominating committee, said, ``We feel he brings just the
right combination of experience, skills and visiion to lead our
denomination into the 1990's.''
   The committee also nominated Doris R. Powell of Berkeley, Calif.,
for another national office, director of finance and treasurer.
   Sherry, in a statement, said of his stance:
   ``I am committed to reach out to all people, whatever their
background or circumstance; to nurture the church's congregational
and institutional life; to hold high the ecumenical vision and to
help build a society of peace with justice.''
   Sherry has been executive director since 1983 of Chicago's
church-related Community Renewal Society, managing a staff of 55 and
a current budget of $3 million.
   It aids congregations and community groups, does social-justice
advocacy work, runs training workshops for ministers, lay leaders
and theological students, and a camp and center for children.
   Sherry, who has been a host on religion talk shows in Chicago and
New York, travels extensively as a guest speaker. He previously
worked in New York for the church's domestic missions arm, the Board
for Homeland Ministries.
   Earlier he had served seven years as a parish pastor in Hasbrouck
Heights, N.J., and Reading, Pa.
   Ms. Powell, 38, was nominated from a pool of 15 candidates of
whom three were interviewed, to replace Charles Lockyear of
Pleasantville, N.Y., who is finishing seven terms _ 28 years _ as
church treasurer.
   She currently is studying theology at Berkeley's Pacific School
of Religion and previously was manager of accounting systems for
Suntec Industries, Inc., in Rockford, Ill., for four years.
   She earlier had worked for seven years as a budget analyst and
accounting supervisor for Sundstrand, Hydro-Transmission Division in
Ames, Iowa. Before that, she was a certified public accountant in
her native St. Louis and Detroit.
   The six finalists from whom Sherry was chosen included two
blacks, the Rev. W. Sterling Cary, 61, of Westchester, Ill, and the
Rev. Yvonne V. Delk, 49, of Union City, N.J., head of the church
social-action arm since 1981.
   The other three were the Rev. Robert G. Kemper, 53, of Western
Springs, Ill.; the Rev. Otto E. Sommer, 58, of Yarmouth, Maine, and
the Rev. Frederick R. Trost, 53, of Madison, Wis.

<HEAD>Ronstadt's Tribute to Mexican Roots on PBS Special</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Linda Ronstadt has sung rock, country, standards
and even opera once, but she found yet a new style on a recent tour,
singing an evening's worth of songs only in Spanish.
   Even people who didn't understand a word of Spanish enjoyed the
show, thanks to Ronstadt's involved performance, the colorful
staging and the mariachi band and singers who performed with her.
   ``Canciones de mi Padre'' (``Songs of my Father'') is also a
record album that recently won a Grammy Award as ``best
Mexican-American performance.'' Ronstadt sang a selection on the
nationally televised Grammy Awards show.
   Now ``Canciones de mi Padre'' is a television show, airing Friday
as part of PBS' ``Great Performances'' series.
   ``It was important to structure the show so you wouldn't have to
understand Spanish or anything about Mexican culture,'' said
Ronstadt, who says she understands every word she sings, but doesn't
speak conversational Spanish.
   Does the television special mark the finale of Ronstadt's
``Mexican phase?'' She says an emphatic no. ``I'm never going to
stop doing it. It's great music. There's a huge amount of it. I just
scratched the surface.
   ``Mexican music is the first music I ever heard and learned.''
   Mexico provides much of Ronstadt's heritage. At the beginning of
the TV show, she is pictured with her father, though he isn't
identified. Both he and she were born in Tucson. She says, ``Some
say that part of Arizona was stolen from Mexico. I'm one of the ones
who thinks it was stolen. His father was born in Mexico. My family
has been ranchers for generations in the Sonora Desert region.
   ``My great-great-grandmother was born in Mexico, too, in the San
Gabriel Valley. That's now California. The U.S. got away with
California, too.
   ``This Mexican culture is pretty firmly ensconced out here.
People have a tendency to forget that.''
   The fact that Ronstadt sounds like a German instead of a Spanish
name doesn't mean somebody changed the name, the singer says.
``Mexico is a melting pot like the United States. There was a
migration of French; they ruled Mexico awhile. There was a migration
of Germans when they discovered mining. My great-great-grandfather
was a mining engineer from Germany. He married a Mexican woman whose
family had been there a long time.''
   Mexican music has a lot of long-held notes and falsetto breaks.
``I grew up listening to this. I learned how to do it,'' Ronstadt
says. ``I used some of it on the end of `Blue Bayou.'
   ``I've been fooling around with this music a long time. I've been
figuring out a way I could record it and present it to North
Americans.''
   First, she and her father wrote ``Hasten Down the Wind,'' which
she sang, mainly in Spanish, in American pop style. ``What I wanted
to do was traditional Mexican _ stop fooling around and not make any
concessions at all to the pop market,'' she said. ``I wanted to do
it with original arrangements and bands I loved. And I did it, and
it worked. I thought it was strong enough to bridge the gap.''
   She says, ``If you listen to country music out of Texas there's a
great similarity. It is rural music. A lot of vocal tradition is
shared by American and Mexican country music.
   ``And Roy Rogers' cowboy suit _ the embroidery, yoked shirt and
flared pant legs _ is Mexican, a regional style in northern Sonora.
People don't know that.''
   All costumes and stage design are Mexican, Ronstadt says. ``I
didn't want anything Hollywood or Broadway. I thought what was there
was so rich it couldn't be improved on.''
   Ronstadt isn't the only singer in her family. Her father's
sister, Luisa Espinel Ronstadt, who used her first two names
professionally, was a singer, dancer and movie actress in the 1920s.
Her picture is shown on the TV show.
   ``She died in the 1960s, but she used to come and visit. She
taught us how to do the shimmy and play castanets and roll our eyes
at the boys.''
   One of Ronstadt's sisters, her brother and his 18-year-old
daughter sing harmony on the TV show.
   Now, Ronstadt is making plans to perform a show in Los Angeles
where she'll sing in three styles _ rock 'n' roll, standards set to
Nelson Riddle arrangements, and Mexican songs. That definitely won't
be a tour, she laughs. ``It's too expensive. I have to have an
orchestra and two different bands.''

<HEAD>Pope And U.S. Archbishops Meeting To Iron Out Relationships</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: This first of two articles about next week's papal discussions
with U.S. archbishops deals with problems on the American scene. A second
article, looking at Vatican talks with other national heirarchies, is BC-Vatican-Bishops,
moving as b0614 for Sunday, March 5</HEAD>

   Intended to ease strains between the Vatican and
U.S. Catholicism, an extraordinary summit meeting convenes next week
between American archbishops and Pope John Paul II.
   He calls the concentrated four days of talks a ``fraternal
encounter.'' Archbishops say they expect a friendly, mutually
cooperative mood.
   ``This isn't shaping up as a confrontation but rather as a
helpful exchange of views among church leaders looking for ways to
work together effectively,'' says Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of
Chicago.
   Several of the earlier tensions have faded, but others remain,
such as the handling of dissent from church regulations and the
status of the bishops' national organization itself.
   ``That, in a way, is perhaps most important,'' says the Rev.
Thomas J. Reeske of Washington, D. C., whose research has made him a
leading authority on attitudes of U.S. bishops.
   He added in an interview:
   ``The issue is whether episcopal conferences have the right and
authority to teach and make decisions that have an impact on the
life of the church in the United States, or whether all the
decisions are to be made in Rome.
   ``The trend has been toward centralizing decisions in Rome.''
   Differences with the Vatican both on approaches to dissent and
the rights of the bishops' national conference showed up only at
their meeting last November.
   The Vatican intervened to get them to postpone acting on their
document, ``Doctrinal Responsibilities'' on dealing with dissent.
Also, the bishops disapproved a Vatican draft, minimizing the role
of bishops' conferences.
   It was returned as unsuitable even as ``a basis for discussion.''
   The bishops and the Vatican also temporarily differed over makeup
of the summit meeting itself. They, in 15 regional sessions last
fall, had elected representatives to attend, but the Vatican said
no, it wanted only archbishops.
   That was ``another slight'' of the bishops' conferences, Reese
said, adding their elected representatives would have had ``some
kind of mandate,'' but that's not directly the case with the
archbishops.
   Twenty-one of the 35 U.S. participants in the March 9-11 Vatican
meeting were appointed by the present pope. The agenda says they'll
have more than 12 hours of open discussion with him and heads of his
cabinet, the Curia.
   The theme, in generalizing Vatican terminology, is
``Evangelization in the Context of the Culture and Society of the
United States of America with Particular Emphasis on the Role of the
Bishop as Teacher of the Faith.''
   The opaque language refers to the impact of Christian values on
society and culture, a special concern of the pope. Examining that
``big picture ought to be a positive thing,'' Reese said. ``The
danger is the talk will just be in the abstract.''
   Reese of Woodstock Theological Center at Washington's Georgetown
University, has individually interviewed the country's archbishops
for his forthcoming book, ``Archbishop: Inside the Power Structure
of the American Catholic Church,'' to be published in May by Harper
&amp; Row.
   He predicted ``conflict will be minimal'' at the Vatican meeting.
   On various matters, such as the pope's insistence on individual
confession before first communion and his criticism of a previously
extensive practice of giving general absolution without confession,
Reese said:
   ``The bishops have sort of caved in. It's no longer a big
problem. On a lot of issues, the bishops' conference has given up
its way of doing things. Basically it's doing what the Vatican
wants.''
   Bishops, at the Vatican's behest, banned special services for a
homosexual organization, Dignity, in many dioceses. Under Vatican
and other criticism of a document on AIDS, the bishops last spring
decided to write another one.
   Other issues also have receded since U.S. bishops first suggested
the meeting in 1986 when their then president, Bishop James Malone
of Youngstown, Ohio, cited ``a growing and dangerous disaffection''
from the Holy See.
   That was at a time of extensive resentment at the Vatican's
curtailing authority of Seattle's Archibishop Raymond Hunthausen,
since restored.
   Differences still persist _ though now partly mollified _ between
U.S. Catholic educators and Vatican proposals for closer church
supervision over Catholic colleges and universities.
   Of the upcoming meeting, the pope has said it will deal with
impressions both of his 1987 visit to the United States, and a 1988
series bishops' visits with the pope.
   Several bishops say the visits had a mostly positive, upbeat
tone. The pope is bullish on the U. S. church, says Archbiship John
L. May of St. Louis, president of the National Conference of Bishops.
   However, the pope has pressed his insistence on doctrinal
conformity, saying of the U.S. scene:
   ``Certain positions on the so-called `right to dissent' have had
harmful repercussions on the moral conduct of a number of the
faithful. There is a tendency on the part of some Catholics to be
selective in their adherence to the church's moral teaching.''
   The pope also says he wants ``more systematic efforts'' on behalf
of natural family planning, more emphasis on the church's ban on
contraception, widely practiced among U.S. Catholics, and efforts to
revive weekly Mass attendance, now down to an average 52 percent.

<HEAD>Pope Setting Pattern Of Direct Dealing With Bishops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   During his 10-year pontificate, John Paul II
has summoned Dutch bishops to Rome in an attempt to settle a serious
rift and called Brazilian bishops over liberation theology. Now it
is the Americans' turn.
   More than 30 U.S. archbishops and two Eastern rite metropolitans
will take part in a special four-day meeting at the Vatican March
8-11.
   The initiative for the meeting came from the Americans in 1986,
when relations between the U.S. church and the Holy See appeared
particularly tense. But in the end it was the pope who wanted the
meeting held, according to Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro.
   After the pope's visit to the United States in 1987 and a series
of private talks at the Vatican involving American bishops last
year, the U.S. side no longer believed the special meeting was
necessary, Navarro said.
   ``But the pope insisted on the idea,'' he said.
   While the whole range of issues involving the church in America
is likely to be discussed, the main theme is expected to be the role
of bishops.
   ``What bishops should be doing, out preaching the Gospel in a
secularized society, is what I believe the meeting is about,'' said
one senior Vatican official, speaking on condition his name not be
used.
   He said the pope does not want bishops to be managers, but rather
ardent proponents of church teaching.
   Speaking out on unpopular issues may be difficult, the official
said, but added that in the pope's view ``if we keep saying that
you'll never get anywhere.''
   It was the pope's concerns about the leadership roles of bishops
that led him to convene a synod of Dutch bishops in 1980 and summon
21 members of the church hierarchy from Brazil, the world's largest
Roman Catholic country, in 1986.
   John Paul has also announced a special synod of bishops from
Africa, the continent where the church has experienced its most
rapid growth. The date and location must still be fixed.
   Vatican officials are also not excluding meetings with bishops
from other countries where there are particular problems or ferment.
   ``Such meetings with bishops should be seen as a natural thing,''
said Navarro.
   Each country has its special problems, he pointed out, adding
``there's no prescription for all the countries of the world.''
   During his pontificate, John Paul has revived the practice of ad
limina visits, or visits by bishops to the Vatican every five years.
That largely fell into disuse under Pope Paul VI. John Paul clearly
likes to deal directly with his prelates to get his message across,
just as he likes to go directly to the people through his
pilgrimages abroad.
   The pope summoned the Dutch bishops to Rome because the church
was split into conservative and liberal factions over issues such as
celibacy and the role of women in the church. The meeting was
classified as a synod, a more formal gathering than the Brazilian
and U.S. meetings in that it requires follow-up action by the
bishops and the Vatican.
   While there is no evidence the synod has dampened dissent among
Dutch Catholics, a series of papal appointments has given the
conservative factions control of the leadership.
   The Brazilian church was also divided between progressives and
conservatives, although the leaders generally support liberation
theology, which emphasizes the church's commitment to the poor. The
Vatican has condemned some forms it says resemble Marxism, and the
pope told the prelates they should not try to substitute for
politicians.
   The meeting ended with a joint statement by the prelates and the
Vatican stressing the importance of unity and pledging full
adherence to church teaching.
   Navarro said the U.S. meeting should not be viewed as
confrontational and that he didn't expect the pope to review the
past. Making a business analogy, Navarro said John Paul would take
the approach of a corporation head asking his people ``where do we
go from here.''
   The pope delivered his major address of the September 1987 U.S.
pilgrimage to bishops in Los Angeles, challenging them to crack down
on Catholics who dissent from church teaching. He called it a
``grave error'' to believe that one could differ with church
teaching and still consider oneself a ``good Catholic.''
   The Vatican has consistently rejected challenges to its teaching.
It recently criticized theologians who question the church ban on
contraception, in an attack apparently directed at 170
German-speaking theologians who signed a letter disagreeing with the
Vatican on the issue.

   The economy will slow substantially in 1989 and
rising inflation and higher interest rates are likely to topple the
country into a recession before the end of 1990, the nation's top
business economists predict.
   The National Association of Business Economists said Monday that

   National Semiconductor Corp. said it
is selling its mainframe computer retailing business to Hitachi Ltd.
and a unit of General Motors Corp. for $398 million, a deal one
analyst called ``a great move'' for National Semiconductor.
   In announcing the sale Monday, the chip maker said it broke off a
tentative agreement with a Dutch company, Memorex Telex NV, for half
of National Advanced Systems.
   Hitachi, which will own 80 percent of the joint venture that is
buying National Advanced Systems, will gain a greater presence in
the U.S. mainframe market dominated by IBM, analysts said. National

Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and federal securities regulators are
nearing an agreement aimed at settling the largest Wall Street fraud

   The sides are said to be still haggling over whether the
investment firm must move part of its high-profile, big-money ``junk
bond'' financing division run by trader Michael Milken from Beverly
Hills, Calif., to New York.
   But Drexel has agreed to tighten internal controls to prevent
future securities law violations, to hire a consultant to monitor

   Johnnie Walker scotch plans to put its own
version of a personal ad on billboards in California.
   Starting in mid-March, Johnnie Walker ads featuring a tanned
bathing beauty photographed from the back will cover extra-large
billboards in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas.
   ``My number is 415-391-3365. And I drink Johnnie Walker,'' the
ads in San Francisco will say.
   Callers will hear a recorded 40-second message from ``Susan'' who
says she liked Johnnie Walker ``on the rocks overlooking the surf at
Big Sur'' and who would ``love to go out and do some dirty dancing.''
   In the Los Angeles area, the ads will list a number in the 213
area code, and callers will hear ``Julie'' say she likes Johnnie
Walker on the rocks ``overlooking Laguna Beach'' and is ``crazy
about country rock, rollerskating in Venice, Tchaikovsky at the
Hollywood Bowl and slam-dunking at the Forum.''
   There also will be versions of the ads featuring a male model in
each city. Print ads based on the billboard approach are planned for
regional editions of magazines, including People, Esquire and Time.
   Schieffelin &amp; Somerset Co., the New York-based importers of the
scotch, plans to spend $3 million on the campaign in California,
which accounts for about 17 percent of the nation's scotch sales.
The campaign may be expanded to other markets later.
   John Morrell, a marketing executive for Johnnie Walker, said the
appraoch was designed as a parody of the personal ads and dating
services.
   He said the idea of posting a message on a billboard ``allows
outdoor (advertising) to be something that it hasn't been before.''
   Leo Greenland, chairman of Smith Greenland, Johnnie Walker's ad
agency, said the ads are designed ``to give the consumer a little
fun and involve them in our message.''
   He said that if people start talking about the ads, he hopes
liquor retailers will give Johnnie Walker more display space,
awareness of the brand will improve and sales will pick up.
   Morrell said combined sales of Johnnie Walker Black Label and Red
Label make it the second best-selling brand in the country behind
Dewar's scotch.
   One ad in the company's current campaign features two
swimsuit-clad women running on the beach with the headline, ``He
loves my mind. And he drinks Johnny Walker.'' The ads have generated
complaints of sexism and bad taste.
   But Morrell defends the company's approach and denies the ads are
sexist.
   ``We are on the leading edge, and there will always be a small
group of people who don't like a particular execution,'' he said.

   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich reported a loss of
$71.5 million in the fourth quarter of 1988, despite a $137 million
gain from the sale of the publishing company's magazine subsidiary.
   The loss compared with a profit of $81.4 million, or $1.36 per

<HEAD>No Dramatic Changes Planned For Spun-Off Footware Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The management of a group buying the United
States Shoe Corp.'s footwear division for $422.5 million says
dramatic changes are not in store for the Cincinnati-based division.
   The footwear division will retain its existing management, U.S.
Shoe's corporate headquarters and distribution facility in the city
as well as the U.S. Shoe name, officials said Monday.
   Division President Howard Platt, who will become president and
chief executive officer of the new shoe company, said the
acquisition by a group headed by Merrill Lynch Capital Partners
Inc., an affiliate of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc., should not
result in any job losses among its 8,000 employees.
   ``We're not planning any reductions in the work force, other than
what occurs through the normal course of business,'' Platt said.
   The purchase excludes U.S. Shoe's Cincinnati-based LensCrafters
division, which operates retail eyeglass stores, and its women's
apparel retail division, based in Enfield, Conn., which operates the
Casual Corner, Petite Sophisticate and Caren Charles chains.
   These divisions will be retained by the former U.S. Shoe, which
said it will choose a new corporate name.
   U.S. Shoe shares fell $5.75 Monday to close at $20 in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading. It was the Big Board's
second-most-active issue.
   Analysts said the company's announcement failed to live up to
expectations by some that the entire company would be sold.
   Although the domestic shoe industry has been hurt in recent years
by foreign imports, U.S. Shoe's footwear business has positioned
itself as one of the industry's strongest players through a
combination of domestic and foreign production, he said.
   The division operates about 500 retail stores under the Hahn and
Bannister store name and through leased departments. It owns 20
women's shoe brands, including Calvin Klein, Capezio, Red Cross,
Selby, Liz Claiborne and Pappagallo.
   In 1988, the footwear division, which operates about 20
manufacturing and distribution facilities in the U.S., accounted for
about one-third of U.S. Shoe's $2.2 billion in sales and 57 percent
of the the company's $52 million in profit.
   The division's domestic production represents about 10 percent to
15 percent of the total U.S. production of moderately priced shoes,
Platt said.
   Platt said the buyout won't mean any slowdown in the division's
ongoing modernization program.
   He said Merrill Lynch's offer was the best of several bids
submitted for the shoe operation. He declined to say what other bids
were submitted.
   But each bidder specified that the division's current management
remain in place. ``This is a financially led buyout as opposed to a
management-led buyout,'' he said.
   About 35 division executives will be part of the ownership group.
The exact percentage of the company they will own won't be known
until Merrill Lynch completes its financing.
   Merrill Lynch has commitments for $160 million of equity and debt
financing and says it is ``highly confident'' it will secure the
remaining financing through senior bank debt.
   Completion of the sale is expected in about three months.

   The dollar rose against most major currencies in
calm European trading late this morning. Gold prices fell.
   Traders said the dollar was being sustained by short-covering, or
the buying of dollars to fulfill agreements to sell them, ahead of
the 8:30 a.m. EST release of U.S. fourth-quarter gross national
product figures.
   Traders also were buying dollars ahead of congressional hearings
by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   The market was expecting preliminary GNP figures to show a modest
2.5 percent increase in U.S. economic growth in the final three
months of last year, slightly up from the original estimate of 2
percent growth.
   Traders said a neutral or worse-than-expected figures would be
bearish for the dollar because of an underlying downward trend.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7390 from $1.7440 Monday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8289 West German marks, up from 1.8150; 1.5597
Swiss francs, up from 1.5495; 6.2270 French francs, up from 6.1775;
2.0649 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0490; 1,347.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,339.62; 1.2005 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2025.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.15 yen to a closing 127.15 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 127.23 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $386.70 a troy ounce,
down from $389 bid late Monday. At midmorning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $386.75.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $386.65, down from $390.25 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $4.09 to close at a bid $388.85.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $5.86 a troy

   Stock prices plunged across the board on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange today, and the dollar gained sharply against the
Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 166.72-point
loser Monday, lost another 300.17 points, or 0.94 percent, closing
at 31,985.60. On Thursday, it had closed at a record high of
32,452.49.
   Dealers said the federal discount rate hike in the United States
was the direct cause of the share prices' drop today, but concern
about whether stock prices were overheated also held back buying.
   Mike Morizumi, an analyst at Merrill Lynch's Tokyo office, called
today's fall ``a technical correction.''
   ``Investors seem to have used the U.S. discount rate hike as an
excuse to hold back from buying,'' he said. ``But the discount rate
hike was well anticipated and its effects have already been
discounted in share prices.
   ``Rather,'' he said, ``there was concern about constantly rising
stock prices, and it was actually an ideal timing for the market to
make the adjustment.''
   In the foreign exchange market, the dollar opened at 127.00 yen
and ranged between 126.92 and 127.20 yen before closing at 127.15
yen, up 1.15 yen from Monday's close. It had lost a total of 1.15
yen on the three previous trading days.
   Exchange dealers said the dollar's firmness resulted mainly from
expectations of rising U.S. interest rates.
   Higher U.S. interest rates make dollar-denominated investments
more attractive to foreign investors.
   On Friday, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its discount rate, its
charge for loans to private financial institutions, from 6.5 percent
to 7 percent out of concern over inflation in the American economy.

   Five former Du Pont Co. employees
threatened to sell secret documents on synthetic fibers to a
competitor or begin production themselves if the chemical giant
didn't pay them $10 million, authorities said.
   Four of the five were arrested on extortion charges Monday in
Switzerland in a hotel parking lot after they failed to meet with Du
Pont officials and an undercover FBI agent where an exchange was to
take place, said FBI agent Joseph V. Corless.
   Du Pont had planned to turn over a bogus $10 million check for
the documents, which deal with the production of Lycra, the
company's trade name for spandex fiber used in clothing such as
swimming suits, leotards and pantyhose.
   The suspects also were to sign a contract agreeing not to produce
spandex fiber for five years, Corless said.
   The five had worked at the Du Pont plant in Mercedes, Argentina,
one of several plants that make spandex. Du Pont was contacted about
the documents in December. Four of the five had quit since
September, authorities said.
   Those arrested were Bruno Skerianz, age unknown; Raul A.
Giordano, 36, operations supervisor for Lycra production; Antonio R.
Inigo, 39, maintenance supervisor for Lycra production; and Maria I.
Lorenzo de Bianchini, 39, secretary of the Lycra information office,
authorities said.
   Corless said Ms. de Bianchini had the most access to the
documents.
   Skerianz, who worked at the plant about 20 years ago, was
believed to be the ringleader and recruited the others while they
were working for Du Pont. The others had been Du Pont employees for
13 or 14 years.
   A warrant was issued for Jose M. Petrosino, 44, specialist
engineer for Lycra processing, who remained at large.
   William Carpenter, an assistant U.S. attorney, said the five have
been charged with one count each of attempted extortion and if
convicted, face up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   There are being held by Swiss authorities, and the United States
will seek extradition, Corless said.
   Corless said the documents were recovered, but he admitted there
were no guarantees that copies had not been made.
   ``Considering Du Pont was willing to pay, we hope there are no
more copies,'' he said. ``We still have a lot of investigating to
do.''
   John R. Malloy, Du Pont spokesman at its Wilmington headquarters,
said, ``The information was very valuable and probably would have
enabled them to set up a competing plant.''
   After the suspects contacted Du Pont, several meetings were held
inside and outside the United States, and telephone calls were made
to discuss the documents, Corless said. Skerianz met with Du Pont
officials in Wilmington and offered to sell the company certain
spandex technology, the FBI said.
   Corless said that Skerianz refused to bring the documents to the
United States, but Du Pont officials examined the approximately
1,000 documents at a meeting in Milan, Italy, in January.

<HEAD>Critics Say Nuclear Plant Has Flunked Voters' Test</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alarms that have wailed in Rancho
Seco's control room are silent, but the problem-plagued nuclear
power plant is in the midst of perhaps its worst crisis just months
before voters will decide its fate.
   Utility operators are struggling to convince voters that a $400
million overhaul following a December 1985 accident made the plant
safe and efficient.
   But Rancho Seco, which restarted last year after a 27-month
shutdown, has been idled four times during the past three months by
mechanical problems. The latest shutdown, caused by the failure of
an auxiliary water pump on Feb. 1, isn't expected to be lifted
before early March.
   Critics say the recent performance shows that Rancho Seco, which
has had more than 100 outages since it opened in 1974 and until
recently was rated one of the nation's 10 worst nuclear plants, has
flunked a probationary measure passed by voters last June. The
measure gave operators a temporary reprieve to fix problems before
another vote to decide the plant's fate. The vote is scheduled for
June 6.
   ``The current outage, and the several experienced over the last
two months, demonstrate that Rancho Seco has failed its test,'' says
Karl Ory of Campaign California, a group formed by Assemblyman Tom
Hayden and actress Jane Fonda. Other critics include
environmentalists and some ratepayers who say the plant is too
costly to operate.
   Officials at Sacramento Municipal Utility District, the operator,
acknowledge that further problems could persuade voters to close the
plant permanently.
   ``I do not think it (recent problems) has been fatal, but I can
assure you that if we have a couple more of these, it will be
fatal,'' said Joseph Firlit, the plant's chief executive officer.
   Plant spokesman Kerry Shearer says Rancho Seco has won praise
from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for improvements since the
1985 overcooling accident and claims that last year's restart was
one of the smoothest in the industry. The NRC acknowledged the
improvements by taking Rancho Seco off its list of 10 problem plants
last December.
   The agency had placed Rancho Seco on the list after the
overcooling accident, the most serious of the many woes that have
plagued the 913-megawatt plant.
   Federal investigators said a power outage to control room
instruments and employee errors allowed the reactor vessel to cool
180 degrees in 24 minutes _ well beyond the 100-degrees-per-hour
limit designed to prevent cracking of the steel vessel, which could
drain cooling water and trigger a meltdown.
   The vessel didn't fracture, but two workers were exposed to
radiation and the plant vented radioactive steam over Sacramento
Valley pastures 25 miles southeast of the capital.
   The accident plunged the municipal utility into deficits, led to
the downgrading of its credit rating and led to a hike in rates to
cover the increased cost of buying electricity from outside
suppliers. Several managers were replaced as the utility struggled
to convince regulators that the plant was safe enough to reopen.
   The NRC said managers should have anticipated the accident
because there had been similar failures of control systems at other
plants constructed by the builders, Babcock &amp; Wilcox Inc. The
company also designed the Three Mile Island reactor that had the
nation's most serious commerical nuclear accident, in March 1979.
   Two months after Rancho Seco was restarted, it barely survived a
ballot initiative sponsored by critics to shut it permanently.
Instead, voters narrowly approved a measure sponsored by the
utility's publicly elected board to keep Rancho Seco open pending
the second vote.
   The measure also requires closure of the plant at any time
beginning this year if it fails to operate at more than 50 percent
capacity for four consecutive months. That could be difficult for a
plant that's generated an average of only 40 percent of its intended
output of electricity since it was built.
   The utility said it exceeded 50 percent in January, which critics
deny, but there's no debate over February, when Rancho Seco didn't
generate a watt.
   Recent evaluations have been mixed. A study by the Institute of
Nuclear Power Operations uncovered unsafe working conditions,
management deficiencies, equipment failures and inadequate training,
but it praised Rancho Seco for a reduction of administrative
``burdens'' and ``high morale and a positive attitude at all
levels.''
   An NRC staff report has recommended a $100,000 fine for
violations from 1983 to 1986, including release of radioactive
effluents. Plant officials said they would not oppose the fine and
noted that the violations predated the overcooling accident and
subsequent modifications.

<HEAD>VRA Extension Needed to Avoid More Steel Dumping, USS Head Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government should extend the current
limits on imported steel to avoid more dumping of the metal on U.S.
markets, a leading steel industry executive says.
   The current voluntary restraint agreement is to expire at the end
of September, and a five-year extension has been recommended to the
Bush administration.
   Without the renewal, President Thomas Graham of USX Corp.'s USS
Division said Monday, overseas steel producers will invade the U.S.
market.
   ``There's no doubt that foreign producers will revert to
large-scale dumping of heavily subsidized steel'' without a
restraints renewal, he said. ``We certainly can't tolerate a return
to past practices.''
   In the third quarter of 1984, shortly before the restraints
began, imported steel made up just more than 30 percent of the U.S.
market.
   Graham's comments came during the opening day of the week-long
annual congress of the Society of Automotive Engineers.
   He said the voluntary restraints renewal is essential if the U.S.
steel industry is to continue its two-year financial recovery.
   ``We can't afford to become giddy,'' he said. ``Two years of
profitability doesn't offset five years of losses.''
   Graham said the U.S. steel industry earned more than $2 billion
in 1988 and about $900 million the year before. But between 1982 and
1986, the industry lost $12 billion, an average of $2.4 billion
annually.
   The voluntary restraint agreement, which began in 1984, limits
the amount of imported finished steel to 18.5 percent of the U.S.
market, among other things. The American Institute for Imported
Steel said steel made overseas and shipped to the United States
accounts for about 17.7 percent of the market, below the current
limit.
   The imported steel association, which supports an elimination of
the restraints or a two-year extension instead of five years, has
claimed that the limits reduce supply thereby increasing prices for
U.S. steel, something the domestic steelmakers like.
   But Graham dismissed that contention.
   ``It's not an issue of protectionism,'' he said, ``it's an issue
of legal trading practices.''
   Graham also said USS is prepared to file legal papers if the Bush
administration rejects a voluntary restraints extension.
   ``We need enabling legislation from Congress before the Bush
administration has the ability to act,'' he said. ``We see ourselves

   He declined to say when any legal moves may be taken, adding that
an earlier agreement barred the industry from filing trade
litigation while a voluntary restraint was in effect.

<HEAD>Economic Growth at Sluggish 2 Percent in Late '88</HEAD>

   The economy grew at a sluggish annual rate of 2
percent in the final three months of 1988 as the worst deterioration
in the trade deficit in more than two years offset unexpected
strength in consumer spending, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product, the
broadest measure of economic health, advanced at its slowest pace
since the final three months of 1986. It grew 3.8 percent in all of
1988.
   The slowdown in growth was accompanied by a pickup in one
inflation measure. The GNP deflator, which measures a changing
marketbasket of goods, rose at an annual rate of 5.3 percent in the
last quarter of the year. That contrasted to an increase for all of
1988 of just 3.4 percent.
   The Federal Reserve last week launched another round of
credit-tightening in an attempt to get inflation under control.
   However, critics contend that given the sluggish growth of the
economy, the higher interest rates are likely to topple the country
into a recession.
   The GNP estimate of 2 percent for the fourth quarter was
unchanged from a report issued one month ago, but the overall number
masked a number of cross-currents in different sectors of the
economy.
   Consumer spending, propelled by a hefty jump in spending for
big-ticket items such as cars, rose by 3.5 percent in the final
three months of the year, almost one full percentage point above the
previous estimate.
   But this increase was offset by a quarterly trade deficit $9.4
billion higher than the July-September period as a 7.7 percent jump
in exports was swamped 13 percent rise in imports.
   It marked the second consecutive quarterly widening of the trade
deficit, heightening fears that improvements in the trade gap have
stalled out.
   For the year, the GNP rose by 3.8 percent, the best annual
performance since a 6.8 percent rise in 1984. The annual figure was
unchanged from the initial estimate last month.
   For 1989, the Bush administration is counting on strong economic
growth of 3.2 percent to generate higher government revenues and
help to reduce the budget deficit without the need for a tax
increase.
   However, many private forecasters are looking for a much smaller
GNP increase this year and higher interest rates, because of the
Federal Reserve Board's inflation-fighting efforts.
   Those factors could well doom the Bush administration's hopes of
driving the budget deficit below $100 billion.
   The 2 percent GNP increase for the fourth quarter followed a 2.5
percent third-quarter rise and was the slowest quarterly increase
since a 1.4 percent rate in the final three months of 1986.
   The fourth quarter figure was depressed by the lingering effects
of last summer's severe drought. Without the drought effects, the
economy would have expanded at a faster 3.1 percent rate.
   The 5.3 percent rise in the GNP deflator, which measures changing
consumption patterns, followed a third-quarter increase of 4.7
percent. In the second quarter last year, prices shot up at a 5.5
percent rate.
   There have been a rash of reports in recent weeks showing
inflation is picking up momentum, including government estimates
that both wholesale and retail prices climbed sharply in January.
   Those reports triggered the Federal Reserve last week to tighten
up further on credit, including a boost last Friday in the discount
lending rate for financial institutions, the most dramatic signal
the Fed can send of its intentions to push interest rates higher.
   The central bank is attempting to engineer a ``soft landing'' in
which growth slows enough to control inflation but the economy does
not weaken so much that the country heads into a recession.
   Some economists said they were doubtful that the central bank
would succeed.
   ``We think the odds are moving towards a recession,'' said David
Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass.,
forecasting firm. ``We are getting to a dangerous stage of the
economic cycle. The Fed is trying to slow things down and it is very
easy for the Fed to overdo it.''
   Wyss, however, said his firm still was not forecasting a
recession, predicting instead that the GNP will expand by 2.6
percent this year.
   That would be down from a 3.8 percent GNP growth rate for all of
1988, the best performance since the economy surged ahead at a 6.8
percent pace in 1984.
   The Bush administration has based its first budget on an
assumption that the economy will expand by 3.2 percent this year.
While the higher growth makes it easier on paper for President Bush
to lower the budget deficit without raising taxes, many private
economists scoff at the administration's forecast.
   They have also accused the administration of using unrealistic
interest rate projections, especially in light of the drive by the
Fed to tighten credit in an effort to slow borrowing demands.
   The National Association of Business Economists released a new
quarterly survey on Monday which pegged 1990 as the most likely year
the next recession will start.
   The economists for some of the country's largest corporations
predicted that economic growth for 1989 will slow to an annual rate
of 2.7 percent but only one in five expected a recession to begin
this year. But 73 percent of the analysts said the economy will be
in the soup by the end of 1990.
   ``The business economists feel that this expansion is not at the
end of its string yet. We probably have another year or so to go,''
said Jay Woodworth, senior domestic economist for Bankers Trust Co.
of New York.

<HEAD>Shamrock Seeks Injunction Against Polaroid Stock Buyback</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shamrock Holdings Inc. has asked a
Delaware judge to prevent Polaroid's directors from exercising proxy
rights on $300 million of preferred stock that Polaroid sold last
month to a friendly investment group.
   Shamrock's lawyers on Monday also asked Vice Channcellor Carolyn
Berger of the Delaware Chancery Court to block the Cambridge,
Mass.-based company's $1.125 billion stock buy-back plan, saying it
would give management an unfair advantage in an imminent proxy
battle.
   Berger took both arguments under advisement. Her rulings could
have a major impact on the takeover and proxy battle being waged by
Shamrock, a radio and television concern based in Burbank, Calif.
   Polaroid has defended itself against Shamrock's hostile
$45-a-share takeover bid by offering $50 a share for 22 percent of
its own stock. Polaroid's offer expires March 20, which ensures that
shares tendered by that date will be controlled by management at the
May 9 annual meeting.
   Shamrock attorney Michael Rauch contended that Polaroid's tender
offer should not be allowed before the meeting, at which the
company's entire board of directors is up for election.
   Rauch noted that Polaroid previously issued close to 10 million
shares to an employee stock ownership plan and sold more shares to
Corporate Partners L.P., a New York investment group formed to aid
companies warding off hostile suitors.
   ``Polaroid made a short-term merger impossible by issuing
stock,'' Rauch said. ``Now they've stacked the deck by removing the
one chance for stockholders to have a say'' at the annual meeting.
   But Polaroid attorney Frederick Schwartz said, ``We're performing
our duty (to the stockholders).''

   Structural Dynamics Research Corp. and
Nissan Motor Co. Ltd., the big Japanese automaker, have formed a
joint company to provide engineering consulting services in the Far
East, it was announced Tuesday.
   The joint venture marks the first time Nissan has teamed up with
an overseas company to launch a new business activity, the
announcement stated.
   Nissan owns 70 percent of the new company called ESTECH Corp. and
SDRC owns 30 percent.
   Kinji Shono, general manager of Nissan's Business Development
Office, has been named president of ESTECH. Additional staff members
will be supplied by both firms.
   ESTECH, to be based in Yokohama, Japan, will provide engineering
consulting and problem-solving techniques related to product design
and manufacturing. Initially, the majority of services will be
conducted for Nissan.
   In addition to forming the new company, Tokyo-based Nissan has
selected SDRC as its preferred vendor for mechanical computer-aided
engineering software, on a worldwide basis.
   SDRC is an international supplier of mechanical computer-aided
engineering software and services used by automotive, aerospace and

<HEAD>Eastern Returns To Court Against Union `Slowdown'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines and its Machinists union were in
federal court trading charges of contract violations as a Friday
strike deadline loomed ever closer.
   Eastern on Monday asked a federal judge for permission to
subcontract some repairs to catch up on a growing backlog. The
carrier also accused the Machinists of engaging in illegal work
slowdowns and refusing to accept mandatory overtime requests.
   U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins ordered the Machinists to
prepare their response to the injunction request by today, and said
he would schedule a hearing shortly after listening to their
testimony.
   Eastern said Monday that 36,000 man-hours usually are enough to
service four to six planes, but union workers are now taking 97,000
hours, increasing their backlog by almost 15 engines above the
company's operating plan.
   The Machinists in turn have blamed Eastern and Frank Lorenzo, the
chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., for delays in putting
planes back on line.
   ``Mr. Lorenzo has taken most of the newer aircraft from Eastern's
fleet and put them over at Continental (Airlines),'' said union
spokesman Wally Haber. ``The ones we have over here are old ones
that need a lot of work.''
   At a Feb. 17 hearing on the same issues, Atkins ordered the union
to accept overtime while telling Eastern to stop farming out its
plane repairs. Eastern claims that the union has violated that
order, and wants to begin contracting out again.
   On another front, the Machinists once again called on President
Bush to create an emergency board empowered to declare a 60-day
cooling-off period when the current one ends at midnight EST Friday.
   ``We are in favor of a presidential emergency board,'' Haber
said. ``We look forward to putting our case before a third party.''
   Eastern, which estimates its losses at $1 million a day, has
opposed the board because it fears another extension will simply
cost the carrier more money, said spokesman Robin Matell.

<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
today that interest rates will remain high unless Congress and the
administration do a credible job of cutting the budget deficit.
   ``The budget deficit must be brought down. While it is beguiling
to contemplate the healthy growth of recent years in the context of
large budget deficits, it is fanciful to conclude that these
deficits have no adverse consequences,'' Greenspan told the Senate
Budget Committee.
   ``Allowing deficits to persist courts instability in the near
term and threatens potentially significant reductions over time in
the United States standard of living,'' he said in his first
congressional appearance since the Fed boosted its key bank lending
rate last Friday.
   The economy, according to the Fed's reading, is in danger of
overheating. Retail price inflation, at an already-too-high
4.4-percent in 1987 and 1988, could ratchet higher because of tight
labor markets and strained factory capacity, Fed officials believe.
   Greenspan said, ``Large budget deficits contribute to the
(inflation) problem; they tend to put inordinate strains on
financial markets and they directly fuel excess demand on
resources.''
   On Friday, the Fed sent a dramatic signal of its intent to keep
inflation under control by increasing its discount rate, the
interest charged member banks for short-term loans, from 6.5 percent
to 7 percent, the highest level in three years.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the budget panel, called
the increase ``an unmistakeable message to the president and the
Congress that we better put our fiscal affairs in order.'' However,
he added, ``I am afraid that the message is simply not being heard.''
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said the discount rate increase ``should be a wake-up
call for both the administration and Congress.''
   The Fed's anti-inflation campaign has put it at odds with the
Bush administration, which hopes to keep the deficit under control
without raising taxes.
   Higher interest rates, by adding to the cost of carrying the $2.7
trillion national debt and by eventually slowing the economy, make
that more difficult.
   Both Bush's budget and his plan to rescue the savings and loan
industry depend on sharply falling interest rates, and on Saturday
the president acknowledged: ``I can't say I'm happy about the rise
in interest rates.''
   Bush says the threat of inflation is not as severe as the Fed
believes.
   ``We've got a little difference of interpretation at this point
as to how you read the indicators on inflation,'' he said.
   The president's top economic spokesman, Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady, issued a statement late Friday acknowledging that
``keeping inflation low is essential to sustaining the economic
expansion,'' but he did not back away from his statement to Congress
last week: ``I don't see as strong evidence of inflation right now
as does the Federal Reserve.''
   The economy, according to the Fed's reading, is in danger of
overheating. Retail price inflation, already at 4.4 percent in 1987
and 1988, could ratchet higher because of tight labor markets and
strained factory capacity, Fed officials believe.
   Congress and the president could relieve some of the pressure by
quickly settling on a credible plan to whittle next year's budget
deficit from the current $165 billion to the $100 billion target of
the Gramm-Rudman law. That would lessen what many economists see as
the inflationary stimulus of deficit spending.
   So far, that hasn't happened and the entire burden of managing
the economy has fallen on the Fed's monetary policy. The central
bank has pushed short-term interest rates up by 3 percentage points
over the past year, hoping to slow the economy without derailing the
6-year-old expansion.
   However, higher interest rates on everything from auto loans to
adjustable-rate mortgages inflict pain on American consumers and
businesses and, in response, members of Congress often complain that
the independent central bank is squeezing too hard.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Morton Thiokol Inc., manufacturer of the booster
rockets which were blamed for the space shuttle Challenger explosion
three years ago, says it plans to spin off its specialty chemical
business from its troubled aerospace operation.
   The plan, approved by the board of directors and announced on
Monday, would split Morton Thiokol into two companies: Thiokol Inc.,
the aerospace concern, and Morton International Inc., which would
include the speciality chemicals, airbags and salt businesses.
   The transaction is expected to be finalized July 1 pending
shareholders' aproval, according to company spokesman Tom Russell.
   Under the plan, shareholders would receive a tax-free
distribution of a share of Morton International stock for each
Morton Thiokol share. The company said it believes the stock of both
new companies will qualify for listing on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Russell said the planned spinoff had nothing to do with the
Challenger explosion.
   Morton Thiokol manufactured the rocket boosters of the
Challenger, which exploded shortly after takeoff on Jan. 28, 1986,
killing the seven crew members. Investigators have blamed a failure
in the boosters on the explosion.
   Morton Thiokol has since redesigned the boosters, correcting
joint problems linked to the blast, and they have been used
successfully on two shuttle flights in recent months.
   ``The shuttle program is in very good shape, we're very confident
of redesign,'' Russell said.
   Morton Thiokol Chairman Charles S. Locke, said the spinoff ``will
allow investors to evaluate better the individual businesses and
their future outlook, enhancing the likelihood that the true value
of each business will be properly reflected.''
   Wall Street also appeared optimsitic about the plan. Morton
Thiokol rose $3.50 to $43.50 in late-morning trading today on the
NYSE.
   Locke said the specialty chemicals company is expected to have
fiscal 1989 assets of $1.4 billion and sales of $1.5 billion. The
aerospace business is expected to post $1.1 billion in sales this
year and have assets of $800 million, he said.
   The company said that S. Jay Stewart, Mortion Thiokol's president
and chief operating officer, is expected to be elected to those
posts at Morton International. Ed Garrison, group vice president for
aerospace in Ogden, Utah, is expected to be elected president and
chief operating officer of the aerospace company, it said.
   Morton Thiokol said special charges anticipated from the spinoff
will reduce estimated net income to below the range of $3.40 to
$3.60 a share.
   Morton Thiokol's fiscal 1988 net income totaled $145.3 million,
or $3.04 a share, on sales of $2.32 billion.

   Wild swings in stock prices harm the economy,
speakers said at a conference today while disagreeing on whether
Wall Street is part of the solution or part of the problem.
   Experts at the two-day forum on technology and its role in the
financial markets are exploring how to give the markets
computer-driven efficiency without courting computer-driven disaster.
   As exchanges move toward 24-hour, worldwide trading and install
ever-faster computers, the experts want to make sure electronic
trading systems do not overwhelm the people who are supposed to
control them.
   One concern is the wild price swings that have occurred
periodically in the stock market, partly due to computerized trading
programs that can rapidly buy or sell millions of shares as part of
speculative strategies.
   Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard University economist, said harmful
speculation could be reduced by a tax on securities trades.
   But Louis I. Margolis, a managing director of the Wall Street
investment firm Salomon Brothers Inc., said a better answer would be
a return to fixed commissions for brokers.
   The proposals came on the second and main day of the forum, which
was sponsored by the Annenberg Washington Program and Northwestern
University's Kellogg Graduate School of Management.
   Acknowledging that investors are unlikely to tolerate going back
to fixed brokerage fees, Salomon's Margolis said an alternative
would be to free brokerage firms from some of their remaining
constraints.
   Brokerage firms are hamstrung today, unable to stabilize the
markets by coming in to buy stocks when prices fall steeply,
Margolis said.
   ``We are coming along to a liquidity crisis in the stock
market,'' Margolis said.
   ``We've seen the traditional swings between optimism and
pessimism compressed into very short periods of time,'' he said.
   But Summers said the best way to deal with the chaotic price
swings would be to discourage short-term trading.
   The forum featured sessions with federal regulators, academics
and leaders of several major exchanges.
   Among the observers are representatives of the congressional
Office of Technology Assessment, which is in the middle of its own
18-month study of technology's impact on the financial markets.
   ``This one sounds very much like a condensed version of our own
study,'' Vary Coates, who is directing the congressional study, said
Monday.
   Technology was partly blamed for the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market
crash. Several investigators said the disaster was worsened by
portfolio insurance, a computerized strategy of selling securities
into a declining market.
   Some also blamed wild price gyrations during the crash on index
arbitrage, a computerized trading strategy for profiting on price
gaps between stocks traded in New York and the underlying
stock-index futures traded in Chicago.
   More recently, though, technology has been put forward as a
solution to the alleged abuses in the Chicago trading pits, where
futures and options are traded by chaotic ``open outcry.''
   Using computers to match buyers and sellers in Chicago would
break the hold of floor traders who are accused of excluding
outsiders and making private deals that disadvantage customers,
advocates of computerization say.
   The problem for reformers is that computerization can challenge
some politically powerful interests: in Chicago, the floor traders,
and in New York, the specialists who make a market in particular
stocks.
   The 1987 stock market crash convinced the exchanges that they
needed to do a better job of computerizing the unglamorous but
essential back offices, where questioned trades are settled and
cleared _ meaning the money and securities change hands.
   ``Everyone has concentrated on front-end systems; that is, the
execution side of it. They have not concentrated that closely on the
risk-management side,'' said John Wall, an executive vice president
at the National Association of Securities Dealers.
   In the 1987 crash, turmoil in the back offices was so great that
major banks were unwilling to make emergency loans to securities
firms because they weren't confident that adequate collateral
existed for the loans. The crisis ended when the Federal Reserve
injected massive reserves into the system and strong-armed the banks.
   ``Maybe people, at least in the financial sector, may have gone
too far and allowed too much automation without checks and
balances,'' said Paul F. Glaser, chairman of the Corporate
Technology Committee of Citicorp.
   Nevertheless, Glaser said he continues to believe that technology
can reduce risk in the financial markets. ``First of all, you can't
go back,'' he said. ``You've got to deal with it.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ America's love affair with the robot apparently

is, robots are still pretty dumb and corporations are hesitant to

   Scientists in the 1950s proclaimed the robot
the wave of the future. It would free housewives of drudgery and
fill factories with a tireless steel-collar work force. But in many
ways, the wave has been a washout.
   Robots can paint cars, salvage nuclear fuel and even assist in
brain surgery, but they're still pretty dumb. And they are far from
the science fiction promise of comic books and movies.
   ``Robots now are significantly better than 30 years ago, but that
doesn't necessarily mean we are anywhere close to an R2-D2 or
C-3PO,'' says Raj Reddy, director of The Robotics Institute at
Carnegie Mellon University, referring to the robot characters in the
movie ``Star Wars.''
   Orders for American-made robots have been falling since their
peak of $501 million in 1984, according to the Robotics Industries
Association.
   Experts say automating a factory is more complicated than just
buying a robot and putting it on the assembly line. In addition,
they say, some industrial robots are too complicated and prone to
failure and, when they do work, they don't always fit in with
factory operations.
   About 33,000 robots work in the United States, mostly in
manufacturing, with automakers buying at least 40 percent, says
robots association spokesman Jeffrey A. Burnstein.
   ``It's not a revolution. It's an evolution,'' Burnstein says.
``Robots are another new, productive technology in the same way that
computers were.''
   Japan is the world's leading robot user, followed by the United
States, West Germany and France.
   ``Robots are still dumb,'' Reddy says. ``They're dumb because we
haven't taken the trouble to put the pieces together, not because we
don't know how. That takes money and time and effort, and we don't
have the money.''
   But today's robots can:
   _See. They don't see like humans, but they can recognize forms
and shapes and measure distances through sonar, ranging devices and
lasers.
   _Hear and speak. They use computers that recognize thousands of
words.
   _Smell. Their sensors can detect smoke or fumes.
   _Move. They most often roll on wheels, but some models hop on one
leg and others walk with as many as eight legs, ambling like a
spider on uneven terrain.
   _Touch. They can recognize texture and the force of a movement,
such as pressing.
   Many robots have one or two of these abilities to some degree,
but creating a competent robot that combines most or all of them has
been difficult.
   In addition, scientists have found it's difficult to match human
abilities that most people take for granted, such as the dexterity
of a finger or the ability to identify objects.
   ``The rule of thumb is that if you think the job is easy, then
it's usually difficult,'' says Takeo Kanade, co-director of the
Carnegie Mellon institute. ``The list of things that robots can do
better than humans is much, much shorter than the list of things
robots cannot.''
   Industrial robots can perform many tedious tasks with precision,
including welding, assembling, painting, packaging and loading, yet
Burnstein estimates that less than 5 percent of American companies
have installed even one robot.
   Japanese companies, which have installed more than twice as many
robots as American companies, have been more willing to invest in
robots that take years to pay for themselves, Burnstein says.
   ``Robots are very expensive to make and they can do very
little,'' says Hans Moravec, senior research scientist at Carnegie
Mellon. ``It's hard to find a job for them that actually pays off.''
   Moravec says the industrial robot is about as smart as an insect.
   ``The robots working on the assembly line today might well be
compared to spiders,'' he says. ``They do their jobs competently,
but it's a narrow job.''
   Industrial robots often shut down when even the slightest thing
goes wrong, forcing humans to their aid, says Donald Michie, chief
scientist of the Turing Institute of Glasgow, Scotland, which
conducts research into artificial intelligence.

   Michie is trying to develop computers that learn from experience
_ a technology that could result in robots that adjust to changing
circumstances and learn from mistakes.
   Moravec believes technology will enable robots to have human-like
intelligence in about 50 years.
   Service robots, a new breed, are moving off the factory floor to
handle work in hazardous environments, help the disabled, or just
sweep floors. Underwater robots are examining lake bottoms and doing
risky deep-sea work.
   Doctors at Memorial Medical Center of Long Beach, Calif., have
performed more than 35 brain operations with the help of a robot arm
that guides surgeons as they drill into the skull.
   Research is under way at Carnegie Mellon on a six-legged robot to
explore the surface of Mars in the next decade and on a car that can
drive itself. University researchers also made robots to remove
radioactive waste from the crippled Three Mile Island nuclear plant
near Harrisburg.
   K.G. Engelhardt, director of the university's health and human
services lab, is developing a robotic work station that allows the
disabled, especially those without the use of their hands, to work
in an office. The station should be marketed by the end of the year,
selling for less than $50,000, she says.
   Tish Pferdehirt, 44, a vocational rehabilitation counselor in
Pittsburgh, helps test the station. With paralyzed legs and only
limited use of her arms, she knows first-hand the benefits of such a
helpmate.
   ``It does all kinds of things from getting a book off a shelf for
me, to turning off a radio, to picking up a file and putting it in
an in-out box,'' she says.
   The work station has an arm that turns, bends and swivels as Ms.
Pferdehirt speaks commands into a microphone. It fetches things,
looks up telephone numbers and dials the phone.
   Ms. Engelhardt hopes to make the robot work on projects
independently, such as shredding paper, when she is not there, thus
making it more valuable.
   Joseph F. Engelberger has big corporate backers for his service
robots.
   Projects in the works at Engelberger's Transitions Research Corp.
of Danbury, Conn., include development of robots that will sweep or
scrub floors in airports or supermarkets and fetch drugs for
pharmacists in mail-order warehouses.
   Another Engelberger robot is Help-Mate, a nurse's aide that
delivers meals to hospital patients and makes other deliveries, such
as taking a urine specimen to a lab.
   Help-Mate, designed to use elevators and negotiate hallways as it
moves by itself on wheels, is being tested, and Engelberger said it
will go on sale for $40,000 by year's end.
   Engelberger hopes to get corporate backing to build his dream
robot: a $50,000 household helper that would prepare light meals,
clean house and clear snow. But he can't figure out how to teach it
to make beds.
   He estimates it would take up to $14 million and 2{ years to
develop, but American companies so far have been unwilling to make
the initial investment.
   Engelberger helped pioneer an industrial robot more than 30 years
ago, but the history of the automaton goes back farther.
   ``The whole idea of building a mechanical man is fairly old,''
Moravec says. ``There were clockwork automatons built by Swiss and
French clocksmiths in the 18th century and 17th century.''
   The term robotics was coined in 1942 in a science fiction story
by Isaac Asimov from the word robot, which was coined in 1921 by
Czech playwright Karel Capek.
   In 1954, American inventor George Devol filed a patent for a
programmable robot arm whose movement was controlled by punched
program cards. In 1958, Devol and Engelberger formed a company to
build the machines.
   Their first industrial robot was installed in 1961 in a General
Motors Corp. plant.
   Engelberger says visions in the 1950s of a robot-filled world
fizzled when the promises outran technology.
   ``Everything was supposed to become automated,'' he says. ``It
was all blue sky, but the technology wasn't available. The
technology is just becoming available, but I have a difficult time
convincing people we can do it today.''

<HEAD>Mitchell Says Resolve Needed to Cut Deficit</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 10 grafs new, picking up at pvs 5th graf, The federal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell told
governors concerned about the budget today that Congress and the
president ``have got to summon the resolve'' to achieve significant
reductions in the federal deficit this year.
   Facing questioning about the nation's ``fiscal insanity'' at a
gathering of the nation's governors, Mitchell, D-Maine, said he had
just left a meeting with President Bush where they ``reaffirmed this
morning our commitment to a cooperative effort on the budget'' and
other areas.
   ``The situation has reached a stage that is so critical _ the
events of recent weeks, increases in interest rates, threaten us
with being just consumed with interest payments on the debt _ that
we've got to summon the resolve to do it,'' Mitchell said.
   He addressed the final session of the National Governors'
Association annual winter meeting, which heard from congressional
leaders and administration officials that they should expect no
financial help from Washington because of the crisis posed by the
federal deficit.
   Democratic Gov. Cecil Andrus of Idaho said ``the fiscal insanity
that presently prevails over this city'' is the over-riding problem
facing each of the governors. He asked Mitchell what Congress would
do.
   The Senate leader responded that he believed Congress has the
will to act on the deficit but cannot act without the president. He
said Bush has ``strongly held views in many areas'' _ an apparent
reference to the president's flat opposition to tax increases.
   Mitchell said the governors, like other Americans, hold
conflicting views that complicate a budget answer.
   ``You've got a number of policy statements here, governor, that
call for increased federal spending ... and yet another one that
calls for meaningful deficit reduction,'' he said, referring to the
policy statements of the bipartisan governors' association.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and Sen. Brock Adams,
D-Wash., who held that job in the Carter administration, told the
governors Monday to expect congressional deficit fighters to crowd
out a traditional source of state revenues by attempting an increase
in the federal tax on gasoline.
   ``There is significant pressure in the House for such a gas tax
for deficit reduction'' as well as the Senate, Skinner said. ``I
would not assume or take for granted it will not be successful.''
   The federal government currently levies a 9 cents per gallon tax
on gasoline, and it is often eyed as a source of more money. Adams
said that for each penny it is raised, $1 billion in revenue is
collected.
   But states levy taxes on fuel for their own transportation
spending, and governors in both parties say any increase in the
federal tax makes it more difficult for the states to raise their
own gasoline taxes.
   Gov. James Thompson, R-Ill., said the governors would ask for the
federal government to promise to turn some of the revenue over to
the states if the gas tax is increased for transportation needs. He
said he would oppose a gas tax increase for non-transportation
purposes.
   The governors conducted their meeting, which began on Saturday,
with few displays of partisanship as they sought to hear from
congressional leaders and top officials of the Bush administration
on the outlook for the budget and what it means for the states.
   The message they heard was generally simple: don't expect much
financial help from the federal government because of the budget
deficit.
   Senate Budget Committe Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., offered
that message in a session on Sunday, and Skinner offered the
administration's version on Monday in reference to the governors'
requests for more federal spending on highways, bridges and other
transportation needs.
   ``I see no sentiment whatsoever for a salvation from Washington
for the infrastructure problems of this nation,'' Skinner said.
   He said the governors should expect a greater share of the burden
for transportation needs to shift to the states.
   Governors have been seeking the release of more money from the
federal highway trust fund, and Gov. Henry Bellmon, R-Okla., said,
``We'd like to have our slice of that trust fund _ the sooner the
better.''
   But Skinner said much of the money on hand is already obligated
for future spending. ``There is not a potload of money ... that's
going to be available for the future,'' he said.
   Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, D-Ore., like Adams a former transportation
secretary, said transportation needs warrant increased federal
spending. ``There are really some infrastructure problems in this
country that are keeping us from being competitive,'' he said.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Gain On China Offer, Light Deliveries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened moderately higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, partly in reaction to the
Agriculture Department's offer of more wheat to China.
   The USDA announced late Monday that it had targeted the Chinese
for sales of an additional 2 million metric tons of wheat at
subsidized prices.
   Under previous authorizations in the government's Export
Enhancement Program, China has bought more than 7.4 million tons of
wheat for delivery in 1988-89. Only 10,000 tons remained in the
previous authorization issued on Dec. 30.
   Soybean and oat futures advanced in response to
lighter-than-expected delivery notices posted against the March
contracts. Higher soybean meal prices in Europe also supported the
soybean complex, analysts said.
   Corn's early gains mainly reflected spillover buying from the
neighboring grain and soybean pits.
   In early trading, wheat was 1} cents to 4{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.37 a bushel; corn was 1\ cents
to 1} cents higher with March at $2.71} a bushel; oats were 2{ cents
to 4{ cents higher with March at $2.03} a bushel; soybeans were 2{
cents to 4} cents higher with March at $7.62 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .30 cent lower to .10 cent higher with April at
77.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .20 cent lower
with March at 82.72 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to .15
cent lower with April at 43.35 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .02 cent to .25 cent lower with March at 37.75 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures retreated on Monday while pork futures settled
mixed.

<TEXT>
   Menachem Golan, who headed the Cannon Group
film company with his cousin Yorum Globus for eight years, has
resigned to form his own film production company, Cannon announced.
   Golan and his cousin headed the Los Angeles-based film company
from 1979 until last April when Italian financier Giancarlo Paretti
took control.
   Golan will set up a new independent production company with about
$160 million he will receive under a four-year agreement with
Cannon, the company said Monday.
   Globus' future was not mentioned in the company's announcement.
   The change will allow Cannon's controlling shareholders, led by
Parretti, to fit the production firm into the group of companies and
film assets Parretti is acquiring.
   Paretti announced last Friday he had bought New World
Entertainment. Last month he founded Pathe Entertainment.
   According to the agreement with Golan, Cannon is to commit $159.6
million to Golan's new company to finance 17 motion pictures. The
company is to provide $3 million a year for operating expenses in
addition to a $6 million fund for developing projects.
   Golan is to receive 20 percent of the net profits of each film
his new company makes and will buy the name and logo of 21st Century
Distribution Corp. from Cannon.

<TEXT>
   A group of aviation industry and government
safety experts recommended today $800 million worth of mandatory
work on older airliners to ensure safety of the nation's aging
airliner fleet.
   The unprecedented program, if adopted by the Federal Aviation
Administration, would affect more than 1,300 early Boeing 747, 737
and 727 models at a cost of over $600,000 each.
   The Aging Aircraft Task Force's working group on older Boeing
airliners drew up its final recommendations this morning just prior
to a news conference releasing the details. The Air Transport
Association, which represents major airlines, organized the task
force.
   Clyde Kizer, an ATA vice president, said none of the recommended
work, which would involve planes flown by foreign carriers as well
as U.S. airlines, was considered urgent. ``There are no dangerous
aircraft out there flying right now,'' he told reporters.
   Representatives of Delta and United, who also participated in the
news conference, said much of the work had already been done on
their airliners and they anticipated no immeidate large expenses.
   Some other major airlines also have made many of the changes
recommended by the task force.
   ``Widescale modification or replacement of structural material,
fittings and skin are being recommended on the basis of service
experience,'' said a final draft of the report, which follows nine
months of meetings and examination of more than 700 service
bulletins issued by Boeing.
   The recommendations adopt 150 of the bulletins and consolidate
them into the form of one massive service bulletin to be issued by
Boeing and presented to the FAA for possible adoption as an
airworthiness directive.
   The difference in a manufacturer's bulletin and an FAA
airworthiness directive is that FAA orders are mandatory. Airliner
operators will be given varying times to accomplish the changes,
based on the amount of service an aircraft has had.
   Other groups from the task force are looking at service
recommendations affecting McDonnell Douglas DC-9s, DC-8s and DC-10s
and airliners manufactured abroad to see what modifications will be
needed to maintain their safety. Results of their work are expected
before the end of the year.
   The average age of the nearly 3,000 U.S. airliners is about 13
years, with half the planes in many major airlines' fleets well over
15 years old, according to Avmark, an appraisal and consulting firm.
   The task force recommendations, if adopted by the FAA, would be a
departure from a system that has relied primarily on inspection
orders, with repairs made subsequently when needed.
   Among the 150 participants on the task force are the FAA,
representatives of major airlines belonging to the Air Transport
Association, professional airline mechanics organizations, foreign
airlines and regulatory bodies, and the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
   Both Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, along with several airlines
and the FAA have been examining the problems of the aging
international airliner fleet, but this is the first time government
and industry have gotten together on such a large scale to tackle
the issue.
   Boeing head F. A. Shrontz said in Washington last week that his
company's airliners are built to last forever if properly maintained.
   Old airliners are rarely scrapped because low aviation fuel
prices, steadily increasing air travel, the high cost of new
airliners and other factors have boosted the demand for old
airliners and their value.
   But airport noise reduction requirements and incidents of holes
ripping open in fuselages and of wheels and engines falling off of
older planes are putting increased pressure on airlines to phase out
their oldest models.
   Some airline critics have suggested that whole classes of
airliners be scrapped or that airliners be taken out of service
after a set number of flying hours or takeoffs and landings.
   Aviation experts say that the chronological age of an airliner
has less effect on its overall value and safety than other factors
such as the number of times its cabin is pressurized and
depressurized, the quality of the airline's maintenance program and
the environment in which it is flown.
   Increased concern over aging airliners was prompted by an April
1988 incident in which the top of the passenger compartment in an
Aloha 737 ripped off over Hawaii. A stewardess was killed in the
incident.
   The recommendations came four days after a hole ripped open in
United Air Lines' oldest 747, sending nine passengers hurling to
their deaths 17 minutes after takeoff from Honolulu. But
investigators in that incident said they found no signs of metal
fatigue that is often a factor in damage to older airliners and were
focusing on the possibility of a faulty cargo door.

   Stock prices on the London Stock Exchange rallied
to close higher Tuesday but trading was thin ahead of Wednesday's
release of the nation's January trade report.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 5.7 points, or 0.3 percent, at 2,002.4, its best level for
the day.
   The late-day rally was prompted mostly by good gains on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average was up about 12
points as London trading ended.
   Volume was light, however, with 357.8 million shares traded,
compared with Monday's 413.8 million shares.
   Recent concerns that British interest rates may have to move
higher were set aside momentarily as the pound showed renewed
strength against the West German mark, dealers said.
   But they cautioned that a disappointing set of figures on
Britain's balance of payments could undermine the pound and possibly
prompt an interest rate rise.
   ``The underlying level of interest is still fairly low. We're all
really waiting for the next set of trade figures,'' a dealer said.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher In Uninspired Trading, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: AMs planned by 5:30 p.m. EST</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar finished higher in uninspired
European trading Tuesday following news of slower-than-expected U.S.
economic growth and continued high inflation.
   Gold prices were lower.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was unable to sustain
early highs following news that the U.S. gross national product
expanded at an unrevised seasonally adjusted rate of 2 percent in
the fourth quarter of 1988. The market had been expecting an upward
revision to 2.5 percent.
   Dealers said the market also sold dollars on news that the
implicit GNP deflator, a measure of inflation, rose 5.3 percent in
the fourth quarter.
   The market is now adopting a wait-and-see attitude ahead of
Wednesday's release of British trade figures and Thursday's meeting
of the Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, to see what happens
with European interest rates, dealers said.
   Britain's trade figures will be watched closely because many
market players think a wider-than-expected deficit could force the
government to prompt another one-point hike in the commercial banks'
base lending rate, which stands at 13 percent.
   Dealers said both the dollar and the pound were helped by the
West German mark's weaker tone on Tuesday amid growing speculation
the Bundesbank might not raise key interest rates at Thursday's
meeting of its central bank council.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.7430 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7440 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday:

<HEAD>US West Bids On Hong Kong Cable Television System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   US West International said Tuesday it had
formed a consortium that submitted a bid for what it said would be
the world's biggest cable television franchise in Hong Kong.
   The franchise winner would be entitled to build a cable system
that would serve between 1.5 million and 2 million homes, more homes
than in any other single cable franchise territory, US West said.
   US West International, which is a unit of the former Bell System
company US West, already has interests in cable television systems
in France and Great Britain.
   Reynie Ortiz, president of US West International, said in a news
release issued by the company that the successful bidder will be
granted two 15-year licenses, one for cable TV programming and the
other for non-voice telecommunications services using cable
facilities. He said the latter system could include fax, videotex
and private networks within buildings or within certain geographic
areas of Hong Kong.
   The Hong Kong government is expected to announce the successful
bidder in August, said Ortiz.
   ``Hong Kong is an extremely attractive market for us, since it
affords the opportunity to combine telecommunications and cable
technology,'' said Ortiz. ``It fits perfectly with our strategy of
being a worldwide player in the cable-telecommunications arena. And,
significantly, it positions us for eventual penetration into the
vast Asian and Chinese mainland markets.''
   US West International spokesman Ed Mattix said his company has a
25 percent stake in the consortium which is called Hong Kong Cable
Communications Ltd.
   He said other members of the consortium are Wharf Holdings, a
major Hong Kong commercial and residential development firm with a
28 percent stake; Sun Hung Kai, a large Hong Kong-based construction
and development company with 27 percent; Coditel, one of Europe's
largest cable TV companies with a 10 percent interest, and Shaw
Brothers, a major Asian film and television production company also
with 10 percent interest.
   US West International previously acquired a 10 percent interest
in Lyonnaise Communications, which operates cable TV franchises in
France. Coditel is a partner in that venture as well.
   US West International also has interests in two
cable-telecommunications ventures in the United Kingdom. One of
those franchises, in Birmingham, England, has 500,000 households on
line.
   Another US West unit, US West Communications, provides telephone
service to 14 Western states. US West also owns companies involved
in commercial real estate, financial services, cellular mobile
communications and paging, directory publishing and business
telecommunications products and services.

   The stock market was higher in afternoon trading
today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 1.43 points at
2,251.79 at 3 p.m. EST. The blue-chip barometer had leaped more than
10 points earlier in the trading session.
   Advancing issues edged out declines by around 4 to 3 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 808 issues up, 581 down and 532 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 118.18 million shares.
   Analysts said the market's advance was mainly a reaction to last
week's sharp sell-off. They cautioned against attaching undue
significance to a government report today on economic growth, since
it refers to a past period.
   ``I wouldn't read too much into this whole thing,'' said Michael
Metz, an analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``They (stock traders) are
almost looking for an excuse to rally.''
   The Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at a
sluggish annual rate of 2 percent in the final three months of 1988
as the worst deterioration in the trade deficit in more than two
years offset unexpected strength in consumer spending.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was up
0.26 at 162.21.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had edged
up 0.31 to 321.75.

<HEAD>Soybean Oil Leads Late Surge In Complex</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed higher Tuesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, paced by a technically inspired surge in
the soybean oil market.
   Soybean futures also advanced sharply, with prices for deliveries
of this summer's crop posting the strongest gains.
   Soybean oil had opened lower in reaction to the morning posting
of a higher-than-expected number of notices of intent to deliver
soybean oil against the March contract.
   The large number of delivery notices, an indication of ample
supplies, was seen as a bearish signal. But prices did not fall
sharply, and ``if you're a trader, that's a good sign,'' said Walter
Spilka, a market analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham
&amp; Co.
   ``Later in the session, some buying began to accumulate and that
fed on itself and we had a big surge in the end,'' Spilka said.
``The market put on one of its best performances since the summer.''
   Wheat and corn futures were supported by an improving export
picture, including the Agriculture Department's offer to subsidize
sales of 2 million metric tons of wheat to China.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 3} cents higher with March
at $4.36\ a bushel; corn was } cent to 2{ cents higher with March at
$2.72{ a bushel; oats were 4 cents to 5{ cents higher with March at

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three former associates of fallen business
virtuoso Barry Minkow were sentenced to up to three years in jail
for taking part in the ZZZZ Best fraud case.
   U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian on Monday sentenced Norman
Rothberg, 52, of Marina del Rey, who turned Minkow in then accepted
money to keep quiet, to one year and one day in prison for his
conviction on five counts of fraud.
   Daniel B. Krowpman was sentenced to three years in prison for
taking $600,000 in profits from the fraud. The judge also fined
Krowpman $5,000 and ordered him to serve five years probation when
he is released from prison.
   Krowpman loaned Minkow money to start the ZZZZ Best carpet
cleaning company when Minkow, now 22, was just 16 and operating out
of his parents' garage, according to trial testimony.
   U.S. Attorney James Asperger said Krowpman submitted falsified
documents that helped Minkow with his scheme.
   Edward Krivda was sentenced to 60 days in a halfway house for his
role in supplying carpet to ZZZZ Best. He also was ordered to
perform 300 hours of community service and placed on three years'
probation.
   Krivda and Krowpman both pleaded guilty to a variety of charges.
   Dozens of men were convicted or pleaded guilty in the $25 million
bank and investment scam. Minkow, who faces up to 403 years in
prison, is to be sentenced March 13.

   The stock market rose today in what analysts
described as a reflex response to last week's sharp decline.
   ``It's kind of a physical, knee-jerk pop,'' said Larry Wachtel,
an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Market-watchers cautioned against attaching undue significance to
a pair of government reports released today, since they referred to
a past period.
   The Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at a
sluggish annual rate of 2 percent in the final three months of 1988
as the worst deterioration in the trade deficit in more than two
years offset unexpected strength in consumer spending.
   The trade shortfall climbed to $32 billion in the period, as both
U.S. exports and imports hit record levels.
   ``I wouldn't read too much into this whole thing,'' said Michael
Metz, an analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``They (stock traders) are
almost looking for an excuse to rally.''
   Despite the news of sluggish growth in the fourth quarter, the
market's underlying anxiety about inflation persists, analysts said.
   Wall Street sniffed at congressional testimony today by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who warned that interest rates will
remain high unless Congress and the administration do a credible job
of cutting the budget deficit.
   The Fed chairman has appeared on Capitol Hill numerous times in
the past week or so, and market players seem to have grown blase
about his statements.
   ``They sort of brushed right by that,'' said Bob O'Toole, manager
of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.

<HEAD>GM Paying $975 Million In Class H Stock Dispute With Hughes Institute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. said Tuesday it will spend
$975 million to buy blocks of stock from the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute to settle a dispute stemming from the automaker's 1985
purchase of Hughes Aircraft Co.
   The institute, a philanthropic organization founded by the late
billionaire recluse, had complained to GM officials that it wasn't
satisifed with the performance of GM's Class H common stock.
   GM said it would pay $675 million in cash and $300 million in
notes to buy 35 million shares of the stock, which was created to
help finance the $5.2 billion purchase of Hughes Aircraft in June
1985.
   The medical institute now owns 99.5 million, or about 78 percent,
of the outstanding shares of GM Class H stock.
   The agreement resolves a dispute that went to arbitration late
last year. GM Treasurer Leon Krain refused to disclose the reasons
for the arbitration, which kicked in under terms of the 1985 Hughes
deal.
   GM reportedly was seeking a rebate on what it paid for Hughes
because the company lost some Defense Department contracts it had
before the purchase was made.
   The institute in December complained about light trading of the
Class H stock, which made up the bulk of its assets, and that the
price of the shares appeared mainly tied to a $30-a-share price
guarantee.
   When Hughes Aircraft became GM Hughes Electronics Corp., the
automaker promised to pay the institute the difference between $30 a
share and the average price for Class H stock during the last
quarter of 1989. That provision was canceled by the agreement.
   The new agreement calls for a series of stock purchase and sell
options for GM and the institute from 1991 to 1995. If all are
exercised, the medical institute would hold about 9.5 million
shares, or 7.5 percent, of the outstanding Class H stock.
   The agreement requires that the institute hold its Class H stock
until each option deadline passes.
   GM Chairman Roger B. Smith said the company, which has reported
that it has $6.8 billion in cash on hand, could afford the stock
purchase plans called for in the agreement. He said the agreement
will provide the institute with cash liquidity it had sought.
   Bob Potter, spokesman for the Bethesda, Md.-based medical
institute, said the $675 million in cash go into an investment fund.
The remaining $300 million is to be split between two notes.
   Money generated from the investment fund will go to a variety of
projects, including medical research, Potter said. In a statement,
institute chairman George Thorn said the money will allow better
planning of research and other capital expenditure programs.

<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's point man on the savings
and loan crisis urged a group representing smaller banks Tuesday to
enthusiastically support the administration's plan for rescuing the
thrift industry even though they may have reservations about some
aspects.
   Richard C. Breeden, who oversaw drafting of the president's plan,
told a meeting of the Independent Bankers Association of America
that quibbling over details of the plan could dangerously delay
urgently needed action.
   The administration has estimated the cost of rescuing insolvent
or teetering S&amp;Ls at $90 billion and the weak one-third of the
industry is losing money at the rate of $40 million a day.
   ``At $40 million a day, we shouldn't launch into a six-month
debate,'' Breeden told the bankers, meeting at the Anaheim Hilton
Hotel. ``We simply have a huge problem and we simply have to get on
with it.''
   The president has proposed spending $39.9 billion of tax money
over the next decade to finance the bailout. Additionally, savings
and loans and to a lesser extent banks would pay more for their
federal deposit insurance.
   Members of the independent bankers group, which represents
community banks with assets of $100 million or less, have objected
that higher insurance premiums would place a disproportionate burden
on them.
   They also have complained that the president's plan does little
to remedy what they see as inequities between regulation of their
industry and the credit unions with which they compete.
   One aspect of the plan that has drawn little opposition is the
president's proposal that federal regulators should rein in what
many see as overly aggressive management in the thrift industry.
Under the Bush plan, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which
oversees the S&amp;L business, would be placed under control of the
Treasury, as has long been the case with bank regulation.
   ``Critical decisions of the bank board over the last decade
concerning capital adequacy, capital averaging, accounting rules,
chartering standards and other areas of thrift supervision do not
seem to have adequately protected the public marketplace and the
taxpayers,'' Breeden said.
   ``As a result, we must instill accountability at the top to help
prevent a repetition of this situation.''
   The president's aide drew sustained applause from the bankers
when he reminded them the president wants to spend an additional $50
million a year to prosecute dishonest thrift managers.
   ``The president is determined to see that those who have caused
massive losses to American society through criminal wrongdoing will
be sought out, pursued relentlessly and placed behind bars where
they belong for a long time,'' Breeden said.
   A congressional study found fraud played some role in up to
one-third of thrift failures to date.

   The dollar turned narrowly mixed in quiet trading
Tuesday after the government released its latest data on economic
growth.
   Gold prices rose slightly after falling overseas. Republic
National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $387.00 a troy ounce
at 4 p.m. EST, up 50 cents from Monday's late bid.
   Dealers said the dollar finished higher overseas and opened
firmer in domestic trading, but it lost ground after the Commerce
Department reported the economy grew at a lackluster annual rate of
2 percent in the fourth quarter.
   The slowdown in the gross national product, the total output of
goods and services, was accompanied by a pickup in the inflation
rate as food prices and the costs of imports both rose, the report
said.
   ``The GNP figures were a little bit lower than expected,'' said
George DeLuna, a trader with Irving Trust Co.
   He said the dollar also was held in check Tuesday by marketwide
fears of central-bank intervention.
   ``The central banks have the markets well under control here,''
DeLuna said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.15 yen to a closing 127.15 yen. It was quoted
lower in London at 126.70 yen, and at 126.89 yen in New York, up
from 126.775 yen.
   The dollar gained against the British pound in London but fell in
New York. It cost $1.7430 to buy one pound in London, cheaper than
$1.7440 late Monday. Sterling fetched $1.7430 in New York, up from
$1.73795.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's
levels, included: 1.82275 West German marks, down from 1.82435;
1.5549 Swiss francs, up from 1.5530; 1.19925 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.20325; 6.2035 French francs, down from 6.2070; and 1,341.75
Italian lire, down from 1,343.00.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Monday: 1.8230 West
German marks, up from 1.8150; 1.5535 Swiss francs, up from 1.5495;
6.1975 French francs, up from 6.1775; 2.0555 Dutch guilders, up from
2.0490; 1.2005 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2025; and 1,341.50
Italian lire, up from 1,339.62.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $387.50 a troy ounce, up 20 cents from Monday.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $386.75 an ounce,
compared with late Monday's $389.00. In Zurich, gold closed at
$387.15 an ounce, down from $390.25.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $4.09 to close at a bid $388.85
an ounce.
   Silver bullion prices fell. On New York's Comex, silver for
current delivery declined to $5.822 a troy ounce from $5.845 Monday.
Silver fell in London to $5.86 an ounce from $5.93.

   The recent rally in the heating oil pits ran out
of energy Tuesday, with futures prices pulling back slightly.
   However, gasoline futures rose and crude oil prices posted slim
gains.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, wholesale home heating oil
for March delivery fell 0.20 cent to settle at 52.45 cents a gallon.
The April contract was off 0.19 cent at 50.19 cents.
   John H. O'Connell, an analyst at Refco Inc., said heating oil
prices have gone up recently due to tight supplies and buying ahead
of the expiration Tuesday of the March contract.
   March unleaded gasoline rose 0.14 cent to end the day at 50.81
cents a gallon. The April contract gained 0.09 cent, settling at
51.57 cents.
   Crude oil prices were steady to modestly higher. The April
contract for the benchmark U.S. crude, West Texas Intermediate,
gained 1 cent to finish at $18.15 a barrel.

<TEXT>
   Soybean oil futures prices surged mightily Tuesday on the Chicago
Board of Trade in a late rally apparently incited by technical
market analyses that signaled buying opportunities despite a serious
oversupply.
   Other grain and soybean futures also advanced while precious
metals, energy, and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Soybean oil settled 20 cents to 57 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in March at $23.20 for 100 pounds.
   The runup in the last 20 minutes of trading surprised analysts
who had been watching the soybean and soybean meal markets lead the
grain markets higher for most of the day.
   Soybean oil had opened lower in reaction to the morning's posting
of a higher-than-expected number of notices of intent to deliver
soybean oil against the March contract. That initially was seen as
bearish, but prices didn't fall so many traders took it as a signal
to purchase soybean oil instead.
   ``Later in the session, some buying began to accumulate and that
fed on itself and we had a big surge in the end,'' said Walter
Spilka, a market analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham
&amp; Co. ``The market put on one of its best performances since the
summer.''
   The rally came despite what analysts call overwhelmingly negative
supply-demand fundamentals for soybean oil, with stockpiles up and
demand relatively sluggish.
   ``It's extremely overpriced on world markets,'' said analyst
Cathy Leow of Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   But analysts agreed the technical signals generated by
mathematical analysis of the market's recent price movements have
improved and may have sparked the rally.
   Soybean and soybean meal futures settled mostly higher, paced by
gains in prices of soybeans to come from this summer's crop.
   Wheat and corn futures were supported by an improving export
picture, including the Agriculture Department's offer late Monday to
subsidize sales of 2 million metric tons of wheat to China.
   The USDA said after Tuesday's close that it hoped Iraq would
purchase 1 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 3} cents higher with the contract for
delivery in March at $4.36\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2{ cents
higher with March at $2.72{ a bushel; oats were 4 cents to 5{ cents
higher with March at $2.04} a bushel; soybeans were 5\ cents to 10{
cents higher with March at $7.62{ a bushel.
   Gold futures inched higher while silver declined slightly in
lackluster trading on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled 20 cents to 60 cents higher with April at $390.40 a
troy ounce; silver was 2.1 cents to 3.9 cents lower with March at
$5.824 cents a troy ounce.
   Crude oil futures gained marginally but refined products ended
mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 9 cents
higher with April at $18.15 a barrel; heating oil was .20 cent lower
to .12 cent higher with March at 52.45 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .47 cent lower to .14 cent higher with March at 50.81
cents a gallon.
   Cattle futures settled mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, although near-month contracts for both live and feeder
cattle declined on speculative profit-taking. Pork futures were
narrowly mixed.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .30 cent higher with April at
78.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent lower to .33 cent
higher with March at 82.80 cents a pound; live hogs were .08 cent
lower to .30 cent higher with April at 43.72 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .07 cent lower to .50 cent higher with March at
38.32 cents a pound.

   Congress should tax stock trading to discourage
socially wasteful financial speculation, a Harvard University
economist argued in a Tuesday speech, but a Wall Street executive
said such a policy could increase the chance of sharp price declines.
   Economist Lawrence H. Summers, a top economic adviser to the
Democratic presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis, said
unproductive short-term trading had helped the financial industry
grow out of proportion to economic sectors that produce food, cars
and other useful products.
   The tax proposal, made during a conference on financial market
technology, reflects sentiment against speculation that has been
gathering strength in Washington as well as academic and corporate
circles, he said.
   Summers said, for example, that Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, a former Wall Street executive, has indicated he was
committed to reduce incentives that make companies focus on
quarterly profits to appease short-term investors and concurrently
create greater opportunities for speculation.
   But Louis I. Margolis, a managing director of Salomon Brothers
Inc., said Summers' proposed tax on stock trades would make sharp
price declines likelier by reducing the number of investors who
would be willing to buy a falling stock.
   ``We are coming along to a liquidity crisis in the stock
market,'' Margolis said.
   ``We've seen the traditional swings between optimism and
pessimism compressed into very short periods of time,'' he said.
   The debate came on the second and main day of a forum sponsored
by the Annenberg Washington Program and Northwestern University's
Kellogg Graduate School of Management.
   In addition to political issues, the conference dealt with how to
manage computers and high-speed communications so that they make the
markets more efficient without making them vulnerable to cataclysms
like the October 1987 stock market crash.
   The threat of Japanese competition accounts for the urgency of
American efforts to improve the speed and efficiency of the markets,
William Brodsky, the president of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
said in an afternoon session.
   Japan is ``probably the most important reason'' the Chicago Merc
has developed a 24-hour global electronic trading system in
cooperation with Reuters Holdings PLC, Brodsky said.
   ``Japan is a competitive threat for us in futures just as they
are in semiconductors, automobiles and other things,'' he said.
   The Merc intends to preserve its ``open outcry'' trading system
during regular hours even after adopting an electronic system for
off hours, Brodsky said in a session following the faceoff between
Summers and his critics.
   Summers said a tax of 0.5 percent on stock trades would raise
about $10 billion a year and would be small enough to discourage
only the major market players who he said contribute to sharp swings
in stock prices.
   He said bond trading also be could taxed, perhaps at a lower
rate. Other countries including Britain and Japan tax transactions,
so a tax would be unlikely to drive business offshore, he said.
   Salomon's Margolis said a better solution than taxation for
curbing speculation would be a return to fixed commissions for
brokers.
   He said big Wall Street houses that traditionally helped
stabilize markets by absorbing dumped stock are already shrinking
their brokerage businesses because commissions are too small to be
worthwhile.
   Acknowledging that investors would not likely tolerate going back
to fixed commissions, Margolis said an alternative would be to free
brokerage firms from certain current regulatory constraints.
   Wall Street firms should be freed to trade odd-sized bundles of
stocks and to make free use of the Chicago stock options market to
hedge their portfolios, Margolis said.
   Princeton University economist Sanford Grossman also criticized
the proposed trading tax. Grossman said it was unfair to single out
the securities industry for a tax and said there was no evidence
that the financial markets were excessively volatile.

   The stock market rose Tuesday in what analysts
described as a reflex response to last week's sharp decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.03 points to
2,258.39.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
911 up, 531 down and 516 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 147.43 million
shares, up from 139.90 million in Monday's session.
   ``It's kind of a physical, knee-jerk pop,'' said Larry Wachtel,
an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Market-watchers cautioned against attaching undue significance to
a pair of government economic reports released Tuesday, since they
referred to a past period.
   The Commerce Department reported that the economy grew at a
sluggish annual rate of 2 percent in the final three months of 1988
as the worst deterioration in the trade deficit in more than two
years offset unexpected strength in consumer spending.
   The trade shortfall climbed to $32 billion in the period, as both
U.S. exports and imports hit record levels.
   ``I wouldn't read too much into this whole thing,'' said Michael
Metz, an analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``They (stock traders) are
almost looking for an excuse to rally.''
   Despite the news of sluggish growth in the fourth quarter, the
market's underlying anxiety about inflation persists, analysts said.
That concern was a big factor in last week's slide, which hammered
the Dow Jones average down 79.28 points.
   Wall Street sniffed at congressional testimony Tuesday by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who warned that interest rates will
remain high unless Congress and the administration do a credible job
of cutting the budget deficit.
   The Fed chairman has appeared on Capitol Hill numerous times in
the past week or so, and market participants seem to have grown
blase about his statements.
   ``They sort of brushed right by that,'' said Bob O'Toole, manager
of over-the-counter trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Texaco rose ~ to 51~,
AT&amp;T was up [ at 30\, Coca Cola advanced ~ to 47} and Columbia
Pictures, the subject of revived takeover speculation, jumped 1 to
16}.
   US Shoe fell { to 19{, continuing Monday's slide. Traders'
expectations of a possible takeover or other transaction were
chilled Monday by news that the company agreed to sell its footwear
division.
   Emhart slipped [ to 40\, General Electric was down \ at 45}, IBM

   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 178.00 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $8.42 billion, or 0.30
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.54 to 162.49.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index advanced 1.24 to 333.48, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.04 at 288.86.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.77 to 399.71. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 322.47, up 1.05.

   The store sound system played ``Don't
Worry, Be Happy,'' managers maneuvered via walkie-talkie and
hundreds of workers armed with price tag guns scrambled through a
closed Sears store Tuesday to remake the image of the nation's
biggest retailer.
   In Columbus as elsewhere, Sears, Roebuck and Co. stores closed
their doors to undergo the nuts and bolts work demanded by the
company's new retailing strategy for attracting more customers.
   By reopening time at noon Wednesday, workers nationwide were to
have rolled back prices on 50,000 items representing an estimated
1.5 billion pieces of merchandise in more than 820 stores, in
addition to changing signs, taking inventory and cleaning up.
   ``The worst was the screwdrivers,'' said Chris Skinner, a
Brookhaven High School freshman who spent much of the day repricing
baby booties and toddlers' dresses. ``You had to take them all down,
clean each one by hand, then put them all back.''
   The cash register rings about 3,000 times a day in the
100,000-square-foot store, but the only sound Wednesday was the
clicking of pricing guns and muffled sounds of store officials
keeping in touch via 15 walkie-talkies.
   About 100 high school students worked for $5 an hour to help
company officials in shirt sleeves and scores of others with the
changeover.
   ``It's the most exciting thing I've ever been involved in in
Sears,'' said Bob Dumas, manager of the Northland Mall store and a
30-year Sears employee.
   ``It's no longer that old sea of yellow,'' he said, referring to
Sears' old yellow-with-black-lettering sale signs. Many new signs
touting Sears' new, lower pricing policy are red and blue, although
in apparel they are magenta and gray.
   At the Northland store, 700 workers scrambled to the tune of
``Don't Worry, Be Happy,'' as they marked down items such as a twin
canopy bed from $269.99 to $99.00. A Diehard automobile battery is
now $64 instead of $72. And a Craftsman power drill is now $32.62
instead of $59.99.
   Sears' new strategy meant reductions on 75 percent of its own
brands and 1,000 other brand names it now carries.
   ``I don't think they had any choice. They lost their customer
base,'' said Karen Sacks, an analyst with Standard and Poor's Corp.
in New York. ``I think Wednesday will be a madhouse at Sears. But
will they be able to re-educate their customers not to come in just
for a sale?''
   Men's department manager Marilyn Stone said they would.
   ``Our customers are aleady asking about the changes,'' she said,
adding that the company has more brands, better quality and fewer
items that are 100 percent polyester.
   Monroe Greenstein, analyst with the investment firm Bear Stearns
in New York, said the strategy paid off in Wichita, Kan., where
sales rose 15 percent when Sears tested the idea was last fall.
   ``And Sears will invest in an advertising campaign that, to not
hear about it, you would practically have to be comatose,''
Greenstein said.
   Columbus managers, dressed in work clothes, distributed 700 rolls
of pricing gun tape, enough to make about 350,000 new tags, and
handed out 30,000 new signs, including some that hang from ceilings
and those to be placed on bins of hardware.
   Workers dusted off palm trees that hovered alongside sparkling
racks of tropical pre-teen apparel and pulled washers and dryers
from their places to repaint the walls and changed the price tags on
lightbulbs.
   New displays featured new brands that Sears will offer.
   Display supervisor Todd Skeie said the displays were ``looser''
and ``livelier'' than they ever have been. He said better products
and being allowed to display items above the cornice on the wall for
the first time improved the store's looks.
   ``You should always keep up with the times,'' said employee Karen
Jackson. ``You don't want to be in the back seat forever.''

<HEAD>TWA Wins Supreme Court Victory In Strike Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a victory for Trans World
Airlines, ruled Tuesday that railroads and airlines may penalize
strikers by giving their jobs to employees with less seniority who
stay on the job or return to work before the strike ends.
   In a separate rulings, the court also made it easier for the
United States to turn over tax records to foreign governments.
   The TWA ruling allows more than 1,220 new flight attendants hired
during a 1986 strike by the Independent Federation of Flight
Attendants to keep their jobs but fails to reinstate more than 2,000
former striking attendants who demanded their jobs back.
   Justice William J. Brennan denounced the 6-3 ruling saying it
``is inherently destructive of the right to strike'' and that it
favors so-called cross-over workers _ those who cross picket lines.
   But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority, said
such a policy ``of encouraging pre-strike workers to remain on the
job during the strike or to abandon the strike and return to work
before all vacancies were filled'' is a legitimate ``exercise of
TWA's peaceful economic power.''
   The ruling is based on an interpretation of the federal Railway
Labor Act, which also governs airlines.
   In the tax case, which involved a 1942 tax treaty with Canada,
the Supreme Court granted Canadian officials access to the financial
records of two of its citizens with bank accounts in Washington
state.
   In the 9-0 decision, the Supreme Court said a federal law aimed
at protecting criminal suspects who also are being investigated by
the Internal Revenue Service does not apply to tax probes by foreign
governments.
   In 1987, the 9th U.S. Court of Appeals had blocked an effort by
the IRS to obtain records of Philip Stuart and Mons Kapoor on behalf
of the Canadian Department of National Revenue. Canada's DNR, the
equivalent of the IRS, had requested the documents under the tax
treaty providing for exchange of information between the two nations.
   U.S. government officials had criticized the appeals ruling
saying it could affect U.S. treaty obligations with several foreign
governments and impair the ability of U.S. investigators to obtain
foreign financial records.
   The TWA case stemmed from a dispute between the airline and the
IFFA, who called a strike on March 7, 1986, after contract
negotiations broke down. The previous contract had expired July 31,
1984.
   TWA hired the new flight attendants after the strike began. In
addition, some 1,280 TWA flight attendants crossed picket lines
either at the outset of the walkout or as the strike continued for
more than two months.
   After the strike ended, the union filed a federal lawsuit
charging TWA with illegally refusing to reinstate more than 2,000
striking workers.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 1987 that striking
flight attendants were entitled to their old jobs at the expense of
less senior flight attendants who had crossed the picket lines.
   O'Connor said that preferential treatment for cross-overs does
not violate seniority protections because workers who stayed out on
strike but were reinstated after the walk-out ended retain their
seniority rights over cross-overs with less seniority.

<HEAD>John Wanamaker Fined Over Credit Bias Against Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Department store chain John Wanamaker has
been ordered to pay $90,000 and subject its credit process to future
review to settle a federal complaint that it discriminated against
female credit applicants.
   The government claimed Wanamaker violated the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act by approving or denying credit applications of
married couples based solely on the credit histories of husbands.
   ``This is the first time that we have brought a case that
involved a complaint that women...who had perfectly good credit
histories (but) were denied credit because Wanamakers only checked
their husbands' ratings,'' said Jean Noonan, the Federal Trade
Commission's associate director for credit practices.
   The agreement was part of a consent decree and other documents
filed Monday in U.S. District Court. Attorneys for the FTC said
Wanamaker had been discriminating against women seeking credit since
1977.
   Wanamaker agreed to comply with federal statutes governing equal
credit opportunity and allow the government to monitor its
performance for three years.
   Lawrence McDade, assistant director of the Justice Department's
Office of Consumer Litigation, said if a husband had a bad credit
record but his wife's credit history was good, credit would be
denied.
   ``It wasn't based on legitimate, objective criteria,'' McDade
said. ``It was based on sex.''
   John Wanamaker, which is owned by Woodward &amp; Lothrop department
stores of Washington, runs 15 stores with annual sales of about $410
million and more than 700,000 credit-card holders.
   Woodward &amp; Lothrop said the FTC's complaint involved credit
practices at Wanamaker that preceded its acquisition of the chain in
late 1986.
   Penalties for violations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act can
run higher than $200,000. Noonan said the $90,000 fine is ``around
the middle range.''
   Wanamaker must pay the fine within 10 days. It also must report
to the FTC within 60 days on how it is complying with the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act.
   In addition, Wanamaker must submit to the FTC a random sample of
up to 2,000 credit applications that have been approved, rejected or
withdrawn within the prior 12 months, and make available upon
request all applications filed during the next 25 months.

<HEAD>Two Business Groups Reject Voluntary Wage, Price Guidelines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAUL O. GARCES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the nation's biggest
business groups on Tuesday announced they no longer will comply with
voluntary wage and price guidelines imposed last August to hold down
inflation.
   Leaders of the Argentine Industrial Union and the Argentine
Chamber of Commerce said they withdrew from the official Committee
on Prices and Supplies because of the government's inability to
control interest rates that last week neared 40 percent a month.
   Inflation in January was 8.9 percent, or nearly twice what the
Economy Ministry projected a month earlier. Inflation for February
was projected to be 10 percent or greater.
   ``Today...we repeat the request for policies that reverse the
strong recessive process and normalize the financial system in order
to end interest rates that are...destroying production,'' the
Industrial Union said in a communique.
   The Chamber of Commerce withdrawal followed a meeting of its
executive board, chaired by president Carlos de la Vega.
   The so-called ``Spring Plan'' of voluntary price and wage
guidelines, and low increases in the cost of public services, was
implemented seven months ago following a 25.6 increase in July
inflation.
   Organized labor, particularly the four million-member General
Labor Confederation, complained it was not represented on the price
committee, and that workers were losing purchasing power because
wages were not keeping pace with price increases.
   This week, mail carriers, teachers, train personnel, court clerks
and others threatened to strike if they were not granted wage
increases above the voluntary guidelines. Tuesday evening, commuter
train service was suspended by a rush hour wildcat strike.
   The Spring Plan was implemented with an eye to national elections
on May 14 _ the ruling Radical Civic Union knew it was unlikely to
retain control with monthly inflation in the double digits.
   The plan initially seemed successful in throttling inflation. The
rate was was 27.6 percent in August and in single digits beginning
in October.
   But inflation _ which amounted to 387 percent in 1988 and has
been triple-digit in 12 of the past 13 years _ is revivng: After
bottoming out at 5.7 percent in November, it has risen every month.
   Three weeks ago, the Economy Ministry touched off a 50 percent
increase in the dollar by announcing it no longer would intervene in
exchange markets to prop up the austral, Argentina's national
currency.
   The goal of the policy _ which exporters said drained revenue
that legitimitely belonged to them _ was to hold down import prices
and thus curb inflation.
   That policy cost the Central Bank $1.7 billion, including $486
million during the first week of February.
   Last week, the Economy Ministry made a concession to exporters by
allowing them to sell a greater percentage of their foreign exchange
revenue to the Central Bank at a higher rate, though still far less
than 100 percent at the free rate.
   But exporters, particularly farmers whose crops and livestock
account for the biggest share of Argentina's exports, were
unsatisfied.
   On Tuesday, the Central Bank bought dollars from exporters at the
official rate of 14.68 australs per dollar, the ``special'' rate of
18.35 australs, and the free rate of 28.10 australs.
   Members of the public paid 28.20 australs per dollar at foreign
exchange houses.
   On Feb. 3, before the Economy Ministry measures were announced,
the public rate was 17.59 australs. Stores and supermarkets have
marked up prices ever since, despite government prohibitions.

<HEAD>Morton Thiokol Stock Up After Split Announcement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Morton Thiokol Inc. stock rose sharply
Tuesday in the wake of the company's announcement that it is
splitting its aerospace and commercial operations.
   The Chicago-based company announced Monday it planned to return
the name Thiokol Corp. to its aerospace group and create a new
specialty chemical, airbag and salt company to be called Morton
International Inc.
   The move is expected to be final July 1, provided the Internal
Revenue Service rules it will be tax-free and the stockholders
approve, company officials said.
   Morton Thiokol stock rose $2.25 to close at $42.25 in New York
Stock Exchange trading Tuesday.
   Industry analysts applauded the company's decision.
   ``I'm a little surprised, but this is a positive (move) for the
company and a benefit for shareholders,'' said Robert Bartels of
William Blair &amp; Co.
   Bartels said the aerospace business had depressed the price of
the company's stock.
   Morton Thiokol's aerospace group was forced to undertake a $500
million redesign of the space shuttle booster motor following the
1986 Challenger explosion, which was blamed on a faulty booster
joint.
   But Bartels said the drag on the stock would exist even without
the Challenger disaster because of the nature of defense work today
_ lower spending demanded by Congress.
   Morton Thiokol stockholders will receive a share-for-share
distribution of Morton International stock. Company officials said
the stock of both companies likely will qualify for listing on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   The Utah-based aerospace group, which manufactures the shuttle
booster motor and other defense propulsion systems, was acquired in
1982 by Morton Norwich and the merged company was called Morton
Thiokol Inc.
   The action is expected to have little change on the Utah
operation, headquartered in Ogden, said aerospace group president Ed
Garrison, who will stay on as president and chief operating officer
of Thiokol Corp.
   Indeed, he said, Thiokol plans to bid on a $2 million-plus
shuttle booster contract that would stretch through the mid-1990s.
   The company, which employs about 7,500 workers at its
manufacturing and testing facility near Brigham City, is the state's
largest private employer. Another 500 to 600 workers affiliated with
the Utah operation are based at Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   The aerospace operation has a total of more than 12,000 employees.
   Morton International plans to maintain a presence in Utah,
keeping its salt manufacturing facility at the Great Salt Lake and
maintaining the Ogden plant where 350 people manufacture inflatable
airbags for automobiles.
   But Garrison said the aerospace company retains 40 percent of the
solid rocket propulsion industry's business and anticipates further
success.
   ``Sales are expected to be more than $1 billion for 1989,''
Garrison said. ``We will wind up with a very strong company.''
   The company has said the new Thiokol is expected to have sales of
about $1.1 billion and assets of $800 million, while Morton
International would have an estimated 1989 sales of $1.5 billion,
assets of $1.4 billion and 8,000 employees.

   Ford Motor Co. on Tuesday recalled about
246,000 1983 model cars because of potential problems with emission
control systems.
   The company said vehicles included in the recall are Ford
Mustang, Capri and Thunderbird models along with Mercury Cougar, LTD
and Marquis cars.
   The recall affects all of the cars equipped with 3.8-liter, V-6
engines, except those built for sale in California, where state law
requires special pollution control systems.
   Ford said the federal Environmental Protection Agency had
determined that some of the cars emitted excessive levels of carbon
monoxide and hydrocarbons.
   Owners of the cars will be notified by mail and repairs will be
performed at no cost to the customer, Ford said.

   Sales of existing homes fell 7.4 percent in
January, the biggest decline in two years, as activity returned to
more normal levels following a December sales spurt, a real estate
trade group reported Tuesday.
   The National Association of Realtors said that existing
single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 3.63 million units in January following a 5.7 percent rise in
December to a rate of 3.92 million.
   It was the biggest one-month drop since a 13.3 percent drop in
January 1987 and left the pace of sales at its slowest point since
July.
   Analysts, however, said they were not overly concerned, noting
that the December sales pace had been the fastest sales rate in two
years. Even with the January setback, sales were still 13.4 percent
above where they were in January 1988.
   ``Overall, January's activity shows signs of another strong year
for home sales,'' said Ira Gribin, president of the Realtors. ``The
market is now dominated by the volume of buyers, many of whom are
repeat purchasers in their peak income years.''
   Homes prices continued to rise in January, even with the decline
in sales. The median price of a home rose 3.2 percent to $91,500.
   John Tuccillo, chief economist for the Realtors, said the price
increase would have been even larger if it had not been for an
increase in sales volume at the low-end of the price range as buyers
altered their choices due to rising mortgage rates.
   Mortgage rates, as tracked by a national survey done by the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., hit 10.78 percent last week with
many economists expecting them to soon pass 11 percent.
   The month-to-month sales decline was led by a sharp 12.6 percent
drop in the South, which fell to an annual rate of 1.31 million
units.
   Sales in the West declined by 8.6 percent to an annual rate of
640,000 units while sales in the Midwest fell 5.9 percent to an
annual rate of 950,000 units.
   The Northeast was the only region of the country posting a sales
increase from December to January, a 1.4 percent rise to annual rate
of 710,000 units.

   Lawyers for GAF Corp. asked a federal judge
Tuesday to dismiss the securities fraud case against the company,
saying federal prosecutors had not proven stock manipulation charges.
   ``The government's case ended with the fact that one of its two
principal witnesses testified that he didn't think he was
manipulating stock in Union Carbide and he still doesn't think so,''
defense lawyer Max Gitter said.
   James T. Melton, chief trader at the West Coast brokerage firm
Jefferies &amp; Co., testified that while he sought to assure that Union
Carbide stock closed at a specific price he had not attempted to
deceive investors.
   Defense lawyers said stock manipulation charges were unfounded
because the government had offered no proof GAF had intended to
induce investors to buy the stock.
   Melton and broker Boyd L. Jefferies were the government's key
witnesses in the GAF case, the first to be heard by a jury developed
on information supplied by jailed speculator Ivan Boesky.
   Melton, testifying under an immunity agreement reached with
prosecutors, backed up Jefferies' earlier testimony that he sought
to inflate the stock price of Union Carbide Corp. to $22 a share in
October 1986.
   GAF and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, are charged with
illegally trying through the stock purchases to raise the Carbide
stock price. GAF held 10 million Union Carbide shares after an
unsuccessful takeover attempt. In November, GAF sold 5 million
shares for $23 each.
   Gitter said that while GAF naturally wanted to sell its Union
Carbide holdings at the highest possible price, neither GAF nor
Jefferies &amp; Co. did anything illegal in trying to boost the price of
the shares.
   The government's theory of market manipulation ``is not only
novel, it's unsound,'' Gitter said. ``There was no distortion of the
market.''
   The defense also sought to have U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson
Lowe strike portions of Jefferies' testimony about Melton on the
grounds that it was hearsay, and said the deletions would be so
great as to require a mistrial.
   Prosecutors contentested the challenges and said the trial should
continue. Lowe said she would consider the defense motion to dismiss
the case and rule later.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl H. Loewenson Jr. argued that GAF and
Sherwin directed Jefferies to make large purchases of Union Carbide
near the close of trading on the New York and Pacific stock
exchanges on Oct. 29 and Oct. 30, 1986, to push the closing price to
$22 or higher.
   He said they entered the market not to make investments, but to
manipulate the price and induce investors to purchase Union Carbide.
   ``What Mr. Sherwin was interested in was boosting the price at a
time his company held 10 million shares,'' Loewenson said.
   The judge, however, indicated she was not convinced by the
government's argument and said it would be difficult to determine
GAF's and Sherwin's motives.
   ``How does one differentiate between the raising of stock prices
in a legitimate trade in the market from an illegal trade?'' Lowe
asked. ``You cannot X-ray the mind of a person to determine what he
is thinking at a particular time.''
   GAF was named in a 10-count indictment handed up last July
charging the Wayne, N.J. chemicals manufacturer with stock
manipulation, securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy.
   An earlier hearing ended in a mistrial in January when Lowe found
that a prosecutor had improperly but unintentionally withheld
evidence.

<HEAD>Nuclear Power Group Praises Turnaround At Peach Bottom Plant</HEAD>

   A nuclear industry group Tuesday praised
management improvements by Philadelphia Electric Co. at its Peach
Bottom nuclear plant, which a year ago the group called a national
embarrassment.
   The Institute of Nuclear Power Operations said the utility has
adequately addressed the industry group's three recommendations of a
year ago.
   ``It is evident to INPO and to other close observers that the
company has made and is continuing to make considerable progress in
achieving the necessary cultural change'' said Zack T. Pate,
president of INPO, in a letter to the utility's chairman.
   The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission ordered Peach Bottom
closed in March 1987 when control room operators were found sleeping
on the job. The NRC said last month that the utility had made good
on an ambitious plan designed to get the idled plant restarted as
soon as April.
   The letter from Atlanta-based INPO, released Tuesday by
Philadelphia Electric, was a sharp turnabout from the highly
critical report of a year ago that described the utility's
performance as ``an embarrassment to the industry and the nation''
at the Delta, Pa., plant.
   The group recommended a detailed analysis of the utility's
internal investigation of the plant, that the utility avoid actions
that are outside normal organizational procedures and that it make
major changes in corporate management.
   The retirement of Philadelphia Electric President John H. Austin
Jr. was announced the same day last year's letter was released.
   Philadelphia Electric, which operates the plant, and the three
other utilities that also own the plant announced last year they
would share the burden of a record $1.25 million NRC fine.
   INPO is an independent industry watchdog group composed of the
utilities owning and operating nuclear plants. It was formed in 1979
after the accident at the Three Mile Island reactor.
