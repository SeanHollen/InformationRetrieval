<HEAD>26 Sinhalese Militants Surrender</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday declared a
week-long cease-fire with Sinhalese and Tamil rebels, and an
official said 26 Sinhalese militants surrendered under President
Ranasinghe Premadasa's peace plan.
   The militants, belonging to the Marxist People's Liberation
Front, gave themselves up at temples and government offices
Wednesday, said the military official, who cannot be identified
under briefing rules. He did not give details.
   Premadasa, seeking to end six years of ethnic violence that has
claimed 12,500 lives, announced a general amnesty and unilateral
cease-fire to Sinhalese and Tamil rebels.
   The offer was part of a peace package that included seats in
Parliament and jobs for the militants. The cease-fire began a day
before Sinhalese and Tamils celebrate a common new year.
   The government also set up 228 centers at schools, temples and
government offices across the country where the rebels could give
themselves up.
   The front has not yet responded to the truce offer but the
largest Tamil militant group, campaigning to set up an independent
state in Northern and Northeastern Provinces, rejected it outright
Tuesday.
   However, ``the militants have a week to surrender and it is too
early to make a decision about the response to the surrender
call,'' the military official said.
   No militants surrendered in the capital. The chief priest of
Buddhist temples in Colombo said ``nobody turned up'' at the
shrines where reception centers were set up for receiving the
rebels.
   An official at a reception center in Weligama, 85 miles south of
Colombo, said on the telephone: ``We have a whole lot of armed
police here but nobody to surrender.''
   The south is the Sinhalese heartland where the Marxist rebels
are most active. The extremists have been blamed for more than
2,500 political killings since January and most of the victims have
been government officials and security men.
   The militants have been trying to topple the government since
July 1987 when it signed a peace accord aimed at ending the Tamil
separatist campaign.
   The left-wing extremists say the accord gave the minority Tamils
too many concessions. They also say the presence of Indian troops,
deployed to disarm the Tamil rebels and enforce the 1987 accord,
compromises the country's independence.
   An Indian High Commission or embassy offical said Indian troops
will continue to carry out operations against the Tamil rebels.
   But the troops will not hinder the ``process of surrendering,''
said the offical who cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   The dominant Tamil rebel group, Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, said Tuesday: ``We will not agree to any cease-fire so long
as the Indian army remains in Sri Lanka.''
   India became involved in the conflict because of the sympathies
of its own 60 million Tamils to the rebel cause.
   Tamil militants launched a campaign in 1983 for an independent
homeland, citing discrimination by the majority Sinhalese in
employment and education.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Most live in the Northern and Northeastern Provinces, where they
want their homeland. Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the island's
population and control the government and military.

<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas fired rockets and
heavy artillery into the eastern city of Jalalabad, but Afghan
troops returned fire and forced the guerrillas to retreat, a
government spokesman said Wednesday.
   Also Wednesday, Iran-based guerrilla leaders were quoted as
saying plans were under way for an offensive near Kabul.
   In Singapore, an Afghan resistance leader, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar,
said the resistance plans to shift its interim government this week
from Pakistan to the ``liberated'' Afghanistan provinces of Kunar
and Paktia.
   Hekmatyar, foreign minister of the interim government set up in
February by several guerrilla groups, told a news conference
Wednesday that the entire Cabinet would move within the ``next two
to three days,'' some ministries to Asadabad, capital of Kunar, and
others to a site still be decided in Paktia.
   Hekmatyar was in Singapore on an eight-nation tour to seek
recognition for his government. Malaysia announced Tuesday if will
formally recognize the interim government.
   Mohammad Karim Khalili, spokesman of the Iran-based guerrillas,
said at a news conference in Tehran that ``forces in the city of
Meidan, near Kabul, and in Ghazi and areas to the north of the
capital are preparing to start operations, and soon a new front
will be opened near Kabul,'' Tehran radio reported.
   The guerrillas are split into the Iran-based Shiite coalition
and the larger Sunni alliance based in Pakistan. The two have been
at odds over the formation of a guerrilla government, in which the
Shiite alliance is not represented.
   An unidentified official of the Shiite alliance was quoted by
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency as saying that ``plans
to attack Kabul have been drawn up and efforts are under way to
unite all mujahedeen groups for delivering the coup de grace.''
   Pakistan-based guerrilla groups have been engaged in heavy
fighting for Jalalabad since March 6.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said 19 civilians
died and 15 were wounded in the latest rebel attack on Jalalabad,
45 miles from the border with Pakistan.
   ``Government forces counterattacked and forced the opposition to
halt their offensive and retreat,'' he said.
   Amani said there were no casualties among government soldiers.
He said 271 guerrillas were killed and 201 were injured.
   The information could not be independently confirmed.
   The guerrillas, known as mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors,
have been fighting nearly 11 years to topple Afghanistan's Marxist
government.
   Capturing Jalalabad is considered a key element in their
strategy because it would give the guerrillas their first major
urban foothold.
   Amani also said U.N. checkpoints will be set up at six points
along the Afghan-Pakistani border to check for aid Afghanistan
alleges is flowing to the guerrillas illegally from Pakistan.
   Pakistan agreed Tuesday to allow the U.N. to set up permanent
monitoring posts along the border. It denies the Afghan allegations.
   The checkpoints will be manned by the U.N. Good Office Mission
to Afghanistan and Pakistan, which monitored the withdrawal of
Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   In Iran, Khalili said the Iran-based forces oppose the U.N.
deployment.
   Rasul Sayyaf, prime minister of the rebels' provisional
government, told U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on
Wednesday to stay clear of what he called a dying Kabul
government's desperate tactic to draw the Security Council into a
domestic war.
   In a letter, he asked the U.N. chief to pre-empt a Security
Council debate and if that was not possible, then to ``steer the
debate on the right course _ Russian interference in Afghanistan.''
   Afghanistan's ruling Marxists charged in an emergency session of
the Security Council Tuesday that Pakistan was waging a
``full-fledged war'' against Kabul and intervening in the war by
sending Pakistani army and milita to the battlefront. Pakistan
denied these charges, which have repeatedly been leveled by the
Kabul government.

   Authorities found 12 male bodies in
graves at a ranch just south of the Mexican border Tuesday and said
the victims were sacrificed by a satanic cult of drug smugglers.
   ``It was horrible,'' Cameron County Sheriff Alex Perez told a
news conference in this border city. ``It was like a human
slaughterhouse.''
   Mexican Federal Judicial Police arrested four people, said
sheriff's Lt. George Gavito. Gavito said the suspects were U.S. and
Mexican citizens, but did not identify them further.
   The dead found by the federal police included 21-year-old
University of Texas student Mark Kilroy, who vanished during his
spring break last month while in the Mexican city of Matamoros,
Gavito said.
   Kilroy apparently was chosen at random by drug smugglers who
hoped human sacrifices would protect them from harm, Gavito said.
He was taken after the cult members ``were told to pick one Anglo
male that particular night,'' the lieutenant said.
   The cult had been involved in human sacrifices for about nine
months, he said, and prayed to the devil ``so the police would not
arrest them, so bullets would not kill them and so they could make
more money.''
   Authorities found candles and kettles full of body parts and
animal bones, said Oran Neck, chief U.S. Customs agent in
Brownsville.
   A small color snapshot displayed at the news conference showed a
caldron containing a dark, red liquid and what appeared to be
bones. Another picture showed 12 body bags.
   Authorities would not identify the other victims, but said all
were males.
   One grave held three bodies another contained two, said Neck.
Some victims were shot in the head, while others appeared to have
been slain with machetes or sledgehammers, the agent said.
   The bodies were found Tuesday morning in a field about 20 miles
west of Matamoros, Gavito said.
   ``I've been an investigator 15 years and it's one of the worst
things I've ever seen,'' he said.
   Kilroy's brain was missing, said Brownsville Herald photographer
Anthony Padilla, who said he saw the body at a Matamoros funeral
home. ``There was nothing inside the skull,'' Padilla said.
   In some forms of witchcraft, removal of the brain signifies a
sacrifice of the victim's soul.
   Padilla said Kilroy's legs were cut off at mid-calf and his
spine was severed and twisted.
   Kilroy, a pre-medical student, vanished from a crowded Matamoros
street shortly after 2 a.m. on March 14 while on a drinking foray
with a group of friends in Matamoros, a city of 180,000 just across
the Rio Grande from Brownsville.
   Law officers on both sides of the border were stumped, with no
clues to Kilroy's disappearance despite an intensive search, the
questioning of nearly 100 people and a $15,000 reward.
   The 3-foot-deep grave containing Kilroy's body was found after
Mexican federal police alerted U.S. officials early Tuesday that
they had obtained confessions from the suspects, officials said.
   At least one of the suspects admitted involvement in Kilroy's
death, said Neck.
   The student's parents, Helen and James Kilroy of Santa Fe,
Texas, arrived in Brownsville on Tuesday following the grisly
discovery.
   Gwen Huddleston, the mother of one of the students with Kilroy
the night he vanished, took the Kilroys to the airport for the trip.
   ``Helen (Kilroy) of course is very upset after finding out the
news that it really was Mark down there,'' she told KTRK-TV in
Houston later. ``They went down there in hopes that it wouldn't be,
but it didn't turn out that way.''
   Authorities refused to talk about the evidence or pinpoint the
location of the grave. The area was sealed, Gavito said.
   The case is being investigated by Customs, the U.S. Attorney
General's Office, Mexican federal authorities and local law
enforcement agencies on both sides of the border.
   It was the third drug-related mass killing discovered near the
border in less than three weeks.
   On March 29, Mexican authorities found the bodies of three women
and six men on an abandoned ranch near Agua Prieta, Mexico, just
across the border from Douglas, Ariz.
   Five were at the bottom of a well and four in an earthen septic
tank. All nine were bound and had been tortured and mutilated,
officials said. Mexican and U.S. investigators said the slayings
were drug-related.
   On April 1, the bodies of three more men killed in similar
fashion were fished from the well. All were believed to be Mexican
nationals.
   On March 27, two people from Arizona and three from the Mexican
state of Sonora were found bound and stabbed in a shed in Tucson.
Those deaths were also called drug-related.
   Officials said Thursday it was possible the Tucson and the Agua
Prieta cases were linked.
   Herbal medicine and the use of witch doctors, or ``curanderos,''
is common in Mexico. Most markets in Mexico City have stalls where
herbs are sold for cures, to cast or remove good or bad spells or
to cleanse a home of evil.
   Human sacrifice, common in the country's pre-Columbian Indian
cultures, is little known now, but is not unheard of. It is said to
be used occasionally in rituals in which one person is killed as
part of curing another. One such case was reported earlier this
year in Mexico City.

<HEAD>An Unknown Jerome Kern Musical Comes Back To New York</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Imagine Andrew Lloyd Webber or Stephen Sondheim
not allowing songs from their latest musicals to be recorded or
played on the radio or performed in nightclubs and cabarets.
   Jerome Kern issued such an edict after the opening of ``Sitting
Pretty,'' his 1924 musical written with Guy Bolton and P.G.
Wodehouse.
   Why the ban?
   Kern was a man who wanted his music played the way he wrote it
and not jazzed up or distorted by popular renditions. He was a
perfectionist, although some musical comedy historians think the
prohibition may have been a ploy by Kern to create more interest in
the show.
   If it was, it didn't work. Despite generally good reviews, the
musical had a disappointing run of only 95 performances and
promptly was forgotten. Eiht or nine of its songs were published,
but much of the score disappeared until it was unearthed in a
Secaucus, N.J., warehouse seven years ago.
   Now ``Sitting Pretty'' returns to New York for five performances
in a concert version at Carnegie Recital Hall (April 13 through
April 16). It will be conducted by John McGlinn, the man behind the
recent complete and critically praised recording of ``Show Boat.''
   The concerts, performed with a 23-piece orchestra and an
18-member cast, star Davis Gaines, Jason Graae, Kim Criswell and
Paige O'Hara.
   For McGlinn, ``Sitting Pretty'' is a labor of love, a chance to
perform a musical not heard in New York for 65 years.
   ``Nobody knows the score at all,'' said McGlinn who considers
the work an important transition piece, a bridge between Kern's
less serious, early musicals and his masterpiece, ``Show Boat.''
   ``Robert Russell Bennett, who orchestrated many of Kern's
musicals, would sometimes refer to `Sitting Pretty' in interviews,
saying that it was something that people someday should hear again
because it was special,'' he said.
   McGlinn first heard the music in 1980 when Bill Tynes of the New
Amsterdam Theater Company let McGlinn raid his sheet music
collection.
   ``It was so different and so beautiful, and on an emotional
plane so far removed from many of the other things Kern was writing
at the time,'' he said. ``This score has the deepest emotional
depth of anything he wrote until `Show Boat.'
   ``I don't know what part of himself Kern dug down into to create
this score, and I should say Wodehouse did as well because the
lyrics are as moving and emotional as a lot of the music.''
   The creators didn't get it from the frivolous plot, concocted by
Wodehouse and Bolton, which involves twin orphans who fall in love
with the real and adopted sons of a wealthy old man.
   ``It's extraordinary because there is this wild dichotomy
between the book and parts of the score which are really emotional
_ songs like `There Isn't One Girl,' `A Year From Today' and `The
Magic Train.' It's the real thing. When the music starts, playtime
stops,'' McGlinn said.
   ``I think it comes from the fact that Kern, by 1924, was ready
to flex his muscles. And when he saw opportunities to write truly
emotional music, he went for it.''
   ``Sitting Pretty'' remained unperformable until the Secaucus
discovery where a full score for the show as well as a lot of
Kern's working sketches were found.
   The Carnegie concerts will also include 95 percent of the show's
dialogue. McGlinn discovered a late draft of the script in the
Museum of the City of New York. Between that script, an early copy
filed at the Library of Congress in Washington and the full scores
found in Secaucus, he was able to piece together a book for the
performers to use.
   Kern has been a major preoccupation of McGlinn's for a long
time. In 1985, he did concert versions at Carnegie of Kern's ``Oh,
Boy!,'' ``Oh, Lady! Lady!!'' and ``Zip! Goes a Million.''
   Besides ``Show Boat,'' McGlinn has a recording of Kern
overtures, including ``Sitting Pretty,'' coming out in May on
EMI-Angel. He also has a complete version of Cole Porter's
``Anything Goes'' waiting for release on the same label. His other
upcoming projects include new recordings of Porter's ``Kiss Me,
Kate'' and possibly Irving Berlin's ``Annie Get Your Gun.''
   For the moment, though, he's concentrating on Kern and the
concert version of ``Sitting Pretty.''
   Musical comedy buffs will savor one number in particular, the
title song. It was dropped a week into the musical's original run
because leading man Dwight Frye had a minor speech impediment.
   When Frye sang, ``I like to sit, just sit and sit and sit, with
you the whole day through,'' it sounded, according to Kern
biographer Gerald Bordman ``embarrassingly different.'' McGlinn's
concerts should rescue the song.

   A group of middle-class men, concerned that
friends were dying and nothing was being done, met in Greenwich
Village eight years ago.
   They called themselves Gay Men's Health Crisis. They had little
money and less clout; there was no name for the disease that
brought them together.
   Today, Gay Men's Health Crisis has a $10 million budget, its own
six-story Manhattan building and 2,000 volunteers, and the disease
has a name: acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   After years of hectoring politicians and public health officials
to address the problems of people with AIDS, GMHC and its cohorts
are themselves being challenged to cope with the changing face of
that population.
   Nationwide, more than 87,000 cases of AIDS have been reported,
about two-thirds of them among homosexual or bisexual men. But in
many cities, especially along the East Coast, someone diagnosed
with AIDS today is about as likely to have become infected by
shooting up with dirty needles as through sex.
   In New York City, intravenous drug abusers comprised an
estimated 45 percent of all newly reported AIDS cases last year.
``These projections bear out what we have long known, that the
spread of AIDS is fueled by drugs (and) that AIDS is accelerating
its onslaught upon poor, drug-ravaged neighborhoods and minority
communities,'' said city Health Commissioner Stephen Joseph.
   In New Jersey, IV drug abusers comprised 59 percent of new AIDS
cases.
   What this means to AIDS-service providers is only now being
addressed.
   San Francisco, with the most people with AIDS per capita of any
U.S. city, wins praise from all quarters for its response to the
epidemic.
   Its Shanti Project, a peer-counseling group for the terminally
ill, had one staffer in 1982 and was nearly defunct. Now it has a
$3 million budget and a paid staff of 70, directing counseling
groups and a housing program geared toward independent living for
people with AIDS.
   But Greg Day, Shanti's education director, notes that about 96
percent of AIDS cases in the city are among gay males ``who used to
lead relatively normal lives,'' were employed full time and have a
firmer footing in society.
   ``I think that because the impact of AIDS has been primarily,
overwhelmingly, on the gay community thus far, we have succeeded so
far in developing our resources along with the epidemic,'' he said.
``We don't have the answers yet on how to best serve the IV
drug-user population.''
   The situation is similar in Los Angeles, Seattle, Minneapolis,
and other cities where the number of IV drug users is relatively
small, experts say.
   In Chicago, things are more difficult.
   ``What we're dealing with here in Chicago, particularly when
we're dealing with the issue of homelessness and destitution, is
not the gay community, but blacks, minorities, IV drug users,
prostitutes and their families _ people of the streets basically,''
said Al Mascia of Travelers and Immigrants Aid, a private group
that helps house homeless people with AIDS.
   ``While we want to adopt some of the programs or utilize some of
the models that San Francisco has, we're talking about working with
a different population for the most part,'' Mascia said.
   Part of the problem is that an IV drug user does not
automatically kick the habit when diagnosed with AIDS. But most
AIDS organizations require infected drug abusers to enter treatment
before they are accepted as clients.
   ``It's fine for us to deal with you as someone with ARC
(AIDS-related condition) or AIDS,'' said Tim Sweeney, GMHC deputy
director for policy. ``But the truth is if you're just leaving our
front door and going out and sticking another needle in your arm,
we're really not doing you any big favor.
   ``You've got two illnesses to be dealt with.''
   Programs such as GMHC and the Shanti Project depend on
volunteers, but Sweeney said, ``We are finding now that ... the
volunteer model really doesn't work with them. They need much more
direct, intense case management, much more involvement, usually by
a professional staff person to help them set up the structure of
their life, so that they're independent.''
   The drug abuser also is more likely to be homeless, yet shelters
are no place for someone infected with AIDS. Several cities run
apartments for people with AIDS capable of independent living, but
demand far outstrips supply.
   People with AIDS who no longer need hospitalization but have no
place to go often are sent to single-room-occupancy hotels, where
they have no medical supervision and must contend with seedy
surroundings and crime.
   Many are ``discharged from the hospital and can sit on the bench
out front,'' said Larry Ellis of Lifelink, a Washington-based AIDS
organization.
   In New York, a lucky few find room in the highly praised,
privately run Bailey House, the city's only supervised AIDS
residence. It opened in 1986 with rooms for 44 people and hopes to
add nine more rooms by the summer of 1990.
   For Lawrence Conklin, 38, a 20-year heroin and cocaine addict
diagnosed with AIDS about two years ago, a clean, nicely furnished
room at Bailey House and a treatment program ``was the only thing
that saved me.''
   Yet even Bailey House has evicted several residents because of
drug-related problems, said its administrator, Gordon Hough.
   ``We consider ourselves a humane society, and I don't think we
should doubly punish a person who's already suffering,'' said Diane
Doherty, a member of the National Coalition for the Homeless board.
   ``I would be hard pressed to make the argument that every single
program has to accept people who ... `go off the wagon.' Perhaps
what we need, maybe, is a house in a community where people who
cannot stop have a place to go.''
   GMHC also wants to see a range of services targeted at specific
populations, but Sweeney said his organization, despite its
position as the nation's largest private AIDS-service organization,
can't be expected to be all things to all people. Gay and bisexual
men still make up 80 percent of GMHC's caseload of 2,500
HIV-infected people, and ``just taking care of that burden alone is
extremely daunting,'' he said.
   Some former volunteers and other AIDS activists have criticized
GMHC for, among other things, not sharing more of its resources
with smaller groups, but Sweeney said GMHC doesn't want to appear
arrogant.
   ``We're real conscious of our limitations. We believe in
empowerment. We believe in communities taking care of themselves
and getting the resources and asserting their own leadership...
   ``The future is to get a bigger pie and to get other people
involved with the disease... A lot of the policy and advocacy work
that we're doing is around this issue of budgets and getting money
out to communities who don't have the access and the political
organizing skills that we do...
   ``I think we are around for a much longer fight than maybe some
people anticipated.''

   Air and water pollution have

pollutants are taking a heavy toll in West Germany as far as the

   West German officials are considering an offer of money and
technology to help the East German communist government clean it up.
   ``The water quality of the Elbe River is particularly critical
when it reaches West Germany,'' said Karl Huthmacher, a spokesman
for the West German Environmental Protection Ministry. ``Air
pollution has also reached dangerous levels.''
   The Greenpeace ecological group's West German branch said the
Elbe carries wastes to the North Sea, where ``plant and animal life
are seriously threatened and destroyed.''
   It also said human health is also increasingly at risk from
contaminated drinking water.
   In Leipzig and many East German cities, power plants using
high-sulphur brown coal belch out huge clouds of smoke that stings
the eyes and coats buildings with black soot. Heavy exhaust fumes
from cars, trucks and buses further foul the air.
   Western studies indicate that East Germany pumps more pollution
into the atmosphere than any other country in Europe, including
nearly 5 million tons a year of sulphur dioxide, according to West
German surveys.
   After the oil price rises in the 1970s, East Germany
increasingly turned to its considerable brown coal reserves.
   Statistics on the extent of pollution are not made public in
East Germany, but the government is under pressure to release them.
   An East German ecological group called the Green Network Arche
has demanded that the government ``stop treating evidence of
environmental pollution as state secrets.''
   Underground ecology newspapers detailing local pollution
problems are frequently seized.
   While East German officials have shown an increased willingless
to work with West Germany on environmental problems, Western
experts say they are still a long way from concrete and effective
measures.
   ``Working groups from both sides are still working to come up
with an acceptable program to help reduce the problems,'' said
Marlene Muehe, a spokeswoman for the West German Environmental
Ministry in Bonn.
   East German officials said at a recent environmental conference
in East Berlin that a number of new projects had been launched to
reduce river pollution and that the Elbe River would likely be
cleaned up by 1992.
   Hans Reichelt, East Germany's Minister for Environmental
Protection, was quoted in the state-run media as saying that all
new and refitted power plants would be equipped with filtration
devices beginning next year.
   But West German officials say that in order to make any
substantial progress soon, West Germany will have to provide the
East Germans with technology and financial assistance.
   While East Germany was the first Eastern European nation to
enact strict environmental laws, the guidelines are rarely
enforced, Western officials say.
   West German government studies indicate that cleanup tasks will
be difficult because East Germany has largely abandoned
environmental protection programs in recent years.
   ``The last two five-year plans have contained neither a detailed
environmental program nor funds to carry out projects outlined in
earlier plans,'' a West German government study said.
   ``Because of increasing economic pressures, East Germany has
made industrial growth and increased production a priority over
environmental protection.''
   West German officials, who are grappling with the heavily
industrialized nation's own formidable environmental problems, say
the East German pollution is of grave concern.
   ``Our own efforts to correct environmental problems are made
significantly more difficult because of the East German
pollutants,'' Environmental Protection Ministry spokesman
Huthmacher said in Bonn, referring to efforts to clean up the
nation's rivers and to reduce emissions that cause acid rain.
   West Germany's forests have suffered considerable damage because
of acid rain.
   Environmental experts also say East German factories dump tons
of untreated industrial wastes into waterways where it mixes with
the runoff from fields treated with nitrate fertilizers.
   Many major rivers flow into West Germany.
   According to Greenpeace, more than 100 tons of waste _ including
heavy metals, industrial sludge, raw sewage and pesticides _ flow
into the Elbe River each day in East Germany.

<TEXT>
   For 11 days, Guido Casciano has
fought the battle of Sawmill Bay, riding herd on wave after wave of
oil with his nimble 27-foot fishing boat.
   For 11 nights, he has slept in the boat's tiny cabin so he'd be
ready at first light to continue the deadening routine of coralling
oil away from the salmon hatchery up the bay.
   ``It's fairly boring, but hopefully we're doing some good
here,'' he said.
   Casciano and his fellow fishermen have done some good. But their
rescue of the hatchery is a brief skirmish in a losing fight to
limit the damage of 10 million gallons of crude oil spilled from
the tanker Exxon Valdez.
   ``It's really frustrating when you consider what little you're
accomplishing with all the effort here,'' said Gary Raymond, who
had his 48-foot Sound Adventure working with Casciano's Commitment
on Monday. ``When you think about what little oil you've picked up,
it blows your mind.''
   The view from above Prince William Sound speaks to the seeming
futility of the cleanup effort.
   The lower end of the sound is a checkerboard of oil. Rainbow
swirls of oil nudge the shore in the hundreds of lonely bays and
inlets. Mud-colored oil streamers stripe the deep green water of
the open sound.
   The powerful forces of nature have taken man's mistake and
scattered it hundreds of miles.
   No one knows this better than fishermen like Casciano and
Raymond, neighbors from Cordova who have looked to the sound for
their living.
   While officials dusted off contingency plans and held assessment
meetings, the fishermen of the sound streamed out of towns like
Cordova and Seward to do what they could.
   Most went without knowing they would be compensated for their
efforts. Casciano and Raymond were at Sawmill Bay for five days
before they received contracts from Exxon, the only contact they
have had with the company responsible for the spill.
   ``All of us figured that if nothing else, at least we're out
here doing something,'' said Casciano.
   The independent fishermen organized their own battle plan. Booms
were floated across the inner bay. The fishing boats took what
materials they could get and began collecting the oil, using the
same techniques they have used for years for fishing.
   A yellow, oil-smeared boom was attached at one end to
Commitment, the other to Sound Adventure. Using hand signals and
radio calls, the two boats moved in graceful ballet until clumps of
oil, resembling greasy brown oatmeal, were snared in the boom.
   The strategy is similar to the way two boats can use seining
nets to trap schools of salmon and herring.
   The oil was then floated to a ``sucker boat,'' a Navy skimmer
that sluices the oil from the water and into a small barge.
   But often, over the past two weeks, there has been no skimmer to
feed. The special boats can only swallow 32 barrels of oil before
their tanks are filled and they have to go unload.
   Whatever the fishermen are paid for the effort will fall short
of the cost of what the spill may do their way of life.
   Raymond lost at least $40,000 when the spill canceled the
herring harvest. In normal times, his wife and daughter would be on
the boat with him for weeks, helping catch fish.
   Carolyn Raymond was aboard Sound Adventure on Monday after
flying out to be with her husband. ``Everybody back at town is
worried that our way of life may be over,'' she said.
   Both the Raymonds and Casciano are pessimistic about what their
efforts mean against the massive amount of oil and unrelenting
forces of nature. But they say it is better to be on the water,
doing something, then sitting ashore.
   ``Maybe what you do is not going to make a dent, but you've got
to try to do something to help,'' said Raymond.

<DATELINE>CHANDIPUR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As dusk descends on this seaside
village, men light kerosene lamps and women keep conch shells handy
for a night vigil against the enemy _ a ballistic missile.
   It is not from an enemy country.
   Chandipur's 12,000 villagers want to stall the test-firing of
India's first long-range ballistic missile.
   They say it is potentially dangerous and eventually will make
them homeless. They fear the missile named ``AGNI,'' which means
``fire'' in Hindi, may carry nuclear warheads.
   The test-firing scheduled later this month will bracket India
along with the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Britain and
China in ballistic missile capability, military experts say.
   It also will enhance the power of India's 1.36 million-strong
army and the country's geopolitical influence in the region, they
say.
   ``It is more a technology demonstration, but it can be used in
defense should the country require,'' said V.S. Arunachalam, who
has overseen India's defense research since 1982.
   ``Will it carry nuclear warheads?'' he asked. ``If you want, you
can carry a nuclear warhead even on a bullock cart.''
   Since April 1987, India successfully has tested three types of
surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, with ranges varying
from 5{ to 155 miles.
   Villagers in Chandipur are being lured with money and promises
of free food and popular film videos if they leave their homes
during launch time and move to temporary camps set up in the area.
   But they refuse to budge, and the battle of wits shows no sign
of settlement.
   At the maximum-security launch site on the Bay of Bengal about
300 scientists and technocrats are putting final touches to the
missile.
   They expect it to travel between 370 miles and 1,550 miles, a
scientist said on condition of anonymity. The missile will carry a
one-ton payload.
   ``The project is one of great national importance,'' Lt. Gen.
R.S. Deswal, chief of National Test Range, said in an interview.
``This is what we are telling the villagers.''
   Military test-firing is nothing new to this village, where the
colonial British set up an arms and ammunition test range 95 years
ago.
   Scientists have been experimenting with two other missiles that
were test-fired in 1987 and in 1988.
   But what sparked the controversy surrounding the new missile was
an official announcement earlier this year asking villagers to
vacate their homes.
   ``For the past three years, we are asking the government what is
happening,'' said Arun Dey, a former legislator who heads the main
anti-missile group. ``Their stock reply was `nothing major, just
routine firing and enlarging the facilities.' Now out of the blue
they are telling us that they will fire a real big missile.''
   Most Chandipur residents are fishermen or farmers who arrived
here after the 1942 Bengal famine, which killed up to 1 million
people.
   ``Let them fire the missile, but we not going to leave our
homes,'' said Gaur Singh of the Chandipur People's Protection
Committee. ``They will have to fire a missile first at us and then
they can fire another at the sky.
   ``We have said we will not go,'' he said. ``We maintain a
nightlong vigil because we fear that they may force us out.''
   Conch shells are blown to alert people in other hamlets.
   The government wants the people living in a two-mile radius of
the launch pad to vacate their homes for four hours during the
launch.
   But villagers fear it is a ploy.
   ``We are not asking them to leave for good, just during the
launch period,'' said the general, who said officials have offered
every adult $5.20 and each child $2.60 as compensation.
   Singh said: ``It is good money, no doubt, but should you trade
your existence for that?''

   The city's population has declined for the second

the capital.
   Tokyo's population as of Jan. 1 was 11,718,720, down by 21,641

   The National Land Agency says the average land price in Tokyo is

<HEAD>Swiss Housewife Appeals Fine For Airing Duvet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A housewife is appealing a $25 fine for airing her
bedding after 10 a.m., saying the 30-year-old law that prohibits
the practice is outdated.
   The woman has enlisted the help of a biochemist to back her
claim that heavy pollution during morning rush hour makes it
impossible to air her bedding ``legally,'' Geneva's La Suisse
newspaper reported.
   Under 1955 public hygiene regulations in Geneva, anyone living
in an urban area who hangs duvets or carpets out of windows or over
balconies in public view after 10 a.m. can be fined.
   The clause, which remained in obscurity, made headlines in Swiss
newspapers Tuesday when the housewife, identified only as Claudine,
appealed the fine she received after a zealous policeman spotted
her offending duvet 30 minutes after the deadline.

   A miniature Koran by an unknown 10th century

collection, Christie's said.
   The auction house said the price paid Tuesday for the little
book of 332 vellum pages, less than three inches tall and written
in Eastern kufic script, was the highest ever paid for a Koran or
part of one.
   ``Finely written small Korans are much prized and very
saleable,'' said Caroline Blyth, the firm's head of Islamic
manuscripts.
   ``This one was very old and had the status of coming from the
estate of Crown Prince Muhammad Hasan Mirza Qajar, the sole
pretender to the throne of the Qajar dynasty in Persia which ended
in the 1920s,'' she said.
   The buyer was only identified as representing a European
collection. Christie's had put a top estimate on the Koran of
$169,000.
   A single decorated leaf from a large Koran made the previous
record of $268,000 in London in October.

<TEXT>
   Last year, the NCAA championship basketball game
gave CBS a rare first place for the week in the A.C. Nielsen Co.
television ratings.
   This year's game, in which Michigan defeated Seton Hall by one
point in overtime, was in the top 10. But it wasn't enough to knock
NBC out of first place, where it has been for 42 straight weeks.
   NBC won the week that ended Sunday with a 15.4 rating. CBS had a
13.0 and ABC 12.5. For the season, NBC has a 16.0 rating, ABC 12.9
and CBS 12.6.
   The week was fairly typical, except that the onset of daylight
saving time seemed to affect the earlier shows since viewers tend
to be less eager to plop in front of the tube when it's still light
outside.
   Therefore, ``The Cosby Show,'' which starts off the night for
NBC on Thursday, found itself in second place behind ABC's
``Roseanne,'' which is broadcast an hour later on Tuesday night,
even though ``Cosby'' had a bigger share of the audience.
   ``Roseanne'' had the highest rating _ 23.3, but a 35 share.
``Cosby'' had a 22.4 rating, but a 38 share. The rating is a
percentage of the nation's 9.4 million homes with television. The
share is a percentage of sets actually in use.
   Daylight saving time also affected the news ratings, all were
down somewhat. ``ABC World News Tonight'' was first with a 10.1
rating and a 20 share, slightly ahead of the ``CBS Evening News''
with a 9.9 and 20 share. ``NBC Nightly News'' had an 8.9 and 18
share.
   The top 10 prime-time shows last week were: ``Roseanne'' ABC,
``The Cosby Show'' NBC, ``Cheers'' NBC, ``A Different World'' NBC,
``60 Minutes'' CBS, ``NCAA Championship _ Michigan vs. Seton Hall''
CBS, ``Golden Girls'' NBC, ``Empty Nest'' NBC, ``L.A. Law'' NBC and
``Murder, She Wrote'' CBS.
   ABC's ``Columbo'' came in 12th for the week, a good showing. The
bad news for ABC is ``Moonlighting,'' which was in the bottom 10.
``Moonlighting'' went on hiatus earlier this year, then moved to
Sunday night where it had a 6.2 and 10 share last week. Only two
other prime-time shows, both on ABC, rank lower: ``HeartBeat'' and
``Men.'' Even Fox had three shows with higher ratings than
``Moonlighting.''
   CBS got a so-so performance out of the premiere of ``The Robert
Guillaume Show'' which finished 46th.
   ABC won the Sunday movie battle with a repeat of ``Romancing the
Stone.'' It was 15th, out-rating NBC's Perry Mason movie, at 18th.
CBS' ``Bridge to Silence,'' starring Marlee Matlin in her first
speaking role, ranked 35th. CBS' Sunday schedule was pushed back
because of an overrun of the Masters golf tournament.
   The lowest-rated shows of the week were: ``Hard Time on Planet
Earth,'' ``Mission Impossible,'' ``Rock 'n' Roll Mom,'' ``Quantum
Leap,'' ``Sesame Street: 20 and Still Counting,'' ``Great Circuses
of the World,'' ``A Man Called Hawk,'' ``Moonlighting,
``HeartBeat'' and ``Men.''

   Tom Bradley was the early leader in his
campaign for a historic fifth term as mayor of the nation's
second-largest city, capturing 54 percent of the absentee vote in a
race characterized by low voter turnout.
   Bradley, 71, the city's first black mayor, needed at least 50
percent of the vote to avoid a June 6 runoff.
   Forty-five minutes after the polls closed at 8 p.m., Bradley was
in the lead with 13,146 absentee ballots, or 54 percent, according
to the City Clerk's Office.
   The next-closest contender was freshman City Councilman Nate
Holden, who received 5,014 absentee votes, or 20.66 percent. Former
Los Angeles County Supervisor and television commentator Baxter
Ward had 4,800 votes, or 19.7 percent.
   Although virtually no observers believed the mayor could lose,
one newspaper reported that a secret poll conducted by Bradley's
campaign last week showed the mayor with just 53 percent of the
vote.
   Bradley pollster Richard Maullin told the Los Angeles Herald
Examiner that the polls conducted April 2 and 3 contained questions
checking the impact of a city attorney's office ethics
investigation of Bradley.
   But, Maullin said, ``None of the results showed Tom Bradley not
winning outright.''
   City Clerk Lee Martinez had predicted a 25 percent to 30 percent
turnout _ ``a historical low for a mayoral election.'' Voters faced
morning low clouds and drizzle, and the turnout by 4 p.m. was only
11.6 percent of the city's 1.9 million registered voters.
   A poll taken recently by The Los Angeles Times showed 78 percent
of Hispanics, 70 percent of whites and 68 percent of blacks had a
favorable impression of the Democratic mayor.
   That led Bradley to be dubbed the ``Teflon mayor,'' because he
is apparently not blamed for the city's mounting urban problems.
   The only currently elected official challenging Bradley,
freshman City Councilman Nate Holden, was considered his only
serious opponent in the non-partisan race, but hardly a threat to
the 16-year mayor.
   Other candidates included a former county supervisor, a
socialist oil field worker and a singer-dancer who used to cavort
in a green bikini across the street from City Hall every day.
   The winner of Tuesday's mayor's race will oversee Los Angeles at
least into the early 1990s, leading a city with a population that
is swelling past 3 million people.

   Pollsters and would-be opponents such as City Councilman Zev
Yaroslavsky agree that Bradley's low-key image has kept him from
being linked in voters' minds with Los Angeles' growing problems,
including criminal gangs, illegal drug trade, traffic congestion
and a failing sewage system.
   Yaroslavsky had widely been considered Bradley's leading
challenger, but backed out of the race after apparently deciding
that he couldn't win.
   Bradley's image even appeared untarnished by an ethics
investigation by the city attorney's office, which learned that the
mayor had performed consulting work with Far East National Bank,
which did business with the city.
   Bradley returned the $18,000 in fees he was paid by the bank and
called the charges politically motivated.
   Bradley, the son of a Texas sharecropper and the grandson of
slaves, was first elected mayor of Los Angeles in 1973.
   A track star at the University of California at Los Angeles, he
first entered public service as a Los Angeles police lieutenant,
and later was elected to the Los Angeles City Council.
   He was defeated in his first run at mayor in a bitter 1969 race
against incumbent Sam Yorty that critics said was tinged with
racism, but came back to beat Yorty the next time around.
   At the end of his current term, Bradley will become the first
mayor in Los Angeles history to have served four full terms.
   He has run twice for governor, but was defeated in 1982 and 1986
by Republican George Deukmejian.

<HEAD>Budget Negotiators Resorting to Gimmicks, Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Budget negotiators from the Bush
administration and Congress are turning to accounting gimmicks and
asset sales for a major portion of their budget package, after
failing to reach agreement on strong deficit-reduction steps.
   The group is struggling to wrap up more than a month of talks
aimed at shaving about $28 billion from the fiscal 1990 deficit.
That would reduce red ink to about $100 billion next year as
mandated by the Gramm-Rudman law, according to White House
estimates.
   Budget experts agree that any long-term solution to the huge
deficit problem requires a meaningful shift in fiscal policy.
Translation: either significant new taxes or reductions in federal
programs or a combination of the two.
   But with President Bush opposing new taxes or cuts in military
spending or foreign aid, and the Democratic-controlled Congress
sure to reject deep cuts in domestic programs, the negotiators are
able to only nibble at the edges of major policy changes this year.
   That scenario has been reinforced directly in recent days as
members of the negotiating team have presented ideas to their
constituencies in the White House or on congressional committees.
In many cases, they've been told to look elsewhere to reduce the
deficit or face rejection, said sources familiar with the
closed-door meetings.
   So in an effort to avert a crisis, such as violating
Gramm-Rudman and triggering its automatic spending cuts, the talks
have turned increasingly toward the smoke and mirrors approach to
budgeting.
   They are considering:
   _Moving payment of some farm subsidies ahead so the checks are
written this fiscal year instead of next, a shift that makes fiscal
1990 look nearly $1 billion trimmer.
   _Taking the U.S. Postal Service ``off-budget,'' knocking nearly
$2 billion in red ink off the books next year.
   _Making an accounting change in the food stamp program to
``save'' another $500 million.
   _Selling off nearly $6 billion in government assets _ a policy
which often brings in money at first but then costs money in the
long run.
   Other items on the list that take advantage of federal
accounting methods include claiming credit for $2 billion trimmed
from the Medicare program by simply extending existing cost
controls, and about $600 million by continuing a retirement policy
for federal employees.
   The group is even prepared to claim $100 million in savings
because Congress earlier this year rejected a pay raise for itself
and other top federal officials, according to one source.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, the chairman of the House Budget Committee,
declined to discuss any specifics, but conceded the negotiators
were struggling.
   ``We've got to reach this goal in a credible way, and it's not
easy,'' he said. ``Under the circumstances we are working with, we
are reaching the best possible solution.''
   But, he added, ``There's no question that this (package) is
going to send a message that more needs to be done.''
   The budget negotiations have dragged on longer than planned, and
Congress will not meet its April 15 deadline for passing a budget
resolution. The budget serves as a blueprint for Congress' annual
spending bills and tax legislation.
   Under the Gramm-Rudman law, if the president and Congress fail
to enact legislation that will reduce the deficit to within $10
billion of next year's $100 billion target, the administration must
make across-the-board spending cuts to make up the difference.

<HEAD>Big Foreign Purchases of Feed Corn Offset Domestic Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign buyers are gobbling up huge amounts of
the U.S. corn supply, but domestic livestock feeders are easing
back on use of the mighty feed grain.
   A new supply-and-demand analysis by the Agriculture Department
showed Tuesday that corn exports may total 2.1 billion bushels in
the marketing year that began last Sept. 1. The new forecast was up
by 100 million bushels from indications a month ago and 21 percent
more than the 1.73 billion shipped in 1987-88.
   Exports at that level would be the highest since corn shipments
totaled 2.4 billion bushels in 1980-81.
   About 4 billion bushels of corn are expected to be used as
livestock feed this year, down from 4.3 billion forecast in March
and well below the record of 4.74 billion bushels consumed a year
earlier.
   According to USDA records, that would put feed use at the lowest
since 3.82 billion bushels were fed to livestock in 1983-84.
   Corn is the largest and most important field crop grown by
American farmers. As livestock feed it helps produce the bulk of
the meat, poultry and dairy products that reach consumers.
   The U.S. stockpile at the beginning of the new corn marketing
year this coming Sept. 1 is forecast at 1.83 billion bushels, up
from the 1.66 billion bushels indicated in March.
   Last Sept. 1, before the drought-shriveled 1988 corn harvest was
added to the supply, the corn carryover was 4.23 billion bushels.
   With a reduced supply, corn prices shot up from an average of
$1.94 per bushel in 1987-88 to a projected range of $2.45 to $2.70
this season.
   The U.S. wheat carryover on June 1, the beginning of the new
wheat marketing year, was indicated at 549 million bushels, up
slightly from 534 million forecast last month but far below the
1.26 billion bushels in the inventory last June 1.
   Wheat exports and domestic use are down, but the main impact has
been the reduced 1988 harvest. Wheat prices are expected to average
$3.65 to $3.80 per bushel this season, up from $2.57 in 1987-88.
   The soybean situation reflects a bare-bones level of supply,
with the carryover on Sept. 1, the beginning of the 1989-90
marketing year, expected to be about 145 million bushels, compared
with 302 million last Sept. 1.
   Drought reduced last year's production, forcing prices higher.
The report forecast soybeans might average $7.20 to $7.60 per
bushel this season, compared with $5.88 in 1987-88. Exports and
domestic use are both down.
   The report also said that total meat production this year is now
expected to be about 0.2 percent less than forecast last month
because of a decline in poultry prospects. Even so, 1989 combine
production of poultry and red meat is expected to reach a record
level.

   The Agriculture Department says a vaccine has
been invented to make pigs piggier.
   Pigs immunized with the experimental vaccine ate an average of
22.5 pounds more feed and gained 11 pounds more weight than pigs
without the treatment, the department's Agricultural Research
Service reported on Tuesday.
   ``If a commercial product results from this venture and is
approved by regulator agencies, it could mean more quality pork
produced at lower cost and in less time,'' said animal physiologist
Jerome C. Pekas.
   The USDA agency has signed a three-year cooperative agreement
with Codon, a San Francisco biotechnology firm, for development and
further testing of the vaccine.
   Pekas, who works at the agency's meat animal research center in
Clay Center, Neb., said the vaccine is made partly from a fragment
of cholecystokinin, a natural appetite-limiting hormone made in the
upper intestinal tract of pigs and humans.
   When the fragment, called CCK-8, is joined to a larger foreign
carrier protein, the animal's immune system recognizes the fragment
as a foreign molecule and produces antibodies that block the
natural CCK hormone, he said.
   When that happens, there is nothing to tell pigs when they've
had enough to eat. So they keep on eating.

   The Agriculture Department says the orange
harvest for the 1988-89 crop season is estimated at about 207.8
million boxes, down 1 percent from the March forecast but 4 percent
above last year's production.
   Florida production, based on April 1 indications, was estimated
at 144.3 million boxes, down 1 percent from last month but 5
percent more than last season, the department's Agricultural
Statistics Board said Tuesday.
   The California harvest was estimated at 60 million boxes, down
almost 2 percent from the March forecast but 2 percent more than
produced in 1987-88. The Arizona crop was indicated at 1.55 million
boxes, down 22 percent from the previous forecast for Arizona in
January _ which had been carried forward into February and March _
and 14 percent less than last season.
   Texas production, at 1.9 million boxes, was unchanged from the
March forecast but was 33 percent above last season's harvest.

<TEXT>
   The new Earl of Lincoln _ a retired
Australian sheep shearer _ received a guided tour of his family
seat in northeast England and called it a nice place.
   Edward Fiennes-Clinton, 75, visiting Lincoln for the first time
Tuesday and Britain for the second time, said he hopes to take
advantage of the only real perk offered by his title _ a seat in
the House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber of Parliament.
   When the Duke of Newcastle, who was also the Earl of Lincoln,
died last Christmas, historians began a frantic search for the new
earl.
   It led to Fiennes-Clinton's shack in Bunbury, Western Australia,
l00 miles south of Perth.
   ``My wife thought it was a joke,'' said Fiennes-Clinton, who
before retiring worked as a sheep shearer, gold miner and milkman.
   ``It hasn't changed my life. My mates take me for what I am. One
said `You're a big man now,' but I haven't grown any taller,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   A new sightseeing business has arrived on the
scene in the nation's capital: guided tours conducted by President
Bush.
   Bush has been taking his guests to see the sights, something
predecessor Ronald Reagan rarely did.
   For Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, it was a trip by
helicopter to nearby Baltimore for a baseball game. There, the two
presidents sat in a box and ate hot dogs and hamburgers and debated
Bush's high-and-outside season-opening pitch.
   For Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, it was a trip past
the Tidal Basin for a glimpse of the city's famed cherry blossoms
and then to the Air and Space Museum, one of Washington's
most-visited attractions.
   The two joined springtime tourists in the museum's wide-screened
theater to watch the movie ``To Fly.'' Excited conversation rippled
through the audience as people realized who was in their midst, and
those who had cameras used them for snapshots.
   Next week, Jordan's King Hussein will be in town. And it's
anyone's guess where the president might take him.
   ``Washington is a city of 1,000 monuments,'' said White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``We may end up visiting them
all.''
   Bush plans to take French President Francois Mitterrand to his
vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, next month.
   And he threw open the doors of the presidential retreat at Camp
David, Md., to House speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.
   Bush set the theme early in his presidency, when he opened the
White House to the public the Saturday after his inauguration. And,
at one reception for members of Congress, Bush used a Polaroid
camera to take instant photos of lawmakers in the Lincoln Bedroom.
   On the way to the Air and Space museum, the Bush-Shamir
motorcade passed a line of life-sized standup photographs that have
proliferated in Washington over the past few years.
   For instance, for a $5 fee you can have your picture taken with
a cutout of President Bush, the first lady or both. In the final
photograph, it looks like you were standing next to the first
family in front of a Washington landmark.
   At the White House, there have been such cutouts for several
years: first the Reagans, and now the Bushes. For a while, a cutout
of Oliver North also appeared, but popular demand trailed off and
it has been removed.
   But outside the Air and Space museum, George and Barbara Bush
now share sidewalk space with other celebrities, including cutouts
of wrestling star Hulk Hogan and actor Tom Selleck, and a new
addition: Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   It would have been hard for Bush to miss the life-sized likeness
of the Soviet leader. Gorbachev was right on the corner, just feet
from the official motorcade.
   But if the president had any reaction, it went unreported.
   The president is often out and about town, frequently taking
guests with him in his limousine.
   And, since he has a habit of stopping at red lights when he's on
a social or recreational call, his motorcade often produces
expressions of surprise and delight from other motorists and
passersby as they realize the man in the stopped car alongside them
is none other than the president.
   Those on the street might have done a double take one day last
week.
   Bush, wearing exercise clothes, took his motorcade to the
Rayburn House Office Building, where he played racquetball in the
House gym.
   Running late for a formal dinner at the White House, Bush
emerged from the gym two hours later wearing a tuxedo.

<HEAD>1988 Set Record For Incidents, State Department Tells Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Terrorism rose to record heights in 1988, as
the United States suffered a substantial increase and Israel
remained the favorite target, the State Department reported to
Congress.
   The bombing of a Pan Am jetliner in December over Scotland,
which the department's office of counter terrorism said probably
was a terrorist incident, and the Palestinian uprising on the West
Bank and in Gaza helped push the total of incidents to a new high
of 856, up 3 percent from 1987.
   In all, 658 people were killed and 1,131 wounded, an increase in
fatalities from 633 in 1987 but a decrease in injuries from 2,272.
   The casualty figures include terrorists themselves who were
killed or wounded during attacks as well as attacks by Afghanistan
against Pakistan, a U.S. ally which funneled American weapons to
Afghan guerrillas.
   In all, the citizens and property of 79 nations were attacked in
60 countries. Businessmen and tourists accounted for 77 percent of
the victims. The weapon used most often by terrorists was the bomb.
It was used in 48 percent of the attacks, said the report released
Tuesday.
   The Army's top uniformed lawyer contends that the U.S. military
can legally attack terrorists without violating a 1976 presidential
order that bans assassinations of individuals abroad,
   Maj. Gen. Hugh Overholt, the service's judge advocate general,
argued in an eight-page draft memorandum that because of changes in
``the nature of the threat,'' action against terrorists can be
justified on grounds of national self-defense.
   Overholt's memorandum was disclosed Monday by the newsletter
Defense Week and confirmed by Army officials.
   The State Department report said the United States remained a
primary target for international terrorism last year, as the number
of anti-U.S. incidents rose from 149 in 1987 to 185. They resulted
in 192 persons killed and 40 wounded, compared with seven Americans
killed and 47 wounded in 1987.
   The increase in deaths was due largely to the attack on
U.S.-bound Pan Am 103 in which 259 people aboard the jumbo jet and
11 on the ground perished. Of the victims 189 were Americans.
   Latin America was the area showing the largest percentage of
incidents against U.S. citizens and property _ 60 percent.
   On the whole, the Middle East again had the highest incidence of
international terrorism, with 313 attacks. Israel, including the
West Bank and Gaza, again was the main target, accounting for 29
percent of the attacks.
   The State Department credited Syria and Iraq with a substantial
reduction in direct involvement in terrorism last year, but said
both countries continued to provide safe haven and training to
terrorist organizations.
   Iran's decision to end its war with Iraq and expand ties to the
West lessened Iranian involvement in terrorism, but Iran continued
to include terrorism among its foreign-policy tools, the report
said.
   At year's end, 20 foreigners were listed as political hostages
being held in Lebanon, two others possibly were dead, while 13 were
released during the year.
   Ranked behind Israel, in order, as sites for the most terrorist
incidents were Pakistan, Colombia, Spain, Lebanon, West Germany,
Zimbabwe, South Korea, Peru and France.
   The 10 countries accounted for 75 percent of the incidents
during the year, the report said.
   The Palestinian uprising, which began in December 1987 and
continued through last year in the Israeli-held West Bank and Gaza
Strip, should be viewed overall as a ``civil insurrection,'' the
State Department said.
   But the report said since it contained ``elements of terrorism''
in some instances, all civilian casualties were included in the
1988 statistics.

   Public housing officials say HUD Secretary
Jack Kemp's anti-drug proposals may help in some housing projects
but what they really need is more federal money to beef up security
and help tenants find jobs.
   ``He's not suggesting anything that has not been thought of in
the past _ they just haven't had the resources,'' said Richard
Nelson, executive director of the National Association of Housing
and Redevelopment Officials.
   ``We've got a lot of hand-wringing going on but no help,'' said
Gordon Cavanaugh, counsel for the Council of Large Public Housing
Authorities. ``I haven't seen any money yet.''
   The secretary of Housing and Urban Development proposed this
week a series of steps for fighting drugs in federally supported
housing projects in Washington. He said they ``are applicable to
every public housing authority in the United States'' and will be
issued in ``action memos'' to all locally run public housing
authorities.
   Kemp's package includes only one direct HUD action: dropping
government hearing procedures that may delay eviction of tenants
who use or sell drugs, so long as the tenants receive due process
in the courts.
   His other proposals were suggestions, including more police
patrols, installing security fences around projects, establishing
guarded entrances, renovating the projects and requiring photo
identification cards for residents.
   He provided no cost estimate but said he would go to Congress to
ask for more money if needed.
   District of Columbia officials on Tuesday formally asked HUD to
drop its requirement for hearings before evicting tenants for drug
use or firearm violations.
   But some housing officials said the move might not be possible
in some states, and that it might not speed up the eviction process
very much in others.
   In Baltimore, housing authority spokesman Bill Toohey said, the
hearing process works well and keeps most cases from ever going to
court. ``We are not about to change our ... grievance procedures,''
he said.
   Cavanaugh said many of the nation's 3,000 public housing
authorities might want to drop the hearing procedures, but that the
more serious delays in evictions are in the court system and would
not be changed.
   Jane Lang of the Housing and Development Law Institute said laws
in some states do not appear to provide enough protection for
tenants in eviction cases to meet HUD guidelines for waiving the
formal hearing procedures.
   The proposal to fence in housing projects will be controversial
and likely will be rejected in most cases, according to Nelson,
whose organization represents 90 percent of the local public
housing agencies that operate federally subsidized housing.
   He said a main concern of public housing agencies is making
projects blend in with the surrounding neighborhoods, and fencing
would only make them stand out and be even more attractive to drug
activity by outsiders.
   Kemp acknowledged on Monday that fences may not work in all
cases and said they should be considered on a case-by-case basis.
   ``A security fence may be different from barbed wire,'' Kemp
said. ``We're not trying to keep people in. We're trying to get
drug users from getting in.''
   In New York City, housing authorities have no plans to require
residents to have photo identification cards or to surround
projects with fences, said Val Coleman, spokesman for the city
housing authority. He called the steps ``draconian.''
   ``We're not that demoralized,'' Coleman said.
   Coleman said New York's need is for more money _ to increase its
public housing authority police force and to provide job training
for tenants.
   But some other cities, including Washington, have already begun
issuing photo identification cards in certain cases, such as for
tenants of high-rise and senior-citizen projects.
   Mayor Arthur Holland of Trenton, N.J., president of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors, praised Kemp's enthusiasm and said most of
his suggestions could be useful. But he cautioned that increasing
security in projects may only move drug problems into surrounding
areas unless broader programs are provided to poor urban residents.

<HEAD>Interior Renewing California Water Leases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department, although conceding
possible environmental problems, is renewing long-term water leases
to farmers in central California in an attempt to put to rest an
emotional fight over federal water in the West.
   The controversy over water distribution to central California
farmers has been marked by disagreement within the administration
for months. Environmentalists have characterized the outcome as
another barometer on the Bush administration's desire to protect
the environment and natural resources.
   The Interior Department, which issues the leases, has favored
automatic renewal, while the Environmental Protection Agency has
argued that a formal environmental assessment should first be made.
The president's Council on Environmental Quality is planning to
review the matter Thursday.
   But Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., announced Tuesday that
he has decided to renew the first lease to come before the
department, committing federal water to the Orange Cove Irrigation
District in the San Joaquin Valley for another 40 years.
   Lujan said the decision would not affect the White House
council's proceedings. The council has no authority to block the
leases or order a formal environmental impact statement, although
its views historically have been given considerable weight by
agencies and Congress.
   ``This decision further corrodes the environmental credentials
of the Bush administration,'' said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.,
chairman of the Interior subcommittee on water, power and offshore
energy resources.
   While the lease renewal announced Tuesday involves only one of a
number of central California irrigation projects, it was viewed
widely as an indication of how the Interior Department likely will
deal with future renewal cases as other long-term leases expire.
   Environmentalists have opposed renewal of the long-term leases
because the commitment locks the government into supplying a
certain volume of water to farmers well into the next century at a
time when rapid population growth is creating new, non-farm water
demands.
   As water continues to be diverted for both agriculture and urban
use, streams will dry up and seasonal wetlands, which support
migratory waterfowl, will disappear, the critics maintain.
   The leases provide for water delivered through the Friant Unit
of the Central Valley Project, a massive central California
irrigation system, that each year provides 1.5 billion acre feet of
federal water to central California farms and orchards through an
elaborate system of dams and canals.
   Lujan in a statement conceded that the long-term leases ``may
pose legitimate environmental concerns.'' But he said those
concerns could be resolved by state and local officials.
   He directed the chief of the Bureau of Reclamation to conduct an
environmental assessment and provide it to those officials for
consideration so the state and local officials may then ``adopt
environmentally sensitive operating procedures and water policies.''
   But Richard Sanderson, director of the office of federal
activities at the EPA, suggested Lujan's procedures for dealing
with environmental concerns amount to ``sidestepping'' the National
Environmental Policy Act under which environmentalists had sought
to get a formal environmental impact statement, or EIS, before any
leases were renewed.
   The environmental review directed by Lujan ``is essentially
different than doing an EIS,'' said Sanderson in an interview.
   ``Our position (at EPA) is the entire water issue for California
needs to be reviewed in light of today's environmental standards
and particularly the environmental requirements 40 years hence,''
Sanderson added.
   Randall Block, an attorney who represents several environmental
groups including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the
Sierra Club in challenging the lease renewals in a lawsuit filed in
California, accused Lujan of ``undermining the procedures''
established to deal with the environmental concerns.
   ``It's kind of backward to sign the leases and then order and
environmental assessment,'' Block said.
   Lujan suggested that the issuance of the one lease renewal would
not affect the White House environmental council's review of the
broader environmental issues involving all of the upcoming leases.
   He also said the Orange Cove lease would encourage increased
water conservation among the farmers by charging ``substantially
higher prices'' for the water. Under the new contract with Orange
Cove, the cost of federal water would quadruple from $3.50 to
$14.94 per acre foot, he said.
   An acre foot is an amount of water need to flood an acre of land
one foot deep, or about 350,000 gallons.

<HEAD>New Regulations Possible for Aging Airliners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is moving
to impose new maintenance standards on older airliners, but
industry officials say the agency needs to do a more thorough job
of inspecting the aircraft.
   The Senate aviation subcommittee examined the problem of aging
airliners at a hearing on Tuesday, a session that also produced a
warning from the panel's chairman that tougher government
regulations might be on the way.
   The chairman, Wendell Ford, D-Ky., told reporters after the
session that Congress should consider requiring the FAA to force an
increase in the frequency of inspections of older aircraft, require
replacing certain parts rather than examinations of them, and set
training and experience standards for airline inspectors and
mechanics.
   Ever since the roof of a 19-year-old Aloha Airlines Boeing 737
peeled off over Hawaii last April, sweeping a flight attendant to
her death, attention has been focused on the older aircraft.
   The FAA and the nation's major airlines agreed in February to
more than $800 million worth of improvements to be made on 1,300
older Boeing jetliners. The goal is to eliminate certain routine
inspections in favor of design improvements and a schedule for
regular replacements of certain parts.
   On Tuesday, Anthony J. Broderick, the FAA's associate
administrator for regulation, said that late this month or in early
May, the agency will propose rules that would require more than 160
structural changes in Boeing 727s, 737s and 747s.
   The last year has been a difficult one for the older members of
the U.S. airline fleet. Nine people died in December when a
19-year-old United Airlines Boeing 747 broke open over Hawaii; a
22-year-old Eastern Airlines Boeing 727 landed without casualties
after a hole opened in its fuselage while flying over West
Virginia; and an 8-year-old Piedmont Airlines 727 lost an engine
during takeoff from Chicago.
   The average age of airliners used by U.S. carriers is 12.7
years, up from 8 years in 1980. It is expected to be 15 years by
the year 2000, because there are backlogs of orders for new
aircraft and an ever-growing passenger load.
   At the hearing, officials from the FAA, the airlines and the
aircraft manufacturing industry assured lawmakers that improvements
were being made constantly in how aircraft are constructed,
maintained, tested and inspected.
   But Benjamin A. Cosgrove, a vice president for engineering for
Boeing Commercial Airplanes, a Boeing subsidiary, said FAA
inspectors should spend more time examining airlines and less time
checking paperwork, and complained that FAA fines for maintenance
infractions can be counterproductive.
   ``Routine use of such penalties tends to drive problems
underground and communication in the industry suffers,'' Cosgrove
said.
   Clyde Kizer, engineering vice president for the Air Transport
Association, which represents the major airlines, said the group is
considering whether inspectors and mechanics for all carriers
should be required to meet uniform training standards.
   This angered Ford, who asked: ``Why should there be any question
but that you should go ahead with strict training and education
across-the-board?''

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
and New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean set partisan matters aside and took
the stage at a charity cabaret for the theater run by Dukakis'
Oscar-winning cousin, Olympia.
   The actress introduced the governors as ``two kids with a lot of
talent, a lot of heart, on the brink of stardom _ one had a
national tour last year.''
   Her cousin, the 1988 Democratic presidential candidate, wailed
``Happy Days are Here Again'' on the trumpet and launched into
``Michael Rowed the Boat Ashore'' with jokes about the Boston
Harbor campaign issue and the Alaskan oil spill.
   Republican Kean, who will be president of Drew University after
he leaves office, read a parody of Rudyard Kipling's ``If''
twitting both lame duck governors about prison furloughs and
vanishing budget surpluses.
   ``Remember the greatest award lies ahead
   ``when at last you announce the end of your public days
   ``and watch some other joker go through it instead,'' he said.
   ``Superman'' Christopher Reeve dropped in to proclaim himself
``a Jersey boy,'' songwriter Jimmy Webb sang his ``Wichita
Lineman'' and actress Blythe Danner sang ``Peel Me a Grape.''
   About 450 people paid $150 to $500 to attend Sunday night's
benefit, which raised $65,000 for Miss Dukakis' Whole Theater in
Montclair.

   Singer Grace Jones was freed on bail
after her lawyer argued she wanted to stand trial on a charge of
cocaine possession to clear her name.
   A magistrate on Tuesday freed Ms. Jones on $2,700 bail on
condition she returns for trial June 6. She wasn't asked to enter a
plea.
   Spectators packed the small courtroom. A crowd of about 200
gathered outside, and some shouted support as she left.
   Authorities opposed bail at the hearing, saying the singer would
not be inclined to return for trial because of her business
obligations.
   But defense attorney Tom Tavares-Finson said Ms. Jones wanted to
be cleared of the charge because of her recording and advertising
contracts. He told the court the entertainer is not a drug user and
is involved in the campaign against drug abuse.
   Ms. Jones was arrested Saturday after police found 0.006 ounce
of cocaine in her purse during a raid at the Music Mountain
Recording Studio, which doubles as the home of her husband, record
producer Chris Stanley.

   Arthur Watson, who oversaw NBC's coverage of the
Summer Olympics, is stepping down as the network's sports president
after 10 years.
   Watson will be replaced on May 1 by Dick Ebersol, a creator of
``Saturday Night Live'' and now executive producer of ``Later with
Bob Costas.''
   Watson, 54, will become executive vice president with
responsibility for major sports negotiations until his planned
retirement next year.
   NBC's Olympic telecasts from Seoul received lower-than-projected
ratings, and its aggressive news coverage of the event alienated
some Korean and U.S. viewers. But NBC swept the prime-time ratings
and made an estimated profit of $80 million.
   Watson's move was announced one day after NBC won 12 Sports Emmy
Awards, more than any other network.
   Ebersol, 41, is married to actress Susan Saint James.

<HEAD>Committee Clears Bill Restoring Fairness Doctrine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A House committee's vote to impose a new
fairness doctrine on broadcasters sets the stage for a
confrontation with the White House and a probable Supreme Court
challenge.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee issued the challenge
Tuesday when on a voice vote it approved a fairness doctrine bill
introduced by committee chairman Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
   The bill goes to the full House, where it is expected to pass
easily.
   The Justice Department has told Dingell that it will urge
President Bush to veto any fairness doctrine law that passes
Congress.
   President Reagan vetoed an identical bill in 1987, the same year
the Federal Communications Commission repealed its doctrine on the
grounds it violated the First Amendment and no longer served the
public interest in an era of diverse media outlets.
   The 50-year-old rules required broadcasters to air opposing
views of controversial issues.
   If the bill should pass both houses of Congress and become law,
a Supreme Court test also would seem likely because of what
opponents say is the doctrine's unconstitutional infringement on
broadcasters' rights.
   A federal appeals court earlier this year ruled that the FCC had
the authority to scrap the doctrine, but the court sidestepped the
issue of the doctrine's constitutionality.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, said the fairness
doctrine is not a great burden on broadcasters and only assures
``more speech'' on public issues.
   The bill would not impose criminal sanctions on broadcasters who
violate the doctrine, Markey said, adding that a station never has
lost its license for fairness doctrine infractions.
   The committee's ranking Republican, Rep. Norman Lent of New
York, said the bill is designed to provide ``a minimal assurance of
fair play.''
   Opponents included Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, who said, ``This is a
clear violation of the First Amendment.'' He also disputed the view
that broadcasters must be required to be fair because they are
licensed to exploit a ``scarce'' medium _ the airwaves.
   ``Our founding fathers had the question before them: `Do we want
a fair press or do we want a free press?' And they made the choice
that we ought to have a free press,'' Tauke said.
   ``There were at that time very few media outlets in the
nation,'' he said. ``And of course then as today it was abundantly
clear that some of those media outlets sometimes engaged in
activities which were perceived, may actually have been, unfair.
But the founding fathers said there was a greater risk in
attempting to control the media by imposing fairness than there is
in permitting a free media to perhaps occasionally be unfair.''
   The fairness doctrine has been opposed by many broadcasters,
particularly smaller station owners who say the threat of lawsuits
is enough to make them just play music instead of discussing
controversial issues.

   A spectacular five-alarm fire Tuesday
destroyed a roofing materials warehouse, forced the evacuation of
nearby buildings and injured two warehouse workers slightly,
firefighters said.
   The blaze sent a towering column of smoke over the suburban area
between Seattle and Tacoma, knocked out electricity to downtown
Auburn and snarled traffic as stoplights went dark and motorists
slowed for a glimpse of the flames.
   Four other buildings in an area of more than 100,000 square feet
also were engulfed in flames.
   An undetermined number of people were evacuated from four nearby
businesses, and firefighters hosed down a house across the street
that was threatened by the flames.
   No firefighters were hurt, although shifting winds blew sparks
and flaming tarpaper around the Leatherback Industries Inc.
warehouse.
   Mike DeHart of the Kent Fire Department said the smoke could
pose a threat to area residents with respiratory problems. Most of
the smoke was blown to the south, but some stayed in the area.
   The fire apparently started around 2:30 p.m. near an electrical
panel, but the cause remained undetermined, authorities said.
Damage initially was estimated at about $1 million.
   Fire officials estimated it would take the 75 firefighters from
five jurisdictions at least 12 hours to extinguish.
   The building contained large amounts of felt paper and tar to
make tarpaper for roofing, said an Auburn Fire Department spokesman
who refused to give his name.
   ``It's hot and it's nasty,'' he said.
   Asphalt stored at 300 to 400 degrees in the warehouse had only
to get a bit too hot to burst into flames, he said.
   Two Leatherback workers were treated for minor burns after
trying to extinguish the fire earlier in the day, officials said.
   The blaze spread despite a sprinkler system, and the two workers
and nine other employees fled, workers said.
   Several tanks of industrial chemicals exploded. Firefighters
tried to prevent flames from reaching a 61,000-gallon tank of
liquid asphalt and a large propane tank.

<HEAD>Study Says Rural and Inner-City Poverty Rates are Similar</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Country people were just as poor during the
economic recovery as they were during the last decade's recession,
according to a study that found little difference between urban and
rural poverty.
   The study, Poverty in Rural America: A National Overview, said
more than one in six people in rural America fell below the federal
poverty line of $9,056 for a family of three in 1987 while the rate
was one in eight for residents of metropolitan areas during that
year.
   ``In fact, the rural poverty rate for 1987 _ the fifth year of
an economic recovery _ was as high as the rate for 1975, the
deepest recession year of the 1970s,'' said Robert Greenstein,
director of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, while
presenting the study Tuesday to a hearing of the House Select
Committee on Children, Youth and Families.
   Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau on poverty from 1978 to
1987, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities found that the
rural poverty rate rose from 13.5 percent to 16.9 percent.
   In metropolitan areas during the same period, the rate rose from
10.4 percent to 12.5 percent. Metropolitan areas comprise one or
more cities and their suburbs.
   In the central cities, which frequently are associated with
poverty, the rate climbed from 15.4 percent to 18.6 percent,
according to the study.
   ``What's most striking is that the rate of poverty in rural
areas is almost as high as in central cities,'' Greenstein said
Tuesday in an interview.
   The center, a nonprofit organization which conducts research and
analysis on a range of public policy issues concerning low-income
families and individuals, found the changes in poverty consistent
among most racial, ethnic, age and demographic groups.
   The rural poor are more likely to be white because there is a
lower proportion of minorities in nonmetropolitan areas, but ``more
than two-fifths (44.1 percent) of nonmetro blacks were poor in
1987, compared to one-third (33.3 percent) of blacks living in
central cities.''
   There also were more poor elderly people living in rural than
urban areas, the study said.
   The only segment of the rural poor that was smaller than its
urban counterpart was children. According to the study, 23.1
percent of rural children were poor while 29.6 percent of the
children in the central cities were poor in 1987.
   But one feature that distinguished the rural poor from their
urban counterparts is that rural poverty is likely to occur in
two-parent families where one or both parents work.
   ``Nearly two of every three poor families living in rural areas
contained at least one worker in 1987,'' the study said. ``Nearly
one quarter had at least two workers.''

   It's a chocoholic's dream come true _ a

``So I can relate to what Nancy's feeling. I know when to say

   Witchcraft is not uncommon in Mexico, where

12 people in the northern border city of Matamoros.
   The bodies, including that of a 21-year-old University of Texas
student, were discovered in a mass grave Tuesday on a ranch just
south of the U.S.-Mexico border.
   Police said a satanic cult of drug smugglers killed them in
hopes that human sacrifice would protect them.
   ``This is the most horrible thing ever seen in the city's
history,'' said Enriqueta Hernandez, a reporter covering the story
for the Matamoros daily El Bravo. ``This is more like something you
would hear about in Veracruz or Oaxaca.''
   The southern states of Veracruz and Oaxaca are known for their
large numbers of ``brujos'', or witches, and their occult rites.
   But even in those areas, the rites are not considered
``satanic'' because they have no connection with the Christian
devil. The witches may sacrifice animals such as black-feathered
roosters, but ritual killings of human beings are almost unheard of.
   American anthropologists William and Claudia Medsen
differentiate between Mexico's traditional Indian witches and what
they call ``satanic witches'' in their 1969 book ``The American
Guide to Mexican Witchcraft.''
   ``The satanic witchcraft practiced in cities and towns is a far
cry from Indian witchcraft, although this distinction has been
ignored by anthropologists,'' they wrote. ``Indian witchcraft has
little or no connection with the Christian devil, who dominates the
suburban sorcery scene.
   ``The most feared witches in urban Mexico are those who make
pacts with the devil. A satanic witch voluntarily sells his soul to
the devil in exchange for wealth and power,'' the book says.
   An anthropologist at the National Anthropology and History
Institute said satanic cults are rare in Mexico because they are
elitist and expensive, in part because of drugs used in the
ceremonies.
   ``From colonial times, it never was successful'' in Mexico, said
the anthropologist, who asked that her name not be used.
   On the other hand, herbal medicine and use of witch doctors,
called ``curanderos,'' is common in Mexico. Most markets have
stalls where herbs are sold for cures, to cast or remove good or
bad spells or to cleanse a home of evil.
   Human sacrifice was common in the country's pre-Columbian Indian
cultures; the Aztecs killed thousands every year, usually captured
enemy soldiers, and practiced cannibalism.
   Human sacrifice is little known now, although not unheard of. It
is said to be used occasionally in rituals in which one person is
killed as part of the process of curing another.
   Tomas Rojas, a police reporter for the Mexico City tabloid La
Prensa, said one of the few cases he had heard of involved the
slaying of an unidentifed man whose headless body was discovered
about three months ago next to a hill in the northern part of the
city.
   Rojas said officials found the body near a circle of stones
enclosing a triangle. The head was found on the other side of the
hill.

   Fire swept through an apartment house early
Tuesday, killing seven children and two young mothers, and police
later arrested a homeless man but did not link him to the blaze.
   The three other occupants of the building were injured, two of
them seriously.
   Fire Chief G. John Parker said the cause remained under
investigation and authorities were focusing on a gas heater near
where the fire started. Parker said that based on an initial
investigation, authorities did not suspect arson.
   The blaze started about 2 a.m. on the first floor and had
engulfed the two-story, wood-frame structure by the time
firefighters responded.
   ``The fire was just blazing all of a sudden. ... I can't
remember hearing (noise) or anything,'' said Rhonda Tracy, a
relative of several of the victims who lived across the street and
was first to call the fire department, at 2:20 a.m.
   ``I had never seen people come out burned like that,'' she
continued. ``I was just hysterical.''
   Police and fire authorities, aided by arson investigators from
the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, were examining
the rubble in a working-class neighborhood in this central Illinois
city of about 130,000.
   Smoke detectors were found upstairs and down, Parker said, but
the downstairs detector was connected directly to the building's
wiring and electricity service had been cut April 4 by Central
Illinois Light Co. He was uncertain about the upstairs detector.
   Parker said the fire originated in a room off the foyer near the
entrance of the building. He said a folding bed was in the room,
but it was not being used at the time of the fire.
   Three families, consisting of four adults and eight children,
lived in the house, and had moved there last year, officials said.
   Police Capt. Mary Dunlavy said Carl Wells, who was treated at
St. Frances Medical Center and released, was the only survivor to
have been interviewed.
   ``He woke up, went down the stairs and it was hot and he had to
go, of course, back upstairs and try to wake the others,'' she
said. ``And then he went out the window onto the roof and was
rescued by the fire department with a ladder.''
   Later Tuesday, police arrested Joe Pickens, 34, and charged him
with criminal trespass for living in the first floor of the
building without permission, Parker said. An apartment on the first
floor was vacant.
   ``He's somewhat of a homeless person,'' the fire chief said.
``He stayed there sometimes.''
   Pickens was at the building Monday night, and left at 11:30
p.m., said Parker. Pickens was being held at the Peoria County Jail.
   Parker said rescuers found ``people standing on the porch and
some people on the roof. There were people already injured when we
got there.
   ``As soon as we knocked the fire down, it would come back up
again. This happened two or three times,'' he said.
   Several neighbors said they watched helplessly as the fire swept
the house.
   ``The kid was up there waving her hands like she was yelling for
help and the flames were all around her,'' said Charles Harris, 34,
who was visiting his sister in the apartment building next door.
   Three people died at the scene and six were pronounced dead at
two hospitals, said Peoria County Coroner Herbert Buzbee. The
children ranged in age from 2 months to 10 years, he said.
   ``As far as we know this is the worst fire we've ever had in
Peoria in terms of deaths,'' the coroner said.
   Assistant Fire Chief Sam Sisk said he believed the cause of
death was smoke inhalation.
   Joyce Barnes, 30, and Eric Davis, 14, were in serious condition
at Franciscan Medical Center in Rock Island, said spokeswoman Neva
Aldene.
   The coroner identified the dead as Wanda Hobbs, 20, and her
children, Ashly Hobbs, 1, and Felicia Hobbs, 3; Terry Davis, 27,
and her children, Carlyssa Davis, 2, Arnisha Davis, 7, and Tenora
Davis, 10.
   Also pronounced dead were Jacolby Thomas, the 2{-year-old
daughter of Ms. Barnes; and Eugene Roberts Jr., 2 months, believed
to be the son of either Ms. Hobbs or Ms. Davis, Buzbee said.

   The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival's
jazzy 1989 poster can't get enough of Fats Domino.
   A smiling Domino is shown in four identical 1960s portraits
tinted in four colors.
   ``That's just fine,'' the 62-year-old New Orleans native said of
the 20th anniversary poster. ``It represents when I was young and I
like that about it.''
   The poster, unveiled Tuesday, was done by New Orleans artist
Richard Thomas.
   ``They told me they either wanted Louis Armstrong or Fats Domino
and I said `Let's do Fats,''' Thomas said. ``I love them both, but
people always kid me about how much I look like Fats.''
   Domino, who said he works five to six months a year now, will
play May 7 at this year's jazzfest.
   ``All I need is a good piano and a good mike and I'm happy,''
the singer said.

   A British Airways Concorde jet on a
world-circling journey lost a piece of its tail in flight but
landed safely at Sydney international airport on Wednesday.
   There were no reports of injuries.
   The Concorde, making the first all-supersonic flight around the
world, was trying to set more than one dozen speed records as it
circles the globe and had been scheduled to land in Sydney,
organizers said.
   ``About 25 minutes after takeoff from New Zealand there was a
large thump,'' passenger Sheila Cole Nilva, a freelance journalist,
said in a telephone interview.
   ``Everybody looked at everybody else and lunch was served. The
stewardesses looked terrified,'' she said. ``The pilot came on and
said there was nothing to worry about and that there was a piece
loose on the airplane.''
   Australian Associated Press, quoting Australian Civil Aviation
Authority spokesman John Death, said it appeared that part of the
stabilizer at the back of the plane was missing when it landed at
12:42 p.m. (10:42 p.m. EDT Tuesday) on the flight from
Christchurch, New Zealand.
   The airport control tower was warned by the pilot there was a
problem with the plane and all emergency vehicles were placed on
standby, the radio network said.
   The three-week trip, covering 38,343 miles, involves 35 hours of
flight. It started April 1 in London and was to end there April 23.
   The 100-seat plane was filled to capacity with American
passengers who each paid $39,000 for the flight.

   Sue Kocol's first try at videotaping turned out
to be once-in-a-lifetime event.
   Peering through the viewfinder of a borrowed camera, she
recorded the dramatic crash of a helicopter that was removing
equipment from the top of her 25-story condominium building.
   ``It was a peculiar thing,'' Mrs. Kocol said. ``I do recall that
as long as you're behind the camera, you think maybe it's not real
... maybe it (the helicopter) will straighten out.''
   But the craft that had begun to tilt and spin out of control
first sent its load crashing to the ground and then plunged down
itself.
   It crashed next to the U.S. Coast Guard station at the Lake
Michigan shore, but pilot Ben Moore, the only person in the
helicopter, escaped serious injury.
   Moore, 43, of Elmhurst, Ill., was treated for cuts to the legs
and face at Milwaukee County Medical Center, said hospital
spokeswoman Pam Hansen.
   ``We've been very lucky here,'' Mrs. Kocol said. ``At the moment
it looked like it was going to be very tragic.''
   Mrs. Kocol's videotape and another taken from the roof by the
building's maintenance man, Peter Bakke, appeared on local and
network newscasts Tuesday evening.
   Richard L. Porter, Milwaukee district manager for the Federal
Aviation Administration, attributed the crash to the failure of a
coupling between a transmission drive shaft and the tail rotor. As
a result, he said, the rotor stopped and the helicopter started
spinning clockwise, out of control, finally diving to the bank of
ground next to an old submarine slip.
   The helicopter was a Sikorsky S-58T owned by Midwest Helicopter
Airways Inc. of Hinsdale, Ill.
   Mrs. Kocol's son, Stan, is a helicopter pilot with the Air
National Guard in Salina, Kan., but Mrs. Kocol said:
   ``I really know nothing about flying and I really know nothing
about cameras.''
   She had never used a video camera before but borrowed one from
another son, David, Monday night to videotape the helicopter at
work.
   She and her husband, Raymond, watched from a small park as the
helicopter arrived and began removing air conditioning equipment
from the roof.
   As the helicopter carried the largest piece, believed to weigh
about 2 tons, the rotor snapped, Mrs. Kocol said. On the
videotape's soundtrack, ``you hear kind of a grinding noise a
little bit before he lets go of the piece,'' she said.
   Fellow workers said the pilot signaled with his arm to those on
the ground before letting go of the load.
   ``Everyone was stunned,'' she said. ``People were crying and
very upset.''
   She said the scene was too much for her granddaughter, Christina
Kocol, who witnessed the accident on her second birthday.
   The accident left the girl very upset, said Mrs. Kocol, and she
took the child inside.
   That's when she determined her camera work had captured the
accident almost in its entirety.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer for House Speaker Jim Wright has been
pleading Wright's case before dozens of his Democratic colleagues _
and even some lobbyists _ in sessions that critics say are flagrant
violations of House secrecy rules.
   The attorney, William Oldaker, has been representing Wright
throughout the House ethics committee's 10-month investigation of
the speaker's financial dealings. He was permitted to attend three
weeks of closed-door meetings beginning in late February at which
the panel's outside counsel, Richard Phelan, detailed the findings
of his $1 million investigation.
   Following those sessions, Oldaker prepared a thick briefing book
which he has used as the basis for meetings with House Democrats
and a selected handful of Democratic lobbyists and political
activists to present the speaker's defense arguments.
   The document is sprinkled throughout with allusions to Phelan's
arguments and in some places includes direct quotes taken from
secret depositions given before the committee. For example, it
disputes Phelan's contention that Wright marketed his book,
``Reflections of a Public Man,'' but notes the speaker had made it
clear to staff members ``that I would like for all the books to be
sold that could be sold.''
   ``My reaction is sort of beyond rage, into amazement,'' said
Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the speaker's chief accuser and newly
elected No. 2 GOP leadership official in the House.
   Gingrich said he was told at the time that the panel was taking
the unusual step of allowing Oldaker to sit in on its private
deliberations because it was useful for members to hear ``the
initial line of reasoning'' from the speaker's attorney.
   But he said the process is clearly confidential under House
rules, and for Oldaker later to brief Democrats, including outside
lobbyists, on the case is ``an act so stupid, so fundamentally
undermining the ethics process that ... I find it hard to believe
he is doing that,'' Gingrich said.
   Gingrich said two GOP members of the ethics committee were
``stunned'' to hear of Oldaker's activities and promised to look
into the matter. The issue also came up at a Republican leadership
meeting Tuesday which was attended by GOP political operative Ed
Rollins, who has vowed to make Wright and his ethics problems his
top political target in the 1990 elections.
   A spokesman for Wright said Tuesday that ``fewer than 100''
lawmakers had attended the Oldaker briefings and maintained they
were proper because they stick to facts and do not involve
privileged information.
   ``Mr. Gingrich has spent an entire year trying to impugn the
integrity of the speaker of the House,'' the spokesman, Mark
Johnson, said in a statement. ``He distorts the facts of this case
on a daily basis. ... He is the one violating due process.''
   The inch-thick briefing book prepared by Oldaker contains
numerous allusions to Phelan's arguments in the closed-door
meetings:
   _That Wright actively marketed his book and conceded in secret
testimony, ``I am sure that all the members of the staff would have
concluded rightfully that I would like for all the books to be sold
that could be sold.''
   _That 76 individuals or organizations bought bulk quantities of
the book, that testimony was received from 19 of them and that of
those, 11 had hosted speeches by Wright. That raised the question
of whether Wright was selling books in lieu of accepting speaking
fees. Book income is not limited by the rules, but speaking fees
are.
   _That an investment company, Mallightco, was a ``sham'' to
funnel money from Forth Worth developer George A. Mallick to the
Wrights, and that Wright's wife, Betty, did little work in return
for her $18,000-a-year salary.
   _That because of Mallick's oil and gas and real estate holdings,
he had a ``direct interest in legislation'' before Congress,
meaning any benefits worth more than $100 received by Wright as
gifts from Mallick would be improper.
   Committee chairman Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., declined to
criticize Oldaker, saying only that ``he has to represent his
client in the way he sees fit'' and that he did not know the
content of the briefings.
   But the panel's senior Republican, Rep. John T. Myers of
Indiana, said he had some concerns.
   ``We extended the courtesy of our committee, which is not
required by the rules,'' to Oldaker, Myers said. ``When he
discusses what took place there, he's in violation of House rules.
... I guess I'm just giving a warning.''
   The two most serious remaining issues before the committee,
according to sources familiar with the inquiry, are whether Wright
used bulk sales of his book to evade limits on outside income from
speaking fees, and whether Mallick had an interest in legislation
before Congress when he paid benefits to the Wrights.
   The panel already has concluded that there is reason to believe
those benefits _ Mrs. Wright's salary, use of a condominium and use
of a Cadillac _ amount to ``gifts'' that Wright should have
reported, but did not, according to sources.

   The U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo Wednesday, while stocks gained marginally.
   The dollar closed at 132.85 yen, up 0.23 yen from Tuesday's
closing. It opened at 132.68 yen and ranged from 132.60 yen to
132.88 yen during the day.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained 250.56 points on Tuesday, edged up
another 6.87 points, or 0.02 percent, to finish at 33,256.45.
   ``The index rose since participants were somewhat reassured
because Prime Minister (Noboru) Takeshita said nothing shocking
yesterday, but still they are reluctant to purchase actively,''
said Manji Ueda with Nomura Securities in Tokyo.
   On Tuesday, Takeshita said before parliament that he had
received about $1 million in donations from Recruit Co., the firm
at the center of a major stock-profiteering and bribery scandal.
   But he denied taking bribes and continued to reject oposition
calls for his resignation.
   Opposition leaders criticized Takeshita, saying the prime
minister had proved nothing, but investors were more or less
reassured as he said nothing that might cause a drastic change in
Japanese politics, dealers said.
   ``Some feeling of political uncertainty lingering in the market
made trading directionless,'' Ueda said.
   In currency dealings, traders said the dollar-yen rate moved
little as market players stepped to the sidelines in the absence of
market-affecting incentives.
   Market sentiment toward a stronger dollar dominated, but the
rate is unlikely to move much before Friday, when U.S. trade
figures for February and wholesale figures for March are to be
released in Washington, said a dealer at Bank of Tokyo, speaking on
condition of anonymity.

   The ``promised land'' for Heritage
Ministries lies not at the Christian retreat formerly controlled by
television evangelist Jim Bakker but for now across the border in
North Carolina, its president said.
   The ministry will relocate to Charlotte, N.C., but ultimately
plans to settle in South Carolina, Sam Johnson announced Tuesday at
a news conference at the Heritage USA television studios.
   The ministry has made down payments on two tracts of land in
North and South Carolina totaling more than 100 acres and worth
nearly $5 million, Johnson said.
   Heritage Ministries is the non-profit television ministry spun
off from the bankruptcy reorganization of the PTL ministry in
August.
   The ministry and the separate Heritage Church, of which Johnson
is pastor, are based in Fort Mill at Heritage USA, the 2,200-acre
retreat Bakker once controlled.
   ``Amusement is a wonderful thing,'' Johnson said. ``A family
park is a wonderful thing. Mr. Bakker had a wonderful dream but it
went awry through mismanagement and misappropriations and for that
we have all paid and are paying dearly.''
   Heritage Ministries offered to purchase some of the properties
it leases for $80,000 a month from the former PTL corporation, such
as the television studio, following bankruptcy proceedings.
   But Stephen Mernick, the Toronto businessman who bought PTL's
assets for $65 million in December, was unreceptive, Johnson said.
   Johnson said he informed Mernick of the ministry's plans to move
on Monday.
   The ministry will leave Heritage USA by July 1 for a nearly
20-acre site of three lots in south Charlotte, Johnson said.
   A church on the site will serve as the home for the Heritage
Church, which has about 600 adult members, and as the studio for
the television ministry, Johnson said.
   The ministry also has made a $10,000 deposit on 88 acres of
undeveloped land in South Carolina's York County worth $2.5 million.
   Johnson said the ministry also has an option to purchase an
additional 25 acres at the site.
   The two sites are within miles of the ministry's current
headquarters.
   The ministry's ``more permanent home'' will be in York County,
where Fort Mill is located, but it has not set a timetable for
development of the site, Johnson said.
   The most important concern for the ministry, Johnson said, is
raising the money to finance the resettlement.
   One likely source is $5.5 million donated by Heritage Ministries
supporters when the ministry was considering bidding on PTL before
Mernick's purchase. The ministry plans a campaign this weekend to
reach those contributors.
   ``We believe that most of the money, if not all of it ... will
be released to help us relocate and cross the river Jordan and
enter the promised land,'' Johnson said.
   More contributions could come in from supporters who have waited
for the ministry to announce its plans, Johnson said.
   PTL filed for bankruptcy in June 1987, three months after Bakker
resigned amid revelations that he had a sexual relationship with
church secretary Jessica Hahn and later arranged payments of
ministry money to buy her silence.
   Mernick began joint operation of Heritage USA, which includes a
hotel and theme park, with bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton
on Feb. 13, but has yet to close on the sale.

   Pakistan has agreed to allow four U.N.
checkpoints on its border with Afghanistan following an exchange of
charges and denials at an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security
Council.
   Afghanistan's Marxist government and its ally the Soviet Union
claim Pakistan is violating international accords by aiding Afghan
guerrillas.
   Pakistan has denied the allegations but announced Tuesday at the
United Nations that it would allow U.N. checkpoints in Chaman,
Parachinar, Torkham and Nawa Pass.
   Most U.N. diplomats said the few checkpoints would not stem the
tide of infiltration across the border.
   The United Nations has just 50 military observers in Afghanistan
and Pakistan and Pakistan's government had allowed them to roam the
border at will but not set up checkpoints.
   Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil called for U.N. checkpoints
amd urged the Security Council to send a mission to the region to
investigate his claim that Pakistan is committing aggression
against Afghanistan.
   He accused Pakistan of waging ``full-fledged war'' and called
for an international conference to safeguard Afghanistan's
sovereignty. He said the United States and the Soviet Union, as
co-guarantors of a U.N.-mediated Afghan accord, should persuade
Pakistan to halt its support of the Afghan insurgents.
   Iqbal Akhund, a Pakistani foreign affairs official, called the
Afghan charges a fabrication. But he told the Security Council that
Pakistan has agreed to provide a permanent presence along the
border to the U.N. Military Assistance Group for Afghanistan and
Pakistan.
   Then he added: ``Peace and stability in Afghanistan can be
restored only if power is transferred from the illegal Kabul regime
to a broad-based government acceptable to the Afghan people.''
   The Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1979
to help the government battle the guerrillas and eventually had
more than 100,000 military personnel in the country. Under the
U.N.-sponsored accord, the Soviets accepted a withdrawal plan and
said the last of its troops had pulled out as of Feb. 15. Millions
of Afghan refugees fled into Pakistan over the past decade and the
major Afghan rebel groups established their bases along the
frontier.
   The Security Council, meeting in response to Afghanistan's
complaint, heard only Afghan and Pakistani speakers. The meeting
was adjourned and another session was to be scheduled after
consultations among the 15 council members.
   No resolution is expected because the United States is an ally
of Pakistan and helps support the rebels. Washington could be
expected to veto any measure critical of Pakistan.
   Wakil accused Pakistan of numerous attacks and of involving its
forces in fighting in Afghanistan, including the battle for the
city of Jalalabad near the Pakistani border.
   He also claimed Pakistan is arming and training Afghan rebels
and has established 125 training centers on Afghan soil in
violation of the U.N. accords.
   Afghanistan and Pakistan signed the pact in April 1988. It
provides for the withdrawal of the Soviet forces and
non-interference in the other country's internal affairs.
   The Soviet Union and United States signed as guarantors, but
both have continued supplying their respective sides.
   Wakil did not directly criticize the United States but said:
   ``The question is why the United States, a big world power,
becomes the tool for the implementation of Pakistani policies on
Afghanistan and why should the strategic interests of the United
States be subordinated to the expansionist designs of Pakistan in
the region.''

   The government says its troops
repelled a guerrilla assault on Jalalabad, killing hundreds of
attackers, and denies that insurgents have cut off land shipments
to the embattled eastern city.
   But guerrillas and Western diplomats in Kabul and Pakistan said
the insurgents controlled major portions of the road connecting
Jalalabad and Kabul and that only helicopters flying by night can
make the 75-mile trip.
   ``The regime's army is trying desperately to open the
Kabul-Jalalabad highway,'' the guerrillas' Afghan News Agency said
Tuesday.
   Also Tuesday, Pakistan agreed to allow the United Nations to set
up permanent monitoring posts along its border with Afghanistan as
requested by Moscow and the Marxist government in Kabul.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said government
troops on Tuesday counterattacked 14,000 U.S.-backed guerrillas
around Jalalabad after the insurgents bombarded the city with
18,000 shells and rockets Sunday and Monday.
   Amani said troops had killed 318 guerrillas by sundown Tuesday
and lost just three government soldiers and five civilians. It was
not possible to confirm the figures.
   The capture of Jalalabad, 45 miles west of the border with
Pakistan where the guerrillas are based, would give the insurgents
an important foothold and provide their shadow government-in-exile
with its first seat inside Afghanistan.
   Amani maintained that military convoys were still carrying food
and arms from Kabul to Jalalabad. He said the convoys were not seen
leaving the capital because they travel at night. Civilians are not
permitted out of their houses during a curfew starting 11 p.m. and
ending 4 a.m.
   Western diplomats in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad said
Afghan government forces were holding the city and its airport, but
guerrilla rockets and artillery make it too dangerous for
fixed-wing aircraft.
   ``The only means of resupply remaining to regime forces is by
helicopter, although such flights are increasingly being
interdicted by the resistance, even though most of them take place
at night,'' said one diplomat on condition of anonymity.
   ``Indeed, most of the flights are kept busy bringing in medical
supplies and evacuating casualties,'' the diplomat said.
   At the United Nations on Tuesday, Pakistan agreed to permit U.N.
military observers to set up permanent checkpoints along the
Afghan-Pakistan border.
   Kabul contends aid from Pakistan is flowing to the Afghan rebels
in violation of a U.N.-mediated accord on non-interference.
   Pakistan denies the charges, but its agreement on the additional
checkpoints is considered a minor concession. Diplomats said they
doubted it would alter the Afghan civil war.
   The increased presence of U.N. military observers, who now
number just 50 and are split between Kabul and Islamabad, has
repeatedly been requested by Afghanistan and the Soviet Union.
   Pakistan, the United States, China and several Moslem countries
are the main backers of the guerrillas, who began fighting after a
communist coup in 1978. Soviet military forces entered the war in
1979 and completed a U.N.-negotiated withdrawal Feb. 15.

   An elderly couple were recovering from
injuries suffered when their 700-pound hog turned into a crashing
boar and went on a rampage in their yard.
   Homer Cato, 89, and his wife Victoria, 79, have kept the pig in
their backyard for four years since he wandered onto the property
in this town about 160 miles north of Miami.
   The pig broke out of his 15-by-30-foot pen Saturday after a fire
started in the yard. He gouged Mrs. Cato's legs and right arm with
his 4-inch tusks as the couple tried to get him back in the pen,
said Xan Rawls, director of Brevard Animal Control.
   On Sunday, an ambulance was sent to the house after Cato
collapsed, Ms. Rawls said, but the pig blocked the doorway and kept
paramedics at bay.
   Animal control officials and sheriff's deputies were called in,
and two deputies shot and killed the pig as it charged them.
   The Catos were treated and released at Humana Hospital
Sebastian, a hospital spokeswoman said Tuesday. They declined to
answer a reporter's questions.
   ``Adult males can't be trusted,'' said Jack Mayer, a wild hog
expert in Tampa. ``Some days they are very lovable and take
chocolate bars and will roll over and let you scratch them on the
stomach. The next day they will slam you up against the fence. You
just don't know what is motivating them.''

<HEAD>Indictment Accuses Northrop Of Falsified Cruise Missile Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has indicted Northrop Corp.
for allegedly falsifying test data on cruise missile guidance
systems, raising questions whether the strategic nuclear weapon
would function in time of war.
   The aerospace giant and five current or former employees were
charged Tuesday with conspiring to defraud the government in the
construction of part of the Air Force missile's guidance system and
a component of the Navy's Harrier fighter jet.
   The 167-count indictment charged that Northrop and the employees
conspired to install parts for the Flight Data Transmitter of the
cruise missile that failed to meet government specifications.
   In addition to the suspect guidance systems, the defendants were
accused of falsifying test data on the stability system for the
Harrier.
   The U.S. District Court indictment said the cruise missile data
transmitter was required to undergo tests for effectiveness in
extreme cold but were not performed. The indictment said defendants
falsely certified untested units.
   In some cases, faulty components were certified as having passed
tests, according to the indictment.
   Northrop said it ``strongly disputes any allegations of criminal
behavior'' in the indictments that were announced Tuesday night by
U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner.
   ``Northrop has cooperated fully with the government during its
investigation,'' the Century City-based company added in its
statement.
   Bonner said the Air Force and Navy are evaluating evidence on
the falsifications to determine if action must be taken to ensure
reliability of the air-launched missiles (ALCMs), which are mounted
from the wings of B-1B and B-52 bombers, and the stability system
for the Harrier jet.
   But John Pike, an aerospace analyst with the Washington,
D.C.-based Federation of American Scientists, said, ``Most bombers
must fly over the polar ice cap. ...
   ``The ALCMs are going to get very cold. It would raise the
possibility that a significant number would not work if they were
called on to work.''
   Between 1981 and 1989, Northrop produced and shipped about 1,175
flight data transmitters for use in the missiles.
   Pike said if the effectiveness of the missiles were called into
question, ``It would be one of the more significant (weapons)
reliability problems in several decades.''
   Bonner said the indictment was the result of a two-year
investigation by a task force that included the Air Force's Office
of Special Investigations, the Naval Investigative Service and the
FBI.
   If convicted of all offenses, Northrop faces a maximum fine of
more than $30 million. Each defendant would face maximum prison
sentences of five years on each count and fines ranging from $5,000
to $250,000.
   Individuals indicted were Joseph Yamron, vice president and
general manager of the Precision Products Division of Northrop, in
Newton, Mass.; Leopold Engler of Massachusetts, formerly a vice
president with Northrop; Charles Gonsalves, of Glendora, Calif.,
former manager of the Western Services department of Northrop in
suburban El Monte; Cheryl Hannan, of Glendora, formerly quality
assurance supervisor for Western Services; and Howard Hyde of Yorba
Linda, former chief engineer for Western Services.
   On the cruise missile project, the indictment charges that
Northrop, Yamron and Engler knew that the flight data transmitter
was required to withstand temperatures as low as minus 65 degrees
Fahrenheit but supplied parts that froze at temperatures of minus
40 to minus 50 degrees.
   The Harrier is a high-technology jet fighter that can take off
vertically and hover. Between 1982 and 1989, Northrop produced and
shipped 189 rate sensor assemblies for the jet.
   Northrop also is the target of five civil lawsuits by former
employees who alleged the company falsified test results and
cheated the Air Force on the MX missile project.
   In addition to well-publicized battles with critics of the MX
program, the company faces a congressional investigation of
allegations of improper payments to South Korean businessmen in an
unsuccessful effort to sell its F-20 Tigershark fighter in that
country in 1984.
   Northrop also is the main contractor for the B-2 ``stealth
bomber.''

   Lamda Chi's 70 members at Tarleton
State University had been praying for the safe return of fraternity
brother Mark Kilroy, who disappeared last month in Mexico during
spring break.
   But they were horrified Tuesday to learn he was one of a dozen
victims sacrificed and mutilated by a satanic cult of drug
smugglers just south of the Mexican border.
   ``It's just so cruel,'' Zack Creech said. ``Mark never did
anything wrong. He was a real good person and had a great family. A
lot of people loved him.''
   Creech last saw Kilroy at the Hard Rock Cafe in Matamoros,
Mexico, the night of March 14. Kilroy disappeared while walking
with other friends back to the international bridge.
   ``That was the last time I saw him,'' Creech said. ``I wished I
would have went with him. I just wish to God I was there. I
wouldn't have let this happen.''
   Kilroy, who transferred last year to the University of Texas,
also was remembered fondly on the school's Austin campus.
   Frank James Padula, Kilroy's neighbor, said Kilroy's ambition to
go to medical school drove him to succeed.
   ``School came first to him and he knew how to draw that line,''
said Padula, a senior.
   Tammy Shead, who went to high school with Kilroy in his hometown
of Sante Fe, said Kilroy was always trying to be the best.
   ``He was very intelligent, a supersmart guy,'' said Shead, a
junior.
   In Houston, the 21-year-old Kilroy was mourned by boyhood friend
Eddie delaHoussaye, who grew up with him in Galveston County.
   ``Mark was a great guy,'' he said. ``He didn't deserve something
that awful happening to him.''
   He last saw Kilroy after his son was born.
   ``Mark was an usher in my wedding. And he came up from school
when my son was born,'' delaHoussaye said. ``He thought my son,
Anthony Joseph, was great. I never thought that would be the last
time I'd see him.''

<HEAD>Report: Opposition, Rebel Leaders to Meet in Attempt to Unify</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Contra rebel leaders will meet
opposition politicians in Managua next month in a bid to field a
unity coalition against the ruling Sandinistas in the 1990
elections, La Prensa reported.
   The opposition newspaper said in its Tuesday editions that
directors of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the Contra umbrella
organization, will meet with leaders of 14 opposition parties in
the capital ``if the Sandinistas don't stop them.''
   It would be the rebel leaders' first trip to Managua since June,
when talks between the Sandinistas and rebels broke down.
   Resistance leaders and domestic opposition leaders signed an
agreement Monday after meeting in Guatemala City and pledging to
unite to run against the leftist Sandinistas in February 1990
elections.
   The document, quoted by La Prensa, said the domestic opposition
and Contra leaders had accepted ``the political electoral path in
order to defeat the FSLN (Sandinista party), which will lead to
democratization, stable and durable peace, reconciliation and
reconstruction of the nation.''
   The Resistance, it said, ``reaffirms its disposition to maintain
the halt to offensive military operations during the development of
a completely free election process in our country.''
   The opposition party leaders were to return Managua today to
hold a news conference on the accord, party spokesmen said.
   The Sandinista party newspaper Barricada on Tuesday condemned
the attempts at Contra-opposition unification.
   Barricada displayed a photo of Resistance director Enrique
Bermudez embracing Eli Altamirano, leader of the opposition
Nicaraguan Communist Party.
   An accompanying editorial said the accord represented ``a
tragedy for all these parties that call themselves the internal
opposition who have shown themselves to be incapable of
administering what little legitimacy they have and risk converting
themselves into what they weren't before, an opposition hired by
Washington.''
   Bermudez was a colonel in the National Guard of dictator
Anastasio Somoza, who was toppled in 1979 in the revolution the
Sandinistas rode to power. Bermudez later served as a military
chief of the Contras, who have been backed by the United States
since 1981.
   U.S. military aid to the rebels ran out early last year. Contra
forces that sought refuge in Honduras after the aid ran out are
receiving humanitarian aid.
   Seven opposition parties hold 35 seats in the 96-member
legislature, including the Communist Party and the Marxist-Leninist
Popular Action Movement. The ruling Sandinistas have 61 seats in
the National Assembly.

   Unidentified assailants ambushed a
U.S. military convoy, raking it with gunfire and disabling a jeep
with an explosive, but no casualties were reported, a U.S. Embassy
spokesman said.
   The attack Tuesday in northern Honduras was the third this year
on U.S. troops in the country.
   The caravan of 11 jeeps was hit as it carried supplies to troops
taking part in military exercises, said the spokesman, Charles V.
Barclay. He said 14 U.S. and six Honduran soldiers were in the
vehicles.
   ``We don't know how many people were involved in the attack, but
an investigation is in progress,'' said Barclay.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but leftist
groups including the Cinchonero People's Liberation Movement have
attacked U.S. troops in the past.
   Barclay said the incident occurred on a road near Olanchito,
about 125 miles north of Tegucigalpa, the capital.
   ``There were several gunshots and an explosive device that blew
up beneath one of the vehicles,'' said Barclay. He said the nature
of the device was unknown.
   U.S. and Honduran troops are taking part in a joint exercise to
build roads in northern Honduras. The exercise started in December
and will end in July, with 600 U.S. troops rotating in every two
weeks.
   The Honduran armed forces, in a statement, called it a
``criminal attack on members of both armies who are working jointly
to create an adequate highway infrastructure to improve living
conditions for Hondurans.''
   U.S. and Honduran forces are investigating the Tuesday morning
attack, a Honduran armed forces statement said.
   The troops were scheduled to return today to Enrique Soto Cano
Air Base, 50 miles north of Tegucigalpa, Barclay said.
   At least two soldiers have been killed and six injured in
attacks on U.S. forces in Honduras in the last four years.
   On Feb. 1, a U.S. troop convoy was hit by gunfire but no one was
injured. The last attack occurred on Feb. 18, when an unidentified
assailant hurled a bomb at a passing bus carrying 25 U.S. troops.
   The explosive destroyed the bus and injured three U.S. soldiers
and two Honduran passers-by.

<HEAD>Mexico Signs $3.6 Billion Debt Assistance Agreement With IMF</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico has signed a $3.65 billion three-year
loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund to bolster the
country's foreign exchange reserves and help spur domestic economic
growth.
   The accord breaks from previous IMF practice by mandating no new
austerity measures, said Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe.
   Mexico, struggling to overcome the burden of payments to
commercial banks and governments on its $107 billion foreign debt,
is the developing world's second-largest debtor. Only Brazil owes
more _ $121 billion.
   Tuesday's agreement is the first from the international lending
community since U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady outlined a
debt-reduction plan on March 10 that he hoped would help ease
payment terms on the developing world's $1.32 trillion foreign debt.
   As interest rates have risen worldwide since last year, the
higher rates have created additional problems for countries
struggling to meet the terms of payments to foreign creditors. Some
debtor nations threaten default unless they can arrive at more
favorable terms with lenders.
   Austerity measures imposed by the Venezuelan government at the
behest of international lending organizations prompted riots last
month in Caracas that led to the deaths of more than 300 people.
   Aspe said Tuesday that his country's agreement intends to
reverse Mexico's net outflow of funds and provide investment money
to spur economic growth, which was nil last year.
   By stipulating that the IMF recognizes Mexico's need to set its
growth priorities first and schedule debt servicing accordingly,
Aspe said the agreement ``is a fundamental change from the past.''
   ``The agreement reached with the IMF constitutes a plain
endorsement of the economic strategy of Mexico,'' he said.
   That means the IMF will not require further devaluations of the
Mexican peso, as has been called for in previous agreements in an
effort to stimulate exports, said one government official on
condition of anonymity.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortarihas pressed efforts to cut
the outflow of capital needed to revitalize Mexico's stagnant
economy.
   Mexico has been expected to be among the first beneficiaries of
the U.S. plan, which seeks to entice banks to forgive part of the
debt in return for assurances from the IMF and World Bank that the
remaining debt will be paid.
   Aspe also announced that Mexico will conclude an agreement this
week with the World Bank for $1.5 billion in credits to support the
government's restructuring programs.
   In addition, Mexico shortly expects to obtain $500 million in
compensatory financing from the fund, Aspe said. The combined
credits ``will be devoted to operations that reduce the debt and
its servicing,'' he said.
   On April 19, Mexico will formally present creditor banks its
proposals to reduce the foreign debt's value, cut servicing and
obtain additional lending over several years, the treasury chief
said.
   Mexico will offer banks the option of exchanging old debt for
Mexican bonds that discount debt principal and reduce interest
rates, Aspe told the private ``24 Hours'' newscast late Tuesday.
   Mexico netted a $1.1 billion reduction of debt principal in a
bond auction backed by the U.S. Treasury last year.
   Aspe said the IMF agreement also will promote Mexico's efforts
to reach restructuring agreements with the Paris Club of creditor
government banks.
   He stressed that Tuesday's pact ``is a new type of agreement
that bolsters a strategy of sustained economic growth with price
stability,'' a clear reference to Salinas' anti-inflation program.
   That program has reduced inflation from a record 159.2 percent
in 1987 to 52.7 percent in 1988. The government predicts inflation
will reach 18 percent this year.

   Many voters are angry that Gov. Gaston
Caperton broke his no-tax campaign pledge, but Caperton defends the
record tax hike and says he couldn't be more satisfied with his
first three months in office.
   ``We inherited a state which was in real crisis,'' the
Democratic governor said Tuesday. ``I think we well-defined that
crisis and with a cooperative effort with the Legislature ... have
set forth a legislative program to turn this state around, and we
batted about 1,000 percent.''
   The $392 million tax package is just one of the accomplishments
Caperton pointed to with pride after the regular legislative
session ended last week.
   Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle passed virtually all his
major bills, including one calling for a sweeping reorganization of
state government, and generally gave him rave reviews for his
leadership. It was a dramatic change from the previous four years,
in which a Legislature dominated by Democrats fought almost
constantly with combative Republican Gov. Arch Moore, who lost to
Caperton in November.
   ``He's been honest,'' said Republican state Sen. Buffy Warner.
``He's been very actively and personally involved. And I think both
on the surface and the deeper you look, the man is trying his
absolute best to do what has to be done in this state.''
   Caperton inherited a treasury that was millions of dollars in
debt because of severe slumps in the coal and steel industries in
recent years, which drove up unemployment, and cuts in federal
assistance.
   Despite his campaign pledge, Caperton asked the Legislature for
the largest tax increase in its history, including a new 6 percent
sales tax on food and a 5-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax.
   ``I also said I'd never be a governor who couldn't pay his
bills,'' Caperton said. ``We had the courage and the guts to stand
up and ... raise taxes. No one likes to raise taxes and no one
likes to pay additional taxes. But it was necessary.''
   Many voters apparently didn't appreciate that courage. Some tax
protesters who showed up at the Capitol last month carried signs
calling for Caperton's impeachment.
   A statewide poll conducted in mid-March showed 73 percent of
respondents thought Caperton broke his campaign promise by pushing
for a tax hike within a week of taking office, and two-thirds rated
his job performance as just fair or poor.
   The poll showed Caperton would trail Moore by 43 percent to 36
percent if an election were held today.
   Lawmakers approved Caperton's plan to consolidate more than 155
state agencies and departments under seven gubernatorially
appointed, cabinet-level secretaries.
   They also approved Caperton's request to put proposed
constitutional amendments before voters in September. One amendment
would abolish the elected posts of secretary of state, treasurer
and agriculture commissioner and put the jobs under the governor's
control. Another would place the Board of Education under the
governor's control.
   Agriculture Commissioner Cleve Benedict, the only Republican
holding statewide office, said Caperton was making a grab for power.
   ``It's the honeymoon express,'' he said. ``Every governor enjoys
a period of good will with the Legislature. This time it is
amplified by the governor's party's overwhelming control of both
chambers of the Legislature.''
   Caperton says he isn't concerned about the polls or the
protests. And Warner, one of only four Republicans in the 34-seat
Senate, says there's plenty of time for anger to ease before
Caperton's term ends in 1992.
   ``Four years will be enough time to see that he's done the
things that needed to be done,'' he said.

   The don't-drink-and-drive message went Hollywood
this season, with TV stars making references to ``designated
drivers'' and occasionally wresting car keys away from inebriated
characters.
   The additions were part of a carefully scripted effort to
introduce the notion that drinking and driving is socially
unacceptable from the powerful podium of prime-time television,
said Jay Winsten of the Harvard Alcohol Project.
   ``One of our goals was to increase public awareness just of the
concept of designated driver to introduce it into the American
lexicon,'' said Winsten, assistant dean of Harvard's School of
Public Health and director of its Center for Health Communication.
   Scenes varied from devious J.R. Ewing of ``Dallas'' sleeping off
a night on the town before heading for Southfork to ``Family Ties''
character Alex Keaton volunteering to drive friends home from an
evening jaunt.
   The message has been written into 32 television programs since
the season began last fall, including an entire episode of ABC's
highly rated ``Growing Pains'' to be broadcast tonight, Winsten
said.
   ``You don't change social norms overnight, but we're off to a
good start,'' he said.
   The Harvard Alcohol Project, begun in late 1987, is trying to
harness the influence of Hollywood and Madison Avenue in making
drinking and driving as socially passe as smoking cigarettes.
   Last year, Harvard researchers made a low-key appeal to
television executives to write in occasional references to
designated drivers. The proposal was endorsed by the board of the
Writer's Guild of America-West.
   Having characters casually refer to picking a designated driver,
someone who stays sober to drive the drinkers home, reinforces what
is already becoming accepted partying behavior, Winsten said.
   ``Our role really is as a catalyst,'' he said. ``Producers, like
the public, they're primed and ready to respond to this issue.''
   The message was broadcast in various ways this season.
   On one episode of CBS' ``Dallas,'' a bedraggled J.R. Ewing
explains to his young son that he couldn't drive home the night
before because he'd been drinking. Of course, J.R. isn't telling
the whole truth about his nocturnal adventures, but the message is
clear.
   On NBC's ``Family Ties,'' Alex Keaton, the character played by
Michael J. Fox, visits a restaurant with a tank of live fish. When
a member of the group is soaked in a mishap in the tank, Fox is
asked to take her home. He responds by saying he is the designated
driver, but had expected to drive home someone who drank like a
fish, not someone who was hit by a fish.
   The ``Growing Pains'' episode revolves around Carol Seaver
(Tracey Gold) and her boyfriend, Sandy, who is seriously injured in
an auto accident after drinking at a college hangout.
   ``What we hope to achieve is, I guess, just an increased
awareness of the dangers involved and try to puncture the myth of
invulnerability that most teen-agers have,'' said Steve Marshall, a
``Growing Pains'' producer.
   Many campaigns have focused on discouraging drunken driving, a
leading cause of death among young adults, but the Harvard project
originates from a public school of health that traditionally
focuses on training epidemiologists and other health professionals.

   Seven children and two women who died in a
house fire apparently had little warning because a first-floor
smoke detector in an empty apartment didn't work, authorities said.
   The victims were sleeping on the second floor, said Gregory
Joos, Peoria's fire administration manager.
   ``By the time they were aware their home was on fire,'' he said,
``the fire had gotten a very good start and their means of getting
out of the structure had already been cut off due to the heat and
smoke.''
   Fire swept through the rented, two-story dwelling about 2 a.m.
Tuesday, killing nine people and injuring two adults and one child.
Three families lived in the house in a working-class section of
Peoria, population 130,000.
   ``I came home and I saw the lights and awakened my husband,''
said neighbor Maria Diaz. ``We came running out and by the time we
came out, the house was already engulfed in flames.''
   Later Tuesday, police arrested Joe Pickens, 34, and charged him
with criminal trespass for living in the first floor of the
building without permission, said Fire Chief G. John Parker.
   Pickens was at the building Monday night, and left at 11:30
p.m., Parker said. Pickens, who was not charged in the fire, was
apparently homeless and sometimes stayed at the house, the fire
chief said.
   Pickens was being held at the Peoria County Jail.
   Smoke detectors were found in the building, but the first-floor
detector was powered by electricity, which had been cut on the
first floor April 4 because bills went unpaid, said Central
Illinois Light Co. spokesman Tom Flanagan.
   Electricity worked on the building's second floor, Flanagan
said. Officials were unsure whether the second-floor detector had
sounded.
   Joos said local and state codes require smoke detectors in
apartments and homes.
   ``Landlord and tenant both share the responsibility of making
sure that not only the smoke detector exists, but making sure that
they work and are functioning correctly,'' he said.
   The fire started on the first floor near the door, and
investigators were examining a gas heater, said Parker. ``At this
point we still don't have any indication that this is a suspicious
or an arson fire,'' he said.
   Parker said as many as 15 firefighters will undergo
psychological counseling to help them cope with stress linked to
the deaths.
   ``We're going to try to talk to all the guys and see if there's
any problem,'' he said. ``If we find out they're suffering, we
won't have them back (yet).''
   The cause of the deaths appeared to be smoke inhalation, said
Assistant Fire Chief Sam Sisk. The children ranged in age from 2
months to 10 years.
   At Franciscan Medical Center in Rock Island, Joyce Barnes, 30,
and Eric Davis, 14, were in fair condition today, said nursing
supervisor Sue Newberry.
   Coroner Herbert Buzbee identified the dead as Wanda Hobbs, 20,
and her children, Ashly Hobbs, 1, and Felicia Hobbs, 3; Terry
Davis, 27, and her children, Carlyssa Davis, 2, Arnisha Davis, 7,
and Tenora Davis, 10.
   Also killed were Jacoby Thomas, the 2{-year-old daughter of Ms.
Barnes; and Eugene Roberts Jr., 2 months, believed to be the son of
either Ms. Hobbs or Ms. Davis, Buzbee said.

   The city's first black school chief hung on to his
job by one vote, but opponents of Laval S. Wilson vowed to continue
working to oust him.
   Bitterness from the 7-6 vote Tuesday night by the Boston School
Committee spilled over to the announcement that Wilson's contract
would be renewed.
   As committee President Tom O'Reilly tried to move on to other
agenda items after the announcement, committee member Robert
Cappucci suddenly took command of the microphone.
   ``We're going to do everything in our power to see to it that we
get a new superintendent,'' Cappucci said.
   Wilson said he was delighted with the renewal but acknowledged
there had been problems during his tenure.
   ``I don't think anyone was expecting a real endorsement,'' the
53-year-old Chicago native said after the announcement. ``The issue
was whether or not we could continue the progress we've made.''
   Wilson's arrival in Boston four years ago to operate the
country's oldest public school system was heralded as the healing
of racial wounds that had festered since the first days of
federally ordered desegregation in the mid-1970s.
   But the honeymoon has come to an end in recent months, with
critics increasingly denouncing what they call Wilson's
``autocratic'' style.
   Committee member John Nucci, who supports Wilson, said it was
everyone's duty to try to make the uneasy union work.
   ``I hope they realize that personal vendetta have to be put
aside in the interest of the school system,'' he said. ``We have to
think of the kids first.''
   But Cappucci said he and other dissenters would show their
displeasure by voting down Wilson's program proposals and making an
intense effort to lobby the swing vote necessary to oust the
superintendent.
   ``There's going to be some troublemaking,'' said Peggy
Davis-Mullen, a committee member and one of Wilson's fiercest
detractors.
   The committee, which announced its decision after deliberating
about two hours behind closed doors, offered Wilson a contract
without an increase to his $95,000 salary and with performance
reviews every six months.
   ``It's not a working situation,'' Cappucci said. ``I don't see
how Dr. Wilson thinks he'll be able to get anything done.
   ``If I were him, I'd see the handwriting on the wall ... and bow
out,'' he said. ``He is not the man for the Boston job.''
   Mrs. Mullen said some people who oppose Wilson ``are afraid
they're going to be attacked for being racist. But black leaders
have come out against this man. It's his approach. He's not a
communicator, not a motivator.''
   The system has become increasingly black since the early 1970s,
when white students began moving in droves from public to private
schools. There are 59,000 students, 24 percent of them white,
enrolled in Boston's public schools today as compared with 96,000
in 1972, when 60 percent of students were white.
   Supporters have said Wilson is a tireless worker who regularly
puts in 12-hour days and deserves a fair shot at turning the
troubled system around, but detractors claim he hasn't dealt
effectively with high dropout rates and low test scores.

   Mayor Tom Bradley fended off an upstart
challenger to win an unprecedented fifth term in a squeaker
election that almost had him facing a runoff.
   ``Never take anything for granted,'' the 71-year-old Bradley
told supporters today after his narrow victory.
   Bradley _ the city's first black mayor, an ex-cop and son of a
sharecropper _ needed at least 50 percent of the vote to avoid a
June 6 runoff.
   Early today, he held more than 52 percent of the vote with 98.4
percent of the city's precincts reporting. At one point, he had
dropped to 50 percent of Tuesday's non-partisan vote, in which
turnout was less than 20 percent.
   Bradley's nearest finisher among the 10 candidates, freshman
Councilman Nate Holden, conceded after midnight.
   ``A little more time and more money, there could have been a
difference,'' said Holden, who gathered only $150,000 for his
campaign funds versus Bradley's $2 million.
   Bradley, who remained out of sight most of Tuesday night,
declared victory early today.
   ``I am grateful for the people who gave us this victory,'' he
told supporters at the Biltmore Hotel.
   Bradley quickly pledged to renew the battle against drugs and
gangs that plague the nation's second largest city.
   With 98.4 percent of the 2,353 precincts reporting, Bradley had
152,373 of the vote, or 52.13 percent. Holden had 81,747 votes, or
28 percent; and former county supervisor and television commentator
Baxter Ward drew 44,186 votes, or 15 percent.
   Only 16.5 percent, or 384,000 of the city's 1.9 million
registered voters, went to the polls to elect the officials to lead
Los Angeles during the next four years.
   A poll taken recently by The Los Angeles Times showed 78 percent
of Hispanics, 70 percent of whites and 68 percent of blacks had a
favorable impression of the Democratic mayor.
   That's led Bradley to be dubbed the ``Teflon mayor'' because
he's apparently not being blamed for the city's mounting urban
problems.
   Other candidates included a socialist oil field worker and a
singer-dancer who used to cavort in a green bikini across the
street from City Hall every day.
   The victory by Bradley, who has been mayor 16 years, puts him in
a position to oversee Los Angeles into the early 1990s as the
population swells past 3 million people, with more than 70
different languages spoken.
   Bradley had been expected to win another four-year term despite
a city attorney's office announcement of an ethics investigation of
him after learning he had performed consulting work with Far East
National Bank, which did business with the city. Bradley has
returned the $18,000 in fees he was paid by the bank and called the
charges politically motivated at election time.
   Pollsters and would-be opponents such as City Councilman Zev
Yaroslavsky agreed that Bradley's low-key image kept him from being
linked in voters' minds with Los Angeles' growing problems,
including criminal gangs, illegal drug trade, traffic congestion
and a failing sewage system.
   Bradley, the son of a Texas sharecropper and the grandson of
slaves, was first elected mayor in 1973.
   He has run twice for governor as a Democrat, losing in 1982 and
1986 to Republican Gov. George Deukmejian.
   A student and track star at UCLA, Bradley entered public service
as a Los Angeles Police lieutenant, and later was elected to the
City Council.
   He was defeated in his first run at mayor in a bitter 1969 race
against incumbent Sam Yorty that critics said was tinged with
racism.

<HEAD>Suburb Where Woman Shot Students Bans Handguns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINNETKA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Handguns are now banned in this affluent
Chicago suburb, where the quiet was shattered 11 months ago when a
deranged woman went on a shooting rampage in an elementary school.
   After only minutes of debate, Village Council voted 6-0 Tuesday
night to adopt an ordinance banning the private ownership of
handguns.
   ``I hope this will make Winnetka a better place, and we will
leave a better heritage for all of you,'' Village President Clarine
Hall told a group of young children who gave flowers to council
members after the vote.
   The children, their parents and others pushed for passage of the
ban.
   On May 20, 1988, Laurie Dann walked into a Winnetka elementary
school classroom, killed an 8-year-old boy and wounded several
other children. She later wounded a young man at his home, then
killed herself.
   She carried three handguns she bought in neighboring Glenview.
   ``It is almost a year, and I am satisfied that this has had
thoughtful consideration,'' said Ms. Hall, referring to the ban.
   Oliver Ralli, 9, a fourth-grader, said he was ``mad that Laurie
Dann wounded kids and killed one in school. I just wanted to ban
handguns.''
   Board member Sandra Levin said she would rather see state and
national laws banning handguns, ``but I don't foresee this in the
near future.''
   ``That's why we have to start on the local level,'' Ms. Levin
said.
   The vote came a week after Winnetka residents, in a nonbinding
referendum, voted 2,125 to 1,407 in favor of banning handguns in
the town, north of Chicago on Lake Michigan. Schoolchildren made
posters and signs, urging people to vote for the ban.
   The new ordinance bans the sale and possession of handguns. It
excludes police officers, gun collectors and security guards.
   Violators face a fine of $300 to $500 for a first offense.
   The measure, which takes effect immediately, calls for the
voluntary surrender of nonexempt guns to the Police Department
within three months.
   Winnetka has few crimes. Last year, the village of 13,000 had no
reported robberies or rapes. Police haven't fired a gun for at
least a year, and before the Dann incident, the last homicide was
in 1957.
   James Zangrilli, a resident of Oak Park and a national board
member of the National Rifle Association, said that such a ban was
unconstitutional and would turn ordinary citizens into lawbreakers.
   Five other Chicago suburbs have handgun bans, including Morton
Grove, which in 1981 became the first U.S. community to prohibit
the weapons. Evanston and Oak Park followed suit, while Ms. Dann's
shooting rampage provided the impetus for two northern suburbs,
Wilmette and Highland Park, to prohibit handguns.
   State lawmakers recently introduced legislation that calls for a
mandatory waiting period before all handgun sales.

<HEAD>Military Says It Will Intervene Again If `Order' Is Disrupted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVA VERGARA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet, the army
commander and leader of Chile since 1973, says the military will
intervene again if ``order'' is not maintained by the next
government.
   Chile's military is preparing to surrender power after 16 years
of authoritarian rule.
   In October, voters rejected a military proposal to extend
Pinochet's term until 1997. An open presidential election now is
scheduled for Dec. 14 with the winner to take office on March 11.
   The 73-year-old Pinochet, speaking Monday night in southern
Chile, said the armed forces must ``guard the constitutional
order.''
   ``That obliges us to make sure, without hesitation, that the
sons of this land will not see the efforts of these years
destroyed,'' he said. ``We will continue to work to ensure that
those seeking political power are authentic democrats, who defend
the model of a free society.''
   Army Gen. Alejandro Medina, commander of the military academy,
delivered a stronger message Monday to hundreds of non-commissioned
officers.
   ``If the institutional order is broken, the armed forces have
the duty to restore it, using ... all the necessary means,'' he
said.
   Medina said civilians must understand ``the role of the armed
forces,'' and that role is not one of a policeman watching the
country ``but to support the reign of law and the institutional
order.''
   Opposition leaders have denounced what the military calls the
institutional order, which is based on a 1980 constitution approved
in a referendum.
   Opponents have centered their criticism on two issues: A
constitutional article that allows Pinochet and the heads of the
other military branches to remain as commanders until 1998, and the
creation of a military-dominated National Security Council to
``represent'' its views on crucial matters.
   No significant progress has been reported in negotiations
between the government and opposition on possible constitutional
changes.
   Pinochet authorized the negotiations but said he would not allow
changes in key articles.

   A bandit with a penchant for
robbing banks and a knack for escape is back behind bars because
plastic surgery designed to make him look like actor Robert DeNiro
failed to fool the feds.
   Deputy U.S. marshals arrested Robert Litchfield, 41, on Tuesday
in this Florida Panhandle resort community.
   Litchfield was the first man to escape from the federal
penetentiary at Leavenworth, Kan., in 12 years, said W.L. McLendon,
U.S. marshal for northern Florida. He escaped March 10.
   ``Robert DeNiro is his idol,'' said Ken Pekarek, the U.S.
marshal for Kansas said from Kansas City, Kan. ``He said he altered
his appearance so he would look like Robert DeNiro.''
   Litchfield's nickname, ``Blockhouse Bandit,'' stemmed from his
specialty of robbing bank drive-in windows separate from main banks
in the Miami area, McLendon said.
   Litchfield had been serving 140 years for numerous armed bank
robberies in Florida and a 1986 escape. He used a disguise to
escape from Leavenworth, passing himself off as an employee and
walked out the front door of the prison to a waiting cab.
   In February 1986, he escaped from a federal prison in Talladega,
Ala. In that escape, he dyed his prison uniform blue and convinced
a prison dentist he was a visitor. He was arrested May 20, 1987, in
Lake Tahoe, Nev.
   Pekarek said Litchfield is a suspect in the March 24 holdup of
Georgia Federal Bank in Tucker, Ga., where a man posing as a
utility worker investigating a natural gas leak fled with about
$38,000 in cash.

   Wild Bill Hickok was shot in the head
during a poker game in Deadwood more than a century ago, but the
city's voters have bet that restoring gambling will give a shot in
the arm to the gold-rush town's economy.
   Residents voted 690-230 Tuesday to allow poker, blackjack and
slot machines, with the city's cut of the proceeds to be used to
restore and preserve buildings in the historic Black Hills
community of 2,000.
   An amendment to the South Dakota Constitution last year provided
that gambling limited to $5 bets would be permitted in Deadwood if
60 percent of the city's voters approved it.
   South Dakota is the third state to allow casino gambling,
joining New Jersey and Nevada.
   Melodee Nelson, head of the Deadwood You Bet Committee, said
legalized gambling should boost the economy, increase tourism,
create jobs and help hold down property taxes.
   ``But let's all remember it's first and foremost a funding
mechanism for historic preservation,'' she said. ``That's what it
started out as. That's what it's always been.''
   Supporters hope the games can begin this summer, said Bill
Walsh, owner of the 85-year-old Franklin Hotel. He said the
restoration of gambling is about as important as the arrival of the
first train in 1890.
   ``It's here, and we want to all jump on the train and ride this
thing for the betterment of the city of Deadwood and the state of
South Dakota,'' he said.
   About 50 supporters of the measure gathered Tuesday night in the
hotel lobby, which is guarded by a bust of Hickok.
   But their celebration was subdued by the outcome of the mayoral
election. Mayor Tom Blair, a gambling supporter, ran into trouble
in his re-election bid. Blair finished second in a three-way race,
and now will face first-place finisher Bruce Oberlander in a runoff
in two weeks.
   Some residents quietly opposed a return to gambling on moral
grounds, and argued that the games wouldn't provide that much of an
economic boost.
   ``I don't know that I'm as disappointed as much as I'm hurt by
this, when people aren't looking at moral issues here,'' said the
Rev. Don Hadrick of the United Methodist Church in Deadwood.
   Supporters think gambling will help make the area a final
destination for tourists, instead of just a stop on the way to
Yellowstone National Park, the Rocky Mountains or Mount Rushmore
National Monument, which is about 50 miles away.
   They have predicted gambling could attract at least 200,000
additional tourists a year. It also could provide $500,000 annually
to further promote tourism by restoring an Old West look to the
city founded when miners flooded the area afer the 1876 discovery
of gold in Deadwood Gulch.
   Before gambling begins, a South Dakota Gaming Commission will be
appointed to write regulations.
   Deadwood owes much of its tourism reputation to Hickok, the U.S.
marshal and frontiersman who was shot in the back of the head in
1876 during a poker game in a saloon called No. 10. Legend has it
he was holding a pair each of aces and eights, known since as the
``dead man's hand.''
   Gambling has been illegal in South Dakota for about 100 years,
but illegal games flourished openly in Deadwood saloons as recently
as the 1930s and '40s.
   A law passed by the Legislature this year gave the state 40
percent of any gambling taxes and other revenues, with Lawrence
County to get a 10 percent cut. The city of Deadwood was left with
all the tax and fee revenue remaining after the expenses of
regulating the games are paid.

<DATELINE>MATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of this border city said
today they hope they can ward off a stigma that could be attached
to their community after the cult mutilations of at least 12 people.
   ``It is not fair if people in the United States try to judge all
of us just because a few people committed these atrocities,''
Ignacio Garcia, a supervisor at Pancho Villa's restaurant, said
this morning. ``Those people may not even be from Matamoros.
   ``We don't really know what the reaction of the American people
will be, but we are very concerned and we will tell the tourists
that 99.9 percent of the people here are good and that it only
takes one or two to give the others the bad name.''
   Five men have been arrested in connection with the slayings,
Mexican authorities said. Authorities on Tuesday announced the
arrests after discovering several graves at the Santa Elena Ranch,
outside of Matamoros.
   The graves contained remains of 12 bodies, including that of
Mark Kilroy, a 21-year-old University of Texas premedical student
who disappeared from the streets of Matamoros during spring break
on March 14.
   Authorities said the victims, most of them still unidentified,
were sacrificed in a voodoo ritual intended to ward off harm to the
suspects during drug-smuggling activities.
   The streets of Matamoros were quiet early this morning, a day
after the revelations hit the newspapers and television airwaves.
   Resident Beatrice Cistkovit said many residents worried about
Kilroy after his parents, James and Helen Kilroy, offered a $15,000
reward seeking information about his disappearance.
   ``We put ourselves in the parents' position. We really felt for
them,'' she said. ``They should give those guys the death penalty
because it's horrible what they did. They should hang. They don't
deserve to live.''
   However, she worried that publicity about the case could cast a
dark shadow on the city.
   With a month before summer vacationers begin their annual summer
descent on Matamoros, some residents said the revelations will not
greatly affect tourism.
   ``This town is a tranquil place. There are some fights every
once in a while and there are some faith healers here, too, but
nothing like this has ever happened and it's new to us,'' said
Manuel Sandoval, a restaurant manager. ``This may take a little
time to pass, but we think it won't hurt us too much.''

   For Mayor Tom Bradley, called the ``Teflon
mayor'' because the blame for the city's problems hasn't stuck to
him in the past, the timing for a re-election bid couldn't have
been much worse.
   Gang-related murders are on the rise, traffic congestion is
horrendous, the sewage system is failing and there's problems with
smog, housing and homelessness.
   The 71-year-old Bradley, Los Angeles' first black mayor, won
election to an unprecedented fifth term Tuesday but by a far less
of a margin than published polls had predicted.
   Early today, he held more than 52 percent of the vote with 98.4

percent to avoid a June 6 runoff. His nine rivals were not well
known and voter turnout was less than 20 percent.
   A recent poll by the Los Angeles Times showed 78 percent of
Hispanics, 70 percent of whites and 68 percent of blacks had a
favorable impression of the Democratic mayor.
   Pollsters had said that Bradley's low-key image helped him.
   Bradley, mayor for 16 years, a city councilman and a policeman
before that, may be one of the most private public persons in
America.
   ``There's a mystery about him that I don't know if anyone will
ever crack,'' former press deputy Tom Sullivan once said.``I've
spent more time with him than anyone, including his wife, during
the campaigns. I still don't understand him.''
   His political powers as mayor include an ability to heal his
wounds almost overnight and a quick recovery when he slips.
   He's slipped twice in runs for governor. In his first try, he
lost to George Deukmejian in 1982 by just 1.2 percent.
   Some said voter racism shaved the ballots Bradley needed to win,
but he refused to blame prejudice for losing the campaign, except
in oblique references years later.
   With a monotonal speech delivery and a decided dislike for
public feuding, Bradley is a far cry from such contemporaries as
New York's Edward Koch.
   But at 6-foot-4 and still bearing an athletic trim in his eighth
decade, Bradley can afford to dispense with histrionics and
arm-waving to get things done.
   His political power, observers say, lies in his attention to
detail _ he takes notes on potholes while riding through the city _
and his refusal to delegate authoity to staffers. Their role is to
do his bidding, and do it quickly.
   Wanda Moore, Bradley's executive assistant, has said Bradley
sees 99.9 percent of the paperwork that passes through his office,
down to gripe letters from constituents.
   His 1987 appointment calendar, opened to the Los Angeles Times,
shows him in unrelenting motion, working 16 to 18 hours a day,
seven days a week.
   He went to 512 social engagements that year, including birthday
parties, bar mitzvahs, weddings, pancake breakfasts and the opening
of a fast-food chicken restaurant.
   Those appearances are another key for Bradley _ his ability in a
city of more than 3 million to appear to be everywhere at once. He
doesn't even have to be in some spots to have his presence felt.
   Busts of Bradley stare at visitors at the Los Angeles
International Airport's Tom Bradley Terminal, the Los Angeles
Convention Center and the Los Angeles Produce Mart, all tributes to
the revitalization and building of the city for which Bradley has
taken credit without the usual hoopla.
   He also brought the profitable 1984 Summer Olympics to the city,
and has encouraged Los Angeles' role as an important center of
Pacific Rim trading.

<HEAD>6 Months in Prison for Ex-Broker in Business Week Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. stockbroker was
sentenced to six months in prison and ordered to make full
restitution for insider-trading based on advance knowledge of
market sensitive Business Week articles.
   U.S. District Judge John Walker sentenced William Dillon to two
years in prison Tuesday but suspended all but six months because
Dillon was cooperating with federal investigators.
   The judge turned down a defense lawyer's request that Dillon not
be sent to jail, saying the former broker was ``motivated by greed,
pure and simple.''
   Dillon, 34, of Old Lyme, Conn., pleaded guilty last year to a
single count of wire fraud. He could have been sentenced to a
maximum five years in prison and fined $250,000.
   Dillon began working at Merrill Lynch's New London, Conn.,
office in 1986. He was fired last July after the firm discovered he
had been obtaining advance copies of Business Week from workers at
a printing plant.
   The printer, R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co., has fired several
employees for allegedly selling copies of the magazine before its
official publication date.
   ``I am truly sorry for what I did,'' Dillon said.
   Dillon also was placed on three years' probation and ordered to
perform 200 hours of community service. The judge also ordered
Dillon to make full restitution of an amount to be determined by
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The government contends that Dillon, who now works as a
carpenter, made some $118,000 in profits from more than 120 trades
between May 1986 and July 1988, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl
Loewenson Jr.
   Dillon also pleaded guilty to a fraud count in Connecticut and
is due to be sentenced there on Thursday, said Loewenson.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. military team arrived in Vietnam
today for the fifth joint field investigation to account for
American servicemen missing from the Vietnam War, a U.S. spokesman
said.
   The 10 specialists flew from Bangkok to Vietnam's capital of
Hanoi for the 18-day mission, which is expected to be the longest
of its type since the war ended, said Ross Petzing, the spokesman
of the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok.
   Previous investigations were limited to about 10 days each.
   The U.S. investigators, including forensic scientists, are from
the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center and the Army Central
Identification Laboratory, both based in Honolulu. They will work
with officials of Vietnam's Office For Seeking Missing Personnel.
   U.S. Defense Department officials said earlier that most of the
investigative work this month would focus on the area of Danang, a
major port 400 miles southeast of Hanoi.
   Danang is in what was South Vietnam, which the United States
supported in the war the against Communist north. The Marines who
splashed ashore there in March 1965 were the first American combat
troops to set foot on the Asian mainland since the end of the
Korean conflict.
   U.S. forces withdrew in 1973 and South Vietnam fell to Communist
forces in April 1975.
   In the joint field missions, American and Vietnamese
investigators interview villagers and inspect U.S. warplane crash
sites to try to resolve ``discrepancy cases'' that the U.S.
considers top priority.
   These are cases that U.S. officials say Vietnamese authorities
should have information on, including cases of airmen who survived
crashes but failed to emerge from prisoner of war camps.
   The U.S. Defense Department previously announced that Vietnam on
April 27 would return 21 sets of remains that may be those of
missing Americans.
   Vietnam has returned large numbers of remains since August 1987,
when it agreed to accelerate cooperation on the issue in return for
Washington's help in encouraging private humanitarian aid to
Vietnam.
   More than 1,700 Americans are listed as missing in action in
Vietnam and others are unaccounted for in Laos, Cambodia and China.
   The pro-Vietnamese government in Cambodia claims to have found
the remains of some of the 83 U.S. servicemen missing there, but a
senior Cambodian official last week there was ``no progress'' in
arranging their repatriation.
   Uch Kiman, director of the Foreign Ministry's Political
Department, repeated his government's demand that the U.S.
government receive the remains directly and not through
intermediaries.
   Washington has refused to do that and instead has requested
assistance from an international organization because it does not
recognize the government, which Vietnam installed after invading
the country in late 1978.
   ``There should be negotiations between governments, not between
this government and private groups,'' Uch Kiman said in an
interview in Phnom Penh with two Western journalists.
   ``We don't seem to have a positive signal from the American
government ... regarding the return of the remains of the MIAs,''
he said.
   In February, Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen told a former
American aid official that about 10 percent of the 83 Americans
listed as MIA have been found.

<HEAD>Commander Says Soviet Sub Crew Gave Up Too Late</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More sailors might have survived the sinking of a
Soviet submarine off Norway if they had realized sooner that the
vessel could not be saved, the Soviet Northern Fleet commander said
in an interview published today.
   ``People didn't think about retreat, they were sure they would
be able to save the ship, and so part of the submarine's crew
didn't get a chance to use the life-saving equipment on board,''
Adm. Felix N. Gromov told the Defense Ministry newspaper Red Star.
   The nuclear-powered submarine, carrying two nuclear-tipped
missiles, caught fire and sank Friday, killing 42 of its crew of 69.
   The Soviet navy plans to raise the ship from its resting place
4,950 feet deep to determine the exact cause of the disaster,
Soviet television reported. Gromov was quoted as telling the
newspaper that the ship's logbook has been recovered along with
many other documents.
   He said it was clear the construction of ``certain life-saving
devices'' on board must be improved, but final conclusions about
what caused the accident and its high death toll will be made by a
government commission.
   Soviet officials say there is no danger of radiation leakage
from the submarine because the crew shut down its reactors and
neither of its torpedoes was armed for combat.
   The submarine's captain, Yevgeny Vanin, pulled a sailor through
a smoke-filled hatch and then died as he struggled to reach his
crew, according to Soviet media reports.
   Some survivors waited for rescue in freezing waters for an hour
and a half. Only 19 of the 42 bodies have been recovered.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said a short circuit probably
caused the fire as the submarine was heading to port after a long
voyage.

<TEXT>
   A bomb exploded this morning in
a van parked outside a border police station, killing a female shop
assistant and injuring at least 30 people, police said.
   At least 24 civilians were hospitalized, some of them with
serious injuries, and six police officers were slightly injured in
the blast in the County Down seaport of Warrenpoint, said Inspector
Fred Campbell of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The town is less
than a mile from Northern Ireland's border with the Irish Republic.
   Police said the bomb went off without warning just before 10
a.m., heavily damaging the police station and nearby buildings in
the town center. The van was parked outside a construction company
yard adjoining the station, and the blast ignited nearby gas
cylinders.
   ``It started a really big fire with thick, black smoke. It was
chaotic for a time,'' said one resident, Philomena Morgan.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack,
but suspicion fell on the Irish Republican Army which has targeted
the security forces in its campaign to drive the British out of
Northern Ireland.
   Gunmen seized the van from a family who were held captive
overnight in their home on the town's outskirts, police said.
   Campbell said the bombing occurred without warning. However,
nine minutes after the explosion, an anonymous caller to a hospital
in nearby Newry warned that a bomb would go off. Several more
warnings were given later, indicating the bomb went off
prematurely, Campbell said.
   Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labor
Party, the mainstream Roman Catholic party, said ``people who carry
out this sort of attack listen to nobody. They simply have a
murderous desire in their hearts to kill.''
   The outlawed IRA is fighting to unite the province, where
Protestants outnumber Catholics 3 to 2, with the predominantly
Catholic Irish Republic.
   The IRA killed 18 British army soldiers in an ambush outside
Warrenpoint on Aug. 27, 1979. On the same day, an IRA bomb killed
India's last viceroy, Lord Louis Mountbatten, aboard his yacht off
the coast of County Sligo in the Republic of Ireland.

   Japan has agreed to allow 40 percent of the work
on a new jet fighter to be done in the United States and has
dropped its resistance to sharing technology from the project, The
New York Times reported today.
   Citing an unidentified Bush administration official, the
newspaper said the concessions signaled that the project would be
sent to Congress shortly.
   The governments reached an agreement in principle last year in
which General Dynamics Corp. would join with Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries to develop and manufacture the plane, to be known as the
FSX, for Fighter Support Experimental.
   The project to build the advanced version of the F-16 had been
stalled for a month because President Bush wanted a clarification
on the final details.
   The official said a few details remain to be worked out,
including the form of the new Japanese commitments, which he said
could take a few more days.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Of Fiji Retiring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUVA, Fiji (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, the
architect of independence in the South Pacific, announced today he
will retire.
   The 68-year-old Mara said he expects to quit politics in
December before Fiji returns to full parliamentary democracy, two
years after the island nation suffered the first of two military
coups.
   He has been dogged by ill-health for the past year and made
several visits to Australia for treatment.
   As befitting his senior chiefly status and 6-foot-6-inch
stature, Mara has wielded immense influence in the region. He is
revered as the elder statesman of the South Pacific and is known as
``the Old Man.''
   He was appointed by Britain to lead Fiji to independence, and
other nations like Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu followed his lead.
Mara leads the Alliance Party and has been prime minister since
1970.
   His rule in the racially divided country was interrupted when
the Indian-backed coalition party of Timoci Bavadra defeated him in
the 1987 general election, which triggered the first of two
military coups.
   Fiji's population of 715,000 is almost evenly divided between
ethnic Melanesian Fijians and Indians, the descendants of
British-indentured sugar plantation laborers.
   Mara's unexpected announcement to a meeting of government
department heads ended speculation he might extend his leadership
of the interim administration formed by coup leader Maj.-Gen.
Sitiveni Rabuka.
   Rabuka said he staged two coups _ in May and September 1987 _ to
protect the political rights of indigenous Fijians against a
growing Indian population. He asked Mara to return as prime
minister while a new constitution is negotiated to enshrine those
rights.
   Mara gave no reason for his retirement. He said simply, ``My
term of office comes to an end in December this year and it is my
intention to retire.''

<TEXT>
   Police today charged a Jewish leader with
manslaughter in the death of an Arab shop owner. Soldiers in the
occupied Gaza Strip reportedly shot and wounded at least six
Palestinians.
   Rabbi Moshe Levinger of the occupied West Bank city of Hebron
was charged with manslaughter, causing bodily harm in aggravated
circumstances and intentionally damaging property, said Justice
Ministry spokeswoman Etty Eshed. If convicted, he faces 20 years in
prison.
   Levinger is accused of killing Kayed Hassan Salah, 42, after a
rock-throwing incident Sept. 30, 1988 in Hebron. According to
prosecutors, Levinger got out of his car, fired in the air with his
pistol, and then shot the shoe shop owner as he stood outside his
store with a customer. The customer was wounded.
   Levinger also allegedly overturned vegetable and fruit carts and
damaged goods inside Hebron stores.
   Levinger, reached by telephone at Beit Romano, a Jewish enclave
in Hebron, said he had not been officially informed of the charges
and had no immediate response.
   The Jerusalem-born Levinger, 54, is known as an extremist leader
of a religious Jewish movement to settle the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   About 70,000 Jewish settlers live in the occupied lands along
with 1.7 million Palestinians. An uprising against Israeli rule,
which began in December 1987, has killed at least 423 Palestinians
and 18 Israelis.
   In Hebron, merchants closed their stores today to protest an
incident Monday in Jerusalem in which a Jewish man fired an Uzi
submachine gun on a group of Arabs. One Arab was killed and three
were wounded, and the killer escaped.
   An anonymous caller claimed responsibility for the attack in the
name of the extremist Sicarites group, named after ancient Jewish
assassins active nearly 2,000 years ago.
   Police today released three Jewish men it detained Tuesday on
suspicion of being linked to the attack, Jerusalem police spokesman
Uzi Sandouri said. He said police distributed a composit drawing of
the main suspect.
   A total of five men, four Jews and one Arab, have been detained
for questioning in connection with the shootings, Jerusalem Police
Chief Yossi Yehudai said. All five have all been freed, he said.
   In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, about 100 Palestinian youths
built barricades and burned tires in narrow streets leading to the
Church of Nativity.
   The masked youths clashed with troops who fired tear gas and
rubber bullets, an Arab reporter said. One woman was injured by a
rubber bullet.
   In the Gaza Strip, soldiers shot and wounded six Palestinians,
five of them teen-agers, Arab hospital officials said. The army
said it was checking the report.
   Also in the occupied territory, the army issued about 200 green
identity cards to Arab activists and former detainees, barring
their entry into Israel, Arab and Israeli reports said.
   Muin Shadid, a 25 year-old Tulkarem journalist who was served
with the new card April 3, said he saw at least 100 such cards at
the military administration headquarters.
   Shadid said an administration officer refused to explain the
move, saying it ``was the decision of senior security officials.''
Shadid said he would complain to the Supreme Court.

   Harris County's Democratic Party has elected a
new chairman to replace a follower of jailed political extremist
Lyndon LaRouche.
   Jack Carter was named Tuesday to succeed Claude Jones, who was
elected in the 1988 primary but removed by Texas Democratic
chairman Bob Slagle earlier this year for allegedly campaigning
against presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   Nearly 300 members of the county Democratic Executive Committee
shouted their votes for Carter, the party secretary. Only a few
people shouted in favor of Jones.
   ``This is totally undemocratic what they are doing here, and
they know it,'' said Jones. ``They are hurting themselves _ not me.
They are hurting the party.''
   He said he will challenge his ouster in court and will recruit
``as many candidates as we can to run in the next election.''
   Jones' election to the post shocked the party leadership. He was
stripped of most of his powers shortly after the election. Slagle
and others wanted him out of office before it was time to raise
money and organize for 1990.
   LaRouche, a frequent presidential candidate, is serving a
15-year sentence for conspiracy and mail fraud in his
organization's solicitation of $34 million in loans. He also was
convicted of conspiring to hide his personal income since 1979.

   Empress Dowager Nagako, Emperor Hirohito's widow,
visited her husband's tomb for the first time today in her first
trip outside the Imperial Palace in nearly seven months, a palace
official said.
   The 86-year-old empress dowager rode in a passenger car from the
Imperial Palace in Tokyo to Hirohito's hillside mausoleum in
Hachioji about 30 miles away. She walked several yards to the tomb
with the help of an aide.
   Emperor Hirohito died of cancer Jan. 7 at age 87. His state
funeral, held Feb. 24 in Tokyo's Shinjuku Gyoen Imperial Gardens,
was attended by more than 10,000 people, including envoys from 164
foreign countries.
   His widow did not attend the ceremonies due to ill health. A hip
problem makes it difficult for her to walk, and she has generally
moved around in a wheelchair for some time.
   Her last trip outside the palace was to an imperial villa in
Tochigi prefecture, northern Japan, last July.
   The imperial family is observing a year of mourning for
Hirohito. In four days, Emperor Akihito, Empress Michiko and other
family members will conduct a ceremony marking the 100th day since
Hirohito's entombment, the palace official said.

   Six Soviet rock musicians asked for
political asylum in Italy just before they were to board a flight
to Moscow, officials said today.
   Dimitri Kusanetsov, 26; Evgeni Arnautov, 31; Valeri Kot, 26;
Sergei Antimonov, 28; Vadim Galitsyn, 25; and Lilia Vinogradova,
21, of the Moscow band Pilgrim arrived in Italy on April 2.
   The group was scheduled to board a return flight to Moscow from
Milan's Malpensa International Airport on Tuesday when its members
approached airport police and requested political asylum.
   They were brought to the Varese police station, which has
jurisdiction over Malpensa airport.
   An official at the police station, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that the reasons for their request could not be
disclosed pending a decision on their case by a special commission
in Rome. He said a decision would probably be reached by the end of
next week.
   The group was invited by the Bergamo merchants association to
perform a series of shows around the city, about 30 miles northeast
of Milan.

   Riverboat gambling fell three votes
short of approval in the state House, but the measure's backers
aren't ready to fold.
   ``We'll take a look at it overnight and talk again,'' said House
Majority Leader Bob Arnould.
   After hours of debate Tuesday, a bill to allow floating casinos
ply the Mississippi River drew 48 votes, less than a majority. The
Senate has narrowly approved the proposal, and Gov. Terry Branstad
has indicated he would sign it.
   Critics worried about organized crime and about compulsive
gamblers losing their grocery money.
   ``I may be able to gamble intelligently, but I have no right to
do that if it's going to cause the people who are weaker to get
caught up in this thing,'' said Rep. Betty Jean Clark.
   Backers said riverboat gambling would be tightly controlled and
would pump $100 million into the state's tourist economy.
Developers have offered to launch floating casinos and build
historical theme parks along the river.
   ``All we are asking is that those of us from my area be given an
opportunity to help ourselves,'' said Rep. Phil Wise of Keokuk.
``Please allow the citizens of the former home of Mark Twain to
capitalize on that.''
   The bill would limit stakes to $5 per bet and impose a $200 loss
limit per excursion.

   ``We don't want policemen to believe that they have to take a
position of: `Don't wait, draw your guns and crash the door, or
your job's on the line,''' the judge said.
   Police Chief Steven Rhoads said Horka, 40, will be back on the
job Monday.
   Though the 12-year-old victim's mother begged police to go
inside, Horka and two other officers waited nearly a half hour
before rescuing the girl.
   Horka, the senior officer at the scene, said he waited for the
landlord to arrive with a key because he feared the girl and her
10-year-old brother might be killed if police forced their way in.
   ``I couldn't have lived with that,'' Horka said. ``No matter
what judgment call you make, the department can say you were wrong.
They weren't there, and I have to live with it.''
   A fourth officer later arrived, entered the apartment through an
unlocked back door and arrested a suspect, who is awaiting trial.
   Horka was dismissed a year ago by the city Fire and Police
Commission. The two other officers were suspended for up to three
weeks.
   ``I think the judge is going to get a lot of heat and rightly
so,'' said Edward T. Stein, a lawyer for the girl's family. ``The
message, that is very dangerous for the public, is: `Who do you
call when you can't call the police?'''
   The girl's family declined comment. The family is suing Horka
and three other officers.
   The judge upheld one charge against Horka _ late filing of a
report _ but noted that the officer could not be fired for such an
infraction. He sent the case back to the commission for
consideration of a lesser penalty.

   A Lebanese Christian security guard at
the U.S. Embassy was found shot to death near the embassy compound
in a suburb north of Beirut today, police reported.
   Elias Haddad, 24, was shot in the head, police said. A police
spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing rules, said a
.38-caliber revolver was found nearby.
   The body was dumped in a building entrance about one mile from
the embassy compound in suburban Aukar, he said.
   The spokesman said an inquiry was launched into the killing.
   A telephone operator at the embassy said no officials were
available to comment.
   The embassy has a Marine guard contingent. However, Lebanese
guards are also hired to help protect the compound from violence in
the country's civil war.
   U.S. officials refuse to say how many Lebanese guards work at
the embassy.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greek employees at U.S. military bases
today began a two-day strike to demand higher pay and improved
fringe benefits.
   Giorgos Alexandrou, U.S. Forces Employees Union president, said
shortly after the strike began that ``it is 100 percent
successful.''
   A spokeswoman for the four U.S. bases, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said no information was immediately available on how
many Greek employees joined the walkout. The union represents about
1,750 workers.
   The union president said employees have not received any
substantial pay increases since 1982 and that the average monthly
salary is $500.
   ``We want increases at the level of other collective wage
agreements in Greece,'' Alexandrou said.
   He gave no percentage increase sought by the union. However,
other collective wage agreements this year have provided for
increases ranging from 4 percent to 15 percent.
   There are two military bases near the Greek capital and two
others on the southern Aegean island of Crete.
   About 500 of 900 Greeks who work at the Hellenikon Air Base next
to Athens International Airport, mounted a protest outside that
base holding banners that read ``No Firings, Permanent Employment,
Higher Wages.''
   The base, which was built in 1947, is the center for U.S.
reconnaissance aircraft monitoring Soviet fleet movements in the
eastern Mediterranean.
   U.S. and Greek officials are discussing renewing the pact on use
of the bases. Premier Andreas Papandreou has said Hellenikon Air
Base will close even if the others remain open.

   The Soviet space station Mir will be unmanned for
the first time in more than two years after three cosmonaunts who
are aboard return home this month, an official report said.
   Tuesday's report by Tass, the official news agency, made no
mention of a previously scheduled launch of two other cosmonauts
April 19. Since Tass said the craft will be unmanned, the new
launch has apparently been called off.
   Tass said the return of Alexander Volkov, Sergei Krikalev and
Valery Polyakov is scheduled for April 27.
   The Mir has been permanently manned since February 1987 when
Yuri Romanenko and Alexander Laveikin boarded the spacecraft.
   Mir was launched into orbit in February 1986. Soviets have said
it is the first part of a permanently manned space station.
   Cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov last Dec. 20 set a
world record for space endurance, living aboard the space station
for 365 days and 22 hours.
   Volkov and Krikalev arrived at the Mir station on Nov. 26 as a
replacement crew for Titov and Manarov. Polyakov, a physician, had
joined the record-breakers in October to monitor their health in
the final months of their year in space.

   A plane loaded with medical supplies
and toys took off for the Dominican Republic today in a charity
drive that began with an appeal for spoons.
   ``It started with 100 spoons and now we're well over 130
boxes,'' John Tomaszewski said Tuesday.
   The Coast Guard C-130 cargo plane left Patrick Henry
International Airport with almost 3,000 pounds of supplies for the
Children's Colony Hospital in Santiago.
   Tomaszewski's wife, Chris, visited the Caribbean nation in
December to return a 3-year-old boy the couple had housed while he
was in the United States for surgery. The Tomaszewskis are foster
parents for Heal The Children, an organization based in Spokane,
Wash., that arranges for Third World children to receive medical
care in this country.
   During her visit, Mrs. Tomaszewski went to the children's
hospital, which was so ill-equipped that patients with severe cuts
had to bring their own thread for stitches.
   ``Instead of my eyes just filling with tears, my heart filled
with `I have to do something,''' Mrs. Tomaszewski said. ``When you
see children hurting or hungry or so sad, it's a human instinct.''
   A nun at the hospital said the children needed metal spoons that
could be sterilized so they wouldn't get sick from eating with
their hands.
   Mrs. Tomaszewski went home with pictures of the hospital and
started asking for help. Individuals and community groups
responded, and the couple's home quickly began filling up with
spoons, baby cribs, linens, an examination table, a microscope,
bandages, stethoscopes, toys, clothes and vitamins.
   ``Everybody was more than eager to help with the spoons. I think
we ended up with 500 spoons along with medical supplies,'' Ms.
Tomaszewski said.
   The supplies eventually were moved to a warehouse at the Coast
Guard Reserve Training Center at Yorktown, where Tomaszewski works
as a quartermaster.
   The Tomaszewskis will travel with the supplies and return a
10-year-old burn victim who has been getting treatment in the
United States. Mrs. Tomaszewski said she has sent a message about
the shipment to the nun, who had been pessimistic that any supplies
would reach the hospital.
   ``We've arranged for the chamber of commerce over there to bring
her to the airport,'' Mrs. Tomaszewski said. ``I know that her eyes
are going to fall out of her head.''

   Masked youths hurled firebombs
into the main trading hall of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange today,
and a similar attack was made against an electronics firm in
Muenster, police said.
   Law enforcement officials said both attacks were apparently
carried out by sympathizers of jailed Red Army Faction terrorists.
   Two employees were slightly injured in the stock exchange
firebombing, which occurred more than an hour before trading was to
begin. Employees grabbed three suspects, Frankfurt police spokesman
Horst Neitzel said.
   Neitzel said two security employees at the stock exchange were
slightly injured when they grabbed two women and a man who
allegedly participated in the 10 a.m. attack, which damaged a
computer and slightly delayed trading. At least three other
attackers escaped, he said.
   In Muenster, police found a note near the scene saying the
attack on the four-story offices of the AEG electronics firm was to
support hunger-striking jailed Red Army members, Neitzel said.
   The 3:30 a.m. firebombing of AEG, a subsidiary of the
Daimler-Benz automotive and high-technology conglomerate, caused
millions of dollars in damage but no injuries, Neitzel said. No
arrests were made immediately, he said.
   At least 34 imprisoned terrorists have joined the fast to demand
a separate cell block for jailed members of the Red Army, a radical
organization that seeks to undermine the West German government
with assassinations, bank robberies and other attacks.
   Government officials have said they are concerned the fasts will
spur further attacks by sympathizers.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., charged today
that House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich improperly used a book
promotional fund to further his ambition for a House GOP leadership
position.
   Alexander, who filed a formal complaint against Gingrich with
the House ethics committee Tuesday, made the accusation against the
Georgia Republican during an appearance on ``CBS This Morning.''
   ``Mr. Gingrich has cooked up a book scheme that has collected
him $105,000 that he has used to travel around the country to
campaign for Republican leader,'' Alexander said. ``He has not
reported it as either'' a contribution or a gift.
   Gingrich said his 1984 book, and the limited partnership set up
to promote it, were legitimite enterprises, unlike House Speaker
Jim Wright's book, ``Reflections of a Public Man,'' which is the
subject of an ethics committee investigation initiated by Gingrich.
   ``We had a real book with a real publisher bought by real
people,'' Gingrich said. ``He had a phony book with a phony
publisher bought by lobbyists.''
   Alexander, in announcing the filing of his ethics complaint
Tuesday, characterized Gingrich as ``a congressional Jimmy Swaggart
who condemns sin while committing hypocrisy.''
   The complaint, which lists 10 alleged violations of House rules,
was filed as the ethics committee neared the conclusion of its
deliberations on whether to bring charges against Wright, D-Texas.
   ``If you have a picnic, flies come to the watermelon,'' Gingrich
said, when asked about the timing of Alexander's complaint. ``We're
in the middle of an exciting period and Mr. Alexander decided this
was the right moment for him to do something.''
   Under House rules, the filing of the complaint will force the
ethics panel, known formally as the Committee on Standards of
Official Conduct, to vote on whether to launch a preliminary
investigation of Gingrich. The chairman and ranking Republican must
place the complaint before the panel within 30 days or it comes up
automatically at the next meeting.
   The complaint centers on a limited partnership created to
promote the book, ``Window of Opportunity,'' a conservative view of
the future written by Gingrich, his wife, Marianne Gingrich, and
David Drake.
   The partnership had 21 investors who put up $5,000 each to
promote the book, in exchange for a promise of half of the profits
that normally would have gone to the publisher. The publisher,
however, lost money on the book and the investors got a tax
writeoff.
   Gingrich, who has denied any wrongdoing with the book deal, said
Tuesday the partnership was his wife's responsibility and ``I don't
have any control over that.''
   But he said he is preparing detailed answers to 40 written
questions about the book deal that have been submitted to his
office by Democratic congressmen and reporters since the existence
of the partnership was disclosed in news reports last month. He did
not say when those answers would be ready.
   Gingrich said his wife, who has acknowledged receiving less than
$10,000 from the partnership for setting up the deal and
coordinating the promotional effort, ``resents the implication'' in
Alexander's complaint that she was used to funnel money to him in
violation of House rules.
   He said she has contacted an attorney to determine if she has
grounds for legal action.
   In addition to the promotional deal, Gingrich said the book
involved a standard royalty contract in which he and his wife each
received 3 percent royalties and Drake 2 percent.
   Alexander said the payments Gingrich characterizes as royalties
do not fit the definition in House rules because of the unique
promotional deal associated with the book. Consequently, he argued,
those payments are not exempt from the House rule limiting outside
earned income, as royalties are.
   Alexander also alleged that the promotional deal amounted to
four apparent violations of House limitations on gifts, one
instance of possible conversion of campaign funds to personal use,
two possible instances of conversion of government resources to
personal use, one apparent violation of House financial disclosure
rules and one apparent violation of the campaign finance law.

<TEXT>
   A jury considering the bribery case
against three California executives charged in the Pentagon
corruption case resumed deliberations today after failing to reach
a verdict in two days.
   The four women and eight men informed U.S. District Judge
Richard Williams late Tuesday that they had not come to a decision
after a total of 20 hours of deliberations.
   Williams said he would give the jury new instructions today if
they were having problems with the charges.
   Dale Schnittjer, Eugene Sullivan and George Kaub, three former
vice presidents of Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif.,
are charged with bribery, conspiracy and wire fraud in the first
case brought to trial since the government ``Ill Wind''
investigation into fraud and kickbacks at the Pentagon began nearly
three years ago.
   Kaub is also charged with two counts of filing false statements.
   The case involves what prosecutors say was a conspiracy to bribe
a Navy official for information about a $24 million contract that
Teledyne obtained in July 1987 to build hand-held radar test sets.
   The government claims the defendants knew that William Parkin, a
private consultant hired by Teledyne Electronics, was paying bribes
to Stuart Berlin, the Navy official.
   Both Parkin and Berlin, as well as Teledyne Industries, the
parent of Teledyne Electronics, have pleaded guilty in the case and
are cooperating with government.
   But the defendants said they didn't know Parkin had done
anything illegal.
   Kaub, Schnittjer and Sullivan testified Parkin was hired for
$10,000 for his expertise in November 1985.
   He was promised $150,000 if Teledyne won the radar contract,
which it did. Parkin was paid about $18,000 before the payments
stopped when the Ill Wind case was made public.

<HEAD>Doctor Suspended At Austrian Hospital Where Patients Killed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City authorities today suspended the
director of the hospital department where four assistant nurses
have confessed to killing at least 49 patients in the past six
years.
   The suspension followed mounting criticism of the chief doctor's
conduct during a police investigation last year at Vienna's Lainz
hospital, where elderly patients reportedly were killed by
overdoses of medicine or by forcing water into their lungs. Senior
police investigator Max Edelbacher said Monday that police met ``a
wall of silence'' at the hospital during the probe.
   A police report says the department head, Dr. Franz Pesendorfer
had declined to give police the name of a second doctor, who
alerted Pesendorfer to suspicions about the killings after talking
with a Chilean-born nurse's assistant.
   The four assistant nurses claim they engaged in ``mercy
killings,'' but police said the methods they used made that motive
unlikely.
   The Neue Kronen Zeitung, Austria's largest circulation tabloid,
said today that if Pesendorfer and the second doctor ``had not kept
quiet, it would fairly certainly have been possible to stop the
series of murders a year ago.
   ``As it was, however, the sadistic nurses could kill another 22
people,'' the newspaper added. Police have not confirmed media
reports that 22 of the 49 people killed were slain in the last year
alone.
   Mayor Helmut Zilk said he was suspending Pesendorfer, head of
the first medical department at Lainz hospital, ``on the grounds of
the results to date of the police investigations.'' He declined
further comment.
   Alois Stacher, chief of the city's health department, said
Pesendorfer was suspended because of ``lingering lack of clarity''
over the investigation.
   Pesendorfer consistently has defended his role in the
investigation and the conduct of officials in his department at the
Lainz hospital, Vienna's fourth largest, since the first word of
the killings on Friday.
   The doctor and other hospital officials declined comment today.
   The Chilean-born nurse's assistant, Dorah Eugenie
Ferrada-Avendano, was questioned by police Tuesday and arrested
after she admitted to witnessing one of the killings, Edelbacher
said. But he told The Associated Press he would try to free the
woman because ``she has really helped the police.''
   Ms. Ferrada-Avendano knew of killings at the hospital two or
three years before she told the unidentified doctor of her
suspicions last year, Edelbacher said on television Tuesday.
   He described her as a single parent who as a foreigner was
afraid of losing her job if she went to police. A former patient at
the hospital who knows the woman, now an Austrian citizen, told The
Associated Press she feared political persecution if forced to
return to Chile.
   Assistant nurses Maria Gruber, 25, Irene Leidorf, 27, and
Waltraud Wagner, 30, have been in custody since Friday. Stephanie
Mayer was detained Sunday. None of the women has been charged.
Police said the four women confessed they killed at least 49
patients and that Ms. Wagner admitted killing 39 of them.
   Pesendorfer is the first doctor or official suspended because of
the mass killings.

   Temperatures plunged to record lows across the Southeast today
for the second day in a row, dropping below freezing as far south
as the central Gulf states and damaging fruit crops in Tennessee
and Alabama.
   Low temperature records were tied or broken at more than 20
cities from Texas to Virginia, including 15 degrees at Elkins,
W.Va.; 32 at Augusta, Ga.; 34 at Huntsville, Ala.; 41 at
Jacksonville, Fla.; 40 at New Orleans; 55 at Galveston, Texas, and
24 at Roanoke, Va.
   In Tennessee, peaches, plums and strawberries were the hardest
hit as the cold snap that sent temperatures below freezing Monday
night showed few signs of letting up. Lows in the state this
morning included 25 at Chattanooga, 25 at Bristol and 26 at
Knoxville, all records.
   ``I feel like probably 90 percent of what I looked at were
gone,'' said Tom Oswalt, an assistant agent with the Agricultural
Extension Service in Shelby County, after inspecting a plum orchard
Tuesday.
   ``These plums were anywhere from a quarter inch to a half inch
and they were ice all the way to the middle. You could mush them up
and they were just like crushed ice.''
   In northern and central Alabama, damage was reported to
blueberries, strawberries and peaches.
   Elsewhere, a cold front extending from the upper Great Lakes
across the central Plains and southern Colorado produced widely
scattered showers, mainly in Texas and Oklahoma. A few showers also
dampened parts of Florida.
   Today's forecast called for snow and rain scattered across the
eastern half of the Great Lakes; rain over the upper Ohio Valley;
and showers and thunderstorms in southern Florida and western parts
of the southern Plains.
   Highs were expected to be in the 30s over Upper Michigan; in the
40s from the upper Mississippi Valley to New England; in the 70s
and 80s in southern Texas, the Florida Peninsula, and parts of
Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada and Arizona; in the 90s over
the Desert Southwest; and in the 50s and 60s elsewhere.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 17 degrees at
International Falls, Minn., to 77 degrees at Phoenix and Glendale,
Ariz., and Blythe, Calif.

   A Namibian guerrilla leader today
rejected South Africa's plan to interrogate insurgents who report
to U.N. peacekeepers to be escorted back to bases in Angola.
   By midday today, territorial police said no guerrillas of the
South-West Africa People's Organization had shown up at any of nine
checkpoints established Tuesday by the U.N. force monitoring
Namibia's transition to independence.
   ``It is not the business of South Africa to interrogate or check
SWAPO cadres. It the business of UNTAG and UNTAG alone,'' guerrilla
official Kapuka Nauyala said today of the U.N. Transition
Assistance Group.
   Sam Nujoma, SWAPO's exiled president, has called on his fighters
to withdraw as part of an agreement to get the U.N. independence
plan back on track after heavy fighting last week.
   South Africa says about 1,900 guerrillas infiltrated into
northern Namibia starting April 1, the day a cease-fire was to take
hold. U.N. investigators agree the guerrillas violated a peace
accord requiring they stay in Angolan bases at least until May 15.
   Territorial officials said Tuesday the United Nations had agreed
that police supervised by U.N. peacekeepers could interrogate
guerrillas who report to the checkpoints about the whereabouts of
other insurgents and possible arms caches.
   But a U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, no such
agreement was reached.
   Nauyala, SWAPO's chief representative in Zimbabwe, said any
questioning by security forces would be unacceptable.
   ``UNTAG will commit a monumental sin if it allows itself to be
co-opted into South Africa's campaign aimed at discrediting and
humiliating SWAPO and its military cadres,'' Nauyala told the
Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency.
   Black African nations last week denounced the special U.N. envoy
to Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, who outraged them by allowing South
Africa-led security forces out of bases to fight the guerrilla
incursion.
   White security force officers and Namibian civilians who support
SWAPO predict few guerrillas will report to the checkpoints. They
cite the deployment of security force personnel at the points, the
proximity of military bases, and poor communication between
guerrilla commanders and their forces.
   Police said some guerrillas might try to cross into Angola
without reporting to checkpoints and others might hide their
weapons, don civilian clothes and try to stay in Namibia.
   Police Chief Inspector Derrick Brune said groups of insurgents
were seen today moving south, away from the Angola border.
   No major skirmishes have been reported since last weekend. South
Africa says 263 guerrillas and 27 security force members were
killed in fighting that erupted April 1. SWAPO says 38 of its
fighters and 54 civilians were killed. Another 15 guerrillas were
captured.
   South Africa has ruled the mineral-rich territory north of its
border since World War I and in defiance of U.N. demands it
withdraw.
   In December, Pretoria agreed to give Namibia independence in
exchange for Cuba withdrawing its 50,000 troops from Angola, where
they supported the Marxist government's forces in a civil war
against rebels backed by South Africa.
   SWAPO has been fighting South African rule since 1966.

   Christian and Moslem forces fired
artillery shells at each others' strongholds in Beirut and nearby
mountains today, and police said the barrage killed four people and
wounded 17.
   Motorists sped away after a shell slammed into a seaside
boulevard near fish restaurants in Moslem west Beirut's Raouche
district.
   French Ambassador Paul Blanc told reporters a shell hit the
French Embassy compound in the Christian Hazmiyeh suburb, causing
damage but no injuries.
   Christian and Moslem forces accused each other of ordering
gunners to target residential districts of Beirut.
   Counting today's casualties, 184 people have died and 636 have
been wounded since the latest round of fighting in the civil war
began March 8 between Gen. Michel Aoun's mostly Christian army and
an alliance of Syrian and Druse forces.
   Also today, a Lebanese Christian security guard at the U.S.
Embassy was found dead from a shot to the head, police reported.
   They said they are investigating the death of Elias Haddad, 24,
whose body was found in a building entrance about a mile from
embassy compound in northern Beirut's Aukar suburb. Lebanese guards
support the embassy's Marine contingent.
   In Kuwait, a group of right-wing Christian politicians met with
Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, head of a
six-member Arab League panel. The politicians, led by Phalange
Party leader George Saadeh, discussed ways of ending Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war. The panel, formed in January, already has
met with Lebanese Moslem and religious leaders.
   The Christian Voice of Lebanon radio said Syrian gunners
provoked today's artillery barrage by shelling several areas in the
310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of Beirut.
   The Moslem-run Voice of the Nation blamed the escalation on
Christian gunners and said they were targeting the Raouche district.
   Civilians rushed back in to bunkers and underground bomb
shelters. Shopkeepers lowered their shutters, and employees ran out
of their offices as the thud of exploding shells rocked the city.
   Last week, Syrian rockets set fire to a depot containing nearly
two-thirds of Lebanon's fuel reserves. The resulting fuel shortage
has reduced power supplies in some areas to one hour a day.
   The worst fighting in four years started after Aoun, who also
heads the Christian military Cabinet in Lebanon's divided
government, ordered a blockade of ports run by Moslem militias. He
said the illegally operated ports were costing the state treasury
$100 million in lost import dues.
   In retaliation, Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive
Socialist Party militia shelled Beirut port and the Christian
enclave.
   Later, Syrian gunners joined in the shelling and supported a
land blockade of the Christian heartland by Moslem troops of Maj.
Gen. Sami Khatib.
   The rival Christian and Moslem governments emerged Sept. 22,
when outgoing President Amin Gemayel appointed Aoun, a Maronite
Catholic like him, to head an interim military Cabinet pending
parliament's election of a new head of state.
   Pro-Syrian Moslems rejected Aoun's appointment, which violated a
45-year-old tradition that gave the premiership to the Sunni
Moslems, the house speakership to the Shiite Moslems and the
presidency to the Maronites.
   The division threatens Lebanon with permanent, sectarian
partition.

   Police have arrested a man suspected of
killing nine transients in a series of shootings that have
terrorized the city of Guadalajara, the government news agency
Notimex reported.
   The arrest Tuesday capped an investigation involving thousands
of federal and state police who searched the city looking for the
killer.
   Authorities dubbed the killer the ``Maniac 7.65'' after the type
of pistol used in the killings, which all occurred on the city's
streets.
   After slaying one transient, the assailant wrote ``He's dead''
on the pavement and drew an arrow pointing toward the body.
   Police said they knew of no motive for the killings.
   Notimex, citing a police statement, said Jalisco state police
arrested Mario Perez, 35, in a Guadalajara hotel late Tuesday.
   Police seized a car belonging to Perez, which they said had
recently been painted a different color in an attempt to elude
authorities, Notimex said. They also seized the pistol they believe
was used in the killings.
   Authorities told Notimex they suspect Perez is the serial killer.

   A 34-year-old man stabbed to death a family
of four, including two toddlers and an expectant mother, police
said today.
   Newton Carlton Slawson of Plant City was arrested and charged
with murder, manslaughter and attempted murder before the mother
died at a hospital this morning, said police spokesman Steve Cole.
The charges were expected to be updated with her death.
   Peggy Williams Wood, 21, had been eight months pregnant; the
fetus died at the time of the slayings, police said.
   ``No clear-cut motive has been established,'' Cole said.
   ``Apparently he knows the family and has visited them before,''
the spokesman said.
   Police found the bodies of Gerald A. Wood, 23, his daughter
Jennifer, 4, and son, Glendon, 3, at their apartment Tuesday night,
Cole said.
   ``The mother was able to crawl down a back staircase and next
door to a relative's home to summon help. She had been stabbed and
was bleeding severely,'' Cole said.
   A description of a car seen leaving the scene was broadcast on
police radio, and an officer finishing an off-duty job at a food
store spotted it 45 minutes after the killings and arrested
Slawson, Cole said.

<HEAD>Democratic Party Chairman Rejects Prospect of Fresh Revision of Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Democratic Party
emphatically rejected today the prospect of a fresh revision of the
party's rules governing its presidential nominating process.
   ``I have absolutely no intention to appoint, empower or create
any kind of rules commission,'' said Ronald H. Brown.
   The party chairman made the statement during a news conference
at which he announced appointment of party senior staff.
   Several party activists, including Robert Beckel, who was Walter
Mondale's campaign manager in his 1984 presidential try, have
proposed taking a new look at party rules.
   While rejecting such suggestions, Brown said he would support
one change: to restore the status of Democratic National Committee
members as so-called super delegates at the next convention. Super
Delegates are party and elected officials who go to the convention
uncommitted to any presidential candidate and have the potential
for breaking any deadlock.
   At the 1988 convention, the DNC members lost their automatic
super delegate status to meet a demand from Jesse Jackson.
   Named senior adviser to the Democratic National Committee was
Jack Martin, a Texan who ran Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's last two
re-election campaigns.
   The new political director of the DNC will be Paul Tully, who
has close ties to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and who also
worked on the presidential campaigns of Walter F. Mondale, Gary
Hart and Michael Dukakis.
   Named director of finance was Melissa Moss, who has been
principal fund raiser for the Democratic Leadership Council, a
group of elected officials who banded together in 1985 to counter
what they believed was the leftward drift of the national party.
   Continuing as communications director will be Michael McCurry.
   In rejecting the idea of another revision of the party's rules,
Brown said, ``We don't win or lose election because of rules. ... I
frankly think if would be foolhardy for this party to spend the
next two years in a bloody and divisive fight over the rules.''
   After presidential election defeats in 1968, 1972 and 1980, the
Democrats engaged in sweeping revisions of the party rules. Adfter
the 1984 defeat, the party went through a more modest change.

   Hope turned to horror in a small Texas
town where residents had been raising money to help a family find
their missing 21-year-old son.
   News of the discovery of the body of Mark Kilroy, with at least
11 others slain in apparent satanic rituals on a ranch in Mexico,
quickly spread through the town about 30 miles south of Houston.
Kilroy disappeared a month ago.
   ``It's like a nightmare,'' said Mary delaHoussaye, a close
friend of Kilroy's mother, Helen. ``I really can't believe it.
Helen and I said it over and over that we just want to wake up and
not believe that it's true.''
   Doris Williams, a clerk at a convenience store, said: ``Even
though it had been almost a month, everyone was really hoping he'd
still be alive. Everybody's heart is going out to that family.''
   Cheryl Gautier, who was dining Tuesday at the Busy Bee Cafe,
said: ``Most people felt that when they found him, he'd be dead.
But I didn't want to discourage anyone from thinking otherwise. I
thought he'd be dead, probably shot, but the manner in which he was
killed is unreal.''
   Santa Fe residents have been donating their time and money to
help Mrs. Kilroy and her husband, James, search for their son.
   Last weekend, proceeds from a citywide garage sale and carwash
went toward a fund set up for the Kilroys.
   A yellow ribbon ceremony had been scheduled for today to draw
attention to Kilroy's disappearance. The ceremony was being turned
into a memorial service.
   ``This little town is real supportive. We're like a big
family,'' Joe Nichols, state prison guard, said of the community of
5,400. ``They may not know you, but they support you.''
   ``It's nice to see Santa Fe help each other, to get money for
his parents to go down there and try to find him. It's nice,'' said
Victor LaPoint, a cashier at the Busy Bee Cafe.
   Since Kilroy's disappearance during a spring break excursion,
the family had distributed about 20,000 fliers in Brownsville and
Matamoros as well as appealing to state lawmakers to help with the
search.
   Law officers on both sides of the border had been stumped by the
disappearance, with no clues despite an intensive search, the
questioning of nearly 100 people and a $15,000 reward.
   Kilroy's disappearance also was re-enacted for a segment on the
Fox television network's ``America's Most Wanted'' program.
   The mother of Bill Huddleston, one of the students with Kilroy
the night he vanished, took the Kilroys from their Santa Fe home to
the airport Tuesday for the trip to Brownsville, near the Mexican
town where the bodies were found.
   ``Helen (Kilroy) of course is very upset after finding out the
news that it really was Mark down there,'' Gwen Huddleston said.
``They went down there in hopes that it wouldn't be, but it didn't
turn out that way.''

throughout the nation.

   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on the Alaska oil spill:
   Beaches near the polluted port town of Valdez, Alaska, smell
like gas stations, residents there report.
   Oil along the shoreline is so thick in some areas that cleanup
workers often slip and fall. They wear hard hats to protect
themselves.
   The more that Americans find out about the largest oil spill in
U.S. history, the more outrageous the tragedy becomes.
   The spill will not _ and should not _ fade quickly into the
nation's memory. Regulatory changes are in order.
   National and state governments must make the cost of damaging
the environment high enough to force the oil and shipping
industries to act more responsibly. Promises are not enough.

   The News Tribune, Woodbridge, N.J., on banning Atlantic Ocean
oil drilling:
   U.S. Rep Jim Courter, R-N.J., has authored a bill which calls
for a 10-year moratorium on exploratory drilling in the Atlantic
Ocean. In the wake of the Exxon Valdez (oil spill off Alaska), our
support of his bill is stronger than ever.
   The mind boggles over the possible effect of a major spill off
the heavily populated East Coast.
   The oil industry can counter with a strong argument. If we kiss
the domestic exploration goodbye, then it's only a matter of time
before the domestic supply dries up and reliance on foreign
suppliers grows.
   We are going to have to continue drilling as long as we rely
heavily on fossil fuels for energy, and remain a nation of energy
gluttons.
   What the Exxon Valdez disaster must do is increase our
determination to seek alternative sources, such as solar, grain
alcohols and nuclear. And we must pursue that dream of all dreams _
fusion.

   The News and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on the Teamsters union:
   There is good news and bad news in the Justice Department's
recent settlement of a lawsuit against the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters. It will not guarantee that the world's
largest labor union will be corruption-free, but it does promise a
long-overdue cleanup.
   The 1.6 million-member Teamsters union has agreed to some
fundamental reforms to avoid a federal racketeering trial that
could have led to a government takeover. It has also agreed that
rank-and-file union members would, for the first time, be allowed
to vote in elections of top-ranking union leaders.
   Members will nominate and elect union officials who heretofore
have been hand-picked by the executive council, and a
court-appointed administrator armed with special authority should
give a modicum of credibility to a new Teamster era.
   The deal, however, is not without serious shortcomings. The
union's old guard, which has become synonomous with organized
crime, remains in place. ...
   It's a new and long journey toward democracy the teamsters have
embarked upon, and the out-of-court settlement with the Justice
Department is only the first tentative step.

   The Duluth (Minn.) News-Tribune on President Bush's education
proposals:
   President ... Bush's proposals for education might be considered
too modest by his political opponents and too varied by those who
can only see education dollars in terms of teacher salaries, but
the program he outlined (last) week represents a solid, progressive
start in improving American education.
   It is positively radical compared with his predecessor's
inclinations for federal education programs.
   (Bush) wants to spend $423 million on such things as grants for
successful schools, scholarships for students who excel in math and
science, and funding of magnet schools to expand parental choice.
   Other efforts would put more non-teachers in classrooms, set up
anti-drug programs, reward excellent teachers and help black
colleges build up endowments.
   Nothing is settled at this point. The funding will no doubt
undergo changes as Congress deliberates these and other measures,
but, given the constraints imposed by deficits, there is every
reason to be optimistic about Bush's plans for education.

   The Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette on the Alaska oil spill:
   Exxon's Alaska oil spill shows dramatically that giant
corporations with high-priced executives and state-of-the-art
equipment can perform at the moron level.
   The captain of the Exxon Valdez boarded his craft drunk and
allowed an unqualified, unlicensed third mate to pilot the vessel.
The mate bungled the simple task of steering a straight path
through a placid channel 10 miles wide, hitting first one rock,
then proceeding to hit another.
   The hull ruptured, releasing 11 million gallons of oil. That
would not have been a problem on many carriers. They have a second
hull to catch or limit a spill. But the Exxon Valdez didn't have
such a protective inner shell.
   Exxon leaders at first denied any major responsiblity. ... Exxon
leaders finally apologized 10 days later. By that time, the spill
had spread to an area larger than Rhode Island and had fouled more
than 800 miles of beaches.
   There is plenty of blame to go around. Guilty parties, however,
are unlikely ever to be prosecuted to the extent they have fouled,
polluted and upset nature's balance in a unique region of America.

   The Arizona Republic, Phoenix, on capturing drug smugglers:
   Blame it on the heat. Blame it on spring fever. Blame it on
UFOs. Blame it on, well, take your pick.
   How else to explain the zany plan that calls for dressing up
Texas National Guardsmen as cacti so that they could sneak up on
drug smugglers under the cover of darkness, and a mantle of thorns,
to gather intelligence for federal authorities waiting to swoop
down ... on the evil-doers.
   The proposal, according to Texas National Guard Lt. Col. Ed
Komandosky, envisions cactus-attired troops working areas of
suspected drug smuggling along the U.S.-Mexico border. ...
   It is a cockamamie idea. ... In the first place, the Guard
should not be enlisted in the war on drugs. Guardsmen are not
trained as policemen.
   Secondly, it casts Guardsmen in the role of stand-up comedians
or cartoon characters. ...
   Finally, it would not work. Does the brain trust responsible for
this silly idea really think that drug runners are so easily
fooled? ...
   Alerted to the Guard's trickery by the advance publicity,
smugglers scarcely would wait for the cactus-clad Guardsmen to make
the first move. Instead, the drug runners would plug every cactus
in sight full of lead.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on financing congressional election
campaigns:
   There's nothing new about indignant cries that the method of
financing congressional election campaigns has ... to be improved.
   The latest compilation of data by Common Cause provides fresh
reason to demand reform even more urgently.
   William Proxmire, who recently retired after serving for a long
time as a senator from Wisconsin ... acted as a kind of
self-appointed watchdog over public spending and long opposed
reliance on the political action committee for major campaign
funding.
   In the last election, candidates for a seat in the House of
Representatives accepted a record $99.6 million from PACs. ... The
bulk of it went to incumbents seeking re-election. There were 408
of them, and they got $82.2 million from the PACs. The 328
challengers in contrast received only $9 million.
   When a PAC contributes heavily to a candidate's war chest, there
is at very least an unspoken quid pro quo. We must change the
system to minimize that influence-buying factor.

   The Daily News, Longview, Wash., on the internment of
Japanese-Americans: The Bush administration and Congress have to
hold down spending. But that can't justify the level of spending
President Bush has recommended on the nation's debt to
Japanese-Americans who were interned in camps during World War II.
   Congress and former President Reagan agreed that $500 million
should be appropriated this next fiscal year to begin paying
reparations to these citizens who were forced from their homes
during the war. Bush has proposed a $20 million appropriation.
   That's both tragic and ridiculous. It's tragic because the
survivors of these camps are dying now at the rate of about 200 a
month. It's ridiculous because at the rate of Bush's proposal, it
would take 60 years to complete the reparation payments.

   Los Angeles Times on the pro-choice abortion rally:
   At least 300,000 people marched in Washington Sunday to leave a
message for the U.S. Supreme Court. ...
   Whether the court reads such messages is a matter of debate
among legal scholars, but the crowd of men, mothers and daughters,
celebrities and ordinary believers in the cause could not have made
a more coherent statement, one with which we absolutely agree:
Government has no right to pry into a decision as deeply personal,
private and agonizing as the one that every year leads 1.6 million
women to have abortions.
   The march, the largest ever seen in the capital, was timed to
catch the court's attention as it near the April 26 date for
argument in a Missouri abortion case. The court is being asked by
anti-abortion forces to use the Missouri case as a vehicle to
reverse the 1973 decision in the case of Roe vs. Wade that made
abortion legal under federal law. ...
   The march also was intended as a reminder that abortion is a
powerful symbol of the rights of women, even the many who oppose
abortion, because it involves decisions they are determined to make
for themselves about their health and the life they will lead. ...
   The court must look beyond legal principles to tenable social
policy and good sense, and both dictate that the right of a woman
to choose to terminate a pregnancy meets both of those tests.

   The Patriot, Harrisburg, Pa., on the Soviet elections:
   The recent voting for members to the Congress of the People's
Deputies was the first relatively open election held in the Soviet
Union in 70 years.
   And remarkable as it may seem, given our far greater experience
at democracy, the Soviet election may have something instructive to
offer the American political system.
   Whether the elected People's Deputies get to exercise any degree
of power remains to be seen. Nevertheless, the stunning number of
high and mighty who were defeated dealt what The New York Times
headlined was ``a mortifying blow to party officials.''
   The magnitude of the revolt was made extraordinary by the
substantial number of candidates who were defeated even though they
ran without opposition. Voters were able to cross out the name of
unopposed candidates and thus register a ``no'' vote.
   If Americans could vote ``none of the above'' or against an
unopposed candidate, we suspect many more would go to the polls.
   The question is: Would our politicians dare to give the people
the option of voting for none of the above?

   Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, Tupelo, Miss., on Polish
elections:
   The march of democracy continues. It's enough to make Vladamir
Lenin ... spin his tomb.
   Poland (has) announced ... that the government and the outlawed
labor union Solidarity have reached an accord that will make free
elections possible again. Poles have not voted in democratic
elections since 1945.
   The first ballot this year is guaranteed to give the Communist
Party almost a two-thirds majority, but the agreement throws the
electoral process wide open in subsequent elections.
   Few people besides the democrats in Poland, like Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa, thought this day would come.
   But it's also true that few people, at least in the West,
thought they ever would see Russians able to vote for anything that
resembles a democratic ballot. Soviets, some of them within sight
of Lenin's tomb in Moscow, voted in open elections three weeks ago.
   The West, led by the United States, can't be a Pollyana in the
face of rapid changes. But neither can any peace-loving Western
nation overlook opportunities to defuse world tensions and make
additional democratic reforms attractive to the East.

   Corvallis (Ore.) Gazette-Times on drift-net fishing:
   There's good reason for calling drift-net fishing ``strip mining
of the sea.''
   An Asian fleet of 1,000 to 1,500 vessels deploys as many as
30,000 miles of drift net each day. Floating 30 feet down from the
ocean surface, the fine-meshed nylon nets catch not only fish and
squid, but everything else they encounter _ dolphins, whales, birds
and sea lions.
   Perhaps even worse, the nets are inefficient, wasting about half
the catch that is killed but then lost overboard. ...
   Under the Drift Net Impact Monitoring Assessment and Control Act
of 1987, the United States has been negotiating with Japan, South
Korea and Taiwan to place observers on their ships to determine
just how damaging drift-net fishing is. ...

<HEAD>South Florida Blanketed In Thick Smoke</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The smoke blanketing South Florida lifted early
today as breezes moved in from the northeast. Rain helped
firefighters battle the brush fires that have burned 27,000 acres
in the Everglades.
   The clearing allowed the return of nearly 750 illegal immigrants
who had been evacuated Tuesday from a detention center less than a
mile from one of the two major fires.
   Firefighters contained one blaze that burned about 11,000 acres
west of the Florida Turnpike in Dade County.
   Seb Farina, a spokesman for the state Division of Forestry, said
a cold front was bringing northeast winds to clear the air.
   ``Smoke problems should be eased through the day,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, smoke cloaked the area from the edge of the bone-dry
Everglades to downtown Miami. Visibility was less than a quarter
mile on many roads.
   Coughing residents fled indoors. Health officials warned
residents to stay indoors and turn on their air conditioners.
   ``I came here for sun and I got smoke _ figure that out,'' said
Albert Smith, a tourist from Minneapolis, as he squinted into the
haze Tuesday.
   Brush fires are common in Florida in the spring, but an
unusually dry winter has spawned more of them this year.
   Evening sea breezes temporarily thinned the smoke cover, and
scattered thundershowers appeared Tuesday evening in western Dade,
where the fires caused the worst damage.
   Firefighters made progress overnight against a 15,000-acre blaze
straddling the Tamiami Trail, Florida's southernmost east-west
cross-state road, Farina said.
   INS district director Perry Rivkind had ordered 745 illegal
aliens moved to a baseball stadium in Miami and was planning to
send them to a Port Isabel, Texas, immigration camp if the smoke
hadn't cleared today.
   Some senior citizens who woke up coughing were alarmed, hospital
officials said.
   ``Fear becomes an integral part of the problem for us. They
panic and call rescue,'' said Dr. John Davison.

<HEAD>Eds: Adds 1 graf at end to say British Airways checked its Concordes
for structural flaws earlier this year. No pickup.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Concorde jet with 100 Americans
aboard lost a nine-foot piece of its tail today while attempting
the aircraft's first supersonic circumnavigation of the globe, but
it landed safely in Sydney.
   ``It wasn't till we got out of the plane and saw the firetrucks
and all the press...that we knew something was wrong,'' said
American journalist William Buckley Jr., who helped organize the
trip, which cost each passenger $39,000.
   Part of the rudder disintegrated while the British Airways
supersonic jet was flying at 40,000 feet at about 1,500 mph _
nearly twice the speed of sound _ from Christchurch, New Zealand,
said Peter Stanton, an airline spokesman.
   ``It experienced a shudder while over the Tasman Sea that was
thought to have been air turbulence,'' said Stanton.
   He said the pilot was unaware of any problem until he was
alerted by the control tower at Sydney's Kingsford-Smith
International Airport.
   But another passenger on the 1,000-mile flight, which lasted one
hour and 25 minutes, said the plane shuddered and the passengers
were tense.
   Buckley said, ``There is a possibility they (British Airways)
will find a defect ... that will result in the grounding of other
Concordes. But obviously they're hoping that won't be so, that this
is simply an eccentric fluke.''
   ``It was a normal landing, there was no emergency,'' Stanton
said. ``The pilot, Capt. David Leney, was told by the control tower
that a piece of the tail was missing.'' There were no injuries
among the 100 passengers, all Americans, on the 38,343-mile journey
that started April 1 in London.
   Pat Boody, a British Airways airport service manager, said the
cause of the tail problem was being investigated and that the plane
would not be allowed to fly ``unless it is absolutely safe.''
   Australian Associated Press said the Concorde was about 15 years
old and apparently had never experienced any problems.
   ``I'm glad that it was a plane that could manage without that
much superfluous tail,'' said Buckley.
   ``If we had nosedived...into the Tasmanian Sea, there would have
been a considerable reaction. But one simply assumes that nothing
fatal has happened if indeed there is no confirmation nor any
visible invalidation of the ship's performance,'' he said.
   In London, a British Airways spokeswoman said the airline was
sending out spare parts to Australia to repair the plane, which
would go on to Perth, Australia on Friday as scheduled and then to
Africa before returning to London. Another spokesman said the tail
sections of other Concordes were being checked.
   The Concorde had been trying to break the speed record on all
stops, making about 12 in all. The planned three-week journey
includes stops in exotic locations like Colombo, Sri Lanka and
Mombassa, Kenya.
   During the trip, Buckley planned to broadcast his television
show ``Firing Line'' from Cape Town, South Africa, and Sydney.
   Passenger Sheila Cole Nilva, a freelance journalist, telephoned
The Associated Press with the following account:
   ``About 25 minutes after takeoff from New Zealand there was a
large thump. It was like a vibration. Nothing was said about the
thump but everybody looked at everybody else and lunch was served.
The stewardesses looked terrified.
   ``The pilot came on and said there was nothing to worry about
and that there was a piece loose on the airplane,'' she said. ``We
descended very quickly. There was no conversation and then the
shuddering stopped.''
   Concordes, built by a French-British consortium, have been
involved in several minor incidents, but there have been no major
accidents.
   In February, British Airways gave its fleet of Concorde jets a
clean bill of health after safety checks following the discovery of
small cracks in the roof structure of one plane. The airline made
what it called precautionary checks on five Concordes that had made
more than 3,500 landings.

   Federal immigration officials won't
appeal an immigration judge's decision to allow a Dutch visitor
with AIDS to travel, a department spokesman said.
   Hans Paul Verhoef, 31, was on his way to an AIDS conference in
San Francisco when he was taken into custody April 2 at
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport after telling
authorities he had AIDS.
   The INS said Verhoef's travel violated a 1951 law prohibiting
people with contagious diseases from entering the United States.
Congress added AIDS to the list in 1987.
   On Friday, federal immigration officials in Washington, D.C.,
refused Verhoef's request for an exemption so he could attend the
conference. But a federal immigration judge overruled the
department and permitted Verhoef to leave Oak Park Heights state
prison for three weeks of travel.
   Verhoef's imprisonment sparked international criticism,
including appeals for his release from U.S. congressional leaders,
members of Dutch Parliament, gay rights activists and Minnesota
health officials.

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo said Wednesday
that labor unrest has cost South Korea $600 million in exports this
year and threatens to destroy the nation's economic achievements.
   ``Our economy now stands at the crossroads,'' Roh told a meeting
of top economic officials and business leaders. In addition to the
lost exports, labor problems have resulted in a drop in the
country's production of $2.4 billion, he said.
   There have been 395 labor disputes in South Korea this year, up
27 percent from a year ago, and 282 cases have been settled,
according to the Labor Ministry.
   In the past, South Korean workers' rights were curbed by
authoritarian rule, but a pro-democracy movement in the past two
years has encouraged workers to demand more.
   Roh said exports have been sluggish after years of high growth
and that investment has been shrinking because of labor disputes,
coupled with the rising value of the Korean won. A strong won makes
Korean exports to the U.S. more expensive.
   Korea also is under U.S. pressure to open wider its market to
American products and services.
   Last month, South Korea suffered its first trade deficit in 19
months.
   Roh urged labor and management to refrain from confrontation in
seeking to settle their disputes.
   The Federation of Korean Industries and five other national
economic organizations, in a joint statement, said labor disputes
should be settled through dialogue and reconciliation.
   On March 30, about 14,000 police stormed the Hyundai shipyard in
the southeastern city of Ulsan to break a 109-day strike by
thousands of workers, allegedly supported by outsiders, who had
staged a sit-in.
   No settlement has been reached yet with management.
   The shipyard reportedly suffered losses of $560 million from
canceled orders and $646 million in delayed exports.

   The government has expelled a
Soviet shipping official for attempting to bribe Dutch officials
into giving him secret information, the Interior Ministry said
Wednesday.
   ``His activities were deemed dangerous to the state,'' Willem
Egels, a spokesman for the ministry's Domestic Security Service,
told The Associated Press.
   G.S. Karpechenkov, an employee of the Soviet trade mission in
Amsterdam, left the Netherlands on Sunday, Egels said.
   He refused to disclose what information Karpechenkov allegedly
tried to obtain.
   The Soviet was accredited to Sovfrakt, the trade mission's
shipping agency that operates out of the capital, Amsterdam, said
Egels. But he had worked mostly at the Rotterdam offices of
Transworld, a Dutch-Soviet joint venture in shipping, Egels said.
   Rotterdam is the world's biggest port and a frequent transit
point for high technology and computer equipment shipped between
Western Europe, Japan and the United States. The North Atlantic
Treaty Organization bans the export of several types of such
equipment to Soviet bloc nations.
   The port also plays a vital role in bringing U.S. troops and war
material to Western Europe in the event of a Warsaw Pact attack.

<TEXT>
   China's Premier Li Peng arrived Wednesday on the
first visit to Japan by a Chinese head of state in seven years, and
Japanese officials said he played down his country's growing ties
with the Soviet Union.
   In talks with Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, Li also expressed
support for Japan's position in a long territorial dispute with
Moscow and welcomed increased Japanese investment in China, a
Foreign Ministry official said.
   The ministry official, who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity, quoted Takeshita as telling Li that close ties with
China were an important pillar of Japanese foreign policy.
   ``We hope the improved relations between China and the Soviet
Union won't have an adverse effect on good China-Japanese
relations,'' Takeshita was quoted as saying. ``We hope the
improvements will be carried out in such a way that they will
promote peace in all of Asia.''
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is scheduled to visit
Beijing in May for the first Soviet-Chinese summit in 30 years. The
Communist countries split in 1960 over bitter ideological and
strategic differences.
   The official quoted Li as saying Beijing and Moscow had ``made
some progress, but no major progress'' toward closer relations in
the areas of economics, technology and science.
   ``But China will continue to follow a foreign policy of
independence and self-reliance,'' the official quoted him as saying.
   Li said China supported Japan's demand that Moscow return a
group of islands off northern Japan that it seized at the end of
World War II, the official added. The dispute over the Kuril
islands has been a major obstacle to the improvement of
Soviet-Japanese relations.
   The official said Li expressed pleasure over increased
Japanese-Chinese trade, which totaled a record $19.3 billion last
year, according to Japanese figures.
   Although Japan provides 80 percent of China's credit and serves
as its second-largest trading partner after Hong Kong, it accounts
for only 8 percent of China's total foreign investment.
   Japanese reluctance to invest in Chinese industries apparently
has grown in recent months due to a Chinese austerity program aimed
at reducing inflation. Some factories have been cut off from credit
and raw materials.
   Shortly before Li's arrival, Japan's parliament approved an
investment protection agreement signed during a visit by Takeshita
to China last summer and already ratified by Beijing. The pact
guarantees Japanese investors in China will receive equal treatment
with Chinese businesses.
   Li's visit is the first to Japan by a Chinese premier since Zhao
Ziyang, now Communist Party head, visited in May 1982.

   The man who forged the so-called
Hitler diaries has opened a gallery of his own paintings, which
copy works of master painters and proudly proclaim on the back:
``Forged by Konrad Kujau.''
   The 50-year-old West German claims he can imitate the styles of
52 painters, including Rembrandt and Salvador Dali. His Stuttgart
gallery, which opened last month, will offer the paintings for $105
to $800.
   Kujau is known for fabricating the Hitler diaries, which he sold
to the West German magazine Stern in 1983. He later admitted he had
made up the diaries, and he proclaimed himself the country's top
forger.
   Kujau was convicted of forgery in 1985 by a Hamburg court and
was sentenced to four years and six months in prison. He was
released after two years.

   Two French shipments of humanitarian aid to Lebanon
are for both Moslems and Christians and do not mean France is
choosing sides in that country's civil war, President Francois
Mitterrand said Wednesday.
   ``France is the friend of Lebanese of all religions, all
communities,'' Mitterrand told his Cabinet. ``The humanitarian aid
is a sign of friendship and solidarity for the Lebanese people,
nothing more than that.''
   Both ships arrived in Larnaca, Cyprus, on Wednesday morning, the
French Foreign Ministry said. The French minister for humanitarian
affairs, Bernard Kouchner, was in Beirut trying to arrange a means
of distribution, a spokesman said.
   The supplies are to help ease shortages caused by a month of
sectarian fighting. One vessel contains fuel and food and the other
is a hospital ship with beds, surgical facilities and medical
supplies.
   France, which ruled Lebanon from the end of World War I until
independence in 1943, has voiced concern about the fate of
Lebanon's Christian community and sent a special envoy to help
mediate the crisis.
   Lebanese Moslems have said the former colonial power is biased
in the dispute. They renounced their share of the supplies and
warned the ships against docking, stirring fears the issue could
trigger heavier fighting in the nation.
   The latest confrontation broke out after Gen. Michel Aoun's
mainly Christian army units blocked illegal militia-run ports that
have been stripping the Lebanese state treasury of about $100
million annually. Syrian troops joined the Druse forces of Walid
Jumblatt in retaliating with a blockade of Christian east Beirut
and surrounding Christian communities.
   The French ambassador to Lebanon, Paul Blanc, said the embassy
was damaged Wednesday in heavy artillery shelling around Beirut
   There are currently more than 4,300 French in Christian east
Beirut and 840 in mainly Moslem west Beirut.
   A Tuesday night prayer vigil for Lebanon at Notre Dame Cathedral
drew nearly 4,000 people.

   Police said Wednesday they would
arrest a South Korean dissident upon his return from communist
North Korea, where he made an unauthorized visit for talks on
national unification.
   Demonstrations protesting the government plan to arrest Rev.
Moon Ik-hwan broke out in the capital.
   Dissidents and student radicals said they would defy a
government warning and greet the dissident, who was to arrive
Thursday from his nine-day North Korean trip.
   Government authorities planned to deploy 15,000 police at Kimpo
International Airport and other areas to block pro-Moon rallies and
anti-government protests by radical groups.
   Officials said Moon, 71, faces charges of violating the National
Security Law, which bans unauthorized trips to North Korea,
capitalist South Korea's archrival. A conviction on the charge
carries a possible 10-year jail sentence.
   At several schools in the capital, groups of 100 to 400 students
Wednesday hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police to protest the
plans to arrest Moon. Police retaliated with tear gas. There were
no immediate reports of arrests or injuries.
   In Suwon, 30 miles south of Seoul, 15,000 people rallied against
Moon's trip. Organizers said they would hold more anti-Moon rallies
in other cities in the coming week.
   Moon, a Presbyterian clergyman, was the first dissident leader
to visit North Korea. He publicly called the North's leader, Kim Il
Sung, ``a respected president whom I have wanted to meet so long.''
   Moon's trip triggered a major crackdown on the nation's
increasingly militant dissident groups, which officials say are
bent on overthrowing South Korea's democratic system.

   Cambodia's Communist Party has expanded
its ruling Politburo and Central Committee in an effort to
strengthen its forces before a scheduled pullout of Vietnamese
troops.
   Vietnam installed the Cambodian government after invading in
1978. Vietnamese officials announced last week they would withdraw
their estimated 50,000-70,000 troops by the end of September.
   In order to reach a political settlement, Cambodia's communist
rulers would be forced to negotiate with resistance forces backed
by the United States and China.
   ``The restructuring of this Fifth Party Central Committee was
needed to further strengthen and expand the leading role of the
Cambodian revolution,'' said an official Cambodian radio broadcast
in announcing the changes.
   The Politburo moves were made at an extraordinary session of the
Central Committee on Tuesday, the radio said. A text was obtained
in Bangkok on Wednesday.
   The radio said Tie Banh, a vice prime minister and the defense
minister, was elected to the Politburo.
   It also said the three alternate members of the Politburo were
made full members and three new alternates were picked.
   The new Politburo comprises 12 full members and three alternates.
   Earlier in the day, a national conference of party members
elected 21 new members to the policy-making Central Committee,
including 11 full members, the radio said. Seven alternate members
were also made full members.
   The broadcast said the committee now has 49 full members and 16
alternates.

   About 100 newspaper editors sat down after
breakfast Wednesday _ about the time millions of their readers were
turning to the comic pages _ to discuss whether ``Cathy'' should be
political and what to do when the kids grow up in ``For Better or
Worse.''
   Serious issues these, so there wasn't a single outburst of
laughter when members of the American Society of Newspaper Editors
attended a convention workshop on what funnies they print.
   How serious?
   Well, the people who draw the comics are referred to as
``artists.'' Among those who review their works for the syndicates
that sell them to newspapers are lawyers, who have a field day with
``Doonesbury,'' and editors, who sometimes must negotiate with an
artist to tone down a character's off-color language.
   And newspaper editors who decide that a strip has gone too far
and yank it from the paper for a day or two had better brace: some
readers are sure to hurl the ugly term ``censor.''
   ``Pulling a strip draws so much attention to it and to you as a
censor, that you're reluctant to do it,'' reported Marty Claus,
managing editor for features and business at the Detroit Free Press.
   In any event, she said, readers are more worldly than editors
might think; they often don't care to be protected.
   ``People will see that Toledo ran it and Detroit didn't and
they'll say, `Let me be the judge (of what's off base),''' Ms.
Claus said.
   She plugged for more blacks and other minorities in the comics,
reporting that a month-long census of all the characters on her
paper's funny pages revealed that fewer than 1 percent were
non-white.
   Lynn Johnston, who draws ``For Better or Worse,'' the story of a
family much like hers, said she worries about how far to go in
injecting her opinion into her comic strip. She has strong opinions
on abortion, for example, and might want to express them in her
strip, but shies away and thinks: ``Can I handle it?'' She's
thin-skinned, she said, and hates hate mail.
   On the other hand, she said, ``I don't want to be a
marshmallow.''
   Another problem for Ms. Johnston was whether to let the kids in
her strip grow old. She's decided to _ it's more natural _ but
frets ``I'm going to grow right out of a job.''
   She gets heart-warming mail from loyal readers who write:
``We've been with you since Lizzie was a baby.''
   Ray Billingsley, the black artist behind ``Curtis,'' a comic
strip about a black kid, said the comics should deal with social
issues. He is itching to do a story line on crack, the cocaine
derivative, he said, but thinks he'd better let Curtis, who was
created last October, get better established first.
   ``Let these strips be bold,'' Billingsley advised the editors.
``The public is more accepting than many editors think.''
   Editors' sensitivities are an old story to Lee Salem, editorial
director of Universal Press Syndicate, who recalled what happened
last fall when a character in ``Cathy'' endorsed Michael Dukakis
for president.
   Thirty papers pulled the strip for the two-week duration of its
political wallowing and three cancelled it outright, but two of
them quickly came back, Salem said.
   He favors giving artists their freedom, after they've earned it.
Artists want to deal with AIDS, animal rights, drugs and
shoplifting, and they're bound to do it, he said.
   Ms. Claus said they should have as much freedom as columnists;
after all, she said, their names are on their strips just like a
columnist's byline.
   On one point, what constitutes a good panel, there was full
agreement: a comic strip bats 1.000 when it gets clipped out and
mailed to mom or posted on the refrigerator.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today appealed for
calm in Soviet Georgia and an end to nationalist demonstrations
that have claimed at least 19 lives in the southern republic, the
Tass news agency said.
   Also today, the Communist Party chief of Soviet Georgia offered
to resign after local leaders met to discuss the violence, the
Foreign Ministry said.
   The appeal from Gorbachev and the resignation offer came as
scattered strikes continued in Georgia and funerals were readied
for the people who were killed during the suppression of the
protests Sunday.
   In an address to the Georgian people, which Tass said was
published in the republic's capital, Gorbachev said
pro-independence demonstrations ``damaged the interests of
perestroika, democratization and renewal in the country.''
   Gorbachev said, ``The interests of the working people have
nothing in common with attempts to sever the existing ties of
friendship and cooperation among our peoples, dismantle the
socialist system in the republic and push it into the slough of
ethnic enmity.''
   Gorbachev said ``actions by irresponsible persons'' had to the
loss of life in Tbilisi, the republic's capital, and he called on
all inhabitants of Georgia to show restraint and common sense.
   ``We may not allow a blow to be dealt to the interests of any
Soviet republic, to the brotherhood of the peoples of the U.S.S.R.,
to the cause of renewal,'' Gorbachev said.
   Gennady Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said party
leader Dzhumber Patiashvili ``asked to be relieved of his duties''
at a leadership meeting Tuesday night and that the party will now
decide his fate.
   Gerasimov said Patiashvili acted after widespread criticism of
Georgian leaders, but the spokesman did not specify what prompted
the complaints.
   Officials have said 18 civilians died in the violence Sunday,
but Gerasimov today said another girl had died Tuesday, bringing
the death toll to 19. Their funerals will be held Thursday, Friday
and Saturday, he said.
   Pravda put the number of police and troops injured in a clash
Sunday between Soviet troops and pro-independence demonstrators at
91. Previously, officials had said 75 soldiers and police were hurt.
   No reason was given for the change.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, an ethnic Georgian,
remained in his home republic to help quell the unrest. He met with
people on the street and had a ``heated but at the same time
substantive dialogue,'' Gerasimov said.
   The official Communist Party newspaper Pravda said today the
mood remained ``extremely tense'' in Tbilisi and several other
cities in the republic.
   A church employee in Tbilisi, who demanded anonymity, said in a
telephone interview that the situation in the capital is ``more or
less quiet now'' and that authorities had promised to life an
overnight curfew. Authorities continued to enforce a ban on public
gatherings.
   The military newspaper Red Star said army officers have been
dropping leaflets onto the city from helicopters. It indicated the
leaflets were part of an official campaign to counter public anger
against the military.
   Red Star said youths were harassing Soviet soldiers, and ``there
are attempts under way to organize provocations against soldiers.''
   The newspaper said a major had been pelted with stones and a
lieutenant colonel had been hit in the head by a bottle thrown from
a window.
   Foreign reporters have been barred from traveling to Georgia,
the birthplace of former Soviet leader Josef Stalin.
   Soviet media said strikers have been trying to prevent other
Georgians from working, including bus drivers and factory workers.
   The central square where the clash took place was covered today
in flowers, placed as memorial tributes to the dead, said Zhorab
Lomidze, an editor at the Georgian news agency Gruzinform.
   Cars and trolleys were adorned Tuesday with black flags, and
people wore black clothes and ribbons, said Nana Natadze, wife of a
nationalist activist.
   Demonstrations in the southern republic began April 4.
   Protesters had attacked calls from some members of the
republic's ethnic Abkhazians minority to secede because of alleged
discrimination by Georgians.
   Others demanded Georgia secede from the Soviet Union because of
alleged interference by the central government in their political,
economic and cultural affairs.

<HEAD>Democratic Chairman Says Restore `Super Delegate' Status to Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Party chairman Ronald Brown, saying
he wanted to avoid a ``bloody and divisive fight,'' slammed the
door Wednesday on any sweeping re-examination of party rules, but
said he would support restoring automatic delegate status to party
officials.
   Brown's backing for giving ``super delegate'' status to
Democratic National Committee members could raise a new conflict
with Jesse Jackson.
   However, Brown already was getting caught between Jackson and
party activists who want to eliminate a rule that provides for
allocating national convention delegates to presidential candidates
on the basis of the proportion of votes they received in primaries
or caucuses.
   Robert Beckel, manager of Walter F. Mondale's 1984 presidential
campaign, is leading an effort to restore rules that would require
candidates to get a certain percentage of the vote to qualify for
receiving any delegates.
   ``We have to get closure on this process as early as possible,''
said Beckel.
   Told of Brown's comments, Beckel said, ``The last thing I want
to do is get into a fight with Ron Brown over the rules. ... If
Brown goes to the wall on this thing it would be very difficult to
do.''
   Beckel said he was not advocating formation of a new rules
commission. He said he hoped the DNC would adopt his proposed
changes at a meeting next fall.
   At the 1988 Democratic National Convention, with Brown serving
as Jackson's convention manager, new party rules stripped
Democratic National Committee members of the automatic delegate
status for future conventions and instituted proportional
representation as the basis for selecting delegates.
   Still, Jackson contended that minimum-vote requirements resulted
in denying him a proportion of delegates equal to the popular vote
he received. He also viewed the party and elected officials sent to
the convention, as uncommitted super delegates, as a force largely
opposed to his candidacy. Only a handful of elected officials
backed Jackson's bid for the presidential nomination.
   ``I have absolutely no intention to appoint, empower or create
any kind of rules commission,'' said Brown, at a news conference at
which he announced the appointments of senior DNC staff.
   ``We don't win or lose elections because of rules. ... I frankly
think it would be foolhardy for this party to spend the next two
years in a bloody and divisive fight over the rules,'' he said.
   After presidential election defeats in 1968, 1972 and 1980, the
Democrats engaged in sweeping revisions of the party rules. After
the 1984 defeat, the party went through a more modest change.
   Brown also said recent Democratic election victories in contests
to fill vacant House seats were of ``tremendous national
significance.''
   Democrat Jill Long was an upset victor in the contest to fill
the House seat in Indiana once held by Vice President Dan Quayle.
The Democrats also held a Democratic seat in Alabama and are given
a good chance of capturing the Wyoming House seat formerly held by
Dick Cheney, who resigned to become secretary of defense.

<HEAD>Businesses Plan Solid Growth in Capital Spending This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government reported Wednesday that
American businesses plan to boost their plant and equipment
spending this year by a solid 6.3 percent, which analysts said
could help forestall a recession.
   The Commerce Department said a survey completed in March found
companies planning to spend an inflation-adjusted $450.39 billion
this year for expansion and modernization, which would surpass the
record $423.77 billion spent in 1988.
   The pace of growth in 1989 would be slower than the 10.1 percent
increase recorded last year, but analysts said the anticipated gain
in capital spending still is healthy and indicates that businesses
remain optimistic about the economy's performance.
   Continued strength in capital spending and the resulting
increase in productivity could help extend the life of the economic
expansion and ease inflationary pressures that have mounted as
factories in some industries operate at rates near full capacity,
these analysts said.
   ``We think the economy will slow down, but we expect that
because of continued strong capital spending and continued strong
exports we should be able to avert an outright recession,'' said
David Wyss of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass.
   The new estimate for capital spending in 1989 represents an
increase from an earlier survey released in December, when
businesses said they planned to boost spending by 5.9 percent this
year.
   The upward revision, based on a survey conducted from January
through March, came even as most analysts are predicting the
economy will cool this year. Analysts said businesses are likely to
scale back their spending plans as evidence of a slowdown builds.
   ``The year got off to a good start, but what happens from here
is going to depend on what happens to their markets,'' said Robert
G. Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
``The question is are they in fact going to carry out their
intentions or are they going to be dragged down by developments
elsewhere.''
   The Federal Reserve Board has been pushing up interest rates for
a year in an effort to cool the economy and restrain inflation. The
Bush administration and some analysts, however, have expressed
concern that the anti-inflation campaign could prove too potent and
unintentionally push the country into a recession.
   Should the survey's spending estimates be realized, ``that would
be consistent with what the Fed has been desiring, a less vigorous
economy but one which is being led by capital spending,'' Dederick
said.
   The 10.1 percent gain in capital spending last year was the
biggest percentage increase since a 16.6 percent rise in 1984, when
businesses still were recovering from the 1981-82 recession.
Spending had climbed just 2.3 percent in 1987 and dropped 3.9
percent in 1986.
   The growth in capital spending last year, which came as
companies rushed to expand production to meet rising export demand,
was credited with helping power strong economic growth in 1988.
However, many analysts are worried that last year's export boom has
stalled.
   The smaller anticipated increase in capital spending for this
year includes a 4.1 percent planned rise for manufacturing
companies to $171.44 billion, compared with a 12.9 percent jump in
1988.
   The projected manufacturing increase includes a 3 percent gain
in spending at plants that make durable goods, items expected to
last three or more years, and a 5.1 percent increase by companies
producing non-durable goods.
   Companies engaged in mining, transportation and other
non-manufacturing ventures are expected to increase spending by 7.7
percent to $278.94 billion.
   Before adjusting for inflation, capital spending for 1989 is
expected to rise by 9.1 percent to $468.78 billion after increasing
10.3 percent in 1988.

   President and Mrs. Bush paid $62,106 in
federal taxes last year on an adjusted gross income of $278,171,
including his $115,000 salary as vice president, according to tax
returns released today.
   Besides Bush's salary, the couple also reported $155,662 in
income from a blind trust they share, $7,147 in interest income and
$12,362 in income from other sources.
   The Bushes paid taxes equivalent to 21.6 percent of their total
income. The adjusted gross income figure for 1988 was nearly
$30,000 below the $308,396 figure from the year before.
   Bush, who became a millionaire in the oil business in Texas, has
a net worth in the range of $2 million, much of that wrapped up in
the family's $3.5 million oceanside home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Bush and his wife Barbara claimed $65,365 in itemized
deductions, which included $12,250 in contributions to 39 charities.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, also releasing his tax forms today,
reported adjusted gross income of $156,546 for 1988. Quayle paid
federal and Indiana state income taxes of $34,309, his office said
in a summary of his return.
   The vice president reported his $89,500 salary as a U.S. senator
and $51,636 in honoraria from speaking fees. The balance of his
income came from interest and dividend income and capital gains,
all relating to his family's Central Newspapers Inc.
   Quayle also made $2,000 as a director of Central Newspapers, a
position he would have to give up under the rules recommended by
Bush's special commission on ethics.
   All of Quayle's speeches for money were made before August, when
Bush selected him as his running mate, the vice president's office
said.
   Quayle and his wife Marilyn also claimed $50,503 in itemized
deductions, including $17,270 in charitable contributions.
   The government withheld $29,480 from the Bushes' income in 1988,
and the president made $65,404 in quarterly payments made based on
the assumption of what his tax liability would be.
   When the Bushes' federal tax liability of $62,106 was deducted
from the $94,884 total in money withheld or prepaid, the couple had
overpaid by $32,778.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the president
chose to apply $15,000 of the $32,778 refund to next year's taxes,
and to keep the remaining $17,778.
   Bush also reported a net capital gains loss of $3,458, and after
the standard $3,000 deduction allowed by law, had a $458 loss which
can be carried over to next year.
   Included in the income that Bush reported on his 1988 tax forms
was $11,962 in profit from his interest in a liquified natural gas
transportation barge in Louisiana.
   Bush paid only $3,328 in state and local income taxes, with the
bulk of that going to Louisiana in connection with his interest in
the barge. Bush is a legal resident of Texas, which has no state
income taxes. He also paid $19,034 in real estate taxes, the bulk
of that involving his Kennebunkport property, and some paid on a
vacant lot he owns in Houston.

   First lady Barbara Bush underwent radioactive
treatment today to destroy her thyroid gland because it is
producing excess levels of hormones, a condition that has irritated
her eyes and caused her to lose 18 pounds in recent months.
   ``She's just fine, piece of cake, never broke her stride,'' Mrs.
Bush's press secretary, Anna Perez, said after the president's wife
returned to the White House following a two-hour stay at Walter
Reed Army Medical Center.
   The radiation was administered in an iodine solution sipped
through a straw. Mrs. Bush said it was a colorless liquid that
tasted like water, Ms. Perez reported.
   Doctors told Mrs. Bush, 63, that the only side effect she may
suffer is a slight pain in the neck for several days. ``She cracked
jokes about that all day,'' Ms. Perez said.
   Moreover, ``just as a precaution, she shouldn't hug her puppies
for a couple of days and she shouldn't kiss her grandchildren,''
the spokeswoman said.
   She explained that puppies and children have a heightened
sensitivity to the radiation in Mrs. Bush's body. The first lady
has 11 grandchildren and her dog, Millie, recently produced six
puppies.
   Mrs. Bush expressed surprise that her treatment attracted so
much news media attention, and was ``wondering why her visit to
Walter Reed gets so much coverage when Child Help (a non-profit
organization for youngsters) doesn't,'' her press secretary said.
   A White House statement said the procedure ``has no significant
side effects'' and has been a standard treatment for 40 years for
people suffering with Mrs. Bush's condition, known as Graves
disease.
   Once her thyroid gland has stopped operating, probably in two to
three months, Mrs. Bush will have to take daily medication to
maintain adequate hormone levels, Ms. Perez said.
   President Bush was asked about his wife at a White House
ceremony for the college basketball champions while Mrs. Bush was
still at the hospital. He replied ``Fine,'' when asked how she was
doing.
   Mrs. Bush consulted doctors last month because of swelling and
irritation in her eyes, causing them to tear, and the sudden weight
loss.
   For several weeks, Mrs. Bush has been treated with methimazole,
a drug that blocks production of excess hormones in the thyroid, a
butterfly-shaped gland in the neck.
   Ms. Perez said the use of drugs was an interim therapy and that
the destruction of the thyroid through radiation was a more
permanent treatment.
   Left untreated, Graves disease can be life-threatening, but it
generally responds quickly to therapy.
   It is caused when antibodies attack the thyroid gland and cause
it to secrete too much hormone.
   The disease is more apt to occur in older women.
   Mrs. Bush's treatment with methimazole was discontinued Sunday
in preparation for today's procedure. It will be restarted three
days after the treatment and then continue until her level of
thyroid hormones falls below normal.
   Mrs. Bush is under the care of White House physicians Burton J.
Lee III and Lawrence C. Mohr, in consultation with Dr. Kenneth
Burman, a thyroid specialist at Walter Reed.

<HEAD>Semiautomatic Rifles Poised for Import if Bush Suspension Lifted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Close to 1 million new semiautomatic
assault-style rifles could flood the United States if the Bush
administration decides to end its suspension of such imports.
   Gun importers have applications to bring in 965,000 of the
weapons pending at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
according to spokesman Dick Pedersen.
   The import suspension was imposed March 14 after public and
police outcries over the increased use of the weapons such as
semiautomatic versions of AK-47s and Uzi carbines in drug-related
violence, and the January slayings of five schoolchildren in
Stockton, Calif..
   The suspension covered some 400,000 weapons including about
300,000 for which import permits already had been approved. Last
week, the administration expanded the suspension to cover 240,000
separate weapons.
   ``We noticed the increase in these showing up in crimes, an
increase in demand, and we reacted to it,'' Pedersen said. ``The
main thing is that we might be nipping the semiautomatic
assault-type rifle in the bud rather than have millions of them
flooding in here.''
   Nevertheless, gun importers are continuing to submit
applications, he said Tuesday.
   ``It appears there have been a lot more applications that came
in after the ban,'' Pedersen said.
   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is required by law
to permit imports only of weapons suitable or adaptable to
``sporting purposes,'' and it is studying the use of the
semiautomatic rifles to determine how they are being used. The
review should take two to three months more months.
   Despite the uproar over such weapons, FBI crime statistics
reveal that most murders by firearms are still committed by people
wielding handguns. Of the 17,859 murders committed nationwide in
1987, 10,556 were committed with firearms of which 7,807 were
handguns, according to the FBI.
   Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Con Dougherty says
that increasing numbers of powerful and sophisticated handguns such
as the 9mm semiautomatic, particularly guns such as the Uzi pistol,
are being confiscated during arrests.
   Nevertheless, Pedersen said it is extremely unlikely that the
current import suspension on rifles will be expanded to any
handguns.
   ``Handguns are used in sport, in target shooting, extensively,''
Pedersen said. ``That's negligible as far as assault weapons are
concerned.''
   Many local and federal police agencies have recently begun to
arm themselves with foreign-made 9mm semiautomatic handguns, he
said.
   It would be up to Congress to make any changes in the
availability of such guns, he said.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, has introduced a bill that would
place some of the same restrictions on both semiautomatic
machine-style pistols and assault-style rifles that are now imposed
on automatic weapons, including FBI background checks on purchasers
and fingerprinting, but not the $200 fee charged to owners of
machine guns, according to the senator's spokeswoman, Nancy Coffey.
   Among the semiautomatic handguns that would be restricted if
Metzenbaum's bill passes are the Uzi pistol, the Ingram Mac 10 and
Mac 11 and the Tec 9 and Tec 22, she said.
   About 231,000 foreign handguns, including semiautomatic weapons,
were imported in 1986, the last year for which Pedersen had data.
There was no breakdown for the number of semiautomatic handguns, he
said.
   The number of hanguns being imported has ``been decreasing over
the years,'' while more than 1 million handguns have been produced
domestically each year, he said.
   In 1982, some 332,000 handguns were imported, followed by
411,000 in 1983, 341,000 in 1984 and 229,000 in 1985.
   Greg Risch of Handgun Control Inc. said police are finding
assault-style handguns that ``have clips that hold 30, 40,
sometimes 50 rounds of ammunition, but yet are still fairly
concealable, as opposed to an assault rifle that is more
concealable than a hunting rifle, but still a large size.''

<HEAD>Alaska Signs Off On Drilling In Remote Chukchi Sea</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Tanker Spill Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Shell Western E&amp;P Inc. has cleared the
last major hurdle in its quest to become the first company to
explore for oil in the remote Chukchi Sea, known for extreme ice
and weather.
   The state has signed off on the project between northwest Alaska
and Soviet territorial water, clearing the way for the federal
government to issue Shell a permit to drill 80 miles northwest of
Alaska's Icy Cape.
   The state's ruling that Shell's plan was consistent with the
Alaska Coastal Zone Management plan came the day before the Exxon
Valdez ran aground, fouling Prince William Sound with more than 10
million gallons of oil in the nation's worst spill.
   Bob Grogan, director of the Alaska Division of Governmental
Coordination, said any proposed development in the Chukchi Sea,
north of the Bering Strait, likely would be scrutinized carefully
by the state and federal governments.
   ``Virtually anything right now dealing with oil and gas has to
be taken in context of the Valdez disaster,'' Grogan said.
   ``There's a tremendous amount of clamor in the Lower 48 and
coastal states for the president to call for a reassessment of the
Outer Continental Shelf,'' Grogan said. ``Alaska also is being
asked to be involved in these discussions. The state, no doubt,
will be doing its own rethinking.''
   The U.S. Minerals Management Service already has approved
Shell's exploration plan, which calls for up to 60 wells on 11
federal leases over the next four years.
   ``Although we have not completed our review, we don't anticipate
any real problem with it,'' said Rodney Smith, the federal agency's
supervisor of field operations. Shell should get its permit within
30 days, he said.
   Shell wants to drill its first well more than 15,000 feet deep
in 140 feet of water this summer. It plans to drill from a floating
rig being refitted in Victoria, B.C.
   The state encouraged Shell to work with the state Department of
Environmental Conservation to ensure that its plan contains a
``valid prediction of discharge movement and spreading of an oil
spill ...''
   The state approval requires Shell to employ safeguards to
protect fish and wildlife, particularly walruses that inhabit the
area.

<HEAD>North Says Didn't Think Altering Classified Documents Was Unlawful</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 19 grafs new with North saying he thought he was told to
alter documents to protect Reagan; pick up 3rd graf, That statement. Cuts
last 13 grafs to tighten.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver North testified today he thought an
order to alter documents was designed to hide knowledge by
President Reagan of secret National Security Council assistance to
the Contras.
   North said then-national security adviser Robert McFarlane told
him to change the documents amid congressional inquiries into the
NSC staff's assistance to the Contras during a ban on military aid
to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   North's testimony contradicts McFarlane, who said it was North
who proposed making changes to the documents in late summer 1985.
   ``The gist of what he wanted removed from the documents was
language that would indicate his knowledge or the president's
knowledge about my activities in this time frame,'' North testified
on his fifth day on the witness stand.
   North said the changes ``weren't done to protect me ... there
were people above me.''
   ``I didn't think it was unlawful'' to make changes, said North,
because the order came from ``Mr. McFarlane, a cabinet officer 100
steps from the president of the United states. I had been led to
believe that everything I was doing was done at the direction of
the president.''
   ``Altering documents?,'' asked prosecutor John Keker.
   ``Yes,'' responded North.
   ``You had been told by the president of the United States to
destroy documents? Explain how you had come to that conclusion,''
asked Keker.
   ``Because everything I had done that was described on this list,
I had been told was at the direction of the president,'' said North.
   North said he didn't make the alterations in 1985 when McFarlane
originally asked him to because he was busy. ``I just didn't get it
done,'' he said.
   Also, ``it didn't make sense,'' said North. He added that many
other NSC documents that he was not being asked to change showed
secret Contra assistance.
   But North made the changes when McFarlane, nearly a year after
leaving the government, asked him again to do so as the Iran-Contra
affair unraveled in November 1986.
   Even though North was acquiescing to a request from someone who
was no longer in the government, ``You were still a pawn in a chess
game being played by giants?'' prosecutor John Keker asked
sarcastically.
   North made the comment about being a pawn last week in
testifying about being told by his superiors to attend a meeting
with the House Intelligence Committee. He is charged with
obstructing the committee's work by making false statements denying
he was assisting the Contras.
   ``You don't need to belittle the comment,'' answered North. The
former NSC aide said he had been referring to the political
struggle between the executive branch and the Congress.
   Among the alterations in the memos from North to McFarlane:
deleting references to compensating Guatemala for supplying phony
end-user certificates in connection with arms shipments to the
Contras; omitting a reference to approaching donors for Contra
contributions; taking out a reference to sustaining the delivery of
lethal supplies to the rebels.
   Earlier today, North blamed McFarlane for sending a letter to
Congress that falsely denied the NSC staff was assisting the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua.
   Keker read aloud a section of a proposed response to then-Rep.
Michael Barnes saying, ``None of us has solicited funds ... or ...
coordinated the military ... efforts of the resistance.''
   ``That statement is untrue and I did not put it in there,''
North said of the draft letter to Barnes, D-Md. He said McFarlane,
then his boss, ``had written his own'' letter on Sept. 12, 1985.
   ``What did you do to straighten it out?'' Keker asked.
   ``I am quite certain I didn't do much ... at all,'' North
replied. He said McFarlane ``had already put this kind of language
in his letter'' on Sept. 5, 1985 to Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., then
the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
   ``I wrote a number of other letters'' that were ``inconsistent
with the facts ... I just simply do not believe I wrote this
letter,'' said North. ``Those ... words are written in Mr.
McFarlane's handwriting.''
   Keker interjected: ``And apparently sent to you for editing.''
   ``And that is a point I would contest because I don't believe it
was sent to me for editing,'' North said.
   Among 12 criminal counts, North is accused of making a false
statement to Congress in connection with the letters to Barnes and
Hamilton. No charges have been filed against him in connection with
letters he says he wrote on Contra support to at least one other
congressman and two senators.

   Assailants hurled firebombs
inside the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and an electronics firm
Wednesday, and police blamed both attacks on supporters of jailed
terrorists staging a hunger strike.
   Two employees were slightly injured in the stock exchange attack
when at least six masked youths entered the main hall before
opening time and threw firebombs at computer terminals.
   Security officials seized three attackers, but the others
escaped, said Frankfurt police spokesman Oswald Neumann. He said
those held were two women, ages 24 and 27, and a 28-year-old man.
   Authorities said the attack destroyed or damaged several
computers and delayed the opening time by a few minutes.
   Earlier in the northern city of Muenster, unidentified
assailants set off a firebomb inside the offices of the AEG
electronics firm, a subsidiary of the Daimler-Benz automotive and
high-technology conglomerate.
   Authorities said the 3:30 a.m. attack caused millions of dollars
worth of damage but no injuries.
   Those attackers got away. The federal prosecution spokesman in
Karlsruhe, Alexander Prechtel, said supporters of jailed Red Army
Faction members on a hunger strike claimed responsibility in a
letter left near the scene.
   At least 34 imprisoned terrorists have been fasting to demand a
special cell block for jailed members of the radical organization,
which seeks to undermine West German capitalism with
assassinations, bank robberies and other attacks.
   Police said they believe group sympathizers carried out the
stock exchange attack as well.
   ``We are going on the supposition that this (the stock exchange
attack) is in connection with the ongoing hunger strike and demands
for Red Army Faction inmates to be placed together,'' said Neumann.
   Two of the fasting prisoners, Christa Eckers and Karl-Heinz
Dellwo, claim to have subsisted only on vitamins and water for 71
days. They are reported to be in serious condition.
   The message left near the electronics firm demanded that the
hunger strikers be housed together in one or two large groups,
Prechtel said.
   Prechtel said the Federal Protection Office is worried the
attacks could be a prelude to more violence by sympathizers.
   ``We fear that this is going to continue. We can only hope that
people don't become victims of the attacks,'' Prechtel said.

   The House Interior Committee voted Wednesday
to use subpoenas if necessary to gather information in its
investigation of the Exxon Valdez accident in Alaska.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., who made the proposal, said the
committee hasn't used its subpoena power in at least 15 years, but
he felt it was important to ``send a strong message to the
interested parties that we expect all parties to cooperate.''
   Miller heads the Subcommitee on Water, Power and Offshore Energy
Resources which will be handling the spill investigation for the
House.
   Interior Committee Chairman Morris Udall, D-Ariz., said great
discretion would be used.
   ``We haven't been exactly fast and loose with subpoena power,''
Udall said.
   The committee vote was unanimous, though Republicans said it
seemed premature since no one had refused to cooperate yet.
   The Exxon Valdez, a tanker owned by Exxon Corp., dumped 10
million gallons of oil into the Prince William Sound on March 24
when it ran aground. The spill into one of the nation's most
pristine areas continues to threaten environmentally sensitive
areas of the Alaskan shore.
   Miller has not yet scheduled hearings.

   Soviet-born conductor Mstislav Rostropovich,
praising new artistic freedom in his homeland, announced today he
will take the National Symphony Orchestra on a concert tour of the
Soviet Union next February.
   Rostropovich will lead the 103-member orchestra in two concerts
in Moscow and two in Leningrad, he told a news conference at the
Kennedy Center, which is the orchestra's home.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin hinted to reporters that the tour
could be the next step in restoring Soviet citizenship, which was
stripped from Rostropovich in 1978. Dubinin and the conductor
embraced with tears in their eyes after the news conference.
   ``Let's hope the time will come when all juridical decisions
will be taken according to the wishes of Maestro Rostropovich,''
Dubinin said.
   Rostropovich said that ``for artistic freedom, there has been
enormous change'' in his homeland under Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. He said he was ``very excited and very nervous about
making his first official visit to the Soviet Union since he was
exiled 15 years ago.
   The internationally acclaimed cellist and music director has
said privately that he and his wife, soprano Galina Vishnevskaya,
would return to their homeland if their citizenship were restored
and their reputations cleared. But he has often said he wants to
take the orchestra to the Soviet Union ``and show them how to play
Russian music.''
   The Soviet media have recently carried several articles urging
that the couple's citizenship, which was stripped in 1978, be
returned. The Soviet government had accused them of ``unpatriotic
activity'' and ``acts harmful to the Soviet Union.''
   Those acts included taking novelist Alexander Solzhenitsyn into
their home after he had been driven out of the writers' union and
deprived of his apartment.

<HEAD>Bush Administration To Release Aid To Egypt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has decided to release $230
million in economic aid to Egypt that had been held up while the
Arab government undertook bureaucratic reforms, the State
Department said Wednesday.
   Formal notification to Congress is expected by the end of the
week. Congress can delay the resumption of aid, but legally cannot
block it. Besides, a U.S. official said, there is no serious
opposition to ending the one-month suspension.
   The $230 million covers cash payments to Egypt for this year and
for 1988. Overall, Egypt is due to receive $1.63 billion in U.S.
economic assistance for the two years plus surplus food, making it
the largest U.S. aid recipient except for Israel.
   Congress conditioned delivery of the $230 million in cash
payments on unspecified reforms in the way Egypt administers the
aid. A decision to resume was taken coincide with the visit here
last week of President Hosni Mubarak.
   In response to a reporter's question, the State Department press
office issued a statement quoting President Bush as saying Mubarak
``enjoys our full support as he implements courageous reform
measures to strengthen Egypt's economy for future generations.''
   The statement added: ``Our cash transfer assistance will be part
of that support. We will be consulting with Congress and working
out the details of the release of the money in cooperation with the
Egyptian government.''
   Aid to Israel and to Egypt was boosted after the two countries
signed a peace treaty in 1979. Since then, the United States has
been liberal in assisting the two countries as its most reliable
friends in the Middle East. The aid also is a subtle way of
encouraging Israel and Egypt to support U.S. foreign policy in the
region.
   At the moment, the Bush administration is backing a proposal by
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to hold elections among the
1.4 million Palestinian Arabs who live on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Mubarak has called instead for an international peace conference
and said the Palestine Liberation Organization should participate.
But Mubarak has not rejected the proposal categorically.
   The Arab League, of which Egypt is a member, and the PLO both
rejected the proposal this week. On Tuesday, the State Department
asked all critics to withhold judgment until the proposal is
developed.
   The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no
direct appeal was made to the PLO, with which the United States
opened talks last December over Israel's objections. The official
said another meeting with the PLO will be held but not for several
days at least.
   Egypt has one of the most cumbersome bureaucracies in the world
as well as a booming birth rate. An estimated 1 million people are
added to Egypt's population every 10{ months. There is widespread
poverty and housing is at a premium.
   Mubarak, during his visit, told American businessmen his
government was making progress in cutting red tape and in curbing
population growth. But he said the effort was partly offset by a
decline in the death rate.

<HEAD>Activist Says Wheat Outlook Shaky, and Looking Worse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer advocate said Wednesday that the
U.S. wheat outlook is so shaky that the United States should
suspend further export subsidies until the situation improves.
   Rodney E. Leonard, executive director of the private, non-profit
Community Nutrition Institute, said he wrote Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter on April 3 to repeat a similar request made last
fall, ``when the situation was less precarious'' and steps ``could
have been taken to safeguard supplies.''
   The target of Leonard's complaint is the Export Enhancement
Program, which subsidizes the sale of wheat and other commodities
to selected foreign countries. Huge sales of wheat to China and the
Soviet Union have been made under the program since the arrangement
was authorized by Congress in the 1985 farm law.
   Yeutter said this week the program had helped significantly in
getting agricultural trade discussions moving under the current
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   But Yeutter also said in an interview with a group of reporters
on Monday that the subsidy program would be reviewed to see how
effective it has been and whether ``too much or too little'' is
being spent on it.
   Leonard said that the condition of the winter wheat crop is
deteriorating and that experts in the Agriculture Department and in
the major production areas point to a harvest this year of about
1.6 billion bushels. A spring wheat output of 600 million bushels
would make a total U.S. wheat harvest of about 2.2 billion bushels.
   If wheat use in the 1989-90 marketing year, which will begin
June 1, totals in the range of 2.4 billion to 2.5 billion bushels,
this year's harvest would fall short of meeting demand.
   In that case, Leonard said in his letter to Yeutter, at least
200 million bushels of wheat will have to be drawn from existing
stocks, which are estimated by the Agriculture Department to be
drawn down to 549 million bushels by June 1.
   Thus, he said, the U.S. wheat stockpile by June 1, 1990, could
well be down to around 300 million bushels. According to department
records, that would be the the smallest U.S. wheat reserve at the
end of a marketing year since 1952, when it was 256 million bushels.
   ``This is hardly adequate as a domestic reserve, and will leave
the U.S. unable to intervene if famine conditions develop anywhere
in the world,'' Leonard said. ``The (United Nations) Food and
Agriculture Organization ... a month ago said that world grain
stocks will be drawn down again in 1989-90 for the third year in a
row.''
   Leonard added: ``In effect, FAO does not expect food grain
production to increase significantly in any of the major
food-producing areas outside the U.S.''
   The department's first official estimate of 1989 winter wheat
production, which usually accounts for three-fourths of the U.S.
total, will be released May 11.
   Meanwhile, department analysts have used unofficial projections
showing that the 1989 wheat harvest could be as low as 2.3 billion
bushels, or slightly more than Leonard's benchmark.
   The biggest problem is in major areas of the Great Plains,
particularly in Kansas, the No. 1 wheat producer, where soils have
been parched since the crop was planted last fall.
   Yeutter is scheduled to tour some of the Kansas wheat area on
Friday, his office said. There has been congressional pressure on
the department to extend 1988 drought relief to the stricken winter
wheat farmers.

<HEAD>Soviet Lawyer Asks for Review of New Decree on Subversion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading lawyer called Wednesday for the Supreme
Court to review a new law on subversion, saying it may conflict
with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost.
   The decree appears to be aimed in part at stopping nationalist
unrest like that in the republic of Georgia. It bans premeditated
acts aimed at inciting nationalist or racial animosity and actions
aimed at undermining the Soviet political and economic systems.
   Many dissidents have said the decree restricts freedom of speech
and other human rights, but the criticism by Alexander M. Yakovlev
was the first made publicly by a Soviet lawyer.
   Yakovlev, a department head at the Institute of State and Law,
made the remarks at a news conference and in an article published
Wednesday in the weekly newspaper Moscow News.
   He said that in general, the decree was an improvement over
earlier regulations banning ``anti-Soviet agitation and
propaganda'' and ``anti-Soviet slander.'' Those rules have been
used to jail dissidents.
   However, the lawyer said a section in the new rules on
``discrediting'' government bodies should be clarified.
   The clause says ``publicly insulting or discrediting''
government or state bodies or officials can be punishable by up to
three years in prison or a fine of up to $3,200.
   Yakovlev said his institute, part of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences, had drafted the decree. However, he said it was surprised
by the clause.
   ``The regulation on insulting and discrediting was just as much
news for us as for you,'' he told reporters.
   The lawyer said he did not know who inserted it into the decree,
which was approved Saturday by the Presidium, or executive council,
of the Supreme Soviet. The decree took effect Monday and will be
reviewed later by the full legislature, which can make changes,
Yakovlev said.
   Yakovlev suggested the discrediting rule might conflict with
glasnost, Gorbachev's policy of openness, because people should
have the right to criticize their government.
   Yakovlev called for ``urgent authoritative clarification'' of
the clause by the Supreme Court. The court can overturn the decree
and send it back for revision if it is deemed unconstitutional.
   ``If an organ is discredited by true information that is
revealed and objectively a loss of faith occurs as a result of
unconstitutional, illegal or criminal actions, in that sense there
can be no moral or criminal reproach,'' Yakovlev said.
   Another lawyer at the news conference, Felix M. Reshetnikov of
the All-Union Research Institute on Soviet Legislation, said the
decree should have banned only false accusations.

   Sales of U.S. savings bonds increased 3.2
percent in March to $713 million, the government reported Wednesday.
   The Treasury Department said sales for the first six months of
fiscal 1989, which began last October, totaled $4.02 billion, up
9.5 percent from the comparable period a year earlier.
   Effective last Nov. 1 through April 30, bonds held five years or
longer earn at an annual rate of 7.35 percent for the six months,
up from 6.9 percent during the previous six months.
   On May 1, a new rate will take effect based on open market
interest rates.
   As of March 31, the total value of savings bonds held by
Americans was $112.16 billion.

   The dropout rate for public school students has
leveled off over the past few years, according to statistics
released Wednesday.
   Figures from the Board of Education for the 1987-88 school year
show the four-year dropout rate for high school students was 26.8
percent and the systemwide percentage was 29.7.
   These are up slightly from the year before when the high school
rate was 26.3 percent and the systemwide figure was 29.2 percent.
   A separate study that followed individuals for their four years
of high school ending in 1988 said 20.8 percent of the students had
dropped out. In 1987, this study said 22.4 percent of students quit.
   Schools Chancellor Richard Green said more funding is needed for
dropout prevention programs.
   The studies use separate methodologies to determine the dropout
rate. The Cohort Report follows students for four years after they
enter ninth grade and the Annual Dropout Report analyzes the
students who dropped out during 1987-88.
   The Annual Dropout Report also offers a racial and ethnic
breakdown and showed that the dropout rate among Hispanic students
was significantly higher than the average.
   It said the four-year, systemwide dropout rate among Hispanic
students was 31.8 percent; for blacks, 24.5 percent; whites, 19.2
percent; and Asians, 15.2 percent.

<HEAD>Council Finds No Compelling Need for Commercially Developed Platform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has no compelling need for a
commercially developed space platform proposed for use before a
larger planned space station is put into orbit, the National
Research Council has concluded.
   A report by the council, released Tuesday, was based on a study
by a panel of scientists and engineers.
   Its recommendations were counter to the proposal by the Reagan
administration for heavy federal support for the commercial space
platform. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had
opposed the proposed venture as a possible competitor with its own
space station to be put in orbit by 1996.
   The report said there was no compelling need for a separate,
commercially developed facility for the conduct of research at low
or zero gravity before then.
   It said use of the space shuttle flights ``will accommodate the
vast majority of anticipated experiments'' planned by NASA in the
interim.
   It said after the space station is built, however, construction
of another facility for long-term microgravity experiments ``may
well have merit'' if there are advances in microgravity research
and space automation.
   The report said the committee ``found no evidence to suggest
that microgravity research would lead to significant space-based
manufacturing in the next five to 10 years.''
   ``The committee considers that microgravity science is at an
immature stage due to lack of understanding of the fundamental
processes involved in this area of space research,'' the report
said.
   The Reagan administration's 1988 space policy recommended
support for an orbiting spacecraft for microgravity research which
would be owned and operated by private business rather than NASA.
The federal government would be its main user, however, and would
lease as much as 70 percent of the facility at a cost estimated at
more than $700 million over five years.
   The proposal for the private platform was developed by Space
Industries Inc., of Houston, run by former NASA engineers and
astronauts. It said its space platform could be launched as early
as 1992.
   NASA requested the council study the scientific and commercial
benefits of the proposal. The council is an arm of the National
Academy of Sciences.

   Saying ``hail to the victors'' and neatly
sinking a free-throw shot in the Rose Garden, President Bush on
Wednesday honored the University of Michigan for winning the NCAA
basketball championship.
   ``Today America is talking, and they're talking about you all,
and your incredible championship, and they're calling it Wolverine
Wonder, or the Michigan Miracle, or basketball's impossible
dream,'' Bush said. ``The 1989 Wolverines indeed had it all, depth
and quickness, shooting and intelligence, and that strength of
character which embody the champion.''
   The Wolverines won the NCAA basketball championship a week ago
Monday against Seton Hall, as junior guard Rumeal Robinson sank two
free throws in the final seconds of overtime for the 80-79 victory.
   ``Today, `Hail to the Victors' is the number one basketball hit
parade song,'' Bush said. ``Mission impossible? Yours has been a
mission accomplished.''
   A portable basketball hoop had been set up in the White House
Rose Garden, and Bush escorted Robinson over to demonstrate his
skill. ``Now this may not be regulation,'' Bush said as Robinson
sighted on the basket, removed is coat, and lofted the ball in.
   Next it was Bush's turn. He sank his free throw the first try.
   Michigan Coach Steve Fisher on behalf of the university's
basketball staff gave Bush a ``Michigan No. 1'' jersey.
   ``I think the pride that surrounds this city and White House is
indicative of what all of us strive for, to be champions and to be
number one,'' Fisher told reporters after the ceremony. ``We feel
fortunate, but proud, that the hard effort and work that we put in
allowed us to be here.''

   A document introduced at Oliver North's
Iran-Contra trial strengthens the suggestion that then-Vice
President George Bush knew Honduras was being rewarded for its
support of the Nicaraguan rebels with additional U.S. aid.
   A National Security Council draft memo bears the handwritten
notation, ``We want VP to also discuss this matter'' with Honduran
President Roberto Suazo.
   The handwriting in the margin of the Feb. 20, 1985 document is
next to a typewritten section of the memo detailing the quid pro
quo arrangement.
   Bush had earlier warned against the possibility of such
arrangements, according to another document released earlier in
North's trial _ the minutes of a June 25, 1985 meeting of the
National Security Planning Group.
   Bush had said there could be a problem if the administration
used U.S. aid to entice third countries to aid the Contras.
   The congressional Iran-Contra investigating committees looked
into the possibility the administration had engaged in such
arrangements but were unable to prove they existed.
   Asked about the new documents coming to light at North's trial,
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said today that all
the documents had been made available to the independent counsel
prosecuting North for his review in the past.
   It is up to the counsel to decide whether to turn them over to
the investigating committees, Fitzwater said. He said the White
House was not investigating any of the matters.
   A 42-page summary of the Reagan administration's quid pro quo
arrangements with other countries on Contra support was released
last week.
   It said Bush met with Suazo and told him about enhanced U.S. aid
shortly after the quid pro quo arrangement with Honduras was made.
But the summary did not say whether Bush knew the enhanced aid was
in exchange for the Central American country's support of the
Contras.

   A jury rejected a comatose man's
hand-squeeze identification of his attackers and acquitted two men
in his beating death.
   The jury late Tuesday found Gerald L. Scott, 26, and Elonzia
Armstrong Jr., 25, innocent of murder, manslaughter and robbery in
an attack on 47-year-old Robert Abreu outside a tavern Oct. 4.
Abreu died nine days after the attack.
   Abreu could not speak or open his eyes the day after the
beating, but police Investigator Timothy Chura testified that
during a hospital visit Abreu squeezed his hand when Chura named
Scott, Armstrong and a third man who was never charged.
   A neurologist called by the defense testified that Abreu could
not have been able to communicate because he was in a coma. The
neurologist said the squeeze was more likely a ``grasp reflex''
common among comatose patients.

   A House subcommittee on Wednesday approved a
bill to reorganize the Consumer Product Safety Commission and
require studies, reports and decisions affecting a variety of
products ranging from cigarette lighters to reclining chairs.
   The bill was sent to the Energy and Commerce Committee by the on
commerce, consumer protection and competitiveness subcommittee on a
voice vote after rejecting an amendment that would have renewed the
commission's basic laws without change.
   Congress has been unable to agree on such a renewal since 1983,
and the commission has operated under automatic year-to-year
renewals granted by appropriations bills. Last year, the parent
committee approved a bill almost identical to the one passed by the
subcommittee Wednesday, but it was too late in the session for the
House to act.
   Among major changes that would be made by the bill is the
designation of two members as a quorum when there are only three
members. Although the commission is authorized to have five
members, Congress in recent years has appropriated money for only
three salaries, and a current vacancy means the commission cannot
act at all because the quorum requirement is now three.
   The bill would require among other things:
   _A study of flammability standards for pajamas and nightgowns
used by the elderly.
   _A study of age requirements for operating amusement park rides.
   _A survey of reclining chairs for compliance with existing
standards.
   _A report to Congress on what the commission is doing about
indoor air pollution.
   _The adoption of a standard for lighters to protect children.
   The bill would also give state attorneys general the same power
as the commission has to bring suits in federal courts and would
permit consumers to petition for safety rules, with a 120-day
deadline for action on such petitions.
   The bill is backed by major consumer organizations but opposed
by major business groups.
   The author of the defeated amendment for a straightforward
renewal, Rep. Howard C. Nielson, R-Utah, said, ``I don't think
there is any evidence the commission is not doing its job and I am
particularly alarmed at the budget increase'' the bill would
authorize.
   The bill would set a ceiling on appropriations of $39 million
next year and $40 million the year after. Nielson's amendment would
have set ceilings of $34 million and $35 million; the Bush
administration has recommended an appropriation of $33.5 million,
down from $34.5 million this year.
   Deaths caused by products under the commission's jurisdiction
have fallen from about 26,000 in 1975 to 22,000 in 1984, ``and the
per capita decline has been more dramatic'' because the population
has grown, Nielson said.
   ``I don't think it's fair to the commission to put so many
things in it (the bill) they can't handle,'' he said.

   President Bush today abruptly canceled a
three-day vacation trip to Kennebunkport, Maine, that was to have
started Thursday.
   Despite the cancellation, Bush still will make a scheduled trip
to Union, N.J., on Thursday for a speech. He will return to
Washington the same day.
   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the president wanted to be
in town because budget negotiations between Congress and the
administration were at a critical point, with both sides shooting
for an agreement by Saturday.
   He said personal matters also were involved.
   Anna Perez, press secretary to Barbara Bush, said the first
lady's health was not a factor in the decision. Mrs. Bush underwent
radiation treatment to destroy her thyroid gland today because it
is producing excess levels of hormones.
   Ms. Perez said Bush's son, Jeb and his wife Columba, are flying
to Washington from Florida and that other family members may come
in.
   ``The kids are going to be in town and it occurred to them, `Why
are we going at all?''' Ms. Perez said.
   Dozens of hotel rooms have been booked for press and White House
staff members in Kennebunkport for the trip, which was to have run
from Thursday to Sunday. Bush also had planned meetings with
schoolteachers and firemen in Kennbunkport.

   At least 23 people died and
thousands were left homeless Wednesday in rains that pounded
northeast Brazil, rescue officials said.
   Downpours left 19 dead in the coastal city of Joao Pessoa, 1,614
miles northeast of Rio in the state of Paraiba, Fire Department
official Luis Jose da Silva told The Associated Press by telephone.
   All of the victims were from two shantytowns on the city's
outskirts and were killed when their homes collapsed, da Silva said.
   ``Rescue workers are still at the shantytowns digging through
the mud, and we're sure there'll be more victims,'' da Silva said.
   The rains, which began a week ago, had already killed six other
residents of the city.
   In Recife, capital of the neighboring state of Pernambuoco, four
family members were killed in a slum neighborhood when their home
collapsed early Wednesday, according to Civil Defense coordinator
Col. Edvaldo Cunha Cavalcante.
   Cavalcante said about 200 families left homeless by the rains
were being housed in publc buildings in Recife and that another 300
families throughout the state were being given emergency shelter.

   President Bush, calling for ``definitive
ethical standards'' in government, today proposed tightening
conflict-of-interest rules through such restrictions as bans on
honoraria for judges and on personal use of congressional campaign
funds.
   In a wide-ranging package covering activities by executive
branch employees as well as judges and Congress, Bush proposed
changes in the campaign finance laws.
   He said current law that allows lawmakers to convert campaign
funds to personal use should be abandoned because leftover
political donations ``should not become a kind of individual
retirement account for members of Congress.''
   The law now allows anyone who held office before 1980 to use
leftover campaign contributions for any lawful purpose, including
personal use.
   The president also called for elimination of campaign
contributions by special-interest political action committees.
   ``We've allowed our parties to become weakened and overshadowed
by special interests ... and I believe we should eliminate
contributions to candidates by PACs,'' he said.
   His announcement today was an attempt to fulfill his pledge to
bring higher ethical standards to government.
   ``You're never going to legislate away impropriety,'' Bush said
in a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors convention
where he announced the proposals. ``But these values in ethics can
be encouraged, respected.''
   In a question session with the ASNE members, Bush said he still
considers Oliver North, the former National Security Council aide,
a national hero because ``anybody that gets a Purple Heart, sheds
his blood fighting for his couuntry, deserves to be called an
American hero.''
   But he said, ``the last thing I want to do is intervene'' in the
ongoing case in which North is standing trial on charges he lied to
Congress and destroyed government documents in the Iran-Contra case.
   Bush also said in answer to a question that the reason he is
friendly and social with reporters is not to ``seduce'' them into
favorable coverage.
   ``We're treating them as human beings ... I want to treat the
press with the dignity to which it is entitled.''
   In a message to Congress accompanying his ethics package, the
president said, ``The proposals represent an effort to communicate
definitive ethical standards to federal employees throughout our
government.''
   Bush's package included an executive order to cover executive
branch employees and a legislative proposal to give judges a 25
percent pay raise, coupled with the honoraria ban for judges.
   An honoraria ban already applies to executive branch officials,
and in his speech the president said he wants to extend it to
Congress. However, he did not include such a package in the
largislative package, saying he wanted to take it up at a future
time in connection with a congressional pay raise.
   Bush's decision not to propose a congressional honoraria ban
prompted criticism that he is letting Congress off easy, by not
seeking to bar the speaking fees that enrich lawmakers' $89,500
annual salaries.
   Fred Wertheimer, president of the civic action group Common
Cause, said Bush ``caved in to pressure by members of Congress who
want to keep this corrupt system going. He knows better and it
appears the president doesn't have the courage of his convictions.''
   Common Cause supports a pay raise for Congress and opposes all
honoraria on the ground they promote excessive influence by the
special interest groups that pay members of Congress for speeches.
   Bush's Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform, in its report
March 10, endorsed a ban on honoraria for all three branches of
government.
   The president backed a 51 percent pay raise previously, but
Congress itself voted against giving its members a raise this year.
   While turning down the congressional honoraria recommendation,
Bush is accepted a commission recommendation to bar members of
Congress members and senior personnel in the judicial and
congressional branches who leave the government from lobbying their
former offices for one year. Executive branch employees already are
subject to such a ban.
   The commission was created by Bush to recommend changes in
government ethics rules. It reviewed matters such as outside
income, conflicts of interest, financial disclosure and
post-employment lobbying.
   In the order covering the executive branch, Bush barred senior
government officials from serving on the boards of profit-making
enterprises. He proposed that the ban be extended to congressional
and judicial officials as well.
   The executive order also would give elevated rank to a
designated ethics officer in each department, and would do away
with ``compartmentalization'' of the various agencies of the
executive branch for purpose of lobbying after working for the
government.
   That means that executive branch workers, currently barred for a
year from lobbying their former office once they leave the
government, would be under the same restriction regarding all the
departments of the executive branch.
   Full-time presidential appointees, White House employees and
Office of Policy Development employees also would be barred from
receiving any outside income.

   The Defense Department has increased to more
than 8,100 the number of military-base sites being surveyed for
hazardous substances and pollution, according to a report send to
Congress on Wednesday.
   Actual cleanup work is going much more slowly, however. By the
end of the past fiscal year, the Pentagon had projects under way at
more than 1,260 polluted sites.
   The report, covering the year ending last Sept. 30, cites the
jump in sites undergoing preliminary surveys as a development that
demonstrates a Pentagon commitment to restoring polluted areas
under military control.
   ``The Department of Defense made significant progress during
fiscal 1988,'' the report says.
   It covers the efforts of Pentagon agencies and the military
services to comply with a section of the Superfund law of 1986 that
expanded the Defense Environmental Restoration Program.
   That program received $404 million in fiscal 1988.
   According to the report, 8,139 sites at 897 military
installations had been identified for surveys by the end of the
fiscal year to determine if a cleanup was needed. The totals at the
end of the previous year had been 5,165 sites at 739 installations.
   The Pentagon attributed the jump to a desire to check
``primarily smaller installations such as National Guard and
Reserve properties'' after it had completed reviews of large, known
problem areas around the country.
   The report further discloses that more than 4,400 sites have
been moved into the next phase of the program, in which a more
in-depth investigation is conducted and cleanup alternatives
considered. That work has been completed only at about 1,500 of the
sites, however.
   The third and final phase of the program _ actual cleanups _ is
still moving at a relatively slow pace, the report indicates. As of
the end of the fiscal year, actual cleanup work and ``remedial
actions'' had been completed at 216 polluted sites _ a net gain of
90 compared to fiscal 1987.
   Cleanup work is under way at 1,266 other sites, the report
states.

   A barge carrying the mammoth reactor
vessel from the nation's first commercial nuclear plant completed
an 8,000-mile trip today to Washington state, where it will be
buried at the Hanford nuclear complex.
   Protesters hurled paint canisters and unfurled banners as the
reactor vessel from the dismantled Shippingport, Pa., nuclear plant
made its way up the Columbia River in six-week journey that took it
through the Panama Canal.
   The barge arrived at a dock on the edge of Richland. The reactor
vessel will be trucked 25 miles to the burial trench where it will
be entombed Friday.
   Hanford, the government nuclear weapons complex, already is the
final resting place for three nuclear submarine reactor cores.
   The 1,000-ton reactor vessel, 45 feet high and 18 feet across,
once held the uranium fuel that powered the nation's first
commercial nuclear plant, which shut down in 1982.
   The vessel was packed with concrete for the journey, and
officials said it poses no threat of radiation.
   As the barge made its way up the Columbia River Gorge on
Tuesday, 50 to 70 protesters on a bridge waved banners and signs
and hurled canisters of lime green paint.
   At least three small containers of paint were hurled from the
bridge. One struck the gray cover of the reactor vessel and two
others hit the barge.
   ``We're trying to show that the local community in the gorge is
not thrilled to be a nuclear highway,'' said Cyndi deBruler of
Bingen, an organizer of the demonstration.
   Earlier Tuesday, a fire broke out in the engine room of the
tugboat pushing the barge, causing a seven-hour delay but no
injuries, said Wendy Anderson of the company that owns the tug.
   ``At no time was there any danger of the reactor vessel going
aground,'' she said.
   But Ms. DeBruler said the fire showed the potential for danger.
``If there were 60 mph winds, and it was powerless, it could lead
to an accident,'' she said.
   The protesters said their main concern with the vessel is
leakage into the river after it is buried.

<HEAD>`No Comment' on Report of Japanese Concessions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The White House declined to comment Wednesday
on a published report that Japan has agreed to allow 40 percent of
the work on a new, co-produced jet fighter to be done in the United
States.
   The New York Times, citing an unidentified Bush administration
official, said Wednesday that Japan has also eased its reluctance
to share technology from the FSX fighter venture.
   The newspaper said the concessions signaled that the deal would
shortly be sent to Congress, where critics have said the project
could amount to a U.S. giveaway of much-needed aircraft technology
to Japan's aircraft industry.
   Asked about the status of the FSX negotiations with Japan, White
House spokesman Bill Harlow said:
   ``I don't have anything new on it. As far as I know, it's still
under discussion. Nothing is resolved at this point.''
   Another U.S. official, who spoke on condition that he not be
identified, said he found the Times story ``a little bit premature.
Things are close, but not quite there yet.''
   Shingo Yamagami, press counselor at the Japanese Embassy, also
declined to comment on the Times story. He said U.S. and Japanese
officials ``are still continuing their discussions about
clarifications. We haven't reached any final conclusion yet.''
   The United States and Japan reached an agreement in principle
late last year under which St. Louis-based General Dynamics would
join with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to co-develop and
co-produce a next-generation fighter, for deployment by Japan in
the late 1990s.
   The project to build the FSX, which would be an advanced version
of the F-16 fighter, has been stalled due to the Bush
administration's decision to obtain ``clarifications'' from the
Japanese.
   Proponents argue that the agreement represents the best the
United States could negotiate _ in view of Japanese opposition to
buying American-made F-16s _ and will promote beneficial technology
transfer in both directions while providing income and jobs for
U.S. companies.
   Critics, however, contend that the deal amounts to a giveaway of
$7 billion worth of technology that Japan likely will use to help
propel its aircraft industry into head-to-head competition with the
United States. They say Japan should, instead, purchase American
planes to help offset the $50 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan.

   The Duchess of York says she's hurt by public
criticism that she takes too many vacations and does too little
work, but doesn't care what people say about her clothes.
   In an interview with Yorkshire Television to be broadcast
Sunday, the duchess said she calls on ``inner strength and
control'' to ignore criticism and get on with her job. ``I am
sensitive and I do get hurt,'' she said.
   The duchess, who was known as Sarah Ferguson before her marriage
to Prince Andrew, described him as ``the most incredible husband''
and said their infant daughter, Princess Beatrice, has ``enhanced
our lives.''
   A recent survey of public engagements carried out by members of
the royal family placed the duchess and her husband, Queen
Elizabeth II's second oldest son, near the bottom.
   The 29-year-old duchess said that when people claim she takes
too many vacations, ``My immediate reaction is `if only they knew.'
''
   The duchess said she's not bothered by frequent criticism of her
fashion sense.
   ``My clothes and what I look like, really that's entirely up to
me ... Andrew likes it and I like it and if no one else does, well
that's their problem.''

   Michigan would have an official state soil
to nourish its official state tree and state flower under
legislation passed Wednesday by the state Senate.
   The bill, approved 25-8 and sent to the House, would honor the
Kalkaska soil series. The sandy soil, one of about 450 soil types,
is located across both peninsulas and covers 500,000 acres of the
state's 35 million acres.
   The soil type is named for Kalkaska County, where it first was
found by state soil researchers in 1927. The soil is practically
exclusive to Michigan, with only a small amount found in northern
Wisconsin.
   ``It is a very pretty soil, with distinct layers of dark and
light,'' said Sen. Connie Binsfeld, a Republican who represents _
no surprise here _ Kalkaska County. ``Our state tree, the white
pine, is found in Kalkaska soil.''
   The bill provoked the inevitable jokes: ``A real dirty, rotten
filthy piece of legislation,'' said Sen. Mich Irwine.
   Some lawmakers expressed concerns about approving legislation
that voters could regard as trivial. But at least none proposed an
official state manure to fertilize the state soil.
   For the record, Michigan's state flower is the apple blossom.

   When a book was returned to the
Crystal Lake Public Library 22 years late and worse for wear,
librarians had no complaints. Four $100 bills fluttered out, more
than enough to pay the fine.
   ``The book's a bit shabby, but it's back home again,'' Librarian
Arden Perkins said Tuesday.
   The book, titled `The Folk Song Abecedary'' by James F. Leisy,
arrived at the library in a plain brown wrapper last week.
   Folded inside was a note from the anonymous borrower.
   ``This book was removed from your library several years ago. I
am returning it with overdue fines and apologies,'' the note said.
   Ms. Perkins said that based on the 5-cent-per-day fine the
library levies for overdue books, this one must have been checked
out 22 years ago, shortly after it was put on the shelves.
   Circulation records are not kept that long, so the only clues to
the whereabouts of the borrower is the postmark from De Kalb, Ill.,
and the book being wrapped in the De Kalb Chronicle.
   Ms. Perkins said the library only would have required the
borrower to pay the value of a book, plus $3, but will treat the
$400 as a gift.

   Hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi was
wanted for murder in Lebanon two years before his 1985 seizure of a
TWA jetliner, according to a police document presented Wednesday at
his trial.
   Lebanese police sent the document in response to a request from
West German federal police for information on Hamadi following his
arrest in January 1987.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and air
piracy in the June 1985 hijacking of TWA Flight 847. Thirty-nine
Americans were held hostage for 17 days and U.S. Navy diver Robert
Stethem was killed.
   Hamadi admitted taking part in the hijacking but denied shooting
Stethem. He was arrested at Frankfurt airport when customs
officials discovered liquid explosives in his luggage.
   The document read in court said a Lebanese arrest warrant was
issued for Hamadi in July 1983 for ``murder and illegal possession
of weapons.'' It gave no details.
   Hamadi, who lived in West Germany from 1982 to 1984, told the
court he knew nothing about it. It was not clear if the warrant is
current.
   ``I have been carrying weapons since 1979 with the permission of
west Beirut authorities,'' he said. Since the civil war broke out
in 1975, the Lebanese capital's western part is policed by Moslem
militias and the eastern sector by Christian forces.
   Hamadi said the arrest warrant may have been issued by Christian
authorities. He has testified he fought in battles in Lebanon
before and after his stay in West Germany.
   He also has testified that he belonged to Amal, a mainstream
Shiite Moslem militia, from 1980 to 1982. He has denied prosecution
charges he later joined Hezbollah, a radical Shiite group backed by
Iran.
   The court also was read five letters Hamadi wrote from the
Frankfurt prison after his arrest. Prison authorities apparently
intercepted them after Hamadi tried to have them smuggled out.
   In one letter, Hamadi appeared to solicit the help of his
brother, Abdul-Hadi, who is Hezbollah's security chief in Beirut.
   Several times Hamadi advises Abdul-Hadi to be ``very careful.''
   ``They are asking me about you all the time and they have found
out that I am with Hezbollah,'' one letter says.
   Hamadi confirmed he wrote the letters but refused to answer any
questions about them.
   In several letters, he discussed worries he would be extradited
to the United States.
   Washington requested his extradition but the West German
government refused. The trial resumes April 19, when Chief Judge
Heiner Mueckenberger says he hopes to have the final presentation
of evidence.

   A Soviet-born Israeli was sentenced to three
years in prison Wednesday for passing army secrets to the Palestine
Liberation Organization, Israel radio said.
   Benjamin Shenkman, 36, was convicted March 30 of giving
information to the organization, which Israel considers a terrorist
group. He also was convicted of having contacts with PLO agents.
   The maximum sentence for the charges was 33 years, but the
prosecution agreed to a shorter sentence because Shenkman confessed
and aided police investigators.
   Shenkman told the Tel Aviv court he traveled to Athens three
times in 1988 and gave PLO officials information on his military
service, including locations of bases and the names of his
commanders.
   He also offered to fly to PLO headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia,
and hold a news conference where he was to tear up his passport and
denounce Israel as a racist state.
   He asked for $1.5 million in return but never received any
money. He was arrested at Israel's Ben-Gurion airport when he
returned from his third visit to Athens.
   Shenkman immigrated to Israel in 1978 from the Soviet Union and
served in the army for four months in 1985.
   His was the second case of espionage involving a Soviet emigre.
On Dec. 15, 1988, Shabtai Kalmanovich, 45, was sentenced to nine
years in prison on charges of spying for the Soviet Union and
having contacts with a foreign agent.

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's
remarks Wednesday to the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
   Bush: Thank you all very much. (Applause.)
   John, thank you.
   Please.
   Well, I'm delighted to be here and look forward to taking a few
questions.
   I've been getting such a ribbing about my highly stylized prose,
I thought it only appropriate for me to share a few recent
headlines with you. (Laughter.)
   I'm sure nobody here would write things like this, but _
(scattered laughter) _ ``Dentist Receives Plaque,'' that was one,
but _ (laughs) _ no _ (laughter).
   ``Actor Sent to Jail for Not Finishing Sentence.'' (Laughter.)
   And, ``The Rest of the Year May Not Follow January.'' (Laughter.)
   I'm tempted to gloat.
   If that's the standard, I'm not doing too bad. (Laughter.)
   Adlai Stevenson said, ``An editor is a person who separates the
wheat from the chaff and prints the chaff.'' (Laughter.)
   So I know I'm probably responsible for providing my fair share
of chaff, but after all, I am the guy that said during the
campaign, ``a kitchen in every pot'' _ (laughter) _ and also that
America's freedom _ I was reminded by some of these back here _
``America's freedom is the example by which the world expires.''
   So _ (laughter) _ let no one miss the message, as editors, you
uphold a certain ethical standard in your newsrooms, and you've got
to do that, because a newspaper is only as good as its word.
   And I think this is no less true than government.
   High ethical standards are central to this administration, and
we're going to enforce them strictly, comprehensively, fairly, and
to the letter and spirit of the law.
   And we've got to work together to reform a public code of
conduct that, at times, appears to be in disarray.
   And it's not logical or fair code _ it's both too harsh and too
lenient, and it elevates detail over substance, precept over
principle.
   And so today, I want to talk to you about some proposals of our
administration, because such a system as now constituted,
ultimately breeds cynicism and contempt for the law.
   To truly reform it, we must remember that standards of trust and
honesty are not dictated from regulations written in Washington,
D.C.
   Ethics in public service derive from the natural integrity of
the American people.
   They are to be found in the everyday conduct of working men and
women _ in the postman who checks out the _ checking up on the
elderly resident at home, or _ and the cashier who runs after the
customer that's been overcharged.
   The millions of Americans who meet their obligations honestly,
and teach their kids to do it the same way, see nothing
extraordinary about asking the same of their government.
   The American people are troubled when they hear of officials in
every branch of government, at whatever level of government, who
show a brazen contempt for the letter or spirit of the law.
   And the American people do not understand why certain behavior
is considered criminal when committed by an executive branch
official, or perfectly legal when committed by someone in another
branch of government.
   Is not a crime a crime?
   Should there not be an underlying standard of integrity for all?
   And as president-elect, I heard about talented men and women,
who, though perfectly honest, declined to _ declined to come to
serve in government out of fear; fear of the sheer complexity of
federal ethics laws, fear that a simple, honest mistake could lead
to a public nightmare.
   And these concerns led me to issue an executive order creating
the President's Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform.
   And I asked its members to recommend steps to foster full
confidence in the integrity of all federal public officials and
employees.

<HEAD>Budget Negotiators Say Agreement Near</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional budget negotiators expressed
confidence Wednesday that agreement with the White House was near
on a $28 billion deficit reduction plan for next year.
   ``The parameters are there. The outline of an agreement is
there,'' said Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee.
   The negotiating group, which includes Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, White House budget director Richard Darman, and the
senior members of the House and Senate budget committees, was
checking its own ideas with people who would have to approve them.
   ``When you do a budget, there are a whole lot of numbers and
agreements to put together in which you have to gain the complete
cooperation of a lot of people in Congress other than the
negotiators. So you have to run around and talk to all your
friends'' on various committees, said Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn.,
senior Republican on the House Budget Committee.
   ``We have not hit anything that could be called a snag,'' said
Rep. Thomas Foley, D-Wash., the House Majority Leader.
   In more than a month of talks, the group has been searching for
a compromise that would reduce the fiscal 1990 federal deficit by
about $28 billion, to comply with the Gramm-Rudman law's goal of
limiting red ink to $100 billion.
   About half of the savings would come from holding spending
growth below inflation for military and many domestic programs, and
the other half from new revenues _ user fees, sales of government
assets, and about $5 billion in new taxes.
   President Bush's budget included about the same amount of new
revenues, but mostly from his proposal to cut the tax rate on
capital gains. A lower tax rate on capital gains would actually
yield additional revenue of $4.8 billion next year, according to
the administration.
   Congressional Democrats oppose the capital gains plan as a break
for the wealthy, but the negotiators have agreed to include the
overall tax figure in their plan in hopes that Congress and the
president can agree later on something that won't violate Bush's
``no new taxes'' pledge.
   The House Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative
lawmakers, on Wednesday approved a resolution opposing any new
taxes in the pact.

   Sugar Ray Robinson, a five-time
middleweight champion considered by many boxing experts to be the
greatest pound-for-pound fighter ever, died today at age 67.
   Robinson died at Brotman Medical Center. No details on the cause
of death were immediately given, but Sports Illustrated reported in
1987 that Robinson suffered from Alzheimer's disease as well as
diabetes and hypertension.
   ``It appears to be of natural causes,'' said Los Angeles County
coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher. The coroner's office was
involved because it had been some time since Robinson had seen his
doctor, Dambacher said.
   Robinson, born Walker Smith in Detroit, won the welterweight
title in 1946. He went on to win the middleweight title an
unprecedented five times from 1951, when he knocked out Jake
LaMotta, to 1958, when he beat Carmen Basilio.
   He lost only 19 of his 200 professional fights.
   Judy Davis, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said Robinson was
brought to the emergency room by paramedics at 9:55 a.m.,
accompanied by his wife, Millie. He was pronounced dead at 10:09
a.m., Dambacher said.
   Ms. Davis declined to describe Robinson's symptoms. The hospital
had reported Robinson's age as 63, but boxing references list the
boxer's age as 67.
   ``We will be investigating the circumstances surrounding his
demise and taking care of the cause and manner of death,''
Dambacher said. ``It does not appear at this time there will be an
autopsy. We will know more tomorrow.''
   In Las Vegas, boxing promoter Bob Arum said Robinson had been in
poor health for some time.
   He called Robinson ``the best fighter ever'' and ``an absolute
master in the ring.''
   Former heavyweight champion Larry Holmes, reached by telephone
in Philadelphia, described Robinson as a pioneer and ``the greatest
little fighter that I've known.''

<HEAD>Critics Blast Cble TV Operators at Congressional Hearing</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable television executives faced a buzz saw
Wednesday from congressional, broadcast and consumer critics who
said cable companies are reaping billions of dollars in profits at
the public's expense.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, led the attack at a
congressional hearing, saying cable rates have risen an average of
32 percent nationally since Congress lifted virtually all
regulations on cable operators in 1984.
   ``The government reports that the price consumers pay for cable
service increased at a greater rate than any other commodity or
service in the entire United States,'' said Metzenbaum, chairman of
the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, monopolies and
business rights.
   Metzenbaum said what little authority the Federal Communications
Commission has to regulate cable is ``a joke.'' He introduced two
bills that would allow city governments to regulate cable TV rates,
require that cable programmers make their shows available to
competing services such as satellite-delivery and ``wireless
cable,'' and prohibit any one cable company from serving more than
25 percent of cable subscribers nationwide.
   Edward O. Fritts, president of the National Association of
Broadcasters, said the cable companies now dominate the local TV
marketplace.
   ``In 1984, when Congress passed the Cable Act, cable
characterized itself as a struggling, infant industry,'' Fritts
said.
   ``That act, which in essence removed all regulatory oversight,
has become the communications equivalent of anabolic steroids.
Today, cable television operators enjoy an unregulated monopoly.
Amazingly, only 32 of more than 8,000 cable systems have any direct
competition.''
   Fritts said cable TV now is a $14 billion industry that is
available to nearly 80 million U.S. homes.
   Gene Kimmelman, executive director of the Consumer Federation of
America, testified that competition in the cable marketplace could
drive down prices by as much as 50 percent, with a savings to
consumers of $6 billion.
   But Gerald M. Levin, vice chairman of Time Inc., which owns Home
Box Office and Cinemax, ``strongly denied'' the monopoly label and
said cable was providing ``more and better programming'' by owning
both the program suppliers and cable systems.
   Levin also said cities reap billions of dollars in franchise
fees from cable operators, and municipalities are free to give
those franchises to other companies if they don't like the existing
cable serivce.
   James Mooney, president of the National Cable Television
Association, said pre-1984 cable rates had been held artificially
low by municipal regulation. The industry incurred huge
construction costs in the 1980s while the number of channels
increased greatly.
   The subcommittee is studying the cable industry and the
antitrust implications of the proposed merger of Time Inc. and
Warner Communications. The Justice Department last week gave the
merger its blessing.

<TEXT>
   After 20 days of arduous work and
uncounted millions of dollars, the worst effects of the nation's
biggest oil spill appear to be waning.
   Yet for all the work done by 1,000 people on the water and
shoreline and other thousands of support personnel, much of the
result is being attributed to the muscular forces of nature.
   ``The natural processes have far outweighed ours,'' Jim Hayden,
the state's cleanup coordinator, said earlier this week.
   Hayden and other officials acknowledge much of the easing
situation must be credited to nature:
   _An estimated 30 to 40 percent of the 10.1 million gallons of
oil that poured from the tanker Exxon Valdez has been dissipated by
natural evaporation of the more volatile components of the crude
oil. By Thursday less than 20,000 barrels, under 10 percent of the
spill, will have been recovered by human effort.
   _Favorable weather through most of the 20 days since the spill
pushed vast amounts of the oil out of Prince William Sound and into
the Gulf of Alaska where several days of high wind and heavy seas
churned and broke up the slick.
   _Aerial observations this week indicated that some blackened
beaches on the islands and inlets of the sound are being cleansed
by the heavy wave action.
   The spill's disastrous effects are far from over. It is feared
the toll of wildlife will continue and even grow as migrating birds
return to the oiled beaches.
   It will be years before scientists know the impact on the vast
ecosystem in Prince William Sound.
   Yet scientists are warning that nature must be given a big share
of the cleanup work that remains. They say too much human labor and
technology applied to oiled areas could do more harm than good.
   ``We've seen from other spills that if we hit an area too hard
with things like high pressure water or heavy equipment, we wind up
killing everything,'' said John Robinson, chief of the hazardous
material response branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   Robinson said much of the shoreline hit by the oil is of a rock
and gravel mix. If efforts to clean the beaches are too vigorous,
he said, it could force the oil deep into the ground, where it can
affect microscopic life valuable to the area's ecosystem.
   Robinson said the public's anxiety to clean the remaining mess
as quickly as possible must be balanced with the realization that
some areas would be better left to a slower cleanup job by nature.
   ``I'm optimistic that the officials here understand that,'' he
said. ``I would hope that the public doesn't get frustrated with
what might seem like a slow process and not press us into doing it
too fast.''

<TEXT>
   Rulla Abdo Dihu sat on the steps of the
prison exercise yard Wednesday and said with chilling conviction
that she would take up arms again if she were freed.
   ``I didn't kill for myself. I'm not a criminal. I'm a political
prisoner. What I did, I did for my people,'' the Palestinian
Christian told a reporter during a tour of the security wing of Tel
Monde prison in central Israel.
   Ms. Dihu, 20, from the West Bank town of Ramallah, was sentenced
in January 1988 to 25 years jail for getting a gun that another
Palestinian used to kill an Israeli soldier.
   Asked if she regretted her act, Ms. Dihu responded in a voice
choked with emotion: ``Why should I be? We are fighting for our
justice. We are at war. All's fair in love and war ...
   ``I would love to go back to fighting with my people in the
intefadeh,'' she said, using the Arabic word for the uprising
against Israeli rule in the occupied territories.
   She is one of 24 Palestinian women transferred to a segregated
wing here after the rebellion spilled over to the central women's
prison at Neve Tirza.
   The tensions resulted in hair-pulling battles between Israeli
criminals and Arab political detainees.
   ``They beat up one of the Palestinian women and shouted curses
against the PLO and our leaders,'' said Terry Boulatta, 22, of
Jerusalem, who awaits trial on charges of organizing anti-Israeli
demonstrations March 8.
   The political activism of Arab women is a change in traditional
lifestyle that has grown out of the uprising. As thousands of
Palestinian men have been arrested or wounded, women and children
have taken their places at the forefront of street protests.
   Israeli officials refuse to say how many women are behind bars.
   During the tour, Palestinian women complained of rodent
excrement in food, mosquitoes in cells and lack of medical
attention.
   They live two to a cell in a two-story wing with a central
courtyard open to the sky. Children's paintings of an Arab village
and a field of flowers remain from the facility's days as a
juvenile center.
   Ms. Boulatta, who has been jailed four times for political
activism, complained she receives no medical help for a liver
dysfunction diagnosed by Arab doctors.
   She said a doctor visits the prisons for a half hour three times
a week. ``They only look at me and say `you're okay and go back to
your room.'''
   Prison physician Dr. Victor Romanov said an Israeli specialist
examined and tested Ms. Boulatta but found nothing wrong.
   Some complaints about food and conditions seemed exaggerated.
Prison Commissioner Levy Shaul rejected them.
   He called Tel Monde a model prison but conceded overcrowding and
poor standards plague other facilities where anti-Israeli activists
are held.
   ``Overcrowding is such that in some facilities prisoners have to
stand in line for a bathroom,'' he said.
   Shaul noted women in Tel Monde are allowed family visits and
have access to radio, television, newspapers and some non-political
books.
   Israeli authorities have refused requests from reporters to
visit other prisons, especially the Ketziot detention center in the
Negev desert, where several thousand Arab activists are living in
tents, exposed to searing desert winds and heat. Most are held
without trial for up to six months.

<HEAD>Court Refuses To Reinstate Libel Case Against Izvestia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court refused Wednesday
to reinstate a businessman's $250,000 libel award against the
Soviet newspaper Izvestia, saying a foreign government publication
cannot be sued for libel.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also overturned $163,165
in breach-of-contract damages for Raphael Gregorian of Palo Alto
against Soviet trade organizations. Despite initially refusing to
appear in court on the advice of their government, the
organizations should have a chance to contest Gregorian's claims,
the court said.
   Gregorian's California International Trade Corp. had sold
medical and laboratory products to the Soviet Union since 1970.
Gregorian said the government and two trading organizations,
Medexport and Licensintorg, accepted and used hospital equipment in
1984 but failed to pay for it.
   In November 1984, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade withdrew
the company's license to maintain a business office in the Soviet
Union. The following week, an article in Izvestia accused Gregorian
of smuggling, bribery and unethical business practices, and implied
he had been spying for the United States, the court said.
   Gregorian's lawsuit contended the newspaper article and the loss
of his license were attempts to avoid payment for the hospital
equipment.
   When Soviet officials refused to respond to the lawsuit, U.S.
District Judge David Kenyon found them in default and awarded
damages. Gregorian then seized a typewriter belonging to a U.S.
correspondent for Izvestia and got an order allowing him to
confiscate money in a U.S. bank account held by a Soviet agency.
   Kenyon later overturned the libel judgment. Wednesday's 3-0
ruling upheld that decision and ordered him to reconsider the
contract claim.

<HEAD>Aussie Says The Title Ain't Enough To Leave Home For</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired Australian sheep shearer who
inherited the title of Earl of Lincoln toured his namesake city
Wednesday, but even the prospect of sitting in the House of Lords
wasn't enough to make him stay.
   ``It's a splendid place, but we will be going back to
Australia,'' Edward Fiennes-Clinton, 75, said after he and his wife
Linda, the new Countess of Lincoln, visited Lincoln's castle,
cathedral and prosperous shopping malls.
   Fiennes-Clinton, who also worked as a gold miner and milk
deliveryman, said they decided to return home Thursday after
discovering there is no ancestral home to go with the title _ only
a seat in the hereditary House of Lords.
   ``This won't change our lives. We are still the same people and
I hope it's not going to change me at all,'' said the earl, who
calls his wife ``Mum.''
   He was telephoned in January at his retirement village in
Bunbury near Perth, Australia, and asked to call the College of
Arms in London.
   ``I had no idea what it was all about but I spoke to a man who
said he would be the first to congratulate me,'' said the 18th Earl
of Lincoln.
   ``I knew the title was in the family, but there are so many
different branches it never occurred to me that I might inherit it.
It is an old and honorable title and I would like to carry it on in
the few years left to me.'' Fiennes-Clinton inherited the
16th-century title on Christmas Day upon the death in England of a
remote kinsman, the 10th Duke of Newcastle and Earl of Lincoln. The
family had fallen on hard times, and the duke was chiefly known as
a collector of butterflies and moths.
   The old family seat, Clumber in Nottinghamshire, was pulled down
as long ago as 1938, and its 3,800-acre park is now owned by the
National Trust, which cares for historic homes.
   As the duke was unmarried, the dukedom became extinct, but the
lesser title of the Lincoln earldom passed to the Australian, whose
forebears had emigrated.
   The earl said he gave up full-time work 13 years ago and does
not have the resources or desire to move to England. The only cash
benefit available to him would be a maximum payment of 57 pounds
($97) daily if he attended the House of Lords and had to stay in
London overnight.
   ``We had some very nice letters from the city council assuring
us of a warm welcome if we ever visited Lincoln, so we came over to
see it and to look into this title business,'' the earl said.
   The earl's only previous visit to Britain was in 1977 for the
silver jubilee to mark Queen Elizabeth II's 25 years on the throne.
He never thought of visiting Lincoln at that time.
   ``I grew up in the depression in Australia and there was no dole
(welfare). My first job was as a butcher, earning 10 shillings ($2)
a week. We used to kill out in the paddock and hang up the carcass
in a tree,'' the earl said.
   He said he never found a crock of gold in his prospecting but
before he retired, he was running the water supply for a large part
of the country.
   The earl said, ``I was a widower when we were married and Mum
was a widow. I have been lucky both times.'' He said he would like
to take up his House of Lords seat, but there was little prospect
of it.
   The College of Arms said it could be five or six months before
the necessary research was completed. The cost of confirming the
title to make it legal and securing recognition by the queen could
be $8,500.
   ``Mum and I are registered in the House of Lords, but it is not
all legal until the research has been done,'' the earl said.

   And on March 9, as you may remember, this commission filed its
report and its recommendation.
   It was chaired by Ambassador Wilkey, Judge Wilkey, co-chaired by
former Attorney General Griffin Bell.
   In fact, the legislation now resulting from their
recommendations and other ideas that I have _ legislation is being
sent to the Congress today.
   And just this morning, I issued an executive order announcing
ethical principles for the conduct of executive branch employees.
   Both actions seek a common end: to raise ethical standards, to
avoid conflicts of interest, and to ensure that the law is
respected in fact and in appearance.
   There are those of course who say that public ethics and values
cannot be legislated.
   But they can, and I'm inclined to agree, you're never going to
legislate away impropriety, or through legislation, guarantee that
everybody _ everybody lives beyond the, you know, perception of
criticism.
   But these values and ethics can be encouraged, respected and
adhered to in government.
   Public service must reflect the best values of America and let
me add that most public servants in my view do that _ and I have
served in the Congress and I have served in the executive branch as
well.
   Jefferson said, ``The whole art of government consists in being
honest.''
   And, yet, too often, simple honesty is not enough.
   Government rules have worked at cross purposes.
   Our regulations have been complicated and unequally applied.
   Our laws have been contradictory and unclear and we've spent
more time trying to understand federal ethics laws than we have
trying to live by them.
   My ethics program seeks to remedy these defects.
   How?
   By setting four objectives.
   First, to establish clear ethical principles.
   Second, to ensure uniform standards among all three branches of
government.
   Third, to insist that these standards be fair and reasonable.
   And fourth, to ensure that these standards attract, not drive
out, talented men and women to government.
   My ethics program first insists that ethical standards must be
exacting enough to ensure that officials act with the utmost
integrity, for the public's confidence is not ours to inherit.
   We must earn that confidence and it must be constantly renewed.
   With this in mind, I have placed a ban on outside income for
non-career presidential appointees in the executive branch,
including all employees in the immediate White House office.
   I am proposing expanded financial disclosure for all three
branches of government and I have instructed my staff to perform a
comprehensive review of federal campaign finance laws.
   Regarding the last _ and I have already reached one
determination _ Congress should extend for all members the
prohibition against the conversion of political contributions for
personal or office use.
   Political donations should not become a sort of individual
retirement account for members of the United States Congress, and I
call on Congress to close this loophole and to close it this year.
   Modern democratic government works best when organized by strong
political parties and yet we have allowed our parties to become
weakened and overshadowed by special interests, and we can best
restore the role of the parties by limiting political action
committees.
   PACs weaken the parties, restrain competition and deaden the
political debate.
   And I believe we should eliminate contributions to candidates by
political action committees _ and I'll be consulting with the
Congress about that _ and I also oppose federal funding of
congressional campaigns.

   Morton Downey Jr. got outshouted and didn't
smoke a single cigarette. Geraldo Rivera went nose-to-nose,
unbloodied this time, and Phil Donahue, who once wore a dress for a
show on transvestites, didn't skirt the issue.
   And Larry King, who doesn't like the ``kinky'' stuff, defended
them all.
   The occasion was a raucous, often-hilarious 90-minute program
Wednesday pitting the four talk-show hosts and other television
luminaries against leaders in the print media over what constitutes
news, good taste and responsible journalism. Nobody, not even
Downey, a self-admitted ``yeller,'' seemed to have the last word.
   King took a stab at it. ``It's a big pie,'' said the USA Today
columnist and Mutal Radio and CNN television talk-show host.
``Geraldo's producers may decide they want to do a lot of sex on
their programs, or they want to do things that may be kinky.
Suppose they do that? So what?''
   ``I don't have to watch,'' King said. ``We each set out to do
our programs. Same with newspapers. There's the New York Daily News
and The New York Times and the New York Post, and the Wichita paper
and USA Today. And all the Americans have is choice.''
   The program, produced by Columbia University at the opening
session of the American Society of Newspaper Editors' annual
convention, was videotaped and will be aired Wednesday night and on
subsequent dates by public television stations. It was moderated by
former CBS News chief Fred W. Friendly, now with Columbia's
Graduate School of Journalism.
   Friendly started the fireworks by showing an excerpt from a
program Rivera did on sex surrogates, and telling his former
student, ``It seems to me that what you're concentrating on is that
`kinky' business.''
   Rivera: ``I do lots of different programs. ... You are talking
about 10 percent of what I do.''
   Friendly: ``Mr. Rivera, I looked at a hundred of your programs.
I could have run a hundred of them and made the same point.''
   ``What are you, Mr. Rivera?'' Friendly persisted.
   ``I'm a compassionate man ... a television talk-show host, a
reporter, a journalist, a writer ...'' said Rivera.
   Q: ``Who are your role models?
   A: ``There's a lot of (Walter) Winchell in what I do. There's
also Edward R. Murrow and Merv Griffin.''
   Friendly: ``That's a combination. Winchell, Griffin and Murrow.''
   Jack Nelson, Washington bureau chief of The Los Angeles Times,
snapped that Rivera and the others are ``more show biz than you are
journalists.''
   Rivera shot back: ``This is arrogant. This is hypocrisy.''
   He demanded to know how much of the criticism of so-called trash
television ``is based on pure parochialism? How much of it is based
on the fact that I am your competition?''
   Nelson: ``I don't think you're a journalist.''
   Donohue: ``Explain the difference.''
   Nelson: ``Well, I go out and I try to find out what I can that I
think is important for society to know, for society to act on. ...
   Downey: ``You're a snob.''
   Tom Shales, television critic for The Washington Post, said
``We're not talking about what's journalism and what's not
journalism. We're talking about what's good taste and what's bad
taste, what's good manners and what's bad manners. And I think
television now is overrun with bad taste and bad manners.''
   The audience was shown another excerpt, from Downey's program,
in which a young member of the audience challenged the host's views
on prison furloughs by noting that ``one of the central tenets of
Christianity is foregiveness.''
   Downey was shown retorting:
   ``Let me tell you something. More people have been killed in the
name of Jesus ... they've all been killed by guys like you.''
   Downey and the young man wound up screaming ``Murderer!'' at one
another 10 times over. Downey concluded the segment by raising his
arm and inviting the youth to ``suck my armpit.''
   Friendly: ``Did you really give that young man a chance to be
heard?''
   Downey: ``Absolutely. What am I supposed to do, write bland
headlines on the 17th page of a newspaper?
   Downey said he is ``an advocate, not a host. ... I was raised in
the generation of rock 'n' roll. And we heard the lyrics over the
music. The older folks here don't seem to be able to hear the
lyrics.''
   Nelson said ``the most reprehensible thing I see on any of these
programs is Mort Downey smoking his cigarette on television. ...
   Downey, who couldn't smoke during the ASNE appearance because of
rules governing the hall, replied, ``That's the mentality of the
super-liberal.''
   King: ``If Morton Downey wishes to commit suicide, that is his
prerogative.''
   Downey, to Nelson: ``You'd love for me to drop dead because it
would be sensational for your newspaper.''
   The capacity audience of about 500 newspaper publishers and
executives also viewed the ``Donahue'' segment in which he donned a
dress for a show on transvestites.
   Friendly taunted him about that, noting he once admired Donahue
for the way he handled shows. ``People have come to see you as a
role model, and now you're making a fool of yourself,'' said
Friendly.
   Donahue replied that ``I do not apologize for wanting to draw a
crowd. I'm as interested in ratings as the people in the room are
interested in circulation.''
   Besides, said Donahue, ``I think it's a pretty good epitaph for
somebody: `Occasionally he went too far.''
   Toward the end, virtually all the panelists were trying to be
heard over each other. ``I find it extremely distasteful,'' said
Downey, ``to listen to shouting.''
   Friendly, in a not-so-veiled reference to a ``Geraldo'' episode,
said ``I can't break people's noses to stop them.''

<HEAD>Scientists Clash On Whether Fusion Has Been Produced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ERICE, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British professor on Wednesday presented
more details of an experiment he said produced nuclear fusion, but
many scientists at an international conference said they were
skeptical.
   The scientists said that even if fusion had been achieved, there
were no guarantees it would provide a revolutionary new energy
source.
   ``I'm warning people _ don't sell your oil well yet,'' said
physicist Steven Jones of Brigham Young University in Utah.
   About 100 scientists from around the world gathered Wednesday at
the Ettore Majorana Center for Scientific Culture in Sicily to
listen to British professor Martin Fleischmann and to Jones, who
says he also achieved nuclear fusion at room temperature using
ordinary laboratory equipment.
   Fleishchmann, of the University of Southampton, said when an
electrical current was used to herd hydrogen atoms into metal
electrodes in a glass beaker, the atoms apparently fused,
generating four watts of energy for every watt used.
   In London, Nature magazine announced Wednesday it will publish
at least one of two research papers by scientists who claim to have
independently generated nuclear fusion. Publication date was set
for April 27, according to Laura Garwin, an editor.
   For decades, scientists have spent millions of dollars searching
for a practical way to achieve nuclear fusion because of its
potential as an inexpensive, relatively clean and virtually
inexhaustible source of energy.
   If scientists could harness fusion power, an ounce of ``heavy''
hydrogen could generate the energy equivalent of 70,000 gallons of
gasoline, Jones said.
   In the three weeks since Fleischmann and fellow researcher B.
Stanley Pons of the University of Utah made their fusion
announcement, hundreds of scientists have rushed to duplicate the
experiments. Several U.S. universities reported partial results.
   ``I'm somewhat disappointed and worried that in the past two
weeks no one has solidly confirmed it,'' said Matthijs Broer, a
physicist at American Telephone and Telegraph Co. Bell Laboratories
in Murray Hill, N.J.
   Jones and the team of Fleischmann and Pons detailed their
experiments Wednesday as scientists from the United States, Europe,
the Soviet Union and China peppered them with highly technical
questions.
   Several scientists qestioned Fleischmann's and Pons' claim that
their fusion process produced four times as much energy as it used.
   ``I don't think the heat they see is due to fusion,'' said
Jones, who announced last month he had independently created cold
nuclear fusion but produced only a miniscule energy release.
   Physicists said the Fleischmann-Pons experiment might have been
simply a chemical reaction and therefore not significant as an
energy source.
   Fleischmann, however, said that only nuclear activity could
account for the amount of energy released.
   Scientists also questioned whether Fleischmann and Pons checked
all the variables in their experiment. Fleischmann refused to
answer several questions.
   Fleischmann acknowledged that more experiments were needed but
said he was not concerned that his work had not been matched. ``I
don't see how people can expect to duplicate the results in a short
time,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, physicists said they were taking the experiments
seriously because of their potentially far-reaching impact and
because of the scientists' solid reputations.
   Fusion is the process by which tremendous amounts of energy are
released when the cores of two hydrogen atoms fuse.
   In contrast, nuclear power plants get energy from fission, or
the splitting of atoms.
   Standard fusion experiments have used extremely high
temperatures and machines the size of two-story homes to force the
hydrogen atoms to fuse.
   Steven Koonin, a theoretical nuclear physicist from California,
said if the discoveries were true, they could bring bad as well as
good developments.
   ``If you can do nuclear physics in your kitchen, you have a
severe proliferation problem,'' he said.

   A congressional commission on Wednesday
recommended a permanent office in the federal health department to
coordinate fights against so-called orphan diseases that afflict an
estimated 20 million Americans.
   Orphan diseases are relatively rare ailments that, by
definition, affect no more than 200,000 people.
   But because there are so many separate diseases, the total
number of people suffering from them is larger than from many
better-known ailments.
   Some diseases that qualify for orphan status are fairly
well-known themselves _ such as autism, multiple schlerosis and
Tay-Sachs diseases.
   Some, such as cholera, are common in the Third World, but rare
in the United States.
   Still others are obscure, such as Wilson's disease, a hereditary
illness that causes liver and brain damage.
   The final report of the National Commission on Orphan Diseases,
established by Congress in 1985, called for creation of a Central
Office of Orphan and Rare Diseases _ to be known as COORD _ within
the Department of Health and Human Services.
   It would work to:
   _Increase financing for biomedical research, training,
fellowships and clinical research centers.
   _Provide access to affordable health care for all American and
eliminate health insurance restrictions on pre-existing conditions.
   _Speed the government approval process for medications designed
to help sufferers of rare diseases.
   _Create a centralized information datebase on rare diseases.
   ``Research is critical, and we must make it clear to doctors and
investigators that the tratment of rare diseases is a national
priority,'' said Dr. Jess G. Thoene, chairman of the commission.
   He was joined at a news conference by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.,
and Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., main backers of the legislation
that created the commission.
   Both also were instrumental in passage of th Orphan Drug Act, a
companion law that provides tax breaks for drug companies who make
research investments to develop drugs for such a small patient base
there is not a large enough market to justify the effort otherwise.
   Hatch said the success of the act has been ``staggering'' and
``has accomplished mroe than Congress ever expected it to.''
   Waxman said more than 260 drugs have been developed for rare
diseases since the Orphan Drug Act took effect, compared to less
than a dozen prior to the legislation.

<HEAD>Analysts Foresee Brownouts In Northeast This Summer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New England states are likely this summer
to face a repeat of last year's temporary electricity shortages,
and the squeeze may be a prelude to more widespread ``brownouts''
in the 1990s, energy analysts said Wednesday.
   ``What happens in the Northeast will be a harbinger for the rest
of the country,'' said Leonard J. Kujawa, an Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.
analyst who helped direct a study on electric power trends in the
United States.
   Although electricity supplies for the peak use periods of summer
are tightest in New England, the power outlook for the nation as a
whole is growing more uncertain, said Daniel Yergin, president of
Cambridge Energy Research Associates and a partner in the study.
   The central problem is that U.S. electricity demand has grown
more rapidly than expected since 1985, while utilities have chosen
not to add to their generating capacity, Kujawa and Yergin told a
news conference on the results of their study.
   The key question, they said, is who will build the generating
capacity that will be needed in the 1990s. The answer is uncertain
because utilities are wary of the financial risks involved in major
new additions to plant capacity, while smaller power producers face
an array of regulatory and other obstacles, they said.
   In the Northeast, utilities in recent years have been forced to
import power from the mid-Atlantic. Last summer the problem was
compounded by record heat. In the Boston area, several thousand
customers lost power for a weekend because of overheated
transmission cables, and in New York City about 10,000 customers
lost power for a day.
   Other parts of the country have excess generating capacity, but
if demand for electricity continues growing at the pace of recent
years, constraints on supply could be felt in many areas, the
analysts said.
   Environmental and regulatory issues also may compound the
problem, they said.
   ``What is missing is an overall framework for balancing needs
for new generating capacity with environmental concerns and the
questions about who will pay,'' said Yergin.

<TEXT>
   Soviet-born conductor Mstislav Rostropovich,
tearfully hailing a new era of artistic freedom in his homeland,
announced Wednesday he will return to the Soviet Union for a
concert tour with the National Symphony Orchestra next February.
   It will be his first visit to the Soviet Union _ except for a
brief, unnoticed stopover in the Moscow airport a few years ago _
since he fled into exile with his wife, soprano Galina
Vishnevskaya, in 1974. They were stripped of their Soviet
citizenship four years later.
   Rostropovich, 62, a world-renowned cellist who has been music
director of the National Symphony since 1977, told reporters at the
Kennedy Center he was ``very excited and very nervous'' about
visiting the homeland where he formerly was reviled and harassed by
Soviet authorities.
   He and Soviet ambassador Yuri Dubinin, tears streaming down
their faces, embraced after the news conference. Dubinin hinted
broadly that if Rostropovich gave a signal, the Kremlin would be
willing to initiate the process of restoring his Soviet citizenship.
   But Rostropovich carefully avoided giving any indication of his
future intentions, choosing instead to lavish praise on Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform policies.
   ``The Soviet people have so much more freedom, so much more
glasnost, than before Mr. Gorbachev,'' he said. ``For artistic
freedom, there has been enormous change.''
   Rostropovich acknowledged that he had once vowed never to return
to his homeland until there were major changes in the Soviet
system. But he said Wednesday that Gorbachev's far-reaching reforms
``give me the moral right to go there.''
   After the National Symphony completes a two-week tour of Japan
in late January and early February, Rostropovich and the 103-member
orchestra will fly to the Soviet Union for two concerts in Moscow
and two in Leningrad in about a week.
   Although the concert programs for the Soviet tour were
undecided, Rostropovich said his first choices were Antonin
Dvorak's double concerto for cello and orchestra, with himself at
the cello, and Dmitri Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony, a powerful
musical denunciation of the political and human rights abuses of
the Stalin era.
   It was unclear Wednesday whether Rostropovich's wife would join
the Soviet tour.
   Dubinin said the tour will be ``a very, very important page for
his biography, for development of cultural exchanges ... and for
deep changes in our society and our relations with the United
States.''
   The ambassador said the issue of restoring Rostropovich's
citizenship was ``a special question'' which ``depends now on the
will of Maestro Rostropovich whether to begin the procedure.''
   Dubinin added: ``Let's hope the time will come when all the
(legal) decisions will be taken according to the wishes of Maestro
Rostropovich.''
   Stephen Klein, the orchestra's executive director, said it was
only on Monday that he received the formal invitation from
Gosconcert, the Soviet performing arts agency, for the National
Symphony to make the tour.
   Although such a trip had been rumored for months, the orchestra
players were not given the official news until Rostropovich mounted
the podium in the Kennedy Center Concert Hall for their regular
Wednesday morning rehearsal.
   Klein said he considered it highly unlikely that Rostropovich
would seek to regain his Soviet citizenship and to return home
permanently, leaving his lucrative job at the National Symphony,
his concert recitals and recording commitments.
   In an emotional speech to orchestra members, Klein said,
Rostropovich noted that many of his Soviet contemporaries _
including Shostakovich, pianist Emil Gilels and violinist David
Oistrakh _ had died. He told his musicians that ``you have become
my family.''
   Rostropovich's troubles with Soviet authorities began when and
his wife took Soviet author Alexander Solzhenitsyn into their home
after the 1970 Nobel Prize winner was kicked out of the Soviet
writers' union and deprived of his apartment.
   The couple's concerts and foreign tours were canceled, all
recording sessions were halted and they suffered a total blackout
in the Soviet press. After Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
intervened with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, the couple obtained
exit visas, fled to the West in 1974 and decided to stay.
   Rostropovich's rehabilitation began in 1987 when Soviet
authorities allowed his sister, Veronika, to fly to Washington to
attend festivities marking the conductor's 60th birthday.
   In January, the government newspaper Izvestia urged restoration
of the couple's citizenship, and a senior member of the Soviet
foreign ministry said in February that authorities would review the
cases of people stripped of their citizenship. Last month, a
favorable documentary on Rostropovich and his wife was broadcast on
Soviet television.

   A helicopter hit power lines Wednesday and
crashed into the Susquehanna River, killing two state police
officers who were searching for a suicide victim, authorities and
witnesses said.
   Scuba divers found the bodies of a state police corporal and a
trooper in the wreckage of the five-passenger Bell Jet Ranger
helicopter, police said. Their names were not immediately released.
   A witness, Hazel Keller, said she saw the crash from the York
County side of the river several miles north of the Maryland border.
   ``It hit a wire that crosses the river then it exploded and fell
into the water,'' said Mrs. Keller. ``It broke up in pieces and
pieces were floating down the river. We were all looking to see if
there were any bodies. We didn't see any bodies, just the debris.''
   State police spokesman Tom Lyon said the helicopter was being
used to search for the body of a suicide victim who reportedly
jumped from a bridge in the area several days earlier.
   Lyon said it was the first crash of a state police helicopter
since 1974. One trooper was killed in the 1974 crash; the cause of
which was never determined.
   There was no hint of any factors that may have contributed to
Wednesday's crash, which occurred about 9:45 a.m. in clear and calm
weather.

<TEXT>
   A ceremony planned to revive hope for
Mark Kilroy's safe return became a memorial service Wednesday, a
day after his body was discovered in a Mexican grave dug by a
voodoo cult of drug smugglers.
   ``I'm still kind of shocked about the whole thing,'' said Bill
Huddleston, 21. ``I'm feeling a lot of different things _ anger,
sadness.''
   Huddleston, Bradley Moore, 20, and Brent Martin, 20, were
walking with Kilroy down a busy street in Matamoros, Mexico, the
night the 21-year-old was abducted. Kilroy's body and 11 others
were discovered Tuesday buried on a ranch south of the Mexican
border.
   Police said the victims were killed by drug smugglers seeking
demonic protection against police.
   Many Santa Fe residents who had worked to publicize Kilroy's
disappearance in an effort to find him gathered Wednesday to mourn
the University of Texas pre-med student's death.
   ``We come today to pray for Mark Kilroy,'' the Rev. John DeForke
said at a brief ceremony held outside Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic
Church, the Kilroy family's church. ``We come to pray for those
other wonderful people who died so violently.''
   About 150 children from the church school pinned yellow ribbons
around two trees outside the church in remembrance of Kilroy.
   ``I can't imagine anything worse happening,'' said Susan
Kuebler, a friend of the family.
   After the church ceremony, the three friends with Kilroy the
night he was taken said they wished now they had stayed at a party
they were at instead of going drinking at a Mexican bar.
   ``We should have never gone over (the border),'' said Huddleston.
   The four attended different colleges but are from Santa Fe, a
small, quiet community about 30 miles south of Houston. They all
had gone to the beach in southern Texas for spring break and had
ventured across the Mexican border for a late-night outing.
   They said Kilroy left the group after a stranger beckoned to him
on the crowded Matamoros street in the early hours of March 14. But
they said Wednesday they still can't recall the precise moment
when, or exact spot where, Kilroy disappeared.
   Under hypnosis, Huddleston said he and Kilroy passed a man
wearing a blue plaid shirt who motioned to Kilroy and called out.
According to a friend of the Kilroy family, Sheila Hughes,
Huddleston said under hypnosis that he went to a nearby bathroom
and Kilroy was gone when he returned.
   The three said they did not recognize any of the suspects in
pictures released by authorities Tuesday and Wednesday.
   The three expressed hope that Kilroy's murderers would be
prosecuted and punished. ``I think they deserve to get what he
got,'' Huddleston said.
   Kilroy lived for about 12 hours after his abduction and was
slain with a machete, authorities said. Suspects in custody have
confessed to removing Kilroy's brain and spine and chopping off his
legs, said Cameron County Sheriff Alex Perez.
   Kilroy's friends at the university in Austin said his ambition
to go to medical school drove him.
   ``School came first to him and he knew how to draw that line,''
said Frank J. Padula, Kilroy's neighbor and a senior history major.
``He was just an average, typical incoming kid. He was nervous, he
wanted to meet some girls, but he knew he had school work to do.''
   ``He was very intelligent, a super-smart guy,'' said Tammy
Shead, a UT psychology junior who attended high school with Kilroy.
``In high school I remember him winning all kinds of math and
science awards. I know he was confident about school.''

<HEAD>Financier Buys Palm Beach Home With $9 Million Cash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billionaire Ronald Perelman, a Wall
Street financier and chairman of the Revlon Corp., bought a Palm
Beach mansion for $9 million _ cash.
   The 2.3-acre estate was owned by D. Mead Johnson, a former
pharmaceutical company executive who has lived there for 20 years.
   Johnson said Perelman didn't need a mortgage but paid for the
house and grounds outright. Papers were expected to be filed in a
few days, The Palm Beach Post reported Wednesday.
   ``I had been contemplating it for some time,'' Johnson said. ``I
would never have sold the place. (But) I don't want the
responsibility of maintaining it, and I want a smaller place.''
   The 8,000-square-foot home, built 20 years ago, features about
200 feet of beach, a pool, a 2,700-square-foot guest home and a
2,700-square-foot garage apartment.
   Perelman is one of America's most active corporate raiders and
in the past 10 years has parlayed a $1.9 million stake in a small
jewelry distributorship into a $4.8 billion empire.
   With the help of Drexel Burnham Lambert junk-bond wizard Michael
Milken, Perelman has purchased a collection of companies that
include Technicolor, a film processor; Video Corp. of America, a
manufacturer of video cassettes; Consolidated Cigar; and Pantry
Pride, a troubled supermarket chain.
   Two years ago, financier Nelson Peltz paid $18 million for the
mansion Montsorrel in Palm Beach's most expensive purchase. The
Perelman home is a few houses north of Montsorrel.

   My legislative proposal also strengthens the rules against
abusing the ``revolving door'' for private gain at the expense of
public trust.
   These rules must not make government service a bar to productive
work in the private sector, but they must prohibit the appearance
of profiting from government service; and this must include the
legislative branch as well.
   I am proposing a 25 percent pay raise for federal judges, while
restricting their acceptance of honoraria.
   I also believe that honoraria for members of Congress should be
banned.
   And I believe Congress should have a pay increase.
   And I will not make a formal proposal on Congress until after I
consult with the leaders of Congress on the issue of congressional
pay.
   There is no point, absolutely no point, in putting Congress
through another traumatic bashing like the one just completed.
   And I will include, in those consultations, the question of a
pay increase for certain executive branch positions, including
specialized jobs like those out there at the National Institutes of
Health.
   And I will strongly support pay increases for these jobs which
are so important to this country.
   My ethics program's second goal recognizes that ethical
consistency demands equitable standards across all three branches
of government.
   And under our Constitution, every branch of government is equal,
and none warrants preferential treatment.
   The same standard that applies to a staff person at HUD
(Department of Housing and Urban Development) should also apply to
housing subcommittee staff on Capitol Hill.
   And a practice is either ethical or it is not.
   And if Washington is to be a level playing field, then every
player should be treated the same.
   And therefore I am proposing that we must extend the independent
counsel statute to cover the Congress.
   I am also proposing that the federal statute that prohibits
employees from taking actions that enhance their own financial
interest be extended to cover legislative and judicial branch
employees.
   There should also be an independent ethics office for Congress,
to be headed by a clearly non-partisan official confirmed by both
houses.
   And I ask that the existing one-year post-employment ``cooling
off'' period for the senior executive branch employees also apply
to the legislative and the judicial branch.
   And then, there's the third objective of this ethics program.
   It insists that standards be reasonable and reflect good
old-fashioned common sense.
   Some financial interests, for example, are too minor to create
any meaningful conflict of interest at all.
   So, I want the Office of Government Ethics to have the authority
to issue regulations authorizing waivers from these conflict of
interest statutes.
   But at the same time, we're urging tougher penalties when
intentional violations of criminal conflict of interest laws occur.
   We're asking officials from all three branches to simplify the
forms that must be completed by prospective appointees, and I'm
also requiring mandatory annual briefings on ethics for
presidential appointees.

<HEAD>Catholics, Jews Tussle About Convent At Auschwitz</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic newspaper Wednesday
criticized Jewish demands to relocate a Carmelite convent away from
the former Auschwitz concentration camp.
   The Roman Catholic hierarchy has agreed to move the convent, but
its failure to meet a promised Feb. 22 deadline has provoked an
outcry from Jewish organizations.
   The newspaper Slowo Powszechne published an open letter from
1,375 people from Oswiecim ``protesting the pressure on the nuns to
leave the building they occupy.'' Oswiecim is the Polish name for
the city the Germans called Auschwitz.
   The newspaper does not represent the Catholic Church. It is
owned by a Catholic pro-government organization called PAX.
   Jews want the convent moved because Auschwitz, now a museum,
holds special significance for them. About 2.8 million of the 6
million Jews killed in the Nazi holocaust died at Auschwitz'
factory-like gas chambers and crematoria and those of Birkenau, a
larger death camp a mile away that shared the same Nazi
administration. Victims came from throughout Europe.
   Ernst Ludwig Ehrlich, European Director of B'nai B'rith, said
Jewish relations with the Catholic Church will ``remain frozen''
until the convent is moved.
   In a telephone interview from his home in Geneva, Ehrlich cited
``resistance by the Catholic rank and file and others in all of
Poland.''
   He said he doubts Polish assurances that a start will be made
soon to build a new home for the convent's 14 nuns.
   Slowo Powszechne questioned any decision to move the convent, in
a former theater used as a warehouse by the Nazis and located a few
yards outside the camp's barbed wire fence.
   ``In the Auschwitz camp, it was mainly non-Jews who were
murdered, above all Polish and POWs of other nationalities, and the
extermination of Jews was being conducted in Birkenau,'' the paper
said in a March 31 article.
   ``Therefore it is hard to understand why people of a different
nationality and citizenship declare themselves so fiercely against
a handful of nuns, living in a Polish city, on Polish soil, next to
one of the biggest sites of martyrdom of Poles,'' the article said.
   More than 4 million people were put to death at the
Auschwitz-Birkenau complex.

<HEAD>EEC Continuing to Push Grain Exports: USDA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community continues to
push grain exports aggressively, with shipments expected to be at a
record level this year, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   An analysis by the department's Foreign Agricultural Service
said EEC exports of wheat and coarse grains such as barley and corn
are expected to total 33.3 million metric tons in 1988-89, up 39
percent from 23.9 million tons last year.
   International trade years begin on July 1 for wheat and Oct. 1
for coarse grains. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal
to 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans, or 39.5 bushels of corn.
   Wheat exports by the EEC are at a record 21 million tons, up
from 15.3 million in 1987-88.
   But the coarse grains, mostly barley, also have grown and are
forecast at 12.3 million tons against only 8.6 million tons last
year.
   ``Over the past seven years, subsidized barley exports by the
EEC have jumped by 150 percent,'' the report said. ``While EEC
barley exports comprised less than 30 percent of world barley trade
as recently as the early 1980s, their share is now almost 60
percent, a growth in exports that has come at least partially at
the expense of U.S. coarse grain market share.''
   The United States, the world's leading grain exporter, was
forecast to have total wheat and coarse grain shipments of 103.4
million tons in the current trade year, up from 96.9 million tons
in 1987-88, a 7 percent increase.
   Part of the growth reflects recent large corn sales to the
Soviet Union and subsidized wheat sales to China.
   The Soviet Union is expected to import 37.5 million tons of
wheat and coarse grains from all sources this year, up 2 million
tons from the March forecast and 16 percent more than the 32.2
million tons imported in 1987-88. It also would be the most wheat
and coarse grains imported by the Soviets since 55.4 million tons
were bought in 1984-85.
   According to other USDA figures, the Soviets have bought about
17 million tons of U.S. wheat and corn for delivery in the year
that began Oct. 1, all but 4 million tons of it corn.
   China has bought about 8.5 million tons of U.S. wheat for
delivery this year, about half of the 16.5 million tons China is
expected to import from all sources in 1988-89.

   My program's fourth objective is to attract and keep the best
people in government by keeping federal ethics laws fair and
balanced.
   An ethics law is not a weapon, a blunt instrument with which to
pound a public servant.
   It's not a gag with which to silence the outspoken.
   It's a tool to ensure a government as honest as the American
people.
   We must not allow overly restrictive requirements to be abused,
or to keep talented people from entering public service.
   And that is why we have carefully crafted new post-employment
restrictions, and that's why we want to allow persons who are
required to divest assets to defer their tax liability.
   My ethics program shows exactly where we are going and why: We
seek to attract and keep the best and brightest in government.
   And by helping others, by building a better America honorably,
ethically, we seek to show how public service is not the sum of our
perks or possessions, but a measure of how we conduct ourselves and
what we achieve.
   Come to think of it, this is a good code for all occupations,
from high school to the highest callings in journalism and
government.
   I am delighted to have the opportunity to present to you the
principles of this ethics package.
   And obviously, I don't want to see this powerful crowd escape
without a pitch.
   I'd like to have your editorial support for the objectives that
I've outlined here today.
   Thank you all very much and I'd be glad to take your questions.
(Applause.)
   John Seigenthaler: The standard is that members of the society
only are permitted to ask questions. Those who are asking questions
will identify themselves by name and their news agency. Ben Johnson.
   Q. Ben Johnson, Columbia Missourian, Columbia, Mo. Mr.
President, my daughter thanks you for the autograph you gave us
last week and I'm asking this question on her behalf. She is a
12-year-old sixth-grader _ and I'm a little nervous here _ 12-year
old sixth-grader at Shepard Elementary School. And she asked me
after I left the White House, ``Daddy, will I ever be president?
Would I have a chance to be president like Mr. Bush.'' She's black
and also female. Do you envision, sir, a time when this country
might be prepared to elect a black and-or female as president?
   Bush: Yes, I do.
   I'd say to her, if I can make it, she can make it.
   But nevertheless _ (laughter) _ no but seriously, Ben, of course
we're in changing times here.
   And the great thing is that she might, by her question, aspire
to be president.
   And I hope that I can keep alive, for at least the time I'm in
the White House, the concept, the honor of public service, the
obligation to put something back into the system, and also the fact
that if you get into the arena you get a very different perspective
than when you're sitting outside.
   I always loved what Sam Rayburn said, and this is a little off
your question for your daughter, but he was listening to some
debate with a bunch of staffers, I think it was, up on the hill.
   He said, ``Well, the problem is I never ran for sheriff.''
   And it makes a difference.
   So, I hope that the question means she is interested and I hope
that the progress that this country has made and will make in the
future will guarantee that a black teen-ager today, female, might
well be president of the United States.

<UNK>Farmers Fighting Mysterious Swine Illness</UNK>

<TEXT>
   A mysterious disease is striking infant pigs
on some Indiana farms and in some cases 100 percent of the
infected, weakened litters have died.
   Eight hog operations in Wabash County have been hit by the
disease, said farmer Dean Haupert, whose farm was stricken.
   ``We probably lost 30 litters,'' Haupert said. ``We're spending
a couple of thousand (dollars) a week on medication.''
   Purdue University scientists said other isolated cases have been
recorded across the state.
   ``At this stage no one knows exactly what the disease is,'' said
Kenneth B. Meyer, professor of veterinary adult education at Purdue.
   The illness strikes sows with a loss of appetite during the
latter part of their 113-day gestation period. Some farrows, or
litters, are stillborn. The survivors have weakened heart membranes
and cardiac muscles and a short life expectancy.
   In some hog operations, 100 percent of the weakened litters have
died.
   Farmers and veterinarians first identified the disease about
seven weeks ago, Haupert said.
   Purdue researchers are studying victims of the disease, hoping
to find links to similar illnesses that damaged hog populations in
North Carolina and Minnesota last year.
   ``Minnesota people called it the Plague of '88,'' said Kerry
Keffaber, a veterinarian with the Swine Health Center in Roann.
   Keffaber says infected herds in Wabash County have 150 to 600
sows each, producing 3,000 to 12,000 piglets each year.
   ``It isn't killing big hogs,'' said Lewis J. Runnels, veterinary
diagnostician for swine diseases at Purdue.
   The disease is similar to other illnesses that infect swine
herds, such as Aujesky's disease, more commonly known as
pseudorabies.
   The disease should not affect entire herds.
   ``It's not going to be a wipe-out disease,'' Meyer said.
   Medication has done little to help his infected sows and
piglets, Haupert said.
   Meyer suggested that hog producers with healthy swine near
infected herds should isolate their animals. Pets should not be
allowed to roam near an area where the disease has been prevalent
and then return to a healthy herd.

   Mayor Tom Bradley said Wednesday he couldn't
explain the narrow margin by which he won an unprecedented fifth
term of the nation's second-largest city.
   ``You can speculate. I've won some close ones and lost some
close ones. Winning is better. I am satisfied with the election,''
he said at a news conference.
   Pollsters had predicted the 71-year-old ex-cop and son of a
sharecropper would coast to victory. Instead, Bradley found himself
at one point Tuesday night barely maintaining the 50 percent needed
to avoid a runoff in June.
   ``Well, my friends. I've learned something in this election ...
never take anything for granted,'' he told supporters in his 1 a.m.
victory speech.
   ``I made a mistake during the campaign. I didn't make the kind
of vigorous all-out effort I could have or should have,'' Bradley
said. ``During the next four years, I will be a vigorous all-out
mayor.''
   A lackluster campaign and apparent voter apathy kept the turnout
at 17 percent, the lowest in decades, according to the City Clerk's
Office. Just 328,194 of the city's 1.9 million registered voters
cast ballots.
   Unofficial results showed Bradley with 156,724 votes, or 52
percent, to freshman Councilman Nate Holden's 84,376 votes, or
27.99 percent. Former county Supervisor Baxter Ward had 44,816
votes, or 15 percent. They were among 10 candidates.
   ``A little more time and more money, there could have been a
difference,'' said Holden, who gathered only $150,000 for his
campaign war chest compared to Bradley's $2 million.
   Holden told reporters Wednesday he would continue his campaign
to battle crime, drugs, traffic congestion and overdevelopment.
``The people are saying they are dissatisfied with the way this
city has been managed,'' he said.
   He said the outcome of the election conveyed two statements from
voters: ``The statement was that they are unhappy with the status
quo and that they want change. And another statement was that only
20 percent of the people felt enough confidence in this election
and their government to go on and continue to support it.
   ``The people are turned off with the process and I know that
more now than ever. And that is why they stayed at home.''
   Bradley earned the nickname ``Teflon mayor'' during the campaign
because political polls showed the city's 3 million residents held
him blameless for such things as rising crime, gang violence,
pollution and traffic congestion. Holden said his upstart campaign
showed that Bradley wasn't as invincible as he thought.
   The mayor drew his fiercest criticism in years just before the
election when the city attorney's office announced an ethics
investigation of him after learning the mayor performed consulting
work with Far East National Bank, which did business with the city.
Bradley returned the $18,000 he was paid by the bank and called the
charges politically motivated.
   In the Los Angeles Police Department, Bradley rose to the rank
of lieutenant before leaving police work for politics and election
to the City Council.
   Bradley, mayor since 1973, lost his first bid for the job in
1969 to incumbent Sam Yorty. He has twice run unsuccessfully for
governor, losing to Republican George Deukmejian in 1982 and 1986.
   Other mayoral candidates included Raul Reyes, who got 1.2
percent of the vote. The other candidates all received less than 1
percent.

   Some employees of American embassies and
consulates live too well at taxpayer expense, Rep. John Kasich,
R-Ohio, said Wednesday after convincing the House to limit luxury
overseas accomodations.
   On a voice vote, the House added to a State Department budget
bill Kasich's proposal to provide better-than-average rental houses
to fewer foreign service workers.
   A 1987 report by the State Department's inspector general
indicated the perk of plush housing had been extended beyond its
intended purpose of giving high-ranking officials appropriate homes
in which to entertain official guests.
   According to Kasich's office, the inspector general report and a
subsequent General Accounting Office inquiry discovered examples of
apparent abuse of the housing perk:
   _In Brussels, two childless couples were given six-bedroom homes.
   _In Manila, a couple with one child lived in a five-bedroom home.
   _In Hong Kong, every family routinely had rented homes with an
extra bedroom.
   A cross-check of 202 employees given the extra housing privelege
showed 30 of them spent no money for official entertaining,
Kasich's office said.
   The inspector general's report had indicated the perk of
upgraded housing, excluding the cost of maintaining homes for
ambassadors and deputy ambassadors, cost the government an average
$48,000 per embassy.
   In an interview in his Washington office, Kasich said pressure
from the State Department to water down his proposal came within 30
minutes of his distributing courtesy copies to colleagues.
   Even if the amendment doesn't survive the rest of the
legislative procedure _ it could be axed in the Senate or in a
conference committee _ ``the State Department has the message,'' he
said. ``You've got to put the bright light on them sometimes.''
   The amendment is attached to a measure authorizing $4.8 billion
in fiscal 1990 and $4.96 billion in 1991 for the State Department,
the U.S. Information Agency and other federal international
agencies.

   The killings linked to an alleged voodoo cult
of drug smugglers appear to be part of mixture of rites with
African and European elements, an anthropologist said Wednesday.
   Although human sacrifices were performed regularly in
pre-Columbian times, ``human ritual slayings are unheard of in
modern Mexico,'' said Fernando Winfield Capitaine, director of the
Veracruz Museum of Anthropology in Xalapa.
   ``Animal sacrifices are very common, however, as part of the
widespread superstition and witchcraft that exists in Mexico
nowadays,'' Winfield said in a telephone interview.
   Police in Matamoros, just across the border from Brownsville,
Texas, have uncovered more than a dozen human bodies apparently
used by drug smugglers practicing voodoo rites popularly known as
santeria.
   The smugglers apparently tried to offer the souls of others,
human and animal, to protect themselves from arrest and harm.
   Police had arrested several people and were looking on Wednesday
for the alleged ringleader, a Cuban in his late 40s named Adolfo de
Jesus Constanzo.
   U.S. officials say Constanzo apparently introduced elements of
santeria, a Caribbean Hispanic version of voodoo influenced by
Roman Catholicism, to the area.
   Police said the victims' bodies were mutilated and that they
found candles and kettles full of body parts and animal bones in
the ranch.
   ``I'll have to have more information and maybe look for myself
before I can analyze this further, but from what I saw on
television last night this doesn't seem to be any Mexican occult
ritual,'' said Winfield, who specializes in pre-Hispanic cultures
and their religious influence in modern times.
   ``They seem to be a Russian salad of rites from various satanic
cults which the people indulged in, probably crazed by drugs,'' he
said.
   Winfield said ``lamps'' found at the ranch were actually small
shot glasses blackened with soot and filled with wax, with a wick
stuck in the middle.
   ``These are quite common in Mexican witchcraft and are typical
of the European-Roman Catholic black magic rites inherited from
Europe,'' he said. ``But other elements like the kettles seem part
of the Haitian-African rituals practiced in many places, including
Cuba.''
   Winfield said the African rituals were brought by slaves from
Africa and adapted locally to the Catholic religion. In Brazil it's
known as ``macumbe,'' and in the Hispanic Caribbean, it's called
santeria.
   ``They vary from place to place, but the main elements are
almost all the same,'' Winfield said.
   Santeria is well-known in Florida's Latin community, especially
since 125,000 Cubans immigrated from the Cuban port of Mariel in
1980. Animal rights activists there have complained that
practitioners torture animals and may steal and slaughter pets.
   Santeria priests say animal sacrifice is legal under Florida law
if done humanely. Priests say they kill only chickens, pigs or
goats _ never cats or dogs _ and dispose of remains in a sanitary
manner.
   Southern Florida has dozens of santeria shops, called
``botanicas,'' that sell statues of gods, books of incantations,
colored beads and scents.
   In Mexican marketplaces, herbs and other items are sold for
witchcraft and the work of witch doctors, who are powerful figures
in rural areas where Indians still live much the way they did
before the Spanish came.
   During the Aztec Indian empire and other earlier cultures,
priests sacrificed slaves or prisoners of war to the gods by
cutting their hearts out or flaying or skinning them alive.
   ``Usually this involved a ceremony, usually a fertility rite,''
Winfield said.
   ``In modern Mexico witchcraft is very common and there are two
types _ black magic, which mainly tries to cause harm to an enemy,
and white magic, which seeks to do good like curing a disease,'' he
said.
   ``And, yes ... it is common to sacrifice animals like black
roosters,'' Winfield said.

   The self-declared state of Palestine, though
unrecognized by most of the world, has tended to one governmental
chore by declaring its own version of daylight-saving time starting
April 15.
   PLO-backed leaders of the uprising against Israeli occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip called for residents of the
territories to set their clocks ahead one hour for ``summer time in
the state of Palestine'' to last until Sept. 15.
   The call, in the latest underground leaflet from uprising
leaders, will put the territories on a different timetable than
Israel, at least for a while. Israelis do not turn their clocks
forward until April 29, after the Jewish Passover holidays.

   President Bush reported that he earned
$155,662 last year from business holdings kept in a blind trust, a
sum well above his $115,000 vice presidential salary.
   In the federal tax form that Bush filed jointly with his wife,
Barbara, the pair reported an adjusted gross income of $287,171.
   That was based on Bush's $155,662 in interest-and-dividend
earnings through partnerships and other interests, masked by the
blind trust, and his government salary. Also included was $7,147 in
other interest along with $12,362 in income from other sources,
primarily profits that Bush made from his partnership in a firm
that leased a liquefied natural gas transportation barge in
Louisiana.
   The Bushes paid taxes equivalent to 21.6 percent of their total
income, which was nearly $30,000 below the $308,396 income of 1987.
   The government withheld $29,480 from Bush's income last year,
and he made $65,404 in quarterly payments based on assuming what
his tax liability would be.
   When his 1988 federal tax liability of $62,106 was deducted from
the $94,884 total in money withheld or prepaid, Bush had overpaid
by $32,778. White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said he
applied $15,000 to next year's tax liability and pocketed $17,778.
   Meanwhile, the office of Vice President Dan Quayle released the
tax forms filed jointly by Quayle and his wife, Marilyn.
   The Quayles, who records show hold assets worth more than $1.4
million, reported an adjusted gross income of $156,546 last year,
the bulk of that coming from Quayle's $89,500 Senate salary.
   But the form also showed that Quayle, while a U.S. senator from
Indiana, earned $52,797 in speaking honoraria last year _ $16,997
above the maximum senators may accept.
   Quayle listed charitable contributions totaling $17,304, or just
a little above the $16,997 in speaking fees that he could not keep
for himself.
   The vice president's press secretary, Dave Beckwith, said Quayle
had written off the excess speaker's fees in an appropriate fashion.
   ``He earned more in honoraria than he's allowed to keep, so he
gave all the excess to charity,'' Beckwith said.
   The spokesman said Quayle gained no tax advantage by writing off
the extra speaking fees as charitable contributions, saying ``you
have (approximately) $17,000 more in income and $17,000 more in
deductions (to report), so it's a wash.''
   Quayle earned all his speaking fees before August, when the
Republican Party nominated him to be Bush's vice presidential
running mate.
   The balance of his $156,546 income came from interest, dividends
and capital gains relating to his family's Central Newspapers, Inc.
Quayle also made $2,000 as a director of Central Newspapers _ a
position he would have to relinquish under ethics legislation that
Bush proposed to Congress Thursday.
   Estimates on Bush's net worth have varied substantially,
although records show that the president, who made the bulk of his
money as an oil entrepreneur in Texas, has assets worth well over
$2 million.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``I would
say, however, that reports of his wealth are vastly over-estimated.
Most of his net worth is in the Kennebunkport (Maine) estate.''
   In his tax return, Bush reported a net capital gains loss,
through his blind trust transactions, of $3,480. The nature of the
loss was not divulged.
   After availing himself of the standard $3,000 deduction allowed
by law for such losses, Bush had a $458 loss which was carried over
to next year's capital gains losses _ a procedure permitted by the
U.S. Tax Code.
   Bush paid only $3,328 in state and local income taxes, with most
of that going to Louisiana in payment of taxes based on the income
generated by his partnership in the barge-leasing leasing
enterprise. The president's legal home address is in Houston, and
Texas has no state income tax. He did pay some taxes to other
states, Fitzwater said, but that, too, is sheltered from disclosure
by the blind trust.
   Bush also paid $19,034 in real estate taxes, with the bulk of
that involving the Walker's Point estate at Kennebunkport and the
remainder involving taxes paid on a vacant lot he owns in Houston.
   And he paid $277 in miscellaneous personal property fees on a
pickup truck, a Bronco vehicle and a boat he has in Maine.
   The Bushes donated $12,468 to charity, including contributions
to a host of church and civic organizations and donations to
foundations established in the memory of Edward Byrne, a New York
City policeman killed in the line of duty, and in honor of the late
Margaret Fitzgerald Grogan, the wife of presidential aide Gregg
Petersmeyer, who died of cancer.
   Bush also reported $9,998 in business-related expenses, of which
$9,712 was reimbursed by the government. The vice president is
given a $10,000 allowance for such expenses. But $286 of Bush's
claimed expenses were disallowed, and so he was therefore able to
deduct this from his tax liability.
   Fitzwater said he did know what Bush expense submissions were
rejected.

<HEAD>Brothers Protest Judge's Order Moving Siblings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILLMAR, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two young brothers carried picket signs to
protest a judge's order returning their younger brother and sister
to their mother, and threatened to sue the state if their siblings
are harmed.
   ``We're doing all we can to make (the judge) change his mind. If
they go back and die, I'm going to sue the state. If they go back,
they'll get in a lot of trouble,'' said Danny Carnes, 12.
   Danny and his brother Peter, 13, both of Willmar, picketed after
school Tuesday outside the Kandiyohi County Courthouse protesting
the order by District Judge John Lindstrom sending their brother
and sister, aged 9 and 10, to live with their mother.
   Danny said Lindstrom hasn't been receptive.
   ``We wrote a couple of letters to the judge, but he won't
listen,'' said Peter. ``I think he really does not care.''
   Not true, says Lindstrom.
   ``Nobody wants to put anybody in an abusive home. It's a tough
case,'' the judge said.
   Lindstrom, citing confidentiality, declined to comment on the
case but said the order sending the two children to their mother is
``still up in the air.''
   ``I'm very sensitive to this being a juvenile, confidential
case,'' said Lindstrom. ``I'm not sure what the final result is
going to be.''
   Lindstrom said his order is contingent upon the children's
mother meeting certain conditions before the children are returned,
such as having a home.
   ``I wouldn't characterize it as an abusive home,'' Lindstrom
said. He said he considered recommendations from all interested
parties, including social workers, family members and guardians, in
making his decision.
   Peter Carnes said that when his younger brother and sister
visited their mother recently, she told them they were going to
move and he'd never see them again.
   The boys said they and their younger brother and sister, as well
as another brother, have been living in separate foster homes for
about seven years.
   ``Our dad said he couldn't take care of all of us,'' Peter said,
adding that his foster home is with ``a real nice family.'' He said
Danny likes his foster family, too.
   Authorities would not release the parents' names.
   ``The boys have done this all on their own,'' said Doris Lyman,
Peter's foster mother.

<HEAD>Urns From Massacre Site Displayed At Army Museum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two urns holding soil from the Katyn
graves of 4,500 Polish officers were displayed at the army museum
Wednesday, indicating official Poland has come to terms with the
crime widely attributed to the Soviets.
   A trickle of mourners, some in tears, others carrying flowers,
visited the two small black containers, which Poles say have come
to symbolize Soviet crimes against their country.
   ``It is important historically that these facts are revealed,''
said a widow who stood before the memorial with her daughter.
   The officers, the cream of Polish society called up from the
reserves in World War II, were shot in the back of head and dumped
in mass graves in Katyn, near the Soviet city of Smolensk.
   For years, Poland's communist government stuck by the Soviet
accounting of events whereby the Nazis committed the murders in
1941 after invading the Soviet Union.
   But most historians believe the Soviet secret police carried out
the massacre in 1940, when the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were
still allied. And in recent months, the official Polish position
has changed.
   In 1987, Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev agreed to appoint a joint commission to
study ``blank spots'' in the two countries' histories.
   Polish members of the commission issued tentative conclusions,
based on what officials called circumstantial evidence, pointing to
Soviet responsiblity. Soviet members reportedly are still studying
the case.
   The government press has written about Katyn, a subject that had
been forbidden but not forgotten by Poles.
   The urns were brought from Katyn on April 5 by a delegation of
victims' families. They were placed first at a garrison church in
Warsaw where a Mass was celebrated by army chaplains.
   On Wednesday, the urns were moved to the army museum, where they
were placed on a pedestal bearing the words ``Soil from the Katyn
graves'' and draped with a long banner in Poland's red and white
colors.
   Overhead are hung embroidered flags from army units mustered in
pre-communist Poland before World War II. Officers stand at
attention on either side.
   In ceremonies scheduled for Tuesday, one urn will be placed on
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and another on a monument to the
Katyn victims at Warsaw's Powazki cemetery.
   The wording on the monument, which previously blamed ``Hitlerite
fascists,'' is being changed, but the government has not said what
the new phrasing will be.

   Seigenthaler: Mr. President there are three microphones. I see
George Chaplin from Honolulu here.
   Q. George Chaplin, The Honolulu Advertiser. How do you square
that excellent program you've just outlined to us, sir, with the
Tower nomination and your support right to the end?
   Bush: I see no contradiction whatsoever.
   As you know, I don't want to relive the Tower question, but I
believe that judgments should be made on _ on reality, not on
perception.
   I didn't like what happened, and I don't think that it's any
conflict at all with any of the four points I have made here today.
   So I'd simply _ and nothing convinced me from the hearings of
that, because I don't think that there was anything that was
pointed out too definitively that conflicts with what we've talked
about here.
   So I just would respectfully disagree with the conclusion that
the United States Senate reached, and I'm going to work with them.
   We're going forward now, and they promptly confirmed Dick
Cheney, but I just don't see any conflict there, at all.
   Seigenthaler: I can't see who it is at the far microphone, but
if you'll identify yourself.
   Q. Michael Pakenhan from the New York Daily News. Mr. President,
this week, the House committee reported out a bill which most of
the people in this room think would severely limit and hamper the
First Amendment. It would pass into law the so-called Fairness
Doctrine. The head-counters say that it will probably go through
both chambers quite comfortably. Will you stand with your
predecessor in vetoing that bill should it come to you?
   Bush: Well, I don't want to indicate that a veto will be
necessary, but I will stand with the previous position that I was a
part of in the last administration, yes, sir. (Applause.)
   Q. (Name inaudible) _ with The Washington Times. Mr. President,
since you've taken office, you've greatly increased the access to
the presidency on the part of the press. And you have taken such
initiatives as hosting small dinners in your private residence with
reporters and editors. This has sparked some debate _ and if I can
frame it, if you'll permit me to frame it in the spirit of our
morning session with Morton Downey and Geraldo Rivera and others _
``Is he trying to woo us, and may he succeed in seducing us?'' Mr.
President, if you would explain your philosophy to press coverage
of the presidency and the relationship with your administration. I
realize that some of the debate is probably our ability to
complain, no matter what kind of access we get. But I'd like to
hear your views of your relationship to the media.
   Bush: Well, in the first place, when Barbara and I invite a
reporter and her spouse, or a reporter and his spouse, to the White
House for an upstairs dinner, we're not _ we're doing that not to
seduce the press. (Light laughter.)
   We're treating them as human beings.
   And one of the reasons _ you've asked my press policy.
   One of the reasons I don't take questions over the sound of the
helicopter blades out there is I want to treat the press with the
dignity to which it is entitled.
   And if you have to get your question answered by screaming at me
when I don't want to answer it, you don't look very good, and I
don't think it's very good for the White House.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Urges Boycott In Response To Oil Spill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two consumer groups on Wednesday urged
motorists to boycott Exxon gasoline in response to the company's
Alaskan oil spill and subsequent gas price increases.
   The Citizen-Labor Energy Coalition and Citizen Action urged
holders of Exxon Corp. credit cards to cut up their cards and send
half of each to the ``Make Exxon Pay'' boycott office in Washington.
   The organizations said they would deliver the card pieces to
Exxon at the company's annual meeting May 18 in New Jersey.
   ``We are asking consumers to boycott Exxon not just because of
its environmental irresponsibility and recklessness, but also
because the company has raised its gasoline prices to make
consumers help pay for the clean-up'' of the March 24 oil spill in
Prince William Sound, said Edwin S. Rothschild, spokesman for the
groups.
   Rothschild said Exxon wholesale gasoline prices had risen more
than 11 cents per gallon since the accident, giving Exxon $25
million in additional revenue. He acknowledged that other oil
companies' gasoline prices also had risen in recent weeks, but said
this ``does not in any way diminish the need to teach Exxon a
lesson.''
   The rise in gas prices following the disruption of Alaskan crude
oil deliveries to West Coast refineries also has stirred concern on
Capitol Hill. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, has said his Energy
Regulation and Conservation subcommittee is investigating whether
the price increases were justified.
   In response to the consumer groups' boycott call, Exxon's New
York headquarters issued a statement reiterating its regret about
the oil spill.
   ``All of our customers are very valuable to us and we hope that
our effort in Alaska will convince them that we continue to be a
responsible company and one people like to do business with,'' the
statement said.
   The Citizen-Labor Energy Coalition is comprised of labor unions,
consumer organizations and senior citizen groups. Citizen Action is
a federation of state consumer groups.

<TEXT>
   City authorities on Wednesday suspended
the head of a hospital department where four nursing aides
confessed to at least 49 ``mercy killings,'' and they ordered the
exhumation of bodies of several presumed victims.
   Dr. Franz Pesendorfer's suspension follows mounting criticism of
his reported refusal to cooperate with police during an
investigation last year to find evidence of mass killings at
Vienna's Lainz hospital.
   Four assistant nurses arrested since Friday have confessed to
killing at least 49 elderly patients with overdoses of medicine or
by forcing water into their lungs. Most victims were in their 80s.
   Newspaper reports say the lives of 22 of the 49 victims could
have been saved if Pesendorfer had cooperated last year, when
senior investigator Max Edelbacher said police met ``a wall of
silence'' at the hospital.
   Pesendorfer defended his conduct on a national television
discussion Wednesday evening.
   Pesendorfer said he was told last April by a female doctor that
another doctor, Dr. Waschnig, learned in a wine bar of rumors that
patients were being ``put to rest'' by assistant nurses.
   Pesendorfer said he alerted doctors and senior nurses to the
rumor, and ordered an immediate blood test on an 84-year-old woman
who died unexpectedly days later.
   The blood test results prompted him to advise city medical
officials and the hospital director, and police were called,
Pesendorfer said.
   A later forensic test on the 84-year-old woman turned up nothing
suspicious, officials have said.
   Pesendorfer said Dr. Waschnig's name was mentioned in the
presence of police, although he was not identified as the source of
the rumor. A police report says Pesendorfer refused to give
investigators the name of the doctor who alerted him to the
possible killings.
   Austria's largest daily newspaper, Neue Kronen Zeitung, asserted
that if Pesendorfer and the second doctor ``had not kept quiet, it
would fairly certainly have been possible to stop the series of
murders a year ago.''
   ``As it was, however, the sadistic nurses could kill another 22
people,'' the newspaper said.
   Police have not confirmed media reports that 22 people were
killed in the past year.
   The killings reportedly began in 1983 at Lainz hospital's
Pavilion Five, dubbed ``the Death Pavilion'' by Neue Kronen Zeitung.
   On Wednesday, patients sat in stairwells, smoking cigarettes and
whispering about Pesendorfer's suspension, but they refused to talk
to reporters. So did Pesendorfer and hospital officials.
   The hospital refused to describe the function of the First
Medical Department, which Pesendorfer ran. However, it appears to
practice general medicine on people suffering ailments related to
old age.
   Mayor Helmut Zilk said he suspended Pesendorfer ``on the grounds
of the results to date of the police investigations.'' He declined
further comment.
   In a statement read on the television discussion program, Zilk
added the suspension was intended not as a judgement of Pesendorfer
but to facilitate further inquiries and encourage his staff to
speak out.
   Alois Stacher, chief of the city's health department, said the
suspension was linked to ``lingering lack of clarity'' over the
investigation.
   Pesendorfer consistently has defended his role and the conduct
of officials in his department at Lainz, Vienna's fourth-largest
hospital, since first word of the killings on Friday.
   Assistant nurses Maria Gruber, 25, Irene Leidorf, 37, and
Waltraud Wagner, 30, were detained Friday. Another assistant nurse,
Stephanie Mayer, 50, was detained Sunday after Ms. Ferrada-Avendano
went to police. She too was arrested after she admitted witnessing
one of the killings, Edelbacher said.
   Three other witnesses have come forward. Edelbacher said two say
they witnessed killings as patients in the hospital, while another
_ the daughter of a patient who has since died _ reported her
mother told her about killings at the hospital.
   The nursing aides have not been charged, but police say Ms.
Wagner alone has confessed to killing 39 patients.
   Her lawyer, Wilhelm Philipp, hinted it may be difficult for
police to get any murder charges to stick.
   He was quoted by Austria Press Agency as speaking of ``so-called
confessions'' to police and noting state prosecutors will have to
prove ``the murder really did happen'' because of his client's
actions.
   In an apparent attempt to get more evidence, city authorities
late Wednesday ordered the exhumation of the bodies of several
presumed victims. Officials declined to identify the bodies or say
how many will be exhumed.
   Pesendorfer is the first doctor or official suspended because of
the killings.

<HEAD>Bennett Asks For More Money, And More Freedom to Spend It</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National drug policy director William J.
Bennett asked Congress on Wednesday for a $12 million budget in
1990, an $8.5 million increase over the current budget, and freedom
to allocate the money as he sees fit.
   ``Why this amount? Why this growth? Given the fact that the 1989
appropriation of $3.5 million was intended to cover our operations
for only a portion of the year, and given the substantial tasks
facing this office, I believe it will become apparent that the $12
million proposed for 1990 is a very reasonable request,'' Bennett
told the House Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal
Service and general government.
   ``What's more, I believe it is vital to the advancement of this
nation's drug control efforts,'' he said, adding that it would be
spent to provide for 64 jobs, 24 more positions than appeared in
the budget proposed by then-President Reagan in January.
   In addition, Bennett requested a change in the appropriation
language to remove the earmarking of $7 million for staff and $5
million for research to give him greater flexibility in how the
money is spent.
   ``It is not clear to me yet what the size of this office should
be, what the strategy should be,'' he told the panel, adding,
however, ``I intend to keep this office lean and mean. I do not
intend to build a bureaucracy.''
   Asked why he wanted to merge the funds, Bennett said, ``There's
a lot of research going on in the 30-odd agencies involved in these
areas.'' It's possible, he said, that his office would not need to
spend money for research but could use that money instead for
personnel.
   Although he was pressed repeatedly by panel members for specific
plans for various agencies and budgets, such as the Customs Service
and the Drug Enforcement Administration, Bennett declined to
provide details.
   ``I'm essentially ... listening now to what people tell me. ...
I'm getting people's perspectives'' on how to structure the
national drug control strategy, which by law he must provide 180
days from his swearing in March 13.
   Bennett said the strategy, which will include priorities and
financing requests, will be completed by Sept. 5.
   Meanwhile, District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry Jr. said he
has a ``cordial'' relationship with Bennett, even though one of
Barry's top aides, and not the mayor himself, is handling the
district's involvement with Bennett's office.
   In releasing a multi-million dollar federal plan designed to
help the city curb its record murder rate, Bennett lashed out
Monday at Barry's government, and accused the city of letting the
drug problem grow ``out of control.''
   ``I don't want us to get sidetracked by any personalities or
debates,'' Barry said Wednesday after a meeting with other
Washington-area local government officials. ``The issue isn't
William Bennett and Marion Barry of the city government _ the issue
is the international trafficking of drugs.''

<HEAD>Bomb Kills One, Injures 40; Criticism from Sinn Fein</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded next to a
police station Wednesday, killing a young Roman Catholic woman and
injuring 31 civilians and nine police officers, authorities said.
   The hospital where the victims were taken received four warnings
of a blast at the police station, but all came after the bomb
exploded in a stolen van parked next to the station in the coastal
town of Warrenpoint in County Down.
   Suspicion fell on the Irish Republican Army. The group did not
immediately claim responsibility for the attack.
   The outlawed IRA is fighting to unite the province, where
Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-to-2, with the Catholic Republic
of Ireland.
   Gerry Adams, president of the IRA's legal political wing, Sinn
Fein, has urged the IRA to be more careful in its attacks.
   On Wednesday, he said: ``We are against the killing of
civilians. Sinn Fein does not condone in the strongest possible
terms what happened at Warrenpoint this morning.''
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said Joanne Reilly, 20, an office
worker at a hardware store next to the police station, died in the
explosion.
   Police said most of the injured were treated and released but
that five remained hospitalized at Daisy Hill Hospital in nearby
Newry. The hospital received the first bomb warning nine minutes
after the explosion, police said.
   Police said the blast ignited gas cylinders in the yard next to
the police station and touched off further explosions and a huge
fire. Windows up to a mile away were shattered, and the police
station and nearby buildings were heavily damaged, police said.
   Warrenpoint has a population of 6,500 and is less than a mile
from Northern Ireland's border with the Republic of Ireland.
   Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the Social Democratic and Labor
Party, the mainstream Catholic party, said ``people who carry out
this sort of attack listen to nobody. They simply have a murderous
desire in their hearts to kill.''
   Warrenpoint Council Chairman Eugene Markey condemned the attack
as ``total madness.'' He said the town had just started to attract
tourists, ``and now this happens.''
   The IRA killed 18 British army soldiers in an ambush outside
Warrenpoint on Aug. 27, 1979. The same day, Lord Louis Mountbatten,
India's last viceroy and a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, was killed
in an IRA bomb blast aboard his yacht off the coast of County Sligo
in the Republic of Ireland.

   The number of Americans who know their
cholesterol level has nearly doubled in a year, and more than four
in 10 say they have changed their eating habits to cut their
cholesterol, a poll said Tuesday.
   Among 1,016 people age 18 or over polled by the Gallup
Organization in January, 31 percent said they knew their
cholesterol level. A year before, when Gallup asked the same
question, just 17 percent knew.
   That increase ``clearly indicates that people are getting the
message'' that cholesterol can contribute to heart disease, said
Dr. DeWitt S. Goodman, the head of an advisory board on cholesterol
for Voluntary Hospitals of America Inc., which commissioned the
survey.
   The survey, conducted Jan. 9-22 and released by the organization
Tuesday, found that about two-thirds of respondents said they had
taken a blood test to check their cholesterol level, and four in 10
said they had changed their diet or eating habits in the past two
years to reduce their cholesterol.
   The hospital group sponsors ``Countdown USA,'' at which about
450 of its member hospitals offer free cholesterol and blood
pressure tests. The event this year is April 26; more than 400,000
people took the tests last year.
   The poll had a 3-point margin of sampling error.

   The Federal Aviation Administration said
Wednesday it plans enforcement action against more than 1,000
pilots who failed to report required information about alcohol or
drug-related convictions.
   The FAA said the pilots could have their medical certificates
revoked and their airman certificates suspended or revoked,
depending on the seriousness of the violations.
   The FAA said more than 6,000 names were obtained through
computer matches of FAA medical records and FBI criminal history
records and Florida state motor vehicle records.
   The search, the FAA said in a written statement, turned up ``a
significant number of airmen who appear to have falsified their
applications for airmen medical certification with regard to drug
convictions and drug or alcohol-related traffic convictions.''
   The FAA said that because of the large number of cases, the FAA
plans to focus its enforcement effort only on cases involving
convictions since Feb. 17, 1984, although it may take action in
severe older cases.
   The agency said it would also take action where necessary in
cases involving drug convictions but no falsification of
applications for FAA certificates.
   In a separate matter, the FAA proposed a new safety rule that
would increase the number of flight attendants that must be present
to supervise passenger boarding operations when an airliner is on
the ground.
   The proposal would mainly affect mid-size airline aircraft with
101 to 150 seats, and in many cases would require two attendants to
remain on board instead of one.
   The FAA said it was publishing the proposed rule in the Federal
Register this week and soliciting comment.

   And so what I've tried to do is have enough availability _ in
fact, I'm going to cross this one up as a press conference for the
record _ one more notch _ (laughter) _ so I can go to those
doubters and say, ``Look, we want to be accessible.''
   But I would separate out _ you know, I _ I don't know what we'll
do at Christmas.
   But what Barbara and I try to do at our house is say, ``Hey, you
and Joan and Jean, or whoever it is, come on to the Christmas
party'' and not have to have it all categorized and so afraid that
somebody thinks I'm trying to seduce some reporter that you have to
be treated as something so different than anybody else.
   And so, availability; don't get mad when they ask stuff you
don't like; and treat people as you would _ whatever walk of life,
or whatever occupation they come from.
   And if it's misinterpreted, fine, you don't have to come.
   And so I understand _ I remember back a few years ago when one
of the great news organizations said, ``OK, we're no longer going
to be used. We don't want any backgrounders or off-the-record.''
   Lasted about 30 seconds _ (laughter) _ and those reporters came
trooping back in.
   And _ but I respected that, if that's the way they want to do it.
   But please believe me that when we do it this way it's what we
feel is appropriate, and if it's not, I'll sure _ you know, I think
we'll take a hit _ but I'm unpersuaded by the gentle logic of
Morton Downey and whoever that other guy was that was here _

   Seigenthaler: Sir?
   Q. Mr. President, Jack Tinsley, Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Since
you've announced this ethics program for the executive branch, I'd
like to ask your comments about another situation involving ethics.
   Bush: Whoops. (Scattered laughter.)
   Q. That is, the long-running _
   Bush: Nice try, Jack. (Laughs.)
   Go ahead.
   Q. That is the long-running ethics committee investigation of
House Speaker Jim Wright. The Washington Times reported this
morning that the findings of this committee would be turned over to
the Justice Department for investigation of possible federal law
violations. And also, there is a belief by some in Texas that since
the rejection of John Tower as your first nominee for secretary of
defense, that there might be an attempt by the Republican Party to
retaliate against Speaker Wright. Would you comment on that, please?
   Bush: Well, let me comment on the last part first _ and I know
of no such retaliatory action.
   I think it would be impossible to do anyway, and it would be
wrong.
   And certainly, I would condemn anyone in our administration that
had any hand in anything of that nature.
   Secondly, there is nothing in this ethics package, when I call
for an even playing field _ Congress, executive branch and judicial
branch to have the same standards _ that should, in any way
directly or indirectly, be interpreted as intervening in the matter
now before the House ethics committee.

<HEAD>Soviet Scientists Claim To Duplicate U.S. Fusion Experiments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers at Moscow University have achieved
nuclear fusion at room temperature in tests similar to experiments
carried out in the United States, the official Tass news agency
said Wednesday.
   ``Under the guidance of Professor Runar Kuzmin, researchers at
the solid matter laboratory of the physics department of Moscow
University have confirmed the experiments of U.S. colleagues to
obtain nuclear fusion at room temperature,'' Tass said.
   Two weeks ago, scientists at the University of Utah and at the
University of Southhampton in Britain said they had achieved fusion
using ordinary laboratory equipment at room temperature.
   Their experiments used a rod of palladium and a coil of platinum
immersed in a beaker of deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen commonly
found in seawater, officials at the universities said.
   However, many experts reamined unconvinced that fusion actually
took place in those experiments, and some suggested the phenomenon
may be something new to science.
   Tass indicated similarities between the experiments at Moscow
University and the campuses in Britain and the United States.
   Kuzmin told Tass that researchers inserted electrodes _ an anode
and a cathode _ into a beaker of deuterium. The electrodes were
manufactured from titanium and palladium, he said.
   The researchers then applied electric current to the electrodes
until the water reached a boiling point ``and registered the
release of fast neutrons with the help of a detector,'' the news
agency said.
   ``It is precisely judging by the release of neutrons that one
can assert with confidence that the nuclear fusion reaction
actually takes place,'' Kuzmin said.
   He said the researchers made no attempt to calculate the ratio
of energy applied to the energy released.
   ``According to evaluations of U.S. scientists, this reaction
probably releases four times more energy than is expended to
`stimulate' nuclear fusion,'' he said.
   Anatoly Logunov, a rector of Moscow University, told Tass that a
program of fundamental research into the new type of fusion will
begin in the near future.
   At this stage, Logunov said, ``it is difficult to say whether
the reaction would be economically profitable for obtaining energy
on an industrial scale.''

   Oliver North testified Wednesday he thought he
was protecting President Reagan when he altered six Iran-Contra
``problem memos'' before investigators from the attorney general
could get a look at them.
   Appearing pale and on edge in his fifth day on the witness
stand, North hotly denied he ``had been working in a den of
thieves'' at the National Security Council. And he said the
documents he destroyed ``were only the tip of the iceberg''
compared to those in the hands of prosecutors.
   North said he was present, as the Iran-Contra affair was about
to burst into public view, when National Security Adviser John
Poindexter tore up a December 1985 presidential ``finding''
retroactively authorizing a shipment of missiles to Iran in a
failed effort to win the release of American hostages in Lebanon.
   Poindexter's testimony on destroying the document _ making no
mention of North's presence _ was one of the more startling
revelations during the congressional Iran-Contra hearings in 1987.
   ``Where is the finding now?'' Prosecutor John Keker asked North.
   A. I don't know.
   Q. What happened to it?
   A. I'm told it was destroyed.
   Q. By whom?
   A. Admiral Poindexter
   Q. When?
   A. Nov. 21-22-23 (1986).
   Q. When did you learn Admiral Poindexter destroyed the finding.
   A. I was there. I saw him tear it in two.
   North said high administration officials did not want the
finding exposed. It would have been an embarrassment, North said,
``because it looked like an arms-for-hostages swap.'' Reagan had
said often he would not negotiate with kidnappers.
   Keker asked whether North knew ``it was the only version in
existence ... the only paper in the entire world'' with Reagan's
authorization. North said he didn't know.
   During the congressional hearings Poindexter said of the
finding, ``I thought it was politically embarrassing so I decided
to tear it up, tore it up, and put it in a burn bag behind my
desk.''
   That same day, North said, Nov. 21, his former boss Robert
McFarlane reminded him to sanitize six notes which indicated
Reagan's or McFarlane's knowledge of what North had done for the
Nicaraguan Contras.
   North testified he had orders of a year's standing from
McFarlane to alter the memos.
   A list of the documents _ all memos he had sent to McFarlane on
the internal NSC computer network _ had been taped to his computer
terminal that whole year, North said.
   ``The gist of what he wanted removed from the documents was
language that would indicate his knowledge or the president's
knowledge about my activities in this time frame,'' North testified.
   North had been coordinating efforts to sell arms to Iran and to
help the Nicaraguan rebels at a time when the United States had
ordered an embargo on weapons to Iran and Congress had banned
official aid to the Contras. Reagan has said he authorized selling
arms to Iran but didn't know of the diversion of some profits to
the rebels.
   On Nov. 21, 1986, as the secret Iran-Contra dealings were
beginning to unravel in public, North told his secretary, Fawn
Hall, to make the changes in the memos. This was a day before aides
to Attorney General Edwin Meese III searched North's office.
   ``Mr. McFarlane asked me if certain things had been taken care
of,'' North said. ``He asked me point blank whether it had been
done and I said, `No, not yet,' that I would get around to it.''
McFarlane had left the National Security Council the previous
December, but North said he felt he had to carry out the order.
   ``I had been led to believe that everything I was doing was done
at the direction of the president,'' he said.
   ``You had been told by the president of the United States to
destroy documents _ explain how you had come to that conclusion?''
Keker asked.
   ``Because everything I had done that was described in the
documents on this list I had been told was at the direction of the
president,'' North replied.
   North's testimony contradicts McFarlane, who said it was North
who proposed making changes to the documents in late summer 1985.
   Meanwhile, President Bush said he still considers North, a
decorated Vietnam veteran, a national hero because ``anybody that
gets a Purple Heart, sheds his blood fighting for his country,
deserves to be called an American hero.''
   Bush has refused to answer questions about trial documents
concerning his own involvement in the Iran-Contra affair, saying he
doesn't want to prejudice North's trial. He said again Wednesday,
``The last thing I want to do is intervene in that matter that is
now before the courts.''
   A document introduced at North's criminal trial this week
seemingly supported the idea that Bush, then vice president, knew
in 1985 that Honduras was being rewarded for its support of the
Contras with additional U.S. aid.
   The document, a Feb. 20, 1985, National Security Council draft
memo, bears the handwritten notation, ``We want VP to also discuss
this matter'' with Honduran President Roberto Suazo, next to a
typewritten section detailing the tradeoff.
   A 42-page summary of Reagan administration Iran-Contra dealing
with other countries was introduced at the trial last week. It said
Bush met with Suazo and told him about enhanced U.S. aid shortly
after the arrangement was made for Honduras to help the Contras,
but it did not say whether Bush knew of the connection.
   Three of the 12 charges on which North is being tried concern
the altering of documents. Keker, like North a former Marine who
had served in Vietnam, hammered away on Wednesday at the
circumstances of the changed memos.
   Earlier Wednesday, North blamed McFarlane for sending a letter
to Congress that falsely denied the NSC staff was assisting the
Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   ``I wrote a number of other letters'' that were ``inconsistent
with the facts. ... I just simply do not believe I wrote this
letter.''

   Soviet arms control inspectors decided
Wednesday to conduct ``short-notice'' inspections at Cape
Canaveral, Fla., and Huntsville, Ala., under terms of the treaty
banning medium-range nuclear weapons, the Pentagon announced.
   The Soviet inspection teams had arrived in Washington on Tuesday.
   Cmdr. Ken Pease, a Pentagon spokesman, said one 10-member team
specified a visit to a missile storage facility at the Redstone
Army Depot in Huntsville. The other 10-member team asked to inspect
Complex 16 at Patrick Air Force Base near Cape Canaveral.
   Complex 16 was once used as a launch test center for the
Pershing II and ground-launched cruise missiles that are covered by
the treaty.
   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty authorizes the
United States and Soviet Union to conduct 20 short-notice
inspections this year as part of the procedures to verify the
destruction of all medium-range missiles.
   To date, the Soviets have performed 12 short-notice inspections,
eight of them at European facilities and four inside the United
States.

   A reporter for the Columbia (S.C.) State was in
Tbilisi, Georgia with a group of high school exchange students when
a weekend street protest turned into a deadly melee that made
headlines worldwide. She filed this report for The Associated
Press.

<TEXT>
   At 5 a.m., Alex Raley stepped onto the
balcony of his fourth-floor hotel room in Tbilisi and looked down
onto a street filled with protesters, Soviet soldiers and armored
personal carriers.
   As Raley, an educator from South Carolina, and his wife watched
in the glow of streetlights, what began as a demonstration for
independence for Soviet Georgia turned into a bloody clash that
left at least 19 people dead.
   ``At first, we weren't concerned when we heard the loud
noises,'' Raley said. ``But then we saw Soviet soldiers with metal
shields and night sticks, 10 to 15 soldiers deep, filling the
entire street.
   ``They were literally pushing hundreds of students, who at that
time started throwing stones.''
   Raley said the soldiers were followed by tanks. He said students
who were beaten during the fighting ducked into alleyways and shops
along Tbilisi's main thoroughfare, Rustaveli Street, for medical
care. He said 15 ambulances came to help the injured after the
tanks ran through the street.
   Raley was accompanying 15 high school exchange students from
Columbia, S.C., who had been staying with Georgian families. They
were flown out of Tbilisi on Tuesday at the request of the Soviet
government and now are staying in Moscow until arrangements can be
made for the students to finish their exchange in another city.
   All the American students slept through the Sunday morning
conflict in the safety of their hosts' homes.
   Clare Coggeshall, 16, said, however, she woke after hearing a
woman ``wailing for hours.''
   ``I remember thinking that I wished she would shut up,'' she
said.
   The next morning, Ms. Coggeshall discovered the woman was the
mother of one of the demonstrators killed.
   The scene was far different from the almost-festive atmosphere
the young South Carolinians had found on Wedneday, April 5, when
they first arrived in this city 900 miles south of Moscow.
   On Sunday, black banners hung from balconies, broken glass
littered the strets along with torn official Soviet Georgian flags
_ red with a blue strip running across the top. A mural near the
center of town reading, ``Brotherhood throughout the U.S.S.R.,''
was charred at the bottom from being set on fire.
   The streets were deserted, and Red Army soldiers broke up any
gatherings of more than a few people.
   Some of the American students, fearing their parents would be
worried, had gathered at one of the homes to try to call home to
America. They had no luck.
   Their teacher, Sherry Beasley, waited by her phone hoping to
hear from the U.S. Embassy or the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Partnership, the
organization that arranged the trip. Neither, she later learned
after reaching Moscow, could get through on the jammed telephone
lines.
   Raley, his wife and a crew of four from South Carolina
Educational Television, who were along to film the student
exchange, were trapped in the Hotel Tbilisi, barricaded on both
sides by tanks. None of the Americans had their passports or Soviet
visas with them; the documents had been taken two days earlier to
register them for a trip to the mountains.
   It was one of the many sightseeing trips the students never got
to take because of the demonstrations.
   When the teen-agers first arrived, their Georgian hosts told
them _ with a touch of embarrassment _ that students in Tbilisi had
been protesting for three days, making travel a little difficult.
   Their attitude about the protests was so casual, however, that a
few jokes were cracked about its being an attempt by the university
students to get out of going to class.
   As the young Americans drove into the city, they passed
thousands of Georgians jamming Rustaveli Street, holding hands,
singing and carrying traditional, homemade Georgian flags of
maroon, black and white.
   Many of the protesters were part of a hunger strike, and they
sat wrapped in blankets on the steps of the local television
station. Others, crowding the narrow backstreets, had set up pup
tents in church backyards.
   Speeches were given through bullhorns every day at the
Government Palace, hub of the demonstrations.
   By Friday, the State Museum and Tbilisi School No. 1, both near
the palace, were shut down because of crowds clogging the street.
On Saturday afternoon, electricity was cut off to many parts of the
Georgian capital. Rumor had it that power was turned off to silence
loudspeakers at a rally set for 5 p.m.
   Several Georgian families quietly made preparations to move the
American teen-agers to the nearby mountains or in with relatives on
the outskirts of town.
   Students, growing a bit homesick, found they could not contact
America or even Moscow by telephone. Their isolation did not end
until they were whisked out of Tbilisi on Tuesday morning, passing
through army barricades on the way to the airport.
   The students clung to their Georgian families before leaving,
saying they felt safe and did not want to go to Moscow.
   ``We're just so worried for them,'' said Melissa Milling, 16.
``We had gotten so close to them. We don't want to leave them
behind.''
   Twelve Georgian students had stayed with the American students
in February in South Carolina, and the exchange was supposed to
last for three more weeks in Tbilisi.

   Army officials said Wednesday the arrest of
four alleged leaders of the Palestinian uprising was a major blow
to the 16-month-old revolt, but Palestinians said the captures
would not end their struggle.
   Also Wednesday, police charged a Jewish settler leader, Rabbi
Moshe Levinger, with manslaughter in the death last year of an Arab
shopkeeper in the West Bank town of Hebron.
   In clashes in the occupied Gaza Strip, troops shot and wounded
15 Palestinians, including a 7-year-old boy, Arab hospital
officials said. The army confirmed five casualties.
   At least 423 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have died in the
violence, which began in December 1987.
   The Palestinians, whose arrests were announced Tuesday, are
accused of belonging to the Unified National Leadership of the
Uprising, an umbrella group of PLO and Moslem fundamentalist
factions.
   The Unified Leadership coordinates the uprising by issuing broad
strategy directives through underground leaflets. Daily activities
are usually planned by local popular committees.
   ``It's clearly a blow to the uprising. These were organizers.
These were experienced leaders at the executive level,'' Col.
Ranaan Gissin, an army spokesman, said of the March 5 arrests.
   But Palestinians said the leaders would be replaced quickly.
   ``It is an uprising of the people, not of a few individuals,''
said Radwan Abu Ayyash, head of the Arab Journalists Association.
   Two of the detainees, Saman Khouri, 41, and Adnan Shalalda, 35,
were remanded into custody Wednesday by a military court.
   Khouri allegedly belongs to the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, a radical pro-Syrian PLO faction.
   The charge sheet said he was instrumental in channeling $1.5
million from the PLO overseas to PLO factions in the occupied lands
and that he helped write two underground leaflets.
   Khouri denied the charges. ``I did not do any of the things I'm
charged with,'' he said Wednesday.
   Shalalda was accused of being a member of the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist pro-Syrian PLO faction. He
has also pleaded innocent.
   The two others, journalists Taher Shaludi, 35, and Hassan Abed
Rabbo, 28, have not been formally charged.
   Shaludi allegedly is a member of the Palestinian Communist
Party, and Abed Rabbo is accused of belonging to Fatah.
   ``These are the leaders of the four major terror organizations
operating in the occupied territories,'' said an army official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Levinger, meanwhile, was charged with manslaughter, causing
bodily harm in aggravated circumstances and intentionally damaging
property.
   The charges stem from a Sept. 30, 1988 incident in which
Levinger allegedly opened fire on stone throwers in Hebron after
they smashed his car windows.
   Levinger, 54, left the car, and fired in the air from his
pistol, the charges said. He then shot and killed Kayed Hassan
Salah, 42, a shoe store owner who was standing outside his shop.
One of Salah's customers was also wounded, the charges said.
   The Jerusalem-born rabbi said he was not officially informed of
the charges.
   Levinger is at the forefront of the Jewish settlement movement
in the occupied territories. A year after Israel captured the lands
in the 1967 Middle East war, Levinger founded the Jewish settlement
of Kiryat Arba outside Hebron.
   About 70,000 Jews live among 1.7 million Palestinians in 130
settlements in the occupied lands.

   Moslem and Christian forces turned their
howitzers on residential areas of Beirut on Wednesday, killing 12
people in a withering attack on the eve of the civil war's 14th
anniversary.
   The leader of the Christian army said the fighting had reduced
Lebanon to ``a cadaver in a coffin'' and urged the superpowers to
help end the fighting.
   The shelling duel was the fiercest since the Arab League called
a cease-fire in Lebanon a week ago. It began a few minutes after a
group of right-wing Christian politicians left Beirut for more
peace talks in Kuwait.
   The barrage, which shattered an overnight lull, took civilians
by surprise and forced them to rush back to bunkers and underground
bomb shelters.
   Shopkeepers lowered their shutters, employees ran out of their
offices and pedestrians ran in all directions seeking shelter.
   The whooshing sound of outgoing rockets and the thuds of shell
explosions rocked Beirut's Moslem and Christian sectors.
   Black smoke billowed from west Beirut's Corniche Mazraa
commercial thoroughfare and the low-income Cola district. Fire
engines raced to battle the blaze, police said.
   Motorists sped away after a shell slammed into the seaside
boulevard near fish restaurants in Moslem west Beirut's Raouche
district.
   French Ambassador Paul Blanc told reporters a shell scored a
direct hit on the French Embassy compound in the Christian suburb
of Hazmiyeh. ``It inflicted damage, but no casualties,'' Blanc said.
   A Lebanese Christian security guard at the U.S. Embassy was
found shot to death near the embassy compound in a suburb north of
Beirut Thursday, police reported. Elias Haddad, 24, was shot in the
head, and his body was dumped in a building entrance about a mile
from the compound in Aukar, they said.
   Police said 12 people were killed and 38 wounded in the daylong
bombardment of Moslem and Christian residential districts in the
capital.
   In all, 192 people have been killed and 657 wounded in the most
recent round of fighting, which began March 8 between army
commander Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly Christian troops and an
alliance of Syrian and Druse forces.
   Aoun called a news conference to renew his demand for a Syrian
withdrawal. ``The Syrian occupation is as ruthless and barbarian as
the Israeli occupation'' of a strip of southern Lebanon, Aoun said.
   Asked what has been achieved since he declared a ``war of
liberation'' three weeks ago to drive the Syrians out, Aoun said:
   ``Lebanon has been a cadaver in a coffin we were carrying for
burial in a funeral procession spanning 14 years. Now the cadaver
bolted straight up from the coffin to declare it's very much alive.
But the Syrians unleashed their bombing wrath to finish it off
anew.''
   He called on the United States and the Soviet Union to ``stop
looking the other way. Otherwise you will both be haunted by the
Lebanon curse forever.''
   Both sides blamed each other for starting Wednesday's artillery
duel.
   The latest round of fighting began after Aoun, who also heads
the Christian military Cabinet in Lebanon's divided government,
ordered a blockade of illegal ports run by Moslem militias. The
militias, led by Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, responded by
shelling Beirut port and the Christian enclave.
   Later, Syrian gunners joined in the shelling and supported a
land blockade of the Christian heartland by Moslem troops.
   Lebanon's civil war enters its 15th year Thursday, and the
fighting and the divided government threaten the nation with
permanent sectarian partition.
   The war started after Christians became alarmed at the surge in
Palestinian guerrilla power in Lebanon and Moslems demanded an
equal share of power with the Christians, who dominated Lebanon
since independence from France in 1943.
   At that time Christians were in the majority but now Moslems
have become the majority, making up an estimated 55 percent of the
4 million population. The Christians have refused to surrender
their long-held privileges.
   Since 1975, Lebanon has become the battleground for regional
powers such as Syria and Israel. The civil war has degenerated into
a web of overlapping conflicts between rival factions that has
defied all peace efforts, including the ill-fated intervention of
the U.S.-led Multinational Force in 1982.
   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker recently said the Americans
plan no new initiative in Lebanon. The United States is still
haunted by the deaths of more than 240 Marines killed by a Shiite
Moslem suicide bomber on Oct. 23, 1983.
   Concern for the fate of 15 foreign hostages, including nine
Americans, held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian extremists also
contributes to the reluctance of U.S. officials to become involved.

<HEAD>WASHN: ethics committee.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   And thirdly, Jack, you'll have to _ and I know there's this
interest, particularly in your area and in my state, and I think
it's wider than that now in the matters that are going forward
there _ but the last thing I want to do is involve myself in any
way.
   And please believe me, there is no _ on my view, I answered the
first question as frankly as I could about the John Tower matter _
but in terms of getting even or something of that nature by
unfairly intervening into a process that is now being handled by
the ethics committee in the House, I simply wouldn't condone that
at all, and I would condemn it.
   So, I want to separate out what's happening there from this
package, and certainly in response to your question, from any
politics of retaliation because of my view that the Tower matter
was not handled the way I would like to have seen it handled.
   Seigenthaler: Mr. President, if we could go the far _ if you
pardon the expression, the far right, it's really their far left.
(Scattered laughter.)
   Q. Mr. President, Dan Martin, the Herald-Dispatch, Huntington,
W.Va. At this point in time, would you call Ollie North a real
American hero?
   Bush: Anybody that gets a Purple Heart and sheds his blood
fighting for his country deserves to be called an American hero.
   And it was in that context that I made those claims, and it is
that context that I will repeat them.
   And the last thing I want to do is intervene in that matter that
is now before the courts.
   But that's how I feel about those who risk their lives to save
this country.
   Seigenthaler: I can't tell who this is.
   Q. Mr. President, Don James of the Times Record-News in Wichita
Falls, Texas. In view of the fact that there's a program on the
table to put a space establishment in Houston and the super
collider is going to be built in Jack's backyard, or has been
selected to be built in Jack's backyard, and two or three of the
top administrative officials are from Texas, is there a real
backlash developing because of that? We saw the Georgia Mafia, we
saw the California Mafia talked about by the press, is this going
to happen and is it going to hurt your program?
   Bush: No. (Scattered laughter.)
   No, we've made appointments that are excellent in my view, men
and women outstanding and the fact that some of them come from my
home state, hey, what's wrong with that?
   And the super collider decision was made by President Reagan.
   It's a good decision.
   I want to support it.
   The space center was made by _ I guess, when President Johnson
was in office, or maybe under President Kennedy, I'm not sure.
   And it should have strong support.
   But I don't see any risk of backlash at all provided that you
get people that measure up, and that's what I'm trying to do.

   President Bush urged a ban on campaign
contributions by political action committees and said he opposed
federal financing of congressional races Wednesday as he unveiled
proposals to tighten ethical rules for Congress, judges and the
executive branch.
   ``We've got to work together to reform a public code of conduct
that, at times, appears to be in disarray,'' Bush said. ``And it's
not logical or fair _ it's both too harsh and too lenient and it
elevates detail over substance, precept over principle.''
   Bush announced his program in a speech to the annual convention
of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Most of his proposals
were embraced in a legislative proposal he sent to Congress or an
executive order he signed during the day.
   Suggesting a major change in the way congressional campaigns are
financed, Bush called for a halt to campaign contributions from
political action committees, which pumped nearly $156 million
directly into congressional races last year.
   ``We have allowed our parties to become weakened and
overshadowed by special interests, and we can best restore the role
of the parties by limiting political action committees,'' Bush said.
   ``PACs weaken the parties, restrain competition and deaden the
political debate,'' the president added.
   Aside from the $156 million in direct contributions, PACs spent
$6.8 million to help specific congressional candidates, but the
money went for such expenses as television commercials and mailings
with nothing going directly into the candidates' campaign
treasuries, according to records at the Federal Election Commission.
   Bush's presidential campaign received $862,950 in direct
contributions from PACs last year and benefitted from million of
dollars the PACs spent independently on its behalf. One PAC alone,
the National Security Political Action Committee, spent $8.1
million to help Bush, according to FEC records.
   Stopping short of offering a formal proposal, Bush said he would
consult with Congress on PAC funds. Brushing aside a plan espoused
chiefly by Democrats, Bush added, ``I also oppose federal funding
of congressional campaigns.''
   If adopted, the net result of Bush's recommendations would be
for congressional races to be financed by private contributions,
already limited by law to $1,000 per candidate per election.
   Bush urged Congress to eliminate a provision of law allowing
legislators to convet leftover campaign funds to personal use, as
is permitted for anyone who held office before 1980.
   ``Political donations should not become a sort of individual
retirement account for members of the United States Congress,'' the
president said.
   In a question and answer session with the editors, Bush said:
   _He has given ``a full accounting'' of his role in the Reagan
administration's secret program to supply the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua.
   Referring to reports about his role, emanating from the trial of
former White House aide Oliver North, Bush said, ``I don't like
reading charges that I happen to feel are untrue but I have to
stand on that, and that just goes with the territory.''
   He said he still considers North a hero based on his decorated
service in the Vietnam war.
   _Said the federal government had moved ``much more quickly and
more boldly than it gets credit for'' in the cleanup of Alaska's
oil spill. Nevertheless, he said ``maybe I should accept some
criticism on whether I should have'' sent in federal troops a week
earlier than he did.
   _He would not commit himself to veto the Fairness Doctrine if it
is reinstated by congressional action. Then-President Reagan vetoed
a renewal of the regulation last year and Bush said ``I will stand
with the previous position'' of the Reagan administration.
   _His off-the-record social contacts with reporters were not
intended ``to seduce the press. We're treating them as human
beings.''
   Among the main points of his ethics proposals, Bush called for a
25 percent pay increase for federal judges, coupled with a ban on
members of the judiciary accepting speaking fees and other
honoraria.
   Bush said he supported higher pay for Congress as well as a ban
on honoraria for lawmakers, but would not make a specific proposal
until he consulted with legislative leaders.
   ``There is no point, absolutely no point, in putting Congress
through another traumatic bashing like the one just completed,'' he
said. After a public uprising, Congress killed a 51 percent pay
increase for itself earlier this year.
   Bush proposed that members of Congress and senior personnel in
the judicial and congressional branches who leave the government be
barred from lobbying their former colleagues for one year.
   Executive branch employees, already subject to such a ban, would
be prohibited from contact with any executive branch agency.
   Bush also said that members of Congress should be covered by the
same independent counsel law that has been used in authorizing
investigations of alleged improprieties by members of the executive
branch.
   The president said that ``a practice is either ethical or it is
not. And if Washington is to be a level playing field, then every
player should be treated the same.''
   In his executive order, Bush barred senior government officials
from serving on the boards of profit-making enterprises. He
proposed that the ban be extended to congressional and judicial
officials as well.
   The executive order also would give elevated rank to a
designated ethics officer in each department.
   Full-time presidential appointees, White House employees and
Office of Policy Development employees also would be barred from
receiving any outside earned income.

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Warsaw Pact on Wednesday unveiled a detailed
proposal to NATO for starting negotiations to eliminate short-range
nuclear weapons in Europe in a move that could widen differences
within the Western alliance.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization already has rejected
previous Soviet pressure to begin talks aimed at reducing or
eliminating the tactical nuclear weapons, which have a range of
less than 310 miles.
   But a growing number of people in West Germany, a key NATO
country, have expressed doubt the short-range weapons are still
needed because of a perceived reduction of the East bloc threat.
   Warsaw Pact foreign ministers, ending a two-day meeting in East
Berlin, issued a communique proposing ``separate negotiations in
the near future on tactical nuclear weapons in Europe.''
   The communique said ``preparations for the proposed
negotiations, its mandate and who should participate can be
discussed in special consultations,'' which it said the Warsaw Pact
countries are ready to begin immediately.
   Most of NATO's short-range nuclear weapons are based in West
Germany.
   The Warsaw Pact also said both sides should agree not to
modernize their short-range nuclear weapons. The Warsaw Pact has
previously denounced NATO's modernization plans, which also are
opposed by a growing number of West Germans.
   ``The member states of the Warsaw Pact are of the opinion that a
decision not to modernize tactical atomic weapons would create a
favorable atmosphere for such negotiations...'' the communique said.

   President Bush said Wednesday he still
believes the federal government should not have taken over the
Alaskan oil spill cleanup effort, although he conceded it could
have gotten involved earlier.
   Fielding questions after a speech to a convention of the
American Society of Newspaper Editors, Bush maintained the
administration moved ``more quickly and more boldly than it gets
credit for.''
   But at the same time, he said, ``Maybe I should accept some
criticism'' that he should have moved earlier than April 7 to step
up federal involvement in the environmental disaster off the coast
of Alaska.
   Bush said that he now believes the federal government ``is
properly involved'' in that effort and said ``we should not have
done what some are urging upon us _ federalizing that whole
cleanup.''
   Last Friday, Bush put Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner in
charge of coordinating actions by federal agencies in connection
with cleaning up the spill from the Exxon Valdez in Prince William
Sound. He also ordered the Defense Department to make military
troops and equipment available to assist in the effort.
   Bush said that while he was pleased the federal government has
stepped up its involvement in the cleanup, ``I would also like to
see more volunteers involved.'' The president said he believes
liability laws should be eased to that volunteer groups won't be
kept from helping out because of fears by the government of
potentially ``outrageous liability claims.''
   ``We have moved forward on the cleanup,'' he said. ``The first
was containment, and now it's mainly in the cleanup phase, although
there still are some containment problems.''
   On other matters, Bush said:
   _He often invites reporters to private White House social
events, although he is not doing it to get friendlier coverage from
the White House press corps.
   Bush said he and first lady Barbara extend such invitations
``not to defuse the press _ treating them as human beings.''
   _He knows of ``no retaliatory action'' taken by his
administration because of the Senate defeat of former Sen. John
Tower as a nominee to be secretary of defense.
   Bush was asked if there any plans by the Republican Party to
retaliate against House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, who is under
investigation by a House panel for alleged ethics violations.
   ``I think it would be impossible to do, anyway,'' Bush said,
``and it would be wrong, and certainly I would condemn anyone in
our administration that had any hand in anything of that nature.''

   Seigenthaler: Mr. President, I apologize. I neglected the far
left. Some would say it was out of character with me but _
(laughter).
   Bush: Note that he said that, not I.
   Go ahead.
   Q. Lou Ureneck, Portland Press-Herald. Mr. President, I live and
work in a state with a 2,500 mile coast line, a coast line that
includes an oil terminal as well as the village of Kennebunkport.
I'm wondering why it took so long for the government to move on the
Alaskan oil spill. Why didn't the government _ the federal
government _ move more boldly, more quickly to clean up the spill?
   Bush: I think the federal government moved much more quickly and
more boldly than it gets credit for.
   I consider the United States Coast Guard a part of the United
States government.
   And the Coast Guard moved very rapidly.
   What we did not want to do, and I am convinced now even in
retrospect that this decision is correct, was to relieve the Exxon
Corporation of its liability by federalizing.
   And when I promptly sent our able EPA administrator, and our
head of the Coast Guard, Admiral Yost, and Sam Skinner, the
secretary of transportation up there, they came back with the
unanimous recommendation that federalizing wasn't appropriate.
   The federal assets _ we have moved forward now on the cleanup.
   The first was containment and now it's mainly in the cleanup
phase, although there still are some containment problems.
   Subsequently _ and maybe I should accept some criticism on
whether I should have done this a week before we did, or something
of that nature, of giving you the reasons.
   But I think that the federal government is properly involved but
should not _ we should not have done what some are urging upon us,
federalize that whole cleanup.
   And you know, it's a tough one.
   I do know the corner of the Maine coast you're talking about and
something about the pristine nature of Prince William Sound.
   And I do have a great concern about the environment.
   I want to do better.
   I want to do better and set higher standards in the environment.
   But I also happen to believe that the national security needs of
this country are served by having production offshore and by
producing oil from the North Slope.
   And it is awful hard to guarantee against a contingency in a
10-mile _ where in a 10-mile-wide channel after thousands and
thousands and thousands _ put it millions _ barrels have gone
through there safely, and now apparently what _ human error seems
to have caused this aberration.
   It's hard to have a contingency plan against that.
   And the other day they asked me about that and said, ``Well'' _
you know, because there were some saying, ``Well, you ought to shut
down the oil coming out of Prince William Sound, coming through _
you know, around the Port of Valdez.''
   And I said, ``Well, to guarantee against what happened, should
we shut down all the production off of Louisiana and Texas?''
   I'm not sure I understand the difference.
   And I think we have got to do everything we can to learn from
this.
   We've got to do everything we can to have a plan that is based
not on a third of the spill, but on the totality of this spill in
terms of _ in terms of recovery.
   But I simply do not want this disaster to _ this isn't on your
question, but projecting a little _ to weaken the national security
interests by making us further and further dependent on foreign oil.
   We're about up to 50 percent now, and that is not a good enough
standard.

<TEXT>
   The secretary general of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization challenged Warsaw Pact nations Wednesday to
begin reducing their short-range nuclear weapon strength if they
are interested in talks with the West on the subject.
   Manfred Woerner made the comment after meeting with President
Bush and advisers at the White House concerning NATO strategy,
East-West relations and preparations for the NATO summit May 29-30
in Brussels, Belgium, which Bush will attend.
   Warsaw Pact ministers meeting in East Berlin on Tuesday called
for negotiations with NATO on tactical short-range nuclear weapons.
   ``This is no news; they have repeatedly stated such
intentions,'' Woerner told reporters.
   ``I would call to your attention that they have 14 times more
short-range weapons than we have,'' he said. ``It would be a good
idea, if they are interested, to reduce and start to build down
their short-range nuclear weapons.''
   A White House statement said Bush and Woerner met for half an
hour. It said they discussed ``NATO summit preparations, the
continuing validity of NATO strategy and developments in the Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe.''
   ``The president emphasized the success of the alliance in
keeping the peace and promoting prosperity for 40 years, and his
desire that their May summit project a broad vision of the
alliance's future,'' the statement said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, National Security Adviser
Brent Scowcroft and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu attended
the meeting.
   The suggestion in East Berlin came in a speech by Polish Foreign
Minister Tadeusz Olechowski, who said the Warsaw Pact ministers had
agreed that progress in the Vienna conventional arms talks last
month should be broadened to include ``the start of negotiations on
tactical nuclear weapons.''
   Woerner said he and Bush ``discussed a broad range of
disarmament questions including conventional arms.''
   ``The first part, of course, is to get the Soviets to agree to
our proposal, reduce, come down to lower levels and equal ceilings
and then of course, the president as much as NATO is interested to
consider further steps. But first, let us come and make a success
out of our proposal,'' he said.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III asked
Congress on Wednesday to quickly approve a $49.7 million bipartisan
aid plan for the Contra rebels to set up an acid test of the
willingness of Nicaragua's Sandinista government and its Soviet
allies to support the peace process.
   The House Appropriations Committee voted 32-10 to recommend the
compromise plan be adopted. The Senate appropriations panel
approved it, 18-4.
   The proposal, which could reach the House floor by Thursday, is
likely to be approved by both chambers, putting at least a
temporary end to years of controversy and divisiveness over former
President Reagan's policy of arming the Contras.
   Baker said the new arrangement to maintain the Contras with
clothing, food, medical suplies and other non-military aid will
``put the United States back in the ballgame in Central America.''
   ``Up to now, we have been out of the ballgame because we had the
legislature going in one direction and the executive going in
another direction and we couldn't function,'' Baker told the Senate
Appropriations foreign operations subcommittee.
   ``Today, for the first time, we have an opportunity to speak
with one voice to the people of Central America.''
   Baker said the plan will focus international attention on the
Sendinistas and make clear whether or not they will keep the
promises made when Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega and the other Central
American presidents signed the Esquipulas accord in August 1987.
   ``Between now and February 1990, when elections are scheduled in
Nicaragua, the whole world will know the answer to this question:
Do the Sandinistas keep their word?'' Baker said.
   He said that question will be answered by whether or not the
Sandinistas negotiate fair election rules, permit the return of the
Contras with safety under democratic conditions and stop supporting
Marxist guerrillas in El Salvador.
   ``Their record is abysmal; they have not kept any of their
promises,'' Baker said of the Sandinistas. ``But we do have an
opportunity now to focus world opinion on their willingness to keep
their promises.''
   Baker noted the Soviets have said they support the Esquipulas
agreement.
   ``Now we will have an opportunity to see if they really do,'' he
said. ``We will see if there is any meat on the bones of `New
Thinking' as far as their goals in Central America are concerned.''
   Baker said the Soviet Union uses Nicaragua as a ``dumping
ground'' for $515 million in military aid a year and noted that the
last U.S. arms aid to the Contras expired in the spring of 1988.
   There was some grumbling by Republicans that the terms of the
agreement permit the Democratic-controlled House and Senate to cut
off the flow of aid to the Contras after seven months if Congress
sees fit.
   Baker said the agreement represents the best opportunity to
forge a unified U.S. policy. He said nothing in it bars the Bush
administration from seeking renewed military aid for the Contras if
that seems justified by events.
   But Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said that for all practical
purposes, the bipartisan agreement cancels the policy of using the
Contras as surrogate fighters for the United State in Central
America.
   ``I think this is a historic moment,'' Leahy said. ``I think
both sides now realize that the Contra war is at an end.''

   So, let's learn from this.
   Let's do better in protecting the environment.
   Let _ if there's a lesson here that one agency or another might
have moved faster, I will be the first to learn from that.
   But we've got to keep a certain perspective.
   And I am very pleased that the federal government is as
involved, as it should be, now.
   I also would like to see more volunteers involved.
   And therein, I would make a pitch for strong support for
revision of our liability laws.
   Some, I am told, volunteers are _ and volunteer groups are kept

   Seigenthaler: There's time for only one more question. In order

   Q. Mr. President _ (inaudible) _ Southern California _ when the
North trial is over, will you tell the American people if you were
the so-called ``discreet emissary'' sent to Honduras during the
Iran-Contra affair and, if you were, give a full accounting of what
you did there?
   Bush: I think I've given a full accounting.
   I would refer you, sir, to what _ incidentally, in today's
paper, to what was said by Ambassador Negroponte and also Tony
Motley, who sat in on that meeting.
   And having said that, every attorney that advises the president
has advised me not to do something that inadvertently would cause a
mistrial or would disturb the process that is under way.
   And so I _ I don't like reading charges that I happen to feel
are untrue, but I have to stand on that, and that just goes with
the territory.
   And I am confident that the process that has gone on and the
process that undoubtedly will go on after this trial is over will _
will say that anything I have heretofore said is correct.
   But I do not want to be pushed into doing something for
self-aggrandizement that would be _ would be ruled by some judge to
_ to have aborted a trial that is under way.
   Well, thank you all very much. (Applause.)
   Seigenthaler: Mr. President _ Mr. President, I _ (applause) _
Mr. President, I'm sure _ (applause) _ Mr. President, I'm sure you
know that there is overwhelming support for those ethics proposals
you put forward today. I would only hope _ first of all, thank you
for your generous time. I hope you will treat this forum, the
American Society of Newspaper Editors, as an annual place where you
can come and provide us with additional proposals throughout your
administration. We are in your debt. The president and his party
will leave; will the members of the society please remain in their

   President Bush announced Wednesday he will
nominate Navy Rear Adm. Richard Truly, an astronaut who flew in two
space shuttle missions, to head the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   ``This marks the first time in its distinguished history that
NASA will be led by a hero of its own making, an astronaut who has
been to space,'' Bush told members of Congress and others at the
White House.
   Truly, 50, became a NASA astronaut in 1969 and has been the
agency's associate administrator for space flight since 1986. He
piloted the shuttle Columbia on NASA's second space shuttle flight
and was commander of the eighth flight in 1983.
   He led the recovery team after the Challenger disaster on Jan.
28, 1986, and a subsequent team in charge of redesigning the
shuttle's boosters and revamping safety procedures.
   ``Because Dick Truly is an active duty naval officer, I will
need the assent and cooperation of the Congress to make this
appointment,'' the president said.
   B. Jay Cooper, deputy White House press secretary, said Congress
had agreed to waive a requirement that the head of NASA be a
civilian.
   The position is subject to confirmation by the Senate.
   The president also announced that he plans to nominate James R.
Thompson Jr., director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala., to succeed Dale D. Myers as deputy administrator
of the agency.
   Bush said that immediately after the ceremony, Truly was leaving
for Cape Canaveral to take charge of the flight readiness team for
the next space shuttle flight, in which the shuttle Atlantis will
carry the Magellan radar mapping device.
   ``The launch of Magellan is the first in a series of
long-planned space science missions scheduled for 1989, and I
personally place a great deal of importance in our nation's civil
space program,'' the president said.
   Truly, asked after the ceremony what his top priority would be,
said, ``To have a good flight readiness and get Magellan on its way
to Venus.''
   The president thanked James Fletcher, who attended the
ceremonial announcement in the Roosevelt Room, for ``an outstanding
job'' as head of NASA. Fletcher retired from the post last month
after holding it for more than two years.
   Also at the ceremony were Vice President Dan Quayle; Rep. Norm
Mineta, D-Calif.; Rep. Bob Walker, R-Pa.; Rep. Sonny Montgomery,
D-Miss.; Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas; Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss.; and
Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., among others.
   Before his space flights, Truly was pilot for one of the two-man
crews that conducted landing tests with the space shuttle
Enterprise when it was hauled aloft on the back of a 747 jumbo jet.
   Truly holds a bachelor of aeronautical engineering degree from
the Georgia Institute of Technology and was commissioned an ensign
in the U.S. Navy in 1959. He became a naval aviator in 1960 and
made more than 300 carrier landings.

   President Bush paid tribute Wednesday night to
America's volunteer firefighters, saying they deserve a federal
government that ``understands and values'' their place in the
nation's communities.
   ``I was struck by the fact that 85 percent of our nation's fire
protection is supplied by volunteers,'' Bush said in a speech
prepared for delivery to a Fire Service Institute dinner.
   ``For more than 200 years, firefighters have been this nation's
neighbor _ in word and deed _ the backbone of America,'' the
president said. ``You have met local emergencies through volunteer
and paid fire and emergency service networks. And today, you meet
them still _ 3 million members strong.''
   Bush said he believes the federal government should support
volunteer firefighters and noted that he supports the National Fire
Academy ``retaining its prominence as a national training center.''
   ``Each year, more than 6,000 lives are lost in fires and over
$10 billion lost in property damage,'' he said. ``To combat such
tragedy, we must foster greater public awareness of fire problems
by supporting the federal fire safety programs.''
   Bush said that as part of that effort, the death benefit for
fallen fire fighters was raised from $50,000 to $100,000 in
legislation passed by Congress last year.

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for impeached Judge Alcee L.
Hastings pleaded Wednesday for up to $950,000 from the government
to finance his fight to stay on the bench but they encountered a
cool reception from senators.
   ``You're making an unprecedented request for compensation which,
just speaking for myself, I don't think you're going to have
available,'' Sen. Arlen Spector, R-Pa., told Hastings attorney
Terence J. Anderson.
   The House on Aug. 3 approved 413-3 articles of impeachment
accusing the 52-year-old District Court judge of conspiring to
obtain a bribe in 1981 and lying about it in 1983 before a jury
that eventually acquitted him.
   One impeachment article also accuses Hastings, the first black
federal judge in Florida history, of improperly disclosing secret
wiretap information and as a result torpedoing a federal
investigation.
   Hastings says he knew nothing of any plot. He claims it stemmed
from an idle boast by a friend and one-time classmate, Washington
attorney William Borders, that he could influence the judge's
actions.
   Borders, described in a House committee report as politically
influential in the late 1970s, was convicted of conspiracy and
imprisoned after accepting a garment bag stuffed with $125,000 in
cash from an FBI undercover agent.
   A 12-member Senate panel is preparing to hear evidence. Based on
its report, the full Senate will then vote on whether to remove
Hastings from the bench and halt payment of his $89,500 salary.
   Anderson said he is unsure if he will call on Borders, who has
``grounds to fear that he will be murdered'' if he testifies.
   Anderson said he based that statement on talks with Borders'
attorney and others. The cast of the case is spiced with shady
characters, including Florida mob boss Santo Trafficante and a
Miami antique dealer who kept the FBI informed Borders' plans in
return for lenient treatment on a narcotics charge.
   Anderson asked the Senate panel for $200,000 in expenses as well
as unspecified fees which he said at a fair rate of compensation
could add up to $750,000. He said that, even though Hastings is
well paid as a judge, he is indigent for purposes of the
impeachment trial because his salary is not enough to pay the high
costs.
   Anderson said that as a law professor at Miami University, he
could afford to take the summer off and work on the Hastings case.
But he said that without government funding, co-counsel Patricia
Williams would be ``committing economic suicide'' to devote full
time to the trial to the neglect of her law practice.
   After presenting his case to the lawmakers, however, Anderson
was not overly optimistic. ``I felt an awful lot like the train is
continuing to run down the track,'' he told reporters afterward.
   The attorney also asked for a 180-day delay in the start of
hearing evidence, saying he needs time to question potential
witnesses. The list includes former U.S. Chief Justice Warren
Burger and current Chief Justice William Rehnquist.
   In addition, Anderson asked the senators to force the House to
provide him with an array of documents ranging from working papers
produced by the prosecution to Justice Department and FBI
investigative files.
   The lawmakers went into closed session to deliberate following
the hearing and the chairman, Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., said it
might have decisions to announce later in the week.
   Prosecutors from the House of Representatives urged the senators
to turn down the request for more documents. Rep. John Bryant,
D-Texas, said the House already had provided the defense with
numerous documents and offered to work with Anderson to duplicate
others.
   He said, however, that it was unreasonable for Anderson to
request ``every single document that we ever reviewed.'' Even if
the House complied, he said, it would be of little benefit to the
defense.
   ``He knows very well that we have no documents that exonerate
the defendant,'' Bryant said. ``If we did, why on earth would we be
here? We have had no desire to spend the last three years working
on this matter.''
   Bryant urged the senators not to delay the start of hearing
evidence and instead begin around June 1. He said the House would
take no position on whether to provide government money to wage
Hastings' legal battle.
   Rep. George W. Gekas, R-Pa., however, did express concern about
defense plans to question Burger, Rehnquist and a wide array of
other witnesses if granted the delay it seeks.
   ``We find that all of this evidence, that none of it is relevant
to the facts that must be presented to this committee,'' Gekas said.

   Leftist guerrilla gunmen killed a leader
of the governing party's youth organization as he boarded a bus in
this highland city, police said Wednesday.
   Police blamed the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla movement for the
assassination Tuesday of Juan Torres, head of the Huancayo branch
of the Peruvian Aprista Youth.
   Two gunmen stepped from hiding and shot Torres, 21, in the head
at a bus stop one-half block from his home in Huancayo, 140 miles
east of Lima, police said.
   The Shining Path has slain dozens of officials from the
center-left Aprista Party in its nine-year insurgency to topple the
elected government and impose Marxist rule.
   Huancayo, one of the nation's most important provincial
commercial centers, has become a major focus of rebel violence over
the past three years.

<TEXT>
   A cold front brought relief Wednesday from dense
smoke that had choked south Florida when wildfires spread through
about 32,000 acres of dry sawgrass.
   Smoke from the brushfires, which had enveloped metropolitan
Miami, cleared considerably and forecasters said the haze wasn't
expected to return.
   Meanwhile, increased humidity and lighter winds helped
firefighters control the blazes, according to Seb Farina, spokesman
for the state Division of Forestry.
   Two major fires in Dade County were contained overnight, with
only hot spots and some flare-ups being battled, officials said.
   In all, 27,000 acres have burned in Dade and another 5,000 acres
in Palm Beach County.
   There had been particular concern about one fire that appeared
headed toward the Everglades National Park. But spokeswoman Pat
Tolle said the closest the 18,000-acre fire got was about 4.5 miles
from the park boundary.
   On Tuesday, smoke from the fires made it difficult for some
workers in downtown Miami to see Biscayne Bay a few blocks away. It
also forced the evacuation of nearly 750 immigrants from a
detention facility that was overwhelmed by the choking haze.
   The detained aliens were bused back to the Krome Avenue
Detention Center on Wednesday, according to Perry Rivkind, district
director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   ``We expected it to clear mostly overnight and it practically
has,'' said Wayne Colin, a forecaster for the National Weather
Service. ``We had a cold front come through and wind directions
changed.''
   Some of the lingering smoke blew further south, producing hazy
conditions and acrid air down to Key West. But Dr. Jose Bofill of
the Monroe County Health Unit described it as a ``very, very mild
situation. We have some smoke and you can smell it.''

<DATELINE>MATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans considering a trek across the
United States-Mexico border should not be dissuaded by the gruesome
discovery of 12 people slaughtered in satanic rituals, officials
said Wednesday.
   ``We do not believe there is any danger to people traveling to
Matamoros,'' said Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox.
   Members of a voodoo cult of drug smugglers, arrested in at least
12 ritual slayings, including a U.S. college student, said
Wednesday they sacrificed their victims for demonic protection from
police.
   The U.S. State Department was monitoring the situation,
officials said.
   ``We do not issue travel advisories in connection with isolated
criminal acts,'' said Frances Jones, spokeswoman for consular
affairs at the State Department in Washington.
   Last year, more than 118 million people crossed the United
States-Mexico border, according to Charles Conroy, public affairs
officer for the U.S. Customs Service.
   Of those, about 4.5 million were American pedestrians crossing
from Brownsville, Texas, into Matamoros, where authorities
discovered the mutilated body on Tuesday.
   Thousands of Americans come over for food, shopping or drinking
excursions. Restaurants, bars and curio shops dot Obregon Street
along the first mile into the city.
   Authorities Wednesday were quick to say the mass killing should
not alarm potential tourists.
   Arturo Moreno, supervisor at the Brownsville station of the U.S.
Border Patrol, said it could not be determined whether the killings
indicate tourists are in danger.
   ``We always tell people to travel with caution and stay in the
tourists area,'' Moreno said.
   Residents of Matamoros said they hope they can ward off a stigma
that could be attached to their city because of the slayings.
   ``We are very concerned and we will tell the tourists that 99.9
percent of the people here are good and that it only takes one or
two to give the others the bad name,'' said Ignacio Garcia, a shift
supervisor at Pancho Villa's restaurant, on Wednesday.
   It was the second drug-related mass killing discovered near the
international border in less than two weeks, officials said.
   Mexican authorities found the bodies of three women and six men
March 29 on an abandoned ranch near Agua Prieta, Sonora, just
across the border from Douglas, Ariz. All nine had been tortured,
mutilated and bound, officials said.
   On April 1, the bodies of three more men killed in similar
fashion were found there.
   Investigators said possible motives for the Agua Prieta slayings
range from revenge for lost narcotics or drug money to discouraging
informants to fighting between drug-smuggling factions.

<HEAD>Official Concedes UNITA Abuses But Says U.S. Aid Will Continue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A State Department official said Wednesday
that Angolan rebels had committed human rights abuses but told
Congress the United States would continue to back them.
   ``No doubt hey (abuses) are taking place. They are on both
sides,'' E. Gibson Lanpher, the department's director of Southern
African affairs, responded under sharp questioning by Democrats
Howard Wolpe and Stephen Solarz.
   But he added that ``continued U.S. support for UNITA and
national reconciliation inside Angola are essential'' to ensure an
end to the country's 14-year civil war.
   The rebel Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) has
proposed talks with the Angolan government on a peace accord and
power-sharing, he said, and the government also ``is coming to
realize'' such a need.
   Lanpher's comments came at a hearing convened by the House
Ssubcommittee on Africa to debate U.S. policy in Angola in the wake
of the Cuban troop pullout that began earlier this year.
   In a related development, the House adopted an amendment that
would withhold the U.S. contribution to U.N. peacekeeping activity
in Angola unless all Cuban troops are withdrawn from that country
according to the stipulations of a U.S.-mediated agreement signed
last December.
   Rep. Gerald Solomon, a New York Republican who introduced the
measure, said it would require the president to report to Congress
periodically on the progress of the withdrawal of an estimated
40,000 Cuban troops.
   Solomon's amendment reflects the distrust felt by many
Republicans in Congress about the intentions of Cuba and its ally,
the Angolan government.
   Representative Dan Burton, ranking minority member of the Africa
subcommittee, accused the Angolan government of using chemical
weapons against rebels. He said allegations against UNITA of gross
human rights abuses are part of an Angolan campaign to discredit
the organization and stop the U.S. covert support begun in 1985.
   U.S. aid is estimated at $15 million to $40 million.
   Human Rights Watch, an American monitoring group, recommended to
Congress that U.S. aid to UNITA be stopped in light of evidence
``showing a practice of gross abuses of human rights.''
   A just-released report by the organization blames both UNITA and
the Angolan government for systematic and indiscriminate attacks on
civilians and charges UNITA with forcible conscription of
civilians, taking hundreds of foreigners hostage and using food as
a starvation weapon.
   Lanpher said the United States does not have any evidence to
substantiate accusations leveled in recent months by former UNITA
members that their families have been burned to death because they
practiced witchcraft.
   Solarz, a member of the House Intelligence Committee which
monitors the covert aid to Angola, urged Lanpher to investigate the
allegations. ``I can't imagine the American people want to
subsidize a movement that burns witches at the stake,'' he said.
``We got over that several hundred years ago at Salem.''

   A supersonic Concorde jet carrying 100
Americans dropped a chunk of its tail over the South Pacific
Wednesday during an attempt to set a speed record, but it landed
safely and passengers were reported eager to try again.
   The 9-foot tail section of the British Airways plane ripped off
about 25 minutes after the plane left Christchurch, New Zealand,
for Sydney 1,000 miles away. Passengers said the plane shuddered,
but the craft landed in Sydney about an hour later. No one was
injured.
   The plane is attempting to set speed records for each of 12
parts of a three-week journey around the world. The passengers, who
included commentator William F. Buckley Jr., each paid $39,000 for
the trip, which began in London on April 1.
   Peter Stanton, an airline spokesman, said part of the rudder
disintegrated while the jet was flying at 40,000 feet at about
1,500 mph _ nearly twice the speed of sound.
   ``It experienced a shudder while over the Tasman Sea that was
thought to have been air turbulence,'' said Stanton. ``But it was a
normal landing; there was no emergency.''
   He said the control tower told the pilot, Capt. David Leney,
that a piece of the tail was missing.
   ``It wasn't until we got out of the plane and saw the firetrucks
and all the press ... that we knew something was wrong,'' Buckley
later told ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``About 25 minutes after takeoff from New Zealand there was a
large thump,'' free-lance journalist Sheila Cole-Nilva told The
Associated Press. ``Everybody looked at everybody else and lunch
was served. The stewardesses looked terrified.
   ``The pilot came on and said there was nothing to worry about
and that there was a piece loose on the airplane.''
   Investigators began analyzing the Concorde's flight data
recorder to find out why the tail section broke off. British
Airways airport service manager Pat Boody said the crew noticed
``unusual vibrations'' during the flight.
   Buckley, who helped organize the trip, planned to broadcast his
television show ``Firing Line'' during stops in Cape Town, South
Africa, and Sydney. Other stops on the itinerary include Acapulco,
Mexico; Colombo, Sri Lanka; and Mombassa, Kenya. The trip was
scheduled to end April 23 in London.
   The Lorraine Travel Bureau in Miami, which arranged the trip,
refused to release the passengers' names. ``There were no
celebrities that are household names,'' said company president Jack
R. Guiteras.
   He said all 100 passengers were ``very excited and happy with
the trip,'' and that none had asked to leave the tour.
   Ms. Cole-Nilva said they ``can't wait to get back on board.''
   A British Airways spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified,
said the trip would cover 38,343 miles. ``It's the first ever
supersonic circumnavigation of the earth,'' she said.
   A prototype of the Anglo-French Concorde first flew 20 years
ago. It has been in commercial service since 1976, but mainly on
trans-Atlantic routes.
   An airline spokesman in London said a spare part was being sent,
but it was not known if the plane could be repaired in time to make
its scheduled flight Friday to Perth in western Australia. The
airline gave no details on how much of the tail needed to be
replaced.
   British Airways gave its Concordes a clean bill of health two
months ago after inquiries that were prompted by the discovery of
tiny cracks in the roof of one plane. Similar checks were made on
Air France Concordes.
   Concordes have been involved in a number of minor incidents, but
there have been no fatal accidents.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Wednesday
revoked a regulation promulgated by his predecessor that required
the Justice Department to appoint independent counsels to
investigate members of Congress.
   Thornburgh, who had previously expressed doubt about the order
issued last summer as a parting shot by outgoing Attorney General
Edwin Meese III, rescinded the regulation after President Bush
proposed legislation to place lawmakers under the jurisdiction of
the special prosecutor law.
   Thornburgh's action returns to the Justice Department _ at least
while Congress studies the legislation _ its traditional role in
investigating allegations of criminal wrongdoing by members of
Congress.
   ``The Congress has been asked to review the role of the
independent counsel,'' Thornburgh said in a statement.
   ``Until that review is completed, the previously established
system for handling allegations of wrongdoing by members of
Congress, which has worked well for many years, will be followed.''
   The order was issued hours after Bush proposed in his ethics
package to extend to members of Congress the law providing for
court appointment of independent counsels to investigate high
government officials.
   The law currently applies only to high-ranking executive branch
officials, based on the presumption the Justice Department would
have a conflict-of-interest when called upon to investigate
allegations against administration officials.
   Critics of the law, which included former White House officials
prosecuted under it, contend it should also apply to members of
Congress.
   Meese, himself the target of two independent counsel
investigations that yielded no charges, promulgated the regulation
requiring that the attorney general appoint special prosecutors to
investigate wrongdoing by member of Congress.
   Thornburgh's order means the public integrity section will have
complete jurisdiction to investigate payroll padding allegations
against Walter Fauntroy, the non-voting delegate from the District
of Columbia.
   The Justice Department noted that since the public integrity
section of the criminal division was established in 1976, 20
members of Congress have been convicted of federal crimes.
   The department is investigating allegations that Fauntroy
employed the son of Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., on his House payroll
while the younger Savage was actually living in Chicago.
   It would also mean that, pending any action by Congress on
Bush's proposal, the department would have jurisdiction to
investigate any allegations of wrongdoing against House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas.
   Justice Department spokesman Loye Miller said the public
integrity section is awaiting the results of the House ethics
committee. It will review the panel's report to determine if a
further investigation is warranted.

   Senators began amending President Bush's

fell into disagreement over how soon S&amp;L owners should be made to
put up more of their own money to stay in business.
   The Senate Banking Committee was expected to divide along party
lines with the 12 Democrats outvoting their nine Republican
colleagues to reject Bush's proposal to not include in the federal
budget the immediate $50 billion taxpayer cost of the bailout.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, in a letter Wednesday to the
panel's chairman, Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., did not repeat his
earlier threat to recommend that Bush veto the package if the $50
billion bailout cost is included in the fiscal 1989 budget.
   But, in commmending as ``on balance, meritorious,'' proposed
Senate changes in the new, tougher regulations and capital
requirements that Bush would impose on the industry, Brady said the
administration still opposes Riegle's plan to reflect the cost of
the bailout now rather than over 30 years.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., the chief advocate in the House of
such a plan, said he is holding off on proposing it after receiving
a letter Wednesday from White House budget director Richard Darman,
who said he would refuse to count all of the spending in 1989.
   If Darman carried out the threat, it would wreak havoc on
efforts to meet the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit targets in 1990 and
1991. Schumer said Darman has the sole power to make that decision
but said he was still looking for a way to circumvent him.
   Riege said his plan would avoid the ``accounting and budget
gimmickry'' of Bush's proposal by reducing the interest costs of
financing the bailout through direct Treasury borrowing at a
savings of $4.5 billion to taxpayers over the next three decades.
   Utah Sen. Jake Garn, the committee's ranking Republican, said he
still has a ``fundamental disagreement'' over allowing the bailout
costs to swell the federal deficit in apparent violation of a
congressionally mandated reduction target that already has been
exceeded.
   All three versions _ Bush's, the Senate panel's and one being
put together in the House Banking Committee's financial
institutions subcommitee _ would use the $50 billion over the next
three years to pay for the bailouts of some 200 insolvent S&amp;Ls in
1988 plus 350 more that are insolvent or nearly so.
   They also provide for an additional $33 billion _ $300 million a
year of it coming from the industry _ to take care of thrift
insolvencies expected in the 1990s, especially if interest rates
continue to rise or the nation falls into a recession.
   ``The president asked us to move quickly and that's what we've
done,'' Riegle said. ``We've given him a strong bill with many
streamlined reforms and changes that can prevent in the future a
repeat of what's happened in the past.''
   Unlike changes made by the House subcommittee, the Senate
panel's version retains Bush's proposal to double by June 1991 the
required capital that S&amp;L operators must have to qualify for
federal deposit insurance.
   Bush would not shut down institutions that fail to meet that
standard then but he would prevent them from growing. Both Senate
and House versions would allow undercapitalized thrifts to continue
growing, but would restrict that growth primarily to home mortgages
and consumer loans.
   The House panel, which finished its third full day of drafting
the bill, rejected Bush's measure to make S&amp;Ls have the same
minimum capital requirements as banks _ $6 for every $100 of
outstanding loans _ voting 24-23 Tuesday to keep the current floor
_ $3 for every $100 in loans _ but requiring for the first time
that half that amount be in real money.
   Both panels, however, have voted to phase out many of what
critics call ``smoke and mirrors accounting fictions.''
   Those accounting practices have allowed S&amp;Ls to escape putting
up their own cash or retained earnings by counting as capital such
items as investments in non-thrift subsidiaries, ``good will,''
their own borrowings and even losses on bad loans.
   Bush would immediatly end many such bookkeeping practices.
   By a 27-16 vote Wednesday, the House subcommittee voted to
continue allowing S&amp;Ls to funnel depositors' fund into subsidiaries
to invest in risky areas such as commercial real estate
development, fast food franchises and junk bonds.
   The Senate panel's version would phase out such practices over
five years but there were disagreements among senators over whether
to do it in equal yearly installments or all at once.
   The House panel also approved Wednesday a measure by its
chairman, Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-N.J., requiring S&amp;Ls to
concentrate 80 percent of their lending on residential mortgages,
compared with the 60 percent now required.
   But the measure also broadly defines housing to include
consumer, education and small business loans and no S&amp;L would be
penalized if the mix of its current loan portfolio does not meet
the requirement.
   The subcommittee also approved, 34-12, a measure sponsored by
Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the full committee,
which would require the government to offer some of the repossessed
property from failed S&amp;Ls for housing poor people. It authorizes
spending $574 million to subsidize rents on the properties or offer
discounts or low-interest loans to purchasers.
   It adopted another measure, by voice vote, imposing government
oversight on the agency in charge of selling repossessed real
estate and establishing procedures designed to guard against the
dumping of the property at firesale prices.

   Here are major provisions of President Bush's
proposals Wednesday to tighten ethics rules for judges, members of
Congress and the executive branch:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PAY RAISES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bush proposed a 25 percent pay increase for federal judges,
coupled with a ban on acceptance of speaking fees and other
honoraria. Associate justices of the Supreme Court, for example,
would see their salaries rise from $110,000 to $137,000 while U.S.
district court judges' pay would go to $111,900 from $89,500.
   Bush said he supported pay hikes and a honoraria ban for
Congress but did not make a specific proposal.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CAMPAIGN FINANCING</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bush proposed a ban on the use of leftover campaign
contributions for personal use and office expenses. The law now
allows anyone who held office before 1980 to use such funds for any
lawful purpose.
   Bush also called for a ban on campaign contributions by
political action committees, although he did not make a formal
proposal on it. He also said he opposes efforts to set up a federal
fund for congressional races like the taxpayer-supported one that
is used for the presidential campaign.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   To tighten financial disclosure rules, Bush proposed a uniform
system for the three branches of government, requiring individuals
to disclose the actual value of each asset and source of income,
rounded to the nearest thousand dollars. Currently, individuals are
required to report only within broad categories, such as $5,000 to
$15,000.
   More members of the executive branch also would have to file
disclosure reports.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bush proposed to expand a law that forbids individuals in the
executive branch from taking official actions that financially
benefit them or members of their family. He said it also should
apply to the judiciary and employes of Congress, though not to
Congress members themselves.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Senior officials in all three branches of government would be
barred from serving on the board of directors of for-profit
enterprises.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>POST EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITIES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bush proposed that members of Congress who retire or are
defeated be barred for a year from contacting former colleagues to
lobby them. This ban also would be extended to senior officials in
the judicial branch.
   His proposed bill also would abolish ``compartmentalization'' of
the various agencies of the executive branch for purposes of
lobbying. That means that executive branch workers, currently
barred for a year from lobbying their former office once they leave
the government, would be under the same restriction regarding all
the departments of the executive branch.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ENFORCEMENT</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The independent counsel statute that has been invoked to
authorize investigations of members of the executive branch would
be extended to cover the Congress.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>EXECUTIVE ORDER</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Under an executive order issued by Bush, fulltime, non-career
presidential appointees in the executive branch would be prohibited
from receiving any earned income from outside employment.
   The executive order also would give elevated rank to a
designated ethics officer in each department.

<HEAD>Record Cold in South; Rain in Great Lakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A cold snap set low temperature records in more than 20 cities
across the South on Wednesday, and light rain and snow fell on the
Great Lakes region and the northern Ohio Valley.
   Moist air steamed northward from the Gulf of Mexico and bbrought
cloudy skies and scattered light showers to Texas. There also were
scattered showers in eastern Kentucky and eastern Tennessee, and a
few showers over the Florida peninsula. It was sunny across most of
the rest of the nation.
   Low pressure over Lake Huron caused the light snow and rain in
the upper Midwest. Grand Rapids, Mich., received an inch of snow
during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 30
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 88 degrees at the China Lake Naval
Air Station and Palm Springs, both in California.
   The low for the nation Wednesday morning was 7 degrees at
Warroad, Minn.
   Low temperature records that were set or tied included 32
degrees in Augusta, Ga., 37 in Baton Rouge, La., 29 in Chattanooga,
Tenn., 15 in Elkins, W.V., 41 in Jacksonville, Fla., 26 in
Knoxville, Tenn., 33 in Macon, Ga., 34 in Montgomery, Ala., 43 in
New Orleans, 24 in Roanoke, Va., 35 in Savannah, Ga., and 32 in
Wilmington, N.C.
   The National Weather Service forecast for Thursday called for
showers and a few thunderstorms across the southern Plains and the
lower Mississippi Valley, with rain and snow showers over the
northern Atlantic Coast states and northern New England. A few
showers and thunderstorms were forecast for the Florida peninsula.
   A few rainshowers also were forecast for northern Minnesota and
northwestern Wisconsin. Sunny skies were expected across the rest
of the nation.
   Afternoon highs were expected to be in the 60s and 70s over much
of the nation, with highs below 60 from eastern North Dakota
through the Great Lakes region and the northern Ohio Valley to the
middle and northern Atlantic Coast, and in the 50s from Colorado to
the Texas panhandle. Highs in the 80s were forecast for the Florida
peninsula, and from southern Arizona through much of California to
southwest Oregon. Highs in the 90s were expected in the
southwestern deserts and some of the California valleys.

<HEAD>Suspected Basque Separatists Kill Civil Guard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILBAO, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three suspected Basque separatists shot and
killed a paramilitary civil guard Wednesday and fled in a stolen
car.
   Bomb experts in Madrid, meanwhile, defused a letter bomb sent to
Justice Minister Enrique Mugica, ministry sources said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attacks. But police said
they bore the earmarks of the Basque separatist organization ETA,
which has renewed attacks on government targets after a breakdown
in peace talks with the government of Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez.
   The Vizcaya province civil governor's office said two men and a
woman gunned down Jose Calvo de la Hoz, 51, on a street in the
northern city of Guecho, eight miles from Bilbao. He died an hour
later of head wounds.
   The getaway car was not immediately located, but police found
its owner in Lejona, where the assailants handcuffed him and left
him tied to a tree.
   ETA, an acronym for homeland and liberty in the Basque language,
has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people, mostly
military and police officers, in its 21-year campaign for
self-determination for Spain's three-province northern Basque
region.
   The group halted its attacks in January in return for peace
talks with the government. ETA ended the moratorium on April 4,
however, and renewed the bomb attacks. On Monday, the government
called off the talks.
   ``We will use all means at our disposal to battle this
phenomenon,'' Gonzalez, referring to ETA, told Spanish National
Radio.
   ETA sent a statement early Wednesday to the Basque daily Egin in
which it claimed responsibility for five package-bombs sent since
Friday to Spanish officials and military targets.
   It also took responsibility for eight bombs set off Saturday on
a rail line linking the Basque region's capital, Vitoria, with
neighboring Navarre. The bombs caused heavy damage but no injuries.
   ETA said it planned to set off bombs on the Madrid-Seville and
Madrid-Valencia rail lines between midnight Thursday and midnight
Saturday.
   An ETA package-bomb exploded Monday at a military training
school in the Pyrenees mountains of northern Spain, seriously
injuring a sergeant. Another blew up Friday in an apartment in the
Basque town of Irun, injuring a high school gym teacher who lost
part of one arm and the fingers of a hand.
   Authorities defused three package bombs sent to government and
military officials on Monday and Tuesday.

<HEAD>Corruption Report on Car Racket Names Five Zimbabwe Ministers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN EDLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judicial commission investigating
top-level corruption linked five Cabinet ministers to a
black-market car racket, according to a report published Thursday.
One minister quit hours earlier.
   The report said that of six ministers quizzed in a two-month
inquiry headed by Judge Wilson Sandura, only Foreign Minister
Nathan Shamuyarira was cleared of wrongdoing.
   Senior Cabinet Minister Maurice Nyagumbo, a staunch ally of
President Robert Mugabe, resigned his post on Wednesday, hours
before the report was made public.
   Two of Mugabe's top aides, Defense Minister Enos Nkala and
Political Affairs Minister Frederick Shava, quit the government and
the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic Front) party
after lying to the commission.
   But Sandura's three-member commission said Higher Education
Minister Dzingai Mutumbuka should be prosecuted, Industry and
Technology Minister Callistus Ndlovu evidently lied in his
testimony and doubts exist about Nyagumbo's evidence.
   The commission also recommended that Matabeleland North Gov.
Jacob Muzenda be prosecuted. But it exonerated army commander Gen.
Tapfumaneyi Mujuru.
   The commission sent its report to Mugabe two weeks ago after
interrogating 60 witnesses. It is Zimbabwe's biggest political
scandal in nine years of independence.
   Mugabe ordered the probe after a provincial newspaper exposed
the racket in December. He promised the full report would be made
public.
   While identifying abuses of power, position and privileges in
the leadership, the inquiry also won Mugabe praise for ordering
some of his closest aides to face the embarrassment of being
quizzed under the public spotlight.
   Nyagumbo, 64, is a staunch ally of Mugabe, a veteran nationalist
and a founder of the government party, the nation's only legal
party, in which he holds the third-highest position.
   Zimbabwe TV gave no explanation in announcing Nyagumbo's
resignation. But aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, linked
it to the corruption scandal and said Mugabe is expected to make an
announcement this week about changes in government.
   The probe that shook Africa's youngest nation was into purchases
of cars and trucks from Willowvale car assembly plant by ministers
and their friends at low, fixed prices.
   High-ranking officials allegedly used their influence to jump
waiting lines for vehicles and then resell them illegally on the
black market for up to five times what they paid.
   Zimbabwe has suffered a severe shortage of cars because it lacks
hard currency. Would-be buyers may wait up to 10 years for a new
vehicle.
   Nyagumbo admitted helping 38 friends buy cars, but insisted he
took no money in return.
   The report said ``it was difficult to believe he received no
benefits at all.''
   The commission disputed the testimony of four other ministers
who testified they bought cars but sold them at the statutory price.
   Charges being considered range from price control violations and
sales tax evasion, which usually involve nominal fines, to perjury,
which carries a maximum prison sentence of five years.
   The commission praised Geoff Nyarota, the crusading editor who
spotlighted what became known as Willowgate.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed Wednesday
for calm in Soviet Georgia but rejected the demands of local
nationalists and blamed them for igniting lethal strife he said had
damaged his drive for reform.
   ``The interests of the working people have nothing in common
with attempts to sever the existing ties of friendship and
cooperation among our peoples, (to) dismantle the socialist system
in the republic and push it into the slough of ethnic enmity,''
Gorbachev said.
   They were the Soviet leader's first direct public remarks on the
unrest since at least 19 people were killed Sunday in a clash
between pro-independence activists and security forces.
   The official Tass news agency carried excerpts of Gorbachev's
remarks. It said his appeal was published in Tbilisi, the Georgian
capital and the site of Sunday's clash.
   The summary of Gorbachev's remarks blamed ``actions by
irresponsible persons'' for the loss of life, apparently
exonerating soldiers and police from any official blame.
   In the city of 1.2 million, 900 miles south of Moscow, strikes
continued and funeral services were planned for those killed. The
Georgian Communist Party chief tendered his resignation, a Soviet
spokesman said.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, an ethnic Georgian, met
with almost 200 Georgian nationalists, human rights activists and
strike organizers in Tbilisi trying to establish concord, but the
Wednesday meeting ended after nearly three hours when many
participants walked out, Moscow activist Alexander Podrabinek
reported.
   Podrabinek said two speakers demanded a special session of
Georgia's parliament to consider secession from the Soviet Union.
He identified them as Karlo Bardavelidze from the opposition
National Democratic Party and Irakli Shengelaya from the Union of
National Justice, a group of Georgian writers and other
intellectuals.
   ``Shevardnadze only repeated commonplaces about perestroika,''
Gorbachev's program for national restructuring, Podrabinek said.
   He said student strike organizers and National Democratic Party
organizers were among many to quit the meeting at the Filmworkers
Union building, viewing it as ``fruitless.'' .
   Zurav Zhankarashvili, a Tbilisi resident and member of the
Georgian human rights watchdog organization Helsinki Watch, called
Gorbachev's appeal ``very dry,'' and expressed doubts it would be
enough to ease tensions.
   Gorbachev also made a personal appeal for calm in February 1988
after ethnic strife occurred in Armenia and Azerbaijan. His call
only momentarily stemmed bloodshed in those republics, where more
than 90 people were killed last year.
   Demonstrations in Georgia began April 4.
   The trouble started when protesters criticized calls from
members of the republic's ethnic Abkhazian minority to break away
because of alleged discrimination by Georgians.
   Other protesters demanded Georgia secede from the Soviet Union
because of alleged interference from the central government and
Russians in the republic's political, economic and cultural affairs.
   Gorbachev appeared to reject both breakaway demands, saying
``reshaping ethnic relations is not recarving borders and not
breaking the country's national-state structure.''
   Led by Gorbachev, the Supreme Soviet Presidium, the nation's top
executive body, also refused Armenian demands last year to annex a
mostly Armenian region of Azerbaijan. It was that issue that led to
bloodshed between those republics.
   Gorbachev said the disturbances in Tbilisi had ``damaged the
interests of perestroika, democratization and renewal in the
country.''
   Foreign reporters have been barred from traveling to Georgia,
but residents of Tbilisi reached by telephone said the protesters
were killed when soldiers charged an unarmed pro-independence crowd
that massed near the Government House before dawn Sunday.
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennady I. Gerasimov, told
reporters in Moscow on Wednesday that a girl injured in the melee
had died, which he said brought the total number of civilian deaths
to 19.
   However, the evening government newspaper Izvestia put the death
toll at 20. Earlier reports said 75 soldiers and police were hurt,
but Pravda said Wednesday 91 police and soldiers were injured. No
reason for the change was given.
   Gerasimov said the first funerals will be held Thursday. Tuesday
was declared an official day of mourning for Georgia's dead.
   Gerasimov also said Georgian party chief Dzhumber Patiashvili
``asked to be relieved of his duties'' at a meeting of Georgian
party leaders Tuesday night but will keep his post until the party
decides his fate.
   Gerasimov said Patiashvili offered to resign after widespread
criticism from other Georgian leaders. He did not specify what
prompted those complaints. Signs posted at Tbilisi State University
on Sunday blamed Patiashvili for the protesters' deaths and called
him a ``killer,'' residents reported.

   Here are excerpts from the tapes of radio
communications between air traffic controllers and the pilots of
United Airlines Flight 811, which was forced to return to Honolulu
after a gaping hole ripped open on Feb. 24.
   The transcript was prepared by the Federal Aviation
Administration. Numbers are a time sequence using Greenwich Mean
Time.
   1152:46 (Local controller) United eight eleven heavy, runway
eight right, cleared for takeoff.
   1152:49 (UAL 811) United eight eleven heavy is cleared for
takeoff (runway) eight right.
   (Flight 811 routinely climbed to 22,000 feet to about 80 miles
from Honolulu and awaited clearance to climb to cruising altitude
of 30,000 feet. The next transmission with the FAA's en-route air
traffic control center came 16 minutes after takeoff.)
   1208:39 (UAL 811) Center, United eight eleven heavy, ah, we're

right wing, sir?
   1219:41 (UAL 811). Ah, that's affirmative there. We're missing a
section of the right side of the airplane. Part of the fuselage is
missing. And we've got ah, we've lost engine number three. We've
got engine number four shut down 'cause it ... appeared like we had

the, ah, all the equipment we can get standing by (at the airport).
   1219:41 (Controller, to Honolulu rescue center) OK. He's ah
forty five miles south (of the airport) and he's going down right
now. He's on two engines and a big section of his right side been
blown off. Can you ah just in case ah launch a helicopter or
whatever ... in case he goes in the water. ...

   1220:58 (Radar controller) United eight eleven heavy.
Affirmative. Still have you on radar. ...
   (The pilot advises the controller he plans to have an emergency
evacuation on the runway once he lands, and the controller says he
can have a choice of any runway he wants. The controllers then
begin to organize rescue efforts, and Flight 811 is turned over
from the FAA en-route center to the approach control at the
Honolulu airport tower.)

   Four guerrillas reported on Wednesday
to a checkpoint established under a U.N. plan to stop fierce
fighting with South African-led forces. Police said other
insurgents moved deeper into the territory.
   Nine U.N. assembly points were set up Tuesday in an effort to
move guerrillas who had infiltrated into Namibia back to
neighboring Angola. They had used bases in Angola while trying to
oust South Africa from the territory. The latest fighting broke out
April 1, the first day of a year-long process to make Namibia
independent.
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, the guerrillas on Wednesday
attacked South Africa with words, accusing it and the United States
of hiding advance knowledge of the infiltration in a bid to justify
an attack on the insurgents.
   ``This was a premeditated and orchestrated ambush, for South
Africa to find the pretext to jump out of the commitment'' to
cooperate with the U.N. independence plan, said Theo-Ben Gurirab,
foreign secretary of the South West Africa People's Organization,
known as SWAPO.
   Gurirab said South Africa had advance knowledge of the
infiltration through U.S. aerial reconnaissance photographs. He
said the South Africans contrived the situation to persuade British
Prime MInister Margaret Thatcher, who was visiting Namibia on April
1, that SWAPO had broken the cease-fire agreement.
   U.S. and South African officials had no immediate response.
   Gurirab said SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma had ordered the guerrillas
into Namibia to surrender to U.N. officials and move into camps.
However, no U.N. military observers were in northern Namibia at the
time.
   South Africa says about 1,900 guerrillas infiltrated into
northern Namibia starting April 1. U.N. investigators agree the
guerrillas violated a peace accord requiring they stay in Angolan
bases at least until May 15, when they could enter the country as
unarmed refugees.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since World War I. Last December,
it agreed to begin a transition to independence in exchange for
Cuba withdrawing its estimated 50,000 troops from Angola.
   No major skirmishes have been reported in Namibia, also known as
South-West Africa, since the weekend. Police say 263 guerrillas and
27 security force members were killed during the recent fighting.
   The four guerrillas arrived Wednesday at a U.N. checkpoint at a
Lutheran church in the northern town of Oniipa, according to an
Associated Press photographer at the scene. Two had arm wounds.
   U.N. personnel were called in and took the men to a U.N. camp 38
miles away at Oshikango border. U.N. soldiers helped the wounded
guerrillas from the truck at Oshikango and placed them in a tent
while plans were made to send them across the border to their bases
in Angola.
   Nujoma last weekend called on his guerrillas to withdraw from
Namibia, and the United Nations and the security forces agreed to
arrange assembly points and provide safe passage to Angola.
   Officials in the security forces said they saw tracks of some
SWAPO guerrillas heading into Angola, but there were no reports of
guerrillas arriving at the U.N. checkpoints until the four on
Wednesday.
   Security force members and SWAPO supporters have predicted that
few guerrillas will report to the U.N. checkpoints because of the
deployment of security forces there, the proximity of military
bases, and poor communication between guerrilla commanders and
their forces.
   Police said some guerrillas might try to cross back into Angola
without reporting to the checkpoints and others might hide their
weapons, don civilian clothes and try to stay in Namibia.
   A police spokesman, Chief Inspector Derrick Brune, said some
groups of insurgents were seen Wednesday moving south away from the
Angola border.
   So far, only 1,721 of 4,650 U.N. peacekeepers have reached the
territory.

   Three Pakistani U.N. monitors transported
four SWAPO guerrillas in a U.N. vehicle to the Angolan border
Wednesday, passing through three roadblocks manned by saluting
South African soldiers unaware of who the passengers were.
   The four were picked up by a Lutheran missionary from Finland,
Olle Ericsson; given medical treatment by an Australian medic, and
then carried 38 miles north to Oshikango, where Australian
engineers raised a U.N. flag Tuesday to mark one of the border
points where the guerrillas could have safe passage into Angola.
   A U.N. peace plan designed to lead to elections in November and
to independence for this South African-ruled territory was
endangered April 1, when South Africa said hundreds of South-West
African People's Organization guerrillas had crossed the border
from Angola into northern Namibia. In a week of fighting, 263 SWAPO
men and 27 policemen and South African soldiers died.
   SWAPO President Sam Nujoma asked his men to return to Angola,
and the United Nations put up blue and white flags at nine assembly
points in the territory to attract the guerrillas. Churches were
made safe havens under an agreement among South Africa, Cuba and
Angola.
   However, no cease-fire was in effect, and South African soldiers
continued to search vehicles on the road while policemen kept watch
on churches.
   Because the U.N.-manned assembly points were set up near South
African military camps, doubts arose as to whether SWAPO guerrillas
would venture near them. But about 200 churches and mission
stations exist in northern Namibia, and they were considered the
most likely places for the guerrillas to go.
   ``This morning you were all skeptical and said it wouldn't work.
Now I've proved you wrong and this is just the beginning,'' a
jubilant Pakistani U.N. military observer said to journalists.
   The reporters gathered at the end of the journey at Oshikango to
see the four guerrillas placed in tents and given medical aid by
Australian soldiers.
   The Pakistani officers _ identified only as Lt. Col. Farooq,
Capt. Nadir Zeb and Capt. Afafizab _ indicated the guerrillas would
not be questioned by the South Africans, as was suggested Wednesday
by a spokesman for Namibia's administrator-general, Louis Pienaar.
The South Africans want to find out from the guerrillas how many
are leaving.
   One SWAPO guerrilla, wounded by shrapnel under his left arm,
arrived at the mission station in the morning and told Ericsson he
had three comrades who wanted to come in. Ericcson notified U.N.
monitors at the Ondangwa airbase, three miles northwest, and then
headed into the bush in a landrover.
   He promised the Associated Press and Newsweek photographers at
the scene he would return.
   An hour later, he came back with two healthy SWAPO fighters and
one with a bullet imbedded under his left arm and scarcely able to
stand. All wore civilian clothes and had ditched their weapons.
   Local residents gathered around to shake the fighters' hands.
One, unwounded, said he was 38 years old and had lived in exile for
14 years.
   He said he crossed the border on March 31, and fought the next
day. He said he saw one South African soldier or policeman go down
in battle, but when his rifle jammed, he threw it away and left
before he saw what happened to his comrades.
   After first aid treatment, the Pakistani observers loaded the
guerrillas into a white-painted U.N. landrover. As they traveled
the road, with South African armored personnel carriers driving
past and brown-unifomred soldiers posted at sandbags across the
highway, a Pakistani officer said the guerrillas were ``scared, oh
yes, very scared.''
   By the time they reached Oshikango, the South African soldiers
at the military camp there knew who was in the vehicle, but did
nothing as it drove through sand and bushes into the U.N. base 200
yards away. The U.N. soldiers helped the wounded guerrillas from
the truck, and placed them in a tent while plans were made to send
them across the border to their bases in Angola.
   If the U.N. plan goes according to schedule, a few weeks from
now they may come back, without weapons, to settle in Namibia and
vote in U.N.-supervised elections.

<HEAD>Four Family Members, Fetus Killed In Bloody Rampage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Police have a confession but no motive for a
grisly attack that killed an entire family, including the father,
two toddlers, an expectant mother and her eight-month fetus,
officers said Wednesday.
   Newton Carlton Slawson, 34, was charged with four counts of
first-degree murder and one of manslaughter in the shooting and
stabbing deaths late Tuesday at the home of Gerald and Peggy Wood.
   ``During questioning the suspect admitted to detectives that he
killed the family members,'' police spokesman Steve Cole said in a
statement released earlier in the day. ``No clear-cut motive has
been established. ... We don't know why. We have no idea.''
   Wood, 23, was stabbed to death; his daughter, Jennifer Lynn, 4,
and son Glendon Matthew, 3, were each shot once, police said.
   Peggy Williams Wood, 21, died Wednesday following surgery at
Tampa General Hospital, about 10 hours after the 8-month-term fetus
she was carrying died at the scene, police said.
   Slawson, 34, who had worked with Wood at a compost company, was
being held without bond for a preliminary hearing Thursday.
   Police were called to the family's second-story apartment just
south of Tampa's Ybor City section shortly before 10 p.m. EDT
Tuesday, Cole said.
   Slawson, a stocky Concord, N.C., native with a clean-shaven
head, was arrested shortly after police arrived at the apartment
late Tuesday.
   They said they picked him up about 10 blocks away and recovered
a .357-caliber Magnum pistol and a six-inch folding knife from his
car.
   Slawson was living at a motel and had been visiting the couple's
home earlier in the evening, according to police. ``He went back
later and apparently committed the murders,'' Sgt. Wiley Howell
said.
   After the attack, Mrs. Wood, bleeding severely, managed to crawl
down a staircase and to her parents house next door to summon help.
   Before she was taken to a hospital, Mrs. Wood, still conscious,
told her mother that ``Newton killed her husband and children and
stabbed her,'' Detective D. Grossi said in an affidavit.
   A description of a car seen leaving the scene was broadcast on
police radio. An officer just finishing an off-duty job at a nearby
food store spotted the vehicle about 45 minutes after the killings,
Cole said.
   ``The suspect was taken into custody without incident,'' Cole
said.
   Michael Lange, manager of the Black Gold Compost Co. said
Slawson came to Florida from North Carolina late last year and
worked on a package assembly line for three weeks in February. He
quit to get a job at a fish camp, he said.

   The Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday
unanimously approved President Bush's $90 billion plan for bailing
out the savings and loan industry after rejecting an effort by the
panel's chairman to dump the $50 billion immediate taxpayer portion
of the cost onto the 1989 federal budget.
   The 21-member panel voted 11-10 to establish a quasi-government
corporation for issuing 30-year bonds to finance the government's
share _ as Bush wanted _ instead of the on-budget alternative
advocated by Banking Committee Chairman Don Riegle, D-Mich.
   Democratic Sens. Alan Cranston of California, Alan Dixon of
Illinois and Jim Sasser of Tennessee sided with all but one of the
committee's nine Republicans in favoring Bush's plan over Riegle's.
   But Riegle himself admitted he had lost enthusiasm for the
proposal after Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady repeatedly told
Senate Democrats throughout Wednesday he would recommend that Bush
veto the legislation if it swelled the budget deficit.
   Sasser, who met with Brady throughout the day, said the
administration's opposition would have made the effort to solve the
S&amp;L crisis ``drag on for months.''
   ``The secretary of treasury was absolutely adamant there would
be a presidentia veto and we would be back to square one,'' Sasser
said.
   Earlier, Brady wrote a letter to senators in which he didn't
repeat the Bush veto threat, but did say the administration opposed
Riegle's plan.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., the chief advocate in the House of
such a plan, said he is holding off on proposing it after receiving
a letter Wednesday from White House budget director Richard Darman,
who said he would refuse to count all of the spending in 1989.
   If Darman carried out the threat, it would wreak havoc on
efforts to meet the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit targets in 1990 and
1991. Schumer said Darman has the sole power to make that decision
but said he was still looking for a way to circumvent him.
   Riege said his plan would avoid the ``accounting and budget
gimmickry'' of Bush's proposal by reducing the interest costs of
financing the bailout through direct Treasury borrowing at a
savings of $4.5 billion to taxpayers over the next three decades.
   Utah Sen. Jake Garn, the committee's ranking Republican, said he
still has a ``fundamental disagreement'' over allowing the bailout
costs to swell the federal deficit in apparent violation of a
congressionally mandated reduction target that already has been
exceeded.
   All three versions _ Bush's, the Senate panel's and one being
put together in the House Banking Committee's financial
institutions subcommitee _ would use the $50 billion over the next
three years to pay for the bailouts of some 200 insolvent S&amp;Ls in
1988 plus 350 more that are insolvent or nearly so.
   They also provide for an additional $33 billion _ $300 million a
year of it coming from the industry _ to take care of thrift
insolvencies expected in the 1990s, especially if interest rates
continue to rise or the nation falls into a recession.
   ``The president asked us to move quickly and that's what we've
done,'' Riegle said. ``We've given him a strong bill with many
streamlined reforms and changes that can prevent in the future a
repeat of what's happened in the past.''
   Unlike changes made by the House subcommittee, the Senate
panel's version retains Bush's proposal to double by June 1991 the
required capital that S&amp;L operators must have to qualify for
federal deposit insurance.
   Bush would not shut down institutions that fail to meet that
standard then but he would prevent them from growing. Both Senate
and House versions would allow undercapitalized thrifts to continue
growing, but would restrict that growth primarily to home mortgages
and consumer loans.
   The House panel, which finished its third full day of drafting
the bill, rejected Bush's measure to make S&amp;Ls have the same
minimum capital requirements as banks _ $6 for every $100 of
outstanding loans _ voting 24-23 Tuesday to keep the current floor
_ $3 for every $100 in loans _ but requiring for the first time
that half that amount be in real money.
   Both panels, however, have voted to phase out many of what
critics call ``smoke and mirrors accounting fictions.''
   Those accounting practices have allowed S&amp;Ls to escape putting
up their own cash or retained earnings by counting as capital such
items as investments in non-thrift subsidiaries, ``good will,''
their own borrowings and even losses on bad loans.
   Bush would immediatly end many such bookkeeping practices.
   By a 27-16 vote Wednesday, the House subcommittee voted to
continue allowing S&amp;Ls to funnel depositors' fund into subsidiaries
to invest in risky areas such as commercial real estate
development, fast food franchises and junk bonds.
   The Senate panel's version would phase out such practices over
five years but there were disagreements among senators over whether
to do it in equal yearly installments or all at once.
   The House panel also approved Wednesday a measure by its
chairman, Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-N.J., requiring S&amp;Ls to
concentrate 80 percent of their lending on residential mortgages,
compared with the 60 percent now required.
   But the measure also broadly defines housing to include
consumer, education and small business loans and no S&amp;L would be
penalized if the mix of its current loan portfolio does not meet
the requirement.
   The subcommittee also approved, 34-12, a measure sponsored by
Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the full committee,
which would require the government to offer some of the repossessed
property from failed S&amp;Ls for housing poor people. It authorizes
spending $574 million to subsidize rents on the properties or offer
discounts or low-interest loans to purchasers.
   It adopted another measure, by voice vote, imposing government
oversight on the agency in charge of selling repossessed real
estate and establishing procedures designed to guard against the
dumping of the property at firesale prices.

<DATELINE>MATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a voodoo cult of drug
smugglers, arrested in at least 12 ritual slayings, including a
U.S. college student, said Wednesday they sacrificed their victims
to gain demonic protection from police.
   Police on Wednesday night suspended digging at the ranch where
they found 12 mutilated bodies and said their priority was to find
a Cuban ``godfather'' they believe led the bloody cult.
   ``We killed them for protection,'' Elio Hernandez Rivera, 22, of
Matamoros, told reporters. He said at a news conference that he
shot and killed one victim and decapitated another.
   Asked if he regretted the slayings, he said, ``Yes, but it's too
late.''
   ``Very clearly they believed the human sacrifices and the animal
sacrifices put a magical shield around them that protected them
from evil or harm, even up to bullets,'' said Texas Attorney
General Jim Mattox.
   In addition to the University of Texas pre-medical student, the
victims included a Matamoros policeman, a Mexican federal police
volunteer, and a 16-year-old, Mexican and U.S. officials said. At
least one victim was kidnapped in Brownsville, Texas, in the last
month, and as many as three of the dead may be American, officials
said.
   Contrary to officials' assertions Tuesday, Oran Neck, U.S.
Customs chief agent in Brownsville, just across the Rio Grande from
Matamoras, said Wednesday there was no evidence of cannibalism.
   Felipe Flores, spokesman for the Mexican attorney general's
office, also said he knew nothing about reports of cannibalism,
although he added that victims' brains were cut out and put on a
fire, mixed with blood, herbs, rooster feet, goat heads and turtles.
   Cameron County Sheriff Alex Perez said cult members removed some
victims' vertebrae to use them for necklaces.
   Suspects in Mexican custody told police of 14 human sacrifices,
but no more bodies were found by Wednesday night and digging was
suspended, said Juan Benitez Ayala, head of the Mexican Federal
Judicial Police.
   Mexican officials said five men were arrested in the case.
   Mexican police took four of the men to a news conference
Wednesday and the four said they killed on the command of a cult
``godfather,'' identified by police as Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, a
Cuban national in his late 40s. Police on both sides of the border
were seeking him, and police said he may have fled to the United
States with a female cult member.
   Constanzo killed one of the victims, University of Texas student
Mark Kilroy, said another of the arrested men, Serafin Hernandez
Garcia, 22, of Brownsville.
   Garcia, Rivera and the three other men, all Matamoros residents,
were being detained pending the filing of formal charges of murder,
kidnapping, possession of weapons, and crimes against the state,
said Jose Silva Arroyo, narcotics supervisor for the Mexican
Federal Judicial Police in Matamoros.
   Constanzo apparently introduced a sort of voodoo or black magic
to the area, Neck said.
   The ritual ``has overtones of a religious cult that has been
exported out of Cuba and Haiti as `Santeria,''' Neck said, based on
feathers and other evidence of rituals found at the ranch and the
Matamoros home of a woman also sought by police.
   The Mexican attorney general's office said Costanzo is believed
to have fled into the United States. Mattox said investigators
believe the cult had 10 members.
   The 12 bodies were found Tuesday in graves in a field about 20
miles west of Matamoros by Mexican officials on a routine drug
search.
   Some victims were shot in the head, and others appeared to have
been slain with machetes or sledgehammers, Neck said. Authorities
said they also found candles and kettles full of body parts and
animal bones.
   Cult members were importing about 1,000 pounds of marijuana a
month into the United States, Mattox said.
   Kilroy, a University of Texas student, vanished March 14 in
Matamoros while on spring break, Sheriff's Lt. George Gavito said.
   Kilroy, 21, lived for about 12 hours after his abduction, and
was slain with a machete, Neck said. Kilroy apparently was chosen
at random after the cult members ``were told to pick one Anglo male
that particular night,'' Gavito said.
   One of the suspects, Hernandez Garcia, said Kilroy was
approached by several men.
   ``He was walking and we went up to him and said, `Hey, you need
a ride?' He said, `Yes.' He got into the truck and after we got out
to go to the restroom, he started running and then the other guys
caught up to him,'' Hernandez Garcia said.
   Authorities said Kilroy was recaptured and taken to the ranch
and later killed. ``I didn't kill him, but the others who killed
him hit him with a machete,'' Hernandez Garcia said.
   Perez said suspects confessed to removing Kilroy's brain and
spine and chopping off his legs. In some forms of witchcraft,
removal of the brain signifies a sacrifice of the victim's soul.
   ``I think they must be possessed by the devil. That would be the
only explanation for what they did,'' Kilroy's mother, Helen, said
at a news conference. ``I will pray for them so they will realize
how wrong all this is.'' ``
   ``Mark never had any involvement whatsoever in narcotics,'' said
his father, James. ``He never even tried it. He was afraid of
narcotics but yet it was narcotics that killed Mark.
   ``When people stand there next to you and try to tell you that
marijuana cigarettes doesn't hurt. They're wrong. Marijuana is what
killed Mark. These guys were marijuana smugglers,'' he said.
   In Santa Fe, Texas, Kilroy's hometown, a yellow ribbon ceremony
had been scheduled Wednesday to draw attention to Kilroy's
disappearance. After Tuesday's discovery, the ceremony was
designated a memorial service.
   It was the third drug-related mass killing discovered along the
U.S.-Mexican border within three weeks.
   On March 29, Mexican authorities found the bodies of three women
and six men, all tortured and mutilated, on an abandoned ranch near
Agua Prieta, just across the border from Douglas, Ariz. Mexican and
U.S. investigators said those slayings were drug-related.
   On March 27, two people from Arizona and three from the Mexican
state of Sonora were found bound and stabbed in a shed in Tucson,
Ariz. Those deaths were also called drug-related.

<DATELINE>ROSETTA, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   History made Rosetta one of Egypt's
best-known places, first as a major seaport for the Ottoman Empire,
then as the city that gave its name to the Rosetta Stone, which
yielded the key to ancient hieroglyphics.
   But the Rosetta of today hardly does justice to its rich past.
Few pay any attention to its history and the sardines that once
gave it wealth vanished 20 years ago _ victims of the Aswan High
Dam 750 miles south.
   The town also languishes in worry about a destructive
Mediterranean Sea, which took away its beach three years ago,
swallowing up summer cabins and now threatening precious
agricultural land.
   Rosetta's history lingers in 22 Ottoman-style, three-story
houses tucked among new buildings. Long neglected, the houses
overlook narrow streets shared by horse-drawn carts and 1956
Chevrolets.
   ``This collection of Islamic antiquities from the Ottoman Empire
is second only to Cairo's,'' said Mohammed el-Mallah, curator of
the Al-Amasyali House, now restored and open as a museum of
Rosettan life in the early 19th century. ``In fact, there are more
old houses here than in Cairo.''
   Founded in the ninth century, Rosetta flourished and faded, then
flourished again. By the 17th century it had become one of the most
important ports between Europe and Africa.
   Gypsum figures in a small, recently restored military museum
depict Rosettan townfolk pitched bravely in hand-to-hand combat
against Napoleon I's troops from his French Campaign in the late
18th century and against British soldiers in 1807.
   Napoleon's soldiers found the Rosetta Stone in 1799. Twenty
years later Jean-Francois Champollion, the world's first
Egyptologist, solved the puzzle of ancient heiroglyphic writing
through texts from the Rosetta Stone, a basalt tablet now housed in
the British Museum in London.
   Rosetta's importance began to diminish after that, and by 1819
it was no longer a major port because a new canal south of Rosetta
diverted Nile trade to Alexandria, 40 miles to the west.
   Rosetta, its treasures and its 80,000 people are on hardly any
tourist's itinerary these days.
   Maybe it's because it has no presentable hotels or restaurants.
Or because of the disrepair into which most of the once-elegant
houses have fallen, their intricately designed wooden ceilings,
marble baths and harem areas for women left dark and dusty.
   The Egyptian government, however, envisions a new future for
Rosetta and it is in tourism.
   An anchor of the tourism plan is an odd-looking honeycomb of
anvil-shaped concrete pieces going up along the coast, forming a
seawall to protect the shoreline.
   The wall is well along now, workers are restoring many of the
old houses and mosques, and plans are in place for hotels and
restaurants.
   ``There's a lot to see in Rosetta,'' said Yehia Ibrahim
Mohammed, a part-time museum employee. ``We have some foreigners
visiting, but they're mostly architects and Islamic art experts.''
   Officials say that only after completion of the seawall will
they be able to build a summer resort and a modest hotel and
restaurant.
   That might bring the tourists.
   Local people, however, hope the wall, in stopping sea erosion,
will bring back the sardines.
   The Aswan High Dam had blocked sea erosion-resisting silt far
upstream in the Nile, and by the 1970s the Mediterranean was
washing away 580 feet of Rosetta's shoreline every year. The lack
of silt, which contained nutrients that attracted the sardines,
already had finished off the fishing industry.
   By 1986, at least 70 cabins and a hotel had been inundated at
Rosetta's beach.
   An alarmed national government contracted with a company owned
by the Nationalist Chinese government on Taiwan to build the
$31-million seawall.
   Part of the seawall juts into the Mediterranean, and experts at
Egypt's Irrigation Ministry expect it to act as a baiting ground
for sardines.
   ``Rosetta was famous for its cafes. They were built and spread
around with the sardine wealth,'' said Helmy Zayed, head of the
Rosetta City Council. ``People caught sardines during the season,
then spent their money on businesses, weddings, pilgrimage and
coffee houses.
   ``We used to have heaps of sardines, so many you would lift them
with spades. Every single person in our society has been affected
by the lack of sardines, from the fisherman to the truck driver to
the tradesman.''
   And so, Rosetta is waiting for the sardines.

<HEAD>Just Another Meeting, But Impeachment Was On The Agenda</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the bland, bureaucratic shorthand of the
government memorandum, it sounds routine. Just another White House
meeting. And by the way, the president of the United States chatted
with his senior advisers about risking impeachment.
   That may sound like Richard M. Nixon and the Watergate White
House, but it wasn't. It was Ronald Reagan in 1984, on his way to a
49-state re-election landslide. The question was whether the
administration should be secretly soliciting aid for the Nicaraguan
Contras from other countries after Congress barred U.S. aid.
   The story has been spread on the court record at the Iran-Contra
trial of Oliver North, with the government attesting to its
accuracy. There is no evidence in that record that any of the
senior officials on hand found it remarkable that a top aide to the
president had told him he might be flirting with impeachment.
   It does not seem to have alarmed the Reagan high command. It
certainly didn't get in the way of the search for aid.
   Since impeachment is the ultimate political punishment, the word
would seem to be one that would get any president's attention.
Nixon resigned rather than face an impeachment trial in the Senate.
   This is not to suggest that Reagan policy on aid to the Contras
bears comparison with the Watergate and cover-up scandals that
drove Nixon from office.
   But it is striking that the risk of committing an impeachable
offense was cited by one of the official family, at a meeting
attended by at least 10 other top administration officials _
including George Bush _ and the matter apparently was treated as
ordinary business.
   Bush, then vice president, is quoted in minutes of the meeting
as having observed that the outside aid would be a problem only if
the United States were to promise third countries something in
exchange for their assistance to the Contras.
   Less than a year later, Bush told the president of Honduras that
U.S. aid to that country was being expedited. The court document
says the speeded-up aid was in exchange for Honduras' continuing
support of the Contras, but is silent on whether Bush made that
point in his meeting with the foreign leader.
   President Bush has refused to discuss those disclosures, saying
any comment from him would interfere with the North trial.
   It was James A. Baker III, then the White House chief of staff,
later Reagan's secretary of the treasury, now Bush's secretary of
state, who raised the specter of impeachment.
   Baker's concern seems to have raised no alarm at the meeting on
June 25, 1984, no suggestion that even coming close to impeachable
conduct might not be a very good idea. The consensus was that Baker
was wrong.
   So they decided to get a second legal opinion.
   According to the government's admission of facts at the North
trial, Director of Central Intelligence William Casey told deputies
at the CIA and the State Department in mid-July it was time to get
moving on Contra aid from other countries ``since Attorney General
(William French) Smith had recently concluded that raising the
funds in this manner would not be an impeachable offense, as had
been suggested at the National Security Planning Group meeting on
June 25, 1984.''
   Minutes of the June 25 meeting were read into the North trial
record on March 10, when former national security adviser Robert
MacFarlane testified that Baker's warning had been discussed and
disputed, and that most of those present disagreed with it.
   Whatever the merits of Baker's legal advice, the minutes
indicate that Reagan recognized the political peril of promoting
aid to the Contras by other governments in the face of the
congressional ban on U.S. military aid. He was quoted as saying
that if word of the effort got out, ``We'll all be hanging by our
thumbs in front of the White House.''
   All of that happened during the ``Rose Garden'' phase of
Reagan's campaign for a second term. The public record of Reagan's
day that June 25 shows a meeting with members of his staff, a
meeting with members of his campaign advisory committee and two
White House speeches.
   At one of them, on the South Lawn, the president complained
about critics of his economic policies. ``Every time I hear them,''
he said, ``I remember Robert Frost saying, `The brain is a
wonderful organ. It starts working the moment you get up in the
morning and doesn't stop until you get to the office.'''

   For more than three years, the Vatican has been
seeking to set firmer rules to keep Catholic colleges and
universities toeing the church line _ sometimes to their chagrin.
   That issue comes to a head when a delegation of their presidents
_ 18 of them _ confer next week with Vatican officials and Pope
John Paul II about the matter.
   ``We're hoping to work through some of the ambiguities that need
to be resolved,'' said the Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare, president of New
York's Fordham University.
   It's among 232 Catholic institutions of higher learning in the
United States, many established by religious orders, but now mostly
governed by independent boards of trustees.
   They insist that they uphold their Catholic identities in a
broad sense, but that specifying ecclesiastical restraints would
cloud academic standing and integrity.
   ``Church officials have every right to criticize academic
teaching, but to try to apply sanctions in a university is not
appropriate,'' O'Hare said in an interview. ``It wouldn't work.''
   The Vatican's Congregation for Catholic Education in 1985 first
circulated its ``working paper'' of suggestions for bishops to
require adherence of Catholic colleges and universities to various
church criteria.
   This stirred wide protests. Catholic educators said such control
would undermine standards of academic freedom, jeopardize
accreditation, block government aid and destroy many colleges.
   Both their faculties and student bodies are widely
interreligious, but they maintain they carry on Catholic ideals in
an ecumenical atmosphere of open inquiry into all truth.
   Responding to their protests, the Vatican last November issued a
revised ``working paper,'' the document that will be under
consideration at the April 18-25 meeting between university
presidents and Vatican officials.
   ``It's a much better document, with a lot of positive things
about it,'' says Brother Raymond L. Fitz, president of the
University of Dayton, the nation's ninth largest Catholic
university.
   However, he added in a telephone interview, ``the whole thing
still needs work to define more clearly the autonomy of a Catholic
university and its academic freedom.''
   To endanger those qualities ``would be absolute disaster,'' he
said, adding:
   ``We're going to have to make the point that we've been able to
maintain strong institutional Catholic identity, and at the same
time do so in an atmosphere of academic and institutional autonomy.
   ``I think what's going to be persusasive is that we've done so
well in maintaining both those dimensions. We're beginning to get
the message across that we can be Catholic and also be real
universities that have moved into the forefront of American
intellectual life.''
   Development of the Vatican document on higher education is seen
as part of the pope's policies to tighten adherence to church
positions in the face of secularized cultures.
   The new draft provides that no university may have the word
``Catholic'' in its official title without consent of
ecclesiastical authority, which is to insure Catholic doctrinal
teaching and observance at the university and may intervene for
grave reasons to declare it ``no longer Catholic.''
   ``In ways consistent with the different academic disciplines,
teachers will be faithful to Catholic doctrine in their research
and teaching,'' the document says. ``Those who teach theological
subjects as regular teachers must have a mandate from the competent
ecclesiastical authority.''
   At the same time, the document often qualifies its requirements
by saying they should be worked out on a consultative basis, and
may vary according to regulations of the institutions and accepted
academic practices.
   The provisions enable ``universities to dialogue with American
bishops about the goals,'' said Sister Alice Gallin, secretary of
the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, based in
Washington.
   ``It's a more decentralized way of implementation.''
   She said the first part of the document in setting the general
goals of Catholic universities is ``something we can live with
without too much trouble,'' but the second part is ``potentially
more troubling.''
   It lays down so-called ``norms'' for Catholic institutions, a
word she said can be interpreted as ``laws.'' She said the
educators also don't like the document saying bishops could
``intervene'' in universities.
   ``The problem is sometimes a question of the words used,'' she
said. ``We all agree that the purpose of a good strong Catholic
university is to remain Catholic in purpose.
   ``But we've done very well over the last 200 years, and ought to

   O'Hare, in his 1988 president's report on the ``Catholic

Catholic identity demands a religious test for either faculty or
students.''
   He says the church's influence is ``present within the
university, even if the university, as an institution, is outside
of the jurisdiction of canon law and ecclesiastical authority.''

   Christian protests apparently are having
increased influence on commercial advertisers on television, as
indicated by some of their recent actions.
   The American Family Association, based here, called off its
boycott of the Pepsi Cola company, saying it has agreed not to air
its Madonna commercial or to sponsor the rock singer's tour.
   Roman Catholic Bishop Rene H. Gracida of Corpus Christi, Texas,
also canceled a boycott which he had called against the Pepsi
company because of Madonna's sensual video, ``Like a Prayer.''
   ``We think Pepsi has made a very wise business and moral
decision,'' says the Rev. Donld E. Wildmon, AFA executive director.
   He also says Domino's Pizza, Ralston Purina and General Mills
have canceled their advertising on Saturday Night Live after
protests from the association.
   ``More and more corporations are beginning to say no to the
exploitative and anti-Christian programming of the networks,'' he
says.

<HEAD>Mike Farrell Interprets Role as Lawyer in ABC Docudrama</HEAD>

   Mike Farrell knew when he took on the role of
Paul Gianelli, the attorney who defended a New York teen-ager
accused of arranging her father's murder, that he wanted to put
some of himself into the character.
   ``I saw some video tape of him being interviewed,'' said
Farrell, best remembered for his ``M-A-S-H'' role as B.J. Hunnicut.
``I decided I wasn't going to do an imitation of him. I was going
to create my own character. He was very real within the script.''
   In the ABC movie ``A Deadly Silence'' on Sunday, as in actual
events on Long Island, N.Y., Gianelli defends teen-ager Cheryl
Pierson on a charge that she hired a schoolmate to kill her father.
She contended that she had him killed to stop his sexual abuse.
   ``I met the reporter who wrote the book,'' he said, referring to
Dena Kleiman of The New York Times. ``She was a terrific source of
information. Gianelli was a straightforward lawyer whose practice
was mostly domestic but he had done some corporate work.
   ``The thing that interested me was that on a human level he
really connected with this girl and became very committed to her
welfare. The more he found about what her life had been like, the
more passionate he became about her case.''
   Kleiman's book related Cheryl's story of her years-long
entrapment in an incestuous relationship with her father, James
Pierson. It probes deeper, however, to reveal a conspiracy of
silence by friends and relatives.
   Pierson was shot to death on Feb. 5, 1986, at his home in
Selden. Cheryl, then 16, was accused of paying a classmate $1,000
to kill him. She served 3{ months of her 6-month sentence.
   ``A Deadly Silence'' also stars Charles Haid as James Pierson, a
robust electrician who clung to such trappings of youth as fast
cars and motorcycles; Sally Struthers as social worker Marilyn
Adams; Bruce Weitz as Detective James McCready, and Heather
Fairfield as Cheryl. John Patterson directed from a screenplay by
Jennifer Miller for executive producer Robert Greenwald.
   ``Because of the circumstances'' of Cheryl's case, Farrell said,
``some people felt she should not serve any time at all but should
be put on some form of probation. She was a person who was trying
to extricate herself, albeit violently, from a terrible situation.
   ``She hired a classmate to kill her father. Her class had
discussed a story about an abused wife who had hired someone to
kill her husband. She said, `Who would do a thing like that?' and
her classmate said he would.''
   Farrell has not been in a series since ``M-A-S-H'' left the air
in 1983. He had been a journeyman actor before that, appearing in
two other series, but it was ``M-A-S-H'' that gave him star power.
He has starred in several unsuccessful pilots, however, including
the 1985 movie-pilot ``Private Sessions'' in which he played a
psychologist.
   He said he would now prefer to devote his time to movies, as he
has done for the past several years. He produces feature and
television movies and appears in some TV films. His production
partner is Marvin Minoff. They produced the feature film ``Dominick
and Eugene,'' and Farrell also directed the TV movie ``Run Till You
Fall.'' He starred in ``Memorial Day'' and ``Choices of the Heart.''
   If many of Farrell's films seem to have messages, it's no
accident. He is passionately committed to causes.
   One is fighting pollution, and his next movie, ``The Smell of
Money,'' deals with toxic waste. He co-wrote the story with David
Reiss, and Albert Rubin wrote the screenplay. Farrell will produce
and star in the movie for Turner Network Television.
   ``The movie's about a man against the system,'' said Farrell.
``His daughter becomes ill and dies from what he learns is toxic
waste dumped into a stream by a factory. It's a one-factory town,
and when he takes on the factory everyone turns on him rather than
the polluter. We'll shoot it on location in Utah.''
   Since 1984, Farrell has been married to actress Shelley Fabares,
who is currently co-starring in the ABC series ``Coach.''
   ``I'd just come back from El Salvador in 1982 and CBS asked me
to go to their affiliates meeting in San Francisco,'' he said.
``Shelley was doing `One Day at a Time' and she was there, too.
Neither one of us was married and it turned out very well.''

<BYLINE>The Fine Points of Mortgage ``Points'' ^By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When they shop for home mortgage loans these
days, most borrowers find themselves comparing not only interest
rates but ``points.''
   A point, simply defined, is 1 percent of the amount of a
mortgage, paid by the borrower to the lender at the time a loan is
made.
   In an era of high interest rates, banks and other financial
institutions have increasingly relied on points as a way of
maintaining the return they get on their lending activities without
having to raise their rates to forbidding levels.
   For example, one New York bank recently offered a one-year
adjustable rate mortgage with no points at a starting interest rate
of 10.25 percent.
   A competitor, meanwhile, was touting a one-year adjustable loan,
with 2{ points, at 9.625 percent.
   Assuming you could qualify for either, which one should you
choose? With adjustable mortgages in particular, there are other
important variables to consider _ for example, caps on interest
rate increases from year to year and over the life of the loan.
   But all other things being equal, the choice of a deal with or
without points would depend on your circumstances as well as its
mathematical merits.
   The higher-rate loan, for example, might appeal to people whose
assets are stretched to the limit making a minimum down payment on
a home, but who are confident their future earnings will cover
higher monthly mortgage payments.
   Conversely, someone who is mainly worried about keeping monthly
costs down might opt for paying points up front to get the lower
rate.
   The burden of paying points historically has been lightened by a
tax deduction. Borrowers simply included the amount of any points
they paid in the mortgage-interest deduction on their tax returns.
   But with recent changes in the tax laws, the situation is no
longer quite so simple.
   Points still qualify for a lump-sump deduction in the year you
pay them if the charge was incurred as part of the purchase or
improvement of your primary residence.
   Otherwise, they must be spread out for tax purposes over the
life of the loan, as though they were interest payments made at
periodic intervals.
   And to put them out in plain sight, the Internal Revenue
Service's forms now require that deductions for points paid be
reported on a separate line from mortgage interest.
   This poses a problem for people who refinance their houses. The
IRS's position, supported by a recent court ruling, is that points
paid on refinancing don't qualify for a lump-sum deduction, unless
the money is clearly used for home improvements.
   The new restrictions can also trip up unwary borrowers at the
time of purchase if they don't actually pay the points in cash.
   ``Unfortunately,'' says William Brennan, a tax expert at the
accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Whinney, ``many mortgage departments are
not familiar enough with this rule and automatically suggest adding
the points to the amount of the loan, thus killing the taxpayer's
chance to qualify for current deductibility.
   ``The solution, of course, is to pay the points from some source
other than the lending bank,'' Brennan observes.
   ``If you do not have the money available, you can borrow from
another bank, so as to satisfy the test that you have paid the
points from your own funds.''

<HEAD>Technology, A Tool Not An Answer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After many years during which they sought to
slim down and become more efficient, a large number of America's
manufacturing organizations remain far too complex and weighted by
tradition.
   That observation might come as a surprise to people who have
heard of vastly reduced white-collar workforces, and the use of
robots, automation, computers and other products of the so-called
technological revolution.
   But, says Robert Leach, partner in Andersen Consulting, to throw
technology at manufacturing has about as little chance of resolving
its problems as Washington's attempt to attack social problems with
an avalanche of dollars.
   ``The problem is not technology,'' says Leach. ``It's that too
many companies rushed into it, throwing robots at everything. But
let's face it: If you automate a mess you still have a mess.''
   In his view, based on experience in modernizing large
manufacturing facilities, to tinker with technology can't possibly
help. What is required, he says, is the guts to step back and ask:
``How would I reinvent this business?''
   He is serious, and concerned, which is the reason for speaking
out. ``We've been losing one market after another to foreign
competition,'' he says, ``and it would be a lot worse if the weak
dollar weren't helping us abroad.''
   In Washington, as well as in many public and private study
groups, the ``answers'' being offered are almost always the same,
that we must provide more icnentive to invest in technology.
Technology is equated with competitiveness.
   It isn't so, says Leach. ``I've seen production flows so
complicated they remind you of `The Flight of the Bumble Bee.'''
Quality and lead time, he says, are undercut by excessive movement
of products through the factory.
   Instead of changing business from the inside out, says Leach, we
must start with the marketplace and work back, providing added
value that cannot come from outdated techniques. Value, he says, is
not just price _ it is quality, ease of use, availability and
service, to name just some of its elements.
   After making the decision to add value, he says, you must look
at every element from raw material sourcing through production and
distribution. That is, you must think outside-in rather than the
traditional inside-out.
   Working back from the marketplace, you must ask a basic
question: ``Does this activity add value to the end-product? If the
answer is no you eliminate it.'' The goal, he explains, is to
create a smooth, logistical pipeline.
   That type of thinking at a Lockheed's Aeronautical Systems Group
resulted in a radical simplification of an entire sheet metal
fabrication process.
   Results: Parts that once traveled 2,500 feet in the course of
processing now travel only 150 feet. Lead time to produce a part
was cut to two days from 52. Quality rose. Fewer inspections were
needed. Inventories were cut.
   Lockheed did it without a lot of robots or automated guided
vehicles, said Leach. He conceded that more technology was added,
``but only as a set of tools to support simplification.''
   It isn't easy, he says, but it is necessary if American
manufacturers are to become truly competitive. So far, he isn't
convinced that they are.
   ``If a manager wants to break with tradition, he has to link all
the corporate fiefdoms that have evolved over the years,'' he
states. ``The walls between these islands of confusion must be
broken down. We have to get people talking with each other at the
earliest stages of product development.''
   In a traditional company, he continues, designers work on their
own, then throw a design over the walls to engineering,
manufacturing and marketing. They in turn throw it back, eating up
precious development time.
   In contrast, at a competitive company teams of designers,
engineers, and manufacturers focus on one common, overriding goal
from day one _ how to get better products in half the time.
   ``You don't do that by simply stepping on the gas,'' Leach
concludes. ``You rethink the business. Then you integrate all the
elements. You get everyone speaking the same language and sharing
the same information.''
   Technology might be a part of the rethinking. But only as a tool.

<TEXT>
   ``Finished this day and I hope it's good,'' John
Steinbeck wrote in his journal in 1938.
   The book he had just completed was ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' a
novel that would awaken the social conscience of Americans in a way
that ``Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' ``The Jungle'' and few other works of
fiction have.
   Viking Press, which published ``The Grapes of Wrath'' on April
14, 1939, is marking the 50th anniversary of the book with a
commemorative edition containing an introduction by Studs Terkel.
It is also publishing ``Working Days,'' journals Steinbeck kept
during the research and writing of what critics consider his
greatest work.
   When he sat down to write his saga of the Joads, a Dust Bowl
family migrating to California for a new life, Steinbeck, 36, had
already attained celebrity with ``Tortilla Flat,'' ``Of Mice and
Men'' (which had been made into a long-running Broadway play) and
four other novels.
   He wrote what he called his ``big book'' in a five-month
marathon, scribbling a prodigious 2,000 words a day. Steinbeck
scholar Robert DeMott, who edited the journals for publication,
notes that the manuscripts strikingly show little revision.
   But the author had already laid much groundwork, having studied
the migrant farmers from Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and Arkansas _
derisively dubbed ``Okies'' _ for a series of articles that
appeared in The San Francisco News. He had bought an old bakery
truck and equipped it with blankets, food and camping equipment and
spent time in a migrant resettling camp. (Contrary to popular myth,
he never made the trek from Oklahoma to California, as did his
fictional Joads.)
   Steinbeck had also written a 70,000-word precursor to ``The
Grapes of Wrath'' that he destroyed, saying the novel was too
vicious and ``smart-alec,'' too much of a political tract. But it
rid him of some of the venom he felt against the Associated Farmers
Inc. and others he felt responsible for the workers' plight, and
allowed him to write what he thought was a more rounded novel.
   Indeed, the question most frequently debated about ``The Grapes
of Wrath,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize, is whether it is art or
firebrand propaganda.

<TEXT>
   ``Sure, cried the tenant farmers, but it's our land. We were
born on it, and got killed on it, and we died on it. Even if it's
no good, it's still ours. That's what makes it ours. ... That makes
ownership, not a paper with numbers on it.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Immediately after its release, newspaper editorials, legislators
and farmers decried the novel as a distorted portrait of migrant
life. The book was burned in several cities, including Salinas,
Calif., Steinbeck's hometown, and was banned in many libraries and
schools.
   Eleanor Roosevelt defended the book in her weekly column, and in
1940 a congressional committee held hearings in Oklahoma to find
out whether the squalid conditions and brutal treatment of the
workers recounted in the novel were accurate. The committee's
findings vindicated the author.
   Upon Steinbeck's death in 1968, The New York Times wrote the
following about the book: ``The timorous and savagely reactionary
among us were fretfully afraid that Steinbeck had gone too far in
his novel's portrayal of the desperately distressed in America.
Bless their hearts, they were dead right. He was out to rouse, not
to soothe us into asking human beings to starve quietly and
inconspiculously during those years of Depression and despair.''
   Terkel said he finds modern-day critics who call ``The Grapes of
Wrath'' propaganda ``pretty tiresome.''
   ``You can can say `Moby Dick' is propaganda,'' the author and
radio raconteur said in a telephone interview from his Chicago
office.
   Terkel, who toured the Midwest in 1987 when family farms were
foreclosing one after another, and who witnessed the drought of
1988 played out on the six o'clock news, finds Steinbeck's words
startlingly relevant today.
   ``It's as though we never experienced the Depression and hadn't
learned anything from it,'' said Terkel, who planned to mark the
anniversary by reading from the novel on his radio show,
interspersed with selections from ``Dustbowl Ballads'' by Woody
Guthrie.
   It should be noted that while critics hashed out the literary
merits of the book, the public snapped it up in droves. It was the
best-selling book of 1939 and one of the top 10 best-sellers in
1940. It also produced a successful movie adaptation starring Henry
Fonda that won director John Ford an Academy Award.
   ``The Grapes of Wrath'' remains one of Viking's all-time
best-sellers today and has sold some 14 million copies worldwide,
said Viking spokesman Paul Slovak.

   In awarding Steinbeck the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962,
the Swedish Academy cited the ``towering standard'' the author set
in ``The Grapes of Wrath'' more than two decades earlier, although
he had produced more than a dozen novels and plays since that work.
   DeMott, founder of The Steinbeck Quarterly and an English
professor at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, says in the preface
of ``Working Days'' that Steinbeck's legacy was ``his willingness
to risk everything to write the best he could with what what gifts
he had, and in doing so to reveal, unblinking, the enduring human
spirit among the ruthless shapes of paradise.''

<DATELINE>GREENSBURG, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Change comes slowly down the two-lane
highway that winds through forests, dairy farms and cattle barns
into Greensburg.
   It's taken four decades for desegregation to reach the seat of
St. Helena Parish, and even now a visitor looking for John Hall's
house behind the Masonic lodge is asked, ``You talking about the
white Masonic hall or the black one?''
   ``This parish hasn't changed since 1907. ... Education has been
what kept it like it is,'' said Hall, a construction worker who has
spent 37 of his 70 years fighting to give black students _
including his 14 children _ a chance.
   Hall filed suit in 1952 after being told that the school
district didn't have money to furnish a black school. Ironically,
segregation ended because the district couldn't afford to keep it
going. This semester is the first in St. Helena Parish with all
black and white students under the same roof.
   Under a plan approved in December by U.S. District Judge John
Parker in Baton Rouge, classes were consolidated into three
buildings, including one that Hall and other black residents built
in the early 1950s.
   ``I'm not trying to take credit for anything,'' Hall said. ``I
wanted my children to get an education and that's what they got.''
   St. Helena Parish has one of Louisiana's poorest school
districts. About 95 percent of the parish's annual $6.5 million
budget comes from the state. Until Jan. 6, its 2,040 students, 70
percent of them black, attended seven schools.
   ``There is no question the St. Helena Parish School Board has
been operated in violation of the U.S. Constitution,'' Parker said
in December, adding that consolidation ``means desegregation will
be accomplished.''
   He said some of the schools ``are not fit for a dog house.''
Superintendent Perry P. Spears said all seven were substandard.
Spears, who is black and went to school here, plans to do away with
a fifth school and is working to float a $7.5 million bond issue
this fall to improve the remaining two.
   ``I enjoyed my elementary and high school career in St. Helena,
but at the same time I knew that we were not being supported
equally,'' he said.
   The point was driven home for Spears when he became
superintendent three years ago and saw that white schools had
equipment like washing machines and dryers for the athletic
programs. The black schools did not.
   Back in the early 1950s, black students often sat on soft drink
cases, boxes and pieces of logs to listen to a teacher who didn't
have enough supplies ``or even a chair to sit down on,'' Hall said.
``These schools were as bad as anything you've ever seen. I don't
know why they'd send children up here to get an education at a
place like that. I'd rather put them under a tree.''
   In 1952, he asked the board for a new black school. Officials
told him there wasn't enough money, but they made a deal _ build
the school yourself and the parish will furnish it. The black
community pitched in their meager assets and their elbow grease to
build a new school. Hall returned to complete the deal _ and was
told there was no money for furnishings.
   ``I told him right then that I'm going to take my children up
there to go to school with the white folks,'' he said. ``He took
him a good laugh. He and his crew had a big fun-making deal about
it, I understand.''
   Hall didn't laugh. He, his father, and two other black residents
who still want to remain anonymous went to A.P. Tureaud, an
attorney for the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.
   ``They said you're going to have some mad white folks here,''
Hall said. ``I said I was already mad.'' Despite the warning, he
said, the black residents faced ``nothing more than talk. All kinds
of threats and talk.''
   Although the Supreme Court outlawed segregated schools in 1954,
Hall's suit and scores of other desegregation cases floated in the
courts for years.
   In the 1960s, St. Helena Parish built a modern black high
school. A few blacks started going to white Greensburg High School
and a few whites attended classes in the black schools. ``It was
all token desegregation,'' Hall said.
   Segregation hurt both black and white students, he said. ``You
can't hold back one race without holding the other back.''
   Over the years, running seven schools used up the parish's
allotment of state-supported teacher salaries and resulted in
duplication of basic classes. As a result, few advanced classes
were offered and the students suffered.
   ``We have not been able to offer a comprehensive curriculum,''
Spears said. ``I feel that was the biggest disadvantage we had over
the years.''
   Under consolidation, elementary school students eat lunch in a
makeshift cafeteria set up in an old gymnasium, and some attend
class in trailers. Head Start pupils still go to the cramped
building that black residents built.
   Most opposition came from parents, Spears said. ``They have
caused a problem by letting their kids see how much they oppose
consolidation. I don't think our kids generally oppose
consolidation.''
   In fact, students give consolidation a mixed review.
   ``It's going on pretty well now,'' said Pamecia Foskey, a black
senior. ``It's all coming together. We're thinking of it as one
school.''
   ``It'll probably be better next year, but I won't be around to
find out,'' said Kelly Smith, a white sophomore who is going to
private school in Mississippi next fall.
   ``It's gone better than everybody thought,'' said DeAnn Fugler,
a white sophomore who also plans to go to private school. ``It's
too crowded right now. If the facility gets better, I might come
back. It's hard to tell.''
   About 150 students, mostly white, have enrolled in private
schools or are illegally attending public schools in other
parishes, Spears said.
   He is enthusiastic about the future, especially if the bond
issue passes.
   ``I think that the community is going to have more pride in its
schools. We won't have that competition between schools. The
competition is because we had all-white and all-black schools.''
   A recent high school basketball game was an example of what
Spears hopes will become the rule. ``It was obvious that these were
kids that had never been brought together before. The support was
like we hadn't had before. It's now one-and-one. I feel good about
it. It's going to be a family relationship.''
   Hall, who thought his lawsuit would be settled in four or five
years, isn't so sure. ``It will be slow, slow. The chance for
change will have to come with the new generation, not with none of
the ones who are here now.''

   The idea in the early days of the ecumenical
movement that doctrine divides the churches but social causes unite
them has been reversed, says a noted Protestant ecumenist.
   The Rev. J. Robert Nelson, a United Methodist scholar of
Houston, told a gathering of Protestant and Catholic scholars that
the phrase, ``insurmountable obstacle'' used to be applied to
matters of faith, but added:
   ``We are now inclined to attach it to an array of nagging,
difficult problems of social ethics and personal morality.''

   Christian protests apparently are having
increased influence on commercial advertisers on television, as
indicated by some of their recent actions.
   The American Family Association, based here, called off its
boycott of the Pepsi Cola company, saying it has agreed not to air
its Madonna commercial or to sponsor the rock singer's tour.
   Roman Catholic Bishop Rene H. Gracida of Corpus Christi, Texas,
also canceled a boycott which he had called against the Pepsi
company because of Madonna's sensual video, ``Like a Prayer.''
   ``We think Pepsi has made a very wise business and moral
decision,'' says the Rev. Donld E. Wildmon, AFA executive director.
   He also says Domino's Pizza, Ralston Purina and General Mills
have canceled their advertising on Saturday Night Live after
protests from the association.
   ``More and more corporations are beginning to say no to the
exploitative and anti-Christian programming of the networks,'' he
says.

   Deep within the Florida Panhandle's
aromatic piney woods is a small place where some of the nation's
best-known and wealthiest men come to spend time.
   Occasionally, the locals say, the swells arrive in fancy cars
driven by uniformed chauffeurs. Recent visitors included the head
of a famous fashion house, a federal judge and a former congressman.
   Even top sports figures, such as LaMarr Hoyt, the Cy Young
Award-winning pitcher, sometimes show up.
   While in residence, these big shots may try their hand at
Italian lawn bowling. Or they can indulge themselves on the tennis
courts, play a game of racquetball or take a turn on a walking
trail that winds through landscaped grounds past a lake.
   Afterwards, they can catch a movie on cable TV or, if they have
the money, visit the commissary for a cup of cappuccino and some
Haagen-Dazs Macadamia Brittle, one of several flavors.
   There are drawbacks.
   There is no swimming pool. And, since this exclusive little
facility is a federal prison camp, everyone must sleep in
dormitories and work eight hours a day, at a beginning pay rate of
11 cents an hour.
   Welcome to ``Club Fed,'' as the Eglin Federal Prison Camp is
sometimes called. It is one the 27 federal work camps where the
U.S. Bureau of Prisons houses its least dangerous felons.
   Sometimes derisively dubbed a ``country club prison,'' Eglin
houses a population that's 66 percent white, 12 percent black, and
22 percent Hispanic. Higher-security federal prisons house about
equal numbers of blacks and whites.
   Two-thirds of the Eglin inmates have never been to prison before.
   ``These are non-violent people from a variety of backgrounds;
not all of them are big shots, by any means,'' said Willie Scott,
superintendent of the 28-acre compound. ``Most of them are serving
short sentences. And, since they aren't dangerous and we are
located on a military base, we don't even need to have a fence
around the place.''
   Asked if he was running a prison for rich white inmates, Scott
said, ``Definitely not.'' He explained the white-black ratio by
saying that blacks tend to live in more economically depressed
areas where there's a greater likelihood of violent crime while
whites have more opportunity for so-called white-collar criminal
acts.
   Even without a fence, escapes are relatively rare among the 830
white-collar tax cheats, embezzlers, Medicaid-chiseling doctors,
shyster lawyers, crooked politicians and low-level drug dealers who
make up the camp population.
   ``We have about a half-dozen walkaways each year,'' Scott said.
``But anybody who walks knows he won't be coming back here. He'll
be going to a higher-security prison where the inmates are more
violent and there's less freedom.''
   Inmates say the camp is more hell than heaven.
   ``This is no country club. At a country club you get to go home
when you want to,'' said Stephen Gray, a Californian who is serving
time for bank fraud.
   ``The only thing this place is good for is to cause divorces and
put children on the street without a father.''
   Gray called the prison a waste of taxpayers' money. ``If we're
not dangerous, what are we doing here?'' he said.
   It costs the government almost $11,000 a year to keep each of
the nearly 12,000 inmates currently incarcerated in prison camps.
That's $132 million annually, said Greg Bogdan, a spokesman for the
U.S. Bureau of Prisons.
   ``Eleven thousand a year is a lot of money but it's still
relatively cheap when you think that it costs about $18,000 a year
to keep a man behind a fence,'' said Scott, a 17-year veteran of
the federal penal system who came to Eglin from the maximum
security prison at Marion, Ill.
   He disagrees with critics who say the prison camps are little
more than white-collar gulags. ``If the idea is to deter crime,
there's no deterrent like incarceration,'' Scott said.
   Some prisons have been called schools for crime, but Scott said
Eglin is the opposite. Contact with the educated professionals
among the inmates can benefit other prisoners.
   Some recent big-name inmates include 81-year-old Aldo Gucci,
head of the fashion empire. He served a one-year term for tax
evasion.
   U.S. District Judge Walter Nixon Jr., a convicted perjurer, and
former congressman Richard Kelly, snared in the FBI's ABSCAM sting,
served time at Eglin.
   Inmate Greg Bell remembers Gucci as a man of immense presence.
   ``I was working in food services when he was here,'' recalled
Bell, a Melbourne, Fla., contractor who's doing 37 months for a
drug deal. ``I used to really get a kick out of serving him
breakfast. I'd say, `And how would you like your eggs today, Mr.
Gucci?'''
   Gucci worked in the prison's tailor shop, doing alterations.
   While some inmates deride the camp's educational and industrial
training programs, Bell said he learned a great deal from a stock
option course taught by an inmate who used to be a commodities
broker.
   Inmates at other prisons who qualify for Eglin because of good
behavior are on a waiting list.
   ``We're already doubled up here,'' Scott said. ``There's no more
room. At this time, the federal prison system is 154 percent
overcrowded and will become even more so what with the new
sentencing guidelines that mandate stiffer sentences and more time
served.''
   Faced with this expanding prison population, the government has
built five new labor camps within 18 months, four of them on
military bases. ``It's just much cheaper to use existing facilities
than building new camps,'' Bogdan said.
   John Oury, the associate superintendent at Eglin, added, ``Our
mission here isn't to make things easy for criminals; it is to
provide support for the military base.
   ``As a taxpayer I'd much rather see our uniformed personnel
spending their time protecting the country than picking up trash.
Let the prisoners pick up the trash and maintain the base; it makes
good sense and saves money.''

<HEAD>Yeutter Says U.S. Onslaught Against Trade Barriers Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says the
European Economic Community shouldn't think it has forced the
United States to turn tail on the issue of disruptive farm
subsidies.
   Quite the contrary, he says, U.S. negotiators are holding to a
hard line that calls for the elimination of trade-distorting
subsidies over the long haul.
   ``The United States will continue to aggressively seek
elimination of trade-distorting measures,'' he said. ``The
long-term component of the negotiations will indeed be an arduous
exercise, but it i is long overdue.''
   Some may have thought the EEC won a victory of sorts when it
blocked some of the wording initially offered in the U.S. proposal
seeking the eventual ``elimination'' s an effort thatof trade-distorting
subsidies.
   Even after the United States changed the wording to seek a
``ratcheting'' down of the subsidies in future years, the 12-nation
trading bloc remained unmovable.
   Finally, in Geneva talks the week of April 2-8, more than 100
countries reached agreement on an agricultural framework to be used
in further trade negotiations in the months ahead. It calls for a
``substantial progressive reduction'' of disruptive farm subsidies.
No mentionon that the committment
must be consistent with existing legislation.''
   The report added: ``Our assessment is that this will not require
us to do anything differently from what we are now doing. For 1990,
our 1985 farm legislation requires cuts in some support prices.''
   In other words, the report said, the short-term agreement is a
political commitment to prevent worsening of policies that distort
agricultural trade while long-term reform is being negotiated.
   Here are further observations from the Yeutter background report
on the short-term agreement reached in Geneva and how the accord
may affect U.S. programs:
   _ The operation of the sugar program, including import quotas,
will not be restricted.
   _ No commitment was made on the operation of the acreage
reduction programs that cover major crops such as wheat and feed
grains. Other countries were convinced that it would be unwise to
``bind our hands'' when U.S. and global stockpiles are low.
   _ Spending under the Export Enhancement Program _ EEP _ and
other export programs will not be frozen. There was no specific
commitment on the level of expenditure for any single program,
although ``export subsidization is included as part of a broad
commitment not to exceed current levels of domestic and export
support and protection.''
   Under EEP, targeted countries can buy U.S. commodities at
subsidized prices. The program is aimed at keeping U.S. products
competitive with other countries, notably the EEC, which subsidize
exports.
   _ Trade retaliation will not be prohibited under so-called
Section 301 procedures. The United States said since the beginning
of the Uruguay Round that ``we would not suspend our right to
defend ourselves against unfair trade practices during the course
of the negotiations.''
   _ There is no plan to initiate Section 301 action against Japan
because of its restriction on imports of rice. The United States
said Japanese rice is a subject for the Uruguay Round, and ``as
long as Japan continues to be cooperative in the negotiations, we
will stick to that approach.''

   ``You know, this fellow is many-sided _ a tramp, a gentleman, a

   Ask George Burns to say something funny and
he'll come back with two words: ``Charlie Chaplin.''
   To Lucille Ball, Chaplin was ``pure genius,'' and Jack Lemmon
calls him ``the definitive artist of this century.''
   Few characters in film history ever touched as many lives as
Chaplin's Tramp. ``The Little Fellow,'' as he called him, was the
epitome of the fighting underdog: down but never out; hopelessly
romantic despite endless disappointment; determined to retain his
dignity in the face of despair and humiliation.
   Chaplin moved beyond the pie-throwing and wild chases of
slapstick to make audiences understand the Tramp's feelings about
himself and the world around him. He was, as the film critic James
Agee once said, ``the first man to give the silent language a
soul.''
   April 16 marks the 100th anniversary of Chaplin's birth, and his
centennial is being celebrated with tributes throughout the world.
   His admirers included kings and queens, soldiers and prisoners.
Children chased him in the street. Writers and poets sought his
company. From London to Japan, crowds would swarm around him.
   Generations of performers looked to Chaplin as they sculpted
their own brands of humor.
   Bill Cosby realized the extent of Chaplin's influence after
seeing his 1931 classic, ``City Lights,'' in which the Tramp
befriends a millionaire and falls in love with a blind girl.
   ``While watching the feature, I was getting very angry at
Charlie Chaplin because I was noticing he was doing a lot of funny
things that I'd seen other comedians in other features do,'' Cosby
said. ``It was only later that all those things I saw him doing
were things he created, and that the other talents had copied him.''
   The famous assembly-line sequence from an ``I Love Lucy''
episode in which Lucy and Ethel try to keep up with the chocolates
is derived from a similar scene in Chaplin's 1936 ``Modern Times,''
in which an assembly-line worker goes crazy.
   The silent chase scene in Woody Allen's ``Bananas'' is another
Chaplin-inspired bit. The filmmaker once said in an interview that
he admired the way Chaplin used thin plots on which to hang funny
scenes.
   Chaplin could take the simplest human predicament and expand it
into a lifetime. A scene in the old TV series, ``The
Honeymooners,'' finds Ralph and Ed locked up in Ralph's freezing
apartment on a rent strike. They're running out of food and must
eat celery for dinner. Ed (Art Carney) pretends the celery is a
full-course steak dinner, and eats with great flourish. Chaplin did
a similar bit when he devoured his boot in ``The Gold Rush.''
   Chaplin, who died in 1977 following a stroke, was born in
Lambeth, a ghetto in the south of London. The son of music hall
performers, his early years were difficult. His parents, Charles
and Hannah, were separated by 1892; his father rarely made child
support payments, forcing Charlie and his older brother, Sydney, to
spend time in a local orphanage. Charlie was close to his mother,
but she was mentally unstable and drifted in and out of nursing
homes.
   ``I don't think he ever lost that thing about poverty,''
recalled Jerry Epstein, a longtime friend whose book ``Remembering
Charlie'' has recently been released. ``That haunts you, one day
you wake up and it's all gone. That's a living nightmare. He once
said to me, `What would have happened to me if I never left
England?'''
   Chaplin showed talent as a mime and acrobat and first appeared
on stage when he was 4, singing at a nearby music hall for a wildly
appreciative audience of soldiers who threw money at the young
performer. By 1899, he had become one of the Eight Lancashire Lads,
a traveling group of dancers and comedians.
   In 1908, he became a comic with the celebrated Fred Karno
company, impressing and, at times, alienating peers with his
single-minded devotion to his craft. Chaplin would later punctuate
a creative dispute by insisting, ``This is my work!''
   On a tour of the United States late in 1912, he was spotted by a
talent agent. The following year, he signed a one-year contract for
$150 a week with Mack Sennett's Keystone Films, known for slapstick
movies that concluded with spectacular chases.
   Chaplin's first motion picture, ``Making a Living,'' was
released in 1914 to generally favorable reviews, although his
character bore no resemblance to the Tramp. Chaplin, wearing a top
hat, monacle and droopy mustache, portrayed a slicker who tries to
``scoop'' a reporter.
   In his third picture, ``Mabel's Strange Predictament,'' he
unveiled the Tramp, drawing on English music hall costumes. He
contrasted oversized pants and extra long shoes with a shrunken
jacket and battered bowler hat, adding a tiny mustache and walking
cane to give the impression of a man aspiring for status but not
succeeding.
   ``He said the cane was the key to the whole characterization,''
Epstein recalled. ``The minute he found that cane he knew he had
the character. He could attack people with it, he could act like
the gentleman with it.''
   Chaplin gave the Tramp a shuffling, ``splay-footed'' walk that
he picked up by imitating an old man called ``Rummy'' Banks, who
used to hold horses for coachmen outside a neighborhood pub.
   Audiences instantly responded. A Chicago reporter interviewed
Chaplin and commented, ``You can't keep your eyes off his feet.
Those big shoes are buttoned with 50 million eyes.''
   Charlie Chaplin cartoons began appearing in newspapers. Songs
came out _ ``Those Charlie Chaplin Feet,'' ``Charlie Chaplin, the
Funniest of Them All'' and ``The Moon Shines Bright on Charlie
Chaplin.''
   By 1916, Chaplin was with the Mutual Film Corporation, making a
staggering annual salary of $670,000, and critics were starting to
regard his films as more than just entertainment. An article in
Harper's Weekly, ``The Art of Charles Chaplin,'' praised the star
in ways comedians never were. It compared the vulgarity of his
films to the works of Aristophanes and Shakespeare.
   In 1919, Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D.W.
Griffith formed United Artists as a way of independently producing
and financing their own films.
   ``Initially it was great,'' said William Everson, a professor of
cinema studies at New York University. ``None of these people were
getting the full results of their labor. On paper it seemed ideal,
but financially it wasn't feasible.''

   Chaplin began fleshing out his films _ mostly one-reelers _ with
social commentary, relating the hardship faced by Europeans coming
to America in ``The Immigrant,'' and stressing the bonds shared by
warring soldiers in ``Shoulder Arms.''
   His sentimental side emerged even more strongly in his feature
films, starting in 1921 with ``The Kid,'' which depicted the
Tramp's friendship with an abandoned boy, Jackie Coogan.
   The film, Chaplin's first full-length feature, grossed $2{
million, made an instant star out of young Coogan and gave full
display to Chaplin's dramatic range. His next feature, ``The Gold
Rush,'' came out in 1925, and is regarded by Chaplin and many
others as his finest work.
   Inspired by stories of the 1898 gold rush, the movie starred
Chaplin as the Lone Prospector, and contained one of the most
famous sequences in film history, ``The Dance of the Rolls.''
   Chaplin invites an attractive singer and her friends to dinner
on New Year's Eve and enthusiastically prepares the meal. But his
company never shows up and Chaplin falls asleep. He dreams about
entertaining the guests by sticking forks in two dinner rolls and
acting out a puppet-like dance on the table.
   In another immortal segment, he's stranded without food in a
freezing cabin and boils his own boot, consuming the dinner with
considerable relish, even twirling the laces like spaghetti.
   Chaplin often referred to an early love affair that would
forever leave him with the desire to ``reach out for beauty,'' a
yearning he employed to heartbreaking effect in ``The Gold Rush''
and ``The Circus,'' in which the Tramp falls in love with a circus
girl.
   In vain, the Tramp would pursue beautiful, unreachable women,
never more movingly than in ``City Lights,'' in which he befriends
a pretty blind flower girl and convinces her that he is a man of
wealth and distinction.
   As Agee wrote, the Tramp is eventually brought down to painful
reality when he raises the money necessary for the blind girl to
regain her sight:
   ``At the end of `City Lights,' ... (she) sees him for the first
time. She has imagined and anticipated him as princely, to say the
least; and it had never seriously occurred to him that he is
inadequate. She recognizes who he must be by his shy, confident,
shining joy as he comes silently toward her. And he recognizes
himself through the terrible changes in her face.
   ``The camera just exchanges a few quiet close-ups of the
emotions which shift and intensify in each face. It is enough to
shrivel the heart to see, and it is the greatest piece of acting
and the highest moment in movies.''
   Chaplin's peers praised him in similar terms. The great Buster
Keaton repeatedly deferred to his ``rival'' as being in a class by
himself, writing that ``nobody ever made so many people laugh as
did Charlie with his Little Tramp.''
   Although the onset of talking films in the late '20s ruined the
careers of many stars, notably John Gilbert, Chaplin was reluctant
to use sound, complaining that ``dialogue, to my way of thinking,
always slows action, because action must wait upon words.''
   ``Motion pictures need dialogue as much as Beethoven symphonies
need lyrics,'' he once said.
   ``City Lights'' was Chaplin's last silent movie. In 1936, he
released ``Modern Times,'' which had some crude sound effects and
made a star out of Paulette Goddard, the third of his four wives.
   Both movies were box-office hits, as was 1940's ``The Great
Dictator,'' a stinging attack against Hitler, who bore an uncanny
resemblance to the comic. In 1941, his artistic dreams played
second to his personal life. He met and had a brief relationship
with a young actress, Joan Barry. She later accused Chaplin of
fathering her child. Although blood tests backed up his claims that
the baby wasn't his, a California jury said he was, causing
considerable damage to his reputation and paving the way for
right-wing branding of communism.
   With McCarthyism in full and furious throttle, Chaplin, an
outspoken liberal and supporter of the wartime alliance with the
Soviet Union, came under harsh attack. He had lived in California
but had never become a U.S. citizen, considering himself ``a
citizen of the world.''
   When he went to England in the early '50s to film ``Limelight,''
his entry permit was revoked. The man who had embodied the American
Dream, working his way from music hall performer to international
celebrity, lived his final years in Vevey, Switzerland.
   ``I never saw him depressed,'' Jerry Epstein said. ``He loved
America. He would say, `After all, that's where I met Oona.'''
   Oona O'Neill, daughter of the playwright Eugene O'Neill, was 18
when they married. Chaplin was 54.
   ``She devoted her whole life to him,'' Epstein said. ``She knew
how to handle an artist. Oona is completely reserved,
self-effacing; never wanted the career, never wanted the limelight.
She was in love with him her whole life.
   ``She always said, `When I was young he looked after me, now
that he's an old man, it's my turn to look after him.'''
   Their eight children carved their own fame: Geraldine, the
oldest, became an actress who soared to fame in David Lean's 1965
epic, ``Dr. Zhivago.'' Josephine portrayed Hemingway's wife in a TV
miniseries about the writer. Michael played one of the leads in
``King in New York'' when he was 9. All three children had walk-ons
in ``Limelight.''
   Victoria runs a French circus called Le Cirque Imaginaire.
Eugene is a businessman. Jane lives in Florida with Ilya Salkind,
producer of the Superman movies. Annette recently appeared in a
stage production of Sam Shepard's ``Buried Child'' in France.
Christopher, 25, the youngest, appeared in ``Notes From the
Underground'' in London.
   Chaplin also had two children from his second wife, Lita Grey.
Sydney won a Tony playing opposite Judy Holliday in ``Bells Are
Ringing,'' and co-starred with Barbra Streisand in ``Funny Girl''
on Broadway. Charlie Jr. died about 20 years ago.
   After ``Monsieur Verdoux'' flopped in 1947, Chaplin never again
regained his commercial appeal. ``Limelight,'' released in 1952,
contained a memorable musical sequence with Chaplin and Buster
Keaton, but had only moderate success. He made just two more
movies, both poorly received: ``A King in New York,'' and ``A
Countess From Hong Kong,'' a 1967 comedy starring Marlon Brando and
Sophia Loren.
   Chaplin spent the last 10 years of his life collecting honors,
composing new scores for his movies and working on a project, ``The
Freak.'' It was never completed.
   He returned briefly to the United States in 1972 to receive an
``honorary'' Oscar from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp;
Sciences. The Cannes Film Festival had paid tribute to him the year
before, and the Venice Film Festival gave him a special Golden Lion
award. He received knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II in March 1975.
   A fan of the underdog to the end, Chaplin expressed admiration
for Sylvester Stallone's ``Rocky,'' murmuring, ``excellent,
excellent,'' as he watched the movie.
   ``He just took life as it came,'' Epstein said. ``He never spoke
about death. He never spoke about old age. He felt he was still
young. He never lost his sense of curiosity.''

   Few film stars were as internationally acclaimed as Charlie
Chaplin, and the anniversary of his 100th birthday will be
commemorated by those who still cherish his memory and his art with
events around the world.
   ``Charlot's Year'' has begun at the wine-growing village of
Corsier-Sur-Vevey, Switzerland, as it prepares to honor the Little
Tramp with a string of festivities.
   ``Charlot'' is the name French-speaking fans gave the
world-famous comedian, who died on Christmas Day in 1977, after
spending a quarter of a century at Corsier.
   Festivities will officially begin in Vevey, the Lake Geneva town
just below hillside Corsier, on April 16, the day Chaplin was born
in London in 1889.
   Swiss President Jean-Pascal Delamuraz is scheduled to attend a
ceremony naming a ``Square Chaplin,'' which already features an
almost lifesize statue of the Little Tramp, his movie character
with the bowler hat, mustache and walking stick.
   Chaplin, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1975, and his
wife, Oona, often strolled along the nearby lake after buying
English-language newspapers. Most people did not recognize them.
   Jean-Charles Kollros, a spokesman for the ceremony, said Sophia
Loren is expected at the event. She starred in Chaplin's last move
in 1967, ``A Countess From Hong Kong.''
   Kollros also said that Lady Oona is not in good health. She
continues to reside at the Manoir de Ban, the 18th-century manor
above Corsier that Chaplin purchased in 1953.
   After the square-naming ceremony, some 1,000 people, mostly
children, are to march in a festive parade from Vevey to Corsier,
where more celebrations are to take place under a huge circus tent
holding 2,500 people. The tent is set up on ``Place Chaplin,'' a
sprawling meadow between Corsier's 18th-century chateau and the
village hall.
   Meanwhile, in London, the Museum of the Moving Image will
present ``The Worlds of Charlie Chaplin,'' an exhibit of
photographs, documents and artifacts in honor of ``Lambeth's
Favorite Son.'' The National Film Theater is presenting a series of
Chaplin's major works along with movies depicting world events at
the time.
   On his birthday, ``City Lights'' _ the story of a tramp who
befriends a millionaire and falls in love with a blind girl _ will
be shown at London's Dominion Theatre, the site of its original
premiere in 1931. A live orchestra will perform Chaplin's own score
for the silent movie.
   In Hollywood, there will be a special screening and party at the
Chaplin Stage of the former Charles Chaplin Studios. The Walk of
Fame will present a plaque to his son, Sydney, during a ceremony to
rededicate Chaplin's star on Hollywood Boulevard.
   The Museum of Modern Art in New York will present, ``Chaplin: A
Centennial Celebration,'' which includes a gallery exhibit and a
two-week film retrospective.
   In Frankfurt, Germany, the Old Opera House screened ``The
Circus'' _ a 1928 movie about a tramp who takes refuge from the
police in a circus _ and a retrospective of his work will be shown
in Munich. An international conference will held in Paris, during
which Chaplin's daughter, Geraldine, will receive a decoration from
the French Minister of Culture.
   ``A Woman of Paris,'' which Chaplin directed in 1923, will be
screened with ``How to Make Movies'' (an unfinished film he made
around 1918) at the Cinematheque in Portugal. Japanese television
will have a musical tribute on April 16.
   NRK-Radio in Norway will have a 45-minute special, ``Charlie
Chaplin _ The Clown Who Chastised,'' and a program consisting of
his own soundtrack music.
   Key Video will release the Charlie Chaplin Centennial
Collection, including all his commercial films from 1918's ``A
Dog's Life'' through 1957's ``A King in New York.''
   Other events in Switzerland, scheduled between April 16 and May
20, include showings of some of his films, beginning with 1952's
``Limelight,'' a disco dance, a concert featuring music written by
Chaplin and performances by some of Europe's best-known comics.
   A special show opening April 29 and running through the summer
will feature photographs, documents and other exhibits focusing on
the 25 years Chaplin spent in the Vevey region.
   Festivities will wind up with a Chaplin retrospective at the
annual Vevey Festival of Comic Films, launched in 1980 in the
comedian's memory. Organizers plan to screen 51 of Chaplin's movies
in a retrospective.

<HEAD>A White Marble Tombstone Has Replaced the Wooden Cross</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   CORSIER-SUR-VEVEY, Switzerland (AP) _ The plain wooden cross
that marked the burial site before the sensational theft of the
body, was replaced long ago.
   Now there's a white, marble tombstone with the simple
inscription: ``Charles Chaplin, 1889-1977,'' dropping the ``Sir''
to which the world-famous comedian was entitled after being
knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1975.
   Under a bright spring sun, the forget-me-nots and the white and
rose hyacinths seemed freshly planted. Other graves in the Swiss
cemetery were equally well kept, bearing names more familiar in the
village where the reclusive actor never really struck roots.
   ``I am sure their gardner will prepare some special floral
decoration for the anniversary,'' said Etienne Buenzod, a communal
employee who takes care of the cemetery of Corsier, a wine-growing
village overlooking Lake Geneva where Chaplin spent the last 25
years of his life.
   ``I saw some of his films but I saw him in person only once
during these 25 years. He was a very discreet man.''
   So seems his widow, Lady Oona, who still resides in the
Chaplins' Manoir de Ban _ an 18th-century manor just above Corsier
_ but who is rarely seen in the village.
   Corsier was preparing for weeks of festivities marking the 100th
anniversary of Chaplin's birth. He was the village's most famous
resident and, posthumously, put its name on front pages worldwide
when two would-be extortionists snatched his body.
   Buenzod discovered the theft on March 2, 1978, more than two
months after Chaplin died on Christmas Day following a stroke. The
300-pound oak-and-silver coffin with the body inside was recovered
10 weeks later, buried in a cornfield about 10 miles from here.
   News of the bizarre theft spread throughout the world. The
Soviet news agency TASS denounced it as ``typical for the
atmopshere of crime in the inhuman Western world.''
   But a Swiss court took a more lenient view of the two
perpetrators, political refugees from Poland and Bulgaria.
   ``I wanted to get money without harming anyone,'' testified
Roman Wardas, the theft's bungling Polish mastermind, who was
arrested when he ran out of coins at a public phone during ransom
negotiations with the Chaplins' family lawyer.
   The two also had to dig up the coffin for a second time because
they had forgotten to take photographs to prove they were holding
it. Lady Oona, according to the lawyer, categorically rejected
ransom demands, lowered gradually from $600,000 to $100,000, saying
her husband was ``in heaven and in my heart.''
   Wardas was sentenced to 4{ years in prison, but freed after
three years because of good conduct.

   Karen Kocharian, a dark-haired, doe-eyed boy who
suffered a crushed hand when last December's earthquake in Armenia
collapsed his school, has spent the last two months in
Philadelphia, undergoing reconstructive surgery. As he awaits two
more operations to give him operable fingers, he absorbs American
culture. This is the third report in an intermittent series
tracking Karen's progress. The story is by Associated Press
reporter Bruce Rule, with LaserPhotos by Photographer Amy Sancetta.

   When Karen Kocharian arrived here two months
ago for treatment of injuries suffered in December's Armenian
earthquake, he was a 9-year-od in a gray suit who talked about
soccer and chess. Now it's blue jeans and sneakers, video games and
Pee Wee Herman.
   Karen, now 10, is one of 37 Armenian children to be treated at
10 American hospitals under a program sponsored by Project Hope.
Four of the children, including Karen, are being treated at
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
   Karen lost his right eye and the fingers on his right hand when
his grade school collapsed in the Dec. 7 quake, which left
thousands of his countrymen dead, injured or homeless. Soviet
doctors gave him a glass eye before he left for the United States.
   Although overwhelmed with curiosity when he first arrived, he
waited to ask questions until he was alone with Annadid Ohanian,
whose family is host to Karen and Karen's father, Sarkis. And he
kept his bandaged, maimed hand in his suit pocket.
   Finally, fascination with that most American of love objects,
the automobile, pulled Karen out of his shell.
   Within days of arriving in February, he had seen Camaros,
Porsches and Cadillacs. With a toy camera from the Ohanians, he
shot two rolls of film, photographing the Ohanian family cars, a
Corvette, two Fieros and a Trans Am, from every angle.
   ``When we go back,'' he told his father firmly, ``I don't want
to ride in our afto mekana,'' a nondescript Russian-made car.
   ``I will build my own car,'' he said, planning to work as an
auto mechanic like his father.
   His father, Sarkis, also has changed.
   At first quiet and reserved, he is quicker to chat with
American-Armenians who visit. ``How do you do?'' he says in English
to other visitors.
   Sarkis, a stocky, 34-year-old with specks of gray in his hair,
also has become more vocal about what he sees as shortcomings in
the Soviet system.
   When the Ohanians first brought Sarkis to their small variety
store in west Philadelphia, he was amazed at the number of
available items.
   ``He asked, `Why can't we have this back home?''' George Ohanian
said.
   Recently, a Tass reporter called from New York City.
   Sarkis answered questions with questions, smiling and winking at
the other Armenians present.
   ``Who is going to pay for all this?'' he was asked.
   ``Don't you know?'' he replied, adding, ``Not your country.
Project Hope will. And my countrymen will.''
   Later, Sarkis said he was angry because the Soviets have placed
severe restrictions on what he and Karen can bring back to Armenia.
   Project Hope has been giving the children's guardians $10 a day
toward living expenses. Sarkis has spent most of the money on
Karen; he has bought himself only a white jogging suit.
   Now, he said, he is afraid he will not be able to bring back any
of the clothes or toys Karen has received as presents since
arriving here.
   Ohanian said the Soviets have an official list of what may be
brought into the country. It specifies only one of each item: one
pair of pants, one shirt, one toy and so on.
   Sarkis has not yet told Karen, who continues to play with the
Matchbox cars and other toys he's received from well-wishers in
places from Northborough, Mass., to Tustin, Calif.
   Last month, two of Karen's toes were transplanted to his right
hand so he would have fingers. The operation was not wholly
successful and circulation problems developed, so doctors sewed
Karen's new fingers into a skin flap on his stomach to help with
the healing.
   The doctors say Karen needs two more operations to build the
toes into complete fingers.
   Naturally right-handed, the boy takes therapy to strengthen his
left-handed abilities. He plays magnetized pick-up sticks, bounces
basketballs and writes letters for his physical therapist, Dore
DiBerardino.
   Most days are spent at the Ohanians' store. Karen answers the
telephone with a bright greeting, ``Armenian Touch.''
   For lunch everyday, he orders his favorite American sandwich _
corned beef on rye, hold the cheese. When he talks, English words
pop into his conversation.
   At the Ohanians' suburban West Chester home, Karen steers a
riding mower around the backyard with his left hand, wrenching the
wheel back and forth.
   Recently, he and his father were watching an Armenian-language
video, ``Baghdassar Akhbar.'' Karen laughed occasionally at the
family comedy, but his eyes brightened when Sarkis switched to
``Pee Wee Herman's Big Adventure'' on cable television.
   Karen laughed at every visual gag, hugging his stomach. When Pee
Wee's motorcycle hit a billboard, the boy screamed in English,
``Oh, my god,'' and fell back laughing.
   For himself, Sarkis admits to enjoying Sylvester Stallone's
``Rambo'' and ``Rocky'' movies.
   ``They are much different now,'' said Ohanian, an Armenian
immigrant who is housing the Kocharians because he wanted to help
``the children who are Armenian's future.''
   ``They have come here to get medical treatment,'' he said,
tousling Karen's hair. ``But we're sending them back American
rebels.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Winter People''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the most interesting films of 1988 stemmed from novels:
``Dangerous Liaisons,'' ``The Accidental Tourist,'' ``Little
Dorrit,'' ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' ``The Unbearable
Lightness of Being,'' ``Pelle the Conqueror.''
   While original screenplays remain the most prevalent source of
films, it is heartening to see the comeback of novels.
   Why so? Because from ``The Birth of a Nation'' to ``Gone With
the Wind'' to ``Terms of Endearment,'' novels have lent film
entertainment a substance that is often lacking on a diet of
scripts originated by screenwriters and homogenized by countless
rewrites.
   ``Winter People'' is the latest evidence. Adapted by Carol
Sobieski from John Ehle's novel, the film has faults and excesses.
But it also offers a certain majesty and an accurate sense of time
and place _ the Blue Ridge Mountains in the Depression 1930s.
   Wayland Jackson (Kurt Russell) is a watchmaker who is driving
his motherless daughter (Amelia Burnette) to Philadelphia to start
a new life. When their pickup truck is wrecked in a mountain
stream, they take refuge with a mysterious woman (Kelly McGillis),
who lives in a remote cabin with her fatherless baby boy.
   The mystery unravels. McGillis has been ostracized by her
family, the Wrights, who are the leading citizens of a nearby
village. The father of her child is the unruly son (Jeffrey Meek)
of the lawless Campbell clan, longtime enemies of the Wrights.
   Russell wins the young mother's confidence and love, and the
respect of her family _ after proving his manhood on a bear hunt.
When the father of McGillis' son dies mysteriously, the
long-smoldering feud between the Wrights and the Campbells erupts
in violence.
   Director Ted Kotcheff manages to keep the complicated plot
running smoothly, though at times the mountain dialect is hard to
comprehend. Kelly McGillis gives understated strength to her role,
and Kurt Russell has his strongest characterization to date, though
the transition from milquetoast to macho man is less than smooth.
   Lloyd Nolan and Mitchell Ryan are powerful as patriarchs of the
two families. As the violent Campbell, Jeffrey Meek is terrifying.
The mountain scenery have been stunningly photographed by Francois
Protat.
   ``Winter People'' was produced by Robert H. Solo for Columbia
Pictures. Scariness and sexual tension give it a PG-13 rating.
Running time: 115 minutes.

   A midnight Tuesday deadline to complete
agreements to sell Eastern Airlines to ex-baseball commissioner
Peter V. Ueberroth passed without the parties reaching a deal, but
the judge overseeing the talks ordered all sides to return to his
courtroom today.
   It remained unclear whether the parties had agreed to extend the
deadline, which was imposed by Ueberroth and Texas Air Corp.,
Eastern's parent company. None of those involved would comment
immediately.
   Although a group led by Ueberroth has agreed with Eastern union
leaders on labor concessions necessary to complete the $464 million
buyout, sources said remaining obstacles included resistance by
Texas Air to demands that include the naming of a special trustee
to run the airline.

   A House banking panel voted to gut the key
reform of the Bush administration's savings and loan proposal, but
then rolled back in several follow-up votes on some of the changes
that most weakened the plan.
   By a 24-23 vote Tuesday, the House Banking subcommittee on
financial institutions diluted a requirement to force S&amp;L owners to
back loans with more of their own capital.
   Then, the subcommittee partly retightened the definition of
capital regarding subordinated debt and deferred loan losses.

   A House panel approved legislation to end 35
years of federal control of natural gas prices, a step cheered by
the energy industry but criticized by some consumer groups even
though decontrol could mean slightly cheaper gas for consumers.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee, on a voice vote Tuesday
without dissent, sent the measure to the full House, where even its
strongest critics say approval is likely. A similar measure has
been introduced but not yet act on in the Senate.

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gannett Co. Inc. wasn't amused by a bank's
annual report that resembles the media company's USA Today
newspaper, and has asked for an apology.
   Gannett said Tuesday it has asked Goldome, one of the nation's
leading thrift institutions, to publicly apologize for using a
likeness of the paper. ``No organization with Goldome's visibility
has ever appropriated our format in such a large way,'' said Sheila
Gibbons, a USA Today spokeswoman at Gannett headquarters in
Arlington, Va.
   USA Today also wants Goldome to send letters to its shareholders
and news organizations explaining that the bank's use of the
likeness was unauthorized.
   In addition, USA Today wants the bank to include a similar
notice on any copies of the report distributed in the future, she
said.
   Ms. Gibbons said Buffalo-based Goldome already indicated it
would apologize.
   But Goldome spokesman Marc Chodorow said lawyers for the two
companies were still discussing the situation and ``we're hopeful
that there will be a resolution of the problem soon.''
   ``In no way did we intend to cause confusion or do a disservice
to USA Today,'' he said.
   Chodorow said earlier that the bank considered the design of its
annual report to be its own.
   Goldome lost $119 million last year and is having difficulty
meeting regulatory requirements. The bank has also made major
management changes.
   A banner headline in the annual report read ``Goldome Posts
Loss, Writes Down Real Estate.''
   The lead story detailed the bank's restructuring program, which
includes divestitures and writedowns of non-performing assets.
Inside, the report included stories from wire services and business
publications on the problems confronting the thrift industry.
   The report included colorful graphics and photos in a layout
style that made it look like a copy of USA Today.
   Goldome said it saved about $1.25 per copy in printing costs by
using newspaper presses and newsprint for the annual report instead
of putting it out in the usual booklet format on glossy paper. The
company printed about 50,000 copies.
   Goldome, with assets of $15 billion, has operations in two dozen
states.

<HEAD>Judge Drops One Count, Refuses to Move Bilzerian Securities Trial
to Florida</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has dismissed one of 12 felony
counts against Singer Co. chairman and corporate takeover
specialist Paul Bilzerian but refused to shift the securities fraud
trial to Florida.
   Bilzerian, 38, is accused of violating securities and tax laws,
conspiracy and making false statements in connection with four
failed takeover transactions in 1985 and 1986.
   U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward on Tuesday dismissed one
count of making false disclosure statements in a transaction with
Armco Inc. One felony count remains connected to that deal.
   The defense had asked Ward to dismiss all charges against
Bilzerian, who has denied the government's claims.
   Ward also denied a request to move the trial to federal court in
Tampa, Fla., where Bilzerian lives.
   Ward said he expects the trial, scheduled to begin May 1, to
last four to six weeks.
   The government contends Bilzerian made millions of dollars by
accumulating stock in takeover targets _ specifically, Hammermill
Paper Co., H.H. Robertson Co., Cluett Peabody &amp; Co. _ concealing
ownership of the stocks in secret accounts and then selling his
holdings after the stock price had risen.
   None of the charges involve Bilzerian's $1.06 billion takeover
of Singer, a defense contractor he acquired last year after a
lengthy struggle.
   Much of the government's case is derived from information
supplied to the government by Los Angeles broker Boyd L. Jefferies,
who has admitted to two felonies for violating federal securities
laws.
   Jefferies also supplied information for the government's stock
manipulation case against GAF Corp., which ended in a second
mistrial last month.
   Bilzerian faces a maximum penalty of five years in jail and a
$250,000 fine on each count.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered C.H.
Butcher Jr. and others to pay $19.3 million in damages for a plot
to hide the bankrupt financier's wealth when his banking empire
collapsed.
   U.S. District Judge R. Allan Edgar awarded the damages Tuesday
to bankruptcy trustee David Martin to pay creditors in the last
major civil lawsuit against Butcher.
   A federal jury in Knoxville last month found that C.H. Butcher
Sr. and two disbarred Atlanta lawyers conspired to help the younger
Butcher keep some of his wealth.
   The jury found the senior Butcher, Robert L. Schwind and David
L. Hill guilty under the Racketeering Influenced Corrupt
Organizations Act following a four-day trial.
   C.H. Butcher Jr. and his brother, 1978 Tennessee Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Jake Butcher, were convicted in connection
with the 1983 failure of their twin banking empires, Southern
Industrial Banking Corp. and United American Bank chain.
   Testimony included assertions that Hill received $1.6 million
from Butcher Jr. to buy gold bars and coins after the financier had
declared bankruptcy.
   Martin has been trying to locate the $1.6 million and documents
produced at the trial showed that Hill was the last person known to
have handled it.
   Hill was not present at the trial. He and Schwind, his former
law partner, were disbarred after their money-laundering
convictions in an unrelated case.
   The jury awarded damages of $245,437 from Butcher Sr., $474,288
from Schwind and $1.63 million from Hill. Under a RICO provision
tripling that amount, the total jury award was $7,049,176.
   But Edgar found that Schwind and Hill were liable for $4,889,999
after the damages were tripled, while Butcher Jr. was responsible
for $11,276,250 individually and $2,422,583 with his wife, Shirley.
   The suit initially sought $126 million in damages from a dozen
defendants. But after a series of out-of-court settlements, it
changed the damages sought to $8 million from five defendants.

<HEAD>Time Exec Says Company Will Be Active In Cable, Defends Merger Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Inc. intends to become a major player in
basic cable television programming, says the media giant's
chairman, who also took a few jabs at broadcasters who have tried
to belittle the medium.
   In a speech Tuesday to cable executives and advertisers,
Chairman J. Richard Munro also defended Time's planned $15 billion
merger with Warner Communications Inc. against criticism from those
he called the ``lords of leverage'' and domestic rivals that he
said were suffering ``merger envy.''
   The deal is subject to review by federal regulators and approval
by the shareholders of both companies. The Justice Department
recently announced it will not oppose the merger.
   Time is only indirectly involved in basic cable programming _
those channels cable subscribers automatically receive _ through
investments in companies such as Turner Broadcasting System Inc.,
which operates the Cable News Network and other basic cable
services.
   Time's Home Box Office Inc. subsidiary owns two premium cable TV
services, HBO and Cinemax, for which cable subscribers pay an
additional fee over their monthly charge. There have been published
reports that HBO is considering launching a comedy cable network.
   While Munro did not specifically address those reports in his
talk to the Cabletelevsion Advertising Bureau's annual conference,
he said, ``Our goal in basic (cable) is to develop a high-quality,
well-defined, differentiated service with the audience appeal of
HBO and the channel identification of CNN.''
   He noted that some critics have described the basic cable
audience as ``underpaid, overaged, out of touch.''
   But Munro said cable has changed television from a passive
medium with three main viewing choices into a responsive medium
``able to appeal to a far broader range of tastes and interests
than before.''
   He said some broadcasting executives have responded by refusing
to acknowledge the changes that have occurred in viewing habits.
   Time recognizes the networks' dilemma, Munro said, because it
faced the same situation in magazines in the late 1970s, when
regional and specialized magazines began attracting bigger
increases in ad spending than Time's mass market magazines were
seeing.
   Munro said Time faced up to market realities and built itself
into the nation's largest regional publisher.
   ``I don't want to sound like I'm making a blanket attack on
broadcast. I'm not,'' he said. He said there are a lot of ``smart
people at the networks'' who know the value and potential of cable
and are trying to get in on it.
   The National Broadcasting Co., for instance, launches a business
network on basic cable next week.
   Regarding the merger plan with Warner, Munro repeated the
dealmakers' assertions that the pact would guarantee an American
company will be among the few global giants expected to dominate
the communications business by the mid-1990s.
   He said some of Time's and Warner's domestic competitors don't
like the deal. Munro called it a ``chronic case of merger envy.''
   ``My advice to them is to save their energy to invest in finding
the kind of match that will help keep them competitive in global
markets,'' he said.
   Munro also chided ``the lords of leverage,'' who he said ``hate
the deal because it builds a new company instead of breaking up two
existing ones.''
   ``To put it politely, I think their expressed concern that
shareholders are being shortchanged by this deal resembles nothing
so much as the cat worrying about the good health of the canary,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   Mexico has signed an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund under which Mexico will receive up to
$3.65 billion over three years to help reduce payments on its $107
billion debt, the treasury secretary announced Tuesday.
   The goal is to reduce the net outflow of funds to provide the
investment money needed to spur growth and reduce the debt.
   Significantly, the accord stipulates that the IMF supports
Mexico's current economic austerity and modernization programs and
requires no additional austerity measures, Treasury Secretary Pedro
Aspe said.
   That means that the IMF will not require any further
devaluations of the Mexican peso, as has been called for in
previous agreements in an effort to stimulate exports, an official
said on condition of anonymity.
   ``The agreement reached with the IMF constitutes a plain
endorsement of the economic strategy of Mexico,'' Aspe said. ``The
fund has completely subscribed to this strategy.''
   The treasury chief also announced Mexico will conclude ``in the
next several days'' an agreement with the World Bank for $1.5
billion in credits to support the government's restructuring
programs.
   Aspe said the IMF agreement will promote Mexico's efforts to
reach restructuring agreements with creditor government banks.
Tuesday's accord may be extended for a fourth year at Mexico's
request.
   On April 19, Mexico will formally present to creditor banks its
proposals to reduce the foreign debt's value, cut servicing and
obtain additional lending over several years, Aspe said.
   The loan amount is $2.79 billion in Special Drawing Rights, a
denomination used by the IMF and also known as ``paper gold.'' SDRs
are a measure of a nation's reserve assets in the international
monetary system, and their value is based on an amalgam of major
currencies.
   The value in this case is $1.30 for every dollar in the reserve
assets, making the total loan worth about $3.6 billion.
   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who took office
Dec. 1, has pressed efforts to cut the outflow of capital needed to
revitalize Mexico's stagnant economy. Economic growth was nil last
year.
   Salinas has sought to reduce foreign debt servicing, which will
cost about $16 billion this year, and to obtain $7 billion through
lower payments and new loans each year for the next six years.

<HEAD>Wendy's Offers Money-Back Guarantee In Taste Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEITH ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wendy's International Inc. is putting its
money where its mouth is by offering customers a refund if they
don't think they've tasted the best hamburger in the business.
   The promise is part of a six-week advertising campaign in which
Wendy's, one of the nation's largest fast-food chains, proclaims
itself the winner in a taste contest with industry leader
McDonald's Corp. The ad campaign started Monday and ends in mid-May.
   Charles W. Rath, executive vice president of marketing, said the
suburban Dublin-based company favors the taste-test over a campaign
emphasizing discounts.
   ``The problem I have with discounts is that if you lower the
price, then it must have only been worth that much in the first
place,'' Rath said in an interview Tuesday. ``We've got a product
that we have a lot of confidence in its worth and its value to the
consumer. Nobody's done this before.''
   The money-back guarantee is in addition to the company's policy
of refunding money to dissatisfied customers. Under the special
offer, the company will refund the price of the hamburger to
customers who do not agree that the one they just ate was the best
in the burger business.
   Rath said the company did not estimate how much the special
refunds would cost the company.
   ``We don't think we're going to lose any more than we would on a
legitimate complaint of a product that doesn't meet our
standards,'' he said.
   Industry analyst Malcolm Knapp of the New-York based marketing
research company Malcolm Knapp Inc. called the promotion ``a great
proposition.'' He said Wendy's came out No. 1 in a taste test this
year in Restaurant and Institutions magazine.
   Knapp said the strategy will cost the company less money than
such promotions as couponing or discounts.
   ``Couponing always gives away products, for sure. And if you do
discounting, you're giving away money,'' he said.
   Knapp also said the campaign will bring more people into Wendy's
restaurants. Wendy's is virtually tied for third with Hardee's Food
Systems Inc. in size among national fast-food chains. Burger King,
a division of Pillsbury Co., is second.
   Wendy's spokesman Denny Lynch said the refund strategy was
tested in eight markets last year. ``It was never a problem,'' he
said.
   He said customers trying to abuse the offer likely will be
discovered because patrons tend to return to the same restaurant.
He also said only a few people would try to get refunds by going to
several restaurants.
   ``Is it worth it to do that for $1.39? I don't think so,'' Lynch
said.
   The advertising campaign includes a claim of taste superiority
over McDonald's.
   Wendy's contends customers surveyed at random in 1987 and 1988
preferred Wendy's hamburgers by a 2-1 ratio over those offered by
McDonald's. Rath said the company hired C.J. Research of Chicago to
conduct the surveys. About 1,500 consumers were interviewed
quarterly.
   McDonald's spokesman John Onoda was not available for comment
Tuesday and did not return a call seeking comment.
   Wendy's, with about 3,750 restaurants nationwide, has annual
sales of nearly $3 billion. It earned $28.5 million last year,
continuing to rebound from 1986, when it lost $4.9 million. The
company made $4.5 million in 1987.

   The status of Peter V. Ueberroth's deal to buy
strikebound Eastern Airlines from Texas Air Corp. remained in doubt
when a Tuesday midnight deadline passed without a final agreement.
   Ueberroth met with Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo at U.S.
Bankruptcy Court Tuesday evening. At 9:15 p.m., the meeting broke
up and the two hastily walked out of the courthouse. Ueberroth said
he did not know what would happen next.
   Lawyers for Eastern's unions remained until 11:30 p.m., when
Judge Burton R. Lifland told them to return to his chambers for a
conference at 8:30 a.m. Wednesday. Ueberroth's agreement to buy
Eastern from Lorenzo expired at 12:01 a.m. under an agreement
between the two sides.
   Asked about the midnight deadline, Lifland said: ``It's not my
deadline. There was an earlier deadline for certain things that I
said, and it was met.'' He declined further comment.
   The Machinist union members, pilots and flight attendants
reached five-year contracts with Ueberroth on Monday. But the the
agreements are contingent on a trustee operating the airline until
it comes out of bankruptcy, the negotiators said.
   Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection on March 9, five days
after the strike by Machinist union members began. The pilots and
flight attendants honored the Machinist picket lines, crippling the
airline. Jack Bavis, head of the Eastern pilots, said the unions'
would not go back to work with Lorenzo in interim control.
   ``They're not going to do it for the guy they hate the most,''
he said. ``They'll do it for Peter. If he's there, we're there.''
   Several lawyers involved said they expected that if a trustee is
named, it would be former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, who was
present for the meeting on Monday. Carlucci declined to identify
his role then and was not present Tuesday.
   Lorenzo, according to several sources, refused to go along with
appointing a trustee, throwing the whole deal into doubt.
   ``They went ballistic,'' a source said Tuesday, describing
Lorenzo's lawyers' reaction.
   By the end of the night, no one was knew what would happen next.
   ``I don't think any one person has the whole picture,'' said
James L. Linsey, a lawyer for the pilots.
   The day began with the parties meeting at a Manahattan hotel and
as the day wore on, the lawyers and principals return to court, the
site of Monday's talks.
   Ueberroth and his partner, J. Thomas Talbot, arrived in late
afternoon, Lorenzo in the early evening.
   Dozen of lawyers filled the marble hallways of the
turn-of-the-century courthouse as a series of meeting again
unfolded. Tension built and at several times shouting could be
overheard in the halls.
   The climactic meeting ended at 9:15 p.m. Ueberroth, Talbot,
Lorenzo and Eastern President Phil Bakes were together in a room
across from Lifland's chambers. When they emerged, they put on
their coats to leave but Lifland summoned them.
   Lorenzo entered the judge's chambers but Ueberroth did not, and
when an aide of the judge asked Ueberroth to join, the former
baseball commissioner said ``I'm not going in,'' and waved his hand
through the air in resignation.
   Lorenzo and his lawyers then walked out. Ueberroth held a
private discussion with Talbot and their lawyers, and then
Ueberrroth's side walked out.
   ``I'm not optimistic,'' Ueberroth said in an elevator as he left.
   The participants described the meetings as a four-way game
between Ueberroth, Lorzeno, the unions and Eastern's creditors. For
the deal to work, all four sides had to be in agreement.
   ``Unless you have all of these constituencies, you don't have a
plan,'' said David Boies, an Eastern lawyer.
   Under their five-year deals with Ueberroth, the three Eastern
unions get 30 percent ownership of the airline in exchange for
about $210 million in concessions.
   But the creditors committee is concerned with the deal. Joel
Zweibel, an lawyer for the committee representing the unsecured
creditors, said the group wanted its financial advisers to review
it.
   ``We have some very serious reservations ... no one has made an
effort to make a showing that Eastern will be viable after this
transaction is consummated,'' Zweibel said.
   One condition of the proposed buyout that has raised concern is
the transfer of $79 million in Eastern assets to Texas Air,
``without equivalent value to Eastern from Texas Air,'' the
committee said in a resoltuion passed Tuesday and given to the
parties.
   The committee also said it was concerned whether there was an
economically viable business plan for the reorganized Eastern and
over the financial structure of the buyout, in which Texas Air
would receive $200 million for its Eastern stock and Eastern would
incur $100 million in new debt.
   Zweibel said the creditors had not received a response from
Lifland to their statement.
   When asked whether the creditors were open to renegotiating the
tentative agreement between Ueberroth and Texas Air, he said,
``Anything can be renegotiated.''
   Meanwhile, a federal judge in Miami said late Tuesday he would
make public his opinion Wednesday at 8`55 a.m. EST whether
Eastern's pilots are striking illegally.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month asked U.S.
District Judge Edward B. Davis to issue an opinion on whether
Eastern's pilots walked off the job in support of striking
Machinists or whether the pilots were actually striking to further
their own contract aims.
   If Davis finds the pilots in violation of the Railway Labor Act,
the appeals court could order the pilots back to work. Such a
ruling could have a major influence on whether Texas Air agrees to
sell Eastern.
   Also, Martin Shugrue, a former president of Texas Air's
Continental Airlines, has been hired as a consultant by Ueberroth,
said a participant in the discussions. The source said Shugrue may
play a major role in running Eastern should Ueberroth succeed with
his bid.
   Under Ueberroth's agreement with the unions, the Machinists
union would give up about $150 million in wage and benefit cuts, a
union source said Tuesday. The figures are smaller for other unions
because after Lorenzo bought Eastern three years ago, the pilots
and flight attendants accepted pay cuts but the Machinists did not.

<HEAD>SmithKline, Beecham Agree To Merger</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The directors of SmithKline Beckman Corp.
and London-based Beecham Group PLC agreed Tuesday to merge into one
of the world's largest drug and health-care-products companies,
according to a published report.
   A formal announcement of the deal is expected Wednesday morning,
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported in Wednesday editions, quoting
unidentified sources familiar with the negotiations.
   SmithKline spokesman Bob Holland would not comment on the report
early Wednesday morning.
   Directors of SmithKline agreed to the merger Tuesday night,
after Beecham's directors had approved it earlier in the day, the
newspaper said.
   The merger is subject to approval by shareholders and government
regulators.
   Beecham and SmithKline have been discussing a merger for months,
but did not disclose the talks publicly until April 2. In a joint
statement then, the companies said that if they agreed on a merger,
the new company would be governed by directors drawn equally from
the boards of SmithKline and Beecham and would be run by managers
from both firms.
   The agreement stipulates that Philadelphia-based SmithKline
would oversee three of the new company's five operating businesses:
pharmaceuticals, clinical laboratories and animal-health care, said
a source quoted by the Inquirer on condition of anonymity.
   The pharmaceutical business would be the new company's largest
operation. It would be run by John F. Chappell, president of
SmithKline's drug division, Smith, Kline &amp; French Laboratories.
   Beecham would run the new company's two other operations:
over-the-counter medications and personal-care products.
   The combined company's chief executive officer would be Robert
P. Bauman, an American who is Beecham's executive chairman.
SmithKline's chairman and chief executive officer, Henry Wendt,
will be an ``active'' chairman of the board of the merged company,
the newspaper reported.
   Wendt, 55, has been SmithKline's chief executive officer since
1982 and its chairman since 1987.
   Sources estimated annual revenues of the new business at
slightly less than $7 billion. SmithKline reported total sales last
year of $4.75 billion, while Beecham's sales exceed $4 billion a
year.
   The merger agreement calls for SmithKline to spin off its
eye-and skin-care business, Allergan Inc., and its 84 percent
interest in Beckman Instruments Co. by distributing the shares to
stockholders. SmithKline last fall sold to the public 16 percent of
the common stock of Beckman.
   Beecham also will divest itself of several businesses not
related to drugs, including cosmetics and fragrances, a source said.
   A source said SmithKline and Beecham stockholders would receive
shares in the new combined company in a distribution that would not
result in a taxable gain for shareholders.
   SmithKline's stock dropped 37{ cents a share Tuesday in trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $64.75. The stock traded
as high as $68.50 last week.
   Beecham stock, traded in the United States as American
depositary receipts, rose 25 cents to $20.37{ a share Tuesday.
   The merger would strengthen Beecham's reputation and
distribution in Japan and the United States _ two vital markets
where SmithKline is strong. SmithKline would gain from Beecham's
expertise in marketing over-the-counter drugs and from several
promising prescription drugs in Beecham's research-and-development
pipeline.

<HEAD>Bill Introduced To SImplify Corporate Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee, has introduced a bill to simplify
the corporate minimum tax.
   Committee aides said no estimate of how the bill would affect
tax collections has been produced, nor is it clear which
industries, if any, would be hurt by the change.
   In a speech to the House, Rostenkowski said Tuesday he is open
to suggestons for changes in the bill. However, he added, ``I will
oppose any attempt to extend the arbitrary book-income preference
beyond its scheduled expiration at the end of this year.''
   The corporate minimum tax is designed to ensure that any firm
with a profit pays some tax, no matter how many deductions are
claimed. A company calculates is liability under the regular
corporate tax, figures the minimum tax and pays the larger figure.
   The 1986 tax overhaul amended the minimum levy to base the tax
in 1987 through 1989 on the concept of book income, a term normally
used in reporting profits to stockholders but not to the IRS. For
years starting in 1990, the law drops the book-income concept and
substitutes one known as ``adjusted current earnings.''
   Rostenkowski's bill would eliminate adusted current earnings as
a separate tax preference. Instead, individual items of earnings
would be treated as separate preferences, eliminating one
complicated set of calculations.

central banks, before Friday's release of several key U.S. economic
indicators, including wholesale prices and the trade deficit for
February.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.23 Japanese yen to a closing 132.85
yen. Later, in London, it eased to 132.80 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's

<TEXT>
   Six people have been indicted on 40 counts of
racketeering, conspiracy, bank fraud and other charges in
connection with the failure of an Orange County savings and loan
institution.
   The indictment, announced Tuesday by U.S. Attorney Robert
Bonner, charged that the chief defendant, Janet Faye McKinzie, 39,
engineered a scheme that diverted more than $16 million from North
American Savings and Loan of Santa Ana.
   The alleged fraud cost taxpayers $120 million, which Bonner said
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. spent to cover insured
deposits.
   The government alleged that Ms. McKinzie, along with her boss,
the late Duayne D. Christensen, devised the massive fraud, which
involved creating phony escrow accounts as well as false billings
for construction expenses.
   Others charged in the indictment were members of construction
firms who cooperated in the scheme, as well as officers of related
corporations and a man from Arkansas who allegedly participated in
the phony escrow scheme.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Nancy Wieben Stock, who is prosecuting
the case, said Christensen was a former dentist who had no prior
experience in finance when he launched North America Savings and
Loan in 1983.
   The thrift was in trouble almost from the outset, she said. It
became the subject of a federal investigation in early 1987.
   On Jan. 16, 1987, the day that federal regulators were due to
arrive and examine the S&amp;L's books, Christensen, 57, died in a
traffic accident. His Jaguar plowed into a stone wall on a freeway
near Newport Beach, Ms. Stock said.
   Bonner noted that a $10 million life insurance policy had been
taken out on Christensen, with McKinzie named as the beneficiary.
   Ms. Stock said that a lengthy investigation by the insurer found
no evidence of suicide, and the $10 million was paid into an
account established to cover some federal losses if Ms. McKinzie is
convicted.
   Others charged in the indictment were: Victoria R. Walker, 46,
of Elk Grove, Calif.; David L. Morgan, 52, of Little Rock, Ark.;
Frederick Youngdahl, 53, of Newport Beach; Armando J. Vasquez, 52,
of Irvine and Thomas C. Clarke, 63, of Vista.

<HEAD>Attorneys Defend Settlement in WPPSS Default Case as Best Possible
Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $750 million settlement in the Washington
Public Power Supply System default case was the best deal that
could be struck, attorneys for a group of bondholders said.
   That appraisal was made Tuesday to U.S. District Judge William
D. Browning at a hearing on how to distribute money from
settlements reached late last year in the $2.25 billion WPPSS
litigation.
   Representatives of a separate class-action suit for some
bondholders argued that no settlement should be approved until
Browning decides individual bondholders' and attorneys' shares in
the settlement.
   They also said the state of Washington should bear more
responsibility for its role in the biggest municipal bond default
in the United States.
   After listening to about two dozen attorneys and other parties
in the case, Browning said he would try to issue a written decision
promptly.
   Defendants in the case, which combined dozens of suits filed
since February 1983, included WPPSS, all 88 utilities that
contracted with the consortium to build two reactors, engineering
firms, Wall Street bond underwriters, utility and WPPSS directors
and Blyth Eastman, an advisory firm.
   In 1983, WPPSS defaulted on bonds it sold to finance
construction of a nuclear power plant at the Hanford nuclear
reservation and another at Satsop, west of Olympia.
   The default was triggered by a Washington state Supreme Court
ruling that the participating utilities lacked the legal power to
sign contracts with WPPSS guaranteeing payment even if no
electricity was generated.
   That ruling left bondholders no option but a fraud suit, Paul
Bernstein, one of the attorneys for bondholders, told Browning.
   Melvyn Weiss, another plaintiffs' attorney, said any fraud case
is difficult enough to prove to a jury, let alone one with the
dozens of contending parties.
   Weiss said he and other attorneys for bondholders felt the most
they could achieve if they won the case was a $1.4 billion
settlement.
   The $750 million settlement was much more likely, ``and it could
well be much less,'' he added.
   Bernstein estimated a settlement now, rather than after years of
litigation would add about $250 million to the value received.
   Al Malanca, attorney for the Washington Public Utility Group,
one of the defendants, said he believed defendants stood an
excellent chance of winning at trial.
   He said that before the series of settlements were struck, there
was absolutely no movement toward agreement and ``these were the
maximum dollars that could have been gotten out of anyone.''
   Camden Hall, an attorney for Seattle, which at $50 million would
pay the largest amount of any defendant, also said he felt there
had been an excellent chance of winning, possibly through summary
judgment.
   Hall said city officials wanted to settle to avoid millions of
dollars in future legal expenses and escape the shadow cast by the
WPPSS default over future bond issues.
   Seattle could afford to settle because the city had insurance,
unlike many defendants, especially tiny public utility districts
which had no money to pay for an adverse ruling.
   Bondholder Arthur Hoffer has led a class-action suit against the
state on behalf of bondholders who believed the state would get off
too cheaply. The state agreed to add $10 million to the settlement
in return for an end to liability.
   Richard Lehman, an adviser to the WPPSS Bond Investors
Association, argued that nearly all of the 600 bondholders who
responded to a questionnaire he sent were opposed to settlements
with the state, Bonneville Power Administration and WPPSS and were
willing to pursue court action to get a better deal.
   Browning told Lehmann many bondholders referred to the
questionnaire in their letters, some apparently believing Browning
could do something to change the settlement so they would get the
full face value.
   ``It is not fair'' to leave that impression and ``let them think
that the (court) system has somehow let them down,'' the judge said.
   BPA wasn't named in the original suit but agreed to pay $35
million to get Chemical Bank, the bondholders' trustee, and
bondholders to abandon efforts to petition Congress to allow a suit
against the federal power-marketing agency.
   WPPSS paid no money in its settlement in exchange for
cooperation from its employees at the trial. Plaintiffs' attorneys
said there wasn't enough money left in WPPSS to pursue.
   Of five reactors being built by WPPSS in the late 1970s, only
one was completed.

<HEAD>Company That Helped Start Workstation Trend To Unveil Revamped Products</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sun Microsystems Inc., the upstart company
that helped launch the desktop computer industry trend toward
high-powered workstations, was unveiling an entire overhaul of its
product line today.
   Some of the new machines, priced from $5,995 to $73,900, boast
sophisticated new graphics and digital sound technologies, higher
speeds and a circuit board that allows full-motion video on a
computer screen.
   Scott McNealy, Sun's president, said in a prepared statement the
revamped line is another step toward bringing more powerful desktop
computers into everyday business and personal use.
   ``Tomorrow, people will be talking to, gesturing at, and even
arguing with these machines,'' he predicted, saying his new
products reflect ``ease-of-use features found, before now, only in
personal computers.''
   Workstations outperform personal computers by offering greater
speed, more memory and better monitors for enhanced graphics
capabilities.
   The star of Sun's new product line is the SPARCstation 1, ``the
most powerful, full-function computer for under $9,000,'' McNealy
claimed. The price does not include disk drives.
   The machine's speed of 12.5 million instructions per second,
MIPS, is about four times the speed of similarly priced high-end
Macintosh from Apple Computer, and more than twice as fast as the
most powerful IBM-compatible personal computers. Previously, the
Sun's fastest RISC machine had a speed of 7 MIPS for $22,000.
   The new machine and the revamped older models are designed to
capture markets other than the traditional technical ones that for
years have relied on machines from Sun and rival Apollo Computer.
The companies control about 50 percent of the workstation market.
   ``This machine is the beginning of Sun getting into the volume
market,'' said Richard Shaffer, editor of Techologic Computer
Letter.
   Anil Gadre, Sun's director of marketing for graphics, predicted
the new products will help the company for the first time sell more
than 100,000 workstations in a single year.
   But Kathleen Hurley, an analyst at the research firm of
Dataquest Inc., said the power and prices of some of the new
products are comparable to others available on the commercial
market.
   Sun is using the SPARC technology, its version of so-called RISC
_ reduced instruction set computing _ in an effort to capture a
significant share of the burgeoning $4 billion workstation market.
By the mid 1990s, the market for the machines is expected to be
about $20 billion annually.
   Sun also plans to unveil during a two-day conference at the San
Francisco Civil Auditorium a library of 500 software packages than
can be run on the new systems.
   Other new products to be announced today include a revamp of the
original Sun-3 workstation line, with the addition of Motorola's
fast 68030 microprocessor chip, three-MIPS machines that will start
at $5,995; a 16-MIPS workstation based on RISC chips starting at
$29,900; and an equally fast SPARC system starting at $40,900 that
is designed to operate as a ``server'' to interact with many
computers on a network.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicago's wealthy Pritzker family apparently is
abandoning a plan to buy Ramada Inc. and choosing instead to enjoy
the profits flowing from the Arizona-based hotelier's restructuring
efforts.
   HCC Corp., a Chicago company headed by Jay A. Pritzker, has
reduced its stake in Ramada to 4.8 percent from the 7.2 percent it
held when it offered last September to buy the company for $10 a
share, or about $368 million.
   Ramada rejected the proposal and embarked on a corporate
restructuring that includes the sale of its hotel and restaurant
businesses and will leave the company with three casinos in Nevada
and one in Atlantic City, N.J.
   Pritzker would not comment Tuesday on the reasons for the stock
sale, which was revealed in an April 5 filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
   John Uphoff, a stock analyst who follows Ramada for Raymond
James &amp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla., speculated that the
Pritzkers simply saw the restructuring as a better deal.
   ``I think that when ... it became clear that the restructuring
would be completed at a price to shareholders 20 percent higher
than the Pritzkers had offered for the company, the Pritzkers
decided they would be better served by taking their profits and
letting management restructure the company,'' Uphoff said.
   He said HCC probably began buying Ramada stock at $4 to $6 a
share. The stock's price has risen from about $9 a share to nearly
$12 since the company announced its restructuring plan.
   Ramada closed Tuesday at $11.75 a share, unchanged from Monday's
close.
   HCC said in its SEC filing that it had sold 959,100 shares of
Ramada stock from March 16 through April 5 at an average price of
$11.29 a share.
   The sale leaves the Pritzkers, owners of the Hyatt hotel chain
and the industrial conglomerate Marmon Group Inc., with just under
1.9 million shares of Ramada, according to the SEC filing.
   Ramada's restructuring involves the sale of its 825 hotels and
Marie Callender's Pie Shops Inc., which it acquired in 1986.
   Ramada has already agreed to sell the restaurant business to the
Wilshire Restaurant Group Inc., a group of private investors from
New York, and expects to announce the sale of its hotel group by
mid-year, said spokesman Joe Cole from company headquarters in
Phoenix, Ariz.
   ``We haven't heard from the Pritzkers since last October so I
don't think we have any comment on what they've just done,'' Cole
said.
   Ramada will retain its hotel-casino operations: the Tropicana
resort-casino in Las Vegas, Nev.; the newly remodeled TropWorld
resort-casino in Atlantic City, N.J.; the Ramada Express
hotel-casino in Laughlin, Nev.; and Eddie's Fabulous '50s Casino in
Reno, Nev.
   Ramada reported a net loss of $5.1 million for 1988 on revenue
of $476.6 million. The hotel and restaurant operations showed a net
loss of $3.9 million for the year.

   Sony has been the primary supplier of video and audio components
to Trans Com.
   Sony USA is a unit of the Japanese electronics company Sony Corp.
   Sundstrand, maker of technology-based items for the aerospace

   NCNB Corp. has vowed to keep alive its $2.4
billion bid for Citizens &amp; Southern Corp. even though the Atlanta
banking company has rejected the offer and steadfastly refused to
negotiate.
   ``NCNB will proceed with its merger proposal,'' NCNB Chairman
Hugh L. McColl Jr. said in a statement Tuesday. ``It is time for
C&amp;S to stop posturing. The C&amp;S board should promptly begin
negotiations with us.''
   Citizens' board of directors last week rejected as inadequate
the stock-swap propsal by Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB and said it
had no plans to discuss the offer further.
   Citizens repeated its concerns about the bid in a lengthy
statement issued Tuesday. It speculated the deal would face
numerous legal and regulatory obstacles, primarily because of
NCNB's holdings in Texas.
   NCNB took over the management of the banks of the First
RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas last year as part of a government
bailout. That bank is now called NCNB Texas National Bank.
   On Monday, Georgia Banking Commissioner Jack Dunn said the
regulatory issues involved in the deal could stretch the review
process up to 18 months.
   ``NCNB must now recognize the severe disruption and enormous
cost to both institutions that could accompany a continuation of
the NCNB bid,'' Citizens said.
   Industry analysts took note of the aggressive tone of both NCNB
and Citizens this week.
   ``They (Citizens) took the gloves off,'' said Thomas K. Brown,
an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York. ``The
only mistake they could make is to not be aggressive enough and
look bad and regret it later.''
   But Brown added, ``I don't expect NCNB will just walk away from
it. They'll bring out their lawyers' opinions to show where they
believe C&amp;S is wrong.''
   NCNB is offering 1.075 of its shares for each of Citizens'
stock, or around $40 a share. The company has hinted it might be
willing to raise its bid by around $5 a share if Citizens agrees to
negotiations.
   The combination of the two would result in a bank with assets of
around $75 billion, placing it firmly in the top 10 among the
nation's bank holding companies.

   R.P. Scherer Corp., whose president stepped
down in a family battle over whether to sell the company, is asking
prospective buyers to submit their bids.
   Scherer, a maker of soft gelatin capsules and other
drug-delivery systems, has been helping a number of potential

company's new president and chief executive officer said in a
letter to shareholders mailed Tuesday.
   ``We anticipate that a final agreement of sale should be

   Scherer secretary and board member Theodore Souris declined
comment on the number or identity of possible buyers, or whether
Quantum Corp., formed by former Scherer president Peter R. Fink,
was among them.
   Fink, who has said he would try to buy Scherer, did not

   The Scherer board voted Sept. 30 to consider selling the company
after a battle between Fink and his estranged wife, Karla Fink,
daughter of the company's founder.
   With her brother, John S. Scherer, Karla Fink controls about 38
percent of the company. They led a group favoring sale that seated
two directors in an Aug. 17 proxy vote.
   Peter Fink stepped down as president Nov. 10.
   Scherer has 22 facilities in 13 countries and employs about

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fujitsu Ltd., a leading Japanese computer maker,
announced Wednesday it will build a $682 million semiconductor
manufacturing plant in Britain.
   The announcement said the plant's first stage will be built in
northern England by summer 1990.
   It said Fujitsu will produce one-megabit and four-megabit
dynamic random access memory chips and application specific
integrated circuits beginning in late 1990.
   A Fujitsu official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
declined to discuss the production capacity of the plant, which is

<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines has asked a federal judge
to prevent Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis from meddling with
its unions while Davis, who is seeking to buy the nation's
fourth-largest airline, filed a separate lawsuit seeking to
invalidate the company's ``poison pill'' takeover defense.
   Davis, who has offered to buy Northwest's parent, NWA Inc., for
$2.62 billion or $90 a share, said the airline's litigation is
without merit and infringes on workers' rights to ``to satisfy
themselves as to the plans and intentions of a new owner.''
   Davis, an oilman with interests in real estate and
entertainment, also said he planned a shareholder proxy fight to
win control of the airline's board at the company's May 15
shareholders meeting.
   No hearing date was immediately set on Davis' suit, filed
Tuesday in Delaware Court of Chancery. NWA is based Eagan, Minn.
and incorporated in Delaware.
   Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge Harry MacLauglin in St. Paul set
a hearing for Thursday to consider Northwest's request for an
injunction against Davis to prevent him from negotiating with the
carrier's pilots and other union workers.
   Northwest's suit, also filed Tuesday, contended Davis and his
partnership were illegally interfering with the companies'
relations with Northwest labor unions.
   The suit claimed Davis is trying to block completion of a
collective bargaining agreement being negotiated between Northwest
and its 5,000-member pilots' union.
   The suit said Davis contacted the Air Line Pilots Association on
April 4, the day after he announced his takeover bid in a letter to
the board of directors of NWA.
   Davis also has talked to the leader of the International
Association of Machinists District Lodge 143, which recently agreed
to recommend adoption of a proposed new contract for 10,500
clerical workers at Northwest, the lawsuit said.
   In addition, Davis had talked with the leader of the Teamsters
union, which represents Northwest's 6,500 flight attendents.
   The Northwest suit says Davis and NWA Co., the partnership he
controls, ``are seeking to have the unions negotiate with them, to
usurp Northwest's contractual and statutory role and thereby to
interfere with and disrupt Northwest's prospective and existing
contractual and labor relations with its principal unions.''
   Last Friday, NWA's board of directors rejected Davis' offer,
calling it inadequate. The board also reaffirmed its intention to
maintain the nation's fourth-largest airline as an independent
entity.
   Kevin Whalen, a spokesman for Northwest, said Tuesday the
airline would not comment on Davis' suit ``at least until we study
the complaint.''
   Davis, meanwhile, called the Northwest action ``entirely without
merit.''
   Northwest's board approved the poison pill March 27, saying it
wanted to make the company less attractive to a hostile suitor
intending to break up the company.
   The plan would take effect when a person or group acquires 15
percent of NWA's common stock or announces a tender offer that
would result in ownership of 15 percent or more of the voting power
of NWA stock.
   The plan would allow the company to double the number of
existing shares and offer them to shareholders other than the
acquirer at half the market price, said Northwest spokesman Bob
Gibbons.
   The effect would be to require a hostile bidder to buy twice as
many shares to gain control of the company, making the bid twice as
expensive.
   Davis complained in his suit that the plan would improperly
interfere with the solicitation of proxies he expected to conduct
in advance of the May 15 shareholders meeting.
   He is seeking an order to temporarily restrain NWA from
distributing special stock-buying rights to shareholders under the
pill.
   Davis owns 3 percent of NWA's stock. Shortly before he made his
offer, Northwest announced that a separate group of investors was
interested in buying NWA. The identity of that group, which owns
4.9 percent of the stock, has not been disclosed.

   Grain and soybean futures traded modestly higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade following an Agriculture
Department report that indicated a higher-than-expected rate of
grain usage.
   In the report, released after the close of trading on Tuesday,
the USDA issued new year-end stockpile estimates for wheat, corn
and soybeans. All the numbers fell below expectations.
   The USDA put the U.S. corn stockpile at the beginning of the new
corn marketing year this coming Sept. 1 at 1.83 billion bushels.
   The agency pegged the U.S. wheat stockpile on June 1 at 549
million bushels and estimated the soybean carryover on Sept. 1, the
beginning of the soybean marketing year, at 145 million bushels.
   A 2-day-old dockworkers strike in Brazil is lending additional
support to the soybean market. Brazil is the world's second-largest
soybean producer after the United States.
   In early trading, wheat was 2 cents to 4{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.03 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to
2 cents higher with May at $2.66{ a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to

   A House banking panel today amended President
Bush's savings and loan plan to encourage institutions to
concentrate on housing lending, but even supporters of the change
acknowledged it was worded in a way that could allow S&amp;Ls greater
freedom.
   The amendment, sponsored by Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., the
chairman of the House Banking subcommittee on financial
institutions, requires S&amp;Ls to concentrate 80 percent of their
lending on housing, up from the current requirement of 60 percent.
   But, it very broadly defines the types of lending that would be
used to meet the 80 percent standard to include consumer, small
businesses and education loans. It also would not penalize any
institution for its existing mix of investments, even if that did
not meet the requirement.
   ``One can have the advantage of wanting to sound pro-housing and
still know that one supports greater latitude,'' said Rep. John
LaFalce, D-N.Y., who supported the amendment.
   Annunzio said his measure ``will build homes and help revitalize
our inner cities.''
   The 26-18 vote approving it came as the subcommittee began its
third day of drafting S&amp;L legislation and the Senate Banking
Committee opened its bill-writing session.
   Tresury Secretary Nicholas Brady, in a letter today to Chairman
Don Riegle, D-Mich., called the Senate committee's recommended
changes on regulating the industry ``on balance meritorious'' but
said the administration still objects to his plan to put $50
billion of taxpayer cost in the bailout on the federal budget.
   Meanwhile, the House lawmakers are rejecting Bush's effort to
make the savings and loan industry meet the same capital
requirements as banks in return for bailing out the thrift industry.
   By a 27-16 vote, the panel adopted changes, advocated by Rep.
Stan Parris, R-Va., that would make it easier for S&amp;Ls, through
subsidiaries, to invest in such risky areas as commercial real
estate development and junk bonds.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, in opposing the amendment, said, ``It's
all about whether we want to support risk takers with government
guarantees.''
   On Tuesday, the subcommittee rebuffed, 24-23, Bush's insistence
on doubling the required capital base of S&amp;Ls from 3 percen to 6
percent, the same level that commercial banks have to meet.
   But then in several votes against Annunzio, it endorsed
elimination of several ``smoke and mirror'' accounting practices
that allow S&amp;L owners to meet the present capital standards with
little or no investment of their own.
   The Senate committee, before today's session, had reached a
bipartisan consensus behind closed doors ``on nearly all issues,''
according to its chairman, Sen. Don Riegle, D-Mich.
   One Senate committee member, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, predicted its version will be much tougher than whatever
emerges from the House in regulating S&amp;Ls in the future.
   But Riegle conceded in a letter to Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady that financing the taxpayer portion of the bailout ``remains
unresolved.'' And committee sources, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, predicted a party-line fight on the issue.
   Bush wants to raise the $50 billion immediate taxpayer share of
the bailout through 30-year bonds to be issued by a new
quasi-governmental corporation as a way to prevent the costs from
showing up on the federal deficit this year and next.
   Riegle, with support from congressional auditors and
``acquiescence'' of Senate Budget Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn.,
wants to put the bulk of the costs in the fiscal 1989 budget,
saying it would save taxpayers $4.5 billion in lower interest costs
over three decades.
   In his letter dated Monday to Brady, Riegle said he was aware of
the treasury secretary's threat earlier this month that Bush would
veto the bill if the bailout costs are included in the 1989 or 1990
budget deficits.
   ``We have made substantial movement toward the administration's
direction on the regulatory and structural aspects but have yet to
see any flexibility from you on the funding dimension,'' he
complained.
   In the House, Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has drafted an
amendment similar to Riegle's financing scheme. But Schumer said he
is waiting for the ``appropriate time'' to introduce it, presumably
after the Senate committee has a showdown vote on the issue.
   Seven Republicans on the House panel joined 17 Democrats in the
24-23 vote Tuesday rejecting Bush's proposal to make S&amp;L owners
have $6 instead of $3 in capital for every $100 they lend out.
   Eleven Democrats sided with 12 Republicans in a failed effort to
reject the adopted alternative scheme introduced by Annunzio and
Parris.
   The Annunzio-Parris measure maintains the current 3 percent
capital floor but for the first time requires that half that amount
_ $1.50 on every $100 in loans _ be real cash investment by S&amp;L
owners that can be recovered if the thrift fails.
   Annunzio cited Federal Home Loan Bank Board estimates that 1,100
S&amp;Ls would falter under Bush's capital standards and claimed his
measure is tougher in some ways because it requires owners to put
their own money at risk.

   The Senate today added to legislation to
increase the minimum wage an unrelated amendment increasing by
roughly $1,000 the amount of outside income Social Security
recipients are allowed to earn before facing benefit cutbacks.
   The amendment, passed 86-11, was one of more than a dozen up for
consideration today before a final vote on the minimum-wage bill,
which calls for raising the hourly base wage from its current $3.35
to $4.55 by October 1991.
   The slow pace of the debate on amendments threatened to push the
final vote back until Thursday.
   Passage of the amendment offered by Sen. William L. Armstrong,
R-Colo., also brought the Senate bill far out of line with a
House-passed bill, meaning that after final Senate passage a
conference committee would be needed to draft a compromise.
   The current outside earnings limit is $8,880 for Social Security
recipients 65 years of age or older. After crossing that limit
recipients lose $1 of benefits for every $2 in earned income.
   The amendment would increase the limit for most of those
affected to $9,960. It would apply to Social Security recipients
between the ages of 65 and 70. The earnings limit expires after age
70.
   Most of the senators who spoke against the amendment said they
supported its goal but questioned the appropriateness of adding it
to the minimum-wage bill. They also said that benefits to thousands
of Social Security recipients likely would have to be cut to pay
for the proposal.
   The amendment is not related to the mininum wage but Senate
rules do not prohibit tacking on other proposals to legislation
being considered by the full body.
   An impasse between President Bush and the Democratic
congressional leadership that threatens prospects for a higher
minimum wage has both sides trying to convince the public the other
side is to blame.
   Bush has said he will veto the Democratic plan, a development
that could lead to a ninth consecutive year without an increase in
the minimum wage despite the first White House support this decade
for some boost.
   Polls have shown the public overwhelmingly supports an increase,
a fact not lost during the partisan wrangling.
   ``This legislation will be a test of whether we indeed are
seeking a kinder, gentler nation,'' Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell said Tuesday, criticizing Bush for refusing to budge from
his proposal, which would raise the minimum wage from $3.35 an hour
to $4.25 an hour by January 1992.
   Mitchell said Bush's ``kinder, gentler'' campaign rhetoric is at
odds with his opposition to the Democratic bill, particularly when
the president is backing expanded tax breaks for capital gains
enjoyed largely by the nation's wealthy.
   ``How can anyone justify wanting to give $30,000-a-year tax cuts
to the richest Americans and at the same time oppose 30 cents an
hour more for the poorest Americans?'' said Mitchell, D-Maine.
``That's not right. It's wrong. It's unfair.''
   Mitchell spoke just before the Senate rejected Bush's proposal,
58-41, largely along party lines, and instead amended a bill by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., to bring it more in line with the
House bill. That revision was approved, 61-39.
   The administration fired back quickly, with Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole raising the prospect that the partisan squabbling
would result in no increase in the minimum wage this year.
   ``Democrats have no one to blame but themselves,'' Mrs. Dole
said. ``The Democrats decided they'd rather fight than win.
Unfortunately, the people who really lose are the ones who can
least afford it.''
   In addition to favoring a smaller increase in the general
minimum wage, Bush has insisted on letting employers pay new
workers a sub-minimum ``training wage.'' Democrats, who long
opposed a sub-minimum, agreed this year to include one in their
proposal in hopes of making it more acceptable to the
administration.
   The Kennedy bill, as amended, contains a provision allowing
employers to pay new workers a sub-minimum wage for up to 60 days;
Bush has insisted on a six-month training wage.
   Republicans, however, are confident a veto can be upheld and are
in no mood for a compromise on the overall dispute.
   ``There isn't going to be a compromise,'' said Senate Republican
leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``It's going to be $4.25 an hour and a
six-month training wage, period.''

   Hewlett-Packard Co. announced today it
will buy Apollo Computer Inc., a pioneer in the engineering
workstation market, for $476 million in cash.
   The purchase of Apollo by Hewlett-Packard, a manufacturer of
computers and scientific equipment, continues its push into the
$3.8 billion workstation market.
   Under the agreement, Hewlett-Packard will offer $13.25 per share
for Apollo's estimated 36 million shares of common stock
outstanding and will begin its tender offer within five business
days.
   The companies' board of directors unanimously approved the
definitive agreement that will merge two players in the engineering
workstation market, the fastest-growing area of the computer
industry.
   Workstations are single-user computers that resemble personal
computers but are usually faster and have larger screens with
better graphics. They were originally used mostly by scientists and
engineers.
   But the use of workstations, which range in price from $5,000 to
$100,000, has spread to other professions such as financial
analysis.
   Apollo, a Fortune 500 company founded in 1980 and based in
Chelmsford, Mass., pioneered engineering workstations but fell
behind Sun Microsystems Inc. in the rapidly growing market. The
company squeezed out a profit of $2.1 million last year on sales of
$654 million, although it lost money in its second and third
quarters.
   After the second-quarter loss, which surprised analysts, Roland
D. Pampel resigned as president to become president of Bull HN
Information Systems Inc.
   Apollo's stock had risen earlier this year on speculation that
it might be taken over, possibly by Bull HN Information. But the
stock drifted back as the speculation faded. Apollo closed
unchanged at $8.12{ a share Tuesday in over-the-counter trading.
   Palo Alto-based Hewlett-Packard entered its 50th year of
business in 1989 following a financially rosy 1988 when it reported
a 27 percent jump in net income, a 34 percent rise in earnings per
share and revenue of $9.8 billion.
   ``HP and Apollo together represent an ideal blending of product
strengths and business strategies,'' said John A. Young,
Hewlett-Packard president and chief executive officer. ``Both
companies are recognized for technical innovation and high-quality
computer products, and for a commitment to the industry's move
toward cooperative-computing environments based on open industry
standards.''
   The acquisition is agreement is subject to regulatory approval
and the expiration of waiting periods.
   ``Apollo is extremely pleased to join forces with one of the
industry's outstanding organizations,'' said Thomas A. Vanderslice,
Apollo's chairman and chief executive officer.

<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Loewenbraeu company of Munich,
one of West Germany's best-known beer-makers with origins that date
to the 14th century, is considering direct exports to the United
States after watching falling sales of its licensed brew in America.
   But Loewenbraeu general manager and director Peter Wiedemann
emphasizes direct export is just one option under consideration,
and praises the cooperation with licensing partner Miller Brewing
Co. of Milwaukee.
   ``We have an excellent business and personal relationship with
Miller,'' Wiedemann emphasized in an interview with The Associated
Press. But he said that in an effort to raise flagging sales,
``among the various options that we have, there could also possibly
be the resumption of direct exports.''
   He confirmed published reports that annual sales of the licensed
Loewenbraeu on the American market, which began under a pact made
in the early 1970s, has dropped by nearly a third since then.
   Fritz Kuhn, a Loewenbraeu spokesman, said the licensed product
is brewed in Miller-run U.S. breweries. Direct exports means
Loewenbraeu would ship its beer made in West Germany to the United
States.
   The remarks by Wiedemann and Kuhn appeared to surprise officials
at Miller, a leading American brewer, which has a contract with
Loewenbraeu that runs through 1992.
   ``Quite frankly, I'm really puzzled by what they said,'' said
Beverly Jurkowski, a Miller spokeswoman reached by telephone. ``The
very nature of that contract would prevent some of those other
options from taking place.''
   She said Miller and Loewenbraeu officials conferred in February,
a meeting she said the West German company found highly encouraging.
   The Lowenbraeu general manager suggested that in the future,
both companies might collaborate on direct exports of Loewenbraeu
to the United States. He declined to be more specific.
   Loewenbraeu already has formed a company in Boston, Loewenbraeu
Marketing Corp., to study the possibility of direct exports and to
look into other possibilities in the United States, Wiedemann said.
   ``Because our sales in the United States are down, we must
undertake decisive strategy changes,'' the Loewenbraeu executive
said.
   He acknowledged that the higher price for export beer is one
consideration weighed by officials of the 606-year-old brewery.
   The general manager noted Loewenbraeu is considering the
purchase of a brewing facility on West Germany's northern coast,
near seaports and much closer to the United States than the current
facilities deep in southern Bavaria.
   ``That way we don't just have North America as a possible
market, we also have a substantial export business in the whole
world,'' Wiedemann said.
   He added: ``The beer we would brew there, if in fact we buy a
brewery, would be made according to the same recipe as we have here
in Munich.''
   The northern facility also could figure into Loewenbraeu's plans
to become a dominant brand within this country of 61.3 million
people.
   ``Among the approximately 1,150 breweries now in Germany, there
is none with a market share of more than 5 percent. There are so
many suppliers, and there is no truly national brand,'' he said.

<HEAD>London Shares End Slightly Higher After Losing Early Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices on the London stock exchange ended slightly
higher in quiet trading Wednesday, as the market's early euphoria
wore off by the afternoon.
   Driving prices higher from the outset of trading was news that
Beecham Group and SmithKline Beckman Corp. had agreed to merge, a
move that would create the world's second largest pharmaceutical
company.
   But dealers said there wasn't sufficient retail interest to
sustain the gains and prices began heading lower at late morning.
   Nervousness ahead of Thursday's release of British employment
and average earnings data also pulled the market down, dealers
said. The figures, along with Friday's retail price statistics,
could provide further insight into the outlook for inflation.
   U.S. trade figures for February, due on Friday, also sidelined a
number of players, dealers said.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index
was up 1.7 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,033.0.
   Volume was light, as 464.2 million shares changed hands, down
from 492.8 million shares on Tuesday.

   Wickes Cos. announced a $134 million
deal Wednesday to sell Orchard Supply Hardware to a management
group in the latest of a series of asset sales by Wickes' new
owners.
   The buyer group is headed by Orchard Supply President Maynard
Jankins and was organized by Freeman Spogli &amp; Co., a Los Angeles

Inc. and Bankers Trust Co.
   Wickes, a conglomerate with holdings in retailing, auto products
and wallpaper and fabrics, has been selling off assets since it was
bought last year by a partnership of Blackstone Capital Partners
and Wasserstein, Perella Partners.
   The Orchard Supply deal brings the company's gain from asset
sales to $700 million.
   The new owners are considering further sales, but intend to keep
running the company rather than breaking it up, said Jon Kutler, a
Wasserstein, Perella vice president.
   Sale of the San Jose-based hardware chain was not expected to
affect employees at Orchard Supply's 31 stores in northern and
central California, Wickes said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal National Mortgage Association, the
largest investor in home mortgages, on Wednesday reported a 65
percent rise in its first quarter income over a year ago.
   For the January-March period, the government-sponsored,
privately owned corporation known as Fannie Mae, said it earned
$165.2 million, or $1.98 a share. That compared with net income of
$100.9 million, or $1.27 a share, last year.
   David O. Maxwell, Fannie Mae's chairman and chief executive
officer, said earnings rose despite higher interest rates and the
$8 million cost to phase out the company's Software Systems
division.
   He said that as a result of a declining inventory of foreclosed
properties, the company last quarter reduced its provision for
losses to $80 million, down from $85 million in the fourth quarter.
   Roger E. Birk, the company's president and chief operating
officer, said that contributing to the improved performance last
quarter were an increase in the spread between the yield on the
company's investment portfolio and the cost of its outstanding
debt, the lower loss provision, and continued growth in guaranty
fee income from mortgage-backed securities.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Surge On Soviet Rumors, Bullish USDA Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most grain and soybean futures prices closed
higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid rumors of new
Soviet buying interest in the wheat market.
   But oat futures retreated, reflecting the abundance of foreign
oats available on the U.S. market.
   Crop futures were buoyed early in the session by an Agriculture
Department report indicating the nation's grain stockpiles were
declining more rapidly than most analysts had believed.
   Rumors surfaced at midday that the Soviet Union was eyeing new
purchases of U.S. wheat, which would be a significant development
because the Soviets have already purchased all the U.S. wheat
earmarked for sale to them this year at subsidized prices.
   The moderate decline in oat futures was overdue, said Jay Homan,
an independent oat trader in Chicago.
   ``We've needed to divorce ourselves from the strength of the
other grain markets,'' he said. ``There's a scarcity of American
oats but an abundance of foreign oats.''
   At the close, wheat was 2{ cents to 7{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.03{ a bushel; corn was 2\ cents
to 3{ cents higher with May at $2.67} a bushel; oats were 1} cents

<HEAD>J.P. Morgan Announces Drop In Quarterly Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., the nation's fourth largest
bank holding company, on Wednesday reported a 36 percent drop in
its first quarter profit over a year ago.
   The company said it netted $180 million, or 96 cents a share,
for the three months ended March 30, compared with earnings of $280
million, or $1.52 per share, in the 1988 period.
   The first quarter of 1988 included a gain of $43 million related
to a federal tax refund.
   Chairman Lewis T. Preston attributed the decline largely to the
rise in worldwide interest rates over the past year, which he said
limited opportunities in areas such currency and securities trading.
   Most effected was net interest income, which tumbled to $299
million in the first quarter from $438 million a year ago.
   Total non-interest income also declined, to $394 million from
$435 million, while non-interest expenses eased to $436 million
from $511 million.
   Morgan allowed less for credit losses during first quarter, $10
million against $50 million a year ago. It said total allowances
from such losses, including loans to Third World countries, was
$1.49 billion, during the quarter, down from $1.57 billion.

<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raytheon Co., the defense contractor and
appliance maker, said Wednesday its earnings rose 6.6 percent in
the first three months of 1989.
   The Lexington-based company said its revenues increased 6.4
percent as strong sales of defense electronics, major appliances
and other products offset a drop in aircraft purchases by the
government.
   Because of stock repurchases, Raytheon said its earnings per
share were up 8.9 percent.
   Raytheon reported net income for the quarter of $120.8 million,
or $1.83 per share, on sales of $2.07 billion. That compares with
net income of $113.3 million, or $1.68 per share, on sales of $1.95
billion in the first quarter of 1988.
   Chairman Thomas L. Phillips said all five of the company's
business sectors were profitable during the quarter. Those sectors
are electronics, aircraft, energy services, appliances and other
products.
   Although aircraft sales were down, Raytheon said the sector's
earnings were up as its Beech division, which makes both military
and civilian planes, improved its profit margins.
   Raytheon said its electronics sector, which accounted for 51
percent of revenues last year, was led by the Missile Systems
Division, which produces Hawk, Sparrow, Sidewinder and other
sophisticated missiles.
   The appliance sector, including Amana refrigerators, Caloric
ranges and Speed Queen washers, had growth in sales but a decline
in profits as competition squeezed margins, the company said.
   Raytheon has 76,100 employees worldwide, including 30,700 in
Massachusetts, second only to Digital Equipment Corp., the
Maynard-based computer manufacturer with 35,000 workers in the
state.

<TEXT>
   The Carlyle Group continued its pursuit of
Fairchild Industries Inc. Wednesday, sweetening its offer for the
aerospace electronics company to $243.7 million.
   It was the second time Carlyle has raised its offer for
Fairchild, which has rejected the investment partnership's previous
bids.
   Carlyle said it would pay $17 for each of Fairchild's14.3
million outstanding shares, up from $16.30 per share, or a total of
$233.7 million.
   Fairchild Secretary John Jackson said the bid was being
evaluated.
   Fairchild stock was up $1.50 in late New York Stock Exchange
trading Wednesday to $15.12{ a share.
   Carlyle, which owns about 14.8 percent of Fairchild stock,
originally offered $15.50 per share, or $222.2 million, for the
firm.
   Stephen Norris, a managing director of Carlyle, has said that
taking Fairchild private would be in the best interests of the firm.
   Carlyle has no intention of breaking up the company, Norris has
stated.
   If completed, the takeover would be the biggest acquisition to
date by Carlyle, which was founded less than two years ago. It has
aggressively pursued a series of friendly takeovers, and last year
bought Oakite Products Inc., a New Jersey chemical company, in
partnership with a French bank.
   One of the principals in Carlyle is former Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci, who has been involved in the negotiations by former
baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth to buy Eastern Airlines.
   A Fairchild unit, Vol-San-Chatsworth, was accused recently of
non-compliance with required testing procedures. The FBI has said
it was investigating Vol-Shan for what it called possible
falsification of quality control records at the California plant.

   Westinghouse Electric Corp. said Wednesday its
first-quarter profits rose 5 percent as its sales at a similar pace.
   Westinghouse said it earned $189 million, or $1.30 per share, up
from $180.5 million, or $1.25 per share, in the first three months
of 1988.
   Sales were up 5.5 percent to nearly $2.9 billion from $2.75
billion.
   The results included a $261.5 million charge as the cost of
restructuring its manufacturing operations. The charge offset gains
from the sale of the Westinghouse elevator business and the
formation of a joint venture in electricity transmission and
distribution.
   Westinghouse, the nation's leading builder of nuclear power
plants, said its energy and utility division made key contributions
to an 11 percent increase in operating profits.
   The division's gains came primarily on sales of nuclear fuel,
energy systems and transmission and distribution business.
   Operating profits rose from $253.4 million a year earlier to
$281.2 million.
   ``The earnings improvement for the quarter, combined with a
strong rate of orders and a solid backlog of $11 billion, are
positive signs for the continuing progress of the corporation,''
Chairman John C. Marous said in a printed statement.
   Westinghouse also has broadcasting, financial services,
industrial, electronics and commercial businesses.

   Stocks rose again Wednesday in a session marked
by takeover deals and mild optimism about the outlook for interest
rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.07 to 2,319.65,
adding to its 9.71-point gain on Tuesday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
818 up, 618 down and 542 unchanged.
   Traders were looking ahead to Friday's flood of economic
reports, including widely watched ones on wholesale prices,
merchandise trade, industrial production and factory use.
   Any indication of a slowdown would ease fears of inflation and
thus take pressure off the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates
as a way of cooling off the economy.
   High interest rates have siphoned money from stocks into the
credit market.
   ``It's awfully hard to compete with 10 percent CDs and 9.5
percent Treasuries,'' said Richard Wholey, a broker-analyst at
Wayne Hummer &amp; Co. in Chicago.
   The bond market was basically flat Wednesday as traders awaited
the economic reports, but stocks edged higher, continuing a gradual
and uneven uptrend.
   So far this year the Dow Jones industrial average has risen just
under 7 percent.
   ``This is building in a very gradual and I think a healthy
fashion. There has been no explosion of euphoria. Good, solid
base-building is what appears to be going on,'' said Peter Barry,
research director at Fahnestock &amp; Co. in New York.
   The volume of trading on the New York Stock Exchange was the
second highest in what has been a quiet month on Wall Street.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 165.20 million
shares, up from 146.83 million in the previous session. That was
just below the volume of 165.88 million last Wednesday.

   The dollar ended mixed against major currencies
in U.S. trading Wednesday after increasing slightly abroad.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid of $387 for a troy ounce of gold, up $2.10 from Tuesday's late
bid.
   Trading activity was kept in check by speculation about possible
central bank intervention and reluctance on the part of dealers to
take major new positions ahead of U.S. government reports on retail
sales Thursday and merchandise trade and producer prices Friday.
   A dealer at a major Japanese bank in London said traders ``are
ultra-cautious and reluctant to test the central bank's resolve
until the release of the data later this week,'' Political
difficulties for the governments in Japan and West Germany caused
some dealers to sell yen and marks, which helped strengthen the
dollar marginally.
   The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo with a rise of 0.23
Japanese yen to a closing level of 132.85 yen. Later, in London, it
was trading higher at 132.95 yen and in New York it finished at
133.025, up from 132.705 Tuesday.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.6925 to buy one pound compared with $1.6995 late Tuesday. By the
time trading was done for the day in New York, the pound fetched
$1.69215 vs. $1.6910 Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
late rates, included: 1.88275 West German marks, down from 1.88525;
1.66475 Swiss francs, up from 1.66375; 6.3615 French francs, down
from 6.3655; 1,380.50 Italian lire, down from 1,381.375; and,
1.18955 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18945.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
1.8857 West German marks, up from 1.8825; 1.6645 Swiss francs, up
from 1.6582; 6.3690 French francs, up from 6.3535; 2.1270 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.1225; 1,381.00 Italian lire, up from 1,379.25;
1.1887 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1888.
   Gold bullion prices strengthened in trading at home and abroad.
   In New York, a troy ounce of gold for current delivery ended at
$388.20 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange, up from Tuesday's
$385.80.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $387.25 a troy ounce,
compared with late Tuesday's $385.25.
   In Zurich, gold was higher, closing at a bid $387.30 compared
with $385.00 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.29 to close at a bid $385.08.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $5.89 a troy ounce, compared
with Tuesday's $5.84.
   Silver for April delivery rose on New York's Comex, settling at
$5.868 a troy ounce, up from $5.834 on Tuesday.

<HEAD>SmithKline, Beecham Plan To Merge Into World's Second-Largest Drug
Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERICH SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   SmithKline Beckman Corp. and Britain's
Beecham Group PLC announced Wednesday they would merge and form the
world's second-largest pharmaceutical company, but a Wall Street
analyst warned that either firm could find itself a takeover target
before the transaction is completed.
   SmithKline and Beecham, who confirmed earlier this month they
were negotiating on a merger, said they would exchange stock and
establish a pharmaceutical and health care giant with estimated
sales of $6.7 billion.
   The new company, to be named SmithKline Beecham, would rank
second in worldwide pharmaceutical sales behind Merck &amp; Co., second
in over-the-counter medicines behind American Home Products Corp.
and fourth in animal health.
   The firm will have a research and development budget of more
than $500 million per year, SmithKline Chairman Henry Wendt said at
a news conference.
   ``We will have one of the best and largest research and
development organizations in the world, drawing on the scientific
skills and traditions of the United States and Britain,'' he said.
   Under the merger agreement, SmithKline shareholders would
receive five ``B'' shares of stock in the new company for each of
their old shares, and Beecham shareholders would receive slightly
less than one ``A'' share for each of their old shares.
   The new shares would have equal voting rights in the affairs of
SmithKline Beecham but dividends paid to each ``A'' share would be
about five times the dividends paid to each ``B'' share.
   SmithKline currently has some 133 million shares outstanding and
Beecham has about 768 million shares outstanding.
   Two SmithKline subsidiaries, Allergan, an eye- and skin-care
business, and 84 percent of Beckman Instruments, which makes
diagnostic and laboratory equipment, would be spun off to
SmithKline shareholders, the companies said in a joint statement.
SmithKline last fall sold 16 percent of Beckman through a public
stock offering.
   Beecham plans to sell off its cosmetics and fragrance divisions,
plus other non-pharmaceutical businesses, officials said.
   SmithKline shareholders would receive a one-time cash dividend
of $5.50 per share. They also would get about half a share of
Allergan and about 0.18 shares of SmithKline stock for each
SmithKline share, according to a news release.
   The merger would be subject to governmental approval and a vote
by shareholders of both companies.
   SmithKline stock fell $2 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading Wednesday, closing at $62.75 a share.
   A financial analyst specializing in pharmaceutical companies
said the merger announcement could draw new bids for either company
before stockholders vote four months from now.
   ``To quote Yogi Berra, `It isn't over till it's over,''' said
Ron Nordmann of PaineWebber Group Inc. in New York. ``I think
that's why they attempted to announce this deal in all due haste.''
   Other companies mentioned as possible suitors for SmithKline are
Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Co., Nestle SA, Imperial Chemical Industries and
Du Pont Co.
   Wendt said SmithKline had received no other offers.
   ``There have been no feelers, no nudges, no cloakroom
conversations,'' he said when pressed on the question.
   But Normann said the announcement could change the situation.
   ``Think how short the concept of this merger has been in the
public domain,'' he said. ``And its such a large deal _ $11 to $13
billion, depending on what you think about the pieces. ...
   ``Now, X, Y, Z, who ever that might be, knows exactly what the
terms are that they have to top.''
   Wendt, 55, chairman and chief executive officer of SmithKline,
would become chairman of SmithKline Beecham, and Robert Bauman,
chairman of Beecham, would become chief executive officer of the
new company.
   The two companies executed agreements Wednesday to co-promote
several products, including SmithKline's popular ulcer drug
Tagamet. Beecham was granted a license to sell the drug under its
own brand name.
   Beecham, which makes Tums antacid pills, is particulary
interested in developing an over-the-counter version of Tagamet,
Bauman said.
   ``Building on the `Tums' franchise, an over-the-counter
formulation of `Tagamet' has the potential to become a global
brand,'' he said in a statement released by SmithKline.
   SmithKline reported total sales of $4.7 billion in 1988, while
Beecham's sales exceeded $4 billion.
   The new company would be based in London with offices in
Philadelphia.

   Gasoline futures prices surged higher in
moderate trading Wednesday, fueled by rising consumer demand.
   Strength in the gasoline pits helped push crude prices up, while
heating oil had a weaker day.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, unleaded gasoline for May
delivery rose 1.11 cents to 70.11 cents a gallon. Most other
contract months were higher.
   The May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, edged up 1 penny to close the day at $20.64 a
barrel. June and July showed no gains or losses while other months
rose between 2 cents and 10 cents a barrel.
   Heating oil for May delivery declined .03 cent to 53.20 cents a
gallon with other contract months mixed.
   Analysts said world demand for gasoline is continuing strong in
the wake of the Alaskan oil spill nearly three weeks ago.
   ``A lot of strength is coming out of Europe,'' said Jim Fiedler,
analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc. ``Europe had a
mild winter and people have been driving more.''
   In addition, new anti-pollution regulations in Europe also are
affecting demand, analysts said.
   Contributing to the weakness in crude prices was a weekly report
by the American Petroleum Institute showing a 500,000-barrel
increase in crude inventories for the week ending April 7. Market
participants had expected a sharp downturn in inventories because
of the Alaskan spill, traders said.

<HEAD>Palladium Cracks $170, A 5{-Year High, On Fusion Reports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Palladium futures prices surged to their highest level in nearly
5{ years Wednesday on New York's Mercantile Exchange amid optimism
that recent nuclear fusion experiments could spur demand for the
metal as an ingredient in the power plants of tomorrow.
   Other precious-metal futures prices also advanced.
   On other markets, cocoa futures plunged; gasoline prices rose
but other energy futures were mixed; grains and soybeans were
mostly higher; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Palladium settled $4.40 to $5.15 higher with the contract for
delivery in June at $173.65 a troy ounce. The move marked
palladium's first foray above $170 since December 1983, when the
metal reached nearly $180 a troy ounce.
   Palladium prices have risen in 10 of the 13 trading sessions
since March 23, when two chemists announced they had achieved
nuclear fusion at room temperature using palladium as a catalyst in
an experiment at the University of Utah.
   Fusion is the joining together of hydrogen atoms to produce
enormous amounts of energy. It is the process that powers the sun
and stars, and scientists seeking a cheap energy source have long
sought to harness it.
   Last week, palladium for June delivery went as high as $169 an
ounce only to collapse on Friday amid skepticism about the Utah
findings.
   But on Monday, researchers at Texas A&amp;M and Georgia Tech
announced they had replicated at least part of the University of
Utah results, bringing new buyers into the usually quiet palladium
market.
   Some of the buying interest in palladium spilled over into the
platinum market Wednesday.
   ``The rally in palladium created a psychological environment
which was conducive to rallies in the other precious metals,'' said
George Anagnos, an analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in
New York.
   But analysts said the moderate rise in gold and silver futures
was more likely a response to inflation jitters and signs that the
dollar's recent strength has peaked.
   Platinum settled $3.30 to $3.80 higher on the New York Merc with
May at $531.80 a troy ounce. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold
settled $2.20 to $2.40 higher with June at $392.10 a troy ounce;
silver was 3.2 cents to 4.2 cents higher with May at $5.895 a troy
ounce.
   Cocoa futures plummeted on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange on rumors that the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa
producer, had sold an unknown quantity of cocoa through the Swiss
trade house Intercafco, which denied any such deal.
   Cocoa settled $30 to $56 lower with May at $1,272 per metric ton.
   Unleaded gasoline futures rose sharply for the fourth straight
day on supply concerns. The crude- and heating-oil market were
quiet.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled unchanged to 6 cents
higher with May at $20.64 a barrel; heating oil was unchanged to 5
cents lower with May at 53.20 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.20 cent lower to 1.11 cents higher with May at 70.11 cents a
gallon.
   Most grain and soybean futures prices rose on the Chicago Board
of Trade amid rumors of new Soviet buying interest in the wheat
market.
   But oat futures retreated, reflecting the abundance of foreign
oats available on the U.S. market.
   Wheat settled 2 cents to 6} cents higher with May at $4.03 a
bushel; corn was 2\ cents to 3{ cents higher with May at $2.67} a
bushel; oats were 1} cents to 4{ cents lower with May at $1.79 a
bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 7 cents higher with May at $7.27{
a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, weak cash markets and
profit-taking weighed on the cattle futures while pork futures
advanced on ideas that farmers soon will be busy with spring
planting and will be marketing fewer hogs.
   Live cattle settled .87 cent lower to .60 cent higher with April
at 76.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent to .93 cent
lower with April at 76.40 cents a pound; live hogs were .12 cent to
.38 cent higher with April at 39.95 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .20 cent lower to .28 cent higher with May at 33.30
cents a pound.

<HEAD>IMF Loan Could Bolster Mexico's Standing In Talks With Commercial
Banks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico's latest $3.65 billion loan from the
International Monetary Fund will likely improve its standing in
upcoming debt restructuring talks with commercial bank creditors,
bank executives said Wednesday.
   Negotiations between the country and a 13-member bank committee
are set to begin April 19 in New York.
   At that time, Mexico will formally propose a reduction in the
value of its foreign debt, a cut in servicing and additional
lending over several years, according to Mexican Treasury Secretary
Pedro Aspe.
   He said Mexico will offer banks the option of exchanging old
debt for Mexican bonds that discount debt principal and reduce
interest rates.
   Mexico, struggling to overcome the burden of payments to
commercial banks and governments on its $107 billion foreign debt,
is the developing world's second-largest debtor behind Brazil,
which owes $121 billion.
   The three-year agreement reached with the IMF on Tuesday is the
first from the international lending community since Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady outlined a debt-reduction plan last month
that he hoped would help ease payment terms on the developing
world's $1.32 trillion foreign debt.
   William R. Rhodes, a Citicorp vice president, said the IMF pact
``is a positive signal as it forms an important part of Mexico's
economic program.''
   ``It will help facilitate negotiations with the bank advisory
group'' next week, he said in a statement.
   The $3.65 billion IMF loan will be used to bolster the country's
foreign exchange reserves and spur economic development.
   Aspe said the agreement ``is a fundamental change from the
past,'' since the IMF recognizes Mexico's need to set its growth
priorities first and schedule debt servicing accordingly.
   Many bankers agreed that the pact amounted to an endorsement of
Mexico's economic policies, which included tough inflation-fighting
programs.
   ``Mexico is a country that has made significant progress. It
deserves whatever kind of special treatment might be meted out,''
said Lloyd Atkinson, chief economist for the Bank of Montreal and
an advisor to the bank creditors committee.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department announced Wednesday
that it settled allegations that Citibank New York discriminated
against foreign-born job applicants.
   The issue was raised by the Center for Immigrants' Rights, which
brought the charges on behalf of a job applicant who wished to
remain anonymous, said Lawrence Siskind of the department's Office
of Special Counsel.
   The center alleged that Citibank was requiring that foreign-born
applicants for bank tellers show ``green cards,'' known formally as
alien registration cards, even though they already had provided
adequate documentation to satisfy the requirements of the
Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.
   That act, among other things, required employers to ensure that
they did not hire illegal aliens, and threatened them with fines if
they failed to do so.
   ``In the case of Citibank, it was discriminating against
foreign-born employees by forcing them to produce documents that it
wasn't forcing its other employees to produce,'' Siskind said.
   The INS deems drivers licenses, school identity cards with
photographs, voter registration cards and draft cards, among other
documents, as sufficient to establish identity.
   Although the allegation against Citibank focused on just one
individual, Siskind said, ``We did learn that they had been doing
it as a policy. They had instructed their personnel people to do
that, but as soon as we began our investigation and informed them
of the law, they agreed to stop the policy.''
   The investigation began Jan. 27 and was settled Monday, he said.
   In the settlement, Citibank agreed to accept any and all
documents allowed by the INS to satisfy the requirement that the
person is eligible for employment and agreed to treat all
applicants and employees the same. It will not pay any fine to the
government or any back pay to the affected individual, who was
subsequently hired, Siskind said.

<HEAD>Boesky Requests Early Release; Prosecutors Note Cooperation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ivan F. Boesky asked a federal judge to end his
three-year prison term but prosecutors Wednesday refused to take a
stand on releasing the former speculator at the center of Wall
Street's insider trading scandals.
   Boesky, who has already served one year in prison, claimed that
his help led to a record plea bargain deal by Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. and the subsequent indictment of its junk bond
financier Michael Milken and others on racketeering and securities
fraud charges.
   Boesky's lawyers on Tuesday asked U.S. District Judge Morris E.
Lasker to reduce his sentence to time already served, which would
allow his speedy release.
   ``The true fruits of Ivan Boesky's unsurpassed cooperation with
the government are now _ for the first time _ dramatically, fully
and publicly known,'' the court papers said.
   The papers claimed Boesky was ``to a significant extent a
follower in a larger criminal conspiracy organized and operated''
by Drexel and its high-yield bond department headed by Milken.
   The 98-count indictment of Milken, handed up March 29, alleged
that the Drexel bondsman illegally schemed with Boesky to defraud
clients and the investing public by manipulating stock prices and
skirting federal securities laws during attempted takeovers.
   In a letter to Lasker, who sentenced Boesky in December 1987,
the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office said ``the government takes no
position'' on Boesky's move, but acknowledged his cooperation in
the almost three-year probe into Wall Street corruption.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jess Fardella, writing on behalf of U.S.
Attorney Benito Romano, noted that ``the fruits of his cooperation
are now more vividly apparent to the public.''
   Fardella described the Milken indictment and the $650 million
tentative settlement of criminal charges Drexel reached with the
government as ``the centerpiece of Boesky's cooperation.''
   The letter continued: ``Boesky's disclosures were the essential
catalyst for all that has been and remains to be revealed in those
cases. Other investigations arising directly from Boesky's
disclosures have also matured since Boesky's sentencing.''
   But it added that ``the government nevertheless articulated the
value of that cooperation in unqualified terms when Boesky was
sentenced.''
   Boesky attorney Leon Silverman said: ``I will have no comment
while it's under consideration by the court.''
   Once one of the leading speculators on the stock of potential
takeover targets, Boesky pleaded guilty to one felony count as part
of his plea bargain. Boesky, 52, also agreed to pay a then-record
$100 million to settle civil insider trading charges brought by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   On April 15, 1988, Boesky filed papers seeking a sentence
reduction but asked Lasker to defer action. Attorneys again
deferred the request in October and said last week they planned to
seek his release following Milken's long-awaited indictment.
   The lawyers Tuesday said that ``public `blood lust''' at the
time of sentencing couldn't be countered.
   ``As the court recognized at sentencing, it was impossible for
the public or the press to understand the incalculable value of Mr.
Boesky's cooperation because the secrecy of the grand jury process
precluded any public recitation of the value of the information
that he had provided to the government,'' it said.
   Boesky was eligible for parole March 21, two days before his
one-year anniversary inside the minimum security prison camp in
Lompoc, Calif., where the one-time corporate titan is working as an
orderly. he has not yet sought parole.
   Boesky has supplied information used toward civil or criminal
charges in more than a dozen case in the United States and Britain.
In exchange, Boesky was allowed to plead guilty to one count of
conspiracy to lie to the SEC. His earliest non-parole release date
based on good behavior is April 4, 1990.
   At the time of sentencing, prosecutors said Boesky's three-year
term ``was an appropriate sentence in light of all the competing
factors.''
   They also said that while Boesky provided a ``window on the
rampant criminal conduct'' in the securities industry he also
``engaged in serious and widespread criminal conduct.''

<HEAD>Big Eight Accounting Firm Names Heads of Restructured Business Units</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.'s new chief executive
announced the heads of the accounting giant's restructured
operations Wednesday and said he was eager to pursue more business
after a tumultuous year.
   Lawrence A. Weinbach, confirmed last week to head the firm, said
the restructuring has created a consulting unit that will operate
independently and on an equal basis with its accounting, audit and
tax business unit.
   The consulting practice will be headed by George T. Shaheen, 44,
who had headed its North American consulting business. He had
previously been the southeast regional managing partner.
   The accounting, audit and tax practice will be headed by Richard
L. Measelle, 50, who had previously been managing partner for
worldwide accounting and audit practice. He has worked in
Andersen's offices in Detroit and Spain.
   Both will report to Weinbach.
   ``The good news is that we have completed our restructuring,
successfully gaining consensus among our partners worldwide and we
are moving aggressively forward,'' Weinbach said.
   He said 89 percent of the partners voting on the restructuring
approved it.
   Weinbach, 49, a 28-year veteran of firm who worked his way up
through the accounting side, was nominated last month and approved
last week to succeed Duane A. Kullberg as managing partner and
chief executive of Arthur Andersen, a privately-held firm based in
Chicago.
   Kullberg announced in January he was stepping down after nine
years as head of Andersen to help give the firm a new start as it
embarked on a restructuring designed partly to end a rift between
its accounting division and its more rapidly-growing management
information consulting division.
   The consulting business accounted for roughly 40 percent of the
firm's $2.8 billion in revenue last year. Weinbach said revenue
from from consulting rose more than 30 percent last year, while its
revenue from its tax practice was up 20 percent and audit and
accounting revenue rose 14 percent.
   ``This organization is back to work,'' Weinbach said, adding the
firm could once again focus full attention on competing in the
marketplace.
   Under questioning, he said the firm has lost no clients but said
it may not have capitalized on marketplace opportunities.
   During the past year, Andersen has been rocked by the defections
of six consulting partners, who have set up their own consulting
business with assistance from the London-based advertising giant
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC.
   Andersen and Information Consulting Group Inc., the firm formed
by Andersen's former partners, are suing each other, each claiming
business interference.

<HEAD>GPA Group to Make Largest-Ever Aircraft Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHANNON, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GPA Group Ltd., one of the world's
largest aircraft leasing companies, said Wednesday it will announce
the largest aircraft order in history next week, saying it plans to
order airplanes and engines worth between $11 billion and $20
billion.
   The Ireland-based company's chief operating officer, James M.
King, said he is ordering a mix of airplane models manufactured by
Boeing Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Airbus Industrie, the
European joint venture aircraft maker.
   The planes will include wide-bodied and narrow-bodied planes and
engines and will be the largest order ever, he said.
   Details of the order and the companies lined up to lease the
aircraft will be announced next Tuesday, King said.
   The order includes engines supplied by Rolls-Royce PLC, Pratt
and Whitney, Britain's General Electric Co., and CFMI, a joint
venture of General Electric and SNECMA of France.
   Analysts said the order is expected to exceed 200 planes and
would be worth almost $20 billion.
   Asked about these figures, King said, ``While I cannot confirm a
precise number to you, the suggestion is substantially correct.
It's in the region of 200 aircraft.''
   He indicated that a figure somewhere between $11 billion and $20
billion would be nearer the total value of the order.
   The largest previous order was by Delta Air Lines last September
for 225 Boeing and McDonnell Douglas planes worth $10.5 billion.
   Tony Ryan, the head of GPA, said the deal would leave the
company three times larger than its nearest competitors in the
aircraft leasing field.
   The Engineer magazine reported that Rolls-Royce will supply
engines for 50 Boeing 757s likely to be involved in the order.
   British Aerospace will make the wings for the Airbus A330s and
A320s which may also be fitted with Rolls-Royce engines, the
magazine said. GPA has already ordered 40 A320s.
   McDonnell Douglas could also win orders for MD-11 and MD-80
aircraft and the former may also carry Rolls-Royce engines, the
magazine said.

<HEAD>Motorola Profit Up Nearly 8 Percent In First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SCHAUMBURG, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc. reported a 7.9 percent
gain in first-quarter profit Wednesday, citing the continued rapid
growth of its computer chip and cellular telephone businesses.
   Motorola reported a profit of $123 million, or 95 cents a share,
for the three months ending April 1, compared with $114 million, or
88 cents a share, for the same period in 1988.
   Motorola's sales for the first quarter totaled $2.18 billion, up
11 percent from the $1.96 billion in the first quarter of 1988, the
Schaumburg-based company said.
   The company said both the sales and earnings figures were record
highs for a first quarter.
   Motorola said lower profits in its communications group, which
produces two-way radio and paging equipment, were more than offset
by higher profits in its semiconductor and general-systems groups.
   Chairman Robert W. Galvin expressed confidence that the
company's growth would continue.
   ``Significant product introductions, combined with steadily
increasing levels of quality and customer satisfaction, give us the
opportunity to gain greater shares of global markets,'' he said.
   During the quarter the semiconductor unit unveiled its new 68040
microprocessor, the first computer chip to contain more than 1.2
million transistors. The division enjoyed an 11 percent sales
increase during the first quarter.
   The general systems group saw its sales jump 58 percent, due
largely to continued strong orders for Motorola's cellular
telephone equipment and the introduction of several new computer
products.

   The upstart company that sparked the
desktop computer industry's trend toward higher-powered and
speedier machines on Wednesday unveiled a new generation of
products _ faster and mightier than before.
   Scott McNealy, president of Sun Microsystems Inc. of Mountain
View, hailed the line for ``ease-of-use features found, before now,
only in personal computers.''
   Surrounded by dazzling displays of multicolored canvas artwork
at San Francisco's Civic Auditorium, analysts and industry members
generally reacted favorably to Sun's machines.
   But not all are convinced the company can beat similar products
already released or planned by major competitors, including Apollo
Computer, Steve Jobs' Next Computer System and Digital Equipment
Corp.
   ``These are beautiful machines, clearly intended to push the
company into a bigger market,'' said software designer Ken Burton.
   ``But are these machines the right price, the right design with
the right capabilities for the business, school and personal-use
market?'' he asked. ``Or do the `other guys' have a more suitable
product for the business desktop? Only time will tell.''
   Workstations outperform personal computers by offering greater
speed, more memory and better monitors for enhanced graphics
capabilities, sometimes including 3-D.
   Some models of Sun's new line, priced from $5,995 to $73,900,
include or can add sophisticated new graphics and digital sound
capabilities, higher speeds and a $12,900 circuit board that allows
full-motion video on a computer screen, which can be used for
teleconferencing.
   The new and revamped products from the company, which last year
had a 28.3 percent share of the $4 billion annual workstation
market, are intended to capture a major share of the burgeoning
commercial market for workstations. By the mid 1990s, the total
annual workstation market is expected to be $20 billion. For most
of the last decade, workstations were used primarily by scientists
and engineers.
   The company's success for its new line is pinned on its
comparatively vast library of software available for it.
Competitors so far have fewer few software packages for their
machines.
   The company's SPARCstation 1, the so-called ``star'' of the new
line, will have the ability, for an additional $500, to emulate the
MS-DOS operating system of Microsoft Corp. That will allow the
SPARCstation to run popular programs written for IBM personal
computers, although at a lower speed.
   SPARCstation 1's $8,995 pricetag does not include a disk drive.
   Its speed of 12.5 million instructions per second, or MIPS, is
about four times the speed of the similarly priced high-end
Macintosh from Apple Computer and more than twice as fast as the
most powerful IBM-compatible personal computers.
   Previously, Sun's fastest machine using so-called reduced
instruction computing set technology, or RISC, had a speed of 7
mips and was priced at $22,000. Sun's version of RISC is called
SPARC.
   The SPARCstation 1 offers built-in digital audio capability,
eight megabytes of internal memory, three expansion slots, a
black-and-white screen and a size that is less than half the height
of a traditional PC console. A color-monitor version is available
for $15,500.
   Other new products announced included a revamp of the original
Sun-3 workstation line, with the addition of Motorola's fast 68030
microprocessor chip, three-MIPS machines that will start at $5,995;
a 16-MIPS workstation based on RISC chips starting at $29,900; and
an equally-fast SPARC system starting at $40,900 that is designed
to operate as a ``server'' to interact with many computers on a
network.
   Prime Computer Inc. announced Wednesday that it plans to
incorporate SPARC technology in future engineering workstations.
With this strategy, Sun hopes to turn its SPARC-based systems into
an industry standard.
   Other manufacturers offer machines that compare with Sun's new
models: DEC offers an eight megabyte internal memory workstation,
without disks, with a speed of 14 MIPS for $11,900, but no
expansion slots; Data General offers one with 17 MIPS for $7,450,
but with only four megabytes of internal memory and no expansion
slots.
   Next Inc.'s machine at $9995 will offer five MIPS with three
expanson slots and 256-megabytes of optical disk storage capacity
and eight megabytes of internal memory.

   The Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday
unanimously approved President Bush's $90 billion plan for bailing
out the savings and loan industry after rejecting an effort by the
panel's chairman to dump the $50 billion immediate taxpayer portion
of the cost onto the 1989 federal budget.
   The 21-member panel voted 11-10 to establish a quasi-government
corporation for issuing 30-year bonds to finance the government's
share _ as Bush wanted _ instead of the on-budget alternative
advocated by Banking Committee Chairman Don Riegle, D-Mich.
   Democratic Sens. Alan Cranston of California, Alan Dixon of
Illinois and Jim Sasser of Tennessee sided with all but one of the
committee's nine Republicans in favoring Bush's plan over Riegle's.
   But Riegle himself admitted he had lost enthusiasm for the
proposal after Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady repeatedly told
Senate Democrats throughout Wednesday he would recommend that Bush
veto the legislation if it swelled the budget deficit.
   Sasser, who met with Brady throughout the day, said the
administration's opposition would have made the effort to solve the
S&amp;L crisis ``drag on for months.''
   ``The secretary of treasury was absolutely adamant there would
be a presidentia veto and we would be back to square one,'' Sasser
said.
   Earlier, Brady wrote a letter to senators in which he didn't
repeat the Bush veto threat, but did say the administration opposed
Riegle's plan.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., the chief advocate in the House of
such a plan, said he is holding off on proposing it after receiving
a letter Wednesday from White House budget director Richard Darman,
who said he would refuse to count all of the spending in 1989.
   If Darman carried out the threat, it would wreak havoc on
efforts to meet the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit targets in 1990 and
1991. Schumer said Darman has the sole power to make that decision
but said he was still looking for a way to circumvent him.
   Riege said his plan would avoid the ``accounting and budget
gimmickry'' of Bush's proposal by reducing the interest costs of
financing the bailout through direct Treasury borrowing at a
savings of $4.5 billion to taxpayers over the next three decades.
   Utah Sen. Jake Garn, the committee's ranking Republican, said he
still has a ``fundamental disagreement'' over allowing the bailout
costs to swell the federal deficit in apparent violation of a
congressionally mandated reduction target that already has been
exceeded.
   All three versions _ Bush's, the Senate panel's and one being
put together in the House Banking Committee's financial
institutions subcommitee _ would use the $50 billion over the next
three years to pay for the bailouts of some 200 insolvent S&amp;Ls in
1988 plus 350 more that are insolvent or nearly so.
   They also provide for an additional $33 billion _ $300 million a
year of it coming from the industry _ to take care of thrift
insolvencies expected in the 1990s, especially if interest rates
continue to rise or the nation falls into a recession.
   ``The president asked us to move quickly and that's what we've
done,'' Riegle said. ``We've given him a strong bill with many
streamlined reforms and changes that can prevent in the future a
repeat of what's happened in the past.''
   Unlike changes made by the House subcommittee, the Senate
panel's version retains Bush's proposal to double by June 1991 the
required capital that S&amp;L operators must have to qualify for
federal deposit insurance.
   Bush would not shut down institutions that fail to meet that
standard then but he would prevent them from growing. Both Senate
and House versions would allow undercapitalized thrifts to continue
growing, but would restrict that growth primarily to home mortgages
and consumer loans.
   The House panel, which finished its third full day of drafting
the bill, rejected Bush's measure to make S&amp;Ls have the same
minimum capital requirements as banks _ $6 for every $100 of
outstanding loans _ voting 24-23 Tuesday to keep the current floor
_ $3 for every $100 in loans _ but requiring for the first time
that half that amount be in real money.
   Both panels, however, have voted to phase out many of what
critics call ``smoke and mirrors accounting fictions.''
   Those accounting practices have allowed S&amp;Ls to escape putting
up their own cash or retained earnings by counting as capital such
items as investments in non-thrift subsidiaries, ``good will,''
their own borrowings and even losses on bad loans.
   Bush would immediatly end many such bookkeeping practices.
   By a 27-16 vote Wednesday, the House subcommittee voted to
continue allowing S&amp;Ls to funnel depositors' fund into subsidiaries
to invest in risky areas such as commercial real estate
development, fast food franchises and junk bonds.
   The Senate panel's version would phase out such practices over
five years but there were disagreements among senators over whether
to do it in equal yearly installments or all at once.
   The House panel also approved Wednesday a measure by its
chairman, Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-N.J., requiring S&amp;Ls to
concentrate 80 percent of their lending on residential mortgages,
compared with the 60 percent now required.
   But the measure also broadly defines housing to include
consumer, education and small business loans and no S&amp;L would be
penalized if the mix of its current loan portfolio does not meet
the requirement.
   The subcommittee also approved, 34-12, a measure sponsored by
Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the full committee,
which would require the government to offer some of the repossessed
property from failed S&amp;Ls for housing poor people. It authorizes
spending $574 million to subsidize rents on the properties or offer
discounts or low-interest loans to purchasers.
   It adopted another measure, by voice vote, imposing government
oversight on the agency in charge of selling repossessed real
estate and establishing procedures designed to guard against the
dumping of the property at firesale prices.

   Peter V. Ueberroth's proposed $464 million
purchase of strike-bound Eastern Airlines collapsed Wednesday but a
federal bankruptcy judge immediately moved to attract new buyers
for the carrier.
   The former baseball commissioner told a news conference his deal
fell through following an impasse Tuesday night with Eastern's
unions and its parent Texas Air Corp.
   ``We are extremely disappointed this transaction collapsed last
night and is done,'' Ueberroth told a news conference. ``Our
agreement with Texas Air is terminated, it's finished, it's over.''
   His announcement squelched a stunning but short-lived effort to
buy one of the nation's most unprofitable and strife-ridden
airlines, which has been mired in an emotional strike and
bankruptcy proceedings for more than a month.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes said the Miami-based airline's
strategy now was to reorganize as a smaller carrier serving roughly
50 percent to 60 percent of its pre-strike schedule of 1,040
flights a day and employing some 15,000 to 18,000 people, compared
with 31,000 before the strike.
   Bakes refused to answer whether the airline would consider new
buyout offers. He denied that a competing offer had been made by
Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl Icahn, who nevertheless has
indicated he remained interested.
   But shortly after the announcement, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton
R. Lifland ordered the parties involved in the sale to show why he
should not throw the airline open to all bidders _ and include with
it certain assets Texas Air has bought or transferred from Eastern
since acquiring it in 1986.
   The order is based on a petition by an Eastern creditor, Atlanta
attorney Moreton Rolleston Jr., that seeks to block the sale of
Eastern's Northeast shuttle for $365 million to developer Donald
Trump.
   The petition also seeks to require that any purchase of Eastern
be for $615 million, the amount Texas Air paid for it in 1986;
include all of its System One computerized reservation system,
which it sold to Texas Air; and include aircraft it has transferred
to sister carrier Continental Airlines.
   Lifland scheduled a hearing Monday on the matter for all parties
involved in Eastern's bankruptcy case and Ueberroth's attorneys.
   The key issue blocking the sale to Ueberroth was who would run
the airline in an interim period between the completion of a deal
and the airline's emergence from bankruptcy.
   ``We were not able to bridge this hurdle although both of us I
think tried to do that,'' Ueberroth said.
   According to a participant in the talks, who asked not to be
identified, court-appointed examiner David I. Shapiro recommended
Monday that U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland name former
Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci trustee.
   Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo objected to the appointment of
any trustee and Lifland refused to name one without explaining why,
the source said.
   Eastern's unions have accused Lorenzo of gross mismanagement and
of stripping Eastern of vital assets since Texas Air bought the
airline in 1986, and have refused to return to work while he was in
charge. The pilots and Machinists already have petitioned Lifland
to appoint a trustee.
   Henry Duffy, president of the Air Line Pilots Association,
issued a statement from Washington saying the union was
disappointed and noting the problems that caused the strike
remained unresolved.
   ``This is but one act in a multi-act play, and the bankruptcy
judge still is running the proceedings,'' Duffy stated.
   ``I'm disappointed to say the least,'' said Wally Haber, a
Machininsts union general chairman in Miami. ``I can tell you right
now, Mr. Lorenzo would have walked away in this deal with a lot
more money than he put into Eastern Airlines. Obviously they've got
some plans to milk some more out of Eastern.''
   At Eastern corporate headquarters, management employees gathered
around television sets and expressed relief.
   ``It looks like we move on to another phase,'' veteran spokesman
James Ashlock said. ``I do think there is a certain release of
anxiety here at the base, where a great many people particularly
the non-contract people were increasingly concerned at the way the
situation had been building.''
   Lifland met earlier Wednesday with attorneys for Eastern, its
unions and the Ueberroth group to try to save the deal, saying it
represented a historic opportunity to salvage one of the nation's
biggest airlines.
   Any deal would have required full agreement from Ueberroth,
Lorenzo, Eastern's three unions and Eastern's creditors.
   Eastern has been flying only a fraction of its schedule since
its Machinists union began a strike March 4 that has been supported
by its flight attendants and pilots unions.
   In a related development Wednesday, a federal judge in Miami
upheld the Eastern's pilots participation in the Machinists strike.
The ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Davis seriously hurt the
company's effort to get the airline flying again.
   Davis said he saw no evidence that ALPA would have gone on
strike if the Machinists hadn't.
   The company said it would ask the federal appeals court to
reject Davis' opinion, but pilots union attorneys said appellate
courts historically accept such findings of fact by lower court
judges.
   Eastern sought bankruptcy protection March 9 because of a cash
crisis stemming from the walkout and pressure from creditors.
Lorenzo has been trying to peddle the airline since then and has
indicated there have been other overtures.
   Icahn, who has been approached previously by Eastern's
Machinists about making an offer, issued a statement Wednesday
saying he remained interested in Eastern. However, he stated,
``although I might be willing to risk my capital in Eastern, I
would not be willing to pay it over to Texas Air.''
   Icahn was not available to elaborate on the statement, his
secretary said.
   Texas Air also has indicated it received a conditional offer
from Jay Pritzker, head of the Hyatt Hotel chain, after initially
getting Ueberroth's bid.
   Meanwhile, a Manhattan diamond dealer said he has formed a
partnership with an unidentified foreign airline that he said could
raise more than $250 million by the end of the week for a bid.
   Willy Censor, 62, said he had met with officials from Eastern
and U.S. Bankruptcy Court to discuss his proposal for buying the
strike-bound carrier. Eastern attorney David Boies confirmed he met
with Censor but declined to say whether the airline was taking the
bid seriously.
   Ueberroth emerged as the buyer earlier this month and a deal
appeared virtually assured, especially after his group reached
labor agreements with Eastern's striking unions following
negotiations this past weekend.
   But negotiations with Texas Air began to deteriorate Tuesday,
amid sometimes-heated discussions with Shapiro. Lorenzo and
Ueberroth walked out of discussions at bankruptcy court that
evening, hours before their self-imposed midnight deadline for
reaching agreement.
   Under five-year deals reached with Ueberroth on Monday, the
three unions _ the Machinists, ALPA and the flight attendants union
_ would have received 30 percent ownership of the airline in
exchange for about $210 million in concessions.

   Hewlett-Packard Co. moved to seize
leadership in the $4 billion computer workstation market Wednesday,
announcing an agreement to buy Apollo Computer Inc. for $476
million in cash.
   Hewlett-Packard's surprise announcement stole some thunder from
rival Sun Microsystems Inc., which had chosen Wednesday to announce
what it called the most significant new products in its history.
   Apollo and Hewlett-Packard together would have 30.4 percent of
the burgeoning workstation market, capturing the lead from Sun,
which has 28.3 percent, according to Dataquest Inc., a San
Jose-based research firm.
   The workstation market is expected to grow at a 30 percent clip
through 1993, according to Alea Fairchild, an analyst with
Dataquest.
   Workstations are single-user computers that resemble personal
computers but are usually quicker, bigger and with larger screens
and better graphics. They were originally used mostly by scientists
and engineers but are being increasingly targeted to everyday
personal and business use.
   ``It signals a real major commitment on our part to the
workstation portion of our business,'' said Richard Watts, director
of marketing in Hewlett-Packard's computer products sector.
   Hewlett-Packard will offer $13.12 per share for Apollo's
estimated 36 million shares of common stock outstanding and will
begin its tender offer within five business days.
   Apollo shot up $4.62{ to $12.75, a gain of more than 50 percent
in heavy over-the-counter trading of 10 million shares.
Hewlett-Packard fell 75 cents to $53.50 in consolidated New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   The deal requires regulatory approval and the tender of at least
51 percent of Apollo stock by shareholders.
   Apollo, a Fortune 500 company founded in 1980 and based in
Chelmsford, Mass., was the pioneer of computer workstations, but
has suffered setbacks in the race with Sun and lost money in two
consecutive quarters last year. It squeezed out a profit of $2.1
million for the year as a whole on sales of $654 million.
   Apollo will likely operate as a division within
Hewlett-Packard's workstation group once the acquisition is
completed, which should be in 90 days, said Watts.
   Apollo Chairman and CEO Thomas A. Vanderslice termed the
transaction a ``win-win'' situation for both companies. He said he
did not foresee major layoffs resulting from the purchase.
   Hewlett-Packard said it will benefit from Apollo's strength in
computer networking and its large customer base and motivated
workforce.
   Hewlett-Packard will bring its strength in the graphics area to
Apollo, which could use the help, as well as financial resources
that includes $9.8 billion in revenues last year.
   ``The Hewlett-Apollo thing was pretty astonishing,'' said
Michael Murphy, a senior analyst and editor of San Francisco-based
California Technology Stock Letter. ``What Hewlett I think is doing
here is building a lot of customer relationships that they are then
going to migrate over into the Unix world.''
   Workstations run on Unix, an operating system that excels in
communications and the ability to carry out multiple tasks
simultaneously.
   The announcement came as Sun Microsystems rolled out a line of
Sparcstation computers that boast sophisticated new graphics and
digital sound, plus higher speeds and a circuit board that allows
full-motion video on a computer screen. It also launched a family
of Sun-3 workstations.
   ``I think that maybe is purely coincidental but it is
interesting timing,'' said Barry F. Bosak, an analyst with New
York-based Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   ``I think it buys Hewlett more visibility in an interesting
market. They certainly have the money to do it and Apollo did need
financial help,'' said Bosak, who called the $476 million a fair
price.
   Hewlett-Packard had 16.9 percent of the 1987-88 market share and
Apollo had 13.5 percent, Dataquest said.

   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo said
Wednesday he turned down Peter V. Ueberroth's proposed purchase of
Eastern Airlines because a takeover by a trustee was bad for the
airlines' shareholders.
   Lorenzo gave his reasons for the purchase collapse to Columbia
University graduate students at a lecture that was closed to the
media.
   Ueberroth offered $464 million for the strikebound airline and
the deal for a time seemed likely until talks broke down for good
over the issue of who would control the airline as it emerged from
bankruptcy.
   Eastern's unions demanded that the courts appoint a trustee but
Lorenzo refused.
   ``He blamed it (the collapse) on the unions,'' said Michael
Danitz, 27. ``He felt he should have been running the airline in
the interim. He felt he was better qualified being in the airline
(business) than somebody who's a trustee of the court.''
   Steve Mazzari, 27, another student, said Lorenzo gave the
audience a historical perspective on the Eastern troubles and then
explained ``why the Uebberoth deal did not fly.''
   Lorenzo told the students he wanted to ``run the company until
we can pay our shareholders,'' he said. ``He said he was looking
for the best deal in the interest of the shareholders. He thought
hiring a trustee was not in their best interest.''
   Another student who asked not to be identified said Lorenzo told
them he planned to sell some of Eastern's assets ``and that will be
better for the shareholders.''
   About 100 protesters marched outside Uris Hall, where Lorenzo
spoke for 20 minutes about the airline industry since deregulation
and then answered students' questions for another 40 minutes.
   One protester carried a sign that read, ``Frankie smooth talk
'59. Some things never change.'' Lorenzo was graduated from
Columbia in 1959.
   The executive avoided the protesters by going through an
underground entrance to address the lecture which had been
scheduled since November as part of the university's Distinguished
Lecture Series.
   Marie-Odile Taillard, chairwoman of the series, said Lorenzo had
asked that reporters not be among the 250 to 300 graduate business
students who warmly applauded him at the conclusion of his lecture.
   But not all the students were impressed.
   ``I went in there with a pretty bad impression of him and it
didn't change,'' said one student, who asked not to be identified.
   ``He felt he was a scapegoat. He blamed everybody else for the
situation. He seemed very unemotional,'' the student said.
   Outside, striking Eastern pilot Harry MacLaughlin, 58, marched
with other protesters as four security officers checked student
identification cards at the building's front entrance.
   ``He's a brilliant person, a financial wizard,'' MacLaughlin
said of Lorenzo. ``But he treats his employees in a demeaning
manner.''
   Danitz said one student asked Lorenzo what the students should
do if they someday find themselves embroiled in a difficult labor
situation.
   ``If it's a non-union place, don't let them in,'' Danitz quoted
Lorenzo as saying.
   ``He said if management is doing a good job, there's no reason
for unions to come in,'' Danitz said.
