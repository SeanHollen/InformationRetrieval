<TEXT>
   Gov. Cecil Andrus declared a state of
extreme emergency Friday, putting military reinforcements on call
to help the battle against hundreds of forest fires burning out of
control.
   The emergency proclamation, which allows the state to use the
National Guard, will last for 30 days or until the fire danger
subsides. The Boise Interagency Fire Center estimated about 3,000
people were working as firefighters or support personnel to battle
15,000 acres of Idaho fires.
   The weather cooperated in northern Idaho with high humidity that
slowed the flames, while the opposite was true for the Boise
National Forest.
   ``The humidity dropped considerably,'' said Lynette Davis, Boise
forest spokeswoman. ``When the air dried out, the fires got up and
ran.''
   A lightning storm earlier this week covered central Idaho with
500 fires, some limited to just a burning tree. Firefighters
concentrated on the larger blazes, while parachuting smokejumpers
or helicopter-borne crews tackled the small ones.
   The containment of small fires and shuffling of crews Friday
left it difficult to assess total acreage burned or manpower on the
fire lines.
   The top-priority fire in the state was the 1,500-acre Fleming
Creek blaze near Banks, north of Boise, said Pam Gardner, fire
information officer for the Payette forest north of Boise. It
burned on state and Boise forest land.
   The second fire of concern was the 600-acre Dollar Creek fire
near the South Fork of the Salmon River east of Cascade because of
the chance its destruction of ground cover could lead to erosion
into the river.
   Fire bosses in the Boise Bureau of Land Management District
focused on the 6,500-acre Deer Creek blaze near Mann Creek north of
Weiser, which had tripled in size since Thursday and was burning in
critical sharptail grouse habitat.
   In the Payette National Forest, about 500 firefighters from all
over the West had contained 70 of 130 fires and the Federal
Aviation Administration erected a temporary tower at the McCall
airport to monitor the scores of retardant bombers and smoke jumper
planes in the region.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Polygamist Leader's Appeal Despite Missed Deadline</HEAD>

   A federal judge ruled Friday that
polygamist clan leader Addam Swapp can appeal his conviction for
the bombing of a Mormon chapel, despite his attorney's failure to
meet a filing deadline.
   U.S. District Judge Bruce Jenkins gave defense attorney John
Bucher an extension for ``excusable neglect'' in filing the appeal
in the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals a few days late last summer.
   Meanwhile, federal prosectors said they will appeal Jenkins'
sentencing of Swapp and two of his three co-defendants in the Jan.
16, 1988, bombing and a subsequent standoff with authorities that
ended in a fatal shootout.
   The violence at the clan's compound ended a standoff with state
and federal officials. Corrections Lt. Fred House was killed and
Swapp was wounded in the exchange. The impasse had begun 13 days
earlier, when Swapp bombed a Mormon chapel near the farm.
   Bucher filed the appeal after Jenkins sentenced the four last
July, but the Denver appellate court returned the matter to Jenkins
so he could make a ruling on the late filing.
   Swapp, his brother Jonathan, his mother-in-law Vickie Singer and
her son, John Timothy Singer, were convicted of 20 counts of
bombing, attempted murder and use of firearms.
   Jenkins, defying federal mandatory sentencing guidelines
governing bombings and firearms which are much stiffer, originally
sentenced Swapp to 15 years in prison, Mrs. Singer to five years,
and Jonathan Swapp and Singer to 10 years each.
   Prosecutors, however, appealed the sentences and the 10th
Circuit returned the case to Jenkins, who added token additions to
the terms of the Swapp brothers and Mrs. Singer. He added no time
to Singer's term.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Lambert said the new appeal
would ask for five-year ``firearm enhancement'' terms for Singer
and the Swapps, but no additional time for Mrs. Singer, 47, who has
dropped her own appeal.
   The Swapp brothers and Singer also were convicted of state
homicide charges in House's death.

<TEXT>
   It's nearly dinner time, the baby is crying and
Mister Rogers comes on in five minutes. What's a parent to do?
   Two Seattle entrepreneurs hope the answer is the tot-sized TV
dinner. Pop it in the microwave and presto: cod with creamed peas
and squash.
   ``Babies love it and so do grown-ups. It tastes like real
food,'' said Linda Dootson Pigott, vice president of the Starting
Right Co. and the mother of a 7-year-old.
   She and company President Cameon Ivarsson said the idea behind
the frozen dinners is to start toddlers at 4 months with a balanced
and nutritional diet, without exhausting their mothers in the
process.
   The frozen minimeals are being produced and packaged in a
Seattle specialty-food factory while the entrepreneurs await
specially adapted machinery.
   The meals, being test-marketed in Seattle-area groceries,
contain items from the Pacific Northwest ranging from cod to
vegetables. The only additive is a little water for consistency,
Ms. Pigott said.
   The company is starting with four menus in three textures, from
smooth to chunky with offerings such as semolina pasta and brown
rice, Ms. Pigott said. There is also a vegetarian menu.
   Each bowl has a cartoon beneath the food to help encourage kids
to finish the food so they can see the picture. In each tub, the
foods are separate to allow mothers to introduce each item
separately to the child.
   ``It's exactly as if a mom made her own baby food. ... We're not
doing weird things, we're doing plain, simple things,'' said Ms.
Ivarsson, a Swiss-trained neurophysiologist.
   In Switzerland, she fed two boys, now 5 and 8, her homemade baby
food. She spent every other weekend cooking and freezing 40 mini-TV
dinners.
   When she moved to the United States and gave birth to Margaux,
now 15 months old, Ms. Ivarsson ``decided to do what every American
mother does'' and bought a jar of commercial baby food.
   The strained carrots, she said, were flavorless. Margaux wasn't
enthusiastic about the food either, she said.
   So, Ms. Ivarsson formed Starting Right with Ms. Pigott, who has
a degree in finance and once owned and operated a restaurant.
   Doctor friends gave advice about nutrition, and Ms. Ivarsson's
husband, who runs a restaurant helped with business tips.
   If the frozen dinners catch on, the company plans to incorporate
regional foods, depending on where the meals are distributed, so
babies start out eating foods they'll be served as they grow up.
Suggested retail prices range from about $1.35 to $1.49.
   Ms. Pigot and Ms. Ivarsson said they're trying to help women who
get involved in the business. The board members are women and the
majority of the company stockholders are women.
   ``I don't know if you'd call it feminist, but our philosophy was
that if we have the opportunity to help women, good,'' Ms. Pigott
said.
   The company faces tough competition from other baby food
manufacturers, particularly the Fremont, Mich.-based Gerber Product
Co., which controls 70 percent of the baby food market, said Gerber
spokeswoman Barbara Ivens.
   Gerber's baby foods have no additives except water for making
puree, Ms. Ivens said. Only the desserts have sugar added and some
of the fruits have added vitamin C, she said.

<TEXT>
   A man was found guilty of first-degree murder
Friday in the killing of a church volunteer, more than two years
after he was captured in the longest manhunt in Missouri history.
   The jury deliberated for 2{ hours before returning the verdict
against John David Brown, 35, in Phelps County Circuit Court.
   The penalty phase of the two-week trial is scheduled to begin at
9:30 a.m. Saturday, and the state is asking for the death penalty.
The jury can recommend either death or life imprisonment.
   Tim Finnical, an assistant attorney general and the lead
prosecutor in the case, said testimony from ballistics experts
showed the gun Brown had when he was arrested in Ada, Okla., was
the one that killed caretaker Claude Long in a Doolittle church on
April 1, 1987.
   ``Circumstantial evidence conclusively _ conclusively _ proves
John David Brown murdered this man,'' Finnical told the jury.
   Brown's attorney, Brad Kessler, had questioned the validity of
the ballistics results. ``What you have here is the state grasping
at straws. They have to put someone in the church,'' Kessler said.
   At the time Long was killed, Brown was the subject of a massive
manhunt after a man matching his description fled from a Rolla
motel room a few days earlier. A police officer was wounded in that
incident.

   A teen-ager accidentally set fire to his
family's home while trying to kill bugs on a porch, officials said.
   The fire started when the 14-year-old boy lit insect repellent
after spraying it on the bugs, said Boulder County Sheriff's Capt.
George Epp.
   The flames ignited bushes, then shot up and covered the front
porch and its roof and burned into the wall of a second-floor
bedroom. Thursday's fire caused about $40,000 damage to the
Frederick McGehan home, said Epp.
   No one was injured. A cat, two dogs, a parakeet and a guinea pig
were saved from the smoke-filled house, officials said.
   The boy was not identified.

<TEXT>
   More than 1,100 descendants of a
little bay horse foaled 200 years ago trotted, danced or even
popped out of a cake in honor of their breed.
   Maryland breeder W. Dayton Sumner, manager of the 50th annual
New England Morgan Horse Show, said the six-day spectacle was a
sort of homecoming for the first uniquely American breed of horse.
   ``The Morgans appeal is as universal as his versatility,'' said
Laura Frizzel of Davison, Md., awarding a citation and bottle of
champagne to a group of enthusiasts in straw hats and jeans who
hitched a trio of high-stepping Morgans to a hay wagon and joined
the fancy carriage parade through downtown Thursday evening.
   First prize went to Delaware millionaire Henry E.I. Dupont and
his wife in an ornate antique hunting carriage, drawn by four coal
black Morgans. As they rolled smoothly down Main Street one of the
three grooms in top hat and tails sounded a cheery flourish on an
long, brass hunting horn.
   Morgans, who are equally at home in hunt clubs, isolated cattle
ranches or helping the police maintain order on city streets,
reflect the all-around characteristics that endeared them to New
England farmers.
   They wanted and got a horse strong enough to pull a plow, small
enough to require little maintenance, and fast enough to ride.
   A bronze plaque on a granite boulder along a street in suburban
West Springfield a few miles down the Connecticut River marks the
beginning of what the inscription simply calls ``that useful
breed'' in 1789.
   The small, dark horse, with black mane, tail and feet, who
bestowed his characteristics on more than 100,000 descendants,
originally was named Figure by Justin Morgan, the schoolteacher and
singing master who raised and raced him in western Massachusetts
and Vermont.
   His lineage is unclear, but some Morgan historians believe he
may have been sired by a Tory colonel's part-Arabian, part-English
thoroughbred stallion ``liberated'' during the Revolutionary War by
farmers in retaliation for raids on their livestock.

<TEXT>
   The Washington Post and Newspaper Guild have
reached a tentative five-year contract, three years after the last
agreement expired, the newspaper reported Saturday.
   The contract covers 1,420 newsroom employees and white-collar
workers. Management declared negotiations at an impasse two years
ago.
   Members of the Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild will vote on
the agreement Monday. The union bargaining committee has
recommended ratification.
   The Post said the contract would increase weekly salaries
between 4 percent and 6 percent, with lower-paid workers receiving
a higher percentage increase along with an improvement in
minimum-salary scales.
   Employees who make more than $50,000 a year, which includes most
of the paper's news and editorial workers, will have increases of
about $42.50 per week during the first three years of the contract,
with similar increases expected in the final two years, the Post
said.
   The agreement also calls for improvements in pension and
disability-insurance plans and better medical and dental coverage.
It provides several provisions for resolving worker-management
disputes and a no-strike, no-lockout clause.
   The worker-management clause is believed to be the first such
clause in the 51 years the Guild has bargained on behalf of Post
employees.
   The contract covers newsroom, accounting, advertising,
circulation and data-processing employees, as well as some workers
in other business departments.

<HEAD>Bush Firm on Defense; Willing to Compromise on Capital Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, facing battles with Congress
on several fronts, says he's standing firm on his military spending
plan but is willing to compromise on his proposal to cut the
capital gains tax.
   Bush insisted Friday that he will be able to have his way with
the Senate on his defense package even after the House this week
shredded it, slashing key components such as Star Wars, the stealth
bomber, mobile MX missile and Midgetman missile.
   ``I am disappointed that the House did what they did,'' Bush
told a news conference, noting that the chamber restored money for
some programs he wants to cut.
   ``Yesterday was not the House's most memorable moment, but we're
going to keep fighting on for what we believe in.''
   But Bush said he's willing to look at alternatives on his
proposal to cut the 33 percent maximum capital-gains rate to 15
percent.
   ``If there's some compromise that can spur investment, spur
jobs, increase employment _ the cause of new jobs starting up _ I'd
be interested in it,'' Bush said. ``I don't think I should ever say
it's got to be done just this way in terms of the bills up there in
the House Ways and Means Committee right now.''
   On another topic, Bush decried news leaks in the espionage
investigation of U.S. diplomat Felix S. Bloch.
   ``I don't want to go into it while it is under investigation,''
Bush said when asked about specifics.
   ``I am very concerned about premature discussion and disclosure
_ that means leaks _ on this matter, because I think you can
jeopardize the case itself and perhaps the man's ability to get a
fair hearing.''
   No charges have been filed against Bloch, but the State
Department revoked his diplomatic passport and put him on paid
leave June 22. He is under heavy FBI surveillance.
   Regarding the House's slash of $1.8 billion from his $4.9
billion military spending request, Bush reaffirmed his commitment
to his ``solid strategic program.''
   He said he will fight to win Senate support to counter the House
measure, and that he needs everything he's proposing to strengthen
his arms control position in talks with the Soviet Union.
   Bush also said:
   _He's confident his multibillion-dollar bailout plan for the
savings and loan industry will prevail, despite a House-Senate
conference agreement this week that rejected a key funding
mechanism on which he has insisted.
   _Attacks on his nominee to head the Justice Department's civil
rights division, William Lucas, are ``pure gut politics.'' He said
he staunchly supports Lucas, who critics say is unqualified.
   _He still wants a constitutional amendment to ban burning of the
American flag, but didn't answer directly when asked if he would
settle for a Democratic-sponsored effort, passed this week by the
House Judiciary Committee, to outlaw flag burning through a statute
rather than amending the Constitution.
   ``I will see what comes down here, but I will continue to push
for the approach that I think is the best, given the Supreme Court
decision,'' he said.
   _He did not condone the kidnapping of a Shiite Moslem leader by
Israeli commandos in Lebanon and doesn't know if it may lead to
freedom for an American hostage.
   _He was frustrated over the U.S. inability to get Panamanian
ruler Manuel Noriega out of power.
   _He would not respond to harsh criticisms leveled by outgoing
Customs Commissioner William von Raab, who said he saw a lack of
commitment or interest in the departments of State and Treasury on
fighting the drug war.
   Bush said the real question is, ``How do we do better.?''

   Radio is being ill-served by ``voodoo
priests'' at the Federal Communications Commission who seem to
think just about anyone should be able to own a station, a
broadcasting lobbyist says.
   A deregulation-minded FCC has been kind to broadcasters in many
ways during the 1980s, but has sometimes gone too far in its rush
to impose a free-market ethic, said Edward O. Fritts, president of
the National Association of Broadcasters.
   ``If there were a modern-day Rip Van Winkle broadcaster who had
gone to sleep in 1980 and reawakened this year, he would scarcely
believe the changes,'' Fritts said in remarks prepared for delivery
today at the Idaho State Association of Broadcasters meeting in Sun
Valley.
   ``The entire communications landscape has changed,'' he said.
``Deregulation has come faster and gone farther than our industry
ever asked or dreamed of.''
   Under FCC Chairman Mark S. Fowler and his predecessor, Dennis R.
Patrick, the Fairness Doctrine has been lifted and broadcasters
received favorable improvements in the license-renewal process.
   Fritts said broadcasters were grateful for those victories, but
that the FCC has caused other headaches.
   Noting that the FCC loosened rules for acquiring radio station
licenses, Fritts said it appeared the commission had ``become so
obsessed with regulation by marketplace economic theory that it
seemingly is interested in providing every man, woman and child
with their own radio station.''
   ``Ole Rip would be surprised that the FCC has no apparent
concern for preserving the system of local service by financially
healthy stations that has served the American public so well for
the past 70 years,'' he said. ``Our awakening broadcaster would
think his world was being ruled by voodoo priests.
   ``As a result of the FCC's Alice-in-Wonderland allocations
policies, it is faced with a growing backlog of applications for
new facilities and minor station modifications.
   Fritts said an FCC official acknowledged recently that a new
ruling allowing increased power for small FM stations may increase
the application backlog from six months to 18 months.
   And it was particularly galling to broadcasters, he said, that
even as the backlog grows, a deficit-conscious Congress wants to
increase application fees by 13 percent.
   Fritts lashed out at FCC proposals to hold lotteries, auctions
and private negotiations to allocate and assign station licenses.
   ``How can the commission say with a straight face that is can
choose broadcast applicants who will best serve the public interest
by reading ping-pong balls or conducting lotteries?''
   The FCC, Fritts said, ``has allowed so many new stations on the
AM band that it has created destructive interference and undermined
the financial health of many stations to the determinant of local
service.''

   A former HUD official says he made
recommendations that ``ultimately benefited'' people with whom he
now works, and a congressman is calling for a Justice Department
investigation.
   Joseph Monticciolo, former New York regional administrator for
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, was grilled Friday
by members of a House subcommittee investigating allegations of
wrongdoing at HUD.
   He denied any wrongdoing during his seven-year HUD tenure, but
was harshly questioned by Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., about a
1984 memo in which Monticciolo had made recommendations about a
company he later joined.
   ``I made recommendations to Washington that ultimately benefited
people who are now partners of mine,'' Monticciolo said, adding
that the final decision came from Washington.
   ``I'm going to have people look at what you've done because
there was a quid pro quo,'' Shays said. ``I'm hopeful and I would
expect that the attorney general's office will look into what
you've done because you've cashed in.''
   Monticciolo is chief executive of Eagle Capital Group, a real
estate development company with contracts in Rockland County, N.Y.,
Puerto Rico and New Jersey.
   Some of the partners were involved in a controversial 1983 deal
in which they bought seven HUD properties in New York and
Connecticut valued at $10.5 million price but put up only $550,000.
   The developers later sold the property, making a reported $17
million profit.
   Monticciolo said he had made recommendations to HUD that
benefited the developers, who later hired him for a $125,000-a-year
job and made him a 15 percent partner for no up-front cash.
   At one point, Monticciolo told the panel that HUD's Section 8
moderate rehabilitation program was ``50 percent political,'' with
half the money going to developers who were GOP contributors or
well-connected to the administration. Monticciolo also said he had
never recommended a project for that program, which has been
suspended.
   But when Shays confronted him with a HUD memo about several such
projects in New York and Puerto Rico _ Monticciolo's region _ the
former administrator admitted having discussed the projects with
the public housing authorities.
   ``We can't rely on a thing you said,'' Rep. Bruce Morrison,
D-Conn., said. ``You say one thing when you don't have the document
and when the document is in front of you, you say something
diametrically opposed.''
   Lance Wilson, former executive assistant to then HUD Secretary
Samuel Pierce, was to have been the first witness Friday but he
failed to show up.
   Wilson had asked for a postponement in his voluntary appearance
because his lawyer was in the hospital. It was the third time
Wilson had asked for an extension.
   Subcommittee Chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said the panel would
vote Wednesday on issuing a subpoena for Wilson to appear Sept. 27

<HEAD>Dole Offers Compromise All-Crops Disaster Relief Proposal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After a week of partisan bickering, farm-state
senators are inching toward compromise on legislation to provide
federal payments to producers suffering crop losses from drought
and other weather-related damage.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas dropped his
opposition Friday to an across-the-board disaster relief package
and offered a proposal that a Democratic leader said could clear
the way for a bipartisan agreement.
   ``Sen. Dole's flexibility will lead to an agreement on a final
package that treats all farmers fairly,'' Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said in a
statement.
   ``We are moving toward common ground that fairly covers all
demonstrated crop losses within reasonable spending levels.''
   Dole had been leading opposition to a Democratic-sponsored
measure providing $955 million to cover weather-related crop losses.
   Dole's proposal, estimated to cost $891 million, would provide
more assistance to farmers of the major grains who bought federal
crop insurance and less to the hundreds of other commodities _ the
so-called non-program crops _ because they are not covered by
federal subsidy and price support programs.
   The Bush administration has said about $870 million in
agricultural budget savings could be used for farm disaster relief.
   So far, the dispute in the Senate has been over what crops
should qualify for federal payments. But pressure is building on
lawmakers to take action.
   Congress is scheduled to recess Aug. 5 for a month-long
vacation, and most farm-state members don't want to return home
without having sent an aid bill to the White House.
   Dole has complained that the Democratic measure, approved by the
Agriculture Committee on a party-line vote earlier in the week, was
potentially too expensive because it covered more than 500 crops.
But he moved closer to the Democratic package Friday with his
compromise proposal.
   Faring best under Dole's proposal would be producers of wheat,
cotton, rice, corn and other crops participating in federal
commodity programs and those who bought federal crop insurance.
They would be eligible for assistance on losses above 35 percent,
with payments covering 65 percent of their lost income.
   Farmers without crop insurance, but enrolled in the federal farm
programs, would have to suffer losses of at least 40 percent, under
Dole's plan. Peanuts, tobacco and sugar beet growers would be
covered by the same provision.
   Soybean and sunflower farmers would be eligible for assistance
if they suffered losses above 45 percent.
   Most crops not covered by government commodity programs,
everything from peaches and cherries to dry edible beans and
potatoes, must suffer losses exceeding 50 percent and would then
receive payments covering 50 percent of the producer's lost income.
   The same 50-50 formula would apply to farmers who are not
enrolled in federal commodity programs but grow wheat, corn, grain
sorghum and other so-called program crops.
   Under the Democratic package, farmers with crops enrolled in
government commodity programs would qualify for assistance if they
suffered 40 percent losses. Farmers of other crops would have to
show a 45 percent loss. The measure provided 65 percent payments
for both.
   A $1 billion disaster relief bill passed by the House last month
would require a minimum loss of 35 percent for any crop to receive
assistance.

<HEAD>Soviet Marshal Says USSR Can Keep Pace With Stealth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top military adviser to Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev says the B-2 stealth bomber won't give the United
States an edge over the Soviets.
   ``For every action in life there is a reaction,'' Soviet Marshal
Sergei Akhromeyev told the National Press Club on Friday.
   ``So if the creation, development and deployment of the B-2 is
an action, in one way or another there will be some sort of
reaction from the Soviet Union.''
   The House this week voted to suspend production of the B-2 until
the Pentagon scales back the high-priced program, and said the
administration must show the stealth can successfully evade radar
detection and penetrate Soviet airspace before production resumes.
   Bush and his defense officials have lobbied hard for the bomber
as a highly advanced piece of technology that would outstrip Soviet
radar capabilities.
   Akhromeyev's speech and question-and-answer session was the
first by a senior Soviet official at the Press Club since Premier
Nikita Krushchev in 1959.
   Akhromeyev told an audience that included Adm. William J. Crowe,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that the trip in which he
gave historic testimony to Congress had encouraged him that Soviet
relations with the United States will continue to improve.
   Still, he said that while the decrease in tension between NATO
and Warsaw Pact countries was ``a tremendous accomplishment ... the
military threat, unfortunately, is still there.''
   Akhromeyev, wearing his Red Army uniform with 11 rows of
ribbons, went from the Press Club to a private White House meeting
with President Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.

<HEAD>Holy Censorship! Film Board Bans Children Under 12 From Seeing Batman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Batman'' is winging its way to Britain, but
youngsters under 12 will have to stick to comic books to catch the
Caped Crusader. The national film board says the popular movie is
unsuitable for little kids.
   The British Board of Film Classification applied its new ``12''
category to the movie that opens Aug. 11 in Britain, with Michael
Keaton playing the title role and Jack Nicholson starring as his
evil nemesis, the Joker.
   The category bars youngsters under 12 from a film no matter what
parents decide. In the United States, the comparable PG-13 is only
an advisory guideline for parents, while the R rating restricts
minors from seeing a particular movie.
   A spokesman for filmmaker Warner Brothers said the British
decision was ``quite in keeping with the nature of the film. It is
for the producers to decide what kind of film they wish to make and
what they have come up with is not like the old comic strip
television series from the '60s. This Batman comes out at night.''
   A film board spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity in
keeping with British practice, said the new designation was created
because the old ``15'' classification wound up keeping children
between the ages of 12 and 14 out of movies that may be suitable
for them.
   Early Times, a children's newspaper, said: ``We are concerned
that many children under 12, in the light of the hype and publicity
over Batman, will be bitterly disappointed over the rating of this
film as 12 Certificate particularly as the impression has been
created that it is a summer family film.''

<HEAD>Judge Says Wildlife Case Strong, Orders Administration to Explain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has four days to
explain why it suspended rules designed to protect endangered
species of sea turtles after protests by shrimp fishermen in
Louisiana and Texas.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Hogan on Friday refused to
grant an order sought by the National Wildlife Federation to
require the government immediately to enforce the suspended
regulations for Gulf Coast shrimp fishermen.
   But Hogan called the federation's case ``a strong one'' and said
the government has until Tuesday to detail under what legal
authority Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher suspended the
regulations. Hogan scheduled another hearing for Thursday.
   Justice Department lawyer Michelle Kuruc said at a hearing that
the basis for Mosbacher's action was that public safety was
endangered by the protests.
   Bob Irvin, a wildlife federation lawyer, said he was
disappointed that the judge had denied the order, but was
encouraged by his comments that the wildlife group had a strong
case.
   The rules suspended Monday would have required the use of
devices that keep sea turtles from becoming entangled in trawlers'
nets.
   Instead, Mosbacher said shrimpers in 45 days would have to obey
still another set of rules requiring them to lift their nets every
90 minutes or sooner so turtles can escape. Turtles can live that
long if trapped, according to members of Congress supporting the
shrimpers.
   Before the court hearing, the National Audubon Society and the
Defenders of Wildlife called for a nationwide boycott of shrimp to
protest the fishermen's tactics.
   The suit, filed Tuesday, said Mosbacher was inflicting
irreparable harm on five species of sea turtles that are listed as
threatened or endangered.
   The National Marine Fisheries Service estimates that 11,000
turtles die each year in shrimpers' nets.
   Last weekend, angry shrimpers used their boats to block ship
channels along the Texas and Louisiana coasts. Gunfire was reported
in both states and four shrimpers were arrested in Texas. Two
recreational boaters were hospitalized briefly for minor injuries
after trying to run the blockade Saturday in Louisiana.

   President Bush says the government will do
whatever it can to find out if American servicemen are still being
held in Southeast Asia.
   ``We will do everything that a government can to recover the
missing, and if we discover proof of captivity, we will take action
to bring our men home,'' Bush said Friday in a speech to the
National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in
Southeast Asia.
   The league says 2,348 Americans remain missing or unaccounted
for as a result of the conflict in Southeast Asia. Most _ 1,714 _
are in Vietnam. The rest are in Laos, Cambodia and China.
   Bush called on Hanoi to ``shed light'' on the fate of the
missing, and said the pace of restoring diplomatic relations with
Vietnam could be impeded unless that country cooperates on the
POW-MIA issue.
   Some of those attending the meeting sai they were discouraged.
   ``I don't believe this is a top priority,'' said Lorene Walker,
61, of Rapid City, S.D., whose son, Bruce, has been missing for 17
years.
   ``I think perhaps we are making progress, but, my God, after 20
years we ought to make a little,'' he said.

<HEAD>Airline Smoking Ban Permanent Under Committee-Passed Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ban on smoking aboard airline flights of two
hours or less would become permanent under a bill sent to the House
floor, but anti-smoking forces say they expect tougher restrictions
in the final bill.
   Tobacco industry lobbyists ended up pushing for the permanent
ban Friday after a 25-25 vote on a ban that would have covered all
domestic flights indicated growing congressional support for
proposals to broaden the airline smoking ban.
   The tie vote defeated the wider ban, but it was the closest a
congressional vote has come to outlawing all smoking on airliners.
   The bill, passed on a voice vote by the House Public Works and
Transportation Committee, is one of several proposals to extend or
expand the 1987 temporary smoking ban on flights of two hours or
less. That ban expires in April.
   Opponents made tongue-in-cheek suggestions that liquor, cheap
cologne and crying babies could also be banned because they offend
some people.
   Rep. William Clinger, R-Pa., who supported the permanent ban but
opposed all proposals that would affect flights over two hours,
joked that the committee might vote to ``install cheap cologne
detectors and put crying babies in the hold.''
   Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., who pushed for a total smoking
ban, said the committee's defeat of attempts to apply the ban to
longer flights reflects strong lobbying by the tobacco industry.
   Oberstar said a more far-reaching ban would likely pass the
House but he declined to predict what the Senate might do.
   One of the measures to extend the smoking ban is in the form of
an amendment to an appropriations bill. The House is expected to
take that up next week.
   Oberstar described Friday's vote as a ``short-term gain'' for
the tobacco industry, which at first opposed making the two-hour
ban permanent. However, several tobacco lobbyists switched
strategies as the committee was voting.
   In the end, pro-smoking forces supported a permanent ban while
anti-smoking committee members voted for a four-year extension of
the temporary ban in the hope of ensuring that Congress again would
have to consider a total ban.
   Anti-smoking groups have said they will continue to fight
against smoking on any airliner.
   ``The two-hour ban is far from a perfect piece of legislation
and very far from the solution needed to protect all airline
passengers and all flight crews from the serious hazards created by
tobacco smoke in the airline cabin,'' said Ahron Leichtman,
president of Citizens Against Tobacco Smoke.
   Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., who said his wife of 34 years died from
cancer, called in-flight smoking a life-and-death issue.
   ``On an airplane, you can't open the window when someone else
smokes. In midair, you can't transfer planes,'' Savage said.
``Rights are for now, but death is forever.''

<HEAD>Abduction of Shiite Leader Could Lead to Release of Hostages, Israel
Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The kidnapping of a Shiite Moslem cleric by
Israeli commandos could put pressure on pro-Iranian terrorists to
free some of the foreign hostages held in Lebanon, according to
Israeli officials.
   ``Clearly when you capture one of their top leaders it can deter
terrorism and you have a certain amount of leverage in your
hands,'' Army spokesman Col. Raanan Gissin said of Friday's raid by
helicopter-borne commandos.
   Seized by the commandos were cleric Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, his
cousin Ahmed Obeid and a friend, Majid Fahs, a Lebanese police
spokesman told reporters.
   Gissin said Obeid and two ``assistants'' were ``safely in
Israeli hands and undergoing questioning.''
   One person was killed in the assault on an apartment building in
the village of Jibchit, 20 miles north of the Israeli border and 35
miles south of Beirut, according to Lebanese and Israeli reports.
   Lebanese police said a neighbor, Hussein Abu Zeid, opened the
door of his apartment during the raid and was shot to death by the
commandos. Israel radio said Zeid was one of Obeid's bodyguards.
   Even before Friday's abductions, some Israeli officials said the
capture of a Lebanese Shiite leader supported by Iran could
influence the release of three Israeli servicemen kidnapped in
southern Lebanon in 1986.
   Lebanese security sources suggested Obeid may have been abducted
in a plan to exchange him for U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins or other foreign hostages. The sources also have linked
Obeid with Higgins' abduction.
   Higgins, of Danville, Ky., was kidnapped in southern Lebanon
Feb. 17, 1988, while serving with an observer group attached to the
U.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon.
   Seventeen foreign hostages are held in Lebanon, including nine
Americans and three Britons but not counting the Israeli
servicemen. It is belived most of the hostages are captives of
pro-Iranian terrorist groups affiliated with Hezbollah, or Party of
God.
   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, has been held the longest. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985, and a Shiite Moslem group, Islamic Holy War, has said it
is holding him.
   Gissin called Obeid the ``equivalent of the commander of the
(Hezbollah) terrorist organization in South Lebanon.''
   Obeid, 33, has denied involvment with the fundamenalist Islamic
group but Israel and the U.S. State Department have called him a
member of Hezbollah.
   Britain's Foreign Office deplored the kidnapping, saying it
could jeopardize the lives of the foreign hostages and called for
his release.
   Gissin disagreed and said Hezbollah leaders will ``now think
twice before harming their hostages.''
   ``They value the lives of their leaders far more then they value
the lives of their suicide fighters,'' he added.
   Gissen said Hezbollah guerrillas have attempted at least 20
cross-border raids into Israel this year.
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman told reporters, ``Israel
said many times in the past that when the fight against terrorism
is at stake, it reserves the right to respond whenever it finds it
suitable and effective.''
   The three Israeli troopers believed held hostage in Lebanon are
soldiers Rahamim Alsheikh and Yossi Fink, captured Feb. 17, 1986,
when guerrillas ambushed their patrol, and air force navigator Ron
Arad seized Oct. 16, 1986, when his plane was shot down.
   Lebanese police, the Israeli news media and witnesses gave these
accounts of the Jibchit raid:
   Three helicopters took part in the operation. About 12 commandos
with silencer-equipped pistols surrounded Obeid's building and
forced their way into his apartment.
   Israeli television said the troopers blasted the front door of
Obeid's apartment with plastic explosives, seized Obeid and the
other men and rushed them to a helicopter that departed in the
attack that lasted less then 30 minutes.
   Obeid's wife, Mona, was locked in a room with her hands tied and
her mouth taped shut.
   Iran's Foreign Ministry issued a statment saying, ``This
shameless act by the Zionist regime will not remain unanswered by
the Moslem and combatant forces.''

eats fried chicken, which made him a millionaire.
   At 55, with his heart mending, he said he intends to eat less,
exercise more, condense his business interests and devote more time
to his family.
   Coronary heart disease led him to quadruple bypass surgery this

   ``I feel like I've gotten a second chance. I'm really very
happy, very optimistic,'' he said in a recent interview. ``I
realized one thing. You can't cheat the system.''
   For many years, Brown worked hard and played hard. He drank,
smoked, traveled and gambled.
   Brown said he has started walking for exercise and is often
accompanied by his wife, Phyllis George Brown, the former Miss
America and TV anchorwoman.
   Brown sold Kentucky Fried Chicken in 1971 but still has several

   Former first lady Nancy Reagan launched the
latest phase of her anti-drug crusade with a visit to a drug
rehabilitation center.
   After meeting with female clients and their children at the Via
Avanta drug center, Mrs. Reagan said her foundation would
distribute grants to similar centers in the Los Angeles area,
although Via Avanta won't be considered for a grant this year.
   The grants will begin small and grow according to contributions,
Mrs. Reagan said Thursday.
   The live-in center is one of a handful in California that caters
to women who have children or are pregnant.
   ``I've never seen this kind of a program before ... they tell me
there are a couple of others,'' Mrs. Reagan said. ``I think it's
very important, especially for young mothers.''
   Meanwhile, former President Reagan, accompanied by Secret
Service agents and publisher Malcolm Forbes, visited the all-male
Bohemian Club in Santa Rosa.
   Reagan has been a member for years at the exclusive club, a
2,700-acre grove near the community of Monte Rio about 15 miles
west of Santa Rosa.
   Reagan arrived Friday. It was not known how long he planned to

   More than half of all Japanese suffer from stress
caused by work or relationships, but men are more likely to drink
and women more likely to shop to deal with it, a government survey
said today.
   According to the Health and Welfare Ministry's national survey,
conducted June 1988 among Japanese over 12 years of age, almost 52
percent of 36,146 people said they feel stress in their daily lives.
   More than 70 percent answered they can handle stress, but 10
percent said they were overwhelmed, the ministry report said.
   While 49.2 percent of 17,692 men said they feel stress, 54.4
percent of 18,454 women said they do.
   The survey pointed out men and women try to release stress
differently. While drinking, exercise, television and radio were
major remedies for men, chatting, idle time and shopping were the
top three remedies for women.

<TEXT>
   The daily raising of China's scarlet flag in
Tiananmen Square used to draw a motley audience of dozens and cause
small, brief traffic jams in the bicycle lane adjoining the square.
   All-night food vendors, street sweepers, pedicab drivers,
drifters _ anyone who happened to be up _ would gather at the
flagpole to watch three soldiers goose-step out of the imperial
palace and march into the square to raise the flag.
   These days, however, watching the national flag go up requires
an invitation or advance permission.
   The square has been closed to the general public since June 4,
when the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement began and soldiers
backed by tanks drove student protesters from the square, the
symbolic center of China. Bicyclists now are forbidden to stop
along its edge.
   Today, about a dozen foreign journalists and more than 80
children from the Wangfujing Elementary School had permission to
watch the flag raising.
   The students wore the red kerchiefs of the Young Pioneers, the
Communist Party children's organization, and their teacher said
they were there to ``learn to love the country and love the army.''
   The children marched silently onto the 100-acre square, led by a
half-dozen young soldiers who barked commands at them: ``Forward.
Right face. Sit.''
   Except for the soldiers and city buses that lumbered by, the
still-dark square was silent. At the far end, on the monument to
revolutionary heroes that the students had turned into a protest
command post, two soldiers stood guard while six comrades napped,
wrapped up in bedrolls on the stone pavement.
   At 5:30 a.m., the square's lights blinked off and the children
sat silently on the pavement. At 5:52 a.m., 12 minutes later than
scheduled, three soldiers emerged from the palace gate bearing the
flag.
   The ceremony has been modified since June 4 _ two other soldiers
stood guard with submachine guns.
   Upon order, the children raised their right arms in salute as
the flag went up. The few without neckerchiefs stood with arms at
their sides, apparently not allowed the honor of saluting their
flag.
   A few silent minutes, and it was over. The children sat back
down for a brief lecture by a white-gloved soldier on the history
of China's flag. ``It is the color of fresh blood,'' he told the
students, reminding them of the bloody civil war that preceded the
Communist rise to power.
   A quick march around the square, and the children were off to
school. Officers roused the sleeping soldiers with shouts of
``Hey.'' Bedrolls under their arms, they stumbled off the monument.
   Before June 4, sunrise was the signal for dozens of pedestrians
to stream onto the square to take their morning exercise and enjoy
the freshest air of the day.
   Today, more than 50 army trucks, each bearing about 36 soldiers,
pulled up in rows on one side of the vast expanse.
   ``They are here to see the (Mao Tse-tung) memorial hall and the
Great Hall of the People and Zhongnanhai,'' the party headquarters,
said an officer, who refused to identify the unit. ``It's a good
chance for them to see these things they would not otherwise see.''
   The memorial hall, where revolutionary leader Mao's preserved
body is exhibited, has been closed to the public since the building
underwent repairs over the winter. When will it and the square
reopen?
   ``I don't know. I'm sure sooner or later,'' the officer said.

   President Bush says he'll do his best to make
sure that Exxon lives up to its responsibility to clean the
oil-soaked shores of Alaska.
   ``If I had the feeling Exxon was going to pull back on an
agreement or fail to fulfill an agreement they'd made with us, with
the government, or with the state of Alaska, I would ... try my
best to do something about it,'' Bush said at a news conference
Friday.
   The president's remarks came hours after Exxon executives told a
congressional panel that the company will suspend cleanup
operations for the winter by mid-September.
   However, company officials said they would agree to any
``reasonable'' continuation of the cleanup next spring.
   More than 700 miles of shoreline have been damaged as a result
of the March spill of nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil from
the tanker Exxon Valdez in the nation's worst oil spill.
   U.S. Coast Guard Vice Adm. Clyde Lusk told the interior
subcommittee on water, power and offshore energy resources that he
expected that there would be ``disagreements on what should be
done,'' with differences in opinion as to what constitutes a clean
beach.
   ``What is clean?'' Lusk asked. ``I don't know how we're going to
make that decision.''
   Exxon's plans have been questioned since the disclosure earlier
this week of an internal memorandum that said ``no commitment
should be made'' on when to suspend or resume cleanup.
   Alaska officials interpreted the July 19 memo as an indication
Exxon was preparing to pull out, even though the cleanup is far
from completed.
   Bush, asked by reporters about the matter, said he expected
Exxon to live up to its commitment.
   The brouhaha prompted Friday's subcommittee hearing.
   The memo, written by the manager of Exxon's cleanup operation in
Alaska, ``suggests Exxon is putting together its plan for
demobilization without Coast Guard approval,'' said subcommittee
Chairman George Miller, D-Calif.
   W.D. Stevens, president of Exxon Co. USA, called the wording of
the memo ``unfortunate.''
   The company, he said, will withdraw its equipment and estimated
10,000 workers from the region beginning Sept. 15 because of
potential safety problems with rough seas and weather.
   Exxon will return ``in the spring of 1990 to reinspect the area,
to assure that the job has been properly done, and if not, to put
it right,'' Stevens said.
   But when Miller pressed him about whether Exxon will resume
cleanup in the spring, Stevens said he couldn't give ``an
unequivocal commitment.''
   ``I think it would be naive to do that,'' he said. ``We will
follow through on any reasonable request that is made'' by the
Coast Guard.
   Lusk said federal and state officials, as well as scientists and
Exxon representatives, would participate in the inspection next
spring. But the Coast Guard has no authority to require Exxon to do
additional cleaning at specific sites, he said.
   Exxon executives said Friday that about 600 miles of
contaminated shoreline had been treated, but Alaska's chief
environmental official put the figure at about 190 miles saying
that in many cases oil has seeped back into the rocks and pebbles.
   ``We cannot imagine how Exxon can conclude 600 miles have been
treated,'' said Dennis Kelso, the commissioner of Alaska's
Department of Environmental Conservation.
   ``If that statement were made in Kodiak or Homer the roof would
rise. Maybe they're looking at a different gulf.''

   Eskimos from four nations, guarding a
tradition of hunting and fur trading, criticized animal
conservationists for threatening the culture of Arctic people.
   Rosemarie Kuptana, vice president of the Inuit Circumpolar
Conference, urged delegates to force environmentalists and animal
conservationists ``to answer our arguments,'' the Greenland
newspaper Information reported Friday.
   ``Our opponents are much weeker when it is we who set the
agenda,'' Ms. Kuptana, a Canadian, told the 500 Inuit delegates at
a conference's meeting in Sisimuit, West Greenland.
   It was the first time a Soviet delegation attended a general
assembly of the conference, a non-governmental organization for
Inuit from Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Soviet Union.
   Anger is growing among Arctic natives toward conservationist
groups such as Greenpeace, whose campaigns the Eskimos say have
damaged hunting and the fur trade.
   ``It never ceases to amaze me how people can react so strongly
against traditional hunting on the part of a little group of
indigenous people _ people who during thousands of years of hunting
never have threatened a single animal species _ while at the same
time industrialized society has polluted the planet to such a
degree that there is no way back,'' Ms. Kuptana said.
   Greenpeace's Kirsten Sander, who attended the conference as an
observer, admitted that the group's campaign against seal skins in
recent years had done unintended harm to Inuit hunters.
   To counter future anti-harvesting campaigns, the conference
unveiled a far-reaching Inuit conservation strategy.
   This policy, largely the initiative of conference members from
Canada and Greenland, embraces all aspects of environmental concern
in the Arctic.
   Peter Jull, a former Inuit adviser to the Canadian government,
said the document calls for detailed research on the environment
and wildlife, including all species that Inuits depend on for food
and clothing.
   He said the plan was partly ``an expression that the environment
is our interest and not just for the benefit of companies down
south somewhere.''
   The conference also compiled a guide of policy principles on
issues including nuclear power, education and self-government for
use at the regional and local levels.
   ``What we're basically saying is that we live in the Arctic and
we know what happens when you mess it up,'' Jull said.
   About 40,000 Inuit live in Greenland, 28,000 in Alaska and
11,000 in Canada. The Soviet Inuit comprise a small part of the
150,000 natives of the Siberian north.

   The Environmental Protection Agency levied
$235,500 in fines against four companies for allegedly violating
federal laws in connection with the use or manufacture of toxic
chemicals.
   In two of the cases, the fines were reduced because the
violations were voluntarily disclosed, the EPA said Friday.
   The penalties were:
   _$112,500 against 3-V Chemical Corp., of Charlotte, N.C., for
illegally importing chemicals not on the federal approved list,
improper certification of a chemical, and failure to notify an
intention to test a chemical. The fine was reduced by 25 percent
because the infraction was voluntarily reported.
   _$85,000 against Cavedon Chemical Co. Inc., of Woonsocket, R.I.,
for failing to notify the EPA of its intention to manufacture four
chemical substances. The company reported the violation and had its
fine reduced by 50 percent.
   _$28,000 against Surface Coatings Inc., of Wilmington, Mass.,
for failing to properly notify the EPA of the manufacturer of seven
chemical substances.
   _$10,000 against Howard Hall International of Cos Cob, Conn.,
for illegally importing a chemical not on the federally approved
list.

<NOTE>FDA Will Study Changes in Food Labels</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration will consider
major changes in the way foods are labeled.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan aid Friday
that the FDA review will cover nutrition labeling, ingredient
labeling, the format of labels as well as manufacturers'
descriptions of foods and the health messages they put on their
products.
   The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act was introduced Thursday
in Congress amid criticism from lawmakers that the FDA was moving
too slowly on the issue. Hearings on the bill are expected to begin
next week.
   The measure would make nutrition labeling mandatory, require
disclosure of certain information such as the amount of fiber, fat
and cholesterol and provide uniform standards for food descriptions
such as ``lite'' and ``cholesterol-free.''
   The FDA said it will hold three or four public hearings across
the country beginning in the fall ``to find out what consumers want
and need on food labels.'' The FDA is expected to propose new
federal rules on food labeling early next year.
   The FDA requires certain food labeling, including such
information as ingredients and net weight on packaged foods. About
55 percent of packaged foods include information on labels about
the nutrition of the foods.

<NOTE>Post, Guild Reach Tentative Agreement</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the Newspaper Guild will vote
Monday on a five-year contract with The Washington Post, the
newspaper reported today.
   The contract, which covers 1,420 newsroom employees and
white-collar workers, comes three years after the last pact
expired. Management declared negotiations at an impasse two years
ago.
   The Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild bargaining committee
has recommended that its members ratify the contract.
   The Post said the contract would increase weekly salaries
between 4 percent and 6 percent, with lower-paid workers receiving
a higher percentage increase along with an improvement in
minimum-salary scales.
   Employees who make more than $50,000 a year, which includes most
of the paper's news and editorial workers, will have increases of
about $42.50 per week during the first three years of the contract,
with similar increases expected in the final two years, the Post
said.
   The agreement also calls for improvements in pension and
disability-insurance plans and better medical and dental coverage.
It contains several provisions for resolving worker-management
disputes and a no-strike, no-lockout clause.
   The worker-management clause is believed to be the first such
clause in the 51 years the Guild has bargained on behalf of Post
employees.
   The contract covers newsroom, accounting, advertising,
circulation and data-processing employees, as well as some workers
in other business departments.

   The fire-damaged Jackson Laboratory is
taking on a crash program to replenish the nation's supply of rare
research mice and gambling that tax money will keep it in business.
   The world's leading producer of unusual laboratory mice is using
all its resources on mouse production rather than rebuilding, its
director said.
   The fire two months ago at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor
crippled much medical research.
   By not using its insurance money to construct a permanent
facility, the laboratory is facing the possibility that it will go
out of business in as little as a year.
   ``Our responsibility was to get research animals out as fast as
possible and worry about the financial problems later,'' the
laboratory's director, Kenneth Paigen, said Friday.
   The loss of the laboratory's mouse production facilities ``is
currently creating very serious problems for research scientists
all over the world,'' said Dr. James B. Wyngaarden, director of the
National Institutes of Health, in a recent letter to the Jackson
Laboratory.
   The laboratory is the world's leading center for the study of
mouse genetics. The fire on May 10 destroyed the laboratory's mouse
production facilities and killed 400,000 research mice.
   The laboratory was supplying 20 percent of the nation's
laboratory mice, including many unusual strains unavailable
elsewhere.
   The mice ``are essential to research on arthritis, lupus,
cancer, heart disease, AIDS, and some 4,000 hereditary diseases,''
said Nancy Wexler, president of the Hereditary Disease Foundation,
in a letter to the laboratory.
   Paigen said the laboratory's interim production facilities, to
be housed in large trailers, could produce 24,000 mice a week by
the fall. Before the fire, the laboratory was producing 40,000 mice
a week.
   The Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Bethesda, Md., sent the
laboratory an unsolicited check for $750,000. The Arthur K. Watson
Charitable Trust of New York City gave the laboratory $400,000.
   Paigen estimated losses from the fire at $40 million and said
insurance will reimburse about $15 million.
   The laboratory has asked Congress for $25 million. A bill is
pending in the Senate that would give that amount to the National
Institutes of Health to help restore the nation's supply of
research mice.
   Paigen is optimistic that much or all of that money, if approved
by Congress, would be awarded to Jackson Laboratory.
   Jackson Laboratory mice have been used for 60 years to
demonstrate the effectiveness of bone marrow transplants in
treating some kinds of cancer, to understand the genetics of heart
disease, the causes of diabetes and the basis of many inherited
disorders.
   The fire is delaying much of that research.
   For example, the Mayo Clinic was set to begin testing a new
arthritis drug with Jackson Laboratory mice this summer. The
research has been put on hold until the mice are again available,
Paigen said.
   Mice are useful for research because they can be bred to develop
diseases similar to many human diseases.
   The fire began when a flammable adhesive being used by workmen
ignited, Paigen said. ``Everybody who works at the lab mobilized to
get as many animals out as they could,'' he said. ``We actually
saved a hundred thousand animals.''
   No strains of mice were permanently lost. A few animals of each
strain, or in some cases frozen embryos, were stored outside the
production facility as a safety measure. The problem now is to
increase the numbers of those mice.

   Thomas Root, the lawyer who survived a
mysterious gunshot and a plane crash near the Bahamas, has been
sued by investors who claim he cost them $125,000 in a case before
the Federal Communications Commission.
   The suit was filed Thursday in federal court by a group of
investors who tried to get an FCC license in 1987 to build an FM
radio station.
   Root specialized in that type of litigation. But the lawsuit
claims he committed legal malpractice by lying about some things,
failing to attend to details associated with getting a license, and
keeping the investors from getting a cash settlement from another
group that ultimately got the license.
   Belle Chasse Radio Limited Partnership, the group represented by
Root, and five other groups were trying to get the same license
approval for the New Orleans area, according to the suit.
   Root, of Alexandria, Va., is recovering from the bullet wound
and other injuries stemming from the crash of a small plane he was
piloting July 13. He is at his parent's home in Plymouth, Ohio,
about 50 miles southwest of Cleveland.
   His father, Thomas F. Root, contacted by telephone early
Saturday about the suit, said, ``I'm not aware of it, and I
wouldn't have any comment.'' The elder Root said his son was not
available for comment.
   Root had set out on a business trip, flying from Arlington, Va.,
to Rocky Mount, N.C., and later told air traffic controllers he was
having trouble breathing. He put his plane on autopilot and
military planes kept watch on him until his plane ran out of fuel
and ditched near the Bahamas.
   Root says he was unconscious until his plane hit the water, but
the military pilots said they saw his head move. He also insists he
does not know how he received the gunshot wound to the abdomen,
which was found after his rescue.
   The lawsuit claims that Root told his group's lead investor, C.
Lee Armstrong Clear, that the other competing groups would be
willing to pay Belle Chasse a $125,000 settlement for dropping its
license application.
   However, the suit alleges, Root subsequently told attorneys for
the other groups that he had been having trouble locating his
clients, and that Clear and Belle Chasse had decided to dismiss
their application.
   The FCC filed an order of involuntary dismissal against the
application and Root allowed it to go through without telling the
Belle Chasse investors what he had done, the suit alleged.
   Attorney Bruce Waltzer said the group that eventually won the
license paid settlements to all of the other groups except Belle
Chasse.
   FCC officials said last week that Root, who was paid about
$50,000 by the Belle Chasse group, had been involved in many cases
in which groups received settlements in exchange for dropping their
applications.

   Over a cup of coffee or a piece of
homemade pie at Lizzie's Cafe, folks talk about the silvery pagoda
that rises 82 feet out of the prairie.
   ``It's the closest thing to a tourist attraction we've got,''
said Lizzie Guthmiller, who runs the only cafe in this central
North Dakota farming community of 125 residents.
   The structure is the brainchild of Henry Luehr, who declared it
finished a year ago after working on it about five years.
   ``I guess I call it finished because when there's nothing else
to do you just have to call it done,'' said the 69-year-old
repairman, who has lived in the area all his life.
   About 1,500 people, some from as far away as Japan and
Czechoslovakia, have toured Luehr's tapering tower, 15 miles off
Interstate 94 and 60 miles from Bismarck. Tey sign their names in a
green spiral notebook that serves as a guest register.
   The idea came to him when he was trying to decide what to do
with wood from a friend's razed grain elevator, Luehr said recently
as he easily maneuvered his tall, lean frame up a stairway to the
pagoda's eight floors.
   Luehr wanted to build something with the rotting wood, but he
wanted to do it without scaffolding. A pagoda was the answer, he
decided.
   Walkways encircle each of its levels, from the ground floor that
measures 26 feet in diameter to the top floor with a 19-foot
diameter.
   Luehr sketched his plan for the pagoda from encyclopedia
pictures and then went to work on it, alone.
   ``I seem to work faster that way,'' he said.
   Luehr used aluminum press plates from two newspapers as siding
and old irrigation pipes as walkway railings.
   The inside decor _ carpeting, drapes and wall ornaments _ came
from junkyards and auctions. Some of the artwork _ including six
pictures of a black sun rising and setting _ was done by Luehr
himself.
   ``I didn't spend hardly any money,'' said Luehr. ``I didn't have
any money to spend, not on this dumb pagoda anyway.''
   Luehr's talent for frugal construction has been with him all his
life. He remembers that at age 7 he built a playhouse with leftover
house shingles and in 1941 he put up a barn, half of which included
used lumber.
   He also has crafted a pair of doll house-size castles, a
geodesic dome and a huge workshop in which he operates a farm
machinery repair service.
   ``He's always got to have something to do,'' said Luehr's wife,
Elaine. Without the pagoda to work on last winter, ``he talked 14
to 16 hours a day.''
   ``I've got so much time, so much energy,'' Luehr explained, a
smile brightening his tanned, weathered face.
   And the pagoda won't be his last project, he said.
   ``I haven't figured out what to do next, that's all.''

   Typhoon Judy was downgraded to a
tropical depression today after it had slammed into South Korea,
leaving 11 people dead and thousands homeless from widespread
flooding.
   The National Disaster Center said all the victims died in
landslides or cave-ins in the southern port city of Pusan and
surrounding areas, which were hardest hit.
   The media quoted higher casualty tolls from the typhoon. KBS
state television reported 19 people killed or missing. Two fishing
boats sank in rough seas and 10,000 acres of paddy fields were
flooded, it said.
   The weather bureau downgraded Typhoon Judy to a tropical
depression about dawn today and said it had lost its force and been
replaced by an ordinary low pressure system with heavy rains.
   Typhoon Judy packed winds of up to 78 miles an hour as it hit
the coast Friday, dumping up to 11.7 inches of rain in already
flood-stricken southern areas.
   One elderly woman was killed when a wall of her home collapsed,
and a fisherman was swept into the sea, news reports said.
   Survivors were wading through knee-deep water to salvage their
belongings, the reports said.
   Typhoon Judy left 40,000 people homeless and the toll of dead
and displaced is expected to rise as communications with remote
areas are restored, the Disaster Center said.
   Judy is the third typhoon in two weeks in Asia, where storms and
flooding have killed at least 2,500 people and left hundreds of
thousands homeless since mid-June.
   The typhoon swept across Japan earlier Friday, killing three and
leaving hundreds of thousands without electricity before heading
for the Korean peninsula.
   In South Korea, it followed five days of torrential seasonal
rains that already had left thousands homeless and dozens dead in
southern areas. The combined toll from floods and rains this week
was 85 killed and 47 missing, said the Disaster Center. Nationwide,
about 112,000 people were homeless, it said.
   It estimated property damage at more than $231 million.
   The U.S. Air Force based in Osan, 25 miles south of Seoul, used
helicopters and 20 paramedics to rescue stranded flood victims.
   A U.S. military spokesman said they picked up 77 flood victims
Friday, using rubber boats to reach some stricken areas.

   When Sister Elaine Fischer received her
calling from God, she never expected to serve him wearing a
flame-retardant suit and lugging heavy water hoses.
   But her decision to become a firefighter was received
enthusiastically by fellow nuns at the Mount Saint Scholastica
Convent in Atchison, 40 miles northwest of Kansas City.
   Sister Fischer, a Benedictine novice who is to take her
temporary vows next summer, began working at the local fire
department on Friday.
   ``The sisters are all very excited for me,'' she said in a
telephone interview. ``They're excited that one of us is doing
something to help the community.''
   Her decision to become a nun two years ago was something of a
surprise to her family, since it came after she had earned a
biochemistry degree from Kansas State University. By comparison,
becoming a firefighter was a minor threshhold to cross, she said.
   ``My family is very supportive,'' she said. ``After I joined the
convent, nothing would shock them.''
   For Sister Fischer, 23, a certified emergency medical technician
with a love for physical activity, the decision to battle earthly
flames came naturally.
   ``I really wanted to be an EMT, but you can't do one without the
other here and firefighting intrigues me,'' she said.
   Although ``this is probably the first situation we've had here
like this,'' Fire Chief Michael McDermed said he didn't hesitate to
hire Sister Fischer, who finished first among 15 applicants after
passing a vigorous physical exam and written and oral examinations.
   The 27-member department already has female firefighters, and
Sister Fischer finished the physical exam, which must be completed
in 20 minutes and includes carrying hoses weighing 50 pounds up and
down a five-floor training tower, in 14 minutes, ``which is really
not a bad score,'' McDermed said.
   Sister Fischer insists on being called ``Elaine'' in the
workplace and wants to be treated like any new trainee. So far, her
prayers have been answered.
   ``I think they're very relaxed around me. It's been very
comfortable. They don't treat me as anything other than a new
employee,'' she said.
   Firefighter Phil Regan said at first he wasn't quite sure how to
act.
   ``I was a little hesitant of what was going to be expected of us
as far as attitude, you know, your language ... just out of respect
for her,'' he said. ``You know, when you just say something bad,
you say `Oh God, I didn't mean that.'''
   Word of the blaze-battling nun surprised residents of Atchison,
population 11,436, Regan said, ``but she's strong and she's willing
to work and she's fun to be with.''
   Growing up on a farm southwest of Kansas City accustomed her to
working with her hands, Sister Fischer said. At the convent, her
hobbies include ``maintenance _ anything from gardening to painting
and woodwork.''
   ``She's spunky but in a quiet way,'' said Sister Angela
Ostermann, director of formation at the convent.
   ``When she first told me about the job, I think I was a little
surprised,'' Sister Ostermann said. ``But then as we talked about
it, we felt it was a very good way of serving the local community.''

<HEAD>Former Mayor Stokes Cleared In Petty Theft Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHAKER HEIGHTS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury cleared former Cleveland
Mayor Carl B. Stokes of charges he shoplifted a $17.25 bag of dog
food from a pet store.
   The eight-member jury deliberated on the petty theft charge for
2{ hours before returning the verdict Friday night in the suburban
Shaker Heights court.
   The dismissal was received graciously by prosecutor K.J.
Montgomery. Stokes is a municipal judge in Cleveland.
   ``The jury has done their job,'' Montgomery said. ``I just hope
the judge doesn't have any problems from this incident.''
   Stokes was mayor from 1967 to 1971 and then worked as a news
reporter for WNBC-TV in New York. He returned to Cleveland in 1980
to become a labor lawyer and was elected to the municipal bench in
1983.
   Stokes, 62, testified that he twice entered the Pad &amp; Fin pet
store June 2 through a rear door and asked two dog groomers about
buying dog food for his rottweiler Max. Each time the groomers said
the store's regular employees had not yet arrived for the day,
Stokes said Friday.
   ``I said, `The hell with it, I'll get a bag of dog food and come
back and pay for it in the afternoon,''' he said.
   Stokes said he was in a hurry to drive to downtown Cleveland for
three morning appointments.
   He returned to the store five hours later intending to pay for
the dog food, he said, but sensed hostility from two regular
employees he had known from past trips to the store, and again left
without paying, afraid that even the appearance of wrongdoing could
ruin his career.
   Last December, a hardware store security guard stopped Stokes
with a $2.39 screwdriver in his pocket. Stokes said he had
forgotten to pay for it. The store did not pursue shoplifting
charges.
   Three of Stokes' children and his brother, Democratic Rep. Louis
Stokes, were present for the verdict.

   A woman rescued her husband, daughter, and
six grandchildren from her burning home, then broke a window to
save a seventh who had not awakened, officials said.
   Dorothy Goodman, 55, said she saw a bright light when she went
into her kitchen early Friday to get something to drink.
   ``I saw the whole couch in the den was on fire,'' she said.
   She said ran to the bedrooms, where she awakened her husband,
Floyd, and her daughter, Lora, 22. She then roused her six
grandsons, ages 4 to 10.
   ``I shook them and dragged them out of the bed,'' Mrs. Goodman
said.
   Once outside, Mrs. Goodman realized a child was missing. She
went back into the house, but the heat of the fire forced her out.
She knocked out a bedroom window where 6-year-old April Griffin was
sleeping.
   Deputy Fire Chief Gerald McDaniel said Mrs. Goodman cut her arms
when she broke the window to reach her granddaughter.
   He said a cigarette dropped into the couch probably ignited the
fire.

<HEAD>Inmates Want to Fix Up Old Prison Themselves, Keep It Open</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inmates at a state prison want a federal
judge to let them fix up the 91-year-old building themselves and
use it for treatment and training programs.
   The Tennessee State Prison was ordered closed by U.S. District
Judge Thomas Higgins as a result of a lawsuit filed on behalf of
all prisoners in the state. The 1982 order declared the state's
prison system unconstitutional because of overcrowding and poor
conditions.
   ``We're not asking for justice,'' prisoner James B. Proctor told
Gov. Ned McWherter during a recent meeting on the renovation
proposal. ``We're asking for mercy.''
   Of the prison's 1,200 inmates, 506 signed a petition filed
Friday with Higgins to keep the prison open for vocational and
educational programs and psychiatric, drug and alcohol treatment
for long-term prisoners.
   The prisoners propose that the prison house 500 convicts who
have served at least eight years on sentences of 35 years or more.
   The court orders require the prison to close as soon as enough
new prisons open to provide room for its inmates. One prison is to
open in September, another in January and three more by 1992.
   A month ago, Higgins denied the state's petition to renovate
part of the Tennesee State prison as a special facility for 500 sex
offenders and mentally and physically disabled inmates.
   But the petitioning inmates said they hope to change Higgins'
mind.
   ``By using an inmate workforce, labor, construction and
renovation costs will be drastically reduced,'' they said in court
papers. ``By bringing education, vocational training and industry
into such an environment, an inmate can contribute to his own
support.''
   Higgins has said any modification in previous orders must first
be approved by Patrick McManus, a special prison master he
appointed to keep tabs on the state's progress in upgrading the
prison system.
   Higgins said in his order last month that he supports the
position of Gordon Bonnyman, a lawyer who has represented prisoners
since 1975. Bonnyman also wants Tennessee State Prison closed.
   Bonnyman said Friday he would have no comment on the prisoners'
request.

<HEAD>Soviet Spy Ship Turns Fleeing Cubans Over to US</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Cubans who survived almost a week at sea were
rescued by a Soviet spy ship prowling off Cape Canaveral, which
turned them over to the Coast Guard.
   U.S. officials, who had no recollection of any previous rescue
by Soviet sailors of fleeing Cubans, were puzzling over why the
ship had not turned over the men, found floating 26 miles off the
Florida coast, to Cuban authorities.
   ``In the time I've been here in Miami, this is the first time,''
Coast Guard spokesman Luis Diaz said Friday. ``I've had two tours
of duty here, so this is something new for us.''
   The men were badly sunburned, dehydrated and exhausted after a
six-day, 125-mile voyage during which they lost a companion and at
one point resorted to catching a bird with bare hands and eating it
raw.
   They were taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital and treated for
dehydration and severe sunburn. A hospital spokesman said they were
in stable condition Friday night.
   The Soviet ship, identified in the reference book Jane's
Fighting Ships as the 274-foot Zaporozhye, spotted the three
clinging to an inner tube and rescued them Friday morning, the
Coast Guard said. The Soviet captain refused to allow a Coast Guard
party to board, and the Cubans were transferred by raft to a patrol
boat for their trip to Miami.
   The refugees identified themselves as Arsenio Gomez Hernandez,
46, his son Pedro Gomez Cruz, 17, and Arsenio's brother Humberto
Valentin Gomez, 48.
   Junior Arlais Gomez, 20, cousin and nephew to the others, was
lost at sea.
   The men had secretly built a 12-foot wooden rowboat in Cuba,
which they loaded with supplies and tied to a tractor-trailer tire
inner tube.
   The rowboat overturned Monday night in rough seas, spilling
their provisions. The men clung to the inner tube.
   They caught some small fish by hand, Arsenio Gomez said. A
seabird landed on his head at one point, he said. He managed to
catch it and they ate it.
   The men lost track of time and weren't sure when Arlais became
delirious and thought he saw the lights of Miami. He let go of the
tube and drifted away, they said.
   Cuban refugees who make it to Florida usually are turned over to
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and released to
relatives after questioning.
   The Coast Guard has picked up 97 Cubans on rafts this year, 31
this month alone.
   The Soviet ship has been operating for several months off Cape
Canaveral on intelligence-collecting operations, said U.S. Navy Lt.
Cmdr. Steve Burnett, Atlantic fleet spokesman in Norfolk, Va.
   Coast Guardsman Jeff Slater said the Soviets may not have
realized the men were fleeing Cuba. ``The first information we
tried to get was their nationality,'' he said. ``The Soviets
answered `either Cuban or Haitian.' ''

<TEXT>
   Anti-nuclear activists who halted
the firing of a Trident 2 missile from a submarine said they won't
block the rescheduled launch, but will continue their political
battle against the weapon.
   Four Greenpeace U.S.A. vessels forced postponement of the launch
Friday when they sailed into an off-limits danger area in the
Atlantic 50 miles off Cape Canaveral and ignored repeated warnings
to leave.
   It was the first time in the 38-year history of Cape Canaveral
that such a protest had stopped a launching.
   Steve Shellhorn, commander of one of the Greenpeace ships, said
the activists would not be back at sea when the launch is
rescheduled.
   ``We think we made our point, and we've been quite successful in
focusing attention on America's most expensive missile system and
in delaying its operational date,'' Shellhorn said Friday.
   ``We don't think we can match the Navy test for test, so we will
concentrate on eliminating the Trident 2 through the political
process,'' he said. ``But we won't rule out returning to the range
eventually.''
   The Navy called off the Trident 2 test several hours after the
Greenpeace vessels penetrated the safety zone.
   A statement said the launch was postponed ``because of
intentional interference from foreign flag ships in a designated
hazardous operational area ... Concern for safety of the
interfering ships precluded the launch of the test missile.''
   ``We're happy about it, of course,'' Greenpeace spokeswoman
Shannon Fagan said. ``But we would be happier if the Navy cancelled
the Trident 2 missile altogether.''
   Fagan said two large Greenpeace ships and two motorized rafts
shadowed the submarine for hours, exercising their right to operate
in international waters. Safety regulations require that a
countdown be stopped if non-essential boats approach within about
three miles of the submarine.
   One of the motorized rafts slipped up to the submerged Tennessee
and the three-man crew attached three ``nuclear free seas'' banners
to the submarine, two to the radio mast and one on the side, Fagan
said.
   She said a Navy whale boat dispatched from a cruiser twice
rammed one of the Greenpeace boats, the 60-foot ketch
Monticivitano, after warning it and the other intruding vessels
that they were in danger because a missile launch was imminent. The
damage was minor, she said.
   The M.V. Greenpeace, a 190-foot vessel, flew the Dutch flag. The
Monticivitano sails under Swedish registry.
   The Navy had no comment on the Greenpeace reports.
   It was to have been the second underwater test firing of the
Trident 2, the Navy's newest, most powerful weapon. The first test,
on March 21, ended in an explosion when the $23.7 million missile
pinwheeled out of control four seconds after it was launched from
the Tennessee. Nineteen land launch pad tests, 15 of them
successful, preceded the sea trials.
   The Navy has said it plans to have the Trident 2 operational and
on station next March. The weapon has a range of 4,600 miles and
can carry up to 10 nuclear warheads. Twenty-four missiles are
carried on each sub.

   Vacationers aren't necessarily changing their plans, but they're
asking what kind of aircraft their flights will use following the
crash of two DC-10 jetliners, travel agents say.
   ``The DC-10 has created a problem for us with our leisure
travelers,'' said Deidre Green of Shamrock International Travel in
Fort Worth, Texas.
   Business travelers ``know they've got to get wherever they've
got to get on the best schedule,'' but those who fly less
frequently are questioning the type of aircraft they'll be on, she
said.
   ``As long as the fare's about the same, they are changing,'' she
said.
   Still, most passengers are deciding to stay with a DC-10 flight
after talking it over, agents said.
   ``You just have to have faith and just say, `You know what, I
can't afford to get hung up on this,'' said Mike Dorman of
Hickory-Cal-Mart Travel Service in Irvine, Calif.
   ``They're expressing concern but the most important thing to
them is convenience,'' said agent Deb McNulty of Salem, Mass., who
said Friday she had a flurry of calls about DC-10s this week.
   Some passengers who saw diagrams of where Sioux City survivors
were sitting in the plane are asking for specific seats, she said.
``I had a man yesterday decline a reservation on a flight because
he couldn't get a seat over the wing,'' Green said.
   A United Airlines DC-10 crashed in Sioux City, Iowa, on July 19,
killing 111, and a Korean Air DC-10 crashed Thursday in the fog at
Tripoli, Libya, killing at least 71 passengers. Initial
investigation of the Sioux City crash indicated a tail engine blew
apart and cut off the flow of hydraulic fluid needed to control the
jet.
   Friday, a Canadian Airlines DC-10 with 254 people aboard lost a
wing wheel but landed safely at Pearson International Airport in
Toronto.
   ``Some people take it really serious,'' said Yolanda Zalitis of
Garber Travel in Boston, who reported at least two people had asked
for different planes because of nervousness.
   ``What people are doing is inquiring about it,'' said Elaine
Tynus, owner of Lakeshore Travel in Chicago.
   ``Some of my own personal clients I've called and asked them if
they want to change. Some people have no desire to,'' she said.
   Crashes may give some passengers jitters, but there's no real
reason for fear, said Capt. Frank Petee, a former pilot and a
director of USAir's Fearful Flyers Program.
   An average 18,000 commercial flights carry more than 1 million
people daily in the United States and safety records are improving,
not slipping, he said.
   ``When you get right down to it, any airplane that's
certificated by the government, by the Federal Aviation
Administration, is a safe plane to fly on. It really is,'' said
Petee.
   The Sioux City crash was a ``one in 2 billion chance that
something that catastrophic would happen,'' said Petee, whose
airline does not fly DC-10s.
   Agencies that handle primarily corporate bookings reported far
fewer calls of concern. And some agencies reported no increase in
calls about airline equipment or declined comment, citing company
policy against commenting on crashes.

   Gunmen ambushed a group of American
visitors touring a Kenyan game park, killing a Connecticut woman,
wounding a man and robbing the group of money and jewelry, a source
said.
   The attack was the fifth on tourists in Kenyan game parks in
less than a year.
   The group of 19 Americans was attacked Thursday as they drove in
three vans along a 40-mile road between Amboseli and Tsavo national
parks in southern Kenya.
   ``They just jumped out in the road and fired on us,'' Allen E.
Sullivan, 66, was quoted as saying in a telephone interview with
Connecticut's Hartford Courant newspaper.
   Sullivan, a retired high school teacher from Trumbull, Conn.,
was shot in the chest but the newspaper quoted him as saying he was
not badly hurt. He spoke from his hotel in Nairobi.
   A woman was shot through the head and killed instantly. In
Washington, State Department spokeswoman Frances Jones identified
her as Marie Esther Ferraro of New Haven, Conn. Her age was not
available.
   Sullivan was quoted as saying that two men, one dressed in
camouflage clothing, jumped out of the bush about midday and began
firing at their convoy of three vans. The gunmen stole money and
jewelry from them, he said. Sources said the gunmen used
Soviet-made AK-47 assault rifles.
   They were on a trip organized by the Connecticut Audubon Society
and had 18 people from Connecticut and one from Georgia, society
spokeswoman Lauren Brown said in Fairfield, Conn.
   Kenyan Police Commissioner Philip Kilonzo and Richard Leakey,
director of wildlife, went to the scene to investigate.
   It was the fifth attack in 11 months on tourists in Kenyan game
parks.
   They began in September when a Dutch tourist was shot in the
chest in Meru National Park.
   Also in September, the remains of a British woman were found in
sprawling Masai Mara Game Reserve in southwestern Kenya. An inquest
begins Aug. 7 into her death, which her father says was murder.
Police say she could have fallen prey to wild animals.
   In the first week of July, poachers shot two French tourists to
death in Meru National Park, east of Mount Kenya. Leakey had called
it an isolated incident. He said he did not think the poachers were
``looking for tourists to shoot.''
   In April, three West German tourists were wounded by gunmen who
ambushed their vehicles in about the same spot between Tsavo and
Amboseli.
   Two Americans remain hospitalized after being beaten up last
week while on a horseback riding safari in Masai Mara. The U.S.
Embassy refused to release details about them.
   Maintaining security in Kenya's parks is vital to this East
African nation, which has hosted nearly 3 million tourists since
1984. Tourism last year brought in nearly $350 million and became
Kenya's top foreign exchange earner after coffee.
   After the French couple was killed, the government said it
increased security to ensure national parks and game reserves are
``peaceful and comfortable havens'' and make sure the wildlife
survive.
   Kenya has suffered increasingly from well-armed poachers who
stalk and kill elephants for their valuable ivory tusks, primarily
in Tsavo.
   Since Leakey became wildlife director in March, Kenya has
stepped up anti-poaching efforts. Since January, game rangers have
killed more than 20 poachers.

   Donna McGrady says she prayed along with fellow
flight attendants as United Flight 232 headed for a fiery crash
near an Iowa cornfield, then gave thanks as survivors emerged from
the wreckage.
   ``We all prayed _ we had our various moments of prayer,'' Ms.
McGrady recalled Friday.
   Ms. McGrady broke down in tears Friday at a news conference
where five United Airlines flight attendants who survived the crash
joined three others who helped on the ground. The news conference,
at O'Hare International Airport, was sponsored by their union, the
Association of Flight Attendants.
   Seven of the eight working attendants aboard the DC-10 were
among the 185 survivors. Flight attendant Rene LeBeau, 23, of
Schaumburg, was one of the 111 who died in the July 19 crash near
Sioux City, Iowa. The three-man cockpit crew survived, as well as a
non-working pilot who helped out.
   When the tail section where she was seated came to rest, Ms.
McGrady said she and another flight attendant helped people out of
the wreckage and then realized the severity of the crash.
   ``At that particular time, to come out and to look and to see
nothing but debris ... ' ' she said, her voice breaking.
   ``I said, `Oh, God, where is the other part of the aircraft?'''
   But the sorrow was tempered by joy at seeing so many survivors,
Ms. McGrady said.
   ``I said, `Thank you, Jesus, for the things that you've done for
us because we know there's no other way we could have made it
without your presence,''' she said.
   ``It was so good to see them,'' said flight attendant Becky
Larson, who were not aboard the plane but had helped survivors at
the crash scene.
   ``We just hugged them and loved them and kissed them and we were
so happy to see them,'' Ms. Larson said.
   Many of the dozens of United employees who attended dabbed at
tears during the news conference.
   Janice Brown, head flight attendant on the ill-fated DC-10, said
she cannot think of anything the flight attendants could have done
to save more people, and could not explain how some survived while
others did not.
   ``I'm not going to second-guess God,'' Ms. Brown said.
   Flight attendant Timothy Owens of Baltimore, who was seated in
the middle of the plane, said ``the tail section of the plane just
split apart and I saw a big beam of sunlight just coming through
the big opening in the back.''
   The flight attendants did not know at first that Ms. LeBeau had
been killed, Ms. McGrady said.
   After the news conference, Chicago-based United held a private
memorial service in the same room for Ms. LeBeau and four
non-working United employees who died in the crash. An airline
spokesman said more than 380 people attended.
   One flight attendant who was part of the plane's crew and a
non-working attendant who assisted during the crash were still
hospitalized Friday.
   The hospitalized flight attendant, Barbara Gillaspie, said
Friday from the Missouri hospital where she is being treated for
fractured vertebrae that she wants to fly again. Mrs. Gillaspie
said she will wait for physicians to say when she can return to the
skies.
   ``When I get the first OK, I'm going,'' she said.

<HEAD>Zimbabwe Leader Says Peace Talks With Mozambique Rebels On Track</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Robert Mugabe says he will
consult with President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya in the next few
days to prepare the way for peace talks between warring sides in
Mozambique.
   The African leaders are negotiating to end a 12-year war that
has cost hundreds of thousands of lives and made half of
Mozambique's 14.7 million people wholly or partly dependent on food
aid.
   Mugabe said he expects to contact Moi ``in the next few days''
to arrange preliminary talks with officials of the rebel Mozambique
National Resistance, also known by the Portuguese acronym RENAMO.
   The peace initiative, headed by Moi, aims at bringing the
guerrillas to a conference table with representatives of President
Joaquim Chissano's Marxist-oriented government, Mugabe said.
   ``We are looking forward to cooperation by RENAMO, as much
cooperation as possible,'' he told reporters Friday, a day after
his return from an Organization of African Unity summit in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia.
   ``We hope eventually there will be direct contact between the
Mozambique government and Renamo. It is these two parties that must
negotiate a settlement to their problems,'' he said.
   Mozambican rebels have been fighting for 12 years to oust the
Maputo government and are accused of widespread atrocities. They
are considered right-wing because they used to be armed by South
Africa, but their political goals are unclear.
   Mugabe said Chissano asked him on July 10 to join Moi as a
mediator to end the fighting that, coupled with mismanagement and a
weak infrastructure inherited from Portuguese colonizers, has
placed Mozambique among the world's poorest nations.
   Mugabe met with Moi at the African summit and the two agreed to
``draft parameters on the way we hope to operate'' and compare
notes soon afterward, Mugabe said.
   He said a meeting with Mozambican rebel officials will follow,
but gave no details.
   Landlocked Zimbabwe has 12,000 troops fighting alongside
Mozambican government forces and guarding transport links and an
oil pipeline through Mozambique to the Indian Ocean.
   The proposed rapprochement follows a U.S.-brokered peace accord
for southern African involving independence for Namibia and the
withdrawal of South African and Cuban troops in Angola.
   Until the June 22 cease-fire between Angola's government and
Jonas Savimbi's U.S.-backed rebels, Zimbabwe opposed similar
negotiations in Mozambique.
   At first, the Mozambican rebels rejected Mugabe as too partisan
to mediate. But earlier this month they accepted his role in the
peace initiative.
   Chissano's government is debating negotiations with the rebels
at the annual congress of its ruling Front for the Liberation of
Mozambique, the country's sole legal political party.
   The congress Friday presented a new policy document that drops
all references to Marxism, Leninism and Western imperialism. But it
says the party remains committed to socialism.
   The alterations coincide with a new government drive to end
central control of the economy and reflects Maptuo's improving
relations with Western countries such as the United States, Italy
and Britain.

   The ``Goddess of Democracy'' will stand again in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square, pledged Chinese dissidents attending
the first Congress of Chinese Students in the United States.
   ``Some say China has no hope for democracy, but I say the hope
is just beginning,'' Wu'er Kaixi, a leader of the pro-democracy
movement in Beijing, said Friday at the opening ceremony of the
conference.
   ``I believe the Chinese can be united and will erect a Goddess
of Democracy in Tiananmen Square one day,'' Wu'er told about 400
people at an auditorium at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
   Delegates from 130 universities are attending the organization's
founding conference, which will wind up Sunday. Thousands of
Chinese students who were studying abroad when the government
crushed the student democracy movement in Beijing and other cities
have decided not to return home.
   Wu'er, 21, who fled China after the military crackdown there in
June, told the crowd to continue the battle for democracy. ``We
can't rely on begging or wait for a next time,'' he said. ``We must
try now!''
   Behind him, a plaster replica of the Goddess of Democracy
erected by Chinese protesters in Beijing overlooked the crowd,
which cheered and stamped their feet as Wu'er shouted pro-democracy
slogans.
   The original Goddess, fashioned after the Statue of Liberty, was
torn down by the Chinese government after the military crushed the
student democracy movement that had occupied Tiananmen Square.
   The students dismissed the Communist Party's announcement Friday
that it was reining in corruption and nepotism. The party shut down
two state-owned conglomerates, including one linked to senior
leader Deng Xiaoping's son, and ordered an end to many of the
special privileges enjoyed by high officials.
   The Politburo order clearly was a response to the student
movement, which struck a deep chord among hundreds of thousands of
Chinese with its criticism of official corruption.
   ``Why are they doing it now? Because they have committed crimes,
killed people demonstrating for basic human rights. Now they are
trying to console people's anguish,'' said Jie Hu, a Northwestern
University student.
   ``They control everything, the economy, the daily lives of the
people and what's in their minds,'' said Jie, who is from the
Szechuan province in central China. ``It's absolute corruption.
There is no way they can cure this without reforming the system.''
   Wu'er was one of six dissident leaders who attended the opening
ceremony. All fled China and later surfaced in Paris, where they
have been trying to rally worldwide support for the pro-democracy
movement in their homeland.
   Pro-democracy T-shirts were hung on the walls of the University
of Illinois building. Some shirts said ``You are not alone'' and
bore one of the lasting images from the protest: the photograph of
a man, standing alone, blocking a row of Chinese Army tanks.

   A sheriff played some mind games to rope
in drug users headed for a country music fest in the north woods,
and the trick paid off with 20 arrests.
   After posting a sign Friday that read ``Narcotics Inspection
Ahead,'' six officers in camouflage hid by the roadside,
positioning themselves so they could see the reaction of the people
in passing vehicles on state Route 55.
   If the cars slowed down and those inside tried to conceal or
discard something, the officers radioed ahead for patrolmen to pull
them over, said Langlade County Sheriff Dave Steger.
   Some open beer cans were tossed out windows, but no one threw
drugs away, one officer told a reporter at the scene.
   ``They're too expensive,'' he said.
   Most of the arrests were for marijuana possession, and a few
were for cocaine possession and posession with intent to deliver,
he said.
   Officers accepted $100 bail in the form of personal checks,
credit cards or cash.
   Soon after the operation began, promoters of the weekend country
music festival at the Mole Lake Indian Reservation, about 220 miles
north of Milwaukee, arrived at the arrest site a few miles south of
the reservation to find out what was going on.
   ``It didn't take long for the word to spread,'' Steger said.
   Steger said accusations of entrapment did not worry him. ``There
was good probable cause on all the stops we did make,'' he said.

   Thunderstorms lingered today over the Midwest, hours after a
tornado touched down in New Mexico.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended this morning from western
Minnesota across southeastern North Dakota, South Dakota and
western Nebraska. Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered
over Montana, Arizona, New Mexico, southwest Texas, southwest
Louisiana, Florida and eastern North Carolina.
   In northern South Dakota, golf ball-size hail fell near Langford

   Dozens of houses in Columbus, Ohio, were flooded after as much
as 3.5 inches of rain fell in about two hours early Friday.
   ``The water was all the way to the top of my basement steps,''
said Pam Seely as she and her neighbors dragged muddy and
water-soaked furniture out of their houses. ``Our refrigerator was
floating at the top of the stairs. My washer and dryer were
floating, our pool table.''
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms over
eastern Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, southwest Georgia, and
Florida; and scattered showers and thunderstorms over central
Arizona, southwest Utah and southern Nevada.
   Highs were expected to be in the 60s around San Francisco; in

<TEXT>
   The Ministry of Defense has stopped British
Aerospace from negotiating a $500-million deal to sell Hawk trainer
jets to Iraq, officials said.
   Britain's domestic Press Association quoted unnamed government
sources as saying British Aerospace had hoped to sell 500 of the
jets to Iraq.
   A British Aerospace spokesman said Friday he could not comment
on the price of any possible deal, saying ``it wasn't a foregone
conclusion we had an order.
   ``The MOD (Ministry of Defense) vetoed us negotiating,'' he said.
   A ministry spokeswoman said the government was standing by its
1985 guidelines forbidding British sales of ``lethal equipment'' to
either Iran or Iraq.
   Although the two nations' 8-year-old war was stopped by a
U.N.-mediated cease-fire last year, negotiations so far have failed
to produce a permanent peace treaty.
   ``It's not going ahead,'' the ministry spokeswoman said of the
deal. She refused to elaborate.
   The British Aerospace Hawk trainer aircraft is used for flight
and weapons training and can be modified for ground attack
purposes, said the company.

   A reclusive and chronically ill boarder is
suspected of killing his landlady and her daughter, then living for
a week or more in the same house with their bodies before killing
himself, police said.
   When police climbed through a window at the house Thursday
night, a shot rang out from an upstairs bedroom. They found the
body of a man who had just shot himself with a small caliber gun,
police said Friday.
   Police searched the house and found the bodies of two females,
both badly decomposed, in the basement. Autopsies performed Friday
by the chief state medical examiner's office indicated that the
women, Jarmila Petrzelka, believed to be in her early 70s, and her
daughter, Jana Petrzelka, in her early 40, both died of gunshot
wounds to the head.
   The man found upstairs, identified as William ``Red'' Hewitt,
died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, medical examiners said.
   Friends and neighbors described Hewitt as a reclusive,
chronically ill boarder who had lived with the Petrzelkas for about
four years but was no longer wanted in the house. When he moved in,
friends said, he was dating the younger Petrzelka, a social worker,
but the relationship had long since ended.
   ``Over the past couple of years, they hadn't been very happy
with him staying there, but they were not the kind of people who
would turn somebody out,'' said David Anderson, a friend of the
family.

   The skunk that broke into Eva Busch's house
several nights last week had a thing for her TV set.
   While Eva slept, the skunk would nose through her towels, shoes
and socks and gather them in front of the television. It couldn't
have been that much of a thrill to watch, she says, because the set
was off.
   ``For some reason or another he seemed to be interested in TV,''
she said.
   When she entered the bathroom Thursday morning, the skunk was in
the tub, and she called the police.
   Officer Ron Carter filled the tub with water, then scooped the
skunk up in a box and took him outside.
   ``Floating around in the tub, it couldn't spray me,'' Carter
said.
   Ms. Busch figures the animal entered through a back door left

   A teen-ager is bounding off to set a new
world record with his pogo stick, and hopes to raise $5,000 to help
homeless people rebound.
   Bill Anzelc, 18, plans Aug. 12 to break the world pogo jumping
distance record of 11.53 miles.
   He has already has worn out a pogo stick practicing for the
attempt. During a recent practice, he covered 4.8 miles in slightly
more than than two hours.
   ``When I was 9 or 10, I did like 700 jumps on a pogo stick, so I
figured I could beat the record,'' he said.
   Anzelc learned from the Guinness Book of World Records in London
he can have five minutes of rest per hour during the hop.
   A pogo stick manufacturer in New York has offered to donate
several pogo sticks for Anzelc's attempt.
   The teen-ager is collecting pledges, and proceeds will go to the
Center for the Homeless.
   The current pogo record is held by Ashrita Furman of New York
City, who bopped up and down the foothills of Mount Fuji, Japan,
for eight hours on Jan. 8, 1986.
   Furman also made 3,647 jumps on a pogo stick in 8{ feet of the
Amazon River of Peru on Jan. 11, 1987. With each jump, his head
came above the surface and he breathed through a mask and snorkel.

   The Bush administration is threatening to withhold
U.S. aid to Cambodia if the Khmer Rouge is given a dominant role in
a new transitional government.
   But the policy paper distributed to reporters today as Secretary
of State James A. Baker III arrived here for a 20-nation conference
acknowledged that Prince Norodom Sihanouk might include the group
whose leaders are accused of murdering more than a million
Cambodians more than a decade ago.
   ``The U.S. would continue to support him,'' the paper said. It
offered the same assurance if Sihanouk also gave a role to members
of pro-Vietnam Prime Minister Hun Sen's government.
   Sihanouk is recognized by all Cambodian factions as the logical
head of an interim government to be formed after the withdrawal of
Vietnamese troops in late September.
   The Khmer Rouge, backed by China, is one of three factions
seeking to overthrow the government in Pnom Penh.
   Baker, in an airborne news conference, said the Bush
administration would be willing to make ``a major effort at
mobilizing the international community in support of a solution to
the tragic problem of Cambodia.''
   He said that would include exerting influence on international
banks to help the country's rehabilitation after 10 years of civil
war.
   Baker said the United States also would be prepared to end its
support to anti-communist forces in the event of a settlement.
   The United States currently is supplying about $3 million to $5
million a year in non-lethal aid to the guerrillas.
   ``If we could achieve a cessation of external assistance, that
would include external assistance from all sources, including any
external assistance from the United States,'' Baker said.
   In the conference, which opens on Sunday, Baker said his
objectives included:
   _An immediate cease-fire.
   _Formation of an interim government headed by Sihanouk.
   _Finding a formula to hold free elections.
   _Voluntary return of refugees.
   _A U.N. supervisory force to monitor the Vietnamese withdrawal
and elections.
   The paper on U.S. policy stressed that ``our strong preference
would be that there be no Khmer Rouge participation.''
   After pledging to support Sihanouk even if he gave a role to the
Khmer Rouge or Hun Sen's followers, the statement added:
   ``We have made it clear, however, that our ability to support
any Cambodian government is directly and inversely related to the
degree of Khmer Rouge participation, if any, in it.''
   The paper then went on to declare flatly:
   ``The U.S. cannot accept any role whatsoever in any future
Cambodian government for the Khmer Rouge's leaders discredited
before the world.''
   Later today, Baker will meet for two hours with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who is representing Moscow at the
conference.
   Baker said the two may begin planning a summit meeting between
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   But he said the real preparation will be undertaken when he
meets with Shevardnadze in September.
   Baker also said he may talk with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen, who will head Beijing's delegation.
   ``With respect to that issue I would say, `Stay tuned,''' Baker
said.
   There will be no formal meeting but Baker and Qian will be
seated next to each other under an arrangement made by France.
   President Bush barred high-level U.S. visits to China after the
crackdown last month on students seeking political reforms.
   This is being interpreted by the State Department as not
prohibiting such meetings outside China.

   A Chinese army officer and his wife
defected today to South Korea through the demilitarized zone
separating the country from communist North Korea, the defense
ministry said.
   Meanwhile, newspapers in Tokyo reported today that a Chinese
Embassy attache, protected by the Japanese government while she
sought asylum, left to start a new life in West Germany.
   Ma Qiuyun, an attache in the embassy's visa section, went into
hiding after the June 3-4 military crackdown on pro-democracy
protesters in Beijing and sought help from the Japanese government
June 14, Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper said.
   It was not known immediately whether the defectors from North
Korea seek asylum for the same reason.
   A South Korean intelligence source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, identified the officer as Maj. Zuo Xiukai, 40, a member
of the Chinese delegation to the Korean Military Armistice
Commission that oversees the 1953 Korean cease-fire.
   Zuo is the fourth-ranking officer in the Chinese delegation led
by a brigadier general, he said.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Yoon Chang-ro said the
Chinese couple remain in protective custody of the American-led
U.N. Command after walking across the border through Panmunjom
truce village this morning.
   The senior official, from the government National Unification
Board, did not say whether the defectors seek asylum in South Korea
or a third country such as Taiwan. Seoul has no diplomatic
relations with Beijing, but relations between the two recently have
improved.
   The official, requesting anonymity, said the Chinese couple will
be handed over to South Korea soon.
   The U.N. Command which polices Panmunjom consists of
representatives of the United States and 15 other countries that
helped South Korea drive out invading North Koreans in the 1950-53
Korean War.
   China fought with North Korea and signed the 1953 cease-fire.
   Today's defection is the first known Chinese defection through
Panmunjom. North Koreans, Russians and Czechoslovakians have
defected there.
   Newspapers in Tokyo reported it took the Japanese government a
month to to find a country to shelter Ms. Ma, 27. Finally, West
Germany agreed and Lufthansa German airline confirmed she flew to
Frankfurt Friday afternoon.
   According to Mainichi Shimbun newspaper, Ms. Ma's first
preference was the United States, but Washington refused,
apparently to avoid worsening relations strained since the U.S.
Embassy in Beijing began protecting Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi
and his wife, physics professor Li Shuxian. Australia also turned
down Ms. Ma, the Tokyo Shimbun said.
   U.S. Embassy officials could not be reached for comment today
and the newspaper account could not be verified.
   The Bush administration has offered protection to all Chinese
citizens in the United States and at least two Chinese diplomats
have obtained refuge in the country. In June, a State Department
spokesman said other Chinese officials have asked Washington for
protection, but he refused to elaborate.
   Fang and Ms. Li fled to the U.S. Embassy after Chinese troops
marched on unarmed protesters in Beijing and killed hundreds,
perhaps thousands. China says only 100 civilians and nearly 100
soldiers and police died.

   The ailing Exxon Valdez limped toward safe
harbor today, after postponing massive hull repairs for weeks while
waiting offshore until environmental questions could be answered.
   The tanker involved in the nation's worst oil spill was
scheduled to enter San Diego Bay early Sunday, under tow as it has
been throughout the 2,500-mile journey south from Alaska.
   Divers were confident they had cut off all the dangling steel
plates torn loose during the southerly voyage and that the gutted
tanker would be able to pass through the harbor's shallows.
   State environment officials said they would keep close watch on
the lumbering ship when it enters the bay under escort, surrounded
by a flotilla of U.S. Coast Guard boats.
   Local Greenpeace activists said they'd be watching too,
following at a distance after staging a protest demonstration
against Exxon planned for Sunday morning.
   ``We are concerned that it will be discharging into the San
Diego Bay,'' said Rick Nadeau, director of Greenpeace in San Diego.
``If it does have some oil slicks coming out of it, we'll be able
to see that.''
   Nadeau said Greenpeace wants to see the Valdez reach the dock
safely because more environmental damage could occur if the tanker
remains at sea any longer.
   An 18-mile oil slick was spotted near the tanker July 10, and
since then the Valdez has been halted about 55 miles off the coast
of San Diego.
   Numerous tests were conducted and the emergency plate-cutting
work was undertaken. Exxon officials and state negotiators hammered
out an agreement to allow Valdez into port.
   The Valdez, which spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil after
slamming into a submerged reef in Alaska, was to execute a series
of maneuvers, simulating what it will have to do inside the harbor,
before being allowed into the bay.
   Exxon officials insist that periodict discharges from the Valdez
are nontoxic with barely detectable traces of oil. State officials,
leery of Exxon assurances, have said the ship is releasing
significant pollutants.

   Syrian and Christian forces kept up their
relentless rocket attacks in Beirut today, killing eight people and
wounding 42 in a wave of bloodshed that has driven out all but a
fraction of the populace, police said.
   Fires blazed out of control and palls of thick, black smoke
billowed from gaping holes that rockets and shells made in
apartment buildings in both Moslem and Christian sectors.
   The new casualties raised the overall toll to 502 killed and
2,056 wounded in the 19-week confrontation between Christian forces
and Syrian army gunners.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under regulations,
estimated that only about 250,000 people remain in the city that
was home to an estimated 1.5 million residents when the current
fighting broke out March 8.
   The spokesman said about 50 percent of the population fled in
the first three months of the fighting and about 350,000 people
have fled in the past 10 days.
   Most of Beirut's residents have fled to south Lebanon, the
eastern Bekaa valley and the mountain resorts northeast of the city
to escape the deadly shelling duels, the spokesman said.
   Moslem and Christian radio stations interrupted regular
programming early in the day to report that shelling duels were
continuing across a mountain range southeast of the capital.
   ``The fight started very early today,'' the Moslem-run Voice of
the Nation radio reported in a news flash.
   The Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon radio urged civilians
to ``take maximum precaution because the shelling might escalate
and spread to other areas.''
   The thuds of exploding shells echoed across the wooded hills
south of Beirut early in the day as Syrian army gunners pounded the
Christian suburb of Baabda east of the capital.
   Baabda houses the presidential palace that has been used as the
main headquarters for Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun
since the confrontation broke out.
   Several motorists, heading to Beirut to inspect their deserted
apartments and businesses, turned back to south Lebanon and other
safe areas to avoid being caught in the cross-fire.
   ``They're shelling his palace. He'll respond soon. I don't want
to be around when his response starts,'' said Marwan Shaar, a Sunni
Moslem who owns a money exchange company.
   Shaar spoke in the Syrian-policed Khaldeh area, seven miles
south of Beirut. The area was under fierce shelling from Aoun's
gunners overnight.
   The escalating shelling duels coincided with reports in
Lebanon's heated rumor mill that either Aoun or the Syrians would
have to storm their opponent's positions to break out of the
4-month shelling duel that has not altered either side's areas of
influence.
   Aoun, in an interview with the weekly Arab and International
An-Nahar, pledged that ``We shall be advancing against the occupied
areas.'' He did not elaborate.
   The 54-year-old Maronite general had declared a ``war of
liberation'' against Syria's 40,000 troops deployed in
predominantly Moslem sections of Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping
mandate from the Arab League.
   He made the move after the Syrians and allied forces besieged
his 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of Beirut in
retaliation for his blockade of ports run by Syrian-backed militias
south of the capital.

   The government said thousands of
Indian troops would begin leaving today, the second anniversary of
an accord that brought them to Sri Lanka to quell a rebellion but
instead fueled more violence.
   India agreed on Friday to resume withdrawing its 45,000
peacekeeping troops, averting a showdown with Sri Lanka President
Ranasinghe Premadasa, who had called the continued troop presence a
threat to his country's independence.
   The government said 3,000 to 4,000 troops would begin leaving
today.
   ``The Indo-Sri Lanka problem to a great extent has been
resolved,'' Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said before he and a
six-member delegation left for New Delhi to discuss a timetable for
the withdrawal of the rest of the Indian troops.
   ``India's decision to recommence the withdrawal process has
further consolidated the 2,500-year-old friendship between the two
countries,'' he said.
   Premadasa originally sought the departure of all Indian troops
by today, but India maintained an immediate withdrawal would worsen
ethnic violence.
   India's decision Friday came on one of the most violent days,
when 74 people were killed.
   Casualties included nine Tamil guerrillas killed Friday in two
separate clashes with Indian troops, according to military
officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   State television said most victims were killed by Sri Lankan
forces in the Sinhalese heartland, where extremists have violently
protested government peace efforts and where Indian forces are not
deployed.
   The military also announced at least 150 people have died since
the government declared a nationwide curfew from midnight Thursday
to 6 a.m. Sunday to prevent violence during the anniversary.
   The two-year Indian military presence has fueled ethnic violence
among Tamil guerrillas the Indians were supposed to disarm and
Sinhalese extremists who say the Indian presence violates Sri
Lankan sovereignty.
   India, spurred by its own politically powerful Tamil ethnic
minority of 60 million, sent troops to Sri Lanka to enforce a July
29, 1987, peace accord sponsored by India and designed to give
ethnic Tamils some autonomy in northern and eastern Sri Lanka.
   But the biggest Tamil guerrilla group, the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam, reneged and began attacking the Indians.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who comprise
75 percent of the population and control the government and armed
forces.
   Sinhalese extremists upset with the concessions made to Tamils,
meanwhile, began attacking moderate Sinhalese who supported the
peace overtures.
   Sinhalese radicals are accused of killing 4,000 people, mostly
Sinhalese government officials and supporters, since Indian troops
began arriving.
   Another 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have
died in the Tamil separatist war that started in 1983.
   In Washington, the Bush administration said it hopes New Delhi's
decision saves lives.
   ``We welcome this development and hope that India and Sri Lanka
will be successful in reaching an agreement on a timetable for
withdrawal that minimizes bloodshed while recognizing Sri Lanka's
sovereignty and independence,'' said State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler.
   It remained unclear when all of the Indian troops would leave.
Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne and six other Sri Lankan
officials were to fly to New Delhi on Friday to discuss a timetable
for the withdrawal of the rest of the Indian troops.
   Premadasa earlier said Sri Lankan troops would leave the
barracks where they have been confined for two years and resume
patrols in Tamil areas.
   At the peak of its involvement in Sri Lanka, India's
peacekeeping force numbered at least 70,000. The most recent
withdrawals were in January and February when about 5,000 soldiers
left shortly after Premadasa took office.

   The ailing Exxon Valdez limped toward safe
harbor today, after postponing massive hull repairs for weeks while
waiting offshore until environmental questions could be answered.
   The tanker involved in the nation's worst oil spill was
scheduled to enter San Diego Bay early Sunday, under tow as it has
been throughout the 2,500-mile journey south from Alaska.
   Divers were confident they had cut off all the dangling steel
plates torn loose during the southerly voyage and that the gutted
tanker would be able to pass through the harbor's shallows.
   State environment officials said they would keep close watch on
the lumbering ship when it enters the bay under escort, surrounded
by a flotilla of U.S. Coast Guard boats.
   Local Greenpeace activists said they'd be watching too,
following at a distance after staging a protest demonstration
against Exxon planned for Sunday morning.
   ``We are concerned that it will be discharging into the San
Diego Bay,'' said Rick Nadeau, director of Greenpeace in San Diego.
``If it does have some oil slicks coming out of it, we'll be able
to see that.''
   Nadeau said Greenpeace wants to see the Valdez reach the dock
safely because more environmental damage could occur if the tanker
remains at sea any longer.
   An 18-mile oil slick was spotted near the tanker July 10, and
since then the Valdez has been halted about 55 miles off the coast
of San Diego.
   Numerous tests were conducted and the emergency plate-cutting
work was undertaken. Exxon officials and state negotiators hammered
out an agreement to allow Valdez into port.
   The Valdez, which spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil after
slamming into a submerged reef in Alaska, was to execute a series
of maneuvers, simulating what it will have to do inside the harbor,
before being allowed into the bay.
   Exxon officials insist that periodic discharges from the Valdez
are nontoxic with barely detectable traces of oil. State officials,
leery of Exxon assurances, have said the ship is releasing
significant pollutants.

<HEAD>Soviet Opposition Faction Takes Form at Moscow Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 250 reform-minded lawmakers held a strategy
meeting today for what promises to become the national parliament's
first organized opposition in nearly 70 years.
   The fledgling faction of Soviet legislators, operating under the
bland title of the ``Inter-Regional Deputies' Group,'' is pushing
for more radical economic reform and greater democracy.
   Progressive economist Gavriil Popov opened the group's first
general meeting in the crowded auditorium of the Soviet Filmmakers'
Union with a call to bring reform through careful legal changes
instead of the government's ``spontaneous approach'' to crisis
after crisis.
   Speakers then began discussing amendments and projects they want
to lobby for in the Supreme Soviet legislature.
   Organizers said many more than the 250 deputies who registered
for the two-day general meeting wanted to come, but some could not
obtain tickets and others were too involved in local events. All
2,250 deputies elected to this spring's Congress of People's
Deputies were eligible to join.
   Tass, which dubbed the group ``left-radicals,'' said today they
have a place in the reform process but that some legislators ``have
expressed the fear that in this complex time for the country, when
unity of action is required, this `left-radical group' might turn
into some kind of opposition.''
   In fact, some members say, the group already sees itself as an
opposition faction but avoids saying so publicly.
   ``We're avoiding the words `opposition' and `faction' because
they're perceived negatively,'' Moscow deputy Yuri Andreyev said in
an interview. ``But in actuality, this is a group of opposition
deputies who want to work in an organized way at the Congress and
the Supreme Soviet.''
   Moscow deputy Sergei Stankevich, writing in the first issue of
the group's newspaper, ``the People's Deputy,'' said that fears
instilled by years of political tyranny made people shy away from
the idea of open opposition.
   ``No sooner does someone pronounce the words `faction' and
`opposition' from the rostrum than some people feel their hearts
drop into their feet and their backs break out in sweat, and others
get a hunter's spark in their eyes and a militant shout in their
throats,'' he wrote.
   Tass predicted that maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin would be
elected head of the Inter-Regional Group. Elections were to be held
on Sunday.
   Thus far, the group has been tolerated but given no concrete
support by the government apparatus and was denied its own meeting
place in the Kremlin, organizers said.
   It is working on setting up its own staff and support base, said
Elena Kotova, head of the two-week-old ``Foundation of Deputies'
Initiatives.''
   The foundation is searching for legal ways for voters to
contribute money to their deputies and also hopes to act as a data
bank and channel for voters' requests, Kotova said.
   ``Our desired aim is to have the equivalent of a Western
party,'' she said.
   The last alternative party to survive the Bolshevik purges, the
Left Socialist Revolutionaries, was suppressed in 1922.
   The Inter-Regional Group grew out of ``the despair of the
radically-inclined minority'' during the Congress when they found
virtually all their motions blocked by what one deputy called the
``aggressively obedient majority,'' the newspaper People's Deputy
said.
   Popov proposed creation of an independent group of deputies on
May 27, the third day of the Congress. The Congress lasted two
weeks; it served as a national stage for striking revelations about
the country's crises and launched commissions but produced little
actual legislation.
   The Congress ``postponed the resolution of essential problems
for an undefined period,'' the People's Deputy said, ``and that led
to strikes and the sharpening of the inter-ethnic situation.''
   Among questions discussed today were amendments that would give
enterprises more independence from ministries and a resolution
asking that Soviets living abroad who were stripped of their
citizenship be allowed to reclaim it.

<HEAD>Hungary Says It Has Torn Down Half Its Border Fence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary has dismantled nearly half of
the barbed wire fence and alarm system that has divided this
communist nation from the West for more than 30 years, an official
said.
   Balazs Novaki, deputy commander in chief of the Hungarian
frontier guards, told reporters on Friday that work on removing
Hungary's ``iron curtain'' has progressed more swiftly than planned.
   Hungarian leaders presented President Bush with a piece of the
barbed wire fence when he visited Budapest earlier this month.
   Speaking at a news conference at the border town of Koeszeg,
Novaki said the system now has been removed from a 75-mile section
of Hungary's 160-mile border with neutral Austria, the official MTI
news agency reported.
   During the spring, workers began cutting through the barbed wire
at four stops along the border, and officials said then they
expected to dismantle the barrier completely by Dec. 1, 1990.
   Hungary decided in February to remove the fence and electronic
alarm system that was installed in 1972. Novaki said restrictions
in the 15-mile-wide border zone, such as on travel and movement,
will be lifted Aug. 1 but that guards will continue to patrol the
border.
   The number of Western tourists visiting Hungary has increased
considerably this year, Novaki said, with the biggest increases
among visitors from Austria, West Germany, the Netherlands and the
United States.
   Officials also have said there has been a substantial increase
in the number of citizens from other East bloc countries attempting
to flee to the West over the Hungarian border since they began
dismantling the fence. Most are from East Germany, officials have
said.

<TEXT>
   The Hearst Corp. has put the Los Angeles
Herald Examiner up for sale, one of the newspaper's editors said.
   The announcement, which according to features editor Andrea
Herman was made to employees on Friday, followed months of reports
the owners were holding discussions with potential buyers of the
money-losing paper.
   The reason was not publicly announced, but a statement to
newspaper employees said the decision was a result of intense
pressure from competitors of the afternoon paper.
   ``For a number of years, the Herald Examiner has been in an
extremely challenging situation,'' said the statement by Robert J.
Danzig, vice president and general manager of Herald Newspapers.
   ``We have weighed these considerations carefully and have
reached a conclusion that continuing our ownership of the Herald
Examiner is not compatible with the strategic direction of our
newspaper company,'' Danzig said.
   The Hearst Corp., a privately held company, has acknowledged the
paper loses money, but won't disclose figures.
   In recent years the newspaper has lost readers to the rival Los
Angeles Times as well as to growing suburban newspapers. But with a
circulation of 238,392 daily and 183,122 on Sunday, the Herald
Examiner still is the 42nd largest newspaper in the country, Ms.
Herman said.
   Daily circulation peaked at 729,000 in 1967, when the Herald
Examiner was the nation's largest afternoon daily.
   The beginning of the circulation decline coincided with the
start of a 10-year strike by the Newspaper Guild. Afternoon
newspapers across the country have been hurt by the growth of
suburbs because delivery is hampered by traffic.
   Still, the Herald Examiner has earned a reputation as a scrappy
newspaper that provides vigorous coverage of the nation's
second-largest city.
   The newspaper was the first to delve into the financial dealings
of Mayor Tom Bradley, and its queries into the five-term mayor's
ties with a commercial bank prompted this week's City Council
hearings into a controversial deposit of $2 million in city funds
with the bank.
   Hearst hired the investment banking firm of Lazard Freres &amp; Co.
of New York to handle sale negotiations, according to the
announcement given to newspaper employees.
   The newspaper has 760 editorial and administrative employees,
Ms. Herman said.

   As thousands of people milled through a
sun-splashed street fair, a mental patient who had walked away from
a hosptial attacked a 9-year-old girl and stabbed her to death in
front of her mother.
   Jessica Short was pronounced dead about a half hour after the
2:20 p.m. attack Friday, a hospital spokesman said.
   ``A young life was wasted and I want to know why,'' Mayor
Sebastian J. Garafalo said at a news conference. ``I keep asking,
`Why?' It's so senseless.''
   David Peterson, 37, a patient at Connecticut Valley Hospital,
was charged with murder in what police Chief George R. Aylward
called a ``random act of violence.''
   Peterson had been ordered confined at the hospital for 15 years
in May 1988 after being found innocent by reason of insanity on
assault and burglary charges, said Martha Lewis, executive director
of the state Psychiatric Security Review Board, which oversees his
confinement.
   Aylward said he had been told by the hospital that Peterson was
free on an eight-hour pass Friday. Hospital Superintendent Carl
Cappello, however, denied that Peterson had been given a pass, and
said he simply walked off the grounds without permission.
   ``Peterson had been granted privileges to go to the library and
stay in the building,'' Cappello said. ``He went AWOL.''
   ``We don't have a fence around the hospital,'' Cappello said.
``It's not a correctional facility. ... He was obviously able to
leave the grounds.''
   Lewis was unsure of the exact nature of Peterson's mental
illness.
   The stabbing took place on the city's Main Street, which was
closed to traffic.
   Peterson grabbed Short from behind after she walked out of an
F.W. Woolworth Co. store and was apparently walking toward her
mother. He flailed at her head and chest with a large,
black-handled hunting knife, witnesses said, until two police
officers and a passerby pulled him off the girl.
   ``Nobody was helping her,'' said a woman who would not give her
name. ``People were screaming and running. He cut her on the arm
and then just stood there and started stabbing her in the chest.''
   Lewis said Peterson was allowed to leave the hospital to have
Christmas dinner with his family last year, but she said that was
the only time the review board has allowed him to leave the
hospital grounds.
   ``It definitely calls for a review to look into what happened,''
she said.

<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE returns; ADD fraud charges. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Hashemi Rafsanjani won Iran's presidential
election by a landslide, and constitutional changes also approved
by voters will give him sweeping powers, according to partial
returns today.
   Rafsanjani, 54, who was serving as parliament speaker and
commander in chief, is expected to restore links with the West,
liberalize Iran's economy, and soften the hard-line policies of the
late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The government reported a huge voter turnout and a powerful
mandate for Rafsanjani, who recently emerged as Iran's most popular
and powerful leader.
   An opposition group charged that voting hours were extended in
an effort to increase a poor turnout of voters and that troops
attacked some voters.
   Partial returns gave Rafsanjani 94 percent of the vote in 124
districts counted, according to the official Islamic Republic News
Agency. It said he captured 8 million of 8.5 million votes tallied
so far from Friday's polling.
   Public opinion polls published earlier this month predicted 86
percent of the votes for Rafsanjani and 11 percent for his
opponent, Abass Sheibani. Three percent were expected not to vote.
   Sheibani, a 58-year-old parliament deputy from Tehran, has no
national political power base. The lawmaker, a candidate in the
1981 presidential race, was a student activist opposed to the late
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
   Sheibani spent 13 years in prison before Khomeini's Islamic
Revolution toppled the monarchy in 1979. Khomeini died June 3.
   The official news agency, also citing partial returns, said 97
percent of voters approved constitutional amendments in a
referendum held with the presidential elections.
   The consitutional changes give Rafsanjani more power than any of
his predecessors. In addition to scrapping the post of prime
minister, they put the president in charge of government. He will
be answerable only to the 270-seat Majlis, or parliament.
   The changes are designed to eliminate competing power centers
that have for years paralyzed the government and blocked economic
reform.
   Iran's main opposition group, the Mujahedeen Khalq or People's
Warriors, said in a sattement released at its headquarters in
Baghdad, Iraq, that the voter turnout was very poor.
   It gave no overall numbers, but it said that at some polling
stations in Tehran only 1,000 of 5,000 expected voters cast ballots.
   Voting hours were extended by seven hours. The government said
the extension was made to accommodate a large turnout of voters,
but the opposition group claimed it was actually intended to bring
forth more of them.
   Reporters said the turnout seemed sluggish Friday morning but
picked up later in the day.
   ``The way they have been urging people to get out and vote has
been very desperate,'' a Mujahedeen spokesman said in a telephone
interview with The Associated Press in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   The group also claimed that at polling stations in Ghani Abad
and Shahr-e-Ray in south Tehran, fundamentalist revolutionary
Guards beat up some voters and arrested others who tried to vote
against the constitutional amendments. There was no independent
confirmation.
   Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi said in a television
interview that his security agencies had foiled plots by opposition
groups backed by ``global arrogance'' to disrupt the voting. He did
not elaborate. ``Global arrogance'' is an Iranian epithet for the
United States and its allies.
   Although it was a foregone conclusion, Rafsanjani's victory
reflected even stronger support than expected. The official news
agency said, ``This massive victory will give greater confidence to
his adminstration.''
   Almost every voter questioned Friday by correspondents outside
polling stations in Tehran said they chose Rafsanjani because they
believed he would put the economy before revolutionary ideology.
   ``We know Rafsanjani can't perform miracles, but we feel he's
the only man who can improve things,'' engineer Parzolah Armandi
said after voting in Tehran's southern slums.
   ``We're tired of lining up for food,'' said Masoumeh Gazian, a
housewife in the Nehdat Islami district who said she voted for
Rafsanjani.
   Rafsanjani, leader of the so-called pragmatists in Iran's
religious hierarchy, will be the Islamic Republic's fourth
president. He will succeed Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who was chosen
supreme leader after Khomeini's death.
   Khamenei is Rafsanjani's main ally in the power struggle between
the pragmatists and radicals, led by Mohtashemi.
   Mohtashemi's allies include Prime Minister Hussein Musavi, whose
job will be eliminated under the constitutional amendments.

   Brush fires in California torched houses and forced the
evacuation of several communities, and Idaho's governor declared a
state of extreme emergency to handle the blazes consuming thousands
of acres of forest.
   A fast-moving fire roared through a windy tinderbox of dry grass
and brush in the Sierra Nevada foothills today, and Sheriff's Lt.
Greg Burton of Fresno County, Calif., said at least three homes had
been destroyed, with 1,500 firefighters unable to control the
3,000-acre fire.
   At least 2,500 residents were evacuated from the communities of
New Auberry, Meadow Lakes, Alder Springs, Bald Mountain and Jose
Basin, said Bob Kutz, spokesman for the California Department of
Forestry. About 150 nursing home patients were among those taken to
a local high school in the area 190 miles east of San Francisco.
   One of the evacuees, Fred Burnham, had moved to the highland
area from low-lying Fresno just a day before the fire _ to escape
the heat.
   When a sheriff's deputy screamed at him to clear out of his new
house, Burnham said, ``I never even came out with a shirt.''
   Elsewhere in central California, firefighters saved at least a
dozen homes from a fire that burned 10,500 acres near the city of
Atascadero.
   ``Miraculously, all those homes have been spared,'' California
Department of Forestry spokesman Ron Alsop said. ``The flames
burned right up to them.''
   About 750 firefighters had the blaze 40 percent contained early
today. Officials refused to estimate when it might be fully
contained, although increasing humidity and low overnight
temperatures were a boon to firefighters, Alsop said.
   The blaze destroyed 15 to 20 outbuildings, including barns and
corrals. Owners moved animals from some ranches in the area about
175 miles north of Los Angeles.
   In the Los Angeles area community of Walnut, firefighters
surrounded a fast-moving brush fire that had threatened several
homes and the nearby California Polytechnical Institute in Pomona,
officials said.
   Campus police evacuated 800 students as the fire approached,
said Rafael Ortiz, a firefighter with the Los Angeles County Fire
Department, but the blaze was contained about 8:30 p.m. and
students were allowed back into their dorm rooms on the campus 30
miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
   In Idaho, Gov. Cecil Andrus authorized military reinforcements
Friday to join the battle against hundreds of forest fires. His
emergency proclamation allows the state to use the National Guard.
   The Boise Interagency Fire Center estimated some 3,000 people
were fighting Idaho fires or supporting suppression efforts against
smaller blazes.
   More than 15,000 acres had been blackened by an estimated 500
fires, although a number of blazes were controlled by late Friday.
   ``Fires are continuing to pop up,'' Payette National Forest
spokesman Dave Olson said. ``It's going to be a long weekend for
us.''
   The top-priority fire in the state was the 1,500-acre Fleming
Creek blaze, with towering smoke columns visible 50 miles south in
Boise. One lane of traffic on Idaho Highway 55 was closed over a
two-mile section to guard against falling rocks and burning timber.

   A military tribunal has sentenced seven
youths to five-year prison terms for staging anti-government
demonstrations, a government newspaper said today.
   Also today, a spokesman for the main opposition party, the
National League for Democracy, said as many as 1,500 people have
been arrested since the second week of July. He asked not to be
identified by name.
   Police arrested the seven youths for shouting slogans July 17 at
Rangoon's Shwedagon Pagoda Buddhist temple on a religious holiday
and sentenced them Friday, the Working People's Daily said. It gave
few other details.
   On Tuesday, a military tribunal ordered the death sentence for
three young members of the National League for Democracy who were
convicted of planting a package bomb that killed two people at a
government oil refinery on July 7. A Western diplomat today called
Tuesday's proceedings ``a real show trial.''
   ``They say that the prosecution was heard and the exhibits were
shown, but the outside world hasn't seen anything,'' said the
diplomat in Rangoon, who spoke by telephone to the AP in Bangkok on
condition of anonymity.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, also criticized the sentences.
   ``According to the United Nations, executions resulting from
summary procedures denying the right of legal appeal and omitting
other fair safeguards constitute `the arbitrary deprivation of
life,'' it said in a statement received in Rangoon today.
   Burma's military government recently has intensified its
crackdown on the political opposition while releasing common
criminals under an amnesty announced July 20. Today's Working
Peoples Daily said 7,326 prisoners have been freed under the order.
   Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo, leaders of the National League for
Democracy, were placed under house arrest on July 20. A goverment
spokesman later accused them of trying to ``destroy the military
and create anarchy in the country.'' The government denies Ms. Suu
Kyi is on a hunger strike in her Rangoon home.
   In Britain today, the Foreign Office expressed dismay at reports
that Ms. Suu Kyi is on a hunger strike. A Foreign Office spokesman
also said Britain ``deplored'' the failure of authorities to allow
British consuls to visit Dr. Michael Aris, who is Ms. Suu Kyi's
husband. Aris, who is British, has had his movements restricted
since he recently returned to Burma from Britain.
   The spokesman for the National League for Democracy said today
he could not confirm that Ms. Suu Kyi was on a hunger strike
because the party has been denied contact with her. The Western
diplomat said detailed reports reaching his embassy from reliable
sources indicate Ms. Suu Kyi is refusing food.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS final graf to UPDATE with quote from Root refusing to comment

<TEXT>
   Thomas L. Root, the lawyer who survived a
mysterious gunshot and an 800-mile flight and crash into the
Atlantic Ocean, is recovering from his injuries at his parents'
home here, his father said today.
   Thomas F. Root, the pilot's father, said that his son remembers
little of his July 13 flight and doesn't plan to talk to reporters
until ``his doctor tells him he is fit enough.''
   Root set out on a business trip from his home in Arlington, Va.,
to Rocky Mount, N.C., and later told air traffic controllers he was
having trouble breathing. He put his plane on autopilot and
military planes kept watch on him until his plane ran out of fuel
and ditched near the Bahamas.
   Root said he was unconscious until his plane hit the water and
did not know how he received a gunshot wound to the abdomen, which
doctors noticed after his rescue. He was released from a hospital
in Hollywood, Fla., on Monday.
   The reason for his illness during the flight and the source of
the wound remain as much a mystery to Root as they are to those who
have investigated his flight, Root's father told The Columbus
Dispatch.
   ``He says it's not a story, it's just what happened,'' he said.
   During his convalesence in this town 55 miles southeast of
Cleveland, Root has visited the family doctor for treatment of a
collapsed lung and seen the family dentist, but otherwise has
stayed at home, his father said.
   Root was sued Thursday in federal court in New Orleans by a
group of investors who tried to get an Federal Communications
Commission license in 1987 to build an FM radio station. They claim
his actions cost them $125,000.
   Root specialized in that type of litigation. But the lawsuit
claims he committed legal malpractice by lying about some things,
failing to attend to details associated with getting a license, and
keeping the investors from getting a cash settlement from another
group that ultimately got the license.
   ``I don't care to comment,'' Root told The Associated Press when
asked about the suit today.

   Authorities charged a 57-year-old man Saturday in
connection with one of Britain's biggest cash robberies, the 1983
theft of nearly $10 million from a security company's headquarters,
police said.
   The suspect, Frederick Foreman, was extradited from Spain on
Friday.
   He appeared Saturday before magistrates at London's Bow Street
court and was ordered jailed pending his next court appearance
Friday, said Scotland Yard. He did not apply for bail.
   A police spokeswoman said he was charged with taking part in the
robbery.
   The robbery occurred in April 1983 at the London headquarters of
Security Express, a firm specializing in moving cash and bullion.
   Four other men were convicted in London in June 1985 for their
part in the robbery.
   Spanish authorities have been attempting to expel several other
Britons living in Spain and suspected of involvement.

   A dinghy taking six British college

said she struggled for hours to keep another woman afloat but lost
sight of her minutes before the lifeboat arrived.
   The victims all were undergraduates at Edinburgh University.
They included Matthew Hallifax, whose father, Sir David Hallifax,

<HEAD>Trouble With DC-10: Real Problems Or Bum Rap?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With two major crashes in nine days, a rash of
worrisome incidents and a troubled history, talk of eight million
hours of safe flying isn't enough to calm renewed concern about
safety of the DC-10.
   An airline passengers group wants all of the more than 450
triple-jet DC-10s grounded, and safety groups are calling for
design changes.
   But federal officials and some aviation experts say the plane's
bad reputation is a bad rap. They say the airliner has proved
itself safe.
   As the National Transportation Safety Board tries to find what
caused the July 19 crash of a United Airlines DC-10 at Sioux City,
Iowa, that killed 111 people and South Korean investigators probe
the wreckage of a Korea Air DC-10 in Tripoli that killed at least
75 people on Thursday, 50 airlines around the world are still
flying DC-10s.
   Other recent incidents involving the wide-bodied airliner built
by McDonnell Douglas include:
   _ A Canadian Airlines model that lost a wheel but landed safely
in Toronto.
   _ A United plane that landed without incident in Los Angeles
after reporting hydraulic problems.
   _ Another United jet that made an unscheduled stop at Chicago
after a bird was sucked into an engine.
   _ Yet another United DC-10 that slid off a runway in Chicago a
day before the Iowa crash.
   Although none of the incidents caused injury or serious damage,
they have added to the aura of distrust around the jumbo airliner
that has been in service nearly two decades and carried 745 million
passengers.
   ``The question of whether the DC-10 is a safe aircraft naturally
pops into people's minds,'' said New York aviation attorney James
L. Stengel. ``But people who understand the sequence of events in
the Iowa crash understand it was probably a very, very rare
catastrophic incident.''
   Despite reassurances from the experts and from Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner, who last week declared the DC-10 safe,
the airliner has become the butt of jokes, loose talk and some
genuine concerns.
   Travel agents say that since the Iowa crash, more passengers are
choosey about what plane they fly and some want to sit in sections
where most of the 185 survivors of Flight 232 sat.
   A reservations clerk, speaking on condition that neither she nor
her airline be identified, said some customers joke about the
DC-10. One man suggested he might book his mother-in-law on one,
she said.
   Rep. Douglas Applegate, D-Ohio, prompted laughter during
congressional debate Friday when he remarked about a colleague
concerned with smoking on airliners: ``This issue may be the least
of his problems if he's flying a DC-10.''
   But aviation experts say the problems facing the airliner are
not amusing and are typical of the concerns raised in the public
mind after a serious crash or series of crashes, even when they are
later blamed on maintenance, pilot error or other problems
unrelated to safety of the airliner itself.
   Tim Cole, a Washington aviation consultant, said he would still
fly in DC-10s.
   ``Eight million hours without a problem is a much higher
guarantee than I could get on any new car right now,'' he said.
According to McDonnell Douglas, a London insurance analyst said
that prior to the Iowa accident, DC-10s had flown 8 million hours
without an accident.
   ``Flying safety is serious business and deserves responsible
treatment,'' said Morten Beyer, chairman of Avmart, an independent
aviation appraisal firm.
   Beyer questioned the conclusions and data of the International
Airline Passengers Association, which called last week for all
DC-10s to be grounded. The group, which claims 110,000 members,
said 17 DC-10s have been destroyed since the model was introduced
in 1970 _ a worse record than other wide-bodied airliners.
   Beyer said the figures are misleading. He said 18 DC-10s
actually have been destroyed, but only three were due to accidents
involving mechanical problems.
   These include the Iowa crash, where investigators are trying to
determine why the plane's tail engine blew up, destroying hydraulic
flight controls.
   Another involved an American Airlines DC-10 that crashed on
takeoff from Chicago in 1979, becoming what is still the worst U.S.
aviation disaster in history with 274 people killed. The crash was
blamed on faulty maintenance.
   Also, in 1974, a Turkish Airlines DC-10 crashed over Paris,
killing 346 people after a cargo door popped off, the cabin
decompressurized, the cargo hold roof buckled, and control lines
were severed.
   A court order grounded all DC-10s for 37 days after the 1979
Chicago crash, and the aircraft was modified for safety after both
the Paris and Chicago crashes.
   But Beyer said 15 other DC-10s were destroyed by ground fires,
an aborted takeoff, bad landings, other pilot errors or birds in an
engine.
   Among more recent concerns raised about DC-10s is Rep. John
Dingell's suggestion that spare military parts might have been used
in the engine of the DC-10 that crashed in Iowa. The engine
builder, General Electric, says this is impossible, but the
Michigan Democrat asked the Federal Aviation Administration to
investigate.
   Adding further to McDonnell Douglas's woes is a report last week
of sabotage of some new airliners at its factory in Long Beach,
Calif., including severing of the hydraulic system on an assembly
line. Company officials said the incidents were not related to the
DC-10 crash, but they were investigating.
   Neither DC-10 that crashed recently was very old in aircraft
terms, but the DC-10 is receiving increased scrutiny as the whole
fleet ages.
   Older Boeing-built jetliners already have been subjected to
mandatory government repairs as they age. The focus will switch to
McDonnell Douglas planes as an industry task force prepares
recommendations for similar orders applying to the DC-10 and other
planes built by the company.
   The DC-10 is no longer in production. It is to be replaced by
McDonnell Douglas' new MD-11 model which has yet to leave the
factory.

<HEAD>Rains Arrive Before Relief, Threatening Another Year of Starvation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rainy season has hit southern Sudan,
and a relief operation intended to get food to the region is behind
schedule and hindered by soggy roads and fears of rebel attacks.
   In Kosti south of Khartoum, 17,500 tons of emergency supplies
are just now being loaded on Nile River barges that were to have
gone south weeks ago.
   Boxcars loaded with 1,350 tons of other supplies are parked in a
railroad yard, immovable for fear the train will be attacked by
rebels or starving peasants, as previous ones were.
   While nearly three-fourths of the targeted 105,000 tons reached
redistribution points before the rains, which will make them
inaccessible, relief workers say pockets of potential starvation
remain in southern Sudan, an area the size of Texas.
   ``One cannot speak of a disaster for the moment, but some of
these areas will have trouble,'' said Francis Junod of the
International Committee of the Red Cross. ``The extent depends on
the ecological situation and the peace talks.''
   Operation Lifeline Sudan, coordinated by the United Nations and
using trucks, trains and barges, was to have provided enough
supplies to help people displaced by the southern civil war survive
the summer monsoon-like rains.
   Officials report that 72,000 tons have been moved. The Red Cross
mounted a smaller airborne operation that failed to meet its goal,
transporting 6,000 tons of a planned 7,000 to 8,000 tons.
   ``The situation in the rebel-held territories is a bit tricky,''
Junod said. ``We've not been able to send in enough food because of
the onset of the rains.''
   Trucks and trains are virtually useless in the rainy season.
Neither the railroad bed nor the roads in the south, mostly rutted
pathways, are constructed well enough to withstand the downpours.
   In 1988, U.N. officials say 250,000 southerners died of
starvation, flood or disease during the rainy season. The estimate
of some Western relief workers is twice that.
   Both U.N. and other relief officials said Operation Lifeline had
to succeed to save 100,000 people from starving to death this
summer.
   Some relief workers in this wretchedly poor country, Africa's
largest with only a tiny network of roads and railways, blame
mismanagement and lack of clear planning for the failure of both
the U.N. and Red Cross efforts to reach their goals, despite the
huge expenditures.
   The Red Cross airlift cost $35 million from December, when it
began, to June.
   Operation Lifeline Sudan, which began April 1, was scheduled to
cost $132 million, which donors pledged at a March conference in
Khartoum. James P. Grant, the U.N. secretary-general's special
representative for the project, announced in mid-July a need for an
additional $40 million. With previous increases, that brought the
total to $200 million.
   Both sides in the civil war generally have honored a cease-fire
since May, but unknown gunmen have attacked relief trucks and
trains, with 11 people killed and several boxcars looted.
   A 45-car train loaded with 1,350 tons of relief supplies was to
have left July 17 from Babanousa in southern Kordofan, north of the
war zone, en route to Aweil, a major center for displaced people in
the south.
   Days later, a U.N. official said the train would not leave
without assurances from the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army
that it would not be attacked. The train is to carry food and
medicines to places held by both the rebels and the government.
   Politics also have interfered with the relief operation.
Operations were suspended temporarily after a military coup June 30
ousted the civilian government of Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi.
The United Nations' Grant said the new leader, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan
el-Bashir, ``took great pains to reaffirm the support of the new
government to continuing Operation Lifeline Sudan.''
   The government previously put obstacles in the way, claiming
agencies wanted to feed rebels trying to take over Sudan.
   Rebel commanders also have used food as a weapon, even shooting
at relief planes flying into rebel areas.

   The country's largest illegal poppy field
has been discovered near a hospital that treats drug addicts, news
reports said Saturday.
   About 1,000 opium-producing poppies, used to make heroin and
morphine, were found Friday after a nurse, not realizing what they
were, picked some to decorate a room at Oslo's Gaustad Hospital,
the Verdens Gang daily newspaper reported.
   Another nurse recognized the flowers and called police, who
destroyed the well-tended field, said the paper.
   Chief nurse Anne-Lise Bergenheim told the paper that the
hospital patients, who are closely supervised, could not have
tended the field ``unless they worked at night wearing miners'
lamps.''
   The flowers usually grow in warmer climates, but they can also
thrive during Norway's short growing season.
   Police said they had no idea who planted the flowers.

   President Bush and congressional Democrats are
engaged in a game of chicken over how to finance the
multibillion-dollar bailout of hundreds of failed savings
institutions.
   On Friday, the squawking began.
   Bush and members of Congress paraded before television cameras
at three separate news conferences to outline their views, one day
after House and Senate negotiators sealed a compromise deal on the
landmark legislation.
   The president favors a complex scheme to pay for the bailout by
borrowing the money through a new, quasi-private agency. That has
the advantage of keeping $50 billion in S&amp;L spending out of the
budget deficit, which, if it goes too high, triggers automatic
spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law.
   Democrats support the plan adopted by the House-Senate
conference, which they say is cheaper and more honest, to borrow
the money through the Treasury Department. However, that would
balloon the deficit over the next three years. Democrats evade the
automatic spending cuts by simply waiving Gramm-Rudman.
   Republicans say the administration's method keeps the spending
discipline of Gramm-Rudman in place. Democrats say Bush is just
engaging in a more subtle kind of subterfuge.
   Both agree that the other side is holding up urgent legislation
needed to staunch the industry's hemorrhaging and neither wants to
be blamed for that.
   The stakes are high. S&amp;Ls are losing an estimated $20 million a
day, $833,333 an hour, $13,888 a minute and $231.48 a second.
That's a lot of blame to shoulder and it hardly seems worth it for
either side to get tarred over what at first glance seems like
nothing more than an accounting question.
   But, the issue is important, not now, but over the next several
years, because it will have a major role in the annual jousting
over how to balance the budget, through spending cuts or tax
increases.
   Even though both plans alleviate the danger of an automatic
spending cut, politically, their effect couldn't be more different.
   Democrats are betting that if they win on S&amp;L spending, and the
reported budget deficit approaches the record set during the Reagan
years instead of getting better, Bush won't be willing to endure
the kind of drastic spending cuts that would be needed to reduce it.
   They believe he will feel that much more pressure to abandon his
``Read my lips: No new taxes'' pledge repeated over and over during
the 1988 campaign.
   The issue comes to a head this week when the S&amp;L compromise
package reaches the full House and Senate, which must approve it
before it goes to Bush for his signature.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, has vowed ``unless God palsies my
voice'' to protect the deficit-reduction law that bears his name.
Gramm has the signatures of 41 senators, including his own,
pledging to reject the S&amp;L compromise. Under the Senate's rules,
that's enough to block it.
   On the other hand, if Gramm is successful the legislation
bounces back to the House-Senate conference, where majority
Democrats prevail.
   So, the two sides are locked in a stalemate. Either can tie up
the legislation, but neither has the stomach to do that for very
long.
   The winner likely will be the side that is most successful at
blaming the other for delay. Expect the squawking to grow louder.

<DATELINE>YEROHAM, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An economic slump since the Palestinian
uprising and the government's increased interest in the occupied
lands have left this desert town and others like it with soaring
unemployment and the threat of unrest.
   ``It has become a catastrophe. Unemployment is a time bomb in
this town,'' said Rahel Messika, director of the government
employment agency in Yeroham, a cluster of neglected tenements
housing 7,000 people in the Negev Desert, 90 miles south of
Jerusalem.
   Analysts say high unemployment in small towns may cause tension
between rich and poor and between Jews of European and Middle
Eastern origin. It also could harden anti-Arab sentiment among
Israeli Jews who believe Palestinians working for lower wages are
stealing their jobs.
   In Yeroham, the only activity at mid-morning on a summer weekday
is at the unemployment office, where the jobless come looking for
work they know does not exist. Idle, middle-aged men seek relief in
the shade next to empty cafes and grocery stores.
   Yeroham was founded in the 1950s to house impoverished
immigrants as part of an effort by the late Prime Minister David
Ben-Gurion to develop the Negev Desert.
   The town has relied on a bottle factory and two metalworks. But
the plants have laid off 150 of the town's 2,000 workers, and
unemployment is officially pegged at 10 percent.
   ``At least an additional 10 percent don't bother to register any
more. They know no new offers have come in,'' Messika said.
   Young people recently demobilized from the army are leaving
Yeroham, hoping to find work and a more vigorous lifestyle in
cities such as Tel Aviv.
   The unemployment problem in such towns has become a major focus
of concern in Israel, taking precedence in newspapers over the
19-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied
lands.
   Last month, mayors of 30 development towns chained themselves to
a fence outside Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's office to press
demands for economic aid.
   The 9.7 percent jobless figure for May was a 20-year high for
the Jewish state. The government estimates that the June figure
will break a record 10 percent.
   Ruth Klinov, a labor relations expert at Hebrew University in
Jerusalem, said the Palestinian uprising, which has disrupted the
construction industry and badly hurt tourism, contributed 2 percent
to the overall unemployment rate.
   The Histadrut, Israel's trade union federation, organized a
two-hour nationwide strike by 1.2 million workers to protest
unemployment in late July. Experts say more strikes may be in the
offing.
   ``There is a great potential for violence in unemployment, which
may eventually be directed against the Histadrut itself if they
don't get results,'' said Noah Levin-Epstein, a sociologist at Tel
Aviv University.
   One sign of the unrest was a wildcat strike by 50 laid-off
employees of the Urdan metalworks in Netanya, which builds Israel's
main battle tank, the Merkava. The workers held their managers
hostage four hours to protest the dismissal orders.
   Klinov said as long as the government refuses to bail out
private companies and maintains a policy of privatizing state-owned
companies, ``an unemployment rate of at least 10 percent is here to
stay.''
   In an effort to halt the growth of unemployment, Israel's
Cabinet approved $137.5 million to help create new jobs, especially
in development towns.
   Like other development towns, Yeroham was built around light
industries and was heavily subsidized. But in recent years the
government has cut back support and diverted funds to develop
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which got $150 million
last year.
   The result is an economic slowdown that has affected everyone
from grocery stores to banks.
   Shalom Benvinisti, 35, an immigrant from Morocco, lost his job
as a bank teller five years ago and has worked temporary jobs to
support his diabetic wife and three children.
   Even temporary work vanished two months ago, and he now relies
on unemployment benefits of $450 a month. After six months, the
benefit will be cut in half.
   ``My kids know that we can't buy them new clothes or the proper
school books. but they are good about it. They don't complain. They
understand how hard it is,'' he said.
   Benvinisti took a government-run training course, learning to
make metal frames for concrete casting. But he still cannot find a
job because ``they all want years of experience.''
   Yoav Peled, a political scientist at Tel Aviv University, said a
survey of 832 Israelis in eight development towns indicated high
unemployment has increased support for extreme anti-Arab parties.
   ``They feel that the Palestinians are forcing wages down and are
stealing their jobs,'' said Peled said.
   Unemployment is also high among 800,000 Arabs with Israeli
citizenship. In predominantly Arab Nazareth, the official jobless
rate is 10 percent with an additional 12 percent unregistered,
according to city spokesman Fahoum Safwan.
   ``High unemployment among Arab-Israelis will strengthen their
growing identification with the Palestinian uprising, as economic
frustrations are added to political tensions,'' Levin-Epstein said.

   The recent barring of black teen-agers from
a pool owned by the Jaycees resulted from tradition and habit that
lives on in this small town, residents say.
   The Saluda Swim and Tennis Club capitulated quickly when its
whites-only rule was challenged. It said it will admit blacks when
it reopens Saturday after reviewing all its policies to ensure they
are non-discriminatory.
   Such change could have occurred only with the involvement of
outsiders, say residents in this town of 3,000, 40 percent of whom
are black.
   The local Jaycees were pressured by their national organization
after the July 13 incident involving three black teen-agers with a
group of United Methodist Church members from across the state.
   People living in the town knew that the pool was for whites _
black residents swam in ponds and were unwilling to challenge the
status quo, both black and white residents said.
   ``Blacks in Saluda know what's what,'' said Richard Logan, the
town's first, and only, black council member.
   At M.J.'s Cafe last week, Charlie Mason sat behind a wooden
picnic table on the right side of the restaurant, where he and
other black residents have sat for years. The left side of the
restaurant, which is separated by a wall, was patronized by three
white customers eating lunch.
   ``I've just been sitting on this side all the time,'' Mason, 58,
said when asked why he restricts himself to one side of the
restaurant.
   The swim club ended its restrictions when threatened with
eviction by the Jaycees, but without apparent bitterness.
   ``In 1989, it's the moral thing to do,'' club president Robert
Booth said.
   ``Really, everybody treated it as a private membership club as
any city has country clubs,'' said Ralph Shealy, editor of the
Saluda Standard-Sentinel. ``I hope the whole town is not treated as
racist.''
   Virginia Cobbler, who, like Shealy, is white, agreed.
   ``We have lived here with it all these years and we've never had
any problem. They call it racism and it gets attention. I just hope
it doesn't create a big problem.'' Cobbler, 24, referred to blacks
and whites in Saluda as ``family.''
   Saluda is in rural South Carolina, 45 miles west of Columbia. It
sits in an area known for peaches, livestock and textiles. Stores
close after lunch on Wednesday, and the biggest news had been the
upcoming celebration of Saluda as birthplace of Alamo heroes
William Barret Travis and James Butler Bonham.
   The swim club's pool policy became the talk of the town, though,
after it refused to admit the black church members who were part of
a group of 66 who had spent the day renovating a dilapidated home.
   Club officials noted that the pool site was willed to the town
in 1933 by dairyman George C. Wheeler with the provision that it be
used as a recreation area for white people.
   In 1955, one year after the U.S. Supreme Court declared
unconstitutional separate facilities for blacks and whites, the
town deeded the property to the Jaycees with the whites-only
provision intact.
   The Jaycees leased the pool to the private club. No blacks ever
applied for membership, Booth said.
   State law does not address racial segregation in private clubs,
state attorney general's spokesman Mark Dillard said. But lawyers
say racial covenants are unenforceable.
   While some say they're now reassessing practices and attitudes
that have lived for years in town, others maintain that Saluda's
problems are no different from those elsewhere in the country.
   ``Racism is all over the United States,'' Logan said. ``It's the
same. It's just done in different ways.''

   Two new HUD audits say rent subsidies were
improperly inflated by $6 million for two housing projects
involving former agency officials.
   The internal audits completed this month by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development's inspector general found that local
housing authorities in Tulsa, Okla., and Gastonia, N.C., allowed a
mortgage company to establish the rents for the projects, a
violation of HUD guidelines.
   The Tulsa project, Windsong Apartments, is owned by a
partnership that includes four former HUD officials _ Philip Winn,
Lance Wilson, Philip Abrams and J. Michael Queenan. All four also
had stakes in projects reviewed as part of a nationwide audit
released in April that cited excessive rents as one of several
problems afflicting the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program.
   The Gastonia development, Four Seasons Apartments, is owned by a
group that hired Rhode Island-based consultant Judith Siegal to
help obtain the lucrative rehabilitation subsidies.
   Ms. Siegal was among the lesser-known, but more successful,
consultants cited in the earlier report, which found that HUD was
being overcharged more than $400 million over the 15-year life of
the rehabilitation subsidies because of inflated rents.
   The mortgage company that established the rents, Benton Mortgage
Co. of Knoxville, Tenn., also has figured prominently in an ongoing
investigation of abuses at the agency. The company co-insured the
projects with HUD.
   All the audits noted that former HUD officials had won a
significant share of the rehabilitation money and that prominent
Republican consultants were successful in steering money to their
clients.
   Since the report in April, HUD has been the subject of internal,
congressional and Justice Department investigations. Mismanagement
and abuses have been found in a number of the multibillion-dollar
agency's programs.
   HUD secretary Jack Kemp suspended the Moderate Rehabilitation
Program. The House, in its budget bill for HUD next year, included
no new funding for the program.
   The two new audits obtained last week under the Freedom of
Information Act were not part of the nationwide review.
   The audit of the Tulsa project, completed July 11, found that
the Tulsa housing authority misinterpreted HUD guidelines and
allowed Benton to calculate the rents for the 202-unit Windsong
complex.
   As a result, auditors said, HUD already had paid more than
$200,000 in excess of what it should have since the subsidies began
in 1987 and could overpay by as much as $3.4 million over the life
of the contract unless the subsidies are reduced.
   The findings of the Gastonia audit, completed July 24, were very
similar.
   Investigators found that the Gastonia Housing Authority allowed
Benton to set the rents, which auditors said were calculated with a
faulty formula and included ineligible costs. As a result, HUD had
paid $63,000 in excessive subsidies from late 1987 through March
and over the term of the contract will overpay rents by more than
$2.5 million unless the subsidies are recalculated.
   In both the Tulsa and Gastonia audits, HUD urged the local
housing officials and regional HUD officials to recalculate the
subsidies and to recover the overpaid amounts. That process is just
getting under way.

<HEAD>Priest Says Racism Permeates Catholic Church in U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Racism permeates the Roman Catholic Church in
the United States, several clerics said, warning that more blacks
could follow the lead of a priest who set up an unauthorized
African American congregation.
   Seven black church leaders, speaking Friday after a national
conference of black clergy, called on the church to address the
needs of minorities and move blacks to positions of authority.
   ``The church has bought into the racist practices of the
American culture,'' said the Rev. Victor Cohea, a pastor from New
Orleans.
   The news conference at Marquette University followed a joint
conference of the National Black Catholic Clergy Caucus, the
National Black Sisters Conference and the National Black Catholic
Seminarians Association.
   Much discussed was the case of the Rev. George A. Stallings, a
Washington, D.C., priest who was suspended for setting up an
independent African-American congregation without permission of his
archbishop.
   The Rev. Albert J. McKnight of Opelousas, La., warned that
others could follow Stallings' lead.
   ``We're ready to take up the cross and commit ourselves to
change. I'm firmly convinced you're going to see changes,''
McKnight said.
   ``There are some of us who are ready to do exactly what George
Stallings did,'' he said.
   Responding to the criticism, the Rev. Joseph Perry, judicial
vicar of the Milwaukee Archdiocese and a member of the clergy
caucus, said he believed ``those comments would be rather strong
from my perspective.''
   Over the last 50 years, the Catholic Church has reached out to
various minority groups, Perry said.
   ``In my association with many black priests, I find them
extremely loyal to the church and willing to work with the system
for steady and certain improvement,'' he said.
   Sister Patricia Haley of Philadelphia said the church must
include minority group members and women at the highest
decision-making levels of its dioceses.
   ``The manner in which we do business is essentially a racist
system, and we've got to change the system,'' the sister said.

<TEXT>
   Iran's new president, Hashemi Rafsanjani,
will have to walk a political tightrope to achieve his expected
goals of rebuilding links with the West and liberalizing life in
the Islamic Republic.
   He has been armed with more power than any of his three
predecessors because of constitutional amendments approved in a
national referendum held alongside Friday's presidential election.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said Rafsanjani
received 94 percent of the 8.5 million votes counted by Saturday.
The constitutional changes received 97 percent support. It did not
say how many people voted.
   The leader of Tehran's so-called pragmatists will have to move
carefully to avoid triggering a backlash from radicals dedicated to
preserving the ideological purity of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
Islamic revolution.
   Under the constitutional reforms, initiated by Khomeini himself
before he died June 3, the post of prime minister will be scrapped
to put the government under the presidency, which had been a
largely ceremonial post.
   Rafsanjani, 54, has authority to appoint or dismiss the Cabinet.
He will head a newly formed Supreme Security Council, which will
control Iran's vast security apparatus and military, in addition to
the economy and planning.
   The constitutional amendments are designed to eliminate rival
power centers that have paralyzed government for years and delayed
economic and social reforms. In theory, they should create a more
cohesive and effective government.
   Rafsanjani was elected by Iranians eager for change after 10
years of revolutionary turmoil, a war with Iraq, economic hardship
and the rigid Islamic code imposed by Khomeini.
   Voters interviewed in Tehran during Friday's polling were
unanimous in saying they were looking to Rafsanjani, in the
forefront of Khomeini's revolution from the start, to improve their
lot.
   But Iran's 50 million people, battered by runaway inflation,
high prices, unemployment and shortages of just about everthing,
may be expecting too much too soon.
   Rafsanjani has sought to dampen expectations, saying, ``I will
try to realize what is practicable.''
   He underlined in a television interview last week that his hopes
for a new era ``may or may not square with the potentials at hand.''
   Rafsanjani has acknowledged he faces daunting problems _ an
economy run into the ground by the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, poor
management and a decade of Iran's self-imposed isolation.
   Mohammad-Hassan Sazegar, deputy minister of heavy industry,
outlined the problems with unusual candor at a seminar on
industrial problems last month, saying the economy is in its worst
shape ever.
   ``Production is lowest in our industries,'' he said.
``Bottlenecks are strangling production.''
   Sazegar said the 120 factories supervised by his ministry are
producing at only 30 percent of capacity because of shortages of
raw materials, spare parts and energy.
   ``We frequently prevaricate by resorting to emotional
sloganeering'' to solve problems, he said. ``For the last 10 years
we have offered the wrong solutions and weakened the economy.''
   Such frank comments indicate that more realistic thinking is
emerging in the upper echelons of the leadership than was possible
while Khomeini was alive, dominating every aspect of Iranian life
with stern Islamic inflexibility.
   Rafsanjani and his main ally, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who
replaced Khomeini as Iran's supreme religious leader, favor a
free-market system to revitalize the economy.
   They also know that large-scale foreign investment is needed to
improve the economy and carry out postwar reconstruction, and that
it will come only if relations with the West are restored.
   They are opposed by revolutionary hard-liners like Hussein
Musavi, the outgoing prime minister, and Interior Minister Ali
Akbar Mohtashemi, who say foreign economic participation will
dilute the revolution's ideological purity.
   So far, the fractious leadership has displayed unexpected unity
to ensure a smooth transition of power since Khomeini died.
   But diplomats and analysts believe that if the radicals perceive
Rafsanjani to be straying from Khomeini's ideological legacy, they
will challenge him.
   Khamenei and Rafsanjani have adroitly outmaneuvered the radicals
in recent weeks.
   Rafsanjani began moving his allies into positions of influence
weeks before his election. They included Rajai Khorassani, Iran's
former U.S. ambassador, who ousted hard-liner Ayatollah Sadeq
Khalkhali as chairman of Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee.
   In foreign policy, the new president has reaffirmed that he will
adhere to Khomeini's ``neither East nor West'' decree. But he has
stressed: ``We do not want to strain relations with countries which
would like to have healthy ties with us.''
   There are indications Rafsanjani has begun reactivating his
efforts to improve relations with the West.
   Diplomatic sources said Rafsanjani is moving to boost relations
with Canada and that Khazempour Ardebili, former deputy oil
minister, is likely to be appointed ambassador there soon.
   A Canadian delegation visited Tehran with little fanfare earlier
this month to sign an agreement that permits Iran to open a
purchasing office in Canada to buy badly needed high technology
equipment for Iran's vital oil industry, which earns 95 percent of
the country's foreign exchange.

<TEXT>
   Six months after President Bush's inaugural
speech offering the hand of bipartisanship to Congress, House
Democrats say the honeymoon is on the rocks.
   Perhaps the low point in the relationship came late last week,
when the Democrat-controlled House hammered the administration on
its defense plans by slashing weapons systems Bush favored and
adding some he didn't.
   But it had been deteriorating for weeks, as the White House
negotiated positions with congressional Democrats on a wide range
of issues and courted their votes only to have Republican lawmakers
and campaign operatives later undermine the agreements.
   Democrats complained that Bush was playing a public ``good guy''
role, calling for political peace and harmony, while privately
signaling his GOP troops to attack from the rear.
   ``I think the president is going to find his good will here is
going to diminish,'' said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich. ``That's not a
threat, it's just a reality.''
   Particularly galling to House leaders has been Bush's eagerness
to seek an amendment to the Constitution against flag desecration
to counter a recent Supreme Court decision, and his use of a speech
at the Iwo Jima memorial to put pressure on Congress to act.
   They also believe that Bush has been busily making expensive
promises, from a $100 million development program for Poland to a
capital gains tax break and a manned mission to Mars, then handing
Congress the bills to pay.
   In remarkably candid comments last week, House Minority Leader
Robert Michel, R-Ill., indicated that White House Chief of Staff
John Sununu was indeed fully involved in the strategy ``to develop
the wedge issues'' such as the flag that would put Democrats on the
defensive.
   ``That does not bode well for a bipartisan working relationship
with the new Democratic leadership team'' in the House, said Rep.
Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the party's House campaign
organization.
   ``You can't look for `wedge issues' and still look for
cooperation in a Democratic-controlled Congress,'' Anthony said,
adding that the result would be legislative stalemate. ``And in a
stalemated government, it's always the president who's hurt.''
   ``We believe there's a pattern,'' said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md.,
chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. ``The president says nice
things, and on the other hand John Sununu says `use this as a wedge
issue.' They're talking out of two sides of their mouth.''
   A possible victim of the ill will could be the hoped-for
agreement between Bush and Congress on a fiscal year 1991 budget
outline. Talk of reaching such an accord early is no longer heard,
and Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., hinted recently that it could
be abandoned entirely.
   Bush continued to insist Friday that he is not looking for a
fight with Congress and will continue to be conciliatory.
   ``I have to work with these people,'' the president said. ``I
have never been too hot at being a name-caller.''
   But Democrats seem increasingly less willing to take such
comments at face value.
   ``Bush wants `kinder and gentler' while his people are gnawing
your legs off,'' said Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
   Proponents of the wedge strategy, from Sununu to House GOP Whip
Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Edward Rollins, chairman of the
National Republican Congressional Committee, ``have absolutely no
interest in anything except burning the barn down,'' he said. ``If
(Bush) is going to have a two-track system, that's not going to
work... What track is the president on?''
   More than 80 Democrats expressed a similar sentiment on Friday,
complaining to Bush in a letter that Rollins' organization took
more than 20 of them to task in news releases for supporting the
president's position against random drug testing for State
Department employees in a floor vote last month.
   ``It was a difficult political vote for those of us who care
about the war on drugs,'' said Rep. Peter Hoagland, D-Neb., one of
the victims of the press releases. ``It's just inexcusable.''
   Another signer of the letter, Rep. Richard Stallings, D-Idaho,
recalled Bush's inaugural statement that ``the American people
await action. They didn't send us here to bicker. They ask us to
rise above the merely partisan.''
   ``That was the line that got the best response'' in the January
speech, he said. ``But it's become a one-way street, as I see it.
And what will happen is we'll stop supporting him, and they'll wind
up with a lot of problems that will be of their own making.''

<HEAD>Committee Adds Funds for Vice President's Mansion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee tacked an extra $200,000 on
next year's appropriation for care of the government mansion
occupied by Vice President Dan Quayle as the result of some sharp
lobbying by his wife, the Congressional Quarterly reported Saturday.
   When Marilyn Quayle decided she wanted to convert space on the
third floor into bedrooms for her three young children, she turned,
not to Budget Director Richard G. Darman, but to Aubrey A. ``Tex''
Gunnels, a powerful aide to the subcommittee which has funding
jurisdiction over the Executive Office of the President, the
magazine said.
   And that is why the $18.4 billion Treasury Department and Postal
Service spending bill approved Tuesday by the full House
Appropriations Committee contains $578,000 for the ``care,
maintenance and operation'' of the vice president's residence _
more than twice last year's figure and $200,000 more than requested
by the White House, the article said.
   Gunnels is staff director of the Appropriations subcommittee on
the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government, whose chairman
is Rep. Edward R. Roybal, D-Calif. Gunnels has worked on Capitol
Hill since 1958.
   The magazine said that at Marilyn Quayle's personal invitation,
the 71-year-old native of Lubbock, Texas, visited the mansion last
spring to review her plans for installing several new bedrooms and
a bath in a third-floor area now used for storage.
   Mrs. Quayle declined to comment on the visit, but her chief of
staff Denise Balzano, said that while the vice president's wife had
outlined her ideas for the space, she had made no formal request
for extra funds. In the wake of the House committee's action, ``It
looks like (Gunnels) has been helpful,'' Ms. Balzano said.
   Gunnels declined to discuss his role. ``Just say that the
committee was informed that the vice president's residence needs
some more bedrooms,'' he told the magazine.
   Roybal said that ``Had I gone out to see (the mansion), I would
have recommended it myself.''
   The 96-year-old Queen Anne-style residence is on the lush,
tree-lined grounds of the Naval Observatory, about two miles from
the White House. Formerly the quarters of the chief of naval
operations, it became the official residence of the vice president
in 1974.

   The judicial system is struggling with
communications and legal challenges in trying three deaf men
charged with murdering a service station attendant in 1976.
   Police and prosecutors have used sign-language interpreters to
communicate with the defendants, but one defense attorney says that
may be inadequate to convey the nuances of court testimony and
cross-examination.
   Sign language isn't even satisfactory for friendly meetings with
her client, said Tricia Jenkins, a public defender.
   ``There's always the fear that he doesn't understand,'' she said
last week.
   The case involves the slaying of Franklin Deland Simpson, a
service station attendant in Marion County, who was killed in a
Feb. 3, 1976, holdup that netted the bandits $100 to $200 cash.
   Ricki Joe Rodgers, 35, of Lakeland; Larry Bernard Elliott, 35,
of St. Augustine, and Roger Gary Smith, 39, of Huntsville, Ala.,
are charged with first-degree murder in the case. The men are being
held without bail in the Marion County Jail pending their trial,
tentatively set for September.
   Ms. Jenkins said she's attempting to negotiate a plea agreement
in Rodgers case. Assistant State Attorney Jim Phillips said plea
negotiations with Rodgers and Elliott are under way.
   The case was listed as unsolved until mid-January, when
detectives got a tip. The information resulted in the arrest of
Rodgers and Elliott in Febraury and Smith in June.
   Since the men were arrested, police, prosecutors and defense
attorneys have had to balance protecting their rights against the
problems created by their handicaps.
   Rene Johnson, executive director of Deaf Services of West
Central Florida, has acted as a sign-language interpreter for
police and prosecutors in dealing with the men, who have varying
degrees of communication skills.
   Ms. Johnson said interpreters ``have to be unbiased and be able
to walk the fence'' and be careful that what they sign is an
accurate translation of what is said.
   But she admits there are drawbacks.
   For example, American Sign Language doesn't have a sign for
``weapon.'' There are signs for ``gun,'' and ``knife,'' but the
language lacks a symbol for the general concept.
   Ms. Jenkins represents Rodgers, who can hear sounds with the use
of hearing aids. She worries that his rights have been violated and
her effectiveness as a lawyer has been diminished because of his
partial deafness.
   After reviewing the tapes of his interrogation by police, Ms.
Jenkins said she feels the interpreter may have summarized the
questions asked by police and done the same with her client's
answers.
   ``It is very different when I'm conversing with a hearing
client. You can convey certain ideas with tones and inflections. I
leave an interview with him not feeling satisfied that I
communicated with him,'' she said.
   If the case goes to trial, it could be a logistical nightmare to
make sure the defendants understand what is happening in the
courtroom.
   Ms. Jenkins, the public defender has suggested using computer
terminals to print out questions and answers for the defendants.
   ``It's the only way I can see where he would get a fair trial,''
she said.

   Three times last week, the Republicans gloated
and the Democrats winced as President Bush welcomed Democratic
defectors into the GOP fold.
   The White House doors were opened wide to showcase two of the
coups. Bush personally extended a fraternal hand to retiring
District of Columbia Police Chief Maurice Turner _ widely
considered a mayoral prospect for the capital _ and to Rep. Tommy
Robinson of Arkansas, a potential gubernatorial candidate.
   In the third case, the president telephoned Louisiana Secretary
of State Fox McKeithen and congratulated him on joining the GOP
while McKeithen's father, the former eight-year Democratic Gov.
John McKeithen told his son, ``You must be crazy.''
   Robinson and McKeithen were the latest in a raft of southern
officials who have deserted their traditional Democratic roots for
the party that has won five of the last six presidential elections.
   The defectors' stated reasons for changing parties are a desire
to align themselves with the tough-on-crime, pro-defense thrust of
the Republican Party and the domestic agenda lumped under the
``family values'' category. They describe the Democratic Party as
liberal, special-interest oriented and not representative of their
constituencies.
   Some southern switchers said they became Republicans for
political survival after witnessing the GOP voting strength in
recent elections.
   Turner, who has not dampened speculation about a mayoral bid,
gave reasons designed to sell well with the city's overwhelming
majority of black and Democratic voters. The former chief, who is
black, cited Bush's ``kinder-gentler'' effort, his anti-crime and
anti-drug campaign, and his bid to project concern about civil
rights and minority entrepreneurship.
   Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater, a South
Carolina native whose expertise in southern politics is widely
acknowledged, is embarked on a campaign to demonstrate to potential
party switchers that their constituents' allegiance is really to
the GOP.
   While Democrats control all of the south's state legislatures,
Republicans now sit in five out of 11 governor's chairs.
   The Democrats say on the one hand that the party-switching trend
is overblown, that the Republicans have attracted only two
statewide officials and two members of Congress _ Robinson and Rep.
Bill Grant of Florida.
   Most of the 130 party switchers touted by the RNC are current or
former local officials such as aldermen, committee members, judges,
sheriffs and school board members. Some two dozen state legislators
are among the switchers.
   Still, the Democrats are not ignoring the trend, especially with
the symbolic value the Republicans gain by using the White House to
announce the switches.
   Robinson's congressional colleagues from Arkansas, Democratic
Reps. Bill Alexander and Beryl Anthony branded him a ``cagey
politician'' who was ``snaking'' behind their backs for years.
   Democrats accused McKeithen of making deal with the GOP to pay
off his $400,000 campaign debt.
   Turner was accused positioning himself politically against a
hefty field of potential Democratic mayoral candidates, including
incumbent Mayor Marion Barry, and, perhaps, Jesse Jackson.
   The Democratic National Committee has a twofold approach against
further defections: threatening to defeat the officeholders who
switch by recruiting Democrats to run against them, and touring the
South to shore up their traditional support.
   ``We'd like to give powerful incentives for these people not to
switch, for example, promising to beat them if they do,'' said Mike
McCurry, spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. He said
national Democratic Party staffers have fanned out to the districts
of the deserters to seek rival candidates for forthcoming elections.
   But the Democrats are aware of a growing perception that the
Republican Party is on a roll while ``people somehow feel that
values of the Democratic Party are out of sync with their
community,'' McCurry acknowledged. ``That's a failure on the
Democratic Party to project ... an image of forcefulness about what
we care about and some sense of where we would lead the country in
the future.''
   ``It is very clear that this party has got to reach out and tell
people what it cares about .. what we think America is all about
and what America should be in the next century,'' McCurry said.
   Thus, while Turner and Robinson were shaking the president's
hand before a battery of cameras last week, DNC chairman Ron Brown
was in Texas meeting with local party officials.
   The DNC has calculated that Brown spends about half his time
travelling out of the capital, and 40 percent of that time is in
the South.
   The Democrats contend that party switching is cheating the
voters who elected Democrats. The Republicans, said McCurry, are
``making up for their inability to go out and win elections ...
fair and square.''
   But while the Republican Party circulates its list of 130
party-switchers, McCurry would point to only one on the Democratic
scorecard _ a former member of the South Carolina legislature,
attorney John Bradley, who is said to be considering a
gubernatorial bid.

<TEXT>
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski resigned
today as head of the Communist Party and was replaced by the
outgoing prime minister, a politician who has become a champion of
hard-line forces in the party.
   The moves came at a two-day Central Committee plenum called to
debate the future of the party, which has been deeply divided by
policy disputes and parliamentary elections in which many of its
candidates were trounced.
   The plenum also dropped five of the 18 Politburo members and
three of the nine party secretaries, the official news agency PAP
announced.
   Jaruzelski, who had led the party since 1981, promised to give
up his post as party chief before the National Assembly narrowly
elected him to the new office of president on July 19.
   But some observers were surprised that the Central Committee
elected outgoing Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski by a 4-1 margin
to replace Jaruzelski as party leader.
   The selection of the 62-year-old Rakowski culminated a
remarkable political rise by an official who only joined the
Politburo in December 1987 after having been dropped from the
government in 1985.
   In recent months Rakowski has been roundly criticized for his
government's handling of the economy. A party member with a long
reputation as a reformer, in the past year Rakowski has become the
champion of hard-line elements in the party and those concerned
about the rising influence of Solidarity.
   Earlier today, Rakowski's government came under renewed
criticism for its economic performance. Inflation has climbed into
triple digits and basic goods such as meat, bread and sugar have
been in short supply in recent weeks.
   A plan by Rakowski to sharply raise food prices Aug. 1 has been
criticized as not properly prepared.
   ``The Central Committee accepted with one abstention the
resignation of Wojciech Jaruzelski from the office of first
secretary,'' PAP said. Moments later, the plenum elected Rakowski
171 to 41, PAP said.
   The only remaining question facing the plenum, which began
Friday, appeared to be who will replace Rakowski as prime minister.
   Potential candidates appeared to be Politburo member Wladyslaw
Baka, Ireneusz Sekula, now deputy prime minister and a Rakowski
loyalist, or Roman Malinowski, the leader of the allied United
Peasant Party.
   Jaruzelski hinted at the plenum Friday that he would not hold
the party leadership much longer and said a full congress of the
2-million-member party should be held soon. ``I am standing before
you still, for the moment, in a double role,'' said Jaruzelski,
referring to his election as president.
   He challenged fellow Communists to decide ``what we stand for.''
   PAP said the plenum today adopted a resolution declaring the
party's willingness to work with the independent Solidarity trade
union movement and with the 260 Solidarity lawmakers chosen by the
voters in June.
   As a result of the country's most democratic elections since
World War II, the formerly banned Solidarity now controls 99 out of
100 seats in the new freely elected Senate and 161 of the 460 seats
in the Sejm, or parliament. Many party-backed candidates suffered
humiliating defeats in the election.
   The resolution reaffirmed the party's January decision to
legalize Solidarity and ``defined conditions'' needed to improve
the economy, PAP said, without elaborating.
   Earlier today, the party Central Committee information policy
director, Slawomir Tabkowski, told the plenum the party is changing
too quickly for more doctrinaire members, PAP said.
   ``The speaker said possibilities should be created for those who
are disappointed with the party ... and those who do not identify
with the direction of changes to leave,'' PAP said.
   But Jerzy Majka, the editor of the generally hard-line party
daily Trybuna Ludu, said recent talk about the party's future is
``unsettling to all people, not only party members,'' according to
PAP. Majka said the party must maintain its ``rational'' approach
in trying to solve Poland's problems.
   The discussion included sharp criticism of the party's
performance in the elections and of the government's handling of
the economy.
   In another development, Politburo member Wladyslaw Baka quit as
party secretary in charge of the economy after delivering a speech
criticizing Rakowski's administration. Rakowski handed in his
government's resignation when the new Parliament was seated. Baka
was considered a likely candidate to succeed Rakowski as prime
minister.

<HEAD>Deng Says He Does Not Approve of `Great Democracy'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping said in an essay
publicized Saturday that he does not approve of ``great democracy''
but that ``small democracy'' is needed to keep in touch with the
masses.
   Allowing the masses to supervise the rulers ``is better than not
having supervision,'' wrote the 84-year-old Deng, who has crushed
three populist democracy movements in his decade of rule.
   The last time was in June, when he ordered an army attack on
student protesters.
   ``If we don't accept supervision and expand the democratic life
of the party and country, we will be divorced from the masses and
commit great errors,'' Deng wrote in the essay summarized on the
television evening news.
   The report said the essay would appear in the next issue of the
magazine Party Building.
   Deng added, ``We do not approve of great democracy. Great
democracy is avoidable, and this requires having small democracy.''
   He did not explain what he meant by the terms, but ``great
democracy'' appeared to be a reference to the kind of unfettered
debate that Deng denounced in the recent student protests as
leading to anarchy. In past writings, he also has rejected
Western-style parliamentary democracy as bourgeois.
   By small democracy, he apparently was referring to controlled
expressions of opinion that do not challenge the power of the
Communist Party. He wrote that the party should be supervised by
the masses and by the eight officially approved non-Communist
parties that are permitted to exist.
   Most important, the party must police itself, he said.
   ``Whether or not the Communist Party is qualified to lead
depends on our party itself ... on our party's ideology and work
style,'' he wrote.
   The party, meanwhile, announced it was issuing a new book called
``Deng Xiaoping Over 28 Years,'' written by his colleagues and
commemorating his ``glorious and outstanding achievements.''
   Publication of the essay and the book were part of a new high
profile, tinged with adulation, for the aging leader, who had been
in semi-retirement.
   He re-emerged to lead the June crackdown on the student
protesters, and since then a series of books and a movie about him
have appeared. His name appears in newspaper headlines daily, and
millions of Chinese nationwide are being required to study a speech
he made on crushing the student ``rebellion.''
   Deng said in the past that he did not want the mass adulation
revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung received in his last years. The
current campaign of Dengist admiration falls far short of that, but
many Chinese have begun drawing a parallel.
   Deng had been expected to retire from his last official posts,
as head of the state and party military affairs commissions, later
this year. But Western diplomats say they consider that unlikely
given the army's new prominence and power.
   In other developments, Premier Li Peng told a French newspaper
publisher China is willing to maintain good relations with Paris
despite ``recent difficulties'' but that the future of relations
``depends on the French side.''
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Li spoke in a meeting with
Yang Yongju, publisher of Europe Times.
   France froze its relations with China to protest the crackdown
on the protesters, and China since has protested that France gave
refuge to some fugitive student and intellectual leaders.

<HEAD>Amoco And Poland Sign Oil Exploration Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amoco Corp. has signed an agreement to explore
for oil in Poland, according to a published report.
   Under the contract, signed Friday in New York, Amoco and the
state-owned Polish Oil and Gas Co. will conduct a 12-month joint
study of geological and geophysical data on roughly 40 percent of
the country, the Chicago Tribune reported Saturday.
   If the exploration indicates potential oil reserves, Amoco and
Polish Oil and Gas would negotiate a second contract that would
enable the Chicago-based company to drill exploratory wells and
ultimately produce oil.
   Amoco Production Co. employees will go to Warsaw next month, and
Polish Oil and Gas employees will eventually come to the U.S.
production company's Houston headquarters to study the data.
   Amoco, the fifth-biggest U.S.-based energy company, has been
conducting a similar study in Yugoslavia.
   Poland produces only 3,000 barrels of oil a day, according to
Central Intelligence Agency estimates. By comparison, Illinois
pumps 63,000 barrels a day.
   Poland consumes an estimated 540,000 barrels of oil a day, much
of that obtained from the Soviet Union in exchange for machinery
and other goods.
   But the potential for oil is indicated by Poland's abundance of
coal _ the two hydrocarbons are often found in proximity to one
another.
   Poland hasn't explored intensively for oil for at least 45
years, and thus may have missed deposits detectable with today's
sophisticated equipment, said Alfred Munk, Amoco's manager of
foreign affairs.
   ``It's a problem of technical capabilities and money,'' said Jan
Szczurowski, the economic attache at the Polish commercial
consular's office in New York.

<TEXT>
   India staged a token withdrawal of
600 soldiers Saturday and opened negotiations with Sri Lanka on the
departure of the rest of its 45,000-man force sent to quell ethnic
violence.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who had demanded the removal of
``the last Indian soldier'' by the end of July, sought to portray
Saturday's hastily arranged withdrawal as a victory for his
government.
   But the action seemed likely to be viewed as too little and too
late to stop escalating assassinations and attacks on Premadasa's
government by ultranationalist members of the Sinhalese majority
ethnic group.
   The radicals oppose an Indian-brokered peace plan to grant
limited autonomy to minority Tamils in the north and east of this
island off India's southern coast.
   Indian peacekeeping forces, initially numbering barely 2,000,
arrived in Sri Lanka on July 30, 1987, to supervise the surrender
of arms by Tamil guerrillas under terms of the accord. But the
largest Tamil militant group reneged on the agreement.
   The Indian force swelled at one point to a peak of at least
70,000 men who bogged down in their own jungle war with Tamil
rebels.
   Both Indian and Sri Lankan officials said they did not know when
more Indian troops would leave. Sri Lankan and Indian teams began
three days of talks in New Delhi on Saturday on the issue. Indian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Aftab Seth said the talks ``have so far
been successful.'' He did not elaborate.
   The departing camouflage-clad Indian soldiers strode aboard the
Indian troop carrier Magar, carrying only their rifles. Some said
they were told of their departure only a few hours in advance.
   ``About 600 are leaving today,'' Gen. Amarjit Kalkat, commander
of the Indian peacekeeping force, told reporters at the harbor in
Trincomalee, about 145 miles northeast of Colombo.
   The Magar, whose Hindi name means crocodile, left Trincomalee on
Saturday night, Sri Lanka's state-run radio station reported. It
was expected to reach the Indian port of Madras, 315 miles north,
on Sunday.
   Gen. Hamilton Wanasinghe, commander of the Sri Lankan army whose
troops in Trincomalee and the rest of the northeast have been
confined to their camps since the Indians arrived, said: ``This is
a token gesture and the rest will follow.''
   The Tamil separatist war started in 1983 with attacks on Sri
Lankan troops and massacres of Sinhalese civilians. India, the
region's biggest military power, had provided sanctuary for Tamil
fighters and got drawn into the political fray by the sympathies of
its own Tamil minority of 60 million for their Sri Lankan brethren.
   But when the Indians tried to disarm the Sri Lankan Tamils, they
became the enemy. About 1,000 Indian soldiers are among the 11,000
people who have died in the insurrection in the past six years.
   Despite the small number of troops who boarded the Indian ship
Saturday, the Sri Lankan government professed optimism that more
soon would follow.
   ``It is a commencement,'' said Gen. Sepala Attygalle, Sri
Lanka's defense secretary, who flew to Trincomalee to watch the
departure.
   Asked whether he thought Saturday's withdrawal would pacify
Sinhalese extremists, Attygalle said: ``I am hopeful that there
will be a lessening of that sort of violence.''
   The government accuses Sinhalese extremists of 4,000 killings,
mostly of Sinhalese government officials and their supporters,
since the first Indian troops arrived.
   On Friday, Sri Lanka's state-run television said Premadasa's
troops shot and killed at least 74 people who violated a nationwide
curfew to denounce the Indian presence and the Sri Lankan
government. But Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne, just before
leaving Colombo for the talks in New Delhi, said the actual death
toll may have been 100 to 150. He said most killed were Sinhalese
radicals.
   The curfew, imposed at midnight Thursday, was to remain in
effect until 6 a.m. Sunday. The government said it would be imposed
again indefinitely starting at 6 p.m. Sunday. The curfew is
designed to thwart protests and attacks by Sinhalese extremists
during the second anniversary of the 1987 peace accord.
   The accord offered a measure of autonomy to Tamils in the
northeast. So far a Tamil-dominated provincial council has been
elected but has yet to assume any real powers.
   Tamils, mostly Hindu, comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people, but they are the majority in the northeast.
Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, account for 75 percent.

   Counterfeiting used to be a skilled
craft, but one recent case illustrates the Treasury agent's
greatest fear: that new photocopy technology makes it possible for
just about anyone to produce fake money.
   John P. McCoy, who was convicted last week in an operation that
made $800,000 worth of U.S. and Canadian currency, did it with a
high-tech Canon Color Laser Copier.
   It was one of the first, if not the first case of the latest in
laser copying equipment being used to counterfeit money, said
Hunter Howerton, a Secret Service agent in Charleston.
   ``At one time, counterfeiting was very specialized. It was like
an art,'' Howerton said. ``Printing used to be a very respected
tradition _ Benjamin Franklin was a printer. ...
   ``Now, all you have to be able to do is press a button.''
   McCoy's $20, $50 and $100 bills looked fine on first inspection,
but experts can easily distinguish a photocopied bill.
   Tiny stars on the treasury seal came out as circles, and the
backgrounds behind portraits of Jackson, Grant and Franklin were
washed out instead of salt-and-peppered, said Secret Service Agent
Art Dalton. The paper was different, too, missing the red and blue
fibers woven into real bills.
   Under a microscope, the difference is obvious to an expert.
Letters printed with real plates are raised from the paper's
surface and sharp-edged, while photocopied letters are flat and
fuzzy at the edges.
   ``They're good, but they're not that good,'' said Dalton, who
heads the Charleston Secret Service office.
   Canon introduced its first color copier in the 1970s and
advanced it with the use of lasers in 1987. The copiers are sold
mostly to print shops and advertising agencies whose customers
demand color copies of everything from photos and art work to
documents.
   McCoy got his by talking the owner of a truck parts store into
buying him one for $35,000. In return, McCoy offered to split the
profit.
   Manufacturers worry that their copiers could be put to illegal
use, but there is little they can do but warn customers and suggest
that they control access to the most sophisticated machines, said
Hajime Hirai, a spokesman for Canon Inc.
   ``We're doing our best, but it's very difficult,'' Hirai said.
   McCoy, 43, of Slaters Branch, Ky., was convicted July 24 in U.S.
District Court in Huntington of counterfeiting, and could be
sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in prison and fined $500,000.
   The counterfeiting scheme was broken up when three accomplices
were caught and turned McCoy in.
   In a separate case, McCoy was convicted in June of bank robbery
and killing a federal witness.
   The government already has talked to Canon officials about
compiling a list of color copier owners, Hirai said, but the
company says it can't and shouldn't.
   ``We don't have any legal responsibilities to keep records on
our customers. And a lot of times, dealers don't want to disclose
their customers' names. Their customers want things kept
confidential.''
   There already is talk of changing the design of U.S. currency.
   Canadian, French and British currency are hard to reproduce
either because of colors used or because the paper contains a
magnetic strip.
   But some people say the crooks will always find a way to get
around changes.
   ``You could make an invisible marking on a bill that can be seen
by a copier, but it doesn't matter,'' Hirai said. ``The
counterfeiters, they'll just think of another way.''

   Justice of the Peace Agapito
Gonzalez keeps the civil docket book on a chair near the pool table
and hears cases between posters of bikini-clad women and bags of
potato and corn chips.
   The courtroom philosophy hangs on a sign: ``A man's got to
believe in something. I believe I'll have another beer.''
   It's cantina justice at the G &amp; G bar, where Gonzalez has been
holding court at the family-owned business since 1966. Defendants
are free to stick around for a cold one.
   ``They stick around, they drink beer and all that,'' said the
75-year-old JP. ``Sometimes they phone me. They want to come and
get married here and I married them here.''
   ``They want to give me a tip, but it is not acceptable. You
cannot give any tip to justices. It is against the law, not even a
gift.''
   Near trophies and antlers and an old eight-track tape deck,
cowboys drink and listen to Mexican music on a juke box. The aroma
of burning mesquite and sizzling meat blows in from the back porch.
The G &amp; G offers free barbecue and sells its beer and chips.
   Gonzalez calls his son from behind the bar to bring the docket
to his bench, an aging chrome dinette set.
   ``He's the law west of Highway 281,'' joked County Clerk Arnoldo
Gonzalez, leaning on the bar. He's a regular at the G &amp; G and a
nephew of the JP. ``It used to be pretty bad around here, knifings.
The last 10 years it has mellowed.''
   Constable Bartolo Guajardo says he can't remember the last
murder in Jim Wells County Precinct 6, in deep south Texas about 50
miles from the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``People are friendly here because we are all related,'' Agapito
Gonzalez said.
   The G &amp; G is one of a few buildings at the center of Palito
Blanco, named after the native hackberry trees with bumpy, whitish
bark. The town of 300 is surrounded by ranches, farms and miles of
barbed wire.
   Gonzalez deals mostly with speeding tickets, poaching and
tenant-landlord disputes. A Texas justice of the peace is a locally
elected court officer. A JP can perform marriages, issue death
certificates, and, especially in rural areas, issue criminal
warrants and conduct bond hearings.
   Gonzalez hears jury trials at the schoolhouse, but that isn't
very often. His last jury case was two years ago. The JP, known for
light fines and mercy, still worries the jury was too harsh.
   ``It was a speeding case, a fellow driving 100 miles an hour,''
Gonzalez recalled. ``He lose the case. They charge him a little
over $100, the jury. ... It wasn't fair, because I asked them to
give him a break, because he was a young boy, he looked like being
a very nice boy.
   ``There is no rich people here in Palito Blanco,'' Gonzalez
said. ``People here are all very poor. They don't have money. They
work for their living. Most of them get a little less than $100 a
week and you can't live now with $100 a week.''
   Even rich out-of-towners are likely to get off easy, the JP
says. Highway patrolmen, he complains, do not give enough warnings.
   Gonzalez, who plans to retire next year, worries about the
retirees who get speeding tickets on U.S. 281 on their way south
for the winter.
   ``I try to give them a break, because they are old people like
me and sometimes they are not driving as fast as (the officer)
said,'' Gonzalez said.
   And then there's the story about the Lubbock banker caught
poaching deer on a nearby ranch.
   Gonzalez gave him the minimum fine. Then he talked the game
wardens into tying the deer onto the banker's car.

   A truck driver for a security company
disappeared with $2.7 million in cash when the guards in the truck
got out to pick up more cash, police said Saturday.
   The robbery occurred Friday evening when the Candi security
company's truck stopped in front of a pastry shop in north Madrid
and two security guards got out to pick up money for delivery to a
bank, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   When the guards returned, the truck was gone, they told police.
   The spokesman said the truck was found three hours later in an
underground parking lot. He said it contained 15 bags with 170,000
in cash, the driver's service revolver, and a 12-gauge shotgun.
   ``The guards still can't believe this has happened,'' the
spokesman said. ``We're looking all over for the driver and the
cash, but the whole thing still seems a mystery.'' It was believed
to be the biggest robbery of an armored vehicle in Spain's history.
   The spokesman identified the driver as Dionisio Rodriguez
Martin, 40, of Madrid.

howitzers and rocket launchers Saturday over the ruins of a virtual
ghost city, deserted by more than a million people fleeing fighting
that has left hundreds dead.
   Police said eight people were killed and 42 wounded in overnight
and morning exchanges across the divided capital, where 1.5 million
people once lived.
   ``My city is dying. I'll die with it. I won't leave,'' Ihsan
Salam, a retired civil servant, said with tears in his eyes.
   ``I'll stay here. If I have to die, I'll die in dignity in my
apartment, in my bed. I don't want to live as a refugee,'' said the
70-year-old Sunni Moslem who lives in west Beirut's Zasrif district.
   The summer wind kicked up dust storms in the dirty streets, and
cats chased rats across piles of stinking garbage littering the
once-fashionable Hamra commercial thoroughfare.
   Banks, restaurants, stores and offices were closed, and the once
swarming streets were almost deserted. Fires blazed out of control
and palls of thick black smoke billowed from gaping holes in
apartment buildings.
   Salam is among only about 250,000 people still living in Beirut
after more than four months of almost daily artillery duels.
   Saturday's casualties raised the overall toll to 502 killed and
2,056 wounded in the 19-week confrontation between Christian army
commander Gen. Michel Aoun's troops and Syrian forces.
   The fighting erupted after Aoun imposed a naval blockade on
illegal ports run by Moslem militias south of Beirut in an effort
to recover around $100 million annually in lost customs revenues.
   The Syrians joined the Moslem militias shelling the Christian
enclave north of Beirut in retaliation and blocked its land
entrances.
   The Syrians, who consider Lebanon within their sphere of
influence, keep about 40,000 troops in predominantly Moslem areas
under a 1976 Arab League mandate to end the civil war, now in its
15th year.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing
rules, said about half Beirut's population fled to safer areas in
the first three months of clashes.
   About 350,000 others deserted the capital during the past 10
days during a devastating bombardment of residential districts, he
said.
   Most evacuees headed to south Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa valley
and summer resorts in mountains northeast of the capital.
   The thuds of exploding shells echoed across the wooded hills
south of Beirut early in the day as Syrian army gunners pounded the
Christian suburb of Baabda east of the capital.
   Baabda houses the presidential palace where Aoun has his
residence and headquarters.
   Several motorists, heading to Beirut to inspect their deserted
apartments and businesses, turned back to avoid being caught in
cross fire.
   ``They're shelling his palace. He'll respond soon. I don't want
to be around when his response starts,'' said Marwan Shaar, a Sunni
who owns a currency trading company.
   He was speaking in the Syrian-policed Khaldeh area, seven miles
south of Beirut. The area came under fierce shelling overnight by
Christian gunners.
   The police spokesman said ``thousands'' of people were spending
nights in cars on river banks and seaside boulevards in south
Lebanon, because they couldn't find accommodations or couldn't
afford sky-high rents.
   Hundreds of children played in the Awali river just outside
Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut. Their parents slept in cars or on
mattresses and blankets on the river bank.
   ``At least it is safe here,'' said Samir Shatilla, a salesman
for an appliance company in west Beirut.
   Shatilla said he was spending the nights with his wife and two
sons in his old brown Plymouth.

<HEAD>Chileans Show Little Interest in Constitutional Referendum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an unprecedented show of unity, both
the military government and its political foes are encouraging
Chileans to approve democratic reforms of the constitution in a
referendum Sunday.
   Most Chileans, however, have shown little interest in the vote,
apparently believing the changes will pass even with a small
turnout.
   Voting is mandatory, but government officials and opposition
leaders still fear many of the 7.6 million registered voters will
stay home.
   President Augusto Pinochet has sent all 16 of his Cabinet
ministers on tours of provincial cities to explain the proposed
reforms and ask people to vote.
   The head of the National Electoral Service, Juan Garcia, warned
that those failing to vote will be prosecuted and may be fined
$100. That's a lot of money in a country where about a third of the
labor force earns the legal mimimum salary of $66 a month or less.
   The referendum asks Chileans to approve or reject as a package
54 changes in the 1980 constitution, which was written by the
military.
   The changes include easing restrictions on Marxist activity,
which has been banned.
   It dilutes the government's power in the Senate by increasing
the number of seats from 36 to 48 and leaving the
government-appointed bloc at nine. It also adds another civilian
member to a powerful, military-dominated National Security Council.
   Other changes would eliminate the presidential power to send
Chileans into exile and to dissolve the lower house of Congress.
Requirements for future constitutional reform would be eased.
   Both the government and opposition agreed to the text of the
proposed changes.
   Officials said the proposals were viewed as ``democratizing''
the constitution, although the opposition had repeatedly said they
were insufficient.
   ``The constitution continues to be anti-democratic, but it's a
first step which will allow us all to build together a really
democratic institutional system,'' said Ricardo Lagos, a prominent
Socialist leader.
   Constitutional experts and political leaders had said public
apathy during the campaign stemmed from the widespread belief the
proposed changes would be approved even with a small turnout.
   ``There's nothing dramatic about this referendum,'' said Edgardo
Boeninger, vice president of the centrist Christian Democratic
Party, the largest in the opposition.
   ``There is no one to beat this time,'' he told The Associated
Press.
   He also said Chileans had displayed little interest because they
were ill informed and considered the changes very complex.
   Nearly all the major political parties and the government urged
approval of the changes in 40-second television spots broadcast by
all the country's stations. The spots were allocated at no charge
to opposition parties.
   About the only controversy of the campaign broke out when the
government censored at least 10 opposition television spots,
claiming they were illegal. It said they were intended as party
propaganda _ not to clarify the referendum.
   The country's last referendum was Oct. 5, and turnout was 97
percent. At issue was whether Pinochet's rule should be extended
until 1997. The extension was overwhelmingly rejected.

   Canadian marathon swimmer Vicki Keith, still
tired from crossing the English Channel two weeks ago, had to
abandon her effort to butterfly from Santa Catalina Island to the
mainland after 19 hours.
   ``I don't consider this a failure,'' she said. ``I figure I just
went out there and gave it my best shot.''
   Keith's support crew persuaded her to quit after the exhausted
and hallucinating athlete gained less than half a mile in the last
eight hours Friday, said crew member Craig Williams.
   She had covered more than 18 of the 24 miles across the San
Pedro Channel when she gave in.
   Keith thought that a huge tanker was inches from her as she
swam, Williams said. Hallucinations are normal for her during
marathon swims, he said, but not until she's been in the water for
36 hours.
   The 28-year-old schoolteacher mastered all five of the Great
Lakes last summer and raised more than $550,000 for a Toronto
sports training and fitness center and a children's aquatic center.
   This summer she made the 42-mile English Channel crossing and
swam 14 miles across Australia's Sydney Harbor, also in marathons
associated with children's charities.

   LAUDERDALE-BY-THE-SEA, Fla. (AP) _ After an insult from a
much-younger man, old pro wrestler Buddy ``Nature Boy'' Rogers
added some injury.
   A 30-year-old rowdy picked on the wrong old man, police said
last week. Rogers, 68, had just ordered lunch in a sandwich shop
when Theodore Terhune of Pompano Beach burst in looking for someone
named Mike.
   When he was told Mike wasn't there, he began verbally abusing a
pair of employees, police said, and Rogers asked him to quiet down.
   ``He called me an old man,'' said Rogers, in his day the star of
the pro wrestling circuit and still powerfully built. ``He said:
`If you want a piece of me, you can have me right now.'
   ``I pushed him against a wall and he picked up a chair and threw
it at me,'' Rogers said. ``Then I unloaded. I gave him a shot and
he must have flown five feet into a refrigerator. Then I nailed him
in the stomach, and he flew into the kitchen.''

   Director George Romero is back at the scene of
his first, 1968 horror classic, ``The Night of the Living Dead,''
to make his 11th feature film.
   ``Now it's sort of become a signature. I'm known as that guy who
works in Pittsburgh,'' he said recently during filming of ``The
Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar.''
   ``Anything's cheaper than New York or (Los Angeles), but that's
not really the factor,'' Romero said. ``It's a varied kind of look.
All people don't want their films to have palm trees in them.''
   Filming of ``M. Valdemar,'' starring Adrienne Barbeau, Ramy Zada
and E.G. Marshall, started July 10 and is scheduled to conclude
Aug. 5.
   The film is an adaptation of a short story by Edgar Allan Poe
and will be teamed with another adaptation of a Poe story, ``The
Black Cat,'' and released under the title ``Two Evil Eyes.''
   ``I grew up with Poe. I've always had an affinity for the genre.
Even as a kid, those were the movies that I watched and the comic
books I read, and Poe was the only author I could actually read in
school and get my kicks,'' said Romero.

   Cowboy singer Rex Allen hasn't got a case
against the late Slim Pickens or the actor's family or estate
because of injuries he sustained at Pickens' Wyoming cabin, the
state's Supreme Court ruled.
   The singer sued for damages for loss of sight in one eye
following a 1983 fall, but the court said Friday there was no
negligence on the part of Pickens.
   Allen slipped on overgrown grass partly covering steps to the
cabin while looking for a key Pickens had at one time told him was
hidden. At the time of the accident, Pickens was seriously ill in
California.
   In upholding a summary judgment that had gone against Allen in
lower court, the Supreme Court ruled that neither the Pickens
family nor the actor's estate was responsible for maintaining the
cabin for unexpected guests.

   Philadelphia Orchestra music director
Riccardo Muti has been named an honorary ambassador by the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the orchestra reported.
   The formal announcement was made Saturday in Salzburg, Austria,
by U.N. High Commissioner Jean-Pierre Hocke. Muti, who is also
music director of Teatro alla Scala in Milan, Italy, immediately
announced two benefit concerts to be held in 1990 in Milan and in
1991 at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia.
   Muti's acceptance is a public commitment to the ``defense of
human rights and to the cause of the world's 14 million refugees
whose basic human rights have been threatened,'' said Bonnie
Arnold, orchestra spokeswoman.
   ``If we look at history, artists of all kinds, painters,
scluptors, writers and musicians have always been amongst the most
influential and the most deeply involved members of society,'' Muti
said in Salzburg.

   Cambodia's agony began nearly 20 years ago when
pro-American generals ousted a neutralist prince. Since then,
millions have been killed, made homeless or fled the killing field
that their homeland has become.
   The 1970 coup against Cambodian leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk
set off a cycle of national devastation that an international
conference in Paris is now trying to reverse.
   Under Gen. Lon Nol, the U.S.-backed coup leaders took on the
communists of neighboring Vietnam and their Cambodian allies, the
Khmer Rouge, in a five-year war.
   Some people called it a ``sideshow'' to the Vietnam War.
   But it killed an estimated 1 million people as ground troops
engaged in fierce combat and Washington launched one of the most
intense aerial bombardments in history.
   On April 17, 1975, the black-clad Khmer Rouge marched into the
Cambodian capital and began to herd its 2 million people into the
countryside at gunpoint.
   Khmer Rouge's ``Year Zero'' had begun: society was to be totally
cleansed and all resisters eliminated in the Southeast Asian nation.
   The most conservative estimates say hundreds of thousands were
executed or died of diseases and hunger in Khmer Rouge labor camps.
The current Cambodian government claims 3.3 million died as leader
Pol Pot turned on ``class enemies'' who included children, the
handicapped, and anyone who spoke a foreign language.
   Vietnam's 1978 invasion rid the country of the Khmer Rouge but
spawned another conflict.
   From jungle bases along the Thai-Cambodian border, a three-party
coalition led by Sihanouk mounted a guerrilla campaign against the
Vietnamese and the new Cambodian government they had installed. The
Khmer Rouge formed part of the coalition.
   More than a quarter-million civilians remain in sprawling,
vulnerable camps along the embattled frontier. Fighting in the
interior and uncertainty about the future hampers development in
Cambodia, one of the world's poorest countries.
   With Vietnam promising to pull out its remaining forces in
Cambodia by the end of September, threats of more bloodshed looms.
The powerful Khmer Rouge could attempt a comeback and carry out
another reign of terror.

   The nation's governors opened their annual
conference Saturday with a call for more investment in
transportation and a complaint that the federal government is
hoarding money that should be spent on highways and airports.
   ``Unfortunately, when it comes to transportation, America is
often stuck in neutral,'' said Virginia's Democratic Gov. Gerald
Baliles, chairman of the National Governors' Association.
   President Bush planned to arrive Monday to address the governors.
   The governors' association sought to steer clear of partisanship
during its meeting, which concludes Tuesday, and planned to focus
on efforts to improve U.S. performance in the international economy.
   The bipartisan association released a report saying improvements
in transportation are essential for the nation to become more
competitive with foreign industry. It warned that transportation
facilities ``are deteriorating at a faster rate than they are being
repaired or replaced.''
   The report called for more regional and federal planning,
increased use of tolls, developer fees and other user fees, and
release of uncommitted balances in federal trust funds for
highways, aviation, mass transit and waterways.
   At an opening news conference, Baliles and Illinois Republican
Gov. James Thompson charged that the Bush administration and the
Reagan administration before it have withheld billions of dollars
from the states in highway and airport trust funds. They said the
amounts sent to the state were restricted in order to count the
reserves in the federal budget and make the federal debt appear
smaller.
   ``Our view is that money represents tax dollars already paid by
the people of this country, and they ought to be spent for the
purpose for which they were collected, and not used to play games
with the size of the budget deficit in Washington,'' Baliles said.
   Baliles said as much as $19 billion was held in the two trust
funds from money collected through the federal taxes on gasoline
and airplane fares. Charilyn W. Cowan, director of capital
resources for the governors' association staff, estimated as much
as $13 billion of that amount has accumulated as an uncommitted
cash surplus or is behing withheld from the states for various
technical reasons.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner will address the
governors Monday, and Thompson said he intended to ask Skinner
about the trust funds. Skinner and other Transportation Department
officials have told the governors in the past that much of the
money is already obligated for future spending on transportation
projects.
   Snarled traffic and shipping delays caused by deteriorating
transportation systems, the report said, add to the cost of doing
business for American companies.
   ``The vitality of both transportation and commerce is now
threatened by a pattern of underinvestment and neglect,'' said
Baliles. ``Today, rather than being the pride of America, our
transportation systems are becoming one of its limiting factors,
restraining economic growth.''
   The report was written by a task force of governors headed by
Thompson, the conference host, who recently announced he would not
seek a fifth term.
   Thompson's task force cited estimates that $1 trillion to $3
trillion in spending will be required over the next 20 years to
bring the nation's transportation infrastructure ``into reasonable
condition.'' That would require annual outlays of $50 billion to
$150 billion.
   The report cited state efforts to fill the gap left by
reductions in federal spending on transportation. But it said
states have been constrained by federal tax laws restricting use of
tax-exempt bonds for public works.
   ``We need to find the political will for America to make the
investment in our transportation infrastructure, an investment that
will help keep the American marketplace at the center of the
world's commerce,'' said Thompson.
   Democrats hold a 28 to 22 majority over Republicans among the 50
state governors, after picking up one seat in the 1988 election.
   The full group planned to consider a resolution, already
approved by its executive committee, urging action to reduce the
federal deficit while protecting ``safety net'' social programs and
avoiding a tax increase ``if possible.'' It advocates ``a selective
freeze'' on defense and domestic spending.
   The abortion issue was not on the governors' agenda but was
expected to be discussed privately. The meeting is the first
bipartisan gathering of governors since the Supreme Court's recent
decision permitting states greater leeway in regulating abortions.
   At least one group, the National Abortion Rights Action League,
which supports a woman's right to have an abortion, said it had
obtained a police permit for a small demonstration Sunday.
   By prior agreement, Iowa's Republican Gov. Terry Branstad is to
become chairman of the governors association at the end of the
meeting, succeeding Baliles, who who leaves office as governor at
the end of this year.

   Police disguised as relatives of a kidnapped
businessman killed two bandits in a highway shootout Saturday after
tricking the kidnappers into thinking they were on the trail of
$3.7 million in ransom.
   Following the shooting, police combed the coutryside outside
Rome in search of the victim, Dante Belardinelli, whose Jolly Caffe
business distributes coffee and other food products.
   The shootout, which also left two bandits and four policemen
wounded, occurred a day before a deadline set by Belardinelli's
kidnappers.
   Slices of both his ears were found in an envelope in a bar July
23 in Bologna, along with a photo of Belardinelli after his ear
lobes were cut off and a demand for ransom money, reportedly $3.7
million. They said if the money was not paid July 30, Belardinelli,
65, would be killed.
   He was kidnapped May 30 as he drove to his home in the hills
outside Florence.
   In their demand, the kidnappers told Belardinelli's daughter to
drive up and down the highway from Arezzo in central Italy to
Reggio Calabria in the south, a distance of about 600 miles, with
the ransom until the bandits caught up with her and gave her a
signal.
   The daughter was told to drive a Fiat 126 with a chair mounted
on a roof luggage rack.
   Italian television and new agency reports said a Florence
investigating magistrate decided it was too dangerous for
Belardinelli's daughter to drive the car.
   SWAT team police, chosen for their resemblance to the daughter
and two other relatives, instead got in the Fiat and began driving,
authorities said.
   When the Fiat was on the highway outside Rome, a bigger car with
four people inside pulled up to it. When the bandits realized they
had been tricked, they opened fire with a pistol and sawed-off
shotguns, and the police fired back, the ANSA news agency reported.
   Two of the four bandits were killed and the other two were
wounded and captured. One of the police officers was in a coma,
ANSA said.
   A second car, also believed to hold bandits, sped away, the
reports said.
   ANSA said the four bandits had been linked to previous
kidnappings. It quoted the Florence magistrate, Pierluigi Vigna, as
saying the police did not have any ransom money with them.

   A barrage of rockets fired by Moslem
guerrillas slammed into Kabul on Saturday, with one spraying
shrapnel and glass around a crowded bazaar. At least 14 people were
killed in the attacks, official Radio Kabul said.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said the
U.S.-backed guerrillas are stepping up such attacks to give them
more leverage before Monday's U.S.-Soviet talks on Afghanistan in
Stockholm, Sweden.
   The Soviets, who fought alongside Afghan government troops for
nine years, are the Marxist government's major arms supplier.
   Amani said 12 people were killed Saturday. He said eight people
died and 40 were injured when the rocket hit the bazaar. Other
rockets landed around the center and south of the capital, killing
four people and injuring 16, he said.
   Official Radio Kabul said 14 people were killed and 50 injured
in the attacks. The broadcast was monitored in Islamabad, Pakistan.
   Diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said they
counted 30 rockets fired Saturday.
   In the past month, the rebels, who call themselves Mujahedeen or
Islamic holy warriors, have been launching long-range rockets from
behind the hills that ring this mile-high capital. More than 200
people have died, virtually all civilians.
   Abdul Halim, a 50-year-old school employee who suffered shrapnel
wounds, said he was walking across the street when the rocket
exploded at the Kote Sangi Bazaar in western Kabul. ``Whoever fired
the rocket, they are anti-Moslem,'' he said.
   ``People are killed from this action, and I want it to stop,''
said a student at the bazaar who identified himself only as
Najibullah.
   At the hospital where many victims were taken, bloody stretchers
sat abandoned in the corridor. A knot of men and women scanned a
list of names of victims.
   Dr. M. Nasser, who refused to give his first name, said three
children were among the dead there.
   Standing in a ward surrounded by moaning survivors, Nasser
denounced both the United States and the Soviets.
   ``The Afghan people don't like the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A.
because the people think the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. want war in
our country,'' he said. ``Afghans want Afghanistan for the
Afghans.''
   Another doctor pointed to his white jacket and said: ``All of us
are wearing coats of peace because we want peace _ no more
revolution.''
   A third doctor, still wearing his operating room mask, added:
``This doesn't mean we don't want good relations with the United
States or the U.S.S.R. because we need their help, but we want our
country back.''
   Other doctors and nurses nodded in approval.
   In the ward, weeping relatives leaned over beds of the injured,
and one man lunged for a doctor, shouting in anger. He was
restrained and led out.
   The guerrillas are fighting to set up an Islamic republic in
Afghanistan. The war began after a 1978 coup that set up a Marxist
government in the country.

<HEAD>Hungary's Communist Party No Longer Advocates Atheism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a major policy change regarding
religion, the Hungarian Communist Party announced Saturday that it
will no longer require members to be atheists and that it will stop
meddling in church affairs.
   The changes were approved Friday by the Central Committee and
announced Saturday in a communique carried by the official MTI news
agency.
   ``The Hungarian Socialist Workers Party is not an atheist party
but a party committed to the cause of social progress,'' Central
Committee member Janos Berecz said Friday after the committee met
in Budapest.
   Berecz, who presented the meeting with a report he helped
prepare on religion, told reporters the party will now be open to
people with religious convictions and that it will ensure
separation of church and state.
   Recently, the party abolished the Office for Church Affairs,
which supervised and often interfered with organized religion.
   Speaking at a news conference, Berecz ``emphasized the need of
abandoning the inflexible rules and guaranteeing freedom of
conscience within the party,'' MTI reported. He said the party's
bylaws will be modified to reflect the changes in policy the
Central Committee has approved.
   There are no official statistics on church membership in
Hungary, but 70 percent of Hungarian Christians are believed to be
Roman Catholics, although a large number of them do not regularly
attend church.
   In the past, some party members were known to have been
Catholics, but they rarely dared to profess their beliefs in public.
   ``Making the free exercise of religion complete, the dialogue
between Marxists and the faithful should continue on the highest
level,'' Berecz said.
   Pope John Paul II plans to visit Hungary for the first time in
1991, and diplomatic relations with the Vatican may be
re-established soon.
   The dramatic police changes may be an attempt by the party to
polish up its image prior to next year's first multiparty elections
in Hungary since 1948.
   Party leaders decided Friday to hold the party's congress Oct.
6, a day earlier than originally scheduled. The goal of the meeting
is to unite divided party members and chart winning policies for
the 1990 elections.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister Leaves Hospital After Heart Attack</HEAD>

   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher left a city hospital Saturday, nine days after suffering a
heart attack.
   The 62-year-old politician was picked up at Bonn's Maltese
Hospital by his wife, Barbara.
   He walked down the hospital sidewalk without help and shook
hands with his doctors before leaving. He looked pale but managed
to shout ``Get well!'' to patients who waved at him from a hospital
balcony.
   He and his wife were driven to their private home in a Bonn
suburb.
   The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Genscher ``feels
good'' and plans to start his four-week vacation, which had been
planned earlier. It did not say if he would return to work right
after the vacation.
   Genscher was hospitalized July 20 after a mild heart attack.
   He has long suffered health problems, including heart trouble
and tuberculosis. He was hospitalized in March for urinary-tract
surgery, but he quickly rebounded and resumed his 16-hour-a-day
work schedule and nearly non-stop travel.

   Coleman Young's campaign for a fifth mayoral term
was considered a breeze until U.S. Rep. John Conyers unexpectedly
entered the race last week.
   The 13-term congressman lacks the local political organization
and estimated $5 million in campaign funds that Young has, but
Conyers is well-known and liked in Detroit. Early polls show him
running tight with Young, and the two dominating the Sept. 12
non-partisan primary in which 13 candidates will be winnowed to two.
   ``It could very well be,'' a close race, Young said late last
week. ``I don't expect any race to be easy.''
   That was a sharp contrast to Young's earlier statement about
Conyers. ``Now that he's in, I will shoot at him like he's a
rabbit.''
   Wilbur Rich, a political science professor at Wayne State
University and author of a biography on Young, played down the
significance of the polls.
   ``If (Conyers) survives the primary, then I think there will be
a very tight and very bitter race. I think Conyers probably thinks
Coleman has something about his personality people don't like and
will try to build on that.''
   Young, 71, defeated Detroit accountant Tom Barrow with 61
percent of the vote in 1985. Before Conyers, 60, entered the race,
Barrow was the favorite to meet Young in November.
   ``Coleman has got one good campaign left in him,'' Rich said.
``I think he will be more colorful, more flamboyant in his campaign
rhetoric. I think he wants to show people he still wants to do the
job.''
   Barrow said he still thinks he will win the right to face Young
again.
   Young, who hasn't faced a real challenge since his first bid for
mayor in 1973, has been under attack this year. Critics accuse him
of failing to reverse the city's chronic crime and unemployment
problems.
   On a more personal level, Young agreed earlier this year to pay
child support following a highly publicized paternity suit in which
blood tests confirmed he fathered the 6-year-old son of a former
city employee.
   Even with a perception of Young's vulnerability, Conyers' entry
into the race baffled some observers who question why he would give
up his seniority in Congress, where he is chairman of the
Government Operations Committee, the House watchdog panel.
   ``I am very puzzled,'' Rich said. ``He's been around a long time
and could really do a lot of good for Detroit in that position,''
in Congress.
   Rich believes Conyers may be laying the groundwork for 1993,
when Young is expected to step down.
   ``I think this is going to be a showcase for '93 ... the
post-Young era,'' he said.
   How long Conyers' popularity will hold out is another question.
   ``I think John has always been a man of symbols, always engaged
in symbolic events,'' Rich said, referring to Conyers' opposition
to the Vietnam War, his involvement in former President Richard
Nixon's impeachment and his support of a holiday honoring the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.
   ``Whatever his flaws are, they'll come out,'' Barrow said.
   City Council President Erma Henderson also could be a factor in
the primary by siphoning support from Conyers, her longtime friend
with whom she appeared arm-in-arm the day he filed his nominating
petitions. Henderson said Friday she is in the race to stay.
   Most observers think Henderson and Barrow are preparing for
1993, when pop singer Stevie Wonder, an early Motown recording
star, has said he wants to run for mayor.
   Two polls taken last week showed the extent of support for Young
and Conyers. A Detroit Free Press-WXYZ-TV poll showed Young with 31
percent and Conyers with 27 percent of voter support in the
primary. Barrow and Henderson trailed with 13 percent and 9 percent.
   In a Detroit News poll, 44 percent said they would vote for
Conyers in a runoff, while 43 percent would suppport Young.
   Both polls questioned 500 registered voters and were conducted
Tuesday and Wednesday, after Conyers announced Monday.

<HEAD>Root Says He Considered Allowing Himself to Drown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHELBY, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thomas Root, who survived after his plane
wandered 800 miles along the East Coast and crashed into the
Atlantic, said Saturday he did not set out to kill himself, but
briefly considered suicide waiting for rescue.
   ``It was at that moment that _ and only that moment _ that I
ever stared the notion of suicide right in the face,'' Root said.
``It sent _ it was almost a jolt of electricity, right through me.
The very thought running through my mind. ... I started swimming,
swimming erratically and hard, and wasted energy in the process
before I calmed myself down.''
   Root made his comments in an interview broadcast Saturday by
radio station WSWR. Root is an owner of the station in this
north-central Ohio community.
   WSWR reporter Jim Norris said he interviewed Root Thursday at
the home of Root's parents in Plymouth, Ohio, where he has been
recovering from his injuries, which included an unexplained gunshot
wound. Root, reached there Saturday morning by The Associated
Press, declined to comment further.
   Norris said Root left Plymouth later Saturday headed for
Washington, D.C.
   Root, 36, an Alexandria, Va., communications lawyer, was en
route from Washington's National Airport to Rocky Mount, N.C., July
13 when he told air traffic controllers he was having trouble
breathing. He put his plane on autopilot and military planes kept
watch on him until his plane ran out of fuel and ditched near the
Bahamas.
   Root said he was unconscious until the plane hit the water and
did not know how he received a gunshot wound to the abdomen, which
doctors noticed after his rescue. He checked out of a Hollywood,
Fla., hospital Monday.
   Root said pain and exhaustion almost overcame him while he
fought to stay afloat until rescuers could arrive.
   ``I hurt an awful lot while I was swimming and I don't know why.
I knew I had a knot in my stomach. I knew it was very difficult to
use my left arm,'' he said.
   He said reports since the crash _ including allegations of
financial troubles and attacks on his credibility _ have shaken his
faith in the media.
   ``In the week following my crash, I became some kind of a drug
dealer and a gun smuggler. My law practice was taken apart,'' Root
said. ``It seemed as though the media were beating the bushes for
anybody in Washington who wanted to take a potshot at me.''
   Root was sued Thursday by a group of investors in New Orleans
who allege he cost them $125,000 in 1987 when he represented them
in a bid to obtain a Federal Communications Commission license. The
lawsuit accuses Root of legal malpractice.
   Military pilots who followed Root's Cessna 210 over the Atlantic
reported seeing the pilot slumped at the controls, but said his
head and the plane's sun visor moved several times.
   Although blood tests for carbon monoxide were negative, Root
said he believes a carbon dioxide buildup may have caused him to
black out during the flight. He said a former Navy diver had
described incidents in which carbon dioxide would build up in the
lungs, leading to headaches and hard breathing and lapses of
consciousness.
   ``You know something's wrong, but you don't know what,'' he
said. ``And when you do lapse into unconsciousness, it's a very
troubled unconsciousness, and you're contstantly trying to pull
yourself out. (It) sounded to me an awful lot like what I went
through.''
   Root said he was unaware he had been shot until doctors told him
at the hospital. He has acknowledged keeping a loaded revolver in
the plane's glove compartment. Root and his relatives speculated
the .32-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson may have gone off on impact, a
theory the manufacturer discounted.
   ``When I asked questions about it at Hollywood Memorial
Hospital, the doctor suggested to me that if it had happened before
impact, significantly before impact, he doubted that I would have
had the strength to swim around for 15 minutes in the ocean till I
got pulled out,'' Root said.
   Root said he has hired a Washington lawyer primarily to quell
``the hysteria'' generated by the crash.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Kenneth R. May, retired bishop of the
Western Pennsylvania-West Virginia Synod of the former Lutheran
Church in America, has died. He was 65.
   May died Friday in Allegheny General Hospital of complications
of an aortic aneurysm, said Bishop Donald J. McCoid, who heads the
Southwestern Pennsylvania Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church
in America.
   May retired as bishop Dec. 31, 1987, when the Lutheran Church in
America merged with the American Lutheran Church and the American
Evangelical Lutheran Church to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church
in America.
   May headed the 151,000-member LCA synod from 1974 to 1987.
   ``He was a person who was a strong and sensitive leader, a very
good friend and a person who loved the church dearly,'' McCoid said.
   May led the synod in the mid-1980s during its conflicts with the
Denominational Ministry Strategy, a confrontational movement that
aimed to call attention to the plight of the unemployed. May
ordered two pastors involved with the movement to give up their
pulpits.
   May was born in New Brighton, northwest of Pittsburgh.
   He is survived by a wife, a son, two daughters, and a grandchild.

<HEAD>Byelorussians Debate Evacuation from Chernobyl Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists say 106,000 people should be evacuated
from their villages in Byelorussia due to contamination from the
Chernobyl nuclear accident, not 11,000 as the government
recommends, Tass said Saturday.
   Scientists and legislators speaking before the Byelorussian
Republic's legislature also said a broader program is needed to
provide a normal life for people of the region, the official news
agency reported.
   The cost of such a large resettlement would reach $15.6 billion,
well beyond the finanical capabilities of the republic just north
of the power plant, which is in the Ukraine.
   The estimate exceeds the $12.5 billion official figure for the
cumulative cost of the Chernobyl cleanup.
   An explosion at the plant, the worst nuclear accident ever,
scattered radiation across hundreds of miles. The accident killed
31 people, according to official accounts.
   ``Chernobyl is a disaster of the whole country, so the whole
country must participate in curing the wounds,'' Tass said in
describing the arguments presented at the legislative session. It
did not say when the meeting was held.
   The deputies, who were not identified, argued that over eight to
10 years, complete resettlement would be less expensive than trying
to improve living conditions in the contaminated area.
   A Byelorussian parliamentary commission will consider the
question, Tass said.
   More than 130,000 people have been evacuated from homes in the
immediate vicinity of Chernobyl.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 20 nations, including the United States and
Soviet Union, begin an international conference Sunday aimed at
ending a conflict in Cambodia that the warring factions appear
unable to resolve.
   After three days of meetings in preparation for the conference,
the four Cambodian factions agreed only on seating arrangements for
their representatives and on the quality of a catered lunch.
   Left for the international conference to tackle are the
monitoring of Vietnam's military pullout from Cambodia; the shape
of an interim Cambodian government; and the future role of the
Khmer Rouge, ousted from power after the Vietnamese invasion in
1978.
   On the eve of the meeting, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
ruled out participation of Khmer Rouge leaders in any future
government.
   Baker met for 3{ hours Saturday with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze, one of dozens of pre-conference meetings
scheduled between visiting officials.
   A Soviet spokesman, Vitaly Churkin, said there was ``a large
area of common ground'' on Cambodia, and that both sides did not
want to see the Khmer Rouge return to power.
   A senior State Department official said both countries stressed
the importance of a comprehensive solution, but still had
differences on how it should work.
   As the delegates confer, the clock will be running in Indochina:
Vietnam has reiterated that no matter what happens in Paris, it
will withdraw its remaining forces by the end of September.
   This would leave the pro-Hanoi government in Cambodia facing
alone the Khmer Rouge and two non-communist allies on the
battlefields.
   Those optimistic about peace point to two years of lower level
talks and note a softening of positions by the Soviet Union, which
backs Vietnam and Cambodia, and by China, the chief arms supplier
to the Cambodian guerrillas.
   Pessimists say outside powers, pressing to end the war, may
merely paper over differences and that the killing will continue.
   After prolonged wrangling, the four Cambodian factions agreed
last week that Cambodia will be listed as a single entity at the
conference but with four sub-delegations seated at the table. Sharp
disagreement persisted on virtually every other issue.
   ``It's like a car that reaches the edge of an abyss and cannot
continue its journey,'' said Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia one
day last week.
   The previous day, resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk said
he and Hun Sen had agreed on nothing except the excellence of the
catered Cambodian lunch.
   Hun Sen rejects the idea of Khmer Rouge participation in any
interim government, saying it would try to grab power and launch
another reign of terror. The communist ultras killed hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians in a radical revolution before being ousted.
   Sihanouk is in uneasy alliance with the Khmer Rouge guerrillas,
describing them as ``monsters'' but maintaining that excluding them
from an interim government would increase chances for more fighting.
   A U.S. policy paper for the conference said Washington would
continue to support Sihanouk as the transition leader if he
believed Khmer Rouge ``elements, not leaders'' should have an
interim role.
   Sihanouk and his allies favor a strong United Nations presence
to monitor the Vietnamese withdrawal, the disarming of the warring
sides and the supervision of general elections. Hun Sen and Vietnam
oppose major U.N. participation unless the Cambodian seat in the
United Nations, now held by Sihanouk's coalition, is vacated.
   Hun Sen and his Vietnamese backers separate the internal and
international aspects of the Cambodian problem and say each can be
dealt with separately. Sihanouk and his supporters, including
non-Communist Southeast Asia and the United States, want a
comprehensive solution.
   ``I don't see prospects for an accord between Sihanouk and Hun
Sen in Paris,'' said Southeast Asia expert Michael Leifer of
Britain recently. ``I've come to the dismal conclusion that some
kind of civil war is inevitable.''
   A number of other western Cambodia scholars who met recently in
Thailand concurred, noting the increasingly confident Cambodian
government has yet to test its military mettle against the
guerrillas.
   And the Khmer Rouge particularly, these analysts say, is
unlikely to concede anything at the negotiating table without first
seeing how much it can gain on a battlefield vacated by Vietnam's
troop.
   There are signs of give and take.
   Vietnam and China, the key regional protagonists, have improved
relations in recent months. Thailand, through which arms flow to
the guerrillas, has been a host to Hun Sen in Bangkok.
   The Soviet Union, eager to cut the drain of bankrolling
Vietnam's war machine, is reliably said to have put pressure on its
ally to compromise. In apparent opposition to Vietnam and Cambodia,
Moscow has called for substantial U.N. involvement.
   Current plans call for ministerial level talks to last until
Tuesday, to be followed by meetings of several committees to focus
on specific issues over several weeks before a final high-level
session is convened.
   There will be 20 delegations. One will represent the U.N.
secretary-general. Zimbabwe will attend as a representative of the
non-aligned movement.
   Cambodia and 17 other nations account for the remaining
delegations. In addition to the United States and Soviet Union,
other nations attending are China, Japan, Vietnam, Britain, India,
Thailand, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Laos, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, and co-hosts France and Indonesia.

<TEXT>
   A metropolis of tents will be
Virginia's 18th largest city for eight days when 30,000 Boy Scouts
set up camp for their National Jamboree.
   The gathering, which will include a high-tech video show as well
as more traditional scouting activities like archery and
flag-raising, begins Wednesday.
   ``The logistics of running an operation of this size _ it's
quite an achievement in its own right,'' said Ron Garland, director
of public relations for the jamboree.
   Fort A.P. Hill, outside Fredericksburg, has been the site for
the last two jamborees and has been designated the permanent site
for the gatherings that take place every four years.
   A 7,000-acre area at the Army fort will hold the tent city,
which will have a population of 34,000, counting scouts, staff and
volunteers.
   Workers have been busy for a year installing services, including
a new water and sewer system, a bank, a 160-bed hospital, three
post offices, and even a daily newspaper called The Jamboree Today.
   Food being trucked in includes 10 tons of butter, 20,000 heads
of lettuce, 380,000 pints of milk, 90,000 hotdogs, 70,000
hamburgers, and a million cans of soft drinks.
   For the Army, the Jamboree provides a potential logistical
nightmare similar to a large-scale movement of troops.
   ``The Army is getting a chance to do the things they're trained
to do, but they need a conflict to do it,'' said Jamboree Director
Ralph Jordan. ``But this isn't a conflict; it's a happy
association.''
   For instance, getting participants together for two shows will
require that the scouts be led out of their 20 subcamps at
staggered times so they don't all arrive at once.
   ``It's also a good image-builder for the Army.'' Jordan said.
``The kids will see the Army with a very positive attitude.''
   The jamboree will kick off with an opening show arranged by
movie director Steven Spielberg and using two 30-by-40-foot video
screens. Spielberg movie characters, including R2D2 and E.T., will
be on hand, and the show will conclude with a 15-minute laser and
fireworks display.
   For more traditional activities, there are three ``action
centers'' _ an aquatics area, a conservation area, and a fishing
lake stocked with about 20,000 fish.
   Scouts can try archery, air rifle target practice, bicycle
motorcross, a physical fitness course, volleyball, flag raising,
and a ``slippery'' tug-of-war, complete with soapy water.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will have an
exhibit, including a model of the space shuttle.
   The Boy Scouts of America have held a national jamboree almost
every four years since the first one in Washington, D.C., in 1937.
The World Organization of the Scout Movement holds a world jamboree
every four years. The last one was held in Australia in 1988-89.

   Two men believed to be Americans were
arrested on board a yacht loaded with 1,700 pounds of cocaine worth
about $170 million, authorities said Saturday.
   Spokesmen Eduardo Santis of the Treasury Ministry and Guillermo
Moliendo of the National Police told a news conference the yacht
Lydia was seized Friday about eight miles off the port of San Jose
by a law enforcement task force that included army and navy units.
   The spokesmen identified the crewmen only as Gary Elliot Kent
Jr. and Phillip C. Carr and said authorities believed they were
Americans citizens.
   A source at the U.S. Embassy, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the embassy had sent a staff member to San Jose to
help determine their nationalities.
   The men were being held Saturday in San Jose, 67 miles south of
Guatemala City.
   Santis and Moliendo said the Lydia was on a list of boats
suspected of drug smuggling compiled by the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration.
   They said authorities believed the yacht was on its way from
Colombia to Los Angeles with the cargo of drugs.

<TEXT>
   The selection of Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski to
lead Poland's Communist Party through an era of political upheaval
culminates the remarkable comeback of a man ousted from government
in 1985.
   Rakowski, chosen Saturday by a divided Communist Party, only
joined the party's ruling Politburo on Dec. 15, 1987.
   Although he supports a radical restructuring of the economy, he
acknowledges he is now linked more with the party's conservative
elements than its reformist wing.
   Under Rakowski's leadership as premier, the government ended
gasoline rationing and legalized the black market in foreign
currencies.
   But in his nine months as prime minister, the economy has
deteriorated and Rakowski made little progress in winning the
hearts of Solidarity supporters who remember him as one of the
union's scrappiest foes.
   With inflation now in triple digits and many basic commodities
such as meat, bread and sugar in short supply, Rakowski's promotion
to the head party post in a 171-41 vote might seem peculiar.
   He became deputy prime minister Feb. 12, 1981, but his
abrasiveness made him enemies. He lost that post in November 1985
when several hard-liners were dumped from the government.
   From 1985 to 1987, he held a largely ceremonial position as
deputy speaker of the Sejm, or Parliament.
   He was one of 33 senior officials who ran unopposed for
Parliament in June but failed to capture even half the votes. One
party member in the debate Saturday said only 35 percent of Polish
people voice confidence in the government now, compared with 72
percent shortly after Rakowski took office.
   But Rakowski's calls for the party to stand firm in the face of
its difficulties apparently have appealed to party conservatives
and those in the Central Committee who feel threatened by the rise
of Solidarity's influence. The union won 260 of 261 parliament
seats it contested in June.
   Rakowski succeeds Wojciech Jaruzelski, who resigned Saturday as
he had promised to do before being elected president.
   A man of peasant origins who rose to become one of Poland's
leading journalists. From 1958 through 1982, Rakowksi was editor of
Polityka, a Communist-controlled but generally liberal weekly that
was considered even daring through the 1970s.
   The 62-year-old Rakowski was named prime minister Sept. 27 and
formed his government Oct. 14. He was rebuffed by opposition
members he sought to enlist.
   Although Rakowski in January urged legalization of Solidarity
after its seven-year ban, he did not take an active role in the
talks that followed. Solidarity was legalized again in April.
   Rakowski became unpopular with leaders of Solidarity during its
16-month legal period in 1980-81. One of his first acts as prime
minister was to announce the closing of the Lenin Shipyard in
Gdansk, Solidarity's birthplace, in a move many union members
interpreted as a personal vendetta.
   During Solidarity's early months as a legal group, Rakowski
headed the government's committee for trade unions and served as
the government's chief negotiator with Solidarity.
   He also played a major role in defending the suppression of the
union after the introduction of martial law Dec. 13, 1981.
   Born in the village of Kowalewek in northwest Poland on Dec. 1,
1926, Rakowski was a teen-age laborer during the Nazi occupation of
Poland and served in the Polish army from the time of the
liberation until 1949.
   He joined the Communist Party in 1946 and attended the Institute
of Social Sciences in Moscow.
   In a widely circulated memorandum on Poland's political
situation written before his Politburo appointment, Rakowski backed
further democratization and economic reform.
   But he also urged the party to stake out more clearly its
ideological differences with Solidarity.
   In a newspaper interview last week, Rakowski said the party
should resist attempts to divide it.
   He called on the party to become ``a pragmatic leftist party of
the 21st century.'' But he added: ``To be pragmatic does not mean
to disrespect Marxism and the historical achievements of Polish
socialists and communists.''

   A boat with 30 people bound for a
wedding sank during a rainstorm in the south, leaving 24 missing,
police said Saturday. The storm also sank two other boats, and 33
other people were reported missing.
   The boat with wedding guests capsized Friday in the Meghna River
while en route to the bride's village near Chandpur town, 40 miles
southeast of Dhaka, police said.
   Six people were rescued but the others aboard were feared
drowned, a police official said by telephone from Chandpur.
   A Bengali-language newspaper, Dainik Bangla, reported that two
fishing boats sank Friday in the Bay of Bengal off the town of
Cox's Bazaar 185 miles southeast of the capital.
   Bad weather was hampering the search for 33 missing fishermen,
the newspaper said.
   At least 50 people died Thursday when a double-deck ferry sank
after colliding with a cattle boat on the Panguchi River in
southern Bangladesh.

   Seven Pakistanis died trying to get
home in a raft after an Indian-bound ship they were riding refused
to let them off in the southern port city of Karachi, news reports
said.
   The Associated Press of Pakistan said 13 Pakistanis had boarded
the ship while they were en route home from the United Arab
Emirates in the Persian Gulf.
   They set out on a raft after the ship's owner refused to make an
unscheduled stop in Karachi, the news agency said in its report
Friday.
   The raft reportedly capsized in a storm, drowning seven of them.

   Three Romanians defected Saturday
at the world junior canoe championships, officials said.
   The two men and a woman apparently asked to remain in Canada,
said Immigration Department spokesman John Stone. Their names were
not released.
   The trio contacted city police in neighboring Halifax shortly
after 1 a.m. Saturday and were interviewed by immigration officials.
   The head of security for the championships, Bud Snow, said the
three were discovered missing late Friday.
   ``To the best of our knowledge they are desiring to stay in
Canada,'' Stone said in an interview. ``However, they are being
interviewed by senior immigration officials to determine their
intentions.''
   Stone said Halifax police contacted immigration authorities when
the Romanians showed up at the city's downtown police station.
   He did not say where the three were taken or whether they were
athletes, coaches or other participants in the world junior canoe
and kayak championships, sponsored by the International Canoe
Federation.
   The races, which conclude Sunday, include paddlers under the age
of 18 from 30 countries.
   Romania is one the world leaders in paddling, a sport dominated
by the East bloc countries. In the last junior world championships
in Yugoslavia, the Romanians placed fourth behind the Soviet Union,
Hungary and West Germany.
   The paddlers' compound at the championships is off limits to the
public. Reporters can enter only if they are escorted by race
officials.
   The event is taking place on Lake Banook, one of two dozen lakes
in this city across the harbor from Halifax.

   The United States and the Soviet Union began
plotting a superpower summit Saturday and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze said President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev
will meet ``rather soon'' if all goes well.
   The smiling Soviet official gave this optimistic assessment, and
a generally rosy view of superpower relations except for
disagreement on Afghanistan, after a three-hour and 10-minute
meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III at the Soviet
embassy here.
   Baker said he would meet Shevardnadze again Sept. 19-20,
probably in Wyoming, to make further summit preparations.
   They and ministers from 17 other countries are attending an
international conference on Cambodia's future that will open on
Sunday with the aim of arranging a cease fire to end a 10-year
civil war and put the southeast Asia country on the path to
rehabilitation.
   A Soviet foreign minister official, Vitaly Churkin, said
Shevardnadze had registered his government's ``disappointment''
with continuing U.S. weapons shipments to rebels in Afghanistan who
are trying to unseat the pro-Moscow government of President
Najibullah.
   But both Shevardnadze and Churkin stressed the positive aspects
of the meeting, which ran an hour and 10 minutes longer than
scheduled.
   They said Shevardnadze had given Baker a letter from Soviet
President Gorbachev to Bush as well as a series of memoranda to
further economic and cultural cooperation and a report on human
right s developments in the Soviet Union.
   Dominating the meeting was Gorbachev's program to restructure
the Soviet economy. In his report on perestroika, Shevardnadze
expressed sympathy for striking miners and said they were not
challenging the Soviet leader's reform program, a senior U.S.
official told reporters at a briefing.
   Baker offered technical advice to the Soviets on how to switch
from a Marxist to a market-oriented economy and reaffirmed U.S.
hopes Gorbachev would succeed, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   At a joint news conference in a sunny courtyard, Shevardnadze
said of prospects for Bush's first summit with Gorbachev: ``If we
prepare well and successfully then a summit will take place rather
soon.''
   U.S. officials said the Baker-Shevardnadze in September probably
will be at Jackson Hole, Wyo., a resort favored by judges and
wealthy businessmen as well as skiers, was the likely site.
   Baker, in response to a question, said Bush and Gorbachev
``obviously will get together at some point'' but he declined to
say whether the summit would be scheduled for this year.
   He said he had covered a wide range of subjects with
Shevardnadze, including the Cambodian conference, arms control,
Afghanistan, Central America and the Middle East.
   Shevardnadze called the session constructive and businesslike''
while Churkin told reporters it was ``a very relaxed kind of
conversation, a shirt-sleeved conversation.''
   Baker and Shevardnadze said they decided to appoint a joint
U.S.-Soviet delegation to hold periodic meetings on prospects for
an Arab-Israeli settlement.
   Dennis Ross, a close aide to Baker who heads the policy planning
office of the State Department, will head the U.S. delegation while
Gennadi Terrasov of the Soviet foreign ministry will lead his group.
   However, on Afghanistan, Churkin said Shevardnadze ``expressed
some dissatisfaction with the role the United States is playing
there.''
   Referring to continued U.S. arms shipments to the Mujahedeen,
through Pakistan, the Soviet official said ``we feel what has
happened is part of an attempt at a military solution'' to the
country's continuing conflict between the rebels and government
forces.
   On Friday, in Washington, an American official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the Soviets not only had left huge
stockpiles of weapons behind when the Red Army completed its
withdrawal on Kabul in mid-February, but were providing tanks, Scud
missiles and other arms at a rate of up to $3 billion a year, or
about double what Moscow gave the government during its nine-year
military occupation.
   Churkin said U.S.,-Soviet efforts toward a 40-nation treaty to
ban chemical weapons had ``picked up speed'' and that the U.S. and
Soviet delegations might be upgraded in order to push for agreement
soon.
   He said there was no discussion of a U.S. investigation of a
suspended State Department official, Felix S. Bloch, who is
suspected of spying for the Soviet Union.

   Israeli troops shot and wounded nine
Palestinians in clashes in the occupied territories on Saturday,
Arab hospital officials said.
   An army spokesman confirmed two of the wounded and said the
military was investigating the other reports.
   The spokesman also said a Palestinian living in the Shati
refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip died Saturday morning of
injuries suffered in a beating by fellow Arabs.
   The army identified the man as 23-year-old Walid Mohammed
Mahmoud Baroud. Arab reports said Baroud may have been beaten by
Arabs who suspected him of collaborating with Israeli authorities.
The army said police were investigating.
   Palestinians have killed 85 fellow Arabs during the 19-month-old
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule of the Gaza Strip and
West Bank.
   At least 521 Palestinians have been killed by gunfire in clashes
with army troops and Israeli settlers in the occupied lands.
Thirty-eight Israelis have also died.
   In the Tel Aviv suburb of Rishon Letzion, police arrested four
Israelis for allegedly beating a 22-year-old Gazan worker, Israel
radio reported.
   The radio said the Israelis pushed the Palestinian man into
their car, beat him and threw him on a nearby beach.
   The report did not identify the Arab or the Israelis, but said
one of the Israelis was an off-duty soldier in the paramilitary
border police, which is used to suppress Palestinian riots in the
occupied territories.
   In Jerusalem, an Arab youth selling cactus fruit was beaten by a
group of Israelis, the national Itim news agency reported. The
youth was hospitalized and one Israeli was detained by police.
   Itim said the Arab was selling fruit in the Shmuel Hanavi
neighborhood when he was attacked. The neighborhood borders Arab
east Jerusalem and has been a frequent site of attacks on
Arab-owned cars.
   In the West Bank's Tulkarem refugee camp, Samira Sayar, 19, was
shot in the left leg when troops opened fire on a group of
stone-throwers, Arab hospital officials said. In the nearby
al-Farah refugee camp, Ahmed Yusuf, 18, was shot in the left
shoulder in a clash with troops, the officials said.
   The army confirmed the incidents.
   In the Gaza Strip, troops shot and wounded seven Palestinians,
Arab hospital officials said. They said the wounded included Ayman
al-Hams, 17, who was shot in the chest and Hussein Muhsin Abdel
Nahab, 13, shot in the right arm.

   For once, a report of beach
pollution sent bathers running toward the ocean instead of away
from it.
   More than $200 in small bills embedded in sea weed washed up on
the shore Friday morning, said Tony Cavalier, chief of the North
Wildwood municipal beach patrol.
   City employees and visitors at the crowded beach scurried along
the water, poking through the seaweed in search of the money.
   ``It was like watching one of those TV shows,'' he said.
``Everyone was running through the water, rooting through the
seaweed.''
   Beach officials speculated that money dropped over a period of
time by bathers accumulated on the ocean bottom, and was kicked up
by the surf in a storm Thursday evening.
   Cavalier said municipal workers cleaning the beach with tractors
were the first to notice the money. As they jumped off their
tractors to search for the bills, curious beachgoers began to watch
them, and immediately joined in the search.

   Sunny skies didn't put a damper on ``Rain
Day'' festivities Saturday in this southwestern Pennsylvania town,
where legend says July 29 is hardly ever dry.
   ``There's not a cloud in the sky,'' said Melody Longstreth,
executive secretary of the Waynesburg Chamber of Commerce, which
helped organize the weekend celebration.
   Rain has fallen 96 out of the past 112 July 29ths in Waynesburg,
a community of about 5,000 about 35 miles south of Pittsburgh.
There have been 19 rainless Rain Days since the town began keeping
records in 1876, Ms. Longstreth said.
   The National Weather Service forecast called for sunny skies
Saturday with a high near 80 degrees.
   Not a drop had fallen by late Saturday afternoon, but Ms.
Longstreth said it wouldn't take much more than a drizzle to
satisfy the community on Rain Day.
   ``Just a few drops in the borough limits is enough,'' she said.
   The pleasant weather didn't stop residents, many of whom carried
umbrellas, from enjoying the festivities. Events included a rain
dance, games, an umbrella contest, music, a crafts sale and the
making of a banana split served in a 113-foot gutter.
   Residents say the legend began more than a century ago when a
farmer told the town's pharmacist, William Anderson, that his
records showed it almost always rained on July 29.
   As the pattern emerged over the years, some residents began
marking each Rain Day with weather bets.

   The days of Orthodox Jews having to take their
own food out to the ballgame are gone thanks to a new food stand at
Memorial Stadium that sells kosher hot dogs.
   ``I'm going to buy a kosher hot dog, and believe me, it will be
a thrill because I've never had a hot dog at an Orioles game,''
Eleanor Ashman of Cheswolde said as she lined up at the ``Premier
At The Ballpark'' stand operated by Premier Caterers Ltd., of
Pikesville. The stand at Memorial Stadium is believed to be the
first of its kind at any of the 26 major league baseball parks.
   ``This is a great boon,'' said Sandy Willner of Randallstown.
``My family has box seats at the stadium and we've always had to
bring our own food with us. But this is wonderful. It makes me feel
like I'm part of the crowd.''
   Orthodox Jews require food to be ritually fit in accordance with
Jewish law.
   Frank Storch is credited with the idea for the stand. Storch,
who owns some property the Orioles use for a ticket and souvenir
store, used his connection with the team to propose the kosher
concept.
   ``Whenever I'd take Orthodox clients to a ball game, we couldn't
get kosher food,'' said Storch, ``so I had this idea.
   ``People seem excited about it,'' he said. ``I can see it
leading to many more stands just like it at ballparks all over the
country.''
   ``I used to bring my own food to the games, mostly peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches. Not anymore. I think this will bring more
Jewish people out to the games, definitely,'' said Zev Henesch of
Greenspring.
   Even non-Jews were lining up. Herb Smith of Annapolis said, ``I
happen to like kosher hot dogs. They seem healthier. They seem to
be better for you.''

   Parisians bid au revoir to city stress Saturday and
began their annual summer vacations, battling bumper-to-bumper
traffic, delayed flights and packed trains to reach holiday havens
overflowing with millions of other travelers.
   More than 50,000 gendarmes were assigned to patrol the nation's
highways as 12 million drivers passed on their way to or from
vacations, according to the National Highway Information Center.
   The heaviest traffic, as usual, was reported on highways
connecting Paris through Lyon with sunny southern France and the
Riviera.
   South of Lyon, traffic was brought to a virtual standstill for
about 45 miles between Tain L'Hermitage and Bolene.
Bumper-to-bumper traffic also was encountered by travelers in the
southwest between Montpelier and Sete and near Bordeaux, where
traffic crawled for more than 15 miles around the city.
   Although more than 82 percent of French vacationers travel by
car, traffic jams were not restricted to the nation's highways. A
strike by air control tower technicians demanding higher pay
delayed thousands of flights Saturday.
   More than 5,000 planes were expected to take off from the
nation's runways during the weekend, about 700 more than on an
ordinary weekends. The strike delayed flights from one to three
hours, with the longest waits experienced by travelers between
Paris and London.
   The French national railway said it added 200 trains to the
schedule to handle increased holiday traffic between July 28 and
Aug. 2.
   Where is everyone going? Tourist authorities say about 50
percent are headed for the coast, where beaches already are lined
with hundreds of thousands of baking bodies. Thirty percent are
going to the country, 16 percent to the mountains and the rest have
opted to spend their free time outside of France.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first organized opposition in the Soviet
parliament in nearly 70 years was formed Saturday by 368
legislators who gathered to plan their strategy for greater
political and economic reforms.
   Even the official news agency Tass said the historic event could
be described as ``the birth of the Soviet opposition.''
   Tass called the organization ``left-radical.''
   In another development, Latvia joined the two other Baltic
republics, Lithuania and Estonia, in declaring itself ``sovereign''
with the right to veto Soviet laws on its territory, Tass reported.
   Among the members of the opposition group are human rights
activist Andrei Sakharov; maverick Communist Boris Yeltsin; Vitaly
Korotich, editor of the reform magazine Ogonyoky; and economist
Gavriil Popov. It will operate under the title Inter-Regional
Deputies' Group.
   Elena Kotova, who participated in the meeting but is not a
legislator, said, ``Our desired aim is to have the equivalent of a
Western party.''
   The Left Socialist Revolutionaries was the last opposition party
to survive the Bolshevik purges following the 1917 revolution. It
was suppressed in 1922.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has ordered many reforms since
coming to power in 1985 but has strongly opposed allowing an
alternative party to the Communists.
   Leaders of the new organization said enough contributions have
been received to begin publishing a newspaper.
   Mikhail Bocharov, a deputy from suburban Moscow, said the
newspaper The People's Deputy will start with a circulation of
300,000 and sell for about 80 cents a copy.
   That is more than 18 times the cost of the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda but considerably less than a Soviet fashion
magazine.
   Historian Yuri Afanasiev, a deputy from Moscow, said the group
will meet Sunday and hopes to reach agreement on a platform.
   Tass predicted Yeltsin would be elected leader but Afanasiev
indicated the group is leaning toward a governing council with
several deputies.
   The organization is still a small minority in the 2,250-seat
Congress of People's Deputies, the Soviet parliament. Nikolai
Medvedev, a deputy from Lithuania, said most of his colleagues from
the three Baltic republics had left Moscow for the weekend but when
they returned they could add up to 140 members to the group.
   It was not clear how many of the opposition deputies are also
members of the smaller legislative branch of the Congress called
the Supreme Soviet.
   The group could have its most immediate effect on the political
process by proposing laws. The Supreme Soviet gained that power
this spring but so far it has considered only proposals put forth
by the Kremlin leadership.
   Moscow deputy Sergei Stankevich, writing in the first issue of
The People's Deputy, said that fears instilled by years of
political tyranny made people shy away from an open opposition.
   Popov opened Saturday's meeting in the crowded auditorium of the
Soviet Filmmakers' Union with a call to bring reform through legal
changes instead of what he called the government's ``spontaneous
approach'' to crises.
   Tass said the group has a place in the reform process but
reported some legislators ``have expressed the fear that in this
complex time for the country, when unity of action is required,
this `left-radical group' might turn into some kind of opposition.''
   Organizers of the group said it has been tolerated by the
government bureaucracy and was not allowed to meet in the Kremlin.
   Among issues discussed Saturday were proposals that would give
enterprises more independence and allow Soviets living abroad who
were stripped of their citizenship to reclaim it.
   Tass said the Latvian parliament's declaration of sovereignty
means that ``laws of the U.S.S.R. will go into effect on the
territory of Latvia only after their ratification by the highest
organ of government in the republic.''
   When Estonia declared its sovereignty last November, the Kremlin
called the action unconstitutional.
   On Thursday, however, the Supreme Soviet gave preliminary
approval to resolutions that would give Latvia, Estonia and
Lithuania economic independence by Jan. 1.
   Estonia has tried to assert independence on issues of public
concern, such as environmental protection. Lithuania followed
Estonia's example this summer after its Sajudis reform group won a
majority of the republic's seats in the Soviet Union's first
contested elections for parliament.

   Republicans held a grand old party
Saturday to welcome their latest convert, Rep. Tommy Robinson, who
defected from the Democratic ranks earlier this week.
   ``I know how hard it is to be a Southern conservative Democrat.
My conscience is now clear,'' Robinson told about 150 cheering
Republicans. ``I have now made my decision and it is the right one
for the people of this state.''
   President Bush announced the three-term Arkansas congressman's
party change Friday. Robinson was the third Democrat in three days
to make the switch.
   Also changing parties were retiring District of Columbia Police
Chief Maurice Turner _ widely considered a mayoral prospect for the
capital _ and Louisiana Secretary of State Fox McKeithen.
   ``That party has shut out Southern Democrats and that party has
lost Tommy Robinson,'' he said. ``I can no longer be a member of
that party.''
   Republican leaders raved about their newest congressman.
   Former Lt. Gov. Maurice ``Footsie'' Britt called it the ``first
crack in the dam'' of recruiting from the Democratic ranks.
   ``He really is a phenomenon,'' said party activist Emaline
Holleman of Wynne. ``I think Tommy Robinson will bring us votes,''
she said.
   Robinson, 47, and his wife, Carolyn, were cheered by an audience
that waved small U.S. flags and swayed to a Dixieland band.
   Meanwhile, Arkansas Democratic Party Chairman James ``Skip''
Rutherford said Saturday that he has already received several calls
from people who are interested in running against Robinson.
   ``People are looking more seriously now,'' Rutherford said.
``There is a lot of interest in the Second District seat.''
   Robinson's move leaves the House with 256 Democrats, 176
Republicans, and three vacancies.
   Robinson said he will meet with Republican House leaders on
Monday to discuss new committee assignments. As a Democrat, he had
served on the House Armed Services Committee, but the switch means
he will lose his old seat.
   The Robinsons were joined on a stage decorated with red, white
and blue balloons by U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who praised
Robinson's work on a drug interdiction bill they co-sponsored.
Hunter said he admired Robinson for defying the House Democratic
leadership.

   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57 degrees at Ironwood,
Mich., to 101 degrees at Needles and Palm Springs, Calif.
   The forecast for Sunday called for showers and thunderstorms
scattered from the lower Great Lakes through the lower Ohio and
Tennessee valleys, the middle and lower Mississippi Valley and into
the central and eastern Gulf Coast region with showers most
numerous across parts of Illinois and Indiana. Late afternoon
showers and thunderstorms were expected over parts of western
Montana, north central Arizona and the southern high Plains.
   High temperatures were forecast for the 80s or 90s across much
of the nation Sunday. Highs in the 70s were expected along the
central and northern Pacific Coast and from the Great Lakes into
New England. Highs between 100 and 105 degrees were expected from
central Texas into the middle Rio Grande Valley and up to 110
degrees across the desert Southwest.

<HEAD>Government Veers Away from Marxism with New Economic Policies.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Mario Machungo outlined
the ruling party's new political and economic policies Saturday and
said an independent economy is necessary to build socialism.
   The outline indicated that the party _ the Front for the
Liberation of Mozambique, or Frelimo _ is moving away from Marxism
and central planning.
   Frelimo has governed Mozambique under a one-party,
Marxist-Leninist policy since gaining power after the country
gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   But its policy document, presented last week to Frelimo's first
national congress since 1983, dropped all references to Marxism.
   The document described the party as socialist. It also said
Frelimo is open to all Mozambicans and is not just a worker-peasant
alliance.
   The party congress has already been presented with its Central
Committee's recommendations to open ranks to businessmen, property
owners, shopkeepers and religious believers.
   The congress convened July 24 and is to close Monday.
   During Saturday's session Machungo said, ``The process of
building socialism requires the creation of an independent and
advanced economy.''
   He said the effort also would require ``the active participation
of various property regimes _ state-owned, cooperative and peasant
family property, and private or joint-venture forms of property.''
   Several years ago the government began opening the economy,
encouraging private enterprise and foreign investments mainly to
meet requirements for loans from the International Monetary Fund
and World Bank.
   About half of Mozambique's 14 million people are wholly or
partly dependent on donated food and 1.6 million are refugees from
the 12-year-old civil war that has left hundreds of thousands dead.
   Machungo said the major change from the social and economic
directives of 1983 ``is that today Frelimo does not attempt to
establish target figures for every sector of the economy. Instead
the directives set out basic policy goals.''
   He said the new directives ``lay heavy stress on peasant family
agriculture rather than on state farms,'' but that state farms
still have an important role in producing exports.
   Machungo said the directives also call for ``increased labor
productivity and for the implementation of the principle of paying
more to those who work more, carry out their duties better and
attain the best indexes of efficiency.''
   The Central Committee said it would allow private schools,
outlawed in 1975, to be re-established because the government was
unable to provide education for all of the country's children. It
said rebels have destroyed or forced the closure of 2,699 primary
schools in rural areas.

   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani was
elected president by a landslide majority, according to official
returns announced Saturday.
   Government-run Tehran radio reported Rafsanjani won 13,468,355
out of 14,192,802 votes cast Friday in 192 out of 198 regions, or
about 95 percent.
   It also said 97 percent of the voters approved constitutional
amendments boosting the president's executive power.
   Tehran radio said Rafsanjani's only opponent, Parliament deputy
Abass Sheibani from the token opposition party, the Freedom
Movement, won 483,050 votes, or about 3 percent.
   Sheibani conceded defeat in a letter to Rafsanjani read over the
radio and was quoted as saying: ``I congratulate you on your
election, which was achieved with a definite vote.''
   Iran's official media did not say how many of the country's 25
million voters age 16 or older turned out to vote, or when full
results would be reported. About 17 million people voted in last
year's parliamentary elections.
   Iran's main opposition group, the Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's
Warriors, said in a statement released at its headquarters in
Baghdad, Iraq, that turnout was low.
   Rafsanjani, a so-called pragmatist in Iran's religious
hierarchy, will be the Islamic Republic's fourth president. He will
succeed Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who was chosen supreme leader after
the death June 3 of Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini.
   Rafsanjani is expected to move toward restoring links with the
West and liberalizing Iran's economy to help the country's
reconstruction after the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, which was
suspended by a cease-fire last August.
   The constitutional amendments approved in the election do away
with the post of prime minister and put the president in charge of
the government, answerable only to the 270-seat Majlis, or
parliament.
   The changes are designed to eliminate competing power centers
that have for years paralyzed the government and blocked economic
reforms.

   Eleven prisoners were executed in six states
last year, less than half the number of inmates put to death the
previous year, the Justice Department said Saturday.
   The executions in 1988 brought to 104 the total number of
inmates put to death since 1976, when the Supreme Court reinstated
capital punishment.
   The department, in a study by its Bureau of Justice Statistics,
said those put to death during 1988 had spent an average of six
years and eight months awaiting execution for their crimes.
   Louisiana and Texas each executed three inmates last year, with
two in Florida and one each in Georgia, Utah and Virginia. Six
white males and five black males were executed last year.
   During 1988, state courts sent 296 defendants to death rows in
state prisons following their conviction and sentencing for murder,
the report said.
   The death sentences of 116 inmates already on death row were
vacated or commuted last year, the study said.
   At year's end, 2,124 prisoners were under death sentences in 34
of the 37 states that authorize capital punishment. There were no
death-row prisoners in the other three states, according to the
study.
   Of the nation's death-row inmates last year, 1,238 _ or 58.3
percent _ were white and 853 _ 40.2 percent _ were black. The study
said 21 were American Indians and 12 were Asian.
   This group included 23 women.
   State prisons in Southern states held 59 percent of the nation's
death-row inmates last year, while 19 percent were in prisons in
Western states. Sixteen percent were on death rows in state prisons
in the Midwest and almost 6 percent were awaiting execution in the
Northeast.
   The study said that 193 of those sentenced to die last year were
white males while 89 were black males, four were male American
Indians and 5 were male Asians. The group included three while
women and two black women.
   Last year, Florida had the most new prisoners on death row _ 42
_ followed by Texas, where 34 defendants were ordered sent to
prison to be executed. California had 32 new prisoners sent to
death row last year, the report said.

   Wildfires forced 2,500 people from their homes the Sierra Nevada
foothills of California Saturday, and in Idaho, the National Guard
was alerted to prepare to join the battle against dozens of timber
blazes.
   In all, about 37,000 acres of brush, grass and timber were
scorched by a flurry of wildfires being battled by 7,200
firefighters in three Western states.
   In California, about 2,500 people, including 150 nursing home
patients, were kept from their homes Saturday by a wildfire that
consumed 6,000 acres of grass and brush above Fresno on the edge of
the Sierra National Forest. A house, two mobile homes, a barn and
one unidentified structure were destroyed Friday.
   Efforts of 1,500 firefighters to contain the blaze were hampered
by temperatures expected to top 100 degrees and by rising wind that
threatened to spread the flames, said Lt. Bob McDonald of the
Fresno County Sheriff's Department. The fire was started Friday by
man or machinery, he said.
   ``At night we have down-canyon winds, and in daylight up-canyon
winds, so a fire can start turning up on you,'' said Larry Blow, a
California Department of Forestry spokesman.
   A line of bare earth was cut around 40 percent of the fire by
midday Saturday, and more than a dozen aircraft dumped water and
fire-retardant chemicals on the blaze.
   People were evacuated from the New Auberry, Meadow Lakes, Alder
Springs, Bald Mountain and Jose Basin, said California Department
of Forestry spokesman Dave Akers.
   Leeota Ramsey of Meadow Lakes wasn't supposed to drive since she
gave birth by Cesarean section 10 days before the fire, but she had
to drive the 40 miles downhill with her two small children and her
mother.
   ``I'm hurting a little bit and feeling awfully hungry,'' Ramsey
said. ``We didn't get a chance to eat dinner.''
   In Idaho, dozens of small blazes touched off by lightning
earlier in the week were joining into huge forest fires Saturday.
   More than 3,000 firefighters joined the battle, and Gov. Cecil
Andrus declared an emergency, putting the National Guard on notice
that troops could be called in to help.
   Top priority was given to the 1,800-acre Fleming Creek blaze
that was threatening commercial stands of timber and spewing smoke
visible 50 miles to the south in Boise.
   The Boise Interagency Fire Center marked a new record late last
week on the amount of retardant dropped in Idaho by planes, said
center spokesman Jerry Rohnert. The converted World War II bombers
dumped 125,200 gallons in about 43 hours.
   In the Boise National Forest, three separate groups of fires
were burning, including one east of Cascade that posed an erosion
threat to salmon spawning beds on the South Fork of the Salmon
River. Fires also were burning in the Payette National Forest, the
Nez Perce National Forest and the Challis National Forest, and on
federal land in southwestern Idaho.
   In eastern Oregon, five forest fires, most of them set by
lightning earlier in the week, raged out of control Saturday,
burning about 5,500 acres. About 1,500 firefighters were on the
lines.
   The biggest _ a cluster of four blazes being fought as one _
burned through 2,500 acres of potentially valuable timber east of
the town of John Day. Warm temperaturs and winds up to 35 mph
hampered the firefighting effort, said U.S. Forest Service
spokesman Tim Kimble.
   ``We're just having to back off,'' Kimble said.
   Other Oregon fires were on Dooley Mountain south of Baker, at
Koontz creek south of Baker, near the Anthony Lakes ski area
northwest of Baker and one near the boundary of the Eagle Cap
Wilderness south of Enterprise.
   In California, in addition to the blaze near Fresno, a fire that
threatened homes in the rural central California community of
Atascadero was 80 percent contained Saturday after burning 10,500
acres of brush.
   The blaze, started Thursday by a spark from an off-road
motorcycle, destroyed 15 to 20 outbuildings, including barns and
garages, as well as two cars and a truck, said Department of
Forestry spokesman Ron Alsop.
   In the Los Angeles suburb of Walnut, a brush fire that forced
evacuation of 800 students from California State Polytechnic
Institute at Pomona was contained Friday night by about 200
firefighters, said Rafael Ortiz of the Los Angeles County Fire
Department. One firefighter suffered second-degree burns battling
the blaze, he said.

   The Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)
Saturday endorsed a working partnership with the United Church of
Christ, despite criticism from some members that the United Church
is too liberal.
   Delegates to the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) General
Assembly approved a resolution for full communion between the two
churches, including mutual recognition of members and clergy.
   The resolution means the churches will recognize each other's
members as believers in a single common faith, said Paul Crow Jr.,
the president of the council on Christian unity.
   He said they will also work to coordinate the two churches'
social services and community functions.
   About 6,000 delegates attended the first day of business of the
five-day Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) General Assembly,
officials said.
   The United Church of Christ passed a similar resolution at its
national convention in Fort Worth, Texas, a month ago.
   ``This is not a merger. It's not a uniting of the churches'
structure,'' Crow said. ``This is setting up a common
acknowledgement of each other.''
   The move means the two congregations can attend the same worship
services, but Crow says local churches will maintain their own
identities.
   The Disciples of Christ and the United Church of Christ base
their faith on the same Christian doctrine, Crow said. The two
organizations already work together in much of their missionary
endeavors, but they differ in some worship practices and church
policies, he said.
   One of those policies is a United Church of Christ clause that
forbids church boards from considering sexual orientation of its
ministers. That means the church officially allows homosexuals to
become ministers and forbids member churches from discriminating
against them.
   ``In putting our stamp of approval on this, we are putting our
stamp of approval on homosexuality,'' said Bethel Nason of Topeka,
Kan. Her statements against the resolution brought a round of
applause from delegates.
   The resolution does not mention the issue of homosexuality.
   Disciples of Christ delegate Mike Wolfe of Spearman, Texas,
charged the United Church of Christ is ``far to the left, both
political and ecumenically.''
   But Crow said the differences in social beliefs are as common
within the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) as they are
between the two denominations.
   ``The Christian Church allows for unity in diversity but that
diversity need not divide us,'' he said.
   Disciples President John O. Humbert also unveiled a model for a
proposed $15 million building in downtown Indianapolis that will
house the Church's international offices. He said construction is
expected to be completed by 1992.
   The Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) was formed in 1832 as
part of an early frontier movement to unify Christians. The United
Church of Christ was formed 32 years ago from other Christian
sects. Both organizations allow for varied opinions and stress
freedom of interpretaton.

<TEXT>
   The Secretary of the Navy on Saturday
denied that Greenpeace protesters forced the Navy to scrap a
Trident 2 missile launch off Cape Canaveral.
   Instead, foreign flag ships prompted officials to call off
Friday's scheduled test, said Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett.
   The Navy canceled the Trident 2 test several hours after four
Greenpeace U.S.A. vessels penetrated the safety zone and chased a
submarine involved in the test in the Atlantic about 50 miles off
the cape.
   A statement issued by the Navy said the launch was postponed
``because of intentional interference from foreign flag ships in a
designated hazardous operational area.'' Some Greenpeace vessels
fly foreign flags.
   ``We did not disrupt the proposed shot yesterday because of the
Greenpeace activity,'' Garrett said. ``There were foreign flag
vessels in the area. It's a normal precaution that we take, and if
we have to delay, it's still not going to disrupt the schedule.''
   Greenpeace spokeswoman Shannon Fagan said two large Greenpeace
ships and two motorized rafts carrying anti-nuclear activists
shadowed the launch submarine Tennessee for hours in international
waters.
   Safety regulations require that a countdown be stopped if
non-essential boats come within about three miles of the submarine.
One raft was photographed beside the submarine.
   The planned launch was to be the second underwater test firing
of the Trident 2, the Navy's newest, most powerful weapon.
   The first test March 21 ended in an explosion when the $23.7
million missile pinwheeled out of control four seconds after it was
launched from the Tennessee. Nineteen land launches, 15 of them
successful, preceded the sea trials.

   Hundreds of heads huddled close to the glossy
photographs Saturday, and fingers furtively pointed out familiar
faces and places.
   This was no ordinary photography exhibit: It was a record,
albeit partial, of the biggest protests in Communist China, and
many of the viewers took part.
   ``Look, I know him,'' one young girl whispered to a friend as
they studied a photograph of student leaders addressing a crowd
during the pro-democracy movement that is now officially condemned
as an anti-socialist rebellion.
   The girl looked quickly around to see if anyone heard. But no
one seemed to be paying attention; everyone had their own
associations connected with the seven weeks of marches and sit-ins
that ended June 3-4 when the army attacked. Hundreds and possibly
thousands of people died.
   The three-room exhibit at the China Art Museum that opened
Friday afternoon was the latest in a series of official efforts to
convince the public that the army acted correctly.
   Government books and television programs have given the official
version of the events. The Military Museum of the Chinese People's
Revolution has put tanks burned by protesters on display in its
front courtyard, along with several burned public buses used as
street barricades against the army's advance.
   The dramatic exhibit included pictures of soldiers recapturing
Tiananmen Square, where the students made their headquarters during
the protests.
   Many pictures were shown for the first time in public. No photo
credits were given, but they clearly were the work of military or
police photographers with special access.
   There were huge aerial shots of Beijing streets filled with
banner-waving marchers, of the student tent city in Tiananmen
Square, of lone soldiers guarding the square at sunrise. There were
soldiers with cracked skulls and bloodied clothing, and soldiers'
bodies on fire and the charred remains.
   The exhibit did not contain any pictures of civilians wounded or
killed. Western journalists shot dozens of pictures of students
carrying their wounded on their backs or on pedicabs.
   The official purpose of the display may have been education, but
many viewers went to remember and search for clues to really
happened in Tiananmen Square.
   ``That's Chai Ling, that's Guo Haifeng, there's Ma Shaofang,'' a
well-groomed woman said to a friend, referring to student leaders
who are now fugitives or under arrest. Only Ma was identified in
the picture.
   ``Look at how the soldiers came in here,'' a youth said, placing
his finger on a mass of green-uniformed figures trying to push its
way through a civilian crowd. ``They couldn't go forward or back,
that's when they used the tear gas.''
   Some viewers broke into smiles or laughs upon seeing again the
marchers' banners: ``Step down, Li Peng. Retire, Deng Xiaoping.''
Hoisting such slogans now against the premier and senior leader
would mean certain arrest.
   One young man pressed his face within inches of a dark,
smoke-hazed view of soldiers moving into Tiananmen, trying in vain
to make out whether students remained on the vast expanse.
   Many Chinese now discount rumors, circulated immediately after
the army attack, of thousands of deaths in the square and of the
army burning bodies, but few believe the government account that
all the students left the square first and that no one was killed
there.
   The government has acknowledged that more than 200 civilians
died, including some innocent bystanders. Chinese witnesses and
Western intelligence reports say that up to 3,000 people may have
been killed.

   The country's new military ruler further
consolidated power Saturday by decreeing broad judicial powers for
himself.
   The order gives Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir power to appoint
the chief justice and senior judges. He can also commute death
sentences and issue reprieves without explanation.
   The decree, which el-Bashir signed as head of the ruling
15-officer junta, named him ``supreme constitutional authority in
the country.''
   Shortly after Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi's civilian
government was overthrown in a bloodless coup on June 30, el-Bashir
made himself prime minister, minister of defense and military
commander-in-chief of this East African nation.
   He dissolved Sudan's 36 political parties and banned all
newspapers and magazines.
   In the past, Sudan's chief justice was elected by other judges.
Senior judges were nominated by the chief justice and appointed by
a five-member State Council.
   El-Bashir has accused officials of the former government and
many political party members of corruption. He has said those
accused of wrongdoing will stand trial. El-Mahdi has been
imprisoned with about 40 former senior political figures.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegates attending the First Congress of Chinese
Students in the United States on Saturday created a fledgling
national student union aimed at pressuring China for democratic
reforms.
   After lengthy debate and overnight revisions, delegates ratified
a constitution creating the All-America Chinese Student Union.
   ``It's not perfect enough, but it's really a very good start,''
said Ding Jain, chairman of the congress.
   Creation of the union was the main focus of the three-day
congress, which attracted Chinese students from across the country,
a spokesman for the congress said.
   The union will coordinate efforts to bring pressure on China to
adopt pro-democratic reforms, said Pei Minxin, 31, a graduate
student from Harvard University and spokesman for the congress.
   After ratifying the constitution, the congress voted on a
variety of proposed projects for the union to undertake. The
projects include lobbying governments for economic sanctions
against China, organizing boycotts against China and assuming joint
management with the Chinese Journalist Association of the weekly
newspaper Press Freedom Herald. The paper was founded by a group of
journalists in the United States on June 9, 1989.
   Many of the proposals have been tried by individual student
organizations before, Pei said, ``but now, with the establishment
of this union, there is a legitimacy, a broad-based legitimacy to
these efforts ... and conceivably we will attract more support from
Chinese students across America.''
   The union's creation was brought about by the June 3-4 army
attack in Beijing in which hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators
were killed in Tiananmen Square, Pei said.
   Chinese students in the United States believed there had to be
other ways to change the government in their native country, Pei
said.
   ``Why not choose another less costly message, such as lobbying
for these individual measures?'' Pei said.
   ``Conceivably Chinese students will work through this
organization to voice their pro-democratic ideas and opinions and
also voice their protests against the human rights violations by
the Chinese government,'' he said.

   President Wojciech Jaruzelski resigned
Saturday as Communist Party chief and was replaced by the outgoing
prime minister, Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, who has become a champion
of conservative elements in the party.
   In another apparent victory for party conservatives, two
hard-liners were named to the ruling Politburo in a shakeup that
came on the last day of a Communist Party plenum.
   Four of the 18 Politburo members and five of the nine party
secretaries _ most reformers or linked to Jaruzelski _ were
dropped. Party spokesman Janusz Bisztyga called the move a drive
for ``new faces.''
   In addition to quitting as party chief, Jaruzelski also resigned
from the Politburo and the policy-setting Central Committee in what
appeared to be an effort to show total commitment to the presidency.
   Jaruzelski had promised to resign as party chief, a post he held
since 1981, if he became president. He was elected July 19 to the
position, created as part of reforms agreed to in talks this year
between Communist authorities and the Solidarity trade union
movement.
   As president, Jaruzelski has control of the military and foreign
policy matters and will choose a prime minister to head the
government.
   The official news agency PAP said the gathering of the party
Central Committee and party deputies of parliament elected Rakowski
171 to 41 to replace Jaruzelski. Bisztyga said Rakowski was the
only candidate.
   The selection of the 62-year-old Rakowski culminated a
remarkable political rise by the politician, who joined the
Politburo only in December 1987 after having been dropped from the
government in 1985, along with several other hard-liners.
   ``The party is in a difficult situation, but I believe I have
support from thousands of party members,'' Rakowski told state
television later. ``I am aware of the importance of the job, and I
believe that we can find a way out of this difficult situation.''
   Rakowski has been sharply criticized for the way he handled the
economy during his nine months as prime minister.
   But despite triple-digit inflation, food shortages and his plan
to rise food prices Aug. 1, Rakowski was believed to have gathered
support from hard-liners and party members fearful of the growing
influence of Solidarity.
   He is disliked by Solidarity for his antagonism toward the union
during the martial-law crackdown of 1981 and for his decision last
year to close the Lenin Shipyard, where Solidarity was founded nine
years ago.
   He was one of 33 senior officials who ran unopposed for
Parliament in June elections but failed to capture even half the
votes. He handed in his government's resignation last month after
the new parliament was seated.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev immediately sent
congratulations to Rakowski, saying cooperation between the Soviet
and Polish parties will continue ``in spirit of party friendship
and mutual understanding,'' PAP said.
   The Central Committee conferred for several hours on who would
be selected prime minister but made no announcement before
adjourning late in the evening.
   Jaruzelski was to present his choice for prime minister to the
parliament Monday for approval.
   Potential candidates appeared to be Politburo member Wladyslaw
Baka, Deputy Prime Minister Ireneusz Sekula, United Peasant Party
leader Roman Malinowski and Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak.
   Baka quit Friday as party secretary in charge of the economy
after harshly criticizing Rakowski's performance as prime minister.
His resignation was accepted during Saturday's session.
   It was unclear if he resigned to become prime minister or if he
was leaving to protest the economic record of the Rakowski
government.
   According to PAP, the plenum also adopted a resolution declaring
the party's willingness to work with Solidarity and with the 260
Solidarity lawmakers chosen in the June election.
   Solidarity now controls 99 of 100 seats in the new freely
elected Senate and 161 of the 460 seats in the Sejm, or parliament.
   The resolution reaffirmed the party's January decision to
legalize Solidarity and ``defined conditions'' needed to improve
the economy, PAP said, without elaborating.
   Besides Jaruzelski, the Central committee accepted Politburo
resignations from Jozef Czyrek, Kazimierz Barcikowski, Stanislaw
Ciosek and Alfred Miodowicz. Miodowicz said he resigned because of
wishes of members of the official trade union alliance OPZZ, which
he heads.
   They were replaced by Warsaw party chief Janusz Kubasiewicz and
Katowice party chief Manfred Gorywoda, both hard-liners, and by
Leszek Miller, a party secretary who has been active in promoting
the party to young people.
   Dropped as party secretaries were Czyrek, Ciosek, Baka, Marian
Orzechowski and Zygmunt Czarzasty. Baka and Orzechowski remain
members of the Politburo. Czarzasty had been brought in as a party
secretary by Jaruzelski as part of a new generation of reformers
only seven months ago.
   With the exception of Miodowicz, those dropped were reformers or
closely linked to Jaruzelski.
   All of the departing officials said they resigned, but it was
not clear if their resignations all were voluntary. PAP said only
that the resignations were accepted.

<TEXT>
   American evangelist Billy Graham, on
his fourth visit to Hungary, preached to an estimated 90,000 people
Saturday in a Budapest soccer stadium.
   The stadium seats 70,000, so many people stood on the field as
Graham, speaking from a platform, told the crowd, ``God knows
everything'' and ``salvation is through Christ.'' Organizers said
it was the largest crowd ever gathered in the stadium.
   The predominantly young audience frequently cheered Graham. He
spoke in English and the sermon was translated into Hungarian.
   ``I see we have a capacity crowd here. This is an indication of
the spiritual yearning and hunger,'' Graham said.
   He did not make any political comments but when he arrived
Tusday he said Hungary's religious life was ``at a great historical
turning point.''
   ``I believe our present visit is another sign of this new spirit
of openness and change,'' he said.
   The state news agency MTI published a brief report on Graham's
service and said among those attending the event were Matyas
Szueros, the speaker of Parliament, several Hungarian church
leaders and Mark Palmer, the U.S. ambassador to Hungary.
   On Friday, the Communist Party announced major policy changes
regarding religion.
   The party's Central Committee said the party will not require
that members be atheists and will not interfere in church affairs.
   ``The Hungarian Socialist Workers Party is not an atheist party
but a party committed to the cause of social progress,'' Central
Committee member Janos Berecz said after the meeting in Budapest.
   He told a news conference the party will ensure separation of
church and state.
   There are no official statistics on church membership in
Hungary, but 70 percent of Hungarian Christians are believed to be
Roman Catholics.
   In the past, some party members were known to be Catholics but
they rarely professed their beliefs in public.

   An Eastern Airlines DC-9 lost its fiberglass tail
cone while landing at O'Hare International Airport on Saturday but
taxied to the gate without incident, an airline spokeswoman said.
   Flight 236 from Atlanta to Chicago landed at 10:10 a.m.,

Bobbi Giordano.
   ``It was three-quarters of the way down the runway, decelerating
in reverse thrust and the tail cone fell off,'' she said. ``The
passengers deplaned normally. While it's not a common occurrence,
it does happen in the airline industry.''
   The tail cone is a fiberglass molding that makes the plane
aerodynamic.
   ``It's no big deal,'' said a Federal Aviation Administration

<HEAD>Alaska Oil Spill Could Degrade in Five Years, Experts Say</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Exxon Valdez</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tidal action, erosion and oil-eating microbes
could clean most of the oil from Alaska's spill-tainted shores
within five years and the beaches could be normal again in 10
years, researchers said Saturday.
   Speakers at a conference on the nation's largest oil spill said
the natural combination could clean up the spill without human
efforts.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24 and spilled 10.92
million gallons of crude in Prince William Sound. The researchers
based their conclusions on studies of previous oil spills with
similar characteristics, especially the Amoco Cadiz spill off the
coast of France in 1976.
   The researchers' findings contradicted statements by Coast Guard
Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, the on-site coordinator of cleanup
efforts. Robbins said Friday that the beaches soiled by the spill
``are never going to be clean.''
   ``I would be very surprised to see a significant amount of oil
(in Prince William Sound) in five years,'' said John H.
Vandermeulen, a researcher at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography
at Halifax, Nova Scotia.
   He and Ronald Atlas, a microbiologist at the University of
Louisville, said studies of the Cadiz incident and other major
spills showed that the ecology of the damaged areas appeared to
have returned to normal within about 10 years.
   The researchers used comparisons of fouled areas with similar
but unspoiled environments to determine what constituted ``normal.''
   ``Most environments I have seen have had recovery to some level
of normalcy within five to 10 years,'' Vandermeulen said. ``Even
heavily oiled marshes have recovered in 11 years.''
   The speed of natural cleanup by microbes is slowed by Alaska's
cold temperatures, he said, but the breakdown of crude oil and
weathering of shores by wind and erosion continues.
   Atlas said oil-eating microbes exist in the area of the Alaska
spill, in small numbers. The Environmental Protection Agency, which
has a research station in Valdez, has found that their numbers have
increased since the spill, he said.
   Atlas also said general degradation of the Cadiz spill appeared
to take around 10 years, even if nothing else was done.
   ``That rate is perhaps reasonable here,'' he said.
   Oil degradation can be sped up with the use of fertilizers
containing nitrogen and phosphorus, a proposal that is being
considered.
   Shore organisms that were destroyed by the spill would also come
back fairly quickly, Vandermeusen said.
   ``Even if we wipe out every one, there are larval ones off shore
waiting to settle,'' he said.
   The experts spoke before an estimated 150 researchers attending
a three-day conference on the effects of the oil spill on people,
animals and the environment.
   The conference, which ends Sunday, is sponsored by the National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the National Institute
for Occupational Safety &amp; Health and the Environmental Protection
Agency, among others.

<HEAD>Chinese Army Officer and Wife Defect to South Korea</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chinese army officer and his wife
defected to South Korea Saturday through the demilitarized zone
separating South Korea and communist North Korea, the Defense
Ministry reported.
   A government intelligence source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, identified the officer as Maj. Zuo Xiukai, 40, a member
of the Chinese delegation to the Korean Military Armistice
Commission. The commission supervises the 1953 truce agreement that
ended the Korean War.
   The source said Zuo and his wife requested that they be allowed
to go to a third country. He said he did not know what country the
couple preferred but speculated it would be either Taiwan or the
United States.
   ``Obviously they do not want to settle down here,'' he said.
   The Seoul newspaper Hankook Ilbo quoted an unidentifed
govenrment source as saying the couple probably defected because of
their disapproval of the violent military crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators last month in Beijing.
   The Defense Ministry reported they crossed the border into South
Korea from the truce village of Panmunjom inside the demilitarized
zone shortly after 11 a.m.
   It said the two were under the protective custody of the
American-led U.N. Command.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Yoon Chang-ro said command
officials were questioning the officer and his wife and planned to
transfer them to South Korean authorities.
   The U.N. Command includes representatives of the United States
and 15 other nations that helped South Korea after North Korea
invaded in 1950. The command has headquarters in the border village
of Panmunjom, 35 miles north of Seoul.
   The government intelligence source said Zuo was the
fourth-ranking officer in the 12-member Chinese delegation to the
Armistice Commission, also based in Panmunjom.
   Seoul-based foreign journalists who became acquainted with Zuo
at Panmunjom said he speaks English and had served in the Chinese
embassies in India and Britain before being assigned to Panmunjom
two years ago.
   Assistant Foreign Minister Lee Jung-bin and other government
officials met Saturday to discuss the case.
   The Taiwanese Embassy in Seoul said it was in contact with South
Korean authorities. Some Chinese air force pilots who in past years
defected and landed their jet fighters in South Korea were allowed
to go to Taiwan, which is governed by the anti-communist
Nationalist Chinese.
   China, which sent thousands of troops into Korea to help North
Korea during the Korean War, was a signatory to the 1953 cease-fire
that halted the conflict.
   Saturday's defection was believed to be the first by Chinese
through Panmunjom.
   In 1981 a Czechoslovak enlisted soldier defected to South Korea
through the border village and three years later a Soviet student
crossed the border and sought asylum.
   Both eventually were allowed to go to the United States after
being processed by a U.N. refugee commission in Rome.

   How do you make yourself at home in prison?
Seventeen drug lords and their lieutenants used mahogany furniture,
satin pillows, ornamental plants, porcelain figurines and a private
sauna, the attorney general's office says.
   One even set up a cottage industry in his suite of cells in
Ciudad Juarez, employing other inmates to make clothing for export,
the office said.
   Photographs of Gilberto Ontiveros Lucero's ``bedroom'' in Mexico
City newspapers Saturday showed a double bed with a thick cover and
piles of pillows, elaborate mirrors and a wall-to-wall and
floor-to-ceiling curtain.
   An investigation into prison corruption began with the
disclosure earlier this month that two of Mexico's biggest drug
traffickers were living in opulent quarters in a Mexico City prison.
   While Ontiveros was branching out into haberdashery, other drug
lords continued to run their narcotics businesses, using cellular
telephones to call the United States and Colombia, the attorney
general's office said.
   A total of 14 cellular telephones have been confiscated, the
office said Friday when it released an inventory.
   The inventory listed microwave ovens, video cassette players,
plants, refrigerators, an exercise bicycle, sauna baths, porcelain
figurines, dining room furniture, bedroom furniture, office
furniture and a jewel-encrusted Rolex watch.
   Tear gas, pistols, knives, scanners to monitor police radio
traffic, cocaine and marijuana also were found, the statement said.
   The drug lords, men who go by nicknames like The Beast and The
Quiet One, are now making do with the more Spartan surrounding of
the high-security unit at the Southern Prison in Mexico City.
   They were transferred on July 21 from prisons in Ciudad Juarez,
Nuevo Laredo and Tijuana in a special operation by federal agents.
   The attorney general's office also has begun an investigation
into prison officials. It said the luxury in which the drug barons
were allowed to live showed the degree of their ``economic power
and the internal control based on terror.''
   Earlier this month the director of prisons admitted that Rafael
Caro Quintero, accused of masterminding the 1985 torture-slaying of
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena
Salazar, was living with his uncle and fellow drug lord in a space
designed for 250 inmates.
   Walls had been knocked out to enlarge the cells, which were then
outfitted with marble baths, a pool table, air conditioning, guest
quarters and wardrobes crammed with dozens of silk shirts.

<TEXT>
   The Exxon Valdez edged toward San Diego Bay on
Saturday as the damaged tanker made its second attempt at entering
the harbor for repairs.
   But the Valdez faced final navigational and environmental
inspections before it would be allowed into the bay on Sunday.
   The ship that caused the nation's worst oil spill was under tow
Saturday, scheduled to reach the pilot's buoy at the mouth of San
Diego Bay late Saturday, said Coast Guard Lt. Larry Solberg.
   Since Friday night's departure from waters near San Clemente
Island, 56 miles from here, the ship has been under constant
monitoring for the types of discharges that three weeks ago caused
it to be turned away from San Diego as a pollution risk.
   Under an agreement between Exxon Shipping Co. and five state
agencies, the Valdez must be leak-free for a 24-hour period prior
to entering San Diego Bay en route to National Steel and
Shipbuilding Co. for a nine-month, $25 million repair job.
   Exxon put up $20 million to ensure its performance and to cover
the costs of a cleanup should a spill occur during the Valdez's
entry.
   Solberg said the ship successfully executed a series of steering
and engine tests Friday night and there were no visible signs of
discharges.
   The Valdez, assisted by tugboats, was expected to come into the
bay on its own power under the guidance of senior San Diego harbor
pilot Capt. Edward Silva Jr.
   Meanwhile, Greenpeace activists said they would trail the Valdez
through the harbor with five sailboats and four inflatable craft in
an on-the-water protest.
   ``We're going to have a little flotilla out there but we're not
trying to block it in any way,'' said Greenpeace spokeswoman Blair
Palese. ``We want to demonstrate our concern and to bring public
attention to the need for a long-term nontoxic energy policy.''
   Solberg said the Valdez would be surrounded by eight Coast Guard
and Harbor Patrol vessels during the bay transit and a moving
safety zone will be enforced 500 yards to the tanker's front and
300 yards from the sides and stern.
   A final underwater inspection with a remote camera was planned
when the ship arrived at the pilot's buoy.
   ``The purpose of the survey is to determine if the vessel
sustained any bottom damage during its transit from San Clemente
Island and to verify the vessel is in safe condition to transit San
Diego Bay,'' Solberg said.
   More than 100 tons of dangling steel plates were sheared when
they tore loose from the hull framing during the ship's 2,500-mile
voyage from Alaska, where the vessel rammed a reef March 24.
   The Valdez's hull split open in the accident, and almost 11
million gallons of crude spilled into Prince William Sound. The
spill devastated hundreds of miles of Alaskan coastline and
wildlife habitat, and cleanup work is ongoing.

<HEAD>Actor to Do Community Service in Videotape Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Rob Lowe will do two years' community
service to avoid prosecution on charges that he videotaped a young
girl performing a sex act at a hotel during the Democratic National
Convention, a prosecutor said Saturday.
   Lowe had faced a possible criminal charge of sexual exploitation
of a minor, a charge that carries a maximum 20 years in prison and
a $100,000 fine, said District Attorney Lewis R. Slaton.
   Lowe, 25, and his father met with Slaton Friday, almost a year
after he allegedly taped the sex scene between Jan Parsons, who was
16 at the time, and a female companion at a downtown hotel room
during the 1988 convention.
   ``I needed to talk to him to size him up to see if he was OK for
the program,'' Slaton said. ``I felt the young man fit in, but I
had to be sure of his attitude.''
   A telephone call to Lowe's agent in Los Angeles late Saturday
was not immediately returned.
   The agreement was part of the state's pretrial intervention
program, ``a hybrid alternative'' to prosecution for young,
nonviolent first offenders, Slaton said. Lowe is to work with
disadvantaged youths in Los Angeles area schools.
   Lowe remains the subject of a civil lawsuit brought by Miss
Parsons' mother, Lena Arlene Wilson, who claims Lowe seduced her
daughter.
   Terms of the program will be worked out in the next few weeks,
Slaton said. He declined to discuss other details of the case.
   Lowe, star of such films as ``About Last Night...,'' ``St.
Elmo's Fire'' and ``Oxford Blues,'' should be finished with the
criminal portion of the case, his Atlanta attorney, Edgar Neely
III, said Saturday.
   ``That's the end of it,'' Neely said. ``I'm sure Rob is glad to
get it behind him so he can concentrate on other things.''

   Five farmers who died trying to save one
another in a manure pit were buried Saturday as the family grappled
with running the 100-year-old dairy.
   ``What forced them down into that pit? It certainly wasn't fame
or glory. It was love,'' the Rev. Leroy Ade told more than 200
people who jammed the Christ Evangelical Lutheran Church for
services for Carl Theuerkauf, 65, his sons Carl Jr., 37, Tom, 28
and his grandson Daniel, 15.
   ``It was true love for God, love for Christ, and love for a
fellow man that caused what we termed a tragedy,'' Ade said.
   Carl Theuerkauf would have turned 66 today.
   The funeral for Carl's cousin, Bill Hofer, 63, was held later at
Faith Lutheran Church in nearby Marinette, Wis.
   The five were overcome by methane fumes Wednesday morning trying
to save each other at the Theuerkauf family dairy barn in Menominee
County.
   Sheriff's officials believe Hofer, a farm employee, went into
the 12-foot-deep pit first _ perhaps to clear a drain _ and
collapsed after breathing the fumes, which are produced by manure.
Each one followed to rescue the man before.
   Hofer was dead when deputies arrived, said Menominee County
Sheriff Deputy Gary Corwin. Three others died later Wednesday
morning at Bay Area Medical Center in Marinette, Wis., and the
fifth was pronounced dead at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin at
Wauwatosa, Wis., he said.
   There was about a foot of manure in the pit.
   County extension service director Richard Breyer said the entire
community was shaken by the deaths.
   As a one-mile procession of mourners followed the hearses
through town to a country cemetery, Menominee residents stood by
their front windows and watched. Some stood outside in the rain and
others pulled their cars off the road.
   The Theuerkauf farm has passed from father to son for more than
100 years. Now the only direct adult heir is Carl's third son,
Bill, who was badly injured in an auto accident three years ago.
   Ade said the women will now run the farm.
   Breyer said Carl Sr.'s wife, Dorothy, would meet with him Sunday
to discuss how to handle the dairy farm, among the Upper
Peninsula's largest. The operation likely will have to be cut back.
   A memorial service was planned Sunday morning at the Menominee
County fair, said fair manager Shirley Charlier. The county Farm
Bureau closed down its fair booth this year so that volunteers who
would have worked it could help the Theuerkaufs instead.

<HEAD>Jet Loses Primary Hydraulic System Just Before Landing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American Airlines 727 passenger jet
lost its hydraulic system just before landing Saturday, forcing the
pilot to manually lower the aircraft's landing gear, officials said.
   None of the 34 people aboard Flight 1042 from Raleigh, N.C., was
injured during the 4 p.m. landing at Greater Rochester
International Airport, said a Monroe County sheriff's deputy, who
asked not to be identified.
   ``There was a loss of primary hydraulics,'' said American
spokesman Jim Brown in Dallas, Texas.
   A manual back-up system was used to lower the landing gear,
Brown said. The plane had to be towed down the runway once it
landed.
   The airline had not determined why the hydraulic system
malfunctioned. The jetliner would be grounded while the
investigation continued, Brown said.
   Passengers on the American Airlines jet said they first learned
the jetliner was in difficulty when the pilot made an announcement
minutes before it was supposed to land.
   ``He said we can't get the landing gear down,'' said Bernie
Wight, 52. ``Everyone said, `Oh No!'''
   The jetliner, Wight said, circled Lake Ontario while the landing
gear was put down manually.
   On July 19, a United Airlines DC-10 crashed when a rear engine
blew apart, causing complete hydraulic failure. The plane landed in
a fiery somersault, killing 111 people.
   Elsewhere, two other minor airline incidents were reported on
Saturday.
   In Chicago, an Eastern Airlines DC-9 lost its fiberglass tail
cone while landing at O'Hare International Airport but taxied to
the gate without incident, an airline spokeswoman said.
   Flight 236 from Atlanta to Chicago landed at 10:10 a.m.,
carrying 99 passengers and a crew of six, said Eastern spokeswoman
Bobbi Giordano.
   In Newark, N.J., a United DC-8 with 197 passengers had to shut
down one of its four engines before touching down Saturday night at
Newark International Airport, but landed safely, authorities said.
There were no injuries reported in either incident.

<UNK>Congressmen Sought Funds for Defense Group From Defense Contractors</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five congressmen on committees that oversee
defense spending helped raise money for a pro-defense group from
contractors who do business with the Pentagon, according to a
published report.
   The Washington Post, in its Sunday editions, reported seven
major defense contractors contributed $100,000 each in tax
deductible donations towards formation of the Institute for the
Common Defense after four of the congressmen, one of them since
deceased, invited them to a dinner in the fall of 1987.
   The congressmen included William Dickinson of Alabama, the
ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, a
longtime friend and former business partner to ICD's president,
Anthony S. Markris, said the Post.
   Joining Dickinson in soliciting funds for the institute were:
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, a member of the Armed Services Committee;
Sen. J. Bennett Johnson, D-La., who sits on the Appropriations
defense subcommittee; and the late Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla., then
chairman of the subcommittee, the newspaper reported.
   Dickinson and Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, invited the sponsoring
firms to another fundraiser for the institute last May, according
to the Post. But the contractors decided to end their support when
they learned no new contributors had been brought into the venture
since the first appeal in 1987.
   Dickinson and Leath also received speaking fees of $20,000 and
$15,000 respectively from several of the same companies that helped
established the group, the newspaper said.
   The institute's stated goal was to publicize the value of the
defense industry.
   General Dynamics donated to the group because there ``was a
definite feeling there was a need for this type of activity,''
company spokesman Alvin Spivak told the Post.
   ``It didn't hurt that it was supported by Congressman
Dickinson,'' he said. ``It probably helped.''

<HEAD>Loan to White House Aide Investigated</HEAD>

   A special prosecutor is investigating whether an
aide to President Bush violated federal ethics laws by failing to
repay a $5,000 loan, a newspaper reported.
   Dan Webb, a former U.S. attorney in Chicago, is trying to
determine whether a 1984 loan to James W. Cicconi was legitimate or
if it represented an illegal gift or bribe from executives of a
troubled Maryland mortgage company, the Chicago Tribune reported in
its Sunday editions.
   Cicconi, 37, runs the White House appointment office.
   The newspaper reported that the ``balloon''-type loan from First
American Mortgage Company was made in September 1984 for an
original term of 90 days. Under the arrangement, Cicconi did not
have to pay interest, which amounted to 10 percent a year, or
principal until the loan expired, and in December 1984, First
American exercised an option clause that extended the loan for an
additional year.
   The mortgage company sought protection under federal bankruptcy
laws in late 1985, and its owner and other executives later were
convicted on federal charges of defrauding company investors of
millions of dollars.
   Cicconi's lawyer, William B. Hundley, said Cicconi tried on
several occasions after the extension expired in December 1985 to
repay the loan and its accumulated interest. But Hundley said
Cicconi ``just couldn't get any information at all as to who owned
the note,'' or where to send the money.
   The Tribune said at least one former executive of the mortgage
company has told investigators that an intermediary asked him to
``do him a favor and make this loan (to Cicconi) and that it was
not to be paid back,'' presumably to win influence at the White
House.
   The intermediary, an executive for a branch of a major Wall
Street investment company, has denied making such a request, the
newspaper's sources said.
   Hundley said Cicconi never talked to the intermediary himself
and was preparing to quit his job in the Reagan White House and
enter private law practice at the time he sought the loan.
   The newspaper said that a federal official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said evidence presented to a federal grand
jury over the last six weeks ``appears to be supporting Cicconi's
view that it is a legitimate loan.''
   The official said the inquiry, which could last several more
weeks, ``may very likely not lead to the indictment of anybody.''
   ``It is my understanding that their probe has cleared (Cicconi)
of any wrongdoing, and that they're going to close it out very
shortly,'' Hundley said.
   Cicconi declined through Hundley to be interviewed.
   Hundley said he now is negotiating repayment terms with a
trustee of the company's assests appointed recently by the
bankruptcy court.

   The publisher of the Atchison Daily Globe
was found shot to death at his home Saturday, police said.
   The body of Larry Sarvey, 38, was found by an employee who had
been trying to reach him by telephone earlier in the day, said
Atchison Police Chief Ron Pickman.
   ``The only thing we've been able to do right now is rule out
robbery,'' Pickman said. ``There's no sign of an apparent struggle
inside the home.''
   Sarvey, who was divorced and lived alone, became publisher and
general manager of the Globe in February 1988. The Globe is owned
by Thomson Newspapers Inc.
   He is survived by his daughters Jill, Renay, Sarah and Veronica,
all of Binghamton, N.Y., and a son, Chris.
   Sarvey, a native of upstate New York, worked as marketing
director for Brehm Communications in Fort Madison, Iowa before
going to the Globe.
   Sarvey served in the Army in Vietnam and attended Broome
Community College in Binghamton, N.Y. He was a member of the Kansas
Press Association and the Kiwanis Club and served on the Economic
Development Board for the city of Atchison and the Salvation Army
board.

   Israeli leaders on Saturday dismissed criticism
of Israel's abduction of a pro-Iranian Moslem cleric and said he
led a ``fanatical'' group that had launched terrorist attacks on
Israel.
   Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, allegedly linked to the capture of
Israeli soldiers in Lebanon and the kidnapping of a U.S. Marine
held hostage there, was abducted Friday from his south Lebanon home
and taken to Israel in a helicopter.
   ``There may be some people who voice disapproval, but public
opinion will understand that this act was taken against one of the
leaders of one of the most fanatical groups in Lebanon,'' said
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner.
   Israel and U.S. officials have said Obeid is a leader of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah. Obeid has denied belonging to the group.
   Israel radio reported Saturday that Sheikh Abbas Musawi, a
Hezbollah leader who lives in a southern suburb of Beirut, said the
organization will not agree to a prisoner exchange and will
increase attacks on Israel.
   The fundamentalist Islamic Hezbollah advocates the destruction
of Israel and its replacement by an Iranian-style Islamic state.
   In Paris on Saturday, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar called the Israeli raid a ``violation of Lebanese
sovereignty.'' He demanded Israel return Obeid.
   Egypt accused Israel of state terrorism and said the kidnapping
could lead to increased extremism and violence in the Middle East.
   Prime Minister Hussein Musavi of Iran also called the abduction
state terrorism. He issued a statement in Tehran saying, ``These
kinds of acts will further expand the righteous activities of
Lebanese Moslems against Israel and its Phalange followers.''
   The Phalange is a right-wing, predominantly Christian party in
Lebanon.
   President Bush said Friday he could not condone the commando
raid and did not know if it would help U.S. Marine Lt. Col William
R. Higgins, one of 17 foreigners held hostage in Lebanon.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher criticized the
kidnapping, saying it could hurt the hostages.
   Pazner said Saturday, ``I don't remember hearing the same kind
of indignation when Sheik Obeid's people were involved in bloody
terrorist attacks from south Lebanon into Israel.''
   The Israeli army said Obeid served as commander of Hezbollah in
south Lebanon and that the group had organized at least 20 raids on
Israel and its allies in South Lebanon.
   Yossi Sarid, a left-wing Israeli legislator, said, ``The
question is not what world public opinion is, but if (the raid) is
helpful in freeing our kidnapped soldiers.''
   Three Israeli troopers believed held in Lebanon are soldiers
Rahamim Alsheikh and Yossi Fink, captured Feb. 17, 1986, when
guerrillas ambushed their patrol, and air force navigator Ron Arad,
seized Oct. 16, 1986, when his plane was shot down.
   Obeid is the most senior Moslem Shiite leader to be taken
captive in recent months by Israeli forces battling Palestinian
guerrillas and pro-Iraninan fundamentalists in south Lebanon.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that the idea here was to have a
major exchange,'' said Aharon Levran, a private strategic analyst
and brigadier general in the army reserves. ``But I don't think
they (Hezbollah) will yield immediately and agree to an exchange.
   ``They want him back as soon as possible, but agreeing to a
trade would show that Israel has the upper hand, so it won't take
place immediately.
   U.N. spokesman Timor Goksel said Israel is believed to hold 300
Lebanese in a prison in south Lebanon run by the Israeli-backed
South Lebanon Army militia.
   Lebanese security sources said Friday that Higgins was held
briefly in Obeid's apartment after his abduction in February 1988
while working as a U.N. monitor on the Israel-Lebanon border.
   Seventeen foreign hostages are held in Lebanon, including nine
Americans. The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Report: HUD Insured Project After Ex-Reagan Aide Intervened</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An $11.6 million HUD-guaranteed loan for a
California housing project was approved after a campaign strategist
for Presidents Bush and Reagan intervened, The New York Times
reported in its Sunday editions.
   Lou Kitchin, who was Reagan's southern political director in
1984 and was a senior campaign adviser to Bush last year, told the
Times he was paid about $30,000 for his assistance on the San Diego
project.
   Documents obtained by the newspaper indicate regional officials
of the Department of Housing and Urban Development had opposed the
apartment complex for the elderly for economic reasons.
   But they were overruled in 1987 by political appointees in
Washington, the Times said.
   Deborah Gore Dean, a friend of Kitchin who was then executive
assistant to Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., was involved
in getting the project approved, the Times said.
   An earlier report said Kitchin received $40,000 in consulting
fees for an $11 million project in Durham, N.C., that converted a
former hosiery mill into HUD-subsidized apartments for the elderly.
   One of that project's largest supporters was Durham Mayor
Charles Markham, who was a former law partner of Pierce.
   Kitchin, an Atlanta-based consultant, has ties to Reagan dating
back to 1976, the Times said.
   Kitchin told the Times that he met repeatedly with Ms. Dean.
   ``You needed her help to understand what was going on at HUD,''
he said.
   The Times said Ms. Dean declined to be interviewed.
   Kitchin said the San Diego project was a good program that
deserved federal support. He said he was retained at the project's
inception.
   The developer of the 145-apartment Woodcrest retirement complex,
Jack K. Jaynes, told the Times that Kitchin's intervention was
essential to the success of the project.
   Jaynes said Kitchin ``told me he would talk with somebody in
Washington, that he was up there frequently, that he knew all of
these people.''
   Jaynes said he remembered talking with Kitchen about Ms. Dean.
   ``It was pretty plain that Deborah Dean was the power in the
secretary's office,'' Jaynes told the Times.
   HUD has been the subject of internal, congressional and Justice
Department investigations. Mismanagement and abuses have been found
in a number of the multibillion-dollar agency's programs.
   Kitchin, however, has attracted almost no attention from
congressional panels investigating possible political influence at
the housing department under Reagan.

   A Grand Trunk Western Railroad train
partially derailed Saturday, forcing several hundred residents from
their homes for about 5{ hours, officials said. No injuries were
reported.
   The evacuation was ordered after what officials believed was
battery acid was found leaking from one of the 24 of 67 cars that
derailed, said Grand Trunk spokesman Tim Weir. The material turned
out to be lard from a car of cow hides, Weir said. The material was
contained and the cargo was loaded on other flatcars so it could be
moved, he said.
   The derailed cars toppled a utility pole, briefly knocking out
electrical and telephone service in this community just north of
the Michigan-Indiana border, said Sgt. Rod Cruzen, of the Cass
County Sheriff's Department.
   The train was headed to Chicago from Detroit. Grand Trunk, a
subsidiary of Canadian National Railways, services industries and
agriculture in Michigan, Illinois, Ohio and Indiana.
   In Freeland, Mich., about 200 people evacuated from their houses
following a fiery train derailment eight days ago were allowed to
go home Saturday night after air quality tests being conducted by
Michigan health officials and CSX Transportation Inc., showed no
evidence of pollution, said railroad spokesman R. Lindsay Leckie.
   Seven loaded and seven unloaded cars derailed July 22 after the
32-car train had nearly completed its run from Port Huron to
Midland. The accident, which is being investigated, sparked a
fierce chemical fire that spewed heavy smoke and burned until
Friday.

   Nine out of 10 Americans think drugs are a chief
or important cause of crime and 81 percent favor National Guard
patrols in drug-infested neighborhoods, according to a survey
released Saturday.
   New York City ranked highest in a ``Fear Index'' of the poll,
followed by Miami, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
   The survey, sponsored by the Lexis computer legal research
service and the National Law Journal, showed that 77 percent want
juveniles treated as adults and 74 percent favor the death penalty
for some murderers.
   Asked to choose the ``chief'' or ``important'' causes of crime,
91 percent said drugs; 87 percent said the failure of the criminal
justice system and 81 percent cited a decline in moral and ethical
values.
   But 58 percent would oppose a new tax dedicated to fighting
crime and only 41 percent favor it, the survey said.
   Those polled were asked to score the perceived safety of
American cities, from one (very safe) to 10 (very unsafe).
   The worst eight: New York, 7.65; Miami, 7.23; Los Angeles, 6.95;
Washington, D.C., 6.78; Chicago, 6.56; Detroit, 6.38; Atlanta,
4.81; and Boston, 4.46.
   Racism is a problem in the criminal justice system, according to
78 percent of the whites and 93 percent of the blacks surveyed.
Forty-five percent blamed police for the problems, while 18 percent
blamed prosecutors and 14 percent blamed judges.
   Among the other findings:
   _ 90 percent said the legal system makes it too easy for
criminals to delay trial or enter a plea bargain.
   _ 87 percent said the justice system doesn't adequately punish
criminals.
   _ 68 percent think violent television shows encourage crime and
63 percent favor laws to restrict violence on TV.
   _ 62 percent favor the death penalty for major drug dealers.
   Forty percent of those surveyed said they owned a gun. Of those,
36 percent said they used them for sport, 16 percent for protection
and 44 percent for both purposes.
   Fifty-eight percent, however, believed gun control laws should
be strengthened.
   The poll of 1,000 people was conducted July 7-9 by Penn + Schoen
Associates. The margin of error, depending on the question, varies
from plus or minus 3.1 percentage points to 4.4 points.
   Of those polled, 83 percent were white; 10 percent black; 3
percent Hispanic and 2 percent Asian. Forty-one percent called
themselves moderate; 31 percent conservative and 23 percent liberal.

   A coal mine flooded Saturday night
trapping 21 miners and authorities feared they were dead.
   ``The possibilities of them being alive are almost
non-existent,'' said the town's fire chief, Miguel Cuevas.
   Cuevas said the flood occurred about 7 p.m. when a section of
the mine that was filled with water burst, sending mud and rocks
into a section where miners were working. Four miners managed to
escape and notified rescue workers.
   Cuevas said rescue crews and firefighters were on the scene late
Saturday night, and that it would probably take 12 hours for them
to reach the trapped miners.
   Curanilahue is about 390 miles south of Santiago in the heart of
the Chilean coal mining region.
   The region is wet most of the year and water continuously leaks
into the mines, which contain large pockets of water, Cuevas said.
   He said it had been raining in the area but that there was no
reason to believe that the precipitation caused the accident.
   The mine is privately owned and all work is under contract for
the state coal company, Enacar, Cuevas said. Enacar's rescue crews
were on the scene, he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six-year-old Dooney Waters lives in what
Prince George's County police and social service workers call a
crack house.
   The door that leads to the apartment is riddled with bullet
holes and gaps that are usually stuffed with wads of paper or
balled-up socks where there once were locks.
   ``Drugs have wrecked my mother,'' says Dooney. ``Drugs have
wrecked a lot of mothers and fathers and children and babies. If I
don't be careful, drugs are going to wreck me too.''
   Dooney's tale came in the first of two articles in Sunday's
editions of The Washington Post.
   The Post said a reporter and photographer spent more than two
months this spring chronicling Dooney's life in a Washington
Heights apartment complex that Prince George's County police have
identified as one of the most active drug markets in Landover.
   Dooney is the child's nickname. Waters is his legal surname.
   ``My mother don't take care of me,'' Dooney said during an
interview with the newspaper in late May. ``All she want is drugs.''
   Addie Lorraine Waters, 32, described herself as a ``slave to
cocaine.'' She told the newspaper she allowed drug dealers to use
her apartment in exchange for steady support of her habit.
   The apartment is in a neighborhood where more than a dozen
slayings occurred last year but there are no locks on the front
door so addicts and drug dealers have easy access.
   Dooney now lives in the district with his father, a federal
employee who asked not to be identified.
   ``I just couldn't let him stay in a place like that,'' said
Dooney's father, who himself served prison time for a drug
conviction but has been separated from Dooney's mother for three
years.
   ``There was no one watching over him,'' he said.
   At home, where Dooney was burned when a woman tossed boiling
water at his mother's face in a drug dispute, the boy was painfully
shy.
   But teachers described Dooney as exhaustively outgoing in school
where they said he often begged to be taken to their homes. They
said he once asked if he could stay overnight in his classroom.
   Dooney was at home, but asleep when his brother Frank Russell
West, 13, was shot in the left shoulder.
   His mother didn't press charges against Edward ``June'' Powell,
the man police charged with shooting Russell. She said Powell, who
is out on bail, was trying to shoot someone else, adding that
Russell still considers him a friend.
   ``Everybody knows about the drugs at my house,'' Dooney said
with a matter-of-fact tone not common to a first-grader. ``The
police know, too, but they don't do nothing about it. Don't nobody
do nothing about it,'' he said.
   Prince George's County police said they know about Waters'
operation but have never found enough drugs in the apartment to
charge her or others.
   ``The problem is that drugs don't last long up there,'' said
Officer Alex Bailey, who patrols the Washington Heights
neighborhood. ``They use them up as soon as they arrive.''

<TEXT>
   Soldiers killed 110 guerrillas of the Shining
Path movement in three battles including one in which 60 rebels and
seven soldiers died, the government reported Saturday.
   It said the fighting occurred Thursday and Friday, during the
Independence Day holidays, in jungle areas northeast of Lima. Peru
celebrated its 168th anniversary of independence from Spain on
Friday.
   A communique carried by the government's Andina news agency gave
this account of the battles:
   Three army units clashed with a group of about 150 rebels
Thursday near Madre Mia, 235 miles northeast of Lima in Huanuco
district. Sixty guerrillas and seven soldiers were killed and 12
troops wounded.
   Thirty rebels were killed in a fight near the town of Nuevo
Progreso, 255 miles northeast of Lima, but the military did not say
if the army suffered any casualties.
   In the third clash near Tulumayo, 220 miles northeast of the
capital and also in Huanuco, 20 rebels and one soldier were killed
and one soldier was wounded.
   The communique said the army captured large caches of arms
following the battles. It did not elaborate.
   The government reported earlier this month that more than 100
Shining Path guerrillas had been killed in Huanuco as army units
and helicopters conducted a series of raids in a counterinsurgency
operation.
   The Maoist Shining Path began its campaign to overthrow the
government in 1980 and the government says more than 15,000 people
have been killed in the fighting.

   Cash-poor Salem College merged with a
Japanese university and emerged Friday as Salem-Teikyo University
in a deal sweetened with a $12 million endowment by a Japanese
businessman and educator.
   In spring 1990, 100 Japanese students will join the 500 enrolled
at Salem in a program aimed at enriching the lives of the two
groups by helping them learn about each other, said Dr. Shoicki
Okinaga, chairman and president of Teikyo University of Japan.
   Eventually, 500 Japanese students will be integrated with 500
American students, who will share dormitory space and take classes
in both English and Japanese, said Percy Ashcraft, spokesman for
Salem.
   Okinaga told the crowd present for the announcement he gave
Salem the $12 million endowment to help it remain operational as a
school for international education.
   The school, with three major buildings on its northern West
Virginia campus, was in financial trouble when Okinaga and school
officials got together through the assistance of Sen. Jay
Rockefeller, D-W.Va., who spent three years studying in Japan.
   Ronald E. Ohl, president of Salem College and president of the
new university, said Rockefeller was the key to the merger, which
fuses the two schools but retains American control of Salem-Teikyo
and its private status.
   ``This is absolutely an extraordinary occurrence,'' Rockefeller
said. ``We're talking about the beginning of an entirely new
university for West Virginia. I am astounded by it, awed by it,
thrilled by it.''
   ``International understanding and the partnership of Japan and
the United States will be furthered by this unique educational
venure,'' said Okinaga, who also is a physician and educator.
``Salem-Teikyo University will represent the very best
American-international education opportunity.''
   Teikyo University, with campuses throughout Japan, was founded
in 1966.

   The kidnapping of a Shiite Moslem cleric by
Israeli commandos could put pressure on pro-Iranian terrorists to

Israeli officials.
   ``Clearly when you capture one of their top leaders it can deter
terrorism and you have a certain amount of leverage in your

helicopter-borne commandos.
   Seized by the commandos were cleric Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, his

ban Friday after a 25-25 vote on a ban that would have covered all
domestic flights indicated growing congressional support for
proposals to broaden the airline smoking ban.
   The tie vote defeated the wider ban, but it was the closest a
congressional vote has come to outlawing all smoking on airliners.
   The bill, passed on a voice vote by the House Public Works and
Transportation Committee, is one of several proposals to extend or
expand the 1987 temporary smoking ban on flights of two hours or
less. That ban expires in April.

   The Bush administration is threatening to withhold
U.S. aid to Cambodia if the Khmer Rouge is given a dominant role in
a new transitional government.
   But the policy paper distributed to reporters today as Secretary
of State James A. Baker III arrived here for a 20-nation conference
acknowledged that Prince Norodom Sihanouk might include the group
whose leaders are accused of murdering more than a million
Cambodians more than a decade ago.
   ``The U.S. would continue to support him,'' the paper said. It
offered the same assurance if Sihanouk also gave a role to members
of pro-Vietnam Prime Minister Hun Sen's government.
   Sihanouk is recognized by all Cambodian factions as the logical
head of an interim government to be formed after the withdrawal of
Vietnamese troops in late September.

   President Bush says he'll do his best to make
sure that Exxon lives up to its responsibility to clean the
oil-soaked shores of Alaska.
   ``If I had the feeling Exxon was going to pull back on an
agreement or fail to fulfill an agreement they'd made with us, with
the government, or with the state of Alaska, I would ... try my
best to do something about it,'' Bush said at a news conference
Friday.
   The president's remarks came hours after Exxon executives told a
congressional panel that the company will suspend cleanup
operations for the winter by mid-September.
   However, company officials said they would agree to any
``reasonable'' continuation of the cleanup next spring.

   The fire-damaged Jackson Laboratory is
taking on a crash program to replenish the nation's supply of rare
research mice and gambling that tax money will keep it in business.
   The world's leading producer of unusual laboratory mice is using
all its resources on mouse production rather than rebuilding, its
director said.
   The fire two months ago at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor
crippled much medical research.
   By not using its insurance money to construct a permanent
facility, the laboratory is facing the possibility that it will go
out of business in as little as a year.

   Over a cup of coffee or a piece of
homemade pie at Lizzie's Cafe, folks talk about the silvery pagoda
that rises 82 feet out of the prairie.
   ``It's the closest thing to a tourist attraction we've got,''
said Lizzie Guthmiller, who runs the only cafe in this central
North Dakota farming community of 125 residents.
   The structure is the brainchild of Henry Luehr, who declared it
finished a year ago after working on it about five years.
   ``I guess I call it finished because when there's nothing else
to do you just have to call it done,'' said the 69-year-old
repairman, who has lived in the area all his life.

   Today is Sunday, July 30, the 211th day of 1989. There are 154
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On July 30, 1792, the French national anthem ``La
Marseillaise,'' by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle, was first sung in
Paris.
   On this date:
   In 1619, the first representative assembly in America convened
in Jamestown, Va.
   In 1729, the city of Baltimore was founded.
   In 1863, American automaker Henry Ford was born in Dearborn
Township, Mich.
   In 1864, during the Civil War, Union forces tried to take
Petersburg, Va., by exploding a mine under Confederate defense
lines that left a huge crater. The attack failed.
   In 1889, Vladimir Zworykin, often called the Father of
Television for inventing the iconoscope, was born in Russia.
   In 1916, German saboteurs blew up a munitions plant on Black Tom
Island near Jersey City, N.J.
   In 1932, the Summer Olympics opened in Los Angeles.
   In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill creating
a women's auxiliary agency in the Navy. The legislation was called
Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service, or WAVES.
   In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Medicare bill,
which went into effect the following year.
   In 1975, former Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa mysteriously
disappeared in suburban Detroit.
   In 1975, representatives of 35 nations convened in Helsinki,
Finland, for a conference aimed at ensuring peace in Europe.
   In 1983, Lynn Fontanne, one of Broadway's premier actresses and
the widow of actor Alfred Lunt, died at her home in Genesee Depot,
Wis., at age 95.
   Ten years ago: Paul A. Volcker, President Carter's nominee to be
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told the Senate Banking
Committee his top priority would be to fight domestic inflation.
   Five years ago: West German swimmer Michael Gross became the
first double gold winner of the 1984 Summer Olympics, while the
United States picked up three gold medals in swimming and shooting.
   One year ago: Jordan's King Hussein dissolved his country's
lower house of Parliament, half of whose 60 members came from the
Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   Today's birthdays: Actor Edd Byrnes is 56. Director Peter
Bogdanovich is 50. Feminist leader Eleanor Smeal is 50. U.S. Rep.
Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., is 49. Singer Paul Anka is 48.
Actor-body builder Arnold Schwarzenegger is 42. Singer Kate Bush is
31.
   Thought for today: ``Some men are like pyramids, which are very
broad when they touch the ground, but grow narrow as they reach the
sky.'' _ Henry Ward Beecher, American clergyman (1813-1887).

   Every year, more country towns are cut off from
basic services, ranging from medical care to bus transportation,
without which people look elsewhere for a place to live. In the
second part of an AP Extra series, ``Rural Crossroads,'' Southeast
Regional Reporter Strat Douthat examines the reasons and the
results, focusing on a once-thriving Kentucky town.

   When Emma Alexander harks back to the days
of her youth she sees this western Kentucky border community as it
was then, a bustling little railroad town, a place of high hopes
and promise.
   If only today's young people could see what it was like back
then, the 96-year-old woman says.
   ``Why, we had 22 Greyhound buses stopping here every day. And
the trains, land sakes, they stopped here every hour, it seemed
like. We had four department stores in Guthrie. The streets were
always full of people.''
   Now, like thousands of other small towns across the country,
Guthrie has been bypassed by the railroads, by the bus lines, by
prosperity.
   And the young people _ looking at now, not then, and seeing no
career jobs, no reason to stay on _ flee as soon as they finish
high school.
   James Golden is one of those who fled.
   ``First, the movie theater closed, shortly after I finished
school, 25 years ago. Then, we lost our high school to
consolidation. The trains stopped coming after that. More recently,
we lost our bus service. Then, last year, the elementary school was
closed.''
   Hettie Louise Griffey, a retired teacher, said she ``like to
cried when they took away our little school. It's been one thing
after another.''
   Such losses take a terrible toll on the quality of life in a
small community. And unfortunately, says Golden, now the research
director for the National Association of Counties in Washington,
D.C., Guthrie has become a paradigm for what's happened to many
country places in the United States.
   ``It's sad, what has befallen our rural communities,'' he said.
   Guthrie was a transfer point on the Louisville &amp; Nashville
Railroad. It's the birthplace of Robert Penn Warren, the Pulitzer
prize-winning writer.
   ``It used to be a proud little town but now there's almost no
hope of bringing in new industry or reviving the spirit of the
community,'' Golden said.
   The plight of these troubled towns can't be traced to a single
cause, but Golden cites two recent blows: the deregulation of the
transportation industry in the early '80s and the end, in 1985, of
federal revenue sharing, which provided millions for small-town
projects.
   ``With deregulation, the airlines and bus lines pulled out and
many communities became increasingly isolated as they lost their
daily links to the wider world,'' he said.
   A 1986 study by the Interstate Commerce Commission showed that
no fewer than 4,514 points lost bus service between November 1982
and January 1986. By 1986, more than 10,000 of the nation's 18,000
named communities were totally without service.
   ``And the end of revenue sharing has meant a loss of many
essential public works projects and a cutback in those social
services so important in holding together a community,'' Golden
said.
   A National Association of Counties study earlier this year
examining the impact of lost revenue sharing on 28 Kentucky
counties found widespread cuts in senior citizens programs, parks
and recreation spending, and fire, police and ambulance services.
   ``Our small towns are losing hope,'' said Golden. ``We're trying
to get a new initiative for rural development from Congress.
Something needs to be done.''
   Guthrie Mayor John Coke couldn't be more in agreement.
   ``When they took away revenue sharing we lost 20 percent of our
budget,'' Coke said. ``And we're talking about the part that really
hurt.''
   As a result, he said, the town's two police cars have well over
100,000 miles each on their odometers, with no funds to replace
them. Other services are being maintained at marginal levels,.
   He shook his head sadly as he surveyed the town's main street,
now dotted with sagging, empty storefronts and even emptier
sidewalks.
   ``Back in our heyday the streets were always busy,'' said Coke.
``Salesmen would come to Guthrie, park their cars and take the
trains because the connections were so good. We had three active
hotels then.
   ``Now, about all that's left of downtown is a drugstore, a
funeral home, a hardware store, an auto parts store and a furniture
store that's going out of business.''
   The town, he said, is full of railroad retirees and their
widows. He acknowledged there's little to hold the young people,
except maybe the prospect of a job in the local sewing factory or
wood treatment plant.
   ``And who wants that?'' asked 18-year-old Sarah Harper of nearby
Allensville. ``I'm in college. I come home to work during the
summer but I've got no intention of staying here; there's nothing
here but farm work or a low-level factory job, nothing you'd want
to spend your life doing.''
   As a result, Guthrie's 1,800 residents, like those in other
small, rural towns, tend to be older than the national median. And
at a time in their lives when residents need ready access to
medical services, Guthrie has only a part-time clinic staffed by
two general practitioners who work out of a mobile home.
   From 1980 to 1988, 208 rural hospitals closed, according to the
American Hospital Association. Some 130 rural counties, with a
total population of more than 500,000, have no active physicians,
the American Medical Association said.
   ``We once had seven doctors here,'' recalled Emma Alexander,
whose late husband ran a busy service station back in the 1930s,
when Guthrie was on the main route between Chicago and Florida.
   ``They called us the crossroads of the world back then,'' she
said. ``You could go anywhere on a train. You could get a train to
Nashville three or four times before noon, every day. Now, if I
want to go to the doctor over in Clarksville, Tenn., I've got to
pay somebody to take me.
   ``There's no taxi service here, but a local woman has a van and
she'll take you the 18 miles down to Clarksville. Sometimes it
costs me $25 to $30 to go see the doctor.''
   Coke points out that Todd County provides Guthrie's elderly and
indigent with once-a-week bus service to Russellville, the county
seat. But he says most people would be stuck if they didn't have a
car or a neighbor to drive them.
   ``The town started to decline after it was bypassed by the
highway and train passenger service began to fall off,'' said
Robert Penn Warren, who long ago left to settle in Connecticut. Now
84, the novelist and poet was born in the countryside near Guthrie
and moved to town when he was very young.
   ``My father went there because of the opportunity,'' he said.
``He was the president of a small bank. I went to school in Guthrie
and I can still remember the excitment of the trains stopping at
all hours of the day and night. I moved away but my late brother
stayed and built a big grain elevator there.''
   When his brother was alive, Warren said, he used to return home
frequently. Now, like everyone else, he has little reason to go to
Guthrie, the onetime ``crossroads of the world.''

<TEXT>
   When it comes to a football or basketball
game, Rockwell is the enemy around here. But when it comes to a
more critical issue _ survival _ old rivals are new allies.
   These two communities have decided that united they stand,
divided they fall into the bleak landscape of ghost towns littering
America's heartland.
   So Thornton, Rockwell and five other hamlets have formed a
``cluster'' called the Area Community Commonwealth, one of a
growing number of such programs in Iowa that aim to keep small
towns alive by sharing classrooms, workers or equipment and pooling
resources to attract business.
   ``It's going to take a joint effort to save our schools and save
our Main Streets,'' said Chris Nannenga, the commonwealth's
founder. ``We realized we've got to do something to stop our
erosion. Basically our only solution is to work together.''
   About 17 Iowa ``clusters'' have been or are being formed _ one
along Interstate 80, others within counties _ to offset the 1980s'
rural economic decline that has seen farmers lose their land,
merchants lose their stores and hard-working people lose their
dreams.
   ``If you're sitting in a town of 500, and you start talking
about economic and community development, your options are so
limited,'' said Tim Borich, an Iowa State University rural
development specialist working with some of the clusters.
   ``What we're really doing is redefining what community is ...
and dispelling some of the fatalism. Maybe if we work together, we
can keep the boat afloat yet.''
   The Area Community Commonwealth, the first cluster, formed in
1986. Besides Thornton and Rockwell, the group's towns are
Sheffield, Dougherty, Swaledale, Chapin and Meservey.
   For years, the communities were divided by athletic and economic
rivalries, vying for trophies and business dollars. ``There was not
a sense of common good,'' Nannenga said. ``It was all for you, none
for me.''
   Most of the towns had struggled with shrinking school
enrollments, the domino-like closings of hardware stores, factories
and taverns and the shopping exodus to Mason City, which is large
enough to support a K mart and Wal-Mart.
   ``Young people left,'' said Gene Persons, a grocer and the
commonwealth treasurer. ``Unemployment was high. People's attitudes
were down.''
   It happened all across Iowa. Almost half the gas stations and
nearly a third of the state's groceries closed from 1976 to '88,
said Ken Stone, an Iowa State economist.
   One big obstacle is most small towns don't have enough money to
hire experts to lure industry, nor enough voters to wield much
political influence.
   The commonwealth towns' separate populations, for example, range
from 128 to about 1,200. But as a group, 6,500 people ``give us a
little more leverage to be listened to in the Legislature,''
Persons said.
   The group's biggest coup was last year's 60th birthday
celebration for Mickey Mouse, organized with the Walt Disney Co. A
much-publicized giant silhouette of Mickey's head, visible from the
air, was created by meticulous surveying and planting in a 530-acre
corn and oat field between Sheffield and Dougherty.
Transcontinental airline pilots pointed it out to their surprised
passengers.
   Disney worked with the towns to hold a two-day party in August
in Sheffield, which drew 45,000 people. The commonwealth netted
abut $48,000 _ profits from T-shirts and hats and other concessions.
   Other projects are much smaller, such as a grade sharing program
in which two school districts exchange junior high and high school
students, filling classrooms and saving money.
   Two towns share a police officer, and some small retail outlets
have set up satellite stores so residents don't have to travel 20
miles to get film developed or buy vegetables or hardware.
   There's no more Us vs. Them.
   ``We've turned a win-lose situation into a win-win situation,''
Nannenga said.
   An industrial park also was established in Rockwell in 1988 and
a small water bottling company has opened, receiving a $30,000 loan
from a $50,000 state grant the commonwealth received. A company
that makes equipment that picks up recyclable products is
considering moving there.
   ``We can't handle the industries that are going to employ 150 to
200 people,'' Nannenga admitted. ``We don't have the housing. We
don't have the infrastructure. We may not be able to sell washing
machines, but we can fix them.''
   Practicality is an important part of a cluster's success, said
Kathy Beery, Iowa's rural development coordinator. ``If you have
some unrealistic goals it's going to be very frustrating. You don't
want to come together just because you're desperate. Perhaps
there's some natural resource they can build on ... or perhaps some
existing business.''
   Five communities in a cluster north of Des Moines are doing
that, developing a nature trail-biking corridor shared by three of
the towns.
   ``We don't want to lose the spirit of competition ... yet we
want to capitalize on cooperation,'' said Mayor Howard Hammond of
Slater, one of the towns. ``This is the only way we're going to
survive.''

   Worn by long hours and weary of watching the
town shrink, Bill Brzezinski threw in the towel on his Silver Spur
Cafe 18 months ago, selling off the only restaurant in this dusty
west Texas hamlet.
   Like the hardware store, the gas station, the grocery and so
many others in so many towns in so many parts of rural America, the
Silver Spur soon failed, and Brzezinski figured Roby wasn't far
behind.
   But today, an unusual economic development plan has begun to
breathe new life into this one-stoplight town. A new retirement
center has opened, and because of aggressive promotion, coveys of
quail hunters now flock to Fisher County.
   Even the Silver Spur is going to shine again. Brzezinski is
renovating the cafe and bringing it back from the dead this fall,
convinced that the hungry hunters who come from 26 states for the
four-month season will help the town of 814, and its only
restaurant, survive.
   ``Our attitude has changed,'' he said. ``This is what has
inspired me to do it again.''
   What's happening in Fisher County is held up across remote areas
as an innovative approach to saving dying towns. Yet even here,
after a handful of small successes, the future remains mostly
bleak, and experts say the situation underscores just how difficult
it is to revitalize rural America.
   ``We have slowed the departure rate but, honestly, we haven't
stopped it or reversed it,'' said David Morris, chairman of the
county's economic development commission. ``All this is for naught
unless we find the key to repopulating rural America.''
   Three years ago, Fisher County's leaders declared a crisis: If
they didn't do something, the county would die. Typical of small
rural towns across the country, the population had already declined
44 percent over 10 years to just 5,000. Storefronts were boarded
up. People, especially the young, moved to the cities.
   ``We were kind of desperate _ no doubt about it,'' said Richard
Spencer, the county agriculture extension agent who brought
together the local leaders.
   They rounded up state and national experts on economic
development and sought their advice.
   They created the Fisher County Economic Development Commission,
and they made one key decision: Go for all the little projects they
could think of, not one big project.
   ``Everyone thinks that General Motors is going to come drop a
factory in here or the B-2 (stealth bomber) program will drop in
here. That doesn't happen, and that's the common mistake rural
people make,'' said Morris, a specialist on developing Third World
nations who retired to run a motel here.
   The result has become a creative, if unconventional, model for
rural economic development.
   ``They have less money and resources to work with, and yet after
10 years of decline, now they've got new money coming in,'' said
David Guarino of the Texas Department of Agriculture, which has
provided a grant for the quail hunting effort. ``If they can do it,
you can do it all over.''
   The commission has set out to revive this depressed cattle,
cotton and oil area by promoting it as a retirement spot, drawing
tourists and finding ways to keep citizens from leaving.
   Two commission members bought an abandoned nursing home and
helped find new owners who have refurbished it. It's now the
county's only retirement center _ even though 60 percent of the
population is over age 55.
   Realizing Fisher County had Texas' largest quail population, the
commission formed a quail-hunting cooperative, which in its first
year brought in 140 hunters and an estimated $100,000 of new
spending.
   ``One hundred thousand dollars is an attention-getter in this
town,'' said Billy Don Atkinson, a Roby-based federal agriculture
official who helps run the co-op.
   And in Fisher County, they'll try anything.
   The commission is hoping to build a memorial garden for slain
police officers and turn an abandoned electric train depot into a
museum to draw tourists. They're trying to raise money and serve
the large poverty-level population with a food bank and
used-clothing store. They've helped open a recreational vehicle
park.
   The group even formed the National Domino Association and played
host to a first-ever national tournament.
   Not all of the ideas are working.
   The domino idea, while fun, hasn't produced much money and will
probably be cut back. The law enforcement monument has drawn a
15-acre land donation, but has only $400 in the bank.
   ``Time is short; doom is just around the corner,'' said the Rev.
Alvin Petty, the leader of the commission's tourism task force.
``We've only got three or four more years to achieve a great deal
because we're losing 8 percent of our population a year.''
   Commission officials say they now know that their small-scale
endeavors are simply setting the stage for necessary larger
development. ``We have prepared the table, but we haven't gotten to
the meat and potatoes,'' Morris said.
   And help will have to come from Washington, he believes, in the
form of a modern Homestead Act that would once again encourage
people to return to rural areas.
   ``Until we get that kind of public policy, the rest of this is
Mickey Mouse. If they don't put that structure in place, all of
rural America will be blowing in the wind.''

   Don Cherry is going back to his roots; Neneh
Cherry is still developing hers.
   He moves and speaks in the rhythms of cool jazz, spontaneous and
refined; she is warm and down-to-earth, with just a hint of the
passion and hot funk generated by her hit single, ``Buffalo
Stance.''
   His peers include jazz greats Ornette Coleman and Miles Davis;
hers are such pop royalty as Prince and Madonna.
   But listen closely, and a similar spirit can be heard _ what Don
Cherry might refer to as ``world music,'' or what Neneh Cherry
would call ``positive energy.''
   Don is Neneh's stepfather, and they share a common outlook on
life and music. They talked recently about their music and lives in
an interview at Neneh's midtown Manhattan apartment.
   ``It's wonderful what's happening,'' said Don Cherry, the jazz
trumpeter who has just released ``Art Deco,'' his first studio
album of straight jazz in over two decades.
   ``The whole planet has this connection of music and sound.
Russia and Japan and Africa _ everyone's trying to express
themselves. In the past three years, there's been a lot of energy
and acceptance of things fresh.''
   He includes Neneh's ``Raw Like Sushi'' album in that category.
   ``What Neneh's doing in music is what all people can relate to,
the whole planet. There's a lot of things happening now that are a
blessing. I hear Neneh's songs on the radio, that's a blessing. And
all of us feel that way. It's a new generation.''
   The Cherrys trade compliments with ease and joy, celebrating
their music and each other. Don sees Neneh's career as a
continuation of her happy upbringing.
   ``Neneh's always been a person to be with people,'' he said.
``She's always socialized. That's her karma. So many people are
making records where they do everything, the drum parts and all. I
don't think Neneh could be like that, she enjoys working with
people.''
   Neneh was born in 1964 and grew up in Sweden and New York,
leaving school at age 14. After appearing in a number of
underground bands, she began working on ``Raw Like Sushi'' last
year.
   ``Music has always been natural to me,'' she said, ``but I
didn't really make the decision to get involved with it until I was
involved with working in a group.
   ``Music's always been there like a way of life, always. But I
didn't start writing any material until I was out of two band
situations. I took everything I had learned from the rest of my
life and did something with it.''
   ``Buffalo Stance'' combines rock, jazz, funk and disco.
   ``The best blessing I've had in my life is feeling I don't have
to define the various influences. `Now we're going to do a reggae
song, a jazz song.' In `Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,' Paul Newman's
saying, `I need the click in my head, then I'll feel all right.'
   ``At some point, a few years ago, I got that click. It's given
me the freedom to make songs. We're in tune to where the raw energy
is.''
   ``The Next Generation'' is a track off ``Raw Sushi.'' Neneh, a
mother of two, is already thinking of a world far removed from the
dance floors where her music is heard.
   ``When you have a child, all of life and all children begin to
matter in a different way,'' she said. ``It opened me up. Children
are not being given the right information and they need to learn.''
   ``You become aware of education,'' Don added. ``When Neneh was
growing up, we started visiting schools ourselves; that's what
education is. Not in material things, or this false love. The most
important thing you can give kids is yourself.''
   Don Cherry, born in 1936, grew up in the Watts section of Los
Angeles and was soon exposed to Billie Holliday, Charlie Parker and
other jazz legends. Like Neneh, music was more important than
school, and he began cutting classes for the chance to jam with
local musicians.
   He was just 17 when he started playing with Coleman, the alto
sax player who helped develop free jazz, which relied on
spontaneous interaction between musicians rather than extended
solos.
   In the late 1950s, Cherry was part of the Coleman quartet whose
engagement at New York's Five Spot Cafe attracted worldwide
attention.
   He also played with Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane and made his
first visit to the Third World in the mid-'60s, going from
Copenhagen to Morocco, and soon incorporated new sounds into his
music.
   ``You look at the catalogs in the record stores,'' he said,
``the jazz department, new wave, fusion, new age. It's all coming
together, it's world music.
   ``We're growing as listeners and as players, too. We've become
more aware of what we have to work with. Jazz has gotten to be a
gumbo. America's a gumbo. It's good to know about each other's
culture. It's one of the greatest forms of education and it's
happening in all of music.''
   For ``Art Deco,'' he plays with just three other musicians, all
longtime friends: tenor saxophonist James Clay, bassist Charlie
Haden and drummer Billy Higgins.
   They recorded 10 songs, including three Coleman numbers (``The
Blessing,'' ``When Will the Blues Leave'' and ``Compute''), the
standards ``Body and Soul'' and ``I've Grown Accustomed to Your
Face,'' and the title track, a Cherry composition.
   ``It was a pleasure,'' he said. ``We had the best engineer in
jazz (Rudy Van Gelder), the producer (John Snyder) had his heart in
it and the musicians had been playing together. We played at the
Village Vanguard for one week and at the end of the week we started
recording.
   ``It's a pure jazz record.''
   The Cherrys talk excitedly about working together and recording
each other's material. Both see music as a way of communication.
   ``Music is good that way,'' Don said. ``A lot of people don't
handle music because it makes you compoletely nude. You play music
and you can find a whole person's innerself. When you're creating
and improvising, you have to be real honest.''
   Neneh spoke of her song, ``Manchild,'' and how it expressed her
idea of personal growth: ``It's about a man who feels inadequate,
feels he has to establish himself materially in a certain kind of
way.
   ``You see a lot of people, aggressive people who are macho
because they're insecure. ... I'm in touch with myself and I'm
getting to know myself more.''

<HEAD>Corporate Dieting All Over Again</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like that friend of yours who regularly embarks
on slim-and-trim diets, American industry is doing its thing again.
It is seeking to slice poundage from its bureacracy, the better to
court the consumer.
   Some of the biggest companies in America are doing it. Usually a
company is measured large because of its sales and earnings. In
this instance, some of the them are large also because of their
bulging midriffs.
   Faced with competition that seems to grow more intense as
foreigners invade each other's markets, companies are cutting much
of their excess baggage _ plants, products and people.
   Almost all the big-name companies, the kind that seek to sell
worldwide, are doing it. Not all of them are American companies
either.
   The currency advantage that once gave Japanese firms an edge in
exports is greatly reduced now, so they must become even more
efficient. Europe may become a vast common market in 1992, adding
greatly to competitiveness there.
   But it's an old story in the United States. There was little
industrial fat to be found in American companies right after World
War II, but the easy days of the 1960s took care of that. Waste and
inefficiency developed.
   By the 1970s, American companies were finding themselves at a
competitive disadvantage. The industrial might of Europe and Japan,
destroyed in the war, was much newer and more technologically
efficient than American factories.
   The effect was shocking. The products of the bloated
bureaucracies and dated factories of America were undercut by
foreign products shipped thousands of miles to showrooms. Foreign
quality steadily improved while America's fell.
   That shocking experience brought on a crash diet. Old factories
were closed. Layers of white-collar workers were eliminated.
Billions of dollars were spent on new production facilities.
Nonessential units were sold off.
   That desperate diet of the 1970s had much to do with the success
of American business in the 1980s. But success, it seems, has its
dangers, the worst of them complacency. Bureaucratic baggage has
accreted again.
   No company, no matter how great its reputation, is immune:
Oldtimers such as International Business Machines Corp. and the Big
Three automakers, post-war phenoms such as Digital Equipment Corp.
and Polaroid Corp., and upstart Apple Computer Inc.
   After a terrible start, the decade of the 1980s has the
appearance of the 1960s all over. The economy has grown,
unemployment has dropped and inflation and interest rates are under
control again. And the fat has developed.
   Just 10 years after having been rescued from the edge of
bankruptcy, and after having cut expenses to the bone, Chrysler
Corp. is now forced to go on crash diet that, it hopes, will save
$1 billion by the end of 1990.
   The proposed cuts reveal where the fat had grown: Chrysler's
white-collar work force, up about 50 percent in six years, would be
reduced by 2,300 staffers. Cost cuts in materials would be sought.
Production would be streamlined.
   There is nothing new in such goals. In theory, such efficiencies
are part of the unrelenting pursuit of good management. In
practice, especially when times are comfortable, both theory and
practice fall into disuse.
   What awakens both of them is competition, and competiton now is
global rather than regional or national. The route to the
consumer's heart isn't is nationality but price and quality.
   Only the slimmest and trimmest can offer it.

<HEAD>Bold Bid Reaches Dramatic Climax, But Story's Not Over</HEAD>

   The courts turned him down. Wall Street turned
its back on him. So Paramount Chairman Martin Davis scrapped his
$12.2 billion hostile offer for Time, vindicating the media giant's
plan to merge with Warner.
   But the story of Paramount Communications Inc.'s seven-week-long
struggle for Time Inc. did not end last week when Davis dropped his
bid and Time completed its $14 billion tender offer for Warner
Communications Inc.
   The next chapters _ revealing what happens to these three
sprawling entertainment-communications companies _ will unfold
months and years from now.
   Time Chairman J. Richard Munro is both optimistic and cautious
about the future of the company that will be known as Time Warner
Inc.
   ``We've got nothing but healthy businesses,'' he said. ``We've
acquired a company that's on an incredible roll.''
   Nonetheless, Munro's company also has taken on an estimated $13
billion in debt to complete the deal. That will crimp some of Time
Warner's plans.
   ``This is going to make it a little tougher on us,'' Munro said
in a telephone interview. ``We are going to probably not be as
aggressive as we might be without that debt.''
   Time's plans overseas _ which it hoped to expand through the
Warner deal _ could be limited because of the amount of money the
company owes. ``Some of that will take capital we won't have,''
Munro said. ``Some things we would have liked to have done will
take a little longer to get to.''
   After Paramount launched its bid, some observers theorized Davis
did not actually want to acquire Time _ and knew he'd fail _ but
hoped to sabotage Time Warner's competitive advantage.
   Regardless of Davis' motivation, ``he did force Time to acquire
Warner through debt rather than stock,'' said Fred Anschel, an
analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``It does limit Time
Warner's financial flexibility over the next year or two.''
   Paramount's offer forced Time and Warner to transform their
planned stock-swap merger into a $70 a share tender offer by Time
for Warner. The only way Time could pay for Warner's 200 million
shares was to borrow.
   But Munro and Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross, who will co-run
the company, evidently don't expect debt to slow them down too much.
   ``You chew on the debt not by cutting creativity or firing
people, but by growth,'' Munro said.
   First on Time's agenda is to decide the breakdown of cash and
securities it will exchange for the 98 million Warner shares not
purchased in the cash tender offer _ what's known as the ``back
end'' of the merger. The amount of cash involved and how much, if
any, debt securities Time issues will help determine the size of
Time Warner's debt load.
   Time and Warner expect to repay that debt through cash flow, an
accounting term that refers to the money generated by their
business. But while the companies stated in June that no asset
sales were planned as a result of the merger, they sound less
resolute now that they've got a done deal.
   Published reports have said Time and Warner were considering
selling Time's Scott, Foresman book publisher and Warner's cable
television operations.
   Munro said he could not imagine a sale of either business, but
added, ``We really don't know what we're going to do until we get
the back end together and refine the cash flows.''
   ``We would try very hard not to sell assets,'' Munro said.
``We'll know within six months.''
   Some observers doubt whether Ross and Munro, two strong
personalities, will be able to get along sharing the top job.
   ``That will be determined, but we know each other awful well,''
Munro said.
   Both executives negotiated the merger, resolving differences
over two years of talks, and weathered Paramount's assault on their
plans. Munro claimed the pair ``survived that without one harsh
word.''
   Ross has served as a co-chief executive once before. He shared
the top spot at Warner with William Frankel from 1967 until
Frankel's death in 1971.
   ``We're putting together two companies that are so healthy, it
makes it easier,'' Munro said. ``The debt makes it a bit more
difficult, but we really feel that's manageable.''
   Analysts believe the debt will cushion Time Warner from any
hostile bids, at least for a while. But plenty of speculation
remains about what will happen to Paramount, which has an enormous
amount of cash.
   Only a few days after the failed bid for Time, Paramount sold
its financial services business to Ford Motor Co. for $3.35
billion, strengthening its ability to buy other companies.
   ``It's simply a question of who they're going to go after and,
if they don't, who's going to go after them,'' said Anschel, the
Dean Witter analyst.
   Paramount Chairman Davis was undaunted in defeat, although his
aggressive run at Time flopped last week before the highest court
in Delaware, where all three companies are incorporated.
   The three-judge Supreme Court panel upheld a lower court ruling
that affirmed Time's right to pursue its long-sought merger with
Warner and told Paramount it had no business interfering.
   ``We believe in making bold moves when they are in the best
interest of Paramount Communications shareholders,'' Davis stated
after the Supreme Court ruled. ``We have just demonstrated that in
our offer for Time ...''
   Davis said Paramount would continue its expansion plans through
acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures or partnerships. But analysts
have predicted his future targets would be on a smaller scale than
Time.
   The company refused to comment on the possibility that it could
find itself the target of suitor.
   During the seven weeks that Time and Warner fought Paramount,
the stock market was rife with rumors that bidders would emerge for
any or all of the three combatants. Their stock prices gyrated as
the reports came and went, but no bids were announced.
   Still, the failure of Paramount's bid is an interesting study of
how Wall Street itself studies an offer.
   After Paramount announced its bid on June 6, the stock market
bid Time shares up from $126 to a high of $182.75. But professional
speculators and their own lawyers assessed Paramount's chances and
saw that Davis would lose _ and began to dump their Time holdings.
   As the weeks wore on, Time stock spiraled downward, reaching
about $136 as the Supreme Court heard the final arguments in the
case.

<HEAD>Bad Week For American Automakers and the UAW</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Autoworker unionists in Tennessee and automaker
executives in Detroit are finding they have a lot in common: Both
know what it's like to get their snouts snapped by Japan.
   The United Auto Workers union suffered a stunning defeat this
past week at the Nissan Motor Corp. plant in Smyrna, Tenn., where
workers voted 2-to-1 to reject UAW representation despite an
intensive and often bitter union campaign that began in January
1988.
   Not only did the rejection signal a repudiation of the UAW's
``Union Yes'' drive at the 6-year-old plant, but it also was seen
as a sign that American workers are increasingly accepting Japanese
management techniques.
   Nissan's Smyrna workers, who produce light trucks and Sentra
sedans, make the same money as UAW counterparts elsewhere and none
has ever been laid off, making it difficult for the union to find
an effective campaign issue. The UAW blamed the defeat on what it
called Nissan's systematic anti-union rhetoric.
   The vote was big news in Japan, where companies that rely
heavily on sales in the U.S. market, particularly automakers, have
been building more factories in the United States, both to thwart
charges of trade protectionism and to gain a stronger presence in
this country.
   So far, no transplanted Japanese auto factory has been organized
by the UAW, and the Smyrna vote intensified speculation that the
country's largest union will face more trouble plugging the holes
in its declining membership.
   The union wasn't the only one smarting from Japan's influence on
the automaking industry.
   Five hundred miles north of Smyrna in Detroit, two of the Big
Three reported lower second-quarter earnings because of declining
domestic sales, and a third announced a $1 billion cost-cutting
effort, partly the result of aggressive Japanese competition.
   General Motors Corp. said earnings fell 3 percent from a year
earlier to $1.45 billion, and Ford Motor Co. said earnings fell 15
percent to $1.4 billion. Industry analysts said the rebates offered
by the carmakers not only failed to lure enough buyers but eroded
whatever earnings were left.
   Chrysler Corp. which is to report earnings Monday, confronted
perhaps a more serious problem of growing costs, evoking memories
of gloomy days several years ago when the company needed federal
loan guarantees to stay alive.
   The No. 3 automaker's chairman Lee Iacocca, widely credited with
resurrecting Chrysler, told top managers the company was too fat
and they needed to cut 2,300 white-collar workers from the payroll
by yearend.
   A slump in the auto business has been expected for a while, and
many industry analysts foresee drastically lower earnings at the
Big Three over the remainder of 1989 and perhaps 1990. The
automakers themselves have indicated they agree with that
assessment.
   In one telling sign this past week, Ford bought Paramount
Communications Inc.'s profitable financial services business for
$3.35 billion cash. The purchase was seen as part of Ford's attempt
to protect itself from dependence on selling cars to make money.
   Elsewhere in business and economic news this past week:
   _Bigger evidently is better in the drug business. Bristol-Myers
Co. and Squibb Corp. agreed to merge in a stock swap valued at
about $11 billion, creating one of the largest pharmaceutical
companies. The agreement came a day after SmithKline Beckman Corp.
and Britain's Beecham PLC completed their previously announced
merger.
   _Time Inc. completed its merger with Warner Communications Inc.
after Delaware's highest court blocked Paramount Communication's
hostile takeover attempt of Time. The court's decision was seen as
a major victory for corporate directors whose long-term plans may
conflict with the wishes of shareholders.
   _More evidence of a slowing economy emerged, boosting stock and
bond prices. The government said its broadest measure of economic
growth showed a 1.7 percent gain this spring, well below
expectations. Economists said the Federal Reserve, which has taken
steps to ease credit, would likely continue to do so in order to
avert a possible recession.
   _Exxon Corp. said the cost of cleaning the Alaskan oil spill
would exceed $1.25 billion and was responsible for a plunge in its
second-quarter earnings. The disclosure coincided with a five-month
low in the price of oil, which had been driven higher by fears of
shortages that followed the March 24 spill.

   After a long time circling the runway on
dwindling power, the once high-flying economy finally may be
touching down.
   Stock market investors have braced for a possibly difficult
landing by favoring companies that can turn a profit regardless of
economic conditions and dumping ones apt to be bumped around during
impact.
   The economy probably started on its final approach to the runway
during the second quarter when growth eased considerably to a 1.7
percent annual pace.
   Many analysts regarded the report issued this past week on the
gross national product _ the broadest gauge of economic activity _
as a signal that the economy has sufficient power for the
sought-after ``soft landing,'' a period of slow but sustained
growth with falling inflation and interest rates.
   This analysis helped various stock market measures scale to
record heights during the week. On Friday, the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index climbed to 342.15 and the New York Stock Exchange
composite index advanced to 190.38, both all-time highs.
   For all of the week, the market made some impressive progress.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished the week at
2,635.24, just 0.19 point below the post-crash high reached
Thursday, up 27.88 points for the week and just about 87 points shy
of its all time high of 2,722.42 set in August 1987.
   The NYSE composite index rose 3.23 to 190.38; the NASDAQ
composite index for the over-the-counter market added 3.53 to
452.82; and, the American Stock Exchange market value index was up
3.23 at 374.51.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 179.62 million shares a day, up
slightly from 175.90 million a day the previous week.
   One force driving the market onward was evidence that the
Federal Reserve was fluffing the credit cushion to make the
economy's landing more comfortable. The central bank took steps
this past week to loosen short-term interest rates.
   Declining interest rates bode well for the stock and bond
markets, says Greg A. Smith of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
Hundreds of billions of dollars now invested in money market funds
in the United States could go elsewhere if rates continue to fall.
   ``Any further drops in short-term interest rates as the Fed
shifts policy for recession prevention could also unleash a fairly
powerful flow of money into longer-term financial assets such as
stocks and bonds,'' he wrote in a weekly market strategy report.
   A look at recent Wall Street trends indicates investors have
been discriminating in their selections. Stocks of companies with
earnings swings during business cycles, such as automakers, have
performed weakly for some time while more recession-proof
companies, such as foodmakers and consumer product companies, have
fared better.
   ``The market is really penalizing those companies that will be
bothered by a recession,'' says John D. Connolly, of Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   But Connolly says he sees two chief reasons why a sluggish
economic growth won't deteriorate into a serious downturn, with
widespread layoffs and significant income shrinkage.
   Most importantly, he says, the central bank has ample leeway to
lower interest rates without stirring up inflation.
   ``There's no reason why the Fed has to stay tight,'' says
Connolly. ``In prior recessions, the Fed felt it couldn't loosen
because it's job on inflation wasn't working.''
   The second safeguard is that consumers already have made major
progress in replenishing their savings depleted during the longest
economic expansion in the post-World War II era, Connolly contends.
   A government report released Friday showed the personal savings
rate _ savings as a percent of disposable income _ rose to 5.9
percent in June, well above the sub-3-percent rates that prevailed
a few years ago.
   ``Part of the function of a recession is to reliquify the
consumer,'' says Connolly. ``The consumer is already partially
reliquified.''

<HEAD>Bank Lowers Prime Rate to 10{ Percent; Others May Follow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICH CARTIERE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of America is lowering its prime
lending rate to 10{ percent because of its own declining borrowing
costs and further signs of a weakening economy, and analysts say
other banks should quickly follow.
   The move, effective Monday, follows Chase Manhattan Bank, which
dropped its prime on July 10 by the same half percentage point. The
decline was the second in as many months, bringing the prime rate
to the level at which it stood at the start of 1989.
   Analysts said they expected most other major banks to quickly
lower their prime to the same level. Bank of America is the
nation's second-largest bank.
   ``They weren't the first and they won't be the last,'' said
stock analyst J. Richard Fredericks with Montgomery Securities in
San Francisco.
   Bank of America chief economist John Oliver Wilson cited the
falling federal funds rate _ the rate banks charge each other for
overnight loans _ and signs of a slowing economy as the main
reasons for the move, which was announced Friday.
   The prime, a laggard among other interest rates, is a benchmark
banks use to set interest on a variety of consumer and business
credit, including home-equity lines of credit. It also determines
the rate for many credit cards.
   Wilson said the Federal Reserve Board has shown signs of
loosening its grip on the nation's money supply in reaction to a
continued slowdown in economic growth and an easing of inflation.
   Analysts expected most major banks to follow Chase Manhattan's
lead in lowering their prime rate once they were certain the
federal funds rate would remain near or below 9 percent, thereby
confirming the Federal Reserve's policy to depress interest rates.
The rate was 815-16 percent late Friday.
   Reflecting banks' continued dropping costs of funds, the average
yield on six-month certificates of deposit fell to a national
average of 8.47 percent last week, compared with 8.52 percent the
previous week and the 8.8 percent range in late June, according to
the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor.
   In the bond market, another indicator of general interest rate
trends, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond finished at about
7.98 percent Friday, its first close below 8 percent since April 8,
1987.
   Wilson said the bank's second reason for lowering its prime was
the week's economic news ``shows definitely that the economy is
slowing down.''
   A slowdown in the U.S. economy tends to ease the risk of
inflation, thus allowing the Fed to pursue a strategy of reducing
interest rates.
   Wilson cited reports on Friday by the Commerce Department that
personal incomes rose a lackluster 0.3 percent in June as consumer
spending _ which accounts for two-thirds of U.S. economic activity
_ declined for a second straight month. He also cited two months of
negative growth in industrial production.
   ``With this kind of interest rate and economic news across the
board, I'd expect the money center banks and big regional banks to
do the same _ soon,'' said banking analyst Michael Abrahms of
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. in Los Angeles.
