   Retired Lt. Gen. Donald Harry Cowles, an
Army deputy chief of staff during the mid-1970s, died at Alexandria
Hospital. He was 71.
   Cowles, who died Saturday, was a native of Westfield, Mass. He
served in the Army during World War II in Europe, and also served in
West Germany during the Berlin crisis in 1961.
   He held staff posts in Vietnam from 1970 to 1972, and as
headquarters chief of staff of the Military Assistance Command
helped direct the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam.
   He was promoted to lieutenant general in 1972 and was named an
Army deputy chief of staff. He retired in 1975 as deputy chief of
staff for operations and plans.
   After his retirement he joined the BDM Corp., now a division of
the Ford Motor Co., in McLean. He retired as a company vice
president in 1984.

<HEAD>Doctor Prescribes Cocaine For Pain Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Park Avenue doctor who legally dispenses
cocaine as a pain reliever boasts a patient roster that includes
Sonny Bono, comedian David Brenner and celebrity divorce lawyer
Marvin Mitchelson, according to a published report.
   The Daily News reported in its Sunday editions that Dr. Milton
Reder dispenses a form of cocaine for $25 a visit to patients
complaining of pain from back problems, arthritis and other
conditions.
   ``I couldn't walk 14 years ago. This cured me,'' Brenner told the
News. Brenner said he suffers from double scoliosis of the spine, a
herniated disk, sciatica in both legs and a degenerative disease of
the vertebrae.
   Reder, 89, told the News that cocaine is ``the best local
anesthetic there is.'' His unusual treatment, technically known as
sphenopalatine ganglion block, involves the application of a liquid
cocaine solution inside a patient's nose.
   The treatment can render long-term relief from pain, according to
patients and some doctors familiar with the treatment, but medical
experts don't understand why the technique seems to works and some
are skeptical, said the News.
   ``In theory, it's a very plausible technique. We share the
skepticism of many but we feel it is something worth looking into,''
said Dr. David Silverman, a professor of anesthesiology at the Yale
School of Medicine.
   However, the New York County Medical Society said the technique
``has no basis in scientific medicine.''
   The state Health Department last year investigated Reder because
of his large purchases of cocaine from pharmaceutical companies, and
directed him to stop using cocaine, the News said.
   Continued use of the drug, the department stated, ``will be
considered a violation of the controlled substances provision of the
Public Health Law.''
   Reder agreed in writing to stop using cocaine in his treatments,
but several months later he again wrote to the department and said
he planned to resume using the drug.
   The director of the Health Department's Bureau of Controlled
Substances, Thomas Coffey, said officials will meet with the Medical
Society to see if it has changed its view of Reder's treatment. If
not, Coffey told the News the department would purse legal action to
stop Reder.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Bush Ethics Counsel Changes Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's ethics adviser, C. Boyden Gray,
changed his account Saturday of when he learned about a White House
policy on business interests like the large family-owned
communications company he heads, a newspaper reported.
   The New York Times reported in Sunday editions that Gray had said
in two interviews last week that he just learned on Thursday about
the policy, which limits outside business income for White House
employees. But on Saturday Gray said he had learned about the policy
in November from his deputy, John Schmitz.
   The Washington Post reported Saturday that Gray, the White House
counsel, plans to continue as chairman of his family company, Summit
Communications Inc., but will give up the fee he collected during
his eight previous years as vice presidential counsel.
   The Times quoted Gray as saying he had stopped taking fees
effective at the end of last year, and that he would have done so
earlier if he had known about the policy.
   Gray said he learned several weeks ago about a related White
House prohibition from serving on corporate boards, the Times said.
He said that policy was under review, and he would remain on the
board of his family company, according to the Times.
   Gray told the Times he complied with ethics rules by
disqualifying himself from discussing communications issues in the
government. Summit, based in Atlanta, owns 16 radio stations and
cable television outlets, the Times said.
   Gray reported his financial interests in a disclosure statement
six months past a May 15 deadline, a ``nonwillful violation of the
law,'' ethics office director Frank Nebeker told The Times.
   Gray said he had left the filing to others, the Times reported.
Schmitz blamed demands from the presidential campaign and the
55-page length of the report, the newspaper said.
   Asked about a campaign pledge by Bush in July that none of his
aides would accept outside earned income, Gray said he was unaware
of it because he was not involved in the campaign, the Times said.
The Reagan White House had a similar policy, although Gray, as a
vice presidential aide, was not technically covered by it.

   The arctic cold wave that shocked even Alaska moved far enough
south to chill Mardi Gras revelers Saturday, while blowing snow and
temperatures as low as 50 degrees below zero hampered travel in the
northern Rockies and Plains.
   A truck exploded in Oregon as a man tried to thaw the vehicle's
locks with a propane torch; there was too much snow for a major ski
competition in Colorado; a group of travelers had to be rescued from
a snowbank by a freight train in Wyoming; and a small Idaho town was
isolated by drifting snow.
   The Northwest's giant Bonneville Power Administration, which
normally has electricity to spare, sought power and water from
elsewhere to meet demand for heat. Texas worried that its natural
gas wells couldn't keep up with demand.
   Three people were injured, two seriously, in the truck explosion.
The blast demolished the truck, damaged a nearby house, blew out
windows over a two-block area and spread tools over a half-block,
Woodburn, Ore., police dispatcher Ann Flowers said.
   The propane torch apparently set off propane leaking from a
heater inside the truck, said Woodburn Fire Chief Keith Woodley.
   The man using the torch, Scott Grasti, was listed in serious
condition Saturday evening. His wife, Bonnie Grasti, was treated for
facial cuts and released from a hospital. Another man, whose name
wasn't released, was hospitalized with second-degree burns to his
face.
   In St. Paul, high school bands marching in a winter carnival
parade that was curtailed by subzero cold faked their routines
before TV cameras as loudspeakers played taped band music. Still,
about 25,000 people lined the parade route.
   ``The players will have the instruments in their mouths in
playing position. But we put athletic tape on the mouthpieces so the
cold metal doesn't stick to their skin,'' said Don Glassel, band
director at Simley High School in Inver Grove Heights, Minn.
   The frigid air that built up over Alaska and pushed into the
Lower 48 states Tuesday brought below-zero wind chill factors to
normally balmy southern Texas and freezing rain to the Texas Gulf
Coast and New York City.
   At least 25 deaths around the nation were blamed on the cold
front, including four in sledding accidents and two who apparently
froze to death in Oklahoma City.
   ``I wonder why we live in Minnesota,'' said Gloria Ball, manager
of a Rockford, Minn., mobile home park that lost gas service Friday
as temperatures dipped to as low as 42 below zero.
   Record lows for the date Saturday included 7 degrees at Seattle;
33 below zero at Great Falls, Mont.; 29 below at Duluth, Minn., and
22 below at Billings, Mont. Records also fell as far south as Texas,
with a low of 4 at Lubbock, 16 at Wichita Falls and 23 at Houston,
while Midland tied its record of 9 degrees.
   But the coldest official reading in the Lower 48 states was 50
below zero at Wisdom, Mont., the weather service said, followed by
44 below at Butte, Mont. By constrast, Anchorage, Alaska, had a low
of 12 below zero.
   In New Orleans, thousands of Mardi Gras party-goers bundled up
Saturday against a suddenly cold Carnival weekend. Saturday
afternoon's temperature hit the mid 40s, with light rain, but the
forecast for Sunday was for a high in the 30s. Many people ducked
into bars along a parade route Saturday.
   ``They're here anyway and they're going to go drinking,'' said
Matt Hendricks at Fat Harry's. ``Instead of standing outside, it
just gets packed inside. The cold weather makes no difference.''
   Some, though, embraced the cold. In Perry, Iowa, nearly 300
bicycle riders braved blowing snow and a wind chill factor of minus
40 to take part in the 12th annual, 23-mile B-R-R Ride. Several
dropped out and most riders wore three and four layers of clothing,
hats, gloves and face masks to try to stay warm.
   A foot of snow fell overnight Friday at Alta, Utah, bringing the
ski resort's total since late Wednesday to 49 inches. Seven inches
fell within three hours in Cedar City, Utah. Some highways in
northern Utah were blocked by snowdrifts.
   Snow fell at an inch an hour in parts of California's Sierra
Nevada. Up to 4 feet of snow fell in the Lake Tahoe area and Norden
at Donner Summit got 40 inches of snow over two days, officials
said. Interstate 80 through the Sierra was reopened Friday night
after being closed more than a day by blowing snow, but some other
highways remained closed by snow.
   ``Basically, it's a real mess out there,'' said California
Highway Patrol dispatcher Gina Moran at Truckee. ``They're crashing
everywhere ... . It's snowing like crazy and they're still coming up
here. They still refuse to believe they shouldn't come.''
   At Beaver Creek, Colo., the premier event of the World Alpine Ski
Championships, the men's downhill, was canceled Saturday because
more than 8 inches of snow made it impossible for crews to groom the
course in time.
   Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus declared a state of emergency Saturday in
Bonner County, where high wind Wednesday toppled hundreds of trees
and left hundreds of people without electricity. The Bonner County
Commission requested the declaration after utilities reported power
might not be restored until Monday.
   Four people driving from Laramie, Wyo., to Fort Collins, Colo.,
were rescued from a snowbank Saturday by a Union Pacific Railroad
freight crew, who put them aboard their locomotive near Tie Siding,
Wyo.
   Fourteen inches of fresh snow were on the ground and the wind
chill factor was minus 76 degrees. While the Highway Patrol was
alerted, a snowplow couldn't reach the travelers, said UP spokesman
John Bromley in Omaha, Neb. ``Apparently the car was running, but
they (engineers) were afraid to leave them if the car ran out of
gas,'' he said.
   The Colorado highway patrol closed southbound Interstate 25 in
Denver because there were so many accidents in whiteout conditions.
   Most of 200 travelers stalled in the Idaho town of Dubois when
the cold front hit Wednesday made it out in two caravans on Thursday
and Friday, but the town was shut and isolated Saturday by 25 below
zero cold, 40 mph wind, near zero visibility and drifting snow.
   ``Everything's closed off. We can't use our main streets or
nothing,'' said Ed Russell, a county road foreman. ``We're trying to
get our equipment started, but it's so cold, nothing is starting for
us. It's pretty serious.''
   The Bonneville Power Administration cut back power deliveries
Friday by about 25 percent to 10 Northwest aluminum smelters because
of high residential demand, spokesman Bob Reed said.
   The BPA, which normally sells surplus power from its huge
Columbia River hydroelectric dams, was trying to buy electricity
from California utilities to meet demand, and British Columbia Hydro
agreed to release more water upstream to help generate power, Reed
said.
   Texas may face a natural gas shortage if the severe cold
continues past Monday, said Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Kent
Hance.
   ``The gas wells simply will not be able to deliver all the gas we
need, and the storage facilities may not be able to supply more than
half of the gas volumes they did in 1983,'' when Texas nearly ran
out of natural gas, Hance said.

<HEAD>American Goes to Cambodia to Seek Remains of Slain Brother</HEAD>

   One of the last to die in Cambodia's
killing fields was Michael Scott Deeds _ an American yachtsman
tortured and executed in a grisly extermination center just as a
Vietnamese invasion force was ending the brutal rule of the Khmer
Rouge.
   Ten years later, Michael's brother, Karl, hopes to travel to the
execution site in Phnom Penh and recover his remains.
   ``I just don't want him to lie where he was tortured and killed.
He deserves a lot better than that,'' Deeds said in an interview.
``He was a real good guy, a great guy.''
   Michael, then 29 years old, and another American, Christopher
Edward Delance, were seized by the Khmer Rouge while sailing off the
Cambodian coast in late 1978. According to captured records, the two
were taken to Tuol Sleng prison, where they were interrogated and
confessed to being CIA agents.
   They were executed sometime after they signed confessions Jan. 5,
1979. Two days later, Vietnamese troops captured Phnom Penh and
found unburied corpses and bloodstained torture instruments at Tuol
Sleng.
   Deeds, of Seal Beach, Calif., tried to contact the Cambodian
government in 1980 and 1981 and also attempted to get U.N. help in
repatriating the remains of his brother, but he was unsuccessful.
   More recently, he read news reports quoting Cambodian Ung Pech,
among only four Tuol Sleng survivors, that one or possibly two
executed Americans were buried in the Tuol Sleng compound rather
than being dumped into mass graves in the Phnom Penh area.
   This, he said, gave him hope the remains could be located, and he
made successful contact with Vietnamese authorities. Deeds, a
communications and television production specialist, is scheduled to
fly to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam on Tuesday and obtain a visa to
Cambodia.
   Deeds said he also has heard unconfirmed reports that a
Vietnamese doctor searching for his own brother in Cambodia has
uncovered the remains of some foreigners in a mass grave in Phnom
Penh.
   To help identification, Deeds is carrying Michael's dental
records and a cast of his teeth reconstructed by the family dentist.
Michael's parents and two other brothers also live in California.
   The Phnom Penh government says 20,000 people died at Tuol Sleng,
including a small number of foreigners, mostly captured offshore.
These included six Americans, three French nationals and two
Australians.
   The one-time high school was converted to an interrogation and
execution center during the Khmer Rouge era. It is now a museum, the
walls of which are covered with thousands of photographs the Khmer
Rouge took of their prisoners before killing them.
   Deeds said he was serving with the U.S. Navy in the Philippines
when news of his brother's death arrived from Cambodia.
   He took a leave and tried to reconstruct his brother's voyages in
Southeast Asian waters aboard a 42-foot sloop called the Iwalani,
which Michael originally had helped sail from Hawaii.
   He found that Michael and his companion had sailed from Singapore
and were seized near the Cambodian port of Kompong Som.
   Deeds says he doesn't know the full story of Michael's activities
in Southeast Asia but is skeptical that his brother worked for the
CIA _ a charge the Khmer Rouge commonly leveled against suspected
enemies.

   Israeli leaders, faced with a changed political
equation in the wake of PLO Chief Yasser Arafat's more moderate
stance, have offered ``new'' peace plans that Palestinians first
rejected more than 10 years ago.
   The reason for dressing up old ideas is that Israel finds itself
confronting not one, but several dilemmas.
   First, Israel's army seems incapable of ending the Palestinian
uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the
government does not want to concede the revolt's goal: an
independent Palestinian state.
   Second, the rebellion, along with Arafat's declaration that he
recognizes Israel and renounces terrorism, has aroused sympathy from
many abroad and is distancing Israel from allies whose good will any
small nation needs. This is putting pressure on Israel to come up
with some sort of peace initiative.
   Third, short of independence, there seems to be very little new
in the way of peace plans that have not already been raised _ and
sunk _ since Israel took control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in
the 1967 Six-Day War.
   The Rogers plan of 1969, the Begin plan of 1977, the Camp David
accords of 1978, the Reagan plan of 1982, the Shultz plan of 1988
all have been rejected by one side, the other, or both.
   David Bar-Ilan, an Israeli political analyst, outlined Israel's
``unenviable position'' at a conference of political scientists and
former government officials here last week.
   ``Unless (Israel) finds ways to quell the intefadeh ... it will
be reduced to choosing between two evils: maintaining the status quo
and inviting political and diplomatic isolation; or withdrawing to
the '67 lines and allowing a Palestinian state to rise on the
outskirts of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem,'' he said.
   Against this background, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin both recently floated suggestions
that center on granting autonomy, or limited self-rule, to the 1.7
million Palestinians in the occupied lands.
   Rabin called for election of local representatives, then
autonomy, and finally negotiations for a final settlement of the
status of the territories, either in a confederation with Jordan or
with Israel.
   Shamir, for the first time directly, said he would be willing to
pull out Israeli troops from some cities in the occupied lands if
Palestinians would accept autonomy. The end result also would be
talks about the final status of the West Bank and Gaza.
   While elections and autonomy sound like fine ideas at first
blush, they are not new. Both were brought up in former Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin's peace plan of 1977 and the
U.S.-sponsored Camp David accords the following year. The plan for
troop withdrawals from Palestinian cities also comes from Camp David.
   The Palestinians were not party to the accords and rejected its
suggestions for autonomy and elections for what they consider good
reasons.
   Elections would be for Palestinian representatives in the
territories to negotiate with Israel for a solution. This cuts out
the Palestine Liberation Organization, which most Palestinians
consider their best representative.
   Letting Palestinians run local affairs while Israel keeps control
of security means settling for much less than the Palestinians want:
their own country. The word ``autonomy'' also has a bad taste for
Palestinians from the way Begin introduced it.
   He said that under autonomy, the Israeli army would remain
stationed in the West Bank and Gaza. ``We have a right and a demand
for sovereignty over these areas of the land of Israel. This is our
land and it belongs to the Jewish nation rightfully,'' Begin said.
   While Shamir and Rabin both said they revived such aged ideas in
hopes of unsticking the peace process, others say the moves really
were intended to remove the tarnish that the uprising and Arafat's
new diplomacy have put on Israel's public image.
   Yehuda Litani, Middle East editor of the Jerusalem Post, labeled
the latest Israeli efforts, including meetings by Rabin aides with
local Palestinian leaders, ``shadowboxing and smoke screens.''
   ``The idea is to create the impression among the Americans and
perhaps also the West Europeans that Israel is genuinely interested
in finding an interlocutor who can ... achieve agreements acceptable
to the Palestinian leadership abroad,'' Litani wrote.
   He added: ``The sad fact, however, is that Israel is unable and
undoubtedly also unwilling to make far-reaching concessions at this
stage.''

   Pope John Paul II called Sunday for a ``new
culture of solidarity'' that would protect the sick and elderly and
outlaw abortion.
   In his noon ``Angelus'' address from his window overlooking St.
Peter's Square, the pope noted that Italy's Roman Catholic Church on
Sunday was observing the ``Day of Life.''
   Cardinal Ugo Poletti, head of the Italian bishops' conference,
led a march of 3,000 people from Rome's Sant' Andrea delle Valle
Church to St. Peter's. The group carried signs with slogans such as
``Yes to Life.''
   John Paul said he hoped the initiative would increase ``the
common awareness and responsibility in one of the most dramatic
problems of our time.''
   ``The future of man is threatened, in some countries, by the
decline of births, by the aging of the population, by the widespread
recourse to abortion, by the thousands of forms of egoism,'' the
pope told the crowd of 15,000 people gathered in the square.
   ``A new culture of solidarity is needed,'' he added. ``The life
of each person, including the one waiting to be born, the one sick
or weak, the one in decline, is an absolute and intangible gift. It
is a gift of all and for all.''

<HEAD>Fourth Game In Timman-Portisch Match Ends In Draw</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANTWERP, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grandmasters Jan Timman of the
Netherlands and Lajos Portisch of Hungary agreed to a draw without
resuming play Sunday in the adjourned fourth game of their World
Chess Championship Candidates quarterfinal.
   The bishops and pawns ending had been declared a certain point
splitter by ``chessperts'' when Portisch sealed his 62nd move after
an exciting six-hour battle from a Ruy Lopez the day before.
   But Timman, who was playing white, painstakingly analyzed the
position overnight with his seconds in the hope of getting more out
of the game than the half point earned by a draw.
   Late Sunday morning, he called up his opponent in the Antwerp
hotel, where the match is being played, to propose signing the peace.
   Portisch, now leading 2{-1{ in the six-game, knock-out match,
accepted and informed Yugoslav referee Svetozar Gligoric of the
outcome.
   The draw meant a serious setback for the 37-year-old Timman, who
desperately needed a victory to catch up with the 51-year-old
Hungarian.
   With only two more games to go in the match, his chances of
gaining a berth in the semifinals seemed slim.
   A win in Monday's fifth game, in which Timman will be playing
with black, was considered unlikely by the experts following the
Antwerp duel.
   ``Portisch will be satisfied with a draw,'' explained Dutch
grandmaster Genna Sosonko, ``and he's such an able defender that
Timman would be taking a great risk indeed if he tries to win with
black. The match might be over at once.''
   According to Sosonko, Timman will wait for the sixth game,
scheduled for Wednesday, to try and tie the score.
   If he then manages a win with white, the match will be extended
with two more games, to be followed by sudden-death rapid contests
if the tie persists.
   The Antwerp match is one of a series to select a challenger who
will play world champion Gary Kasparov for his title in 1990.
   On Saturday, Arthur Yusupov of the Soviet Union defeated Canada's
Kevin Spraggett in their first rapid game in Quebec to reach the
semifinals, while former Soviet world champion Anatoly Karpov was
well on his way to a victory over Johann Hjartarson of Iceland in
their quarterfinal contest in Seattle.
   Jonathan Speelman qualified for the semifinals by defeating
fellow British grandmaster Nigel Short in August.

<HEAD>Photos of Hess' Body Suggest Murder, Paper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Photographs of the body of Rudolf Hess suggest
Adolf Hitler's 93-year-old deputy may have been murdered at Spandau
Prison in West Berlin in 1987, the Sunday Observer newspaper
reported.
   The liberal weekly said it studied the pictures, which were
brought to London by Hess' son, Wolf Rudiger Hess. Hess met Friday
with Scotland Yard detectives investigating suggestions his father
did not commit suicide, said the paper.
   The photographs were part of a post-mortem report by Wolfgang
Spann of Munich, who suggested the Nazi leader died as a result of
``deliberate strangulation rather than hanging,'' the paper said.
The first post-mortem, by James Cameron of London University, said
Hess' death was a suicide by hanging.
   Dr. Hugh Thomas, a former British army doctor who examined the
Spandau prisoner in 1973, was quoted as telling the Observer the
photographs from Spann's examination show Hess was murdered.
   ``If a person hangs to death, you would expect that the line of
the cord would run diagonally across the back of his neck. But the
photographs of Hess show a mark straight across. The line also
continues around the front of the neck, suggesting he was killed by
strangulation rather than hanging,'' Thomas was quoted as saying.
   In two books, Thomas has contended Hess was murdered in 1941
while flying to Scotland on a peace mission and an impersonator in a
second plane was substituted by plotters among Hitler's deputies.
   Thomas claims the imposter spent 46 years in Hess' place at
Spandau and alleges he was murdered in 1987 to stop the leak of
details of a World War II plot by powerful Britons to overthrow
Prime Minister Winston Churchill.
   Wolf Rudiger Hess maintains the Spandau prisoner was his father
and that he probably was murdered on Aug. 17, 1987, because of
Allied fears he might disclose secrets about his flight to Scotland
in 1941.
   In a statement Saturday, Scotland Yard would not disclose who it
has interviewed for its investigation into Hess' death, which is
being conducted at the request of the director of public
prosecutions.
   At the Nuremberg war crimes trials, Hess was sentenced to life
imprisonment with no possibility of parole for ``preparing and
waging an aggressive war.''

<HEAD>Khamenei Says U.S.-Iran Ties Blocked by Hostility</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian President Ali Khamenei said Sunday
that diplomatic relations with Washington will not be possible until
the United States abandons its hostile posture toward Iran, Tehran
radio said.
   ``There can be no change in our stance against America, unless
there is a change in American foreign policy toward Iran,'' the
official broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Khamenei as saying.
   ``What forces us into our present stance against the United
States is its hostile and extremely conspiratorial behavior toward
the Islamic Republic and the revolution ...
   ``What can cause change in the present situation is surely a
change in this hostile attitude, and a change in America's policy of
domination,'' Khamenei said.
   After virtually isolating itself from the international community
during the Iran-Iraq war, Tehran has been opening doors to both East
and West bloc countries since the Aug. 20 cease-fire.
   But anti-Americanism still is a cornerstone of Tehran's foreign
policy.
   Khamenei also condemned Israeli actions in the occupied
territories and South Africa's policy of race segregation. He said
Iran would not establish ties with either of those countries.
   The United States severed ties with Iran soon after the 1979
revolution when fundamentalist militants took over the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran. They held 52 Americans hostage 444 days.

<HEAD>Letters To Science Writers Provide `Ideas Galileo Never Thought Of'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Why do poison toads attend a frog orgy? Are
you aware there is irrefutable evidence of intelligent life on Mars?
And if the moon takes a month to revolve around Earth, why is it
seen over Detroit every night?
   Those strange questions _ and a bizarre variety of theories _
were contained in several dozen letters received by the nation's
science writers and entered in a contest of ``Ideas Galileo Never
Thought Of.''
   The Northern California Science Writers Association sponsored the
contest last month during the annual meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science, held in San Francisco.
   Science writer James Cornell, publications manager at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.,
swept first, second and third places with letters that landed on his
desk.
   The winning entry came from a Cambridge woman befuddled by news
of mass mating rituals amongs frogs in Malaysia.
   ``What I have been wondering is whether all those different kinds
of frogs managed to find their own kind of frog to mate with, what
with the crowds and confusion and all; or whether they got all mixed
up, which would mean that by now we are faced with the spectre of
ever new varieties of weirdo frogs,'' she wrote.
   ``Also, what were the poisonous toads doing there? They're not
frogs, after all, and why should they even bother showing up at a
frog orgy, just because they happen to be amphibious and hop?''
   Detroit Free Press science writer Nancy Ross-Flanigan got an
ungrammatical letter from a man who didn't know Earth rotates as the
moon orbits it.
   ``The moon is supposed to travel around the Earth in a month
time. Then what is this moon that revolve around the city of Detroit
every day to every other day? And what is it doing?'' he asked.
   In another letter to Cornell, a Cincinnati man asserted his
12-year study of Mars photographs ``resulted in irrefutable evidence
of a civilized society of intelligent beings on the red planet.''
   Cornell said the writers of such letters ``are harmless. They
just have a skewed view of what the world is. I wouldn't want anyone
to make fun of them. ... They are simply attempting to establish
their own version of scientific reality.''
   Charlie Petit, a San Francisco Chronicle science writer and
president of the National Association of Science Writers, got a
letter from a man who theorized continents formed and life on Earth
started when a moon named ``Yasoon'' hit the planet.
   Such correspondents mean to be serious, and while their ideas
``may be silly and funny, I would never regard the people who think
of them as ridiculous,'' Petit said. ``I tip my hat to them for
daring to say things that elicit giggles. I would not want to be a
member of a society where nobody came up with crazy ideas.''
   Some offer more than ideas.
   ``I am willing to ... have one of my hands amputated and
scientifically demonstrate how Regenerative Medicine Works. As a
result, a new hand will grow back,'' said a Brazilian man's letter
to a scientist at the University of California, Irvine.
   The scientist forwarded the letter to free-lancer Lynne Timpani
Friedmann, then a university spokeswoman, with a note saying,
``Please add this to the whacko file.''
   The contest's second-place letter, written by a Texas man, began:
``Dear Sir: It is generally believed by scientists that the Earth is
a giant magnet, but this is not quite true. ... The Earth is, in
reality, a GIANT Photoelectric Cell.''
   In third place, from South Carolina, was this complete letter:
``Dear Presidents, Directors and Other Communications Coordinators,
Global abstinence from March 15 through April 15, combined with
curative measures, as needed, can virtually eradicate gonorrhea, and
much more. How many months have 11 days?''
   Among other contest entries:
   _A letter to Petit outlined a new theory on ``The Nature and
Treatment of Stupidity _ Diagnosis and Prognosis.'' It began:
``Human beings (deceitful neurotic talking predators) are uniquely
stupid organisms because they are talking organisms.''
   _A Connecticut man's letter to Scientific American magazine
contended the universe didn't start with the ``big bang,'' but with
a ``big knock.''
   _A Miami Beach man's letter to Cornell claimed credit for being
the genius who ``suggested that spare tires be narrow so they would
occupy less trunk space,'' ``suggested a method for curing mental
disease with electronics,'' and ``presented some evidence that black
holes do not exist.''
   _One man's letter detailed a ``formula for THE NATURE AND NATURAL
ORDER OF THE UNIVERSE.'' His simple theory: ``What must be, must be,
and what cannot be, cannot be. Such is Mother Nature's way of
informing mankind of right and wrong.''

<HEAD>Thatcher Revolution Reaches Cherished Free Health System</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With plans for sweeping changes in Britain's free
health system, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's free-market
revolution has reached a national institution as sacrosanct as the
royal family.
   After years of increasing spending on an ever-more costly ideal
of free and equal treatment for all 56 million Britons, Mrs.
Thatcher last week announced the most radical shake-up of the
National Health Service since its foundation 40 years ago.
   The health service will remain free to the customers. But the
prime minister's plan is to create an ``internal market'' in state
medicine by 1991, with a price on everything from aspirin to a heart
transplant. Doctors and hospitals will compete for state-funded fees.
   The 320 biggest hospitals will be able to become self-governing,
setting individual pay scales and wooing private and state patients.
Patients over the age of 60, the biggest burden on the state health
service, will get tax breaks for having private insurance.
   ``The National Health Service will continue to be available to
all, regardless of income, and to be financed mainly out of general
taxation,'' said Mrs. Thatcher. ``We aim to extend patient choice
... and to secure the best value for money.''
   The system Mrs. Thatcher envisions is a far cry from the mainly
private U.S. system, widely perceived in Britain as a recipe for
greed and wastefulness and one that dumps the poor and chronically
ill in substandard public hospitals.
   But critics on the left charge her proposals are the first step
down a favorite Thatcher road: privatization.
   In the nearly 10 years since Mrs. Thatcher won power, her
front-line targets have been the bureaucracies and the vested
interests of the left. She has sought to emasculate labor unions,
sell off state-owned industries and curb the powers of left-wing
local authorities.
   Through it all, the National Health Service, with one million
employees treating 30 million people a year, kept growing. The cost
has soared by a third to $37.8 billion since 1979 _ always trailing
demands for ever-more expensive drugs and sophisticated surgery.
   Every working Briton has to pay 10 percent of his salary toward
the state health and pension plan, and 90 percent of the people _
not including Mrs. Thatcher _ use the state service as opposed to
private doctors and hospitals.
   Most Britons suspect Mrs. Thatcher would like to dismantle the
system, the cornerstone of the welfare state.
   The prime minister ordered the review of the health system a year
ago in an effort to break the cycle of spending money and earning
political criticism from a service in which children die waiting for
heart surgery and nurses are driven to pay strikes.
   The new proposals are virtually certain of implementation because
of Mrs. Thatcher's big majority in Parliament.
   The opposition Labor Party said the plan reflects a Conservative
Party government that ``will always put a healthy balance sheet
before healthy patients.''
   The country's major health union calls it a ``charter ... (for) a
commercial circus,'' and the doctors' organization, the British
Medical Association, also expressed doubts.
   The government says the plan will increase efficiency and cut
waiting lists.
   ``I don't want the health service run as a business,'' argued
Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke, on a nationwide tour to sell the
plan. ``I just want it to be more businesslike.''
   This means taking a closer look at the performances of family
doctors and consultants.
   Consultants, who get about $87,500 a year from the health
service, will be monitored on whether they are neglecting state
commitments to treat private patients.
   Salaries of the 32,500 state-employed general practitioners, now
earning an average $47,000 a year more or less irrespective of
competence, will be more closely related to the number of patients
on their books.
   Big practices will get budgets to buy hospital treatment at the
best price. Doctors will be fined for prescribing drugs too readily.
   Self-governing hospitals will be forced to run emergency services
and general practitioners will get extra payments for taking on
costly and difficult patients.
   After generations of socialized medicine, many are uneasy about
the new emphasis on money and costs.
   Some critics predict a rush for the glamorous or high-paying
work, with no takers for AIDS patients or the very old. Others fear
doctors may come to be seen as too concerned with money.
   ``At the moment, if we tell a patient they don't need an
antibiotic or an X-ray, they know we are doing it in their own
interests,'' said Dr. Robert Lorge, a country doctor in Hampshire in
southern England.
   ``But if they think we are trying to boost our income by saving
on our budget, it could subtly alter the whole way we are viewed by
our patients.''

   A politician opposed to the Sikh
separatist movement was shot and killed along with an associate
Sunday after making a speech calling for an end to violence in
Punjab state, police said.
   Rajender Kaur, 56, president of the women's wing of a Sikh
political party, and her colleague were attacked by suspected Sikh
militants as they left a Sikh school that was celebrating its golden
jubilee, police said.
   Both died instantly, according to R.S. Gill, the police chief in
the town of Bhatinda, 120 miles southwest of Chandigarh. He said the
assailants fired as Mrs. Kaur was getting into her car outside
Khalsa School in Bhatinda.
   The attackers fled on foot, Gill said in a telephone interview.
   Mrs. Kaur was the president of the Istri Akali Dal, the women's
wing of the Sikh Akali Dal Party, and a former member of Parliament.
She was opposed to the Sikh militant movement for an independent
homeland in Punjab and spoke against increasing violence at the
school function, Gill said.
   Her associate was identified as Baldev Singh.
   Sikh militants have been blamed for at least 200 killings in the
state this year. Last year, at least 2,400 people were killed in the
state.
   The United News of India news agency said at least six people
were killed in Punjab on Saturday. The militants usually target
members of the majority Hindu community and moderate Sikhs who
oppose their separatist campaign.
   Sikhs form 2 percent of India's 880 million people but are in a
majority in northern Punjab.
   The militants claim Sikhs are discriminated against by the
majority Hindu community, which makes up 80 percent of the country's
population.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high-minded mayoral campaign in the city where
politicians often travel the low road once seemed as likely as a
January without snow or ice. But Chicagoans are basking in the balmy
political clime.
   ``Things have been so quiet that I got back from a vacation,
looked at the papers, and thought maybe the plane had landed in
Minneapolis,'' said Mike Royko, the Chicago Tribune's Pulitzer
Prize-winning columnist.
   With three weeks remaining before the Feb. 28 Democratic primary,
political analysts attribute the relative calm to the personalities
involved: acting Mayor Eugene Sawyer, 54, and front-runner Richard
M. Daley, 44, the Cook County state's attorney and son of the late
Mayor Richard J. Daley. A third candidate, Alderman Lawrence Bloom,
is not considered a factor in the primary race.
   In this heavily Democratic city, the winner of the primary is
nearly assured of victory. The general election is April 4.
   All has not been sweetness and light between Sawyer, who is
black, and Daley, who is white.
   Sawyer has tried on occasion to stir up the bad memories some
blacks have of Daley's father because of the riots that followed the
assassination in 1968 of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. More
recently he charged that Daley covered up the involvement of those
in his office who may have collected bogus petition signatures.
   Daley, in turn, has accused Sawyer of trying to tax his way out
of a financial bind and suggested his opponent has accomplished
little on his own since being installed as mayor by the City Council
in December 1987, shortly after Mayor Harold Washington died.
   But neither side has resorted to the mudslinging or the politics
of race that marked both the 1983 campaign that culminated in
Washington's election as the city's first black mayor and
Washington's successful 1987 re-election campaign.
   The issues _ chiefly crime, education and affordable housing _
have received a more thorough airing than during any of the previous
elections this decade.
   The civility might seem especially surprising in light of recent
polls showing Daley with a commanding lead. Support for the county's
top prosecutor has been hovering at about 50 percent against about
30 percent for Sawyer, 10 percent for Bloom and 10 percent undecided.
   The same polls have shown Daley with support from as much as 15
percent to 20 percent of the black electorate, athough the
endorsement of Sawyer by Jesse Jackson on Jan. 24 may result in some
slippage.
   Chicago's population is roughly 40 percent white, 40 percent
black, 15 percent Hispanic and less than 5 percent people of other
races.
   Political observers say the agreeable natures of both candidates
are not the only reason for the calm.
   ``The mud just doesn't seem to be sticking,'' said Eugene
Kennedy, a Loyola University professor and author of ``Himself,'' a
biography of the elder Daley, the last of the big-city political
bosses.
   ``Maybe it's because people are worn out by the spate of
political campaigns over the last two years, or because both men
have their base constituencies intact ... and are down to fighting
for the mostly liberal swing vote, who like `nice, clean' candidates.
   ``But what I would call an almost unnatural calm is, quite
frankly, probably more the result of two men running who are neither
exciting nor willing, nor perhaps even able, to engage the voters'
imagination,'' Kennedy concluded. ``They're even scared of debating
one another.''
   A debate Tuesday is the only one scheduled between Daley and
Sawyer. The two have sparred over the terms of other proposed
debates.
   Clarence Page, a member of the Tribune's editorial board and
frequent political commentator, said another element contributing to
the peaceful campaign is the city's ``newfound political maturity.''
   ``For one thing, politics here were retarded for years because we
had a political machine under (the elder) Daley that for decades
stunted people's aspirations, especially in the minority
communities,'' Page said.
   ``Harold Washington sort of ushered us beyond that. He showed
whites there was no reason to fear a black mayor. He showed blacks
the political process was a legitimate channel to gain power.''
   But just as the weather took a turn for the worse last week,
Royko, Kennedy and Page agree that the campaign could, too, if
Sawyer panics and thinks he's too far behind, or Daley decides he's
not far enough ahead.
   All three also say a Daley win in the primary could cause blacks
to adopt more desperate measures when Alderman Tim Evans, who is
black and like Sawyer was part of the late Mayor Washington's
coalition, makes his third-party challenge in the general election.
   ``But when you consider we've got this far and everybody's been
as a nice as they are,'' Page said, ``that's already quite an
accomplishment.''

<HEAD>Constituent Mail Strongly Opposes Congressional Pay Raise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE ASSEO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 50 percent pay raise for Congress? The folks
back home aren't mincing words in letting congressmen know they
think it's a terrible idea.
   ``Don't you dare let the salary increase go through,'' said a
telegram to Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who opposes the raise.
Another letter-writer said the issue ``has my hair on fire.''
   ``Can't Congress do the same as ordinary people do?'' asked a
letter to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who also voted against the
raise on Thursday. ``Tighten their belts, spend less on luxuries and
pleasures and still enjoy life,'' the writer advised.
   ``I have never received such vicious mail,'' said Rep. Bill
Richardson, D-N.M. He said constituents were promising to vote
against him even if the pay raise took effect over his objections.
   Ed Senn, an aide to Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, a leading opponent of
the pay increase, said the letters were pouring in.
   ``If you stack them up they would be knee-deep,'' Senn said,
adding that the letters differ from the form letters congressmen
typically get when they are considering tax and banking issues.
``This is different because it's not preprinted post cards. It's the
heartfelt, handwritten letters.''
   The raise in lawmakers' pay to $135,000 from the current $89,500
will automatically take effect next Wednesday unless the House
follows the Senate's lead in rejecting it. House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, hopes both houses will roll the raise back to 30 percent
the next day, but some congressmen have said they would rather work
to repeal it altogether.
   Some of the constituent letters are as simple as President Bush's
promise not to raise taxes: ``Read my lips! No 50 percent pay
raise,'' said one note to Humphrey. Another said, ``Just say no to
pay raise. The thought of it is ridiculous.''
   ``The taxpayer is rightfully enraged,'' one Arizonan wrote to
McCain. An elderly person wrote, ``I have worked, scrapped and saved
all my life, the good old American way. Or so we've been told.''
   And, one letter-writer urged congressmen to ``show some backbone.
Display the courage that you all claimed you had during the
campaign.''
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said he realizes much of his mail
opposes his stand in favor of the raise. Dodd wants to ban honoraria
and raise the salary to $125,300, which is the total of the current
$89,500 pay and the maximum amount of honoraria senators now may
accept for making speeches.
   ``No one likes to be against your constituency or appear to be
against your constituents,'' Dodd said. ``But I happen to believe
that you should be honest and straightforward and vote for these
things.''
   Many people do not understand that senators now supplement their
pay by accepting honoraria from special-interest groups, Dodd said,
adding that he tries to explain to them he prefers that congressmen
get a straight salary instead of taking money from those groups.
   Humphrey spokeswoman Lisa Lyons said the pay raise mail is not
the heaviest her office has received on a single subject. The
controversy over former President Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork
to the Supreme Court brought in many more letters, she said.
   One New Hampshire resident wrote a five-stanza poem to Humphrey
that included this gem: ``While you work hard to save a dime, so
some can feel carefree. The deficit is another thing, to worry you
and me.''
   Tauke said his mail included only a few backing a pay raise, but
they came from ``good friends who want me to have a raise. Be kind
to your child,'' he said the letters advised him.

   The bitter cold that staggered Alaska and then
headed south, ending five weeks of unusually warm weather in the
northernmost state, is just the latest in a series of unusual
weather events that have marked the past year.
   Take, for example, the heat and drought that battered much of the
nation last summer. That helped maintain a pattern of weather
disasters in this country every 50 years.
   Great blizzards staggered both the Great Plains and the Northeast
a century ago in 1888, while the ``Long Island Express,'' one of the
worst hurricanes to batter the Northeast, struck in 1938.
   Of course, there have been plenty of weather-related disasters in
other years too.
   A look back at 1988 does show that the United States wasn't alone
in facing odd weather during the year. Problems from heat to cold to
drought to excessive moisture were felt around the world.
   Were these events, known to meteorologists as weather anomalies,
related to one another? Not in any obvious way, researchers say.
   And how about the theory that gases added to the atmosphere are
causing a greenhouse-like warming of the planet?
   Backers of that idea might find support in the droughts and heat
in the United States and Argentina.
   But it'll probably be hard to sell the greenhouse theory to
residents of Alaskan owns where the temperature dipped to 70 degrees
and more below zero _ particularly since the greenhouse theory holds
that any warming should be felt more strongly at the poles than in
other areas.
   Whether the hot summer, cold Alaskan January or other weather
represents any sort of trend will not likely be sorted out quickly.
   The weather, after all, varies widely from year to year and
``normal'' is just the average of those variations.
   ``The drought was strong and got a lot of press, but these types
of deviations are going to happen each year somewhere,'' commented
Richard J. Tinker of the federal Climate Analysis Center.
   At any rate, the heat and drought that struck this nation in the
breadbasket was probably the most significant weather event of the
year, being the most severe drought since the Dust Bowl year of
1936, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   The drought extended from the northern Rockies across the Great
Plains to the Gulf Coast and Southeast.
   Crop yields were reduced and dryness remains a threat in many
areas, where farmers are hoping for winter snows to moisten the
parched ground.
   The drought was aggravated by extreme heat, with the
north-central states and Canada experiencing the hottest summer in
at least 38 years. Hundreds of heat records were topped before
relief came in late August.
   But while that hot spell attracted the headlines it was almost
completely balanced, and the nation's average temperature for the
year came out near to normal.
   Helping keep the balance were the bitter cold that swept across
much of the nation in January 1988; a cold spell in the Northeast in
April and May; an unusually cool October in the Midwest and a
mid-December cold snap in the Northeast.
   In addition to the severe heat and drought in the United States
and Canada last summer, here is a look at some other unusual weather
conditions around the world during 1988:
   _Drought struck the major farming area of northern Argentina in
June and has persisted for more than 30 weeks. It was accompanied
during much of the period by warmer than normal temperatures,
although that has now moderated somewhat. Affected in addition to
Argentina are adjacent areas of other nations including Uruguay,
Paraguay and Brazil.
   _Dry conditions prevailed across much of east central China
during the summer, broken by occasional extreme thunderstorms. By
the end of August southern China was plagued by extraordinarily wet
weather, followed by less than half the normal rainfall for the last
three months of the year.
   _In the middle of May a cold spell plagued the southern
two-thirds of South America, lasting until the end of June and
bringing freezing temperatures as far north as the coffee-growing
regions of Brazil.
   _Very hot weather baked south central Asia, with a severe heat
wave in May and June. A good monsoon season brought plenty of
moisture and moderated the heat over India, although the heavy rains
triggered some landslides and flooding.
   _Spring was extremely wet over Europe from Scandinavia to
Switzerland, although the problem had moderated by May. Unusually
moist conditiones continued to plague Scotland through September,
however.
   _Southeastern Siberia, northeastern China and Korea had unusually
warm weather from October through December.
   _Torrential rains struck Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe in
February and persisted through April in some areas.
   _January and February of 1988 were unusually mild across most of
Europe with the warmest weather over the United Kingdom and Central
Europe.
   _However, November and December proved unusually cold over
Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Winter storms with snow and high
winds ranged from Denmark to Germany to Greece and even the Middle
East.
   _Australia was hot and dry for the first three months of the year
before cooler temperatures and rainfall moderated conditions.

<TEXT>
   A U.S.-Soviet public opinion poll has found good
will among residents of Moscow and four American cities, despite
fears over their nations' longstanding rivalry.
   Majorities in Moscow and in the U.S. cities saw the superpowers
as friendly, the survey found, and more than eight in 10 agreed the
two nations were entering ``a new era of peace and cooperation.''
   At the same time, nearly four in 10 Muscovites saw the United
States as a serious threat to their nation, and as many or more of
the Americans saw the Soviets as a threat to the United States, the
survey found.
   The poll was sponsored by WCVB-TV in Boston, the Detroit Free
Press, the Daily News and WCBS television and radio in New York, and
KRON-TV in San Francisco. It was conducted by telephone Dec. 15-25
among approximately 1,000 adults each in Moscow and New York and
about 600 each in Boston, Detroit and San Francisco. It had a
three-point margin of error for the larger samples, four for the
smaller ones. The results were published last week.
   The survey measured social as well as political views, providing
for comparisons of the beliefs and lifestyles of the Soviets and
Americans in the cities where it was conducted.
   Muscovites, for example, were considerably more confident in
their government, with 37 percent saying they always can trust it to
do what's right. Just 6 percent of the Americans said the same of
their government.
   But more of the Americans had great pride in their nationality.
Depending on the city, about seven in 10 said they were very proud
to be Americans. In Moscow, four in 10 were very proud to be Soviets.
   The Americans were far more content with the goods and services
available to them and more positive about their economy. More than
half said their lives had improved in recent years, compared with 37
percent of Muscovites.
   Among other findings:
   _The Moscow residents socialized less frequently than the
Americans and were far less likely to eat in restaurants or attend
sporting events. Nearly half the Muscovites said they never
exercised; no more than a quarter of the Americans said that.
   _The Muscovites were far more avid readers than the Americans,
with 61 percent saying they sat down to read a book almost daily.
That was twice the number of daily readers, for example, in Boston.
   _American respondents were more aware of several international
figures. Nearly four in 10 of the Muscovites said they had never
heard of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and a quarter said they had
never heard of Pope John Paul II or Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran.
   _Far more of the Americans said they had a family member or a
friend who had at some time had a drug problem _ 26 percent or more,
compared with just 3 percent in Moscow. Although more Americans also
said someone close to them drank too much, pollsters said the
Muscovites could have been holding back on that question because of
a government crackdown on alcohol abuse.
   _At least two-thirds of the Americans said religion was important
in their daily lives, compared with just 13 percent of Muscovites.
Eighty percent or more of the Americans in each city believed in
God, compared with 10 percent of the Moscow residents.
   _Majorities of the Muscovites and Americans alike said the United
States offered better health care and was ahead in science and
technology. But they also agreed the United States had more
discrimination against minorities.
   Whatever their nations' differences, at least three-quarters of
the Americans in each city said they had a generally favorable
impression of the Soviet people. Similarly, eight in 10 Soviets
thought well of Americans.
   The survey was conducted in the United States by two polling
companies, Market Opinion Research and Marttila &amp; Kiley, and in
Moscow by the Institute for Sociology, a branch of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, with monitoring by the U.S. pollsters.

   Their faces reddened by the sun and
streaked with dirt, the sons of Russia drove a growling convoy of
armor to the border of their homeland and the end of their
involvement in the Afghan war.
   Three days out of the Afghan capital, Kabul, the thread of
muddied military green on Sunday reached the Amu Darya River, which
marks the border between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union.
   ``Of course, we're looking forward to going home,'' said
blue-eyed Andrei Ogarkov of Moscow, poking his head from the turret
of a light tank, the seventh in the 65-vehicle convoy. He said his
seven months in Afghanistan were enough.
   The convoy ground its way homeward through the Hindu Kush
mountains and the Salang Pass, where heavy fighting occurred a week
ago between anti-Marxist rebels and the Afghan army backed by Soviet
artillery and warplanes.
   Soldiers in the convoy said there was no fighting as they made
their way north but that a few of their fellows were killed and
several vehicles destroyed in an avalanche.
   The Soviet soldiers will cross the border Monday, when an
official welcoming ceremony is to be held in Termez, a border town
in the Soviet republic of Uzbekistan. They bivouacked Sunday night
in Hayratan, along with other returning Soviets, and some said they
expected wives and family members to greet them when they crossed
into Termez.
   On Sunday, Mi-24 helicopters scoured the sand dunes along the
highway as the convoy finished its trip.
   As they headed home ahead of the Feb. 15 deadline for withdrawal
of all Soviet soldiers from Afghanistan, soldiers expressed
ambivalence about their nine-year military intervention and
uncertainty about the shaky pro-Soviet government they leave behind.
   ``The Soviet policy in Afghanistan brought nothing,'' said tank
commander Andrei Yevryolin, speaking to foreign reporters who rode
for an hour atop his tank until the convoy reached Hayratan.
   At a military outpost near the northern Afghan city of
Mazar-i-Sharif, 30-year-old Capt. Arkady Anonich bluntly answered
``No'' when asked if he thought the local people supported the
government of President Najib.
   He told journalists the Kremlin's decision to send soldiers to
Afghanistan in December 1979 had been ``ill-considered.''
   ``There should have been another way to settle this conflict,''
he said.
   Anonich said the Afghan army was weak in technical expertise and
suffered low morale.
   Another Soviet army captain, Sergei Ofitserov, said, ``The
Afghans will have to work it out for themselves now. We will only
get in the way.''
   The convoy that reached the border Sunday included tanks, armored
cars, armored personnel carriers and trucks. Some trucks were
missile carriers, but their beds were covered with tarpaulins,
making it impossible to tell if they were transporting missiles.
   The convoy was part of a mighty armada of Soviet military power
that has been heading north from Kabul in the past week. Soviet and
Afghan officials in Kabul have estimated there are only about 1,000
Soviet soldiers left in Afghanistan, including a garrison at the
capital's airport.
   The convoy raised a trail of dust and exhaust fumes as it roared
up the main road to Termez, which is already indented by the tracks
of hundreds of vehicles that have passed through during the years of
Soviet involvement in Afghanistan.
   The column passed destroyed chassis' of jeeps and other military
vehicles, the refuse of war, and outposts where armored vehicles
were dug into sand dunes to protect the withdrawal route.
   As it ground its way toward the border, the convoy passed small
groups of Afghans who watched silently, knowing that with the Red
Army's departure, the fate of Najib's government was more in
question than ever.

   The chance discovery of a cache of nearly
forgotten photographs by Ansel Adams has yielded a new book with a
haunting insider's view of the internment camps where more than
120,000 Japanese-Americans were held captive during World War II.
   The insider was Adams himself, the renowned scenic photographer
who left Yosemite National Park with his cameras in the fall of 1943
to visit an internment camp at Manzanar, in the wind-swept desert
along the eastern edge of California's Sierra Nevada.
   It was there that Adams made his first _ and only _ attempt to
shoot a photo documentary. The photographer, sympathetic to the
plight of the innocent inhabitants, published some of the pictures
in ``Born Free and Equal,'' a book he later wrote about Manzanar.
   But the wartime public's reaction was hostile. Copies were burned
in protest, and the photographer's shows were canceled. Adams let
the copyright expire, and gave the negatives and hand-signed prints
to the Library of Congress in the 1960s.
   Not long after Adams' death in 1984, Peter Wright, a news photo
editor at The Associated Press in Washington, was spending his day
off rummaging through the library's vast collection of original
photographs and negatives.
   Wright came across a catalogue card listing the negatives of
Adams' ``Manzanar'' pictures. Curious, he asked to see them.
   ``Up came about a dozen cases of 11-by-14 prints, about 240 of
them, all hand-signed by Adams along with the negatives,'' Wright
said.
   ``It was unbelievable. These pictures had been mentioned in
several books about Adams, but I had only seen one or two of the
published prints. Suddenly to see the whole collection was amazing.''
   Now, with access to rare and highly valuable photographs hidden
away in a vault at the Library of Congress for two decades, Wright
turned to friend John Armor, a constitutional lawyer who has studied
the legal controversy over the wartime internment of
Japanese-Americans.
   Together, they reviewed piles of documents at the National
Archives and the Library of Congress _ some of them only recently
declassified _ and wrote a book illustrated with 90 of Adams'
photographs from the Manzanar camp.
   ``Manzanar,'' containing a lengthy foreword by novelist John
Hersey entitled ``A Mistake of Terrifically Horrible Proportions,''
was published last November by Times Books, a division of Random
House Inc.
   All the principals who contributed to the book felt outrage at
what happened to the more than 10,000 Americans of Japanese descent
who were rounded up as security risks and shipped to Manzanar in the
spring of 1942, a few months after Pearl Harbor.
   Thousands more were herded into nine other ``relocation centers''
in California, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming and Arkansas. They
were crowded into tar-paper barracks, used communal toilets and had
no telephones or automobiles, many of them staying there for 3{
years.
   ``So much we left behind,'' said one inmate, ``but the most
valuable thing I lost was my freedom.''
   Though invited to Manzanar by the camp director, an old friend,
Adams was forbidden to photograph the barbed-wire fences or the
guard towers with searchlights and machine guns that surrounded the
camp city.
   Jonathan Segal, editorial director of Times Books, said in a
telephone interview from New York that he was ``shocked'' when he
saw Adams' photographs.
   ``I thought ... what did these people do wrong?'' Segal said.
``Who had the authority to do this? Where was our moral courage, our
American principle of you're innocent until proved guilty?''
   In his foreword, Hersey called the government's internment policy
``the bitterest national shame of the Second World War for the sweet
land of liberty.''
   Hersey, 74, is the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of
``Hiroshima,'' published in 1946. In an interview from his Key West,
Fla., home, Hersey saw no parallel between the United States' atomic
bomb attack on that Japanese city and its internment of
Japanese-American citizens at home.
   Although Hiroshima was a ``human horror,'' he said, it shortened
the war and averted further heavy loss of lives, but the domestic
internment of Japanese-Americans was ``a very serious lapse in our
dearest traditions'' of respect for civil liberties.
   Armor said his book research only reinforced his conviction that
the Supreme Court's 1944 decision sanctioning internment was ``an
abomination.'' He said the ruling was based on suppressed evidence
that claims of potential disloyalty by Japanese-Americans were
totally groundless.
   Wright now believes strongly that ``what we did to those people
was wrong and unjust.''
   ``I think we finished the project that Adams felt very dearly
about so many years ago,'' Wright said.
   Last August, President Reagan signed legislation authorizing
reparations of $20,000 in tax-free payments to each of the estimated
60,000 internment camp survivors. The Justice Department says it
hopes to begin disbursing payments by next October, after eligible
recipients are located.

   ``Dynasty'' star Joan Collins is
selling her Beverly Hills mansion, which includes a
6,000-square-foot main house and a 2,000-square-foot guest house.
   The home was built in 1963 for Laurence Harvey, the late British
actor, and was later owned by comedian Totie Fields, the Los Angeles
Times reported Sunday.
   After Miss Collins purchased the property for about $1.9 million
in 1986, she had the place extensively renovated, and is now asking
$6 million for the mansion.
   The mansion is not the two-story Los Angeles hillside home
featured during Miss Collins' sensational divorce last year from
former Swedish rock star Peter Holm. That one was sold to filmmaker
Freddie Fields for $675,000 during the divorce proceedings.

   Kerry Kennedy, executive director of
the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights, said private
citizens have an obligation to work for justice.
   ``Everybody can do something, whether it's holding conferences
like this or joining organizations,'' the 29-year-old daughter of
the slain political leader told a human rights conference Saturday
night. She spoke along with Costa Rican president Oscar Arias,
winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.
   Kennedy said she thought the human rights situation in Latin
America was improving, but that ``many challenges still lie ahead.''
   ``For instance, we've had the plebiscite in Chile, but (Augusto)
Pinochet is still in power,'' she said.
   Ethel Kennedy, Kerry's mother, said she agreed with her
daughter's work.
   ``My husband was very concerned that the elite were much more
interested in their own lives and not in seeing how others get by,''
she said.

   Cowboy stars Roy Rogers, Gene Autry,
Pedro Gonzales and Pat Buttram, dressed in tuxedos, rode to Rex
Allen's rescue, helping to raise $100,000 toward the establishment
of a museum in Allen's home town.
   Allen, the singing star of many 1950s Western movies, is working
to raise $250,000 to open a western museum and movie house in the
tiny southeastern Arizona town of Willcox.
   His fellow Western stars attended a fund-raiser dinner and
celebrity roast in his honor Saturday night.
   The movie house will show new films as well as old cowboy serials
and Rex Allen movies. Willcox has had no theater since 1980.
   Rogers said the serials he and the others made were perhaps the
last family westerns that offered children true heroes.
   ``We made them for the family in those days,'' Rogers said,
adding that contemporary films don't do kids any good. ``I wouldn't
even let Trigger to go to them.''
   Allen signed on with Republic Pictures in 1949. His first film,
``Arizona Cowboy,'' was released in 1950. He made 25 westerns for
Republic and played the lead in the 1950 television show ``Frontier
Doctor.''

   The wheels have come off auto racing
star Richard Petty's upcoming debut on ``60 Minutes,'' and it was
Diane Sawyer's switch of newtorks that sent the NASCAR king into the
pits.
   A ``60 Minutes'' segment by Sawyer on Petty, scheduled to be

   Petty, NASCAR's all-time winner with 200 victories in 30 years,
said that he was informed Friday morning by an executive for the CBS
show that the segment had been pulled in the wake of Sawyer's
signing with ABC.
   ``As far as I know it's off right now,'' Petty said. ``Since
she's gone over to ABC, they said they don't want to show anything

   A former prime minister escaped with
minor bruises Sunday when three bombs exploded at a campaign rally
and security guards responded by firing randomly. Nearly 40 people
were reported injured.
   Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who has become a top opposition leader
since leaving office, said the attempt on her life failed when a
bodyguard kicked away a grenade that was thrown at her before it
could explode. She survived a similar assassination attempt in
December while campaigning for president.
   Five thousand people were attending the outdoor rally when
unidentified assailants hurled the explosives just as Mrs.
Bandaranaike stood up to make a speech kicking off her party's
campaign for the Feb. 15 general election.
   A military official in Colombo, who cannot be identified under
briefing rules, said at least 38 people were injured, 14 seriously,
in the attack in Hingurakgoda, a remote town 100 miles northeast of
Colombo.
   Many were shot by Mrs. Bandaranaike's security guards, who shot
randomly after the bombs exploded. ``The bodyguards panicked and
opened up with rifles, pistols and shotguns, injuring a lot of
people,'' he said.
   Authorities said they were unsure who was behind the attack. At
least 10 candidates, including six from Mrs. Bandaranaike's party,
have been killed in the past month by suspected Sinhalese militants.
   The attack came one day after at least 13 people were killed in
Sri Lanka in violence related to the election.
   Mrs. Bandaranaike, 72, sustained minor bruises in a stampede that
followed the explosions, a member of her opposition Sri Lanka
Freedom Party said.
   Mrs. Bandaranaike was elected the world's first woman prime
minister in 1960. She ruled until 1965 and then again from 1970-77.
   Her husband, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, was prime minister when he
was assassinated by a Buddhist monk in 1959.
   She is now president of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the nation's
main opposition group. She was the runner-up in the presidential
election Dec. 19, losing to Ranasinghe Premadasa of the United
National Party.
   Her party has promised to reduce ethnic conflict between minority
Tamils and the majority Sinhalese, to send back Indian soldiers
enforcing a peace accord and to avoid the socialist policies she
once promoted as prime minister.
   The election, for 225 seats in Parliament, will select the next
prime minister, a post less powerful than that of president.
   Mrs. Bandaranaike refused Sunday to say who might have staged the
attack. ``We are not going to say anything at the moment,'' she told
reporters in the nearby town of Anuradhapura. ``We've got our own
investigations going.''
   Both Sinhalese militants and Tamil rebels oppose the holding of
general elections, but for different reasons.
   The Sinhalese militants, who also oppose the peace plan, have
vowed to disrupt the voting as part of their anti-government
campaign launched in 1987.
   Sinhalese extremists say the July 29, 1987 accord, designed to
end the Tamil separatist struggle, gives the Tamils too many
concessions.
   Most Tamil rebel groups approved the accord, but the largest
militia, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, reneged on the plan
and has since targeted moderate Tamils, whom they regard as traitors.
   Sinhalese form 75 percent of the country's 16 million people and
control the government and military. Tamils, who make up 18 percent
of the population, claim they are discriminated against by the
Sinhalese.
   At least 8,500 people have been killed in the Tamil separatist
war since it was launched in 1983. The Sinhalese extremists have
been blamed for another 1,000 killings since July 1987.

   King Hussein of Jordan will visit the United States
soon to discuss the Palestinian problem with President Bush, Prime
Minister Zaid Rifai was quoted as saying Sunday.
   In an interview with the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Watan, Rifai gave
no date for the visit but said the talks will cover latest
developments in the Middle East, the Palestinian problem and the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   There have been reports Bush would invite leading Middle East
leaders for consultations on a settlement of the 40-year
Arab-Israeli problem.
   Asked if he thought the United States would offer a new Middle
East peace initiative, Rifai said, ``We're fed up with initiatives
... the basis for a settlement and the solutions are there, and
agreed upon internationally, with the exception of the Israeli
stance.
   ``And regrettably they (Israel) are supported by the American
stance,'' he added.
   Rifai reiterated rejection of an Israeli proposal that a
settlement be negotiated at an international conference under the
aegis of only the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet
Union.
   Arabs want an international conference under the umbrella of the
United Nations with participation of all five permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council _ the United States, Soviet Union,
Britain, France and China. They also want the Palestine Liberation
Organization represened at the talks, a suggestion rejected by
Israel.
   ``We do not want the Arab -Israeli conflict to be polarized into
a conflict between the two superpowers,'' Rifai said.
   King Hussein was in Iraq on Sunday for talks with President
Saddam Hussein that will include plans for an economic grouping with
Egypt and North Yemen, diplomatic sources said.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Rifai
accompanied Hussein.
   Before leaving for Baghdad, Hussein met briefly with Osama
El-Baz, an adviser to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who handed
the king a message from the Egyptian leader, according to official
sources.
   They did not say what was discussed.
   In Cairo, the Middle East New Agency said the letter from Mubarak
dealt with ``the latest developments of the situation in the Middle
East and new developments in the Arab world, and comes in the
framework of continued consultations between the two Arab leaders.''

   Solidarity is poised to return to center
stage Monday when opposition and government leaders start
negotiating political reforms that could restore the banned
organizaton's legal status and transform Parliament.
   Sixty chairs for delegates have been placed around a round table
at Namiestnikowski government palace in downtown Warsaw, but
Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak and Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa are the key negotiators.
   Other delegates are from the official trade union alliance OPZZ,
the Peasants' Party and Democratic Party.
   Kiszczak, a Politburo member, proposed the talks in August 1988
during nationwide strikes.
   The talks will be the first between Solidarity as an organization
and the state since authorities imposed martial law in December 1981
to crush the Soviet bloc's only independent trade union. Solidarity
was signed into existence 16 months earlier by Walesa and
then-Politburo member Mieczylsaw Jagielski.
   Solidarity remains skeptical of the authorities, but both sides
agree compromise is essential if Poland is to grapple with a $38.9
billion debt, 60 percent inflation, chronic consumer shortages and
threats of labor unrest.
   ``Lech Walesa believed in 1980 and what came out of it? It's
similar now: we don't believe ... The closer we get to it, the less
I believe,'' Walesa told other Solidarity leaders Sunday, referring
to the shattered agreement that first legalized Solidarity.
   ``We have to win a lot because there is no other solution for
Poland but a broad economic, democratic, and political pluralistic
opening. And it will be possible, but we should concentrate on
fighting for it,'' said Walesa.
   Solidarity's team of 25 negotiators includes former underground
Solidarity leader Zbigniew Bujak, and Adam Michnik and Jacek Kuron,
two opposition leaders whom authorities initially rejected as
delegates.
   OPZZ announced last week its eight-person delegation would be
headed by union leader Alfred Miodowicz.
   Kiszczak and Walesa met six times to set up the talks, but Walesa
refused to commit Solidarity until authorities agreed to legalize
the union.
   In a dramatic reversal, the Central Committee on Jan. 18 approved
negotiations to legalize the union and, four days later, Solidarity
agreed to the talks.
   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski has suggested Solidarity
observe a strike moratorium as part of the legalization agreement.
   But Bronislaw Geremek, a historian and top Solidarity adviser
taking part in the talks, said, ``We won't abandon the right to
strike, but we declare that Solidarity will search at any cost to
avoid strikes.''
   The second key issue is the electoral law, though even if it is
changed it likely will guarantee the Communist Party a majority in
Parliament.
   Authorities have signaled a willingness to allow parliamentary
candidates from the ``constructive opposition,'' meaning people
willing to respect the constitution.
   Solidarity insists it wants to be a trade union, not a political
party. But Geremek said a citizens' committee set up under Walesa's
leadership in December eventually could recommend candidates for
Parliament.
   ``The party demands Solidarity be a trade union, but it insists
Solidarity become politically engaged,'' Geremek said. ``The key
problem on the elections will be between those who want to reproduce
their power and those who want free elections.''
   Solidarity says it also wants to discuss legal reforms to create
a more independent judiciary, freedom of clubs and associations,
access to the mass media, democratization of local government, and
economic reforms to diminish the role of the party in factories.

   Millions of Hindus invoking their ancient
faith's countless gods and goddesses converged Sunday at the
confluence of three rivers whose waters are thought to hold the
power to wash away sins and end the cycle of birth and rebirth.
   ``At least 10 million people have already come. It's already a
sea of humanity,'' said Ravindra Gupta, pointing at the flow of
worshipers arriving in this central city for the Kumbh Mela, listed
in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's biggest
religious gathering.
   ``People have already started taking their holy baths. They do
not want to take a chance tomorrow (Monday),'' said Gupta,
Allahabad's chief administrator.
   He said he expects 15 million people at the river banks Monday.
   The holy fair is held every 12 years by the lunar calendar at the
time of a rare planetary convergence: Jupiter in Taurus, the sun and
moon in Capricorn, and a complicated Hindu astronomical calculation
of other planets and stars.
   The Kumbh Mela began Jan. 14 and lasts seven weeks, but Monday is
considered the most auspicious time for bathing in the sacred rivers
_ the Ganges, the Yamuna and the Saraswati _ because it is the day
of the new moon.
   This year, police on horseback, in jeeps, at observation posts
and on foot are keeping close vigils for fear Sikh extremists might
launch attacks at the fair.
   ``We are ready for everything,'' said Trinath Mishra, deputy
inspector general of police in Uttar Pradesh state.
   ``This fair is a sitting duck for terrorists, but we are no
goose,'' Mishra said. ``We can counter any eventualities.''
   About 12,000 policemen and 5,000 militiamen have been deployed
around the 3,000-acre fair site. There are 25 police watchtowers
equipped with television monitors, 25 police posts, 10 river police
stations and 22 fire stations.
   Soldiers at a nearby army base are on alert.
   Allahabad is more than 425 miles from Punjab state, where radical
Sikhs have been waging a separatist war against India's Hindu
majority.
   But Sikh gunmen and bombers, who have killed about 200 people so
far this year, are so feared that distance offers little consolation.
   In the Hindi language, ``kumbh'' means pot and ``mela'' means
fair. The festival's name is derived from a fight over a pot of
nectar.
   According to Hindu mythology, gods and demons were waging a war
of attrition when each side realized it needed nectar to achieve
immortality and victory. The nectar was hidden beneath an ocean, so
the combatants churned the waters. The pot of nectar flew out and
was seized by Vishnu, the god of creation, who fled across the
heavens.
   During Vishnu's flight, drops of nectar fell at 12 spots. Four of
the sites, including Allahabad, are in India, while the rest are in
heaven.
   Holy fairs are held at the three other Indian sites, but
Allahabad is considered the holiest site because it lies at the
confluence of three sacred rivers.
   The pilgrims will bathe in the Ganges and Yamuna. The Saraswati
is invisible to the human eye, but Hindu faithful believe it flows
under the ground.
   They also believe that if they bathe at the exact spot where the
nectar fell _ and at the most auspicious time _ they will receive
salvation from the birth cycle.
   Hindus believe every human is born and after death is reborn.
True salvation is when the human soul escapes this cycle and becomes
a higher being.
   The rush to the rivers has proved fatal in past years.
   More than 50 people died in a stampede in 1986 at a fair in
Hardwar, and in 1954, about 800 pilgrims died in a stampede at
Allahabad. The various holy sites conduct their festivals in
different years because of different planetary configurations.
   Other disasters have befallen the festivals. In 1760, about
18,000 people died at Hardwar in clashes between different Hindu
sects.
   ``In a big fair like this, you have no option but to leave
certain things to fate,'' said M.P. Ashnata, chief government
spokesman for Uttar Pradesh state. ``We can try to prevent a
stampede, but God forbid if it happens, what can you do?''
   On a more mundane level, authorities have tried to cope with
logistical problems by providing parking space for 200,000 vehicles
and docking space for 5,000 boats. At least 400 extra trains have
been routed to Allahabad.
   More than 10,000 tons of wheat, 4,000 tons of rice and 2,000 tons
of sugar have been stockpiled. Each day brings fresh deliveries of
13,000 gallons of milk, 10 tons of butter and five tons of cheese.

   As Chinese-Americans prepare to mark their
New Year on Monday, they remain ``newcomers to America'' despite 150
years in the United States and a population close to 1 million, a
new book argues.
   The reason: a succession of repressive, discriminatory laws
enacted after immigrants _ many from famine-ravaged regions in China
_ were recruited to work in Gold Rush mining camps, lay track for
the transcontinental railroad, reclaim Mississippi Delta farmland
and help settle the West.
   In ``Chinese American Portraits,'' published by Chronicle Books,
San Francisco-born Ruthanne Lum McCunn examines the legislation and
how Chinese-Americans from miners to doctors struggled to survive.
   The result, said the daughter of an American man and Chinese
woman, has been generations of disrupted family and cultural ties
that left Chinese-Americans ``where they really don't belong
anywhere.''
   The Chinese community in the United States consists largely of
immigrants yet to become citizens or recently naturalized, who have
banded together and lean on Old World traditions, said McCunn, who
was raised in Hong Kong.
   Monday marks the start of the year 4687, ``The Year of the
Snake.'' The major New Year celebration is Feb. 18.
   Even Chinese-Americans that have been here for generations are
often singled out for racist attacks that McCunn argues have abated
little over the years.
   When she and her husband moved to San Francisco in 1968, she was
stunned when the landlord became upset after Chinese relatives
visited their apartment. She was told the apartment was for ``whites
only,'' and was accused of renting fraudulently.
   McCunn, who does not appear to be Chinese, was incensed. She put
a ``Yellow Power'' poster in the window of their front door.
   She also said that on several occasions while she spoke with
Chinese friends in Mandarin or Cantonese on public buses, white
passengers would say to them: ``Shut up and speak English.''
   The profiles in her book include the story of Mary Bong, who left
China at 15 and became a dairy farmer, restaurateur, miner and fox
breeder in Alaska. Yung Wing became the first Chinese American to
graduate from an American university when he earned a degree from
Yale in 1854.
   All those in ``Chinese American Profiles'' were affected by
discrimination. One of the first ``anti-Chinese'' laws came from the
California Legislature, which decided in 1852 to tax Chinese miners
$3 a month, upping it to $4 the following year. By the time it was
nullified in 1870, half of the state government's income derived
from the tax.
   In 1882, all Chinese except for students, merchants, teachers and
travelers were excluded from immigration for 10 years by federal
law. The law was extended and stayed on the books until 1943, when
the United States' alliance with China made it a political
embarrassment to continue, McCunn said.
   Even so, when the law was repealed, just 105 Chinese immigrants
were allowed annually, although laws approved in 1948, 1953 and 1962
permitted immigration of almost 25,000 additional Chinese outside
the quota.
   The Reagan administration awarded China an immigration quota of
20,000 a year.
   McCunn said immigration quotas and exclusionary laws have
prevented the Chinese from reaching a population par with other
ethnic minorities in the U.S.
   ``Gradually, with the normalization of relations between China
and America in the 1970s, the perception that Americans of Chinese
descent were aliens, enemy aliens, gradually receded,'' she writes.
``Yet the impression that they are still not quite `one hundred
percent American' lingers.''

   The two joint ventures with foreign automakers
announced by Chrysler Corp. last week are the latest in a group of
``strange bedfellow'' pairings that analysts say can be beneficial
to all involved.
   Chrysler Corp. last week announced it would hook up with Renault,
the French automaker, to make a mini sport-utility vehicle, code
named the ``JJ.'' Earlier in the week, the No. 3 U.S. automaker said
it would also sell Eagle sedans built in Canada by the South Korean
automaker Hyundai.
   They are the latest in a growing number of joint ventures by U.S.
and foreign automakers to market vehicles in the United States.
   ``There are a lot of marriages of convenience in this array,''
said analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York
City. ``You have some strange bedfellows.''
   Projects to produce cars and light trucks for the North American
market involve a variety of automakers and vehicles.
   _Later this year, Subaru and Isuzu, two Japanese companies, will
begin production of light trucks at a plant in Lafayette, Ind.
   _General Motors Corp. and Suzuki will begin making cars and
utility vehicles in Ingersoll, Ontario, within the next 18 months.
   _Ford Motor Co. and Nissan have plans to produce a minivan at an
expansion of Ford's Avon Lake, Ohio, plant in 1991.
   There are three joint ventures operating in the United States _ a
Mitsubishi-Chrysler plant in Normal, Ill., operated by Diamond-Star
Motors; a Mazda-Ford plant in Flat Rock, Mich., run by Mazda; and
the first joint venture, the GM-Toyota New United Motor
Manufacturing Inc. collaboration in Fremont, Calif.
   ``I think the key thing is what you have is a lot of these
players looking to find some means of utilizing capacity,'' analyst
Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton said of joint ventures.
   Cheap labor costs in South Korea compared with the cost in the
United States is a major factor in some of the U.S. automaker
decisions.
   Ford's Festiva, Mitsubishi's Precis and Chevrolet's Lemans all
are made in South Korea.
   In Japan, Mitsubishi makes the Colt line for Chrysler, Isuzu
makes the Chevrolet Spectrum and Suzuki makes the Chevrolet Sprint.
   In the United States, the Flat Rock plant produces the MX-6 for
Mazda and the Probe for Ford. NUMMI makes a variety of small cars
for Toyota and GM. The Diamond-Star plant produces the Mitsubishi
Eclipse and Plymouth Acclaim, both two-seat sports cars.
   While the intertwining of the companies may be seem as orderly as
a plate of spaghetti, there are specific reasons why automakers get
involved in joint ventures with foreign companies.
   ``The risk is very low,'' Phillippi said. ``It's another guy's
plant, it's his overhead. In many cases there's very little that the
buyer has to put into tooling.''
   In return, the company providing the plant gets access to a
marketing and distribution system, and in some cases a dealership
network that helps sell the products.
   Phillippi said GM's Tracker is a perfect example of the
multinational vehicle. The small sport-utility vehicle will be sold
through GM's Geo franchises, from Suzuki's plant in Ingersoll,
Ontario.
   ``You have a Geo Tracker, built in Canada with basically Japanese
components, sold by a Chevrolet dealer,'' he said.

   State courts convicted an estimated 583,000
people of felonies in 1986 and sent about 46 percent of them to a
prison, according to a Justice Department study released Sunday.
   The department's Bureau of Justice Statistics said 21 percent of
those convicted were sent to local jails, usually for a year or
less; 31 percent were sentenced to straight probation, and 2 percent
to other non-incarceration sentences.
   Nationwide, the average incarceration sentence was four years and
10 months, the study said.
   It found that in 1986 an estimated 110,000 people were convicted
of violent crimes, including murder, rape, robbery or aggravated
assault; 103,000 were convicted of burglary and 76,000 were
convicted of drug trafficking.
   The report was based on statistics from 100 counties throughout
the United States that were selected to be representative of the
nation as a whole.
   Joseph M. Bessette, acting director of the bureau, noted that
``the data come from a new statistical series that for the first
time provides national estimates of state felony court activity.''
   According to the report, an estimated 2 percent of the 9,854
people convicted of murder in state courts were sentenced to death.
An estimated 92 percent of those convicted were sent to state
prison; 3 percent to jail; 4 percent got probation and 1 percent got
other non-incarceration sentences.
   For other crimes, the breakdown was:
   _RAPE: 19,685 people convicted; state prison, 75 percent; local
jail, 13 percent; probation, 10 percent; other non-incarceration
sentences, 2 percent.
   _ROBBERY: 42,305 convicted; prison, 76 percent; jail, 11 percent;
probation, 12 percent; other, 1 percent.
   _AGGRAVATED ASSAULT: 38,245 convicted; prison, 45 percent; jail,
26 percent; probation, 26 percent; other, 3 percent.
   _BURGLARY: 102,683 convicted; prison, 53 percent; jail, 21
percent; probation, 24 percent; other, 2 percent.
   _LARCENY, including motor vehicle theft: 91,092 convicted;
prison, 40 percent; jail, 24 percent; probation, 34 percent; other,
2 percent.
   _DRUG TRAFFICKING: 76,437 convicted; prison, 37 percent; jail, 27
percent; probation, 35 percent; other, 1 percent.
   According to the study, state courts accounted for approximately
95 percent of all 1986 felony convictions. The remainder _ 31,537
convictions _ were in federal courts.

<TEXT>
   A poll Sunday suggests conservative
Prime Minister Edward Seaga badly trails his socialist rival,
Michael Manley, in the final days of a campaign marred by violence
that has left at least eight people dead.
   Seaga, one of the United States' closest allies in the Caribbean,
is rated a 14-point underdog in his bid for an unprecedented third
consecutive term in Thursday's election.
   A poll published Sunday by The Daily Gleaner, an independent
Kingston newspaper, said Manley's left-leaning People's National
Party will win a comfortable 36-seat majority in the 60-seat
Parliament. The nationwide sampling of 1,024 voters was carried out
Jan. 27-29 by University of the West Indies political scientist Carl
Stone. No margin of error was stated.
   It is Jamaica's first nationally contested election since 1980,
when an estimated 700 people were killed in a nine-month campaign.
Manley boycotted the last election, in 1983, in a dispute over voter
registration at a time when his popularity was flagging. That gave
Seaga's party all 60 Parliament seats.
   Nothing comparable to the 1980 mayhem has occurred, but isolated
shootings, firebombings and stonings have left at least eight dead
and 75 injured since the campaign opened Jan. 15.
   The Jamaican capital of Kingston, which has 1 million
inhabitants, was calm Sunday with no evidence of extra security.
   Last week, Seaga said Manley's party was planning to provoke
violence to intimidate voters in several constituences where support
for the two parties is evenly split. James Kerr, an ombudsman
appointed to investigate claims of political violence, said police
received no complaints or information to substantiate the accusation.
   At a rally Friday in Crofts Hill, central Jamaica, Manley denied
the charge. ``We must never allow 1980 to happen again in this
country,'' he said. ``Even if you don't believe I have a good heart,
at least believe I'm no fool.''
   Seaga signed an executive order Saturday calling Jamaica's
National Reserve into service to help police and the army keep order
Thursday. He said 10,000 security force members would be involved in
the operation.
   The issue is particularly sensitive with the election coming at
the height of the Caribbean island's winter tourist season. People
fear an explosion of violence could set back the industry's recovery
from Hurricane Gilbert, which battered Jamaica on Sept. 12, killing
45 people and causing $1 billion damage.
   ``Jamaica cannot be too proud of its track record in conducting
elections and should be keenly aware that this time the world is
watching,'' said a Gleaner editorial.
   Heavily armed gangs roaming Kingston's slums traditionally have
controlled large voting blocs in Jamaica. The main political parties
always deny any involvement with the gangs, but until this campaign
they did little to restrain them.
   In August, Seaga and Manley signed a peace accord pledging to
refrain from inflammatory statements and banning ``the procurement
or distribution of weapons for use in political activity.''
   Seaga has consistently trailed Manley in opinion polls in recent
years, although he closed to within two percentage points shortly
after Hurricane Gilbert as he rallied the nation in regular
television and radio broadcasts.
   The charismatic Manley has moderated his image since he was prime
minister for eight years during the 1970s and embraced Cuba,
alarming the United States and foreign investors.
   Now he says he would reopen the Cuban Embassy, closed by Seaga in
1980, but would pursue good relations with President Bush's
administration and Western lending agencies.
   ``We will in due course restore formal diplomatic relations (with
Cuba), but we will do so in a context that ensures that they do not
again become any source of internal tension and do not cause any
difficulties in the United States,'' Manley said Sunday.
   Seaga, 58, who was born in Boston and educated at Harvard, has
forged extremely close ties with the United States. He was the first
official foreign visitor to Ronald Reagan's White House in 1981 and
was an outspoken supporter of the 1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada.
   Since taking office in 1980, Seaga has restructured the Jamaican
economy, raising taxes and laying off thousands of government
workers. The economy has shown steady growth but has never fully
recovered from the near-collapse of the vital bauxite industry in
1983. The standard of living of Jamaica's 2.4 million people has
continued to fall.
   Manley, 64, who was educated at the London School of Economics,
accuses Seaga of neglecting basic social services such as health and
education while more than doubling Jamaica's foreign debt to $3.8
billion.
   No party has won more than two consecutive five-year terms in
Jamaica since universal suffrage was introduced in 1944.

<TEXT>
   Thirty years ago, a Titan 1 missile
roared off a launch pad here on its maiden test flight, spawning an
evolution that soon will see one of its offspring debut as America's
most powerful unmanned space rocket.
   By today's standards, that first Titan 1 launch on Feb. 6, 1959,
was not much. Only the first stage was fueled, with the second
stage's tanks filled with water for weight, and it traveled only 300
miles down the Atlantic Tracking Range.
   But before many months, the Air Force rocket was hurling dummy
warheads more than 5,000 miles at speeds up to 17,000 mph.
   It was the nation's first two-stage intercontinental ballistic
missile and at the time the most powerful delivery system in its
nuclear arsenal.
   ``We certainly were plowing new ground with a two-stage vehicle.
The Titan 1 was the giant of our launch vehicle family,'' said Gary
D. Flora, who as a young engineer began working on Titans for Martin
Marietta in 1960. He now is president of the company's Space Launch
Systems Co. in Denver.
   But the Titan 1 was soon obsolete. It was replaced by the larger,
more powerful Titan 2, which with its storable fuel could sit for
months in an underground silo, ready to be fired at almost a
moment's notice.
   Fifty-four Titan 2s stood on alert for nearly 20 years in
165-foot silos in Arkansas, Kansas and Arizona before the last one
was deactivated in 1982. The liquid-fueled missiles were replaced by
the Minuteman and the submarine-launched Trident missiles, with
advanced technology and easier-to-handle solid fuel.
   Modified Titan 2s were used in 1965 and 1966 to hoist 10 pairs of
Gemini astronauts into orbit to rehearse techniques needed to send
Apollo astronauts to the moon.
   Then, using the Titan 2 as a basic core, Martin Marietta and the
Air Force built a series of Titan 3s by improving the rocket motors,
enlarging the fuel tanks, and adding solid fuel booster rockets and
upper stages.
   Most Titan 3s were used by the Air Force to launch satellites for
such things as reconnaissance, communications, and navigation. NASA
added its Centaur upper stage to a few of the vehicles to launch the
Helios deep space probe and the Voyager and Viking payloads to
explore the planets.
   The next generation, the Titan 4, is on a Canaveral launch pad,
ready for its maiden flight within a few weeks with a classified
military payload.
   The new rocket will be able to lift 39,000 pounds into low orbit
or carry 10,000 pounds to stationary orbit, 23,000 miles out, where
communications satellites reside.
   The Air Force has ordered 23 Titan 4s from Martin Marietta and
negotiations are under way for 26 more. The company also is
modifying 14 of the old Titan 2s removed from silos so they can
serve as medium-size space boosters. The first of these was launched
successfully with an Air Force payload last September.
   Flora said the Titan 4 is a very ``robust, blossoming program''
and he expects the rocket will be America's workhorse space rocket,
primarily for military payloads, until near the end of the century.
   ``With Titan 4 we are pushing into a new generation in terms of
lift capability,'' said W.E. Fields, director of Canaveral
Operations for Martin Marietta's Space Launch Systems.
   Fields said the Titan 4, like the Titan 3, will grow and become
even more powerful as improvements are introduced.
   And separate teams of contractors headed by Martin Marietta,
Boeing and General Dynamics are studying designs for a new rocket
for the early 21st century capable of lifting 100,000 to 200,000
pounds into orbit.
   ``Whether that becomes a derivative of Titan or not is
problematical,'' said Fields, who began working on the Titan program
in 1956.

   Brazilians clad in sequins,
feathers and little else cast aside their economic woes Sunday and
whooped it up at costume balls and street parties during the second
day of the carnival blowout.
   From the southern Pampas to the steamy Amazon, merrymakers packed
streets to dance to carnival bands or summoned forces for the
five-day bash, sipping cold beers on street corners or packing
white-sand beaches nationwide.
   Carnival, formerly linked to Roman Catholic religious rites, is
now an excuse for a non-stop, pre-Lenten party that ends Feb. 8, Ash
Wednesday, when banks and shops reopen.
   Not even 70 percent monthly inflation, which has eaten workers'
salaries by about 50 percent in the past year, has discouraged
revelers, who sometimes spend as much as $5,000 on their glittery
costumes.
   In Rio, sporadic tropical showers have kept the crowds from the
beaches but not from the famous balls.
   On Sunday, 60,000 samba dancers from the poor, mostly-black
``samba school'' neighborhood organizations prepared to don skimpy
rhinestone bikinis and elaborate feather headresses for two days of
parades.
   The parades along a six-block, open-air ``sambadrome'' feature
original lyrics, costumes and floats based on a carnival theme and
are considered the highlight of Rio carnival.
   Each year the ``schools'' spend millions of dollars on the
extravagant floats and sumptuous costumes, which this year will poke
fun at vital current social topics such as racism, government
corruption and poverty.
   The first eight schools were to dance from Sunday night through
Monday morning, with a second group parading Monday night through
Tuesday morning.
   Tickets for the event cost as much as $213 but the 12-seat avenue
boxes, where tuxedoed waiters serve fine food and drink, cost
$12,000 or more.
   Carnival revelers with less to spend were satisfied to beat out
samba rhythms throughout the day and night along beach-front
Atlantic Avenue or attend all-night parties in exclusive nightclubs
or on street corners.
   In coastal Salvador, 1,120 miles northeast of Brazil, millions of
costumed revelers packed city squares and streets to dance to
highly-amplified samba bands perched atop lavishly decorated trucks.
   Similar festivities occurred in the northeastern coastal cities
of Recife and Fortaleza, 1,500 miles from Rio.
   But behind the merrymaking, authorities are worried the wild
sexual abandon characteristic of the Brazilian event could mean a
jump in AIDS cases.
   Rio's gay balls have become a mecca for homosexual tourists.
   With almost 5,000 registered AIDs cases, Brazil is ranked No. 3
in that category worldwide after the United States and France.

<HEAD>Leading Newspapers Report Botha Could Retire Soon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers Sunday said
President P.W. Botha, who stepped down as leader of the ruling party
last week, may retire soon.
   Botha, who suffered a stroke Jan. 18, resigned Thursday as head
of the National Party and was replaced the same day by National
Education Minister F.W. de Klerk, who is considered Botha's heir
apparent as president.
   Botha said he will stay on as president, but he has appointed
Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis as acting president
while he recuperates.
   Doctors say the 73-year-old Botha is making a rapid recovery but
will need at least another month before he can consider returning to
work.
   Botha was not present for the opening of Parliament in Cape Town
on Friday and has not been participating in the government's
day-to-day operations, officials have said.
   The Sunday Times, the country's largest paper, said in a
front-page story that Botha's decision to step down as party chief
``is a prelude to complete withdrawal from public life.''
   The newspaper, citing unidentified sources within the National
Party, said Botha may retire ``within weeks.''
   The Sunday Star of Johannesburg said in its front-page story that
Botha's decision to relinquish his party post has sown confusion,
because National Party members now owe allegiance to three leaders _
Botha, de Klerk and Heunis.
   ``Botha has to retire from the presidency soon to solve the
crisis,'' the newspaper reported, also citing unidentified sources
within the National Party.
   As president, Botha still has control over policy-making, while
de Klerk will be responsible for the fundamentals of partisan
politics, such as organization and fundraising.
   Botha has refused to divulge his retirement plans, and both
newspapers said he needs to give a clear indication of his
intentions.
   ``He deems it unnecessary to offer any clue as to how _ or how
long _ he proposes to wield power,'' The Sunday Star said in an
editorial. ``Not even (de Klerk) knows how it is all going to work.''
   The government must call an election before March 1990 and there
has been widespread speculation it could be held as early as April
this year.

<HEAD>Entertainers Launch Red Nose Day to Raise Money for Charity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top entertainers on Sunday launched Britain's
second Comic Relief Day campaign and predicted that 7 million people
will don red noses on March 10 in a day of national silliness to
help raise millions for charity.
   Organizers hope the campaign will top the $28 million raised last
year.
   Two-thirds of the money will go to projects in the Third World
run by Oxfam and the Save the Children Fund and the rest to programs
in Britain involving young people and the elderly.
   Rubber-faced comedian Rowan Atkinson appeared at the Criterion
Theater for the launch wearing a Comic Relief sweat shirt, T-shirt,
headgear and boxer shorts which are being sold through a clothing
store chain as part of the charity's fund-raising activites.
   Comedian Billy Connolly, who just returned from a 12-day trip to
Mozambique, said he was moved to tears by the plight of a young boy
orphaned when bandits butchered his parents. The boy and other
victims of Mozambique's guerrilla war need help from organizations
like Comic Relief, he said.
   Fellow comedian Stephen Fry said Red Nose Day 2 was intended to
be enjoyable but to have a serious side which would help people.
   This year's appeal has already involved the manufacture of 7
million red noses using 70 tons of red plastic donated by a
corporate sponsor, which kept one factory working three months.
   Other corporate sponsors have produced a Comic Relief mug,
written and designed Comic Relief postcards, and are organizing
competitions for vacations in Florida or Thailand. The pop group
Bananarama is also releasing a recording of The Beatles' song
``Help.''
   Between now and March 10, the campaign will try to sell the 7
million noses and other items to raise money for charity. Red Nose
Day 2 on March 10 will climax with a television spectacular,
organizers said.

<HEAD>Eighteen Dead After Attempted Jail Break</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eighteen prisoners died and eight others
were injured after they were jammed into a tiny cell in a punitive
action following an attempted jail break, authorities said Sunday.
   Several of the 18 died of asphyxiation, while others were
trampled to death by cellmates when more than 50 prisoners were
packed into a 3-by-9 foot cell with no window or ventilation, Sao
Paulo state prison system spokesman Guilherme Santana told The
Associated Press.
   One was shot to death, said Carlos Vasconcellos, who is in charge
of the Parque Sao Lucas jail where the incident occurred.
   The prisoners were forced into the cell after grabbing prison
guard Teresa Dantas in an early morning attempted break from the
jail, in a working-class neighborhood of Sao Paulo.
   ``The decision made by the police officer on duty to place so
many prisoners in a small cell was barbaric,'' Vasconcellos told The
Associated Press.
   The jail holds mostly petty criminals awaiting trial or transfer
to a state prison. By late afternoon, the surviving prisoners were
back in their regular cells, said Vasconcellos.
   According to Vasconcellos, the rebellion began at about 8:30 a.m.
when the guard, Ms. Dantas, opened a door to throw in two thieves.
   When she opened the door, 63 prisoners _ being held in an area
designed to hold 25 _ escaped onto the adjacent jail patio.
   Dantas was taken hostage until police managed to free her and
herd the majority of prisoners into the isolation cell, Vasconcellos
said. One prisoner was shot when the inmates were being moved to the
isolation cell, Vasconcellos said.
   ``They must have panicked in the small space,'' said
Vasconcellos, who arrived an hour later and ordered the prisoners
freed.
   Vasconcellos said the officer who ordered the jailing would be
subject to punitive measures.

<HEAD>Former Sheriff Accused Of Trying To Kill Man Who Defeated Him</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Politics is serious business in Cajun
country, but Lafourche Parish Sheriff Duffy Breaux said he didn't
think it would get so serious that a onetime rival for office would
try to kill him.
   Social patterns are strongly influenced in this town 50 miles
southwest of New Orleans by those who work in the dominant
industries, oilfield roughnecks, commercial fishermen and farmers _
quick to laugh and quick to anger.
   They love good times, LSU football and politics.
   U.S. Attorney John Volz says former sheriff Cyrus ``Bobby''
Tardo, 58, twice defeated for office by Breaux, hired a crew of
former law officers and their associates to set a pipe bomb that
almost blew Breaux's foot off 10 days before Christmas.
   Tardo also was charged last week with attempted first-degree
murder in Lafourche Parish, where a bond of $2 million has been set
for him.
   Tardo and his three co-defendants have all professed their
innocents, though they have not yet entered pleas.
   Investigating authorities have declined to speculate on a motive,
but Breaux said political revenge may have been involved.
   ``I can only see one thing _ it's a political thing,'' Breaux
said. ``I always defeated him. Maybe he wanted me out of the way. I
never thought a man would stoop that low.''
   Tardo, a former state policeman, was elected sheriff in 1971.
Breaux defeated him for the sheriff's office in 1975, then won again
when Tardo challenged him in 1979. Tardo then ran for parish
president and won. He lost that post to Vernon Galliano in 1986.
Parish is the Louisiana term for county.
   Louis Breaux, a cousin of the sheriff and a second-term
councilman, said he cannot believe the charges brought against Tardo.
   ``Talk to anyone in the parish. It's hard to believe. He was
pretty much of a loner, not much of a good mixer, not a hothead at
all,'' he said Friday. ``People take their politics seriously in
Lafourche Parish, but to try to kill a man? That's going pretty far
out.''
   U.S. Magistrate Ronald A. Fonseca ruled Friday that Tardo could
be a danger to society and a potential flight risk if allowed free
on bond, so he ordered him held in federal custody and set a hearing
for Feb. 13.
   The federal case against Tardo is based on testimony of an
unnamed co-conspirator and a transcript of a wiretap in which Tardo
allegedly admitted paying to have the bomb set.
   Also in federal custody are: Marshall McClendon, 42, a former New
Orleans policeman and former deputy U.S. marshal; Ralph Bergeron,
42, a former Houma policeman; and John Tullier Jr., 23, who once
worked undercover with Ascension Parish narcotics investigators and
skipped with $1,800 given him to make a cocaine purchase in a sting
operation. Tullier later returned and paid back the money.
   Tardo allegedly paid McClendon and Tullier $8,000, with a promise
of an additional $12,000 if Breaux died. Tardo later gave McClendon
an additional $2,000 and gave $100 to the unnamed informant to help
him leave town, the federal complaints say.
   Bergeron received $666 for supplying the detonator and the
technical expertise for the bombing, the complaints say.
   Court records say Tullier told an unidentified source in November
that he and McClendon were getting paid ``to blow up Sheriff Duffy.''
   McClendon placed the bomb next to Breaux's car and set it off as
the sheriff nudged it while returning from a Christmas party at a
community center on Dec. 15, the informant said.
   The bomb went off, lacing Breaux and part-time Deputy Daniel
Leche with shrapnel _ nails, bullets and pipe fragments. Breaux
underwent extensive reconstructive surgery to save his foot.
   Tardo and the other three were arrested last week on federal
charges of conspiracy, violation of the Organized Crime Control Act
and possession of a destructive device. Maximum sentences would be
35 years in prison and $750,000 in fines.
   The state charges of attempted murder filed against the four men
carry a maximum penalty of 50 years at hard labor.

<HEAD>Cleric Says Amal, Hezbollah Have Banned Kidnapping Foreigners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RIMA SALAMEH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Shiite Moslem cleric said the
Amal and Hezbollah militias have banned kidnapping of foreigners in
Lebanon, the conservative daily al-Anwar reported Sunday.
   The newspaper quoted Sheik Abdel Amir Kabalan, the Shiites' top
religious judge, as saying the ban was included in a peace pact
reached by the rival militias in Damascus, Syria last week.
   ``Foreigners should have a role in Lebanon,'' Kabalan was quoted
as saying.
   ``It is impermissible for anyone from now on to kidnap any
foreigner, because the accord calls for preserving the United
Nations peacekeeping forces and the foreign humanitarian
organizations,'' he added.
   One of the hostages is U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins,
who was kidnapped Feb. 17, 1988 while serving as chief of an
observer group attached to U.N. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon.
   Kabalan, who heads Amal's religious affairs department, was a
member of its delegation to the Damascus talks.
   The peace accord halted a nine-month war between the pro-Syrian
Amal and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, in which
more than 500 people were killed.
   The two factions were fighting for control of Lebanon's 1 million
Shiites, who make up the country's largest single sect.
   Kabalan was quoted as saying the Damascus talks did not address
the issue of the 15 foreigners missing in Lebanon.
   ``In fact, I haven't witnessed any talks about the hostages. This
issue has a separate approach like the one that led to the release
of the French, West German and Korean hostages,'' Kabalan was quoted
as saying. He did not elaborate.
   The hostages are nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an
Italian and a Belgian. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Hezbollah is the umbrella for pro-Iranian extremist groups
holding most of the hostages.
   The Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War group, freed three French
hostages May 4, reportedly as part of a deal to improve France's
relations with Iran.
   Two West Germans also were freed last year in an apparent effort
to secure lenient verdicts for Shiite brothers Mohammed Ali and
Abbas Hamadi, who are held in Germany.
   Abbas Hamadi, 28, was sentenced in April to 13 years in prison on
charges of kidnapping the West Germans in an attempt to gain the
freedom of his brother.
   Mohammed Ali, 23, is standing trial on charges of air piracy and
murder in connection with the 1985 TWA hijacking in which U.S. Navy
diver Robert Stetham was killed.
   The only South Korean hostage held in Lebanon was Do Chae-Sung,
46, who was second secretary at the South Korean Embassy in Beirut
when he was kidnapped in 1986. He was freed Oct. 26, 1987 amid
reports that a hefty ransom was paid.
   The South Korean government denied making any payment.
   Kidnappings of foreigners serving with humanitarian organizations
prompted the International Committee of the Red Cross to shut down
its operations in Lebanon in December.

   A Norwegian U.N. officer has caused an uproar by
comparing Israeli soldiers to Nazis because of their expulsion of
Lebanese from villages in Israel's security zone in south Lebanon,
newspapers said Sunday.
   Timor Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon,
confirmed he had received a complaint about language used by Lt.
Col. J.E. Karlsen, commander of UNIFIL's Norwegian battalion.
   ``In World War II, my fellow countrymen sacrificed their lives in
the struggle against the Nazis who were trying to expel Jews from
Norway. Nowadays you behave in south Lebanon exactly as the Nazis
did,'' Karlsen was quoted as saying by the English-language
Jerusalem Post.
   The Post and Hebrew-language Haaretz said Karlsen made the remark
at a meeting Thursday with Israeli officers over recent
confrontations between the U.N. forces and Israeli troops in south
Lebanon.
   Haaretz said the Israeli army demanded Karlsen be removed from
his post. An army official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the army made no such demand but filed a protest. Goksel said the
peacekeepers are investigating.
   Rabbi Michael Malchior, chief rabbi in the Norwegian capital,
Oslo, said on Israeli radio that Norwegian Jews were ``very angry.''
He said the reported remark was part of a growing pattern of
anti-Jewish behavior.
   ``We're hearing of such things more and more, not only in
Norway,'' he said. ``It's very important to oppose this. The Jewish
community will respond in the strongest manner.''
   Israeli soldiers and UNIFIL troops have had several
confrontations over the deportation of Lebanese civilias from
Israel's self-declared security zone, which is patrolled by the
largely Christian militia and Israeli soldiers.
   At least 70 Lebanese were expelled in the past month.
   Last week, Lebanon told its U.N. ambassador to lodge a formal
complaint with the Security Council, stating the expulsions violate
international law.
   In addition, Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militiamen and
Israeli soldiers have raided villages in the security zone and
detained residents suspected of anti-Israeli activities, Goksel said.
   Israel created the six- to 10-mile-wide zone north of its border
when it withdrew most of its forces from Lebanon in 1985 after a
three-year occupation.

<HEAD>Poll Shows 11 Percent Would Vote for Radical Right-Wing Party</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The right-wing party that startled the
country a week ago by winning 7.5 percent of the vote in Berlin
elections would garner 11.5 percent in national balloting, according
to a poll released Sunday.
   The former Nazi SS soldier who heads the Republicans responded to
the poll, published by the weekly Welt am Sonntag, by predicting his
party would win seats in the European Parliament.
   ``With this, the sensation is perfect,'' Republican leader Franz
Schoenhuber said. ``With this, our entrance into the European
Parliament in June of this year is more than likely.''
   West Germany has 81 representatives in the 518-seat Parliament,
based in Strasbourg, France. The Parliament discusses issues facing
Europe but it has no legal powers.
   Gains by the Republicans threaten further setbacks for Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's center-right governing Christian Democratic Union,
which has lost ground in the last five state elections.
   According to Welt am Sonntag, a poll conducted over the past week
by the Wickert Institute in Tuebingen asked respondents which party
candidates they would vote for if elections were held the next day.
   ``The Wickert Institute came to the conclusion that 11.5 percent
of voters would choose the Republicans,'' the newspaper reported.
   Party candidates in the Berlin legislative elections Jan. 29
called for the ouster of foreign workers and asylum-seekers, many of
whom are from Third World countries.
   National elections are not scheduled until 1990, but there are
several more state contests this year, including legislative
elections in the conservative stronghold of Bavaria, where
Schoenhuber's party enjoys its broadest support.
   The newspaper gave few details of the poll, and no one answered
the telephone at the Wickert Institute on Sunday.
   Welt am Sonntag said those polled indicated they knew little of
the Republicans prior to the Berlin elections Jan. 29 but believed
the ultra-rightists had been unfairly criticized by other political
parties.
   In Berlin, Schoenhuber's party won 11 of the 138 seats in the
state legislature and the right to send two representatives to the
national Parliament next year.
   The Republicans say foreign workers have contributed to high
unemployment and housing shortages _ problems nationwide but
particularly acute in Berlin.
   The Christian Democratic Union and the opposition Social
Democratic Party have accused the Republicans of stirring up
nationalist sentiment.
   A number of leftist and moderate West Germans staged
demonstrations after the Republican victories and accused the
ultra-rightists of espousing neo-Nazi beliefs.

   A suburban Detroit ice cream distributor thinks
dog owners will be pawing to get their hands on a new product about
to hit the market.
   Seymour Greenstein of Golden Valley Dairy in Oak Park is pushing
an non-dairy ``ice cream'' for dogs that will be sold in area
markets beginning Monday.
   ``There's a lot of giggling and tee-heeing about it,'' said Bob
Grayson, Golden Valley's vice president for sales and marketing.
``But they (retailers) are buying it.''
   ``Make no bones about it,'' Greenstein said. ``We expect a lot of
sales.'' Frosty Paws, made by an Ohio company, will sell in packages
of three or four cups each, Greenstein said. The ingredients do not
include milk, which upsets dogs' stomachs. Instead, the treat
contains soy flour, dry whey and no less than 7 percent crude fat.
   The item will be sold in the ice cream section of the markets,
not with other pet foods.

   Although it's not ready to carry people to
the point of a 155-foot drop, a new roller coaster gave a thrill to
about 200 aficionados who received an early peek.
   To those members of the American Coaster Enthusiasts, the new
coaster with 4,000 feet of track being built at Dorney Park is not
just an amusement ride. It's a science.
   The coaster enthusiasts Saturday shot photographs and videotaped
the skeleton frame of the new coaster as park operations manager Jim
Hennessy spoke amid the mud surrounding the concrete footings.
   The new roller coaster is one of four at Dorney and the second
with a wooden frame. The other wooden roller coaster was built in
1923. Enthusiasts said Saturday wooden frame coasters have a jerky
ride and offer different body sensations than the smooth ride of
metal frame coasters.
   Hennessy said the new coaster, which has not been named, should
be ready by the park's opening on April 22. He would not reveal how
much the new coaster costs.
   The enthusiasts, part of an international group of about 1,800
coaster fanatics, were in town for the ACE's East Coast winter
convention at Cedar Crest College.

   Six men bowled their hearts out _ and at the
end of a 24-hour marathon, they had felled 79,154 pins and perhaps a
world record set in Detroit last year.
   The Guinness Book of World Records must still verify the
accomplishment, but unofficially the bowlers broke the record of
78,384 pins set in Detrit last year, said Bob Garrett, one of the
bowlers who played without stopping beginning at 3 p.m. Friday.
   But the group may never get to lay claim to it.
   A group of Australian bowlers reportedly rolled a combined 83,012
pins in a day, but that record also has not been confirmed by
Guinness, Garrett said.
   Garrett, Craig Boehmer, Bob Garrett, Steve Fabi, Rick Ranshaw,
Billy Wilson and Joe Faulkner bowled incessantly, rolling the balls
down before the pins were completely set up.
   If Guinness gives the record to the men, this will be the second
time in a about a year that a world bowling record was set at the
Dover alley.
   Last February, six bowlers broke a previous Guinness Book of
World Records mark by knocking over 74,558 pins in a 24-hour period.
Garrett and Faulkner were among that crew too, but four new members
joined for the latest attempt.
   The men averaged 189.8 per individual game, 13 pins fewer per
game than the men at Dover Bowl a year ago.
   ``This was about a hundred times more satisfying than last year.
We weren't as good as the bowlers we had last year. These guys have
more heart than anyone else I've ever seen,'' Garrett said.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Sunday rescheduled the
appeal of convicted Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk for Nov. 1, the
Itim news agency said.
   Demjanjuk, a retired auto worker from Ohio, was sentenced to
death last year for crimes against humanity and against the Jewish
people committed during World War II.
   He was accused of being ``Ivan the Terrible,'' a guard who
terrorized and killed Jews at the Treblinka death camp in
German-occupied Poland. Demjanjuk claimed he was a victim of
mistaken identity.
   His appeal, originally scheduled to start in December, was
postponed for six months following the suicide of one of his defense
attorneys.
   The court agreed Sunday to a further extension, following a
request by his defense council, Yoram Sheftel. Sheftel said he has
not yet found anyone willing to replace the late Dov Eitan.
   Sheftel also said he is still suffering from an eye injury
inflicted in December, when an assailant hurled acid on his face
during Eitan's funeral. Many Israelis were angry that Sheftel agreed
to defend Demjanjuk.

<HEAD>Charles Manson Responds To Ninth-Grader's Letter</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mass murderer Charles Manson responded
with a postcard to a ninth-grader's letter asking him what his
future plans are and if he would commit murder if released on
probation.
   Manson, who has a parole hearing scheduled for Wednesday at
California's San Quentin Prison, didn't answer Lario Alcorta's
questions. But he did write a postcard that Alcorta said was hard to
decipher.
   On the front of the card, under Manson's name and prison number,
was written ``You want one to fix what many have done.''
   ``All you wrote about was the judgement made by others and pushed
over on me to carry,'' Manson began. ``People have made me to be all
the frills of their own world and put me up to die for it.''
   Alcorta's mother, Jan Jakubowski, said she was not enthusiatic
about her son's decision to write to Manson and was surprised that
Manson responded.
   ``It's scary,'' she said. ``The man is sick.''
   Alcorta, 14, said he wrote to Manson for a journalism project at
Walnut Junior High. Alcorta said he'd seen Manson interviewed on
television and watched the movie ``Helter Skelter,'' which is about
the 1969 killing spree Manson was convicted of participating in.
   One victim was actress Sharon Tate, then eight months pregnant.
   Manson's reply came Jan. 30, about three weeks after Alcorta sent
his letter.
   Manson, 54, has had six parole hearings since 1978. He had them
yearly for several years, then California law was changed to require
them for murderers only once every three years. His last hearing was
in 1986.

<HEAD>Wild Train Derailed Deliberately in Colorado Springs; No Major Injuries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quick-thinking railroad engineer
threw his coal train into reverse and deliberately derailed it
Sunday after his brakes failed on a hill as the train sped into
town, authorities said.
   Sixty-four of 66 cars and three locomotives were knocked off the
track, but no major injuries were reported.
   ``He picked a pretty good spot to do it at. It's not really
populated in that area. The only damage is to train property,'' said
Colorado Springs police officer Charles Pizzitola.
   The engineer, G.L. Romero of Littleton, realized he couldn't
stop, so he threw the train into reverse, forcing it off the tracks
at about 8 a.m., Pizzitola said. Romero suffered a minor hip injury.
   ``Evidently the engineer lost it at Monument (Hill) and knew he
was out of control,'' Pizzitola said. ``When he got down through the
Air Force Academy, they were really going. He couldn't brake it down.
   ``He got to a point and remembered something he learned in
engineer school that said to throw the sucker into reverse, and he
did. And everything came apart at that time,'' he said.
   The train was going 47 mph when it derailed, police said. The
accident occurred in the northern part of town, which is largely an
industrial area. Police said they were told that each car of the
train was carrying 100 tons of coal, which formed a large mountain
after the accident.
   The train was owned by Burlington Northern, with a Santa Fe crew
and the tracks were owned by the Rio Grande Railway, the officer
said.
   Bill Joplin, a spokesman for Burlington Northern, said no cause
of the accident has been determined. He said in addition to the 64
cars that derailed, there were three locomotives off the track.
   It will take a while to determine the amount of damage, because
each car will have to be examined to determine if it can be used
again, he said.

   Town officials in southernmost
Switzerland considered rationing drinking water Sunday as
meteorologists reported a record 62-day dry spell in the region.
   A meteorologist predicted no major weather changes over the next
10 days for the southern tip of Ticino state, which borders Italy.
   The dry spell is the longest on record. Records have been kept
125 years, the meteorologist said.
   Several towns prohibited the use of automatic car washes last
week. Fires sparked by the drought have destroyed nearly 100 acres
of forest and brush in the area.

<HEAD>Bundy Victim Georgann Hawkins Remembered At Memorial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 14 years after she died, 175
friends got together to celebrate the life of Georgann Hawkins, who
was murdered after she took pity on a young man on crutches and
helped him carry a briefcase.
   The date was June 11, 1974, and the man was serial killer Ted
Bundy.
   But Bundy's name was never mentioned at Saturday's memorial at
Lakes High School, from which Miss Hawkins graduated in 1973.
   ``I knew the little lady, and it hurts me to talk about it,''
said Bob Peterson, a former Lakes teacher, who choked back tears as
he addressed the crowd.
   Just days before he was executed Jan. 24 in Florida for killing a
12-year-old girl there, Bundy confessed to using the crutches ruse
to kidnap and kill Miss Hawkins, who vanished from outside her
University of Washington sorority house.
   Although her body was never found, police long suspected Bundy as
the killer. Before he died, Bundy confessed to killing 11 women and
girls in Washington, plus a dozen more in other states.
   Efforts to organize the memorial began shortly after the
confession was made. ``This is our first chance to have a formal
chance to say goodby to her,'' said a former classmate, Rich Duvall.
   Miss Hawkins' friends also have established a Georgann Hawkins
Memorial Fund to pay for a tree and plaque in her honor outside the
high school.
   Linda Hearon, a sixth-grader when Miss Hawkins attended Lakes,
told how she often timed her bus rides to coincide with Miss
Hawkins' arrival at school.
   ``She was very much someone I looked up to,'' said Ms. Hearon.
``She was kind, beautiful and had a soft spot for children who liked
to look up to the big kids. I wanted to grow up to be just like
Georgann.''
   Ann Jordan, a teacher who advised the cheerleading staff in
1972-73, said, ``I've had a feeling of unrest these many years.
Today we can all be at rest, because she is.''

   Afghan guerrilla leaders will meet
Monday with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to discuss
ways to end Afghanistan's civil war, guerrilla sources said.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said leaders of
the seven-group guerrilla alliance hoped to present a united front
at the meeting.
   In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said the
Pakistan- and Iran-based guerrilla alliances signed an accord on
Sunday to cooperate on forming a new government.
   The agreement could boost the quarrelsome guerrilla factions'
chances of succeeding the communist regime in Kabul regime after the
Soviet troop withdrawal is completed.
   Soviet sources would neither confirm nor deny that Shevardnadze
would meet with the insurgent leaders.
   Hamed Karzai, a spokesman for the alliance, also refused to
confirm the talks.
   Shevardnadze arrived in the Pakistan capital early Sunday for
talks with government officials.
   ``The Soviet leadership has decided to consult with the
government of Pakistan on how best to contribute to restoring peace
and tranquility in Afghanistan,'' he said.
   ``Problems have been piling up. There are quite a few of them.''
   Pakistan has supported the insurgents in their 10-year civil war
against Afghanistan's Soviet-backed government and has allowed the
guerrillas to operate from Pakistani soil.
   Shevardnadze's diplomatic mission came as the deadline neared for
the Soviet Union's troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Soviets
are to be out by Feb. 15 under a U.N.-mediated accord.
   Shevardnadze originally was to depart Sunday, but Pakistani
officials said he extended his stay until late Monday morning.
   His car drove past lines of police as he arrived for talks with
his Pakistani counterpart, Sahabzada Yaqub Khan. He later sat down
to a working lunch with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and then met
with President Ghulam Ishaq Khan.
   Pakistan's government-run television said Bhutto accepted an
invitation to visit the Soviet Union. No date was set.
   Officials would not comment on the talks. They said the Soviet
minister would hold a news conference prior to his departure.
   The guerrillas, also known as mujahedeen, oppose a coalition
government that would include the ruling People's Democratic Party
of Afghanistan, which the Soviets back.
   The guerrilla alliance met with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister
Yuli Vorontsov in January in Islamabad, and in December in the Saudi
Arabian resort city of Taif.
   Talks broke off after Vorontsov said the Afghan ruling party had
to be part of a postwar government or the Soviets would continue
their support of Afghan President Najib.

<HEAD>Five Palestinian Guerrillas Killed in South Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers shot to death five
Palestinian guerrillas during a clash in south Lebanon, the Israeli
army and guerrilla groups said Sunday.
   In a joint statement, George Habash's Marxist Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine and the Syrian-backed Palestinian
Liberation Front said the guerrillas were attacking Israeli
positions inside Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone.''
   Tel Aviv said the guerrillas planned an attack inside Israel.
   It was the first reported attempt by a Palestine Liberation
Organization faction to attack an Israeli target from Lebanon since
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism and recognized Israel
in December.
   The Palestinian statement said other guerrillas escaped after
inflicting ``heavy losses in the enemy's ranks... ambulances were
seen rushing to the site to transfer the Israeli casualties.''
   An Israeli army spokesman denied any Israelis were hurt. He said
soldiers ``on an operational mission'' fired on guerrillas advancing
toward the Israeli-policed zone, killing five.
   The Israeli spokesman and Lebanese police said the guerrillas
were on their way to launch an attack inside Israel when they were
shot and killed by Israeli soldiers near Hasbaya town, five miles
north of the border.
   They carried Soviet-made assault rifles, bulletproof vests, a
rocket-propelled grenade launcher and rockets, 15 hand grenades, a
pistol with silencer, ammunition, knives and barbed wire cutters,
said the Israeli army spkesman, who by custom was not identified by
name.
   Documents found on the bodies showed three of the guerrillas
belonged to George Habash's PFLP and the two others to the
Syrian-backed PLF, he said.
   The Palestinian statement identified only one PLF member and four
PFLP fighters.
   Israeli officials note Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction has
refrained from such attacks, but express doubt that Arafat can
control other, more militant PLO factions.
   The six- to 10-mile wide buffer zone, established by Israel after
it withdrew its troops from Lebanon in 1985, has been a frequent
site of clashes. Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen there fight
Palestinian, pro-Syrian and Shiite Moslem guerrillas.

   A judge who last week withdrew his bid
for reappointment in the wake of allegations of public drunkenness
was found dead Sunday, an apparent suicide, state police said.
   Superior Court Judge Richard C. Noren, 47, was found inside his
car in the garage at his Woodstock residence Sunday morning, said a
state police spokesman.
   Sgt. Robert J. Slattery said that a pipe had been hooked from the
rear exhaust of the car into a window. Slattery declined to say who
notified police, or whether a note had been found with the body.
   Noren, who had fought for his job and reputation before the
General Assembly's Judiciary Committee, on Thursday delivered a
letter asking Gov. William A. O'Neill to withdraw his nomination for
reappointment, saying he did so ``with a heavy heart.''
   On Wednesday, Noren made his last appearance before the
committee, telling lawmakers that he was willing to do anything to
save the job he said was ``the honor of a lifetime.''
   ``I have often said, and not entirely facetiously, I would like
to have on my tombstone the epitaph, `He was a good judge,''' Noren
told the committee. He had been a judge since 1980.
   Hearings by the legislature's Judiciary Committee in the past two
weeks had focused on Noren's arrest on a drunken-driving charge in
February 1986. He was placed in an alcohol treatment program for
first offenders.
   Two week ago, Noren told the legislators that he had been sober
at the time of his arrest three years ago, but had refused a breath
test because he feared his use of a breath freshener would produce a
false reading. In a second hearing last Wednesday, Noren admitted
that he was drunk, but denied that he had lied during the initial
hearing.
   Noren then was confronted with a letter sent to committee members
alleging the judge was seen publicly drunk twice in the past six
months.
   He denied the allegations under oath, but Rep. Richard D.
Tulisano, jucidiary committee co-chairman, said affidavits would be
sought from witnesses of the alleged incidents. He said if Noren had
lied, he could face a perjury charge, but that matter was made moot
by the judge's withdrawal Thursday.
   ``It's just a tragedy. That's all you can say,'' Tulisano said
Sunday after he was informed of Noren's death.
   Jon Sandberg, the governor's press secretary, said O'Neill ``was
informed about it this morning and just called it a terrible
tragedy.''

   ``Brilliant Traces,'' the latest play presented
by the Circle Repertory Company, fails to deliver on its name.
   The two-character play by Cindy Lou Johnson opened Sunday at the
off-Broadway Cherry Lane Theater. It's an hour and a half, without
intermission, originally developed at a summer seminar at Vassar.
   The situation has a young woman in a disheveled bridal gown barge
into a young man's cabin in a snowy, remote part of Alaska. Both are
fleeing human relationships. Joan Cusack is Rosannah and Kevin
Anderson is Henry.
   As they talk, sometimes shouting and crossing the line into
psychosis then quickly crossing back into calmer neurosis, they
reveal, drop by slow drop, the traumas which made them antisocial,
fearful and borderline crazy.
   For him, it was a beloved child who died at 2. For her, it was
her mother leaving when she was young, her father not showing love
and her father now old and so forgetful he doesn't know her.
   The play ends abruptly with Henry comforting Rosannah and the
implication that this is a solution for them.
   Terry Kinney, a founding member of Steppenwolf Theater Company in
Chicago, directs with the kind of stylized weirdness that works for
Sam Shepard.
   When a character runs around doing something off-the-wall in some
of Shepard's plays, a viewer thinks of the character, his own
relatives, the American West and the decline of civilization.
There's nothing that deep in this play.

<HEAD>New Constitution Would Scrap Socialism, Add Multi-Party System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RACHID KHIARI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Chadli Bendjedid has proposed a
new national constitution that drops references to socialism and
opens the door to a multi-party system with protections for civil
liberties.
   Bendjedid's office issued the draft constitution late Saturday,
and said it will be submitted to a referendum on Feb. 23.
   This North African Arab nation of 25 million people has a
struggling economy dependent on oil and gas exports in an era of
sinking prices.
   Bendjedid, 59, has been taking quiet steps for years to move
Algeria away from orthodox socialism toward a free-market economy,
but has faced determined resistence within the ruling party and the
government bureaucracy.
   The process was accelerated after widespread rioting in October.
Officials said 176 people died in several days of fighting.
   The proposed document would supersede the 1976 constitution drawn
up under Houari Boumedienne, president from 1965-78. Boumedienne
established a Marxist system on the Soviet model, with a Politburo
controlling a ruling party that has a monopoly on political and
economic power.
   Under the new constitution, the army no longer would be given a
role in ``the development of the country and the building of
socialism.'' Its role would be restricted to defending the
``national independence, the unity and territorial integrity of the
country.''
   Islam would remain the state religion and Arabic the official
language of Algeria.
   The new text recognizes the right to strike, within some limits,
and says ``the right to create associations of a political character
is recognized,'' but does not explicitly authorize competing
parties. Until now, the ruling National Liberation Front has been
the only legal political organization.
   Also dropped would be a declaration in the Article I of the
current constitution that ``the Algerian state is socialist.'' The
president's oath of office no longer would declare respect for ``the
irreversible character of the choice for socialism.'' The new
document does not even once use the word ``socialism.''
   A first round of constitutional reform, eliminating the party's
direct control over the government, was approved by 92 percent of
the voters in a Nov. 3 referendum.
   Bendjedid, running unopposed as the National Liberation Front
candidate, was then re-elected to a third five-year term on Dec. 22.
   The new constitution would guarantee the right to private
property and to inheritance, as well as freedoms of conscience,
opinion, expression, association, assembly and intellectual creation.
   A statement issued by the president's office when the text was
made public said the new document would provide ``complete,
unbreakable guarantees of the exercise of individual and collective
liberties.''
   In recent months, groups and associations have been holding
rallies, making declarations and otherwise pushing the boundaries of
what previously had been forbidden.
   There was no public input into the new draft constitution,
though. It was prepared in secret by Bendjedid's legal experts and
issued Saturday night with no advance warning. At the same time, a
voting date was set less than three weeks away.
   One of those involved in the drafting, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said it was ``impossible to adopt reforms which reject
socialism as a political system and simultaneously endorse socialism
as a state philosophy.''
   Bendjedid himself recently criticized the current constitution as
a ``mixture of ideology, philosophy and law ... which must be
replaced by a state of law concerned exclusively with the relations
between the state and society.''

<HEAD>Foreign Ministers Consider Tougher Sanctions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN EDLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign ministers from eight British
Commonwealth nations gathered Sunday for a conference to propose
tougher economic sanctions against white-led South Africa.
   The ministers, beginning their meeting Monday, also plan to
discuss new ways for the 49-member Commonwealth _ former components
of the British empire _ to bolster poor black-ruled states
threatened by South African destabilization, organizers said.
   Britain is not a member of the committee because of Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's opposition to sanctions. Thatcher
maintains black South Africans, and neighboring states, will suffer
most from tougher measures against the Pretoria government.
   Canadian External Affairs Minister Joe Clark, who arrived
Saturday in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare, will chair the third
three-day meeting of the so-called Commonwealth Committee of Foreign
Ministers on Southern Africa.
   ``Given the location of this meeting and the special
circumstances of the frontline states the committee has agreed that
destabilization be the theme of the Harare meeting,'' a statement
from the Canadian High Commission here said on the eve of the talks.
   Zimbabwe, South Africa's northern neighbor, is one of the six
``frontline states'' _ southern Africa countries that are in
confrontation with Pretoria over its racial policy of apartheid.
   The regional bloc, grouping also Angola, Botswana, Mozambique,
Tanzania and Zambia, spearheads African efforts for more
international pressure on Pretoria.
   It also seeks massive aid and investment for the fragile
economies of its members to counter South African economic and
military retaliation. Most frontliners are heavily dependent on
South Africa, economic powerhouse of the region, for trade and for
transport links with the outside world.
   Britain, Japan, the United States and West Germany are frequently
singled out by the frontline states for ignoring calls for tougher
sanctions. But the Commonwealth has little real muscle in
confronting South Africa without Mrs. Thatcher's support.
   The Southern Africa committee was formed by the 26th Commonwealth
summit in Vancouver, Canada, in 1987 to monitor sanctions and
propose ways of tightening the economic blockade against South
Africa to force that country to abandon its apartheid system. The
committee met twice last year, in the Zambian capital of Lusaka and
in Toronto, Canada.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 5 million whites virtually
control the economy and government and live mainly apart from the 26
million blacks, who have no vote in national affairs.

   Leaders of the Afghan resistance based in
Iran and Pakistan on Sunday signed a pact to cooperate in a new
government in Afghanistan, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said.
   Velayati told The Associated Press the accord was signed in
Tehran ``after a lot of effort'' during a meeting he held with two
leaders of the guerrillas, who call themselves mujahedeen, or holy
warriors.
   ``They finally signed an agreement for cooperation about a future
government for Afghanistan,'' Velayati said.
   He gave no details of the accord, which could boost the
guerillas' chances of succeeding the communist regime in Kabul after
the Soviet army leaves the country. The Red Army is supposed to be
out by Feb. 15.
   The mujahedeen are split into two groups, the minority Shiite
Moslem alliance based in Iran, and the larger Pakistan-based Sunni
coalition. The Pakistan-based guerrilla leader Sibghatullah
Mojaddidi signed the cooperation and friendship pact with Mohammad
Karim Khalili, spokesman for the Iran-based alliance.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said it was believed
the two groups agreed on the number of seats to be offered to Shiite
representatives in the 480-member Shura assembly.
   The Shura is a form of Moslem parliament expected to meet next
month to appont an interim government for Afghanistan following the
Soviet pullout.
   The quarrelsome mujahedeen coalitions bickered for weeks over the
proportional division of assembly seats.
   Mojaddidi later returned to Islamabad, Pakistan, where guerrilla
sources said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze would meet
guerrilla leaders Monday.
   Tehran radio reported that visiting Soviet Deputy Foreign
Minister Yuli Vorontsov held talks with Velayati on Sunday that
stressed the importance of a peaceful transfer of power after the
Soviets withdraw.
   All sides involved agree on the need for a settlement that will
produce a broad-based government to succeed the ruling People's
Democratic Party, which seized power in a bloody 1978 coup.
   But the party's Marxist leader, President Najib, insists such a
government must retain some of his officials.
   The mujahedeen consider the communists traitors for requesting
Soviet military intervention in December 1979 and refuse to deal
with them.
   There are no immediate prospects for peace between the Kabul
government and the guerrillas armed by the United States, Pakistan
and other Islamic countries.

   Almost all the guests on ABC's ``Nightline''
news program are white males representing a conservative viewpoint,
according to a study of the acclaimed late-night program
commissioned by a liberal media watchdog group.
   The survey of nearly 2,500 guests on more than 850 ``Nightline''
episodes also concluded that the interview program largely ignores
organized labor, consumer and environmental advocates, peace
activists, the working class and Americans who oppose the nation's
foreign policy.
   ``The show sees itself as very much locked in with what the state
does, what the government does,'' said Jeff Cohen, executive
director of Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting, the organization that
commissioned the study. ``(But) national coverage is much more than
what the White House or even Congress did today.''
   The winner of two dozen Emmys and every major award in broadcast
journalism, ``Nightline'' is perceived nationally as one of
television's most influential news programs. It is seen by more than
5 million viewers nightly.
   Ted Koppel, the host of ``Nightline'' for all of its nine years,
criticized the report in a telephone interview.
   ``Never is it even suggested that if you want to critique U.S.
foreign policy, you don't bring on the opponents of U.S. foreign
policy and let them speak their minds,'' Koppel said. ``What you do
is bring on the architects of U.S. foreign policy and hold them to
account, which is what we try to do on this broadcast.''
   ``Nightline'' executive producer Richard Kaplan said he had
``major problems'' with the study, but it ``sensitizes us again ...
to broadening the scope of guests.''
   In examining 40 months of ``Nightline'' episodes from January
1985 to April 1988, Boston College sociologists William Hoynes and
David Croteau found that 89 percent of the program's U.S. guests
were male and that 92 percent of them were white.
   The show's most frequent guests, according to the study, are all
conservative leaders: former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger
and Alexander Haig each made 14 appearances and former assistant
Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Elliott Abrams and
television evangelist Jerry Falwell each made 12 appearances.
   The study, which did not analyze ``Nightline's'' pre-taped news
summaries, also said that representatives of liberal civic or public
interest groups were often overlooked, and that stories on economic,
class, racial, gender and cultural issues received short shrift.
   ``Plainly stated, `Nightline' presents a picture of the world
which is startlingly similar to that presented by the U.S.
government,'' the study concluded.
   But Kaplan said the show never has purported to cover all points
of view. ``They just don't understand that we are not the (opinion)
page of a newspaper. We are news. We cover what's in the news.''
   Koppel said the show is ``guilty'' of putting on the
establishment.
   ``That is what we do. In point of fact, it is our function, we
believe, to try to get the opinions of those who actually make the
decisions, form the policy, and lead the government.''

<HEAD>Welsh National Opera Makes U.S. Debut</HEAD>

   The Welsh National Opera brought a fresh-faced
yet traditional production of Verdi's ``Falstaff'' to the Brooklyn
Academy of Music for its American debut.
   The orchestra, conducted by Richard Armstrong, sounded
first-rate, as did the on-stage French horn player, and the cast of
the production directed by West Germany's Peter Stein contains
young, fresh voices.
   Particularly enjoyable were Donald Maxwell, whose robust voice
made Falstaff sound younger then we've ever heard, Suzanne Murphy as
Mistress Ford, Nuccia Focile as Nannetta, her daughter, and Laurence
Dale, who loves Nannetta.
   The Princess of Wales attended the first of four performances on
Thursday. Reviewers attended Saturday night.
   Realism winds is way through the staging. When the laundry basket
in which Falstaff hides is dumped out a window into a ditch, he can
be seen still in it, unlike some stagings that let him exit through
a trapdoor first.
   Later, Falstaff opens his shirt to reveal what looks like fat,
not pillows.
   Settings are sparse, and everything is used. Mistress Ford sits
on her only chair and plays a lute. With fluffy clouds behind her,
Nanette reclines on the sill of the picture window through which
Falstaff is later dumped.
   Orange and black planks form the interior walls of the Ford house
and the wall outside the tavern, the same colors in Mistress Ford
and Nannetta's dresses. When Ford's men create havoc searching for
Falstaff, they tear strips off the wall.
   In the tavern, Falstaff upends a table and, in a humorous touch,
takes out chalk and uses it as a blackboard. Stein has wisely
refrained from stuffing ``Falstaff'' with visual jokes.
   The stage is made small, giving the opera intimacy and projecting
voices.
   The tavern interior is shallow and the Ford living room not much
deeper. Only the Windsor Park scene uses the full width of the
stage. Even that has cast and chorus _ milling around nicely, never
static _ on a center raked platform for the finale.

   The case of Colorado's frontier cannibal Alferd E.
Packer may be literally dug up again as a group of scientists plans
to exhume skeletal remains of his five companions this summer to
find out how they died.
   Packer admitted ``living off the flesh of these men'' for nearly
60 days while snowbound in the Colorado mountains near Lake City in
the winter of 1874. But Packer insisted that he killed only one of
them, Shannon Wilson Bell, and that it was in self-defense.
   ``The only solid evidence of what happened to the others was
contained in the multiple and contradictory statements of Packer
himself,'' said James Starrs, a professor of law and forensic
science at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.
   ``We want to establish, if we can, what actually happened when
these people died,'' Starrs said in an interview published Sunday in
The Denver Post.
   To date, Starrs said, interest in the Packer case has been
limited to jokes about cannibalism. It is the theme for an annual
spring bash at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
   But Starrs said the case is significant because Packer was the
only person prosecuted in the United States for cannibalism.
   Packer was first convicted of killing his companions. But he
appealed his hanging sentence, won a new trial and was convicted of
five counts of manslaughter.
   He was sentenced to 40 years. After 17 years, he was paroled in
1901 and lived out his years in Sheridan, now a Denver suburb. He
died in April 1907 at age 65.
   In one confession, Packer said two of his colleagues froze or
starved to death and were eaten by the group; a third died
``accidentally''; a fourth was killed by Bell; and Packer then
killed Bell in self-defense.
   In a later confession, Packer said he returned to the camp in
Hinsdale County to find Bell had fatally bludgeoned the others and
was roasting a piece of meat he'd cut from one of the bodies.
   Joining Starrs at the dig in ``Dead Man's Gulch'' near Lake City
will be anthropologist Walter Birkby of the Arizona State Museum,
and several archaeologists and firearms experts from Philadelphia
and Washington, D.C.

<HEAD>Opposition Picks Presidental Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patricio Aylwin, a former senator who led
the opposition's victory over President Augusto Pinochet in last
year's referendum, was chosen Sunday as the presidential candidate
of the Christian Democratic Party.
   The nominaton by the leading opposition party is likely to be
followed by an endorsement from the rest of the anti-Pinochet
coalition. Pro-government forces also are expected to pick a
candidate for the Dec. 14 election.
   ``I trust my name will be accepted by the other parties'' in the
17-party opposition coalition, Aylwin said after his unanimous
nomination by the Christian Democrat's 286-delegate convention.
   ``I hope we will be able to reach an agreement on a single
opposition candidate,'' said Alywin, 70. ``That's what all the
parties in the opposition want.''
   The 10-hour Christian Democratic gathering at the town of
Talagante, 20 miles southwest of Santiago, ended at dawn Sunday with
Alywin's nomination.
   The nomination was unanimous, party officials said, after at
least two other contenders withdrew from the race.
   The nomination was expected to restore unity within the
opposition coalition, which was badly split in the last three months
over the choice of the presidential candidate.
   The opposition coalition is to meet next month to decide on a
single presidential candidate.
   Leaders from virtully all parties in the coalition, which ranges
from the center-right to the left, had said before the convention
that they wwere prepared to support Aylwin if he was nominated by
the Christian Democrats.
   The former senator has been criticized, however, by some leftist
politicians who say he did not oppose Pinochet's 1973 coup that
toppled the elected leftist government of President Salvador Allende.
   Allende died in the coup, taking his own life, according to the
military's version, which is now widely accepted.
   Aylwin emerged as a leading national political figure as chief
spokesman for the united opposition during the campaign for last
Oct. 5 referendum, in which voters rejected a military proposal to
extend Pinochet's term until 1997. The opposition received 3.9
million votes to Pinochet's 3.1 million.
   The referendum outcome made the Dec. 14 open presidential
election mandatory. Pinochet is barred by the Constitution to seek
re-election, but the Constution still guarantees a prominent role
for the military in running the country.
   Aylwin, considered a moderate, has said the future government's
priority tasks include the trial and punishment of those responsible
for the massive human rights violations that occurred under the
military government.
   Aylwin, a law professsor, is a seasoned politician who was
president of the Senate before the 1973 coup.

<HEAD>Arrest In Death Of 2-Year-Old, Two Others Die</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An alleged gang member has been arrested in
the drive-by shooting of a 2-year-old boy, whose funeral drew calls
to halt the persistent violence that left two other people dead
during the weekend.
   The violence came on the heels of an anti-gang sweep of
south-central Los Angeles late Friday and early Saturday. About 240
officers made 118 arrests. Seventy-one of those arrested were known
gang members, police said.
   More than 330 killings were attributed to gang violence in Los
Angeles County in 1988.
   Compton police announced Saturday the arrest of an 18-year-old
for investigation of the Jan. 28 shooting that killed Phillip
Fisher, 2, and DeAndre Richards, 19.
   The man's name was withheld because two other gang members were
being sought, Sgt. Danny Sneed said Sunday.
   The 18-year-old allegedly was in the assailant's car and might
have been the one who fired at least 20 rounds from a military-style
assault rifle into a group of people standing on a sidewalk, killing
Fisher and Richards, Sneed said. Three people were injured, none
seriously.
   About 200 people attended a funeral service for the boy Saturday.
   ``This community needs healing,'' said Pat Moore, a
representative for U.S. Rep. Mervyn Dymally, who urged mourners to
work for an end to gang violence.
   ``Stand strong because this can repeat itself if we don't get
busy,'' she said. ``These are our children doing this.''
   Elsewhere Saturday, a 19-year-old was critically wounded by a
shot to the head while waiting in his car at a stoplight in Carson,
Los Angeles County sheriff's Deputy Roger Hom said. The attacker
pulled up alongside and started a conversation before opening fire,
Hom said.
   Deputies also studied gang links in the death of an 18-year-old
whose body was found in a vacant lot in a Willowbrook neighborhood
known for gang activity, said sheriff's Sgt. Ernie Roop. That victim
was shot several times in the upper body, Roop said.
   Another 18-year-old died after being shot in the abdomen when a
gunman opened fire on alleged rival gang members at a Hancock Park
store, police said.
   Elsewhere, nine reputed gang members in their teens were booked
for investigation of attempted murder in the shooting of a teen-ager
in El Sereno, police said. The victim, described as a gang member,
was standing with friends in front of a house when he was shot in
the leg by someone driving past, Sgt. Tony Silva said.
   Others at the house drove off in pursuit and flagged down a
patrol car. Police later stopped two cars believed to have been
carrying gang members involved in the shooting, Silva said.

<HEAD>House Democrats, at Retreat, Dread Upcoming Decision on Pay Raise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats tried to buck
up their courage Sunday as they wrapped up a weekend retreat and
looked toward Capitol Hill battles over a proposed 51 percent pay
raise.
   ``When we face re-election in 22 months, no one will be defeated
because of that issue,'' Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the
House Democratic campaign committee, told his colleagues. ``When you
address the issue head-up, the people will understand it. We will
survive.''
   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., appearing on CBS' ``Face the Nation,''
reminded the television audience four times that it was President
Reagan who proposed raising congressional salaries from $89,500 to
$135,000, and that President Bush endorsed it.
   However, Hoyer said House Speaker Jim Wright ``is confronted with
an environment atmosphere of a great deal of hypocrisy, very
frankly, as well as hysteria and demagoguery. Any time a pay raise
is before the Congress, there's a great deal of indignation and it's
hard for the Congress to deal with that issue.''
   At their weekend conference at the luxurious Greenbrier resort,
members tried to bowl, swim, ride, shoot, skate, drink, dance, talk,
eat, jog, putt, swing and pray their blues away.
   But many rank-and-file lawmakers said that while it was a great
family outing, it did not alleviate their dread of the looming pay
battle.
   ``We got the news this weekend that we've got an appointment for
a root canal every day this week,'' said Rep. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.,
who was among those hoping Wright would find a way to dispose of the
pay raise issue.
   ``I would like this execution to be swift. I don't want to bleed
to death,'' Durbin said, adding that 75 percent of his constituents
said in a survey they would consider the pay raise a major issue in
the next election.
   On ``Face the Nation,'' Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., said,
``This pay raise is an affront to the American people, both with
respect to the amount and, in particular, the method by which
Congress is going about trying to get this without ever having to
record a vote or hold itself accountable to the American people.''
   Under the law, the pay raise goes into effect for members of
Congress, federal judges, and top executive branch officials on
Wednesday unless both chambers of Congress have voted it down. The
Senate did so, 95-5, last Thursday, leaving the final decision with
the House.
   Wright said last week he would not schedule any vote until after
the pay was increased, but then would have the House vote on
reducing the pay increase to 30 percent.
   That increase would be equal to the amount of current pay plus
outside income from speaking fees and other honoraria that members
now may keep, but would be banned in the future under Wright's plan.
   Wright said Sunday he ``cannot guarantee that we'll be seen or
judged in the right light. Perhaps I can help us to act in the right
light _ with dignity and honor and self-respect.''
   There was no groundswell of support for the 30 percent solution
among the Democrats at the Greenbrier. A top leadership source said
there had been new discussions on whether to just kill the pay
raise, but the speaker's strategy had not changed.
   Many lawmakers _ both Democrats and Republicans _ had preferred
the original leadership strategy accepting the pay boost and
avoiding any votes. Wright's plan, which if approved would have to
be negotiated with the Senate, was seen as potentially dragging the
issue out for months.
   Some also worried they could lose both their pay raise and
honoraria income. Others disliked waiting until after the deadline
for the rollback, since federal judges would get to keep the whole
amount under a constitutional provision prohibiting their pay from
ever being reduced.
   ``There's a feeling that if we're all going to hang, we're going
to hang together,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   Back in Washington, opponents of the pay raise planned Monday to
attempt to force embarrassing procedural votes on the House floor,
in an effort to force Wright to allow a pre-deadline roll call on
the issue. Numerous surveys have indicated that, if put to a vote,
the pay raise would be defeated.
   Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., said he wasn't concerned about further
political fallout because of those insurgents.
   ``The issue already has embarrassed Congress about as much as we
can be embarrassed,'' he said.

   Residents of a Tampa neighborhood rocked by
two nights of sporadic street violence said they are anxious to find
out why a black drug suspect died following a struggle with police.
   Officials say Edgar Allen Price, 40, died of heart failure caused
by asphyxiation after an undercover drug arrest Wednesday night.
Price's death triggered violence Wednesday and, to a lesser extent,
Thursday night in College Hill, a poor, predominantly black
neighborhood. One person was arrested Wednesday and nine on Thursday.
   The neighborhood was quiet Friday and Saturday nights.
   Forensic tests are being run to determine what caused Price, a
burly 6-foot-3, 300-pound suspected drug dealer, to stop breathing
after a violent struggle with eight police officers.
   Some residents of the College Hill neighborhood already have made
up their minds how Price, a convicted felon from Houston, died;
others haven't. But all want to know what the Hillsborough County
medical examiner's office has to say.
   Autopsy results are expected this week.
   ``I want to know how he died, what the autopsy says. Everybody
does,'' resident Marcellis Dismukes said Saturday. ``If I went into
the white Palma Ceia area I wouldn't want them to throw rocks and
bottles at me because I'm black. And it's wrong for the kids here to
do that to innocent people.''
   ``He was a dope dealer. He was not a righteous man. But that was
no reason to get him killed,'' said resident Twine Culpa.
   During the clash Wednesday, 50-75 young people, many ages 12 to
14, hurled debris at officers and passing motorists, torched and
looted a grocery store and fired two shotgun blasts into the side of
a news van.
   About 100 police in riot gear moved in swiftly, sealed off a
22-block area and restored calm.
   Police said Price resisted violently and officers used
nightsticks, handcuffs and leg manacles to subdue him. Thrown rocks
and bottles prevented paramedics from tending a bleeding head wound
at the scene, police said, so officers put Price in a cruiser and
drove about a block away, where medics could get to him.
   By then, less than a minute later, he was suffering breathing
problems, police said.
   Resident, Otis Bell, 51, said tensions have been smoldering since
the 1987 death of Melvin Hair, a black man who died after a
policeman responding to a domestic dispute applied a since-banned
choke hold to subdue him.
   Hair's death triggered several nights of street violence in
College Hill. Afterward, city officials worked with black leaders to
upgrade housing, provide jobs and better economic opportunities.
Progress has been slow, residents say.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega praised a U.S.
pledge to hold off military aid for rebels and proposed that the
United States join Central American governments to fight drug
trafficking, newspapers reported Sunday.
   Barricada, the government newspaper, quoted Ortega as saying Vice
President Quayle's promise and other comments on Nicaragua were
``constructive, intelligent, and not confrontational.''
   Quayle told reporters in Venezuela last week that the Bush
administration was ``going to give the diplomatic route a chance''
to resolve the 8-year war between the leftist Sandinista government
and U.S.-backed rebels.
   U.S. military aid to the Contras expired last year. Quayle
pledged the United States will not seek more aid in order to give
peace talks a chance, according to Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.
   They all were in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, attending
Thursday's inauguration of President Carlos Andres Perez.
   Ortega did not meet Quayle but showed a new peace proposal to
former President Carter on Wednesday.
   Quayle criticized that meeting, telling reporters Thursday,
``Obviously when you have a former president meeting with heads of
state we don't meet with, it has a chance of complicating matters.''
   Ortega told Barricada none of Quayle's statements contained
``confrontational responses, including when (reporters) asked him
about my meeting with former President Carter.''
   The United States has refused to negotiate with Nicaragua, saying
the Sandinistas must first negotiate with their opposition.
   Ortega also said Nicaragua's Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto
will present a plan next week to the United Nations calling on the
United States to work with Central American governments to fight
drug trafficking, the pro-government El Nuevo Diario reported.
   ``It's well-known that Central America is used by the drug
traffickers as a staging ground from south to north,'' Ortega told
the newspaper, without providing any details of the plan.
   Ortega said the Feb. 13-14 summit of Central American presidents
in El Salvador would achieve tangible results for the stalled 1987
Central American peace plan.
   The Nicaraguan leader said he and the presidents of El Salvador,
Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras expect the summit to produce
``not a simple communique, but rather concrete and specific
actions.''
   The peace plan calls for cease-fires in Nicaragua, El Salvador
and Guatemala, political amnesties, democratization and bars
countries from allowing their territory to be used by insurgents
fighting another country.

   The opposition Authentic Panamanian
Party on Sunday selected lawyer Hildebrando Nicosia as its
presidential candidate for the election in May.
   At a nominating meeting held in a plaza in the capital, the party
also named legislator Emiliano Aguilar, 41, as candidate for first
vice president, and businessman Alfonso Diaz, 71, as candidate for
second vice president.
   Nicosia, 64, heads the party founded by three-time President
Oscar Arnulfo Madrid Arias. Following Arias' death in August, his
wife, Mireya Moscoso, resigned from the Authentic party to join the
Civic Opposition Democratic Alliance.
   The Alliance candidate for president is lawyer Guillermo Endara,
who has called the May 7 election a plebiscite on the de facto rule
of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, commander of Panama's Defense Forces.
   Noriega backers in the Legislative Assembly on Feb. 26 last year
ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle and installed Manuel Solis
Palma in his place. Washington continues to recognize Delvalle.
   The pro-government National Liberation Coalition selected
businessman Carlos Duque as its candidate for president last week.
   Noriega is under U.S. indictment on drug trafficking charges. He
has defied U.S. economic sanctions imposed against Panama last year
to pressure him to resign.
   Monday is the deadline for political parties to nominate
presidential candidates.

12 inches at Angel Fire, N.M.
   Snow made driving difficult from sections of New England across
the mid Atlantic states, and the Ohio and middle Mississippi Valley
to the central Plains.
   Most of the snowfall was 1 to 3 inches, but 3 to 6 inches fell
along the southern shore of Lake Erie in Ohio, and in parts of
northeastern Illinois including the Chicago area.
   Freezing rain and sleet and a continuation of freezing
temperatures made driving difficult or impossible across a large
area of southern and eastern Texas, the lower Mississippi Valley to
sections of the Tennessee Valley.
   Many major roads in south-central and southeastern Texas were
closed and in Austin only the most heavily traveled and sanded
roadways were passable, the National Weather Service reported.
Bridges and roadways became ice covered in southern Arkansas and
western and northern sections of Mississippi.
   Ice also closed some major roads in parts of northern and
west-central Louisiana. In northeastern Louisiana, morning
thunderstorms left heavy ice on trees and utility lines.
   Patches of freezing drizzle and freezing rain fell over parts of
Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia.
   Showers occurred over parts of the Southeast from the central
Gulf states to the Carolinas and southeastern Virginia.
   Temperatures in the 80s continued over southern Georgia and
Florida, the remnants of the record warm weather that moved across a
large section of the nation last week.
   More than two dozen cities reported record lows Sunday:
   Abilene, Texas, 9; Alameda Naval Air Station, Calif., 34;
Astoria, Ore., 9; Billings, Mont., minus 19; Boise, Idaho, minus 15;
Calico Rock, Ark., 8, tie; Denver, minus 24; Ely, Nev., minus 27;
Eugene, Ore., 4; Hot Springs, Ark., 11; Houston, 27; Klamath Falls,

Calif., downtown, 24; Salt Lake City, minus 6; San Angelo, Texas,
14; San Francisco, airport, 31; Seattle, airport, 14; Walla Walla,
Wash., minus 13; Wichita Falls, Texas, 7.
   It was Denver's coldest day since Jan. 12, 1963, and Ely's low
was within one degree of the town's all-time low. Some places in
Oregon and Washington were more than 10 degrees off their former
records.
   Some parts of Alaska still had temperatures in the 15 to 30 below
zero range, but Point Barrow, on the Arctic coast, warmed to 24
degrees. Nome, which hit an all-time high of 54 below zero last
month, warmed to 30 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 18
degrees below zero at Craig, Colo., to 86 at Fort Myers, Fla. Sunday
morning's low in the lower 48 states was 46 below zero at Wisdom,
Mont.
   For Monday, scattered snow was forecast from the Rocky Mountains
across the central and southern Plains, the middle Mississippi and
Ohio valleys, and the Great Lakes region to the northern and middle
Atlantic Coast states. Freezing rain and sleet were forecast from
southern and eastern Texas across much of Louisiana and Arkansas to
the lower Tennessee Valley. Rain was forecast over parts of the
Southeast from the central Gulf Coast across Alabama and Georgia to
the Carolinas.
   Highs remaining below zero were predicted from southeastern Idaho
across parts of Wyoming to northern Colorado; in the single digits
and teens over northern and central sections of the Rockies and the
Intermountain region between the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada; in
the teens from northern Texas to the Dakotas, and across the upper
half of the Mississippi Valley to western sections of the Great
Lakes; in the 40s and 50s over much of California, southern Arizona,
southwestern New Mexico and extreme western Texas; in the 40s, 50s
and 60s from the central Gulf Coast to much of the Carolinas; in the
70s and lower 80s over Florida; and in the 20s and 30s elsewhere.

   Moscow Radio said Soviet troops completed their
withdrawal from the Afghan capital of Kabul on Sunday, according to
British Broadcasting Corp. monitors.
   Ten days before the agreed deadline for the departure of all
Soviet soldiers from Afghanistan, the radio quoted Monday's edition
of the newspaper Pravda as saying: ``Pravda's special correspondents
report that on Sunday the last Soviet soldier left Kabul,'' the BBC
said.
   The Soviet troops, sent in December 1979 to help the Marxist
government fight Afghan insurgents, were to have been removed by
Feb. 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement.
   The Soviets began their pullout in August and resumed it January,
when convoys of tanks, trucks and armored personnel carriers started
began up the Salang Highway toward the Soviet border 260 miles away.
   Soviet and Afghan officials said over the weekend there were
about 1,000 Soviet soldiers still in Afghanistan and that they could
be gone as early as Wednesday.
   The report said that although troops had moved from Kabul, there
still were troops in other areas of Afghanistan moving toward the
Soviet border. It said troops were moving from the western
Afghanistan city of Shindand to the Soviet border city of Kushka.
   Radio Moscow quoted Pravda as saying: ``Our protective roadblocks
on the road from the Afghan frontier to the Baghram Crossroads have
been removed,'' according to BBC.
   The report said that in the western sector, two columns had left
Shindand heading towards Kushka on the Soviet border.
   ``Soviet units will leave Shindand on the 6th February,'' the
radio was quoted as saying
   ``On Monday, the first meeting to welcome the columns crossing to
the Soviet bank will take place in Termez in southern Uzbekistan''
the radio said.
   The monitor report concluded with the sentence: ``Pravda's
special correspondents report that on Sunday the last Soviet soldier
left Kabul.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy
called upon the nation's lawyers Sunday to stand up for ``the rule
of law'' against forces that he said threaten to corrode American
society.
   ``It's important that the lawyers of this country understand the
corrosive effect when the law is disobeyed,'' Kennedy said in a
speech to the American Bar Association. ``I'm concerned that time is
running out. You must understand the assault on the rule of law in
philosophical terms.''
   Kennedy, making his first speech to the ABA since taking his seat
on the high court a year ago, did not offer specific examples of a
breakdown in law and order.
   But he said he is concerned by those who use poverty as a
justification for law-breaking.
   ``The rule of law is the only sure way to preserve human
dignity,'' he said. ``We have a legitimate legal and moral right to
enforce the criminal law.''
   Kennedy, who taught constitutional law at McGeorge School of Law
in California for 23 years, devoted much of his speech to an
examination of the historical and theoretical underpinnings of the
U.S. legal system.
   He said that system is founded on the consent of the governed and
survives because of its guarantee of individual rights.
   Among those rights is that of holding property, Kennedy said. ``I
know of no society that has protected human rights without
protecting property rights,'' he said.
   He also denounced the theory of the class struggle that is at the
heart of communism.
   ``Leninism, the class struggle, is absolutely antithetical to the
rule of law,'' Kennedy said.
   Two other members of the Supreme Court are attending the ABA's
mid-winter convention here.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist planned to address the ABA's
House of Delegates on Monday. The group is the policy-making body
for the association, the nation's largest organization of lawyers.
   Justice Byron R. White, a native of Colorado, was presented with
a portrait Sunday by the Colorado and Denver Bar Associations.
   The House of Delegates convenes Monday to consider several
controversial porposals, including an endorsement of gay rights
legislation.
   The proposal would urge enactment of laws to prohibit
discrimination based on sexual orientation. A similar proposal was
defeated narrowly by the delegates in 1985.
   The group also plans to vote on a package of proposals affecting
the insurance industry. The key provision would endorse federal
regulation of the industry and repeal a 1945 law granting the
industry broad exemption from federal antitrust violations.

   Israeli troops killed a
Palestinian teen-ager and wounded 23 other Arabs on Sunday, and
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir branded Palestinians ``alien
invaders'' of the Holy Land.
   In the West Bank town of Hebron, about 30 armed Jewish settlers
locked themselves into two empty Arab-owned buildings they claim are
used to stage firebomb attacks on Israelis.
   In a nationally televised speech to his right-wing Likud, Shamir
vowed:
   ``There will be no Palestinian state here. Never.''
   Israel was linked to only one people _ the Jews, he said.
   ``Aliens, terrorists, PLO men and others are recalled in that
context today. But they are brutal, wild, alien invaders in the Land
of Israel that belongs to the people of Israel, and only to them.''
   Sunday's clashes with soldiers erupted as merchants closed shops
and public transportation halted in the Gaza Strip to protest
Saturday's fatal shooting of two Arab teen-agers.
   Another youth, Mohammed Jamil Mattar, 17, died Sunday when
soldiers fired on stone throwers in the Shati refugee camp,
according to Arab hospital officials.
   His death raises to 374 the number of Palestinians killed during
the 14-month uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. Fifteen Israelis have died.
   In Gaza, soldiers opened fire in three other refugee camps and a
village, wounding 19 Palestinians, hospital officials said. Four
more Palestinians were reported wounded by troops in a West Bank
village.
   The army confirmed Mattar's death and said it is investigating
the circumstances. A military spokesman said the army had reports of
10 injuries.
   The worst violence was in Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp, where 11
demonstrators were reported shot. The youngest victim was 2-year-old
Ahmed Muhaisin, wounded in the left leg with a plastic bullet and
reported in stable condition at Ahli Arab hospital.
   Muhaisin's mother told Arab reporters the child was playing in
front of their home when he was shot.
   The army imposed curfews on Jabaliya, Shati and Khan Yunis
refugee camps.
   Jewish settlers in Hebron, most of whom live in the center of the
Palestinian city, seized two abandoned, Arab-owned buildings
adjacent to the settlement of Beit Ramano.
   They moved into the buildings early Sunday, carrying weapons,
food and mattresses. They told soldiers they would not leave unless
the army took over the houses or turned them over to settlers.
   The army declared the area a closed military district and sealed
off an adjacent market with barbed wire.
   Arabs living nearby said soldiers threw rocks at Arabs and
demanded merchants close their stores.
   ``The settlers were singing and dancing in the courtyard,'' said
Sadeq Oudeh Shweike, who owns a bakery near the houses. ``One boy
threw stones at the settlers and they shot in the air to frighten
people.''
   After several hours of negotiations, the settlers abandoned the
area, saying they were confident the army would set up observation
posts on roofs of the houses.
   Noam Arnon, spokesman for the 250 Jewish settlers who live in
Hebron among 90,000 Arabs, said the sit-in was to get across a
message. ``The message is that the government must end political
restrictions on the army that stop it from working efficiently and
intelligently,'' he said. Jewish settlers want authorities to expel
Palestinian leaders and allow troops to shoot more freely.
   In a separate incident Sunday, vandals attacked a Jewish cemetery
in Hebron. They razed a small shack containing prayer books and
bibles, and threw a burning tire on a cluster of graves belonging to
some of 74 Jews killed by Arabs during 1929 riots in Hebron.
   More than 70,000 Jewish settlers live among the 1.7 million
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on land occupied by
Israel since its capture from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   In Jerusalem, police said they arrested 10 ultra-Orthodox Jews
suspected of attempted bombings and arson attacks against
non-religious Jews.
   Tel Aviv police commander Yigal Marcus told Israel radio they are
suspected of placing bombs along the main Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway
on Dec. 31, bombings of three newsstands last August, and setting
fire to a grocery store in November after the owners ignored
warnings against selling secular newspapers.
   The bombs along the highway did not explode, and none of the
other attacks caused casualties.

<HEAD>Salvadorans Found Leaving Boxcar In Kansas City; Two Hospitalized</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two Salvadoran immigrants were in a
hospital for treatment of frostbite Sunday after riding in a boxcar
for 2{ days with only some blankets and a frozen gallon of milk.
   The two women, and four others from El Salvador, were discovered
Friday, when they left a boxcar in a North Kansas City railroad yard.
   The five women and one man, who spoke only Spanish, said they had
been riding the train in an attempt to reach a relative and possible
work in Washington, D.C.
   ``They were just froze,'' said Ida Barry, assistant manager of a
restaurant near the rail yard. ``Cold isn't even the word for it.''
The city had below zero temperatures Friday and the high was only 5
degrees.
   Juana Isabel Duarte, 38, and Lorena Parada, 21, were listed in
fair condition Sunday at Truman Medical Center with frostbite of
their feet and legs.
   Another woman was released after treatment. She and the three
others were staying with a Kansas City woman while they wait for
their traveling companions to be released from the hospital.
   Speaking through an interpreter, the Salvadorans said Saturday
they were fleeing poverty and fighting in their violence-torn
Central American nation.
   They said they hoped to get jobs and earn enough money to buy
food for their children, who were left behind with friends and
relatives. Among them, they said, they left 15 children in El
Salvador.
   Only the man in the group, who asked that his name not be printed
for fear of political reprisals, has a U.S. work permit.
   No information about the women's legal status was available.
Attempts to reach Immigration and Naturalization Service officials
by telephone over the weekend were unsuccessful.
   The six ranged in ages from 21 to 38, according to an interpreter
and hospital officials. The group includes the man, his wife, her
sister, his sister and two unrelated women.
   They said they had been traveling 31 days.
   Three of the women said their husbands had been killed or had
disappeared within the last two years in El Salvador.
   The six were found Friday by Kenneth Bishop, a special agent for
the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co.
   Bishop, who said he was prohibited from talking to reporters,
spent nearly three hours on the phone Friday, trying to locate
immigration or social services agencies to help the Salvadorans,
witnesses said.
   Eventually he reached the Don Bosco Community Center, where
assistant director Marilyn Anson sent Spanish-speaking caseworker
Toni Valdez to the rail yard.
   ``We're not trying to mess with immigration or make a political
statement,'' Ms. Anson said. ``We're just trying to do the
humanitarian thing.''
   When Ms. Valdez first encountered the Salvadorans, she said they
could hardly walk.
   ``The (Don Bosco) Center wasn't open, and I didn't know what to
do with them, so I just brought them to my house,'' she said. ``One
by one, I had them all take a bath, and when they came out I saw
their toes were swollen and black and blue. That's when we got them
to the emergency room.''
   ``I don't know what will happen to them from now on,'' Ms. Valdez
said. ``They hope to wait here until the women are out of the
hospital. And then, some way, find the funds to continue on to
Washington.''

<HEAD>Castro Says Cuba Ready For Latin America Political Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY CAPLAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fidel Castro on Sunday defended his
30-year rule and said Cuba is ready to return to Latin American
political sphere.
   Culminating four days of effusive demonstrations of warmth and
support from Venezuelans who flocked to glimpse him wherever he
appeared, Castro spoke to a packed auditorium of journalists.
   ``I think my visit to Caracas for the first time in 30 years
shows that Cuba is ready, and Latin America is ready, for our
reintegration,'' said Castro.
   He visited Venezuela last in 1959, shortly after he seized power.
Relations between the countries quickly were strained when Castro
supported guerrillas trying to topple Venezuela's elected government
in the 1960s and early 1970s.
   Castro did not mention this support. All questions were submitted
beforehand, and Castro did not answer them all.
   He repeated his position that Cuba, if invited, would join the
Organization of American States.
   He said his visit to Caracas for the inauguration of Carlos
Andres Perez as Venezuela's president, along with visits to Peru and
Mexico for similar inaugurals last year, shows Cuba is being
accepted back into Latin American circles.
   ``Before I never got invited. Now I get invited,'' Castro said.
   He defended his length of time in power, the longest of any Latin
American dictator, saying he has less power inside Cuba then other
world leaders in their own countries.
   ``If you want to measure power, a U.S. president can start a
nuclear war without asking anybody,'' said Castro.
   He attacked the United States for its role in Latin America, but
praised the State Department for describing as worth studying a
recent proposal by El Salvadoran guerrillas to lay down their
weapons in exchange for a role in general elections.
   ``It's a sign of a better political will in the new Bush
administration'' said Castro.

   Paraguay's most popular radio station,
its biggest daily newspaper and a weekly known for irreverent
commentary plan to reopen now that Gen. Alfredo Stroessner has been
ousted from power.
   All were ordered closed by President Stroessner for various
reasons during the past five years, or harassed out of existence.
   ``Today we are free. We don't have equipment, we don't have news
teletypes, we don't have our own phones, but it feels great,'' said
Humberto Rubin, director of Radio Nanduti at the station's rundown
office.
   ``We want to keep going little by little, the same way democracy
is advancing in Paraguay,'' he said.
   Gen. Andres Rodriguez, commander of the powerful First Army
Corps, unseated Stroessner in a short, unexpected and violent coup
Thursday night and Friday morning. On Sunday, Stroessner was flown
to exile in Brazil.
   On Sunday, Rodriguez told reporters, ``I'm going to guarantee all
freedoms and total democracy.''
   Rubin _ and the directors of the daily newspaper ABC Color and
the weekly El Pueblo _ say they will take Rodriguez' word.
   ``We will demand that the words pronounced by Gen. Rodriguez .. .
become a reality,'' Rubin told listeners in his first broadcast
since he was forced off the air in January 1987.
   Rubin suspended operations when a strange jamming signal the
government said it could not identify came on whenever he broadcast
news or views the government didn't like. The signal eventually came
on most every time he appeared on the air, and finally during the
ads of local businesses who eventually withdrew their sponsorship.
   Rubin's debut Sunday was not without glitches. He battled
technical problems, unsuccessfully struggling to set up connections
for on-air interviews and at times playing music to cover up for
faulty microphones.
   ``The station may be falling to pieces, but its desire to
transmit is whole,'' he told an interviewer.
   ABC Color, which parlayed investigative journalism into a
circulation of 75,000, was closed outright in March 1984 for
allegedly provoking class hatred.
   The next edition will appear in about 30 days, said owner Aldo
Zuccolillo. Already, the editorial staff is swelling and the long
dormant newsroom beginning to bustle.
   El Pueblo is a feisty weekly newspaper published by the
Revolutionary Febrerista Party. It was shut down in August 1987,
accused of showing lack of respect for authority.
   Editor Raimundo Careaga says the paper will hit the streets
Tuesday.
   Before it was banned, El Pueblo published cartoons depicting
Stroessner as a decrepit dinosaur, his interior minister as a devil
with fangs dripping blood, and the Cabinet as a passal of raucous
schoolboys.

   Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, the
deposed dictator of Paraguay, has been granted temporary asylum in
Brazil but there is no limit on how long he can stay, officials said.
   Stroessner arrived Sunday evening in Campinas, 290 miles
southwest of Rio, on a Paraguay Airlines Boeing 707 flight with
about 20 family members and aides aboard from the Paraguayan capital
of Asuncion, officials said.
   The group was then taken by a Brazilian air force plane to the
small town of Itumbiara in the central Brazilian state of Goias.
   The Foreign Ministry said they were to spend the night in a guest
house owned by the government-run Furnas electric company, which
owns a hydroelectric power plant on the nearby Parnaiba river.
   A Foreign Ministry source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Stroessner owns property in the Itumbiara area and was to stay
in the guest house ``only temporarily.'' It was not known where
Stroessner would go after leaving the Furnas residence.
   The Foreign Ministry said the group included Stroessner's his son
and daughter-in-law, security guards, a Brazilian diplomat and
several other unidentified people.
   Although Stroessner, 76, eventually will have to find a permanent
home in another country, no limit was put on how long he might
remain in Brazil, said Jose Roberto Pinto, chief of the Brazilian
Embassy's political section in Asuncion.
   Stroessner, who ruled for 34 years, was derposed by his former
top commander, Gen. Andres Rodriguez, during a coup that began late
Thursday and reportedly left up to 300 dead.
   In an official note released by the Foreign Ministry Sunday,
Brazil said Paraguay had requested that Stroessner be granted asylum.
   ``In response to a request from the Paraguayan government, Brazil
has received the former President Alfredo Stroessner as a political
exile,'' the note released in federal capital of Brasilia said.
``The decision follows from Brazil's tradition of respecting the
right to political asylum and the norms on the subject set by
international law.''
   Press reports earlier speculated, Stroessner and his group could
be heading for the Atlantic coastal resort of Guaratuba in the
Brazilian state of Parana, where he owns a summer home.
   But Parana state governor Alvaro Dias told the Associated Press
he had received no notification from the Brazilian government of
Stroessner's arrival.
   ``I will be very sorry if Stroessner intends to set up residence
in Parana,'' Dias said from the state capital of Curitiba. ``We have
traditionally received political exiles fleeing from Stroessner's
34-year regime. We don't repudiate Stroessner as a human being but
for what he represents.''

   Joseph Raposo, a co-creator of the award-winning
children's program ``Sesame Street'' and a Grammy-winning composer,
died Sunday. He was 51.
   Raposo died at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, north of New York
City, from complications of malignant lymphoma. He would have turned
52 on Wednesday.
   Raposo won five Grammy awards during his career, produced several
gold and platinum records and received an Oscar nomination for music
he composed for the movie, ``The Great Muppet Caper.''
   Raposo's songs were recorded by Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand
and Ray Charles. His compositions include ``Sing,'' ``It's Not Easy
Being Green'' and ``Here's to the Winners.''
   He collaborated on the score of the Broadway musical ``You're a
Good Man, Charlie Brown.''
   At the time of his death, Raposo was musical director of ``Sesame
Street'' and was composing music for the show's 20th anniversary
celebration on public television.
   Raposo was co-creator of ``Sesame Street,'' along with Jim Henson
and Jon Stone, and wrote its theme song.
   He was born in Fall River, Mass., in 1937. His father, Joseph,
was a noted music director. After graduating from Harvard University
in 1958, Raposo studied composition with Nadia Boulanger in Paris.
   Raposo is survived by his parents, his wife, Pat Collins, and
their two children, Elizabeth, 12, and Andrew, 8. He also is
survived by two sons from a previous marriage, Joseph, 24, and
Nicolas, 20.

   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Dumas as saying,``I have
come to Tehran in hopes of improving relations between our two
countries to a desirable level.''
   Khamenei confirmed the possibility of establishing ``good, strong
relations, rooted in the historical ties between the two countries.''
   But newspaper and radio commentaries blasted French foreign
policy, pointing out that after the Soviet Union, France was Iraq's
second most important arms supplier.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in
Nicosia, said Dumas also met with Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani, believed to be the architect of Iran's new open-door
policy.
   Rafsanjani said that good ties between Tehran and Paris were
possible, adding that France's ``adoption of just stands at
international forums could be effective in furthering bilateral
ties,'' the Iranian news agency said.
   Dumas is due in Geneva Tuesday to address the opening session of
the 40-nation disarmament conference which is negotiating a
comprehensive ban on chemical weapons.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency said earlier that Dumas and his
60-member delegation were met by Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati on arrival at Mehrabad Airport.
   Dumas was expected to seek French participation in Iran's
reconstruction projects after the Aug. 20 cease-fire that halted its
devastating war with neighboring Iraq.
   Also on the agenda is a long-running dispute over a $1 billion
loan made by the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi before the
overthrow of the monarchy in 1979.
   Iran has demanded that France repay the loan plus interest
amounting to an additional $1 billion. France has agreed to pay the
initial amount in installments, but not the interest.
   French relations with Iran faltered after the overthrow of the
pro-Western monarchy. Diplomatic ties were severed in July 1987,
after a police siege of the Iranian embassy in Paris where a
translator wanted for questioning in connection with terrorist
bombings had taken refuge.
   Relations were restored 11 months later after the translator,
Wahid Gordji, appeared for a brief interrogation, and pro-Iranian
extremists freed French hostages held in Lebanon.

   Authorities on Sunday recovered the scuba
gear of a diver killed last week by a 20-foot long shark in the
Mediterranean, but found no traces of the deadly fish.
   Using underwater cameras, authorities located the two air tanks,
flippers and a weighted belt that Luciano Costanzo, 46, was wearing
when he was attacked on Thursday during a fishing outing off the
Tuscan coast.
   Port officials said divers retrieved the equipment on the sea
bottom, at a depth of about 25 feet. The Italian news agency ANSA
reported that the equipment bore holes and lacerations.
   The attack was witnessed by Costanzo's 19-year-old son, Gianluca,
and a friend. They reported that the fish, believed to be a great
white shark, circled twice before attacking the diver and pulling
him underneath the water.
   Numerous ships and helicopters have been scouring the area over
the past few days in search of the shark, but no sightings have been
reported.
   Sharks are common in the Mediterranean, but great white sharks
are considered rare. The last verified fatal shark attack off Italy
was nearly 30 years ago when an underwater photogapher was killed
near Naples.

<HEAD>Leader Warns About Country's Possible Economic Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party chief Stipe Suvar has
warned that the country may collapse unless it makes an economic
turnaround soon, the state news agency Tanjug reported Sunday.
   Addressing a meeting of young party activists and students
Saturday, Suvar said the country's main concern was how to check
spiraling inflation which last month hit 290 percent.
   ``Unless the galloping inflation is stopped this year, the
economy may collapse causing social explosion and catastrophic
consequences'' Tanjug quoted him as saying.
   Living standards have plummeted to half their level since 1980,
and long lines have been forming to purchase the cheap dark bread
that bakeries sell during the early morning hours.
   In addition, Yugoslavia owes $21 billion to foreign creditors and
has a 17 percent unemployment rate.
   Last week, the divided party leadership held a three-day session
but again failed to agree on how to heal the country's worsening
political and economic ills, despite warnings from the military that
it might become active in resolving the crisis.
   Suvar told the meeting Saturday that the party session ``should
have cut short all quarrels and social arguments.''
   ``All problems can be solved only if there is no bloodshed on a
nationalist basis,'' Politika Ekspres, a Belgrade daily, quoted him
as saying.
   The main clash at the session, which ended Wednesday, occurred
between factions advocating greater political pluralism and more
democracy and those favoring increased central party control to
overcome Yugoslavia's worst crisis.

<TEXT>
   Former President Alfredo Stroessner
boarded a jetliner at the airport that bears his name and flew to
Brazil, his 34-year-old grip on this nation ended by a military coup
that left hundreds dead.
   The new military ruler, Gen. Andres Rodriguez, announced that
elections for president and Congress will be held in 90 days.
   Stroessner led about 20 family members and aides up the steps to
the jet while onlookers at President Stroessner International
Airport jeered, clapped and chanted, ``Dictator Get Out!'' and
``Adios! Adios!''
   Stroessner landed at 5:55 p.m. (3:55 p.m. EST) in Campinas, 290
miles southwest of Rio de Janeiro, on a Paraguay Airlines Boeing
707, then left on another aircraft for the small town of Itumbiara
in the central Brazilian state of Goias, Brazilian sources said.
   A foreign ministry source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Stroessner, who has property in the area, was to stay in
Itumbiara ``only temporarily.''
   Temporary asylum was granted to Stroessner and his son, Gustavo,
who was considered Stroessner's heir apparent. Also granted asylum
were Gustavo's wife, Maria; six security guards and ex-Foreign
Minister Rodney Elpidio Acevedo, said Jose Roberto Pinto, chief of
the Brazilian Embassy's political section in Asuncion.
   While Stroessner eventually will have to find a permanent home in
another country, no limit was put on how long he might remain in
Brazil, Pinto said.
   Stroessner came to power as a general in a coup in 1954 and
remained commander-in-chief of Paraguay's armed forces until
Thursday night, when Rodriguez led the coup against him. Rodriguez
was sworn in as president on Friday.
   The two are linked by the marriage of Stroessner's son Alfredo
and Rodriguez' daughter Marta, and share grandchildren.
   As he left his country for perhaps the last time, the 76-year-old
Stroessner wore a blue suit and red tie. He did not acknowledge the
crowd and made no final gesture.
   The two black limousines that carried Stroessner's entourage to
the airport were accompanied by truckloads of soldiers in combat
gear.
   Stroessner had been under house arrest near the capital since he
was captured early Friday after a night of fighting. The death toll
from the coup has been estimated at up to 300, but no official
figures have been given.
   A funeral Mass for the victims was celebrated Sunday evening.
   ``I have been in the hospitals. I have seen the young boys,'' the
Archbishop Ismael Rolon of Asuncion, said at packed San Roque
Church. ``Let us hope that the blood that was shed will help build a
new Paraguay.''
   Mass celbrants, which included Rodriguez, erupted in applause.
   Rodriguez arrived at the airport shortly before Stroessner took
off and spoke briefly with reporters.
   ``I'm going to guarantee all freedoms and total democracy,'' he
said. Asked how, he replied, ``I will call general elections in 90
days.''
   Earlier, Foreign Minister Luis Maria Argana discussed the
election plans with reporters at Campo Grande army base. He was
accompanied by Rodriguez, who did not say if he would run for
president.
   ``Within a few days, we will decree a new election law and a new
electoral system which will dissolve both houses of Congress, and
call for elections within three months dating from last Friday,''
said Argana.
   Stroessner was elected president eight times, the last time in
February 1988. Opposition groups said all the elections were
fraudulent.
   Under current law, the ruling Colorado Party is guaranteed
two-thirds control of Congress, with the remaining third split
between the two other political parties recognized by the former
government.
   Argana said the government will recognize opposition parties,
including the Authentic Radical Liberal Party and the Christian
Democrat Party, and allow them to participate in the elections.
   Washington so far has withheld official comment on Rodriguez. A
Western diplomat said Saturday that there were reports in Paraguay
that Rodriguez allowed drug traffickers to use his air strip.
   Meanwhile, Paraguay's most popular radio station, Radio Nanduti;
its biggest daily newspaper, ABC Color; and a weekly known for
irreverent commentary, El Pueblo; all announced plans to reopen now
that Stroessner has been ousted from power.
   All were ordered closed by Stroessner for various reasons during
the past five years, or harassed out of existence.
   ``Today we are free. We don't have equipment, we don't have news
teletypes, we don't have our own phones, but it feels great,'' said
Humberto Rubin, director of Radio Nanduti at the station's rundown
office.

<TEXT>
   Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia's best known
dissident, praised hundreds of people who signed a letter appealing
to the government to release him, his brother said Sunday.
   ``I am greatly moved and strengthened by these statements and
expressions of solidarity,'' Havel, 52, said in a brief message read
by telephone from Prague by his brother Ivan.
   ``It is not only important for me, but this also signifies the
increase of independent spiritual attitude and the growing of civil
courage in our society,'' the message said.
   Ivan Havel declined to say how the message reached him from the
dissident, detained in a prison in the country's capital.
   Havel, a banned playwright and a political theorist, has been
held since he and two other activists were arrested at a Jan. 16
rally
   Czechoslovak intellectuals sent a letter to Premier Ladislav
Adamec last month asking for the release of Havel and also urging
authorities to open talks immediately with independent groups and
disillusioned youths.
   The letter has been signed by at least 1,000 people to date. It
said the signers were ``disturbed and offended'' by the way
Czechoslovakia's official media reported on demonstrations in Prague
marking the death of Jan Palach, a student who burned himself to
death to protest the Soviet-led invasion in August 1968.
   In Warsaw, Poland, the National Executive Commission of the
banned trade union Solidarity on Sunday called on Czechoslovak
authorities to release all political prisoners, specifically naming
Havel, and begin talks with independent groups.
   Solidarity begins talks with Poland's communist government Monday.
   Havel has participated in meetings between Polish and
Czechoslovak intellectuals at undisclosed locations along the border
between the two countries.

   Church services were called off in some Arkansas towns Sunday
because of icy roads and the arctic air mass rewrote more low
temperature records, but part of Montana warmed above zero for the
first time in nearly a week.
   The cold chased Mardi Gras revelers in New Orleans into warm
bars; marching bands at a Winter Carnival parade in St. Paul, Minn.,
couldn't put their instruments to their lips, and members of a
nudist colony in Texas had to put their clothes on.
   A boy was buried for an hour in a Colorado avalanche; Chicago's
O'Hare International Airport closed two runways because of heavy
snow; and California farmers received frost warnings.
   At least 32 deaths had been blamed on the weather since arctic
air that set low temperature records across Alaska slid into the
Lower 48 states Tuesday. In addition, four teen-agers competing in a
Wisconsin ice fishing derby were found dead Sunday, overcome by
carbon monoxide fumes from heaters in their fishing shack.
   Bozeman, outside Montana's warming eastern half, was the cold
spot of the lower 48 states Sunday morning at 43 degrees below zero.
   Roads were icy in much of the south-central section of the
nation, and many Arkansas churches called off services.
   ``We had been out on the roads, and the flat places seemed OK,
but the hills were more difficult,'' said the Rev. Paul Weeks in
Little Rock. ``We feel like our people can worship at home today,
spend some time reading their Bible or watching television services.
We don't want to risk their safety.''
   Low-temperature records toppled or were tied at 26 cities from
northern California through the Northwest into Montana, and in the
southern and western Plains. Ely, Nev., hit 27 degrees below zero, a
February record and just one degree above the town's all-time low.
Denver hit 24 below zero, the coldest the city's been in 26 years.
   In Montana, the temperature hit 10 degrees at Havre by 9 a.m.,
although the wind chill factor was well below zero. Southern and
western Montana remained below zero as cold air was trapped in
mountain valleys.
   Nome, Alaska, which hit an all-time high of 54 below zero last
month, warmed to 30 degrees.
   Two women were hospitalized with frostbite at Kansas City, Mo.,
after riding in a boxcar for 2{ days with only some blankets and a
frozen gallon of milk. They and four others said they were trying to
reach a relative in Washington, D.C.
   ``They were just froze,'' said Ida Barry, assistant manager of a
restaurant in Kansas City where they were taken.
   In Colorado, a 6-year-old boy was rescued from an avalanche
Sunday at Mount Crested Butte, in the central Rockies, after being
trapped for more than an hour. Three children were buried in the
snowslide but two apparently managed to escape, police said. It was
not known if the boy suffered any injuries, officials said.
   The National Weather Service said more than 125 avalanches were
reported in Colorado by Sunday afternoon and warned there was an
extreme hazard because of recent heavy snows.
   In Chicago, O'Hare International Airport closed two runways
Sunday for snow plowing, said United Airlines spokeswoman Mary
Swanson.
   The airline canceled 40 flights, or 25 percent of its schedule,
from 6:30 p.m. to midnight Sunday, Swanson said. Some flights were
delayed for up to two hours.
   Wind eased Sunday in eastern Idaho and stranded travelers took
advantage of the lull in drifting snow to leave the small cattle
town of Dubois. Clark County Sheriff Craig King said about 150
people were snowbound there last week when a storm closed Interstate
15, and estimated that 75 remained until Sunday.
   ``It happens to us once in a while here,'' King said. ``They
close the interstate off. People are good to open up their homes for
them.''
   Freeze warnings for crops such as citrus fruits and strawberries
were posted in many areas in California on Sunday as arctic air
promised to send temperatures plunging overnight.
   Southern California Edison crews worked through the weekend to
restore power to 81,000 customers whose power was interrupted by
high winds in the eastern deserts and by snow in the mountains, said
spokesman Steve Hansen.
   New Orleans French Quarter establishments did brisk business with
revelers trying to cope with unseasonably low temperatures in the
40s. Mardi Gras is Tuesday.
   ``We've got a few more (customers) than would be otherwise. And
they drink more hot chocolate when it's cold,'' said George Barclay,
night manager at the Cafe du Monde.
   Far, far to the north, where people brag that they're used to the
cold, Saturday's Torchlight Parade at the St. Paul, Minn., Winter
Carnival was the coldest in 20 years, at 9 below zero. Police
estimated 25,000 people showed up anyway.
   ``No matter how cold it gets, there's always so much excitement.
It gets my adrenalin flowing and my blood bubbling. I have to start
taking stuff off,'' said parade chairman Mark Simons.
   However, the nine bands in the parade marched only one block of
the 10-block route, just enough for the TV cameras, and instrument
mouthpieces were taped so they wouldn't freeze to players' lips.
   The cold and snow in the northern Plains and Rockies have been a
burden for stockmen, who have been unable to get feed to their
animals.
   ``The cattle are really having a tough time,'' said King, the
sheriff in Idaho. ``They're finding them with their jaws frozen shut
and their eyes froze shut. I just got off the phone with one fellow
who hasn't seen his cows since Monday.''
   In Decatur, Texas, 60 miles northwest of Dallas, the cold kept
members of the Bluebonnet Nudist Park from practicing their
lifestyle this weekend.
   ``Unfortunately, we nudists have to put it on hold for a few
days,'' said park manager Arthur Moss. ``As nudists, we're generally
a sensible lot.''
   About 20 school districts in northern Texas may have to close
indefinitely because Lone Star Gas Co. cut back on service to ensure
enough fuel for homes and businesses.
   ``We're not running out of gas, but we're making sure our
supplies will be adequate,'' said Howard Matson, Lone Star's
director of communication. He said Southern Methodist University
also would have its gas cut 90 percent.

<HEAD>Industrial Output Down in January, But in Wrong Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrial output fell nearly 11 percent in
January from one month earlier in the sharpest drop since the
government began its austerity drive last fall, an official report
said Sunday.
   However, the drop was concentrated in areas where critical
shortages already exist _ energy, steel and raw materials _ as well
as daily commodities such as cotton, the Xinhua News Agency said.
   This will ``pose a threat to industrial development in the next
few months,'' it said. Many factories already are forced to shut
down two to four days a week because of shortages of energy and raw
materials such as steel, items whose production the government wants
expanded.
   Production of color televisions, refrigerators and other
household appliances was up, the report said, but gave no figures.
   Xinhua said industrial output totaled $26 billion in January,
down 10.9 percent from December but up 8.2 percent from January
1988. The government has said it wants to cut industrial growth to
about 10 percent this year, down from 17.7 percent for all of 1988.
   The government has blamed the rapid growth of the past few years
for inflation that economists privately peg at about 40 percent.
Officials said prices rose 18.5 percent in 1988, but also said in
October that the price index was up 26 percent over the previous
October.
   As the spiraling prices triggered public discontent, authorities
ordered cuts in September in bank loans, capital construction and
local government spending as anti-inflation moves.
   They also tried to control in the mushroom-like growth of small
rural factories, which now number more than 15 million. They have
both siphoned raw materials and energy away from larger, state-run
factories and put the state-run factories to shame with their
greater productivity.
   But local authorities have tried to shield their lucrative
factories from the impact of the new tight-money policy, and Xinhua
said rural industry actually increased output by 25 percent in
January over December.
   It said rural factories accounted for one-eighth of January's
total industrial output. State-owned factories increased output by
an average of 3.7 percent, Xinhua said.
   As the austerity policies begin to take effect, some economists
have worried that they will result in stagnant economic growth plus
inflation, experienced in many Western countries in the 1970s.

<TEXT>
   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
thanked elderly Japanese immigrants Sunday for helping pave the way
for his country's rise as a world power, and offered $8,000 of his
own money to rebuild their earthquake-shattered retirement home.
   A smiling Takeshita spoke warmly in Japanese to more than 100
elderly residents, many holding small Japanese and American flags,
at the Japanese Retirement Home, a non-profit facility in heavily
Hispanic Boyle Heights east of the Little Tokyo district.
   ``He said America and Japan will become closer friends,''
translated Jim Yamasaki, a clerk at the home. ``He said: `We owe it
all to the Isei (first-generation immigrants). You are the pioneers,
the people who built the foundation on which Japan stands.'''
   Takeshita referred to Japan's strength in commerce and its
success in exports to the United States, said Michio Katsumata of
The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a Japanese economic journal.
   The prime minister praised the good citizenship of
Japanese-Americans _ despite what he called their ``hard times''
during World War II when many were interned in camps _ as
contributing to Japan's strong relationship with America, Katsumata
said.
   ``It was nothing political ... a soft, gentle message to the old
people,'' Yamasaki said.
   Takeshita also presented a white-wrapped parcel that, according
to translators, he said contained his ``pocket money'' or ``spending
money.''
   It contained 1 million yen, about $8,000, apparently of the prime
minister's own money, said Edwin Hiroto, chief executive officer of
Keiro Services, which runs the home.
   The money will help fund construction of a 154-bed wing being
built to replace another wing damaged in the October 1987 Whittier
earthquake, Hiroto said.
   Takeshita arrived in Los Angeles Friday night after a Washington
visit with President Bush at which he declared Japan's intention to
broaden its involvement in international affairs.
   He is scheduled to meet with former President Ronald Reagan on
Monday before departing for Japan.
   Security was lavish at the center. Dozens of motorcycle officers
lined the block fronting the auditorium where Takeshita spoke.
   During a 45-minute visit conducted in Japanese, Takeshita was
greeted by a 105-year-old resident of the home, Mamoru Eto, who
fought in Japan's turn-of-the-century war with Russia.
   Residents bowed together, then offered a nostalgic song about
one's hometown, and another about orange blossoms.
   ``They're songs they remember from their childhood,'' Hiroto said.
   The prime minister thanked the chorus for bringing back memories
of songs he remembered from his childhood, also.

<TEXT>
   Satellite television beamed directly into British
homes for the first time on Sunday, but only a small fraction of
viewers could tune in.
   At 6 p.m., all four channels of publisher Rupert Murdoch's Sky
Television began broadcasting signals bounced off the Astra
satellite parked in orbit above central Africa.
   Murdoch boasts he's bringing American-style ``competition, choice
and quality'' to British television, which has only four land-based
channels _ two commercial and two operated by the state-financed
British Broadcasting Corp.
   ``I watch a lot of television in America and I enjoy it, much
more than coming here late at night and turning on snooker,'' he
told a news conference. Coverage of the game snooker is one of the
few available nighttime programs in Britain.
   Sky News kicked off with a newscast featuring what it said were
two world exclusives, a report on Britons selling their kidneys and
a cancer scare for a convicted murderess.
   The sports channel led off with Davis Cup tennis, ``Project X''
was the first movie shown on Sky Movies, and Sky Channel, the light
entertainment channel, began with a 30-minute feature on the birth
of Sky Television.
   No one knows for certain exactly how many viewers were able to
watch Sunday's launch.
   The government says only 7,000 people have the licenses needed to
operate satellite-receiving dishes from their homes, out of a
population of 56 million. Sky Television says thousands more can
receive some, or all, of the channels on cable.
   Dish manufacturers say it will be weeks, if not months, before
they can supply stores with the equipment. But Murdoch said within
three months stores would be receiving 100,000 dishes a month.
   Murdoch said the subscription channels need to attract about 1.5
million viewers before they start making money.

   They couldn't see the gaudy floats in the
Mardi Gras parade or the plastic beads and aluminum doubloons flung
toward them Sunday, but the group from the Louisiana Center for the
Blind had a blast.
   ``It's a lot of fun. Time just to cut loose and anything goes,''
said Ernestine Morais, of Central, Calif.
   The 15 adult students and seven staff members _ two sighted who
drove the vans _ were only a few of the thousands who lined parade
routes in cold, gray weather to see the 11 parades rolling through
metropolitian New Orleans on Sunday.
   The parades included the popular Bacchus, which named comedian
Billy Crystal as this year's god of wine and revelry. He threw
double handfuls of doubloons at the sea of arms below him, stopping
only to pull out a camera to make home videos of the crowd.
   There was a serious purpose to the school's trip, said center's
director, Joanne Fernandez. That was helping students learn to
navigate through crowds, she said.
   ``This is one of our biggest confidence builders,'' Fernandez
said. ``Mardi Gras is the ultimate. If you can travel through a
Mardi Gras crowd, you can go through any crowd and you can go to any
place.''
   It was cloudy and drizzling Sunday with temperatures in the 40s.
Near freezing temperatures were predicted overnight, getting a
little colder Monday and Fat Tuesday, said the National Weather
Service.
   Parade-watchers bundled up but enjoyed themselves. Sometimes,
people in the blind group would take off their heavy gloves to
search for a string of beads or other parade baubles.
   The group had staked out a spot right behind the police
barricades on the street's median. Like the sighted people around
them, they were grabbing for the plastic beads, doubloons and other
trinkets.
   ``This is the kind of souvenir shopping I can afford,'' said Ms.
Morais.
   When a doubloon clanged on the street in front of the barricade,
long white canes poked out toward it, sweeping the street until one
touched the coin and pulled it in. Beads hit the ground and several
people quickly knelt, their hands sweeping around until one person
called out, ``I have it!''
   Some sighted people in the crowd took their own beads and tossed
them into the little group. Others reached through the groping hands
to grab beads for themselves.
   The crowd surged into the French Quarter between parades, ready
to rock on Bourbon Street.
   One rider in an afternoon parade was injured and knocked
unconscious for several minutes when he fell from a float and hit
his head and shoulder, said police spokesman John Bryson. It was the
weekend's second parade-related injury.
   New Orleans police estimated this will be the biggest Mardi Gras
ever, with 1.7 million revelers lining the streets and jamming the
French Quarter on Fat Tuesday, the last blowout before the solemn
season of Lent. Authorities said 1.5 million people attended the
1988 celebration.
   The long Carnival weekend got under way Saturday, highlighted by
the ``super parade'' of Endymion with celebrity riders, pop singers
Daryl Hall and John Oates and child television star Fred Savage of
``The Wonder Years,'' on giant, animated floats.

   Police shut down the largest exhibition of
avant-garde art in Communist China's history on Sunday, the day it
opened, after artists defied a ban on performance art and a man shot
a sculpture with a BB gun.
   Fei Dawei, an exhibition organizer, said the show would most
likely reopen on Friday. ``They are just punishing us for the
trouble we caused,'' he said.
   As police closed the show shortly before noon on Sunday, hundreds
of spectators and artists spilled into the courtyard in front of the
China Art Gallery.
   At one point, two carloads of riot police, wearing helmets and
toting automatic weapons and tear gas canisters, drove into the
crowd. They left immediately after their cars were surrounded by
curious onlookers.
   ``That must be performance art, too,'' said one artist.
   Several artists accused the Public Security Bureau of using the
shooting incident as an excuse to shut the exhibition, which was
approved by the government after three years of debate.
   ``We have given them all the justification they need to shut us
down,'' said Su Liqin, an artist in the show. ``This is a sad day
for art in China.''
   Police refused to respond to the charges.
   ``The show has been closed because of problems,'' said a police
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Other than that, we
have no comment.'' He said to come back Tuesday, the next day the
gallery is scheduled to be open, to ``see what happens.''
   The exhibit of more than 250 works, covering three floors of the
gallery, included sculpture, pen-and-ink drawing, video art and oil
painting. Artists came from all over China.
   The show began on a somber note. In the center of the gallery's
main hall, organizers had constructed a black coffin, on top of
which was written: ``This exhibition is in honor of all the Chinese
artists who gave their lives for modern art.''
   But the show soon took on a defiant tone as artists began to
break a ban on performance art.
   In one corner, a man with shoulder-length hair whipped out boxes
of frozen shrimp and began doing a quick business. Museum officials
told him to stop.
   Wu Shanzhuan said he was selling his goods to ``protest the
commercialization of art in China.''
   Then three individuals wrapped from head to toe in white cloth
entered the hall, bumping into spectators.
   ``This is art's lot in China,'' said one. ``It's tied up.''
   Museum officials ordered them to leave.
   Another artist began tossing handfuls of condoms and money on the
floor as viewers gaped in disbelief.
   Wang Deren said he ``just wanted to help China's family planning
program.'' He appeared to be joking.
   Police told Wang to pick up the condoms and leave.
   The last performance came shortly before noon, when a man and a
woman entered the first floor hall and stood in front of the woman's
sculpture, a phone booth.
   Exhibition officials initially said the woman, Xiao Lu, an artist
from Hangzhou, shot her work of art.
   But Fei said police have determined that her boyfriend, Tang
Song, actually fired two BBs into the work. Police detained Tang at
the show and found Ms. Xiao later.
   ``What we know now is that they walked into the gallery, she
handed him the gun and he shot her artwork,'' he said. ``It was a
performance art piece. Together they were attempting to negate
modern civilization.''
   For decades, art in China was strictly controlled by the state,
and works that did not serve the interests of the Communist Party
were not welcome. Recently, some cracks in China's cultural monolith
have appeared.
   Last month, two nude exhibitions were held at the China Art
Gallery, after years of being banned by the puritanical party.
Smaller galleries are showing experimental art.
   Organizers said modern artists, who have held small individual
shows, have been trying to hold a large exhibition in China since
1985 but have been held up by conservative bureaucrats.
   They said this exhibition, originally scheduled to last until
Feb. 19, was given the go-ahead only after organizers raised all the
money themselves.
   Even then, several of the works were censored or altered before
the show began.
   One work, based on Leonardo da Vinci's ``The Last Supper'' with
Mao Tse-tung as Jesus Christ, was banned.

<HEAD>NRA Uses Shooting Match To Argue Against Gun Bans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINDEN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Rifle Association invited
Stockton officials to a shooting match Sunday in a last-ditch effort
to stop a local ban on semiautomatic assault rifles.
   Organizers of the target shooting competition hoped to show that
assault rifles, such as the AK-47 rifle used in the Jan. 17 Stockton
school massacre, have legitimate sporting uses, said J.P. Nelson, an
NRA field representative.
   The twice-monthly contest was scheduled before gunman Patrick
Purdy used the AK-47 rifle to kill five children and injure 30
others at Cleveland Elementary School, before killing himself with a
handgun, Nelson said.
   Sixty-nine people competed in the match at the San Joaquin Rifle
&amp; Pistol Range, located 12 miles east of Stockton. Guns used at the
contest included AR-15, M-1 and AK-47 rifles.
   Only one Stockton school official accepted the invitation and
showed up to watch the target shooting, Nelson said.
   ``He didn't sound like one of our better friends,'' Nelson said.
   The Stockton City Council is expected to ban sales of
semiautomatic weapons within city limits on Monday.
   Several state legislators also have proposed statewide
restrictions following the Stockton school shooting and an increase
in drive-by shootings by gangs armed with semiautomatic firearms.
   Such restrictions would only affect law-abiding gun owners, not
criminals, Nelson said.
   ``You're not going to be able to legislate crazy people sane,''
he said.

<HEAD>Fire Marshal: Dispute Over Crack Use Leads To Fatal Torching Of Husband</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man died Sunday after his wife doused him with
paint thinner and set him on fire during an argument the couple were
having over her alleged use of crack, said a Fire Department
spokesman.
   Gary Tate, 41, died at New York Hospital, where he was taken
after the torching Saturday in the hallway outside their Brooklyn
apartment, said the spokesman, John Mulligan.
   Tate's wife, Jessie, 38, was also at the hospital with burns to
the right hand and arm suffered during the 6 p.m. incident at a
housing project, he said. She was placed under guard at the
hospital's burn center, where she was listed in stable condition.
   She was charged by the fire marshal's office with second-degree
attempted murder, second-degree arson and second-degree assault,
Mulligan said. It was expected that the charges against her would be
upgraded to reflect Tate's death, he said.
   ``Their whole dispute was about her alleged smoking (of) crack,''
Mulligan said.
   Mrs. Tate apparently became so enraged during the argument that
she doused her husband ``from head to foot'' and ignited a rolled up
paper bag, which she used as a torch to set him on fire as they
stood in the hallway, Mulligan said.
   The husband ran into their apartment, where he jumped into the
bathtub and turned on the water to put out the flames, but not
before the fire caused burns over 96 percent of his body, the
spokesman said.
   He said Mrs. Tate's injuries were caused when she accidentally
spilled a small amount of paint thinner on herself while pouring it
over her husband.

   William Forrest, a former star
athlete who appeared in nearly 200 films and on television's ``The
Adventures of Rin Tin Tin,'' has died at age 86.
   Forrest, who died Jan. 29, often played the pleasant but stern
military officer in World War II films.
   He appeared in nearly 200 films over 30 years, including ``Here
Comes Mr. Jordan,'' ``Miracle on 34th Street'' and ``They Died With
Their Boots On.'' His last feature was believed to be ``The Marriage
of a Young Stockbroker'' in 1971.
   A standout athlete at Princeton University, Forrest began acting
in 1938 at the Pasadena Playhouse and the next year made his first
motion picture, ``Lone Wolf Meets Lady.''
   For many years, he averaged five or more films a year.
   He also played the fort commander on television's ``The
Adventures of Rin Tin Tin'' from 1954 to 1959.
   Forrest is survived by his wife, Wilhelmina, two sons, a daughter
and four grandchildren.

   The crew of the shuttle Discovery,
whose mission has been delayed until mid-March, arrived at Kennedy
Space Center Sunday to participate in a practice countdown.
   Meanwhile, workers at the launch pad prepared to replace
turbopumps in the shuttle's three main engines. They also struggled
to make Discovery's cargo, a $100 million satellite, fit into the
payload bay.
   The five astronauts swooped over the space center in T-38
military jets and touched down at the shuttle runway Sunday
afternoon.
   Sunny skies and temperatures in the 80s greeted the astronauts,
who wriggled out of their heavy flight jackets as soon as they
climbed out of the two-seater jets.
   Shuttle commander Michael Coats commended the efforts of
engineers and technicians who are replacing the three high-pressure
oxygen turbopumps, which they fear could crack and cause an
explosion in flight.
   The turbopumps were manufactured by the same process as one
turbopump on the shuttle Atlantis, which cracked during the December
shuttle mission.
   Investigators blamed moisture for that crack and recommended that
Discovery turbopumps be replaced as a safety precaution.
   The decision to replace the turbopumps forced NASA to delay
Discovery's flight, which originally would have taken off last week.
   ``We know how hard everbody's been working and how much work
there is to do, and we certainly appreciate all the work that is
being done.'' Coats told reporters gathered at the shuttle runway.
   Within an hour, Coats and his crew had taken a practice drive in
a small armored tank designed to evacuate the launch pad in an
emergency.
   Coats and shuttle pilot John E. Blaha then boarded a shuttle
training jet for landing practice.
   Monday's activities include emergency escape drills at the launch
pad. Tuesday morning, Coats, Blaha and mission specialists Robert C.
Springer, James F. Buchli and James P. Bagian will board Discovery
for a dress rehearsal of launch morning.

   A subcompact car traveling in the wrong

family members, the state highway patrol reported.
   ``The driver of an 18-wheeler, who was traveling behind the car,
said they had weaved a few times and they might have been sleepy or
fatigued,'' Patrol spokesman Joe Gazzo said.
   Michael Asa Engine, 23, of Mobile, Ala., and four family members

said. The four others, including an infant, were not immediately
identified, Gazzo said.
   The driver of the van, 36-year-old Bobbie Allen Levinski of St.
Elmo, Ala., was treated for minor injuries at the George County
Infirmary in Lucedale and released.
   Gazzo said there had been a light drizzle, but the roads weren't

<HEAD>Spooked Elephant Takes Riders On Wild Ride</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 4-ton elephant broke loose from a
petting zoo at the Southwest Florida Fair, tore through a crowded
midway and plunged into a lake with three terrified riders aboard.
   ``We were afraid he was going to kill us _ stomp on us,'' said
Consolacion Cruz of Alva, who clutched her 4-year-old godson and his
18-year-old aunt on the wild ride Saturday.
   The 15-year-old female elephant used for paid rides apparently
became spooked and bolted from the zoo. That sent fairgoers
scambling to get out of the animal's way.
   At least eight people were sent to local hospitals with minor
back injuries and grease burns from toppled concession stands.
   After the elephant plunged into the midway lake, spilling its
riders, the animal jumped from the water and lumbered onward,
crashing into more concession stands.
   Carl Patinella, 48, of New Jersey, never saw the elephant
barreling toward his fried dough stand, named ``Elephant Ears.''
   ``If I'd seen it coming I probably would've had a heart attack,''
Patinella said. ``He almost turned the stand over.'' Patinella's
wife suffered burns on her arms from the hot grease that sloshed
from the fryer, and Patinella wrenched his back in the sudden jolt.
   Joe Frisco, an elephant caretaker, managed to grab a chest strap
and slow the elephant until she trampled on a water tube. A gyser of
water shot skyward, spooking the elephant once more. And the chase
was on again as she crashed into a corn dog stand. Finally, Frisco
was able to stop the animal and guide her back to the corral.
   Speculating about the cause of Kelly's rampage, Frisco said,
``She had to be hit with a pellet gun or something. She'd never done
this before in 15 years.''
   Ms. Cruz, who slipped below the surface of the lake four times
and lost consciousness had to be rescued, but her 4-year-old godson,
Pascual Cortez, and the child's aunt, Lucy Hernandez, were able to
swim to shore safely.

   A 3-ton elephant knocked down and then fatally
crushed an animal handler at Busch Gardens Sunday in what police
called ``an act of elephant aggression.''
   Joe Allen, 33, was returning the 17-year-old, male breeding
elephant to its barn at about 2:30 p.m. when the handler was knocked
down and the animal then used its head to crush the man with its
full weight, said Sgt. James Preston.
   ``It's an act of elephant aggression,'' Preston said. Trainers
told police the head-crush maneuver is an offensive technique used
by elephants in the wild.
   The man was pronounced dead at Tampa General Hospital.
   Busch Gardens officials could not be reached by telephone Sunday
night. Wild animals are a featured attraction at the amusement park.

   The man in charge of President Bush's ethics
policy has found himself in the midst of a possible
conflict-of-interest controversy because of his chairmanship of a
multimillion dollar communications company.
   C. Boyden Gray, who served as Bush's counsel when he was vice
president and continues to serve in that capacity now that Bush is
president, has told The Washington Post and The New York Times that
he plans to continue serving as chairman of the family-owned
company, Atlanta-based Summit Communications Group Inc.
   During his eight years as the vice president's counsel, Gray
served as the paid chairman of the company, earning several hundred
thousand dollars and reporting that on his annual financial
disclosure forms. He told the newspapers that starting at the
beginning of this year, he no longer was accepting fees for that job.
   ``Due to my promotion and due to the policies enunciated by
(Bush) during the presidential campaign, I cannot and I will not
take outside income and so have instructed the family company,''
Gray told the Post.
   Gray also said he could function without any conflict of interest
both because he has recused himself since 1981 from any matters
concerning communications and because he was not Summit's chief
executive or operating officer. He said he only devoted four to six
days a year to overseeing the company.

<HEAD>Buffalo Bank, Down on Its Luck, Struggles Like City Once Did</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DARREN DOPP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the early 1980s, Goldome bankers looked
out their windows and saw a dismal panorama of urban decay.
   A seedy collection of bars, peep shows and drug paraphernalia
shops dotted Buffalo's largely dilapidated and abandoned downtown.
Goldome's $55 million, 12-story glass tower was one of the few
symbols of hope in an old industrial city ravaged by plant closings.
   Today there is a shiny subway-trolley system that stops near
Goldome and unloads smartly dressed couples catching dinner before a
show in the theater district or at the new cinema arcade, which
features 12 films.
   Now when the executives look outside they see new offices, busy
stores and lots of people. But inside Goldome's office, there is a
company almost as down on its luck as the city was a few years ago.
   After a quick rise from local savings bank to $15 billion
financial services company with operations in two dozen states,
Goldome has faltered and lost more than $56 million in the first
three quarters of 1988, partly as a result of troubled thrifts it
acquired in years past.
   Goldome is expected to release 1988 fourth quarter and yearend
results this week and analysts predict more red ink.
   The company's stock has dropped from the $7 per share offering
price when it went public in 1987 to $2.25 this past week.
   Adding insult to injury, Fortune magazine recently named Goldome
as the seventh least-admired company in America. Goldome ranked
300th out of 305 companies as a long-term investment and 289th in
community responsibility.
   The latter ranking especially stung Goldome officials, who point
out that Chairman Ross B. Kenzie was a key player in downtown
redevelopment and someone who consistently urged Buffalo residents
not to lose confidence in their city.
   The company now seems to be in the same position the city once
was _ in desperate need of someone to believe in its future.
   ``It's no secret we've had losses, but we've also taken steps to
turn the company around,'' said company spokesman Marc Chodorow.
``The public's perception just hasn't kept pace with what we've been
doing.''
   Goldome has cut $20 million from its budget by a 10 percent
workforce reduction and by shrinking executive benefits.
   The company has sold 11 New York City branches with $1.2 billion
in deposits to Manufacturers Hanover Corp. for $65 million.
   It also has begun a thorough evaluation of its business and urged
employees to offer new ideas to raise money, Chodorow said.
   Not all those ideas have been well-received, however. Attorneys
general in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia raised questions
about Goldome attempts to drum up business by selling certificates
of deposit in department stores.
   The company suspended sales briefly and was required to make
modifications. Chodorow said the practice is successful.
   Although the company has made some progress, analysts say it is
still wrangling with its underlying problem: the unprofitable
banking subsidiaries it acquired during the early 1980s.
   Goldome wasn't the only banking concern that grew by acquiring
others. At the time, federal regulators were only too happy to have
healthy banks take over troubled operations in the savings &amp; loan
industry. The problem was few people gave much thought to the
long-term viability of combined businesses.
   The assets of the troubled thrifts consisted of fixed mortgages
with low interest rates; their liabilities were short-term deposits
paying high interest rates. When interest rates began to rise in the
spring of 1987, Goldome's expenses surged and profits disappeared.
   In addition, many of the investments its acquisitions had made in
commercial real estate went bad, leaving the company stuck with
repossessed property worth less than the value of the loans.
   Although Chodorow said Goldome is making progress in turning
around its overall business, industry analysts say the company will
have to make other major steps soon to return to profitability.
   Roger Powell, an analyst for Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. in
Baltimore, says Goldome needs to take ``dramatic action,'' like
selling off more bank operations.

<HEAD>American, Delta Announce Partnership To Market Global Reservations
Network</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 2 grafs with further details.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines and American Airlines announced
Sunday they were joining their global computerized reservations
under a new partnership.
   Under the agreement, each airline will contribute its existing
system to the new joint venture _ American's SABRE and Delta's DATAS
II. Delta, whose system is the smaller of the two, will pay American
$650 million.
   The two airlines, who currently have the only major single-owner
reservations systems, said in an announcement the new system should
stimulate competition.
   Computerized reservation systems are used throughout the world
for reserving airline seats, rental cars and lodging, as well as for
other travel services and management information services.
   There are currently five such systems in the United States and
six elsewhere around the world, the airlines said.
   Under the American-Delta deal, each airline will own half of the
system. Other carriers, both international and domestic, will have a
chance to buy in, but Delta and American would see their shares fall
to no less than 25 percent each.
   Max D. Hopper, American's senior vice president for information
services, will be chairman of the partnership, and the company will
be based in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, headquarters of American.
   Details of the new partnership will be filed with the U.S.
Justice Department on Monday, the airlines said.
   Reservation systems owned by single airlines have been criticized
by the federal government as giving owner-carriers an unfair
advantage over other airlines that do not have such systems.
   Delta and American said that combining their systems would
eliminate that criticism.

<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Motors Corp. said Sunday it
was restructuring its vehicle engineering operations to focus
product development on an entire vehicle rather than its individual
components.
   Chrysler Motors is Chrysler Corp.'s automaking arm.
   ``This new structure will enable us to be more vehicle-oriented
instead of being component-driven,'' Francois J. Castaing, Chrysler
Motors vice president for vehicle engineering, said in a statement.
   ``We'll be looking at our vehicles as a whole entity ... from
concept to production,'' said Castaing.
   ``By reallocating our resources into smaller, dedicated groups,
we will have more concentrated responsibility and accountability,''
he said. ``It also will enable us to be more responsive to what our
customers tell us they want in a new vehicle.''
   Employment levels in the 6,000-worker Chrysler engineering
organization will be unaffected by the restructuring, the statement
said.
   Under the restructuring, the engineering operations will be
divided into four basic groups, with support units also being
created. The support units include scientific laboratories and
Chrysler's proving grounds.

<HEAD>A Subject in FBI Probe Says Agent Looked ``Like A G-Man''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An FBI agent posing as a losing trader drew
commodities brokers into a federal investigation of their activities
by offering to help them dodge taxes on their earnings in the
futures markets, one broker said in an interview published Sunday.
   ``He made this pitch repeatedly,'' Thomas A. Crouch, a prominent
broker, told the Chicago Tribune.
   ``He'd say, `I have this big loss carryover, and I'm willing to
sell it to guys who've made a lot of money,''' Crouch said.
   Crouch was the first broker to detail in a news account how be
became a subject of the massive probe of alleged commodities fraud
at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The agent, who used the alias Peter Vogel, posed as a
down-on-his-luck trader willing to use his accounts to conceal the
profits of successful traders who wanted to evade taxes, Crouch said.
   At least one trader went along with Vogel's scheme because he
felt sorry for him, said Crouch, of Ogden Dunes, Ind.
   The FBI's investigation has centered on allegations that as many
as 100 brokers and traders at Chicago's futures exchanges
systematically cheated customers out of millions of dollars in
executing their orders to buy and sell futures contracts on a
variety of commodities.
   A federal grand jury reportedly has been convened to consider the
fraud charges. More than 200 subpoenas have been served on prominent
brokers, traders and firms.
   Crouch said he traded futures contracts on Japanese yen with
Vogel, described by Crouch and others as a clean-cut, silver-haired
``hayseed.'' Vogel was introduced around the Merc as the nephew of a
South American millionaire with an interest in commodities, the
broker said.
   Sources close to the inquiry told the Tribune Vogel would suggest
to traders they secretly park their earnings in his account by
recording their trades in his name, or that they could concoct
trades with him that showed them losing money.
   Crouch said he didn't go along with it, but did seek colleagues
to participate.
   ``I heard the spiel,'' Crouch said. ``I was dumb enough to say,
`I don't want to do this, But I'll see who does'.''
   Some traders have described as particularly unsuccessful in the
futures market.
   Crouch's comments provided the first look from a trader's
perspective at the investigation that has shaken the industry since
it was disclosed last month.
   The Tribune said Crouch decided to be interviewed because he
believed he and his colleagues were betrayed by Vogel. Some were
particularly upset that Vogel used an office Christmas party in the
final weeks of the investigation to catch people off-guard and
possibly record their conversations on tape, Crouch said.
   ``To accept an invitation and then work the party is just a bit
much,'' Crouch said.
   ``This wasn't Miami Vice. This wasn't a cocaine ring,'' the
newspaper quoed Crouch as saying. ``This, at best, was a little
white-collar crime.''
   The Tribune said Vogel was one of four federal agents who posed
as traders to record thousands of potentially incriminating
conversations in restaurants, downtown apartments and the noisy pits
of the world's largest futures exchanges.
   One agent worked as Vogel's partner, another worked in the Board
of Trade's soybean pit and another traded Treasury bonds at the
Merc, the Tribune said.

<HEAD>Chris-Craft Goes To OMC In $58 Million Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Murray Industries Inc., maker of Chris-Craft
pleasure boats, has been sold for about $58 million to Outboard
Marine Corp., of Waukegan, Ill.
   The sale came in an unusual and spirited auction Saturday in the
courtroom of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Alexander Paskay, who has been
overseeing Chris-Craft since Dec. 9, when it filed for protection
from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
   ``This company is in a terminal stage, and rigor mortis is
setting in,'' Paskay said in approving the sale, which includes all
of Murray Industries' assets except manufacturing plants in
Washington and Michigan.
   ``It's a very good development for the company,'' the judge said
of the auction price. Paskay said he did not think the company would
bring more than $20 million.
   Murray, based in Bradenton, Fla., had been virtually paralyzed
since the filing, which listed $70 million in debts and less than
$60 million in assets.
   More than 80 percent of Murray's 1,600 workers have been laid off
in the past few months, with manufacturing plants here and in North
Carolina at a virtual standstill while those in Washington, Michigan
and Indiana have already been shut down.
   Chris-Craft is the nation's oldest pleasure boat maker, making
recreational powerboats ranging from 17-foot ski boats to 50-foot
yachts. It is not connected with Chris Craft Industries Inc., the
New York-based media company.
   The company had warned it might fail without investment capital,
and had said it would be talking to potential buyers and might seek
an emergency sale to raise cash.
   By Saturday, four buyout offers were in _ the highest being $31.5
million _ and the bidding was expected to go higher at the auction.
   Chris-Craft bankruptcy attorney John Olson acted as auctioneer as
bidding opened with an offer from Outboard Marine of $40 million, a
figure reached during all-night bargaining Friday between the
company, its lenders and creditors.
   The other serious bidder was takeover specialist Irwin Jacobs,
owner of the boat builder, Genmar Industries Inc. Jacobs offered
$43.5 million.
   Genmar and Jacobs upped their offers until OMC bid $58 million
and Jacob made no further offer.
   Outside the courtroom, Jacobs was gracious in defeat. ``They're
happy, we're happy, everybody's happy,'' he said.
   OMC Boat Group President John Winn acknowledged his company paid
more than Chris-Craft is worth on paper.
   ``Based on where the company is (financially), we paid a
premium,'' Winn said. ``But five years from now we think we'll look
back and say we got a bargain.''
   New Chris-Craft boats could be under way within days of the
expected Feb. 20 closing of the sale, said Winn.

<HEAD>OPEC Exceeds New Quota In January</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS lead to CORRECT nearly 1 million to more than 1 million.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC produced nearly 19.7 million barrels a day
of oil in January, more than 1 million barrels over the amount
promised under the cartel's new quota system, according to a report
released Sunday.
   The Petroleum Intelligence Weekly said its latest survey of world
oil production showed that at least five members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries exceeded their quotas last month,
pushing production beyond the 18.5 million barrels pledged at a
meeting last November.
   The new quota was to have taken effect Jan. 1 and extend for six
months in an effort to stabilize world prices, which slumped to near
1986 lows last year because of a massive oversupply of oil.
   The United Arab Emirates was said to be the biggest offender, but
other major exporters also overproduced, including Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Iran and Qatar, the survey found.
   The UAE, whose quota was set at 988,000 barrels a day, produced
approximately 1.5 million barrels, the PIW said.
   However, Iranian output at about 2.7 million barrels a day
``could have important ramifications, since some in OPEC had thought
Tehran would only produce about 2.5 million (barrels), 150,000
barrels under its quota, thereby offsetting the impact of UAE
excesses,'' the report said.
   Last year, OPEC production averaged 19.6 million barrels a day,
according to the PIW, an 11 percent rise from 1987 and the highest
level since 1982, exceeding the 1986 average of 18.4 million barrels
a day.
   Between January and December 1988, OPEC production soared more
than 5 million barrels, from 17.3 million to 22.7 million, while
non-OPEC production remained flat, the survey showed.
   The report also indicated fourth-qyarter demand for oil by
consuming nations, including the United States, was due in part to
temporary factors, such as weather, and might not continue as strong
in 1989.

<HEAD>Economy Grows in January, But at Slower Rate, Purchasing Managers
Say</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to include dropped word, `below.'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The findings of a survey of purchasing executives
released Sunday indicated the economy continued to grow in January,
but at a slower rate than in previous months.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which tracks
the economy through its monthly survey of its members, said its
Purchasing Managers Index dropped sharply last month, to 53.2 from
57.3. The January level was the lowest for the index in two years.
   Despite the decline, the index still indicated economic growth. A
reading above 50 generally indicates the economy is expanding, while
below 50 it is contracting.
   The survey found that new orders continued to grow, although
their pace slowed somewhat from December.
   Twenty-seven percent of the purchasing managers surveyed said new
orders were better last month, while 61 percent said they were the
same and 12 percent said they were worse. In December, 24 percent
said they were better, while 59 percent said they were the same and
17 percent said they were worse.
   There was a similar trend in production.
   Twenty-seven percent of the respondents said production was
better last month, while 61 percent said it was the same and 12
percent said it was worse. In December, 22 percent said it was
better, 65 percent said it was the same and 13 percent said it was
worse.
   Vendor deliveries continued to slow, but their change also came
at a slower pace. Slow vendor deliveries are a bullish economic
signal; they indicate a business is getting new orders faster than
it can fill them.
   Fifteen percent of the respondents said deliveries were slower,
while 79 percent said they were the same and 6 percent said they
were faster. The previous month, 15 percent said they were slower,
77 percent said they were the same and 8 percent said they were
faster.
   Inventories dropped for the first time since October.
   Seventeen percent of the purchasing managers said inventories
were higher, 59 percent said they were the same and 24 percent said
they were lower. That compared with 20 percent who said they were
higher, 55 percent who said they were the same and 25 percent who
said inventories were lower in December.
   The respondents also said prices continued to rise in January.
   Fifty-one percent of the respondents said prices were higher,
while 46 said they were the same and 3 percent said they lower. In
December, thirty-nine said they were higher, 58 said they were the
same and 3 percent said they were lower.
   Employment crept higher, according to the survey.
   Ten percent of the purchasing managers said employment was up at
their companies, 80 percent said it was the same and 10 percent said
it was down. The previous month, 14 percent reported higher
employment, 75 percent said it was the same and 11 percent said it
fell.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management is an education
and research organization of purchasing executives. It polls
purchasing managers in more than 250 industrial firms for its
economic survey.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stock Prices Higher In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged up in early trading against the
Japanese yen Monday while stock prices rose to a record high.
   The dollar opened at 129.75 yen, up 0.48 yen from Friday's close
of 129.27 yen.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said the dollar's higher opening
followed its rise in the Sydney market, where trading began earlier
than Tokyo. The dollar moved as high as 130.00 yen briefly during
early trading in Sydney, he said.
   ``The dollar seemed to gain further ground as nothing concrete
came out of last Friday's G-7 meeting,'' said the dealer, who spoke
anonymously.
   Finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of
Seven industrialized countries ended their meeting in Washington
Friday. They pledged to continue close economic policy coordination
and seek ways to solve the world's huge international debt problem,
while accepting the current exchange rates.
   The G-7 is made up of the United States, Japan, Britain, France,
West Germany, Italy and Canada.
   The dealer, however, said the dollar's movement will be limited
as other financial markts in Asia, including Hong Kong and
Singapore, were closed Monday for the Chinese Lunar New Year
holiday. They will reopen Thursday.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which rose 178.48 points to a record-high close of
31,685.48 points Friday, added another 109.05 points, or 0.34
percent, in the first 15 minutes of trading to move to 31,794.83.
