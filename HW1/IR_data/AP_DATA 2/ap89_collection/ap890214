   President Daniel Ortega of
Nicaragua on Tuesday promised earlier elections and campaign reform,
and leaders at the Central American summit agreed to try to
dismantle the Nicaraguan rebel movement.
   But the five presidents did not resolve what was the major
stumbling block during the two days of talks _ verification of
progress toward democracy under the Central American peace plan.
   Nicaragua's leftist government committed itself to hosting U.N.
observers to guarantee the integrity of presidential, legislative
and municipal elections to be held on or before Feb. 25, 1990, 10
months earlier than scheduled.
   Ortega also promised to ensure that opposition parties have
access equal to that of the Sandinistas to radio and television air
time during the campaign.
   The leaders agreed to draft within 90 days a detailed program to
effect ``the demobilization, repatriation or voluntary relocation in
third countries'' of an estimated 20,000 Nicaraguan rebels and their
families in neighboring Honduras. The U.S.-backed rebels, known as
Contras, have been fighting Nicaragua's government since 1981.
   The declaration signed by the presidents said Nicaragua's
electoral law would be reformed and opposition parties would be
represented on the Supreme Electoral Council.
   Elections had been scheduled for November 1990. Ortega's term is
scheduled to end in January 1991.
   Ortega, asked if moving up elections implied he would hand over
power before the end of his term, said: ``Power resides in the
people. In February of 1990, the people will again be voting,
exercising their will, their decision, their power to say who will
govern.''
   He would not say specifically if his term in office might be
shortened, but Foreign Minister Miguel d'Escoto told a questioner
after the summit ended:
   ``The idea is not to have a lame-duck government forever. You
have to read between the lines, but what President Ortega said
leaves open the possibility that his term could end before January
1991.''
   Nicaragua also committed itself to release of political
prisoners, including jailed Contras and former soldiers of the late
President Anastasio Somoza, whom the Sandinistas overthrew in July
1979.
   Paul Reichler, a U.S. lawyer and adviser to Nicaraguan, said up
to 1,600 prisoners could be released. He said about 100 former
Somoza soldiers and Contras would not be released because they were
jailed for heinous crimes.
   D'Escoto, asked if the commitment on elections was a concession
in response to the program for definitive dismantling of the
Contras, said: ``These democratization commitments are not
concessions. They have always been our intention, part of our
program. Now that the military threat to us no longer exists, we can
carry them out.''
   Reichler said earlier Tuesday that an 11th-hour accord on
verification of progress toward democracy had been hammered out. But
the presidents made no mention of agreement on such a mechanism in
their final document, and the thorny issue remains for lower level
officials to grapple with in the future.
   Adolfo Calero, one of the main leaders of the Contras, reacted
harshly to the summit's resolution on the guerrillas, organized as
the Nicaraguan Resistance.
   ``Any accord based on Ortega's promises is like trying to leash a
dog with sausages,'' he told reporters outside the hotel.
   Calero later told a news conference the agreement on election
reform is a trium for the Contras and ``is a public confession that
the Sandinistas have not fulfilled their commitments'' to
democratization.
   ``We are willing to return to Nicaragua as soon as we see that
Ortega seriously begins to implement the commitments,'' he said,
adding that if the Sandinistas go back on the agreement, ``our
option is to continue with the armed struggle.''
   On whether the Contras might participate in elections, Aristedes
Sanchez, another Contra leader, said, ``First we have to see the
electoral reforms.''
   Ortega, upon arrival at Managua's international airport Tuesday
night, said the summit was a ``victory for the Nicaraguan people.
Today, February 14th, we lovers of peace ... have delivered a final
blow to the war.''
   This summit was an attempt to resuscitate the Esquipulas peace
plan signed Aug. 7, 1987, which called for cease-fires in civil wars
affecting Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala; democratization,
amnesties and a halt to outside aid for insurgents.
   The peace plan, named for Esquipulas, the Guatemalan town where
the presidents first met in May 1986, also banned use of one
signatory's territory as a base for aggression against that of
another.
   President Oscar Arias, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for
drafting the Esquipulas peace plan, said the achievements reached at
this meeting have encouraged the presidents to meet more often. They
last held a summit 13 months ago.
   The lack of progress at that meeting began a period of stagnation
of the Central American peace process.
   Leaders of the five countries said they would next get together
in Honduras at a date to be announced.
   In addition to Ortega and Arias, Presidents Vinicio Cerezo of
Guatemala, Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador and Jose Azcona Hoyo
of Honduras attended the summit.
   An estimated 11,000 Contra fighters and another 10,000 of their
family members remain in camps in Honduras near the Nicaraguan
border, being supported by U.S. humanitarian aid. Many of them have
expressed a desire to go on fighting despite lack of U.S. military
help.
   Arias, asked what would happen if the Contras resisted
disarmament and disbanding, said: ``It is the responsibilty of the
international community, but above all of those who for many years
sponsored the Contras, to find a solution to this problem,'' he
said, apparently referring to the United States.

   Sixty years ago today, machine-gun fire echoed
from a garage in a Near North Side neighborhood and seven members of
George ``Bugs'' Moran's gang fell dead in the St. Valentine's Day
Massacre.
   It was the Prohibition era's goriest crime and the beginning of
the end of gangster rule.
   Now Prohibition is dead and the garage is gone but the memories
live on for some Chicago residents, who vividly recall when
``gangland graduated from murder to massacre,'' as news accounts of
the day put it.
   A senior citizen's home borders the site, and residents of the
Lincoln Park Senior Center say their parking lot is on the very spot
where the seven fell. Some residents believe their ghosts still walk.
   ``I'd be sitting on my reclining chair and hear things moving
around ... knives and forks clanging together ... I'd hear someone
go out the door,'' said Madeline Bushbaum, 84, who lived in the
neighborhood at the time.
   ``We always figured it was the dead ones looking for the ones
that killed 'em,'' said Mrs. Bushbaum, who has moved out of the room
closest to the murder site. ``I don't hear 'em anymore, but several
people moved out of the building because they said they were
disturbed.''
   At the time of the massacre, ``Scarface'' Al Capone, leader of
Near South Side bootlegging operations, wanted Moran's territory up
north.
   On the morning of Feb. 14, 1929, a day when the temperature was
10 below zero, four men _ two wearing police uniforms _ raided
Moran's garage headquarters.
   They lined the men up against the wall as if for a routine frisk
for weapons, and instead delivered a Valentine's Day hail of gunfire
that riddled the victims, almost severing limbs.
   Mrs. Bushbaum, then a 24-year-old evening telephone operator, was
playing pool with the guys in the back room of Drake Braithwaite
undertakers, about three blocks from the scene. She said she often
helped out, answering the telephone when the employees went out ``to
pick up a stiff.''
   ``While we were playing, the garage door flew open and there were
the coppers and the paddy wagon,'' she recalled.
   ``They brought in two bodies on two slabs and just slid 'em off
on the floor and said, `We gotta go back, we got five more dead out
there!'
   ``I saw the guy with half his brains shot out, and I tell you, I
didn't feel so good,'' Mrs. Bushbaum said.
   Six of the victims died instantly.
   Frank Gusenberg, fading fast in his hospital bed, upheld the
gangland code when police asked who'd done the shooting.
   ``Nobody,'' Gusenberg said. ``It's getting dark, sarge. So long.''
   Moran, who was not at his headquarters that day, later told
police: ``Only the Capone gang kills like that.''
   Authorities never proved a Capone connection and the massacre is
still listed in police files as ``murder by persons unknown.''
   But the violence hastened a resurgence of law and order that
crushed gangster rule and eventually brought the arrest and downfall
of Capone.
   Another senior center resident said living on the site doesn't
bother him one bit.
   ``You get used to that living in Chicago, you get used to the
violence,'' said Alfred Schiller, 71, who was 11 at the time of the
massacre. ``I used to go by there all the time on the way to go
fishing in the park.''
   Schiller recalled chatting with garage mechanic Johnny May, who
was ordered out from beneath a truck and lined up with the others
against the wall.
   ``He was a nice guy, just a working stiff, that's all he was,''
Schiller said. ``Of course, they don't come up and say, `Hey, I'm a
Mafia man _ wanna see my machine gun?'''

<HEAD>Scientist Says China Faces Environmental Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China is in the throes of its worst ecological
crisis ever, with industrial pollution, acid rain and the conversion
of arable land into desert posing critical threats, an official
newspaper reported today.
   The China Daily quoted Zhou Guangzhao, a leading scientist, as
noting at a recent conference that 5 billion tons of topsoil are
washed away every year because of erosion and that vast stretches of
grassland are lost annually.
   Forests are shrinking rapidly, and deserts take over an
additional 600 square miles of land each year, Zhou was quoted as
saying. More than 11 percent of China's territory is now arid land,
he said.
   Zhou said acid rain is a problem in southwestern China and that
150 million Chinese drink polluted water as a result of industrial
pollution.
   China once claimed environmental pollution was a capitalist vice
that did not affect socialist states, but now acknowledges that its
emphasis on rapid development and lack of pollution standards
serious damaged the environment.
   The State Environmental Protection Bureau spent about $1.8
billion last year cleaning up the environment and plans a 50 percent
spending increase in coming years.
   But China's leading paper, the People's Daily, said last year
that even that may not be enough.
   ``If forceful policies are not implemented, the nation faces a
future of denuded forests, dirty lakes, barren grasslands and smoggy
skies,'' it said.

   ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' a
prize-winning American play about an elderly white woman and her
black chauffeur, has opened here to rave reviews from critics
delighted by its low-key handling of racial friction.
   With the exception of one critic who found the script too bland,
black and white reviewers from pro-government and opposition
newspapers praised the play and the production.
   ``Driving Miss Daisy'' opened last week at the Market Theater,
which for the past decade has been Johannesburg's main showplace for
multiracial drama and has featured many militantly anti-apartheid
works.
   Barry Ronge, a critic for the Sunday Times, said the 1988
Pulitzer Prize-winning play by Alfred Uhry ``is about whites and
blacks interacting without anger and threat, a rare sight on the
Market's stages.''
   ``The audience's relief at seeing a play and not another harangue
was palpable,'' wrote Ronge, who is white.
   Writing in a Sunday Times' supplement for black readers, black
critic Ezra Mantini described it as a masterpiece ``with lots of
laughter and no reveling in anger or outcry.''
   A review in The Star, Johannesburg's largest-circulation daily,
said: ``Our playwrights could learn a lot from the effect of
subtlety and understatement'' in Uhry's handling of racial tension.
   The play depicts the evolving relationship between Daisy Werthan,
an elderly white aristocrat in Atlanta, and Hoke Coleburn, hired as
her chauffeur when she is no longer able to drive herself.
   The initial discomfort felt between the two gradually transforms
into deep friendship.
   A review in The Sowetan, the country's largest-selling black
daily, said the play ``is sure to win many theatergoers' hearts with
its easily recognizable and universal truth that racial discord
makes no sense at all.''
   The Sowetan's critic, Victor Metsoamere, said the bond that grows
between Hoke and Miss Daisy ``is bound to take a
hunndred-and-never-mind years to be cultivated in South Africa.''
   ``This is because of the unnerving charades of South Africa's
ultra-right wing groups who squirm no end at the black man's
extended hand of friendship,'' Metsoamere wrote.
   Two pro-government newspapers, The Citizen and Beeld, also
praised the production. Beeld, an Afrikaans-language daily, echoed
The Star in suggesting that playwrights should emulate Uhry's
indirect approach to political issues.
   The only mildly negative review come from the financial newspaper
Business Day, which praised the production but described the play as
``very sweet, entirely innocuous and utterly inconsequential.''
   ``It is the theatrical equivalent of greeting card philosophy,
designed to appeal to everyone, offend no one and contribute little
to the sum of human knowledge,'' wrote Business Day's Robert Grieg.
   Two of South Africa's best-known actors, John Kani and Annabel
Linder, play the leads in ``Driving Miss Daisy.''
   Kani last year became the first black to play Othello in a
professional production in South Africa, starring at the Market
under the direction of Janet Suzman, the South African-born actress
based in London.
   The director of ``Driving Miss Daisy'' is another white woman,
Janice Honeyman, whose previous production at the Market was a
highly praised enactment of African folk tales.
   Ms. Honeyman told the anti-apartheid weekly newspaper New Nation
the message of ``Driving Miss Daisy'' is that ``people are people.''
   ``They can relate to each other and enjoy each other's company,
and give to each other and teach each other without all the other
stuff that we're subjected to all the time in this God-forsaken
country,'' she said.
   ``There are going to be people coming here (to the Market) and
saying, `I'd forgotten that someone of another color can be my best
friend,''' she said.

   For Gov. Michael Dukakis, the hard times didn't end
with his defeat in the presidential election.
   The severe state budget problems that haunted the final stages of
his campaign have hurt his support. Political allies have started
attacking him over the deficit and his decision that more taxes were
the only way to balance the books.
   Meanwhile, fatigue and depression associated with the
presidential campaign defeat led to his wife Kitty entering an
alcohol treatment program.
   And a recent public opinion poll found him about as popular as a
swim in polluted Boston Harbor.
   ``I don't believe I can remember a Massachusetts governor who
went from that high to such a relatively low period in such a short
period of time,'' said John Volpe, a former Republican governor.
``You can go downhill as fast as you can go uphill.''
   Most of Dukakis' friends maintain that his stoicism is seeing him
through.
   ``I don't see a Mike Dukakis who is worn down or torn down by
these events,'' said Boston attorney Paul Brountas, chairman of
Dukakis' presidential campaign and a personal friend.
   If Dukakis occasionally seemed distracted, it was because ``the
family is obviously the most important consideration,'' Brountas
said. ``I don't think it's easily compartmentalized.''
   These should have been his golden years culminating more than a
decade in the state's highest office. Instead, since becoming a lame
duck by announcing in January that he won't run for governor again,
Dukakis has wrestled with some of the biggest problems to face state
government in years.
   And he is doing it without the usual support.
   On Sunday, a week after Kitty Dukakis entered a Rhode Island
center to be treated for an alcohol problem, headlines announced
that, for the first time in his statewide political career, Dukakis'
favorability rating had dipped below 50 percent. The poll of 603
Democrats and independents by Secretary of State Michael Connolly
showed only 43.5 percent rating the governor favorably.
   On Monday, Dukakis went before the state House Taxation Committee
to defend a $735 million tax increase proposal. He says he needs the
money to help close a $600 million budget gap this year and keep
next year's budget in balance.
   All this for a politician who, in 1986, won re-election by better
than a 2-1 margin, who gained the Democratic presidential nomination
after winning primaries in every region of the country and who as
recently as December had a favorable rating among Democrats of 83
percent.
   Since the presidential election, Dukakis has occasionally shown
more fire than he did on the campaign trail. In his
state-of-the-state address, for example, he called his opponents on
fiscal issues ``gutless wonders.'' And on Monday, he was more
aggressive than usual at a state budget hearing, blasting
legislators as free spenders yet tax foes.
   Brountas said that Dukakis is, if anything, in a better position
to handle his current political troubles than he was on the
presidential campaign trail. Amid the attacks by Bush on such
subjects as furloughs for prisoners and the unclean waters of Boston
Harbor, Dukakis was unable to get his message through.
   In Massachusetts, Brountas said, ``this is different. This is
where he is at his best in terms of controlling the situation.''

   Christian Dior, Anna Pavlova and the Empress
Josephine found immortality in the rose garden, but the honor _
possibly the ultimate Valentine's Day gift _ requires luck and lots
of money.
   For centuries, rose breeders have named new varieties in honor of
the heroic, the beautiful and the famous. But they won't guarantee
the flower will catch the public's fancy.
   It costs up to $62,000 to buy the right to name a rose, says
Terry Kenwright, vice president of the British Association of Rose
Breeders.
   He said it can take as long as 15 years to develop a new blossom,
and ``breeders are businessmen. They want some reward for their
effort.''
   Britain's 17 professional breeders introduce only 35 new
varieties each year on average, and only a fraction of those are
available for private naming.
   So rose lovers shouldn't get their hopes too high, said Dee
Dealtry, the association's secretary, who fields requests from the
public.
   Newspapers, charities and big businesses have roses named after
them. There's a Chrysler Imperial rose and a Times rose. The Everest
Double Fragrance is named after a storm window factory.
   One of the oldest and most famous cultivated roses is the fragile
pink flower the French call Cuisse de Nymphe _ Nymph's Thigh. The
British, who have grown it for 500 years, prefer to call it Great
Maiden's Blush.
   A blossom named after a factory might smell as sweet, but could
it so perfectly evoke the silken cheek of youth?
   In the depths of winter, a rose catalog with its mysterious and
seductive names offers a promise of spring. There is Eglantine,
Celestial, Rose d'Amour, Black Prince and the splendid crimson
Cardinal de Richelieu.
   Even rosa horrida, described in one catalog as ``a strange,
gooseberry-like bush'' from the 18th century, appeals to the
curiosity.
   There are dashing dukes, Grandpa Dickson and the dress designer
Dior. But the honors go mostly to the ladies: Penelope, ballet
dancer Anna Pavlova, dozens of duchesses and Ma Perkins.
   Roses have inspired wonderful tales about their origin: A jealous
goddess created the flower to rival Venus' beauty; the first rose
sprang from the sweat of the prophet Mohammed or fell from the hair
of Aurora as she combed her golden locks.
   One of history's greatest rose lovers, Napoleon's empress
Josephine, grew every known rose of the day at Malmaison chateau and
is honored by the pale pink Souvenir de la Malmaison.
   She sent botanical expeditions around the world unhindered even
by the Napoleonic Wars, and by the time she died in 1814, 250
varieties grew in her garden.
   When the British enemy intercepted her plant shipments on the
high seas they were immediately sent on to Malmaison by order of the
British regent. A London rose grower had a pass enabling him to take
Josephine's plant orders to France unmolested.
   As British troops approached Paris in 1815, the empress'
gardener, Aimee Vibert, got away with 10,000 seedlings. A white
climbing rose bears his name.
   The unfortunate Atom Bomb, reputedly quite a nice red rose, never
caught on and disappeared from the catalogs soon after its
introduction in 1954.
   Some say the Peace rose by any other name might not have become
one of the most popular modern varieties. Bred in southern France
during World War II and shipped out of the country just before
Hitler's armies invaded, it was named in the United States on the
day Berlin fell to the Allies.
   Hundreds of Peace blooms were sent to the first United Nations
Conference in 1945. It was planted in gardens and at memorials, and
by the mid-1950s, an estimated 30 million of the bushes had been
sold.
   Few dare to speak ill of this famous yellow rose tinged with
pink, but some mutter under their breath that it has no fragrance,
and can a rose be a rose be a rose without perfume?

   Dissident Polish parishioners occupying
a Catholic church on Monday denied they were protesting efforts to
open the church to other ethnic groups in a mostly Hispanic
neighborhood.
   ``Everybody can come to the church _ black, Hispanic,'' said
Beata Grubka, one of about 100 pashioners who have taken turns
occupying St. Michael of the Archangel Church since Saturday
afternoon.
   ``But they can't throw us (out),'' she said. ``It's our church.''
   The dissidents originally planned a two-day vigil but have since
vowed to remain in the church until Bridgeport Bishop Edward M. Egan
agrees to discuss their demands with them.
   The dissidents want the new pastor, the Rev. John Bambol, removed
and a popular associate, the Rev. Roman Palaszewski, to be returned.
   About 20 dissidents sat in the front pews of the ornate,
89-year-old church Monday morning _ down from about 80 on Sunday _
singing hymns and praying aloud in Polish. The dissidents say they
have the support of 800 of the church's 1,200 parishioners.
   Despite a decision by church officials to turn off the heat, the
group of protesters swelled Monday night to nearly 100, many of them
wearing parkas or sweaters with the temperature outside 35 degrees.
   Daily Masses, in both Polish and English, have continued during
the protest. The dissidents remain inside during Mass but said they
are refusing to take communion from Bambol.
   Church authorities have made no attempt to have the dissidents
expelled, but police said officers stop by regularly to make sure
everything is calm.
   ``We are going to remain in the church until we have a chance to
talk to Bishop Egan,'' Halina Chemiel, a spokeswoman for the
dissidents.
   Diocese offices in Bridgeport were closed Monday and an answering
service operator said Egan was not available for comment.
   The dissidents have criticized Bambol for attempting to open the
parish to other ethnic groups, but said they have received
assurances from the Rev. Daniel Pietrzak, the provincial for the
Franciscan order in Baltimore who assigns priests to St. Michael's,
that it will remain Polish.
   ``He knew that if everybody started coming, the Polish language
would die out,'' Genevieve Kozlowski, a parishioner for 25 years,
said of Bambol.
   The dissidents believe Bambol helped engineer Palaszewski's
ouster in December because Palaszewski was too active in the Polish
community.
   The Rev. James Smyka, an associate pastor at St. Michael's,
answered the door at the church rectory on Monday and said Bambol
was not available for comment.
   ``I'm sorry, we have nothing to say,'' Smyka said.
   On Sunday, Bambol described the dissidents as ``a small group of
people, new immigrants'' and said he would not respond to the their
demands.

   Sheridan Hegland, 78, a former
lawmaker and key figure in the founding of the University of
California, San Diego, died Monday. A Democrat, Hegland served in
the state Assembly from 1955 to 1963, representing the 77th
District, which includes the suburban San Diego areas of Vista,
Oceanside, Fallbrook and La Mesa, his former hometown.
   It was during his first year in the Legislature that Hegland
introduced a resolution asking the UC Board of Regents to study the
``feasibility, desirability and practicability of establishing a
branch of the University of California'' in San Diego.
   After retiring from the Assembly, Hegland taught political
science courses at Mesa College and Palomar College.
   He and his wife, Edwina, also wrote three books and produced

   George O'Hanlon, the voice of cartoon's
average family man of the future, George Jetson, died Saturday after
a stroke. He was 76.
   O'Hanlon, a The writer and actor, had just finished recording his
role as George in ``Jetsons: The Movie,'' a full-length animated
feature from Universal Pictures and Hanna-Barbera Productions
scheduled for release this fall.
   The actor was beat out for the voice of cartoon character Fred
Flintstone of ``The Flintstones'' but Barbera remembered O'Hanlon's
good auditions for that part and tapped him to play the father of
the future.
   Although the ``The Jetsons'' only ran from 1962-1963, it
developed a loyal folllowing. In 1985, 41 new episodes were
commissioned for syndication and O'Hanlon again did the voice of
George Jetson.
   O'Hanlon's other credits include the roles of the TV commentator
in ``Rocky'' and William Bendix's next-door neighbor on ``The Life
of Riley,'' among others. He also wrote for the Jackie Gleason Show
for two years.

   Six-foot-3, 260-pound John Goodman remembers
the time when he could party with impunity and not be noticed.
   ``I guess that changes now,'' the chubby husband in ABC's new hit
``Roseanne'' said in this week's TV Guide.
   ``I got to be a little more careful,'' he said, recalling that
people now are hounding him for autographs and some are even
propositioning him.
   Goodman recalled when he and longtime friend Bruce Willis ``could
run around late at night, partying with impunity. ...
   ``It wasn't like we had to worry about getting into trouble in
the newspapers because no one knew who we were,'' Goodman said. But
things changed for Willis when his career took off a few years ago
with the ABC series ``Moonlighting.''
   ``We're out here in Los Angeles and we're lying down on Melrose
Avenue. I'm doing my Curly spins _ you know, the Three Stooges,
Curly spinning on one arm. Bruce is doing his own crazy thing.
Anyway, some tabloid got it and nailed him, made him look bad,''
Goodman said.
   ``I got off because no one knew who ... I was.''

   Diana Ross, who is resuming her singing career
after taking time out to marry Norwegian tycoon Arne Naess and give
birth to two sons, says she is driven to be supreme at everything
she does.
   ``I have to be better than the best. Super-everything,'' the
44-year-old said in an interview in March's Vanity Fair magazine.
   Ross, whose career began in the 1960s as the lead vocalist of the
Supremes, is planning to record an album and go on tour.
   She said she has a ``motherly instinct'' toward the young black
singers of the 1980s: ``I love Whitney (Houston).''
   But envy of Houston's success is what propelled her to resume her
career, according to a friend who is quoted anonymously by the
magazine: ``Diana would be competitive with a tree.''
   Ross has kept a low stage profile since marrying Naess in 1985.
She gave birth to a boy in August, her fifth child, and her second
son with Naess.

   Queen Elizabeth II peeped under the hood of one of
her Rolls-Royces to help kick off a campaign to convert her kingdom
to lead-free gasoline.
   Most of the queen's fleet will be converted to unleaded fuel,
Buckingham Palace said. One exception was the green Jaguar she
arrived in _ the manufacturer says conversion is impossible.
   The queen, who took a course in basic vehicle mechanics as part
of her World War II service, chatted Monday with two mechanics who
have been converting her claret-colored 1977 Jubilee Rolls.
   She asked how the conversion would affect the car's performance
and, said mechanic David Wright, looked to see ``what was what.''
However, Wright joked, ``I think she generally sticks to horses.''

   A bungling bandit who used a can of carrots
as a weapon after dropping his gun while attempting to hold up a
convenience store pleaded guilty to armed robbery.
   Charles A. Foggie didn't get any money after he and an accomplice
hit store owner Clyde Hunt on the head with the carrots, prosecutor
Asa Skinner said Monday. Before fleeing, they did take the pistol
Hunt had used to try to defend himself, making the armed robbery
charge possible, Skinner said.
   Jeffery Ennels, 22, is scheduled for trial later this year on an
armed robbery count in the Oct. 31 holdup.
   Ennels and Foggie, 26, are soldiers stationed at nearby Fort Polk.
   Hunt easily identified Foggie as his assailant, according to
Skinner.
   ``He had known him a long time and said he was a regular
customer. And they had no disguises,'' Skinner added.
   Judge Ted Broyles set an April 20 sentencing date for Foggie.

   A suspect was questioned Monday in the
butcher-knife deaths and sexual assaults of an elderly woman and her
daughter, and in the strangulation two weeks ago of a friend of the
victims.
   A 28-year-old man was taken into custody Sunday night but had not
been charged, Claiborne County Sheriff Frank Davis said Monday. He
said the suspect was not related to the victims.
   The bodies of Mary Bell Simmons, 88, and her daughter, Georgia
Mae Thomas, 58, were found in the bedroom of Simmons' home Sunday by
another daughter of Simmons. Both women appeared to have been
sexually assaulted and stabbed in the chest with a butcher knife
found near the bed.
   Authorities believe the women had been dead about one hour before
they were found.
   Davis said bloodhounds led authorities to an area near the
suspect's home, several blocks from where the bodies of Simmons and
Thomas were found.
   Davis said he believes the Sunday homicides are related to the
death of a close friend of the women's family, Bertha Peterson, 47,
who was strangled, beaten and sexually assaulted in her home across
town Jan. 29.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The impending changeover in the deanship of
Washington's diplomatic corps is not something ambassadors or State
Department protocol officers like to discuss. It's simply not
diplomatic.
   It's almost as rude as asking an ambassador how much he makes, or
drinking out of a finger bowl at an embassy dinner party.
   But the current dean, Count Wilhelm Wachtmeister of Sweden, is
vacating the post in April _ and his heir is not so apparent.
   Wachtmeister _ toast of society columns and tennis partner of
presidents and congressmen _ presented his credentials to President
Richard Nixon on June 5, 1974. Three years ago he became dean of the
153-nation diplomatic corps, succeeding Soviet Ambassador Anatoly
Dobrynin.
   The popular envoy leaves Washington in April, a victim of
Sweden's mandatory retirement age of 65.
   The ``vice dean'' of the diplomatic corps, Cypriot Ambassador
Andrew Jacovides, would be a shoo-in for the promotion were it not
for two obstacles: the ambassadors of Western Samoa and Tuvalu.
   Rules of international diplomatic protocol dictate that
succession is determined by seniority. The ambassador of Western
Samoa, who presented his credentials in February 1978, is next in
the order of seniority.
   But Ambassador Maiava Iulai Toma represents the South Pacific
archipelago of 141,000 at the United Nations as well, and maintains
his office and residence in New York.
   There is nothing in the rules that says an ambassador has to be a
resident of the capital to become dean, but State Department
officials say it would not be practical to have a non-resident dean
for the demanding ceremonial post.
   Tuvalu, a Pacific island nation of 6,000, is next in line. Its
ambassador, Ionatana Ionatana, doesn't live in Washington either. As
a matter of fact, he doesn't live in the United States at all.
   Actually, State Department officials say, he has been given
another job back home and is only accredited here on paper.
   ``But who knows? We have to call them up and tell them they're
next in line. They might be sufficiently attracted by the prestige
to set up shop in Washington,'' said one U.S. protocol officer. He
declined to be named _ it wouldn't be diplomatic, he said.
   An official at the Western Samoan mission in New York said no
decision had been made about the dean's post, and declined to
discuss it further. ``It's not something you discuss publicly,'' she
said.
   Prestige is a strong draw of the job, which sometimes elevates
little-noticed countries to great prominence.
   ``The Guide to Diplomatic Practice,'' the 1917 manual by Sir
Ernest Satow that clues protocol officers worldwide on the mysteries
of diplomatic etiquette, describes the dean as ``the mouthpiece of
his colleagues on diplomatic occasions, the defender of privileges
and immunities of the diplomatic corps from injuries or
encroachments.''
   In practice, the dean represents the diplomatic corps at the
White House every time a visiting head of state comes to town; he
sits on the right of the president's wife or the wife of the
secretary of state at official functions; he presents the official
toast on behalf of the ambassadors at White House or State
Department receptions in honor of the corps.
   The dean also represents the corps with the State Department on
collective problems of immunity or waivers for customs, taxation,
parking tickets and other bureaucratic nuisances.
   The deanship of Washington's diplomatic corps has a history of
great stability. Nicaraguan Ambassador Guillermo Sevilla Sacasa was
dean from 1958 to 1979. His ouster came with the overthrow of the
late Nicaraguan strongman Anastasio Somoza by the Sandinistas.
   He was replaced by Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin, who held the reins
until he was recalled to Moscow in 1986 to become secretary of the
Communist Party's Central Committee.
   At the ceremony marking the handing of the baton from Dobrynin to
Wachtmeister, then-Secretary of State George Shultz joked that it
was the first case in modern history of a communist handing over
power to a count.
   The chance to joke with secretaries of state and socialize
regularly with the president is a powerful draw.
   ``It's a great honor,'' said Cyprus' Jacovides, who presented his
credentials in July 1979. Cyprus, which holds the deanship of the
London diplomatic corps, would like to top the Washington list as
well. The Cypriot foreign service is small, and there is good job
security, joked Jacovides at a recent diplomatic reception.
   But Jacovides isn't worried if he doesn't get the job: he also is
accredited to Jamaica and the Bahamas and is the most senior
diplomat in at least one if not both of those countries. ``I can
just be dean there,'' he said.

   A federal appeals court on Monday ordered the
U.S. Department of Transportion to require transit authorities
across the country to equip new buses with wheelchair lifts.
   Attorneys who brought the lawsuit that led to the ruling called
it the most important decision ever handed down for handicapped
people needing public transportation.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a Transportation
Department regulation requiring all new buses to accommodate
wheelchairs conflicts with another allowing communities to offer
only an alternative service, such as special vans, to the
handicapped.
   The court said a rule requiring reservations 24 hours in advance
for use of the alternative transporation hinders the spontaneous use
of mass transit by the handicapped. As a result, the court ordered
transit authorities to make ``reasonable accommodations to their
programs, i.e. purchase wheelchair-accessible buses.''
   The court also upheld a controversial decision requiring the
Transportation Department to eliminate a cap on the amount of money
transit authorities need to spend on making transportion accessible.
   A coalition of disabled people and 12 organizations called
Americans Disabled for Accessible Public Transportation filed the
lawsuit last year.
   ADAPT contended that a provision of the federal regulations
allowed authorities receiving federal transportation funds to
exclude the handicapped from ``effective and meaningful'' access.
   The provision allows transit authorities to decide among three
types of handicapped-accessible transportation: accessible buses,
special vans for the handicapped, or a combination of the two.
   U.S. District Judge Marvin Katz overturned the provision in cases
where the transit authority buys any buses. He also overturned a
regulation requiring authorities to spend no more than 3 percent of
their average annual operating costs on transportation for the
handicapped.
   Katz called the limit arbitrary and said it allowed transit
agencies ``to eviscerate the civil right'' to transit service that
Congress mandated for the handicapped.
   Circuit Judge Carol Los Mansmann, in writing the 2-1 opinion,
also cited Congress' intent.
   ``Congress wanted to provide the disabled with the capability to
utilize mass transit to the `maximum extent feasible.' The DOT has
failed to show that requiring the future purchase of accessible
buses oversteps this legislative intent,'' Mansmann wrote.
   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Morton I. Greenberg said the
section requiring new buses to be accessible was not meant to apply
to transit systems choosing a paratransit system, such as special
vans.
   He also contended the 3 percent cap was not arbitrary.
   ``The impact of the majority's decision will be very substantial
throughout the country and will interfere with the local
decision-making authority,'' Greenberg wrote. ``I feel the court is
overreaching.''
   Timothy M. Cook, who argued the case before the court, said the
ruling was ``a major, major victory for the handicapped community.
... We can't say enough positive things about it.''
   Cook, who is now director of the Washington-based National
Disability Action Center, said he hoped the ruling would not be
appealed in light of President Bush's recent comments about wanting
to bring the handicapped into the mainstream.
   Transportation Department officials could not be reached for
comment after office hours Monday.

<HEAD>Region Needs $10 Billion over 5 Years to Restore Growth, Panel Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Central American nations need $2 billion
annually over the next five years as part of a strategy to restore
economic growth in the region after a decade of war, an independent
commission says.
   The report, released Monday by the International Commission for
Central American Recovery and Development, said at least $850
million should be earmarked during the first three years on such
urgent needs as caring for refugees and displaced persons.
   It said more than 160,000 Central Americans _ mostly Nicaraguans,
Salvadorans and Guatemalans _ have died over the past decade and
violence has uprooted between 2 million and 3 million others.
   ``Central America is caught in a vicious cycle in which war
thwarts development and the lack of development fuels war,'' said
Sonia Picado of Costa Rica, commission co-chairman, in a statement.
``The challenge is for the world to invest as generously in peace
and development in Central America as it has in supporting our armed
forces.''
   The 47 commission members from 20 countries in North and South
America, Europe and Asia recommended:
   _A $500 million increase to $2 billion annually in external
financial aid over the next five years to help Central America
achieve and sustain growth of 5.5 percent.
   _Full international support for peace and democracy as envisioned
in the Central American peace plan signed by the region's five
presidents in 1987. Military aid to rebel forces in the region
should be suspended.
   _Nations complying with the peace agreement should not be denied
financial or trade benefits because of ideology.
   _Outside aid to finance the revival of the Central American
Common Market and the creation of other regional institutions.
   _Unilateral trade concessions, lower tariffs and higher quotas on
Central American exports for at least a decade.
   _Measures to ease the region's debt burden.
   The commission, funded by private donations, was co-chaired by
Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of the
American Stock Exchange, and Ms. Picado, executive director of the
Inter-American Institute of Human Rights.
   Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C., had proposed formation of the
commission two years ago.
   Copies of the report were delivered Monday to Central America's
five presidents, who were meeting in El Salvador in a renewed effort
to achieve a peaceful settlement of area conflicts.

<HEAD>Kemp Visits Atlanta, Has Dinner with Coretta King</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jack Kemp was taking his first close-up look at
urban America today as secretary of Housing and Urban Development
with a side trip to a civil rights shrine and a promise to bring
``new life and new hope'' into inner cities.
   The former professional football player has been on the job for
more than a week, but he was formally sworn in Monday at a ceremony
presided over by President Bush.
   Kemp was beginning a two-day tour of Atlanta, visiting housing
projects, renewal programs, interim housing for the homeless, and
privately financed developments aimed at low- and moderate-income
families.
   Andrew Young, Atlanta's black, Democratic mayor, invited Kemp and
was leading his tour today.
   Kemp also planned to tour the Martin Luther King Jr. Center in
Atlanta, across the street from the slain civil rights leader's
grave, and to dine privately with King's widow, Coretta Scott King.
   Kemp recalled King's ``audacious faith'' in the future when he
accepted the appointment as secretary last month. He quoted King
again Monday in the ceremony before HUD employees in Washington,
saying the top concern at the department will be for public housing
residents, the poor and homeless, and struggling home buyers.
   ``Our job is to give them what Dr. King called a stake in the
American dream, a helping hand, and the equality of opportunity to
build a better future for themselves and their children,'' Kemp said.
   ``Our mission is to inject oxygen and seed corn and new life and
new hope into those distressed inner cities,'' Kemp said. ``This is
a compassionate society, and we will be compassionate at HUD.''
   Bush made the first visit by a president to the HUD building
since Jimmy Carter a dozen years ago. The president watched as his
former rival for the Republican presidential nomination was
administered the oath of office by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
   ``Jack's a man of ideas, and I've made clear I want him to apply
his creativity and energy to the area of housing and urban policy,
which are one of the most important and challenging issues in
America today,'' Bush said.
   Bush said his administration will push for urban enterprise
zones, using tax incentives to encourage job-creating business in
inner cities, and look for ways to improve public housing and make
home ownership available to tenants.
   ``I believe that given a chance, economic freedom can bring a
revival to the inner city, and it can create jobs and housing and
dignity for every citizen,'' Bush said.
   The references to football were frequent as Kemp invited a pair
of friends to join him for the ceremony _ Washington Redskins coach
Joe Gibbs, and Gene Upshaw, president of the National Football
League Players Association. Kemp was head of the players union in
the old AFL.
   Gibbs brought a football and tossed it to Kemp, who tossed it to
Bush as hundreds of HUD workers watched. There were no
incompletions, but the passes hardly covered one yard.
   Kemp, thanking Bush for his remarks, said, ``I particularly liked
the part, Mr. President, about a kinder, gentler quarterback.''

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in the latest auction, with rates on six-month
bills climbing to the highest level in nearly four years.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills
Monday at an average discount rate of 8.49 percent, down from 8.57
percent last week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 8.54 percent, up from 8.53 percent
last week.
   The rates for six-month bills were the highest since April 8,
1985, when they averaged 8.56 percent. The rates for three-month
bills were the lowest since they averaged 8.33 percent on Jan. 30.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.80 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,785.40 and 9.05 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,568.30.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages rose to 9.15 percent
last week, up from 9.05 percent the previous week.

<TEXT>
   ``The Fly II,'' a slimy sequel about the son of
mutated mad scientist Seth Brundle, swept into the No. 1 box office
spot ahead of the bank robbery farce ``Three Fugitives.''
   In its first weekend, ``The Fly II'' took in $6.8 million,
compared with $5.1 million for ``Three Fugitives,'' an oddball
comedy starring Nick Nolte and Martin Short.
   ``Rain Man,'' coupling Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise as an
unlikely brother duo, was in third place with $4.5 million. The film
has earned $102.2 million in nine weeks of release and is expected
to capture several Oscar nominations on Wednesday.
   The pairing of Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey in ``Beaches''
took fourth place with $3.7 million and Tom Selleck's ``Her Alibi''
was No. 5 with a $3.4 million take.
   ``Cousins,'' with ``Cheers'' TV star Ted Danson and Isabella
Rossellini, debuted in sixth with a $3 million gross even though it
was showing on only one-third the number of screens showing ``The
Fly II.''
   Another sibling picture, ``Twins,'' with Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Danny DeVito as brothers separated at birth, was seventh at $2.9
million.
   In eighth was ``Who's Harry Crumb?'' in ninth was ``Tap'' and
rounding out the Top 10 was ``Working Girl,'' another favorite for
Oscar contention.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations Co., with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.

<HEAD>Group Asks End to Bleached-Paper Milk Cartons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Enough dioxin could be getting into milk from
the bleached-paper cartons now in use to raise the risk of children
getting cancer, says an environmental group urging the Agriculture
Department to require different containers.
   The petition Monday by Greenpeace says the department could
require schools and other institutions receiving money from it to
buy their milk in cartons made of unbleached paper, glass or some
other material that is biodegradable and not putting the toxic
chemical in milk.
   The department provides some 5 billion half-pint cartons of milk
a year through five different subsidy programs.
   Greenpeace was relying on a Canadian government study reported
last fall that found dioxin leaching from cartons of bleached paper
into the milk. No government agencies have tested milk in the United
States.
   Milk's high fat content appears to attract dioxin from the paper,
according to Janet Hieber of Greenpeace. ``If the carton were filled
with water instead of milk, chances are the dioxin would have stayed
in the carton,'' she said.
   Washington television station WJLA conducted its own tests and
found dioxin in school milk at concentrations similar to those found
in Canada, according to Roberta Baskin, a WJLA reporter convering a
Greenpeace press conference Monday.
   Dioxin is the most powerful cause of cancer ever tested in lab
animals, but has not been shown to cause cancer in humans. Health
agency concerns about human cancer are based on animal studies. In
high doses, dioxin is a proven cause of a severe form of acne, and
some studies suggest it can cause reproductive disorders.
   Paper bleached with chlorine can contain tiny amounts of dioxin,
according to Environmental Protection Agency studies of paper mills
released two years ago. EPA said the amounts in products such as
toilet tissue were too small to be of concern.
   The concentration in eight ounces of milk in the Canadian tests
worked out to 0.6 picograms of the most potent form of dioxin per
kilogram of body weight for a child of 110 pounds. That is 100 times
the lifetime daily intake that the Environmental Protection Agency
says will increase the risk of cancer by one in a million.
   EPA's risk estimates for dioxin yield higher cancer estimates
than those used by other agencies. But even if EPA cut its risk
estimate as it is proposing to do, the Canadian milk would contain
six times as much dioxin as the amount that would raise the risk of
cancer by one in a million.
   Chris Lecos of the Food and Drug Administration said the agency
saw no immediate threat to health that would justify action without
further data. ``The basic concern is long-term exposure,'' he said.
   The Canadian study, he said, ``was quite limited, 18 samples, and
from only one area of Canada, around Halifax.''
   The agency and the paper industry are beginning a more detailed
study, said Carol Raulston, vice president for government affairs of
the American Paper Institute, the chief trade group. She said the
study should yield more reliable results in a few months.
   ``The industry is committed to providing safe packaging and if
there's anything they're uncomfortable with (at FDA), we'll have to
address that,'' Ms. Raulston said.
   Diane Durant, spokeswoman for the Food and Nutrition Service of
the Agriculture Department, said her agency was reviewing material
provided by Greenpeace.
   EPA spokeswoman Alicia Tenuta said she had been unable to reach
agency officials in a position to comment.

   Six months after he first uttered the
catch-phrase ``1,000 points of light,'' President Bush is still
trying to explain exactly what he meant.
   Bush said Monday that if he makes the point often enough, the
nation may finally come to understand what he was talking about.
   The phrase has sparked a flurry of jokes and even a protest
poster campaign since Bush used it at the Republican National
Convention last summer to refer to volunteer groups across the
country.
   The Boy Scouts of America became the latest group identified by
Bush as a point of light, during a White House event on Monday. He
lauded the group for its accomplishments and said:
   ``If we do this enough, and if I make the point how strongly I
feel about what you do, I think the country will understand very
clearly what I mean when I talk about 1,000 points of light,'' he
said.
   Bush first used the phrase in his acceptance speech last summer,
saying that the many American volunteer associations were like
``1,000 points of light, spread like stars in a broad and peaceful
sky.''
   The phrase baffled many people and sparked a flurry of Washington
word-plays and jokes, as well as a poster campaign featuring protest
posters that have appeared around the capital with the phrase,
``1,000 sparks of dissent.''
   Bush has resurrected it off and on since the election, on Monday
telling the Boy Scout group, ``I think of what you all do to help
others, and it's clear, bright light, bright and shining, and you're
an inspiration to all of us.''

<HEAD>Official: No Negotiations on Marcos Return Until U.S. Charges Resolved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philippine justice secretary today
ruled out any talks on the return of Ferdinand Marcos until the
ailing former president resolves criminal charges pending against
him in the United States.
   Marcos, in exile in Hawaii since he was ousted in a February 1986
popular uprising, has asked to be allowed to come home ``to die.''
President Corazon Aquino has refused to allow the return, citing
national security concerns.
   The deposed president and his wife, Imelda, were indicted in
October on federal racketeering charges for allegedly embezzling
more than $100 million from the Philippine treasury, funneling much
of it to foreign bank accounts and using it to buy prime New York
City real estate.
   Because of his ill health, Marcos has not been arraigned. In
January, he was admitted to a hospital in Honolulu for respiratory
ailments.
   Marcos, 71, was reported in guarded condition Monday in the
intensive care unit of Honolulu's St. Francis Medical Center.
   ``It is difficult to talk about the return of Marcos while he
faces criminal charges in the United States,'' Justice Secretary
Sedfrey Ordonez said in a television interview. ``In case he is
absolved, then we can talk about the issue of his coming home.''
   ``If the decision of the American court is that Marcos is not
guilty, then that's the time to discuss if he can really come
back,'' Ordonez said.
   Last week, Mateo Caparas, chairman of the Presidential Commission
on Good Government, confirmed that he met ``supposed
representatives'' of Marcos in the United States but said he ended
the talks after learning they were not authorized to speak for the
deposed leader.
   Caparas' commission is trying to recover up to $10 billion that
Mrs. Aquino's government claims Marcos plundered during his 20-year
rule. Marcos faces 39 civil suits in Manila but no criminal charges
have been filed.
   Ordonez said criminal charges would automatically be dropped if
the ailing Marcos were to die, but that the government can still sue
the estate.

   A fire on a barge late Monday night at the
Naval Weapons Station Earle injured five men, one seriously, before
it was brought under control early Tuesday, officials said.
   The five civilians were on ``a jack-up rig,'' used to probe the
bottom of Raritan Bay, said Gary Potterfield, a spokesman for the
weapons handling station. ``They jumped off the barge _ one of them
was injured seriously,'' he said.
   It remained unclear how the fire started on the barge, which
officials said measured 40 feet by 80 feet and was about 100 yards
off a pier.
   The blaze was controlled early Tuesday and everybody was
accounted for, Navy spokesman Scott Kalbach said.
   The five injured men worked for the Hans Padron surveying
company, Kalbach said, though he did not know where the company is
based or how it could be reached for comment.
   The Coast Guard was alerted at 10:50 p.m. and the fire was
brought under control before 12:30 a.m., said spokesman Jeff
Nickerson. He said the Coast Guard dispatched five vessels to fight
the blaze.
   ``The Navy is fighting the fire from the pier and the Coast Guard
from the water side,'' he said. ``Everyone in the water was
recovered and accounted for.''
   The Riverview Medical Center was treating one man for burns over
30 to 40 percent of his body, said Araxy Moosa, a night supervisor
at the Red Bank hospital.
   Three people were taken to Bayshore Community Hospital in
Holmdel, said nursing supervisor Martha Krieger. She said they were
brought in around midnight and she did not know their condition nor
their injuries.
   Winter said he believed victims may have been taken to Monmouth
Medical Center, but a nursing supervisor there would not give out
any information.
   About 700 civilians and about 400 military people work at the
base, which is used to load and unload weapons, Potterfield said.

<HEAD>Hastings Seeks Impeachment Dismissal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. District Court Judge Alcee L. Hastings,
impeached last year by the House of Representatives, is asking the
Senate to dismiss 16 of the 17 articles of impeachment.
   The 52-year-old Florida jurist sought dismissal of 15 counts in
which the House accused Hastings of conspiring with a Washington
attorney to receive a $150,000 payoff in exchange for a guarantee
that two racketeers would not serve time in prison.
   Hastings was acquitted in a 1983 criminal trial on that charge,
but the articles of impeachment also accuse him of making false
statements and fabricating evidence in the trial.
   Hastings contended that an impeachment trial on those counts
constitutes double jeopardy in view of his acquittal in criminal
court and also denies him due process because witnesses have died
and records have been lost.
   The motion seeks dismissal of the final, 17th article on grounds
that it is a ``catch-all'' count aimed at allowing the Senate to
remove Hastings from the bench with a finding that he is unfit even
if a majority finds him innocent on each of the 16 other articles.
   The only article of impeachment which Hastings didn't seek to
have dismissed is one that accuses him of disclosing secret wiretap
information in an unrelated investigation to Steve Clark, the mayor
of Dade County, Fla.

   A Pittsburgh company will donate $600,000 to
three medical associations to settle complaints of false
advertising, according to the Federal Trade Commission.
   General Nutrition Corp. signed a consent decree under which it
pledged not to make false or unsubstantiated claims about its
products, the FTC said Monday.
   Signing the decree is not an admission of any violations.
Violation of its terms can mean a fine of $10,000.
   The commission said the company made false and unsubstantiated
claims that its ``Healthy Greens'' diet supplement was effective in
reducing the risk of cancer.
   Also, the commission said, the company falsely claimed that six
other supplements, mainly sold to body builders, promoted weight
loss, increased muscle growth and slowed aging.
   The consent order was approved by a 3-1 vote. Commissioner Margot
Machol did not participate. The dissenter, Commissioner Mary L.
Azcuenaga, said the order left the company ``free to sell products
it knows are deceptively labeled.''
   The money will be split among the American Heart Association, the
American Diabetes Association and the American Cancer Society.

<NOTE>No Halt To Government Sales of Gas, Despite `Serious' Shortage</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department says it will keep selling
tritium to private customers despite what it calls an approaching
shortage of the radioactive gas used in manufacturing most U.S.
nuclear weapons.
   The government has been selling tritium to private corporations
and research groups, both domestic and foreign, for decades. The
practice has come under review since the nation's only maker of the
gas was shut down last spring.
   The Energy Department, in charge of making all U.S. nuclear
warheads and their components, has cited the risk of a tritium
squeeze in urging Congress to approve construction of two
new-generation tritium-producing reactors to replace the aging and
inefficient Savannah River reactor complex near Aiken, S.C.
   The Savannah River reactors were closed down last spring for
safety-related reasons, and no firm timetable for resuming operation
has been set.
   Phil Keif, a department spokesman, said Monday officials decided
to continue the tritium sales since the amounts involved are ``a
small piece'' of total supplies, and since the government expects at
least one of the three Savannah River reactors to be restarted by
year's end.

   A Mount Pulaski, Ill., company plans to make a
no-calorie, high-fiber flour from corn cobs for use in fiber-rich
bread, cereals, doughnuts and other foods, the Agriculture
Department says.
   Mount Pulaski Products Inc. will produce the dietary fiber using
a process patented by two USDA scientists, J. Michael Gould and Lee
B. Dexter, at the Northern Regional Research Center, Peoria, Ill.
   In a statement issued Monday by the department's Agricultural
Research Service, Gould said the process ``softens the fibrous parts
of corn cobs and other cereal crops so they can be ground and used
as a no-calorie, high-fiber product.''
   Gould said tests showed the material can boost the fiber content
of baked goods such as pancake and cake mixes up to 30 percent
without affecting taste.
   The Mount Pulaski firm expects to provide 25 to 30 new jobs for
rural central Illinois, the agency said.

<HEAD>Duquesne Student Leaders Shut Down Campus Paper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Duquesne University's campus newspaper has been
shut down by the student government in a dispute reportedly
resulting from a birth control advertisement.
   The decision was made because of ``serious concerns'' unrelated
to the Duke's editorial content, said Happy Meltzer, president of
the Roman Catholic school's student government.
   But an attorney for the paper, Joel A. Klein, said, ``As far as
we know it is over the ad. It's a form of censorship. But it's more
than censorship. I see it as the latest attempt to gain control of
the student newspaper, so it is no longer an independent voice of
the students.''
   Editors recently refused Meltzer's request to pull an ad by
Family Planning Services regarding confidential contraceptive
counseling. Meltzer said Monday the ad was inappropriate because it
conflicted with the mission of the Roman Catholic college.
   The Student Government Association appropriates funds to various
student organizations. This year, it gave $10,000 to the Duke, which
also generates money through advertising.
   In 1984, the university administration suspended the Duke because
of an April Fool's Day parody that included references to sexual
acts and sex organs.
   ``Student government really got on the bandwagon then trying to
repress the paper,'' Klein said. ``It's been simmering ever since.
They're using the ad as a pretext to go after the paper on the
larger issue of control, part of which is its independent checking
account.''
   Ann Rago, a Duquesne spokeswoman, said the university has nothing
to do with the controversy because it is a conflict among students.

<TEXT>
   Japanese construction industry officials and
academics will visit Nicaragua next month to study prospects for
building a canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans,
Nicaragua's envoy to Tokyo said today.
   From 10 to 12 builders will go to Nicaragua, including
representatives of several major construction firms who are ``very
much interested in the project,'' Jorge Huezo, the Nicaraguan
ambassador to Japan, told reporters during a briefing at the embassy.
   Huezo declined to identify the Japanese firms, but said they were
among the four or five companies involved in a feasibility study. He
said about 20 university professors have also expressed interest in
the study.
   Finance Minister William Hupper of Nicaragua announced Friday
that ountry planned to build a canal and welcomed the
``collaboration of any and all'' governments, institutions and
private companies.
   Hupper estimated that the feasibility study would take about
three years to complete and that construction of canal would require
10 more years.
   On Monday, an official of Japan's Foreign Ministry said private
Japanese firms have been holding talks with the leftist Sandinista
government.
   He said, however, that the Japanese government will ``not
consider participation in the Nicaraguan canal project on a
governmental level'' because it is working with the United States
and Panama on a project to construct a second Panama canal.
   Under an agreement signed in 1985, the three countries will
complete studies on alternatives to the Panama Canal by September
1990.
   At the turn of the century, Nicaragua was considered as a
possible canal site, but Panama was finally chosen. The United
States has a lease on the Panama Canal until 1999.

<TEXT>
   South Florida's weather has been the envy of the
nation in recent weeks, but the abnormally hot, dry winter is
depleting the region's water supplies, drying up wetlands and
hastening the start of the wildfire season.
   From Lake Okeechobee to Key West, rainfall has been running only
about 50 percent of its historic average since December.
   Combine that with temperatures consistently in the low 80s, at
least 5 degrees hotter than normal, and you have the makings of a
drought.
   ``You might as well call it the south Florida desert,'' says
Henry LaRose, a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey office
in Fort Myers. ``The trouble is, things are going to get worse
before they get better.''
   That's because the region is in the midst of its cyclical
winter-spring dry season that doesn't end until June, when afternoon
showers and hurricane-fed storms become the norm.
   Rainfall was slightly below normal last summer, and the drought
began to take hold around October.
   ``What we've had this year is three or four very dry months
before the dry season even started,'' said Steve Lamb, water-use
director for the South Florida Water Management District. ``Now we
don't have any substantial rain to look forward to for months.''
   ``Normal rain of two inches a month isn't going to solve it,'' he
added. ``We need several days of soaking rain.''
   Lake Okeechobee, the 714-square-mile heart of the region's water
system and its primary source of drinking water, has been dropping
steadily since last April and could reach a critically low depth of
10 feet by the end of May, according to water district spokeswoman
Anne Overton. The lowest level on record came during the drought of
1981, when the lake dipped to 9.75 feet.
   Mandatory water-use restrictions already have been imposed on the
Gulf Coast resort of Marco Island, in parts of coastal Lee County
and in northern Palm Beach and Martin counties.
   ``It's not unusual to have water-use cutbacks _ what's unusual is
to have them so early in the year,'' Lamb said. ``As far as water
levels go, this is what we're used to seeing in late April and May _
not February.''
   Southwest Florida homeowners who depend on backyard wells for
their water needs are beginning to come up dry with groundwater
levels as much as 8 feet below what they were two years ago.
   The lack of rain is also having an impact on the Everglades,
which despite some flows of water from Lake Okeechobee is already
starting to show subtle signs of spring-like dryness. Areas on the
fringe of Everglades National Park that are usually covered in water
are now too dry to ride an airboat across and some parts of the
wetlands are hard enough to walk on.
   A major concern from the dryness is wildfires, which tore through
the Everglades and every region of the state in 1981 and 1985. In
each of those years at least 150,000 acres were blackened and
hundreds of homes destroyed.
   ``We're not only expecting a busy year, we've already got a busy
year,'' said David Utley, district administrator for the state
Division of Forestry. ``We normally only had four fires a week, now
we're running out to two or three a day.''
   Even though the fire season doesn't officially begin until March,
state firefighters already have responded to 72 fires this year,
Utley said.
   ``We're preparing to step everything up to suppress the big fires
we expect in March and April,'' Utley said.
   ``Most of the time we just watch the fire to make sure it doesn't
get too close to a road or a populated area,'' said forestry duty
officer Peter Karayeanes. ``We let it burn itself out so we don't
have to go into the same spot anytime soon.''
   Significant rain is the only hope of turning the dry spell
around, but long-range forecasts from the National Weather Service
give little hope for relief. They call for more of the same:
temperatures above normal, rainfall below.

   Hurricane-force winds that lashed

   In some of the strongest turbulence since a hurricane swept

part of a soccer stadium and the roofs of dozens of homes,
Manchester police reported.
   Overturned trucks blocked the M1, one of Britain's main highways,
for several hours near the city of Wakefield in northern England.
   In the hilly Lake District of northwest England, fallen trees
blocked roads, parts of the town of Barrow and the village of
Glenridding were flooded, and trucks were blown over on the M6 and
A66 freeways.
   In northeast England, police stopped large trucks and other
high-sided vehicles crossing the world's longest cable suspension
bridge over the Humber estuary for several hours because of the
danger of them being blown off.
   The main span of the bridge measures 4,626 feet.
   In Scotland, the strong winds disrupted ferry services.
   In Northern Ireland, police said several homes and other
buildings were damaged by gales.
   Meteorologists at the Malin Head weather station at the northern
tip of Ireland said they recorded gusts of up to 99 mph.

   The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen in Tokyo
Tuesday because of concern over possible interest rate hikes, while
the stock market edged downward in mixed trading, dealers said.
   The dollar ended the day's trading at 127.20 yen, down 1.10 yen
from Monday's closing of 128.30 yen. It opened at 127.68 yen and
ranged between 127.00 and 127.82 yen during the day.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which declined 146.67 points Monday, fell a slight
2.43 points or less than 0.01 percent, closing at 31,982.98.
   Dealers said the U.S. currency eased in Tokyo following a similar
decline Monday in New York, where it closed at 128.08 yen, down from
Friday's finish of 128.68 yen.
   ``Many market players are taking a cautious position'' regarding
dollar transactions, said a dealer with the Mitsubishi Bank in Tokyo.
   The trend will likely continue until Friday's release of U.S.
merchandise trade figures for December, he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Civilian Rewarded For Saving Government $6 Million</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military technician who was worried
about the safety of a $4,500 infrared light tester used on
helicopters went to the local hardware store and built his own _ for
$8.75.
   Now, after saving the military more than $6 million a year, John
Ledoux is getting his reward: a check for $25,000.
   Ledoux, a part-time sergeant in the Vermont Army National Guard
and a full-time civilian employee of an Army National Guard base in
Burlington, Vt., received a $10,000 incentive prize from the
government more than a year ago.
   Today he was to receive the larger prize from the federal Office
of Personnel Management.
   ``I'm just kind of glad I'm finally getting the monetary award.
It seems like it's a long time coming,'' said Ledoux, who explained
that bureaucratic errors delayed the check.
   ``I feel like it's been put off for so long it's lost its glow,''
he said. ``But I'm glad things are finally coming to a head.''
   The award is the maximum allowed by law and the largest given to
a federal employee, said Joseph Jamele, press secretary for Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. He said only 20 such awards have ever been
granted.
   Ledoux, 33 and father of five, said the money would come in handy.
   ``My wife and I have a big family so, of course, the money is
nice,'' he said.
   Ledoux said he developed his hand-held device in 1986 after
watching engineers with the Lockheed Aircraft Corp. install infrared
lights on helicopters using the standard-issue testing device, which
was built into a pair of goggles.
   Ledoux said the engineers often perched in precarious positions
on the helicopters to test the lights. Concerned for their safety,
he went down to a local electronics store and picked up a
phototransistor, a light-emitting diode, a switch and a nine-volt
battery. After fiddling around with the parts for a couple of days,
he put the device together.
   He said it took the Army a bit longer to realize the potential
savings. First he sent a diagram of the device, but it was only
after he sent the device itself that the Army congratulated him on
his ingenuity.
   Army officials are crediting the device with saving 987,000 hours
of labor a year, for a total of $6.85 million. They estimate net
savings of $6.3 million after subtracting the costs of materials and
of implementing the device.
   Jamele said Ledoux's buddies in the National Guard now call him
``the $6 million man.''

   A man jailed on suspicion of killing
his ex-girlfriend's grandmother and aunt had been released after
being questioned in the recent slaying of the women's friend,
authorities say.
   And a relative of the two women is threatening revenge if the man
is released again.
   ``If he gets out again we're going to do something about it,''
Freddie Alexander, 52, said outside the ramshackle house where the
partly clothed bodies of his 88-year-old mother-in-law and
58-year-old sister-in-law were found Sunday.
   ``He will not walk the streets in this county again as long as
there is family here.''
   Authorities questioned the ex-boyfriend of Rose Griffin on Monday
night in connection with the sexual molestations and stabbing deaths
of Mary Bell Simmons and her daughter, Georgia Mae Thomas.
   Alexander, his wife, Dorothy, and police found the bodies Sunday.
   Bloodhounds led authorities to an area near the suspect's home,
several blocks from where the bodies were found. The 28-year-old man
was arrested that night.
   The man had been arrested two weeks ago and released on $5,000
bond following the strangulation of a close friend of the slain
women. No murder charges have been filed in either case.
   Relatives said the man started making threats against the family
after he and his girlfriend broke up just before the first slaying.
   ``He's a maniac and he was going out with my cousin,'' said
Dorothy Appleton. ``He said he was going to kill everyone in this
family.''
   The bodies of Ms. Simmons and Ms. Thomas, who moved back to
Mississippi in 1978 from Chicago to take care of her elderly mother,
were found in a bedroom of their home. A butcher knife used in the
slayings was found near the bed, authorities said.
   Bertha Peterson, 47, was found dead Jan. 29 in her home on the
other side of Port Gibson, a town of about 2,300 halfway between the
Mississippi River towns of Natchez and Vicksburg.
   ``They were my grandma and my auntie,'' said Griffin. ``And the
first lady was my best friend.''
   Claiborne County Sheriff Frank Davis said he believes the three
slayings are connected.
   He said the man was arrested after the first killing and
questioned about it and was charged in an unrelated house break-in.
There was not enough evidence to press a murder charge, Davis said.
The man was released Saturday after his relatives posted bond.
   The man was being held Monday night in the county jail and had
not been charged pending the return of reports from the Mississippi
Crime Lab, Davis said.
   ``We like to charge people on evidence and at that time there was
not enough evidence,'' Davis said.
   The women found Sunday had stab wounds to the chest, were
sexually assaulted and were undressed from the waist down,
authorities said. Ms. Peterson had been beaten and sexually
assaulted before being strangled, Davis said.
   Freddie Alexander said the suspect had frequently done odd jobs
for the two women killed Sunday and neighbors had told him the man
delivered a load of firewood Sunday morning.
   ``I guess that's the way he is. He does something nice and then
he explodes,'' Freddie Alexander said. ``But if that guy hits the
street, I'm going to do something.''

   Jury selection began Monday in the trial
of four members of the Ecclesia Athletic Association accused of
beating to death the 8-year-old daughter of the group's leader.
   The three men and one woman are charged with manslaughter in the
Oct. 13 death of Dayna Broussard, daughter of Eldridge Broussard Jr.
   Broussard founded the religious-athletic camp at a rural house
southeast of Portland. He also ran the Watts Christian Center in Los
Angeles.
   Prosecutors say they plan to present evidence that Dayna was
struck hundreds of times, slammed against a wall and floor, and hung
out a window on the night she died.
   Defense attorneys have not disclosed what their arguments will
consist of.
   Fifty-three other children at the camp were taken into state
custody after Dayna's death, and authorities said many of them were
subjected to ritualistic whippings with a paddle or electrical cord
while the others were forced to watch.
   The children were removed from a sparsely furnished farmhouse
after Ecclesia members delivered Dayna's body to a fire station.
   Broussard, 35, denied that the children were beaten or abused,
saying they were only spanked. He was in Los Angeles at the time of
his daughter's death and was not charged.
   The four defendants are Willie K. Chambers, 35, Brian J. Brinson,
30, Frederick P. Doolittle, 38, and Constance Z. Jackson, 37.
   Only one prospective juror was questioned Monday and he will be
asked to return Tuesday when the process resumes. Potential jurors
were asked to respond to a 12-page questionnaire asking if they are
prejudiced against any religious beliefs or have any philosophy
regarding physical discipline of children, among other things.
   Defense attorneys wanted to interview some of the children, but
the Oregon Supreme Court last week rejected their requests to speak
with the youths. The state's high court gave no explanation for its
ruling, saying only that details would be released later.
   The Supreme Court ruling could cause problems for the defense,
particularly since the prosecution plans to use 10 of the children
as witnesses, attorneys said Monday.
   ``In 25 years of law practice ... I have never started a trial
when I have been prevented from interviewing the witnesses,'' said
Ron Thom, who represents Brinson.
   Broussard announced last month that he was leaving for a 40-day
spiritual retreat and would be unavailable until March 12.
   Defense attorneys said Monday they knew Broussard would be gone
and they don't expect his absence to affect their case.
   Attorneys say they expect the trial to last about six weeks.

<HEAD>Study Predicts Sharp Growth In Asian Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Asia's already teeming cities will
grow rapidly in the 1990s, requiring major efforts to provide
adequate housing, communications and transport, an Asian Development
Bank study said today.
   The bank predicted that by the end of the century, 12 of the
world's 25 largest urban centers will be in developing Asian
countries.
   They will include the Indian cities of Calcutta, with a
population forecasted to increase from 9.5 million to 16.5 million,
and Bombay, predicted to rise from 8.5 million to 16 million.
   Many of the future super cities are already jammed with hundreds
of thousands of squatters, beggars and unskilled laborers who have
flocked to urban centers to escape poverty in the countryside.
   The population increase ``will place considerable strain on
municipal services such as water supply, electricity, transport
facilities, housing, communications and public health services,''
the report says.
   ``Adequate provision of these support systems will thus require
major efforts in planning and development,'' it adds.
   The study attributes the predicted increase in city dwellers on a
shift from agriculture to industry and continuing high birth rates.
   ``India will thus have to cope with an additional 98 million
urban dwellers, China with 73 million, Indonesia with 25 million and
Thailand with 7 million over the 1990s,'' the bank said.
   According to the bank, Asian economies will continue to grow at a
healthy rate through the coming decade, although ``regional
disparities'' will still be profound.
   The study says Asian nations averaged an economic growth rate of
more than 6 percent a year in the 1970s and 1980s, bringing vast
improvements in the quality of life in nations such as South Korea,
Singapore and Taiwan.
   However, the report says that ``despite all that has been
achieved in terms of increases in production and improvements in
social conditions, Asia still remains the habitat of half a billion
persons living lives of deprivation and extreme poverty.''
   It says the number of women of child-bearing age is expected to
increase from 640 million to nearly 900 million throughout Asia's
developing countries _ excluding China _ by the end of the century.
   ``The need to control population growth will remain pressing in
lower-income (countries),'' the report says. ``To accomplish this,
emphasis needs to be devoted to the extension of women's education
and health facilities ... to greater participation by women in the
work force and to efforts to encourage delay in the age of marriage
and family formation.''
   It says the life expectancy in Asia's developing countries is
expected to rise from an average of 64 years in 1990 to 66 years a
decade later.
   ``However, this will range from an average of 52 in Nepal to 76
in Hong Kong,'' the report said.
   The Asian Development Bank, based in Manila, raises funds from
private and public sources to finance and direct development
programs within Asia, advise on economic policies and provide
technical assistance.

<HEAD>Opposition: Gov't Should Delay Election To Allow More Campaigning</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders have threatened to
boycott scheduled May 1 elections if the new military government
does not postpone the balloting to give them time to organize.
   Early elections ``do not allow the serious participation of our
parties on the basis of equality of opportunities without any
discrimination,'' said an opposition petition filed with the
government Monday.
   The petition also calls for creation of an independent panel to
reform electoral law.
   Gen. Andres Rodriguez called the election shortly after he ousted
Gen. Alfredo Stroessner in a bloody Feb. 3 coup, ending nearly 35
years of authoritarian rule. Rodriguez is the presidential candidate
of the ruling Colorado Party, which has ruled Paraguay since 1947.
   The two-page petition stops short of suggesting an election
schedule, though opposition leaders have said they need at least six
months and perhaps as much as two years to prepare.
   ``If all of our conditions are rejected, it would be impossible
to participate even if we wanted to because none of us are on voter
registration lists,'' said Domingo Laino of the Authentic Radical
Liberal Party.
   Laino said he expected a reply within one week.
   The May 1 election date is based on a constitutional clause
calling for elections within three months of the resignation,
disability or death of a president.
   Laino, Paraguay's most popular opposition leader, and leaders of
the Revolutionary Febrerista and Christian Democrat parties argue
that since Stroessner was deposed by coup, that clause does not
apply.
   Laino was exiled under Stroessner and his party banned, along
with the Christian Democrats.
   Opposition leaders say they need time to register their voters
and campaign to have any chance to unseat the rich, well-entrenched
Colorado Party.
   The provisional government has indicated that voter lists might
be updated before the election but so far has not said unequivocally
that it would do so, and if so, how or when.
   An unofficial U.S. delegation led by Robert White, who was U.S.
ambassador to Paraguay under the Carter administration, left
Asuncion Monday after meeting with opposition leaders and members of
the provisional government.
   ``I think we're going to see in Paraguay one group that honestly
wants democracy, and another group that would prefer the status quo
continued in one way or another _ Stroessnerism without
Stroessner,'' White said.
   Said former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt: ``I think not only for
the United States but for all the international community the
question that will be most frequently asked is, will there be real
electoral and institutional reforms before the elections.''
   U.S. Ambassador Timothy Towell met for more than an hour Monday
with Rodriguez. Afterwards, Towell told reporters, ``We will work
together to achieve these goals: democracy and the respect for
international norms of human rights.''
   At least 50 troops were reported killed in the coup, which sent
Stroessner into Brazilian exile.

   The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen today
following rumors that the United States wants a cheaper dollar to
help cut its trade deficit, traders said, and stock prices dipped
slightly.
   The dollar closed at 127.20 yen, down 1.10 yen from Monday's
close of 128.30 yen. It opened at 127.68 yen and traded in a range
of 127.00-127.82 yen.
   Japanese press reports that an unidentified U.S. Senate Banking
Committee member had said the dollar should fall to 120 yen to
improve U.S. trade figures prompted a wave of panic selling early in
the day, said Kaneo Ogino, a trader at Goldman Sachs.
   ``There was a panic as bankers sold dollars to protect their
positions,'' Ogino said.
   Later reports quoting unidentified sources in the committee as
denying the comments failed to relieve bearish sentiment in the
Tokyo market, he said.
   Traders said the currency market also was mired in confusion over
the possibility of U.S. or European interest rate hikes.
   ``Many market players are taking a cautious position'' toward the
dollar that probably will continue until Friday's release of U.S.
merchandise trade figures for December, said a dealer with the
Mitsubishi Bank in Tokyo.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 146.67-point loser Monday, fell 2.43 points, or
less than 0.01 percent, closing at 31,982.98.
   Stock price movements were mixed due to uncertainty over
developments in the so-called Recruit scandal, traders said. On
Monday, prosecutors arrested four people, including Hiromasa Ezoe,
founder of information services conglomerate Recruit Co., on
suspicion of having given or received bribes.
   Ezoe allegedly sold tens of thousands of unlisted shares of
Recruit Cosmos, a real estate subsidiary of Recruit, at bargain
prices to politicians, their aides, business leaders and other
select people. The purchasers profited when over-the-counter trading
in the Recruit Cosmos shares began and prices skyrocketed.
   The scandal has rocked the government of Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita.

   A couple who became sweethearts
through heart transplants will share their engagement with millions
tonight on national television.
   Don Homrich, 28, used a moving billboard in New York's Times
Square to propose to Terri Nelson on Sunday _ to the glare of
television cameras for Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``A Current Affair.''
   ``We're hoping that by letting everyone in on this it will help
other people with heart disease,'' said Homrich, 28. ``Some feel
that life's over and we hope that through this it'll give people
hope about the future.''
   The couple, who were featured on the show last month, had agreed
to let camera crews in on their short trip to New York for a
follow-up story. But Nelson, 30, said the proposal was a complete
surprise.
   ``All of a sudden I looked up and saw the sign that said,
``Terri, will you marry me?' When I got over the shock I said
`yes','' Nelson said in a telephone interview Monday.
   The couple met in 1987 after Nelson's heart transplant. Homrich,
who received a new heart in 1984, called Nelson to encourage her to
come to a local organ donor support group.
   Both suffered from cardiomyopathy, a degenerative heart condition
that enlarges, overworks and weakens the organ.
   The couple have not yet set a date for the wedding.

   A summit of five Central
American presidents has become mired in a dispute over who should
monitor moves that Nicaragua's leftist government promises to make
toward democracy.
   The long-delayed meeting, an attempt to revive a stalled 1987
regional peace plan, enters its final day today.
   Nicaragua has pushed for the United Nations, the Organization of
American States and human rights groups to monitor its democratic
reforms in the region.
   The other four countries, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and
Costa Rica want a watchdog commission comprised exclusively of
Central Americans.
   ``We have the moral authority to select a commission of Central
Americans,'' Foreign Minister Ricardo Acevedo of El Salvador told a
news conference.
   ``They are afraid'' of foreign observers, Foreign Minister Miguel
D'Escoto of Nicaragua said of the other governments. ``It's
indispensible, if you want to have credibility, to have outside
auditing.''
   The reforms, such as free and fair elections, were a key element
in the August 1987 plan to end warfare and strengthen democracy in
the region.
   Nicaragua's neighbors have criticized its ruling Sandinista Party
as authoritarian and are pressuring Managua to honor the regional
peace plan by instituting political reforms.
   They say the Sandinistas have no excuse for not doing so now that
the Contra rebels have retreated into Honduras, stripped of U.S.
military aid.
   D'Escoto and Acevedo spoke late Monday as Presidents Daniel
Ortega of Nicaragua, Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras, Oscar Arias of
Costa Rica, Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala and Jose Napoleon Duarte of
El Salvador worked in a closed meeting.
   Arias, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for the plan, said
Monday that the summit offered the five presidents a chance to
``regain credibility'' by getting the peace process moving again.
   The plan helped prod the Sandinistas and Contra rebels into
signing a preliminary cease-fire in March after seven years of
fighting. But civil wars continue in El Salvador and Guatemala.
   Ortega has indicated that Nicaragua might hold elections
scheduled for November 1990 sooner than planned to show that the
Sandinistas are ready for democratic reforms.
   He was quoted in today's editions of The New York Times as saying
in an interview taht his government plans to hold the elections in
the first three months of 1990.
   Opposition political groups in Nicaragua have dismissed promises
of democratic reform as window dressing and say the Sandinistas must
guarantee the right of free assembly and give up control of the
electoral system to ensure free elections.
   Paul Reichler, a consultant hired by the Sandinistas, said Monday
that they are ready for change because they now regards the Contras
as a defeated force.
   He said the Sandinistas also hope to leave the summit with an
agreement from Honduras to dismantle refugee camps for an estimated
11,000 Contra guerrillas on that country's territory.
   The regional peace plan specifies that no Central American
country allow its territory be used for attacks on another. It also
bans outside aid to insurgents. The Contras fled to Honduras after
U.S. military aid expired 12 months ago.
   Members of the Nicaraguan delegation said Monday that Ortega
presented a proposal on rebel disarmament to Azcona at the Feb. 2
inauguration of President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela.
   Under the proposal, the Contras could take advantage of an
amnesty offered by the Sandinistas or go to third countries under
the supervision of international organizations. The Sandinistas
would release the estimated 3,500 Contras and former Nicaraguan
national guardsmen now in Sandinista prisons.
   Opening the meeting Monday, the five presidents were encouraged
by the mere fact that they were together at this beach resort 40
miles southeast of San Salvador.
   The summit had been rescheduled and postponed five times over six
months. The last Central American summit was 13 months ago, the
original deadline for implementing the peace plan.

   Gov. Gaston Caperton, elected on a
pledge to straighten out West Virginia's troubled economy, proposed
a massive borrowing program to allow the state to pay its overdue
bills and build new schools.
   Caperton, fresh from a special legislative session that gave him
$392 million in tax increases, asked the Legislature on Monday for
authority to borrow up to $765 million more.
   ``Let there be no mistake _ the people of this state need no
longer despair over the financial condition of West Virginia because
this governor, and this Legislature, will pay their bills on time,''
Caperton said to applause from a joint session of the Senate and
House of Delegates.
   In his first State of the State address, the Democrat presented
lawmakers with a proposed $1.781 billion budget for 1989-90, with
budget cuts averaging 4.5 percent for all state agencies except
education, health and human services.
   The current state budget is $1.464 billion. The state deficit is
projected to be $260 million by June 30 and $376 million by next
year.
   Caperton defeated three-term Gov. Arch Moore last year in a
campaign that focused on Moore's handling of the state's economy,
which has been battered in recent years by widespread unemployment,
a slump in the coal industry and cuts in federal assistance.
   During Moore's last year in office, Standard &amp; Poor's imposed an
emergency ``financial watch'' on West Virginia, the state's largest
school system threatened to close down and the state Supreme Court
declared the state budget unconstitutional because it threatened
West Virginia's tenuous financial stability.
   Caperton asked for 5 percent pay raises for public school
teachers and state workers beginning Jan. 1, but only if the state
can save $40 million to $45 million in the first six months of the
fiscal year to pay for them. He also endorsed a plan to merge West
Virginia and Marshall universities.
   The governor said he wants authority to borrow up to $500 million
for school construction.
   He proposed borrowing funds to pay $85 million in backlogged
insurance claims and repay a $50 million loan from the state
consolidated investment fund.
   In addition, he said he wants to borrow $130 million, to be
repaid through tolls, as part of a plan to replace the West Virginia
Turnpike with the West Virginia Parkway Economic Development and
Tourism Authority.
   Caperton also proposed a constitutional amendment eliminating the
elected posts of agriculture commissioner, secretary of state and
treasurer in 1992.

   Former congressman Wayne L. Hays was
eulogized as a friend of common folk and an ally of Washington's
power elite at a funeral service.
   Hays died Friday after suffering a heart attack at his home in
this eastern Ohio city. He was 77.
   ``Wayne Hays lived and breathed his job as representative of the
18th congressional district,'' said John Malick, a Belmont County
commissioner and longtime friend of the 14-term congressman.
   ``No request was denied. He was fair to Republican and Democrat
alike, rich or poor, black or white. It made no difference.''
   There was no mention, however, of Hays' affair with House clerk
Elizabeth Ray in 1976 that touched off a payroll-sex scandal that
drove him from Congress.
   About 170 people wore heavy coats and gloves during the service
in the East Richland Evangelical Friends Church after its furnace
broke down the previous night.
   Fred Diab, a friend of Hays since childhood, said family members
were disappointed at the turnout but blamed confusion over an
earlier announcement that the service would be closed to the public.
   Hays' wife, Pat, had planned a private service but later changed
her mind, said Monte Beck of the Beck Funeral Home. ``She decided he
was a public man, so why not have a public funeral.''
   Only a few local officeholders attended the funeral. Former
Cleveland Mayor Dennis Kucinich and former U.S. Rep. Robert
Mollohan, D-W.Va., paid their respects on Sunday at the funeral
home, Beck said.
   Malick said Hays was a gentle man who looked out for his
constituents, and he recalled a day when Hays was traveling to
Cleveland and stopped to help a farmer.
   ``He was riding along and saw a cow out in a field calving. Wayne
stopped the car, got out, notified the farmer and stayed there with
him to help deliver that calf,'' Malick said. ``He was an hour late
for his meeting in Cleveland, but that's the way Wayne was.''
   Hays also was known for bringing prominent people from Washington
to Belmont County, Diab said.
   ``I'll never forget when he brought John Kennedy here in 1960,''
Diab said.
   ``You never knew who was going to show up down here with Wayne.''
   Malick said Hays counted Kennedy, presidents Harry Truman and
Lyndon B. Johnson and former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger
and Dean Rusk among his allies in Washington.
   Hays was elected to his first term in the U.S. House in 1948. He
became chairman of the House Administration Committee in 1971 and
chairman of the House Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
two years later.

<TEXT>
   A judge who fled Colombia after receiving death
threats from leaders of a major drug cartel has become Detroit's
worst-kept secret in the three days since a newspaper disclosed she
was living here.
   An executive with The Detroit News, which first reported on
Sunday that Consuelo Sanchez-Duran had been relocated here, said the
public's right to know outweighed any potential threat to the judge.
   Sanchez's cover was blown further in today's editions of the
Detroit Free Press. The newspaper said she has worked under her own
name as Colombia's consul general in the Detroit suburb of
Southfield since October, shortly after she and her husband Augusto
arrived in Detroit.
   The Free Press also identified her current residence by name.
   The News on Monday identified the Southfield apartment complex
where Sanchez originally stayed but did not specifically identify
the Detroit residence to which she was moved last week.
   Sanchez fled Colombia after issuing a murder charge against Pablo
Escobar Gaviria. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, Escobar heads the Medellin cartel, blamed for
smuggling most of the cocaine that reaches the United States.
   Escobar has not been tried. Law enforcement officials who
requested anonymity say he has offered a $1 million murder contract
for Sanchez. Members of the cartel are suspected of carrying out
dozens of killings in Latin America and the United States.
   A letter from the Medellin cartel published in August in
Colombian newspapers threatened Sanchez if she signed the arrest
warrant.
   ``We are capable of executing you anywhere on this planet,'' the
letter said. ``There is no place you can hide.''
   The U.S. State Department declined to comment on whether Sanchez
would be relocated in the wake of the reports.
   Frank Matthews, director of security awareness for the Bureau of
Diplomatic Security, also said he could not comment on whether
action would be taken against tne News' sources, which it said were
some of the 70 local off-duty police officers hired to guard Sanchez.
   A spokeswoman at the Colombian embassy in Washington who declined
identification had no comment Monday on the News' reports or whether
that nation's government would ask that Sanchez be relocated.
   Roberto Castro, vice consul of the Colombian consulate in
Southfield, told the Free Press that Sanchez went to work Monday but
was not allowed to discuss anything except consulate business.
   Robert Giles, executive editor of the News, defended the
newspaper's reports.
   ``You balance whatever the presumed risk to the judge against
whether the community needs to know about this ... and there was no
question'' to run the story, he said.
   In reporting on Sanchez's current whereabouts, Giles said: ``We
recognized that many of the people in the current Detroit location
already knew she was there.''
   The newspaper's case was stated more bluntly by columnist Pete
Waldmeir, under whose byline both the Sunday and Monday reports were
published.
   ``I figure that if I can find out where she is by making two or
three phone calls, somebody with a million-dollar incentive sure ...
can,'' Waldmeir wrote in reference to the bounty reportedly offered
by Escobar.
   Sanchez ordered Escobar and 15 others arrested and charged with
murder in the Dec. 17, 1987 slaying of Guillermo Cano, owner of the
Bogota daily newspaper El Espectador.

<HEAD>Court Order Wheelchair Lifts On New Buses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE LLOYD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. appeals court ruling requiring
wheelchair lifts on new public buses nationwide is the most
important victory yet for disabled Americans seeking access to mass
transit, plaintiffs' lawyers say.
   In its 2-1 ruling Monday, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
also upheld a lower court order that the federal Department of
Transportation eliminate a 3 percent cap on the amount of money
transit authorities must spend to improve transportation for the
disabled.
   ``The impact of the majority's decision will be very substantial
throughout the country and will interfere with the local
decision-making authority,'' Judge Morton I. Greenberg wrote in his
dissent. ``I feel the court is overreaching.''
   The majority opinion by Judge Carol Los Mansmann said a
Transportation Department regulation requiring all new buses to
accommodate wheelchairs conflicts with a regulation allowing
communities to offer only an alternative service to the disabled.
   The court noted that a 24-hour reservation needed for the
alternative service hinders spontaneous use of mass transit, and
ordered transit authorities to make ``reasonable accommodations to
their programs, i.e. purchase wheelchair-accessible buses.''
   The cost of improving transit services for the disabled would
depend on each system, Timothy Cook, who represented the plaintiffs,
has said. It costs $15,000 to equip a bus with a wheelchair lift and
buses cost about $200,000, according to Joaquin Bowman, a spokesman
for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority.
   Greenberg said the section concerning wheelchair lifts for new
buses was not meant to apply to transit systems choosing alternative
transportation for the disabled. He also said the 3 percent cap
imposed in 1986 by the Reagan administration was not arbitrary.
   A coalition called Americans Disabled for Accessible Public
Transportation, which has chapters in 25 cities and whose members
have been arrested at demonstrations around the country, filed the
class-action lawsuit against the Transportation Department last year.
   Cook, who argued ADAPT's case, called Monday's ruling ``a major,
major victory for the handicapped community. ... We can't say enough
positive things about it.''
   ``We won on all points,'' added Stephen Gold, another ADAPT
attorney.
   Cook, now director of the Washington-based National Disability
Action Center, said he hoped the ruling would not be appealed in
light of President Bush's comments about wanting to bring the
disabled into the mainstream.
   Transportation Department officials in Washington could not be
reached for comment after office hours Monday.
   ADAPT contended that a provision of the federal regulations
allowed authorities receiving federal transportation funds to
exclude the disabled from ``effective and meaningful'' access.
   The provision allowed transit authorities to decide among three
types of transportation for the handicapped: accessible buses;
alternative methods such as special vans; or a combination of the
two.
   The lower court judge, U.S. District Judge Marvin Katz, upheld
the provision, but the appeals court said the regulation requiring
modified buses also applies to transit authorities that have chosen
alternative transportation as their sole system for the disabled.
   The court agreed with Katz in striking down the spending cap of 3
percent of transit systems' average annual operating costs on
transportation for the disabled.
   Katz called the limit ``arbitrary and capricious,'' and said it
allowed transit agencies ``to eviscerate the civil right'' to
transit service that Congress mandated for the disabled.
   The appellate decision also cited Congress' intent in ruling for
the regulation requiring modified buses.
   ``Congress wanted to provide the disabled with the capability to
utilize mass transit to the `maximum extent feasible.' The DOT has
failed to show that requiring the future purchase of accessible
buses oversteps this legislative intent,'' Mansmann wrote.
   A year ago, ADAPT identified Seattle; Atlanta; Phoenix; San
Francisco; Los Angeles; Denver; Oakland, Calif.; Johnstown; Kansas
City, Mo.; and Champaign-Urbana, Ill., has having the most
accessible transportation systems for the handicapped.
   It identified the worst as Philadelphia; Chicago; Baltimore;
Cleveland; Cincinnati; St. Louis; Houston; San Antonio; El Paso,
Texas; Detroit; and New Orleans.

<HEAD>Shops Close In Sinhalese Heartland After Death Threats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many shops in Colombo and southern Sri
Lanka did not open today after Sinhalese extremists issued death
threats and called a two-day strike in an effort to disrupt
Wednesday's parliamentary election.
   ``I didn't want to take a risk,'' said a Colombo grocer who kept
his shop shuttered after leaflets appeared in the capital on Monday
threatening death to anyone who ignored the strike.
   In Anuradhapura, 100 miles northeast of Colombo, police shot and
killed at least four Sinhalese extremists and arrested 11 others who
tried to set fire to buses, military officials said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   They identified the dead men as members of the People's
Liberation Front, the ultra-nationalist Sinhalese group whose name
appeared on the death-threat leaflets.
   In Colombo, the few big department stores remained open, but
small shops _ whose owners faced the greatest personal losses and
threats _ generally heeded the strike call.
   Residents of the Sinhalese heartland east and south of the
capital said business was at a standstill in their towns. All those
who spoke asked not to be identified out of fear for their safety.
   Contacted by telephone, they said shops were closed in a string
of coastal towns and villages stretching from Colombo to Moratuwa
down to Galle on the southwest tip of the island and east to
Tangalle.
   Many privately owned buses stopped running, while
government-operated ones stayed on the roads.
   The government has blamed the People's Liberation Front for the
slayings of more than 800 people since the election campaign started
Jan. 6.
   Another 200 people also died in election-related violence blamed
on minority Tamil separatists and unknown elements.
   The victims have included 14 of the 1,396 people running for the
225 parliament seats.
   The front says their fellow Sinhalese who dominate the government
and military have made too many concessions to the Tamil minority.
   Tamil guerrillas, whose separatist campaign has claimed 8,500
lives since 1983, say there haven't been enough concessions.
   The Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of the
Indian Ocean island country's 16 million people.
   Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, account for 75 percent.
There also are small communities of Moslems, who claim descent from
Arab traders, and Christians whose ancestors included Dutch and
Portuguese colonists.

<HEAD>Attorney General Welcomes Child Support Suit Filed Against Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Attorney General Jim Mattox said he
welcomed a lawsuit accusing his office of being lax in enforcing
child support laws, a problem he blames on the Legislature.
   ``The lawsuit raises many of the same issues that we have raised
over the past several years,'' Mattox said Monday after the
class-action suit was filed in Dallas by the Association for
Children for Enforcement of Support.
   ``We have more than 370,000 cases in the system and the
Legislature has given us the money to handle less than half of
them,'' he said in a statement. ``When they give us the money, we'll
do the job.''
   But members of the child advocacy group said Maddox is the one
who should be doing the job already.
   ``After many attempts to get Jim Mattox to follow the law, our
members are still not receiving the service they are entitled to
receive,'' said Lynda Milot Benson, president of the group's Texas
chapter.
   Benson said Mattox is responsible for locating parents,
establishing paternity for children born out of wedlock and
collecting child support.
   ``He doesn't do any of that,'' Benson said. ``The laws are in
place to get help and it's past time that these laws be followed.''
   Steve Levine, a spokesman for Mattox, said the attorney general's
office has asked for $63.4 million in fiscal year 1990 and $62.3
million the next year for the program. That would be an increase
from the current $39.8 million.

   The approximately 6,000 condoms have been hand-pasted into

   Eckrem said the editorial board decided last November to run an

   The condoms were donated by the San Antonio AIDS Foundation.

   Postal workers were running a little short
of their goal but still managed to put this town's special
Valentine's Day cancellation on nearly a quarter of a million
letters.
   ``We even had 10 from the Kremlin,'' said Mabel Thompson, who has
been running the volunteer program with her husband, Ted, since 1947.
   Postmaster Lane Edstrom said workers had put the Loveland mark on
245,000 letters from more than 100 countries by Monday night.
   He speculated that the ailing Colorado economy and the rise in
first-class postage to 25 cents last year has kept volume below the
office's goal of 300,000 love letters. Last year, people sent
275,000 pieces of mail to Loveland for its special Valentine's Day
posting, Edstrom said.
   But Mrs. Thompson thinks the recent wave of winter weather may
have chilled the hearts of lovers.
   ``The storm in the East probably hurt quite a bit, because we
didn't come up with as many from there as we usually do,'' she said.
   The U.S. Postal Service also put out a list of post offices for
Valentine's Day postmarks that included Loving, Texas; Hart, Mich.;
and Valentine in Arizona, Nebraska and Virginia.
   This year's Loveland Valentines were stamped with this poem,
written by the Thompsons:
   ``Dan Cupid's found a rainbow
   He's gathered stardust too
   And now this little Valentine
   Brings loving thoughts of you.''

   Joseph Schmidt Confections, a 5-year-old love affair of Schmidt

   Some of Schmidt's chocolate flowers and shell-like bowls,

   ``My goal is to create a dream for clients, to fulfill their

   Like Wonka, everything Schmidt makes is satisfying and delicious.
Talk about your childhood wishes, you can even eat the dishes.
   Schmidt, who said he's ``49 going on 30,'' once made a chocolate

<HEAD>`Baby Bell' Co. Allowed To Buy Into Foreign Cable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pacific Telesis is eager to invest in
Japan's $1 billion long-distance market now that it's become the
first ``Baby Bell'' to be allowed to tap into a major foreign
telecommunications venture.
   ``We've been working for more than two years to gain this
foothold,'' said Lee Cox, president and chief executive of PacTel
Corp., which heads San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group's
unregulated operations.
   Cox made his comment Monday after a federal judge in Washington,
D.C., cleared PacTel to take a stake of up to 10 percent of a
Japanese-led consortium that will own and operate a fiber-optic
cable between the United States and Japan.
   At the same time, U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene refused a
request by Nynex Corp., another Baby Bell, to take a 50 percent
stake in a trans-Atlantic fiber-optic cable with Great Britain's
Cable and Wireless Co.
   The approval of PacTel's request marks the first time since
Greene's 1984 order to break up the American Telephone and Telegraph
Co. that one of the seven regional phone companies has been
permitted to invest in a major foreign telecommunications operation.
   American companies, supported by arguments by U.S. trade policy
representatives, have aggressively sought entrance into Japan's
telecommunications industry for the past decade.
   The Japanese overseas telephone market makes $1 billion worth of
calls a year and is growing annually by 20 percent.
   PacTel needed judicial approval because of concerns over
antitrust violations. The AT&amp;T breakup barred the regional companies
from entering the long-distance telephone business.
   The trans-Pacific cable would run from Honshu in Japan, to
Alaska, and then to Pacific City, Ore., and is scheduled for
completion by the end of next year.
   Greene, who said he based his ruling on the commercial and trade
policy implications of the case, dismissed objections raised by AT&amp;T
and MCI Telecommiunications Corp., which argued that PacTel's
venture would constitute an antitrust abuse of its monopoly status
as a local telephone utility.
   Writing that the investment ``serves positive American
purposes,'' Greene added that without PacTel's investment, the
United States ``could also lose a long-term opportunity to influence
policies that could open more Japanese markets.''
   Greene's order said he was permitting the Pacific Telesis
investment because the company would only take part in the Japanese
end of the project and could not exercise monopoly power over the
lines in this country.
   He said Nynex had failed to show ``that there is no substantial
possibility that it could use its monopoly power to impede
competition in the market it seeks to enter.''
   Unlike PacTel, Nynex would have been responsible for marketing
the services of its venture in the United States.
   Greene said PacTel's lack of marketing involvement made it
``difficult for PacTel to discriminate in favor of its trans-Pacific
customers inasmuch as it could not communicate the necessary
information directly to such customers.''
   The consortium is to be named International Digital Co. Inc. and
PacTel will have one seat on its board of directors, to be based in
Japan.
   Cox said PacTel's option to be part of the venture would have
expired Feb. 23.

Friday. The trade gap stood at $11 billion in November.
   ``The market is unsure whether the deficit will contract or
expand,'' said a dealer at a major European bank in Frankfurt.
   Traders in Frankfurt and Milan, Italy, said a hike in the U.S.
prime rate Friday to 11 percent continues to fuel expectations of
further rises in U.S. interest rates.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 1.10 yen to close at 127.20. It was unchanged in
later London trading.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday:
   _1.8617 West German marks, down from 1.8705
   _1.5815 Swiss francs, down from 1.5895
   _6.3325 French francs, down from 6.3650
   _2.1140 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1120
   _1,357.25 Italian lire, down from 1,362.50
   _1.1845 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1868
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7592, more expensive for
buyers than $1.7495 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $385.75 a troy ounce, up
from $384.25 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $385.65.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $385.60, up from $383.75 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.02 to close at a bid $387.66.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.83 a troy ounce,
up from Monday's $5.79.

   Wanna be another Springsteen? Maybe Madonna
II?
   Twenty-five people this summer will get the chance to learn how
from those who have already made it in the music biz during the
first Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy Camp.
   ``It'll be a total immersion into the world of a rock 'n' roll
star,'' said the program's creator, Gilbert Klein, who modeled the
idea after baseball camps in which fans get to play alongside major
leaguers.
   After getting coached by real-life rockers, ``campers'' will live
the dream of everyone who ever played in a garage band: performing
at San Francisco's legendary Fillmore auditorium.
   Guitarist Craig Chaquico of The Starship will be among the
professional musicians instructing the aspirants, who must only be
``competent'' performers, Klein said Monday.
   While claiming he could not yet release the names of other pro
participants, ``everyone we've spoken to has been enthusiastic about
it,'' he added.
   Klein said the camp, to be held Aug. 20-27, is partly for
musicians who want to break into the business, ``but it's mainly
aimed toward people who are doing it for fun and have another
profession they do.''
   Klein fits the latter description himself. The owner of a
combination nightclub-bowling alley in the city's Haight-Ashbury
neighhborhood, he is a rock 'n' roller from way back. He played in a
band on New York's Long Island 20 years ago and several years ago
formed a group, Buzzin the System, with some of his employees.
   ``Once you've played, you never forget your instrument and you
never get rock 'n' roll out of your system,'' he said.
   Would-be campers must be 21, sing or play an instrument and
submit an audition tape with five songs. Participants must at least
be able to bang out the chords of such simple rock songs as ``Proud
Mary,'' said Klein.
   ``You have to have some competence. But the best players won't
necessarily get into camp,'' said Klein, who said he would look for
a good variety of performers.
   The chosen amateurs will be divided into five bands, according to
musical tastes, and will spend three days rehearsing, two days
recording and putting the tracks together and a day doing sound and
light checks at the Fillmore _ one of those less-than-glamorous but
necessary routines of the music business.
   After the Fillmore concert Aug. 26, participants will take home
audio tapes of their camp band and a video of the band in concert.
   Klein, who plans to expand the camps nationally and
internationally, figures there are a lot of wannabes happy to pay
the $3,500 fee, which includes lodging.
   Citing figures from the National Association of Music Merchants,
Klein pointed out that since 1960 more than 20 million guitars have
been sold.
   ``I'm sure that 50 million band instruments were sold, which is a
lot of players,'' he said.
   Klein plans to expand the rock 'n' roll camps to New York and
Chicago by 1990 and to Los Angeles, Houston and Atlanta by 1991,
followed by London and Tokyo by 1993.
   The ``camp'' will be held at various studios in the San Francisco
Bay area. Participants will receive a black satin ``tour'' jacket
and ``concert'' poster featuring their band.

<TEXT>
   Hollywood artist Herbert D. Ryman, whose
sketches of Disneyland helped sell the concept of the fantasy theme
park to bankers and whose work for Disney spanned five decades, died
of cancer. He was 68.
   Ryman, who died at his home Friday, helped design many major
motion pictures for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 20th Century Fox and the
Walt Disney Co. during Hollywood's golden age.
   The Vernon, Ill., native graduated magna cum laude in 1932 from
the Chicago Art Institute. In his first job as story illustrator for
MGM, he contributed to the screen styling of ``David Copperfield,''
``A Tale of Two Cities,'' ``Anna Karenina,'' and ``Mutiny on the
Bounty.''
   Ryman first went to work for Disney in 1938 when such full-length
animated films as ``Pinocchio,'' ``Dumbo,'' ``Fantasia'' and others
were in the planning stages.
   He went to work at other major Hollywood studios before Walt
Disney summoned him in September 1953 for help with Disneyland.
   Asked to make sketches of major attractions to show potential
backers, Ryman in two days sketched an aerial view that showed
Sleeping Beauty's castle, Main Street and a railroad to take guests
to various attractions.
   Ryman later helped with drawings for Walt Disney World, Epcot
Center and Tokyo Disneyland, and was contributing concept drawings
for Main Street in the planned Euro Disneyland when he became ill.
   In addition to his work for Disney and film, Ryman painted
watercolors of California scenery and portraits, many of which hang
in prominent Hollywood homes.
   He is survived by a sister, Mrs. John Carroll of Los Angeles.
   A memorial is scheduled for next Monday at First United Methodist
Church of Burbank.

<HEAD>70 Drug Smugglers Hanged In Iran</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventy drug smugglers were hanged in Tehran
and 25 other Iranian cities today, an official report said, the
largest number of traffickers executed in a single day of a
ferocious anti-narcotics crackdown.
   Sixty-seven men were hanged in public at dawn in a blinding
snowstorm and three women were executed inside Iranian prisons, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   Seven of the men were hanged in Tehran's Shusha and Korasan
squares in a public spectacle that underlined the government's
determination to eliminate drug smuggling and abuse, which officials
say has become a major problem.
   But few people turned out to witness the executions because the
storm paralyzed traffic in the city. More than three inches of snow
fell during the night.
   The men's bodies were cut down from the makeshift gallows after a
short time, instead of being left hanging for a day as has been the
case with earlier executions.
   Nearly 200 men and women, identified by the official media as
convicted drug smugglers, have been executed since early January.
   Fifty-six were executed Jan. 16, a few days before a new law went
into effect that set a mandatory death penalty for people convicted
of possessing even small amounts of narcotics.
   An anti-narcotics task force made up of Revolutionary Guards and
the Revolutionary Committees, who have largely taken over law
enforcement, have rounded up more than 2,000 drug suspects in recent
weeks.
   Scores of heavily armed smugglers have been killed in gun battles
with security forces in the eastern provinces bordering Afghanistan
and Pakistan, the main smuggling routes, the official media has
reported.
   Large quantities of narcotics, including heroin, opium and
hashish, have been reported seized by security forces backed by
helicopter gunships.
   Today's hangings were the first since the execution of drug
smugglers was suspended during Feb. 1-11 celebrations to mark the
10th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
   Prosecutor-General Musavi Khoeiniha declared in a recent
interview on Tehran Radio: ``This is the end of the line. If we do
not destroy them, they will destroy our youths.''
   Police statistics released Monday said 3,300 drug traffickers
have been arrested since 1987 and that police had seized 11 tons of
opium, 1,540 pounds of heroin and 2.3 tons of hashish during the
period.
   IRNA says Iran has 1 million drug addicts, but unofficial
estimates put the number at double that.
   The execution of drug smugglers has coincided with reports that
authorities have also executed hundreds of political prisoners. The
Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, the main Iranian
opposition group, claims 12,000 prisoners have been executed since
August in a systematic purge of dissidents.
   The United Nations and the London-based Amnesty International
human rights group have said at least 1,000 have been slain in that
period.
   Iranian leaders have admitted that scores of
``counterrevolutionaries'' have been executed, but denied human
rights violations.
   The Tehran Times daily said in an editorial today that it
supports allowing a U.N. committee investigate the observance of
human rights in Iran.
   The English-language newspaper said it would be better ``to
invite them and convince them that nothing unjust is being committed
and that all is according to law, although there may be a difference
on how we look at it from how they do.''

<HEAD>Whispering, Coughing and Sniffling Worst Annoyances at Symphony Concerts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Concertgoers, does it irritate you when someone
whispers during the Webern? Coughs during the Copland? Sniffles
through the Schumann?
   If so, you're not alone. In a recent survey commissioned by a
cough medicine company, symphony audiences rated whispering,
coughing and sniffling _ in that order _ as the most distracting
concert noises.
   What about the doctor down front whose beeper goes off during the
Brahms, or the concertgoer who rustles his program during the
Rachmaninoff? Are they as much of an annoyance as the boor who
applauds after the slow movement of the quartet, instead of waiting
for the end?
   According to audience members at the Atlanta Symphony, the St.
Louis Symphony and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, such people are a
bother, too, but not as bad as the folks who rattle candy wrappers,
move around constantly in their seats or try to get into the act by
singing or humming along.
   Some of the 2,500 symphony-goers who were surveyed also objected
to the tinkling of heavy jewelry, but it was the least annoying of
the 10 annoyances listed.
   When asked the best means of eliminating such noise pollution,
Los Angeles concertgoers suggested throwing offenders off the
balcony or cutting their ears off. Their St. Louis counterparts
leaned toward decapitation or banishment to Siberia, or better yet,
to a rock concert.
   Others suggested less drastic though embarrassing methods _ from
equipping each seat with a red bulb that would light up each time an
individual made excessive noise, to having ushers hand all offenders
a note stating that they are annoying everyone around them.
   The survey was commissioned by the Warner-Lambert Co.,
manufacturer of Halls Cough Suppressant Tablets.
   As part of a promotion called ``Silent Nights at the Symphony''
during the winter cough and cold season, the company has begun
distributing free samples of the tablets to all patrons of the
orchestras where the survey was taken, as well as to patrons of the
New York Philharmonic and the Chicago and Dallas symphony orchestras.

<HEAD>Man Who Was George Jetson's Voice Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George O'Hanlon, who became the voice of the
cartoon world's man of the future, George Jetson, after
unsuccessfully auditioning for the role of Fred Flintstone, died
after a stroke. He was 76.
   The actor and writer died Saturday at St. Joseph Medical Center
in suburban Burbank, Hanna-Barbera Productions Inc. announced Monday.
   O'Hanlon had just finished recording his role as George in
``Jetsons: The Movie,'' a full-length cartoon from Universal
Pictures and Hanna-Barbera scheduled for release this fall.
   ``George loved doing the Jetsons. He just sounded great in our
latest sessions,'' Hanna-Barbera President Joe Barbera said in a
statement. ``I know he would feel very proud of his work in the
movie.''
   The film is based on ``The Jetsons,'' the popular 1960s cartoon
situation comedy about a futuristic family.
   ``George Jetson was an average man. He has trouble with his boss,
he has problems with his kids, and so on,'' O'Hanlon once said.
``The only difference is that he lives in the next century.''
   O'Hanlon originally tried out for the Flintstone role, but Alan
Reed got the part. Barbera, looking later for the voice of the
Jetson patriarch, remembered O'Hanlon's audition.
   Although the ``The Jetsons'' only ran from 1962-1963, it
developed a loyal folllowing. In 1985, 41 new episodes were
commissioned for syndication and O'Hanlon became Jetson again.
   O'Hanlon's other credits include the roles of the TV commentator
in ``Rocky'' and William Bendix's next-door neighbor on ``The Life
of Riley.'' He also wrote for the Jackie Gleason Show for two years.
   He is survived by his wife, Nancy; his son, George Jr.; daughter,
Laurie, and one granddaughter.

<HEAD>Settlement Appears Near After Judge Clears The Way</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for the Long Island Lighting Co. and
its 1 million customers were close today to an agreement under which
ratepayers would drop a racketeering suit in exchange for smaller
rate increases over the next 10 years.
   However, it was uncertain whether the proposed settlement would
include the closing of the controversial Shoreham nuclear power
plant.
   ``We have not reached a settlement but we made excellent
progress,'' said Joseph McDonnell, a LILCO spokesman, late Monday
night after 10{ hours of talks.
   He said negotiators at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn were
``very close'' to an agreement and would meet again this afternoon.
   A federal judge last week dismissed a racketeering lawsuit filed
by Suffolk County against LILCO, but on Monday he granted the
ratepayers the right to sue the utility as a class. That cleared the
way for the ratepayers' attorney, Judith Vladeck, to accept a
settlement.
   The class certification was ``a useful step'' in the negotiation
process, Vladeck said during a break in the talks.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein noted that, should his
dismissal be overturned on appeal, LILCO would be liable to pay the
ratepayers at least $4 billion in damages and ``will be forced into
bankruptcy since its assets will not suffice to pay the judgment.''
   The settlement talks centered on a proposal to reduce planned
increases in electric rates by $400 million over the next decade.
   Weinstein had previously severed the ratepayers' case from the
trial of Suffolk's suit, which ended Dec. 5 with a jury finding that
LILCO lied to state officials to obtain rate increases and awarding
the county $22.8 million in damages.
   Weinstein on Saturday dismissed Suffolk's suit and the jury award
on the grounds that the racketeering statute did not apply to the
case.
   An agreement between LILCO and its customers would lessen the
leverage Suffolk County could wield in its negotiations with LILCO
over whether to appeal Weinstein's ruling.
   The county hoped to use the threat of a bankrupting damage award
to force LILCO to close its $5.4 billion Shoreham nuclear power
plant.
   Lawyers for Suffolk County arrived at the Brooklyn courthouse
late Monday, fueling speculation that an agreement to close the
plant was near.
   The Suffolk County Legislature was scheduled to discuss the
proposed settlement today.
   Any settlement to close the plant would require the approval of
Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   The governor had proposed last year to buy the troubled Shoreham
plant for $1 and dismantle it and allow LILCO a rate increase of 63
percent over 10 years in return. However, state legislators refused
to go along with Cuomo's deal, saying it was too expensive for
consumers and too generous to LILCO.
   Cuomo on Monday issued a statement saying he would require the
rate-saving proposal ``be adopted and that the Legislature would not
impede other portions of the agreement'' for the settlement to win
his approval.
   Construction on Shoreham, located 60 miles east of Manhattan,
began in 1973 and was completed a decade later, but state and county
authorities have refused to draw up emergency evacuation plans that
would help the plant win an operating license from the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.

<TEXT>
   America's largest and best-known legal brothel,
the Mustang Ranch, has been given the go-ahead to become the first
investor-owned bordello through a $23.3 million stock offering.
   ``My guess is in about 30 days, there will be no more Joe
Conforte Mustang Ranch,'' owner Conforte said Monday. ``The Joe
Conforte Mustang Ranch is going to be history.''
   The stock offering won final approval of the federal Securities
and Exchange Commission late Friday, five months after it was sought
by an investors group led by two attorneys and a Reno businessman.
   The mechanics of setting up the syndicate that will offer the
stock at $20 a share began Monday, according to Kevin Ward, lead
underwriter for American Wallstreet Securities, Inc., of Tampa, Fla.
   The primary investors, Reno attorney Peter Perry, Arizona
attorney Darrell Rippy and Reno businessman Donald Clough, have
proposed selling 1.165 million common shares of Mustang Ranch Inc.
   Under SEC regulations, none of the principals could discuss the
pending offering, but papers filed with the agency said the $5.3
million difference between the stock income and the sale price would
be used for capital improvements, financial reserves and
administrative costs.
   Conforte said he would receive $18 million for the 105-bedroom
brothel if the sale is successful, but he does not expect to become
rich from the transaction.
   ``Between my back taxes and the capital gains taxes, the U.S.
Treasury is going to end up with most of it or all of it,'' he said.
   ``I owe $12 million to $13 million in taxes and the capital gains
are going to be $4 million to $5 million. You figure it out. I'm
going to do my bit to reduce the deficit.''
   Conforte was released from prison in early 1985 after serving 18
months on tax evasion charges.
   Ward said escrow would not close on the sale until all shares had
been subscribed to. Once that happens, he said, plans call for the
stock to be traded publicly over the counter.
   The brothel showed a decline in gross revenues from $5.9 million
to $5.6 million in 1986, but profits rose from $848,000 to $917,000,
according to the prospectus.
   The prospectus noted that the stock offering is a high-risk
venture because of potential lawsuits, adverse publicity and the
possibility that clients could contract sexually-transmitted
disease, including AIDS.
   Nevada law requires prostitutes to be tested monthly for the
fatal disease and so far, no prostitutes in licensed brothels have
tested positive for the AIDS virus. The brothels require customers
to use condoms.
   Conforte and his wife, Sally, began operations at the 440-acre
ranch in the late 1950s when prostitution was tolerated in Nevada.
In 1971, Conforte won county approval for the brothel 10 miles east
of Reno, pioneering the statewide movement to allow prostitution in
most Nevada counties.
   Prostitution is illegal in the counties that contain Nevada's
three major cities, Reno, Las Vegas and Carson City.

   A strong earthquake measuring 6.6 on the
Richter scale shook the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific Ocean,
the National Earthquake Information Center reported today.
   Geophysicist Bill Schmieder said there were no reports on damage
or injuries in the hours following the quake at 11:20 p.m. MST
Monday.
   A statement released by the National Earthquake Center said the
quake occurred in the Solomons, about 1300 miles north of Brisbane,
Australia.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6
severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.

   At the opening of the Museum of Broadcasting's
20th Anniversary Salute to Monty Python, Eric Idle disclosed how the
irreverent comedy troupe came up with ideas.
   ``Drugs,'' he said, deadpan. ``We are at last able to reveal that
now.''
   Half of the original Monty Python sextet _ Idle, Terry Jones and
Terry Gilliam _ fielded questions from the more than 130 fans
attending the seminar Monday, the start of the museum's 10-day
retrospective marking the comedians' first appearance on British
television two decades ago.
   ``Is there anything that you people wouldn't do?'' inquired
Pythonmaniac Harold Sprinzen of the troupe who created the Ministry
of Silly Walks and the fish-slapping dance.
   ``We would never, ever mock the Museum of Broadcasting,'' intoned
Jones.
   ``But we're a bit young to be exhibits in a museum,'' said
Gilliam, who is 48. Jones is 47 and Idle is 45.
   ``Actually, having a retrospective at the Museum of Broadcasting
is a bit like being dead,'' Jones said. ``We keep waiting for the
American public to realize that this _ well, it's all a mistake.''
   What's the difference between American humor and English humor?
   ``American humor pays more,'' Idle said.
   ``Monty Python's Flying Circus'' made its premiere on the BBC on
Oct. 5, 1969, in a slot previously filled by a Sunday religious
discussion. The last original show was broadcast in December 1974.
   The retrospective will include a marathon screening of all 45
original episodes _ including some not in the syndication package
that has been rebroadcast on American television.
   Since the group's last film, ``Monty Python's Meaning of Life,''
the members have gone in separate directions. Will the Pythons _ who
also include John Cleese, Graham Chapman and Michael Palin _ ever
reunite?
   ``We recently had a meeting in London to discuss it,'' Jones
said. ``Everyone could be there except Eric.''
   ``Even John Lennon was there,'' Gilliam said.

   Fast-stepping Secretary of State James
Baker III today turned his attention to bumpy relations with Greece
and Turkey on his tour of all 15 NATO allies.
   In meetings in both nations, traditional enemies whose relations
with the United State also have been strained, Baker was seeking
support for the Bush administration as it forms a strategy for
negotiations with the Soviet Union.
   Greece and Turkey are the seventh and eighth countries on his
itinerary, now in its fifth day. Baker is due to return late Friday.
   The most critical talks wound up Monday night in Bonn with a
commitment from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to the principle of keeping
NATO nuclear forces up to date.
   But the West German leader, facing national elections next year
in a country where disarmament sympathies are strong, would not
withdraw his proposal for a delay of two or three years in extending
the range of U.S-built Lance missiles, which now can fire 70 miles.
   Kohl has revived a West German campaign to have NATO assign high
priority to negotiating reductions in shorter-range rockets with the
Warsaw Pact.
   Former Secretary of State George Shultz persuaded NATO foreign
ministers two years ago to give the issue low priority in light of a
U.S.-Soviet agreement to scrap intermediate-range missiles.
   ``Let's see what happens at the next NATO summit,'' Baker said in
acknowledging that he had not settled the issue in talks with Kohl
and West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   While in Europe, Baker is making preliminary arrangements for a
NATO summit meeting in Brussels in May.
   In Turkey, which has the alliance's second-largest standing army,
after the United States, modernization ranks high on the agenda.
Turkey wants a billion dollars from the United States to refurbish
troops and jet fighters.
   Accusations of human rights violations, made in a State
Department report last week, also are an irritant in relations with
Ankara.
   Baker scheduled a 2{ hour visit with Premier Turgut Ozal and
Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz before flying to Athens. There he is
to meet President Andreas Papandreou and Foreign Minister Karolos
Papoulias.
   A 1983 agreement to maintain military bases in Greece expired in
December and Papandreou has vowed to force a U.S. withdrawal.
   Negotiations continue, and a compromise may be worked out to
limit the pullout to single installation in Athens area. The United
States now operates four large and 20 small bases in Greece.
   Greek officials' decision in December to free a suspected
Palestinian terrorist, Osama Abdel Zomar, put a crimp in relations
with the United States.
   Zomar, who is alleged to belong to the Abu Nidal terrorist group,
is wanted for questioning about a 1982 grenade attack on Rome's main
synagogue. Greece expelled him to Libya.
   Greece has not disclosed whether it will allow another suspected
terrorist, Mahammed Rashid, to be extradited to the United States
for prosecution in the bombing of a 1982 Pan Am jetliner. A
passenger died in that attack.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl met with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and suggested the compromise
move of producing new short-range NATO nuclear missiles but putting
off their deployment.
   The chancellor also said publicly for the first time Monday that
West Germany wants a disarmament mandate built into NATO strategy
that would scuttle deployment plans if progress is made on reducing
the Soviet advantage in conventional weapons.
   Kohl faces stiff public opposition to deploying upgraded
battlefield nuclear missiles on West German soil.
   During his meeting with Kohl on Monday, Baker appeared to soften
U.S. demands that NATO endorse a deployment plan this spring.
   The new U.S. secretary of state, on an eight-day tour of NATO
countries, said the two agreed during a ``very, very friendly'' talk
to negotiate differences over the NATO plan to develop, produce and
deploy new missiles to replace the aging U.S.-made Lance missiles.
   Kohl told reporters individual countries' decisions to make the
short-range missiles could be approved and contained in a NATO
strategy statement expected this spring, while the West German
decision on whether to accept the new rockets could be made later.
   His proposal would serve as a compromise between the U.S.
position calling for endorsement of the modernization project at the
NATO summit expected in May or June and the Bonn government's
reluctance to endorse a plan so widely opposed by its citizens.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Wilfried Dunkel picked up the same
theme during a news conference Monday, noting that what Washington
decides on production of the new missiles is its own business.
   ``The national decision does not mean an anticipation of the
alliance decision,'' Dunkel contended.
   Baker said he was assured West Germany has not changed its
commitment to the project.
   ``This was not a decision-taking meeting,'' Baker said. ``That is
not what we are here for. It did, I hope, clear up some of the
confusion.''
   He said his meeting with Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher also covered what steps Bonn has taken to tighten export
controls following U.S. complaints that West German firms helped
Libya build a poison gas plant.
   Baker said Kohl told him ``in no uncertain terms'' he plans to
work out through further negotiations the Bonn government's
differences with Washington over upgrading the Lance missiles.
   The Lance system includes 88 launchers and about 700 missiles
with a range of 75 miles. It is scheduled for replacement after 1995
with rockets capable of reaching targets 320 miles away. Seventy-six
launchers are in West Germany, the remainder in Italy.
   Before meeting Baker, Kohl restated to reporters his desire that
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization delay approving the missile
replacement project until 1991 or 1992.
   By then, he said, a Soviet reduction of conventional arms could
take place that would allow negotiations on the short-range missiles
for eventual removal of all nuclear weapons from Europe.
   ``Before we lock ourselves in on this issue at the NATO
conference, we and the Americans need to clear up our positions,''
Kohl said.
   West Germany is to hold national elections late next year and
Kohl clearly does not want to jeopardize the governing Christian
Democrats' chances of remaining in power by taking an unpopular
stance on the missile issue.
   In a statement issued after his talks with Baker, Kohl said he
reaffirmed Bonn's willingness to define general defense policies at
the next NATO summit, but he did not make clear whether that would
include support for modernization.
   Baker's 15-nation tour of alliance countries produced some signs
of reluctance among other member states. The Danish foreign minister
told reporters in Copenhagen that he expressed support for the West
German position during his talks with Baker.
   Baker was to visit Turkey, Greece and Italy today.

<HEAD>Water Emergency Declared in Philly Suburbs, Hotel Fire May Have Strained
Pump</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIXVILLE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials declared a water emergency
early today and urged residents not to turn on their taps after two
water pumps broke and left the borough's 10 million-gallon reservoir
perilously low.
   The emergency affected some 20,000 people in Phoenixville and in
Upper Providence, East Pikeland and Schuylkill townships, all
Philadelphia suburbs, said Borough Manager Bill Herman, who declared
the emergency at 3:15 a.m. after the water level dropped to just a
foot above intake channels.
   A hotel fire early Friday that killed two people and injured 13
others may have led to the emergency, Herman said. One water pump
had burned out a week ago, before the fire, and the second one
burned out Monday morning, probably because of the strain of
fighting the hotel fire.
   More than 200 firefighters from 26 fire companies battled
Friday's blaze at the Wall Block Inn, using up an estimated 5
million to 6 million gallons of water. Officials said at the time
that the water flow was so slow, partly because of freezing weather,
that a nearby canal had to be tapped to battle the blaze.
   Herman said another fire could deplete the reservoir in 15 to 30
minutes and urged people who can still draw water from their taps to
avoid doing so.
   ``If the system is bone dry and we have a fire, obviously there's
some real problems,'' he said.
   A replacement pump was being flown in from Memphis, Tenn., and
was expected to be on line by this afternoon.
   ``It's going to have to work like the devil to get the reservoir
to a point where we're going to feel comfortable,'' Herman said.
   Tanker trucks were set up at three sites today to provide water
to residents and Herman said others were being arranged.

   They rolled out the pink carpet at Lincoln
Center, where the celebrities wore pink roses and sipped pink
champagne and pink Perrier. But the guest of honor didn't so much as
blush.
   That's not surprising _ she was Barbie, the doyenne of fashion
dolls, who was honored Monday night for her successful 30-year
career as one of the most popular American toys.
   Mattel Inc. billed the black-tie affair as Barbie's ``Pink
Jubilee'' anniversary party. Company executives said the lavish
party, which helped kick off the annual toy industry fair, was a
fitting tribute to a toy that has shown such remarkable longevity _
and profitability.
   ``Whatever the cost is, I think it's worth it,'' said John W.
Amerman, Mattel's chairman and chief executive officer.
   Although her popularity has waned now and then, Barbie has never
fallen completely out of favor. She has been one of the most
consistent toys in an industry notorious for quickly fading fads.
Barbie was the nation's second biggest-selling toy last year, after
Nintendo video games, according to Toy &amp; Hobby World magazine.
   Each year, Barbie dolls pull in $450 million to $500 million in
revenue for Mattel.
   Part of the doll's success is credited to her adaptability. As
lifestyles and fashions changed over the years, Barbie's clothes and
accessories kept pace.
   Guests at Barbie's party were entertained by teen-age girls
performing the ``Barbie Rap'' and doing the ``Barbie'' dance. The
rap number was interspersed with spoken tributes from several female
celebrities, including singer Melba Moore and actresses Allison
Smith, of the television show ``Kate &amp; Allie,'' and Nancy Dussault,
who has performed in the Broadway play ``Into The Woods.''
   New York Mayor Edward Koch marked the occasion by sending fan
mail.
   ``She has always reflected the times, and today stimulates the
imagination and delight of another generation,'' Koch wrote.
``Barbie's appearance in a wide variety of ethnic guises makes her a
great toy for New York, a city which draws unique energy from its
unparalleled ethnic diversity.''
   An audiovisual retrospective of the doll's 30 years set to tunes
on the pop charts during the different periods cataloged Barbie's
numerous wardrobe changes.
   In the early 1960s, a conservatively dressed Barbie was depicted
as a wholesome 21-year-old with a fun-loving streak who turned up,
bikini-clad, at beach parties every so often.
   Later on, Barbie donned ``mod'' clothing and her normally
clean-cut boyfriend Ken grew his hair almost shoulder length.
   More recently, Barbie has become a briefcase-toting career woman.
   This year finds Barbie characterized as a superstar, decked out
in a star-encrusted tulle gown as the reigning queen of the fashion
doll world. If she lives up to her reputation, the other dolls will
be pink with envy.

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu today
urged fellow Anglicans to fast three days each week for the duration
of a hunger strike by about 300 black detainees who are demanding to
be set free.
   Some of the strikers have not eaten for 22 days, and 21
reportedly have been hospitalized. They have threatened to starve
themselves if the government does not either release or charge them.
   The Ministry of Law and Order said detainees are reviewed and
released every day, and that 17 were freed today. Two detainees who
had been on a hunger strike until Saturday were freed Monday but
their release had nothing to do with their fast, the ministry said.
   Tutu said he and other anti-apartheid church leaders will meet
Thursday with Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok to discuss the
strike, the strongest challenge yet to the white-led government's
policy of detention without trial.
   Vlok has agreed to meet starting today with lawyers for some of
the detainees and was considering a request to meet with parents of
hunger strikers.
   ``You know how a mother feels ... it really hurts,'' said
Neocwaka Lamani, one of six parents who flew to Cape Town today in
hopes of seeing Vlok.
   She said her 27-year-old son, Tango, joined the strike last week
at a Port Elizabeth prison, where he has been held since June 1986.
   Tutu, who spoke by telephone with Vlok on Monday, described him
as ``very concerned ... The very fact that he is ready to meet a
delegation of lawyers and church leaders is an indication that he is
prepared to listen to different points of view.''
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, called on Anglicans
to fast each Monday, Wednesday and Friday in support of the hunger
strikers.
   He said a prayer service will be held Thursday at St. George's
Cathedral in Cape Town prior to his meeting with Vlok, and that
another service was planned for Friday.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, along with Tutu one of the country's most
influential anti-apartheid clergymen, announced Monday that he is
fasting in solidarity with the hunger strikers.
   ``None of us wish to die,'' Boesak said in a letter to Vlok.
``But if this is the road we must take to make you and your
government understand the evil of your ways, we will take it.''
   Boesak, 43, is a mixed-race clergyman and president of the World
Alliance of Reformed Churches. Tutu said of Boesak's decision:
``That is how he believes God is calling him.''
   The strikers include about 170 detainees at Diepkloof Prison
outside Johannesburg, 105 at St. Albans prison in Port Elizabeth and
11 at a Port Elizabeth police station. Many have been held without
charge since a state of emergency was declared in June 1986.
   Vlok said the meetings with lawyers are part of a continuing
process of reviewing the cases of an estimated 1,000 detainees. He
said those deemed to pose no threat to state security would be
released.
   Police have warned newspapers that reports about the condition of
the detainees might violate a state-of-emergency regulation. Public
meetings intended to show support for the hunger strikers have been
banned.
   The Citizen, a pro-government Johannesburg newspaper, said in an
editorial today that one of South Africa's ``worst stigmas'' could
be removed if the government ``adopted a fresh approach to
detentions.''
   Business Day, another Johannesburg newspaper, asked: ``How many
more deaths will it take before the decent people of this country
rebel against the rule of wickedness?''
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   President Jose Napoleon Duarte
could provoke a military coup if he accepts a proposal by leftist
guerrillas to postpone next month's presidential election, the
defense minister said.
   ``If the president retains power beyond the end of his term, the
armed forces would be obliged to depose him _ either the armed
forces or the legislative assembly,'' Defense Minister Gen. Carlos
Vides Casanova told reporters Monday.
   Duarte should not extend his term to accommodate the rebel
proposal for elections in September, Vides said at this seaside
resort, where five Central American presidents began a two-day
summit Monday.
   The insurgents issued the proposal on Jan. 24. Duarte said the
following day that he would not remain in power under any
circumstances beyond June 1, when his term ends.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front said it would
participate in the election if the balloting is delayed from March
19 to September and certain security conditions are met.
   The rebels, pitted in a 9-year-old war against the U.S.-backed
government, previously had rejected the five national elections held
this decade as anti-democratic and part of a U.S.-sponsored
counterinsurgency campaign.
   The government has described postponement of the election as
unconstitutional.
   Asked Monday if the elections could be postponed until September,
Vides said, ``They cannot.''
   Asked if acceptance of the plan could divide the armed forces, he
said: ``That danger exists. Then the entire democratic process that
has cost so much could be broken.''
   A broad spectrum of political parties and labor organizations has
said last week that there are constitutional means to postpone the
election _ and the United States has called the rebel proposal a
positive step.
   Duarte's own Christian Democratic Party has said elections could
be legally postponed and an interim president named by the
legislature if a political consensus to do so exists.
   But the rightist Arena party, which is favored to win the
election, and the armed forces continue to cite what they say are
constitutional injunctions against postponing elections.
   ``If the Constitution is violated, we would be serving up on a
silver platter an opportunity that could destroy the entire
democratic process we have worked for,'' said Vides.
   Rebel chiefs may visit San Salvador late this week to talk with
representatives of the country's political parties, who have
expressed a willingness to do so.
   The war has claimed the lives of 65,000 people.

   A medical helicopter crashed and burned after
striking a high-voltage line in rain and fog, killing the pilot and
two nurses, authorities said.
   The Flight for Life helicopter, leased by Mother Francis Hospital
of Tyler, was en route to Pittsburg Medical Center to pick up a
patient for transfer when it crashed Monday night, said Stacy Gill,
communications operator for the Texas Department of Public Safety.
   The wreckage was scattered over several acres in a wooded area
about three miles north of Tyler in East Texas, she said.
   The pilot was identified as as Gerald A. Morgan Sr., 46, of
Houston, said hospital spokeswoman Beverly Mason.
   The registered nurses were identified as Jeanne Lackey, 29, of
Lindale, and Kathy Ohnheiser, 31, of Haltom City, Ms. Gill said.
   The helicopter left the Tyler hospital at 10:14 p.m. and notified
authorities four minutes later that it was returning because of bad
weather, Ms. Gill said. There was rain and fog in the area.
   At 10:23 p.m., a Smith County resident telephoned authorities to
notify them of a fire and they discovered the crash.
   The crash site was being guarded by Smith County deputies pending
the arrival later today of investigators from the National
Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration.
   Ms. Mason said the helicopter, a twin-engine BK-117, came from
U.S. Jet Aviation of Washington, D.C.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today ordered Union
Carbide Corp. to pay the Indian government $470 million for the 1984
gas leak in Bhopal that killed more than 3,300 people _ the world's
worst industrial disaster.
   The payment is to be made by March 31 as ``full and final
settlement of all claims,'' said Gopal Subramanium, an attorney for
the Indian government in its suit against the Danbury, Conn.-based
corporation.
   India sought damages of $3 billion for the leak of methyl
isocyanate at the Bhopal pesticide plant, which is operated by Union
Carbide's Indian subsidiary. The civil suit, in which more than
500,000 people filed for compensation, bogged down in legal
maneuverings in a series of Indian courts.
   Subramanium said India agreed to drop all criminal charges
against Union Carbide officials as part of the settlement.
   Warren Anderson, former Union Carbide chairman, was charged with
culpable homicide in the disaster.
   A company spokesman, Earl Slack, told The Associated Press by
telephone from his New York home that Union Carbide has accepted the
$470 million judgment and March 31 deadline.
   ``This is a just and fair settlement,'' Subramanium told a
reporter outside the Supreme Court chambers.
   Slack said the court's order ``was based on its review of all
pleadings in India and the U.S., applicable law and facts, and the
enormity of human suffering that requires substantial and immediate
aid.''
   A source close to the case, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said an important element of today's settlement was that it called
for a speedy, ``lump sum'' payment and was designed to end further
judicial proceedings, including the charge against Anderson.
   In November 1987, both sides came close to accepting an
out-of-court settlement of $500 million. But that amount would have
been paid over a decade or more.
   Today's settlement came as a surprise when the court reconvened
after lunch, Press Trust of India reported.
   The news agency said Chief Justice R.S. Pathak suddenly
interrupted Union Carbide lawyer F.S. Nariman to say the court had
reviewed the case in detail and considered it ``pre-eminently fit
for an overall settlement in view of the acute suffering of the
victims.''
   Press Trust of India and United News of India said Pathak told
the court the case should be settled and set the $470 million
figure. PTI said both sides immediately agreed.
   Slack said the court directed the parties to submit a detailed
agreement by Wednesday.
   According to India, at least 3,329 people died after inhaling the
deadly gas that leaked out of the pesticide plant on Dec. 3, 1984,
and drifted over Bhopal. Many of the victims lived in shantytowns
around the plant.
   The government says people continue to die from exposure to the
gas at a rate of at least one a day.
   More than 20,000 people were injured by the gas, according to
government statistics.
   The Indian government maintained the disaster was caused by
negligence.
   Union Carbide contended the disaster was caused by sabotage. The
plant was operated by an Indian subsidiary.
   In May 1986, a U.S. court dismissed a suit on Bhopal.
   The Supreme Court had been hearing Union Carbide's appeal of an
order for interim compensation of $166 million ordered in April by
the high court in Madhya Pradesh state, where Bhopal is located.
   Some initial compensation was paid to gas victims by the Indian
government. A sum of 10,000 rupees, worth about $766 at the time,
was given to the next-of-kin of each person who died from the gas.
   On the anniversaries of the quake, gas victims demonstrated
against the company and the government in Bhopal and New Delhi,
saying they were tired of the legal wrangles and wanted financial
and medical aid to help them rebuild their lives.
   The gas leak raised fierce debate in India and abroad about the
responsibility of multinational countries doing business in the
developing world. Critics charged that the multinationals were more
interested in profit than safety, while Union Carbide officials
argued privately that they were hamstrung by local restrictions.

   Actor James Caan is expected to leave a
hospital this week after suffering broken ribs when he was thrown
from his Harley-Davidson motorcycle, in a crash reminiscent of actor
Gary Busey's nearly fatal accident.
   Both actors, who weren't wearing helmets, are among a growing
contingent of Hollywood stars caught up in the Harley-Davidson
craze, cr0,000-plus ``hogs.''
   Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jay Leno, Ray Sharkey,
Ken Wahl and Mickey Rourke also are frequently seen riding
motorcycles.
   Caan, 49, escaped Sunday's accident in Santa Monica wuising aboard
$2ith only
four broken ribs, cuts and scrapes. Busey, 44, suffered massive head
injuries in a Dec. 4 crash in Culver City and underwent 90 minutes
of brain surgery; he returned to his home in Malibu just last week.
   Caan was with three non-celebrity motorcycle buddies when a car
swerved in their path, said his publicist Paul Bloch. Caan hit his
brakes too hard and was tossed over the handlebars, he said.
   ``He's got some pain and will be out of the hospital this week,''
Bloch said of the star of ``The Godfather'' and most recently
``Alien Nation.''
   Bloch didn't know if Caan was rethinking his habit of riding
without a helmet. Busey's accident revived interest in a state
mandatory helmet law and legislation ics charged that the multinationals
were more
interested in profit than safety, while Union Carbide officials
argued privately that they were hamstrung by local restrictions.

<TEXT>
   New York state's Democrat-controlled Assembly
has rejected, after rancorous debate, a resolution honoring former
President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, for their eight years in the
White House.
   ``He made selfishness the national byword,'' said Democratic
Assemblyman Anthony Genovesi. ``He made it legitimate for people to
say `I don't give a damn, I'm not my brother's keeper.'''
   Genovesi's remarks, which drew hisses from Republicans, echoed
other Democrats who said Reagan's America left out the homeless, the
poor and organized labor.
   ``I'm glad he's no longer president,'' said Assemblyman Edward
Sullivan, also a Democrat. ``I can't commend him for his years in
office.''
   Monday's vote was 78 to 58. Only two Democrats voted for the
resolution.
   The resolution, sponsored by Assembly Minority Leader Clarence
Rappleyea, said ``mere words cannot express the debt owed nor may
brief phrases make manifest the leadership rendered.''
   Assembly Majority Leader James Tallon of Binghamton implored
Rappleyea to water down his resolution.
   Tallon said Democrats wish the Reagans a peaceful retirement,
``but in my opinion and in the opinion of many of my colleagues, a
number of the things that were carried out (in Reagan's
administration) were not great successes in the United States.''
   Republicans derided the Democrats for voting against the
resolution, noting that New York state voters twice supported Reagan
in general elections.
   ``Ronald Reagan was a leader who stuck to his guns, who made us
all feel better and made the country feel good about itself,'' said
Republican Assemblyman John Faso. ``I don't think anyone can
disagree that the health of this nation is much better than when he
took office.''
   ``If there was ever any doubt that the Democrats represent the
liberal fringe, the defeat of this resolution honoring the eight
years of the Reagan administration proves it,'' Rappleyea said.

<HEAD>Papers Publish Valentine's Greeting, Letter From Hostages' Family</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers today published St. Valentine's
Day greetings from the family of U.S. hostage Thomas Sutherland, and
a letter from American hostage Terry Anderson's sister urging him to
``stay strong.''
   The An-Nahar and As-Safir newspapers ran Arabic translations of
the letter Peggy Say sent from Syria in hopes Anderson's captors
read the Lebanese media on the eve of her birthday Wednesday.
   As-Safir also ran a paid advertisement in Arabic and English from
the American University of Beirut, containing the greetings to
Sutherland.
   ``We send you our hearts on this special day to tell you how much
we think of you, miss you and need you,'' said the message signed by
Sutherland's wife, Jean and his children Joan, Kate, Anne, Ray, Alex
and Simon.
   ``Keep faith and hope ever high for the day we are together,'' it
said.
   Sutherland, 57, was the university's acting dean of agriculture
when he was kidnapped June 9, 1985. Islamic Jihad, a Shiite Moslem
group loyal to Iran, claimed his abduction and Anderson's.
   Anderson, 41, is chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985, and is the
longest-held of the 15 Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Mrs. Say flew to Damascus last week for talks with Syrian
officials who have been cooperating in attempts to free all the
captives.
   In her letter, Mrs. Say paid tribute to President Hafez Assad of
Syria and Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual guide of
Lebanon's Shiite fundamentalists, for their ``intense and
complicated efforts'' to end the hostages' plight.
   ``Stay strong little brother _ this too will pass,'' she wrote.
``I have great hopes that President Bush will work for a new and
better relationship between our people and our brothers in the
Middle East.''
   Mrs. Say said she traveled to Damascus to ``celebrate my 48th
birthday by being close to you and praying for your strength and
freedom. I will go home much older, much sadder and much wiser.''
   She told him about a visit she made Friday to one of the oldest
churches in the world, the Greek Catholic Church of St. Sergius in
Maaloula, Syria, where villagers still speak the Aramaic language of
Christ.
   ``I placed a bracelet with your name on the altar at Maaloula and
prayed there for a healing of our personal wounds, and for the
healing of the wounds between our country and the countries of the
Middle East,'' Mrs. Say wrote.
   ``I also prayed for peace for the people of Lebanon and freedom
for those who live in bondage as you do,'' she added.
   Mrs. Say assured Anderson that his two daughters are well.
   ``Your beautiful children are fine and send their love as does
our family. Your many friends and thousands of people in America
work and pray every hour, every day for strength and freedom for you
and all the hostages,'' she said.

   Long lines formed at the courthouse and business
boomed at the city's 25 wedding chapels today as an expected 1,500
couples began tying Valentine's Day knots in this marriage mecca.
   Beverly Swinn, who has seen hundreds of thousands of couples line
up at the Marriage License Bureau, said workers were hoping they
might get a breather this year, with Valentine's Day falling near
the middle of the week.
   Last year, when Valentine's Day fell on Sunday, 1,365 couples
purchased licenses Feb. 13 and 14.
   The bureau issued 841 licenses this weekend, said Ms. Swinn. More
than 400 were issued Monday and at least that many were expected
today, she said.
   ``We thought it was going to ease off, but we're swamped today,''
she said Monday. ``Most of those people will be saving them for
Tuesday.''
   In 1988, the Marriage License Bureau issued a record 72,500
licenses, or about 200 a day. Last year's total was up nearly 5,000
from 1987.
   Lovebirds have flocked to Las Vegas to get married because no
blood tests are required and there is no waiting period.
   During peak periods such as Valentine's and New Year's days, the
city's wedding chapels will marry several couples an hour.
   There's piped music, artificial flowers, and ministers who make a
living off the wedding trade. Couples pay for the services with
cash, credit cards, and, in some cases, casino chips.
   One of those conducting services is Charlotte Richards, who
dropped by the the Clark County Courthouse to deliver heart-shaped
boxes of chocolates to workers at the bureau.
   Richards said she had scores of services scheduled today at her
four wedding chapels.
   ``I've been in this business 30 years,'' she said. ``They call me
the grandmother of the wedding business. ... I'm gonna die with a
bride and groom in my arms.''
   Also at the courthouse were Clifford Welch and Rhonda Horn of
Schofield, Wis., who have been planning a Las Vegas wedding for a
year.
   ``We're debating whether to get married tonight or tomorrow,''
said Welch, 35. ``She wants to get married on Valentine's Day and I
want to get married tonight.''
   One thing they did decide on was where to get hitched. Horn's
finger ran down a list of wedding chapels posted on a hallway wall
and stopped at one named Hitching Post Wedding Chapel.
   ``This is it!'' the 22-year-old woman said.
   Out on the Las Vegas Strip, one of the 250 marriages scheduled
for today at Gordon Gust's Candlelight Wedding Chapel was conducted
on NBC's ``Today Show.''
   ``These knees are never gonna be the same,'' said Rick
Vandermillen, 33, following the live pre-dawn ceremony at the tiny
chapel tucked among the towering hotel-casinos lining the strip.
   His new bride, the former Cindy Guenther, 32, said the couple
picked Las Vegas to tie the knot because it was inexpensive and
``this is the most popular place to get married on Valentine's Day.''
   ``This is an inexpensve way to do it flashy,'' the groom amended.
   The couple, from Central City, Iowa, were picked from among
several interviewed by show producers. The Rev. Joe Cunningham of
Trinity Temple, who confessed to being nervous, was instructed
during a commercial break to talk slower in performing the ceremony.
   Gust, who has owned four chapels for 16 years, said his most
memorable experience came in 1987 when a man approached him and
said, ```What do I have to do to get married?'''
   ``It was Clayton Moore, the Lone Ranger, my childhood hero,''
Gust said. ``Moore was 73 and his bride was 45. When I asked him
about playing the wedding march, he said, `No, I'd rather have the
William Tell Overture.'
   ``His bride-to-be told him, `Clayton, will you grow up?'''

<HEAD>Traffic Agents Brush Up On ABC's of Ticket Writing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a recent study showed that more than 13
percent of traffic tickets were dismissed because they were
illegible or incomplete, transportation officials saw the writing on
the wall:
   Penmanship classes for traffic agents.
   ``I'm not going to be satisfied until we have a perfect record _
10 out of 10 summonses that are processible and collectible,''
Transportation Commissioner Ross Sandler said in today's Daily News.
   Deputy Transportation Commissioner Samuel Schwartz said a recent
study of 1,000 tickets picked at random showed that 13.5 percent
were illegible or key information required on the ticket was
inaccurate or omitted. The city lost $5 million last year when such
tickets were dismissed.
   Traffic enforcement agents, who issued 7 million parking tickets
in 1988, have been attending remedial handwriting classes, and
officials may give the same training to police officers, sanitation
workers and employees in 14 other agencies, who together wrote
another 5 million tickets last year.
   In addition, Mayor Edward I. Koch has ordered the department to
come up with cash bonuses for those who write the fewest invalid
summonses and to find a way to punish those with a high error rate.
   Joseph Bilello, who teaches at the Transportation Department's
training academy, said he focuses on the use of ``pre-kindergarten
block lessons'' in the classroom.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Children Of Hitler's Personal Photographer To Get Art</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Army must return four watercolor
paintings by Adolf Hitler to the children of Hitler's personal
photographer, a man found guilty of war profiteering, a federal
judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Lynn N. Hughes also ordered the federal
government to return two archives containing hundreds of photographs
to the familyof photographer Heinrich Hoffman Sr., who died in 1957.
   Two of the watercolors most likely will be returned to Hoffman's
family in Germany, while the remaining pair will remain in Houston
as part of the collection of Billy F. Price, an art investor who has
been battling the government over their ownership for years.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Frank Conforti said the government has
contended the watercolors legally belong to the United States under
a U.S.-German treaty signed after World War II.
   But Hughes ruled Thursday that the government failed to prove it
had a legal claim on the watercolors or photographs.
   ``Equal justice under law protects people without exceptions for
those people whose father's politics were wrong,'' Hughes said.
   Hitler gave one of the watercolors to Hoffman in 1936 as a 50th
birthday present. Hoffman purchased the others in the 1930s and
early 1940s.
   U.S. forces discovered them in May 1945 in a German castle where
Hoffman had stored them during the war. They were mistakenly
identified as German government property and seized.
   After the war, Hoffman was found guilty at the Nuremberg war
crimes trials of war profiteering.
   Price traced the ownership of the watercolors in 1982. The
photographer's children, Henriette Hoffman Von Schirach and Heinrich
Hoffman Jr., agreed to convey a portion of their value to Price for
help in retrieving them.
   Price said all of Hitler's drawings and paintings should be
studied for clues to his personality and motivation.
   ``He was not a simple man. He was very complicated,'' Price said.
``I'm not going to let people just say Hitler was a monster and
sweep him under the rug. I'm going to pull him out, shake him off
and study this man.''
   Another hearing is scheduled March 14 to discuss damages and
property possession.

   The mayor of a small Mississippi Delta town
has agreed to resign from office and enter a drug treatment program
after pleading guilty to selling cocaine, court records show.
   Sylvester Kyles, mayor of the Bolivar County town of Shaw since
1985, entered the plea Monday in U.S. District Court at Oxford.
   Kyles, 37, indicted by a federal grand jury in September, entered
the plea to a charge of selling one gram of cocaine for $140 on
March 24. Three other people indicted with Kyles pleaded guilty
earlier.
   Buck Beckham, city clerk in the town of about 2,400 people, said
city officials would appoint a replacement to fill the mayor's term,
which expires in June.
   No sentencing date was set. Kyles faces a maximum of 20 years in
prison and a $1 million fine.

<HEAD>Housing Prices Highest in Northeast and West, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Median home prices were highest in New York and
lowest in Cleveland in 1988, according to the 13th annual home
buyers' survey by the Chicago Title and Trust Co.
   Overall, U.S. housing prices were highest in the Northeast and
the far West, and lower in the South and the Midwest, the survey
found.
   Chicago Title and Trust, the nation's leading insurer of property
titles, reported that the median home price in the Northeast last
year was $151,300, while in the West it was $141,400.
   By contrast, the median price in the South was just $88,400, and
the Midwest median price was $93,600.
   New York City was the most expensive individual market, with a
median home price of $192,600, according to the study released last
week.
   John Pfister, Chicago Title vice president and manager of market
research, said that in the more expensive housing markets in the
Northeast and the West Coast, home buyers are generally older and
have higher combined incomes than their counterparts in less
expensive housing markets.
   For all U.S. markets included in the survey, the median price
rose 23 percent last year, from $99,260 to $121,910.
   The study found median home prices were highest in New York,
$192,600; San Francisco, $179,700; Orange County, Calif., $168,100;
Boston $165,100; and Los Angeles $162,500.
   At the low end were: Cleveland, $76,800; Memphis, $77,900;
Orlando, Fla., $83,000 and Seattle-Tacoma, $85,600.

   The pilot of a plane carrying President Hussain
Muhammad Ershad of Bangladesh to his first official visit in Britain
reported suspected hydraulic problems today, but the craft landed
safely.
   Fire engines lined the runway as the Bangladesh Biman DC-10 jet
landed smoothly and taxied to the VIP area.
   The 59-year-old president, looking unconcerned, emerged smiling
in bright winter sunshine.
   Ershad said at a lunch at the Foreign Press Association in London
later today that as his plane, which delivered a month ago, took off
from Dubai, the pilot advised him that the hydraulic system had
developed a problem.
   ``He asked me if we should go back to Dubai or to London. I said
go on to London. God has been very kind, he landed us safely,'' said
Ershad.
   The former army general, who took power in a March 1982 coup,
leads one of the world's poorest countries, a onetime British colony.
   He is scheduled to have lunch with Queen Elizabeth II and hold
talks with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Foreign Secretary
Sir Geoffrey Howe during his four-day visit.
   Ershad was met at Heathrow Airport by a representative of the
queen, Viscount Long, and Foreign Office Minister Lord Glenarthur.

<HEAD>Author of Satanic Verses Says Islamic Fundamentalists Need Criticism</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Satanic Verses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salman Rushdie said today the furor caused by his
book ``The Satanic Verses'' shows Moslem fundamentalist leaders in a
bad light and makes him wish he had been more critical.
   ``Frankly, I wish I had written a more critical book,'' he told
CBS ``This Morning.'' ``I mean, a religion that claims, that is able
to behave like this; religious leaders, let's say, who are able to
behave like this, and then say that this is a religion which must be
above any kind of whisper or criticism, that doesn't add up.''
   He added: ``It seems to me that Islamic fundamentalists could do
with a little bit of criticism right now.''
   Rushdie regretted the violence caused by opposition to his book,
but denied that it was blasphemous, as some Moslems contend.
   ``It's not true that this book is a blasphemy against Islam.
   ``I doubt very much that (Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah) Khomeini or
anybody else in Iran has read the book or more than selected
extracts out of context.
   ``Obviously it's horrifying that people are willing to proceed in
this way against what is, after all, one novel in the face of the
entire history of Islam.''
   Asked how he reacts to a death threat from Khomeini, Rushdie said:
   ``I think I have to take them very seriously indeed.''
   He told ABC ``Nightline'' on Monday night:
   ``The blood is on the hands of people who inflame the feelings of
people who unfortunately have not and cannot read the book ...
   ``The idea that this is somehow an attack on the religion shows
an absolute failure to understand what fiction is,'' he said.
   Of the novel itself, Rushdie told CBS:
   ``The sad thing is, of course, the book isn't really about Islam.
It's about migration and metamorphosis and all sorts of things.
There's one section where there are two dream sequences in the book,
in which what I've tried to do is write about the birth of a
religion which obviously is like Islam, but is a fictional departure
from Islam, and in that I've done it from a secular point of view.
   ``If you can't believe in the literal truth of God transmitting
words to a prophet ... then it seems to be a legitimate fictional
exercise to say what's really happening, what goes on, what is the
nature of revelation? ... How does a religion come into the world,
what compromises does it face, is it tolerant or intolerant?''
   He spoke about one section where a creature appearing to be like
Mohammed, the prophet Moslems believe is a messenger of Allah, is
given the name for the devil.
   ``The novel is about showing how devils are not always
devilish,'' Rushdie told CBS. ``One of the novel's major emphases is
to reclaim negative images ...''
   ``My views don't have to be the same as the views of a fictional
character. Finally, the fictional character is actually losing his
mind, he's going insane, he's a paranoid schizophrenic.
   ``Now, when you've gone to that length to write fiction, it's
very odd to have it judged as if you were writing some kind of, as
they say, thinly veiled attack. It was never my intention.''

<HEAD>Ex-Mail Carrier Gets 1 Year, 1 Day For Undelivered Mail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL KACZOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former mail carrier whose home was
stacked with tons of undelivered junk mail was sentenced today to a
year and a day in federal prison of failing to deliver two
first-class letters.
   William Ryan, 59, of Milton, told the court that he felt he
couldn't deliver all the mail assigned to him on his rural route and
started leaving a few pieces in his car every day.
   ``Things just seemed to snowball,'' Ryan told U.S. District Judge
Roger Vinson.
   The first-class letters were discovered among nearly 500,000
pieces of mostly advertising brochures, catalogues, sweepstakes
offers, give-aways and other so-called junk mail found heaped in and
around his home last August.
   The mail was found heaped inside Ryan's Florida Panhandle home,
about 30 miles northeast of Pensacola, in a shed, his yard and a
wooded area nearby after postal authorities received a tip.
   The mail dated back three years, about the time that Ryan, a
15-year postal employee, had been working a rural route in Escambia
County out of the main post office in Pensacola.
   Postal inspectors said about 500 pieces of first-class mail were
among the mainly third-class items. Ryan was charged with failing to
deliver 10 first-class letters. Five of those contained tax notices
from the Escambia property appraiser; the other five were
voter-registration renewal cards from the county elections
supervisor.
   Ryan was allowed to plead guilty to two of the counts and, in
exchange, prosecutors dropped the other eight. For the two counts,
he could have received up to 10 years in prison and been fined up to
$500,000.
   The judge also placed Ryan on probation for three years once the
prison sentence is completed. And he ordered him to pay $2,991.94 in
restitution to the Postal Service for the cost of maintenance
personnel, use of a bulldozer, forklift and trucks and other
expenses of recovering, sorting and delivering, returning or
destroying the tons of mail he failed to deliver.
   Vinson also imposed a $100 special assessment, but disallowed
$10,974 in restitution for the salaries of postal supervisory
personnel assigned to the case.
   Assistant Public Defender Tom Keith argued for leniency, saying
Ryan never before had been in trouble with the law, cooperated with
investigators and didn't have the ability to pay a large amount in
restitution or fines because he was fired from his postal service
job after his arrest.
   ``I'm very sorry for what happened,'' the defendant told Vinson.
``It's been a bad year last year for me.''
   Postal authorities say they don't keep records on such things,
but one inspector said the nearly 500,000 pieces may have been the
largest-ever case of undelivered mail.

   Union Carbide Corp.'s $470 million
settlement with the Indian government over the 1984 Bhopal gas leak
met with approval today from financial analysts and Wall Street.
   ``Psychologically, it's terrific. Financially, it's reasonable,''
said Leslie Ravitz, a research director for Solomon Brothers Inc. in
New York. ``This relieves the pressure on Union Carbide and the
stigma.''
   Union Carbide's stock price soared $2.12{ to $31.25 a share in
late-morning New York Stock Exchange trading today on news of the
settlement.
   The Supreme Court of India, sitting in New Delhi, today ordered
the $470 million payment by March 31 to settle charges resulting
from the leak of deadly methyl isocyanate at the Bhopal pesticide
plant, which is operated by Union Carbide's Indian subsidiary.
   More than 3,300 people died as a result of the Dec. 2, 1984 leak
_ the world's worst industrial disaster.
   In a statement from the company's Danbury headquarters, Union
Carbide Chairman Robert D. Kennedy said, ``We are pleased that this
will now provide for the care and rehabilitation of the victims and
their families and a fair resolution of all issues.''
   ``The alternative,'' added company spokesman Earl J. Slack, ``is
litigation that probably would have extended into the next century
with the final outcome that would be completely irrelevant to the
interests of the affected people in Bhopal and a continuing drain on
Carbide.''
   Union Carbide said it would take a charge against 1988 earnings
but that it would not exceed 50 cents a share.
   Slack said Union Carbide stands by its contention that sabotage
by a disgruntled employee caused the gas leak. The Indian government
had claimed that the company's negligence led to the disaster.
   Union Carbide had offered to pay $350 million as early as 1986,
but even though that settlement was accepted by the U.S. courts it
was rejected in India.
   The Indian government, which sued the chemical giant for $3
billion, had been seeking about $600 million in a settlement.
   ``I think it's a decision that was pretty much anticipated,''
James Wilbur, a vice president with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and
Co. Inc. in New York, said of the settlement. ``You didn't need a
slide rule to figure out what the settlement would be.''
   Wilbur said Union Carbide has set aside $200 million toward the
settlement and had $250 million in insurance coverage, leaving it at
risk for another $20 million as a result of today's settlement.
   ``The risk is minimal,'' he said.
   Today's settlement comes on the heels of a good year for Union
Carbide. In the year ended Dec. 31, Union Carbide earned $720
million, or $5.31 a share, on revenue of $8.32 billion. That
compared to 1987 earnings of $231 million, or $1.76 a share, on
revenue of $6.91 billion.

   A Briton jailed in Iran for more than
three years on spying charges has been sentenced, Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency said today.
   The report did not specify the penalty against Roger Cooper, 52,
but quoted Iranian Intelligence Minister Mohammad Rey-Shahri as
saying a ``heavy ruling'' had been issued.
   Cooper, a businessman who had worked in Iran for more than 30
years, still faced a final judgment, Rey-Shahri said. He did not
elaborate and it was unclear whether the sentence might be revised.
   Rey-Shahri also announced that 2,600 political prisoners will be
released from Iranian jails, IRNA said in the report monitored in
Nicosia.
   He said Cooper confessed to spying and ``nothing could halt this
case.''
   Cooper worked in key Iranian government agencies since 1958 and
began spying for Britain in 1966, Rey-Shahri said.
   Cooper was arrested in November 1985, and his continued detention
has been a source of tension between Britain and Iran. British
officials have said better relations depended in part on resolution
of the case.
   Rey-Shahri, reiterating comments by Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, said British statements on the case were ``illegal and
an interference in the country's internal affairs.''
   Britain withdrew all its diplomats from Tehran and only one
Iranian envoy remained in London after a dispute that began when
British police arrested an Iranian envoy on shoplifting charges in
May 1987.
   Iranian Revolutionary Guards then kidnapped and assaulted a
British diplomat.
   Britain reopened its embassy in Tehran Dec. 9.
   Rey-Shahri said the release of political prisoners is part of the
amnesty Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini granted to mark
the 10th anniversary of the Islamic revolution.
   He said 3,500 counterrevolutionaries were held in jail before the
anniversary and that 900 will remain there.
   Amnesty International and other human rights groups say there are
far more political prisoners that the government's figure of 3,500.
   The Iraqi-based Mujahedeen Khalq, the main Iranian opposition
group, says 140,000 people have been arrested on political charges
since 1981.

<HEAD>New Convoy Reaches Kabul as Last Soviets Departing</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates throughout with Foreign Ministry details on convoys,

   A convoy carrying urgently needed food and fuel to
Kabul arrived in the Afghan capital after breaking through guerrilla
strongholds on the Salang Highway with the help of Afghan soldiers,
Tass said today.
   Vadim Perfilev, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said the Soviet
troop withdrawal was exactly on schedule and the last Soviet
soldiers would be out of Afghanistan by Wednesday, the deadline set
in a U.N.-mediated agreement.
   ``As of Feb. 15, not a single Soviet soldiers will be on Afghan
territory,'' Perfilev told a news briefing.
   The Soviets entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to help the
Afghan army fight Moslem insurgents. At the height of the Soviet
involvement, there were an estimated 115,000 Red Army troops in
Afghanistan.
   Since the second stage of Soviet withdrawal began in January,
more than 45,000 soldiers have left Afghanistan, the official news
agency Tass said.
   The last contingent of troops, led by Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov, was
expected to cross the bridge linking the town of Khairaton with the
Soviet city of Termez just before noon Wednesday, the Soviet
newspaper Trud said.
   As the remaining Soviet troops moved northward on the Salang
Highway toward home, a column of Afghan trucks loaded with
Soviet-supplied food and fuel reached Kabul on Monday from the
north, Tass said in a dispatch from Kabul.
   ``The trucks, which broke through the Salang Pass, delivered
wheat, rice, kerosene and petrol to the capital.''
   Perfilev said the first convoy included 150 fuel trucks and that
an additional 300 were on the way to Kabul. The Afghan capital is
ringed by Moslem guerrillas, and is short on supplies of food and
fuel.
   The Afghan news agency Bakhtar also said Afghan forces were able
to clear a passage for the Soviet convoy. An official Afghan report
said the Soviet shipments to Kabul would continue despite the troop
pullout.
   ``Recently, the Kabul-Khairaton road was under constant attack by
rebels from the Ahmad Shah Masud group,'' Tass said. ``The
operations which have been carried out by Afghan army units recently
significantly weakened the Masud militants' activity,'' the news
agency said.
   Soviet aircraft also were bringing supplies to Kabu, Eduard
Kudryavtsev, a Foreign Ministry official, said today. ``Yesterday,
four Soviet planes flew from Tashkent to Kabul with a shipment of 75
tons of supplies,'' he said.
   A U.N. airlift of food to the Afghan capital has been suspended
because transport crews fear for their safety.

<TEXT>
   The Disabled American Veterans today proposed a
closer alliance between hospitals run by the Veterans Administration
and the military services to save money and improve care.
   Some 300 installations in the VA, Army, Navy and Air Force health
systems have made 1,800 local agreements to share facilities under
1982 legislation. This represents ``just the tip of a mammoth,
cost-effective iceberg,'' DAV National Commander Billy E. Kirby told
a joint hearing of the House and Senate Veterans Affairs committees.
   Both the military and the veterans systems ``are in deep
trouble,'' Kirby said.
   ``Years of below-inflation, less-than-current-service budgets,
combined with rising beneficiary demands'' means that beds go
unused, staff quits and ``care is rationed,'' he said.
   VA officials testified last fall they will fall $600 million to
$1 billion short in their medical budget for the current fiscal
year, a little over $10 billion for 172 hospitals and hundreds of
other facilities. The military services spend about $8 billion
operating 130 hospitals in the United States and hundreds of other
facilities around the world, plus $2 billion in paying civilian
doctors and others.
   From the map, ``is it not obvious to all that from the standpoint
of the proximity of VA and military treatment facilities and their
beneficiaries, the two systems enjoy a potential to operate more
efficiently through sharing of resources, mutual support and
integration of planning and operations?'' Kirby said.
   ``Rather than settling for locally initiated ad hoc agreements,
the more ambitious of which often encounter bureaucratic resistance,
we propose the creation of a new nationwide Veterans
Administration-Department of Defense health care alliance,'' he said.
   ``Two huge medical systems which presently go their own way in
purchasing everything from CAT scans to tongue depressors, from
laundry services to public utilities, certainly could benefit from
single-source contracting and common purchases,'' the DAV leader
said.
   Combining the patients of the two systems, the older males of the
VA system with the younger, serving men and women and their
families, should help staff recruiting, he suggested.

   Kidnappers released former Prime
Minister Paul Vanden Boeynants and he returned home ``safe and
sound'' today after a month in captivity, the Justice Ministry said.
   Unconfirmed reports said the family of Vanden Boeynants, a
wealthy businessman, paid a ransom of as much as $5.1 million.
   The 69-year-old Christian Democrat was freed late Monday near the
railway station in Tournai and took a cab to his Brussels home 50
miles away, said Brussels deputy prosecutor Andre Vandoren.
   There was no immediate explanation of where or under what
conditions he had spent the month. The Justice Ministry said in a
statement that ``Mr. Vanden Boeynants has returned safe and sound.''
   Investigators said they questioned Vanden Boeynants, whose career
has been tainted by scandal, and were satisfied he had been
kidnapped.
   ``Mr. Vanden Boeynants will make a public statement in the coming
days but give him the time to rest,'' Vandoren said.
   A group calling itself the Socialist Revolutionary Brigade had
said it kidnapped him, and demanded a ransom. The group demanded a
$790,000 ransom, two-thirds of which was to be distributed to the
needy.
   The Brussels daily Le Soir reported in its noon edition today
that the family paid between $2.5 million and $5.1 million to the
abductors on Monday. The Belgian news agency Belga also reported a
ransom had been paid but gave no amount.
   Investigators said last month they would not prevent the family
from paying a ransom. ``It is a free country,'' one official said at
the time.
   Le Soir said investigators believe Vanden Boeynants' abductors
fled to France. Tournai is a few miles from the French border.
   The newspaper also reported investigators believe the so-called
Revolutionary Brigade was nothing more than a band of criminals with
no political motives.
   This morning, Vanden Boeynants, wearing sunglasses, appeared
briefly at the window of his seventh floor apartment to wave at
photographers and reporters outside.
   He agreed to see one photographer, Catherine Benoit of the daily
La Nouvelle Gazette.
   She later described him as looking tired, weak and thin and said
she photographed him without a flash light because he could not
stand bright lights.
   Vanden Boeynants disappeared Jan. 14 after he parked his car in
his apartment building's garage, where police found his pipe,
hearing aid and one of his shoes.
   Three days after he disappeared a special parliamentary
commission was to have opened a hearing into accusations he took
bribes while defense minister in the 1970s. The commission later
said there were no grounds for prosecution and dropped the
investigation.
   Vanden Boeynants was a major player in postwar Belgian politics
until a conviction for business tax fraud ended his political career
in 1986.
   After the disappearance, Prime Minister Wilfried Martens said
Vanden Boeynants had received threats in the preceding weeks. He did
not disclose their nature. Vanden Boeynants also had requested a
meeting with the interior minister, presumably to discuss his
personal safety.
   Vanden Boeynants was prime minister from 1966 to 1968 and briefly
in 1978. He was a skilled backstage negotiator during 40 years in
politics and had a hand in most major government decisions.
   He also made a fortune in the meat-packing industry and got into
trouble over taxes. The judge who gave him a three-year suspended
sentence in 1986 called the former prime minister an ``inveterate
swindler'' for whom ``tax evasion is second nature.''

   With winds gently rocking his balloon and
tiny gondola, Fumio Niwa rose into the nighttime sky early Wednesday
on what he hopes will be the first solo balloon flight across the
Pacific.
   Niwa plans to ride high altitude winds across the ocean to North
America in about four days.
   His goal is San Diego, sister city of his home town of Yokohama,
but weather reports said the normally easterly high altitude winds
had veered to the north and were likely to take him toward Alaska.
   ``My long dream of crossing the Pacific is coming true today,''
Niwa said. ``I still wonder if it's really possible. The jetstream
is bending strangely, but America is big, so I think I'll make it _
somewhere.''
   The huge orange and blue balloon has no maneuvering ability, so
its direction depends entirely on the wind.
   Niwa, 38, says he's making the 5,000-mile flight to test the
high-tech helium balloon and enclosed gondola he designed himself.
   The balloonist, who quit his job in a computer company in
November to prepare for the flight, estimates it will cost about
$540,000. He hopes to earn most of that from a future book and
public appearances.
   Niwa has about 1,000 hours of ballooning experience, but most of
that is in hot-air balloons and none outside Japan.

<HEAD>Stalin, Brezhnev Masks the Latest in Bashing of Former Leaders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Their names have disappeared from ships and cities,
but the likenesses of former Soviet leaders Josef Stalin and Leonid
Brezhnev can still be found in Moscow.
   A weekend outing to Moscow's Ismailovo Park, an open marketplace
for artists and craftsmen, provides ample exposure to the latest in
Stalin- and Brezhnev bashing.
   A cluster of Halloween-type masks with ghoulish faces, realistic
enough to make Boris Karloff shriek in terror, includes Stalin and
Brezhnev, both now disgraced in official and unofficial circles.
   The Brezhnev mask _ complete with bushy black eyebrows,
eyeglasses and wrinkles _ was selling for about $40. A visage of
Stalin, selling for the same price, had a thick mustache and a large
nose to mock his Georgian origins.
   Hanging on a piece of plywood next to Stalin and Brezhnev were
masks of a gorrilla and various monsters.
   Other Soviets have joined in the artistic parody, in the form of
political buttons, T-shirts, paintings and even wooden dolls of
Stalin, complete with legendary pipe in one hand and a bloody dagger
in the other.
   Under Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Stalin has been criticized for
killing millions of people with his bloody purges, and Brezhnev has
been hit for ruining the country's economy and culture.
   Homemade political buttons for sale at the park offer such
commentary as ``Boris, You Are Right,'' referring to former Moscow
party chief Boris Yeltsin, who lost his job for pushing too hard for
reform, and ``Yegor, You Are Not Right,'' referring to conservative
Politburo member Yegor Ligachev.
   Another identifies the wearer as a ``veteran of the Cold War.''

<TEXT>
   The Immigration and Naturalization
Service will stop processing amnesty applicants in a building which
city officials cloed last week because of health and safety
violations, an INS official said today.
   Armed with bolt cutters and a temporary restraining order, INS
officials on Monday returned to the former furniture store where the
agency processes more than 2,000 political asylum applicants weekly.
   Officials in this small South Texas town have complained that
refugees, most of them from Central America, had left the building
and surrounding area cluttered with litter and human waste.
   INS District Director Omer G. Sewell said today the agency would
no longer process asylum applications in Harlingen and would handle
the south Texas cases at the INS detention center in brushland about
25 miles from town.
   Candidates seeking amnesty under the 1986 immigration reform law
will continue to be served at the Harlingen building, he said.
   ``We want to be good citizens in this community as well,'' Sewell
said.
   The new asylum office will open Wednesday at the agency's Port
Isabel Service Processing Center, a minimum-security facility where
425 undocumented aliens were detained Tuesday pending action such as
deportation.
   INS officials cut through the chains and padlocks on the doors
Monday afternoon after U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela in
Brownsville set aside a 3-day-old state court order evicting the
federal agency. Friday's eviction was ordered after Harlingen
officials sued to shut down the office for fire and health
violations.
   The INS successfully moved the Harlingen lawsuit from state to
federal court Monday and filed its own federal lawsuit against the
city.
   Vela said he set aside the state court order because it
``prohibits the functions and operations of an agency of the federal
government.''
   The judge also barred Harlingen, 25 miles north of Brownsville,
from interfering with INS business but said the agency still must
follow state and local health and fire regulations. He set a hearing
in the case for Feb. 21.
   Harlingen City Manger Gavino Sotelo said the city would comply
with the order, but added, ``The conditions at the center remain the
same as they were before. There is trash; there is human waste. If
this goes on, we might have to close it all over again.''
   Harlingen Mayor Bill Card added, ``If it had been operated in a
responsible way before, it would have never been closed.''
   City officials promised to monitor the office and make regular
inspections.
   Sewell said barring the INS from the 9,852-square-foot building
not only shut down the political asylum process but also made it
impossible to serve legalization candidates under the Immigration
Reform and Control Act of 1986.
   Vela said the state court's restraining order issued Friday
interfered with the INS' compliance with a federal temporary
restraining order he issued Jan. 9. That order mandated the INS to
allow political asylum applicants to pursue their claims to refugee
status at their intended U.S. destinations after checking in with
the INS in Harlingen.
   With the Harlingen office closed, immigrants could not obtain
documents allowing them passage through U.S. Border Patrol
checkpoints to leave southern Texas.
   Hundreds of immigrants in the center's parking lot appeared
puzzled by the legal maneuverings.
   ``We didn't know what was going to happen,'' said Juan Hernandez
from El Salvador. ``We were just told to wait.''

   The U.S. Army has ordered a college student, who
set off a nationwide search when he ran off with his new wife to
find ``perfect love,'' to serve four years as an enlisted man to
work off his ROTC scholarship.
   Scott Swanson, 24, will be permitted to finish college, delaying
his induction to active duty until as late as May 1990, officials
said. Swanson is working as a sales representative and continuing
his education at an unidentified college.
   Swanson can appeal and, if the Army approves, avoid service by
paying back the $14,673 ROTC scholarship in a lump sum. ``In most
cases it is accepted,'' Capt. Charles R. Wade, an ROTC spokesman.
   ``I won't appeal,'' Swanson said Monday. ``I will enlist.''
   Swanson violated his ROTC contract when he and his wife, Carolyn,
23, disappeared April 2 before he had completed his military and
academic obligations at Wheaton College, a private Christian school.
He had been scheduled to graduate last May.
   Had Swanson completed the requirements, he would have had to
serve four years as an officer.
   The Swansons were secretly married a week before they
disappeared. Their ransacked car was found in a Chicago alley with
the engine running, leading to fears of foul play.
   The couple turned up unharmed July 27 in San Diego, where they
said they had been living under assumed names, pursuing ``perfect
love.''
   Maj. Gen. Robert E. Wagner, the national ROTC commander, issued a
statement Monday saying he had determined that Swanson willfully
evaded the terms of his ROTC scholarship and is disenrolled from the
Army ROTC program.
   ``He is directed to serve on active duty as an enlisted man for
four years to satisfy the ROTC contractual agreement,'' he said.
   In August, Swanson, who lives with his wife in west suburban
Naperville, asked a military review board to recommend that he
become commissioned as an Army officer.
   But after an administrative hearing at Fort Sheridan, the board
recommended that Swanson be kicked out of the service and his ROTC
scholarship terminated.
   Swanson said he wrote Wagner in November saying that while he
wanted his officer's commission, he would equally welcome entering
the Army as an enlisted man.
   In the letter, Swanson expressed regret for his actions, saying
he had ``made a mistake'' and wished to deal with it ``in an upright
manner.''

   Heavy rains flooded roads in Tennessee
today, closing schools, forcing the evacuation of residents and
hospital patients and killing one woman swept from her car by
rushing water, authorities said.
   More than 3 inches of rain fell between midnight and dawn in
Nashville and surrounding counties. Forecasters said the rain would
continue through tonight.
   About 4 feet of water stood in the Lebanon town square after
Sinking Creek overran its banks, police dispatcher Bob Harrison said.
   Emergency workers evacuated all 55 patients from McFarland-Humana
Hospital in Lebanon, just east of Nashville, after electricity to
the building was shut off, said Glenna Hunt of the Wilson County
Civil Defense agency.
   The power was disconnected after heavy rain seeped inside
transformers outside the building, she said. Patients were taken to
surrounding hospitals in DeKalb and Davidson counties.
   A woman who ignored police warnings not to cross flooded state
Highway 231 in Lebanon became stuck amid the flood waters about 7
a.m., Wilson County sheriff Terry Ashe said. She tried to get out of
her car, was swept away and drowned.
   Rush-hour traffic became snarled as water built up on highways
leading into Nashville.
   ``The major problems are centered around Interstate 40 east near
Lebanon, and parts of Interstate 24,'' said Highway Patrol
dispatcher Melody Land. ``There's a lot of water in the road,
several stalled cars.''
   Water was reported in some first-floor apartments in Nashville
and a mudslide was reported in the Bellevue area in western Davidson
County.
   In Jackson, two families were evacuated from their homes near
Cane Creek. Flash flood watches were issued for the western
two-thirds of Tennessee.
   At least 64 other people left their homes because of rising
water, said Danny Newton, chief of operations for the Tennessee
Emergency Management Agency.
   ``We have some low-lying areas with creeks in them and they built
close to them; and it normally floods when we get a rain,'' Newton
said. ``Most everybody is used to this and does it on their own
without reporting it to anybody.''
   Public schools were closed in Wilson County because of the threat
of flooding, but schools in the metropolitan Nashville area remained
open, authorities said.

<HEAD>Bennett, Nominee for Drug Czar, Struck It Rich Outside Government</HEAD>

   William J. Bennett, President Bush's nominee to
become drug czar, struck it rich on the lecture circuit after
resigning as education secretary last September, picking up $15,000
to $20,000 per speech.
   ``I had a good few months in the private sector, the best three
to four months I ever had,'' Bennett said. ``I was told it would
have been a very good year for me.''
   If the Senate confirms Bush's nomination of Bennett to become
director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Bennett will
be paid $99,500 a year.
   Bennett ``turned down $1.5 million in lectures in 1989'' when
Bush nominated him last month, according to a lecture-circuit
industry source who requested anonymity.
   Bennett reported having a savings account worth less than $1,001
on Sept. 20 when he resigned as education secretary.
   Bennett and his wife, Elayne, who are expecting a second child,
live with their 5-year-old son, John, in a rented home in nearby
Montgomery County, Md. He says that ``we can't buy a house where we
want to live on these salaries.''
   During the past few months, Bennett was earning $15,000 to
$20,000 per speech for a total of ``about $150,000 to $200,000,
which was just getting his feet wet,'' said Don Walker, president of
the New York-based Harry Walker Agency, which got 30 percent of the
fees.
   ``Well, we had a good Christmas,'' Bennett said, reflecting on
the likelihood that he'll be taking home a lot less this year _ his
government salary.
   His earnings during the past few months should be reflected in
the latest financial disclosure form he submitted to the White House
counsel's office. But the form has not yet been made public. Such
forms give only ranges, not exact figures.
   According to Bennett's most recent publicly released form,
covering 1988 up to Sept. 20, indicates in addition to the savings
account that Bennett and his wife had checking accounts of less than
$1,001 apiece, a retirement annuity worth $50,001 to $100,000, an
undisclosed salary for his wife from Georgetown University funded by
a foundation based there, and a brokerage account worth $1,001 to
$5,000.
   That brokerage account is with the San Francisco office of Bear
Stearns &amp; Co., the same office that handled many lucrative one-day
trades for now-indicted W. Franklyn Chinn, who was managing money
for former Attorney General Edwin Meese III when Meese and Bennett
were in Reagan's Cabinet.
   ``Oh God, no!'' Bennett said when asked whether he knew of the
connection between that office and Chinn, who is awaiting trial on
racketeering charges in the Wedtech defense contracting scandal. ``I
didn't know that.''
   Bennett said his account was in that office because his broker,
Reed Freyermuth, is a college friend.
   Bennett's financial disclosure forms for the past few years
reveal that he had 18 one-day or two-day stock trades handled by
that office, including three involving stocks traded the same day by
Chinn for Meese.
   Bear Stearns had an underwriting position in all three of those
new issues of stock, making it likely that many of the firm's
customers would have been guided toward them.
   Trade in British Airways stock on Feb. 11, 1987, earned Bennett
$101 to $1,000, while Meese got $12,571. Microsoft Inc. stock deals
on March 13, 1986, earned Bennett another $101 to $1,000, while
Meese got $1,550, and trading in Morgan Stanley Co. on March 21,
1986, earned Bennett $1,001 to $2,500 while Meese received $1,322.
The information on Meese was provided by his attorneys to the
independent counsel investigating the then-attorney general.
   Bennett, who got on the phone to answer questions about his
finances just a few minutes after an aide was asked about the
one-day trades and Chinn, said Freyermuth handled it all.
   ``I am an idiot about this stuff,'' Bennett said. ``I gave him
the enormous sums you're looking at and said, `Do what you can.'''
   Freyermuth said that although there were ``no major killings,
unfortunately,'' his friend of almost 30 years came out all right
financially.
   ``Every one of those trades was profitable, and I always charged
him the bare bones, most minimum commissions,'' he said.
   While out of office, Bennett became president of The Madison
Center, a policy group he created with $500,000 in start-up funds
from The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation of Milwaukee.
   Bennett also signed a contract with Simon and Schuster to write
two books, but he'll only have time to complete one if he gets the
drug director job, said his attorney, Bob Barnett of Williams &amp;
Connolly. Barnett would not reveal the contract's value.

<TEXT>
   Cooperation between military and veterans
hospitals should be expanded to save money and improve care, the
Disabled American Veterans said Tuesday.
   The three military hospital systems and the Veterans
Administration system are in ``deep trouble'' because of years of
financial starvation in the face of growing patient demands, said
Billy E. Kirby, national commander of the group.
   Lack of money has brought about losses of staff and beds and a
rationing of care, he said at a joint hearing of the House and
Senate Veterans Affairs committees.
   In 1982 Congress permitted local installations to agree with
their neighbors in another hospital system to share facilities _ for
example, to send over patients needing a CAT scan rather than buy a
second scanner.
   There are now 1,800 agreements involving 300 installations, and
that cooperation represents ``just the tip of a mammoth,
cost-effective iceberg,'' said Kirby.
   ``Rather than settling for locally initiated ad hoc agreements,
the more ambitious of which often encounter bureaucratic resistance,
we propose the creation of a new nationwide Veterans
Administration-Department of Defense health care alliance,'' he said.
   However, Thomas Keller, DAV spokesman, said outside the hearing
room the group was not propopsing a full merger of the systems, and
each would keep its own administration.
   Both Donna St. John, spokeswoman for the Veterans Administration,
and Susan Hansen, spokeswoman for the Defense Department, said they
could not comment on Kirby's proposal because officials had not seen
it.
   Each said the local cooperation agreements were working well and
saving money.
   Kirby said, ``Two huge medical systems which presently go their
own way in purchasing everything from CAT scans to tongue
depressors, from laundry services to public utilities, certainly
could benefit from single-source contracting and common purchases.''
   Also, he suggested that access to a more varied pool of patients,
combining the generally older males using the VA systems with the
serving men and women and their families using the military
hospitals, should help in the recruitment of medical staff.
   The Veterans Administration spends more than $10 billion a year
on 172 hospitals, 229 outpatient clinics, 117 nursing homes and 208
other installations. Officials testified last fall they expect to
fall $600 million to $1 billion short during the current fiscal
year, a shortage many members of Congress have said will have to be
met through a supplemental appropriation and one the VA has so far
met by juggling accounts and turning away some patients it is not
required to treat.
   The Army, Navy and Air Force operate 500 medical installations,
including 130 hospitals in the United States. The three services
spend about $10 billion a year on medical care, of which about $2
billion goes to civilian providers.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Start 1989 On Strong Note</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer spending began the year on a sunny
note as retail sales rose 0.6 percent in January, the government
said Tuesday in a report that added to concerns the economy is
speeding forward so quickly it may fuel inflation.
   The Commerce Department said sales rose last month to a
seasonally adjusted $138.9 billion. That followed a revised 0.1
percent decrease in December and a 1.3 percent increase in November.
   ``Consumers were in a pretty good mood when they started
January,'' said economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in
New York. ``Good weather got them into shopping malls and they were
spending money. Despite higher interest rates, they did not feel
pinched.''
   January's increase was bolstered by a 1.7 percent increase in the
important general merchandise category, which includes department
stores. Sales in that category had inched up 0.1 percent in December.
   Major department store chains reported their January sales had
been aided by mild winter weather, which encouraged shoppers and
added to sales volume. In addition, lean inventories resulted in
higher prices, which boosted overall sales figures.
   Some analysts said the latest retail sales report, coupled with
other evidence of strong economic growth at the start of the year,
could lead the Federal Reserve Board to continue to nudge up
interest rates in its ongoing effort to slow the economy and keep
inflation in check.
   ``The economy will continue to exceed the speed limit, on
average, in the quarter ahead,'' said Robert G. Dederick, chief
economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``The Federal Reserve
will have to move toward further restraint.''
   The unexpectedly strong January sales performance came despite a
0.9 percent drop in car sales, which followed a 0.4 percent dip in
December. Sales had weakened in early January as manufacturers ended
steep year-end discounts.
   Excluding autos, which account for about one-fourth of the retail
total, sales in January were up 1 percent, following an unchanged
sales pace in December.
   ``People are making a lot of money and they're feeling very good
and they're still going out there buying,'' said economist Sandra
Shaber of the Futures Group in Washington. ``I suspect that is going
to continue happening until the economy runs out of steam. We can't
count on the consumer to slow the economy down.''
   Steinberg predicted the pace of retail sales would decrease later
this year as consumer spending is restrained by a slowdown in
employment gains and by higher interest rates, including rising
monthly payments for homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages.
   Retail spending is seen as a key barometer of economic health
because it represents about one-third of the gross national product.
   Sales of durable goods, ``big ticket'' items intended to last
three or more years, edged up 0.1 percent in January after an
identical rise in December. Non-durable goods surged 0.8 percent
after dropping 0.2 percent during the previous month.
   The only merchandise category besides autos to record a decrease
in January was clothing and accessory stores, where sales fell 1.1
percent.
   Drugs stores reported a 2.9 percent increase in sales after a 2.7
percent decrease in December. Sales at restaurants and bars were up
1.2 percent after a 1.1 percent increase during the previous month.
   Furniture and home furnishing sales were up 0.4 percent in
January after a 1.1 percent drop in December. Sales of hardware and
building supplies rose 1.4 percent after a 2 percent increase the
previous month.
   Grocery and other food store sales were up 1 percent after a 0.9
percent drop. Gasoline station sales also were up 1 percent last
month after the same increase the previous month.

<TEXT>
   A woman was sentenced today to 12 years in
prison for force-feeding her adopted 4-year-old daughter a fatal
dose of salt as punishment for stealing sugar.
   Beth Michelle Riggs, 36, wept as Roanoke County Circuit Judge
Kenneth Trabue imposed the sentence on her second-degree murder
conviction in the May salt poisoning death of Heather Riggs.
   Commonwealth's attorney Skip Burkart had asked for the maximum
sentence of 20 years, saying Mrs. Riggs had deprived her daughter of
most of her life expectancy.
   ``Maybe we ought to feed her 56 spoons of salt and see how she
likes it,'' Burkart said, noting that that amount of salt would be
an equivalent dose for an adult.
   ``But we can't do that. Everybody on earth would come forward and
say that's cruel and unusual,'' Burkart said.
   Defense Attorney James Swanson asked for a prison senence of 12
years to be suspended after six years. He said the case didn't call
for the maximum because Mrs. Riggs never intended to kill her
daughter.
   ``Mr. Burkart preaches an eye for an eye, but then says society
wouldn't put up with it,'' Swanson said. ``I think the whole sense
of an eye for an eye, given these facts, is not justice.''
   Earlier today, Mrs. Riggs testified that she force-fed the child
an undetermined number of spoonfuls of salt on May 16 as punishment
for stealing sugar, but had no idea the salt would prove fatal.
   ``If I had known it was going to hurt her, I would never have
done it,'' said Mrs. Riggs, who had punished the child on a separate
occassion by forcing her to eat pepper.
   ``Mrs. Riggs indicated that she had been having a lot of trouble
with Heather eating food without permission,'' county probation
officer Donna W. Clayton said. Ms. Clayton testified that Mrs. Riggs
told her she had fed the girl a mixture of salt and sugar ``to show
Heather she shouldn't just eat any or everything.''

<HEAD>School Report: Basics Better but High-Level Achievement Lacking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The traditional classroom, with its lecturing
teachers and workbooks, is turning out students with basic skills
but little more, says a report issued Tuesday.
   The National Assessment of Educational Progress called for major
changes in how and what American students are taught, based on 20
years of evaluations that indicate a disturbing lack of high-level
achievement across the board.
   ``It is apparent that fundamental changes may be needed to help
American schoolchildren develop both content knowledge and the
ability to reason effectively about what they know _ skills that are
essential if they are to take an intelligent part in the worlds of
life and work,'' said the report.
   The group credited ``relatively traditional'' classrooms, relying
heavily on textbooks, workbook exercises and teacher presentations,
with gains at the lower levels of achievement.
   But it said teachers will have to become less authoritarian and
students less passive if more sophisticated learning is to occur.
``Discussion teams, cooperative work groups, individual learning
logs, computer networking and other activities will need to be added
and may even predominate,'' the report said.
   The group has studied the math, science, reading and writing
performance of 9-, 13- and 17-year-olds for 20 years under the
auspices of the private Educational Testing Service. Some 1.4
million pupils have participated in the studies, which are paid for
by the Education Department.
   The group's latest observations come in ``Crossroads in American
Education,'' a review of trends in all four subject areas since the
first assessment in 1970.
   Not all the news was bad.
   ``Our assets clearly include strengthening students' basic skills
and improving minority student performance,'' said executive
director Archie LaPointe. But, echoing the conclusions of numerous
recent reports, he added that ``we find deficits in higher-order
thinking skills.''
   The report said reading proficiency has improved and earlier
declines in math, writing and science appear to have been reversed.
In addition, it said gaps between minority and white student
performance have been reduced considerably in certain subjects.
   But the report noted that not all lost ground has been regained
and even the benchmark _ the earliest assessments _ is considered
below par. Furthermore, it said, recent gains have been mostly at
the lower levels.
   ``For example, students have improved in their ability to do
simple computation, comprehend simple text, and exhibit knowledge of
everyday science facts,'' the report said. ``Yet despite these signs
of progress, it remains true that only some of the nation's students
can perform moderately difficult tasks and woefully few can perform
more difficult ones.''
   The group said more homework, higher performance standards and
more course work in core subjects _ all elements of the current
education reform movement _ can help improve performance.
   Leading the group to its recommendations were findings such as
these:
   _About one-third of 9-year-olds could not yet read simple texts
and about one-quarter did not have beginning math skills or
understand simple scientific principles such as the structure and
function of plants and animals.
   _More than one-quarter of 13-year-olds failed to demonstrate an
adequate understanding of elementary school math skills. Forty
percent could not read passages at an intermediate level of
difficulty. Only half displayed an understanding of basic scientific
information.
   _Sixty-one percent of 17-year-olds could not read or understand
high-school level material while nearly half had no math skills
beyond adding, subtracting and multiplying with whole numbers.
   The general trends were slightly more encouraging. Students at
all three ages were reading significantly better in 1984 than in
1971. Math proficiency among the two younger groups was better in
1986 than in 1973, and the oldest teens improved significantly in
1982 and 1986 after a nine-year decline.
   Drops in science in all age groups appear to have been stemmed,
although no group was doing better than its 1970 level as of 1986.
And writing proficiency across the ages ``generally appeared to be
no better in 1984 than it was 10 years earlier.''

   A warning light prompted the pilot of a British
Airways Boeing 757 jetliner with 40 people aboard to turn off an
engine, but the plane landed safely using its other engine, the
airline said Tuesday.
   A small temperature rise in the right-hand engine turned on the
fire-warning light during Monday's flight, the airline said. As a
result, the pilot shut down the engine as the plane approached
London's Heathrow Airport.
   Flight 391 from Brussels landed safely, powered only by the
left-hand engine, the spokeswoman said.
   Engineers found no incorrect wiring or other faults in the
right-hand engine, the spokeswoman said. She said the cause of the
temperature increase was unknown.
   Authorities ordered a check of wiring in several types of
aircraft after a Boeing 737 crashed last month in central England
and killed 47 people. The crash, whose cause in still under
investigation, led to speculation that a warning light could have
led the pilot to unnecessarily shut off an engine.

<HEAD>Bush Postpones MX-vs.-Midgetman Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, weighing an issue that could
alter the basis of nuclear negotiations, has postponed a decision on
whether to continue building MX missiles or switch to the smaller,
single-warhead Midgetman, his spokesman said Tuesday.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush will not
meet a Wednesday deadline imposed by Congress for a decision.
   ``We are reviewing the entire strategic posture of the country
and it is logical and necessary that we postpone this major decision
until the review is complete,'' Fitzwater said.
   Because of the review, the administration also has put off
resuming nuclear arms control talks with the Soviet Union. They were
to have started anew in Geneva on Wednesday.
   In an era of tight budgets and big deficits, it is generally
agreed the Pentagon cannot build both the 10-warhead MX missile and
the single-warhead Midgetman.
   Trying to force a decision from the White House, Congress last
year stipulated that $350 million which was earmarked for the MX
program could not be spent until the new administration announced
how it would proceed.
   Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, has
argued for years that a single-warhead missile such as the Midgetman
_ weighing about 15 tons as opposed to 100 tons for the MX _ could
ease a Soviet threat to U.S. land-based missiles in fixed silos.
   A smaller missile with only one warhead would be a far less
tempting target to Soviet war planners, it is reasoned, and could be
the basis for arms control agreements based on counting the number
of warheads, not launchers.
   Currently, the number of launchers is the key element in arms
control agreements. That has spurred development of multiple warhead
weapons, such as the triple warhead Minuteman and the 10-warhead MX
and similar weapons in the Soviet arsenal.
   In 1983, Scowcroft was head of a presidential commission on
strategic forces during the Reagan administration and advocated
development of the Midgetman. He has not publicly endorsed either
the MX or the Midgetman since joining Bush's administration.
   Fitzwater said the White House will send a report to Congress on
Wednesday explaining that the administration is conducting a review
but omitting any decision regarding the MX or Midgetman or other
type of small intercontinental ballistic missiles.
   He said he could not estimate when the White House would reach a
decision but noted that Bush has instructed advisers to report
within 90 days on the overall review of national security policy.
   The spokesman said that the stalled confirmation process
surrounding John Tower's nomination as secretary of defense had not
been a factor in delaying the missile decision. ``He's in on much of
the review,'' Fitzwater said.

<TEXT>
   First lady Barbara Bush paid a Valentine's Day
visit Tuesday to a nursing home, left a handmade valentine for each
patient and said that President Bush is ``a good man and he won't
let you down.''
   The residents of the nursing home for the elderly and terminally
ill gave her a giant poster-board valentine: ``To Mrs. Bush. Always
the first lady in our hearts.''
   Leaving a signed, handmade valentine for each patient, she told a
group of them who gathered to chat with her: ``That really means I
love you all.''
   Mrs. Bush is a board member at the non-profit Washington Home and
was a volunteer there while Bush was in Congress in the 1960s.
   Sitting with a group of elderly patients in a sunlit room while
reporters and board members looked on, Mrs. Bush answered questions
about her new life in the White House.
   Asked how she liked being first lady, she replied: ``I'm not
really sure I am the first lady of the land but I love being married
to the president.
   ``I love my house, and I love my life so I feel pretty good.''
   On what she hoped to accomplish, she mentioned her efforts to
improve literacy in the country and said she would soon set up a
foundation to promote that cause. She said it would focus on
literacy in the family because parents ``aren't parenting as much
any more as they might be or should be.''
   She also mentioned another goal: ``I hope I'll make people care
more about one another. I think that's very important.''
   On another favorite subject, her family, Mrs. Bush said she would
be going to Denver this week to visit a new grandchild, Ashley, who
was born last week to Neil and Sharon Bush.
   When one man wished success for the president, Mrs. Bush replied:
   ``I appreciate that and remember, his success is yours and my
success, too. ... He's a good man and he won't let you down.''
   Mrs. Bush also commented on her recent visit to Ottawa for her
husband's first foreign trip as president.
   She mentioned visiting a school with Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney's wife, Mila, whom she called ``a very young, beautiful
good friend.''
   She enjoyed the trip, she said, ``but more important, I think the
two husbands really had a chance to talk.''
   Mrs. Bush raved about living in the White House and said she
likes the way it was decorated by Nancy Reagan, so she will not be
making major changes except to redo Franklin Pierce's old office to
be Bush's office.
   Mrs. Bush noted that she is remotely related to Pierce, who was
president in 1853-57.
   ``It's the most beautiful house you could possibly believe,'' she
said. ``It's filled with beautiful paintings, lovely furniture and
bright sunshine. If you couldn't be happy in the White House, you
just couldn't be happy anyplace.''
   She greeted about two dozen patients individually.
   Oe elderly man, Nathan Scott, wanted to show her two letters he
said he had received from Bush last year. One, dated Oct. 31,
thanked him for donating to Bush's campaign fund. The other, from
July, thanked him for a donation helping to retire the debt of one
of Bush's rivals for the Republican nomination, Sen. Bob Dole of
Kansas.
   Mrs. Bush glanced at the letters and quipped, ``He wrote you and
asked you for money? You ought to scold him.''

<HEAD>ABC Temporarily Pulls `Moonlighting' Off Air</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC is temporarily silencing David and
Maddie's bickering as ``Moonlighting,'' once television's darling,
goes off the air until later this spring, the network announced
today.
   ``Moonlighting,'' which has run into hard times both creatively
and in the Nielsen ratings, will return in the spring with all new
episodes, according to Brandon Stoddard, president of ABC
Entertainment.
   The detective show is being taken off the air to make way for two
new half-hour comedy series, ``Anything But Love,'' starring Jamie
Lee Curtis and Richard Lewis, and ``Coach,'' starring Craig T.
Nelson, Jerry Van Dyke and Shelley Fabares.
   ``The Wonder Years'' will move to 8:30 p.m. Tuesday and
``Roseanne'' will move to 9 p.m. Tuesday on Feb. 28, Stoddard said.
   ``Coach'' will have a sneak preview at 9:30 p.m. that same
Tuesday, then move into its regular 9 p.m. time slot on Wednesday,
March 1. ``Anything But Loved'' will premiere in its regular time
slot at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, March 7.
   ``Moonlighting,'' which stars Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd as
the bickering detectives, has fallen in the ratings and is now
regularly beaten by NBC's ``In the Heat of the Night.''
   The show was hurt when Shepherd became pregnant and the producers
also decided to make Maddie pregnant. Much of the burden for
carrying the show fell on its secondary stars, Allyce Beasley and
Curtis Armstrong.
   The show suffered further when Maddie entered into a quickie
marriage, then had a miscarriage. Glenn Caron, the show's creator,
has left the show.

   Winter wheat was still in need of moisture in
parts of the central and southern Great Plains during the week of
Feb. 6-12, the government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said
Tuesday.
   ``Damage from cold weather was still unknown in the plains and
the Pacific Northwest, but some was expected,'' the report said.
``Winter wheat was mostly good in the Corn Belt.''
   The report by the Agriculture and Commerce departments did not
include weather developments this week, which included heavy snow,

   Singer-songwriter Smokey Robinson said
he became addicted to cocaine after the 1985 break-up of his
marriage and the death of his father, but is now drug-free and will
release an autobiography and an album this year.
   ``Smokey: Inside My Life'' is to be out March 1. In a recent
interview with The Associated Press, the singer said he wanted to
discuss his 16-month addiction.
   ``At the time I didn't know I was escaping the pain of leaving
home after 27 years. I didn't know I was escaping the death of my
dad. ... But the Lord had me go through this to let young people
know, and everybody know, what it could do to you and that there is
a way out,'' said the singer, who is to appear at Bally's Grand
Hotel and Casino this weekend.
   Smokey Robinson and the Miracles' hits included ``Shop Around''
and ``Tears of a Clown.'' Robinson, who is also a vice president of
Motown, won a Grammy for Best R&amp;B Male Vocalist in 1987.

   Rod Stewart has become the latest recruit in the
rock 'n' roll cola wars, with Pepsi Cola Co. announcing Tuesday that
the singer will peddle its soft drink in Latin American ads later
this year.
   Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
   Last month, Pepsi said it signed pop star Madonna for a global ad
campaign. That announcement came on the heels comes of industry
leader Coca-Cola Co.'s new ad campaign aimed at pushing sales of
Diet Coke. Coke signed pop singer George Michael for a series of
commercials, on top of a campaign already featuring hockey star
Wayne Gretzky, model Elle MacPherson and ``Miami Vice'' star Don
Johnson, a one-time Pepsi pitchman.

   The difference between American and British
humor? Easy, say members of the irreverent comedy troupe Monty
Python.
   ``American humor pays more,'' replied Eric Idle at a seminar
marking the opening Monday of the Museum of Broadcasting's 20th
Anniversary Salute to Monty Python.
   Idle, Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam, half the wacky sextet that
created the Ministry of Silly Walks, the fish-slapping dance and
other classic comic bits, fielded questions from fans.
   ``Is there anything that you people wouldn't do?'' asked a
devotee.
   ``We would never, ever mock the Museum of Broadcasting,'' intoned
Jones.
   ``Monty Python's Flying Circus'' made its premiere on the BBC on
Oct. 5, 1969. The last original show was broadcast in December 1974.
   The group, which also include John Cleese, Graham Chapman and
Michael Palin, split after making several feature films, but there
is talk of reuniting, said the members at the museum.

   An 8-year-old girl broke through a
police cordon Tuesday to give Prince Charles a surprise Valentine's
Day present.
   ``I couldn't afford red roses, but I thought he would like
daffodils,'' said Clair McCartney, who ran up to the prince outside
Todmorden Town Hall. Charles was in the northern England town to
discuss a Business in the Community project.
   Charles, heir to the British throne, thanked her for the gift and
asked her if she had picked the flowers herself. She said no and
told reporters later she had paid 50 pence _ 88 cents _ for the
bouquet.
   The prince received the flowers with more dipolmacy than a gift
presented him later in the day. When 80-year-old sculptor Sam
Tonkiss gave Charles a bust, he thanked him and asked: ``By the way,
who is it of?''
   ``It's your wife, sir,'' Tonkiss said. The artist later told
reporters, ``It was a little embarrassing, but I think he was quite
pleased.''

   The last Red Army soldiers climbed
aboard giant miitary transport planes and flew home tonight, a
Soviet officer said, leaving Afghan armed forces to defend the
embattled capital alone for the first time in nine years.
   Just hours before the Soviets departed, Moslem guerrillas fired
five rockets into Kabul, killing four children and an adult, and
hitting Kabul airport, according to official reports.
   Reporters watched as at least 80 Soviet soldiers boarded giant
Il-76 planes. Earlier, it had been thought only about 40 Soviet
troops remained in Kabul the day before the Wednesday deadline set
under a U.N.-sponsored agreement for the withdrawal of the Red Army.
   Lt. Col. Pytor Sardarchuk declined to say exactly how many troops
were leaving. ``All those who are left'' were going, he said.
   Then he turned to reporters watching the final departure, shook
their hands and said ``goodbye.''
   Earlier, Moslem guerrillas launched their first attack in more
than a month on Kabul airport, the capital's key link with the
outside world.
   The rockets came crashing down near a runway, but no one was
injured, Soviet soldiers said after the attack.
   They were stationed at the airport, guarding military transports
delivering food and other supplies to the besieged capital.
   Radio Kabul said one of the rockets exploded in a bazaar where
dozens of people were lining up to buy bread. The blast killed four
children and an old man, it said.
   Moscow sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1979 to support
the Marxist government's battle against Moslem guerrillas. At one
point, the Kremlin had an estimated 115,00 troops in Afghanistan.
   Besides the small contingent of soldiers who flew out tonight,
several thousand Red Army troops were approaching the Soviet border,
Soviet diplomats said. They spoke on condition of anonymity.
   With the Soviet departure over, Kabul was generally quiet. There
were few rockets whizzing back and forth, and the markets were
crowded.
   However, residents said letters, unsigned and delivered the past
few nights, warn people to stay off the streets starting Wednesday.
Many residents believed the letters came from the guerrilla forces
bearing down on the city.
   The letters have prompted worry that attacks will resume after
the Soviets leave.
   Written in the local Dari language, the letters warn residents to
stay off the streets, close their shops, and keep away from the
airport.
   Some foreign diplomats suggested the letters might be the work of
Khadd, the Najib government's secret police.
   A U.N. airlift of food to Kabul, where food and fuel are in short
supply, has been suspended because transport crews fear for their
safety.
   Guerrilla attacks and heavy show have delayed Soviet convoys
carrying food, fuel and other supplies into the capital. There have
been long lines at bakeries and gasoline stations in Kabul.
   One Soviet convoy arrived overnight after traveling down the
Salang Highway into the city of more than 2 million.
   The Soviet Union also has been airlifting up to 600 tons of flour
and other goods to Kabul in an effort to help ease shortages. But
the supplies are handed out to government workers and members of the
ruling party.

   An advanced navigation satellite was
propelled into orbit Tuesday by the Air Force's new Delta 2 rocket,
a 128-foot-tall booster developed after the Challenger disaster to
carry vital military payloads.
   The three-stage $30 million rocket roared off its launch pad on
schedule at 1:30 p.m. and the Air Force reported 30 minutes later
that it had released the satellite into an initial elliptical orbit
ranging from about 100 to 11,000 miles high.
   ``The spacecraft separation occurred on time and everything looks
fine'' said Lt. Col. Ron Rand, the Air Force launch commentator.
   On Thursday an onboard motor will fire to shift the satellite
into a circular orbit in which both the high and low points will be
about 11,000 miles high.
   The launch was postponed Sunday just 13 minutes before the
planned liftoff after balloon data showed that winds several miles
above the launch pad were too strong for the rocket to pass through
safely.
   Rand reported the winds today had shifted to a more favorable
direction and had calmed.
   Aboard the Delta 2 for its maiden flight was a $65 million
Navstar Global Position System payload that will enable U.S. and
allied military units such as ships, planes, submarines and tanks to
locate their positions within 50 feet by using an encrpyted channel.
The accuracy for civilian users will be within 300 feet.
   The satellite, which contains an atomic clock with an error rate
of one second every 300,000 years, was designed to provide
information on longitude, latitude and altitude.
   The Delta 2 is a more powerful model of the Delta 1, which has
logged 170 successes in 182 launches since 1960. It is the first of
three new space boosters the Air Force ordered built to carry
national security payloads after the Challenger exploded in 1986.
   The grounding of the shuttle fleet and the Air Force Titan 34D
rocket, also after a 1986 failure, has left the Pentagon with a
backlog of about 40 reconnaissance, communications, navigation and
other military satellites.
   The new Titan 4 rocket is scheduled to debut here next month,
with the Atlas 2 set for a 1990 maiden launch.

<HEAD>Soviet Media Warns that Afghanistan Could Turn into `Lebanon'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet media that for years failed to tell the
Soviet people their sons were fighting in Afghanistan said Tuesday
the Red Army's withdrawal could turn the Moslem country into ``a
second Lebanon.''
   One newspaper on the eve of the Soviet withdrawal deadline quoted
a combat-hardened army major as asking why so many Soviet soldiers
had to die.
   ``Was this war necessary for us? Were our numerous casualties
justified?'' said Maj. Pavel Pinchanov, a 32-year-old combat veteran
quoted by the labor newspaper Trud in an article headlined, ``The
Last March.'' It said those questions are shared by soldiers and
civilians alike.
   The article did not give any casualty figures, and Soviet media
generally skirt the issue. Government spokesmen have said 15,000
Soviet soldiers died and more than 35,000 were wounded in the
nine-year war.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and an
estimated 115,000 were in the country when the withdrawal began May
15, 1988, under a U.N.-mediated agreement. Wednesday is the deadline
for all to be gone.
   When Soviet soldiers began fighting in Afghanistan, their own
newspapers were silent. Even parents of the early casualties were
told their sons had died in accidents while on a peaceful aid
mission in the neighboring country.
   The possibility of Afghanistan becoming another Lebanon ravaged
by endless battles was suggested by Gennady Gerasimov, spokesman for
the Soviet Foreign Ministry, in his weekly column in Soviet Culture.
   Gerasimov blamed the perilous situation in Afghanistan on its
long history, noting that Englishmen had suggested in 1979 that the
Soviets had not read enough Rudyard Kipling stories of the hardships
of British soldiers in the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan a
century ago.
   He quoted American sociologists Ekbal Achmad and Richard Barnett
as writing, ``Beyond the boundaries of village and tribe, most
Afghans look on each other fearfully, as strangers.''
   ``Even the presence of a common enemy, as the Soviet soldiers
were insidiously portrayed, could not unite the warring factions,''
Gerasimov wrote.
   Now, he said, ``There is only one way out _ the path of national
reconciliation. It is a difficult path, going against a tradition of
bloody revenge, but it is the only one.''
   ``Otherwise, there will be a second Lebanon,'' he concluded.
   The Trud article insisted that Soviet troops ``know their labor
was not in vain, and the Afghan people will find the forces to
defend the integrity and independence of their motherland.''
   But the conclusion jarred with its description of what was left
behind by retreating Soviets.
   ``Some garrisons have been plundered. Certain posts and
strongholds transferred to the Afghans have been emptied,'' the
article said. ``Their troops, who were subjected to threats and
hostile action, simply fled. The extremists have already moved in.
   ``The political situation in the republic is becoming tense.
Attacks by military formations on peaceful cities are increasing
daily, not to mention the artillery and rocket shellings of Kabul,
Kandahar, Jalalabad and other big centers. The extremists from
Peshawar don't want a peaceful national settlement,'' it said,
referring to the city in western Pakistan where many Moslem
guerrillas are based.
   The newspaper Lenin's Banner published a description of the
various factions in Afghanistan under the headline, ``Afghanistan:
What happens after the 15th?''
   ``A realistic evaluation of the state of affairs, alas, does not
give grounds for extreme optimism,'' the newspaper said, because
none of the warring groups is dominant either politically or
militarily.
   Lenin's Banner blamed the sad prospects for the future on the
``irreconcilable opposition'' _ a common Moscow term for the
guerrillas _ ``which doesn't want to make any contacts with the
government of Kabul.'' It further blamed the United States and
Pakistan, accusing them of repeated violations of the Geneva accords
that led to the Soviet withdrawal.

<HEAD>Abductors Free Vanden Boeynants After Ransom Payment ^LaserPhoto

   Paul Vanden Boeynants, the former prime
minister who disappeared from his apartment garage a month ago,
returned home safely Tuesday and officials indicated his family paid
a ransom of about $1 million.
   Prosecutor Andre Rutten said the 69-year-old politician and
businessman was freed in ``reasonably good'' condition at 10:20 p.m.
Monday near the railway station in Tournai, 50 miles southwest of
Brussels near the French border.
   Vanden Boeynants took a taxi to his home and called investigators
about midnight, Rutten said.
   He told reporters the abductors were still at large, but ``it's
not over. The investigation continues on all fronts.''
   The Vanden Boeynants family paid a ransom of ``several tens of
millions of francs,'' Rutten said. Ten million francs is the
equivalent of $255,000.
   Rutten's deputy, Andre Vandoren, said the ransom was paid ``in
the classic way'' after negotiations between the family and the
abductors. He did not elaborate but said ``some elements occurred
abroad,'' raising speculation it was paid through a foreign bank,
possibly Swiss.
   Vanden Boeynants made no statement, but appeared briefly in the
window of his seventh floor apartment Tuesday morning and waved to
journalists. He was wearing sunglasses and had a scruffy beard.
   He agreed to receive one photographer, who described him as
looking tired, weak and thin.
   Vandoren said he learned of the ransom negotiations ``eight to 10
days ago'' but had only ``fragmentary information.''
   Police said Vanden Boeynants was kidnapped in the early evening
of Jan. 14 after parking his car in the garage of his apartment
building. His pipe, hearing aid and a shoe were found at the scene.
   A special parliamentary commission was to open a hearing three
days later into charges that he took bribes while defense minister
in the 1970s, but the hearing was postponed and the panel later
dismissed the charges as groundless.
   In 1986, Vanden Boeynants was convicted of tax fraud and forgery
as head of a Brussels meat-packing company. He was fined about
$17,000 and the sentencing judge called him an ``inveterate
swindler.''
   Soon after the kidnapping, a previously unknown group calling
itself the Socialist Revolutionary Brigade claimed responsibility in
telephone calls and letters to Brussels newspapers.
   It demanded ransom equivalent to $790,000, two-thirds to be
distributed to the needy through relief organizations.
   According to Vandoren, the kidnappers were common criminals with
no political motives. ``He was knocked down by two people and tied
up, then a third person helped carry him to a car,'' the deputy
prosecutor said of the abduction.
   Vanden Boeynants' ``dentention was not the most pleasant, but
(the kidnappers) were rather correct, although that is relative
term,'' he told the news conference.
   Vandoren did not say where the victim was held, but said he was
confined to one room, ``two or three people were always present''
and the room was dark much of the time.
   Officials said Vanden Boeynants told his abductors he had a heart
condition and necessary medication was provided from the third day
of captivity.
   Investigators discounted the possibility that Vanden Boeynants
faked the kidnapping. ``We maintain the theory that this was a real
abduction,'' Vandoren said.
   Prime Minister Wilfried Martens said the day after the
disappearance that Vanden Boeynants had received threats in the
preceding weeks, but he did not characterize them. The former
premier also was to have met with the interior minister the next
week, presumably to discuss his personal safety.
   Officials stayed ``largely'' out of the ransom negotiations, he
said, and ``took no risks because we feared for his life.''
   The ransom was paid at least 24 hours before the release,
Vandoren said. He denied a published report that the amount was
$2.55 million to $5.1 million.
   Rutten, the prosecutor, said his abductors blindfolded Vanden
Boeynants on Monday night and told him to wait two minutes before
finding his way home from Tournai. There were unconfirmed reports he
was held in France.
   Vanden Boeynants, a Christian Democrat, was prime minister from
1966 to 1968 and again briefly in 1978-1979. He was defense minister
for seven years in the 1970s and a Brussels city council member for
more than 30 years starting in 1953.
   The allegatons that he took bribes as defense minister, which the
parliamentary commission dismissed, arose in media reports.
   Controversy also touched his service on the Brussels council,
during which he oversaw an urban renewal program that was criticized
by conservationists.

   Johnson, 39, and Miss Griffith, 31, who were married previously

   No date has been announced. There were rumors a Valentine's Day
wedding was planned, but Mintz said it was untrue and speculated a

   A 13-year-old swiped a car and sped
off with a baby sleeping on the back seat, then dumped the infant on
the pavement 65 miles away, police said.
   The 15-month-old girl suffered a broken ankle and bruises on her
face.
   The teen-ager was arrested in Orlando around midnight Monday,
authorities said Tuesday.
   Investigators say the teen-ager, not identified because of his
age, apparently didn't realize little Ashley Barksdale was in the
car. The boy was a runaway from a nearby state facility.
   ``So far we have a charge of auto theft; but there might be
additional charges,'' said Lee Lerchen, police spokesman.
   Witnesses told police the baby was roughly pulled from the car
when she was dropped at a gas station, and probably suffered the
injuries then, Lerchen said.
   ``You look good; dirty, but good,'' the child's mother, Nellie
Barksdale, 34, of Davenport, whispered at the Polk City service
station when she got her baby back. ``I just wanted my baby back. I
don't care about the car. I got what I wanted back.''
   Mrs. Barksdale's car was taken while she was in a shop with her
sister, Alice Rico, looking for Valentine's Day gifts, Lerchen said.
   Mrs. Barksdale's 16-year-old daughter, Sarah, stayed in the car
to listen to the radio, but then joined her mother and aunt.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III announced today
that he is selling his controversial holdings in a New York bank and
all other publicly traded stocks that have been held in a blind
trust.
   Baker announced the decision through a spokeswoman while on a
tour of Western European capitals.
   His wife Susan is disposing of her stock as well. The trust, set
up when Baker went to work at the White House in 1981 as former
President Reagan's chief of staff, also will sell publicly traded
stock held by their daughter, Mary Bonner Baker.
   ``While I believe this decision goes well beyond what is required
or has been recommended, I think it is the correct decision for
someone committed in meeting the highest ethical standards,''
Baker's statement said.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Baker made the decision in
London on Saturday after consulting with his lawyers.
   The Washington Post, in a front-page article on Friday, said
White House counsel C. Boyden Gray had pressed Baker to divest
himself of substantial stock holdings in Chemical New York Corp., a
bank holding company that has $4.5 billion in loans to Third World
nations.
   On Friday, while r said he never sought the
waiver and decided instead to get rid of all his publicly owned
stock in the bank and other firms.
   Baker's latest financial disclosure form, filed with the Office
of Government Ethics, puts a value of more than $250,000 on the
assets held in the secretary's qualified blind trust.
   The form shows that the secretary received ``over $100,000'' in
income from the trust during the time that was covered, January
through August of 1988.
   Baker left the Treasury Department last summer help then-Vice
President Bush's campaign for the Oval Office.
   The disclosure form also lists the separate property of Mrs.
Baker, which includes 1,087 shares in Houston Industries, with a
valuation between $15,001 and $50,000.
   The stock listed assets of daughter Mary as including 5,310
shares of Chemical New York Corp., 196 shares of Exxon Corp. with a
value listed between $5,001 and $15,000; 144 share of Houston
Industries with a value listed between $1,001 and $5,000; and 330
shares in Trinity Petroleum Trust, with a value listed between
$5,001 and $15,000.
   The spokeswoman said State Department lawyers had offered Baker a
number of other options, which were not disclosed, but that Baker's
decision went further than any of them. She said the sales will be
completed after details are worked out.
   Baker's portfolio was not disclosed apart from Chemical New York
Corp., in which he acquired holdings after Chemical Bank took over
Texas Commerce Bancshares of Houston, a bank his grandfather helped
found, during Baker's tenure as treasury secretary.
   Baker, who had held news conferences daily since setting out on
his trip last Friday, did not meet with reporters traveling on his
Air Force jet today as he made his way from Bonn, West Germany, to
Ankara, Turkey, then to Athens, Greece, and finally to Rome. A
planned meeting here with Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti was
canceled because the Italian official was ill.
   A U.S. official said Baker received a list of recommended options
while flying to Ankara on Tuesday morning, but Baker ``basically
decided'' to sell his holdings on Saturday.
   The details of divestiture are complicated and must be worked out
with Baker's trustees, said the official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Asked if Baker stood to lose money by selling, the official said,
``I've never asked and I've never heard him mention it.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters in
Washington earlier today that the decision on Baker's stocks
``doesn't require a presidential review. The matter is being worked
out. There will not be a conflict of interest.''
   Fitzwater commented in response to a story in The Washington Post
today that members of two Senate committees were unaware that Baker
held large amounts of bank stock during the process of his
confirmation as treasury secretary four years ago.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman, asked about the
Post report, said, ``You know what the state of play is from the
secretary's own description most recently in Ottawa.'' He said he
had no information on whether Baker had decided to sell the stocks
or seek a waiver.
   While in office, Baker's holdings were in a qualified blind
trust. A trustee was in control of the stocks, but Baker was
informed annually of the general nature of the holdings.
   As treasury secretary, Baker developed the so-called Baker plan,
which called on Third World nations to make good on their debts as
they restructured their sagging economies. It also called for new
public and private lending, and did not seek to force the banks to
forgive the loans.
   The Post said it could reach spokesman for only two other members
of the two committees, John Heinz, R-Pa., and John C. Danforth,
R-Mo. It quoted both senators as saying through their spokesmen that
Baker's bank holdings would have made no difference on his
confirmation as Treasury secretary has they known about them.
   Although Baker had provided information to the Senate Finance
Committee in 1985 as an attachment to letter promising to recuse
himself from any decisions affecting his holdings, the information
was not circulated to the panel's members, the newspaper quoted
congressional aides and senators as saying.

<TEXT>
   Afghanistan's demoralized Marxist
government is given little chance of survival without Soviet
military forces to help it fight Moslem guerrillas, who already
control much of the countryside.
   Western diplomats, guerrilla leaders and others generally feel
the government in Kabul has a few months at most after Wednesday,
the deadline for Soviet withdrawal.
   Divisions within guerrilla ranks, however, could prolong a civil
war that already has ravaged the country for nearly 11 years. Some
insurgent commanders also say government forces may put up more
resistance than expected.
   President Najib insists his government won't be defeated and can
survive even though a Soviet force estimated at 115,000 soldiers
failed for nine years to overcome the guerrillas.
   Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to
help fight an insurgency that began after a communist coup in April
1978. The Red Army withdrew under an agreement mediated by the
United Nations.
   The seven main guerrilla groups, members of an alliance based in
Pakistan, are deeply divided and their leaders are locked in a
struggle for power. Guerrillas in the field have little discipline,
possess few heavy weapons and lack the kind of military experience
needed to assault and capture cities.
   Guerrilla leaders say they do not want to assault Kabul and other
cities because of the inevitable civilian casualties.
   Abdul Haq, a top commander, said up to 300,000 civilians could be
killed in an assault on Kabul, whose normal population has doubled
to about 2 million because of refugees.
   ``We're fighting to free this country,'' Haq said. ``We're not
fighting to kill our own people.''
   Some guerrilla leaders say arrangements have been made for the
cities to be surrendered with no resistance from the government, but
ranking field commanders say they are unaware of such plans.
   A system must be devised for soldiers to surrender with safety,
Haq said, because those who fear for their lives could be provoked
into fighting.
   ``They cannot resist for a long time, but if we make them fight
for survival they will fight,'' he said.
   Najib's army has about 30,000 men, most of them poorly trained
conscripts who do not support the government, according to Western
intelligence estimates. Army units usually perform poorly against
the insurgents.
   Also at the government's disposal, however, are more reliable
military units and other groups of loyalists who probably face
reprisals if the guerrillas win.
   Some insurgent commanders estimate the regime has up to 50,000
loyalists ready to fight, including secret service units, the army's
elite guard, paramilitary police and party members. Government
militia units composed of former guerrillas also would have little
choice but to fight, they said.
   ``These people would have no place in Afghanistan and there are
many among the people who want justice for what the communists have
done,'' said Masoud Khalili, a senior guerrilla official.
   Weapons and ammunition appear to be no problem for government
forces. The Soviets are leaving huge stockpiles behind.
   Tough or desperate government units in the cities could mount
sustained resistance in fortified positions capable of withstanding
guerrilla hit-and-run tactics.
   By contrast, some Western diplomats say an internal coup or power
struggle between rival Communist Party factions could topple Najib,
or senior army commanders might make a deal with the insurgents.

   An 11-year-old boy who spent as long as a
half-hour underwater in the icy Great Miami River died Tuesday, a
hospital spokesman said.
   Deon Jones of Dayton died of the ``overwhelming injuries due to
the near-drowning incident'' on Sunday, said David Lamb, spokesman
at Children's Medical Center.
   On Monday, Dr. William Spahn, director of the hospital's
intensive-care unit, said the boy had never regained consciousness,
was on a life-support system and that his chances for recovery were
small.
   Jones fell into the river after the ice on which he was
apparently playing broke. Rescue workers said Jones was in the river
for as long as 30 minutes.

<HEAD>Agency Announces Plan to Lower Honey Supports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department announced Tuesday a
proposal to lower 1989-crop honey supports by nearly 5 percent from
last year, part of a gradual decline specified by the 1985 farm law.
   Milton Hertz, executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., asked for public comments on the proposal,
which would reduce the basic honey support to 56.36 cents per pound
from 59.1 cents in 1988.
   Adjustments of the basic support can be made according to honey's
flower source, color, class, grade, location and other market
differentials.
   Details of the 1989 honey program were officially published
Monday in the government's Federal Register.
   Hertz also asked for comments on continuing the program's
``marketing loan'' provision, which allows producers to repay honey
price support loans at less than the original loan rate.
   In effect, this lets the producer ``sell'' honey to the
government and then buy it back for less. If loans aren't repaid,
producers forfeit the honey and the CCC adds it to surplus
stockpiles.
   The buy-back rates are set at levels low enough to minimize loan
forfeitures and to reduce CCC honey stocks and storage costs.
   Currently, for example, producers can buy back 1988-crop honey at
rates of 34 to 40 cents per pound, depending on quality. The CCC
loans originally were for 48 to 62 cents per pound.

   The desperate father of a university
student missing since she went for a walk last week is hoping Miami
Dolphin quarterback Don Marino and other NFL players can help find
his daughter.
   Marino promised at a news conference Tuesday to call on his
friends throughout the National Football League to get information
about Tiffany Sessions, 20, to the public.
   A toll-free number has been set up for information about the
disappearance and flyers with the young woman's photo were being
distributed nationally. Officials said several hundred phone calls
had come in already in response to efforts of the woman's father
since her disappearance Thursday.
   The father of the University of Florida student is Patrick
Sessions, president of the Weston division of Arvida, a national
real estate company based in Boca Raton.
   ``I'm not going to apologize that I have a lot of friends,''
Sessions said Tuesday. ``This is not a money effort, but a friend
effort.''
   ``We're more and more convinced there is a possibility that
Tiffany is out of the state,'' said Sessions. ``We haven't found
anything in Gainesville to indicate she is still there.''
   Also at the press conference was John Walsh, who has become a
spokesman for parents of missing children since the disappearance of
his 6-year-old son Adam from a Hollywood shopping mall in 1981. The
boy's severed head was found in a canal near Vero Beach about two
weeks later.
   ``We're trying to take the search for Tiffany national,'' said
Walsh, who added that many children have been found simply because
their picture was made available nationally.
   Miss Sessions was last seen Feb. 9 by her roommate before taking
an evening walk near her apartment in Gainesville. She had taken the
same walking route almost every evening for six months.

<HEAD>Angolan Rebels Say Cubans Still Fighting Despite Peace Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JAMBA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebel leader Jonas Savimbi said Tuesday that
Cuban soldiers are battling his guerrillas in southern Angola
despite a peace accord aimed at removing foreign troops from the
war-torn country.
   An estimated 600 Cuban soldiers and 4,500 Angolan government
troops are attempting to capture rebel-held positions in
south-central Angola near the border with Namibia, said officials of
Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   ``The Angolans and the Cubans are trying to take the border posts
by force, but they will not do so,'' Savimbi said in an interview at
his bush headquarters in southeastern Angola.
   Cuba last month began a phased withdrawal of its 50,000 soldiers
supporting Angola's Marxist government in a 13-year-old war against
rightist rebels.
   Cuba, Angola and South Africa signed a peace agreement in New
York in December calling for Cuba to withdraw all 50,000 troops by
July 1991. A total 3,000 troops are to leave by April 1, and all
remaining soldiers are to be moved at least 180 miles north of the
Namibian border by Aug. 1.
   South Africa has agreed to stop providing military assistance to
the rebels and is to grant independence this year to Namibia, also
known as South-West Africa.
   Savimbi and his insurgents were not involved in the peace talks,
and they have vowed to continue fighting to wrest a power-sharing
agreement with the government.
   Savimbi said he received substantial stockpiles of weapons,
gasoline and other military essentials before South Africa stopped
supplying aid.
   ``South Africa is gone, we are standing on our own, and we are
going to survive,'' said Savimbi.
   He refused to disclose the extent of his armory, but unconfirmed
reports say he has supplies to last two years. The United States
supports Savimbi, and President Bush has pledged to continue aid,
estimated at $15 million last year.
   The rebel leader denied an Angolan government claim that South
African forces entered southeastern Angola last week in defense of
the rebels. Pretoria has denied the charge, which it says places
``the spirit of the Cuban troop withdrawal process in jeopardy.''
   Savimbi said his movement's diplomatic position has improved
since the guerrilla movement formally cut ties with South Africa.
   He said several African leaders, including President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast, are attempting to arrange a
reconciliation between the Angolan government and rebels.
   Savimbi said he canceled an offensive begun last week so as not
to jeopardize Houphouet-Boigny's efforts.
   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and his government
refuse to negotiate with the rebels, although Savimbi says the
adversaries maintain low-level contacts in Europe.
   The rebel movement traditionally launches offensives in the
January-April rainy season, when the bush gives them more cover.
Government troops usually make a major push during the dry season
later in the year.
   But Wambu Chindondo, the rebel intelligence chief, said the
combined Angolan-Cuban forces began an offensive Feb. 2 aimed at
rebel strongholds near the southern towns of Caiundo and Ongiva.
   Chindondo said a force of 4,000 rebels armed with heavy artillery
and anti-aircraft weapons has withstood the charge.
   He claimed the guerrillas have killed 275 government troops and
eight Cubans and have lost 17 men in fighting in that area.
   Chindondo said the rebels remain active throughout the country
and last week temporarily cut electricity to the capital, Luanda,
when they blew up six electricity pylons.
   The rebels have suffered no major setbacks in recent weeks, he
said, noting the Angolan govenment has not claimed any big victories.

   Five of about 250 policemen involved in the operation were
injured, and three people were detained, according to Danish public

   Police were forced to retreat under a hail of stones at one point
and regroup, the witnesses said.
   Christiania has been occupied since 1971 by squatters, who

people usually live there at this time of year.
   It was the first time police had entered the area in force.

<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union have
agreed to work more closely in an effort to curb illegal salmon
fishing in international waters of the Pacific Ocean, the State
Department said Tuesday.
   Department officials said in a statement that negotiators from
the two countries had decided that illegal salmon fishing on the
high seas by other nations represented an ``irrational and wasteful
harvesting method and that all efforts should be taken to prevent
the unauthorized possession, harvest, transport and sale of salmon
in the North Pacific.''
   American fishing groups have contended that illegal catches by
foreign trawlers, sometimes under the guise of fishing for squid,
have already resulted in depleted salmon runs in the Pacific
Northwest and Alaska.
   Soviet and U.S. negotiators, meeting last week in Washington,
signed a memorandum of understanding in which the two countries
agreed to ``increase their bilateral cooperation in the field of
enforcing salmon conservation measures.''
   Under the agreement, the two countries will exchange information
on illegal salmon fishing gathered by patrol vessels and
surveillance aircraft in the North Pacific and any information on
the sale, purchase and transport of such fish.
   The two countries also agreed to work together on various
``enforcement issues,'' though the memorandum provided no specifics.
   In addition, they agreed to hold a symposium on Pacific salmon
biology in the Soviet Union.
   On other topics, the negotiators reviewed measures the two
countries might take to regulate pollock fishing in an area of the
Bering Sea known as the ``doughnut hole.''
   Both countries have previously expressed concern that expanded
fishing by foreign trawlers in the ``doughnut hole'' may be
depleting stocks within the two nations' 200-mile fishing zones.
   The U.S. Coast Guard and American fishing groups have also
contended that foreign trawlers use the ``doughnut hole'' for a
staging area to sneak into the 200-mile U.S. economic zone under
cover of darkness or bad weather to fish illegally.

   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of
Angola has removed his industry minister and the minister's deputy,
an Angolan report said Tuesday.
   The changes, made Monday, are the latest of a series of
replacements that dos Santos says are designed to bring more
professionalism to his Marxist government.
   Press reports, however, say that dos Santos has used the
reshuffle to consolidate power.
   The report by Angola's state news agency ANGOP did not name who
would replace Henrique de Carvalho Santos, the industry minister,
and his deputy, Adelino Galvao Branco.
   The agency said Armando Mateus Cadete, deputy foreign minister,
would soon be named his ministry's general secretary.
   Dos Santos also named a new minister and deputy minister of
sports and youth and three new ambassadors, ANGOP reported.

   The judge in the Oliver North trial today
rejected an agreement that would have allowed the Justice Department
to object at any time to defense disclosures of classified material.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell ruled that Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh may not file a series of affidavits in ``bits and
pieces'' during North's trial.
   Gesell said he was inclined to wait until the Supreme Court rules
on the Justice Department request for a stay of the trial. The full
court meets privately Friday. The department has sought to delay the
trial until appellate judges can review procedures to protect
national security.
   The agreement on how to handle the classified material was struck
over the weekend between Thornburgh and the independent counsel.
Gesell said it was not satisfactory.
   ``I find no basis for giving him (Thornburgh and the Justice
Department) a seat at counsel table or the right to intervene by way
of bits and pieces of affidavits whenever the going gets tough,''
said Gesell.
   He also said he would consider defense objections to an admission
proposed by the government that the Reagan administration gave third
countries ``quid quo pro'' inducements to help arm the Nicaraguan
rebels when U.S. assistance was banned by Congress.
   The judge said he ``had a sense that the quid may be
underplayed'' in the prosecution's proposed description of the
arrangements that the defense said were approved by President
Reagan, who ordered top officials to keep them secret.
   Gesell said he would convene a hearing on Wednesday to consider
defense proposals to change the statement about the third-country
contributions.
   In a filing today, North's lawyers said the inducement offered to
Central American nations ``in return for their military support for
the Resistance (Contras) was, in part, CIA covert support.''
   ``If the court requires prior notice of this covert support, it
will effectively require prior notice before any exploration of quid
pro quo arrangements that are central to this case,'' North's
lawyers said.
   Gesell already has thrown out the major charges against North
because of Justice Department objections to disclosure of certain
classified information.
   North attorney Brendan Sullivan is attempting to introduce
evidence about the Reagan administration's secret efforts to aid the
Contras in his defense of North, who is charged with covering up the
Iran-Contra affair by shredding evidence and lying to Congress.
   Sullivan said Monday that Reagan and other top administration
officials ``participated personally and directly in quid pro quo and
other arrangements with Central American and other third countries
as a means of obtaining military assistance'' for the Contras after
Congress banned U.S. aid.
   The officials also ``established a policy that those arrangements
would not be disclosed outside a limited group of Executive Branch
officials,'' Sullivan said in a court filing.
   Reagan lawyer Theodore Olson declined to comment on Sullivan's
assertions.
   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, whose office is prosecuting
North, said in a court filing that he is willing to agree at trial
to a ``candid admission ... with respect to quid pro quo
arrangements'' under which the Reagan administration steered favors
to nations aiding the Contras.
   But Sullivan said a proposed stipulation on the issue by Walsh
``is utterly inadequate'' because it doesn't acknowledge that Reagan
and other top officials participated in the arrangements and
disclosed them to no one outside a limited group of officials.
   ``At the heart of this case,'' said Sullivan, ``are the quid pro
quo and other third-country arrangements with which the Reagan
administration obtained military support for the Resistance during
the so-called Boland Amendments.'' That was the period from October
1984 to October 1986 when Congress banned military aid to the
Contras.
   Sullivan disclosed that Gesell addressed the possible relevance
of the information to North's case in a closed hearing last
Wednesday.
   According to Sullivan's filing, Gesell said it was possible that
``North was between a rock and a hard place. He's being told on the
top side not to tell anybody and he's being asked a lot of questions
about it on the bottom side.''
   ``And some of those instructions came from people who have
military authority over him as well as presidential authority over
him and I have ruled that he should be entitled to have the jury to
see the circumstances under which he acted.''
   The allegations concerning Reagan are part of the dispute over
the planned use of classified documents at North's trial, on which
Gesell is to hold a hearing today.
   The Justice Department wants more stringent limits placed on
classified material that North can use at trial, claiming that
national security could be hurt by public disclosures. North's
lawyers oppose the additional controls and say classified material
can prove North's innocence.
   Sullivan said the government wants to omit any reference to the
direct participation in third-country arrangements by Reagan, CIA
Director William Casey, national security adviser Robert McFarlane,
Secretary of State George Shultz, Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, John
Vessey.
   Reagan's involvement in third-country contributions for the
Contras was publicized in some detail in the 1987 Iran-Contra
hearings. But his alleged involvement in providing favors and in
covering up the arrangements is new.
   An instance of quid pro quo efforts involving North surfaced in
the Iran-Contra congressional hearings in 1987. North wanted
falsified documents from Central American countries to conceal
shipments going to the Contras.
   On March 5, 1985, he proposed that Guatemala be rewarded for its
assistance in providing false end-user certificates so that more
than 98,000 pounds of East European munitions could be made by
chartered aircraft from a European arms dealer to a Central American
country for the Contras.
   End-user certificates are documents certifying that the arms are
for the exclusive use of the country to which they are being sent.
The Contras could not issue such certificates because they were not
a recognized government.
   In a memo to then-National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane,
North suggested that the secretaries of state and defense and Vessey
be asked to grant Guatemala additional security assistance.
   The real purpose of the memo, said North, was to ``find a way by
which we can compensate'' Guatemala ``for the extraordinary
assistance they are providing to the Nicaraguan freedom fighters.''
   North said he was attaching ``end-user certificates'' which
Guatemala ``provided for the purchase of nearly $8M worth of
munitions to be delivered'' to the Contras.
   Sullivan also said he wants to cross-examine McFarlane about a
message he wrote on Nov. 8, 1986, saying: ``I hope to daylights that
someone has been purging .... files on this episode.''
   Sullivan said that under the government's proposed agreement on
the use of classified information, the use of this computer message
is now in doubt.
   North is charged, among other things, with shredding documents
that month to conceal the Iran-Contra affair.

   After years of printing official complaints about
rampant lawlessness in the West, a Soviet newspaper on Tuesday
published what it called shocking statistics showing a dramatic rise
in crime.
   The government daily Izvestia, publishing the kind of figures
that have been secret since 1933, said the overall rate of
registered crimes rose 3.8 percent last year and that the rate of
all crimes soared 17.8 percent.
   ``Probably the figures published in the newspaper would shock
many,'' Izvestia said. ``But it's better to know the true state of
affairs so that our safety _ and the police's concerns and problems
_ will become clear.''
   Some of the figures were released last month, but Tuesday's
report was the most detailed yet.
   The report, quoting the Interior Ministry, said 1,867,223 crimes
were registered last year, 68,700 more than in 1987. The country's
population is about 285 million.
   On the last page of Izvestia was a table that listed among the
most shocking statistics the number of premeditated murders. They
soared 14.1 percent, from 14,651 in 1987 to 16,710 last year.
   The higest increase among different categories of crimes was
registered in break-ins and holdups, which rose 44.4 percent, from
46,485 in 1987 to 67,114 last year. In 1988, 17,658 rapes were
reported, a rise of 5.3 percent over the 1987 level of 16,765.
   Some progress was reported in tackling economic crime. Izvestia
said there were 96,986 cases of misappropriation of government and
public property through embezzlement, theft and abuse of office in
1987. The number fell 9.8 percent in 1988, to 87,450.
   Economic crime is so widespread in the Soviet Union that many
Soviets believe a ``second economy'' that is based on a black market
is thriving.
   Interior Ministry official M. Yegorov told the Tass news agency
that speculators have been taking advantage of the shortages that
plague Soviet society. Twenty years ago, he said, only 17,000 cases
of speculation were reported. Izvestia said there were 45,235 of
speculation last year.
   Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin told the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda last month that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reforms have let loose not only more democracy but also thieves and
attackers.
   Under Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, officials and
the state-run media have detailed drug abuse, prostitution, murders
and other crimes. The Kremlin's long-running attempt to blame such
problems on the West and to claim that they had not crossed Soviet
borders has been largely abandoned. The media often has painted a
picture of the United States as a country where it was unsafe to
walk on the streets at night.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia,
Walter L. Cutler, has sent his resignation to Washington after six
months in the post, well-informed sources said Tuesday.
   Cutler, 57, arrived in August for his second posting in the
kingdom, replacing ambassador Hume Horan.
   The sources said on condition of anonymity that Cutler will leave
in late March. He will take over in April as head of Meridian House,
a nonprofit Washington-based group that deals with international
educational exchanges, according to Joseph John Jova, the current
head of Meridian House.
   Other sources said Cutler was prepared to assume duties at
Meridian House last year when he was asked by President Reagan to go
to Saudi Arabia. He went there with the understanding that his stay
in Riyadh would be brief, they said.
   No reason for Horan's abrupt departure last year was disclosed at
the time, but sources later said King Fahd asked the ambassador to
leave. They said Fahd was angry because Horan officially complained
to him about the kingdom's purchase of Chinese ballistic missiles,
an issue that the Riyadh government regards as an internal affair.
   Israel had complained that the deployment of such projectiles in
an Arab country could endanger its security.
   Cutler, a career diplomat since 1957, previously had served in
Saudi Arabia for three years, ending in July 1987. He also has
served as ambassador to Tunisia and Zaire.

   The son of former Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev said Tuesday the opportunity for improvement in
superpower relations is greater today than at any time since his
father's ouster in 1964.
   ``In the past, unity between peoples was considered science
fiction. But today, we see that as a real possibility,'' Sergei
Khrushchev said at a Harvard University news conference on his first
trip to the United States in 30 years.
   The 54-year-old, heavyset computer scientist came to the
university for a Soviet-American news conference on a six-year
Harvard study of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, which took the
superpowers to the brink of nuclear war.
   Khrushchev, whose father faced President Kennedy in the showdown,
praised two new books resulting from the study that call for the
United States and the Soviet Union to move away from military
confrontation and toward ``sustainable peaceful competition.''
   But he also stressed continuing misunderstandings, including what
he said was an inaccurate report that Fidel Castro asked his father
to launch a nuclear strike against the United States.
   ``It seems to me that the main thing is, we've come to understand
how poorly we actually understand each other, and those
misunderstandings have led to missteps even at the highest levels,''
said Khrushchev.
   In contrast to his father, a hot-tempered leader who once banged
his shoe in anger on a table at the United Nations, the younger
Khrushchev appears soft-spoken and urbane. Nikita Khrushchev,
premier from 1958 to 1964, died in 1971.
   In an attempt at levity, Khrushchev tried to tell a story about
his youth. But as if to prove his point about misunderstandings, the
story fell flat when a translator muffed the punch line.
   Khrushchev said a similar loss in translation may have led to the
reports that Castro requested a nuclear strike.
   Those reports originated at a conference in Moscow last month
that brought some of Nikita Khrushchev's advisers, former Kennedy
aides, Cuban officials and scholars together for the first time to
discuss the missile crisis.
   Some news reports said Sergei Khrushchev, who also took part in
that conference, had told other participants that on Oct. 26, 1962,
near the height of the missile crisis, Castro sought a preemptive
nuclear strike on the United States to forestall what he believed
was an imminent invasion of Cuba.
   Both Soviets and Americans at Tuesday's news conference denied
hearing him say such a thing at the conference. They included Sergo
Mikoyan, son of former Soviet Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan, who
said the reports had resulted either from a misunderstanding by an
American journalist or an ``absence of will to understand.''
   One of the Americans, David A. Welch, provided a possible
explanation. Welch, a research fellow at Harvard and co-author of
one of the new books, ``On the Brink: Soviets and Americans
Reexamine the Cuban Missile Crisis,'' said Castro almost certainly
asked on Oct. 26 that Soviet troops fire anti-aircraft missiles at
American military jets flying over Cuba.
   ``When someone said Castro asked Khrushchev to fire the missiles,
someone else may have thought he was talking about the nuclear
missiles,'' Welch said.
   Khrushchev's last visit to the United States was in 1959, when he
accompanied his father on a tour through Disneyland, Iowa cornfields
and Hollywood movie studios.
   Khrushchev, who holds a doctorate in computer science, lived in
relative obscurity for more than 20 years after his father lost
power. But he has recently attracted attention with the publication
of his diaries and is editing the Russian edition of his father's
memoirs, which have never been published in the Soviet Union.
   The memoirs were published in English under the title
``Khrushchev Remembers.''

   More than 180,000 bureaucrats of the Russian
republic have been shifted to other jobs in the past six months, the
official news agency Tass said Tuesday.
   The story didn't say where the staffers are now employed.
   The reductions are part of a move to decentralize the Soviet
economy, where bureaucrats have long determined everything from
prices to the number of nails sold in Moscow stores.
   Initial results of the plan were discussed at a meeting of the
presidium of the republic's Council of Ministers on Monday.

<TEXT>
   New HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, beginning a personal
tour of inner cities, visited poor Atlanta neighborhoods Tuesday and
said he wants to create ``dramatic incentives'' that will bring jobs
and housing to blighted urban areas.
   ``There is distress and despair in many of the areas of the
economy that have been left behind, and that's where I definitely
want to focus my attention,'' Kemp said.
   One day after being formally sworn in as secretary of housing and
urban development at a ceremony with President Bush, Kemp flew to
Atlanta for a two-day visit to poor neighborhoods.
   He said the trip was the first of a series of visits to major
cities ``to help find answers to the problems of homelessness,
housing and urban economic development.''
   Kemp met with the city's black, Democratic leaders, Mayor Andrew
Young and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., toured the museum honoring Martin
Luther King Jr., and scheduled a private dinner with the late civil
rights leader's widow, Coretta Scott King.
   Kemp received a warm welcome as he heard more than 20 community
leaders but was also told the needs are too great for private
efforts to work without government help.
   ``A lot of people have a lot of hope for you,'' said Millard
Fuller, a leader of the Habitat for Humanity group that builds homes
for low-income people without federal help. ``There's a lot of good
feeling for you. I hope you live up to the expectations.''
   Kemp's meetings were emblematic of the former congressman and
unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate's stated intention to
seek innovative solutions for inner-city problems regardless of the
source and of national Republican intentions to seek support among
blacks.
   ``This is an opportunity, after my swearing in yesterday, to come
to a city where lots of things are happening to help people get in
homes, jobs, shelter,'' Kemp said.
   Young led Kemp through a series of public housing projects and
other developments where private groups, some with and some without
government assistance, built homes and apartments for rental or
purchase by low-income people.
   His visit had the feel of a campaign day as he went from
neighborhood to neighborhood in a motorcade with police escort, with
one bus filled with the press and another with local officials and
supporters.
   Kemp visited the nation's first public housing project, Techwood,
built in 1936, as well as neighborhoods such as Cabbagetown, Bedford
Pine and Vine City where redevelopment projects are underway or
planned.
   Much of the housing was in good shape, newly constructed or
renovated. Kemp was not taken to Bankhead Courts, a public housing
project that has received widespread attention for its crime and
other problems, but Young said that the areas the secretary did
visit had problems that were ``identical.''
   ``We're not trying to hide the fact we have many, many housing
problems,'' Young said.
   He said that on Wednesday Kemp would meet with groups arranged by
Mrs. King and see other areas with worse problems.
   Kemp used the visit to repeat his pledge to seek the
establishment of urban enterprise zones that carry federal tax
incentives designed to attract businesses and jobs. Kemp said the
incentives could include breaks on capital gains for qualified
investments, with the tax breaks contingent on hiring people who
otherwise would be receiving welfare or other assistance.
   Some of the projects he visited were built through the local
equivalent of enterprise zones _ local abatements or forgiveness of
property taxes that encouraged development.
   ``We've got to do it at the federal level because only the
federal government can provide dramatic incentives,'' Kemp said.
   Kemp repeatedly referred to ``reincentivizing'' the economy
through such tax breaks, and said enterprise zones would
``greenline'' urban areas that have been hurt by ``redlining'' _ a
term for lending practices that deny capital for development to
certain areas.
   ``Areas that were at one time redlined for despair need to be
greenlined for success,'' Kemp said.

   Gunmen abducted and killed the powerful leader
of the nation's miners, police said Tuesday. His communist-led labor
movement blamed the government and called a national strike to
protest the slaying.
   Saul Cantoral, who led two crippling nationwide mining strikes
last year, and a woman companion were slain Monday night on a
deserted street in a Lima slum, police said.
   It was not known if Cantoral, secretary general of the
communist-led General Federation of Mine Workers, was slain by
Shining Path leftist rebels or a new paramilitary death squad, the
Rodrigo Franco Command.
   The Shining Path has been fighting for nine years to topple the
elected government of Peru and install Marxist rule. The government
says more than 12,000 people have died in the insurgency.
   The Rodrigo Franco Command, named after a government official
slain by the Shining Path, has vowed to kill leftist guerrillas and
their supporters.
   Police refused to provide details of Monday's slayings.
   The Lima newspaper La Republica said a note left at the scene
linked the attack to the Shining Path. But the Lima daily Expreso
reported that an anonymous caller claimed the anti-rebel Franco
group killed the unionist.
   The mine federation, which represents nearly all of Peru's 70,000
miners, called a news conference to announce a one-day strike on
Thursday and to demand a government investigation.
   Victor Cuadros, vice president of the miners' federation, blamed
the ``government and enemies of the working class'' for the attack.
   Cantoral last year led miners in a one-month nationwide strike in
July and a two-month strike that ended in December. Both strikes
were failed attempts at forcing the mining industry to negotiate
labor contracts jointly with all mine unions rather than on a
company-by-company basis.
   Owners of private mines charged during the strikes that miners
were being manipulated by the Shining Path.
   Officials said the strikes caused losses of $400 million, one
third of the Peru's yearly mining exports. Mining is Peru's most
important industry, accounting for about half its foreign exchange.
   The newspapers quoted police as saying Cantoral and the woman,
whose identity was not released, were seized by gunmen in a car and
brought to Canto Grande, a Lima slum.
   The 42-year-old labor leader was shot four times in the back and
once in the head, and the woman was run over and killed by a car
while apparently trying to escape, newspapers said.
   President Alan Garcia and Prime Minister Armando Villanueva
condemned the killing and vowed to track down the perpetrators.
   Government leaders have denied charges linking the new death
squad to government officials.

   A judge has agreed to try three former
ministers and the private secretary of deposed President Alfredo
Stroessner on charges of corruption, officials said Tuesday.
   The accusations stem from a lawsuit filed last week by Pedro
Abilio Rolon, an attorney with no known connection to the new
government.
   His suit calls for investigation of ``ill-gotten goods''
allegedly accumulated by the four defendants, including ``sumptuous
apartments on foreign beaches, luxurious mansions built on expensive
property ... planes, yachts and luxury cars.''
   In his complaint, Rolon alleged the four made fortures by
overcharging public works, selling Paraguayan identity papers and
state property for personal gain, extorting money from private
businesses, and other graft.
   A formal order for the arrest of the four was issued Monday by
criminal court judge Eladio Duarte Carballo. No date was announced
for the trial.
   Two of the accused _ former Health Minister Adan Godoy Jimenez
and private secretary Mario Abdo Benitez _ have been in custody
since shortly after the Feb. 3 coup that toppled Stroessner and
boosted Gen. Andres Rodriguez to power.
   Also named in the suit is former Interior Minister Sabino Augusto
Montanaro, who has taken shelter at the Honduras Embassy in
Asuncion; and former Labor and Justice Minister Jose Eugenio
Jacquet, who is believed to be out of the country.

   The Afghan government has sent a note to the
State Department protesting President Bush's decision to continue
providing aid to anti-communist rebels so long as the Soviet-backed
government remains in power, an Afghan diplomat said Tuesday.
   ``We think that this decision will just bring more bloodshed and
more war to our country,'' said the top Afghan envoy in Washington,
Miagol, in an interview with Associated Press Radio.
   ``We asked for the administration of Bush to change this decision
for peaceful solution of our conflict,'' said Miagol, who does not
use a second name. The envoy said that all involved ``in the Afghan
conflict have to sit down and they have to negotiate this matter.''
   Transport planes carried the last Soviet soldiers home from Kabul
on Tuesday, a day ahead of the deadline the Soviets agreed to last
spring for ending their military involvement in Afghanistan.
   The departure of the Soviets raised doubts about the ability of
the Afghan government to survive the challenge posed by the
U.S.-backed guerrillas.
   Bush decided last week to continue aiding the rebels even after
the Soviets completed their withdrawal, partly because of the large
amounts of military hardware the Soviets left behind.

   PLO chief Yasser Arafat met with Rep. Wayne
Owens, D-Utah, to discuss human rights and other issues in the
Israeli-occupied territories, congressional and Palestinian sources
said Tuesday.
   Owens, temporary chairman of the human rights subcommittee of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Arafat discussed peace efforts,
ways of establishing communications among all parties, and human
rights violations in a meeting Monday that lasted more than four
hours, the reports said.
   Art Kingdom, a spokesman in Owens' office in Washington, said the
congressman talked to Arafat about the concerns of members of
Congress regarding policies and actions of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   He said Owens told Arafat that relations between the U.S. and the
PLO depend on how such concerns are addressed.
   Their meeting was also reported by the official Palestinian news
agency WAFA.
   Owens plans to make another trip to Tunisia in March and may meet
with Arafat again, his office said.
   In its annual report on human rights practices around the world
issued last week, the U.S. State Department said Israel's response
to the Palestinian uprising led to a substantial increase in
human-rights violations in the territories last year.
   The U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, Robert Pelletreau, is the
officially designated U.S. contact with the PLO, which makes its

<TEXT>
   Seventy people convicted of drug smuggling,
three of them women, went to the gallows Tuesday in the largest
daily execution toll since Iran began a fierce anti-narcotics
campaign early in January.
   Also Tuesday, Intelligence Minister Mohammad Rey-Shahri announced
a ``heavy ruling'' was handed down against British businessman Roger
Cooper, who has been jailed on spying charges for more than three
years.
   Rey-Shahri did not elaborate on the ruling, saying only that
judicial authorities will pass final judgment later.
   The drug traffickers were hanged publicly in Tehran and 25 other
cities, with all 67 men executed publicly at dawn in a blinding
snowstorm. The women were executed inside Iranian prisons, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   Few people turned out to witness the executions, however, as the
snow cut communications and jammed traffic.
   The public spectacle is to underline the government's
determination to eliminate drug smuggling and cut supplies to 1
million addicts by official count and double that number according
to unofficial estimates.
   Nearly 200 men and women, identified by official media as
convicted drug smugglers, have been executed since early January.
   Fifty-six were executed in one day Jan. 16, a few days before a
new law mandated the death penalty for possession of even small
amounts of narcotics. An anti-narcotics task force of Revolutionary
Guards and Revolutionary CommiTtees, which have largely taken over
law enforcement, have rounded up more than 2,000 people in recent
weeks. The official news agency said 900 addicts and 290 pushers
were arrested in the past 24 hours alone.
   In addition, scores of heavily armed smugglers have been killed
in fierce gun battles with security forces in eastern provinces
bordering Afghanistan and Pakistan, the main smuggling routes, the
official media reports.
   It says security forces backed by helicopter gunships have seized
large quantities of heroin, opium, hashish and other narcotics.
   Tuesday's hangings were the first since executions were suspended
during Feb. 1-11 celebrations marking the 10th anniversary of the
Islamic revolution.
   ``This is the end of the line. If we do not destroy them, they
will destroy our youths,'' Prosecutor-General Musavi Khoeiniha
declared recently on Tehran Radio.
   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said officials are pressing
the Iranians for clarification on the statement about Cooper, the
52-year-old Briton who has lived and worked in Iran since 1958.
   ``We have no official communication on that report,'' the
spokesman said of Rey-Shahri's announcement.
   In comments reported by official media, Rey-Shahri said Cooper
had confessed to spying and had worked in key government centers in
the ministries of planning and budget, and foreign affairs, as well
as radio and television.
   Cooper's brother Paul said he heard rumors a trial was held,
including hints in his brother's letters.
   ``I have every confidence that the Iranians will ultimately treat
my brother fairly,'' he added, saying he hoped his brother would be
freed soon to be with their ailing 95-year-old mother.
   Cooper's jailing has been a source of tension in improving
British-Iranian relations, with British officials saying
developments depend in part on the resolution of the Cooper affair.
   Britain reopened its embassy in Tehran Dec. 9.
   It had withdrawn all its diplomats from Tehran and only one
Iranian envoy remained in London after a dispute which began when
British police arrested an Iranian envoy on shoplifting charges in
May 1987. Iranian Revolutionary Guards then kidnapped and assaulted
a British diplomat.
   Rey-Shahri made the remarks about Cooper while announcing that
2,600 political prisoners will be released under an amnesty marking
the revolution's anniversary.
   There had been hopes in London that Cooper would be released
under the amnesty.
   Rey-Shahri said 900 political prisoners will remain in jail.

<HEAD>Anti-Erosion Program Also Fighting Pollution, Report Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major program to take fragile cropland from
production is turning into an important tool for cleaning up the
nation's rural water, an Agriculture Department report said Tuesday.
   The Conservation Reserve Program was included in 1985 farm law as
a vehicle for taking 40 million to 45 million acres of highly
erodible land from crop production and planting it into protective
grass and trees for 10 years.
   More than 28 million acres have been enrolled, and Agriculture
Department officials say further signups will bring the 1990 target
within reach.
   Overall, the report said, the program ``may generate an estimated
$3.5 billion to $4 billion in water quality benefits'' through
reduced water treatment costs, lower sediment removal costs, less
damage to equipment that uses water, and increased recreational
fishing.
   Farming activities generate materials than can be carried into
waterways by runoff, and most agriculturally induced pollution is
``non-point source'' in which the specific source cannot be
identified.
   These farm-generated pollutants include nutrients from chemical
fertilizers and animal manure, primarily nitrogen and phosphorous;
pesticides, sediment, and dissolved minerals and salts, the report
said.
   ``Sediment washing off cropland and into waterways can fill
reservoirs, block navigation channels, interfere with conveyance
systems, harm aquatic plant life and degrade recreational
resources,'' the report said.
   Also, it said, pesticides and fertilizers are important to farm
production but these chemicals can harm plant and animal life. And
if they reach high enough concentrations in drinking water,
pesticides and fertilizer nitrates can be harmful to humans.
   ``Potential for the CRP to bring about a major reduction in the
discharge of agricultural pollutants into waterways is large,
because of the large acreage involved and because only highly
erodible land is eligible to be enrolled,'' the report said.
   The study, by the department's Economic Research Service, said
the estimate of $3.5 billion to $4 billion in water benefits was
based on an assumption that the full 45 million acres would be
signed into the program.

<HEAD>Bush Panel Wants To Keep Congress Exempt From Conflict Statute</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs after last graf pvs with additional recommendations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's ethics commission agreed
Tuesday that members of Congress should continue to be exempt from
the basic conflict of interest law that prohibits making government
decisions for personal gain.
   Although Bush charged the panel last month with finding standards
that are ``equitable all across the three branches of the federal
government,'' panel members concluded members of Congress could not
be put under the same constraints as judges and executive branch
employees.
   The members did, however, call for somewhat broader public
disclosure of the assets held by members of Congress so the public
could decide whether votes were cast or bills were introduced for
private reasons and turn any member who did that out of office at
the polls.
   The eight-member panel has until March 9 to recommend to Bush any
legislative or administrative changes to stiffen and standardize
federal ethics enforcement.
   The basic federal conflict law, known as section 208 of the
criminal code, makes it a crime for an executive branch employee to
take any government action in which he or his immediate family has a
financial interest. The top penalty is two years in prison and a
$10,000 fine. Judges are separately prohibited from hearing any case
involving any of their assets.
   Former Attorney General Griffin Bell told fellow panel members,
``This is the toughest thing we're going to have to deal with.''
   Former White House counsel Lloyd N. Cutler said, ``If you apply
208 to Congress, you get into impossible questions. What does a
farmer do on farm issues? What does any member do on tax
legislation? Everyone pays taxes.
   ``Maybe disclosure of the interest is all you can do.''
   Bell, the panel's vice chairman, agreed. ``I don't believe 208 is
workable for members. They'd have to divest all their holdings.''
   Panel chairman Malcolm R. Wilkey, a former appellate judge,
thought perhaps the law could apply to members of Congress when they
do casework for their constituents with specific federal agencies or
when they get into administrative matters as opposed to legislation.
But he found little support.
   The panel's only ex-congressman, former New Mexico Republican
Sen. Harrison Schmitt, appealed for some tougher action, at least
full disclosure, because ``we all know of abuses.''
   Judith Bello, general counsel to the U.S. Special Trade
Representative, said perhaps the law might apply when members are
negotiating for employment after they leave office.
   Eventually, the commission agreed that the law should apply to
the executive branch, the judiciary and the staff of Congress.
   Forcing members of Congress to meet executive branch disclosure
requirements would entail a minimal change.
   Members of Congress are now required to list whether assets fall
into these categories: $5,000 or less, $5,001 to $15,000, $15,001 to
$50,000, $50,001-$100,000, $100,001-$250,000, over $250,000.
   The executive branch has all those categories but the first one,
which is divided into less than $1,001 and $1,001-$5,000.
   In other action, the panel decided to recommend that members of
Congress file financial disclosure reports upon leaving office, as
executive branch employees and congressional staff employees already
do.
   The members also decided to recommend that divestiture of stock
holdings be made much more attractive as a way of remedying
potential conflicts.
   Currently, officials required to divest assets have to pay
capital gains taxes on the sales. The panel recommended allowing
officials to sell the assets and roll the proceeds into a government
bond or mutual fund and delaying capital gains taxes until the cash
was taken out of that approved investment for personal expenditures.

<HEAD>NATO's Galvin Urges Upgrading Short-Range Nuclear Missiles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CASTEAU, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Gen. John Galvin, NATO's supreme
military commander in Europe, said Tuesday the modernization of
short-range nuclear missiles would permit a major cut in nuclear
artillery.
   ``I would like to see our alliance rely primarily on missile
capability for the nuclear side of it in the future,'' he told
reporters at his headquarters south of Brussels.
   Galvin said he recently gave officials of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization a confidential report on the alliance's future
nuclear needs. It calls for ``a strong cut in artillery which would
be replaced by a dependence on missiles,'' he said.
   ``In order to do that,'' he said, ``I have to have some missiles
and that is the Lance, and the Lance today is very old.''
   He declined to say how many artillery rounds might be reduced
with the upgrading of the Lance. NATO has more than 4,000 nuclear
weapons based in its European arsenal. No breakdown is provided for
artillery.
   The upgrading of the Lance surface-to-surface missile has become
one of the most controversial issues in the 16-nation Western
alliance.
   Military analysts say the missile, introduced in 1972 with a
range of about 75 miles, will become obsolete in 1995. Most of the
700 missiles are deployed in West Germany and the remainder are in
Italy. A proposed replacement for them would have a range of 320
miles.
   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker discussed the sensitive issue
this week with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has said he
wants to delay a final decision on deployment of the new generation
Lance until 1991 or 1992.
   The United States wants a firm commitment from the allies, on
whose soil the weapon would be deployed, before it presses Congress
for money to produce the missile. It has hoped for a strong signal
this spring.
   Galvin said Congress needs to consider this year whether to
provide money to develop a model of the new Lance for test purposes.
   ``If this has to be complete in the middle of the 1990s, then it
needs to start now ... 4{ years is not very much time,'' he said.
   Galvin said the failure to upgrade the weapon would force the
alliance ``to restudy our ability to carry out the current
strategy.''
   The issue of upgrading short-range nuclear arms has gained
prominence since former President Reagan and Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev signed in December 1987 the Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces treaty. It provides for eliminating all U.S. and
Soviet land-based missiles with ranges of about 300 to 3,400 miles.
   Strong anti-nuclear movements in Germany, the Netherlands and
Belgium have opposed plans to modernize and extend the range of the
Lance missile.
   Galvin said he would prefer that East-West negotiations on
reducing conventional forces in Europe be finished before
discussions begin on short-range nuclear arms. NATO and the seven
Warsaw Pact nations are to begin conventional force talks in early
March in Vienna.
   The NATO allies contend they need their nuclear arsenal as a
deterrent, countering the huge superiority the Warsaw Pact maintains
in conventional, or non-nuclear, arms.
   Kohl said Monday that Germany wants a disarmament mandate built
into NATO strategy so that deployment plans would be stopped if
progress is made on cutting the East's conventional arms.

<TEXT>
   Francis Bible Schulte on Tuesday became the
12th archbishop of New Orleans, the nation's second-oldest Roman
Catholic archdiocese.
   ``Who are the defenseless, the vulnerable?'' Schulte asked in a
homily prepared for the occasion. ``The most vulnerable of all are
those babies who are about to be aborted and gasping for life with
the final silent scream; the battered, abused and addicted women and
men; the unemployed, all too numerous in our state today; the gunned
down and the blown-up.
   ``Who are the vulnerable? All of us who live a fragile peace
under the threat of nuclear destruction, while we know that there
can be no true peace without justice.''
   Seventy-five bishops and archbishops attended the installation of
Schulte in the St. Louis Cathedral in the French Quarter. Prayers
were offered in French, English and Spanish.
   Schulte's homily was rich with praise for his predecessor, Philip
Hannan, who retired at age 75 after 24 years as head of the
archdiocese. He noted Hannan's work on behalf of the poor and his
dedication to Catholic schools, and he called Hannan ``a model of
religious dedication and civic responsibility.''
   Archbishop Pio Laghi, the Vatican's ambassador or pro-nuncio to
the United States, installed Schulte.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer was among state and local officials attending
the ceremony. Also attending were five American cardinals: John Krol
of Philadelphia, John O'Connor of New York, James Hickey of
Washington, Bernard Law of Boston and Edmund Szoka of Detroit.
   Schulte, 61, a native of Philadelphia, has been bishop of the
Wheeling-Charleston diocese in West Virginia since 1985. As
archbishop he will serve the Archdiocese of New Orleans as well as
six other Louisiana dioceses, all of which have a total of 1.4
million Roman Catholics. The oldest Roman Catholic Archdiocese is
that of Baltimore.
   He was named to succeed Hannan in December, after Hannan reached
the mandatory retirement age of 75 in May.

<HEAD>President Aquino Going To Japan Despite Coup Rumors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By YASMIN ARQUIZA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said Tuesday
she will proceed with scheduled visits to Japan and to a military
academy in the north, despite rumors that right-wing groups would
attempt a coup while she was out of the capital.
   She also remained firm in her refusal to let ailing former
President Ferdinand Marcos return from exile in Hawaii, citing
security reasons.
   The chief executive announced her decisions after a nearly
three-hour meeting Tuesday with the Cabinet crisis committee.
   She said they discussed security measures for her trip this
weekend to the Philippine Military Academy, where she is to address
the graduating class, and her visit to Japan next week to attend the
funeral of Emperor Hirohito.
   ``The committee agreed my presence at these two events would be
advantageous to our country,'' Mrs. Aquino said in a statement.
   Military officials said only members of the presidential security
force would be allowed to carry weapons on the academy campus in
Baguio City, about 150 miles north of Manila, during the festivities
from Friday to Sunday.
   Banners will be banned on graduation day Sunday. Last year
graduates waved banners reading ``We belong,'' the slogan of the
Reform the Armed Forces Movement which has figured in unsuccessful
attempts to unseat Mrs. Aquino.
   Two years ago, a bomb exploded at the academy grandstand a few
days before Mrs. Aquino was to address graduating cadets, killing
four people. She said the bomb was meant for her.
   Reports of a new coup plot surfaced last week, but military chief
Gen. Renato de Villa said his command received no such information.
But he said former Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan and two other renegade
officers linked to previous coup attempts had held a secret meeting,
apparently to join forces.
   Honasan led an August 1987 coup attempt, which killed 53 people
and wounded hundreds.
   Mrs. Aquino leaves for Japan on Feb. 23, but she is expected to
be back in time for the third anniversary of the Feb. 25
civilian-military uprising that drove Marcos into exile and brought
her to power.
   She said: ``With regard to ex-President Ferdinand Marcos, my
position remains the same. Considerations of the highest national
good dictate that we preserve the substantial economic and political
gains of the past three years.
   ``My duty is paramount: to preserve democracy and its
institutions. I must therefore decline the wishes of some people
that Mr. Marcos be allowed to return to the Philippines.''
   Marcos' only son, Ferdinand Jr., and Vice President Salvador
Laurel were among those who appealed to her to heed Marcos' request
to come home.
   Marcos, 71, was reported in guarded condition at the St. Francis
Medical Center in Honolulu after suffering a relapse of pneumonia.
   Marcos is under U.S. indictment with his wife Imelda, accused of
stealing more than $100 million from his homeland and stashing much
of the money in the United States.
   On Tuesday, Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez brushed aside
reports of negotiations for Marcos' return, saying Marcos first had
to resolve criminal charges pending against him in the United States.
   A presidential commission has been charged with recovering up to
$10 billion that the Aquino government claims Marcos, his family and
associates plundered from the country during his 20-year rule.
Marcos faces 39 civil suits in Manila, but no criminal charges have
been filed.

<TEXT>
   Families and friends of the American hostages
in Lebanon remembered their loved ones on Valentine's Day at a
ceremony Tuesday to display a huge heart-shaped card bearing the
captives' names.
   ``We hope the Bush administration will put the hostages in the
forefront and keep them there until they are released,'' said Thomas
Cicippio of Norristown, Pa. His brother, Joseph Cicippio, is one of
the nine Americans held captive.
   The eight-foot card was put on display at the Washington
Convention Center where people are free to sign it. After several
days, it will be taken to the Lebanese Embassy to be held until the
hostages are released.
   While no one has any firm word about the nine Americans in
Lebanon, David Reed of Spring Grove, Pa., nephew of hostage Frank
Reed, said there were signs ``indicating a great deal of quiet
diplomacy'' on the issue.
   ``Our hope is that there is some movement,'' he said. Based on
his conversations with officials at the State Department and the
United Nations, Reed said, ``our sense is that the captors don't
want to talk.''
   The American hostages are thought to be held by pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslems, specifically groups under the umbrella Hezbollah
organization.
   Joseph Sayah, deputy ambassador at the Lebanese Embassy, said
there were ``a lot of negotiations talking place between the U.S.
side and the others,'' but he would not elaborate on any specifics.
   ``I hope something will be done so we can put an end to this
ordeal,'' he said.
   The ceremony with the card was arranged by No Greater Love, a
humanitanian organization which has spotlighted the plight of the
hostages and their families.
   ``While we realize this greeting will not directly bring the
hostages home, it does let their families know that many, many
Americans still care,'' said Carmella LaSpada, the group's head.
   The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, a correspondent for
The Associated Press, whose fourth anniversary in captivity is next
month.
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, did not attend the ceremony because
she has extended her stay in Damascus, Syria, awaiting word of her
brother.
   Others at the ceremony were Steve Hagey, a reporter for The
Baltimore Sun, representing the Journalists Committee to Free Terry
Anderson; John Holger, director of the U.N. information office, and
retired Army Col. Leland Holland, a former hostage at the American
Embassy in Tehran.

<HEAD>Minneapolis Fire Department Has Drug Problem, Chief Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Fire Department has a ``significant
problem with chemical use and abuse'' and some firefighters have
reportedly battled blazes while under the influence of drugs, the
fire chief said.
   At least 20 of the city's 450 firefighters are using cocaine and
30 others are alcoholics, Fire Chief Tom Dickenson said Monday. His
remarks were prompted by the weekend arrest of a veteran firefighter
on cocaine charges.
   The chief said his figures are based on experiences with
disciplinary actions and complaints he's had from firefighters, as
well as the arrested man's statements to police. He added that he
had also heard reports of firefighters fighting fires while under
the influence.
   The president of the firefighters' union and a city drug
dependency coordinator said they don't believe there is a major drug
problem in the department. However, neither had any estimate of how
many cocaine users there were.
   Minneapolis Firefighters Union President Dick Will said Monday he
didn't know the source of Dickinson's chemical abuse figures and
that the union was unaware of firefighters under the influence while
on the job. He blamed the city for failing to develop an acceptable
drug policy.
   Dickinson said the city has been unable to negotiate a
drug-testing policy with the union that would allow testing when
there are ``reasonable suspicions.''
   ``We are not against a reasonable form of drug testing,'' said
Will. ``And we certainly don't condone anyone showing up for work
under the influence of any controlled substance.''
   He said the city is unwilling to define ``reasonable suspicion.''
   Ken Voltin, an alcohol and drug dependency coordinator for the
city, said it would be hard to determine if there are 20 cocaine
users in the department. ``I don't believe there is a major cocaine
problem,'' he said.
   A 45-year-old firefighter was arrested Friday on a felony charge
of selling 2.2 grams of cocaine for $40 to an undercover St. Paul
police officer in a bar.
   ``We have information that there are other firefighters that are
involved in drugs,'' said Sgt. Phil Van Tassel, administrative
assistant to Minneapolis Police Chief John Laux.
   Dickinson said the arrested firefighter told police lots of
firefighters used cocaine. Asked if there were more than 20, the
firefighter said yes, the chief said. Van Tassel confirmed the
remarks.
   Twenty cocaine users would represent a conservative figure, said
Dickinson.
   Steven Fredrickson, an assistant city attorney, said Minneapolis
has reached agreement with about 12 unions on the drug testing
issue, but not with firefighters.
   ``We have taken the position that the testing should be based on
reasonable suspicion of drug usage,'' said Fredrickson. ``The union
has asked that it be based on probable cause, which is a higher
standard.''

<HEAD>Police Say Body May Be Victim of Mandela Bodyguards</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police said Tuesday a
decomposed body found early last month may be that of a 14-year-old
boy allegedly abducted and beaten by young men acting as Winnie
Mandela's bodyguards.
   Maj.-Gen. Jaap Joubert, who leads the investigation of
allegations surrounding the Mandela United soccer team, said the
body found Jan. 7 could not be identified. Team members live at the
Soweto home of Mrs. Mandela's, wife of imprisoned African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
   Joubert said the mother of the missing boy, Stompie Mokhetsi
Sepei, recognized bits of clothing and shoes as possibly belonging
to her son.
   Joubert said forensic and fingerprint experts would make further
tests. He said the exact cause of death was not determined, but the
boy appeared to have been stabbed twice in the neck.
   The body was found in a field in Soweto, the huge black township
outside Johannesburg, after an anonymous telephone call to police
Jan. 6. Because of publicity about the disappearance, detectives
were summoned to the morgue Tuesday to determine whether the body
found last month was the missing 14-year-old, police said.
   Earlier Tuesday, a Johannesburg newspaper quoted a witness it did
not identify as saying a young man living at Mrs. Mandela's home had
been hacked to death in Soweto on Monday.
   Police said they were investigating whether a young man found
dead of stab wounds Tuesday morning was one of the Mandela United
soccer club members who act as unofficial bodyguards for Mrs.
Mandela.
   The Star newspaper of Johannesburg said the dead man was Maxwell
Madondo, 19, who was staying at Mrs. Mandela's house. The paper
quoted another young man, unidentified, who said he witnessed the
attack and identified the body.
   It quoted him as saying he saw a crowd of youths attack Madondo
with pick handles, drag his body into a house and stone him. The
youth said he then fled the scene, The Star reported.
   Allegations were made a week ago that members of the soccer club,
who seldom play soccer, abducted three black men and the 14-year-old
last month.
   Their lawyer said the three men have made statements saying Mrs.
Mandela was involved in the events on the night they were allegedly
abducted, taken to her home and beaten by members of the soccer
club. The boy, who led a gang of children during the unrest of
1984-87, has been missing since the abduction.
   Mrs. Mandela has denied being present and has said the soccer
club members took the four from a Methodist Church residence to
protect them from sexual abuse. Community and church committees
investigated that explanation and declared it false.
   Police said several newspapers received anonymous telephone calls
Monday night saying a member of the soccer club had been killed. A
body of a young man was found Tuesday morning in the Orlando West
section of Soweto, Mrs. Mandela's neighborhood, a post-mortem was
scheduled for Wednesday, they said.
   A spokesman said the body was not identified, and police could
not confirm the man was a member of the soccer club.
   Mrs. Mandela had planned to fly to Cape Town on Tuesday to visit
her husband on a prison farm, but delayed the trip until Wednesday,
her office said.

   Prominent playwright Vaclav Havel will be
tried separately from eight other activists arrested with him last
month during a rally in Prague, an emigre publication said Tuesday.
   The trial of the eight civil rights and peace activists, arrested
at the peaceful protest on Jan. 16, will start Feb. 21 in Prague,
said Palach Press, a London-based newsletter monitoring events in
Czechoslovakia.
   Havel is to be tried separately starting the same day at a
district court in the capital, a relative said in a telephone
interview from Prague.
   Six of the eight were freed pending trial, it said.
   The 52-year-old playwright is in custody, charged with sedition
and obstructing public officials. The more serious charge of
sedition can carry a penalty of up to two years in prison.
   The nine were detained after trying to lay flowers in memory of
Jan Palach, a student who burned himself alive 20 years ago. He was
protesting the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia, which
crushed the country's liberal reforms.

   The Bush administration, saying its 1990 budget
speaks for itself, declined Tuesday to provide additional details on
spending cuts and insisted they be shaped through negotiations with
Congress.
   ``This budget is alive and is an active force subject to change
in negotiation and discussion,'' presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters.
   He said the administration would have no separate proposal for
filling a spending gap estimated at $9.6 billion to $11 billion to
help pay for expanded social programs Bush advocated in his $1.16
trillion spending plan.
   ``We'll be providing details as we go along. ... Everybody knows
cuts have to be made,'' Fitzwater said.
   Congressional Democrats have complained that Bush's budget allows
him to claim credit for proposing more spending on social programs,
such as those affecting the homeless, child care and education,
while making sure Congress shares responsibility for coming up with
unpopular cuts in other programs.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, and Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., the budget
committee chairman, told Bush in a letter Tuesday that if he failed
to provide more detail, Congress would ``have no alternative'' but
to assume he endorses the program cuts proposed last month by
then-President Reagan.
   Bush budget director Richard G. Darman, White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu and congressional budget leaders met Tuesday
afternoon. Sununu was coy with reporters regarding how much new
information he would provide the Congress before leaders agreed to
full-scale negotiations.
   ``It's not a question as to whether the detail is available, it's
a question of whether you do it a step at a time,'' Sununu said.
   Darman said after the two-hour meeting that the administration
was making ``an extraordinary effort,'' and Sununu's presence
signified Bush's stake in the process.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said the White House appeared cooperative and he hoped
the administration would, in meetings scheduled for later this week,
provide Congress with more information.
   He said he was sympathetic that the administration needed time,
but said the information had to come before any negotiations on how
the fiscal 1990 budget should be drafted.
   ``You can't negotiate when most of the lines are blank,'' he said.
   Bush plans to travel around the country to build public support
for his budget plan.
   He travels to Columbia, S.C., on Wednesday to highlight the
budget measure in an appearance before the state legislature. Bush
spoke Monday to business and civic leaders in Manchester, N.H.
   Fitzwater denied Bush's budget road show was an effort to make an
end-run around Congress, as Reagan had done in building public
support for some of his initiatives.
   Instead, the spokesman said, the trips were just ``an opportunity
for the president to discuss his priorities'' and an attempt to
stress his intention ``to work with Congress.''
   Bush's budget, which he unveiled Thursday in his first major
policy speech before Congress, called for expanded spending to cover
a host of campaign promises.
   Other than calling for freezing military spending at the level of
inflation, the spending outline was vague on where other specific
areas of spending would be restrained to meet deficit targets.
   The president generally called for freezing most domestic
programs at 1989 levels. However, that would leave a $9.6 billion to
$11 billion financing gap in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 if
the programs are merely allowed to keep pace with inflation and
population growth.
   Thus, specific cuts must be worked out.
   Fitzwater said, however, that the administration has no plans to
amend or expand upon the budget it proposed last week, indicating
that any changes must be the product of bargaining with Congress.
   ``The numbers speak for themselves,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
``Nothing is final and we'll be negotiating all of these programs.''
   The budget has already stirred controversy in the
Democratic-controlled Congress, both for its lack of specifics on
spending cuts and for its advocacy of a cut in the capital gains tax
rate _ a tax break Democratic leaders have suggested would benefit
mainly the rich.
   Still, Fitzwater said that ``we don't want the budget to be
confrontational'' and that the administration would retain ``an open
mind'' on spending cuts.

<TEXT>
   A small group of Bulgarians has formed the
communist nation's first independent trade union _ for artists and
intellectuals _ and applied for official status, emigre sources in
the West reported.
   Documents for official registration of the union, bearing the
names of seven founding members, were delivered to authorities
Saturday, said Eduard Genov, an exiled Bulgarian dissident now
living in the United States.
   Genov, reached by telephone from Vienna on Monday, said Diana
Boyagshieva was the group's spokeswoman and some of the members also
belonged to the independent Association for the Defense of Human
Rights. He said the union would be based in Plovdiv, an industrial
town.
   The human rights group, to which Genov belonged before he was
exiled last year, has been suppressed and several members have been
subject to arrest.
   A Bulgarian exile source in Vienna confirmed that intellectuals
were seeking official permission for the union and apparently were
not trying to enroll blue-collar members.
   The West German radio Deutsche Welle said Tuesday the union was
named Podkrepa, or Support.
   It said the group's purpose was to oppose ``arbitrariness and
encroachments by unscrupulous colleagues, firms and state
enterprises.''
   The station quoted an informant, who was not identified, as
saying the union qualified for legal status under Article 52 of
Bulgaria's constitution, which deals with the right of association.

   Hughes Aircraft Co. will ship its
rebuilt $157 million Galileo space probe to NASA on Wednesday so a
space shuttle can launch the probe and a mother ship toward Jupiter
in October.
   The $1.36 billion, six-year, 2.4-billion-mile voyage was delayed
3{ years by the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger.
   ``This is a very proud day for us. We are ready to deliver it to
JPL (NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory) on its way to Jupiter,''
Hughes vice president Steven Dorfman said at a news conference
Tuesday.
   Hughes spokesman Richard Dore said the 4-foot-diameter,
teardrop-shaped probe would be trucked Wednesday across the Los
Angeles area to Pasadena, where JPL runs America's unmanned space
exploration program for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   Engineers will prepare the probe for shipment to the Kennedy
Space Center in April, followed the next month by the mother ship,
or Galileo orbiter. After the two are attached, the combined
spacecraft will be mounted on a solid fuel booster rocket and placed
aboard the shuttle Atlantis.
   The launch is expected to take place between Oct. 12 and about
Nov. 21.
   After exploring two asteroids, the orbiter and probe will reach
Jupiter in December 1995, after separating 150 days earlier. The
probe will enter Jupiter's atmosphere at 115,000 mph, then deploy a
parachute as it falls about 370 miles through the planet's
atmosphere.
   The probe will collect and relay information for up to 75 minutes
before it is crushed by Jupiter's tremendous atmospheric pressure.
   The orbiter will circle Jupiter for at least 20 months, studying
the planet and its surrounding moons, magnetic field and
electrically charged particles.
   The data will help scientists better understand the origin of
Jupiter, the solar system and the universe, said Richard Young,
Galileo probe project scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in
Mountain View.
   Galileo had been scheduled to be launched from a space shuttle in
May 1986 and powered out of orbit atop a Centaur booster for a
three-year trip to Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet and
the fifth from the sun.
   Then Challenger blew up on Jan. 28, 1986, killing seven crew
members and grounding the shuttle fleet until last fall. After the
tragedy, NASA decided it was too dangerous to carry liquid-fueled
Centaurs aboard the shuttle.
   Galileo's route to Jupiter was drastically redesigned and
lengthened because Earth and Jupiter are no longer aligned as
ideally as they were in 1986 and because the new booster is less
powerful.
   Because of the launch delay and the longer flight time, the probe
was taken apart for refurbishing and to make sure some parts
wouldn't fail because of aging, and its scientific instruments were
retested.
   On the new flight plan, Galileo will take six years instead of
three years to get to the gaseous, giant planet, traveling 2.4
billion miles although Jupiter is about 400 million miles from
Earth, Dore said. To gain energy for the trip, Galileo will use the
gravity of Venus and Earth in a slingshot effect.
   Galileo will swing toward Venus in February 1990, swing back
toward Earth that December, circle the sun, and swing around Earth
again in December 1992 before finally heading for Jupiter.
   The delay increased the probe's cost to $157 million from $133
million, said Benny Chin, Galileo probe project manager at
NASA-Ames. Total cost of the mission, from its official start in
1977 through completion in late 1997 is about $1.36 billion, said
Richard Spehalski, Galileo project manager at JPL.
   Spehalski said White House approval for the launch is expected in
September. Such approval is needed because the probe and orbiter
each carry a power plant and heater containing radioactive
plutonium. A NASA environmental impact statement concluded last
month that the risk of a nuclear accident when the shuttle lifts off
with Galileo is very small.

<HEAD>Safety Board Blames Sleeping Crew, Work Rules in Train Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators on Tuesday blamed work
arrangements that deprived a train crew of sleep for the head-on
collision of two Conrail freight trains in Pennsylvania that killed
both trains' engineers and brakemen a year ago.
   The National Transportation Safety Board recommended that
Consolidated Rail Corp. and other railroads look for ways to change
work cycles that put crewmen on trains without adequate sleep.
   The board said the Jan. 14, 1988, collision at Thompsontown
occurred because the engineer and brakeman of a 105-car coal train
were asleep. It was made worse, the board said, because the engineer
of the other train did not slow down quickly enough and a
computer-based traffic control system was not working properly.
Damage in the crash was estimated at $6 million.
   The report said none of the men on the coal train, which was en
route from Baltimore to Altoona, Pa., had had more than two hours
sleep in the previous 22 to 24 hours, and they had not eaten in over
13 hours. The men had reported for work at 11:30 p.m. and the crash
was at 7:45 a.m. the next day.
   Conrail spokeswoman Pat Linsky said the company could not comment
in detail until officials had reviewed the board report. But the
railroad issued a statement saying that the engineer and brakeman on
the coal train had signed off their previous runs 37.5 hours earlier
and the conductor 50 hours before boarding the Baltimore-Altoona
train.
   ``The probable cause of this accident was the sleep-deprived
condition of the engineer and other crewmembers of train UBT-506,
which resulted in their inability to stay awake and alert,'' the
board said. It said the engineer did not attempt to stop the train
after warning signals went off and suggested he may have pushed a
pedal in his sleep that acknowledged the warning but deactivated
automatic braking of the train.
   Drug tests on the four dead crewmen and two conductors who
survived the crash were negative for use of alcohol or illicit
drugs, except for a minuscule indication of marijuana in one
conductor's urine.
   The board said the railroad industry has long had unpredictable
work schedules but the problem has worsened with the elimination of
many regularly scheduled freight and passenger trains, a cutback in
yard operations, agreements protecting employee seniority, longer
freight runs and relocations of work assignments.

   The government expressed cautious optimism
Tuesday about talks in their second week with Solidarity, but it
warned the banned independent union to ``stop pressing us against
the wall.''
   A spokesman for the union, responding to the statement by
government spokesman Jerzy Urban, denied Solidarity had such
intentions.
   ``We want to reform the country, and if this requires the
government's withdrawal from its hitherto policy, that's something
else,'' said Janusz Onyszkiewicz, Solidarity spokesman.
   The exchange came as Solidarity leader Lech Walesa traveled to
Jastrzebie in the coal-mining region of Silesia, his second campaign
swing in five days to seek rank-and-file backing for the
negotiations.
   Talks continued in Warsaw as part of the broad series of ``round
table'' negotiations, aimed at reinstating Solidarity's legal
status, bringing about opposition participation in Parliament and
forming a broad social agreement on economic and political reforms.
   Two teams meeting Tuesday discussed environmental protection and
an opposition proposal for a nationwide system of indexing wages to
inflation.
   Urban, at his weekly news conference, said Solidarity's proposal
that the military and police budgets be cut by 20 percent is an
example of pressuring.
   Urban characterized the proposal as ``political'' and irrelevant
to a discussion on improving the economy.
   ``Stop pressing us against the wall,'' he said. ``We are putting
forward a program of changes which are already so deep and brave .
.. that a general pressing of us may turn into adventurism
destroying the chance for agreement.'' Even so, Urban said he could
express ``cautious optimism'' about the talks. ``Please do not
interpret my remarks as negative ones,'' he said.
   But Onyszkiewicz said the tone of Urban's comments was
unexpected. ``I am a bit surprised that Minister Urban presented it
in such a drastic way. ... Such a reaction seems completely
unjustified.''
   Solidarity's National Executive Commission, with about 20
members, also convened Tuesday and issued a statement in Warsaw
urging a ``decrease of social tensions'' for the next six weeks
while talks with the goverment continue.
   The panel suggested a freeze on prices during the six weeks and
said that managers discuss any ``wage decisions'' in advance with
Solidarity and other trade unions.
   In southern Poland, Walesa stressed to miners the importance of
the talks.
   ``We must agree. ... We have to use all our wisdom and strength
to make something out of Poland,'' he said. ``We have no choice.''
   Walesa addressed 500 miners at a social club in front of the
Manifest Lipcowy mine, where a nationwide wave of strikes began last
August, prompting the government to propose the talks.
   ``Nobody is going to build Poland for us as a present,'' Walesa
said. But referring to the government, he added: ``We were badly
led. This system has led to absurdities.''
   Walesa received an enthusiastic welcome at the club filled with
Solidarity songs and banners. It appeared to be the warmest meeting
so far during his travels to brief followers on the talks.
   After attending Mass with more than 2,000 people at a church,
Walesa held an hour-long meeting with Silesia Solidarity activists
in the church basement.

   The crash last November of a new B-1B bomber in
Texas was caused by a fire in the left wing that knocked out two of
the plane's four engines and burned out critical control equipment,
the Air Force said Tuesday.
   The fire apparently was fed by a ruptured fuel line in the
portion of the wing that runs above the left engines.
   ``But the in-flight fire and crash impact destroyed evidence
necessary to further isolate the cause of the fire and the exact
location of the fuel leak,'' the Air Force said. All four crewmen
ejected safely.
   A temporary grounding after the accident failed to locate any
wing fuel line problems with the remainder of the B-1B fleet, but
more frequent inspections will continue to be performed, the service
added.
   The investigation also confirmed earlier reports from
eyewitnesses that the pilot of the stricken plane probably saved
several lives on the ground.
   Capt. Michael E. Waters ordered his three crewmen to employ a
manual ejection sequence _ so that he would be left behind after
they bailed out _ and then flew the plane away from a populated area.
   ``Seeing that the aircraft was headed toward an inhabited area
and observing an open field to the left, he pointed the aircraft in
that direction, nosed the aircraft over 2 or 3 degrees and
ejected,'' the report states.
   The Air Force's Strategic Air Command, which is responsible for
the manned bomber force, said its investigation of the Nov. 8 crash
had ruled out any problem with the plane's General Electric Co. jet
engines.
   ``A review of the maintenance personnel and supervision records,
the remaining aircraft records and the testimony of maintenance
personnel revealed no factors contributing to the mishap,'' the
report adds.
   The accident report does not explicitly address the question of
whether an assembly-line problem could be responsible for the
accident. But an Air Force official who declined to be identified
said there was no evidence of any problem involving initial
production.
   The $280 million bomber went down last November in a field
outside Abilene, Texas, while practicing ``touch-and-go'' landings
at Dyess Air Force Base, Texas. The plane was consumed by fire after
crashing and declared a total loss.
   All was normal on the flight until just after a touch-and-go
landing around 3:20 p.m. CST. At this point, the plane's crew had
been practicing such landings and approaches for almost two hours
without incident.
   As the bomber climbed skyward, though, ground observers clearly
spotted flames and puffs of smoke on the left side of the plane. The
report adds the crew didn't know there was a problem until the plane
had flown about one-half mile from the runway and they suddenly
heard a ``loud bang coming from the back and left side of the
aircraft.''
   Using data from the plane's computerized monitoring system, the
investigators concluded the bang represented the start of a massive
fuel leak, but they were unable to determine what caused the bang.
   The crash at Dyess was followed just nine days later by another
B-1B crash at Ellsworth Air Force Base, S.D. The Air Force two weeks
ago blamed that accident on pilot error.
   The November crashes were the second and third involving a
production-model B-1B in 14 months' time, leaving the Air Force with
97 of its original 100 planes.
   The four-engine, swing-wing B-1B is the first new addition to
America's manned bomber force in more than 25 years. Built by the
Rockwell International Corp., the B-1B has a maximum speed of about
1,000 mph and a range of more than 7,000 miles.

   Five Central American
presidents agreed Tuesday on a plan to monitor progress toward
democracy in Nicaragua and said they would seek a way to dismantle
the Contra rebel army fighting the Sandinistas, officials said.
   Verifying democratization in Nicaragua is considered vital if the
Central American peace plan is to be revived. Discord over the issue
arose soon after the summit began Monday at this seaside resort 40
miles southeast of San Salvador.
   The summit brought together host President Jose Napoleon Duarte
of El Salvador and presidents Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala, Jose
Azcona of Honduras, Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and Oscar Arias of
Costa Rica.
   Tuesday's compromise appeared to be a concession to Nicaragua,
which held out for an international role in determining that
democracy was being implemented.
   Other Central American governments have accused the leftist
Sandinista government of failing to make required moves toward
increased democracy, but Nicaragua recently has talked about holding
early elections and taking measures to give the opposition a fair
chance.
   Paul Reichler, a U.S. lawyer and adviser to the Sandinista
government, told reporters of Tuesday's 11th-hour accord on
verifying that commitments to democracy and human rights are
fullfilled.
   Reichler said the formula revives the Commissions of Dialogue
formed as a result of the Esquipulas II plan signed on Aug. 7, 1987.
The commissions promoted dialogue between governments and their
political opposition, but ceased to function when the peace plan
bogged down last year.
   He said the dialogue commissions would be the first arbiters of
disputes over electoral procedures, respect for civil liberties and
other matters stemming from government commitments under the
Esquipulas accord to complete democratization.
   Reichler said that if the dialogue commissions cannot resolve
disputes, the Commissions of National Reconciliation formed under
the peace plan would serve as an appeal body.
   These commissions also stopped operating in most of the signatory
countries and would have to be revived. They were headed by each
country's top Roman Catholic churchmen.
   If the Reconciliation Commissions fail, ``a panel of experts
designated by the Secretary-General of the Organization of American
States'' would serve as arbiter, said Reichler.
   Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica wanted to have
the Reconciliation Commissions as final arbiter, but Nicaragua said
that would stack the deck.
   Asked if the OAS panel would include people from outside the
region, Reichler said, ``Presumably.''
   Reichler and other officials privy to the presidential
discussions indicated earlier Tuesday that the political
verification issue was not going to be resolved here.
   Foreign Minister Alfonso Cabrera of Guatemala had told The
Associated Press the presidents would ``give impetus to the spirit
of verification,'' but the nuts and bolts of monitoring compliance
would have to be worked out later.
   Officials close to the talks said the presidents also agreed to
look for a way to break up the Contra apparatus constructed during
the eight years of Ronald Reagan's presidency.
   Reichler told reporters the presidents committed themselves to
drafting a plan within 90 days for ``dismantling, demobilizing and
relocating the Contras.'' He gave no details.
   An estimated 11,000 Contra fighters and about 10,000 of their
family members remain in camps in Honduras near the Nicaraguan
border, supported by U.S. humanitarian aid. Many expressed a desire
to go on fighting despite lack of U.S. military help.
   This summit was an attempt to resuscitate Esquipulas II, which
called for cease-fires in civil wars affecting Nicaragua, El
Salvador and Guatemala; democratization, amnesties and a halt to
outside aid for insurgents.
   It banned use of one signatory's territory as a base for
agression against that of another.
   The foreign ministers last week worked out a preliminary accord
for monitoring compliance with the territory clause. The draft
worked out at the United Nations involves international monitors _
tentatively from Canada, West Germany and Spain _ who would work
along the Honduran borders.
   Officials said the presidents ratified that agreement Monday,
then delved into the thornier issue of monitoring compliance with
democratization.

   Dustin Hoffman and Melanie Griffith
were among the favorites for best actor and actress nominations for
the 61st annual Academy Awards.
   The nomination announcements, scheduled for Wednesday, had the
added suspense of uncertain prospects for ``Mississippi Burning,''
the civil rights drama that has been widely criticized for rewriting
the history of both the 1960s and the FBI.
   Screenwriter Chris Gerolmo was overlooked in last week's Writers
Guild of America nominations. While one-time Oscar winner Gene
Hackman, who co-stars in the film, was likely to receive an Oscar
nomination for best actor, the fate of director Alan Parker, Gerolmo
and the film's best-picture chances remained in doubt.
   Nominations for the 22 Oscar categories were scheduled to begin
at 5:30 a.m. PST Wednesday, timed for East Coast coverage by the
networks' morning news programs. Awards were to be presented on
March 29.
   Hoffman, who won an Oscar for his performance in ``Kramer vs.
Kramer,'' emerged as last year's most heralded actor for his
starring role as an autistic savant in the box-office hit ``Rain
Man.''
   Miss Griffith, who starred in ``Something Wild'' and ``Body
Double,'' drew wide acclaim for her charismatic lead role in
``Working Girl.''
   Contending for best-picture nominations were ``Rain Man;'' ``A
Cry in the Dark,'' the story of an Australian mother charged with
killing her infant; ``The Accidental Tourist,'' an adaptation of
Anne Tyler's novel on the emotional journey of a travel writer;
``Working Girl,'' a comedy on the rise of a secretary in the
corporate world; and ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' the animated,
live-action film that was No. 1 at the box office last year.
   Other potential best-picture selections were ``Dangerous
Liaisons,'' ``Big,'' ``Running on Empty'' and ``Mississippi
Burning.''
   A dark horse for best picture was ``The Unbearable Lightness of
Being,'' a film adapted from Milan Kundera's novel about a Czech
surgeon who flees his homeland when the Soviets invade in 1968. The
film was voted the best picture of 1988 by the National Society of
Film Critics. Two hundred and seventy films were eligible for the
1989 Oscar awards.
   Directors who were expected to be nominated included Barry
Levinson for ``Rain Man,'' Robert Zemeckis for ``Who Framed Roger
Rabbit,'' Fred Schepisi for ``A Cry in the Dark,'' Sidney Lumet for
``Running on Empty,'' Mike Nichols for ``Working Girl'' and, as a
longshot, Clint Eastwood for ``Bird.''
   Possible nominees for best actor, in addition to Hoffman and
Hackman include Tom Hanks (``Big''), Kevin Costner (``Bull
Durham''), Edward James Olmos (``Stand and Deliver''), Oscar-winner
William Hurt (``The Accidental Tourist'') and Jeremy Irons for his
double portrayal of twin gynecologists in ``Dead Ringers.''
   Joining Miss Griffith on the list of best-actress possibles were
Sigourney Weaver (``Gorillas in the Mist: The Adventure of Dian
Fossey''), two-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep (``A Cry in the
Dark''), Oscar-winner Shirley MacLaine (``Madame Sousatzka''), Glenn
Close (``Dangerous Liaisons'') Susan Sarandon (``Bull Durham''),
Christine Lahti (``Running on Empty'') and Jodie Foster (``The
Accused'').
   Veteran actor and two-time Oscar winner Alec Guinness (``Little
Dorrit'') appeared likely to be nominated for best supporting actor,
among such other candidates as Martin Landau (``Tucker: The Man and
His Dream''), Michael Keaton (``Beetlejuice''), Dean Stockwell
(``Married to the Mob''), Joe Mantegna (``Things Change''), Liam
Neeson (``The Good Mother'') and River Phoenix (``Running on
Empty'').
   For supporting actress, the list of favorites featured Geena
Davis (``The Accidental Tourist''), Frances McDormand (``Mississippi
Burning''), Elizabeth Perkins (``Big''), Barbara Hershey (``The Last
Temptation of Christ'') Diane Venora (``Bird'') and Lena Olin (``The
Unbearable Lightness of Being'').
   More than 30 countries submitted entries for best
foreign-language film, including Spain's ``Women on the Verge of a
Nervous Breakdown,'' about a woman whose lover leaves her; Denmark's
``Pelle the Conqueror;'' Hungary's ``Hanussen;'' India's ``Salaam
Bombay;'' and China's ``Red Sorghum.''
   More than 4,600 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences, sponsors of the Oscars, were given ballots this year.
Academy members vote on their area of specialty.
   ``The Last Emperor,'' director Bernardo Bertolucci's epic
chronicle of the China's last monarch, swept last year's Oscars with
nine trophies. It took a trophy in every category it was nominated
in, including best picture and best director.
   Other prominent 1988 winners included Cher (best actress for
``Moonstruck''), Michael Douglas (best actor for ``Wall Street''),
Sean Connery (best supporting actor for ``The Untouchables'') and
Olympia Dukakis (best supporting actress for ``Moonstruck'').
Denmark's ``Babette's Feast'' was named best foreign film.

   A government minister met
Tuesday with lawyers and parents of some of the nearly 300 black
detainees who have vowed to starve themselves to death unless they
are freed or charged with a crime.
   In support of the hunger strikers, Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu called on Anglicans to fast each Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
   After a two-hour evening meeting with Adriaan Vlok, minister of
law and order, one member of the six-parent delegation, Wallace
Motsetsi, said he felt there was ``a ray of hope.'' But delegate
Willie Bokala said the meeting ``achieved nothing.''
   Bokala said he was guardian of Clive Radebe, 25, who he said has
been in detention since November 1987 and entered his 21st day of a
hunger strike Tuesday.
   ``We are faced with the difficult situation that children may die
in detention,'' Bokala said before the meeting.
   Lt. Peet Bothma, spokesman for Law and Order Minister Adriaan
Vlok, said detainees are reviewed and released every day, and 17
were freed Tuesday.
   But he warned it was dangerous to free detainees who were on
hunger strike ``because they might go out and fill themselves up and
they could die.''
   He said two were freed Monday, two days after they started eating
again. He said they were not released because they broke their fast,
but because of the regular review of detainees.
   Some strikers have not eaten for 22 days, and 21 reportedly have
been hospitalized. Vlok says fewer than 1,000 people are being held
under national emergency laws which allow indefinite detention
without charge. Some have been held without charge since June 1986.
   Bothma said Vlok spent several hours Tuesday going over files of
detainees with several lawyers.
   He said Vlok's meeting with lawyers was part of a daily process
of review which usually is made internally without outside
consultation.
   ``We are reviewing every detainee virtually on a daily basis,''
Bothma said. ``Every day someone is released and detainees'
positions are reviewed.''
   Tutu said he and other anti-apartheid church leaders will meet
Vlok on Thursday to discuss the strike. It has proved the strongest
challenge yet to the government's policy of detention without trial.
   Tutu, the winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, spoke by
telephone with Vlok on Monday and described the minister as ``very
concerned.''
   ``The very fact that he is ready to meet a delegation of lawyers
and church leaders is an indication that he is prepared to listen to
different points of view,'' the bishop said.
   He said a prayer service for the detainees would be held in Cape
Town on Thursday before his meeting with Vlok, and a larger
solidarity service is planned Friday.
   Vlok has used emergency regulations to ban any meetings to
support the strikers, and police have warned they are investigating
newspapers that have described the hunger strikers' physical
conditions, which may violate emergency rules.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, who along with Tutu is one of the
country's most influential anti-apartheid clerics, announced Monday
he is fasting in solidarity with the hunger strikers.
   ``None of us wish to die,'' Boesak said in a letter to Vlok.
``But if this is the road we must take to make you and your
government understand the evil of your ways, we will take it.''
   The strikers include about 170 detainees at Diepkloof Prison
outside Johannesburg, 105 at St. Alban's prison in Port Elizabeth
and 11 at a Port Elizabeth police station.

<HEAD>PLO Supporter Meets with Israeli Leftists; 4 Palestinians Wounded</HEAD>

   Faisal Husseini, a leading supporter of the PLO
in the occupied territories, met with left-wing Israeli legislators
Tuesday in the first such contact since the Palestinian uprising
began 14 months ago.
   ``It was a general meeting and we discussed personal subjects,''
Husseini said after the two-hour session at a guest house in Arab
east Jerusalem. He would say no more and members of the Israeli
delegation declined comment.
   Among the Israelis were Labor Party legislator Chaim Ramon; Chaim
Tzadok, a former Labor justice minister; legislator Yair Tzaban of
the socialist party Mapam, and Mapam's general secretary, Elazar
Granot.
   Government policy prohibits contacts with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, but leftist legislators want that changed
on grounds the PLO is Israel's inevitable partner in peace
negotiations. The government considers the PLO a terrorist
organization.
   Husseini, who has spent 18 of the past 22 months in Israeli
prisons under ``administrative detention'' without trial, has
expressed willingness to meet with Israelis of all political
viewpoints.
   ``I would like to spend more and more time ... talking with
different groups of Israelis, not only groups that support my aims
but those who are not supporting our aims,'' he said in an interview
earlier Tuesday.
   Asked about talking with Israeli leaders, Husseini said: ``If
it's the right place, the right timing, the right person, I will not
say no. If it's the wrong time, the wrong place, the wrong person, I
will say no.''
   While in prison, Husseini met with Shmuel Goren, coordinator of
Israeli policy in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, which
Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
Goren arranged the meeting.
   Soldiers shot and wounded four Palestinians in the occupied lands
Tuesday, ranging in age from 9 to 16, Arab hospital officials
reported. An army official confirmed a 9-year-old was wounded in the
West Bank city of Nablus.
   At least 380 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed since
the uprising began, and more than 7,000 Palestinians have been
wounded.
   Merchants closed their shops in Bethlehem, a Christian town in
the West Bank, to protest raids by Israeli tax authorities, an Arab
reporter said. Tax boycotts have been a regular feature of the
uprising.
   In the Golan Heights, captured from Syrian in 1967, Druse Arabs
held a general strike to protest Israeli annexation of the area
seven years ago. Hundreds of extra riot police were deployed to
prevent violence.
   ``The Druse don't accept it (the annexation) because this is
Syrian territory,'' a villager identified as Arab Zafadi said on
Israeli army radio.
   About 150 Syrians, some shouting anti-Israeli slogans through
loudspeakers, approached the border to support the Druse, Israel
radio said.
   Israel extended its law to the Golan Heights on Dec. 14, 1981.
The Druse began a campaign against it two months later but have not
held regular protests in solidarity with the Palestinian uprising.
The Druse sect is an offshoot of Islam.

   An advanced navigation satellite
soared into orbit Tuesday aboard the maiden flight of the Air
Force's new Delta 2 rocket, a booster developed to carry vital
military payloads grounded after the space shuttle Challenger
explosion.
   It was the first of at least 54 new unmanned rockets the Pentagon
is ordering in a $14 billion program to resolve a post-Challenger
crisis that has seen about 40 needed reconnaissance and other
national security payloads languish in storage for want of a launch
vehicle.
   The Navstar Global Positioning System satellite carried on the
Delta 2's maiden flight Tuesday was the first military payload
shifted off the shuttle manifest to a throwaway booster.
   The $30 million, 128-foot rocket roared off its launch pad at
1:30 p.m., and the Air Force reported 30 miunutes later it had
performed flawlessly in lofting the $65 million satellite into an
initial elliptical orbit ranging from about 100 to 11,000 miles
above the Earth.
   ``It was in every way a picture-perfect launch,'' Air Force Lt.
Col. Bob Tayloe, the launch director, told a news conference. ``The
satellite came up very strong and we're receiving a good signal.''
   On Thursday, an on-board rocket motor is to fire to shift the
satellite into a circular orbit about 11,000 miles up.
   The 3,675-pound Navstar GPS is an advanced version of seven
earlier model Navstars currently in orbit. The new satellite will
tell U.S. and allied military forces where they are to within a few
feet anywhere on the globe _ land, sea or air.
   The new satellite has more power and other improved systems and
has two information channels instead of one, with the second being
encrypted for use only by the military.
   Users of the military channel will be able to plot their
locations to within 50 feet, in some cases to within 5 or 6 feet,
officials said.
   Civilian users will have to be satisfied with an accuracy of
about 300 feet, still pretty good if a person is in the middle of an
ocean or a jungle, said Col. Marty E. Runkle, director of the Joint
Global Positioning System Office of the Air Force Space Division.
   ``Just about any military system or operation you can conceive of
can use the GPS system for location _ airplanes, trucks, submarines,
tanks, troops, whatever,'' Runkle told a news conference. ``Midair
refueling or a linkup at sea in dark nights, through the fog, can be
done without any communications or turning on of radar. Typically
you have to turn on radar and essentially light up the sky.''
   The satellite is the first of 21 of the upgraded Navstars the Air
Force plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992, giving
anyone anywhere in the world 24-hour access to the positioning
information.
   The Air Force originally planned to launch all 21 on NASA's space
shuttle fleet. But that plan was scrapped after the shuttle
Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986. Now only two Navstars remain
scheduled on the shuttle.
   Pentagon officials decided after Challenger they had made a
mistake in abandoning unmanned rockets to launch all payloads on the
shuttle, and authorized the building of three new models of rockets
_ the medium-size Delta 2 and Atlas 2 and the much larger Titan 4.
   The Delta 2, a more powerful version of the earlier Delta rocket
that has been flying since 1960, is the first of the new rockets to
fly. The Titan 4 is scheduled to debut next month and the Atlas 2
next year.
   The grounding of the shuttle and the Air Force Titan 34D rocket,
also after a 1986 failure, created a backlog of about 40
reconnaisance, communications, navigation and other national
security satellites.
   Six more Delta, four Titan and two military shuttle flights
scheduled this year will help drain down that backlog.

   The Navy said Tuesday it had awarded a $185.1
million contract to a Wisconsin shipbuilder for three additional
ocean-going mine-sweeping ships.
   The service also announced a separate, $35 million award to the
Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co. to inactivate and defuel two
old, nuclear-powered attack submarines.
   The two submarines are the Skipjack, which was commissioned in
1959, and the Sculpin, commissioned in 1961. The Navy described the
deactivations as long-planned and routine and based on the age of
the vessels.
   The larger contract was awarded to Peterson Builders Inc. of
Sturgeon Bay, Wis. Peterson is the lead contractor for the so-called
Avenger class of mine-sweepers.
   Two weeks ago, the Navy announced it had settled a dispute with
another Wisconsin shipyard that is building the vessels. In that
case, the Navy said it was providing additional money to ensure that
the Marinette Marine Corp., which has been struggling financially,
completed work on the three ships it has under contract.
   Construction of the vessels at both yards was delayed for two
years because of hundreds of design changes. The ships are unusual
in that they must be made with glass-reinforced plastic sheathing on
a wooden hull _ and use low-metal engines _ in order to maintain the
``low magnetic signature'' essential to hunting and clearing mines.
   Peterson has delivered the first ship in the class, the Avenger,
and has four others under contract besides the three awarded
Tuesday. The Navy has not said how the settlement with Marinette
will affect that firm's participation in the program.

   President Bush joked Tuesday that he and his

from his granddaughter.
   And Mrs. Bush did wear her heart-shaped earrings and a scarlet
red jacket in recognition of Cupid's day.
   As they returned from the Oval Office to the White House
residential quarters at the end of the day, the Bushes stopped to
chat with a handful of reporters. Bush was carrying a handmade red
paper heart decorated with white.
   He held it up to his heart and said it was from his 2-year-old
granddaughter, Marshall Bush. The child, dressed in a pink dress
with a red bow in her hair, and her mother Margaret accompanied the
couple. Bush allowed that this was the only one he had received.
   Asked if they exchanged valentine gifts, Mrs. Bush said, ``We
don't do that.''
   And the president quipped, ``We're too old.''
   Mrs. Bush joked she gave her husband, the ``same thing he gave
me,'' inferring that was no gift at all.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III met
Tuesday with Greece's socialist premier after gaining Turkey's
approval for the upgrading of NATO battlefield nuclear missiles.
   Baker later flew to Rome, where he is to meet with Italian
Premier Ciriaco De Mita on Wednesday.
   A senior U.S. official told reporters that Prime Minister Turgut
Ozal of Turkey, during a stopover in Ankara, offered his support for
upgrading of Lance nuclear missiles _ a move that has become a
contentious issue in West Germany.
   The most difficult problem for Baker during his tour has been
West Germany's refusal to support doubling the Lance missiles' range
to about 150 miles. Turkey's support strengthens the secretary of
state's hand as he plans for a NATO summit meeting in May.
   After an hour-long talk with Premier Andreas Papandreou and
Foreign Minister Carolos Papoulias at a luxurious seaside hotel,
Baker said they had discussed the future of U.S. military bases in
Greece.
   Papandreou has threatened to force American forces to withdraw
from four large military bases and 20 smaller ones. The five-year
bases agreement expired on Dec. 20, but negotiations are continuing
under an extension.
   ``We talked about the issue of the bases. My government believes
that continuing our defense relationship is in the interest of both
our countries,'' Baker said.
   ``We still have difficult issues to resolve but I am very hopeful
for an early and successful conclusion of the negotiations,'' he
said.
   Rome was the ninth stop on an eight-day tour of 15 capitals of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Although Greek-U.S. relations have been improving in recent
years, delays in reaching a new agreement on the American bases here
and repeated accusations that Greece has been soft on terrorism have
strained ties.
   Greek and American officials have held 14 rounds of talks on the
bases since late 1987.
   Papandreou assured Baker ``it is the desire not only the Greek
government but of all the Greek people to promote relations between
our two countries with continual improvement and to resolve whatever
bilateral issues exist.''
   Earlier in Turkey, Baker discussed the 14-year Turkish military
occupation of northern Cyprus in meetings with Ozal and Foreign
Minister Mesut Yilmaz. But the sessions reaffirmed ``the shared view
that the NATO alliance continues to have vitality, cohesion and
principles,'' said the senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters
under rules of anonymity.
   U.S. security assistance to Turkey has risen to $610 million from
$560 million, and the Turks did not renew last year's demand for $1
billion in aid, the official said.
   Greece's often testy relations with Turkey have cramped U.S.
foreign policy in the alliance's southern flank.
   Talks on the bases have stalled because of the socialist
government's insistence that a new agreement provide assurances that
the United States help solve Greece's disputes with Turkey over
military control of the Aegean Sea, its seabed mineral rights and
over Cyprus.
   Baker said he and the Greek leaders also talked about 39-year-old
Mohammed Rashid, wanted by the United States for the 1982 bombing of
a Pan Am jet over Hawaii. A passenger died in the blast.
   ``We also discussed the issue of terrorism and the need for very
close cooperation among democracies to wipe out this scourge,''
Baker said.
   A decision on extraditing Rashid, who has been jailed since his
arrest last May, is pending in the Supreme Court.
   Baker described as ``frank but friendly'' his talks with
Papandreou and Papoulias, which in diplomatic jargon indicates they
encountered some discord. But he said the officials shared ``the
need for close cooperation among democracies to decrease this
scourge'' of terrorism.
   Greece outraged then-Secretary of State George P. Shultz last
December by refusing to extradite Osama Abdel al-Zomar to Italy for
prosecution in a 1982 grenade attack on Rome's main synagogue.
Instead, Zomar, an alleged member of the Abu Nidal terrorist
organization, was sent to Libya, Abu Nidal's home base.

<HEAD>Panel Urges Dropping Social Security Funds From Deficit Count</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House task force on Thursday recommended
removing the Social Security trust fund from calculations of the
federal deficit because it makes the budget picture too optimistic
and undermines the retirement program.
   ``The Social Security trust funds represent an opportunity for
current workers to save for their retirement,'' the report said.
``But, they cannot have this effect if they are used simply to
offset current deficits in other federal accounts.''
   The task force, appointed by House Democrats Byron Dorgan of
North Dakota and Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio, included a bipartisan
group of economists. The panel's view echoes a growing perception on
Capitol Hill that using Social Security taxes to hide shortfalls in
the government's operating budget is flawed and allows a drain on
the economy.
   The 1983 revisions to the Social Security law increased
retirement taxes on workers to build up a surplus that would protect
the Baby Boom generation when it retires early in the next century.
According to recent calculations by the Congressional Budget Office,
the Social Security trust fund surplus reduces the deficit by $56
billion this year and will soon top $100 billion a year.
   But because that money is covering the shortfall in the rest of
the budget, the government-enforced savings is essentially
cancelled, the task force said.
   Congress and the White House have included the trust fund in
deficit calculations, as specified in the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law. Removing the surplus would be politically difficult
because the overall deficit would suddenly appear tens of billions
of dollars worse and a balanced budget would be an even more elusive
target.
   But Dorgan said the long-term risks to the nation should compel
lawmakers to face up to the situation, or they should replace Social
Security taxes with levies less onerous to the working poor.
   ``We ought to stop the practice cold-turkey,'' he said. ``I hope
that both the administration and the congressional budget writers
will understand that we're heading toward a cliff here.''

<HEAD>Agency To Process Political Asylum Candidates At Rural Detention
Center</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds a graf to explain origins last year of plan to move processing
out of Harlingen.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Immigration and Naturalization
Service said Tuesday it will begin processing political asylum
applicants at a detention center outside the city, which evicted the
agency last week for health and fire violations.
   A lawyer for Central American immigrants said the sight of a
prison will intimidate some people from applying for refugee status.
   The applicants will not be locked in the minimum-security Port
Isabel Service Processing Center, but INS District Director Omer G.
Sewell said detention is being considered as a way to manage more
than 100,000 Central Americans expected to pour into southern Texas
this year.
   ``There are a number of alternatives that are being considered,
and as Attorney General (Richard) Thornburgh said, detention was one
of them,'' Sewell said.
   He said a dispute with Harlingen officials over garbage, human
waste and fire code violations at the asylum office speeded up
previously made plans to move to the rural INS detention center
southeast of the city.
   But he said the INS could continue to process hundreds of asylum
applicants in town if it chose to. ``We want to be good citizens in
this community as well,'' Sewell said.
   The city evicted the agency from a former furniture store on the
edge of town Friday and chained the doors. The city also obtained a
temporary restraining order in state court to prevent the agency
from reopening an unsafe and unsanitary facility.
   INS officials responded Monday by obtaining a federal restraining
order to regain access to the building, where they cut the chains.
   Sewell said the INS will go on using that building to process the
applications of people seeking amnesty under the 1986 immigration
reform law.
   Beginning Wednesday, however, all political asylum claims must be
submitted at the rural detention center. Asylum can be granted to
immigrants fleeing political or other forms of persecution.
   Asylum processing will take place at a building outside the
double-fenced detention area, Sewell said. As of Tuesday, 425
undocumented aliens were detained there, most of them pending
deportation proceedings.
   City Manager Gavino Sotelo welcomed the move but called it a
``partial solution.'' He said the INS needs to detain asylum
applicants who otherwise will continue to strain local communities
with their need for shelter and assistance.
   ``They need to address this problem the way they did with
refugees from Vietnam, Cuba and Haiti,'' Sotelo said.
   During an influx of Cubans and Haitians in the early 1980s, the
government used facilities similar to the detention center in
southern Texas, Sewell said.
   The center, on approximately 400 acres near the Laguna Atascosa
National Wildlife Refuge, also has an immigration court, he said.
   At the current rate of 2,000 or more Central Americans a week
crossing the border illegally near Brownsville, Sewell said he
expects more than 100,000 asylum-seeking immigrants to pass through
the area this year.
   ``Hopefully we'll get control of the situation and there won't be
this large-scale need for processing asylum applicants,'' Sewell
said.
   The remote location and prison setting will discourage people
from seeking asylum, said Mark Schneider, an attorney with the
Harlingen-based Proyecto Libertad legal aid office for Central
Americans.
   ``It's going to be a return to the old days, where people went
underground instead of working through the system,'' said Schneider,
one of a group of immigration attorneys who on Jan. 6 sued the INS
over a policy that restricted asylum-seekers to southern Texas while
their cases for refugee status were under review.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela issued a restraining order Jan.
9 allowing the immigrants to pursue their claims at their intended
U.S. destinations, but Vela has said he probably will allow the INS
to resume the no-travel policy next Monday.
   The policy, which took effect Dec. 16, was blamed for a sudden
increase of homeless Central Americans living in makeshift tents and
condemned buildings in Texas' already impoverished Lower Rio Grande
Valley.
   Health, safety and traffic concerns expressed by community
leaders in Harlingen at that time led to immigration officials
planning the move of the asylum processing, Sewell said.

   Union Carbide Corp. agreed Tuesday to pay
$470 million to the government of India in a court-ordered
settlement resulting from the 1984 gas leak at Bhopal that killed
more than 3,300 people in the world's worst industrial disaster.
   Activists in Bhopal denounced the settlement as a betrayal of the
20,000 victims who still suffer from exposure to the deadly gas that
escaped from a pesticides plant on Dec. 3, 1984. The government had
sought $3 billion in damages.
   Chief Justice R.S. Pathak interrupted a government prosecutor's
routine argument when the court reconvened after lunch, and ordered
the U.S.-based multinational company to pay the damages by March 31.
   Attorneys for the government and Union Carbide promptly agreed.
   ``It was apparent that there was an out-of-court agreement
between Union Carbide and the government,'' said a court official
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``For such an order there
should have been excitement, but there was no murmur even.''
   ``It wasn't entirely out of the blue,'' said another source, who
also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Pathak, citing ``the enormity of human suffering,'' said a
settlement was needed to ``provide immediate and substantial
relief.''
   More than 2,000 people were killed almost immediately when the
white vapor of methyl isocyanate seeped from a storage tank at the
plant operated by Union Carbide's Indian subsidiary and drifted over
nearby shantytowns and into Bhopal.
   The leak occurred shortly after midnight, and some victims died
in their sleep. Others, blinded by tears and gasping for breath,
tried to flee but collapsed in death.
   More than 20,000 people still suffer from exposure to the gas and
victims continue to die at a rate of at least one a day, according
to a government gas relief board. It says the death toll has reached
3,329.
   Pathak, speaking for a five-judge Supreme Court panel, ordered
Union Carbide to pay $470 million to the Indian government ``in full
and final settlement of all claims, rights and liabilities related
to and arising out of the Bhopal gas disaster.''
   He also ordered all civil proceedings transferred to the Supreme
Court, and quashed all criminal charges, including one of culpable
homicide filed in 1987 against former Union Carbide chairman Warren
Anderson.
   Pathak gave no details of how the money should be paid to the
victims, but he directed government prosecutors and attorneys for
the Danbury, Conn.-based company to submit a detailed agreement
Wednesday.
   ``This is a fair and just settlement,'' Gopal Subramanium, one of
the chief government attorneys, told a reporter.
   In New York, Union Carbide spokesman Earl Slack said Pathak's
order ``was based on its review of all pleadings in India and the
U.S., applicable law and facts, and the enormity of human suffering
that requires substantial and immediate aid.''
   Union Carbide's stock price soared $2.12{ to $31.25 a share in
early trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, and
analysts said they approved of the settlement. The closing price was
$31.12{, up an even $2.
   ``Psychologically, it's terrific. Financially, it's reasonable,''
said Leslie Ravitz, a research director for Salomon Brothers in New
York. ``This relieves the pressure on Union Carbide and the stigma.''
   James Wilbur, a vice president with Smith Barney, Harris Upham
and Co. Inc. in New York, said Union Carbide had set aside $200
million and had $250 million in insurance coverage.
   ``The risk is minimal,'' he said.
   In Bhopal, a city of nearly 1 million people, many politicians
and activists were angered by the settlement.
   ``This is a betrayal of the gas victims,'' said Babulal Gaur, a
state legislator from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party. He
called the settlement ``negligible.''
   ``The government has once again come under the pressure from the
lobby of multinationals,'' said Abdul Jabbar Khan, who mobilizes
demonstrations of gas victims.
   Many of the victims of the disaster live in burlap and cardboard
shacks, and were unaware of the settlement because they are too poor
to own radios.
   Pathak ordered the settlement as the Supreme Court heard Union
Carbide's appeal of an order to pay $166 million in interim
compensation to gas victims and a counter-appeal by the government
to raise the amount to $233 million.
   The interim order was issued April 4, 1988, by the high court in
central India's Madhya Pradesh state, where Bhopal is located.
   Union Carbide had argued the order would prejudice the case's
outcome.
   It maintained the gas leak was the result of sabotage by a
disgruntled employee, and Slack said the company stood by the
contention. The Indian government said the disaster was the result
of negligence.
   The disaster produced fierce debate around the world about the
moral and legal responsibilities of multinational companies that set
up shop in developing countries.
   Critics charged that rich corporations from industrial nations
exploit Third World countries. Union Carbide officials complained
privately that they were hamstrung by local restrictions.
   In accordance with Indian law, the Bhopal pesticide plant was
owned by Union Carbide of India Ltd. and operated by local employees.
   Efforts to bring the case to trial in the United States were
rejected by judges who said they had no jurisdiction.
   The case began in the Bhopal District Court and made its way
through the labyrinthine Indian judiciary, where cases can languish
for years and even decades.
   One Bhopal judge was dismissed when it was discovered he was
among the 500,000 people who filed damage claims. Another judge was
dismissed on grounds he was prejudiced against Union Carbide.
   Some of the claimants lived thousands of miles from Bhopal but
said they suffered mental anguish from worrying about the fate of
loved ones, including railroad passengers whose trains might have
been near Bhopal at the time of the leak.

   Kathleen Turner wore drop-dead red,
shimmied and joined in a chorus of ``Wild Thing'' as she accepted
Hasty Pudding Theatricals' 1989 Woman of the Year award Tuesday.
   As is traditional, Ms. Turner engaged in off-color banter with
Harvard University students, who since 1951 have given the award and
a good roasting each year to the performer ``who makes a lasting and
impressive contribution to the world of entertainment.''
   The students compiled a list of adjectives to describe Ms.
Turner: ``Hot, steamy, smouldering, sizzling, torrid, blazing,
sweltering, simmering, seething, balmy.''
   ``Oh, that was Sesame Street,'' the movie heartthrob quipped.
   Ms. Turner made her 1981 film debut in ``Body Heat'' and recently
starred in ``The Accidental Tourist.'' She also was the voice of
Jessica Rabbit in the animated movie, ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,''
in which her most memorable line was: ``I'm not bad; I'm just drawn
that way.''
   Ms. Turner said her roles in ``Accidental Tourist'' and ``Roger
Rabbit'' may compete for this year's Academy Awards.
   ``I'm told I may be up against myself for supporting actress as
both Sarah and Jessica Rabbit,'' she said before accepting the small
brass Hasty Pudding pot.
   Asked by reporters about her throaty voice and faintly foreign
accent, Ms. Turner replied, ``It's because I grew up in South
America and England and because I'm a little affected.''
   Before the ceremony, Ms. Turner was paraded through Harvard
Square on the back of a 1947 Lincoln Contintental convertible,
flanked by male Harvard students in drag, a tradition that dates
back to the days when the university's constitution forbade men to
wear women's clothes.
   Previous recipients of the award include Lucille Ball, Katherine
Hepburn, Meryl Streep and Elizabeth Taylor.
   Actor Robin Williams is scheduled to accept Hasty Pudding's 1989
Man of the Year Award on Feb. 21 at the opening of the annual
student production, ``Whiskey Business.''

   A memorial service is scheduled for Friday
for Dolph Simons Sr., board chairman of the World Company and
Lawrence Journal-World and longtime editor and publisher of the
newspaper.
   Simons, 84, died in his sleep at a family residence in
Scottsdale, Ariz., Monday night or Tuesday morning. The cause of
death was not determined.
   He had remained active in the daily newspaper operation until the
time of his death.
   Simons worked as a reporter for The Associated Press in Chicago
in 1924, and then returned to the Journal-World, founded by his
father, W.C. Simons, in 1891, and served as office manager, editor
and publisher.
   He was a member of the AP board of directors in 1951-60, serving
two terms as board vice president.
   ``Dolph Simons Sr. was a newspaperman of dedication and
distinction,'' AP President Louis D. Boccardi said Tuesday. ``He
epitomized the values of a local newspaper owner dedicated to
serving his community and he leaves a newspaper family that carries
on those traditions. AP was fortunate to have enjoyed his services
as a director.''
   David Furnas, executive director of the Kansas Press Association,
described Simons as ``a leader in the newspaper business in Kansas.''
   Simons' son, Dolph C. Simons Jr., editor and publisher of the
Lawrence Journal-World, said, ``I doubt if any son could be more
fortunate in having such a great father, business associate and
teacher. He was a truly outstanding, exceptional newspaperman.''
   His survivors also include his wife, Marie; a second son, Dr.
John Simons of Scottsdale, Ariz.; eight grandchildren; and two
great-grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   U.S.-born John Hull, a supporter of
Nicaraguan rebels who is under arrest on drug and weapons charges,
has been moved from a hospital to a jail, his lawyer, Elda Zuniga,
said Tuesday.
   Hull, 69, had been in custody in a Costa Rican hospital where he
was taken on Jan. 24 after suffering a heart attack in his jail cell.
   He was taken to a prison near the capital on Monday for transfer
to the prison in San Carlos, 105 miles northwest of San Jose near
the border with Nicaragua, Ms. Zuniga said. She explained that San
Carlos ``is where his case will be processed because it is where the
supposed law violations occurred.''
   A native of Indiana, Hull moved to Costa Rica 20 years ago and
has a ranch in Los Chiles, near San Carlos. His lawyer says he
became a Costa Rican citizen eight years ago.
   Hull was arrested on Jan. 13 on charges of drug trafficking and
violating Costa Rican security. Ms. Zuniga refiled a petition
Tuesday asking that he be released on bail. A similar request was
denied earlier.
   ``We hope this request is resolved favorably because John's
health is not completely stable,'' Ms. Zuniga said.
   She holds that the government's case is unfounded because the
drug law Hull was accused of violating in 1984 was not passed until
1987 and is not retroactive.
   Costa Rican authorities said Hull was arrested for investigation
of drug trafficking and spying for the anti-Sandinista rebels after
complaints by residents near his farm.
   Witnesses testifying before the U.S. Congress on illegal arms
shipments to the Contras have said Hull's ranch was used by gun
smugglers and cocaine traffickers.
   Hull strongly denied any connection to drug trafficking.

   The judge in Oliver L. North's case said
Tuesday the Justice Department must rely on independent prosecutors
to prevent surprise disclosures of state secrets during the
Iran-Contra trial.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell rejected a proposal he said
would have allowed the Justice Department during the trial to file
objections ``in bits and pieces'' to disclosing information needed
by the defense.
   Gesell challenged the Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to end the
case once and for all, by filing an affidavit barring disclosure of
secrets, if Thornburgh believed procedures the judge has adopted are
inadequate to protect national security.
   ``He can act now if he wants,'' Gesell told Thornburgh aide
Stephen A. Saltzburg.
   The decision means the Justice Department must decide whether it
can rely on independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to protect secrets
that the department has said could endanger lives if disclosed in
court.
   ``Our lawyers are reviewing the judge's order,'' said Thornburgh
aide David Runkel, adding that Justice Department officials have
been meeting with the independent counsel.
   ``There are a number of things being discussed back and forth,''
Runkel said. ``It's a question of reviewing the options. ... We want
the trial to continue but we want to safeguard against the
unauthorized release of classified information,'' Runkel said.
   In the meantime, Gesell said he will await a Supreme Court ruling
on whether the trial will be stayed indefinitely while an appellate
court reviews the Justice Department's objection to secrecy
procedures already put in place by the judge.
   The high court, which has temporarily stayed the trial's start,
will meet Friday to discuss the issue.
   Charges against North include shredding documents and lying to
Congress and then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III in 1986 to hide
his role in the sales of arms to Iran and diversion of some proceeds
to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   The judge's comments came during a hearing on a compromise
proposal, worked out between the Justice Department and Walsh,
covering procedures for deciding which classified information could
or couldn't be aired during the trial.
   The proposal was aimed at preventing surprise disclosures by
North, and it was strongly opposed by the former National Security
Council aide's lawyers.
   Gesell ruled that the Justice Department must rely on Walsh's
prosecutors to speak in court for the government on all disclosure
issues, including appeals of any rulings that some secrets are
relevant to North's defense.
   Only if the Justice Department determines it must stop the case
can it file an affidavit barring further disclosures under the
Classified Information Procedures Act, the judge ruled.
   Saltzburg said: ``We'll do everything in our power to take this
case forward, if we can do it safely.''
   ``It is the responsibility of the attorney general to ensure that
before classified information is disclosed in the case, that the
national security can withstand such a disclosure,'' he told Gesell.
   The judge said he wouldn't let Thornburgh ``chop up the case''
with a series of affidavits barring disclosure of information each
time North tried to introduce evidence the government found
objectionable.
   ``I find no basis for giving him a seat at counsel table or the
right to intervene by way of bits and pieces of affidavits whenever
the going gets tough,'' Gesell said.
   The judge reminded Saltzburg that he had already made a series of
pre-trial rulings governing what North can and cannot disclose
during the trial.
   Gesell said he expected that ``if you feel that was inappropriate
on my part, that you would take appropriate steps, but that you
don't seem to want to do.''
   ``The Department of Justice finds itself in a damned if you do,
damned if we don't position,'' Saltzburg said.
   ``So what you are saying is, the attorney general is unprepared,
not willing to exercise his authority now to fully protect that
information,'' the judge said. ``What he wants to see is if you can
wriggle through it against the court's rulings. He has it in his
power to act.''
   ``That's an unfair statement,'' Saltzburg said.
   On a related issue, the judge said he would consider, at a later
hearing, defense objections to part of the proposed agreement
between the Justice Department and Walsh on how certain evidence
would be presented at trial.
   Under the agreement, the Justice Department would allow
introduction of a general admission _ with no details _ that the
Reagan administration made ``quid pro quo'' arrangements with
foreign countries to solicit military aid for the Nicaraguan Contras
at a time when U.S. assistance was banned by Congress.
   Gesell said he would give North's lawyers an opportunity to
propose changes in the government's summary, which has not been made
public, saying he ``had a sense that the quid may be underplayed.''
   In a new filing Tuesday, North's lawyers said inducements offered
to Central American nations ``in return for their military support
for the resistance was, in part, CIA covert support.''
   ``If the court requires prior notice of this covert support, it
will effectively require prior notice before any exploration of quid
pro quo arrangements that are central to this case,'' North's
lawyers said.
   They have objected to the agreement, saying their defense of
North requires introduction of details about the `quid pro quo,''
which they say include involvement by former President Reagan in a
coverup of such arrangements with the other countries as well as an
agreement that Congress be kept in the dark.

   Dutch tugs Tuesday reached a
drifting tanker that was floating toward a cluster of oil rigs in
the central North Sea, and the danger of a collision was averted, a
Dutch coast guard spokesman said.
   He said two tugs reached the rudderless, Bahamas-registered
Alexandros when it was still nearly 20 miles from the Dutch-owned
oil rig toward which the ship was heading.
   The spokesman, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said ``the
situation is under control.''
   Earlier Tuesday, a British Navy helicopter evacuated 19 of the
rig's crew as the Alexandros, carrying 71,000 tons of crude oil,
drifted toward the structure, about 100 miles northwest of Ijmuiden.
   The Dutch and British navies and coast guards had been on
stand-by since early Tuesday, when the tanker radioed a distress
call saying it lost its rudder, the spokesman said.
   How the Alexandros became disabled was not clear, but the
spokesman said a gale was raging in the area early Tuesday.
   The Alexandros was not damaged and no injuries were reported
among its crew of 28.
   The rigs are operated by Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij, which
is jointly owned by Esso and Shell.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 7 inches of rain drenched Kentucky and flooding was
reported in several states Tuesday, while Southern Californians
shivered in near-freezing temperatures.
   Recent rain and the chance of more rain resulted in flash flood
advisories for portions of West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana,
Tennessee, Mississippi and Texas.
   Serious flooding was reported over the western two-thirds of
Kentucky overnight and waterways were expected to rise rapidly.
Flooding also was reported in parts of Tennessee and near West
Union, Ohio.
   Heavy rains contributed to at least three deaths. One woman,
ignoring police warnings, tried to drive across a flooded state
highway in Lebanon, Tenn., became stuck, got out of her car and
drowned, police said.
   In Jefferson County, Kentucky, authorities said a woman's car ran
off a road Tuesday and plunged into a flooded ditch. Police rescued
the woman, who was standing atop the vehicle.
   The storm was expected to drop up to 8 inches of rain in
Tennessee by Wednesday.
   With 3 to 7 inches of rain in western and central Kentucky on
Monday and Tuesday, the lower Ohio River was expected to reach flood
stage later this week.
   Flooding also was expected along the Illinois River at Adair in
northeast Oklahoma.
   Farther west, the overnight low temperature in Oakland, Calif.,
was 40 degrees, a record for the date. During the last 9 days,
Oakland has had eight low temperature records.
   A frost advisory was posted in San Diego for Tuesday night and
Wednesday night. Frost was possible as far south as the Del Mar Race
Track and at Point Loma.
   Freezing rain fell in portions of the Texas Panhandle and western
Oklahoma. Snowfall during the 6 hours ending at 1 p.m. EST included
4 inches at Rumford, Maine, 2 inches at Mount Washington, N.H., and
an 1 inch at Caribou, Maine, and Eastport, Maine.
   Heavier rainfall during the same 6 hours included an inch and a
half at Tupelo, Miss., an inch and a quarter at Wichita Falls,
Texas, and more than an inch at Muscle Shoals, Ala.
   High temperature records for the date included Baton Rouge, La.,
83 degrees; Beckley, W.V., 60; Cape Hatteras N.C., 72; Jackson,
Miss., 82; Mobile, Ala., 80.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 7
degrees at Butte, Mont., and Yellowstone Wyo., to 83 degrees at
Baton Rouge, La., and McAllen, Texas. The low for the nation Tuesday
morning was 16 below zero at Butte, Mont.
   The forecast for Wednesday called for snow extending over the
northern Rockies and the upper Missouri Valley and reaching from
northwest Missouri and Iowa across the lower Great Lakes, and from
northeast New York to northern New England. Snow was expected to
change to rain from central New England to Maryland, from the
Virginias to the Ohio Valley, the Tennessee Valley and southern
Illinois and southern Missouri. Rain and thundershowers were
forecast from the northeast third of Texas across Oklahoma and the
lower Mississippi Valley.
   High temperatures were expected in the single numbers above zero
and the teens from Montana across the Dakotas, Minnesota, northern
Wisconsin and upper Michigan; in the 20s and 30s over northern New
England and northeast New York, the remainder of the Great Lakes
states, the central Mississippi Valley, the central Plains, the
Texas Panhandle, the remainder of the Rockies, the eastern half of
the Great Basin and the northern Plateau; in the 60s and 70s from
the Virginias across Georgia, from the Tennessee Valley across the
central Gulf of Mexico coast, the lower Mississippi Valley, central
Texas, southern Arizona, southern California and much of the
California coast; and in the 80s over the Florida peninsula and
southern Texas. High temperatures over the remainder of the nation
were generally expected to reach the 40s and 50s.

   A civilian who saved the military $6.3
million was finally paid back Tuesday with a government check for
$18,375.
   John Ledoux, a sergeant with the Vermont Army National Guard,
created a device two years ago that detects whether the infrared
lights on a helicopter work. His $8.70 creation replaced a $4,500
pair of special goggles.
   During a ceremony in the Burlington building where he built the
device, Ledoux finally received an incentive award from the federal
Office of Personnel Management. After taxes, the $25,000 reward came
to $18,375.50.
   Ledoux said he was glad to finally get the award, which was held
up for several months because the White House apparently lost the
letter authorizing the payment.
   ``I feel like it's been put off for so long it's lost its glow.
But I'm glad it's finally coming to a head,'' said the soft-spoken
father of five, who accepted the check with his family by his side.
   ``My wife and I have a big family so of course, the money is
nice,'' he said.
   The award is the maximum allowed by law and the largest given to
a federal employee, said Joseph Jamele, press secretary for Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. He said 20 such awards have been granted.
   Ledoux, 33, is a former military technician who worked full time
at the National Guard base in Burlington before taking a job with
the Federal Aviation Administration last year. He developed his
device in 1986 after watching engineers with the Lockheed Aircraft
Corp. test infrared lights on helicopters.
   Ledoux was concerned the engineers had to perch in precarious
positions to test the lights, particularly while standing on the
choppers or on ramps outside the helicopter hanger.
   ``It was more for the safety of individuals _ that was his
concern,'' said Maj. George Bergeron, Ledoux's former boss.
``Vermont ramps are pretty cold and icy.''
   Ledoux built the hand-held infrared sensor from $8.70 worth of
parts from the local hardware store. ``When he first came up with
this, he stayed up late after work in the shop. Quite a few nights
he did that to improve his idea,'' Bergeron said.
   The Army embraced the device after Ledoux sent one down.
According to Bergeron's estimates, it has saved the military 987,000
hours of labor a year, for a total $6.85 million. Bergeron estimated
net savings of $6.3 million after subtracting the costs of materials
and of implementing the device.

   Advocates for the disabled on Tuesday hailed
a federal court ruling requiring wheelchair lifts on new public
buses, but a spokesman for transit agencies said the ruling doesn't
address vexing problems.
   ``We've been grappling with this for a long time,'' said Albert
Engelken, deputy executive director of the Washington-based American
Public Transit Association.
   He said wheelchair lifts receive limited use where they exist and
are an added expense to transit agencies at a time when federal
subsidies have been dwindling.
   On Monday a 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled 2-1
that Congress has made its wishes on accessibility clear and that
lift-equipped buses are part of that mandate.
   The court ordered the U.S. Transportation Department to rewrite a
regulation allowing communities to offer alternative ``paratransit''
service, such as van rides, to the disabled. It said the 24-hour
reservations that riders need to make for such services hinder
spontaneous use of mass transit.
   James D. Fornari, a New York City attorney for a group of
veterans with spinal cord injuries, said the ruling will force
transit systems to look for the most efficient means of serving
disabled people.
   He said the ruling also could influence Transportation Department
regulations being drafted on light rail and commuter rail systems.
   ``We are quite pleased with this decision and I see it as a
springboard for making other transit systems which have buses
accessible to the mobility impaired, so they can be mainstreamed
into American life and society,'' Fornari said.
   Transportation Department spokesman Bob Marx declined comment on
the ruling. He said attorneys for the department had not yet seen
the decision.
   Engelken said his association's board, which comprises the heads
of transit agencies across the nation, believes agencies should be
able to decide on a local basis how best to serve disabled people.
   ``Up until now, the courts have ruled that it was local option,''
he said. ``This evidently is a new twist.''
   A transit association task force is studying the issue of
handicapped access and is scheduled to report by the end of the
year, he said.
   Many local transportation officials declined comment on the
ruling because they had not seen it.
   But Peter Dimond, a spokesman for Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority in Boston, said, ``We have made a pledge
that all buses we purchase in the future will be lift-equipped.''
The Boston authority operates 800 buses daily, of which about a
third are lift-equipped, Dimond said. A new batch of 200 buses is on
order, all equipped with lifts. The agency also provides
door-to-door van service.
   Carol Boudreaux, a spokeswoman for Metropolitan Transit Authority
in Houston, said none of the authority's more than 900 buses are
equipped with lifts. But she said the authority has always complied
with Transportation Department regulations in the past and expected
it would with any new regulations mandated by the ruling.
   The Houston authority offers a service with vans or cabs, in
which the handicapped pay a portion.
   Donna Alston, a spokeswoman for Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority, said 568 of the authority's 1,510 buses
are lift-equipped. She said the authority provides 1,200 rides on
its alternative paratransit service on an average weekday.
   A Chicago Transit Authority spokeswoman, who asked that her name
not be used, said that the CTA has more than 2,000 buses and none
have wheelchair lifts.
   The appeals court also upheld a lower court order that the
Transportation Department rewrite regulations that relieve transit
authorities of their obligations to ensure accessibility if they
spend 3 percent of their budget on services to the handicapped.
   ``Given the clear congressional mandate of accessibility, the
DOT's choice of the cost cap exceeded its discretion,'' wrote Judge
Carol Los Mansmann in the majority ruling.
   But Judge Morton I. Greenberg dissented, saying he felt the
majority went too far. ``To the extent that money is spent for
adding lifts to regular transit coaches it will not be available for
paratransit services unless general services are curtailed, fares
raised or more aid obtained,'' he wrote.
   Fornari, who represented the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans
Association in the case, said cost was not a major factor in transit
agencies' failure to install wheelchair lifts.
   ``The cost of paratransit is far in excess of what this will
cost,'' he said.
   Rather, the ruling will require transit operators ``to meet
service criteria instead of just throwing money at it,'' Fornari
said.
   It costs $15,000 to equip a bus with a wheelchair lift, and buses
cost about $200,000, according to Joaquin Bowman, a spokesman for
the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, which serves
the Philadelphia metropolitan area.
   The ruling came in connection with suits filed in 1986 by the
veterans group and a coalition called Americans Disabled for
Accessible Public Transportation, which has chapters in 25 cities
and whose members have been arrested at demonstrations around the
country.

   Gov. Joe Frank Harris was among the
pallbearers as about 350 people paid their last respects Tuesday to
his slain 74-year-old aunt.
   The blue-robed choir left a space at the usual seat of Allie
Morrow Roper as the mourners assembled at Faith United Methodist
Church for a service in which she was eulogized as a devout
Christian who cared and prayed for her fellow man.
   There still were no suspects in her strangulation, authorities
said.
   The sanctuary of the small, red brick church, where ``Miss
Allie'' was a long-time member, could not hold all the mourners.
About 50 listened to a speaker in a church courtyard.
   The sanctuary, which usually included flowers arranged by Mrs.
Roper for Sunday services, was lined with floral arrangements.
   The governor did not speak at the service, at which his brother,
Fred Harris, eulogized their aunt as ``mischievous'' but a source of
strength for their family.
   He said he had been told the oven in her home was on when her
body was found Sunday. He said she apparently was preparing to bake
``and I believe that was for Joe Frank's birthday (Thursday).''
   Authorities have speculated Mrs. Roper was killed by an intruder
Saturday. Her body was discovered when she did not show up for
church Sunday.
   Cartersville police have begun circulating a composite drawing of
a man seen near Mrs. Roper's home, but Public Safety Director Otis
Chupp said, ``There is still nothing concrete.''
   A reward fund organized by the Cartersville-Bartow County Chamber
of Commerce had reached more than $6,000 Tuesday.
   Relatives of Mrs. Roper issued a statement through Tommy Lewis,
an aide to the governor.
   ``The family deeply appreciates the many prayers and all the
support they have felt from the community and the state,'' Lewis
said.

   Gov. Bob Martinez said Tuesday a
clemency hearing will be held for a man who says he was framed for
the fatal poisonings of his seven children in 1967.
   Martinez said he and three Cabinet members have agreed to hold
the hearing. A majority of the seven-member Cabinet was needed to
waive rules in order to hold the clemency hearing.
   ``There are a great many questions in this case that demand
answers,'' Martinez said in a statement. ``I am gratified that ...
we can now move forward to reach those answers.''
   Martinez and the six independently elected Cabinet members,
sitting as the Board of Executive Clemency, have the power to pardon
James Richardson, who is serving a life sentence at Tomoka
Correctional Institution in Daytona Beach.
   ``We hope that the Cabinetwill grant immediate clemency and
release James Richardson,'' said Ellis Rubin, a Miami lawyer
representing the former fruit picker. ``This is probably the most
wronged man in the United States. ... Today was a very big step on
the road of freedom for James Richardson.''
   Rubin said Richardson, 53, sobbed when he told him of support for
the clemency hearing and the inmate said his prayers had been
answered.
   ``I want to be free,'' Richardson told Rubin. ``It has been
terrible and when I walk out of this prison, I want to look at these
men who put me here, straight in the eye, and I will then ask God to
forgive them. This is one of the greatest days of my life.''
   Richardson and his wife were picking fruit on Oct. 25, 1967, when
their children, aged 2 to 8, ate a parathion-laced lunch of beans,
rice and grits. The lunch had been prepared ahead of time, but was
served by neighbor Betsy Reese at the family's Arcadia home.
   Prosecutors said Richardson killed all seven children, but he was
convicted of only one first-degree murder count in 1968 for the
death of his 8-year-old stepdaughter, Betty Jean Bryant.
   Martinez said his office will consult with Dade County State
Attorney Janet Reno, whom he asked on Feb. 1 to investigate the
case, before scheduling a hearing.

<TEXT>
   Salman Rushdie was already an award-winning author
in England before his novel ``The Satanic Verses'' came out last
year.
   ``Midnight's Children,'' published in 1981, was a success and won
him two of Britain's most prestigious literary awards _ the Booker
McConnell Prize for Fiction and the James Tait Black Memorial Book
Prize.
   The book is about Bombay and the children born at the moment
India gained its independence from Britain in 1947 _ the same year
he was born.
   His book ``Shame,'' a mythologized account of the intricacies of
Pakistani politics, was published in 1983 and this was followed in
1987 by ``The Jaguar Smile: a Nicaraguan journey.''
   ``The Satanic Verses,'' published last year, won the 1988
Whitbread Novel Award and was runner-up for the Booker Prize.
   Rushdie also contributes to numerous literary journals.
   Born to a Moslem family in Bombay, India, Rushdie went to the
Cathedral School in his hometown. When he was 13 his father sent him
to Rugby, one of Britain's top private schools.
   Rushdie wanted to return home after Rugby but won a scholarship
to Cambridge University's King's College and his parents insisted he
went there. He majored in history at King's, showing a particular
interest in the prophet Mohammed and reading books that were banned
in some Islamic countries.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' has been banned in his native land, other
Moslem countries and South Africa.
   Rushdie followed his parents to Pakistan after college and landed
a job in Pakistan's fledgling television service. But he said he
encountered political and religious prejudice there and returned to
England, scratching a living as an advertising copywriter. He is now
a British citizen.
   His first book, ``Grimus'' published in 1975, raised little
interest.

<HEAD>County Leaders Hear of Tragedy in Testimony on Ban of Semiautomatic
Rifles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   County supervisors considering joining the
city in banning semiautomatic assault rifles heard testimony Tuesday
about how the fatal shooting of a mother traumatized her husband and
children.
   Supervisor Kenneth Hahn has proposed a ban on the sale and
possession of the military-style rifles in unincorporated areas of
Los Angeles County. An anticipated vote was delayed, however,
because one supervisor was ill.
   Meanwhile, in Olympia, Wash., a Republican state senator who
strongly opposes gun controls bowed Tuesday to demands that the Law
and Justice Committee he heads consider restrictions on ownership of
semi-automatic weapons. Sen. Kent Pullen said he will hold a hearing
next Tuesday, but would wait for public response before deciding
whether to hold a committee vote.
   Several California cities have banned the guns and state
lawmakers have begun considering action since a man with an assault
rifle killed five children and wounded 29 others and a teacher at a
Stockton school Jan. 17.
   Although the vote was delayed two weeks, the county Board of
Supervisors listened to testimony about the victims of shootings.
   The Rev. Guy Wilson, pastor of Our Lady of Victory Church in
Compton, said that last year he lost 13 parishioners to gunfire in
the gang-ridden south central Los Angeles area. He brought with him
the children of one victim, Rosalinda Cisneros, 28, who was slain by
an assault weapon 18 months ago.
   ``The Cisneros family, the five children here with me, they saw
their mother gunned down,'' Wilson said.
   ``The mother had in her arms her 4-week-old child. When she heard
the shooting, she turned to protect the child, and she herself took
the shot through the heart and died,'' Wilson said.
   He said the father was so traumatized he turned to drink and is
now in prison for an alcohol-related offense. The five children now
live with another family who have eight children of their own,
Wilson said.
   Brian Baker, a member of the National Rifle Association, argued
against a ban. ``The issue is being touted as a law and order
concern, but I feel we're seeing a cynical attempt to accomplish ...
total gun confiscation,'' he said.
   Under the proposal, the assault rifles could still be owned by
museums, licensed dealers, law enforcement agencies and the military.
   The cities of Stockton, Los Angeles, Carson and Compton have
enacted bans on semiautomatic assault rifles, and one was proposed
Monday in San Diego.
   Colt Industries Inc. filed a federal lawsuit in Los Angeles on
Monday, saying the city's new law banning sales of semiautomatic
rifles will cause the firm financial harm and hurt its image. The
weapons company makes the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, which is
included under the law.

<HEAD>Study Shows $125 Million Cost For Tritium Conversion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An idle reactor on the Hanford nuclear
reservation could produce tritium for weapons after a three-year,
$125 million conversion, providing a quick fix for the nation's
nuclear arms program, a study says.
   The nation's only supply of tritium, a radioactive isotope of
hydrogen that is a key ingredient in nuclear weapons, has been cut
off since early last year because of reactor safety problems at
South Carolina's Savannah River Plant.
   The $5.5 million study authorized by the U.S. Department of
Energy considered whether Hanford's idle N Reactor could be made
into a short-term tritium producer until new reactors could be
built, a site manager at Westinghouse Hanford said Tuesday.
   ``It would cost $125 million over three years to set the reactor
up for tritium,'' Wallace Ruff, manager of defense reactors at the
south-central Washington site, told The Associated Press.
   Hanford's N Reactor, which manufactured another key nuclear
weapons ingredient, plutonium, has been on ``cold standby'' since
early 1988 because of a surplus of plutonium.
   The plan outlined by the study, which was conducted by
Westinghouse Hanford Co., would be a relatively quick and
inexpensive fix for a U.S. nuclear weapons program that is without a
working reactor producing tritium and faces steep costs in building
new tritium reactors.
   The production and supply of nuclear weapons materials is
classified, but Ruff said the study found the N Reactor could meet
tritium production needs.
   Such a development could ease the impact of the 2,800 layoffs
expected when the N Reactor is completely shut down. About 1,800 of
those layoffs already have occurred.
   The Energy Department is planning tritium reactors in South
Carolina and Idaho, and an experimental method of using a linear
accelerator to produce tritium also has drawn much recent attention.
   The linear accelerator would be at least seven years away from
production and the new reactors about a decade away.
   A third proposal, to convert an unfinished civilian reactor at
Hanford to tritium production, has run into considerable opposition
from anti-nuclear activists who say that would violate international
non-proliferation agreements.
   Tom Bauman, a spokesman for the Energy Department in Richland,
said no decision has been made on restarting the N Reactor for
tritium.
   ``The department is constantly looking at this,'' he said.
   The N Reactor, which began operations in 1963, could operate
about nine years as a tritium producer at about $150 million per
year before the plant was adversely affected by aging, Ruff said.
   The reactor shared some design similarities with the Chernobyl
plant, whose 1986 destruction killed 31 people. Both used graphite
in the reactor core to moderate nuclear fission and lacked a
containment dome to trap accidental emissions.
   Federal officials have repeatedly said the N Reactor is much
safer than the Soviet plant, and $100 million worth of safety
improvements were performed after the N Reactor was closed for
inspections in early 1987.

   Army troops backed by tanks battled
Christian militiamen in east Beirut and hills above the capital
early Wednesday in an apparent showdown for control of Lebanon's
Christian heartland, police reported.
   Police said at least four combatants were killed and 12 wounded
in the power struggle between Christian army units and the Lebanese
Forces, the main Christian militia in the nearly 14-year-old civil
war against the Moslems.
   Thousands of residents huddled in basements and bomb shelters as
the fighting flared into the early hours Wednesday. Others dodged
sniper fire to ring church bells in residential neighborhoods in
protest against the worsening hostilities, a police spokesman said.
   Also Tuesday, moderate Shiite Moslems demonstrated in 13 villages
in south Lebanon, demanding a ban on the return of fundamentalist
supporters of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Christian army units routed Lebanese Forces militiamen from many
of their strongholds along Beirut's dividing Green Line and the
mountain towns of Souk el-Gharb and Bekfaya east and northeast of
Beirut, police said.
   Christian militiamen responded by mounting grenade-throwing
assaults on army barracks and an air base in the coastal town of
Edma, 15 miles north of Beirut, said the police spokesman.
   ``It looks like a showdown. Unless it's quickly curbed it could
escalate into an all-out war,'' said the spokesman who cannot be
named under standing rergulations.
   The confrontation was touched off by a firefight northeast of
Beirut at sundown Tuesday, prompting announcements by both sides
that they have put their forces on alert.
   The Lebanese Forces command accused the army of sending five
tank-led battalions of 4,000 troops rolling down on Beirut's
Christian sector from the mountains and that the 6,000-strong
militia was ``braced for a confrontation.'' The army denied the
accusation.
   The Lebanese Forces earlier said its fighters were ordered to
``stand by to defend all their positions'' after a shootout with the
army in Lebanon's central mountain range, six miles northeast of
Beirut.
   The flare-up was the third between the two sides in one week,
heightening the struggle for supremacy between the two most powerful
Christian fighting machines.
   Police in the southern port city of Tyre said the anti-Hezbollah
demonstrations were organized by the pro-Syrian Amal militia, whose
fighters evicted Hezbollah from most of the south last April.
Schools, shops and businesses were closed in the 13 villages in
sympathy with the protest.
   The biggest anti-Hezbollah march on Tuesday was in Siddiqin, six
miles southeast of Tyre, where about 2,000 demonstrators waved
banners saying ``No to the party of Satan, no to Iran in south
Lebanon.''
   About 1,000 villagers in nearby Qana paraded in dusty streets,
chanting ``Keep the murderers away! We don't want them back!''
   The return of unarmed Hezbollahis was provided for in a peace
accord signed by the two militias in Damascus, Syria, last month.
The agreement ended a 10-month-old struggle for dominance of
Lebanon's 1 million Shiites, the nation's largest sect.

<TEXT>
   On the corner of Neon and Lonely streets in the
bar of the Heartbreak Hotel, dreams don't even have time to die hard.
   That's because someone is stealing them _ drugging the dreamers
and slipping into their subconscious to pilfer their most private
fantasies and thoughts.
   If that sounds like an audacious and unlikely subject for song
and dance, it is. But then ``In a Pig's Valise,'' the new musical
which arrived Tuesday at off-Broadway's Second Stage, may well be
the most audacious and unlikely new musical of the season.
   That's not to say ``perfect,'' but Eric Overmyer, who wrote the
book and lyrics, and August Darnell, who wrote the music, have an
affection for the writings of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett
and the hard-boiled detective stories they are spoofing. Because of
that, it's easy to overlook a repetitiveness that eventually
sidetracks the show once the novelty of the dialogue begins to wear
off.
   The musical's hero is a pudgy shamus named James Taxi, hired by a
Latin spitfire named Dolores Con Leche _ meaning Sorrows with Milk,
explains Taxi _ to find her missing sister. The search leads to the
Heartbreak Hotel and nefarious doings by a gang of thugs, led by the
notorious Bucket brothers, Shrimp and Gut.
   The gang kidnaps people and makes off with their dreams to sell
as computerized holograms. Their biggest catch is Walt Disney _ his
body frozen, wrapped like a mummy and waiting for the big thaw. But
these criminals will take the minds of just about anyone including
Dolores who goes undercover as an ethnic folk dancer in the hotel's
nightclub.
   The plot is awash in simile, metaphor and enough tough guy double
talk to baffle Bogart. Much of the deliberately purple prose is
relayed directly to the audience by Taxi, and most of it, while not
advancing the plot, is very funny.
   Taxi, played by Nathan Lane, is a loser, a well-meaning
marshmallow masquerading as a hard-edged private eye. Lane fits the
role perfectly. He's a brash performer who moves and sings well.
Forty years ago, he would have worked steadily on Broadway. Today,
he has to be content with occasional forays into musical comedy.
   Ada Maris sizzles as the tempestuous Dolores, and Michael
McCormick is a hilarious foil as the evil and fleet-of-foot Shrimp
Bucket.
   As he demonstrated in his plays ``On the Verge'' and ``In
Perpetuity Throughout the Universe,'' Overmyer revels in language.
He has an ear for pop vernacular of the past but he laces it with an
up-to-date sensibility that makes it funny in 1989.
   Overmyer's lyrics don't have the intricacy and linguistic dazzle
of his dialogue, but they fit the eclectic score by Darnell, best
known as the leader of the band Kid Creole and the Coconuts.
   Darnell's music is not the stuff of typical musical comedy. It's
all over the place with bits and pieces of jazz, rock, pop, salsa,
reggae and even rap stuffed into the score.
   The show, thanks to set designer Bob Shaw and lighting designer
Peggy Eisenhauer, has the feel of one of those smoky 1940s Warner
Bros. detective movies, all shadows and neon signs.
   Graciela Daniele's fast-paced direction and snappy choreography
propel the musical, rushing the actors through the plot when details
try to bog down the evening. But for much of time, ``In a Pig's
Valise'' is as scintillating and seductive as the saxophone wail
that begins the show.

   Fumio Niwa soared into the night early
Wednesday, hoping his huge orange and blue balloon will find the
easterly jet stream and carry him to San Diego on the first solo
balloon flight across the Pacific.
   San Diego is the sister city of Yokohama, his hometown, but Niwa
may not reach it even if he crosses the ocean successfully. Late
weather reports said the winds in the jet stream, which begins at
about 35,000 feet, had veered to the north and probably would take
the balloon toward Alaska instead.
   Just before setting off for North America, which he hoped to
reach in about four days, Niwa said: ``My long dream of crossing the
Pacific is coming true today. I still wonder if it's really
possible. The jet stream is bending strangely, but America is big so
I think I'll make it, somewhere.
   ``As people say, things that go up must come down, so I'm not
very worried.''
   After nearly five hours of slow climbing in the cold evening sky
, Fumio Niwa reported Wednesday morning ``everything is going
fine,'' a spokesman said.
   In his first radio contact with home, made at 6:21 a.m. (4:21 EST
Tuesday), Niwa said the balloon was about 80 miles southeast of
Yokohama, where he lifted off at 1:47 a.m. (12:47 EST Tuesday),
according to project spokesman Tadakatsu Izumi.
   Izumi said Niwa's balloon, flying at an altitude of 8,200 feet,
would head toward the south ``for some time'' before reaching
high-altitude winds later in the day.
   His balloon has no maneuvering ability, so its direction depends
entirely on the wind. It carries no navigation equipment, and Niwa
must rely on amateur radio reports of his location, based on
satellite trackings.
   Ground equipment used to receive the satellite data malfunctioned
and a standby unit was installed, delaying his takeoff for several
hours.
   Niwa, 38, says he never outgrew his childhood love of playing and
is making what he hopes will be a 5,000-mile flight to test the
balloon and gondola, both of which he designed.
   ``If just flying were my purpose, I'd buy a ready-made balloon,''
he said, ``but I like to design and make my own equipment and then
try it out.''
   The gondola, the fifth Niwa has designed, is a globe six feet in
diameter, too small inside for a passenger to stand, and made of a
plastic stronger than the type used for bulletproof vests. It is
pressurized because of the high altitudes at which he plans to
travel.
   Unlike most, Niwa's helium balloon is completely sealed and
filled with pressurized gas. High winds Monday and Tuesday delayed
the filling process and tore parts of an outer reflective layer of
silver fabric.
   Niwa quit his job at a computer company in November to prepare
for the flight, which he estimates will cost the equivalent of about
$540,000. He hopes to earn most of it back from a book and public
appearances.
   Because of financial constraints, he said, the gondola has no
alarms to warn of a loss of gas or sudden change in altitude. It
also has no heating system and Niwa must rely on electric heating
coils in his flying suit to keep him warm in temperatures expected
to reach 60 below zero.
   He has about 1,000 hours of ballooning experience, most in
hot-air balloons and none outside Japan.

   More than 80,000 Sri Lankan soldiers
and police stood guard as this island nation voted on Wednesday for
a new Parliament after a violent campaign left hundreds dead,
including 14 candidates.
   Sinhalese and Tamil militants demanded an election boycott and
threatened to kill anyone who went to the 8,070 polling booths to
vote.
   Buses were set afire on election eve, and at least 25 people were
killed in attacks by Sinhalese trying to enforce the boycott,
authorities said.
   In the north and east of this Indian Ocean island, 40,000 Indian
troops, here under a peace accord, were told ``to be very strict
with any attempts to disrupt the polls,'' an Indian diplomat said on
condition of anonymity.
   Polls opened for nine hours at 7 a.m. Significant returns were
not expected until Thursday.
   One hour before voting began, a policeman guarding the polling
center at Ananda College in Colombo was shot and badly wounded by
two men in a car.
   A police official at nearby Maradana police station said the
gunmen were Sinhalese extremists.
   The 225 seats in Parliament are being contested by nine political
parties and 10 independent groups. More than 9.3 million people are
eligible to vote.
   Favored to win was the governing United National Party headed by
President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who won the presidency in a bloody
election in December.
   United National's strongest foe was the Sri Lanka Freedom Party,
led by former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
   Sinhalese militants oppose the election as part of their
anti-government campaign launched in July 1987. They accuse the
government of conceding too much to rebels of the minority Tamil
community in a largely unsuccessful attempt to end a 6-year-old
insurrection.
   The government says the militants have killed at least 800 people
since Jan. 1 and at least 1,500 since they started their campaign.
   The election also is opposed by Tamil guerrillas fighting for an
independent homeland in the north and east.
   A rebel statement issued Tuesday said Tamils objected to the
polls because voting was being held ``under conditions of war and
violence with continuing military repression.''
   In one incident Tuesday, three bus passengers and a driver were
killed when Sinhalese fired on buses operating in defiance of a
strike call aimed at disrupting the elections, officials said.
   Sinhalese with revolvers ordered passengers to get off, then
poured kerosene on the vehicles and set them on fire, said a police
official.
   Shops in Colombo and towns in the south stayed closed Tuesday in
response to a Sinhalese call for a two-day strike, residents said.
   Government officials insisted that the violence would only
marginally affect voter turnout.
   Indian soldiers in the Tamil-dominated north and east are trying
to put down the Tamil insurrection.
   India initially became involved in the ethnic crisis in Sri
Lanka, just off India's southern tip, because of the 60 million
Tamils in India who sympathize with the rebel cause.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri lanka's 16 million people and say
they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up 75
percent of the population and control the government and the
military.
   The parliamentary elections are being held for the first time on
the basis of proportional representation.
   Voters will cast ballots for parties and the percentage of votes
received will determine the number of seats each party will gain in
Parliament. Candidates will be chosen by preferential votes, but the
choices will be restricted to party nominees.

   The National Film Board of Canada
has won an honorary Oscar and the animation director of ``Who Framed
Roger Rabbit'' will receive an achievement award, the motion picture
academy said Tuesday.
   The Canadian film board's Oscar, to be presented at the 61st
annual Academy Awards show on March 29, recognizes the board's 50th
anniversary and cites a commitment to artistic, creative and
technological excellence.
   The board has been nominated for Oscars 52 times and won eight.
Its first award was in 1941 for ``Churchill's Island,'' which was
the first documentary.
   The award was voted by the Board of Governors of the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Science.
   The governors voted a special achievement award to Richard
Williams, director of animation and creator of all the new
characters in the animated feature ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,''
including Roger, Jessica and Baby Herman.
   The academy cited Williams' ``unique accomplishment'' in awarding
him his second Oscar. The first was for his short production of
Charles Dickens' ``A Christmas Carol'' in 1972.
   The Board of Governors decided not to present Irving G. Thalberg
and Jean Hersholt Humanitarian special awards this year.
   The Thalberg award is presented to ``a creative producer whose
body of work reflects a consistently high quality of motion picture
production.''
   The Hersholt award recognizes ``individuals in the motion picture
industry whose humanitarian efforts have brought credit to the
industry.''
   The awards show will be broadcast by ABC from the Shrine
Auditorium in Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Gunmen Kill Sinn Fein Councilman</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 6 grafs with British envoy to make fact-finding trip on
direct rule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen killed a councilman
belonging to Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the IRA, in the
second slaying of a Roman Catholic public figure this week, police
said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, but suspicion fell
on Protestant paramilitaries opposed to the outlawed Irish
Republican Army, a mainly Roman Catholic group fighting British rule
of the province.
   John Joe Davey, who was in his late 50s, was gunned down as he
approached his home near Gulladuff, about 30 miles northwest of
Belfast, said a spokesman at police headquarters in Belfast.
   Police said several bullets hit him in the chest. They said his
wife ran down the lane from their home when she heard the shots but
found her husband already dead.
   Davey was returning from a town council in nearby Magherafelt,
police said. Davey was one of three members of Sinn Fein who sat in
the predominantly Protestant council.
   The attack followed the killing Sunday of Catholic attorney
Patrick Finucane, who had acted for clients in the IRA.
   Finucane was slain by three gunmen at his home in north Belfast.
A outlawed Protestant paramilitary group, the Ulster Freedom
Fighters, claimed responsibility for his death.
   Almost exactly a year ago, Davey survived a killing attempt in
exactly the same spot. Sinn Fein said in a statement that he had
survived three other assassination attempts.
   The IRA wants to unite predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland
with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist
rule.
   Also Tuesday, the British government said it is sending an envoy
to Northern Ireland to discuss how to form a government that would
replace direct rule from London.
   Tom King, Northern Ireland secretary, said one of his four junior
ministers, Dr. Brian Mawhinney, will make the fact-finding trip to
Belfast.
   King, apparently referring to secret talks between the main
Northern Ireland parties that started in Duisburg, West Germany,
late last year, said: ``The question now is whether the
constitutional political parties and those who support them wish to
make progress.
   ``If they do, then I want to ensure that the government is ready
to play its part in whatever way is appropriate and helpful,'' King
said.
   Mawhinney, 48, who is a House of Commons legislator for an
English electoral district, was born in Northern Ireland.
   The province has been ruled from London since March 1972.

<TEXT>
   Presidential candidate Carlos
Menem of the opposition Peronist Party was quoted on Tuesday as
saying the Falkland Islands belong to Argentina and will be
recovered ``even if we must suffer the spilling of blood.''
   ``Argentina will not give in,'' Menem said during a campaign
swing Monday night, according to Argentina's two independent news
agencies, Diarios y Noticias and Noticias Argentinas.
   The Malvinas _ Argentina's name for the territory off its south
coast that it has claimed since 1810 _ ``will return to form part of
the national territory even if we must suffer the spilling of
blood,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Menem was on a visit to Ushuaia, 2,045 miles south of the capital
city of Buenos Aires.
   Argentina and Britain went to war over the sparsely populated,
windswept and virtually treeless islands in 1982. Argentine troops
invaded on April 2. A British expeditionary force recovered the
islands after a counterattack in which 712 Argentine and 255 British
soldiers died.
   The war lasted 74 days. Argentina surrendered but refused to
formally declare an end to hostilities. Neither side resumed
diplomatic relations.
   Britain's claim dates to 1833. It has since fortified the islands
and enforced a 200-mile zone of exclusion around them. Argentina has
tried to isolate the islands commercially by prohibiting direct
flights or ships from the mainland.
   It has tried to apply international pressure to force Britain to
negotiate the islands' sovereignty. British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher has refused.
   The two agencies also quoted Menem as saying: ``I don't know how
much time will pass or how much blood we will have to spill to see
that the Malvinas return to Argentine territory.''
   President Raul Alfonsin and Foreign Minister Dante Caputo, who
also is president of the U.N. General Assembly, have said Argentina
inherited the islands upon declaring independence from Spain, and
the government will try to recover them peacefully through
negotiation.
   Ownership is an article of faith here. Argentine maps identify
the islands as the Malvinas, and schoolchildren are taught they were
stolen by Britain.
   Recovering the Falklands is a main foreign policy theme of
political groups from both left and right, along with the 4
million-member General Labor Confederation which backs Menem.
   Menem in the past said he would seek the islands' recovery by
diplomacy if he wins election on May 14. It was not known whether he
was speaking rhetorically in Ushuaia, or shifting and hardening his
position.
   A telephone call seeking comment from the British Interests
Section at the Swiss Embassy rang repeatedly but was not answered.

<TEXT>
   Tulsa voters, who have refused to change the
city's government four times in 35 years, overwhelmingly approved a
new city charter Tuesday that could end a legal challenge by black
residents.
   A strong mayor-council form of government was approved by 33,373
votes, or 71 percent, to 14,213 votes, or 29 percent.
   ``This makes a very special Valentine's Day for all of us,'' said
Mayor Rodger Randle, who along with the city's four other elected
commissioners campaigned in support of the new charter.
   Tulsa has had a commission form of government elected at large
since 1908. Under the new charter, the mayor gains power and
continues to be elected at large, while nine councilmen will be
elected by districts.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
has sued Tulsa, contending the at-large balloting for commissioners
unconstitutionally dilutes the minority black vote concentrated in
north Tulsa.
   Similar lawsuits in other cities have resulted in judges ordering
cities to change to a more representative government. A federal
judge has set a March 9 hearing on the Tulsa lawsuit to determine
whether the new charter makes the claims of the lawsuit moot.
   Election board officials said rain kept voter turnout under the
predicted 50,000 of the city's 225,000 registered voters.
   A 1969 proposal that would have changed Tulsa's form of
government failed by 63 votes out of more than 23,000 cast. The most
recent, a 1973 proposal, was defeated by a wide margin.
   City officials say the commission government is expensive and
inefficient.
   Supporters of Tuesday's measure said better representation for
black voters would be one of the benefits of changing the charter.
   Under the proposal, a part-time council would pass laws and
control the budget, while the mayor would have administrative power
and propose a budget. The mayor would be responsible for city
departments now divided among six full-time commissioners.
   Opponents said the charter change would give the mayor too much
power.

<TEXT>
   Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins
announced Tuesday that he was running for mayor, saying 12 years
under Mayor Edward I. Koch had polarized the city and left it
desperate for new direction.
   ``I am running because I believe this city needs a different
direction, new ideas and a fresh perspective,'' Dinkins said.
   The announcement at a crowded news conference followed months of
speculation and recent obvious hints that Dinkins would take on Koch
in the September primary for the Democratic nomination in an effort
to become the city's first black mayor. Several polls have indicated
Dinkins could beat Koch.
   ``I am running because our city has become sharply polarized,''
he said. ``We need a mayor who can transcend differences so we can
work together to solve our problems.''
   Dinkins, 61, is a lawyer who served as state legislator, Board of
Elections president and city clerk before being elected in 1985 on
his third try for borough president. Each of New York's five
boroughs has a president who has a seat on the Board of Estimate,
which passes on budget and planning matters for the entire city.
   ``I am prepared to lead this city in the new direction we so
desperately need,'' Dinkins said. ``New Yorkers are tired of
politicians who talk tough but act only after problems reach crisis
proportions.''
   Koch and Dinkins are publicly respectful to each other, but the
relationship frosted a bit when Koch strongly criticized Democratic
presidential candidate Jesse Jackson during last year's race.
   Dinkins supported Jackson and said he expects Jackson to
participate in the campaign.
   ``The mayor clearly has on occasion contributed to the
polarization of our city,'' Dinkins said.
   Koch said he considers Dinkins ``to be a very formidable
candidate. I perceive myself as the underdog. That's not just
rhetoric. I think the polls show that. I hope to turn them around.
   ``I welcome him into the race,'' Koch said. ``I think that he is
a very decent guy. I know that both he and I will conduct the
election battle in a responsible way.''
   While Democrats make up a strong majority of the city's voters,
Republicans may also have a primary featuring well-known candidates
this year. Former federal prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani will likely
announce his candidacy for mayor ``sometime in March,'' said U.S.
Rep. Guy Molinari, R-N.Y. Molinari said he had had five meetings
with Giuliani to discuss a mayoral run.
   Republican Ronald Lauder, heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics
fortune and a former ambassador to Austria, has already announced
his candidacy.
   Several polls have shown that Dinkins would defeat Koch and other
potential Democratic candidates, such as City Council President
Andrew Stein, special state prosecutor Charles J. Hynes, City
Councilwoman Ruth W. Messinger and former U.S. Rep. Herman Badillo.
   Though he downplayed the importance of polls, Dinkins said, ``I'd
rather be me than them, if you'll accept that grammar.''
   In contrast with the combative Koch, Dinkins has a courtly
manner, raising the question of what tone the campaign would have.
   ``I've been described as a nice guy, as a gentleman,'' Dinkins
said. Some of my close friends might dispute that.
   ``But let me tell you. ... I'm also an ex-Marine. And I don't
intend for a second to get shoved around in this or any other
campaign. So let's be clear on that.''

<HEAD>Study Says Milk Passes Meat as Top Source of Saturated Fat for Kids</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whole milk, cheese and other dairy
products have overtaken meat as the top source of unhealthy
saturated fat in many teen-agers' diets, new research suggests.
   Dr. Curtis Ellison of Boston University School of Medicine said
Tuesday that surveys he conducted at two elite New England prep
schools found that dairy products contributed about 35 percent of
students' daily consumption of saturated fat.
   He said at least two other still-unpublished studies elsewhere
have reached similar conclusions.
   ``The studies show that the main source of saturated fat is not
meat anymore,'' he said. ``It is milk and other dairy products.''
   Saturated fat clogs the heart's arteries and is a chief culprit
in the war on heart disease.
   Ellison measured the sources of salt and saturated at in the
diets of students at Phillips Exeter and Phillips Andover academies
in Massachusetts and New Hampshire as part of a study of dietary
changes.
   He found that after dairy products, meat, fish, poultry and eggs
provided 28 percent of the youngsters' saturated fat; baked goods
and cereals 16 percent; ketchup, gravy and other ``food adjuncts'' 7
percent; fruits and vegetables 7 percent, snacks 6 percent, and
everything else 1 percent.
   Ellison said many people shy away from red meat because of its
fat content, but they sometimes substitute varieties of cheese that
contain far higher levels of saturated fat.
   He recommended that, among other things, parents and schools
should encourage youngsters to drink fat-free milk rather than whole
milk.
   ``Kids love milk,'' he said. ``Some of them drink two liters a
day, and they grow up thinking that it's a good thing to have. We
are not trying to take their milk away. Just take the fat out of
it.''
   Ellison presented his data at a program on school lunches held at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Clinical Research Center.
   Ellison is among health experts who believe that youngsters
should cut down on saturated fat and salt to establish good eating
habits and prevent coronary artery disease and high blood pressure
later in life.
   Salt aggravates high blood pressure, and Ellison's prep school
survey found that breakfast cereal and baked goods provide about 30
percent of the salt in teen-agers' diets. Meats add 21 percent,
dairy products 16 percent, food adjuncts 12 percent, fruits and
vegetables 9 percent, snack foods 6 percent, table salt less than 1
percent and all else 5 percent.
   In dietary experiments at the two schools, Ellison found that by
substituting low-salt recipes in the schools' cafeterias, cooks
could make food that the youngsters would eat but still reduce their
salt consumption by 15 percent to 20 percent. This also reduced the
youngsters' average blood pressure by about two points.
   In another experiment, cooks substituted polyunsaturated fat for
saturated fat in recipes. This reduced saturated fat consumption
from 13 percent of total calories to 10.6 percent. However, because
of problems measuring the youngster's blood cholesterol levels, it
was unclear what effect this had on their cardiovascular health.

<HEAD>Two More Business Executives Reportedly Arrested In Stock Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors on Wednesday arrested two more
executives of two firms at the center of a major stock trading
scandal, bringing to seven the number of people arrested in the
case, a Japanese news report said.
   Shunjiro Mamiya, managing director of Recruit Co., and Seiichi
Tateoka, director of a real estate subsidiary Recruit-Cosmos Co.,
were arrested on charges of violating the Securities and Exchange
Law, the Kyodo New Service said.
   The parent company is a fast-growing business information
conglomerate that sold hundreds of thousands of shares in the
subsidiary to dozens of politicians, their aides and influential
businessmen and journalists before the company went public.
   The stocks soared in value after being made available for
over-the-counter trading, bringing huge profits to the purchasers.
   Mamiya played a central role in the sale of Recruit-Cosmos
stocks, while Tateoka looked after the financial aspect of the
transactions, Kyodo said.
   Prosecution officials refused to confirm the report of
Wednesday's arrests, saying they would talk only to reporters
belonging to a limited-membership press club affiliated with the
Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office.
   The reported arrests came only two days after prosecutors
arrested Recruit founder Hiromasa Ezoe, an executive of a
Recruit-affiliated finance firm and two former directors of Nippon
Telephone and Telegraph Co., Japan's largest company.
   The four were held on suspicion of bribery involving resale of
U.S.-made supercomputers by NTT to Recruit and leasing telephone
lines to Recruit at discount prices.
   The only previous arrest was of a Recruit official accused of
trying to bribe an opposition member of Parliament to soft-pedal an
investigation into the affair.
   Thirty officers from the prosecutors office searched NTT's
downtown Tokyo offices for more than eight hours Tuesday,
confiscating documents that filled 70 boxes.
   The stock sales were not illegal under Japanese law but raised
public outcries as well as in Parliament about political
fund-raising and ethics in government.
   More than a dozen members of Parliament _ including three Cabinet
ministers, former top bureaucrats and senior businessmen _ have
stepped down from public positions because of their link to the
scandal.
   Opposition parties have repeatedly insisted that Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita and his Cabinet resign over the affair, but
Takeshita has rejected the calls.

   A former rural-route postal carrier was
sentenced Tuesday to a year and a day in prison for failing to
deliver two of the first-class pieces found among tons of so-called
junk mail he was hoarding.
   William Ryan, 59, of Milton, told U.S. District Judge Roger
Vinson that he felt he couldn't possibly deliver all the mail on his
Florida Panhandle route, so about three years ago he started leaving
a few pieces in his car every day.
   ``Things just seemed to snowball once it started,'' Ryan said.
``I'm very sorry for what happened. ... It's been a bad year last
year for me.''
   After receiving a tip last August, postal inspectors found what
Assistant U.S. Attorney Samuel Alter termed a ``mountain of mail''
heaped in Ryan's home, a shed and surrounding woods about 30 miles
northeast of Pensacola.
   Nearly 500,000 pieces were discovered, almost all of them
advertising circulars, sweepstakes offers, give-aways and other
third-class bulk mail.
   Alter conceded most of Ryan's customers probably were satisfied
with his service. But he said the companies that paid to mail the
material also are postal customers.
   ``The actual victim-impact on the mailers is incalculable,'' the
prosecutor said.
   The judge also placed Ryan on probation for three years once his
prison sentence is completed and ordered him to pay $2,991.94 in
restitution to the Postal Service and a $100 special assessment.
   The restitution will cover the cost of maintenance personnel, use
of a bulldozer, forklift and trucks and other expenses of
recovering, sorting and delivering, returning or destroying the tons
of mail he failed to deliver.
   The judge, however, disallowed $10,974 in restitution for the
salaries of postal supvervisory personnel assigned to the case.
   Ryan, a 15-year postal employee, for the past three years had
been working a rural route in Escambia County out of the main post
office in Pensacola. He was fired after his arrest.
   Postal inspectors said about 500 pieces of first class mail were
among the hoard of mainly third-class items. Ryan was charged with
failing to deliver 10 of the first-class items. Five of them were
tax notices from the Escambia property appraiser and the other five
were voter registration renewal cards from the county elections
supervisor.
   Ryan was allowed to plead guilty to two counts and, in exchange,
Alter dropped the other eight. Ryan could have received up to 10
years in prison and fines totaling $500,000 for the two charges he
admitted.

   WASHINGTON (A) _ The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and its
counterpart at the state level have barred employees from visiting
the government's uranium processing facility in Ohio because of the
risk of exposure to radioactivity, officials said Tuesday.
   EPA Regional Administrator Valdas Adamkus, in a letter last week,
said tests showed agency personnel were exposed to uranium oxide
when they went to the Feed Materials Production Center at Fernald
and that no federal EPA personnel would go to the site ``until this
health risk can be satisfactorily addressed.''
   The Ohio EPA followed suit Tuesday, said spokesman Allan Franks.
   After meeting with federal officials, state EPA Director Richard
Shank ``as a precautionary measure ... ordered our people who do
routine work to stay away from the site until a regular monitoring
system is set up,'' Franks said.
   But the plant's operator said Tuesday the plant is safe and that
routine urine tests to detect exposure ensure that the workers are
protected.
   ``We don't know what lab EPA is using, but we have the utmost
confidence in our program,'' said William H. Kelley, spokesman for
Westinghouse Materials of Ohio, the contractor running the plant for
the Energy Department.
   ``We have no reason to doubt the reliability of our program,''
Kelley said. ``We think the plant is safe.''
   Spokeswoman Ann Rowan said Adamkus discussed the issue Tuesday
with Joseph La Grone, Oak Ridge Operations Manager for the Energy
Department, which is in charge of the plant. The two agreed to meet
again on the subject but no date was set.
   ``What we said in the letter still holds,'' Rowan said.
   La Grone has offered to have the Energy Department finance new
urine tests ``to determine whether there is truly a potential
personnel exposure problem or in fact a laboratory problem.''
   Adamkus' letter was obtained Tuesday by the investigative staff
of Rep. Tom Luken, D-Ohio, who said he was upset that the EPA didn't
notify Fernald workers about the uranium oxide exposure threat.
   ``The public is totally unprotected when the monitor bars its own
inspectors from the premises,'' he said.
   The plant in southwest Ohio, about 18 miles from Cincinnati, is a
deteriorating foundry that processes uranium for use in the
government's nuclear weapons or as fuel for reactors.
   The plant is the subject of a lawsuit on behalf of 14,000 people
who live or work near the plant and believe their health has been
threatened by radioactive discharges into the air and water.
   Stanley Chesley, an attorney in the $300 million class-action
lawsuit against former plant operator NLO, Inc., said the EPA letter
demonstrates the need to proceed with the suit.
   ``I think it's an example of the ongoing trauma that continues to
plague this plant,'' Chesley said from Cincinnati.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military transport planes carried the
last Soviet soldiers home from Kabul on Tuesday, a Red Army officer
said, leaving a conscript Afghan army to defend the capital alone
for the first time in nine years.
   A few young Afghan soldiers, outside the airport gates, watched
the Soviet soldiers board the planes in gray dress uniforms and fur
hats.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfilev told a news
briefing in Moscow that Moslem guerrillas were massing outside major
cities _ including about 30,000 around Kabul _ but he did not say
whether they were preparing to attack.
   ``The hardliners in the opposition _ despite their threat to
occupy Kabul and other major cities _ would not seem confident in
their success,'' said Perfilev. ``Therefore (the opposition) lays
the stress on economics and propaganda to provoke discontent of the
local population.''
   The guerrillas, who began fighting after a communist coup in
1978, have surrounded and blockaded cold, hungry Kabul for months.
   They fired five rockets into the capital on Tuesday, the day
before the deadline for Soviet withdrawal. One killed four children
and an old man lined up in the snow for bread, the state radio
reported.
   Two landed at the airport in the first such attack on the
facility for more than a month. They struck near a runway but Soviet
soldiers still at the airport said no one was injured.
   Poland closed its Kabul embassy Tuesday and evacuated the few
remaining diplomats, as Hungary had done last week.
   Western nations, including the United States, closed their
legations earlier. The Soviets are keeping their embassy open but
the staff has been reduced from more than 300 to about 100.
   A council called by guerrilla leaders to choose an interim Moslem
government for Afghanistan convened Friday in Pakistan, but
deteriorated into arguments between moderates and fundamentalists,
including how to divide representation between the Sunni Moslem
majority and Shiite minority.
   Insurgents claim the government of President Najib will fall soon
after the Soviets are gone. The interim government would arrange
elections and adminster the country until they were held.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and an
estimated 115,000 were in the country when the withdrawal began May
15, 1988, under a U.N.-mediated agreement. Wednesday is the deadline
for all to be gone.
   Perfilev said the Soviet pullout was exactly on schedule and the
last Soviet soldier would be out of Afghan territory by the deadline.
   ``As of Feb. 15, not a single Soviet soldiers will be on Afghan
territory,'' Perfilev said.
   The last Red Army troops to leave Kabul had been stationed at the
airport, protecting an emergency Soviet airlift of food and fuel
that began last month. Soviet officers have said it would bring in
12,000 tons of food in the first half of February before stopping
because of the withdrawal.
   After manning their posts part of the day Tuesday, the Red Army
troopers changed from filthy green duty uniforms to dress grays and
filed into four huge Ilyushin 76 transports. About 80 men were seen
boarding.
   Lt. Col. Pyotr Sardarchuk, commander of the airport detail, was
asked the exact number in the group and said only ``all those who
are left.'' He shook the hands of the journalists watching and said
``Goodbye.''
   Soviet diplomats said several thousand other soldiers were
approaching the Soviet border from elsewhere in Afghanistan.
   Since the second stage of the withdrawal began in January, more
than 45,000 soldiers have left, the official Soviet news agency Tass
said. The last contingent of troops, led by Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov,
was expected to cross the bridge linking the town of Khairaton with
the city of Termez in the Soviet Union just before noon Wednesday
Moscow time (4 a.m. EST), according to the Soviet newspaper Trud.
   ``Tomorrow, you will see departing one of the last columns of our
military contingent under the command of Hero of the Soviet Union
Lt. Gen. B. Gromov,'' Trud said.
   A formal departure ceremony was held Monday, when 15 paratroopers
flew home. Another 450 soldiers left Kabul quietly Sunday, in a
convoy that set out on the Salang Highway during a heavy snowstorm.
   The other 20,000 troops once based in and around the city started
leaving early in January, either by air or by road up the Salang,
the only route from Kabul to the Soviet border 260 miles away. The
highway winds through the rugged Hindu Kush mountains, where the
guerrillas hide.
   Kabul's markets were crowded Tuesday and, except for the rockets,
the city appeared peaceful.
   Residents said, however, that unsigned letters delivered the past
few nights warned people to stay off the streets and away from the
airport beginning Wednesday. Many said they believed the letters
were from guerrilla forces outside the city.
   Some foreign diplomats suggested the letters might be the work of
Khadd, the Najib government's secret police.
   A U.N. airlift of food to Kabul has been suspended because
airlines that provided chartered planes fear for the safety of their
crews and aircraft.
   Guerrilla attacks and heavy snow have interrupted the arrival of
food, fuel and other supplies by road. Long lines form every day at
bread stores and gasoline stations in a city swollen by refugees to
a population of 2 million, twice its normal size.
   On Monday, a column of Afghan trucks loaded with Soviet-supplied
food and fuel reached Kabul from the north, and delivered wheat,
rice, kerosene and gasoline to the capital, Tass said.

   Drug czar-designate William J. Bennett, known
as one of the poorest members of President Reagan's Cabinet when he
was education secretary, hit paydirt during the few months he was
out of office and could have been a millionaire in a year if he had
stayed out.
   A lecture-circuit industry source said Bennett ``turned down $1.5
million in lectures in 1989'' when President Bush nominated him last
month to be director of National Drug Control Policy.
   During the few months after he left office Sept. 20, ``he earned
about $150,000 to $200,000, which was just getting his feet wet,''
said Don Walker, president of the New York-based Harry Walker
Agency, which got 30 percent of the fees that ranged from $15,000 to
$20,000 per lecture.
   ``I had a good few months in the private sector, the best three
to four months I ever had,'' Bennett said. ``I was told it would
have been a very good year for me.''

   A U.S. appeals court ruling requiring
wheelchair lifts on new public buses nationwide is the most
important victory yet for disabled Americans seeking access to mass
transit, plaintiffs' lawyers say.
   In its 2-1 ruling Monday, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
also upheld a lower court order that the federal Department of
Transportation eliminate a 3 percent cap on the amount of money
transit authorities must spend to improve transportation for the
disabled.
   ``The impact of the majority's decision will be very substantial
throughout the country and will interfere with the local
decision-making authority,'' Judge Morton I. Greenberg wrote in his
dissent. ``I feel the court is overreaching.''
   The majority opinion by Judge Carol Los Mansmann said a
Transportation Department regulation requiring all new buses to
accommodate wheelchairs conflicts with a regulation allowing
communities to offer only an alternative service to the disabled.

   South Florida's weather has been the envy of the
nation in recent weeks, but the abnormally hot, dry winter is
depleting the region's water supplies, drying up wetlands and
hastening the start of the wildfire season.
   From Lake Okeechobee to Key West, rainfall has been running only
about 50 percent of its historic average since December.
   Combine that with temperatures consistently in the low 80s, at
least 5 degrees hotter than normal, and you have the makings of a
drought.
   ``You might as well call it the south Florida desert,'' says
Henry LaRose, a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey office

   Mattel Inc. billed the black-tie affair as Barbie's ``Pink

<HEAD>`48 Hours' Turns Its Cameras on Homelessness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The genesis of the weekly CBS News program ``48
Hours'' was a riveting documentary called ``48 Hours on Crack
Street.''
   After a season on the air, ``48 Hours'' has fine-tuned its
unique, spot-documentary style and on Thursday takes on an equally
compelling subject _ homelessness. This installment of ``48 Hours''
produces some of its best reporting, camera work and editing yet.
   Correspondents Bernard Goldberg, Betsy Aaron, Harold Dow and
Harry Smith spent two days covering various aspects of the problem.
Their report is often touching, often enlightening, sometimes
depressing and ultimately inspiring. If this doesn't make you want
to go out and do something _ or at least lend a hand to the people
who do _ not much will.
   The story was covered in New York City, where a huge homeless
population finds it can live under the feet of a hardened populace
long accustomed to ducking beggars and stepping over derelicts.
   Goldberg spent his 48 hours with those with whom the rest of us
come into daily contact _ panhandlers and street people. ``Shorty''
takes Goldberg on a sometimes amusing trip through the subway
system, where he hops cars and announces to jaded passengers that he
is collecting funds to help the homeless. ``You gotta sell, and I'm
sellin' 'em,'' he tells Goldberg. On one train, Shorty is chagrined
to find he's competing with a guy in a monk's robe with a megaphone.
   But an hour of working the subway nets more than $22. As the
camera rolls, Goldberg asks Shorty _ ``just between you, me and the
people listening'' _ if he is really collecting money for the
homeless. Shorty, well aware of the camera, admits he's collecting
the money for himself.
   Cut to needy beggars. But also to a public that is suffering what
Goldberg calls ``compassion fatigue.'' A pathetic young, pregnant
woman begs coins from passers-by in Grand Central Terminal with
little luck. One well-to-do young woman buying a magazine walks
hurriedly away.
   ``Like you weren't even there,'' Goldberg whispers to the
pregnant woman.
   ``It don't feel too good,'' she says softly.
   Dow followed the final, sad journey of a young Polish immigrant,
from the street in Brooklyn where he succumbed to alcoholism and
froze to death, to his burial in a mass paupers' grave.
   Aaron went into the harrowing welfare hotels and produced some
heart-rending interviews with children who live in tiny rooms with
desperate parents and face possible death at the hands of strangers
outside. Aaron asks one young girl what she most fears most.
``Killing,'' the girl says.
   Aaron took a group of the children to a coffee shop and asked
them to tell her about their dream homes. The kids conjure up
poignant visions of big houses with swimming pools and backyards
filled with animals.
   Barry, a 13-year-old, left the hotels, he said, because his
mother and aunt did drugs. He lives on the streets, occasionally
bunking at the home of a friend. He writes poetry, but, he says,
trudging the streets with a small suitcase, ``There's a time when
you have to wonder which is better, life or death.''
   Before you're so depressed that your face hits the carpet, Harry
Smith provides a more uplifting report on a successful halfway
house, jointly operated by the government and a millionaire
businessman, Leonard Stern. There, 400 lucky families get shelter,
assistance and child care. Mary Scott had been living in a flophouse
near Times Square before getting a spot in the halfway house. Smith
took Mrs. Scott back to Times Square at night to talk about what it
had been like living there. Walking down the street, they encounter
a young, homeless woman. Mrs. Scott tries to tell the woman that
she, too, had been homeless and things could get better. Then, she
unexpectedly bursts into tears and hugs the woman. It's a subtle
testimonial that the only real solution is caring.
   Dan Rather concludes the broadcast with the results of a CBS-New
York Times poll in which 65 percent of those surveyed said they
thought government should do more to help the homeless.

<HEAD>A Smoldering of Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Signs of inflation are showing up in many of the
smaller businesses of America, where economic stresses sometimes
make their first appearance.
   Some are reporting small increases in wage pressure, which has
been at minimal levels through most of the six-year-old economic
expansion. Plans to raise prices are on a sharp ascent. Actual price
increases are rising also.
   The evidence is contained in the latest quarterly economic survey
of small and independent businesses, ranging from proprietorships to
companies that just fail to make listings of the 1,000 largest
companies.
   The survey, conducted by the National Federation of Independent
Business, ``shows the worst set of inflation numbers in the
expansion,'' said economist William C. Dunkelberg, who analyzes and
interprets the data.
   Dunkelberg, dean of Temple University's school of business and
management, said first-quarter plans to raise prices jumped 5
percentage points from fourth-quarter levels to 30 percent of all
companies in the survey.
   The latest percentage contrasts with only 19 percent in July
1986. Levels in some categories were even higher _ 38 percent among
wholesalers, followed by manufacturing at 37 percent and
professional service firms at 36 percent.
   Actual price increases rose to 29 percent, indicating that
companies were following through on plans. Although that percentage
was exceeded briefly early in 1988, Dunkelberg pointed out that it
was close to the highest since 1981.
   The data, gathered from more than 2,000 written responses from
the 500,000 business members of the federation, led Dunkelberg to
conclude that ``Although not rampant, the pace of price increases
clearly continues to gain momentum.''
   He said overall price increases in the general economy once again
may be held down by falling oil prices, but that ``without energy or
food prices declines, 1989's inflation rate will clearly be above
the 1988 experience.''
   He estimated the first-quarter inflation level would measure
about 4.9 percent on an annual basis, compared with a 1988 increase
in the consumer price index of 4.4 percent.
   In spite of some evidence of rising wages, Dunkelberg said,
``there is no evidence that gains are `alarming.''' He added,
however, that as inflation rose labor would demand larger wage
increases, ``which they feel can be funded out of the rather
impressive earnings being posted by many of our companies.''
   He said employment of the over-16 population is at record high
levels, and that small-firm job openings are at their highest for
the more than six years of expansion. ``Multiple job holding is
becoming quite common,'' he said.
   Overall, the small business optimism index, made up of such
factors as expected business conditions, current job openings,
expected credit conditions, and expected sales volume, barely
changed from the fourth quarter of 1988.
   The index, adjusted to eliminate seasonal variations, reached
102.8 early in the first quarter, compared with 102.9 in the
previous quarterly measurement in October 1988. It is based on the
year 1978 equally 100.
   The index, begun in the fourth quarter of 1974, reached its
highest point, 108.7, in the first quarter of 1984, rising from the
all-time low of 81.1 in the second quarter of 1980. Since 1984, the
index has dipped no lower than 99.5.
   An important factor in helping the index retain strength were
views on the economic outlook. Twenty-two percent said they
anticipated an improved economy in the next six months, up 3
percentage points from the earlier quarter.
   At the same time, negative views shrank. Only 12 percent said
they expected business conditions to deteriorate in the first half
of the year, a four-point decline from the final quarter of 1988.

   International chieftains of the Armenian Church,
once sharply at odds, say both the tribulation of the devastating
earthquake and a joint trip to the United States strengthened the
brotherly ties between them.
   But in the church's U.S. branch, strains of a prolonged split
still showed. Tendencies also appeared on one side here to minimize
the high-level calls to unity.
   These were among the mingled imprints left by an unprecedented
team visit last week of the two top Armenian prelates, Catholicos
Vasken I of the mother see in Soviet Armenia and Catholicos Karekin
II of the Cilician see in Lebanon.
   ``Catholicos'' means universal church head, similar to pope in
Roman Catholicism. However, the Armenian Church, like Eastern
Orthodoxy, uses more democratic procedures, such as election of
local bishops.
   The earthquake in Armenia had drawn the two church heads together
there to steady that flock. Then their mutual trip here, thanking
Americans for help, raised a sign for peace to a divided U.S. church.
   ``Together we have agreed on taking certain steps toward
cooperation, which is more important than disputes of the past,''
said Vasken, the now inclusively acknowledged head of the church,
based at Echmiadzin, Armenia.
   ``The situation is better,'' he added in an interview. ``We hope
that unity of the divided church here will take place in due
course.''
   Karekin, interviewed later, said: ``We're on the right track.
Closer collaboration will become a source of benefit to our people
and our church.
   ``People are disheartened with the conflict. The polarization in
the Armenian community has caused complications and duplications. It
is my conviction and hope that with the new trend toward brotherly
relationships, these disadvantages will gradually disappear.''
   Both prelates are imposing figures in black cassocks and veiled
hoods, their beards neatly trimmed. They carry gold-tipped staffs.
The Bucharest-educated Vasken is 80, while Oxford-educated Karekin
is a more vigorous 56.
   Asked if the earthquake disaster had firmed up their
relationship, Vasken said that this ``naturally intensified it.''
Paradoxically, good can come from tragedy, he said, and cited a
Latin saying, which goes:
   ``Through suffering you rise to the stars.''
   On that question, Karekin said the earthquake ``precipitated our
coming together. We both felt the same as one in that moment of
tragedy. Pain was the occasion. Love was the reason.''
   The Armenian church dates from 301 A.D., when Christianity was
officially established there, the first state church. About 2
million Armenians live there and 5 million more are dispersed around
the world, including America.
   Its approximately 700,000 Armenian church people are divided,
about half and half by some estimates, between two wings of the
church that have functioned separately for more than half a century.
   That split came in 1933, mostly over complex political-social
antagonisms resulting from the Echmiadzin see being under Soviet
controls and being vacant part of the time.
   One U.S. church wing, now headed by Archbishop Mesrop Ashjian,
chose to be under jurisdiction of the Cilician Catholicos, while the
other wing, now led by Archibhsop Torkom Manoogian, clung to
Echmiadzin oversight.
   Earlier ancient invasions had driven the chief see out of
Echmiadzin, and it was for centuries in Cilicia, which is now part
of Turkey. The catholicos there retained that title when in 1441 a
new catholicos was elected in Echmiadzin.
   Friction between the two sharpened in the mid-20th century over
jurisdictional questions in the divided U.S. church and elsewhere.
   Adhjian firmly applauds the unity strides manifested by the
church heads on their visit, saying ``they are working hand in hand,
heart to heart, in this beautiful deepening of the unity of the
church.''
   However, he said that ``on the local level things were done to
undermine this spirit,'' alluding to various shifts in arrangements
that left him or Karekin out of some proceedings.
   ``My heart is bleeding for this petty undermining of what they
are doing together,'' he said.
   Manoogian said the trip was not to enhance unity or cooperation
of the two wings, but to deal with rebuilding the devastated sector
of Armenia. ``It's wrong to connect this to issues of a divided
church,'' he said.
   On another matter the interview with Vasken had been scheduled as
a joint one including Karekin in arrangements made through a
Manoogian assistant. However, Karekin was not present, explaining
later he had not been informed about it.
   Manoogian, asked why Karekin was not included, said, ``It was not
feasible.'' He then added that the participation was decided by his
public relations committee.
   Karekin, brushing aside the tangled protocol, said that ``the
basic principle of working together has been confirmed by Catholicos
Vasken and myself.
   ``It is my hope and conviction that such exemplary cooperation
should have positive and effective impact to bring our people
together and contribute to strengthening the unity of our church.''

   The Lutheran co-chairman, retired Illinois Bishop Paul E.

of an agreed report, ``Implications of the Gospel.''
   Episcopal Bishop William G. Weinhauer of Western North Carolina,
Episcopal co-chairman, said accords must now be sought about the

   Abba Eban, Israeli's former foreign minister,
predicts that a dialogue between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization will open sometime in 1989.
   He told a recent meeting of Women's American ORT (Organization
for Rehabilitation Training), a national Jewish group:

   An international group of 10 churchmen and
statesmen has completed a series of firsthand appeals to industrial
nations to apply economic sanctions against South Africa for its
apartheid system.
   Such sustained economic pressures are the last hope for peaceful
change in that country, they maintained in visits with government
leaders in Western Europe, Japan and the United States.
   Their three-week tour, organized by the World Council of
Churches, was concluded in early February with meetings with
officials in Washington, D.C.
   The Rev. Canaan Banana, former president of Zimbabwe and head of
the groups, said: ``It's our considered view that economic
assistance of any kind helps sustain the apartheid system and
contributes to the suffering of the people there.''

   Five days before he starved to death,
14-year-old Eric Cottam ignored a 5-pound bag of apples perched an
arm's length from the day-old newspaper he was fetching from a
neighbor's porch.
   His emaciated body, concealed by bulky winter clothes, was
devouring its own muscle. But Eric clung to a fanatical conviction
that kept him from gobbling the neighbor's fruit to feed his empty
belly.
   His reclusive family, expelled by the Seventh-day Adventist
Church, reckoned God would help them. His father, fired as a
preacher, refused to buy food with $2,131.21 in cash in the house he
had stashed for God.
   ``He could have had all the apples he wanted. All he had to do
was reach out and take one,'' said Mary Petyo, who stored the
apples, a bag of carrots and a case of soda near the discarded
papers she saved for Eric.
   ``He just stared at me with this funny look on his face. He went
across the yard like someone was chasing him,'' said Mrs. Petyo.
``It shocked the daylights out of me when I found out he starved.''
   Eric was found Jan. 4, 42 days after the vegetarian family ate
its last supper. His face covered by a sheet, he lay in the only bed
in the family's two-story frame house near Wilkes-Barre in
northeastern Pennsylvania.
   The 5-foot-10 boy weighed 69 pounds, less than half what he
should have. His parents, Larry and Leona, are charged with his
murder and endangering the life of their daughter, Laura, 12, who
has been removed from their custody.
   The family was hospitalized for malnutrition. Cottam, 39, weighed
139 pounds; his wife, 37, 99 pounds. Both are 6 feet tall. The
girl's weight was not revealed.
   ``The boy was literally their hostage,'' said Margaret Singer, a
clinical psychologist who studies cult behavior as a professor at
the University of California at Berkeley.
   ``He probably had been so convinced he must not eat, he thought
God would smote him or his parents would punish him if he
disobeyed,'' she said.
   The Cottams lived in isolation on a dead-end street in this
community of 700 residents. They spurned offers of food and help
from church members and family.
   They fought a two-year legal battle to teach their children at
home rather than enroll them in public or parochial schools. Cottam
severed ties with his parents and in-laws.
   So no one noticed they were wasting away.
   The family refrigerator was unplugged and the phone disconnected.
The Cottams turned out the lights at dusk. Neighborhood kids knew
not to knock on Halloween because no one would answer the door.
   ``They always was loners. We tried to help that man over and
over, but we were turned away,'' said Frank Kowalski, the first
elder at the Slocum Seventh-day Adventist Church, one of four
churches near Wilkes-Barre where Cottam once preached.
   ``He tested God to the limit. There's no way you can sit home and
starve your kids and expect God to rain food out of the sky.''
   Nothing in the doctrine of the Adventists, a splinter group of
Baptists with 6 million members worldwide, explains the Cottams'
actions.
   ``We have no teaching that tells people to fast to death, reject
help, or withdraw from family and friends,'' said Fred Thomas, one
of the top officers of the church's world headquarters in
Washington, D.C. Adventists believe the second coming of Jesus
Christ is imminent, and they ban the use of alcohol, tobacco and
non-medical drugs.
   Cottam was fired as an unordained minister in 1985 for defying
church officials by yanking his children out of church schools. The
family had not attended church since then and was expelled in 1987.
   Although there wasn't a scrap of food in the house, Cottam had a
strongbox containing $2,131.21 in cash and bank books with $1,643.74
in savings.He told police the money ``belonged to God'' as a tithe.
   Larry Cottam grew up in Stockton, Calif., and converted to
Adventism, his wife's religion, shortly before they were married in
1972.
   ``I had a funny feeling about Larry. He was nice and polite, but
there was still something about Larry I didn't like. He looked like
a criminal,'' his father-in-law, John Van Renselaar, told the
Wilkes-Barre Times Leader.
   ``I felt he wanted to start a cult or something. Every time he
got on the phone he'd start preaching and I'd say to Leona, `Larry
is a religious fanatic.'''
   Cottam graduated from Union College, an Adventist school in
Lincoln, Neb., and got a master's degree in divinity from the
church's Andrews University in Michigan.
   The family, after living in six states in 16 years, settled here
in 1983. Cottam tended four churches while awaiting ordination.
   Then the trouble started.
   The Cottams pulled their children out of a one-room Adventist
school and tried to fire the teacher in 1984. The teacher said the
children wanted to work on the floor instead of at their desks,
insisted on printing instead of writing and balked at learning
definitions of words.
   To end the squabbling and give Cottam seasoning under another
minister, the church transferred him that summer to western
Pennsylvania.
   By Christmas, the children again were removed from the church
school. The Cottams claimed the children had been sexually abused by
their former teacher. They said she wore a devil's mask and danced a
satanic jig.
   A church investigation found no wrongdoing. The teacher, who had
brought a large wooden mask from Kenya to class, suffered from
epilepsy and once had a seizure that frightened the children.
   Larry Cottam was fired in October of 1985 and moved back here,
working as a truck driver.
   More is known about young Eric Cottam in death than in life.
   He kept a weather vane and rain guage in his garden and dreamed
of being a meteorologist, according to postmaster Michael Petyo, who
gave the boy a weather band radio.
   For the Cottam kids, there wasn't much chance to play with
others. Their mother would call them inside.
   ``They didn't want anybody else around,'' said a neighbor, Carol
Laurer. ``Maybe they was embarassed because (the father) wasn't a
minister anymore. (But) how can you sit there and watch your
children wasting away and not do anything?''
   An autopsy found no disease or condition that would have
prevented Eric from eating. Coroner George Hudock Jr. ruled the
death a homicide caused by starvation.
   The boy's heart was brown and atrophied instead of reddish-purple
and vibrant. The normal layer of fat around his stomach had been
exhausted. His empty intestine had paper thin walls.
   ``He had no energy to live. The flame of life flickered out,''
Hudock said. ``He looked like a concentration camp victim from
Dachau or Auschwitz.''

   Eric, his sister and his parents hadn't eaten a crumb since Nov.
22 when the food in the house ran out.
   His father had been fired from his trucking job months earlier,
in March, after arguing with his boss. ``He was radical,'' the boss,
Roy Dieffenbach, recalled. ``His attitude was, `God will provide.'''
   The gnawing pang of hunger goes away within a week after a person
stops eating, experts on starvation say. Dreams of food are
accompanied by feelings of cold, fatigue and lethargy.
   The Cottams had no Thanksgiving feast or Christmas dinner, and
Eric apparently died Jan. 3, a day after his father tried to comfort
and warm him by lying in bed with him all day.
   Police weren't called until Jan. 4. Larry Cottam managed to
shamble the 106 paces across the yard to use a neighbor's phone. The
mother and daughter, too weak to stand, lay on sofa cushions.
   ``I didn't even recognize him,'' said Ruth Rineheimer, a widow
who answered Cottam's knock. ``His face was terrible thin. He looked
like an old man. His clothes were real baggy. If I had seen a man
like that in the streets, I'd have said he was a bum.''
   In a television interview from his hospital room, Larry Cottam
explained: ``I don't hold God responsible. The error was on my part,
not God's. My wife and I feel terrible about Eric's death, but my
faith in God is not shaken.''
   The churches where Cottam once ministered took up a collection to
pay for Eric's burial.
   The Cottams are jailed in lieu of $100,000 bond each. They are to
be arraigned Tuesday on charges of murder, two counts each of
endangering a person and two counts each of endangering the welfare
of a child.
   ``Our allegations are the parents had a duty to provide food for
their children,'' said Luzerne County District Attorney Correale
Stevens. ``I don't know of any religion that suggests it's all right
to starve your children to death.''

   The judge who dismissed Suffolk County's
racketeering case against the Long Island Lighting Co. on Monday
granted its nearly 1 million ratepayers the right to sue the utility
as a class.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein's order cleared way for the
ratepayers' attorney, Judith Vladeck, to accept a proposed
settlement. But no settlement was reached after 10{ hours of
negotiations involving Vladeck, LILCO attorneys and the
court-appointed mediator, Kenneth Feinberg, ended late Monday night.
   ``We have not reached a settlement but we made excellent
progress,'' said Joseph McDonnell, a LILCO vice president and
company spokesman.
   He said the negotiators were very close to reaching an agreement,
however, and would meet again Tuesday afternoon.
   The proposed agreement calls for reductions in planned increases
in electric rates by $400 million during the next decade and could
lead to the closing of the Shoreham nuclear plant.
   Vladeck, who was officially designated by the judge as the class
representative, said during a break in the talks that Weinstein's
class certification was ``a useful step'' in the negotiations.
   Weinstein noted in his order that if his dismissal of Suffolk
County's suit is reversed on appeal, LILCO will now be liable to pay
the ratepayers at least $4 billion in damages.
   ``Should this court's dismissal of Suffolk's claims be reversed
and the jury's verdict against LILCO sustained on appeal, LILCO will
be forced into bankruptcy since its assets will not suffice to pay
the judgment,'' Weinstein said.
   He previously had severed the ratepayers' case from the trial of
Suffolk County's suit, which ended Dec. 5 with a jury finding that
LILCO lied to state officials to obtain rate increases and awarding
Suffolk County $22.8 million in damages.
   Weinstein on Saturday dismissed the county's lawsuit and the jury
award on the grounds that the racketeering statute did not apply.
   Lawyers for the Long Island county did not participate in
Monday's negotiations. Their portion of the proposed settlement
includes a provision that LILCO would agree to close its Shoreham
nuclear power plant if Gov. Mario Cuomo embraced the proposal within
15 days.
   The county legislature is scheduled to discuss the proposed
settlement on Tuesday.
   Construction of the Shoreham plant, located 60 miles east of
Manhattan, began in 1973 and was completed a decade later at a cost
of more than $4 billion. Its total cost now stands at $5.4 billion.
   LILCO has not been able to obtain an operating license from the
federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, largely because of opposition
by the state and county who claim Long Island could not be safely
evacuated during a nuclear emergency.

   Rising interest rates are likely to push more
savings and loans into insolvency and raise the cost of the $90
billion federal bailout proposed by the Bush administration,
economists and banking analysts say.
   When interest rates rise, thrifts have to pay higher rates to
hold and attract deposits. The money they earn on their mortgage
loans also rises, but not as much or as quickly.
   Each percentage point rise in interest rates will add about $6
billion to the cost of the S&amp;L bailout, according to estimates by
SNL Securities of Hoboken, N.J. That estimate includes the higher
rates the government will have to pay on the bonds it plans to issue
to fund the bailouts.

   Mexico's foreign reserves plummeted by 50
percent to around $8 billion last year, one of the most severe costs
of an otherwise successful anti-inflation program, according to a
private think tank.
   Investor disbelief that the government would maintain the
program's freeze on the peso-dollar exchange rate was a leading
cause of capital flight, the Center for Private Sector Economic
Studies said in a review of the Mexican anti-inflation program.
   Investors fearing a sudden peso devaluation made advance
purchases of capital goods from abroad, sustaining economic activity
and increasing imports of items such as machinery despite the
government's efforts to slow it, the report said.

<TEXT>
   Barbie turns 30 years old this week. G.I. Joe
marches on at 25. But Mr. Game Show? The Inhumanoids?
   Flops.
   ``There are a lot of flops,'' toy company analyst Walter
Kirchberger said Monday, the start of the industry's weeklong Toy
Fair. ``Something like 80 percent of the new-toy introductions turn
out to be flops.''
   That makes this Flop Week in the toy business. Manufacturers have
packed their Manhattan showrooms with an estimated 5,000 new games
and toys, all clamoring for slices of a nearly $13 billion pie.
   Most won't last. ``You'll see a lot of products at the Toy Fair
this week that you won't see next year,'' said Harold Vogel, an
analyst for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. ``Most toys do not make it into a
second season.''
   One reason, said Vogel: ``There's lots of junk.''
   Quality's not the sole criterion; some entries are undone by
outrageous circumstance alone. ``The Evel Knievel doll did very well
when it came out. Then it just fell apart,'' said Vogel. He guessed
that the real Knievel's conviction of a baseball-bat assault did not
help the toy.
   Other casualties are harder to explain. Barbie dances on the
grave of a pretender named Gem. G.I. Joe's tough as ever. But the
Inhumanoids _ a toady group from the center of the Earth _ withered
in the light of day.
   No one knows why.
   ``That is the $64 million question in the toy industry. And in
most other industries,'' said Kirchberger, of Paine Webber Group.
``Nobody sets out to make a bad movie. It just happens. It's the
same thing with toys.''
   Toy makers trim losses by making models of most new items,
holding back on production until orders come in. ``The weeding-out
process starts early,'' said Jodi Levin, of the Toy Manufacturers of
America. ``Sometimes the kids don't even get to pass judgment.''
   But there have been some epic bombs. Mr. Game Show, a big hit at
last year's Toy Fair, is a goner now. Kirchberger gave the eulogy:
   ``It was modeled after a TV game show; there was a figure of a
host, he spoke, he'd ask you questions, you'd push buttons to
indicate your answer, he'd tell you if you were right or wrong and
how much you won. Very clever. Wrong price point, wrong
I-don't-know-what. Mr. Game Show didn't make it.''
   Then there was Michael Jackson's Zoo from View-Master Ideal, a
menagerie of stuffed animals inspired by the rock star's
predilection for offbeat pets.
   ``He even went on tour with his chimp. So we tried,'' said
View-Master's Jeremy Jacobs. ``We had the chimp appearing in stores
in Southern California. We had quite a few good promotions, but we
just couldn't move the product.''
   Or consider Golden Girl and the Guardian of the Gemstones. ``The
concept was action figures for little girls. There were 12 beautiful
female warriors with shields and swords,'' said David Galoob, of
Lewis Galoob Toys Inc.
   ``The trade bought in very, very heavily. And what we discovered
was that little girls didn't want to play with warrior figurines,''
Galoob recalled. ``It was a tremendous stiff.''

   Analysts say Consolidated Freightways Inc.
faces a major challenge in trying to turn around troubled Emery Air
Freight Corp., which it is acquiring in a deal worth an estimated
$230 million.
   ``They have their work cut out for them,'' David Guthrie, an
analyst with Morgan Keegan Co., said Monday after the announcement.
``It's possible they made a good investment; it's possible they made
a big mistake.''
   Consolidated announced it had agreed to buy all outstanding Emery
common stock for $7.75 a share in cash and all outstanding Emery
preferred stock for $21.10 a share in cash. Emery has about 24
million common shares and 1.1 million preferred shares outstanding.
   The agreement has been approved by the boards of directors of
both companies, said Consolidated, based in Menlo Park, Calif.
   The combination will make Consolidated one of the nation's
largest air-freight operators.
   Analysts said Emery never regained its competitive edge after a
series of strategic miscalculations over the past decade.
   The company, which lost $9.95 million on revenue of $318.8
million in the third quarter of 1988, took on more than $300 million
in debt to buy rival Purolator Courier Corp. in 1987.
   Although analysts roundly criticized the $348 million Purolator
purchase, Emery's problems really began when it waited until 1982 to
purchase its own planes and adopt the hub-and-spoke distribution
system used by industry leader Federal Express Corp., Guthrie said.
   Before then, Emery shipped freight on commercial airlines.
   ``Essentially they waited too long and let Federal Express steal
a substantial part of the market,'' Guthrie said. ``From that point
on, they were never able to catch up.''
   Consolidated and Emery specialize in shipping large packages and
freight that Federal Express, an overnight package-delivery service,
generally does not handle.
   Paul Schlesinger, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette,
said he thought Consolidated paid too much for Emery, ``because
there's so little in the way of hard assets that Emery still owns.''
He noted that Emery sold its fleet of planes on a lease-back
arrangement in order to raise cash.
   ``It's going to be complicated to turn that thing around,''
Schlesinger said.
   Emery, based in Wilton, Conn., was founded in 1946 by John Emery
Sr. When his son, John C. Emery Jr., who started as a truck driver
with the company, suddenly announced his retirement as chairman and
chief executive officer in December 1987, analysts saw it as an
indication that the company was positioning itself to be sold.
   Emery Jr. was replaced by William F. Souders, a board member who
had no previous experience in the air freight industry.
   The combined company will operate under the name ``Emery
Worldwide, a CF Company,'' said Lary Scott, president of
Consolidated.
   ``We have every confidence that this business combination will
offer customers the best service available,'' Souders said in a
statement.
   Consolidated does business in long-haul trucking, air freight,
regional trucking, and rail piggyback and ocean intermodal services.
Its 1988 revenues totaled $2.7 billion.
   Emery provides air courier and cargo service and has 17,000
employees worldwide.
   Consolidated said it plans to centralize operations in Dayton,
Ohio, where Emery operates its ``superhub.'' About 1,700 people are
employed at the hub.
   Emery spokeswoman Jennifer Davis said Consolidated plans business
as usual at the hub, with no changes in job levels at this time.

<HEAD>Higher Interest Rates Will Raise Cost Of S&amp;L Bailout</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The savings and loan industry, hypersensitive to
high interest rates, is being squeezed by a rise in rates that is
likely to drive more thrifts into insolvency and raise the cost to
taxpayers of the Bush administration's proposed $90 billion federal
bailout.
   `Increases in interest rates will have a substantial impact on
the number of savings and loans which will fall into the category of
either weakened or insolvent thrifts,'' Kevin Gottlieb, staff
director of the Senate Banking Committee, said Monday.
   When interest rates rise, thrifts have to pay higher rates to
hold and attract deposits. The money they earn on their
variable-rate mortgage loans also rises, but not as much or as
quickly.
   Each percentage point rise in interest rates will add about $6
billion to the cost of the S&amp;L bailout, according to estimates by
SNL Securities of Hoboken, N.J.
   That estimate includes the higher rates the government will have
to pay on the bonds it plans to issue to fund the bailouts.
   The estimate does not include the likelihood that higher rates
will push more S&amp;Ls into insolvency, the firm says. Thrifts with
more red ink on their books also will cost more to bail out.
   ``Taxpayers will foot a much larger proportion of the bill than
what's being announced. It may be double, even,'' said Jim Marks,
publisher of SNL Quarterly Thrift Digest.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills _ an alternative to S&amp;L
certificates of deposit for big investors _ have shot up to 8.8
percent from 5.6 percent a year ago.
   Edward J. Kane, a professor at Arizona State University, said
Monday that according to a stricter accounting standard than the one
used by the government, 750 thrifts were insolvent by last
September. Since then, rising interest rates have helped push
another 50 to 100 into their ranks, he said.
   Higher interest rates have caused a hemorrhage of thrift
deposits. Net deposit withdrawals rose in December to a record of
more than $8 billion, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Friday.
Total deposits were about $972 billion.
   Some thrifts have concluded it is not financially worthwhile to
raise their rates on deposits high enough to keep all their
depositors.
   With fewer deposits, the thrifts have less money available to
make new mortgage loans, but they would rather shrink and remain
profitable.
   Because deposits are counted as liabilities on the books, thrifts
can actually improve their net worth by allowing deposits to bleed
away, said Edwin Gray, president of Chase Federal Bank in Miami and
former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   A silver lining in the S&amp;L crisis is that thrifts are somewhat
better prepared to cope with high interest rates now than they were
in the early 1980s, the last time interest rates soared. Most
mortgages in their portfolios have adjustable rates, so mortgage
payments rise when rates rise.
   In September 1981, only about 29 percent of thrifts' mortgages
had adjustable rates. As of this past September, the proportion was
74 percent, according to James Barth, chief economist of the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board.
   Stuck with fixed-rate mortgages and soaring short-term interest
rates, 85 percent of thrifts were unprofitable in 1981, Barth said.
As of September, the proportion of unprofitable thrifts was 30
percent, he said.
   Some thrifts also have taken steps to protect themselves from
interest-rate fluctuations by raising some of their money through
issuing bonds instead of taking in deposits.
   When interest rates rise, the thrifts don't have to raise
payments on their bonds, while they do have to raise payments on
their deposits. As of last September, about 11 percent of thrifts'
capital came from borrowings such as bond issues, up from 3 percent
in 1980, Barth said.
   Troubled thrifts have a harder time using such defensive
strategies. It costs more for them to issue bonds and they have to
have them fully backed with collateral.
   Also, troubled thrifts cannot easily afford to offer the
incentives that would cause customers to choose adjustable-rate
mortgages instead of fixed-rate mortgages, Gray said.
   Troubled institutions, which have the highest proportion of
mortgage loans that aren't being paid, are squeezed the worst by
rising rates. Their cost of funds is rising along with everyone
else's but they have less of an offsetting gain on their loan
portfolios.

<HEAD>Bergland Says Bush Playing Reagan on Farm Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is jeopardizing the quality of
life in rural America by following the ``failed ideological
policies'' of his predecessor, says co-op leader and former
agriculture secretary Bob Bergland.
   ``He follows an incredibly popular president _ one who cut taxes,
talked frugally but spent freely, and who then placed all the blame
on either Jimmy Carter or the Congress,'' Bergland said Monday.
   ``Today's unconscionable and unnecessary savings and loan crisis,
which one way or the other will cost American consumers $100
billion, could have been averted had the Reagan administration
approached deregulation more thoughtfully,'' he said.
   Rural areas have problems, too, including ``strangulation of our
air transportation options, thousands of miles of roads and bridges
that are crumbling,'' and huge gaps in television service, Bergland
said.
   ``We, too, live with illiteracy, the homeless, rising health care
costs,'' he said. ``We share many of the challenges of city life.''
   Bergland is executive vice president and general manager of the
National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. More than 11,000
representatives of local cooperatives are attending an annual
meeting here through Wednesday.
   Plans of recent years to overhaul the federal power program,
including the possible sale of some large facilities to private
interests, also came in for criticism.
   Bergland, who spoke at the opening day's session, is a former
member of Congress and was secretary of agriculture during the
Carter administration.
   The delegates represent 1,000 consumer-owned rural electric
systems which serve an estimated 25 million people in 46 states. The
co-op system was started in the 1930s and used federal loans from
the Rural Electrification Administration, or REA, to put electricity
on the nation's farms.
   Critics have contended for years that the job is done and that
it's time to abolish REA and put rural power co-ops into the private
domain. However, advocates contend the task continues and federal
support is needed to maintain, upgrade and expand facilities.
   Bergland said Bush has ``rubber stamped Ronald Reagan's last
budget proposals for REA,'' an agency of the Agriculture Department.
The plan would shift from loan guarantees by the Federal Financing
Bank to REA guarantees for private loans.
   ``REA is a lending program, not a spending program,'' he said.
``The truth of the matter is that nowhere in the federal budget for
REA or the U.S. Department of Agriculture are you given any credit
for the money you pay back on your loans each year. What does show
up, as spending, are the loan levels for the fiscal year.''
   Bergland said that last fiscal year the U.S. Treasury ``realized
$4 billion more than it advanced'' to the nation's rural electric
systems.
   ``And once again, the forces that have sought to dismantle the
federal power system and drive up rates on power generated from
federal projects have triumphed,'' he said. ``There is little
difference, if any, between the Bush administration proposals and
those of the Reagan administration.''
   Bergland said he is not convinced that the United States would be
better served ``by turning federal power over to profit-driven
private interests.''
   He added: ``There is no basis, except for an ideological one, for
dismantling the power marketing agencies and artificially boosting
federal power rates to so-called `market levels,' and we will oppose
any such moves with all our strength.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shimmering pink carpet was rolled out in front
of the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center on Monday night for
1,200 guests attending an unusual gala.
   Inside, women received wristlets of pink roses as they entered a
hall adorned with pink festoons. Waiters served pink champagne, or
rosy-hued Perrier if guests preferred, to accompany canapes served
on platters bedecked with pink orchids.
   Lights flashed as cameras recorded several stage and television
celebrities taking part in the festivities.
   But the star of the event didn't blink an eye. That's not
surprising _ she was Barbie, the doyen of fashion dolls who was
being honored for 30 years as a phenomenally successful toy.
   Mattel Inc. billed the black-tie affair as Barbie's ``Pink
Jubilee'' anniversary party. Company executives said the lavish
party was a fitting tribute to a toy that has shown such remarkable
longevity _ and profitability.
   ``Whatever the cost is, I think it's worth it,'' said John W.
Amerman, Mattel's chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``We don't spare the expense in presenting Barbie in a
first-class way,'' added Robert Sansone, Mattel's president.
   Although her popularity has waned now and then, Barbie has never
fallen completely out of favor. She has been one of the most
consistent toys in an industry notorious for quickly fading fads.
Barbie was the nation's second biggest selling toy last year, after
Nintendo video games, according to Toy &amp; Hobby World magazine.
   Each year, Barbie dolls pull in $450 million to $500 million in
revenue for Mattel.
   Part of the doll's success is credited to her adaptability. As
lifestyles and fashions changed over the years, Barbie's clothes and
accessories kept pace.
   Guests at Barbie's party were entertained by teen-aged girls
performing the ``Barbie Rap'' and doing the ``Barbie'' dance. The
rap number was interspersed with spoken tributes from several female
celebrities, including singer Melba Moore and actresses Allison
Smith, of the television show ``Kate &amp; Allie,'' and Nancy Dussault,
who has performed in the Broadway play ``Into The Woods.''
   New York Mayor Edward Koch marked the occasion by sending fan
mail. Mattel's Sansone read the mayor's letter before introducing
the entertainment.
   ``She has always reflected the times, and today stimulates the
imagination and delight of another generation,'' Koch wrote.
``Barbie's appearance in a wide variety of ethnic guises makes her a
great toy for New York, a city which draws unique energy from its
unparalleled ethnic diversity.''
   An audio-visual retrospective of the doll's 30 years set to tunes
on the pop charts during the different periods catalogued Barbie's
numerous wardrobe changes.
   In the early 1960s, a conservatively dressed Barbie was depicted
as a wholesome 21-year-old with a fun-loving streak who turned up,
bikini-clad, at beach parties every so often.
   Later on, Barbie donned ``mod'' clothing and her normally
clean-cut boyfriend Ken grew his hair almost shoulder length.
   More recently, Barbie has become a briefcase-toting career woman.
   This year finds Barbie characterized as a super star, decked out
in a star-encrusted tulle gown as the reigning queen of the fashion
doll world.

Year</HEAD>

   Caution: Letting children read this may be
hazardous to household budgets. It contains pocketbook-sensitive toy
information.
   Thousands of toys are debuting this week at the industry's annual
bash in Manhattan and loads of old favorites are keeping them
company.
   From ultra-sophisticated computer gizmos to things as basic as
the abacus, the spotlight is shining on toys of every type
imaginable. Expensive toys that generous parents prefer to think of
as investments are on display along with low-priced items to please
more frugal gift-givers.
   Not all of the toys introduced with much fanfare at the American
International Toy Fair will earn a place for themselves on store
shelves.
   Their fate depends on how good an impression they make on the
throng of previewers attending the trade show during its 10-day
engagement.
   But the store buyers and industry analysts who traditionalIy
crowd into the Toy Center on Fifth Avenue each year don't always
perceive the potential popularity of new toys. The final arbiters
are customers, particularly children _ the ficklest consumers of all.
   Here's a selection of just a few new toys and games and
enhancements of existing ones being touted at Toy Fair:
   _To capitalize on the current video game craze, several
manufacturers have developed accessories for the Nintendo
Entertainment System. Broderbund Software Inc. has come up with
something called U-Force, which recalls paraphernalia in Flash
Gordon films. It allows Nintendo game players to control activity on
the screen through motion of their bodies within a ``force field.''
   _The doll category has numerous competitors, including ones with
attributes such as speech or motion. Some have hair that changes
color in the sun.
   Mattel Inc.'s Barbie is embedded in the bedrock of the toy
business and is going strong in her 30th year. In her 1989
incarnation, she boasts more glamorous outfits and hair with a
memory so that even the most intricate coiffeurs will endure until
the next styling.
   Tyco Toys Inc.'s Oopsie Daisy doll has been a big hit in Canada,
so the company thinks it stands a good chance in the United States.
Modeled after a 9-month-old infant, she crawls on her hands and
knees and can turn her head.
   People with athletic aspirations may be interested in the Flo-Jo
doll, inspired by Olympic champion Florence Griffith Joyner, from
LJN Toys Ltd. The doll comes with applique fingernails; long,
painted nails are one of the athlete's trademarks.
   _Militaristic toys have supporters. Despite a 25 percent decline
in sales of action figures last year, G.I. Joe proved to be a sturdy
fellow and will be promoted again in 1989, his 25th year of
make-believe missions.
   Hasbro Inc. says Pentagon experts gave guidance in the
development of the company's new Flying Fighters. These hand-held
mock jets, modeled after the F-14 Tomcat and other military
aircraft, make realistic engine, radar lock-up and gunfire sounds.
Each Flying Fighter comes with pictures of the actual members of the
squadrons flying the genuine jets.
   _Radio-controled vehicles have had a large following. Tyco says
its Turbo Typhoon Hovercraft is the first vehicle to operate both on
land and water. The craft can travel at speeds up to 17 miles per
hour on a cushion of air-inflated pontoons.
   _The games class has numerous new entrants, many for grown-ups.
   Several educational games are being introduced, including Suntex
International Inc.'s Twenty-Four, which takes a fun approach to
improving players' mathematical skills.
   A game called Adverteasing from Cadaco, a division of Rapid
Mounting &amp; Finishing Co., should appeal to anyone with a knack for
remembering slogans and jingles, while the Headlines Game, from U.S.
Playing Card Co., tests players' abilities to come up with concise,
catchy summaries of subjects.
   Billionaire developer Donald Trump is pitching a real estate
board game on behalf of Milton Bradley. But if the ups and downs of
real financial markets get too confusing, people can take a quick
remedial course by playing Bulls and Bears, a game developed by
economist Mario Fischel.
   If the wide selection of toys and games hitting the market each
year depresses those who feel they can't afford to keep up with
what's new, they can turn to It's Only Money. Created by
Lobsenz-Stevens Inc., the game takes players on a shopping spree
through a mall and it offers them a real-life opportunity to win
$400,000 in actual prizes.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators are searching for a Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. stockbroker who allegedly disappeared with
millions of dollars after going on a golfing trip earlier this
month, according to a report published today.
   Unidentified brokerage sources said Walter F. Curran, 45, of
Wellesley, convinced clients to invest between $5 million and $10
million directly with him, rather than with the firm, The Boston
Globe reported today.
   Curran reportedly told his colleagues he was going on an
out-of-state golfing trip and has not contacted his wife since.
   Jack Cloherty, a spokesman for the FBI, said federal
investigators have been working to trace Curran's steps since last
week.
   In the weeks leading up to his disappearance, Curran reportedly
stopped making payments on $475,000 in personal loans from the Bank
of Boston and apparently made a series of deposits and withdrawals
to his account that investigators are studying.
   Marty Meehan of the state Securities Division said Dean Witter
Reynolds may have violated a state law by not notifying state
officials of the case until Monday.
   ``They were aware of the situation a week ago,'' he said. ``We're
concerned about the failure of a major brokerage firm to promptly
notify us of a potential violation of the law by one of their
registered brokers,'' he said.
   Fellow brokers described Curran as one of the office's top money
makers. He joined the Boston office in February 1981.

   Belgium's central bank Tuesday slightly
boosted a key interest rate for the fourth time this month and the
sixth time this year.
   The National Bank raised the rate on the three-month treasury
bill 0.15 percentage point to 8.10 percent.
   The bank also raised the rates on one and two-month treasury
bills by 0.10 perentage point each to 7.7 percnet and 7.9 percent
respectively, and that on four-month certificates by 0.35 point to
8.10 percent.
   Belgian interest rates have been climbing steadily since early
1989 amid a general rise in rates worldwide.
   The national bank issued no comment on Tuesday's increases.

<HEAD>FBI To Investigate Leading Edge Finances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six computer dealers have filed a petition in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court against Leading Edge Products Inc., claiming they
paid in advance for computers they never received.
   In the request, the dealers allege they paid a total of $779,000
for computers they never got.
   The FBI said it will investigate Leading Edge's business
practices to determine if there has been a violation of federal law,
according to Tuesday's Boston Globe.
   The Canton, Mass.-based company, which pioneered the market for
low-priced IBM personal computer clones, stopped delivering
computers last month, leaving hundreds of dealers owed millions of
dollars.
   Leading Edge demanded advance payment, an unusual move that
dealers say they agreed to because of the large demand for the
computers.
   The dealers who signed the bankruptcy petition are seeking to
freeze Leading Edge's assets, pending a thorough examination of the
company's finances and business dealings. Leading Edge reportedly
owes dealers more than $10 million.
   ``From my viewpoint, at least we'll know the score very
shortly,'' said Larry Stone, president of OmniTek Computers Inc. of
Portland, Ore., and a co-signer of the petition. ``We think there is
maybe something there that we don't see and don't fully understand.''
   Stone said Leading Edge owes him $190,000 and that he decided to
sign the petition when ``it became pretty apparent the action was
going to proceed with or without me.''
   Earlier this month, Stone organized a Chicago meeting of 50
Leading Edge dealers to consider the company's signed agreement to
sell its brand name and major business to a computer dealer based in
Riviera Beach, Fla.
   Michael Shane, founder and president of Leading Edge, said he was
disappointed by the petition in bankruptcy court.
   ``We cannot let 2 percent of the dealers divert attention from
accomplishing what's in the best interest of all the dealers,''
Shane said.
   Shane said he was unaware of any FBI plan to investigate his
company.
   Leading Edge is currently under a temporary restraining order
issued for unrelated litigation prohibiting the company from selling
its assets.
   Leading Edge Products is the parent company of Leading Edge
Hardware Products.

<HEAD>London's Stock Exchange Imposes New Trading Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The London Stock Exchange has introduced new rules
to encourage trading in large blocks of shares.
   The rules, some of which went into effect Monday, are the first
major changes in the way trading is conducted in London since ``Big
Bang,'' the 1986 deregulation of Britain's financial markets. The
exchange has made minor variations in the past two years.
   Under the latest changes, investment firms that make markets in
British shares would no longer be required to trade with each other.
   Market makers formerly had to trade with clients, agency brokers
and other market makers at the prices and volumes they quoted on the
exchange's trading system, called Stock Exchange Automated
Quotation. But they complained that other market makers dumped stock
on them.
   Among the other changes, details of large trades, about $175,000
or more, will be publicly reported the following day instead of
within minutes. That rule goes into effect within two weeks.
   The exchange's 25-member council approved the rule changes on
Jan. 9.
   ``It's to improve the liquidity of the marketplace,'' said an
exchange spokesman, who wasn't identified, in accordance with
British practice.
   ``Some market makers were no longer prepared to offer large
volume quotations because they felt that other market makers were
simply taking advantage of them without reciprocating the deal.''
   Since Big Bang many firms have suffered big losses because of the
fierce competition and because the volume of trading dropped sharply
after the October 1987 stock market crash.
   Under Big Bang _ the bulk of which took place Oct. 27, 1986 _
brokers were allowed to make markets in stocks, an activity
previously restricted to firms called ``jobbers.''

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. said today it plans to establish a
joint venture with Kobe Steel Ltd. of Japan to operate the U.S.
company's specialty bar and tubular products plant at Lorain, Ohio.
   Each partner will own 50 percent of the joint venture, which will
buy the Lorain plant and become the new employer of the
approximately 3,000 workers who operate the plant.
   USX withheld the proposed purchase price in a printed statement.
   The deal will be the first investment in the U.S. steel industry
for Kobe, Japan's leading producer of steel bar products.
   A Kobe official in Tokyo said the partnership will help the
company adjust to steel product requirements of Japanese vehicle
makers in the United States.
   Steel bar is used to produce a variety of heavy components for
cars, trucks and machinery.
   ``This brings together the premier integrated bar producers of
the United States and Japan to create a business second to none in
the world's quality bar industry,'' said Thomas C. Graham, president
of the USS division of USX, the nation's largest steelmaker.
   ``The venture will continue and expand current modernization
activities at the plant to enhance quality and service to bar
customers,'' he said. ``A major thrust will be to increase the
plant's sales to the automotive industry, including the Japanese and
other foreign-owned automotive plants around the nation.''
   USX said further improvements at Lorain could include the
installation of a continuous bloom caster, a machine that molds
molten steel for further processing. Casters are considered almost
essential equipment for the efficient production of consistently
high-quality steel.
   The Lorain plant's two seamless pipe mills and a blast furnace
are now undergoing improvements worth $50 million.
   USX will continue to market Lorain's tubular products, while the
joint venture company will market the bar products.
   The Lorain Works has been the only bar making operation at USX
since the company reorganized its steel division in 1987. Lorain's
seamless tube production is considered part of the three-plant
Pittsburgh Works.

   General Motors Corp. today reported its
fourth-quarter 1988 earnings soared 67.3 percent over the same
period the year before, and last year's profits set a company
record, based in part on record overseas net income.
   The nation's largest automaker said it earned $1.39 billion, or
$4.25 a share, in the final three months of last year, compared with
$836 million, or $2.36 per share, during the same time in 1987.
   For all of 1988, GM said it earned $4.86 billion, or $7.17 per
share, up 37 percent from 1987 earnings of $3.55 billion, or $5.03 a
share. GM's previous annual earnings record was $4.5 billion in 1984.
   The figures for earnings per share are on the basis of a 2-for-1
stock split that was declared Feb. 6 and will be paid March 31.
   Last year's annual figures reflect the effect of a $224 million
accounting change that boosted earnings, the company said.
   Sales for the quarter amounted to $28.9 billion in 1988, up 8
percent from $26.4 billion during the same period in 1987. Annual
sales in 1988 came to $110.2 billion, up 8.3 percent from $101.8
billion in 1987.
   The earnings include profits announced Monday by GM's three
largest subsidiaries _ General Motors Acceptance Corp., GM Hughes
Electronics and Electronic Data Systems Corp.
   The company said EDS and GM Hughes earnings for 1988 were
records, GMAC's was the second-highest in history and the
corporation's North American operations, which have been sagging in
recent years, showed increased earnings.
   ``Although still below desired levels of profitability, GM's
North American operations achieved substantial profit improvement
and made significant progress in terms of both product
competitiveness and improve operating efficiency,'' GM Chairman
Roger Smith and President Robert Stempel said in a news release.
   Because of the North American profits, GM said it would issue
profit-sharing checks totaling $114 million for about 470,000
employees, or about $254 per employee, the company said. GM did not
issue profit sharing checks for the past two years because of
slumping North American performance.
   The company's profit-sharing plan is based on U.S. car and truck
sales.
   Chrysler Corp. reported Feb. 2 that it earned $1.05 billion last
year, and Ford Motor Co. is to report 1988 earnings later this week.
   Earnings for the Big Three combined are guaranteed to set a
record for 1988. GM's and Chrysler's combined annual profits and
Ford's net income through the first three quarters totals $10.05
billion, breaking the Big Three's previous annual earnings record of
$9.79 billion set in 1984.
   On Monday, GM Hughes, the company's aerospace and military
subsidiary, said its fourth-quarter earnings rose 16.5 percent over
the same period last year and GMAC, which runs GM's financing and
mortgage operations, said its fourth-quarter earnings rose 9.5
percent.
   EDS, GM's electronics company, said its fourth-quarter earnings
fell 0.9 percent.

   ConAgra Inc. and Holly Farms Corp. have set
new record dates for shareholders' meetings in connection with the
proposed $1 billion merger of the two companies.
   Only stockholders owning stock in the two companies on or before
Feb. 23 can vote and attend special meetings on the merger, the
companies said Monday.
   The companies said their respective meetings would be sometime in
late March.
   Earlier, the companies had set Jan. 23 as the record date, but
they changed it because of what they said were delays.
   The boards of Omaha-based ConAgra and Holly Farms of Memphis,
Tenn., have agreed to merge the two companies to form the nation's
largest poultry producer.
   Tyson Foods Inc. of Springdale, Ark., now the nation's largest
poultry company, also has been trying to purchase Holly Farms.
   Tyson said it has extended until 4 p.m. Friday its $60-per-share
cash tender offer for Holly Farms.
   Tyson also said it has made Holly another offer, this one in the
form of a proposal to the Holly Farms board, of $63.50 per share.
   The Holly Farms board has recommended its shareholders accept the
ConAgra offer, under which the Omaha company would swap ConAgra
stock for Holly Farm stock.

<HEAD>Merc Says FBI Tactics Will Uncover Wrongdoing That Escapes Internal
Probers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange says the use of
hidden recording devices and other surveillance techniques by
undercover agents may uncover wrongdoing that has escaped internal
enforcement efforts.
   Merc officials predicted Monday that the effectiveness of their
own enforcement efforts will be confirmed by a federal inquiry into
allegations that as many as 100 traders and brokers at the exchange
and the Chicago Board of Trade systematically cheated customers out
of millions of dollars in profits.
   But the Merc also noted in a statement that the undercover probe
would uncover violations that have escaped its best efforts because
FBI agents can use ``electronic surveillance techniques that would
have constituted felonies if employed by the CME and its staff.''
   As part of the investigation, FBI agents posed as traders to
learn whether other traders were manipulating the trading of
contracts for future deliveries of commodities ranging from soybeans
to Treasury bonds.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas, whose office reportedly is
conducting the undercover effort, has refused to confirm even that
an investigation is ongoing. No indictments have been issued.
   In a related matter, CME officials on Monday also criticized news
coverage of the investigation, and police detectives said they had
not established a motive for the apparent suicide of a veteran
trader and former policeman.
   The Merc's Board of Governors said in a statement that the
disclosure of the probe on Jan. 19 had sparked a ``media frenzy''
that had inflicted possibly irreversible damage on the futures
industry.
   On Monday, retired policeman Edward Cashman, 69, was found shot
to death in the furnace room of his Northwest Side home, an apparent
suicide, said Police Sgt. Russell Weingart.
   Weingart said detectives interviewed members of the family and
the prominent, family-owned Victor Grain Co. to determine whether
Cashman's death was tied to the ongoing federal investigation.
   ``But we haven't established any motive so far,'' said Weingart.

   Fairchild Industries Inc. said today was
conducting its own investigation of allegations of non-compliance
with required testing procedures at one of its aerospace fasteners
plants.
   The defense contracting firm said the allegations against its
Vol-Shan-Chatsworth aerospace division located in Culver City,
Calif., were made by a former employee who claimed substandard work
was being done at the facility.
   Last week the FBI announced it was investigating Vol-Shan for
what it called possible falsification of quality control records at
the California plant.
   Despite the investigation, Carlyle Group, a Washington-based
investment group, said Monday it was not abandoning its unsolicited
$230 million takeover bid for the Chantilly, Va., company.
   ``We're still interested in Fairchild, but we're putting the
market on notice that we have to evaluate all of our options in
light of recent events,'' Carlyle managing partner Stephen L. Norris
told The Washington Times.
   Carlyle currently owns nearly 10 percent of Fairchild's
outstanding stock, making it the company's largest public
shareholder.

   Futures prices for soybeans and corn were higher
while wheat prices fell slightly in early trading today on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Supporting soybeans were talk of renewed demand in Europe and a
feeling that the futures market has been oversold lately, analysts
said.
   Recent export figures were encouraging buying in the corn pit,
traders said. Monday's U.S. Agriculture Department report of exports
for last week listed 45.8 million bushels of corn _ on the high side
of expectations.
   Meanwhile, analysts said recent rains in Midwest growing areas
held down wheat prices.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 1{ cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.24 a bushel; corn was { cent to
1{ cents higher, with March at $2.66{ a bushel; oats were 2 cents to

futures mostly rose on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   In early trading, cattle were .20 cent lower to .10 cent higher,

feeder cattle were unchanged to .30 cent lower, with March at 82.55

   The administration held fast today against
demands from congressional Democrats that it come up with more
specifics to cover gaps in President Bush's new $1.16 trillion
budget.
   Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said spending cuts
would have to be the product of negotiations with Congress. ``This
budget is alive and is an active force subject to change in
negotiation and discussion,'' he said.
   Fitzwater indicated that the administration did not plan to issue
proposals for more specific cuts beyond those proposed in the
blueprint for the 1990 fiscal year unveiled last week.
   Some congressional Democrats have contended that Bush's budget
enables him to get credit for proposing more spending on social
programs like child care, education and environmental cleanup _
while making sure Congress shares the responsibility for cuts to
help pay for these programs.
   Bush's budget, apart from proposing a freeze on defense spending
at the rate of inflation, was vague on where other specific areas of
spending would be restrained to meet deficit targets.
   In an interview published in today's editions of The Wall Street
Journal, the president said ``what we tried to do is simply put
forward in a broad sense, in a short period of time, priorities. ...
And now there's two approaches _ one is the Congress can say here's
what we'll do, or two, they can have negotiations with the White
House.''
   The president generally called for freezing most domestic
programs at 1989 levels. However, that would leave a $9.6 billon to
$11 billion gap in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 if the
programs are merely allowed to keep pace with inflation and
population growth.
   ``The numbers speak for themselves,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
``Nothing is final and we'll be negotiating all of these programs.''
   Budget director Richard G. Darman and White House Chief of Staff
John Sununu were to meet this afternoon with congressional budget
leaders to work out ground rules for more intensive talks to come in
the days ahead.
   ``We'll be providing details as we go along ... Everybody knows
cuts have to be made,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said today's meeting, following one Monday between Darman and
leaders of the House and Senate Budget committees, was part of a
process of ``clearing away the underbrush.''
   Although the budget has already stirred controversy in the
Democratic-controlled Congress, Fitzwater said ``we don't want the
budget to be confrontational'' and that the administration would
retain ``an open mind'' on spending cuts.
   Bush on Monday opened a series of talks around the country to
promote his budget plan. He travels to Columbia, S.C., on Wednesday
to highlight his budget goals before a joint session of the state
legislature.
   Fitzwater denied that Bush's budget travels were an effort to
make an end-run around Congress, as former President Reagan had done
in building public support for some of his initiatives.
   Rather, the spokesman said, said the trips were just ``an
opportunity for the president to discuss his priorities'' and an
attempt to stress his intention ``to work with Congress.''
   Bush won initial plaudits from Democrats and Republicans alike
for the budget plan he outlined last week in his maiden speech to a
joint session of Congress last Thursday.
   But some of the warmth of that reception cooled as budget
analysts combed through the document itself and found details were
scarce on how the new social programs highlighted by the president
would be financed.

upcoming album. That announcement came on the heels comes of
industry leader Coke's new ad campaign aimed at pushing sales of
Diet Coke.
   Coke signed pop singer George Michael for a series of
commercials, on top of a campaign already featuring hockey star
Wayne Gretzky, model Elle MacPherson and ``Miami Vice'' star Don
Johnson, a one-time Pepsi pitchman. Stewart, whose hit songs include
``Maggie May,'' has recorded 20 albums over his career. In addition
to the commercials, Pepsi said it will sponsor Stewart's concert
tour of South America and Mexico.

<HEAD>Penny Stock Company Closes After New York Fraud Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A penny stock firm accused of defrauding
thousands of customers has shut down its operation, citing the
financial crunch of a flood of investors seeking their money back.
   Power Securities Corp. announced Monday that it was terminating
all retail sales activities nationwide.
   The closure of the Las Vegas office comes less than a week after
New York Attorney General Robert Abrams accused Power of defrauding
thousands of investors of millions of dollars.
   Mark Behringer, Las Vegas branch manager for the company, said
Power was closing because it could not meet net capital requirements.
   ``There was a rush on the bank,'' he said. ``A lot of stock came
back at us. We couldn't meet net (capital) and we had to close our
doors.''
   The Nevada Securities Division urged Power customers to make
arrangements immediately to have their accounts transferred to other
brokerage firms or request delivery of their funds and stocks.
   ``Our agency will be monitoring the situation closely and will
take further action if the situation warrants,'' Deputy Secretary of
State Sherwood Cook said.
   Power attorney Gilbert McSwain issued a statement saying the run
by investors probably was triggered by Abrams' actions against the
company and ``not the public's lack of confidence in the penny stock
market.''
   Penny stocks are low-priced, high-risk securities sold over the
counter. They are not listed on any major exchanges.
   A New York judge last week temporarily barred Power from
soliciting business in the state after Abrams said records showed
Power had manipulated stock prices, created artificial markets and
marked up stock prices by 100 percent or more. A Feb. 22 hearing in
the case is scheduled.
   Power Securities was founded in 1987 by two Rochester, N.Y.,
natives, Richard T. Marchese, 29, and Eric G. Monchecourt, 27, and
Orville L. Sandberg, 62, of Denver.
   It employed 106 salespeople in four offices in New York state.
Another 400 around the country are registered to solicit business in
the state, Abrams said. The company said it had 1,300 employees
nationwide.

   Singer Diana Ross has become a
part-owner of Motown Records, and has agreed to resume recording for
the label she helped propel to popularity in the 1960s.
   The size of the singer's investment in the company wasn't
revealed when the deal was announced late Monday.
   Motown founder Berry Gordy Jr. sold the company in June to a
partnership of MCA Inc. and Boston Ventures, an investment firm, for
a reported $61 million. At the time of the sale, a Motown
spokeswoman said Miss Ross had intended to return to Motown.
   MCA didn't say how her investment might fit in with the company's
promise to maintain 20 percent minority ownership in Motown, once
considered one of the nation's largest and most successful
black-owned businesses.
   Miss Ross, who recorded on Motown with the Supremes in the 1960s
but who left the label in 1980 to sign with RCA records, signed an
exclusive contract with the new Motown, the company said. Her first
new Motown album, ``Workin' Overtime,'' is scheduled for release in
early May.

   Competitive pressure in domestic tire markets
contributed to a 66 percent drop in Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.'s
fourth-quarter income, the company reported Tuesday.
   Goodyear reported after-tax earnings of $56.4 million, or 98
cents a share, on sales of $2.8 billion. In the corresponding 1987
quarter, Goodyear earned $167 million, or $2.92 per share, on sales
of $2.6 billion.
   The 1987 income included $47.6 million from discontinued
operations. In 1988's final quarter, the company took $26.8 million
in charges against earnings to cover the costs of voluntary employee
separations, a pension settlement and asset reversion.
   Goodyear's income for all of last year came to $350.1 million, or
$6.11 a share, down 55 percent from 1987's $770.9 million, or $12.73
a share. Sales amounted to $10.8 billion vs. $9.9 billion in the
same respective years. The 1987 total included $257 million in
income from discontinued Goodyear Aerospace, Motor Wheel and Celeron
Oil and Gas subsidiaries.
   Tom H. Barrett, Goodyear chief executive officer and president,
said the company experienced a 28.8 percent decline in operating
income in the United States in 1988, while its operating income in
its foreign businesses was up 40.8 percent.

   A federal court has agreed to a quick review of a
lower court order blocking MAI Basic Four Inc.'s $970 million
hostile takeover bid for Prime Computer Inc.
   MAI Basic said Tuesday the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had
granted its motion for an expedited appeal and scheduled a hearing
March 2.
   U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone issued a temporary
restraining order in late December prohibiting MAI Basic from
pursuing its $20-per-share tender offer for Natick-based Prime,
saying the company needed to make further financial disclosures.
   The Tustin, Calif.-based firm submitted a financial disclosure
Jan. 24, but Prime insisted the information was still incomplete and
that MAI Basic's financing plan violated several federal securities
rules.
   Mazzone refused to lift his injunction, and MAI Basic filed an
appeal last week.
   The two companies also are fighting a separate legal battle in
Delaware. MAI Basic spokesman Peter Rosenthal said the Delaware
court will schedule a hearing in that case once the federal court in
Boston makes its decision.

<TEXT>
   Italian auto manufacturer Fiat SpA, which
recently entered a joint marketing agreement with Chrysler Corp.,
began trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Fiat Chairman Giovanni Agnelli said his company, Italy's largest
private-sector corporation, is sizing up further deals in North
America and hopes to gain stature by being listed on the largest
U.S. exchange.
   ``The U.S. consumer market is of particular interest and
importance to us, as evidenced by the recent commercial agreement
concluded between Alfa Romeo and Chrysler,'' Agnelli said at an NYSE
ceremony.
   Fiat has entered a joint venture agreement with the No. 3 three
U.S. carmaker to market the Alfa Romeo 164 model in the United
States.
   Agnelli said he expects the New York listing to have a ``slightly
positive effect'' on Fiat stock. Company shares already are traded
in Milan, London, Frankfurt, Berlin and Paris, but Agnelli said he
has no current plans for a listing in Tokyo.
   Fiat last year reported a 23 percent earnings jump to $2.9
billion on revenue of $33.5 billion. Fiat sells automobiles,
tractors, commercial vehicles, earthmoving equipment and other
products in more than 150 countries, and operates 60 manufacturing
plants in 50 countries.
   Fiat shares are traded in New York in the form of American
Depository Receipts, with one ADR representing five original Fiat
ordinary shares. Preferred and non-voting stock also are listed.

   Stock prices gained ground today as investors
continued to keep an eye on the outlook for interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.82 to 2,292.32 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
846 up, 522 down and 523 unchanged.
   The stock and bond markets have been under the shadow of
inflation and rising interest rates. President Bush said in an
interview published in the Wall Street Journal today that he is
opposed to the Federal Reserve's tightening credit further to fight
inflation.
   Bond prices were slightly higher in early trading today in spite
of a Commerce Department report that retail sales rose 0.6 percent
in January, slightly above expectations.
   In some circumstances, strong growth in retail sales can prompt
worries about inflation and upward pressure on interest rates.
   Union Carbide made a big contribution to the Dow's gain, jumping
2[ to 31\. Carbide agreed to pay the government of India $470
million for the 1984 gas leak in Bhopal that killed more than 3,300
people. The sum was less than many investors had expected.
   Coleman soared 20} to 69~. The company said Sheldon Coleman, its
chief executive, proposed a buyout for $64 a share in cash and
preferred stock, and traders immediately began to speculate about
the chances for a higher bid.
   General Motors dropped 1} to 90. Analysts said it appeared that
traders who had bought the stock anticipating the company's strong
fourth-quarter earnings report sold after the numbers were issued
this morning.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.48 to 164.63. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.55 at 323.31.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 106.02 million shares with two
hours to go.

   Box office revenues hit a record $4.46 billion
last year although movie attendance dropped slightly, the president
of the Motion Picture Association of America told theater owners
Tuesday.
   ``In spite of competition for the eye and ear of the American
consumer, in spite of an avalanche of visual options, the movie
theater has not only refused to die, it has held firm,'' Jack
Valenti told the opening session of SHOWEST.
   Theater admissions totaled 1.085 billion in 1988, Valenti said,
the 12th straight year attendance topped the one billion. The
attendance figure was down 0.03 percent from 1987, Valenti said,
while revenues rose 5 percent.
   Valenti told theater owners they are in a ``watching war'' with
90 million television households across America that tune in an
average of 49 hours a week.
   ``In the last 10 years, there has grown a veritable new nation
with 49 million homes wired to cable, 37 million pay cable
subscriptions and some 19 million homes capable of receiving pay per
view,'' he said. ``There are over 56 million VCR households and one
out of five has more than one VCR.
   ``As alternate delivery systems invade the American living room,
the conventional wisdom was and is `the cinema is bound to die.'''
   But the movie industry has held firm despite predictions of its
demise, Valenti said.
   The United States recorded a per capita movie attendance of 4.4
last year, compared to Canada with 2.8, France and West Germany 1.9,
Italy 1.6 and Great Britain 1.4.
   Valenti said the over-40 age group represents a growing portion
of theater attendance. Two years ago, the over-40 market accounted
for 14 percent of theater admissions. In 1988, that share rose to
22.3 percent.
   Valenti said he is not concerned about the dwindling number of
theater chains that own a growing number of movie houses.
   ``That only becomes a problem when competition is being
starved,'' Valenti said. ``The exhibition business is highly
competitive.''

   Futures prices for soybeans and corn rose sharply
while wheat prices were mixed at the close Tuesday on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Soybean prices climbed at least 12 cents for the three contracts
pegged for delivery in March, May and July.
   Supporting soybeans were talk of renewed demand for soy products
in Europe, and a feeling that the futures market has been oversold
lately, analysts said.
   Decent export figures were encouraging buying in the corn pit,
traders said.
   ``There also were rumors of new Russian interest in the corn
market,'' said Steve Freed, grain analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   Recent rains in Midwest growing areas held down prices on wheat,
said research director Jerry Gidel of LIT America Inc.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents lower to 1{ cents higher, with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.23\ a bushel; corn was }
cent to 4\ cents higher, with March at $2.69{ a bushel; oats were 4\
cents to 5\ cents, with March at $2.09\ a bushel; and soybeans were

   Stock prices closed higher but below their session
peaks Tuesday, lifted by some heavy futures-related buying and a
strong early trend on Wall Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 16.4
points, or 0.8 percent, higher at 2,049.1, having traded as much as
21 points higher during the afternoon. But the index recovered
strongly from the morning low of 6.1 points down, which came soon
after the market opening.
   Volume was a moderate 534.1 million shares, up from 474.5 million
shares a day earlier.
   The trend in New York helped the London market recover its poise
following a heavy drop Monday prompted by worries about high British
interest rates and inflationary pressures on the British and world
economy.
   Analysts cautioned that the overall market is still vulnerable to
further bad news on the inflation front.
   The London market was likely to remain ``a bit directionless''
until it has firm evidence that British interest rates are heading
lower again, said Kevin Gardiner, an analyst at the London
investment firm Warburg Securities.

   Sales of cars made in the United States by the
nation's Big Three automakers slumped 20.2 percent in early February
compared with the same period last year, when sales were unusually
strong, the companies said Tuesday.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said they
sold cars at an average daily rate of 16,112 during the Feb. 1-10
period, compared with a rate of 20,182 during the same 1988 period.
   Trucks made in the United States by the Big Three sold at a daily
rate of 10,034, down 10.6 percent from 11,223 last year.
   Combined car and truck sales were off 16.8 percent during the
period. There were nine selling days in the 1988 and 1989 periods.
   During the early part of 1988, sales were abnormally high, due in
part to manufacturers returning to heavy use of incentives partly
because of fear that the stock market crash of October 1987 may have
kept car buyers out of showrooms.
   But that was an unnecessary concern, as the 1988 model year
proved to be the third best on record.
   Since the beginning of this year, the Big Three have sold cars
and trucks at a daily rate of 29,243, compared with a rate of 31,032
during the same period last year, a 5.8 percent decline. There were
34 selling days in both periods.
   Chrysler said its car sales skidded 30.9 percent during early
February, falling to a daily rate of 2,200 this year from a rate of
3,185 last year. Chrysler's truck sales suffered the least among the
Big Three, dropping 5.1 percent to a daily rate of 2,398 compared
with a rate of 2,528.
   So far this year, Chrysler's car sales are 13.6 percent lower
than they were in 1988, but truck sales are 7.7 percent ahead of
last year's pace.
   GM car sales fell 23 percent during early February, dropping to a
daily rate of 8,355 from a rate of 10,856. Trucks made by GM in the
United States sold at a rate of 4,040 during the first 10 days of
the month, down 13 percent from 4,643.
   For the year, GM has sold 14.3 percent fewer cars this year, and
2.3 percent fewer trucks.
   Ford said its early February car sales slipped 9.5 percent, to a
daily rate of 5,557 compared with a rate of 6,143. Truck sales by
Ford were off 11.3 percent, falling to a rate of 3,596 compared with
a rate of 4,053.
   Ford has sold 0.2 percent more cars and 0.7 percent more trucks
so far this year.

   Stock prices advanced slightly today as investors
continued to keep an eye on the outlook for interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.82 to 2,287.32 by
3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
764 up, 610 down and 543 unchanged.
   The stock and bond markets have been under the shadow of
inflation and rising interest rates.
   President Bush said in an interview published in the Wall Street
Journal today that he is opposed to the Federal Reserve's tightening
credit further to fight inflation.
   Bond prices were slightly higher in early trading today in spite
of a Commerce Department report that retail sales rose 0.6 percent
in January, slightly above expectations.
   In some circumstances, strong growth in retail sales can prompt
worries about inflation and upward pressure on interest rates.
   Union Carbide made a big contribution to the Dow's gain, jumping
2[ to 31\. Carbide agreed to pay the government of India $470
million for the 1984 gas leak in Bhopal that killed more than 3,300
people. The sum was less than many investors had expected.
   Coleman soared 20~ to 70. The company said Sheldon Coleman, its
chief executive, proposed a buyout for $64 a share in cash and
preferred stock, and traders immediately began to speculate about
the chances for a higher bid.
   General Motors dropped 2 to 89}. Analysts said it appeared that
traders who had bought the stock anticipating the company's strong
fourth-quarter earnings report sold after the numbers were issued
this morning.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.07 to 164.22. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.27 at 323.03.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 126.48 million shares with an
hour to go.

<HEAD>FBI To Investigate Leading Edge Finances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI confirmed Tuesday it is investigating the
finances of Leading Edge Products Inc. to determine whether the
computer company has violated federal laws.
   John J. Cloherty, a spokesman for the FBI's Boston office, said
the probe was launched within the past week, but he declined to say
what information led the bureau to initiate an investigation.
   Leading Edge's legal problems mounted Monday when six computer
dealers filed a petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court claiming they paid
a total of $779,000 in advance for Leading Edge computers they never
received.
   Dealers said they agreed to the advance payment, an unusual
practice in the industry, because of the large demand for the
computers.
   The Canton company pioneered the market for low-priced IBM
personal computer clones. But it stopped delivering computers last
month.
   The dealers who signed the bankruptcy petition are seeking to
freeze Leading Edge's assets pending an examination of the company's
finances and business dealings. The company reportedly owes dealers
more than $10 million.
   Leading Edge spokesman David Rottenberg said the dealers'
complaints and the company's debts would be addressed by the planned
sale of Leading Edge to one of its dealers, PC Systems of Riviera
Beach, Fla.
   The sale, however, has been blocked temporarily by a court order
because of an unrelated lawsuit over software royalties filed by a
former Leading Edge employee, Rottenberg said.
   PC Systems had agreed to supply computers and assume Leading
Edge's debts in return for the company's valuable trademark,
Rottenberg said.
   Earlier this month, 50 Leading Edge dealers met in Chicago to
consider the PC Systems sale.
   Larry Stone, president of OmniTek Computers Inc. of Portland,
Ore., who organized the meeting, said Leading Edge owes him
$190,000. Stone said he decided to sign the bankruptcy petition when
``it became pretty apparent the action was going to proceed with or
without me.''

   Disney Co. said Tuesday that
first-quarter earnings rose 48 percent to $148 million, the largest
profits the in the family entertainment giant's history.
   Disney officials told shareholders at their annual meeting that
profits rose nearly half compared with $100 million in the
corresponding fiscal 1988 quarter.
   Revenues for the quarter ended Dec. 31 were $1.04 billion, up 42
percent from $734.6 million a year ago.
   ``These results were the highest for any comparable period in the
company's history,'' Disney Chief Financial Officer Gary Wilson said.
   Speaking to an overflow crowd of shareholders at Disney World's
Contemporary Hotel, Disney Chairman Michael Eisner and President
Frank Wells touted the tremendous growth in the four years since
they took over the company following a turbulent period.
   The officials said fiscal 1988 was the fourth straight year in
which all parts of the company contributed record revenues.

<HEAD>Reuters Reports 22.4 Percent Gain In 1988 Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reuters Holdings PLC, the news and information
services group, said Tuesday its income rose 22.4 percent last year
despite weakness in world financial markets.
   The company said after-tax earnings totaled $242.8 million in
1988, or $1.74 for each outstanding American depositary share, up
from 1987's $198.4 million, or $1.41 per ADS. One Reuters' ADS
represents three class B ordinary shares of the company's stock.
   Last year's profit did not include $13.3 million set aside to
cover the cost of closing Reuters' Long Island, N.Y.-based
manufacturing subsidiary, IDR Inc. There were no extraordinary items
in 1987.
   Revenue increased 15.7 percent to $1.82 billion in 1988 from
$1.57 billion in 1987. Growth in revenue was restrained by the
strong pound, cancellation of subcription services and a decline in
the sales of trading room systems, a company statement said.
   Before taxes, Reuters said its profit rose 20.5 percent to $390
million from $324 million.
   Reuters Managing Director Glen Renfrew said the company had
healthy profit growth despite the problems of world financial
markets in 1988 which ``remained nervous'' in the aftermath of the
October 1987 stock market crash.
   Gross new orders for core information and dealing products
remained near record levels, Renfrew said, and large numbers of new
subscribers were signed up. On the other hand, cancellations were
heavy, he said.
   Net new orders, after cancellations, ``remained below the peaks
of 1987 throughout the year but high enough to produce good revenue
growth,'' Renfrew said.
   The company said it slashed 550 jobs in its cost-cutting efforts
last year, bringing the total number of employees to 10,064. Forty
to 50 job cuts were in the editorial division, it said.
   Reuters released the results at its corporate headquarters in
London and at the New York office of the company's U.S. subsidiary,
Reuters America Inc. The company does not break out quarterly or
half-year figures. It isn't required to under British law.

<HEAD>Northrop Sues Over Payments To South Koreans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Northrop Corp. is suing a Honolulu businessman to
recover $6.25 million allegedly paid to him and several South Korean
associates to finance a hotel and office complex in Seoul that was
never built.
   According to the suit filed Friday in U.S. District Court, the
money was paid to James Shin from 1984-86 to assist ``Northrop's
business activities in Korea.''
   The aircraft manufacturer also has filed a civil lawsuit in South
Korea to recover the money, which Northrop says was paid into a
Korea Exchange Bank account in Hong Kong and disappeared.
   U.S. government investigators say the money may be part of about
$7.75 million allegedly paid by Northrop to help sell its ill-fated
F-20 fighter jet.
   The payments are being investigated by a federal grand jury in
Los Angeles, where Northrop is based, by a U.S. congressional
committee and by the government of South Korea. The government is
trying to determine if the Northrop payments violated the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
   Shin, 51, the former operator of a Honolulu nightclub, has been
unreachable for comment.
   Northrop's suit alleges that Shin secretly received a $1 million
check fron the Hong Kong bank account in August 1984. At the time
Shin allegedly was employed as an overseas aircraft sales consultant
for Northrop at a salary of $8,500 per month, plus expenses.

<HEAD>Eastern Airlines Offering Coupon Discounts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Threatened with a possible strike March 3 by
militant machinists, Eastern Airlines has introduced ``Super
Coupons'' offering passengers sizable discounts if they fly after
that date.
   Some analysts and travel agents said Tuesday that the coupons,
offered during the peak winter travel period, marked a desperate
move by the strapped airline. Eastern is staring into the abyss,
they said, and a prolonged Machinists union strike could throw it
over the edge.
   The discount coupons are ``just a way to entice people to fly
Eastern'' despite the strike threat, Robert Decker, an airline
analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago. ``Any protracted strike
would really have dire financial consequences for Eastern.''
   Competitors including Delta Air Lines and Pan Am Corp. said
Tuesday they didn't plan to match Eastern's coupon initiative.
   ``We do intend to operate in the event of a strike,'' Eastern
spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said from airline headquarters in Miami.
``For those who may be reluctant, this (the coupon program) is a
little extra incentive to stay with us.''
   Some travel industry experts speculated Eastern management could
reach a settlement with the Machinists before the end of the 30-day
cooling-off period on March 3. But others saw a strong possibility
that the union won't deal with Frank Lorenzo, hard-nosed chairman of
Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp.
   A National Mediation Board negotiator is continuing efforts to
gain an agreement, though no recent progress has been reported and
both sides have shown signs of preparing for a strike. Machinist
union officials have predicted overwhelming approval of a strike
when the vote is announced later this week.
   Last week, Eastern reported a record net loss of $335.4 million
in 1988, nearly double its $181.7 million loss the year before.
Revenue dropped to $3.8 billion from $4.4 billion in 1987.
   The airline plans to distribute coupons to passengers on domestic
flights starting Thursday. The coupons entitle them to one-third
discounts off any round-trip fare of $200 or more for travel between
March 4 and March 22. Between April 5 and April 30, the coupons are
good for a 20 percent discount.
   The discounts apply to Eastern flights in the United States and
the Caribbean. All travel must be completed by June 15.
   Newspaper advertisements announcing the coupon drive don't
mention Eastern faces a possible strike the day before the discounts
apply.
   ``It's a desperation move to raise money,'' said David Perelman,
president of DMS Travel in midtown Manhattan. ``Eastern is trying to
bring back the passengers that are jumping away because of the
potential strike situation and the deteriorating service.''
   Perelman reported scant interest in the coupons among his
customers. He said his agency recently started putting a written
disclaimer on invoices, warning fliers of the strike threat and
financial woes facing Eastern and declining responsibility for any
problems that might arise as a result.
   William Cooper, president of Adventure Travels in Pompano Beach,
Fla., said he hasn't seen great interest in the coupons either. He
has been advising customers to charge Eastern tickets on credit
cards, so they can withhold payment if a problem arises.
   If Eastern is hit by a bruising strike, ``it will be the last we
will ever see of Eastern Airlines as we know it,'' Cooper said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intel Corp. engineers on Wednesday will reveal
details of a processor chip with blazing speed that is the main
focus of interest at the world semiconductor industry's biggest
annual research meeting.
   The Intel chip, code-named the N-10, turned out so well that
Intel might offer it as a central processor for computers instead of
just an adjunct, some industry analysts believe.
   ``The N-10 is a major event. It's had a lot of excitement built
up around it and it does appear to be the highest-performance
processor soon to be available,'' Michael Slater, editor of
Microprocessor Report newsletter, said Tuesday.
   Intel declined to comment on the chip in advance of its
presentation, citing secrecy rules of the International Solid State
Circuits Conference.
   The three-day conference draws scientists and engineers from all
the major U.S., Japanese and European semiconductor makers.
Companies often use it to announce their most important research
advances.
   Intel and Motorola Inc. are the world's leading companies in the
field of microprocessors, the brains of personal computers and
workstations.
   Industry analysts who have heard about the N-10 said it is
designed to operate at very high speeds on mathematical calculations
and graphics, making it a good supplement to traditional
microprocessors such as Intel's 80386 and the 80486 that is due out
later this year.
   The N-10 could handle the ``grunt work'' of high-speed,
repetitive calculations while the main processor handled more
complex tasks, said Dean McCarron, a microprocessor expert at
In-Stat Inc. in Scottsdale, Ariz.
   It probably would take a personal computer equipped with the N-10
and the forthcoming 80486 microprocessor a few seconds to
recalculate a long electronic spreadsheet, instead of the minute it
would take on today's fastest PCs, McCarron said.
   Beyond serving as a co-processor, though, Slater said he believes
Intel will announce later this month that the chip will also be
available for more general uses.
   Intel's problem is that computers would have to be redesigned to
accept the N-10 as a central processor. The N-10 is built with
so-called Risc technology, for reduced instruction set computing,
that makes it incompatible with other Intel microprocessors.
   ``Every time you have a new, different architecture everybody has
to revise their software to work with that architecture,'' Slater
said.
   Intel's only public statement on the N-10 is a brief abstract of
the paper it is presenting in New York, in which it says the chip
will have peak speed of 150 million operations a second. That is
five times faster than Risc chips designed by Motorola and Japan's
Fujitsu Ltd.

   The stock market turned in an indecisive showing
Tuesday after rising interest rates helped blunt an early advance.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 15 points
in the early going, closed with a 1.25 loss at 2,281.25.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
763 up, 668 down and 527 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 149.56 million
shares, up from 143.52 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 180.29 million shares.
   The market has been struggling of late amid worries about
inflation and rising interest rates.
   Rates rose in the credit markets Tuesday after the Commerce

   Investors also seemed to be looking ahead uneasily to a series of

   The Dow Jones industrials' loss would have been wider had it not
been for Union Carbide, which climbed 2 to 31[ as the most active
Big Board stock.
   Carbide agreed to pay the government of India $470 million for
the 1984 gas leak in Bhopal that killed more than 3,300 people. The

<HEAD>Joint Venture Rounds Out U.S. Links For Japan Steelmakers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. and Kobe Steel Ltd. of Japan
announced a joint venture Tuesday, the latest in a series of
partnerships combining the best of two worlds to solve the problems
of both.
   Kobe, the last of Japan's big integrated steelmakers to join with
a comparable U.S. producer, will pay an undisclosed sum to buy half
of USX's Lorain, Ohio, plant.
   The deal is at least the 11th joint venture completed or under
consideration. It leaves only Bethlehem Steel Corp., the
third-largest U.S. producer, without a partner from the Far East.
   ``The U.S. market is probably more attractive than it ever has
been,'' said John Jacobson of AUS Consultants of Philadelphia.
   Analysts said the Japanese are entering joint ventures because
steel import quotas and unfavorable currency exchange rates have
made it difficult for foreigners to penetrate American markets.
   ``It's either lose it or buy into it,'' said Donald Barnett, an
independent analyst.
   The Japanese also face increased competition at home from
low-cost steelmakers in Korea, Taiwan and other developing countries.
   In the United States, companies view the well-financed Japanese
as a source of capital _ the perfect tonic for mills that were
staved of cash during the industry's 1982-86 depression. The
Japanese also bring expertise in producing high-quality steel for
the autos, the biggest single end use of the metal.
   ``I'd have to say it's a win-win situation,'' said Jacobson.
   Both countries see the joint ventures as improving the chances of
selling steel to Japanese automakers that have transplanted
operations to America.
   ``When the transplants came over here almost everything was
produced in Japan. Anything sophisticated was even assembled in
Japan. Now a lot of that is being done in the U.S,'' said Charles
Bradford, an industry analyst for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   The partnership with Kobe gives USX an opportunity to pump money
into the Lorain Works and to possibly hedge its bets in the bar
market, analysts said. The Lorain plant, with 3,000 workers,
produces seamless pipe and high quality bar for vehicles and
machinery.
   Kobe may have been persuaded to gamble on the deal because
Lorain's bar is recognized as high quality, and bar prices have
surged 32 percent from $386 in the third quarter of 1986 to $510 in
the comparable 1988 period, Jacobson said.
   Kobe also owns Midrex Corp., the world's largest producer of
plants that produce iron by the short-cut direct reduction process.
   In other joint ventures in steel:
   _Nisshin Steel owns a 10 percent stake in Wheeling-Pittsburgh and
has a joint venture with Wheeling-Pitt in a sheet steel coating
plant.
   _NKK owns half of the flat-rolled producer National Steel Corp.
and is negotiating with National Intergroup to buy the other half.
   _Nippon and Inland are building a joint cold-rolling mill and say
they are considering a joint galvanizing line.
   _Sumitomo and LTV are partners in an electrogalvanizing line and
say they are considering a second line.
   _Kawasaki entered a joint venture with a Brazilian steelmaker in
buying California Steel, a West Coast flat roller. The Japanese
company also has agreed to buy 40 percent of Armco's eastern steel
division.
   _Pohang of Korea and USX jointly own a West Coast sheet steel
plant.

cents a gallon. Domestic heating oil for March declined 0.79 cent to
end the day at 47.38 cents a gallon. Other contract months also
ended on the down side.
   Most energy prices opened firm but turned lower during the
session with little news to stir investors. Observers said volume
was light with many traders away this week for an international
petroleum conference in London.
   ``There was no news on either side of the market that I could see
all day,'' said Bob Baker, an analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   Since Feb. 1, crude prices have fluctuated in the $17 trading
range, reflecting what analysts say are technical factors and
uncertainty among traders about the future of oil prices.
   Analysts said prices could remain volatile in the absence of
fresh news to give the market guidance and as investors await the
outcome of next week's meeting of non-OPEC oil producers. The group
has said it supports production cuts by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries but has not given any definitive
indication that it plans to reduce its own production to help
stabilize world oil prices.
   The group met last month without producing an agreement to cut
output.

<TEXT>
   The dollar dropped against most major currencies
Tuesday in a sell-off inspired in part by speculation the White
House may be at odds with the Federal Reserve Board over interest
rate policy.
   Gold prices were mixed. The Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a gold bid of $384.40 a troy ounce at 4 p.m. EST, down from
$385.20 an ounce late Monday.
   Dealers dumped dollars in favor of West German marks, reasoning
that evidence of rising inflation in that country might induce the
government to drive interest rates higher. Higher West German rates
would enhance returns on mark-denominated holdings.
   As trading wound down in New York, the dollar was reported at
1.84325 marks compared with 1.8677 late Monday.
   The dollar came under additional selling pressure as dealers
reacted to comments by President Bush in a Wall Street Journal
interview.
   Bush said he opposes further tightening in credit conditions to
combat inflation.
   Fred Barth, a first vice president at Prudential Bache Securities
Inc., said Bush's position seemed to differ with that of the central
bank even though the president said in the interview that he and Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan are not ``far apart at all.''
   ``Some people were disturbed by President Bush's comments,''
Barth said. ``There may be a little friction between the White House
and the Federal Reserve.''
   The dollar selling snowballed. The currency's downward movement
triggered additional declines as it fell to levels at which dealers
had previously determined they would sell to avoid losses.
   News of a better than expected 0.6 percent rise in U.S. retail
sales in January did not affect the markets because the previously
reported figures for December showing a 0.2 percent rise were
revised to an 0.1 percent decline.
   In London, one British pound closed at $1.7588, more expensive
for buyers than Monday's late $1.7495.
   Later, in New York, a pound fetched $1.77375 vs. $1.7525 Monday.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 127.20 Japanese yen, down
from 128.30 yen. In London late Tuesday the dollar traded higher at
127.37 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with levels late
Monday included: 126.305 Japanese yen, down from 128.07; 1.56325
Swiss francs, down from 1.58775; 1.1835 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1860; and 6.2715 French francs, down from 6.2855-85
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with Monday's
late rates: 1.8615 West German marks, down from 1.8705; 1.5815 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5895; 6.3325 French francs, down from 6.3650;
2.1015 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1120; 1,355.05 Italian lire, down
from 1,362.50; and, 1.1835 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1868.
   Gold bullion prices gained around $2 an ounce in European
dealings but fell in the United States.
   In London, gold closed at a bid $386.25 a troy ounce, up from
$384.25 late Monday. The late bid price in Zurich was $385.50, up
from $383.75.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
declined to $385.40 a troy ounce from $386.20 an ounce late Monday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $387.66 bid, down from
$388.68.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.83 bid a troy ounce,
up from $5.79. On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery
settled at $5.828 a troy ounce, up from $5.826 Monday.

<HEAD>Soybean, Corn Futures Up Sharply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Soybean and corn futures rose sharply Tuesday on the Chicago
Board of Trade, bolstered by talk of overseas demand for both
commodities.
   In other markets, cattle futures mostly were lower, pork mostly
was higher, precious metals were mixed and energy futures mostly
were lower.
   Soybean futures soared at least 12 cents higher during the
session for the three contracts pegged for delivery in March, May
and July, then settled about 11 cents higher.
   Prices were supported by talk of renewed demand for soy products
in Europe and a feeling that the futures market has been oversold
lately, said Jerry Gidel, reserach director in Chicago of LIT
America Inc.
   Export figures Monday that were on the high side of expectations
encouraged buying in the CBOT corn pit, Gidel said.
   ``There also were rumors of new Russian interest in the corn
market,'' said Steve Freed, grain analyst in Chicago with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Recent rains in Midwest growing areas weighed on wheat futures
trading, traders said.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents lower to 1} cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.23{ a bushel; corn was } cent
to 4\ cents higher, with March at $2.69} a bushel; oats were 4\
cents to 5{ cents higher, with March at $2.09 a bushel; and soybeans
were 6{ cents to 11\ cents higher, with March at $7.35\ a bushel.
   Cattle prices mostly were lower while pork complex futures mostly
were higher at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle prices were depressed by some profit talking following
gains on Monday and traders were under selling pressure due to
concerns of oversupply, said Paul Hare, an analyst with Linnco
Futures Inc.
   Higher than expected cash hog prices sent prices higher in the
pork complex, traders said.
   Cattle settled .88 cent lower to .05 cent higher, with the
contract for delivery in February at 74.65 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .25 cent to .63 cent lower, with March at 82.25 cents a
pound; live hogs were unchanged to .75 cent higher, with February at
42.17 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .60 cent lower to
.25 cent higher, with February at 37.82 cents a pound.
   Gold prices slipped, but silver futures were up slightly on the
Commodity Exchange in New York.
   ``The dollar was down sharply today but that doesn't move the
precious metals. This indicates to me there is not a whole lot of
enthusiasm to own precious metals now,'' said John O'Connell,
manager of futures research in New York for Refco Inc.
   Gold settled 70 cents to 80 cents lower, with the contract for
delivery in February at $385.40 a troy ounce; and silver was .2
cents to .4 cents higher, with February at $5.82.8 a troy ounce.
   Energy prices fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Crude oil settled .17 cent to .27 cent lower, with the contract
for delivery in March at $17.42 a barrel; heating oil was .74 cent
to .79 cent lower, with March at 47.38 cents a gallon; and unleaded
gasoline was .30 cent higher to .82 cent lower, with March at 47.33
cents a gallon.

   Textile giant West Point-Pepperell Inc. said
Tuesday it has had discussions with several parties but has received
no competing bids to Farley Inc.'s $1.53 billion tender offer.
   The hint of other offers and a possible extension of Wednesday's
bidding deadline, contained in a letter filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, sent Pepperell stock climbing for the
second straight day.
   Pepperell closed Tuesday at $58.25, up $1.25, in New York Stock
Exchange trading. On Monday, Pepperell stock rose $2 on rumors of a
possible $1.82 billion offer from Dominion Textile Inc., a Canadian
company.
   There also have been reports that Milliken &amp; Co., a closely held
Spartanburg, S.C., firm, and Pepperell management are considering
bids for the nation's largest publicly held textile company.
Pepperell manufactures such brands as Martex, Lady Pepperell, Utica
sheets and towels and Arrow shirts.
   The West Point-based company's SEC filing said it could get a
better deal than Farley's $52-per-share offer.
   Pepperell's board put the company up for sale Feb. 3, saying it
believed Farley's offer was too low. A Wednesday noon deadline for
offers ``may be changed, depending on events at the time,'' the
company said.
   Pepperell also said it would reveal the outcome of the auction
``only after an agreement in principle or definitive agreement is
entered into between the company and a prospective purchaser.''
   Pepperell has fought the bid by Chicago-based Farley, which
controls underwear manufacturer Fruit of the Loom Inc. and Acme Boot
Co.
   Farley bid $48 per share for Pepperell last October and most
recently increased the offer to $52 per share Feb. 1. The offer is
to expire at midnight Wednesday.

<HEAD>Netherlands' Akzo Claims First U.S. Superconductivity Patent To Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Akzo NV, a Dutch chemical company, Tuesday became
the first company from any nation to receive a U.S. patent in the
field of high-temperature superconductivity.
   Akzo upset a wide range of U.S., Japanese and European companies
that have been working in the field.
   Superconductors carry electricity without any loss of energy and
could some day permit tiny computers that run at unprecedented
speeds, batteries that last forever and other technological marvels.
   Although Akzo is based in Arnhem, Netherlands, it said its
research was done at its laboratory in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., by Fawzy
A. Sherif.
   The patent is for a process of making a superconducting powder of
uniform characteristics that contains three metallic elements,
yttrium, barium and copper, Akzo said.
   The new superconductors retain their special conducting
properties at much higher temperatures than earlier versions,
although they still must be kept very cold.
   In spite of Akzo's coup, other researchers may still receive
patents that are more fundamental and far-reaching than Akzo's. For
example, International Business Machines Corp. has applied for
patents for work done by scientists at its Zurich Research Lab in
Switzerland that led to a major breakthrough in early 1986.
   Akzo received a patent last August that also related to a process
useful for the formation of superconducting powders, but the company
said it considered the patent issued Tuesday as the first U.S.
superconductor patent to a company.
   Akzo's news release containing its claim was approved by the
Patent Office, according to Marge Waterstreet, a spokesman at the
Chicago headquarters of Akzo Chemicals Inc., a U.S. subsidiary.
   William O. Craig, a spokesman for the Patent Office, said the
federal Energy Department, which is not a company, received a patent
last August. He said it is being re-examined because of a challenge
to its validity.
   Electronic Business magazine reported last month that Japanese
researchers are leaders in the filing of patent applications in
superconductivity.
   Of 75 patent applications made public in Britain and West
Germany, where the information is disclosed earlier than in the
United States, Japan originated 59 and the United States 10, the
magazine said.
   The University of Houston expects to receive a patent for a
promising new superconducting material and in fact is getting $1.5
million from Du Pont Co. immediately and $3 million later for rights
to use the as yet unissued patent.
   The Massachusetts Institute of Technology said it has been told
by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that a patent would be
granted on a technique for manufacturing wires and other useful
shapes from the new materials.
   MIT has licensed rights on that forthcoming patent to American
Superconductor Corp. of Cambridge, Mass., which was founded by some
of the MIT professors who invented the process.

<HEAD>Fertilizer Use Rise Forecast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fertilizer use by U.S. farmers is expected to
rise 9 percent this year because of larger crop plantings and higher
crop prices, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   The greater demand also will drive up fertilizer prices, the
department's Economic Research Service said in a report. By spring
planting, prices are expected to average about 7 percent more than a
year ago.
   World use of commercial fertilizers also is climbing, a trend
expected to continue at least for several more years.
   ``By the early 1990s, world growth in nitrogen demand could
exceed supply, leading to higher prices,'' the report said. ``The
developed countries will likely have excess phosphate supplies,
while the Soviet Union, Asia and Eastern Europe will be deficit
areas.''
   The greatest surplus of potash is expected to be in North
America, while Western Europe, Asia, Afria and Latin America are
projected to be in short supply, the report said.
   Some other farm production items are likely to be more costly
this spring, including pesticides, up 2 percent to 5 percent; crop
seeds, 10 percent to 15 percent; and farm energy costs.
   ``Despite the drought, 1988 farm machinery expenditures rose an
estimated 5 percent to 10 percent over 1987,'' the report said. ``A
similar increase is likely in 1989, when expenditures could reach
$6.4 billion to $7.1 billion.''
   Last year's sales of most types of machinery remained stable or
increased, except for a 16 percent drop in combine sales, the report
said. Barring poor weather, sales of all major kinds of machinery
are expected to increase in 1989.

   Tandy Corp. said Tuesday it would stop trying to
sell personal computers to major corporate accounts through its
Radio Shack Computer Centers and would shift those duties to the
staff of a company it bought last summer.
   The sales representatives of Grid Systems Corp., a Tandy company
based in Fremont, Calif., that makes laptop computers, will be in
charge of sales to big companies and the government, Tandy said.
   Tandy, based in Fort Worth, Texas, is a major manufacturer and
seller of personal computers and other electronic equipment.
   Sixty-one Radio Shack Computer Centers will fall under Grid
management and be renamed Grid Systems Centers, while about 300
others will remain as Radio Shack Computer Centers.
   The Radio Shack Computer Centers will focus on selling to the
general business, home office, professional and educational markets.
   The move appears to acknowledge that the current marketing
strategy had not been as successful as the company had hoped.

<HEAD>ITT Profit Down For Quarter, Year Due To One-Time Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ITT Corp. reported lower fourth-quarter and
full-year earnings for 1988 on Tuesday, blaming the results on
one-time charges and reduced tax benefits.
   Profit for the quarter totaled $180 million, or $1.26 per share,
compared with a restated profit of $421 million, or $2.84 a share,
for the fourth quarter of 1987.
   Revenue for 1988's fourth quarter totaled $5.2 billion, a 7.5
percent increase over the restated $4.8 billion in the same period a
year earlier.
   For the full year, ITT earned $817 million, or $5.70 per share,
compared with a restated $965 million, or $6.41 per share, in 1987.
   Excluding major unusual or one-time items in both years, 1988
earnings per share rose 25 percent over 1987 on a comparative basis,
the company said.
   Full-year sales for 1988 totaled $19.4 billion, a 6.2 percent
increase over the restated $18.2 billion for 1987.
   ``Both the 1988 and 1987 full-year and fourth-quarter periods
include non-recurring items that distort the performance picture of
the company during 1988,'' said Rand V. Araskog, ITT's chairman and
chief executive officer.
   The 1988 results were reduced by a $41 million after-tax
provision for ``discontinued operations'' in the fourth quarter,
primarily for several environmental clean-up operations at the
company's Southern Wood Piedmont subsidiary, ITT said.
   Profit for 1988 included tax benefits at The Hartford, ITT's
insurance company, of $52 million, compared with $100.5 million from
the same ``fresh start'' tax benefit in 1987, the company said.
   The 1987 figures were restated due to a change in accouting rules
that lowered revenues from ITT's insurance and finance operations,
the company said. ``All of our business segments with the exception
of our electronic components operation posted higher operating
income in 1988,'' Araskog said.
   ITT is involved in the manufacture and sale of automotive
components, fluid technology, defense technology and wood products;
has operations in insurance, finance and communcations; and owns the
Sheraton Hotels chain.

   A federal judge's decision allowing Pacific
Telesis Group to invest in Japan's growing long-distance market is
an important step for the company and the U.S. telecommunications
industry, company officials said Tuesday.
   ``This is going to position us, and is positioning the company,
as a telecommunications player in Japan,'' said Jan Neels, president
and chief executive of Pacific Telesis International, PacTel's
international subsidiary.
   On Monday, U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene in Washington,
D.C., allowed PacTel to buy about 8.5 percent of a Japanese
consortium that will own and operate the western end of a
fiber-optic cable between the United States and Japan.
   Greene's decision makes PacTel the first American regional phone
company to enter the $1 billion Japanese long-distance market and
the first to provide long-distance service between the U.S. and a
foreign country, said PacTel spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg.
   ``It's a very important (decision), specifically for us. ... And
I think it will encourage other companies to focus on the Japanese
market and follow our example,'' Neels said.
   The consortium, International Digital Co. Inc., plans to start
providing long-distance service using satellite connections and
other cables in May. The new cable, which will run from Honshu in
Japan to Pacific City, Ore., should be ready in late 1990, Neels
said.
   ``Our target is to finally get around 15 percent of the market
share in the initial five- or six-year period,'' Neels said. It was
too soon to tell how large a share the consortium might have
afterward, said Neels, who declined to say how the project could
affect PacTel's earnings.
   One analyst, however, believed the company's entry into the
Japanese market, growing at about 20 percent a year, would have
little effect on profits.
   ``It's a nonevent as far as their earnings will go ... given the
size of the company,'' said Edward M. Greenberg, an analyst with
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc. in New York.
   American companies, supported by U.S. trade policy
representatives, have aggressively sought entrance into Japan's
telecommunications industry for the past decade.
   Major shareholders in the consortium, which received the Japanese
government's permission in late 1987, include Cable &amp; Wireless Co.
of Britain, Toyota Motor Corp. and C. Itoh and Co. of Japan.
   Pacific Telecom Cable, which has no association with PacTel, will
own the eastern end of the cable, estimated to cost between $300
million and $350 million.
   PacTel needed judicial approval before it could join the
consortium because the split-up of AT&amp;T in 1984 barred regional
phone companies from entering the long-distance telephone business.
PacTel's Pacific Bell, the leading provider of phone service in
California, is one of the seven so-called ``Baby Bells.''
   AT&amp;T and MCI Communications Corp. both objected to PacTel's
entering the Japanese market, arguing the venture would constitute
an antitrust abuse of its monopoly status as a local telephone
utility.
   But Greene, who said he based his ruling on commercial and trade
policy implications, dismissed their objections.
   The investment ``serves positive American purposes,'' Greene
wrote. Without PacTel's participation, the United States ``could
also lose a long-term opportunity to influence policies that could
open more Japanese markets,'' the judge said.
   Greene, however, refused a separate request by Nynex Corp.,
another of the regional phone companies, to take a 50 percent stake
in a trans-Atlantic fiber-optic cable with Britain's Cable &amp;
Wireless Co.

   The FBI said Tuesday it was investigating the
whereabouts of a veteran Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. stockbroker who
allegedly disappeared with as much as $8 million while on a golf
trip earlier this month.
   Walter F. Curran, 45, of Wellesley is said to have left on the
trip more than a week ago and has not been heard from. Fellow
brokers have described Curran as one of the top money makers in the
Boston office, which he joined in 1981.
   Curran is believed to have convinced clients to invest between $5
million and $10 million directly with him, rather than with the
firm, using the promise of huge returns as an incentive.
   ``We have initiated an investigation and it's ongoing,'' said FBI
spokesman Jack Cloherty. ``I really can add no more than that at
this time.''
   Marty Meehan of the state Securities Division said Dean Witter,
which Monday notified officials the broker was missing, may have
violated a state regulation requiring that brokerage houses
immediately disclose information about possible theft.
   But Dean Witter spokesman James M. Flynn said the brokerage house
had complied ``to the letter of the law'' with state regulations and
would continue to cooperate with authorities.
   Meehan said state officials were reviewing Dean Witter's internal
reports and interviewing officials, but that neither formal charges
nor an arrest warrant had been issued against Curran.
   In the weeks leading up to his disappearance, Curran reportedly
stopped making payments on $475,000 in personal loans from the Bank
of Boston and apparently made a series of suspicious deposits and
withdrawls to his account.

   Rockwell International Corp. has agreed
to buy the printing press-manufacturing operations of Baker Perkins,
a British company, for the equivalent of about $150 million,
officials said Tuesday.
   The El Segundo-based aerospace and industrial conglomerate said
it had signed a definitive agreement for the purchase with APV PLC,
parent of Baker Perkins. The press-making operations will become
part of Rockwell's graphic systems division, which is based in
Chicago and makes the Goss presses in wide use in the U.S. newspaper
industry.
   Baker Perkins, which is based in Peterborough, England, and has
offices in Shaumburg, Ill., Toronto and Offenbach, West Germany,
makes newspaper and magazine presses and sells them primarily in
Europe.
   Rockwell, maker of the B-1B bomber, the space shuttle and a host
of military and civilian industrial products, said it had agreed to
pay 85.3 million British pounds for the printing operations, or
about $150 million at current exchange rates. The deal must be
approved by regulators in both countries and by the stockholders of
APV.
   The acquisition would help Rockwell's graphics division expand
overseas, said Donald Beall, Rockwell's chairman and chief executive
officer. Beall said last week the company was considering
acquisitions within its current lines of business.
   Baker Perkins has 1,100 employees and in 1988 had sales of $120
million.

percent in January, a stronger-than-expected boost that raised
concerns about inflation Tuesday.
   The inflation fears, coupled with a sharp decline in the dollar,
drove down bond prices. Stocks, up in early trading, finished the
day lower. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks closed with
a 1.25 loss at 2,281.25.
   In one measure of the bond market's weakness, the yield on the
Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond rose to 9.11 percent from
9.06 percent late Monday.
   Retail sales rose 0.6 percent in January, the Commerce Department
said. That followed a revised 0.1 percent decrease in December and a
1.3 percent increase in November.
   Retail spending is seen as a key barometer of economic health
because it represents about one-third of the gross national product.
   ``Consumers were in a pretty good mood when they started
January,'' said economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in
New York. ``Good weather got them into shopping malls and they were
spending money. Despite higher interest rates, they did not feel
pinched.''
   Some analysts said the latest retail sales report, coupled with
other evidence of strong economic growth at the start of the year,
could lead the Federal Reserve Board to continue to nudge up
interest rates in its ongoing effort to slow the economy and keep
inflation in check.
   ``The economy will continue to exceed the speed limit, on
average, in the quarter ahead,'' said Robert G. Dederick, chief
economist for Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``The Federal Reserve
will have to move toward further restraint.''
   Sales of durable goods, ``big ticket'' items intended to last
three or more years, edged up 0.1 percent in January after an
identical rise in December. Non-durable goods surged 0.8 percent
after dropping 0.2 percent during the previous month.
   In other economic news Tuesday:
   _Sales of North American-made cars and light trucks fell 15.2
percent in early February from the same time last year, when
automakers were offering a larger and more varied group of
incentives.
   Incentives are available now but only on a smaller number of cars
than in early February a year ago. Also, interest rates have risen.
   _Home prices skyrocketed in California last year and continued to
command top dollar in the Northeast while sales picked up in the
lower-cost South and Midwest, a real estate trade group reported.
   The National Association of Realtors said prices of existing
homes rose 3.4 percent to a national median of $87,900 in the last
three months of 1988 compared with the same period a year earlier.
   _Interest rates on 52-week Treasury bills rose in Tuesday's
action to the highest level in nearly four years.

<HEAD>Coastal Extends Its Offer For Texas Eastern</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coastal Corp. on Tuesday extended for another 10
days its $2.6 billion cash offer for rival natural gas company Texas
Eastern Corp. after the original offer passed its deadline.
   The $42-per-share offer for the estimated 53 million shares of
outstanding stock will be extended through Feb. 23, Coastal
spokesman Robert Wells said. Coastal officials decided on the
extension late Monday as the first offer's midnight deadline neared.
   Calling it inadequate, Texas Eastern's board of directors
rejected Coastal's offer last month.
   Coastal's offer, when announced Jan. 16, was 40 percent more than
the $30.25 Texas Eastern stock was bringing at the time. Since then,
Texas Eastern stock has soared past $42.
   But, Wells said, ``Nothing has happened to lead us to increase
our offer and there is not another offer on the table.''
   Wells said about 2.5 million shares have been tendered since Jan.
17, although they are not in Coastal's possession. Coastal already
owned about 2.5 million shares.
   Coastal also has been trying through litigation to prevent Texas
Eastern directors from implementing anti-takeover measures.
   If successful, Coastal's takeover of Texas Eastern would create a
30,000-mile natural gas pipeline network from the Rocky Mountains to
New England and from the Canadian border to the Mexican border.

   General Motors Corp. said Tuesday its fourth
quarter profit soared by 67.5 percent from a year earlier and the
nation's biggest automaker posted record earnings for all of 1988.
   GM's earnings mean the company will issue $114 million in
profit-sharing checks to some 470,000 hourly employees, the first
such payments since fiscal 1985.
   In the three months ended Dec. 31, GM had net income of $1.4
billion, or $4.25 a share, up from $835.8 million, or $2.36 a share,
in the same period of in 1987. Revenue during the quarter rose to
$32.4 billion from $29.7 billion a year earlier.
   For the full year, GM's earnings rose 36.9 percent to $4.86
billion, or $14.34 a share, from $3.55 billion, or $10.06 a share,
in 1987. Annual revenue rose to $123.6 billion from $114.9 billion a
year earlier.
   The per-share earnings do not reflect a 2-for-1 stock split GM
announced last week payable March 31 for shareholders of record Feb.
17.
   The 1988 results include revenue and profits for the company's
Electronic Data Systems, GM Hughes Electronics and General Motors
Acceptance Corp. subsidiaries, which reported their results
separately on Monday.
   The 1988 figures for GM included a one time gain of $224.2
million from a first-quarter accounting change.
   GM's previous record annual profit was $4.5 billion in 1984.
   The annual profits announced so far by GM and Chrysler Corp.
combined with the nine-month results from Ford Motor Co., which was
expected to announce its annual earnings on Thursday, totaled about
$10.05 billion for 1988. The previous annual record for the Big
Three was $9.79 billion in 1984.
   ``In the big picture, it's quite a bit better than it was in
'87,'' said auto analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
of New York. However, he said the figures showed stiff competition
in the marketplace, and the costs of sales incentives may affect
future profits.
   GM Chairman Roger Smith and President Robert Stempel said the
corporation's overall earnings were higher because of solid vehicle
sales overseas and a resurgence of North American operations.
   The company said it was issuing profit-sharing checks to about
470,000 employees, with the typical check amounting to about $254
per eligible employee.
   GM did not issue profit-sharing checks for the past two years
because of slumping North American performance. Profit sharing for
workers represented by the United Auto Workers union is tied to the
company's U.S. revenue.
   Healy and another analyst, Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co.,
said GM earned about $500 million in North America during 1988
following a year in which those operations pretty much broke even.
   While Brady was upbeat about the North American performance,
Healy said: ``If they earned $5 billion and only $500 million was on
the North American side. It's still disproportionate with overseas
and GMAC.''
   GM's operations overseas last year earned $2.7 billion, compared
with the $1.9 billion they earned outside North America during 1987.
   ``Although still below desired levels of profitability, GM's
North American operations achieved substantial profit improvement
and made significant progress in terms of both product
competitiveness and improved operating efficiency,'' they said.
   Part of the increase in earnings, analysts said, was due to GM's
cost-cutting program, especially in North America.
   GM said it cut $4.8 billion in costs last year, bringing its
total cost savings to $8.5 billion since its expense-reduction
program began two years ago.

   Government prosecutors questioned dozens of
stock brokerage officers and employees Tuesday in a probe into a
multimillion dollar illegal trading scandal, an attorney general's
office source said.
   Four top officers from Mexico's two biggest brokerage firms were
arrested Monday on fraud charges. The source, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said up to 150 more arrests may follow.
   The investigation followed complaints filed by at least 200
investors against all but one of Mexico's 24 registered brokerage
firms after stockholders lost about $7 million in the October 1987
crash.
   The alleged violations ranged from insider trading in both stocks
and foreign currencies to the sale of nonexistent Treasury
certificates and trading in securities without the consent of their
clients.
   Alfredo Harp Helu, president of the Mexican Stock Exchange, said
the National Securities Commission had determined that the brokers
and employees ``only could be given administrative sanctions because
not one case of the activities (under investigation) can be
considered criminal.''
   Harp Helu said he did not know the identities of the brokers
under investigation or what charges they could face.
   Roberto Hoyo D'Addona, the Treasury's general prosecutor, told
reporters Monday the department began receiving complaints of fraud
after the stock market index plunged 74 percent in 28 trading days.
   He said Treasury agents also are investigating possible tax
evasion.
   Spokesmen for both the attorney general's office and the Treasury
Department, which is responsible for enforcing securities trading
and tax laws, declined to comment on Tuesday's interviews.
   Among those arrested were Eduardo Legorreta, board chairman and
one of the founders of Operadora de Bolsa, one of the Mexico's two
leading trading firms, and Jaime Ceballos Cervantes, the company's
director of investment promotions.
   Legorreta, 44, is a member of one of Mexico's wealthiest
families. His arrest at a Mexico City restaurant Monday night shook
the country's business community.
   Also arrested were Juan Carlos Fernandez Cuevo and Jose Francisco
Rodriguez Dupont of Mexicana de Valores e Inversiones, the other
major brokerage firm.
   Gustavo Diaz, president of an association formed by the wronged
investors, has estimated the brokerage firms netted $43.5 million in
profits from the alleged illegal dealing.
   Market prices started dropping at the close of business on the
stock exchange Monday before the arrests, amid rumors of impending
action by the government. The 52-stock price index dropped by a
little less than 1 percent as sales increased.
   Tuesday opened with another spurt of sales, but at the close of
business the market recovered and the 52-stock price index was
slightly up by 40 points to 211,841.
   The Mexican securities and exchange commission announced it was
implanting a series of regulations, effective immediately, to
prevent future fraud.
   In a statement, the commission said the new regulations include
an automatic system to monitor daily trading and mandatory outside
auditing for all brokerage firms.

   With Ghidella at the helm, Fiat outbid Ford to acquire
financially troubled Alfa Romeo in 1987 for $5.7 billion, about

<HEAD>Toymaker Says 1988 Profit Of $35.9 Million Demonstrates Recovery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAWTHORNE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mattel Inc. said Tuesday that two years
of belt-tightening and refocusing on such tried-and-true toys as
Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels toy cars paid off in a modest 1988
profit of $35.9 million.
   That is far less than the $80 million Mattel earned in 1985, but
a vast improvement from losses of $8.3 million in 1986 and $113.2
million in 1987.
   The $35.9 million profit reported Tuesday amounts to 75 cents a
share. Sales in 1988 were $990 million, compared with $1 billion in
1987.
   In 1988's fourth quarter, Mattel earned $10.5 million, or 22
cents a share, compared with a $100.7 million loss in the fourth
quarter of 1987. Sales in the quarter were $287.6 million, up from
$233.8 million a year earlier.
   ``Our plan to return the company to solid profitability is on
course,'' John Amerman, chairman and chief executive, said in a
statement.
   In addition to Barbie and Hot Wheels, the company said it enjoyed
retail success with the Little Miss Makeup doll and a line of
Disney-themed toys for toddlers and pre-schoolers.
   The 1987 loss was blamed on a restructuring program that included
laying off 500 employees at Mattel's headquarters, closing several
plants overseas and doing away with marginal toy lines.
   The 1986 loss was blamed in large part on slumping sales of the
once-popular Masters of the Universe toys.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Long Island Lighting Co. and representatives
of its nearly 1 million ratepayers signed an agreement Tuesday to
settle a racketeering lawsuit against the utility.
   The agreement calls for a reduction of $390 million in planned
rate increases over 10 years beginning in June 1990. It also
establishes a $10 million fund for claims by former Lilco ratepayers
and requires the utility to pick up the ratepayers' legal costs.
   The agreement does not address the closing of Lilco's Shoreham
nuclear power plant. However, Judith Vladeck, who represents the
ratepayers, said she agreed to the settlement ``based on my
understanding that Shoreham will shortly be closed and thereafter
dismantled.''
   Joseph McDonnell, a vice president for communications at Lilco,
hailed the agreement, saying it will ``return the company to
financial health.''
   However, McDonnell criticized a resolution unanimously adopted
Tuesday by Suffolk County legislators as a condition for a county
agreement with Lilco. The resolution said Lilco must ``irrevocably
withdraw'' its request for an operating license for Shoreham and
close and dismantle the plant.
   Construction of the Shoreham plant, located 60 miles east of
Manhattan, began in 1973 and has cost $5.4 billion but has not
resulted in generation of any power because of state and county
concerns about how Long Island could be safely evacuated during a
nuclear emergency.
   McDonnell said the utility was interested in negotiating with
Suffolk but the legislators' resolution was ``unreasonable.''
   The agreement came one day after U.S. District Judge Jack B.
Weinstein, who last week dismissed the racketeering suit filed by
Suffolk County, granted the ratepayers the right to sue the utility
as a class.
   Weinstein said his rulings meant that should his dismissal be
overturned on appeal, Lilco would be liable to pay the ratepayers at
least $4 billion in damages and ``will be forced into bankruptcy
since its assets will not suffice to pay the judgment.''
   The county, in negotiating with Lilco over whether to appeal
Weinstein's ruling, hoped to use the threat of a bankrupting damage
award to force Lilco to agree to close the Shoreham plant.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, speaking in Albany prior to the settlement,
predicted a ratepayers agreement would put pressure on Suffolk
officials to cut a similar deal.
   ``They could appeal, but for what?'' asked Cuomo, a Shoreham
opponent who labeled the nuclear power plant ``the most confusing
situation I've had to deal with as governor.''
   The agreement with the ratepayers also includes a promise by
Lilco to establish a Citizens Advisory Panel which would include
representatives of consumers and businesses to improve service and
lower electric rates.
   The agreement will be subject to two fairness hearings next month
so consumers can comment on the plan, which still needs approval
from the Lilco board of directors and shareholders.
