   TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who has
threatened a libel suit for a stripper's story of an alleged sexual
liaison with him, said Wednesday that he knows of another effort
being planned to discredit him.
   Speaking to about 600 people at his Family Worship Center,
Swaggart again accused Penthouse magazine of scheming to destroy his
ministry with a story in which Catherine Mary Kampen said she
performed sex acts for him while he watched.
   Without revealing any details, Swaggart said his ministry had
uncovered another move against him. Swaggart said the plan involved
different people.
   ``There's another effort afoot, as preposterous as this one ...
If you have enough money you can get anyone to say anything,''
Swaggart said.
   Kampen's allegations are similar to those raised last year by a
prostitute, Debra Murphree, which led to Swaggart's ouster from the
Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal denomination, and reversed the
fortunes of Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries.
   Kampen's employer labeled the stripper's allegations, detailed in
Penthouse's current issue, ``a pornographic fairy tale.'' The
magazine said Monday that it was standing by its article.
   On Monday, Swaggart said there was ``not one shred of truth to
these allegations. I have never met or seen the woman.'' Swaggart's
attorneys said they had evidence the story was a hoax, but refused
to discuss specifics.
   Wednesday night, Swaggart said the ministry was approached by a
man in December who knew of Kampen's allegations ``and spilled his
insides ... he said he believed it was a hoax.''
   Swaggart also said a woman he identified as Kampen's employer
also called the ministry and said she knew the story was false.
Swaggart did not reveal the caller's name.
   Rhonda Shear, co-owner of a ``strip-o-gram'' service that employs
Kampen in New Orleans, said Monday that her sister, Nona, told her
Kampen made up the story after seeing the Penthouse story on
Murphree's relations with Swaggart.
   Shear's sister, contacted in New Orleans, said a lawyer had
advised her not to comment. Efforts to reach Kampen for comment have
been unsuccessful.
   Swaggart said the man who revealed Kampen's story to the ministry
had told him Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione was angry because of
Swaggart's work in pressuring convenience stores to discontinue
carrying the men's magazine.
   A telephone call after business hours Wednesday, seeking comment
from Penthouse's spokesmen at their New York City offices was not
answered.
   Swaggart said that during the past year, he had ``learned not to
judge people. I've learned that I'm not God.'' He also advised his
congregation not to ``get to the point where it's `us' and `them.'''
   His ministry would continue with expanded television programming
to China, Brazil and the Netherlands, Swaggart said. ``We are going
to go forward to tell the story of Jesus Christ as we have never
gone forth before,'' he said.

   President Bush said in a telegram to
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega that he was ``willing to work for
peace,'' Ortega said Wednesday.
   Ortega also met on Wednesday with former President Carter and
President-elect Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela. Ortega and Carter
both are in Venezuela for Perez' inauguration ceremonies this week.
   Ortega brought with him a new peace proposal which he showed to
Perez, Carter and others.
   Carter declined to discuss specifics, but told reporters it dealt
with Nicaragua and its neighbor, Honduras, which the U.S.-backed
Nicaraguan rebels have used as a base for some operations.
   A source close to Vice President Dan Quayle, who is in Venezuela
for Perez' inauguration, said the plan had to do with resettlement
of rebels in Nicaragua once peace is achieved.
   Contra leader Alfredo Cesar said that Socialist international
leaders familiar with the plan told him it also contained provisions
for political prisoners in Nicaraqua and for granting civil
liberties in the country.
   Ortega said in a live interview on Venezuela television that he
sent a letter of congratulations to Bush after the new U.S.
president's inauguration, and that Bush sent him a telegram in
response ``in which he said he was willing to work for peace.''
   Ortega said he reminded Bush of the time they shook hands at the
inauguration of Brazilian President Jose Sarney in 1985, when Bush
was vice president, and how ``all the leaders of the world applauded
this unanimously.''
   In a press conference after the interview, Ortega said that ``the
conditions are not yet ripe for a direct dialogue'' between the
United States and Nicaragua.
   Ortega said he would be meeting with Honduran President Jose
Azcona Hoyos and other Central American presidents this week in
Caracas to discuss regional problems.
   ``This will give us an opportunity to talk about common problems
(including) the (peace) plan, its advances, and a meeting of Central
American presidents,'' he said.
   Ortega's meeting with Azcona on Wednesday would be before a
meeting Azcona plans to hold with Quayle on Friday.
   Azcona said this week that the five Central American presidents
have agreed to a summit on Feb. 14-15 in San Salvador to discuss the
peace plan, adopted in August 1987.
   The presidents are expected to be in Caracas for the Perez
inauguration.
   After meeting with Ortega and Carter, Perez said in a communique
that the meeting was ``a great step towards the solution to the
problem of Central America and Nicaragua,'' although it did not
elaborate.
   It emphasized that Carter was not acting as a representative of
the U.S. government during his stay here.
   The former president moderated a forum on the Latin American
foreign debt and noted in his brief comments that last year alone
poor nations transferred $35 billion to rich countries in debt
payments.
   ``We must seek solutions to the crises of nations, desperately
poor and suffering, who spend sometimes half their export earnings
just to pay interest on their debt and in the process the debt
continues to increase,'' Carter said.
   ``This reunion of world leaders is a wonderful opportunity to
assess this crucial problem,'' he said.

   Schools were ordered closed for the rest of the week in North
Dakota amid warnings that temperatures would go to 40 below, as the
Alaska-born cold blast pushed south and east, stretching the big
chill from the Pacific to Oklahoma.
   Closed roads and icy highways took their toll as at least one
motorist was killed in a 17-vehicle pileup in Idaho, a tour bus
crashed on an icy stretch of Sierra Nevada interstate and 100-car
string of accidents occurred near Seattle.
   ``February is going to be quite different from January,'' said
Bob Snider, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Ann
Arbor, Mich.
   Midwesterners who chuckled at the weather in Alaska over the
weekend while polishing their golf clubs got their comeuppance as
winter set in with a vengeance. The normally rainy Pacific Northwest
got a rare snowfall, and Easterners counted the waning hours of
springlike weather as the cold front moved their way.
   Bellingham, Wash., reported gusts over 100 mph early Wednesday
and 60 mph by midday, knocking out power to as many as 15,000
customers. Snow caved in the roof of Everett's soccer center,
causing $250,000 damage, officials said.
   At least 20 people were injured when a tour bus carrying about
two dozen passengers overturned on icy, wind-swept Interstate 80 in
the Sierra Nevada, and six people were hospitalized, the California
Highway Patrol reported.
   The big winter storm, with 60 mph gusts, knocked out electrical
power to a ``big chunk'' of Salt Lake City on Wednesday night, with
blackouts extending 40 miles to Ogden, said Utah Power &amp; Light Co.
spokesman Dave Eskelsen.
   Eskelsen said engineers believed the outage was the result of
``dirty rain'' coating insulators on power poles and blowing fuses,
and some crews had reports of burning power poles.
   In northern Minnesota, authorities blamed a night of minus
20-degree temperatures for the hypothermia death of a 31-year-old
woman whose frozen body was found on a sidewalk in Coleraine.
   As the cold pushed into the country Wednesday, temperatures fell
18 degrees in one hour at Ardmore, Okla., the National Weather
Service said. Russell, Kan., which shared the nation's high of 84
degrees Tuesday afternoon, had readings in the lower teens a day
later and wind chills in the 30-below-zero range.
   With North Dakota's wind chills expected to dip as low as 80
degrees below over the next several days, Gov. George Sinner ordered
all schools to close until Monday.
   ``The weather forecast for the next two days calls for bitter
cold to the extent that our young people are at risk, particularly
those being transported to school,'' Sinner said.
   A wind-chill reading of 90 below was recorded Wednesday morning
at Tioga, in northwestern North Dakota. The wind chill reading at
mid-afternoon was 67 below at Williston.
   In Idaho, where high winds and chill temperatures forced the
closing of many roads, crews worked to clear wreckage from a pileup
on Interstate 84. Eight semi trucks and nine other vehicles were
involved, and at least one person was killed, said Lt. David Neal of
the Idaho State Police in Twin Falls.
   Not counting Alaska, Cut Bank, Mont., was the nation's icebox at
midday Wednesday, with a reading of 31 below zero, and temperatures
in the state were forecast to dip below 40 below by Thursday
morning. Electric power in Great Falls, a city of 57,000, and
several smaller towns in north-central Montana was knocked out for
nearly an hour Wednesday morning when the Black Eagle hydroelectric
dam broke down.
   ``We don't know what caused it,'' said Cort Freeman, Montana
Power Co. spokesman. ``There's a lot of things that can happen in
weather like this.''
   In Alaska, where it all began as the thermometer went as low as
60 below over the weekend, temperatures moderated Wednesday over
much of the state except for the area near the Canadian border.
While Anchorage was reporting just 11 degrees below zero and no
wind, Northway on the Alaska Highway near the Yukon had a 7 a.m.
reading of 59 below.
   Northway posted an extreme of another sort when the barometric
pressure reached 31.85 inches late Tuesday, a record high-pressure
reading for the North American continent. The reading there eased
off Wednesday morning but was still a high 31.31 inches. It was the
effects of the high pressure system on the jet stream that created
the unusual weather pattern.
   The barometric pressure was so high that the Federal Aviation
Adminitration early Wednesday issued an order restricting instrument
and night flights over Alaska, saying that altimeters that use
barometric pressure might not calculate a plane's altitude
accurately at that high pressure.
   The snowfall at Seattle was enough to shut all runways at
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport for nearly an hour Wednesday
morning. The snowfall at the airport, 2 inches and counting at
midmorning, plus temperatures in the teens made it the worst wintry
weather in Seattle in more than three years.
   In the Plains, agriculture experts said the cold snap could
reduce the evaporation from farm fields, already dry from last
summer's drought and the dry winter. But that was the only good news
for farmers in the forecast.
   Fruit growers worried that trees had begun to bud in the warmth
and would now be in danger; the thirsty winter wheat crop in the
southern Plains faced new stresses without the blanket of snow that
usually keeps it safe during the winter; and ranchers across the
Plains worked Wednesday to shelter cattle from the sudden cold.
   ``Now we've got something that's unbelieveable _ record highs,
and suddenly within one day we go to cold temperatures,'' said Steve
Baenziger of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln agronomy department.
   But in the East, record highs continued to topple Wednesday. In
Buffalo, N.Y., normally known for its wintry weather, the record
high for the date of 53, set just last year, was broken at 3 a.m.
with a reading of 56 degrees. There was no snow on the ground, and
Lake Erie was not frozen.
   It was 66 in Boston; 67 in New York City; 67 in Newark; 59 in
Columbus, Ohio; and 70 in Roanoke, Va., all records for the date.
   As winter swept toward the Great Lakes region, ski operators said
it couldn't come soon enough.
   ``The crowds just don't see snow, and it stops them from coming
out,'' said Sherry Gerych, ticket office manager at Mount Brighton
Ski Area in Michigan. ``As soon as it hits, we'll get ourselves
fixed up again.''

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Guerrillas Reject Lawyers For Treason Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four African National Congress
guerrillas have refused legal representation for their treason
trial. They said they did not recognize the court's authority and
would not enter a plea.
   The four black men, in a statement read by one to the Circuit
Court in Delmas on Wednesday, said South Africa's judicial system
``is founded on injustice and oppression.''
   The defendants, who could face the death penalty if convicted,
are charged with treason, terrorism, murder, attempted murder and
other offenses in connection with a mine blast that wounded 17
people in 1986 and the killings of two policemen, a black politician
and a black woman.
   The four, who said they have been tortured during eight months in
solitary confinement, are Obed Masina, 56; Ting-ting Masango, 28;
Neo Potsane, 26, and Joseph Makhura, 26.
   In their statement, read by Masina, they acknowledged their
membership in the military wing of the African National Congress and
described themselves as soldiers who should not be tried in a
civilian court.
   Dozens of supporters in the courtroom raised clenched fists and
cheered when Masina said the four would not enter a plea.
   The guerrilla group was outlawed in 1960 after decades of
non-violent political activity and has been waging a bombing and
sabotage campaign since 1961 aimed at ending white minority rule.
   Delmas is a farming town about 30 miles east of Johannesburg. The
country's longest treason trial, involving senior anti-apartheid
leaders who last year received long prison terms, began there in
1985 before shifting to Pretoria.
   Under the country's apartheid system, South Africa's 26 million
blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites
control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and
health services.

<HEAD>Taiwan Officials Concerned Gambling Will Disrupt Booming Economy</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With money pouring from a booming export
business, a lust for gambling has taken hold and turned this
Nationalist Chinese island into a massive underground casino.
Officials say it threatens to disrupt the economy.
   The gambling craze is attributed to the flood of idle cash
created by Taiwan's economic success and of limited investment
opportunities.
   ``It's worse than a huge casino,'' said a dismayed Jaw Shao-kang,
a legislator of the governing Nationalist Party. ``We don't even
have fair gambling rules and decent bookies.''
   Gambling is illegal in Taiwan, but an estimated 2 million people,
or roughly one-tenth the population, play an underground game based
on results of a twice-weekly lottery in nearby Hong Kong.
   They are lured by the chance to win 10 to 500 times their bets,
which typically are 500 Taiwan dollars ($18) or more. Only a tiny
fraction of players, about 6,000 people, were arrested or fined last
year.
   The game became a favorite with farmers, factory workers and
market vendors after the government suspended its own lottery in
1987 to break up underground gambling based on the drawing.
   On Tuesdays and Thursdays, when the Hong Kong lottery is held,
Taiwan's telephone lines are jammed by people calling bookies for
results.
   Gamblers pray to folk gods for winning numbers and often
celebrate at Buddhist temples when they win.
   ``The lottery gamblers have gone too far,'' fumed Ching
Mei-hsien, principal of Taipei's Fu Shing Primary School, which is
near such a temple. ``Their noisy celebrations often disrupt our
students in class.''
   Taiwan's two largest cities, Taipei and Kaohsiung, recently
proposed running their own lotteries to raise funds for social
welfare programs. Cabinet approval is needed for the drawings to
begin later this year.
   Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Taiwanese have turned to gambling
on futures prices on commodity markets in Chicago and New York.
   An estimated 500 local companies, including jewelry shops and
investment firms, accept daily bets totaling about 5 billion Taiwan
dollars ($179 million) based on the movement of futures prices on
the overseas markets, according to Martin Tsai, a financial
consultant with the Alliance International Law Office, which advises
businesses and government agencies.
   Newspapers estimate each company has about 160 clients, meaning
about 80,000 people gamble on commodity prices.
   Even the local stock exchange is widely viewed as little more
than a legal form of gambling. Many inexperienced players such as
housewives, office clerks, retired servicemen and college students
view the market solely as a way to make quick money through
speculation.
   The exchange reported in January that about 1.66 million people
have opened accounts with stock brokers. Trading volume totaled the
Taiwan dollar equivalent of about $280 billion last year, the third
largest in the world after New York and Tokyo.
   On average, each of the total 34 billion shares changed hands
nearly three times last year, even though roughly two-thirds of the
shares were closely held and not for sale.
   Frederick Chien, chairman of the state-run Council for Economic
Planning and Development, believes the gambling craze has changed
traditional values that helped Taiwan improve its economy
dramatically, with per capita annual income in 1988 of 157,400
Taiwan dollars ($5,512), a 56 percent increase from 1983.
   ``So many people are obsessed with speculation,'' Chien said.
``They want to become rich overnight, and they no longer work so
hard for the money.''
   In a recent speech, Economics Minister Chen Li-an said the trend
could eventually erode Taiwan's economic achievement. He complained
that businesmen increasingly prefer the pursuit of quick profit
through gambling and speculation over productive investment.
   Liu Shou-hsiang, an economics professor at Chinese Culture
University in Taipei, said the lack of channels for investment is a
major reason behind the upswing in gambling. Most bonds are
purchased by banks, real estate is too expensive and only a few
mutual funds are allowed.
   The government has taken some steps to help open up new
investment opportunities in recent years, easing foreign exchange
controls to stimulate overseas investment.
   Some Taiwanese still fear overseas investments as an unknown
risk, however, and have been reluctant to diversify.

   A man whose pregnant wife has been in a coma
for seven weeks urged asked a judge Wednesday to appoint him her
legal guardian so he can authorize an abortion that he says will
save her life.
   Martin Klein's 32-year-old wife, Nancy, was critically injured in
a car collision on Dec. 13 and is in a coma at north Shore
University Hospital in Manhasset.
   Klein, 34, a self-employed accountant who lives in Upper
Brookville on Long Island, told the court that physicians have
advised him that an abortion is necessary to save his wife's life
and assist in her recovery.
   His petition is opposed by anti-abortion activists John Short and
John Broderick, who have asked the court to be appointed legal
guardians of the fetus, which is about 16 to 18 weeks old.
   The case, considered unprecedented by legal and medical experts,
is being heard by Justice Bernard McCaffrey of the trial-level state
Supreme Court.
   Mrs. Klein's parents, Anne and Frederick Zusselman of Delray,
Fla., attended Wednesday's hearing and said they too were in favor
of ending their daughter's pregnancy.
   Mrs. Zusselman told the court that her daughter and son-in-law,
who have a 3-year-old daughter, had been looking forward to having a
second child.
   Asked if she agreed that ending the pregnancy was in her
daughter's best interest, Mrs. Zusselman replied: ``Absolutely.''
   Three physicians, called to testified by Klein's attorney Sidney
Schutz, said that a continued pregnancy could endanger Mrs. Klein's
well-being.
   Dr. Joseph Smith, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at
Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said he felt strongly that
ending the pregnancy was necessary to save her life and should be
done immediately, he said.
   ``A continuation of this pregnancy would push her over the
cliff,'' Smith said.
   Dr. Robert Carras, chief of neurosurgery at North Shore, said
that the prognosis for Mrs. Klein was guarded because of the
pregnancy and other conditions.
   The Nassau County district attorney's office was allowed to
monitor the proceedings to ``ensure that there is no criminal
violation of law,'' according to Assistant District Attorney Wayne
Kiernan.
   Schutz objected to the prosecutor's involvement. ``What is this
nonsense of a criminal statute?'' he said. ``We are doing nothing
criminal here. We are only asking the court to appoint an guardian
for the welfare of a woman in a coma.''
   The case was continued to Thursday, at which time the judge was
expected to consider the petitions of the two Right-To-Life
advocates.

   Police arrested about 20 people during a
protest against Romania's alleged repression of ethnic Hungarians
and its campaign of demolishing villages, a spokeswoman for the
activists said.
   The demonstration outside the Romanian Embassy was organized by
members of the Polish Socialist Party and Solidarity trade union
movement, said the spokeswoman, Zuzanna Dabrowska. Both
organizations are banned.
   Ms. Dabrowska said a small group of protesters on Tuesday
gathered in front of the embassy and shouted ``We are in solidarity
with the Romanians.''
   The group distributed leaflets to about 100 people across the
street from the embassy before police began making arrests.
   ``We would like Feb. 1 to become the day of solidarity with the
Romanian nation. The situation there has not changed and it's
important we establish such a tradition,'' Dabrowska said.
   Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu's plan to demolish up to 7,000
villages in his Soviet bloc country and replace them with huge
agro-industrial complexes has been widely criticized as a flagrant
violation of human rights.
   Hungary is particularly concerned that many of the villages to be
razed are inhabited by ethnic Hungarians, and last year the official
Polish press pointed out that a few of the villages are populated by
ethnic Poles.

<HEAD>Israelis Debate The Once-Unthinkable: Talking To The PLO</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Spurred by the U.S. decision to open talks with
the PLO, Israelis have embarked on a serious debate about a subject
once virtually taboo here: talking peace with the Palestinian
organization.
   The subject is debated almost daily on radio shows and in
newspaper columns. At least two members of the left-leaning Labor
Party, Cabinet Minister Ezer Weizman and ex-Minister Abba Eban, have
called for talking to Yasser Arafat's representatives.
   The broad-based Peace Now movement recently changed its position
to support talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``We must speak with them, we must listen, we must exchange
words.... We have to talk to those we want to make peace with,''
said Galia Golan, a leading Peace Now figure.
   She and Eban are attending a conference on the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Amsterdam along with PLO officials,
despite an Israeli law against meetings with members of
``terrorist'' organizations.
   For many Israelis, accepting the PLO is not just a political but
a psychological hurdle.
   For years, they have associated it with atrocities, such as the
1972 massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games in Munich.
   But a public opinion poll late last year indicated 54 percent of
Israelis support talks with the PLO, provided the organization
renounces terrorism and accepts Israel's right to exist.
   The change in opinion is due in part to the Palestinian uprising
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and in part to Arafat's statements
in December renouncing terrorism and accepting Israel's existence.
   Strong tactics aimed at quelling the 13-month uprising, or
intefadeh, have brought international criticism of Israel. At least
370 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have died in the rebellion.
   ``Before the intefadeh, we saw the Palestinians in the occupied
territories as construction workers, and Palestinians outside were
terrorists,'' said Moshe Amirov, who was kicked out of the
right-wing Likud bloc for holding talks with pro-PLO figures two
years ago. ``Now there is a whole new image: the image of a
14-year-old boy who throws stones, and who cannot be beaten by our
army.''
   The PLO chief's new moderate stance has isolated Israel.
   The United States agreed to open a dialogue with the PLO in
December, and several European nations are urging Israel to do the
same.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likud
bloc, repeated Tuesday he would never speak to the PLO. His party's
coalition agreement with Labor takes that stand, but dovish members
of Labor are starting to call for changes.
   At least two Labor members are among the four Israeli legislators
who have attended meetings along with PLO officials in the past
month.
   Weizman, a former air force officer and defense minister, said in
an interview with the Jerusalem Post last week Shamir should drop
the ban on talking to the PLO.
   ``Today the only party able to deliver what it promises in the
territories _able to bring about an end to the rioting _ is the
PLO,'' he said.
   But opponents _ including Likud, which won the most votes in
November elections _ say the PLO has not changed, despite Arafat's
statements.
   ``The bottom line is they want a Palestinian state in Judea and
Samarea just as a down payment to throw us out of here,'' said Likud
member Tzahi Hanegbi. Judea and Samarea are the biblical names of
the occupied West Bank.
   Security risks are a persuasive argument. Even Israelis who
support talks with the PLO are aware of the risk a Palestinian state
might pose to the Jewish state.
   Israelis have fought five wars with Arab states in 40 years and
still remember the vulnerable narrow borders before Israel captured
the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEAD>Pachyderm With Proper Posture To Take Up Burden Of Buddha's Tooth</HEAD>

   It takes a special tusker to carry
Buddha's tooth.
   That task will fall to Indiraja, a 4,884-pound elephant from
India named in honor of the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
   But Indiraja, who will be shipped to Sri Lanka next week to begin
years of training in the sacred service of Buddha, has a tough act
to follow.
   The new elephant will replace Raja, a popular pachyderm who
served for half a century at the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy,
according to Neranjan Wijeratne, the temple's chief custodian. Raja
was long in the tooth himself, reaching the age of 82 before dying
in July.
   The 13-year-old Indiraja, also a male, was selected for his
proper posture so that he may carry the sacred tooth of Buddha in
one of Asia's most colorful pageants.
   ``It will take couple of years to train the elephant,'' Wijeratne
said Wednesday. He picked out Indiraja during a visit to India after
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi announced plans to donate an elephant to
the temple in Kandy, 50 miles east of Colombo.
   The death of the beloved Raja, whose name means ``King'' in the
Sinhalese language, plunged Sinhalese Buddhists into grief. Raja was
so popular that former President Junius R. Jayewardene declared him
a national treasure.
   Indiraja, who will arrive in Sri Lanka on Feb. 8, measures 7{
feet from head to toe and has a flat back. Both his tail and trunk
touch the ground in the arc deemed proper for elephants.
   The main task for Indiraja will be carrying the sacred tooth,
revered as coming from Buddha's own mouth, at the annual Kandy
pageant, which is held for two weeks in July and August.
   Because Indiraja still will be in training at the time of this
year's festivities, the Temple Committe is trying to find a local
male elephant _ only males can carry the tooth _ for the task.
   Efforts are on either to reduce the amount of fireworks and noise
so that the untrained elephant won't panic, or have an elephant who
is unaffected by noise and fireworks in the tooth-carrying ceremony.
   According to historians, the tooth was smuggled into Sri Lanka
from India in the 4th century for safekeeping during a war.
   The tooth is kept in a golden casket at the temple at Kandy.
During the festival, it is paraded around the town on an elephant's
back.
   Buddhism was founded in India about 500 B.C. when Siddhartha
Gautama, born a prince, achieved enlightenment. He later came to be
known as Lord Buddha.
   Sinhalese Buddhists make up about 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people. There are about 5 million Buddhists in India.

   Teacher Mary Alice Blanton has received
honors from law officers for trying to fight off a gunman who
invaded her school a year ago. But she is proudest that no children
were harmed in the 12-hour ordeal.
   ``I thought about that when I heard of children getting killed
and wounded at other schools in the country recently,'' she said.
``I was glad our children didn't have to see any blood. Blood is
life.''
   Recent shootings at schools in California and Washington, D.C.,
``made me realize how thankful I am that it wasn't our school,''
said Dan Carden, headmaster of the West End Christian School. ``We
don't want to turn our schools into prisons, but we've got to do
something to protect our children.''
   West End Christian School is planning to build another campus, he
said, ``and the first thing we thought about is security.''
   Last Feb. 2, James Harvey, wearing denim clothes, a baseball-type
cap and carrying several guns, entered the school's elementary
building at 8:30 a.m., accompanied by an unwitting accomplice, and
took more than 80 children hostage.
   Harvey allowed his companion to leave in the middle of the day
but he remained until 8:30 p.m., when officers subdued him as he
emerged after hearing a videotaped fae pardon sent from Montgomery
by Gov. Guy Hunt.
   As the hours of the seige crept along, Harvey at times allowed
groups of hostage children to go free, but at the end Mrs. Blanton's
and another class _ 26 people in all _ were still in their rooms.
   Harvey pleaded guilty in October to charges he kidnapped 110
children and adults at the private school, and was sentenced to a
life term and five 20-year terms, with the judge recommending
psychiatric help.
   Two of Carden's children, Chris and Kevin, were in the third and
first grades.
   Kevin, Carden said, doesn't seem to show any after-affects but
Chris has developed a fear of being left alone at times.
   When Kevin was freed that night, Carden said, the child's only
complaint was, ``I didn't get to eat my lunch.''
   When released, most children tended to react to their parents'
emotions, he said. ``The reason some kids were crying was because
their parents were crying.''
   Alan Goodwin, director of the Indian Rivers Mental Health Center
who was called in that day to try to alleviate concerns of parents,
said he believes the children have bounced back remarkably.
   Michael Roberts of the psychology department at the University of
Alabama is working with colleagues in other cities where gunmen have
appeared at schools to develop ways to help children.
   ``It's amazing, but there have been very little psychological
studies of such things,'' Roberts said. ``We're trying to come up
with a network to study long-range effects.''
   When Harvey entered Mrs. Blanton's room, she attacked him with a
Bible story book before he ordered his accomplice to tie her up with
tape.
   ``I feel like when the children are at school they are my
children and I have to take care of them,'' she said.
   After Harvey pleaded guilty, the Madison County Sheriff's
Department made Mrs. Blanton an honorary member, and last week the
Tuscaloosa Fraternal Order of Police gave her a certificate
signifying she had done more for law enforcement in Tuscaloosa in
1988 than anyone other than officers.
   While in the school, Harvey demanded to see an Associated Press
reporter, and told the reporter he was trying to make a statement on
behalf of the nation's homeless and hungry.
   Carden, 35, said in an interview this week that he had expected
enrollment to drop because of the takeover, ``but we didn't lose a
single student. We have 410 enrolled now compared to 360 then.''
   Meanwhile, with the elementary building separate from the rest of
the school, Carden has taken steps to try to prevent any recurrence.
An inter-com and a telephone line have been installed in the
building, and the school's athletic director, ``a big, burly man,''
spends a lot of time there.
   In addition,``panic doors'' have been installed, so no one can
enter without a key or without being admitted from the inside.

   Allen Ward has been barred from
coaching his 10-year-old daughter's intramural basketball team
because he has AIDS, but Ward hopes he won't be benched for long.
   Ward was dismissed last week after only one game as a volunteer
coach at Laurel Elementary School.
   Already, he has launched a petition drive to get himself
reinstated and to protest the Franklin County Community Schools
policy dealing with AIDS.
   ``The next step may be to keep me out of the school altogether,''
Ward said Tuesday. ``My daughter will be there for four more years
and if we let them defeat us now, I might not ever get to go to the
school.''
   Ward, 37, contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome from
tainted blood products during open-heart surgery in 1984.
   The disease, which attacks the body's immune system, is
transmitted primarily through bodily fluids, such as during sexual
contact, intravenous drug use and blood transfusions, but not
through casual contact.
   Ward volunteered to coach the team of fourth-, fifth- and
sixth-graders when his daughter Dande decided to play at the school,
60 miles southeast of Indianapolis.
   ``I have no physical contact with them at all,'' Ward said. ``I
might throw a basketball to them, but if they're going to get it
that way, we're all in trouble.''
   Principal Odell Calihan and Superintendent Don Jobe refused to
comment, saying only that they are following the school district's
policy.
   ``I know the situation, but I can't comment and I won't confirm
any names,'' Jobe said when asked about Ward's dismissal.
   ``It's just ignorance,'' Ward said. ``They haven't educated
themselves on AIDS and how it's transmitted. But the way the disease
is spreading, they ought to start getting educated. Four or five
years ago, I didn't think I'd ever come down with something like
this either.''
   A similar argument was made after school authorities in Kokomo
barred young Ryan White from his classes because he has AIDS. His
family later moved to another town and his story was told recently
in a television movie.
   Under the Franklin County school district's AIDS policy approved
in September, employees suspected of carrying the AIDS virus must
submit to a medical examination by a doctor selected by the school
board.
   If an employee tests positive for the virus, a committee decides
whether the employee is an immediate public health threat. The
superintendent serves on the committee and selects its members,
which include a public health physician and school officials.
   ``If it's not discrimination, I don't know what is,'' Ward said.
``The superintendent chooses who he wants on the committee, so he
can select people who support him. I can't even go to the meeting to
defend myself.''
   Ward said many of the basketball players' parents have signed a
petition to reinstate him as coach.
   ``I'd like to fight it and win it. But at this point in time,
we've been struggling just to make ends meet and we're not going to
be able to put out a lot of money,'' said Ward, whose family lives
on his Social Security payments and the salary from his wife's
factory job.
   Ward's wife, Theresa, has agreed to coach the team in the
meantime, but school officials say she first must be tested for the
AIDS virus. Until his case is resolved, Ward plans to attend games
as a spectator.
   ``My daughter is on the team and they can't keep me from going to
the games,'' he said. ``What I don't understand is what's the
difference if I'm sitting on the bench with the team as their coach,
telling them when to go in and when to come out, or sitting in the
bleachers as a parent with the other kids all around me, eating my
popcorn?''

   Parisians are calling on the national government to
pull the plug on a flood of boat-borne billboards that are pitching
products on the River Seine.
   The floating advertisements began popping up last month on the
river that run through the city's center.
   Alain Juppe, a deputy to Mayor Jacques Chirac, wrote to George
Sarre, in charge of river transport in the Socialist government,
demanding to know ``the measures he intends to take to remedy the
situation.''
   In a letter dated Tuesday and made public on Wednesday, Juppe
said the city bans advertising on the banks of the Seine, one of the
world's most romantic urban settings, but has no authority over
boats on the river.

   Iranian fundamentalists burst into a
student center and attacked with knives and chains Iranians who were
giving a presentation critical of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, an
Italian news agency reported.
   Four people were taken to a hospital in the northern Italian city
for knife wounds, cuts and bruises, the ANSA news agency reported.
   About 30 people were watching a documentary about Iran at the
University of Perugia's student center on Wednesday when the group
of pro-Khomeini activists burst in, ANSA said, quoting witnesses.
   Several students kicked out part of a locked door and fled, while
others were assaulted, the agency said. The assailants fled before
police arrived, according to ANSA.
   The injured included three Iranian students and a representative
of an Iranian group opposed to Khomeini, ANSA reported.
   Iran on Wednesday began celebrating the 10th anniversary of the
Islamic revolution that brought Khomeini to power.

<TEXT>
   Clayton K. Yeutter, outgoing U.S. trade
representative and President Bush's nominee be agriculture
secretary, was the guest of honor at a reception costing thousands
of dollars sponsored by Philip Morris Inc., the food, brewing and
tobacco conglomerate, according to The Washington Post.
   Yeutter, whose confirmation hearing for the agriculture post is
scheduled Thursday, did not check with his agency's ethics officer
to see whether it would be appropriate to accept the hospitality of
Philip Morris, said Roger Bolton, a spokesman for the trade office.
   ``He considered such approval unnecessary in light of his
imminent departure from the office,'' Bolton was quoted as telling
the Post in its Thursday editions.
   Earlier, the paper said, Bolton said that when the idea for the
reception first arose, Yeutter was planning to return to private
life and the reception was ``viewed here as a thank you for his
efforts on behalf of the tobacco industry at large while he was U.S.
trade representative.''
   If he is confirmed as secretary of agriculture, as expected, he
will oversee an agency whose policies directly affect Philip Morris'
business interests.
   Donald E. Campbell, deputy director of the Office of Government
Ethics, told of the situation but not Yeutter's name or the specific
executive posts, said, ``I've got problems with that,'' the
newspaper said.
   Then told who it was who had accepted his hospitality from a
major corporation with whom he did business as a government
official, Campbell said Yeutter should have sought an opinion from
his agency ethics officer, the Post said.

   The patient with the bug in her ear screamed, ``Get
that sucker!'' That rang a bell for her doctors who failed to nab
the critter with had been considered the best roach approach.
   The doctors were excited when the woman came to the hospital with
a cockroach in her ear. It was their long-awaited chance to try out
a squirt of the anesthetic lidocaine, which a report four years ago
said was the best way to remove a bug from an ear.
   ``With hurried anticipation, we sprayed the drug briskly into the
ear canal and quickly jumped back, fully expecting the beast to come
hurtling forth at first contact with the noxious substance,'' they
told their colleagues in a letter in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   Alas. Nothing happened. They tried again, this time dousing the
intruder with a bigger dose. Still nothing.
   ``Get that sucker outa my ear!'' the patient screamed.
   ``What a brilliant idea,'' the doctors agreed.
   They hooked up a wall suction device and gently slipped the tip
into the young women's ear. With a satisfying ``schloop!'' they
nabbed the roach.
   ``Got him!'' the doctors wrote. ``Sure enough, there he was,
plastered to the suction tip like a fly to flypaper.''
   The doctors, Jonathan Warren and Leo C. Rotello of the State
University of New York Health Science Center in Syracuse, conclude
with this advice for physicians faced with a stuck bug: If all else
fails, try sucking it out.

   Artist and teacher Elaine de Kooning
died Wednesday of lung cancer. She was 70.
   In November, she was diagnosed as having cancer after she entered
Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia to be treated for Lyme disease.
She had been hospitalized here the past two weeks and died around
4:30 a.m. Wednesday.
   Her works are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and
the Guggenheim Museum in New York and are featured in other
institutions throughout the country.
   ``I always say I'm an escape artist,'' she once told art critic
Rose Slivka when asked to describe her style. ``Style is something
I've always tried to avoid. I'm more interested in character.''
   She was married to Willem de Kooning, a renowned abstractionist.
Although she established herself as an art commentator and held
professorships at the University of New Mexico, University of
Pennsylvania and Yale University.
   She was born Elaine Catherine Fried in 1920. She attended Hunter
College then switched to the Leonardo da Vinci Art School in
Manhattan where she found friends active in the abstract and realism
movement.
   At about this time, she met de Kooning and they were married Dec.
9, 1943, about five years after she had become his private student.
   Her first solo exhibition was in 1952 at the Stable Gallery in
New York. Her most recent work was inspired by paleolithic cave
paintings of Lascaux in France and Altamira in Spain.
   In addition to her husband and sister, survivors include two
brothers, Conrad Fried, of Manhattan, and Peter Fried, of Freeport.

   Actress-singer Madonna and actor Sean
Penn apparently have reached an amicable agreement to end their
stormy three-year marriage and divide their property, court records
show.
   A divorce petition filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court
cited irreconcilable differences and seeks restoration of the pop
singer's former name, Madonna Ciccone.
   It also said community property and financial obligations shared
by the couple ``have been disposed of by written agreement.'' No
details were disclosed in the two-page petition filed Jan. 25.
   Madonna publicist Liz Rosenberg said last week Penn would get the
couple's Malibu home and the singer would keep their New York
apartment. Madonna recently bought a $2.9 million Hollywood Hills
home.
   ``That's it,'' Penn publicist Lois Smith said Wednesday. ``She
kept one and he kept the other.''
   The divorce action follows a Dec. 28 incident in which Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies were called to the
couple's Malibu home after the hot-tempered Penn allegedly beat
Madonna. No charges were filed.

   Muhammad Ali Champion Brand Co., owned by the ex-fighter, is

according to motorcycle stunt driver Evel Knievel, a spokesman for
Ali and senior vice president of his company.
   ``They only put it in about 60 stores. That's a breach of
promise,'' said Knievel. ``I don't know why they would do that.''
   The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, seeks $550
million in damages, as well as $30,000 for attorney's fees and money
owed to creditors.
   Arthur Morrison, the attorney for Ali's company, said K mart and
Melville backed out on their order when the Muhammad Ali shoe polish

   An attorney for Johnny Paycheck has asked
for a delay in the country singer's resentencing for the 1985 tavern
shooting of another man.
   Paycheck, 50, was convicted May 17, 1986, of aggravated assault
and tampering with evidence in the Dec. 19, 1985, shooting of Larry
Wise in a Hillsboro tavern. Wise was grazed in the forehead,
recovered and testified against Paycheck.
   The singer, best known for his song, ``Take this Job and Shove
It,'' has remained free while appealing his conviction and has been
doing concerts, lawyer Ralph Buss said Wednesday.
   Buss said he asked the Ohio Supreme Court on Wednesday to forbid
lower courts from taking any action in the case until the high court
rules on Paycheck's argument that a mandatory three-year prison
sentence for use of a firearm during a crime was imposed improperly.
   If the Supreme Court agrees, it would delay Paycheck's
resentencing scheduled for Monday in Highland County Common Pleas
Court.

<HEAD>Study Says People Often Misinterpret Home Pregnancy Test Results</HEAD>

   Home pregnancy tests are frequently misinterpreted
by ordinary people, says a report that questions whether the kits
should stay on the market even though they are accurate when
interpreted by lab workers.
   In a letter in today's New England Journal of Medicine, Drs.
Jocelyn M. Hicks of Children's Hospital in Washington and Mariet
Iosefsohn of George Washington University said they asked
secretaries, clerks, messengers and janitors to analyze 200 urine
samples using two brands of home pregnancy kits. Ten percent of the
results of one test and 13 percent of the results of the other were
wrong.
   However, when a lab technician used the kits, one was 100 percent
accurate. The other kit gave no false results, although the results
were indeterminate in four cases.
   The researchers noted that the manufacturers claim the home kits
are 90 percent accurate.
   ``It seems clear from our observations that the discrepant
results produced by laypersons were due more to difficulties in
using the home test kits and interpreting results than to problems
with the kits themselves,'' they wrote.

   Twenty off-duty Tallahassee police
officers who celebrated Ted Bundy's execution outside Florida State
Prison Jan. 24 did not violate departmental conduct policies, an
internal investigation showed.
   The investigation began after newspaper reports said a group of
officers celebrated Bundy's death Jan. 24 by singing songs like ``On
Top of Ol' Sparky'' at a gathering that had the spirit _ and alcohol
_ of a tailgate party.
   The investigation confirmed that one officer had been drinking,
but found that he was not acting maliciously when he told reporters
and others that he was Mel Tucker, Tallahassee's chief of police, a
spokesman said Tuesday.
   Investigator Ray Crew said he thought the media overplayed the
incident. ``I don't think there was any malicious intent. Police
officers are held to a higher standard of behavior, and that's not
always fair.''
   According to police spokesman Phil Kiracofe, interviews with
seven police officers and five civilian employees found that none of
the officers at the prison near Starke were intoxicated, which would
have violated police policy.

<HEAD>Study Concludes Allergies To Blame for All Asthma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study today concludes that virtually all asthma
attacks are triggered by allergies, challenging a widely held belief.
   Experts have long believed that asthma attacks in children and
young adults were usually caused by allergies, while in grownups
they were usually thought to have other causes.
   The study, based on tests of 2,657 people, suggests that all
asthma victims have the allergic variety, regardless of age.
   ``This helps us to understand better why allergic and
non-allergic asthma look so much the same,'' said Dr. Benjamin
Burrows. ``It's all the same disease.''
   Burrows, a researcher at the University of Arizona College of
Medicine, published his results in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
   His team's conclusions were based largely on measurements of an
antibody called immunoglobulin E, or IgE, which plays a key role in
the allergic response that leads to asthma. Youngsters with asthma
have high amounts of IgE, but these levels drop as people get older.
   The study found that even though older asthmatics' IgE levels
seem low compared to children's, they are still higher than those of
grownups who are free of asthma. The doctors concluded that because
of the adults' relatively high IgE levels, their asthma was caused
by allergies.
   They noted that routine skin tests that are used to pinpoint the
cause of allergies frequently fail to show anything wrong. Burrows
said this is probably because the tests do not include the specific
substance _ called an allergen _ that is triggering the attacks.
   ``The message is pretty simple,'' said Burrows. ``For many years,
people thought there were two different kinds of asthma, only one of
which was an allergy problem. Even when it's not easy to demonstrate
what the allergen might be, the immunoglobulin in the blood suggests
that virtually all asthma has an allergic basis.''
   The finding, if true, may have little effect on how doctors deal
with asthma, since allergic and non-allergic asthma are usually
treated with the same drugs.

<HEAD>Study Finds Effect of Fish Oil on Inflammation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fish oil's ability to lower the body's production
of two important substances that cause inflammation may explain why
it sometimes seems to relieve arthritis and other diseases,
researchers reported today.
   The researchers studied the effects in the blood when nine
healthy people took 18 fish oil capsules a day for six weeks.
   ``We found a very dramatic reduction in the ability of their
white blood cells to make tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1,''
said Dr. Charles A. Dinarello, who reported his study in the New
England Journal of Medicine.
   ``This is the first time that any dietary manipulation has been
shown to change the production of these inflammatory compounds.''
   Doctors have long noticed that Eskimos and others who eat lots of
oily ocean fish have less heart disease than other people. They also
are less likely to get arthritis, juvenile diabetes and other
diseases that involve overactive inflammatory responses.
   Some studies suggest that fish oil supplements can lower blood
cholesterol, protecting the arteries from damaging buildups.
   Dinarello, a researcher at New England Medical Center in Boston,
said the latest work implies that fish oil also protects the heart
by reducing inflammation in the arteries that may lead to thickening
of the artery walls.
   Ten weeks after they stopped taking fish oil, the volunteers'
production of interleukin-1 had fallen 61 percent and tumor necrosis
factor had dropped 40 percent.
   Dinarello cautioned that the study did not include a comparison
group, and said other kinds of oil supplements could have similar
effects.
   While tumor necrosis factor was first noticed for its ability to
shrink tumors, doctors believe its most important role in the body
is causing inflammation in response to injury.
   Tumor necrosis factor has failed to work as a cancer treatment,
and Dinarello said there is no evidence that reducing its levels in
the body would increase susceptibility to cancer.

<HEAD>A Search for Jurors Capable of Judgment But Ignorant of History</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a Washington courtroom, a judge is looking
for that rarest of creatures _ the person who barely knows anything
about Oliver North.
   The judge selecting jurors to try North is making some progress,
but the question arises: Will the jury that results be a
cross-section of the community, capable of rendering an informed
judgment?
   In the legal sense, it will be a jury of North's peers. The law
only requires that it be a cross-section of citizens from which no
one has been excluded by reason of sex, race or other arbitrary
criteria. It need not be people comparable to North in any other way.
   What Judge Gerhard A. Gesell seeks is a jury ``ignorant'' of
North's activities _ people so removed from world affairs during the
summer of 1987 that they were unaware that North told Congress he
had lied to it, believing his duty to his country required such
deception.
   Such searches are conducted to ensure that jurors do not enter a
case prejudiced either for or against a defendant. But in North's
case, it means the exclusion of an enormous number of potential
jurors who, at one point or another, read or heard something about
him.
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., who served on the Iran-Contra
Committee and is a former state judge, said the exclusion of
knowledgeable people as jurors ``has inherent problems in it and
raises real questions,'' but he doesn't know the answers.
   He said some people simply don't watch television out of choice
or because they are too busy. ``On the other hand, you have the
chance they didn't have any interest and you would think they're
lacking in the necessary intelligence to serve on it,'' he said.
   ``Whether they will differ from normal, average jurors remains to
be seen,'' he said. ``If a man never saw anything of it, what type
of individual is he?''
   Others go further. Bill Moffitt, a well-known criminal defense
lawyer, questions whether a fair verdict can be rendered by people
who knew nothing about the Iran-Contra affair before stepping into
Gesell's courtroom.
   ``I wouldn't want people who lived in Washington, the seat of
government, on that jury who were so uninformed,'' said Moffitt.
   ``Are they going to be interested in what goes on inside the
courtroom if they were so uninterested for so long on what went on
outside it?''
   Moffitt said justice would be better served if six of the jurors
could be drawn from the uninformed and six from those who followed
the Iran-Contra affair, though he concedes that is not practical.
   On the other hand, say some legal experts, the jury system works
well even with jurors who, for whatever reason, arrive innocent of
knowledge of the case.
   ``Jurors are asked to bring a certain common sense into the jury
room and try to determine whether a particular story makes sense and
look witnesses in the eye to tell who is telling the truth,'' said
Philip Lacovara, a former prosecutor in the Watergate trial, another
case drenched in publicity before it reached trial.
   ``It is not necessary for people to be highly educated or current
in world affairs to make that assessment,'' Lacovara said.
   ``It's a burden to find qualified jurors, but I'm not saying it
can't be done,'' added Wayne LaFave, a criminal law expert at the
University of Illinois.
   ``Don't forget that all the pre-trial publicity hasn't been
unfavorable,'' added Neal Sonnett of Miami, president-elect of the
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. ``Don't forget the
movement to pardon North. Not many people facing serious felony
charges are asked to speak in support of the re-election of members
of Congress. So the government has to be as careful about prejudiced
jurors as the defense.''
   The jury's ignorance of North's activities is crucial because he
was compelled to talk to Congress' Iran-Contra committees. In
exchange, he was given limited immunity, a promise that his
testimony would not be used against him in court.
   Prosecutors developed their case independently and charged North
with obstructing presidential and congressional inquiries, lying to
Congress and shredding evidence.
   For all the attention focused on North, Gesell, before the trial
started, expressed confidence that an unknowing jury could be found
to hear the facts and draw its own conclusions.
   He said the same questions were raised in the Watergate case, but
a jury was found, a verdict was rendered and justice was done.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Love is in the air at two zoos where
scientists hope the world's last 28 California condors will mate
themselves away from the brink of extinction, a biologist says.
   Meanwhile, one of seven Andean condors freed into the wilderness
chickened out of a dogfight with two golden eagles half her size.
   ``We've got all sorts of great things happening with the Andeans
and some equally exciting things happening with the captive
California condors. We're very encouraged,'' Joseph Dowhan, U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service condor recovery coordinator, said
Wednesday.
   Only 28 endangered California condors remain, 14 in captivity at
the Los Angeles Zoo and 14 others at the San Diego Wild Animal Park
in Escondido. Scientists hope the vulture-like creatures, which are
North America's largest land birds with 9{-foot wingspans, will
reproduce enough so that some can be returned to the wild in five to
10 years.
   Courtship started in early January among four pairs of the birds
at Escondido and two pairs in Los Angeles, Dowhan said during a
phone interview from his office in Ventura.
   One of the courting pairs in Escondido, male condor AC-4 and
female UN-1, started mating early in January, he added. Last April,
the same pair produced a female chick named Molloko, the first
California condor conceived and hatched in captivity.
   Scientists believe condors lay eggs 30 to 35 days after
fertilization, but mating doesn't necessarily result in
fertilization, Dowhan said.
   The seven Andean condors, donated by zoos across the nation, were
freed into rugged mountains 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles in an
experiment meant to help biologists learn the best way to handle,
release and monitor California condors once they reproduce in
adequate numbers. About 1,000 to 2,000 of the wild Andean birds
remain in South America.
   The most recent release was Jan. 21, when biologists removed
netting from a roost box and feeding platform that housed four
Andean condors in the Sespe Condor Sanctuary.
   On the same day, a hostile encounter occurred between two golden
eagles and one of three other Andeans, which had been freed Dec. 17
from the nearby Hopper Mountain National Wildlife Refuge, Dowhan
said.
   The 10-month-old Andean, condor Y1, flew from Hopper Mountain
onto the eagles' turf, where ``the eagles made several `stoops,' or
aggressive drives, toward the condor and forced it to the ground,''
said a Fish and Wildlife Service news release.
   Dowhan said the condor soon returned to the air and ``made a
beeline to the security of its home (roost box). It was intimidated
by the eagles,'' which have 5-foot wingspans.
   The Andean condors, which will be recaptured and re-released in
South America when the experiment ends next year, will encounter a
number of other birds in California's mountains and ``recognize some
will be territorial and others may serve as pilots to where food is
present,'' he said.
   There hasn't been much flight activity among the four Andeans
released Jan. 21, Dowhan said.
   Condor R4 immediately flew 120 feet into a brushy thicket and
couldn't figure out how to get back to her roost box. Biologists
caught her Tuesday and returned her to the box, where Dowhan said
``she ate right away _ carcasses of stillborn calves.''
   Dowhan said it will be months before the biologists place food
for the carrion-eating condors away from their roost boxes in an
effort to teach them to forage.
   Two of the three Andeans freed from Hopper Mountain in December
flew about three miles on Tuesday and passed over the Sespe roost
box, but the four condors there ``didn't notice them. They were
sleeping,'' Dowhan said.
   Back at the zoos, the six males court the females by arching
their necks, looking at the ground, and trying to encircle the
females with their outstretched wings. Dowhan said each female
``will try to come up under the male and nibble at his beak. That's
a positive reaction.''
   Dowhan said the breeding season runs from January to April.

<HEAD>Origin Of Dolphin-Killing Red Tide Puzzles Experts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists say they are certain that a natural
poison caused the massive die-off of bottlenose dolphins in 1987 and
1988, but they still are puzzled by the persistence of the deadly
``red tide'' that arose in the Gulf of Mexico and moved up the East
Coast.
   ``We have never found this before in history,'' said Joseph
Geraci, a wildlife specialist who headed a team of federal
researchers.
   Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Geraci said laboratory
findings confirm that the dolphins that died had eaten fish
contaminated with a powerful poison, called brevertoxin, originating
from the persistent bloom of red tide algae.
   Gerald Scott, a federal fisheries expert, estimated that 50
percent of the dolphins living off the coast were killed, and said
it could take 100 years for their numbers to recover.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials
said laboratory findings ``are unequivocal'' about the cause of
death, but just why the red tide made its rare and lethal invasion
of the East Coast is not known.
   Fisheries expert Ford Cross said red tides occur naturally, but
are normally confined to the Gulf of Mexico where they arise and
decline swiftly. But the 1987 red tide persisted for months, moved
with the gulf current from the west coast of Florida and then was
driven northward along the East Coast.
   Cross said satellite photographs show that eddies of warm water
lingered for long periods off the coast of North Carolina and
neighboring states and that this may have enabled the algae to
continue blooming. Occasionally, he said, the eddies would be shoved
into coastal bays, bringing toxin-contaminated fish into dolphin
feeding grounds.
   A red tide is considered dangerous for oyster fishing in the gulf
if the count of cells reaches 5,000 per liter of water, Cross said.
During the time the dolphins were dying, he said, some tests along
the North Carolina coast found cell counts of more than 20 million
per liter.
   Bottlenose dolphins are mammals that live in the water. They
breathe air, give birth to live young and nurse their calves. The
animal is highly intelligent and is popular in marine shows because
it is easily trained and is long-lived.
   During the summer of 1987, hundreds of dead and dying dolphins
washed onto beaches on the East Coast, from Florida to New Jersey.
The massive die-off alarmed officials and led to the formation of an
investigative team of more than 100 scientists from several federal
agencies.
   Geraci said it took the team 18 months and thousands of
laboratory tests to confirm that red tide toxin killed the animals.
   The dolphins, said Geraci, either ``died as a direct consequence
of the toxin'' or were poisoned by it ``and lived long enough to
become weakened and susceptible to other organisms,'' such as
bacteria and viruses.
   Scott said the poison seemed to affect younger dolphins, aged 3
to 6 years, more than others. Some nursing calves died from their
mothers' toxin-poisoned milk. Scott said that though only 742
dolphin bodies were found along the beaches, it is likely that
hundreds upon hundreds of others died unseen just offshore.
   ``The population was reduced on the order of 50 percent,'' said
Scott. ``The recovery to the original stock levels could take from
14 to 100 years.''

<TEXT>
   The local U.S. attorney and the Justice
Department appear at odds over how to proceed with a Cornell
University graduate student suspected of creating a virus that
paralyzed 6,000 computers nationwide.
   The difference has to do with whether Robert T. Morris Jr., 23,
should be charged with a felony to deter similar computer attacks,
or whether he should be offered a plea bargain and provide
information under a grant of immunity.
   U.S. Attorney Frederick J. Scullin in Syracuse, N.Y., has
requested Justice Department approval to offer Morris the chance to
plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge and has granted him limited
immunity, a Justice Department source said Wednesday, confirming a
report in The New York Times.
   The limited immunity grant ``caused a lot of consternation down
here,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, unlawful access
to a government computer can result in a maximum penalty of a year
in jail and a $250,000 fine. If fraud is proved, the punishment can
reach a maximum of 20 years in prison.
   ``As far as we're concerned, the legal problem was still
intent,'' the source said. He added that the officials were
uncertain whether Morris had planned to create and spread the virus
last November that infected a government computer network. A
computer virus is a tiny program that spreads throughout computer
networks and disrupts their normal operation.
   Morris, who is on a leave of absence from Cornell and living with
his parents in Arnold, Md., has told friends that he created the
virus but didn't intend for it to invade computers around the nation.
   The virus that began Nov. 2, 1988, infected 6,000 university and
military computers nationwide connected by the ARPANET network,
which is used for transmission of non-classified data among
universities and military contractors. The system was virtually shut
down for several days, but no information was destroyed.
   ARPANET is part of INTERNET, which has another network called
MILNET, used by military facilities.
   The Justice Department official who is considering what charges
should be brought, Mark M. Richard, referred questions to the FBI.
An FBI spokesman declined to discuss the case because it is an
ongoing investigation.
   The Justice Department source said he understood the FBI, which
enforces the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, was extremely upset over
the limited immunity grant to Morris.
   Scullin was out of his office Wednesday afternoon and not
available for comment, his secretary said.
   ``The matter is still pending before the department,'' said
department spokesman John Russell.
   Thomas Guidoboni, the Washington attorney for Morris, said no
plea bargain had been worked out.
   ``They have not told me what they've recommended, and I've not
offered on behalf of my client to plead guilty to anything,'' he
said. ``I have told them we won't plead guilty to a felony. I'm very
emphatic about that.''
   He refused to confirm or deny that Morris had spoken with
prosecutors.
   Phone calls Wednesday to the Morris home in Maryland went
unanswered. Morris' father, Robert T. Morris Sr., chief computer
scientist for the National Computer Security Center near Baltimore,
did not immediately return a phone call to his office.
   Guidoboni said Morris is on a year-long leave of absence from
Cornell, where he was a graduate student in computer science.
   ``He's doing as well as can be expected under the
circumstances,'' he said, noting that Morris has a temporary job but
``would like to get the case resolved.''
   Guidoboni said he didn't know if the temporary job involved work
with computers.

<HEAD>Congressional Agency Pegs 1990 Deficit Higher than Reagan Did</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Congressional Budget Office says former
President Reagan's last budget would produce a deficit far larger
than the law allows and would not produce a surplus by 1993 as the
White House has claimed.
   Using gloomier economic projections than those employed by the
administration, the nonpartisan CBO said Wednesday that Reagan's
spending plan would create a $120 billion shortfall in fiscal 1990,
which begins Oct. 1, and leave $80 billion in red ink by 1993.
   Reagan projected a $92.5 billion imbalance for next year and a $2
billion surplus in 1993, the year the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction
law requires a balanced budget.
   Gramm-Rudman sets a $100 billion deficit limit for 1990. If
Congress and the president fail to whittle the deficit to within $10
billion of that amount, automatic spending cuts occur that reduce
the imbalance to $100 billion.
   President Bush has said he will submit his budget plan a week
from today, and his blueprint _ not Reagan's _ will dominate this
year's budget battles between the White House and Congress.
   But Reagan's proposal _ and CBO's examination of it _ retains
some significance for two reasons.
   First of all, Bush aides have said they are likely to use the
economic forecasts used by Reagan, projections that many private
economists and congressional fiscal experts say are too optimistic.
CBO's report shows just how far apart Bush and his congressional
foes are likely to be when the debate begins over needed savings.
   Secondly, Bush will incorporate large chunks of Reagan's proposal
in his own plan.
   CBO also said that:
   _This year's budget deficit will be $159 billion, about $2
billion lower than the administration projects. CBO had projected
the 1989 deficit at $155 billion just last month, but increased that
figure based on expectations of higher spending for agriculture,
housing and the savings and loan crisis.
   _If none of Reagan's proposals is adopted, next year's deficit
would be $146 billion, $5 billion more than the office projected
last month, and would shrink only slightly to $135 billion by 1993.
The administration has said the deficit, without Reagan's proposed
savings, would be $127 billion next year and $37 billion in 1993.
   _The government would spend $1.19 trillion next year under
Reagan's plan, $38 billion more than the administration estimated.
   _The government will collect $11 billion more in revenues than
the $1.059 trillion estimated by the White House.
   _The cost of bailing out the nation's financially ailing savings
and loan associations will cost $11 billion more next year than the
administration estimated.
   The CBO figures are often used by members of Congress to argue
that the administration deficit forecast is too optimistic and that
more savings are needed. Nonetheless, the Gramm-Rudman law requires
the use of the administration's figures when calculating the
deficit. Congress in recent years has ultimately accepted the
administration's figures, thus making it easier to create savings.
   The administration has forecast that the economy will grow at a
rate of 3.2 percent this calendar year, that inflation will be 3.8
percent and that short-term interest rates will drop to 6.3 percent,
two points below current interest rates.
   CBO used a forecast that included 2.9 percent growth for the
economy, an inflation rate of 4.9 percent and 7.9 percent short-term
interest rates.

   Ballerina Natalia Makarova returned to the

her favorite dances.
   Miss Makarova performed a special pas de deux on Wednesday with
her partner, Alexander Sombart, at the famed Kirov Theater where she
rose to fame in the 1950s and '60s, the Tass news agency reported.
   She selected parts from Tchaikovsky's ballet ``Onegin'' for the
special guest performance with her former troupe.
   Miss Makarova, 48, fled the ballet company during a London tour
in 1970, saying she wanted to broaden her career by performing
modern dances not staged in the Soviet Union.
   Her homecoming marked another lowering of barriers in Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive to open Soviet society.

   Some backers of the 50 percent pay raise for
members of Congress say they need it because Washington is such an
expensive place. Lucky for them the Capitol isn't in Boston. Or San
Francisco. Or Anaheim, Calif.
   All of those places are even more expensive than Washington,
according to various private studies that index the cost of living
in cities around the country.
   Members of Congress currently are paid $89,500 a year, except for
congressional leaders who earn more. If the proposed pay raise goes
through, their pay will jump 50 percent to $135,000.
   Many argue that the costs of keeping up homes back in their
district and in the Capitol strain their budgets. But they also
argue that just living in the District of Columbia or its Virginia
or Maryland suburbs is a strain, too.
   Whether they shouldn't have to make do is another question. But
they do get some private support for their argument that the city is
among the most expensive places in the nation to live.
   The American Chamber of Commerce Reserachers Association, which
produces quarterly cost comparisons for 263 urban areas, puts
Washington at close to the top _ with above standard costs in all
categories including housing, groceries, utilities, transportation,
health care and miscellaneous goods and services.
   The chamber's report for the third quarter of 1988, the most
recent available, established a composite index of 127.2 for
Washington _ based on a scale with 100 the nationwide average. Thus
they rate Washington 27 percent more expensive than average.
   Among the big cities, Boston was rated the highest, at 164.1,
followed by San Francisco at 144.7 and Philadelphia at 127.7. Los
Angeles was just behind at 123.9. Anaheim and Santa Ana, Calif., in
Orange County, were just ahead of Washington at 129.2.
   The biggest item in Washington is housing, which the chamber says
is 68 percent higher than average. In Boston it's 225 percent higher
than average.
   There are private companies that make their own cost calculations
and make recommendations to businesses on salaries when moving
employees or setting pay for different cities. One of them,
Runzheimer International, a management consulting firm based in
Rochester, Wis., made such a comparison for congressional salaries.
   It established a basic mean for expenses in the country and
called it Standard City, U.S.A. If a person there with a family of
four was earning $89,500, and then got elected to Congress and moved
to Washington, Runzheimer figures he or she would need to earn
$101,681 to maintain the same standard of living. That's 14 percent
more.
   If the same family had moved to New York City, Runzheimer figures
it would need $115,296, or 29 percent more. For San Francisco, it
would need $117,625, or 31 percent more.
   ``That's to continue the same lifestyle he would have, to live in
the same size house, drive the same car, have the same expenditure
pattern,'' said Dennis Taylor, director of consulting services for
the company.
   Still another way to compare would be to look at the costs of
homes, the biggest budget item for most families. The National
Association of Realtors' figures for the third quarter of 1988
showed the median price for existing single-family homes in the
Washington area was $135,800, above the national median of $90,200.
   Washington was ninth on the Realtors' list of housing prices,
behind Orange County, Honolulu, San Francisco, New York, Los
Angeles, Boston, Hartford, Conn., and San Diego. It was among the
most rapidly escalating in costs, too, with that median home price
up more than 15 percent in one year.

   When Fran Solomon blows her whistle, bank
presidents stand on chairs, attorneys howl and nurses roar like
lions, blow passionate kisses and shoot the air with their fingers
like gunslingers.
   Solomon, a registered nurse from Berkeley, Calif., is a humor
consultant whose mission is to rid the world of boredom and help
employees lighten up and enjoy their work.
   ``Inside the crankiest, grumpiest, grouchiest person you know is
a child who's dying to get out and enjoy himself,'' Solomon said
Wednesday at a seminar for nurses at a nursing home in this
Pittsburgh suburb.
   ``We're not proposing people tell jokes at work or create a
circus,'' she said. ``But we are proposing that people have an
opportunity to express all that they are _ from tears to laughters,
the whole spectrum of feeling.''
   Solomon spreads her gospel of humor in lectures, conferences and
workshops, and has looked for the funny bone in such unlikely places
as the Army and AT&amp;T.
   Acting more like a stand-up comic than a consultant Wednesday,
Solomon prodded her audience of 100 nurses and other health-care
professionals into acting silly. She encouraged them to seek support
by asking for a standing ovation or express boredom by making a sign
that looked a lot like someone picking their nose.
   Solomon said she knows many people may feel ``this overwhelming
urge to bolt for the door'' when she requests particularly unusual
behavior, so she doesn't require a response. Few people, however,
just sat back and watched.
   ``I set up ground rules for people where they only do what feels
safe to them,'' she said.
   As she bounced from one routine to the next, trading one goofy
mask for another, Solomon cited research that indicates humor can
help in the healing process while stress can delay recovery.
   ``The prediction is that by the year 2,000, 80 percent of
workmen's compensation claims will be stress related,'' she said.
   ``We need to find a new way of doing business in this country
that supports people being whole, healthy, happy, satisfied, so that
they come to work and find they really have an opportunity to
express themselves, to impact the world, to make a difference. And
humor is a part of that.''
   Research supports the theory that laughter is important for good
health. Laughter releases endorphins, which are natural painkillers
and help the body deal with stress.
   Recent studies show that people who can laugh it up under
pressure seem to have greater resistance to stress-related ailments,
and that humor therapy helps relieve painful muscle-bone disorders
and depression.
   A good hearty laugh provides a mini-workout by exercising the
diaphragm, thorax, abdomen, heart and lungs.
   Solomon suggested nurses try a little humor on the job. Taking
vital signs while wearing a clown nose or writing with a pen shaped
like an eggplant can bring a smile to most people's faces, she said.
   ``Patients love it. Walk into a patient's room and tell a joke
and everyone in all the beds will be paying attention, even the
person who is hearing impaired,'' she said with a laugh. ``Everyone
wants to get into the act.''
   ``I'm not ready to walk into a patient's room with a clown nose,
but I think she reminded us that we need to lighten up,'' said
Connie McCormick, a nurse from suburban Dormont.

<HEAD>Price Rises Offset Some Drought Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last summer's devastating heat and drought
shriveled crop production, but in some cases market prices rose
enough to offset much of the financial loss, according to
Agriculture Department analysts.
   In the case of 1988 corn production, for example, the harvest
dropped 30 percent to 4.92 billion bushels. The average yield was
cut to 84.6 bushels per acre from the record of 119.4 bushels in
1987.
   But the corn crop nationally was worth more than $13 billion,
down only about 7 percent from its value in 1987 of slightly less
than $14 billion.
   It's a big-stakes numbers game, of course, with losers and
winners. A farmer who was wiped out entirely had no corn to sell at
the higher prices. But many did have something to sell, and that's
what USDA's national figures are about _ averages, and how those
stack up from one year to the next.
   The department's National Agricultural Statistics Service
reported on Tuesday that the $13 billion corn harvest of 1988 was
valued at $2.60 per bushel, compared with $1.94 for the 1987 crop.
   Analysts cautioned that the prices used in the report are based
on preliminary averages during the marketing year and don't take
into account USDA price supports and other benefits.
   Moreover, the ``value'' of a crop is basically determined by
multiplying production by price. It is not the same as cash sales by
farmers. For example, if a farmer had a 100,000-bushel corn crop and
fed part or all of it to livestock, the corn would still have a
production value _ whether used or sold.
   Overall, the report showed that major crops in 1988 had a
production value of $70.2 billion, up from $68.5 billion in 1987. A
dozen carried a production value last year of $1 billion or more,
accounting for more than 80 percent of the total.
   Rounded off, those included: corn, $13 billion; soybeans, $11.9
billion; hay, $10.6 billion; wheat, $6.63 billion; cotton, $4.1
billion; tobacco, $2.2 billion; potatoes, $1.92 billion; oranges,
$1.69 billion; grapes, $1.37 billion; sorghum, $1.36 billion;
apples, $1.22 billion; and rice, $1.04 billion.
   Other examples of 1988 production values included: oats, $562.3
million, down from $606 million in 1987; barley, $790,295, down from
$982.3 million; and dry edible beans, $571 million, up from $426.4
million.
   Some drought states declined in crop production value much more
than others last year. Iowa, for example, was reported at $4.81
billion for 1988, down only 2 percent from $4.89 billion in 1987.
North Dakota, severely hit by drought, was shown at $1.2 billion,
down from $1.93 billion in 1987, a 37 percent drop.
   Nebraska showed an increase in crop production value to nearly
$3.7 billion from less than $2.9 billion in 1987.
   By states, here are the comparisons of total crop production
values, in thousands of dollars. Alaska was not listed. The first
column is for 1987 and the second column is for 1988.

   Wright floated the idea of a follow-up vote on Wednesday, as

   If you didn't know that today is National No
Talk Day, you're not alone. The third-grade teacher who founded the
holiday doesn't talk much about it.
   Marilyn Bachelor came up with the idea for the annual bit of
peace and quiet 13 years ago.
   ``It was a dull time and I wanted to do something to bring my
students to life, to give them a challenge,'' she recalled. So she
told her class at Garner Elementary School to write notes and play
charades for one entire day, except during recess.
   Celebrated on the first Thursday in February, the holiday is
likely to be overshadowed this year by a better-known holiday,
Groundhog Day.
   But No Talk Day probably would be unheard of outside Bachelor's
classroom were it not for Chase's Annual Events, a reference book
that keeps track of thousands of holidays, including oddball events
such as No Talk Day.
   One of Bachelor's students about four years ago was a grandson of
William and Helen Chase, the book's founders, who agreed to add
National No Talk Day to the likes of National Blame Someone Else Day
and National Goof Off Day.

   When Tim Haggerty's principles are at

   The Pompano Beach man has spent ``way, way past five figures,''
exhausted his life savings and taken out a $10,000 loan in an
eight-year legal fight over his mailbox.
   Not just any mailbox. Haggerty's is 22-feet tall and made of junk
metal.
   The city ordered it removed from the end of his driveway as a
traffic and safety hazard, and the 4th District Court of Appeals in
West Palm Beach upheld the city's position.
   Haggerty now has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``I'm fighting for principles and my principles aren't for

   He contends the city shouldn't have the power to regulate his
choice of a tall mailbox just as it should not interfere with his
decision to have a motorcycle or dog.

   Nobody noticed that flags were
disappearing from Hackensack until police spotted two college
fraternity brothers at the top of a flagpole.
   ``We didn't know flags were being stolen,'' police Capt. Emil
Canestrino said Wednesday as he announced the recovery of 10 stolen
flags.
   The detectives' big break came Saturday, when two Zeta Beta Tau
fraternity members were found up a pole. With them were flags from
the Bergen County Vocational-Technical School and Bogota High School.
   ``After they were arrested, we said we would like to get some
flags back, that it might be to everyone's benefit,'' Canestrino
said. That led several fraternity brothers to return a batch of
stolen flags, including three from Hackensack's Court Plaza and _ by
accident _ three of the fraternity's own flags.
   That left the investigators with just one more task: matching
flags to their poles.
   Four of the flags haven't been claimed, so police sent out
notices to likely owners to see if they are missing a flag.

<TEXT>
   A proposed joint operating agreement between
Detroit's two major newspapers raises issues so significant they
deserve another hearing on appeal, says a motion filed by a
coalition of readers and advertisers to delay the deal.
   The motion filed Wednesday by the Michigan Citizens for an
Independent Press says the 100-year agreement between The Detroit
News and Detroit Free Press would cost 500 jobs, cause higher
subscription and newsstand prices and probably lead to higher
advertising rates.
   For their part, the two newspapers would suffer ``comparatively
little harm'' should the agreement to combine business and
production operations be put off past the scheduled Monday
completion of the agreement, opponents said in their motion.
   Under the agreement, the papers would maintain separate news and
editorial departments.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit on Friday rejected opponents' argument that the
partial merger should be forbidden.
   The court said the attorney general had the power to interpret
the Newspaper Preservation Act, the law under which the newspapers
applied for an exemption from federal anti-trust laws.
   The opponents argued that the appeals panel gave the attorney
general undue power.
   Knight-Ridder Inc., owner of the Free Press, said through a
spokesman that the delay is costing about $50,000 a day. Gannett Co.
Inc., owner of the News, declined comment from its Arlington, Va.,
headquarters.

   The anticipated appointment of Bernard Aronson
as the chief U.S. diplomat for Central American affairs shows the
desire of the Bush administration to forge a bipartisan policy in
that region, U.S. officials say.
   Bernard Aronson, a Democrat and one-time aide to former Vice
President Walter Mondale, is best known for helping President Reagan
build congressional support for military aid for the Contras in the
summer of 1986. It was the last time such aid won approval on
Capitol Hill.
   Although early signs are that Bush will not seek a renewal of
Contra aid and instead will seek a diplomatic solution in Central
America, Aronson is viewed on Capitol Hill as a moderate who could
appeal to members of both parties.
   The anticipated appointment of Aronson comes at a time when both
the United States and Nicaragua's leftist government are showing
signs of interest in a more accommodating relationship, possibly
including the first direct U.S. discussions with the Sandinistas in
four years.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III had considered a long list
of alternate candidates for the post before settling on Aronson to
become assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs,
widely regarded as one of the most demanding jobs in government.
   The selection of Aronson indicates that Bush and Baker are intent
on avoiding the kind of friction with Congress that accompanied the
Reagan administration's support of the Contra rebels.
   Baker has indicated that he believes the Reagan administration's
inability to come up with a Central America policy acceptable to
Congress was a major contributing factor to U.S. inability to
achieve its objectives in that region.
   He has been engaged in consultations with the Congress and has
elicited favorable comments from House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex.,
who helped engineer the defeat of the Contra aid request a year ago.
   Former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams has called
that vote perhaps his biggest disappointment in 3{ years as Reagan's
top aide for Latin America.
   He maintains that the Sandinista government responded to the vote
by increasing repression, accelerating aid to leftist rebels in El
Salvador and continuing to accept disproportionately high levels of
military aid from the Soviet Union. He lists the 1988 Kremlin aid
figure at $500 million.
   One long-time Contra aid opponent, Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich.,
said he is cautiously optimistic he will be able to work well with
Aronson.
   Aronson from 1977 to 1981 was a vice presidential speechwriter
and deputy assistant to President Carter, and currently is on a
Council on Foreign Relations study group on Central America. The
officials who confirmed his appointment spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Reagan's departure appears to have had a dramatic impact on
Sandinista attitudes, including its policy towards Washington.
   The Sandinistas announced on Inauguration Day that the State
Department will be allowed to send envoys to replace eight U.S.
diplomats who were expelled from Managua last July.
   President Daniel Ortega said last week he wants to ``normalize
all aspects of U.S.-Nicaraguan relations,'' and he also has
announced cutbacks in military spending, a sore point for the Reagan
administration for years. Contra fighters, many of whom are
languishing at camps inside Honduras, will be welcomed home without
conditions, he said.
   On Tuesday, the Sandinistas extended a unilateral cease-fire with
the Contras and lifted suspensions on two radio programs that had
been in effect since last fall and drawn critical State Department
comment.
   Bush, meanwhile, has said little about Nicaragua since he began
his election campaign last year, leaving the impression that he does
not subscribe to Reagan's view that the Sandinista government, left
unchecked, will eventually represent a major security threat to the
United States.

   Leading Southern Democrats are lining up to
help Ronald H. Brown counter complaints about his liberal ties and
smooth his transition to the chairmanship of the Democratic Party.
   Govs. Ray Mabus of Mississippi and Bill Clinton of Arkansas
planned to greet Brown as he opened a two-day swing through the
region where his links to Edward M. Kennedy and Jesse Jackson
produced the most objections from conservative Democrats.
   An Associated Press survey of elected and party officials around
the country found strong support for Brown, coupled with advice that
he quickly establish his independence and demonstrate a commitment
to keep the party in the political mainstream.
   Brown's four rivals for the party chairmanship have dropped out
of the race, leaving him a sure winner when the Democratic National
Committee elects a successor to Paul G. Kirk Jr. on Feb. 10.
   ``He's a terrific guy and will do a great job,'' said Gov. James
Blanchard of Michigan. But Blanchard also suggested that the task
ahead for Brown will not be easy.
   ``I just think the party is in more difficult shape than it has
admitted nationally,'' he said. ``I think the general drift of the
Democratic Party since the mid '60s has been downward nationwide. I
think that large numbers of people are feeling that in the national
scheme of things, we're not speaking to them.''
   While Democrats control the House and Senate and hold a majority
of the nation's governorships, they have lost five of the last six
presidential elections. Southern states have voted solidly
Republican in recent presidential contests.
   ``If we want to win we have to bring the so-called Reagan
Democrats home,'' said John Henry Anderson, the Georgia Democratic
Party chairman. He called Brown ``Jackson's man'' but said the
incoming party chairman will demonstrate his independence if he
works hard to find a presidential candidate who appeals to moderate
and conservative Democrats.
   ``He was not my choice,'' said Anderson, ``but I look forward to
working with him.''
   Louisiana Sen. John Breaux urged Brown to appoint a task force to
address the concerns of party moderates.
   ``I think we should give him a chance to address the concerns of
those who are out there,'' said Breaux, who is chairman of the
Senate Democratic Campaign committee. ``If he doesn't, thenhe'll be
open to criticism.''
   Brown was Jackson's convention manager last summer and received
credit for helping bring the session to a harmonious close. He was
general counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee when Kennedy was
chairman and then served as deputy manager of the Massachusetts
senator's 1980 presidential campaign.
   Brown's ties to Jackson and Kennedy triggered suggestions he
would make it more difficult for Democrats to shake an image that
the party was too liberal.
   ``His ideology as far as I'm concerned is insignificant,'' said
Mark Schreiber, executive director of the Pennsylvania Democratic
Party. ``His task is simply to get in there and get the party
organized. His role is to build an organization that can win
elections.''
   ``I don't know Ron Brown,'' said R. Clayton Mitchell, speaker of
the Maryland House of Delegates. ``But people I've talked to are
concerned it might hurt us.'' Mitchell said there is a conservative
trend in the country and ``a lot of people are concerned we're
moving away from the national trend.''
   In New York, talk of Brown's liberalism wasn't an issue.
   ``That question might be better asked of whites in Texas,'' said
Lee Miringoff, director of the nonpartisan Marist College Institute
of Public Opinion.
   Bob Slagle, Texas Democratic Party chairman, said the identity of
the national chairman ``has damned little to do with the state
party.''
   Paul Wellstone, who was a leader of the Jackson campaign in
Minnesota, said the fact Brown is black ``is an issue for many
people in the country. ... Race is a huge factor in American
politics, more than most of us want to admit to. The sooner the
Democratic Party confronts it the better off we are.''
   ``It's a very positive step for us to pick a black chairman,''
said John Marino, executive director of the New York Democratic
Party. ``That's because we don't look at Ron Brown as simply being
black. We look upon him as someone who can unite all Democrats and
put it together.''

<HEAD>Board Rules Cocaine Use Contributed to 1988 Colorado Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board says
cocaine use by the pilot of a Colorado commuter flight contributed
to a crash that killed nine people.
   The five-member board reached the conclusion after a year's
investigation into the Jan. 19, 1988, crash of a Trans-Colorado
flight into Durango, Colo., in which the pilot, co-pilot and seven
passengers died. Eight passengers survived.
   The decision came even though investigators said the cocaine
found in pilot Stephen Silver's blood and urine was insufficient to
make him ``high'' during the flight and co-pilot Ralph D. Hardy was
controlling the Fairchild Metro 3 aircraft before it crashed into a
hill five miles short of the Durango runway.
   ``Contributing to the accident was the degradation of the
captain's performance resulting from his use of cocaine before the
accident,'' the board said. It blamed both ``the first officer's
flying and the captain's ineffective monitoring of an unstabilized
approach which resulted in a descent below the published descent
profile.''
   The board said the plane began its descent at too high an
altitude and speed to land safely.
   Investigators found no problem with the aircraft or air traffic
control instructions that might have contributed to the crash but
raised some questions about the landing approach path the pilot
chose to use.
   The board asked the FAA to examine procedures that approved the
steep ``slam-dunk'' approach used by the now-defunct airline, called
for more FAA assistance in screening of pilots and urged greater
dissemination of information about detecting drug use among airline
personnel.
   The board opposes random drug testing of all airplane crew
members as called for in a program set up by the Federal Aviation
Administration, saying it prefers testing before employment, after
accidents and when warranted by a ``wide range of safety related
errors.''
   Investigators said Silver, 36, lied about previous drunken
driving convictions to obtain a medical certification to fly and
noted that co-pilot Hardy's record of training with Trans-Colorado
and previous employment indicated ``deficiences in performing
instrument procedures.''
   The plane leased by Continental Express, a subsidiary of
Continental Airlines, crashed at night in light snow.
   The board staff also noted that Hardy, 42, had a history of
alcoholism although no evidence of alcohol was found in either crew
member's body. Family members and friends said earlier that Hardy
had overcome his alcoholism.
   The board, in its conclusions and recommendations, did not
address drug testing, but member Jim Burnett noted board
disagreement with the FAA program.
   The program requires drug testing of all airplane crew members
during first medical evaluations and random testing thereafter.
   Medical analysis after the Colorado crash found traces of cocaine
in the pilot's blood and urine, investigators said. They also said a
girlfriend of the pilot reportedly claimed he had taken cocaine the
night before the crash, although she refused to talk to
investigators.
   Board investigator Barry Strauch said evidence showed that Silver
had used cocaine between 10 and 18 hours before the flight. He said
there was not enough evidence to determine whether Silver was a
heavy user of the drug.
   Board staff member Merritt Birky, a chemical expert, said that
regular use of cocaine could cause fatigue and a preoccupation with
cocaine, affecting performance of a pilot long after any ``high.''
   Two negligence lawsuits have been filed against Continental
Airlines as a result of the crash. Both cites Silver's cocaine use.
One also alleges that the airline failed to check records of both
Silver and Harvey.

   The U.S. dollar weakened against the Japanese yen
Thursday, while stock prices rebounded moderately on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar opened at 130.15 yen, and traded in a wide range
between 129.67 yen and 130.23 yen before closing at 129.75 yen, down
0.65 yen from Wednesday's close of 130.40 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which lost 220.62 points on Wednesday, climbed
137.62 points, or 0.44 percent, on Thursday and closed at 31,498.30.
   Exchange dealers said the dollar was still bearish but players
were cautious about trading ahead of the Washington meeting of the
Group of Seven major industrialized countries scheduled for Friday.
   The meeting, to be attended by finance ministers and central bank
heads from the United States, Japan, Britain, France, West Germany,
Italy and Canada, will likely focus on the recent fluctuation in
currency rates.
   Dealers said many market players were also sidelined because of
the upcoming Friday release of U.S. employment figures for January.
   They added that securities players on the stock market were also
inactive because of the meeting and the U.S. employment rates
announcement.
   ``The most bullish shares today (Thursday) were ones which lost
substantial points yesterday,'' said a dealer at a major Japanese
brokerage, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Players seem to be
trying carefully to determine the direction of the February market.''

<HEAD>EPA Wants to Ban Use of Alar on Apples</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Growers who welcomed Alar 20 years ago because
it made apples firmer, better looking and less likely to spoil will
have to come up with a substitute because of concern the chemical
causes cancer.
   The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday it plans to
order a ban on the chemical, formally known as daminozide, but that
the regulatory process is likely to take 18 months or more. The
agency is meanwhile urging growers to voluntarily stop using the
chemical.
   According to current EPA and industry estimates, only about 5
percent of the more than 200 million bushels of apples grown each
year are sprayed with the chemical. Four years ago it was found on
about 35 percent of the apple crop.
   John Moore, acting EPA administrator, said the health risks of
continued Alar use have been calculated to produce an estimated five
additional deaths from cancer over a lifetime for every 100,000
people exposed.
   The risk for children is likely greater because they consume more
apples and apple products such as juice or sauce, he said.
   ``There is an inescapable and direct correlation between exposure
... and the development of life-threatening tumors in test mice,''
he continued, citing preliminary results of a series of tests still
under way.
   The first indication from laboratory tests on animals that there
might be a link to cancer came in l977. The EPA said in the early
l980s that it planned to review whether Alar should be taken off the
market, finally directing a ban three years ago, only to back off
after its test data were brought into question.
   In recent years many apple processors, who provide apples for
juices and sauces as well as baby food, have refused to buy
Alar-treated apples. So have some grocery chains because of the
health concern, said Derl Derr, president of the International Apple
Institute.
   Alar, which is absorbed into the apple, began being used
extensively by apple growers in the early l970s to spur even growth,
reduce spoilage and help preserve apples so they can be sold all
year.
   Uniroyal Chemical Co., of Middlebury, Conn., the only producer of
Alar, disputes that a health risk has been proven. ``All the studies
that have been done since 1985 have supported our position that Alar
poses no significant health risk,'' said Uniroyal spokesman Yanis
Bibelnieks. He said it was ``inappropriate to make any judgment
based on interim results'' cited by the EPA and the company has no
plans to take the produce off the market.
   The company produces 75 percent less Alar today than it did in
l985 because fewer growers now use it, he said.
   A lawyer for the National Research Defense Council, which has
filed a lawsuit to stop Alar's use, criticized the EPA for not
taking emergency action to ban the product immediately.
   ``EPA has a sufficient amount of data to take this chemical off
the market today,'' said Janet Hathaway, an attorney for the
Washington-based group. ``It's a very hazardous cancer-causing
chemical. ... Any further debate should occur in the courts after
the product is off the market.''
   In Washington state, where a third of the country's apples are
grown, industry representatives said many growers likely will stop
for fear of future legal liabilies and a possible public backlash.
   ``We know it's a greast tool for us to use, but by the same token
if it's going to hurt our image we don't need it,'' said Charles St.
John, a spokesman for the Washington Apple Commission.

<HEAD>Iran Marks Decade Of Revolution With 10 Days Of Celebrations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iran celebrated the 10th anniversary of
its Islamic revolution by marking the minute Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini arrived home from exile.
   Millions of the 88-year-old leader's supporters cheered, rang
bells, exploded fireworks at the appointed hour Wednesday, Tehran
Radio said. There were sports tournaments, cultural festivals and
street reenactments of revolutionary events.
   The celebrations will climax Feb. 11, the anniversary of the day
the last government formed by the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
collapsed and the revolutionaries took over to proclaim the Islamic
republic.
   Khomeini, living at that time in Paris, returned to triumph in
Tehran.
   But the festivities that began at 9:03 a.m. Wednesday to mark the
minute Khomeini touched Iranian soil a decade earlier come at a
deeply troubling time.
   Infighting between pragmatists in the Tehran hierarchy and
radicals has led to a wave of political executions and a bitter
power struggle that is expected to flare when Khomeini dies.
   The nation also is struggling to recover from a devastating
eight-year war with Iraq, which ended after a humiliating military
collapse by Iran that forced it to accept a cease-fire on Aug. 20.
   Iran's failure to defeat Iraq led some pragmatists to abandon the
goal of exporting the Islamic revolution to the Moslem world through
militant action.
   It also led the moderates to call for less religious, political
and social restrictions and for normalization of relations with the
West.
   Still, the revolution has survived the internal upheaval, the
hostility of much of the world and the punishing war with Iraq,
which left hundreds of thousands of Iranians killed or mutilated.
   ``This year we celebrate a decade of resistance and struggle
against the enemies of humanity,'' Culture Minister Mohammad Khatami
said earlier this week. ``We celebrate the 10th year of a revolution
which has been strengthened by thousands of martyrs and thousands of
disabled.''
   Tehran's streets, spruced up by teams of workers, were decked out
in Iranian flags, revolutionary posters and portraits of Khomeini.
   Tehran Radio did not say what Khomeini was doing to mark the day
of his triumphant return two weeks after the shah left Tehran to go
into exile, his regime crumbling from within, his army unable to
quell the revolution.
   The celebrations came as dissident factions claimed that
Parliament Hashemi Rafsanjani, whose pragmatic faction holds the
upper hand in the political struggle, has been executing hundreds of
opponents, including supporters of Ayatollah Husseil-Ali Montazeri,
Khomeini's designated successor and Rafsanjani's rival.
   The anniversary also comes as Rafsanjani attempts to normalize
Iran's relations with the West and the Soviet bloc.
   He said Wednesday that Tehran is ready to restore relations with
Saudi Arabia, which broke ties 10 months ago after accusing Iran of
subversion and terrorism.

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Says Leave Tax Overhaul Alone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The proposal by President Bush to cut the
capital-gains tax could cause the 1986 tax overhaul to unravel, a
key architect of that legislation says.
   ``I want to retain the '86 act because this is the first year the
full force and effect of that legislation will take place,'' Rep.
Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,
said Wednesday.
   If the capital-gains tax is reduced, he suggested, there is a
real possibility that Congress would couple it with an increase in
the top individual tax rates.
   ``That bothers me,'' the Illinois Democrat said, when a
questioner at a meeting of the National Association of
Wholesaler-Distributors asked about Bush's proposal. The president
says he will ask Congress to reduce the 33 percent top tax rate on
capital gains to 15 percent.
   ``That scares me,'' Rostenkowski said. To applause from the
audience, he said his talks with business leaders make clear that
the best thing to do with the tax law now is leave it alone.
   Rostenkowski was one of the chief authors of the 1986 tax
overhaul, which reduced tax rates significantly and cut or
eliminated several deductions, exclusions and credits. Among those
changes was wiping out the preferential rate for capital gains,
which are profits from the sale of stocks, real estate and other
property.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Salvador Laurel said
Thursday he was leaving for Hawaii for a meeting requested by
deposed President Ferdinand Marcos, who was in critical condition in
a Honolulu hospital.
   Marcos was ``very, very weak'' and placed on a respirator
Wednesday after emergency surgery at St. Francis Medical Center,
said hospital spokeswoman Norma Kop.
   But President Corazon Aquino gave no indication she was prepared
to lift the ban against Marcos returning from exile in Hawaii and
said the former president's condition ``is neither critical nor
serious.''
   Laurel said in a statement that he had informed Mrs. Aquino and
Executive Secretary Catalino Macaraig of his trip and would
immediately relay to her Marcos' message.
   Since Marcos could not communicate directly with Mrs. Aquino,
``he is asking me to help communicate with the Filipino people,''
Laurel said.
   Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno said Laurel was acting on
his own and not as an emissary of Mrs. Aquino.
   Laurel said Marcos' wife, Imelda, telephoned him from Honolulu
requesting the urgent meeting because doctors had advised Marcos
``that he hasn't much time left to live.''
   Mrs. Marcos, 59, fainted while accompanying her husband to the
emergency tracheotomy, and fell and hit her head, nursing supervisor
Cindy Miller said. She was listed in satisfactory condition in the
same hospital.
   Laurel's statement followed rumors in Manila and in Honolulu that
he and Filipino industrialist Enrique Zobel were trying to work out
a deal under which Marcos could be allowed to return.
   ``If what Marcos wants to convey to (Mrs. Aquino) and the nation
will heal the wounds that have been fragmenting our people and
finally lead to national reconciliation, then something good can
come out of this trip,'' Laurel said.
   A spokesman said the vice president, whose relations with Mrs.
Aquino have been strained since he quit her Cabinet in 1987, was to
depart later Thursday.
   Marcos has been living in exile since a February 1986
civilian-military uprising ended his 20-year rule and swept Mrs.
Aquino to power. Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos to return
for reasons of national security.
   The 71-year-old former president was admitted to the hospital on
Jan. 15 for treatment of pneumonia and bronchial asthma. In
December, he was hospitalized twice for treatment of congestive
heart failure.
   In October, Marcos and his wife were indicted by a federal grand
jury in New York on racketeering charges for allegedly embezzling
$103 million from the Philippine government to purchase real estate
in New York.
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent before a federal judge later that
month, but Marcos' arraignment has been postponed because of his
health.
   Mrs. Aquino's government accuses the Marcoses of robbing the
country of up to $10 billion during their rule and demands the
return of the ``ill-gotten'' wealth as a condition for allowing
Marcos' return.

   The Arctic air mass that created havoc in Alaska
before moving to the lower 48 froze fountains in usually mild
Vancouver as Edmonton residents tried to dig out from under a foot
of snow.
   Officials attributed at least 13 deaths to the cold and driving
winds that have paralyzed much of Western Canada since Monday.
   Cold and blowing snow was blamed for eight deaths in Alberta,
three in Saskatchewan and two in British Columbia. Among the dead
were six Edmonton men who suffered heart attacks after shoveling or
pushing vehicles.
   The snow that fell Monday and Tuesday in the Edmonton area was
the heaviest January storm recorded there since Jan. 31, 1885.
   Most roads and highways in Alberta were open on Wednesday,
although about 20,000 residents in British Columbia's Fraser Valley
were without power due to high winds that blew trees and branches
onto the lines.
   In Victoria, the fountain in front of the British Columbia
legislature was frozen solid as the mercury dipped to 10 degrees on
the West Coast.
   Temperatures remained around minus 22 on Wednesday throughout
Saskatchewan and Alberta, where the wind-chill factor made it cold
enough to freeze exposed flesh in less than a minute.
   ``What has happened the last couple days is quite spectacular,''
said Andy Radomski of the federal Atmospheric Environment Service.
   He said the air had a chance to cool longer than usual in the
north because it was trapped by westerly circulation that kept most
of Canada warm much of the winter. The upper level winds then
shifted and forced the cold air south at last.
   ``It has affected all of Western Canada and in fact is going to
the states and will affect them as well,'' Radomski said in a
telephone interview.
   Radomski said the weather pattern generally was heading south and
southeast from Western Canada and was expected to hit hardest the
Plains, the Lower Great Lakes and New England.
   The cold air that lingered over Alaska for a week broke
temperature records and resulted in at least one death.
   On Monday, it was 51 below zero in Fairbanks, Alaska, and the
National Weather Service said there were unofficial reports of
temperatures of minus 75 in the state.

<HEAD>General Motors To Shut Down Assembly Plant, Lay Off 2,000</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRAMINGHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. will shut its
Framingham auto assembly plant in August for an indefinite period
and lay off about 2,000 workers because it has not decided what cars
or trucks to make at the facility.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis planned to go to the plant today to
assure employees he will work to ``reduce the uncertainty associated
with layoffs.''
   GM officials announced Wednesday that they would be stopping
production at the plant, which makes the Buick Century and
Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera, about 300 cars a day.
   ``There is no product allocated to the Framingham facility after
we build out the 89 model,'' said Ed Dilworth, a spokesman for the
automaker.
   A government official, speaking on condition on anonymity, told
The Associated Press that Dukakis may request federal aid for the
workers and hoped to set up meetings with GM to discuss long-term
plans for the plant.
   Dukakis has had some success with GM before. When he returned to
office in 1983, the plant was closed. But after negotiations between
the state, the UAW and GM officials, the plant reopened later that
year.
   It closed again in November 1987 and reopened last May. It
currently has 2,100 active employees.
   J. Russell McCarthy, plant manager, said a transition program
will be developed for plant employees to provide them with benefits
information and counseling.
   Dee Allen, a plant spokesman, said between 100 and 200 employees
will remain on the payroll in Framingham after August to handle
security, staff the fire brigade and administer employee benefit and
placement programs. Framingham is about 30 miles west of Boston.
   ``We'll be working with people to find them jobs both within GM
and even outside of General Motors,'' he said.
   Allen also stressed that the company wanted to make the
distinction between closing a plant and idling it.
   ``The difference is that we're going to leave the facility in a
condition that it can be run'' if a new product is allocated to
Framingham, he said.
   Walter Tremblay, a trustee of the local United Auto Workers, said
most employees took the news calmly.
   ``If you've been with the auto industry any amount of time you
believe something like this when it happens,'' he said. ``I know
what they told us, (but) what could actually happen come July or
August could be subject to change between now and then.''
   ``The newer people naturally are more concerned, which they have
a right to be. You tend to worry a little more,'' Tremblay said.
``Most of your seniority people have been through this before, so
they've more or less adjusted their lives around it.''

<HEAD>Dollar Off Against The Yen, Stocks Up Moderately</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar declined today against the Japanese
yen in Tokyo as the market waited for an international monetary
meeting, and stock prices rebounded moderately.
   The dollar opened at 130.15 yen, and ranged between 129.67 yen
and 130.23 yen before closing at 129.75 yen, down 0.65 yen from
Wednesday's close of 130.40 yen.
   Since last Thursday, the dollar had gained nearly three yen
before today's decline. Exchange dealers said the dollar was
expected to remain strong, but the market was cautious about trading
ahead of a meeting scheduled in Washington on Friday among the
finance ministers and central bankers of seven major industrial
countries.
   Exchange rates are expected to be one topic for the officials
from the United States, Canada, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy
and Japan.
   ``Most of the dollar's movements today should be attributed to
investors' efforts to reduce their exposure ahead of the release of
U.S. unemployment rates,'' said an exchange dealer at Sumitomo Bank.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues climbed 137.62 points, or 0.44 percent, closing at
31,498.30, following a 220.62-point loss the previous day.
   Dealers said many investors stayed on the sidelines to await
Friday's release of U.S. employment figures for January and results
of the finance ministers' meeting.
   ``The most bullish shares today were ones that lost substantial
points yesterday,'' said a dealer at a major Japanese brokerage,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Players seem to be trying
carefully to determine the direction of the February market.''
   Starting this month, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which previously
closed on the second and third Saturdays of every month, will close
on all Saturdays.

<HEAD>Koreas Agree To Develop Resort, Shipyard, Rail Plant In North Korea</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In a joint venture unprecedented for
the divided Korean peninsula, the south's Hyundai conglomerate has
signed agreements to develop a tourist resort, shipyard and railroad
plant in the communist north.
   The agreement between the sometimes bitter rivals, reported by
North Korea's media on Wednesday, is considered a business deal with
political connotations because it is still technically at war with
South Korea.
   The countries have no official ties.
   South Korean tycoon Chung Ju-yung, Hyundai's honorary chairman,
confirmed today after returning from a 10-day trip to North Korea
that he had agreed in principle with the north to undertake the
projects along its east coast.
   He was the first South Korean business leader known to have
visited the north with the approval of both governments since Korea
was split in 1945. The Koreas went to war in the early 1950s and
have long remained at odds.
   Under the agreement signed in the north's capital, Pyongyang,
Hyundai and the North Korean government will jointly develop a
resort around scenic Mount Kumgang to attract South Koreans and
foreigners, Chung said.
   The Mount Kumgang area, known for its beauty, is about 20 miles
from the demilitarized zone that divides the Koreas.
   Chung told a brief airport news conference that the two sides
also agreed to jointly develop resources in Siberia and to jointly
operate a railroad rolling stock plant and a shipyard, both at
Wonsan in the north. He had already discussed the Siberian projects
with Soviet officials in Moscow.
   The agreement, in the form of a protocol, was signed by Chung and
Choe Su Gil, director of North Korea's Taesong Bank and consultant
to the Korean Association of the Promotion of Asian Trade. Because
both are state agencies, the Pyongyang government's approval of the
projects was seen as guaranteed.
   While Chung said the projects are subject to approval form both
governments, one Seoul official said the south would approve the
undertakings as a sort of pilot project to stimulate inter-Korean
cooperation.
   Seoul has been seeking direct trade and other exchanges to ease
tension between the two Koreas with an eventual goal of
reunification. Both Koreas recently have made contacts to arrange
high-level government and parliamentary talks to pave the way for
peace.
   Some observers said the communist north, known for its
reclusiveness, now appears ready for deals with the capitalist south
to overcome its economic backwardness. Some see this venture as a
way for North Korea to attract scarce foreign currency.
   Chung said he and a 20-member survey team would visit North Korea
in mid-April to discuss financing and other details for the resort
project.
   He said he would be allowed to enter the north through the
demilitarized zone _ a route previously permitted only for a few
exchanges of official delegations for north-south talks in the 1970s
and early 1980s.
   On his just completed trip, Chung traveled via Beijing after
North Korean officials refused to allow direct travel across the
north-south border.
   For visits to the new resort, he said, North Korea is ready to
allow South Koreans to cross the border near Mount Kumgang if they
possess proper travel documents. It was not known how soon such
visits could start.
   The planned projects in Wonsan would make rolling stock and ships
mainly for export to the Soviet Union, as well as repair ships,
Chung said.
   Wonsan is the North Korean port where the U.S. spy ship Pueblo
and its crew were taken after their capture by the north in early
1968.
   Sources said Chung's visit to the north followed years of private
contacts with the north abroad.

   The judge hearing Oliver North's Iran-Contra
trial is questioning the motives of a television account of initial
trial proceedings and says he may hold the reporter responsible in
contempt of court.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said Wednesday that an
account by ABC News correspondent Tim O'Brien ``appears to be a
deliberate effort to obstruct'' jury selection in the trial.
   O'Brien's report, aired Tuesday night, included testimony in
which North admitted lying to Congress at 1987 hearings. North gave
the previously nationally televised testimony under a grant of
limited immunity but it covers the same subjects on which North now
faces 12 felony charges.
   Gesell said he had ``not made up my mind'' but was considering
whether O'Brien's account of Tuesday's proceeding provided an
``appropriate basis for a contempt action.''
   Jury selection for the trial has been hampered by concerns about
the finding jurors unfamiliar with North's previous testimony about
the Iran-Contra affair.
   North's admissions to Congress cannot be used against him as
evidence, and Gesell has ruled that no one who heard the former
National Security Council aide's congressional testimony could sit
on the jury.
   The judge excused three prospective jurors Wednesday because they
had seen North's congressional testimony.
   Gesell said O'Brien ``took pains'' to tell viewers that if they
had watched the excerpts of the testimony included in the report
they would not have to serve on the jury.
   Roone Arledge, president of ABC News, said in a statement
distributed in New York: ``Correspondent Tim O'Brien reported fairly
and accurately what has been said in public regarding the North
case. The public's right to be informed need not conflict with the
fair administration of justice. Last night's `World News Tonight'
segment informed our viewers about events already having taken place
in public arenas. They cannot now be erased.''

<HEAD>Space Shuttle Flight Is Delayed To Replace Turbopumps</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS lead to CORRECT that cracks were in one turbopump, sted

<TEXT>
   The launch of the space shuttle
Discovery has been delayed and may be scrubbed because of cracks
found in a high-speed turbopump of the spacecraft's counterpart,
Atlantis.
   NASA engineers said Wednesday that the delay of the Discovery
flight until at least mid-March could force a postponement in a
scheduled April launch of Atlantis. But the Atlantis flight has
priority and could force the cancellation of the Discovery launch,
space agency officials said.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration made the
announcement after shuttle managers reviewed an engineering analysis
of cracks discovered in one of Atlantis' high-speed turbopumps after
a December flight. Failure of the pumps could cause an explosion
that could kill the crew.
   Officials said Discovery will be moved to the launch pad early
Friday and three suspect pumps are to be replaced in conjunction
with other launch preparations.
   Because of the uncertainty of the availability of new pumps and
the length of time to make the replacements, NASA said it would not
set a firm launch date until a flight readiness review in late
February.
   The agency had been aiming for a Feb. 23 liftoff for Discovery,
but a series of technical delays not related to the pumps already
had delayed that date several days.
   If the date slips past March 18, the planned April 28 launch of
Atlantis will have to be delayed, officials said.
   Officials have said the Atlantis mission in April has priority
because Atlantis will be carrying the Venus-Magellan probe, and will
have only a 25-day ``window'' to launch it.
   Discovery is to carry a communications satellite. NASA officials
had said previously that its flight would be put off until later in
the year if it couldn't get off the ground by about March 15.
   NASA said it could delay the Atlantis flight a few days, although
it would prefer not to do so. Officials would like to preserve the
entire launch window in case of problems.
   Only one shuttle launch pad is currently available. A second is
being refurbished.
   Questions were raised about the three turbopumps when engineers
found two tiny cracks in a bearing unit in one of Atlantis' pumps
after it completed the second post-Challenger mission in December.
   They believe the cracks were caused by stress corrosion resulting
from moisture trapped inside the bearing housing during the
manufacturing process. But they are not certain how the moisture
penetrated the metal.
   A search of records disclosed that two of Discovery's pump
bearings had gone through the same manufacturing process as the
cracked one, so shuttle managers decided at Wednesday's meeting to
remove all three pumps and replace them with new, carefully
inspected units.
   The turbopumps, which convert liquid oxygen into gas in the
shuttle's three main engines, operate in flight at extremely high
speeds, pressures and temperatures and a failure of one of them
could set off a fatal engine explosion. The cracks on Atlantis were
too small to cause trouble, but if such cracks widened and split the
bearing unit, it could be dangerous, NASA said.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses To Release Businessman In Nerve Gas Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals judge overturned a lower
court decision and barred the release of a businessman who
authorities said tried to export nerve gas and possessed classified
documents.
   U.S. Circuit Judge Morton I. Greenberg on Wednesday ordered
Juhwan Yun held until a three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals reviewed the the $2 million bail set by a federal
judge in Newark. The review may take place as early as next week, a
prosecutor said.
   Yun, 48, of Short Hills, is jailed in New York for allegedly
conspiring to export nerve gas, possibly to Iran.
   On Tuesday, Judge H. Lee Sarokin ordered Yun's release by
Wednesday afternoon, ruling that a condition of virtual house arrest
would be adequate to prevent him from fleeing. Sarokin stayed his
ruling long enough for Greenberg to consider the matter.
   ``It's perfectly apparent to me it would be irresponsible not to
grant a stay'' of Yun's release, Greenberg said.
   Greenberg agreed with prosecutors who argued that Yun's release
would be risky in light of the charges against him and the discovery
in his office of documents on U.S. intelligence gathering
capabilities.
   Moreover, Assistant U.S. Attorney Edna Axelrod said Yun's
international travels indicate he could easily flee. She said Yun's
wife and three children have spent most of 1988 in Korea, and that
Yun planned to travel to Beijing, Iran, Europe and his native South
Korea.
   The prosecutor also cited evidence of links between Yun and
``high-level military and civilian'' officials in foreign countries.
Because of the sensitive nature of the case, she said, several
governments would prefer that Yun not go on trial.
   ``He has contacts all over the world where he could find
assistance,'' Ms. Axelrod said.
   Defense attorney Jeremy Littman contended the difficulty of
communicating with his client in jail would hamper his ability to
prepare for trial, tentatively set for May 1.
   He said the strict release conditions set by Sarokin _ including
travel limited to his home, office and church _ were adequate. He
also objected to the prosecutors' use of the newly discovered
documents as more justification for keeping Yun in jail when that
discovery has led to no charges.
   Though charges against Yun deal only with illegal weapons export,
new evidence has begun surfacing suggesting Yun's involvement in
exporting sensitive information as well.
   In a letter Tuesday to Sarokin, Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne
Singer said Yun had classified documents revealing the United
States' capability to intercept enemy communications.
   The government believes the documents could divulge information
on U.S. electronic warfare capabilities and knowledge of ``enemy
threat,'' a Joint Electronic Warfare Center official said in a
memorandum to the U.S. Customs Service.
   A British national, Charles Caplan, also is charged in the case.
The two are accused of plotting to buy the nerve gas sarin and other
military equipment for export. Authorities have said the nerve gas
was possibly headed to Iran.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Suspend Attacks on U.S. Targets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas say the
favorable U.S. response to their proposal to take part in elections
has moved them to suspend attacks on U.S. institutions and personnel.
   Wednesday's announcement reverses a rebel stand that held U.S.
personnel or property as legitimate targets because Washington has
given President Jose Napoleon Duarte's government about a million
dollars a day economic and military aid.
   The insurgents last week offered to take part in presidential
elections if the vote were postponed from March 19 to September and
their security concerns were met. It was a major turnabout for the
rebels, who had condemned all previous elections this decade as
shams.
   The government has reacted negatively to the proposal, which it
terms unconstitutional. Even so, Duarte has said he is reserving
final judgment.
   The State Department said the proposal ``was worthy of serious
and substantive consideration'' and several U.S. lawmakers have said
it could be an important development in the search for an end to the
9-year-old civil war.
   On Oct. 27, guerrillas fired a rocket-propelled grenade at the
U.S. Agency for International Development building in San Salvador.
The house of a high-ranking U.S. diplomat was also the object of a
grenade attack on Nov. 25.
   No one was injured in either attack.
   The insurgents issued a communique in Mexico City on Wednesday
announcing an immediate suspension of attacks on U.S. targets. A
guerrilla spokesman called San Salvador radio stations, which
broadcast the communique locally.
   The statement says the suspension was motivated by ``the positive
reception that our proposal has had in diverse sectors of North
American society.'' It also cited ``hope of a change in U.S.
policy'' with the Bush administration.
   The communique says U.S. military advisers based at Salvadoran
military installations are not covered by the suspension.
   In another development, the mayor of El Salvador's fifth largest
city announced that he was resigning because of guerrilla threats.
   Manuel Eliseo Perdomo of Usulatan joined about 80 other mayors
who have resigned since mid-December, when the guerrillas began a
campaign of threats against them. The country has 262 mayoral posts.
   Rebels killed nine mayors between March and November before
adopting a policy of warnings. They consider the mayors instruments
of the counterinsurgency plan of Duarte's Christian Democratic
government, the army and the United States.
   However, in the election proposal, the rebels offered to respect
the mayors ``if they sever their links with the army's plans.''
   The guerrillas' Radio Venceremos on Wednesday said rebels killed
or wounded 851 soldiers in January. It did not break down the figure.
   The armed forces press office said troops killed 120 guerrillas
and wounded 115 during the month.
   Neither side gave its own casualties. Figures from both sides
often appear to be inflated.

   The luck ran out this week at K.I. Sawyer Air
Force Base, whose personnel had miraculously survived two aviation
accidents in the past four months.
   ``It's a fairly sad place right now,'' Marquette University
psychologist Travis Martin said Wednesday as the people at Sawyer
grieved for 17 colleagues and relatives killed when a KC-135A air
tanker crashed in Texas. The two other people aboard also were
killed.
   Flags around the base, 10 miles from the Lake Superior shoreline
in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, stood at half-staff, shivering in a
bitter wind.
   ``That's eerie, to see that flag,'' said one airman. ``It's even
worse to see the families (of victims) coming in.''
   A military refueling plane from Sawyer crashed and exploded in a
mesquite field Tuesday as it tried to take off from Dyess Air Force
Base near Abilene, Texas, on a training flight to Hawaii.
   Military officials said Wednesday that an investigation into the
crash could take weeks, perhaps months, in part because the KC-135A
Stratotanker wasn't equipped with a flight data recorder or a
cockpit voice recorder.
   In addition to the seven-member crew, the aircraft carried at
least three active-duty personnel and seven military retirees and
their relatives. The identities of two victims were not released.
   For $10, military retirees and dependents of active-duty
personnel are allowed to fly aboard training flights to destinations
outside the 48 continental states on a ``space-available'' basis,
the Air Force said. Military personnel can fly free.
   When the plane left Michigan, it carried a crew of seven, plus 10
passengers.
   At Abilene, two more passengers boarded, including James A.
Phillips, 58, of Abilene, a retired technical sergeant who was
taking advantage of the military's ``space-available'' flight option
for the first time since he retired in 1973, his wife said Wednesday.
   Norma Phillips said her husband, a 23-year veteran of the Air
Force, was going to Guam to visit his son, who is in the Navy and
who married recently.
   ``He had time on his hands and decided he would take advantage of
this flight,'' she said.
   At Sawyer, 350 miles northwest of Detroit, members of the
close-knit base community reacted with silence and sadness
Wednesday. Routine operations were carried on, but participation in
a national prayer breakfast today was canceled.
   ``Our family is going through the process of mourning. We're
caring for our people,'' the base wing commander, Col. Eldon Joersz,
said in a terse meeting with reporters. He walked out without
answering questions.
   Memorial services at the base chapel are planned for Friday.
Joersz said the base community would remain closed to the news media
until after the service. About 1,900 families live at Sawyer.
   The somber mood at the base contrasted with an atmosphere of
relief at Sawyer following the Dec. 6 explosion of a B-52 bomber
going through touch-and-go landings on the base's main runway. All
eight crew members survived in what base personnel called a miracle.
   Just three months earlier, 10 Sawyer personnel had leaped out of
an exploding KC-135 in a crash that killed six people at a sister
Michigan base.
   ``When you narrowly escape disaster, you feel like there was
divine intervention, but underneath the dandruff is the notion, `is
it going to be there the next time?''' said Dr. Robert Moore, a
Marquette psychologist.
   With this third crash, Sawyer personnel must cope with the
feelings they had ignored, he said.
   ``Now the ultimate has happened. This will stimulate all sorts of
reaction,'' Moore said.

<TEXT>
   A statement purportedly from the
leftist group that raided an Argentine army base last month claimed
troops killed guerrillas who had surrendered and promised to fight
on ``until victory.''
   ``What the soldiers did was take advantage of their superiority
of arms to tread on our companions with tanks after they had fallen,
to incinerate them with phosphorus after they had fallen, to shoot
them after arresting them,'' said a half-page statement signed by
the Popular Resistance Front and published Wednesday in the
Uruguayan newspaper La Republica.
   ``From now on, they (soldiers) are going to pay,'' it stated.
``We swear to continue the fight until victory.''
   The newspaper said it was convinced the communique was authentic.
It did not say how or where the statement was obtained.
   A long declaration signed by the front was found among the
guerrillas who were killed or captured at the 3rd Infantry Regiment
at La Tablada on the outskirts of Buenos Aires during a 27-hour
battle Jan. 23-24.
   Twenty-eight guerrillas and 10 soldiers and police were killed,
and 63 troops were injured. Fourteen commandos were captured.
   Spokesmen for Argentina's ministries of defense and interior
declined to comment on the statement and said there probably would
not be an official response.
   The communique repeated parts of the declaration that said the
group acted to prevent an imminent right-wing coup and crackdown on
leftist activists. No evidence was offered to back the claims.
   It said 46 front members with grenade launchers and
ground-to-ground missiles staged the raid. The statement said more
attacks are planned.
   The front, recently formed and little known, is thought to be
small, but Argentine officials do not discount the possibility of
another armed attack by it or a related group.
   ``The motivation of our companions ... is the increasing misery
of the people,'' the statement said. ``In a country with 50 million
head of livestock, every day children die of hunger. ... Retired
people don't earn enough to eat.
   ``A future of peace for our country will only be possible if
measures are taken that assure a life of dignity for the people,
justice realized and criminals punished.''
   The Argentine government said the front is composed of leftist
subversives from the Everyone for the Country Movement and former
members of the disbanded People's Revolutionary Army, which openly
fought in the 1970s against Argentina's then-military government.
   However, members of the Everyone for the Country Movement
denounced the incident and deny involvement, saying members such as
lawyer Jorge Banos who participated did so on their own.
   The communique did not mention the man Argentine officials say
organized and possibly led the assault, former People's
Revolutionary Army leader Enrique Gorriaran Merlo, for whom an
arrest warrant was issued last week.
   President Raul Alfonsin of Argentina formed a National Security
Council to assess the risk of leftist subversion and canceled a
planned trip to attend today's inauguration of President Carlos
Andres Perez of Venezuela.
   Attorney General Andre D'Alessio said last week that further
assaults cannot be discounted. Security precautions for the 14
guerrillas under arrest are tight.

   Gunshots, rocks and bottles rained down on
more than 100 police officers as they put down a riot triggered by
the arrest of a black drug suspect who later died in custody,
authorities said.
   Wednesday night's three-hour disturbance was the third riot in
the predominantly black College Hill section in two years and the
second in Florida in two weeks.
   A 22-square-block area of the neighborhood was cordoned off after
the violence began as undercover officers struggled to arrest the
6-foot-3, 300-pound suspected cocaine buyer.
   ``The man fought us and punched one of our detectives three times
in the nose,'' said Lt. Jesse James.
   At least four officers received minor injuries, including the
detective involved in the arrest, who suffered a broken nose, police
said.
   No other injuries were reported. Police did not say if any
arrests were made, and no damage estimates were available.
   A crowd, estimated at 150 at its peak, began to toss rocks and
bottles at the officers. Before the violence was quelled, a grocery
store was looted and set ablaze and a television news van was
damaged by two shotgun blasts, police said.
   The drug suspect, whose name was not released, collapsed in a
police cruiser and died at St. Joseph's Hospital.
   Neither hospital nor police officials would discuss the nature of
his injuries, but police spokesman Steve Cole said no shots were
fired. The suspect was carrying a derringer, a small pistol, in his
back pocket, said Cole.
   Gene Bexley, owner of Bexley's Bar-B-Q in the neighborhood, said
youths looted a grocery store before it was set on fire.
   ``Once they broke it, it took 10 to 15 minutes and they cleared
it out,'' he said. ``Some went in, then things come flying out
windows and doors.''
   The fire also forced choir members at nearby Deliverance
Tabernacle Church to toss an organ and other valuables into a truck
as a precaution.
   A youth with a shotgun fired on a WFLA-TV van, said cameraman
Rugene Moore.
   ``I knew he was empty after the second shot,'' said Moore, who
was not injured. ``I almost went back to get him. That's what made
me mad. I guess the little guy was having a ball.''
   Mayor Sandy Freedman showed up at the northeast Tampa
neighborhood wearing a formal gown.
   ``People who are out there and causing this are hoodlums,'' said
the mayor, who had been attending an awards dinner.
   The unrest apparently spilled over to a west Tampa housing
project, where youths attacked firefighters called to extinguish
fires in two trash bins.
   In October 1987, rock- and bottle-throwing broke out in College
Hill after a black teen-age girl was hit by a vehicle that ran off
the road and the driver fled. Eight people were hurt and 11 arrested.
   Violence also flared in February 1987 after a 23-year-old black
man died while in police custody. A white police officer who had
used a neck hold to subdue him eventually was cleared of wrongdoing
and the neck hold was banned.
   Last month, blacks in Miami rioted for several days after a
police officer fatally shot a black motorcyclist who was being
sought for speeding.

<HEAD>Marine Convicted In Lance Corporal's Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Marine sergeant who was demoted to
lance corporal asked forgiveness for his role in the death of a
young Marine abandoned in the Mohave desert.
   ``I'd like to apologize to the Marine Corps, my regiment, my
battalion, my officers and subordinates but most of all to the
family of Lance Cpl. (Jason) Rother and hope in time they can
forgive me,'' Christopher Clyde said in a statement prior to
sentencing on Wednesday.
   Clyde, 28, was Rother's platoon sergeant when the 19-year-old
Marine was left behind after being posted as a road guide for a
nighttime exercise at Twentynine Palms, Calif., last Aug. 30.
   Rother, of Minneapolis, was not reported missing for almost two
days. His remains were found Dec. 4.
   Maj. Kent Smith, the military judge, ruled that Clyde was
negligent by failing to follow policies, failing to report the
status of his Marines and to properly account for the whereabouts
and the welfare of his Marines. Clyde was found innocent of willful
disobedience of an order.
   Smith demoted Clyde to lance corporal, but ordered no other
penalty. He could have ordered a reduction in rank to private,
forfeiture of two-thirds of his pay for three months and confinement
for three months.
   A court-martial was set to begin today for Rother's squad leader,
Sgt. Thomas B. Turnell, 25, of Elrama, Pa. He is charged with
dereliction of duty, willful disobedience of a lawful order and
unauthorized absence.
   Also facing charges in the case is 1st Lt. Allen V. Lawson, who
is scheduled for court-martial on Feb. 7. He was in charge of
assigning road guides during the exercise.

<HEAD>Three Members of Teamsters Board Resign, Endorse Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Teamsters executives settled civil
racketeering charges by agreeing to endorse reforms sought by the
government to curb alleged mob influence on the nation's largest
union, officials said.
   The three also resigned as international vice presidents and
members of the union's executive board but said the resignations
were not in exchange for dismissal of the case.
   The settlement, however, does not affect the 14 remaining
defendants in the lawsuit to oust reputed Mafia-dominated members of
the Teamsters' executive board, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy
Mastro.
   ``The case goes to trial at the end of February,'' Mastro said.
   In exchange for the union reform endorsement, Mastro agreed to
drop Robert Holmes of Detroit, John Cleveland of Washington, D.C.,
and Maurice Schurr of Philadelphia as defendants in the lawsuit,
filed last June under the civil provisions of the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act.
   The suit claimed mobsters dominated the union's executive board
and thus deprived the rank and file of their rights through a
``campaign of fear, bribes, extortion and theft.''
   Mastro declined comment on whether the three would testify at the
trial, although he noted the agreements for Holmes and Cleveland
stated there were no plans to call them as witnesses.
   In addition, the agreement called for the government to drop all
claims against the pension and benefits they might receive from the
union.
   Mastro also declined to confirm or deny whether settlement talks
were under way with the union.
   Telephone calls for comment to the office of Duke Zoeller, a
Teamsters spokesman in Washington, were not returned Wednesday night.
   Published reports indicated that Teamsters leaders had rejected a
government proposal to settle the lawsuit, brought by then-U.S.
Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, in exchange for the resignation of 16
international vice presidents named as defendants.
   As part of the agreement, signed by U.S. District Judge David
Edelstein, who will preside over the nonjury trial, the three former
board members will permanently resign all of their union posts and
``endorse the objective of preventing La Cosa Nostra corruption of
any elements of'' the union.
   The settlement endorsed also called on Edelstein to appoint an
individual or committee not affiliated with the union to oversee
Teamsters elections and guard against corruption.
   None of the three officials admitted any wrongdoing in signing
the agreement. They did endorse changes in the union's constitution
for the direct election of top executives by the 1.6 million members
and other reforms.
   Holmes' attorney, David DuMouchel, said the government's action
was a ``complete vindication for Holmes,'' who announced his
resignation Sunday, after more than 50 years with the union.
   ``Bobby was not asked to resign and never offered to resign as
part of any settlement discussion in this case,'' DuMouchel said.
   Schurr announced in October he was resigning effective the
following month. That announcement came as then-new Teamsters
President William J. McCarthy tried to oust Schurr, who had opposed
McCarthy in the election, as did Cleveland and Holmes.

<TEXT>
   Two helicopters crashed during training
flights at the Ford Ord Army base, killing one soldier and injuring
three others, the Army said.
   Investigators were trying to determine today if the two choppers,
each with two soldiers on board, collided before they went down 150
yards apart Wednesday night, said Capt. Guy Shields, an Army
spokesman.
   The soldiers' names were being witheld pending notification of
relatives.
   One injured solider was in stable condition at Silas B. Hayes
Army Community Hospital at the base, about 100 miles south of San
Francisco. The extent of his injuries was not immediately known,
Shields said. The other two were treated and released for minor
injuries.
   The two downed aircraft were an AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter and
an OH-58 Kiowa observation helicopter. Both were unarmed and
assigned to Fort Ord's 123rd Combat Aviation Brigade, Shields said.
   The Cobra broke apart and was lying in a clearing surrounded by
trees in a remote training area, its main rotor lying on the ground,
Shields said. The Kiowa was in a ravine several hundred yards away
and couldn't immediately be seen in the darkness.
   Investigators did not know if the weather had anything to do with
the crash. It had been raining off and on throughout the day, but it
was unknown if it was raining when the incident occurred, Shields
said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration was notified of the crash.

   A 3-year-old boy was shot and seriously wounded

   Greg Alvarez shouted, ``Mommy, Mommy,'' just before a bullet

   He was taken to Brookdale Hospital, where he was listed in

   The shooting in the Cypress Housing Project occurred Wednesday
afternoon when many residents were outdoors enjoying unseasonably
warm weather, said a police spokesman, Sgt. John Clifford.
   Police said it was unclear exactly what caused the gunfight but
it appeared that two groups of youths got into an argument.
   Eric Casseus, an 18-year-old Brooklyn man who suffered a minor
gunshot wound, was arrested by police and accused of picking up the
child and holding him against his chest as he fled gunmen, said
another spokesman, Officer Edward Feeney. He was charged with
first-degree assault and unlawful imprisonment, Feeney said.

<HEAD>Karpov With Commanding Lead As Hjartarson Resigns Third Game</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iceland's Johann Hjartarson resigned to the Soviet
Union's Anatoly Karpov after the 32nd move of the third game of the
World Chess Championship quarterfinals, giving Karpov a nearly
unbeatable lead in the six-game match.
   With the victory, Karpov leads with 2.5 points to 0.5 for
Hjartarson.
   A loss by Hjartarson in the next game would bring the match to an
end, said chessmaster John Donaldson of Seattle. He said that for
Hjartarson to keep the match alive, he would have to score 1.5
points in the next two games. A win is worth one point, and a draw
gives both players a half point.
   As in the first game, Hjartarson, who played white, used a Ruy
Lopez opening but then chose a more energetic game plan than in that
game. Karpov defended with the Flohr-Zaitsev variation.
   The turning point in the match appeared to be the 24th move, when
Hjartarson was unable to fend off Karpov's advances.
   The game was played despite a snowstorm in Seattle that stopped
traffic and closed many schools, including Lakeside School where the
tournament is being held.
   The Soviet and Icelandic delegations successfully argued against
postponement of the game.

<HEAD>Cold and Wet Across Western Two-Thirds of Nation</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A blast of arctic air kept things cold and wet today throughout
the western two-thirds of the nation, where schools and highways
were closed after hundreds of traffic accidents on rain- and
snow-slickened roads.
   Snow fell from the Pacific Northwest to the Rockies, the northern
Plains and the upper Mississippi Valley.
   Subzero temperatures and winds up to 40 mph produced wind chills
in Montana and the Dakotas as low as 90 below zero. Missoula, Mont.,
had one of the coldest wind chill readings: 78 degrees below zero.
   The strong winds caused blowing snow over the Dakotas and much of
Minnesota, reducing visibilities to less than a mile. Winter storm
warnings were in effect.
   Snow spread across portions of central Wisconsin, and advisories
were posted for portions of Michigan. Freezing drizzle fell from
Missouri to Indiana.
   Further west, a band of heavy snow developed Wednesday night over
the northern mountains of Utah, where a winter storm warning
remained in effect. Heavy snow also fell in Wyoming and Idaho.
   Salt Lake City received 8.3 inches of snow Wednesday, breaking
the record snowfall for the date of 4.1 inches in 1969.
   Winter weather advisories were in effect for much of Wyoming
through today, and a snow and blowing snow advisory was posted for
the northern and central mountains of Colorado. A blizzard warning
was posted for the Idaho Panhandle.
   California also had wintry weather, with snow and blowing snow
over the Sierra Nevada and winds gusting to 71 mph.
   In six hours overnight, 5 inches of snow fell at Winnemucca,
Nev.; 4 inches at Casper, Wyo., and 2 inches at Salem, Ore.
   Much of the Southeast remained mild this morning with readings in
the 50s and 60s.
   Today's forecast called for snow from the Pacific Coast to the
upper Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes; rain over the Ohio
Valley; and showers and thunderstorms from the southeast third of
Texas to the lower Mississippi Valley.
   High temperatures were expected to be 20 to 30 below zero in
Montana, 20 below zero to zero from Minnesota to the Dakotas, much
of Nebraska, the rest of the northern Rockies, the Idaho Panhandle
and western Washington; the single digits and teens along the
northern coast of Washington and in Wyoming, the central Rockies,
Kansas, southeast Nebraska, northern Wisconsin, upper Michigan and
northern Maine; the 20s and 30s in the rest of the Pacific Coast and
Wyoming, the southern Rockies, Oklahoma, the central Mississippi
Valley, the Great Lakes and the rest of New England; the 40s and 50s
in the southern half of the Pacific Coast, northern Texas, Arkansas,
western Kentucky, Pennsylvania and southern New York; in the 80s
along the lower Texas coast and in the Mississippi Delta and
Florida; and in the 60s and 70s in the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 30
degrees below zero at Havre, Mont., to 73 degrees at McAllen, Texas.

   Oliver North, who faces trial on a dozen felony

advertising campaign.
   A full-page ad in The Independent newspaper today showed North,
dressed in the uniform of the U.S. Marine colonel he once was,
raising his right hand to take the oath before the Iran-Contra
committee.
   ``With a few notable exceptions,'' said the ad placed by Girobank

   North had testified before Congress about transferring large sums
of money as part of an operation to sell arms to Iran to raise money

government.
   He faces 12 criminal charges, including lying to Congress and the

   Black &amp; Decker confirmed that its recall
last month of two types of automatic coffeemakers was prompted by a
few small fires and the company said thousands of the products
haven't been returned.
   The company said overheating, creating a fire hazard, can occur

Coffeemakers.
   ``We are aware of a few instances in which the units have caught
fire _ and want to get all the coffemakers back,'' Dennis Heiner,
president of Black &amp; Decker's U.S. Household Products Group, said in
statement released Tuesday.
   Pam Ross, a spokeswoman for the company, said Wednesday that no
one was injured in the fires, which were confined to the
coffeemakers and the immediate areas.
   Heiner said customers can call Black &amp; Decker's customer service
office at 1-800-833-3396 or go to Black &amp; Decker service stores for
help.
   Customers who return the defective coffeemakers will get free
substitutes and their choice of refunds or certificates for new,
redesigned Spacemaker Plus Thermal Carafe Coffeemakers when they are
available in April, the company said.

   It's official _ it'll be the Sam and Diane show.
   ABC News scored a major coup Wednesday by signing CBS ``60
Minutes'' correspondent Diane Sawyer to be co-anchor with Sam
Donaldson on a new prime-time ABC News program scheduled to go on
the air later this year.
   ``I think it's a great thing for us, and I think it's going to be
a wonderful thing for her,'' said ABC News President Roone Arledge.
   ABC also recently hired Chris Wallace away from NBC to be chief
correspondent on the as-yet-untitled program that sounds something
like a prime-time version of ``Nightline,'' but with more time
outside the studio.
   Donaldson said he was ``delighted'' by the signing of Sawyer.
   ``From the very first time that I discussed this program with
Roone Arledge months ago, we all understood if Diane would come to
work at ABC it would be a tremendous asset,'' said Donaldson. ``I
always wanted Diane.''
   Sawyer said she was ``grateful for every moment at CBS, but ABC
is also a formidable news organization and this is a great creative
adventure.''
   Arledge said he had approached Sawyer a few years ago when her
contract was up at CBS, where she has been since 1978, but did not
have an appropriate job to offer her. She turned down an offer from
NBC and stayed with CBS, where she is reported to make $1.2 million
a year.
   Arledge said it wasn't a raise that convinced her to come over to
ABC. ``If you know her lifestyle and interests, she's obviously well
paid and money is not a primary issue,'' he said.
   CBS continued discussions with Sawyer until Wednesday morning.
The deal with ABC was announced in the afternoon. Sawyer's contract
at CBS was not yet up, but it included a ``window'' that allowed her
to leave if CBS could not offer her an anchor position.
   ``Diane Sawyer was an important contributor to CBS News for more
than a decade. We thank Diane for her fine work and tireless efforts
with us and wish her the very best in the future,'' CBS News
President David Burke said in a statement released by the network.
   Sawyer joined CBS in 1978. In 1981, she became co-host, with
Charles Kuralt, of the ``CBS Morning News.'' She joined ``60
Minutes'' in 1984.

<HEAD>20 Members Of Communist Party's Central Committee Resign Or Ousted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A meeting called by the Communist
Party's Central Committee to stress unity ended after three days
with the resignation or ouster of 20 senior officials, including a
former party president.
   Those who resigned late Wednesday from the 165-member
policy-making Central Committee included Vidoje Zarkovic,
Yugoslavia's party chief from 1985-1986, and three of the largely
formal state presidency's nine members: Lasar Mojsov, Stane Dolanc
and Sinan Hasani.
   The ouster of Zarkovic, a Montenegrin, had been demanded since
street demonstrations in Montenegro last month that led to the
replacement of that republic's entire ruling elite.
   Ousted from the Central Committee after a secret vote were Azem
Vlasi, former Communist Party chief of Kosovo, and Svetislav
Dolasevic, the ethnically troubled province's senior Communist
official.
   Critics held the two responsible for not preventing intercommunal
strife in Kosovo, where the ethnic Albanian majority is allegedly
persecuting minority Slavs and forcing them to leave the province.
   The three-day session ended without compromise on any of the
political or economic issues convulsing this country.
   Earlier Wednesday, Stipe Suvar, who survived attempts by
Communists from Serbia to oust him as national party leader, issued
a plea for unity.
   Suvar in his closing speech said unity was needed ``to enable the
communist party to stop losing battle after battle.''
   He added that Yugoslavia's ``political stability is jeopardized.''
   The country of 23 million people is a loose federation of six
republics and two autonomous provinces that is plagued by ethnic
rivalries and economic mismanagement.
   Suvar's appeal came as officials announced the rate of inflation
for January in this nonaligned Balkan nation was 14 percent, bad
news for a country ravaged by a record 250 percent inflation rate in
1988.
   Over the three days, more than 85 speakers delivered impassioned
speeches but offered no solutions to Yugoslavia's deep economic and
political crisis.
   In a related development, the party announced it would hold its
15th congress by Dec. 31, a year ahead of schedule.

<HEAD>Books On Physics And Spies Lead Times' Top-Sellers List For 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The best-selling hardcover book in the nation
last year was ``Cardinal of the Kremlin,'' a spy novel by Tom
Clancy, a newspaper survey shows.
   The book, about the race by a member of the CIA to rescue an
American mole in the Soviet Union, was published in July and has
1,277,611 copies in print, The New York Times said in today's
editions.
   Leading the nonfiction hardcover list was ``A Brief History of
Time,'' by Stephen W. Hawking, in which the author reviews efforts
to create a unified theory of quantum mechanics and general
relativity. Published in April, it has 825,000 copies in print.
   Scott Turow's big-city murder tale, ``Presumed Innocent,'' was
1988's best-selling paperback novel, the Times said.
   The top-selling nonfiction paperback was ``Love, Medicine &amp;
Miracles'' by Bernie S. Siegel, about the importance of the
patient's mind and emotions in the treatment of serious illness.
   The leader in the hardcover advice and miscellaneous category was
``The 8-Week Cholesterol Cure'' by Robert E. Kowalski _ which has
been on the Times' best-seller list for 82 weeks.
   Bill Watterson, creator of the Calvin and Hobbes cartoon
characters, dominated the paperback advice and miscellaneous
category, with three of his books occupying the top five slots. The
leader was his ``Something Under the Bed Is Drooling.''
   The survey was based on computer-processed sales figures from
3,000 bookstores and from representative wholesalers with more than
28,000 other retail outlets, including variety stores and
supermarkets. The figures are statistically adjusted to represent
sales in all such outlets across the United States. Although several
of the books were published before last year, the sales figures used
were for 1988 only.

<HEAD>Governor Calls For Clemency Hearing For Farmworker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BIRK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez has ordered
prosecutors in Miami to investigate new claims that a farmworker was
framed in the 1967 poisoning deaths of his seven children.
   ``Justice ought to prevail, whatever it may be,'' Martinez said
Wednesday as he ordered Dade County Attorney Janet Reno to continue
a 3-month-old probe begun by the governor's legal office.
   Martinez also called for a clemency hearing for the farmworker,
James Richardson, 53, who is serving a life sentence at the Tomoka
Correctional Institution near Daytona Beach. Such a hearing requires
approval from three of six independently elected Cabinet members.
   ``There were seven deaths. We can't forget that,'' Martinez said
at a news conference. ``Seven little ones died and someone was found
guilty. If there was a wrongdoing at that time, we would like to
know about it.''
   Martinez said he was handing the investigation of the case over
to Ms. Reno because the probe by his office revealed conflicting
information about the killings and because she has subpoena power.
   The governor's office and the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement have been investigating the matter since October. In
December, Richardson's lawyers petitioned the Florida Supreme Court
for another trial based on new evidence.
   A Feb. 9 hearing has been scheduled on that request by lawyers
Ellis Rubin and Mark Lane. They claim prosecutors framed Richardson
and that a neighbor who frequently baby-sat the children was the
killer.
   Rubin said Wednesday's action would not change the course of his
petition.
   ``I do praise the governor for having enough integrity to look at
this case and say something is wrong,'' he said.
   Richardson and his wife were picking fruit on Oct. 25, 1967, when
their children, aged 2 to 8, ate a parathion-laced lunch of beans,
rice and grits. The lunch had been prepared ahead of time, but was
served by neighbor Betsy Reese at the family's Arcadia home.
   Prosecutors said Richardson killed all seven children, but he was
convicted of only one first-degree murder count in May 1968 for the
death of his 8-year-old stepdaughter, Betty Jean Bryant.

   Greenpeace today ended eight days of
harassing a Japanese whaling fleet off Antarctica, leaving
whale-shaped gingerbread cookies to the crews with a note, ``If you
want to eat whales, eat these.''
   The environmental group said its ship, the Gondwana, was steaming
toward a U.S. base on Antarctica's McMurdo Sound, which it claims is
heavily polluted.
   ``We have finally finished our project here,'' said spokesman
Paul Bogart, interviewed by radio telephone aboard the Gondwana.
``We spent 90 minutes flying over the factory ship and three catcher
boats, lowering the packages as a parting gift.''
   Bogart said the note attached to the cookies dropped by
helicopter read: ``We bear no animosity to the Japanese people or
members of the Japanese ships.''
   He said Greenpeace informed the Japanese skipper of Kyo Maru No.
1, the factory ship, that the environmental organization filmed and
photographed the harpooning and electrocution of minke whales during
the past week.
   Japan says it plans to take 300 whales this year as part of its
scientific research to determine the size of whale stocks _ despite
a moratorium imposed by the International Whaling Commission.
Greenpeace contends most of the whale meat will end up in sushi
restaurants in Japan.
   Bogart said the Greenpeace helicopter dropped a box of cookies
for each crew member with an attached note saying: ``If you want to
eat whales, eat these.''
   He said one of the Japanese catcher boats then relayed a message
thanking the group for the package.
   Japanese whaling officials in Tokyo have accused Greenpeace of
engaging in terrorist tactics and endangering lives.
   Greenpeace said its presence temporarily halted the hunt and drew
international attention to the plight of whales.
   The group estimated the Japanese had harpooned 55 minke whales.
   In Wellington, New Zealand, Greenpeace supporters in
blood-spattered overalls today delivered bags of imitation whale
meat to the Japanese Embassy and cultural center to protest the
whale kill.

   A Japanese soap opera is so much the rage
in fundamentalist Iran that sacrilegious praise of its heroine
during a live radio call-in program led to the brief imprisonment of
four Tehran Radio executives.
   An unidentified female caller had contended the series'
persevering protagonist is a better role model for Iranian women
than the daughter of Mohammed, the founder of Islam.
   Those remarks in this predominantly Shiite Moslem land of 50
million people triggered an outcry similar to John Lennon's remark
during a 1960s news conference that the Beatles were ``more popular
than Jesus Christ.''
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini angrily demanded the radio executives
be punished for offending Islam and his wish was heeded.
   Theology aside, the television show ``Oshin,'' which depicts a
girl's travails in devastated postwar Japan, is wildly popular among
Iranians as they recover from their eight-year war with Iraq.
   Traffic stops and blackouts are postponed during broadcasts of
the serial, whose heroine, Oshin, suffers every imaginable hardship
and setback.
   The four executives were sentenced to prison terms by a Tehran
court Tuesday for broadcasting the phone-in program.
   Broadcast Director Mohammad Arab Mazar-Yazdi got five years and
each of the three others _ Mahmoud Abulqasemi, director of Islamic
ideology; Hamid Khunmeri, head of supervision; and Mohammad Rasekh,
editor of ideological programs _ received a four-year sentence and
50 lashes.
   But the official Islamic Republic News Agency today quoted the
daily newspaper Jomhuri Islami as saying Khomeini agreed to pardon
the broadcasters on Wednesday after receiving an appeal on their
behalf from Chief Justice Abdolkarim Musavi Ardebili.
   The news agency, monitored in Nicosia, said Khomeini had stressed
in a letter to the state-run radio's director that ``if proven there
was a deliberate insult'' the caller should ``receive the death
sentence.''
   The revolutionary patriarch's fierce reaction to the call
underlined the religious passions that flow through Iran. But those
passions have not kept the soap opera from captivating Iranian
television viewers.
   The drama, whose broadcasts began last year in Iran, was chosen
by officials who thought Oshin an exemplary role model for Iranians
suffering hardships that included Iraqi rocket attacks on Tehran and
the loss of, by some estimates, a million of their countrymen.
   It became an instant hit.
   Week after week, Oshin, struggles on despite food shortages and
cruel relatives, loses her house in a fire, and faces trial after
trial.
   After Oshin's father died in one episode, an Iranian newspaper
published a full-page obituary. Letters of condolence and telegrams
poured in from all over the country.
   When the heroine couldn't find enough rice to feed herself,
sympathizers sent the TV station some of their own precious rice
rationing coupons for her.
   An Iranian schoolboy who recently traveled to Cyprus brought with
him a prized possession: a pocket-sized poster of Oshin, which he
said he bought outside his school for about $2.50.
   Oshin has become a popular brand name for everything from shoes
to electrical appliances. According to travelers from Tehran, it's
also a favorite name for new-born baby girls.
   Daily power outages, which last up to six hours in the larger
cities, are never scheduled for Saturday nights, when Oshin is
broadcast.
   Just before the hour-long episodes, TV announcers ask viewers to
switch off all unnecessary electric lights and appliances so the
power supply will not be overloaded while the show is running.
   One Tehran woman who experienced an unexpected blackout on
Saturday recently while Oshin was showing, called a taxi to take her
to another part of the city where the power was still on so she
could see the show.
   The driver raced her to a cafe, where both sat down to see the
program over a cup of tea.
   Tehran's hectic traffic grinds to a halt while Oshin is on TV.
   ``If you want to hail a taxi while Oshin is on you're out of
luck,'' one traveler from Tehran said.
   Thus, on Saturday, birthday of the prophet's daughter Fatima
Zahra, when the woman who telephoned in to the daily ``Family''
radio program was asked whether Fatima Zahra was a fitting model for
Iranian women, her answer was an emphatic `No.'
   ``Fatima Zahra is not acceptable because she lived 1,400 years
ago,'' she said. ``I prefer Oshin.''

   A high school student could be expelled for
saying she had AIDS in trying to excuse extended absences from
classes, officials said.
   ``Anybody who'd pull a cheap stunt like that is in for a lot of
trouble,'' Mayor Joe Smitherman told a news conference Wednesday
after the girl tested negative for acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   The student, who was not identified, gave her teacher a letter
Tuesday claiming she was frequently absent because she had
contracted the disease, said Selma School Superintendent Norward
Russell.
   Initial blood tests were negative for AIDS, but Smitherman said
the student would be kept out of school for the next two weeks while
blood samples are tested further.
   Russell said the student could be expelled, and Smitherman said
police would try to determine who wrote the letter.

   A man was killed and another was injured

Pittsburgh suburb.
   The blast Wednesday was heard four miles away.
   Officials were trying to obtain dental records to identify the
dead man, who was alone in the house that exploded, but relatives of
owner Marion Sandusky said they suspected the victim was her son,
Richard.
   Next-door neighbor John Scott, 81, remained in good condition
today at McKeesport Hospital, where he was being treated for smoke
inhalation.
   ``I lost my clothes, I lost my wallet, I lost my money, I lost my
tools, I lost everything,'' said Scott, who was saved by a neighbor
and a firefighter moments before his house collapsed and burned.
   Authorities suspect the explosion was caused by a natural gas
leak, said Police Chief Thomas Brletic.

<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gun-owners group that led an unsuccessful
attempt to repeal Maryland's handgun control law last year is
threatening to boycott businesses that supported the statute.
   A letter was mailed recently to more than 200 businesses on the
stationery of the Maryland State Rifle and Pistol Association. It
was signed by Fred Griisser, a leader of the 1988 campaign against a
law that bans cheap handguns.
   ``We're going to give the people a chance to explain themselves
before we declare a boycott,'' said Robert McMurray, membership
chairman of the gun group. ``We are going to declare a boycott
against those who don't respond.''
   The association already has withdrawn its funds from Signet Bank
in retaliation for a contribution the bank made to gun control
backers, he said.
   Jack Schwartz, an assistant state attorney general, said he
learned of the letter Wednesday from a printing company that
received a copy.
   ``It's deeply offensive and it's just not the way our system
operates,'' Schwartz said. ``What's so troubling is the election is
over. The voters made their decision, and now there appears to be an
effort of economic retaliation to those who participated.''
   McMurray said 225 to 250 businesses that made contributions to
the Citizens Against Saturday Night Specials were sent letters.
   The letters say an explanation of why businesses supported the
law would be helpful for consumers to ``make a more informed
decision when selecting products and services.''
   They also note that the Maryland State Rifle and Pistol
Association ``represents the interests of the more than 650,000
Maryland voters who thought this (the handgun control law) a bad and
dangerous law.''
   Last November's ballot measure to repeal the law lost by a 58
percent to 42 percent.

   Israel's Christian ally in Lebanon
expelled four Lebanese today from the Israeli buffer zone and killed
three Palestinian guerrillas in an ambush, police said.
   A police spokesman identified one deportee as Yahya Ali, an
educator attached to the Lebanese Ministry of Education. The names
of the other three men _ all Shibaa natives like Ali _ were not
immediately available.
   The Foreign Ministry in Beirut said in a statement it told
Lebanon's U.N. ambassador Rashid Fakhoury to lodge a formal
complaint with the U.N. Security Council to halt a wave of
deportations involving 80 people in the past month.
   Most were expelled after allegations that they refused to
cooperate with Israeli-sponsored local administrations in their
villages or defied orders to join Israel's Christian ally, the South
Lebanon Army.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said militiamen of the South Lebanon Army drove Ali and
his three companions from Shibaa to the edge of Israel's
self-designated security zone.
   In Tyre, militiamen of the South Lebanon Army ambushed during the
night a guerrilla unit near the village of Srobbine, five miles
north of the Israeli border, and killed its three members, a
security source said.
   No casualties were reported among the Christian force, said the
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   It was not immediately clear if the guerrillas were headed for
Israel or planned an attack within the security zone.
   Israel created the zone, which runs up to 10 miles into Lebanon,
when it withdrew most of its occupation army from south Lebanon in
the summer of 1985, ending a three-year invasion.
   The strip is designed to serve as a buffer against guerrilla
attacks into northern Israel, but the infiltrations have continued.

   Demonstrators chanting anti-Nazi
slogans clashed with police outside a meeting of right-wing
extremists, and authorities said today that six people were injured.
   The demonstrators, many of them young leftists, protested outside
Wednesday night's meeting of the Republican Party, which shocked
mainsteam politicians with a strong showing in weekend voting in
West Berlin.
   Police said about 1,000 protesters jammed into Berlin Square, and
later started throwing rocks and bottles in this historic northern
Bavarian city.
   ``Nazis out! Nazis out!'' they chanted outside the restaurant
where about 400 Republican Party members were meeting.
   The demonstrators also clashed with police, leaving four
policemen, one demonstrator and a news photographer injured, police
said in a statement. There was no word on the conditions of those
injured.
   Two of the demonstrators were arrested, the statement said.
   Police assigned to guard the meeting later let the Republican
Party members and supporters out through a back door to prevent
further clashes.
   In Munich, Republican Party chief Franz Schoenhuber said his
members would not yield to the demonstrators' ``terror.''
   ``On the contrary, it makes us as a law-and-order party stronger
and stronger,'' the former Nazi SS soldier told reporters.
   During Sunday's elections in West Berlin, the extremist
Republican Party captured 11 seats in the local legislature and
gained enough votes to send two members to the federal parliament in
Bonn starting next year.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1 million workers closed banks,
stores and most government offices in a nationwide general strike
today to pressure the socialist government into granting wage
increases.
   About 20,000 factory workers, teachers and white-collar employees
marched through downtown Athens to the Labor Ministry shouting ``No
to austerity, yes to substantial pay increases.''
   The demonstrators tied up traffic as they marched through the
city center, but police reported no serious disturbances.
   Local labor centers in 30 cities and towns throughout the country
organized similar demonstrations.
   Hospital were accepting only emergency cases during the 24-hour
strike, which included workers in the private sector, officials said.
   The strike also paralyzed public transportation nationwide and
closed down offices of the state-controlled Public Power Corp. and
of the Greek Telecommunication Organization.
   A spokesman for Olympic Airways said the state-run carrier's
ground staff and technicians also walked off the job, causing
cancellation of today's domestic and international flights.
   The walkout came a day after educators nationwide locked students
out of classrooms to demand more government spending on education.
The teachers plan to continue the stike through Friday.
   In addition to across-the-board wage increased linked to
inflation, today's strikers want a three-hour reduction in the
40-hour work week, five weeks of annual leave and an immediate curb
on price increases.
   Greek workers, who have a monthly average take-home income of
$467, now have four weeks of annual vacation.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement
imposed nearly a complete freeze on wages in October 1985 to combat
annual inflation that had risen above 24 percent. Inflation now runs
at about 14 percent.
   However, real incomes dropped by an estimated 12 percent during
the two-year austerity program, which ended December 1987.

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anthropologist Richard Leakey, who resigned
as director of the National Museums of Kenya nearly two weeks ago,
was back at work today, but he refused to explain why he had changed
his mind.
   The scientist declined to discuss the circumstances that led him
to return Wednesday as director and chief executive of the museum.
   His secretary told The Associated Press that Leakey was back in
his office today, but ``says he doesn't want to talk to the press.''
   Leakey, 45, son of the late anthropologist Louis Leakey, had
headed the National Museums of Kenya for 20 years when he resigned
Jan. 20.
   At that time, Leakey said the Ministry of Home Affairs had
appointed a new board of trustees for the museum without
consultations, and that he was helping carry out the ministry's
``reorganization.''
   The museum houses Africa's best collection of fossils and human
artifacts. The ministry on Jan. 27 issued a statement reinstating
the disbanded board, on which Leakey had served as secretary. The
ministry did not mention its earlier action.
   Leakey on Sunday told The Associated Press he was waiting for the
old board to reconvene and formally offer him his job back.
   ``Until then I'll stay in my shamba (farm),'' he said.
   Last month, a Nairobi newspaper, The Standard, quoted
unidentified museum employees as blaming Leakey for an exodus of
African scientists from the institution, which has a staff of 300.
Museum employees later signed a public letter defending their
director.
   Leakey, a Kenya citizen, is a high school dropout who learned
anthropology at the knees of his parents, Louis and Mary, pioneers
in the discipline.
   In 1972, at age 27, Leakey found a skull of a man-like creature
while leading an expedition near Lake Turkana in northwestern Kenya.
   The skull was later established to be 2.5 million or more years
old, pushing mankind's family back at least a million years. The
skull is known simply as 1470, its catalogue number in the Kenyan
museum.
   Until Richard's 1972 discovery, the oldest precusor of man was
thought to date 1.5 million years. It was represented by a skull
found by Louis Leakey 14 years earlier in northern Tanzania and
dubbed homo habilis, or handy man.

<HEAD>No Damage or Injuries Reported As Moderate Quake Shakes Southern

   A moderate earthquake centered in the
Pacific Ocean shook a wide area of Southern California, startling
residents but apparently causing no damage or injuries, authorities
said.
   The temblor, which struck at 8:51 p.m. Wednesday, measured 3.8 on
the Richter scale of ground motion, said Robert Finn, a spokesman
for the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, which
measures earthquake activity. The quake was centered five miles
southwest of Point Dume.
   Karen Nosker, a waitress at Alice's Restaurant on the nearby
Malibu Pier, said the front of the restaurant trembled when the
quake hit.
   ``All the windows were rattling and everybody stopped talking,''
she said.
   The quake was followed by up to a dozen small aftershocks, Finn
said.
   The location of the quake is 15 miles west of the epicenter of a
5.0-magnitude quake that struck eight miles off the Malibu coast
Jan. 18. But Finn said Wednesday's shaker was not an aftershock of
that one.
   The Jan. 18 quake, which was followed by more than 150
aftershocks, injured three people, shattered windows and knocked out
power to 100,000 people.
   Wednesday's quake was felt across a wide area of Los Angeles and
Ventura counties.
   ``We've had a couple of calls of windows shaking (but) no
damage,'' said sheriff's Deputy Venita Ward in Malibu. ``As one guy
put it, his cat didn't even look up.''
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude, or the height of quake-generated shock waves recorded
on a seismograph.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6
severe damage.

   The foreign ministers of China and the Soviet
Union agreed today that progress is being made in resolving the
Cambodia conflict, which has hampered Sino-Soviet efforts to end a
generation of strained relations.
   The Soviet, Eduard Shevardnadze, also concurred with the Chinese
position that international supervision will be needed to ensure
peace in Cambodia after Vietnam ends its 10-year occupation of the
Southeast Asian country.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said Shevardnadze's nearly
three-hour meeting with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen focused on
Cambodia and did not touch on the main purpose of Shevardnadze's
visit _ setting a date for the first Sino-Soviet summit since 1959.
   The meeting between Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
Chinese senior leader Deng Xiaoping, expected this spring, is likely
to be discussed when the foreign ministers meet again Friday.
   Shevardnadze is the first Soviet foreign minister to visit China
since Andrei Gromyko came in 1959 with Nikita Krushchev. Today's
official China Youth News said Shevardnadze was a welcome change
from the ``unyielding position'' of the stone-faced Gromyko.
   Shevardnadze's ``grasp of foreign affairs is by no means second
to his predecessor,'' the report said. ``He has a great amount of
authority and quickly understands the essence of a problem.''
   Li quoted Shevardnadze as saying the process of settling the
Cambodian question is ``speeding up.'' Qian agreed, saying: ``The
situation concerning the Kampuchean (Cambodian) question has been
developing.''
   Qian said the three Chinese-backed resistance factions and the
Vietnam-backed government should be allowed to solve the question of
Cambodia's future free from outside interference.
   Asked by reporters if Cambodia has ceased to be an obstacle to
better Sino-Soviet relations, Li said: ``Both China and the Soviet
Union maintain that Vietnam should pull out all its troops from
Kampuchea as early as possible. The two sides hold that the
Kampuchean question should be given a fair and reasonable solution
and for this purpose the two countries have been making much
effort.''
   Differences reportedly remain on the structure of a transitional
government and the nature of the ``international supervision'' to be
introduced after Vietnam's pullout. Vietnam has promised to withdraw
its troops by September.
   China has said Moscow's financial support for Vietnam is the most
serious of ``three obstacles'' to normalizing political relations
strained for the past three decades.
   The other two were the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan _ which
Moscow says will end this month _ and Soviet troop strength on the
Sino-Soviet border. Gorbachev last month pledged to reduce Soviet
troops in Asia, many of whom are along the Chinese border, by
200,000.
   Progress on those obstacles paved the way for Qian in December to
make the first trip by a Chinese foreign minister to Moscow in 32
years.
   Li said the ``question of relaxing the situation along the
Sino-Soviet border'' was also discussed at the meeting in the Great
Hall of the People.
   The two sides fought a short border war in 1969. Sino-Soviet
relations soured in the late 1950s as Nikita S. Khrushchev and Mao
Tse-tung split over ideological and strategic differences, and
Khrushchev ended all Soviet technical and military aid to China in
1960.
   Economic and cultural relations have slowly improved in the
1980s, but party and government ties will not be formally normalized
until the summit takes place.
   Also today, Shevardnadze toured the Great Wall, about 40 miles
northwest of Beijing. He will meet Premier Li Peng on Friday and fly
to Shanghai for a Saturday meeting with Deng Xiaoping.

   Hiroshima will seek contributions from around the
world to help pay for preserving a wrecked dome left standing as a
reminder of the atomic bombing of the city in 1945, a city official
said today.
   Toru Kataoka of the city-run Hiroshima Peace Memorial Hall said
about half of the $1.5 million needed for preserving the Atomic Bomb
Dome will be funded by donations. The rest will be covered by the
city government, he said.
   The Aug. 6, 1945, bombing in Hiroshima killed up to 140,000
people. The Atomic Bomb Dome used to be the city's Industry
Promotion Hall.
   Three days after the Hiroshima attack, 70,000 more people were
killed in Nagasaki when the United States dropped a second atomic
bomb.
   Kataoka said Hiroshima could have funded the project alone but
decided to solicit funds to spread its message of peace worldwide.
   The dome in Hiroshima Memorial Park is the only wrecked building
still in place from the bombing.

   An Afghan guerrilla leader predicted
today that Afghanistan's government will collapse soon after Soviet
troops are gone and that guerrilla forces will not have to launch
major attacks on key cities.
   ``The regime will fall in weeks, not months,'' Gulbaddin
Hekmatyar, leader of Hezb-i-Islami guerrilla group, told a news
conference in Peshawar, headquarters of the seven Afghan guerrilla
groups.
   ``The whole world will be witness to the fact that Kabul will
fall without any major onslaught on the city,'' he said.
   Hekmatyar said arrangements had been made to secure the fall of
major cities without large-scale attacks, but he gave no details.
   Also today, a senior guerrilla military commander, Abdul Haq,
said that while Afghanistan's communist government could not survive
long, there were indications the regime was making efforts to defend
itself.
   Haq, who commands guerrilla forces of the Yunis Khalis group
around Kabul, said 5,000 special troops recently returned from the
Soviet Union after receiving training in street fighting to defend
cities against rebel attacks.
   The government was also building up special units to form
defenses against the guerrillas after the withdrawal of Soviet
forces, he said.
   Haq said the Afghan army, formed largely of recruits forced into
the service, has shown signs of collapse and was of little use in
major operations. The government forces are increasingly confined to
large towns and cities while the guerrillas control the surrounding
countryside, he said.
   Under a U.N. agreement, the Red Army is to be out of Afghanistan
by Feb. 15. It intervened in the country in December 1979 to back
the government in its war with Moslem guerrillas.

   Ferdinand Marcos has been placed back on a
respirator and has taken a ``definite turn for the worse,'' and his
wife is recovering after fainting while accompanying him to the
operating room, officials said.
   The 71-year-old ousted Philippine president, who underwent
emergency surgery Wednesday at St. Francis Medical Center, was in
critical but stable condition today, said a hospital operator who
refused to give her name.
   Philippine Vice President Salvador Laurel said he was leaving for
Hawaii today for a meeting requested by Marcos' wife, Imelda,
because doctors had advised Marcos ``that he hasn't much time left
to live.''
   ``He's basically very, very weak and depending completely on the
respirator to regulate his breathing,'' hospital spokeswoman Norma
Kop said Wednesday. ``He had been doing better, so this is a
definite turn for the worse.''
   Joe Lazo, a friend who visited the couple Wednesday, said Marcos
``looks the worst I've ever seen him.''
   Marcos underwent an emergency tracheotomy early Wednesday because
of fluids building up in his lungs, nursing supervisor Cindy Miller
said.
   During the 40-minute operation, a tube was inserted into Marcos'
throat to make it easier for him to breathe and to clear his lungs.
He was hooked to a respirator and had a slight fever, she said.
   Mrs. Marcos, 59, fainted while accompanying her husband as he was
being wheeled to surgery, and fell and hit her head, Miller said.
   ``She was exhausted, she's gone several days without sleep, and
then knowing what they were doing to the president, she just passed
out,'' said Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad, adding that he expected
Mrs. Marcos to be hospitalized for one or two days.
   No one caught Mrs. Marcos as she fell face forward onto the floor
because everyone was walking behind her as Marcos was being wheeled
to surgery, Trinidad said.
   ``I was so shocked,'' Trinidad said. ``All of this is just
starting to get to her. ... I hope it's nothing serious. The doctors
said she needs a lot of rest.''
   Mrs. Marcos' head injury was not serious, but she was admitted
into the room that had been used by her husband, Miller said. She
was in satisfactory condition today.
   An aide who answered the phone in her hospital room said Mrs.
Marcos was resting comfortably but unable to take calls.
   Marcos was admitted to the hospital on Jan. 15 for treatment of
pneumonia and bronchial asthma. In December, he was hospitalized
twice for treatment of congestive heart failure.
   A federal judge in New York is to decide this month whether
Marcos is healthy enough to stand trial on criminal racketeering
charges accusing him of plundering his homeland and stashing much of
the money in the United States.
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the charges and is free on $5
million bail.
   The Marcoses have lived in Hawaii since fleeing the Philippines
during a civilian-military uprising that brought Corazon Aquino to
power in February 1986.
   In Manila today, Mrs. Aquino said she believed that Marcos'
condition ``is neither critical nor serious.''
   Laurel's announcement that he was traveling to Hawaii followed
rumors in Manila and in Honolulu that he and Filipino industrialist
Enrique Zobel were trying to work out a deal to allow Marcos to
return to his native land.
   Laurel said he had informed Mrs. Aquino and Executive Secretary
Catalino Macaraig of his trip and would immediately relay message to
the president.
   Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno said Laurel was acting on
his own and not as an emissary of Mrs. Aquino.

   Authorities have apologized to a man who was
arrested more than a dozen times on warrants meant for someone else,
but they denied charges that the arrests were racially motivated.
   ``There have been people of all races arrested on warrants that
were issued for another person with the same name,'' said Assistant
Police Chief Ray Sanders.
   ``We would hope that the person insist he is not the right one
and that the officers would listen to him. It would appear that the
ball was dropped in this case,'' Sanders said.
   At a news conference Tuesday, Sylvester Brown said he was
arrested 14 times over the past 10 years on warrants issued for a
Sylvester E. Brown. Both are 39. Sylvester E. Brown remains at
large, Sanders said.
   After learning of the mistaken arrests, Sheriff Doyne Bailey
issued a memorandum in October alerting deputies and booking
officers of the ``existence of two Sylvester Browns with the similar
descriptions and dates of birth.'' Brown was given a copy of the
memo to carry.
   But the wrongly arrested Brown said only one arresting officer
gave him the opportunity to explain that he wasn't the man named in
the warrants.
   ``There are real racial overtones. I don't think that a white
person would have been treated the same way,'' said Gary Bledsoe,
president of the local National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.
   Lt. Roger Napier, of the police internal affairs division, said
his office was investigating the warrants to see when they were
issued and why they were never cleared.
   The police department also plans to issue a memo to all officers
informing them of the mistaken arrests, Napier said.
   ``I can understand Mr. Brown's position,'' Napier said. ``If it
happens once, that's going to upset you, but if it happens
repeatedly, you're going to lose your patience. Nobody likes to
admit that they're wrong, that they've made a mistake. But that's
what happened.''

   A U.S. Air Force plane carrying tons of
equipment and a team of clean-up experts headed to Antarctica today
to fight an oil spill that some scientists say could pose a major
environmental threat.
   The huge C-5 plane was bound for the southern city of Punta
Arenas, where its cargo and the 15-member team will be transferred
to a U.S. research vessel, the Polar Duke, the U.S. Embassy in
Santiago said.
   In the Antarctic, U.S. scientists were trying to catch floating
oil barrels and propane containers near the spill, which was four
miles in diameter and moving to the southwest, the National Science
Foundation said.
   The agency said in Washington the Argentine supply vessel that
released the oil after it ran aground and sank was carrying 250,000
gallons of diesel fuel. It said an ``incurable disaster'' would
result if all the fuel leaks into the region's unspoiled waters.
   In Buenos Aires, an Argentine navy spokesman said the spill would
not pose a serious ecological threat.
   A spokesman for the Chilean navy agreed. ``The information that
we have is that there is no big spill,'' said Lt. Juan Pablo Barros
in a telephone interview today.
   The Bahia Paraiso (Paradise Bay) ran aground on Saturday in the
Bismarck Strait, 600 miles south of the southern tip of South
America and 1{ miles from the U.S. Palmer Research Station on the
Antarctic Peninsula. The ship was carrying supplies for Antarctic
outposts and sightseers.
   All 250 passengers and crew were rescued, but the ship floated
free in heavy seas and sank Tuesday, dropping barrels of oil and
several hundred propane gas containers into the water, said Jack
Talmadge, a spokesman for the National Science Foundation.
   Another foundation spokesman in Washington, Jack Renerie, said
most of the oil was in steel drums so the ecological threat may not
be great. However, ``There's a bunch of free (drifting) oil down
there,'' he said. ``The slick has arrived at Palmer Station,'' a
scientific outpost run by the foundation.
   Renerie said personnel at the station had collected some steel
barrels of fuel oil and tanks of compressed gas near the ship.
   ``The latest we have now is that there's probably 150 to 200
barrels (still) in the water,'' Renerie said in a telephone
interview today from Santiago. ``And there's still oil coming out of
the ship.''
   He said the ship is about ``80 to 90 percent underwater'' but
appears to have settled firmly on a shoal.
   ``The water surrounding the ship is covered with a couple of
centimeters (about an inch) of oil. There is a sheen of oil in a
much wider area around the ship, including evidence of oil on the
coastline of the several islands there,'' Talmadge said.
   ``Wildlife has already begun to be affected,'' including krill,
the small crustaceans that form the basis of the Antarctic food
chain, Talmadge said.
   ``Birds which have eaten the krill are showing behavior
differences,'' he said. ``One dead penguin had been found as of a
few hours ago.''
   The Air Force transport left Norfolk, Va., on Wednesday and was
to arrive in Chile today. Talmadge said its crew and 52 tons of
cargo would reach the accident site by Monday.
   The cargo includes a 35-foot ``skimming boat'' for scooping up
spilled oil and pumping it into floating tanks; a small tugboat;
inflatable booms to contain the spill, and a special truck for
loading and unloading the equipment, said Renerie. He said it was
accompanied by a crew from two private U.S. clean-up companies,
Marine Pollution Control and Global Associates.
   The National Science Foundation is organizing the clean-up
mission with assistance from the Air Force, Navy and the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.

   Artillery fire echoed through the
capital today as President Najib sought to assure reporters his
government will survive once Soviet soldiers are gone and his troops
alone face Moslem guerrillas.
   A Moslem guerrilla leader in Pakistan predicted the Najib
government will collapse as soon as the Red Army has left.
   Also today, Western journalists saw a convoy of more than 100
Soviet trucks and tanks starting out along the Salang Highway, the
only road from Kabul to the Soviet border.
   ``State power is in full control of the situation, despite the
difficulties,'' Najib told a news conference in an unheated room at
the Foreign Ministry.
   Reporters were not allowed to leave the building during the
conference for security reasons, and explosions and artillery fire
could be heard.
   Najib said his Soviet-backed government cannot be excluded from
any future coalition with Moslem insurgents, who have refused any
power-sharing arrangement and are not party to the U.N.-mediated
accord under which the Soviets promised to withdraw all their troops
by Feb. 15.
   Najib said all Soviet forces would be out ``in the next few
days.'' He would not elaborate.
   Afghan troops are ``capable of independently defending the people
and the homeland and can give a resolute and mental rebuff to the
opposition,'' Najib asserted.
   Fears have increased in Kabul because of uncertainty about the
army's ability to defend the capital against the insurgents, who at
several points have shut off the flow of food and fuel.
   In Pakistan, guerrilla leader Gulbaddin Hekmatyar told reporters
today Najib's regime ``will fall in weeks, not months.''
   Hekmatyar, leader of the Hezb-i-Islami guerrilla group, said
major cities, including Kabul, will fall without the guerrillas
having to launch large-scale attacks.
   Najib expressed optimism that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze might be able to help in a political settlement to the
conflict in a planned visit Saturday to Pakistan, a key supporter of
the guerrillas with the United States.
   The president insisted his People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan will have to be part of any solution: ``Any attempt to
exclude the PDPA and its allies in a coalition government will be in
vain.''
   The Soviets intervened in December 1979 to help fight an
insurgency that began a year earlier when Marxists seized power in a
bloody coup. The Soviet force numbered about 115,000 before the
pullout began.
   Moscow has assured the Najib government it will continue to
provide military assistance after its last soldiers are gone.
   An estimated 1,000 flatbed trucks carrying rocket launchers,
ammunition and small missiles move north along the Salang Highway
every day, Afghan officers stationed along the road have said.
   Guerrillas bombarded a Soviet convoy on Wednesday two miles past
a checkpoint north of Kabul.
   The Soviets also use the highway to carry flour, eggs, kerosene
and fuel to the capital, where food and fuel shortages have been
reported in recent weeks, partly due to guerrilla attacks on convoys
moving on the highway.
   The emergency shipments have helped ease the long lines that
formed outside bread shacks. Most lines have disappeared or become
noticeably shorter.
   It was unclear how long the Soviet tranport will continue to
Kabul, where refugees from the war have more than doubled the
population to 2 million.
   In Pakistan, officials today said an Afghan military transport
plane apparently ran out of fuel and crashed about 20 miles inside
Pakistan, killing at least nine crew members.
   They said the plane went down Tuesday in a remote area of North
West Frontier Province, but would not say if the Afghans were trying
to defect.
   Searchers recovered nine bodies, some clad in Afghan military
uniforms, and the remnants of long-range rockets and other arms,
said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. They would
not identify the type of aircraft.
   There was no immediate comment from the Afghan government or
state media.
   Pakistan-based guerrillas said Wednesday that 400 government
troops defected during weekend assaults in Kandahar, Afghanistan's
second largest city. The report could not be independently confirmed.

   As the crack problem grows ever larger, its
victims have become ever younger. The latest two _ an 11-year-old
alleged to be a drug courier and a 10-year-old crack dealer _ left
officials wondering if they're losing the drug fight.
   ``Crack and drugs are so pervasive that of course it trickles
down into the lower grades,'' said Paul Berczeller, a spokesman for
the United Federation of Teachers. ``You have young kids used every
day as drug runners.''
   Ginay Marks, a Brooklyn school board activist for 17 years,
agreed: ``I would say in terms of crack _ and we thought heroin was
an epidemic _ nothing has spread with such rapidity among our school
children.''
   The two grade-schoolers arrested in separate incidents less than
three weeks apart offered examples of both street and school
incidents, authorities said.
   The 10-year-old was arrested Jan. 15 after police watched him and
a 14-year-old partner make a half-dozen crack sales in Wyandanch,
Long Island. The 5-foot-tall boy had three $20 vials of crack and
$226 cash on him when arrested.
   A Family Court judge ruled Wednesday that he had committed the
crimes and scheduled sentencing for Feb. 10. The boy faces up to 18
months' detention in a youth facility or two years' probation.
Charges against the 14-year-old were pending.
   On Tuesday, an 11-year-old boy arrived at his Bronx elementary
school carrying what looked like his lunch bag. Inside, school
officials found 411 vials of crack, most in 10-packs worth $50
apiece.
   The special education student told police his 17-year-old brother
had given him the drugs. A search was on Wednesday for the brother,
said police spokesman Officer Hugh Barry.
   A Family Court hearing was held Wednesday for the 11-year-old,
but there was no ruling. The city also filed a petition seeking to
put the boy, his 13-year-old brother and 5-year-old sister in foster
care.
   ``When an 11-year-old child with special learning needs is
exploited as a drug carrier, it reaffirms my belief that drugs are
the most serious problem our youth must confront,'' said Schools
Chancellor Richard Green.
   Local School Board President Lawrence A. Warden, whose Bronx
district includes the school that the 11-year-old attended, said he
was ``shocked and angry'' after the arrest.
   ``We don't expect that from an 11-year-old youngster. It's like
carrying a loaded machine gun in a playground,'' said Warden.
   Board of Education spokesman Robert Terte, saying much of the
problem is on the streets around the schools, noted that the number
of drug arrests on school property was down in the past year. In
1987, the figure was 114; for 1988, it was 94.
   ``Remember, you're talking about 180 school days, with nearly
1,000 schools and 940,000 kids,'' said Terte. ``In percentage terms,
that's a very small number.''
   But Berczeller said the increasing drug problem was at least
partially responsible for the increase in violence against teachers
in the city. For the period Sept. 1-Dec. 1, 1988, 188 teachers were
assaulted; for the same period in 1987, the figure was 119 teachers
_ a 58 percent jump, he said.
   To try to stem the drug tide, the city runs a drug education
program that runs from kindergarten through 12th grade, said
Georgeanne DelCanto, acting assistant director of health, physical
education and substance abuse for the city schools.
   Each city school district is also assigned five to 15 drug
counselors, and a special anti-crack curriculum was started two
years ago, she said. Ms. Marks, who is also on Gov. Mario Cuomo's
advisory council on substance abuse, said she believed certain
programs in her district were helping students avoid drugs.
   But the two arrests _ particularly the one of a special education
student in his school _ have other officials wondering if the tide
is turning into a tidal wave.
   ``Are we losing the battle? I think we're in the middle of the
battle. But the schools are not immune from the ills of society,''
said Berczeller. ``If you have kids running drugs on the street,
you'll find kids running drugs in the schools.''

   A blast of cold air out of Alaska brought snowstorms and plunging
temperatures to the West and Midwest, triggering hundreds of traffic
accidents and closing schools, and threatened to end the East's
record warm spell today.
   ``Today was it. It will get seasonal,'' National Weather Service
meteorologist Bill Scura said at Atlantic City Airport in Pomona,
N.J., where a balmy reading of 69 degrees was one of 51
high-temperature records broken or tied in the East and South on
Wednesday.
   At least two people died in weather-related traffic accidents in
Idaho and Oregon on Wednesday. Authorities in Coleraine, Minn.,
blamed minus 20-degree temperatures for the hypothermia death of a
31-year-old woman whose frozen body was found on a sidewalk.
   Snow continued falling today from the Pacific Northwest to the
northern Rockies, northern Plains, and upper Mississippi Valley, and
was expected to spread to the Great Lakes. Freezing drizzle
slickened roads from Missouri to Indiana.
   The foul weather was accompanied by equally foul temperatures in
many places. In the Dakotas and Montana, where Gov. Stan Stephens
declared a state of emergency, winds up to 40 mph produced wind
chills as low as minus 90 degrees Wednesday.
   Low-temperature records for the date were set this morning in
Casper, Wyo., where it was 23 below zero; Great Falls, Mont., 33
below; and Sheridan, Wyo., whose 28-below reading beat the old
record by 8 degrees.
   The storms caused traffic accidents in Washington state, Oregon,
California and Utah, and knocked out power to thousands of people in
Washington, Montana and Utah.
   Snow closed schools in Washington, Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday,
and dangerously low temperatures shut them in Montana today and in
North Dakota through Friday. Farther east, some schools in Indiana
and Michigan were closed because of freezing rain that made travel
hazardous.
   Pupils at Richholt Elementary School in Bismarck, N.D., were
``running down the halls and shouting, `Sinner for president! Sinner
for president!''' Principal Rick Buresh said Wednesday after Gov.
George Sinner ordered schools shut. Officials said it was the first
time in memory that schools were closed statewide in North Dakota
because of cold.
   Near Truckee, Calif., in the Sierra Nevada 75 miles northeast of
Sacramento, a tour bus overturned on icy, wind-swept Interstate 80,
sending 23 people to the hospital, authorities said. Six were
admitted.
   In Washington, icy roads caused a 100-car string of accidents on
Interstate 5 just north of Seattle, said State Patrol spokesman Bill
Burkett. More than 200 accidents were reported in the Puget Sound
area.
   Winds gusted over 100 mph, knocking out power to up to 15,000
customers in the Bellingham area, and 1,500 others in the western
part of the state. Snow caved in the roof of Everett's soccer
center, doing $250,000 damage.
   Snowy runways caused delays at Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport, ferries were kept at their docks in Seattle, pipes froze
and auto parts stores reported runs on antifreeze and tire chains.
   ``I've already run out of several sizes (of chains),'' said John
McCall, assistant manager of the McCall Les Schwab Tire Center in
Astoria, Ore.
   In Utah, rain cut power to 4,000 people in Salt Lake City and
hundreds more in communities as far north as Ogden about 40 miles
away. Snow followed the rain in Salt Lake City, which ended up with
11.9 inches of snow in 24 hours, a record for a 24-hour period in
February.
   In Wyoming, up to 10 inches of snow and gusting winds prompted a
ban on some snowmobile travel and all backcountry travel at
Yellowstone National Park, said park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo. As
much as a foot of snow was expected today.
   In western Nebraska, the plunge in temperatures from the 20s
Tuesday to below zero Wednesday resulted in a 20 percent increase in
business at the Sapp Bros.-Sidney truck stop, said Manager Mike
Machamer.
   ``Hot chocolate, hot coffee, doughnuts and hot dogs, anything
that's hot'' sold big, Machamer said.
   Freezing drizzle this morning caused a Delta 727 bound for
Atlanta to skid partway off an icy taxiway at Detroit Metropolitan
Airport, officials said. No one among the 57 on board was injured.
The right landing gear of the plane got stuck in the mud, and the
passengers were put on another flight.
   The East and South enjoyed gentler weather Wednesday. It was 63
degrees in Portland, Maine; 66 degrees in Boston; 80 degrees in
Little Rock, Ark.; and 74 in Richmond, Va. Records dating to 1887
fell.
   Around normally cold New England, office workers in shirtsleeves
enjoyed lunch breaks outdoors and people wheeled babies around city
parks.
   On Atlantic City's boardwalk, strollers were out in force and an
open bench was hard to find.
   ``Isn't this beautiful!'' said Robert Murdock, a retired postal
worker from New York City. ``After you've worked for so many years
inside, this is the gravy.''
   But today's forecast held temperatures in the single digits and
teens in northern Maine and in the 20s and 30s in the rest of New
England and the Great Lakes. New York state, Pennsylvania, Arkansas,
Kentucky and northern Texas were expected to have readings in the
40s and 50s.
   By midmorning today, the mid-Atlantic states still had
above-normal temperatures. But in Burlington, Vt., the temperature
had dropped from 46 degrees at 1 p.m. Wednesday to 9 degrees at 9
a.m. today.
   ``This warm spell won't last long,'' weather service forecaster
Mike Wyllie warned from Boston.

   A 12-year-old boy accused of sexually assaulting a
woman in her townhouse has been ordered held on $1 million bond.
   Denver County Judge Robert Crew said he set the high bond
Wednesday for the boy because of other cases pending against the
youth. He previously was convicted of burglary and indecent exposure.
   The 5-foot-7, 150-pound youth allegedly tied up a 28-year-old
woman and raped her on Friday while free on a $300 bond, which
stemmed from an attack on another woman in southeast Denver last
summer.
   Detectives say he is the youngest rape suspect they can recall.
``We've never seen anything like this,'' police Sgt. B.J. Haze said.
   Because of his age, the boy's name was withheld.
   Since he must be charged as a juvenile, the maximum sentence the
youth could receive for all the charges is five years, court
administrator Tim Turley said.

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha, who is
recovering from a stroke he suffered two weeks ago, resigned today
as the leader of the governing National Party but said he will stay
on as the nation's president.
   Botha, 73, told party officials in a letter that he was resigning
the party post to concentrate on his presidential duties and to
distance the presidency from partisan politics, state radio reported.
   The National Party's parliamentary caucus chose National
Education Minister F.W. de Klerk to replace Botha as party leader.
   At a news conference in Cape Town today, de Klerk declined to
discuss his political agenda. He appears to favor Botha's policies
of limited and gradual reform of South Africa's apartheid system of
racial separation.
   The party parliamentary caucus chose de Klerk by a vote of 69-61
over Finance Minister Barend du Plessis, who is considered slightly
more moderate, said the state-run South African Broadcasting Corp.
   Other contenders _ including Foreign Minister Pik Botha and the
acting president, Constitutional Develpoment Minister Chris Heunis _
were eliminated in early rounds of balloting, according to state
radio.
   Botha became party leader in 1978 when he was elected prime
minister. He became president in 1984 under a new constitution that
abolished the post of prime minister.
   South Africa's president is selected by the political party that
controls Parliament, which opens this year's session Friday in Cape
Town.
   Botha has refused to discuss his possible retirement but has said
during the past year he would consider reducing his work load.
   A bill has been introduced to revive the post of prime minister
to share leadership duties with the president.
   Botha is recovering from his stroke at his private residence in
Cape Town and takes daily walks in his garden, his doctors say.
   The stroke weakened Botha's left arm and left leg, and he will
need at least one more month of rest before he can consider
returning to work, the doctors said today.
   As education minister, de Klerk, 52, has not been associated with
any major reforms. He supported a controversial crackdown on
anti-apartheid dissent at universities and has tried to halt
defections from the National Party to the extreme-right Conservative
Party.
   De Klerk said today that if he wanted to propose any policy
changes as head of the National Party, ``I would like first to have
a discussion with the state president.''
   ``A very special relationship will now have to develop between
myself as leader-in-chief of the National Party on the one hand and
the state president as chief executive on the other hand,'' he said
at the news conference.
   De Klerk declined to answer directly when asked if his selection
as party leader made him the logical successor to Botha. He noted
that his position had ``no direct or formal constitutional
implications.''
   The independent South African Press Association said, however,
that de Klerk's selection as party leader ``is a firm indicator
that, should President Botha resign, he would succeed him.''
   The president is chosen after national elections are held.
   There was widespread speculation Botha would call for an election
in April, but his stroke makes such a ballot unlikely until later
this year, observers say.
   The National Party, which codified apartheid legislation after
coming to power in 1948, has ruled uninterrupted since then and is
expected to maintain power in the next election.
   Other contenders to succeed Botha as president include Heunis, du
Plessis, Pik Botha and Defense Minister Magnus Malan.
   All appear to favor Botha's policies of gradual race reform,
although Pik Botha is considered slightly more liberal than the
others.

   A court today extended the detention of a
Soviet-born Israeli suspected of spying for the PLO.
   Radio reports said the man was arrested after he turned himself
in at the Israeli Embassy in Athens when the Palestine Liberation
Organization refused to give him a promised $1.5 million for
allegedly supplying information.
   A court spokesman reported the decision to extend the man's
detention by 10 days, but the court in Petah Tikva, near Tel Aviv,
barred publication of the suspect's name.
   Israeli radio stations gave detailed coverage of the case and
quoted the man as saying he was disillusioned with Israeli society.
   ``I ask that you take in consideration that all my life I only
wanted to come to Israel, and here I suffered. There were people who
embittered my life every day and each hour,'' radio reports quoted
the 35-year-old immigrant as telling the court. ``I was a better
citizen than those who embittered my life, and I did not understand
the severity of what I did,'' he was quoted as saying.
   He did not cite examples of his problems.
   The case is the second of alleged spying by a Soviet emigre in
the last two months. On Dec. 15, Shabtai Kalmanovitch, 45, was
sentenced to nine years in prison on charges of spying for the
Soviet Union and of having contacts with a foreign agent.
   In the latest case, the court banned publication of details that
could identify the man, but media reports said he immigrated to
Israel in the 1970s and worked at a government institution in
northern Israel.
   Israel radio said the man was married and has two children, ages
5 and 10. It quoted police as telling the court the man had
financial problems and was disappointed at his treatment in Israel.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Considering Major Tank Sale To Saudi Arabia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has informed Congress he may
authorize the sale of 315 front-line Abrams tanks to Saudi Arabia
and 200 to Kuwait while providing a third Arab country, the United
Arab Emirates, with 40 F-18 fighter jets, informed sources said
today.
   Egypt, meanwhile, would get 150 Hawk missiles and Israel 200
shoulder-fired Stingers, while Jordan again would receive no
American weapons this year, said the sources, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The potential Arab purchases could touch off another row with
Israel's supporters in Congress, who were successful during the
Carter and Reagan administrations in blocking U.S. sales that were
considered threating to the Jewish state.
   But the skilfull management of James A. Baker III, then the White
House chief of staff and now secretary of state, and other Reagan
administration operatives overcame stubborn resistance to the sale
of Awacs radar planes to Saudi Arabia which the Senate approved
52-48.
   The Abrams tank is considered the best in the world. Recently,
U.S. and Egyptian officials completed arrangements for co-production
in Egypt with the aim of providing the Egyptian army with them.
   The weapons list sent to Congress last Thursday is classified.
Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee that deals with the Middle East, is understood to have
cautioned other members of Congress and staff aides not to leak any
of the items.
   Meanwhile, the White House, in a cover letter, informed Congress
the Saudis were in the process of deciding whether to request U.S.
or European fighter planes to replace their F-5s in the next decade,
the sources said.
   The letter said the Saudis were considering jet fighters to be
jointly produced by Britain and West Germany and the French Mirage
4000, as well as U.S.-built F-16s and F-18s.
   On the list for the Saudis were seven multiple-launch artillery
rocket systems, for battlefield use, and seven of the box-type
rockets for Kuwait along with 1,500 Tow anti-tank missiles.
   Egypt was listed to receive 150 Hawk anti-aircraft missiles and
Israel four helicopters along with the Stinger missiles.
   Congress had barred U.S. arms sales to Jordan until the Arab
kingdom makes a serious attempt to enter peace talks with Israel.

   Punxsutawney Phil, that plump, pampered
groundhog long touted as America's best mammalian meteorological
prognosticator, saw his shadow today, predicting six more weeks of a
``kinder and gentler'' winter.
   Phil's promoters, declaring today the 102nd Groundhog Day,
rousted the brown, bewhiskered forecaster out of his lighted, heated
burrow at dawn.
   ``In honor of America's new president, George Bush, the groundhog
stood tall and proud. He spotted a thin, short shadow,''
Punxsutawney Groundhog Club President James H. Means told spectators
gathered at Gobbler's Knob, a wooded knoll about three miles south
of Punxsutawney.
   ``The king of all groundhogs is returning to his burrow with a
promise of a kinder and gentler winter,'' Means said.
   Tradition has it if the weather-wise woodchuck sees his shadow,
six more weeks of winter will follow. But if he doesn't, they say
spring is just around the corner.
   Phil's unscientific forecasts don't always hold up, but his
handlers nevertheless claim he's never wrong.
   ``We say he's always right,'' said William Null, secretary of the
groundhog club and executive director of the local Chamber of
Commerce. ``There are some people who contest that, usually
weathermen, but we stand behind Phil 100 percent.''
   Groundhog Day fun has given rise to four-legged forecasters
elsewhere, and most of them today broke with Phil and predicted an
early spring despite the arctic blast that's been working its way
across the country in the past couple of days. But none draws the
attention that Phil does.
   ``Phil's been at it longer than any of the others,'' Null said.
``He's treated like a real king.''
   Some folks in Newport, R.I., made up ``Quahog Day'' and cast a
man dressed as a quahog, a type of clam, to come out of his shell
today. The quahog did not see his shadow, so Rhode Island is
theoretically assured of a short winter.
   Georgia's also off the hook, winter-wise, as a groundhog dubbed
General Lee failed to see a shadow today in Lilburn, Ga.
   West Virginia's Concord Charlie and French Creek Freddy both
failed to see their shadows this morning, as did Buckeye Chuck in
Marion, Ohio, and Rowdy, a groundhog at the Indianapolis Zoo.And it
was likewise in Sun Prairie, Wis., where Jimmy the Groundhog braved
wind-chills of 16 below to predict an early spring there.
   But it is this western Pennsylvania mountain town of about 8,000
people that bills itself as the ``Weather Capital of the World,''
crowns a Groundhog Queen and King, stages a Groundhog Ball, and
attracts tour-bus visitors who often buy souvenirs glorifying the
exalted woodchuck.
   Every year, hundreds of people follow a century-old tradition and
trudge up to Phil's one-morning-a-year home atop Gobbler's Knob.
   Fourteen businessmen of the club's exclusive ``Inner Circle'' don
top hats and tuxedos to carry on the tradition. Actually, Inner
Circle members decide on the groundhog's prediction beforehand.
   Several hours before sunrise, Phil is taken from his year-round
home in a glass-enclosed case next to the town library and shoved
into the man-made burrow to await spectators.
   The woodchuck, whose species usually hibernates until March, is
then hoisted at dawn to the glare of television floodlights and
popping flashbulbs.
   Perhaps cleverly, Phil has predicted an early spring only nine
times _ in 1890, 1902, 1934, 1950, 1970, 1975, 1983, 1986 and 1988,
according to Null.
   Groundhog Day legend is based on an old Scottish couplet
claiming, ``If Candlemas Day is bright and clear, there will be two
winters in the year.'' Feb. 2 is the Christian holiday of Candlemas.
   In the late 1800s, the feast appealed to Punxsutawney's
German-born farmers, who hunted woodchucks for food.
   For the record, the National Weather Service's 30-day outlook
calls for above normal temperatures and below normal precipitation
in the Southeast, below normal temperatures and precipitation over
the Northwest, near normal temperatures and precipitation in the
Northeast, and near normal temperatures and above normal
temperatures over the nation's central area.

   U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings lost a
preliminary round in his impeachment trial today when a Senate panel
called for televised hearings before a special committee rather than
before the full Senate.
   ``There will be no question about the fairness of it,'' Sen.
Wendell Ford, D-Ky., said after the Senate Rules Committee he chairs
called for a special panel of six Republican and six Democratic
senators to hear evidence.
   Under a two-step procedure recommended by the Rules Committee,
the full Senate would first rule upon motions by Hastings and his
attorneys for dismissal of charges that the 52-year-old Florida
jurist plotted to get a $150,000 payoff. Ford said the Senate could
act within 30 days.
   The special committee appointed by Senate leaders then would hear
perhaps six weeks of evidence in the case, with television cameras
on hand and proceedings being taped for viewing at leisure by other
senators.
   The Rules Committee approved the blueprint on a 9-0 vote.
   It would not be the the first judicial impeachment trial on
television. Hearings in the case of impeached U.S. District Judge
Harry E. Claiborne of Nevada were carried two years ago.
   The Rules Committee left in up to the special panel whether the
current one also would be broadcast nationwide or merely to Senate
offices.
   Hastings, who was not on hand for the committee meeting, had
asked for evidence hearings before the full Senate.
   Short of that, he had sought to have the evidence hearings taped,
saying that senators should see the demeanor of the witnesses.
   ``The video will give us an opportunity to accommodate Judge
Hastings in his request that we watch the demeanor of the
witnesses,'' Ford told the Rules Committee. He told reporters
afterward, however, that lawmakers would watch only ``if they want
to.''
   Hastings was acquitted in 1983 of charges that he plotted with a
Washington attorney to obtain $150,000 in return for assuring that
two convicted racketeers would not serve time.
   Other judges, however, brought the evidence to the attention of
the House, which on Aug. 8 voted 413-3 to approve a bill of
impeachment.
   Hastings maintains he is innocent and says the allegations
represent an attempt to oust him for political reasons.
   The bill of impeachment says Hastings plotted to get the payoff,
made false statements at his trial and, in an unrelated matter,
disclosed secret wiretap information, wrecking a federal
investigation in the process.
   Empaneling a special committee to hear the evidence is not new.
The procedure was used for the first time in the 1986 impeachment
trial of Claiborne, who sought in vain to hang onto his robes even
though he was already in prison for tax evasion.
   The idea of a special committee goes back to the 1930s, when
lawmakers themselves said they were appalled by a ``dreary,
protracted and involved'' impeachment trial on the Senate floor in
which evidence was sometimes presented to a chamber that was all but
empty.
   Hastings told reporters on Jan. 26, however, that the issue was
far too important to be shunted into a committee.
   ``This is not an agriculture bill,'' he said. ``This is my office
that is at stake here.''

<HEAD>Police Break Up Demonstration After Double Killing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police using tear gas broke up a
confrontation between rival political supporters after two women
were shot to death in what appeared to be politically motivated
killings.
   The trouble broke out Wednesday afternoon in Spanish Town, 15
miles southwest of the capital of Kingston, following separate
killings of two women working for opposing parties in the Feb. 9
election campaign.
   Police said Rosalee Diana Dixon, 29, was gunned down while
drinking beer with friends under a tree shortly before midnight
Tuesday and that Ina Green, 45, was killed by gunmen who broke into
her home before dawn Wednesday.
   Ms. Dixon was a campaign worker for Prime Minister Edward Seaga's
Jamaica Labor Party and Ms. Green was an election agent for Michael
Manley's People's National Party, party officials said.
   Rival supporters later massed in Spanish Town, the centuries-old
former Jamaican capital, and skirmishes broke out. Police dispersed
the crowd with tear gas, and no injuries were reported. Stores and
schools closed early because of fears of disturbances.
   The shootings raised to at least six the number of people
reported killed in politically related killings since Seaga formally
launched the campaign Jan. 15 by announcing an election date.
   It is the first nationally contested election since 1980, when
700 people were killed in political violence over a nine-month
campaign.

   A 310-pound man was arrested and charged in
the death of his 14-month-old son, who police say was smothered
while his father slept in the same bed with him.
   Franklin H. Strause, 23, was arraigned Wednesday in Reading
District Court on charges of criminal homicide, involuntary
manslaughter, unlawful restraint, aggravated assault, recklessly
endangering another person, and endangering the welfare of a child.
   Strause, who was held in lieu of $500,000 bail, was brought to
the arraignment from a substance abuse treatment center where he had
spent the past 28 days, officials said.
   Documents filed by Criminal Investigator Anthony T. Manzolillo
said Strause admitted to police he had smoked cocaine for three days
before going to sleep for 12 hours on Dec. 23.
   Strause told investigators he awoke to find his son, Zachary,
lying face down and immobile. He removed Zachary to a kitchen table
and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but could not revive
the child, police said.
   An autopsy found Zachary died of asphyxiation by smothering.
Police documents did not indicate exactly how the child was
smothered.
   Caseworkers with Berks County Children and Youth Services had
told Strause in recent months to stop sleeping in the same bed with
the child, court records said.
   Strause, who is separated from his wife, is 6 feet 4{ inches tall
and weighs 310 pounds.
   Witnesses told authorities that at various times they had seen
Strause tie Zachary down, place a pillow over his head when he was
crying and strike him.
   Police found a blanket and cord on Strause's bed following the
death, indicating he had continued to tie the child down when he
went to sleep, Manzolillo said.

<HEAD>EDs: Top 9 grafs new to update with committee's approval of Kemp
and Boskin nominations; picks up 8th graf pvs, Gottlieb said.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Banking Committee today approved the
nomination as housing secretary of former Rep. Jack Kemp, who has
agreed to give up more than $55,000 in speaking fees after being
told he apparently violated limits on outside income for members of
Congress.
   Kemp's nomination by President Bush to become secretary of
housing and urban development was approved unanimously by the
committee and sent to the Senate floor for confirmation.
   The committee also unanimously approved and sent to the Senate
Bush's nomination of Michael J. Boskin to be chairman of the Council
of Economic Advisers.
   Kemp filed financial disclosure forms last week with the
committee and the federal Office of Government Ethics reporting
honoraria amounting to $67,350 above what House rules allow.
   The Associated Press learned Wednesday that the staff director of
the Democratic-controlled committee, Kevin Gottlieb, confronted Kemp
personally last week with the apparent violation.
   The former congressman from Buffalo, N.Y., agreed to return
$16,000 in speaking fees and to forgo another $39,400 in fees not
yet received.
   He also deferred receipt of an additional $12,500 in fees earned
in 1988 until 1989 to avoid violating the limits on honoraria
congressmen can receive in any one year. The actions brought Kemp
$550 below his 1988 limit.
   A spokeswoman for Kemp, Mary Brunette, described the problems as
``just a misunderstanding.''
   Gottlieb said today that no objections were raised by Senate
committee members because Kemp moved quickly to correct the problems
and cooperated fully.
   Gottlieb said the former congressman mistakenly believed that
money received after leaving Congress was not covered by the House
limits, even though it was for appearances made while a member of
Congress.
   Kemp filed an amended financial report with the Senate Banking,
Housing and Urban Affairs Committee and the U.S. Office of
Government Ethics on Monday to reflect the changes. The changes were
made without public disclosure by either Kemp or the Senate
committee.
   Kemp's aide and the committee acknowledged the changes in
response to questions from the AP, which identified the problem in a
review of Kemp's financial statements.
   Kemp was subject to the House rules limiting all outside income,
including honoraria, to 30 percent of his $89,500 congressional
salary _ or $26,850. In addition, a less restrictive federal statute
limits honoraria to 40 percent of congressional salary, or $35,800.
   In his original filing, Kemp reported receiving $119,000 in
honoraria for 1988. He also reported giving $24,800 of the money to
charity, which under House rules is not counted against the limit.
   House rules also limit honoraria _ fees for speeches or similar
appearances _ to no more than $2,000 per event. In his original
filing, Kemp reported several well in excess of that $2,000 limit.
   He reported receiving $30,000 for two appearances on the
television show ``Firing Line'' in September and October, and
$10,000 each for speeches to Hartford University, A.B. Laffer and
Associates, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He also reported
receiving $5,000 from World Trade Assoc., and $2,400 from Crosby
Assoc.
   Gottlieb said Kemp told him he believed the limits did not apply
because he was leaving Congress and would not receive the checks
until after he was out of office.
   ``Well, clearly the limit does apply, and when it was pointed out
to him that it does, he turned around and made the appropriate
adjustment,'' Gottlieb said.
   Gottlieb said Kemp agreed to return $8,000 each to Hartford
University and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   He agreed to reduce his ``Firing Line'' fee, which had not yet
been received, to $2,000 per appearance, or $4,000 total. He also
agreed to reduce the fees for World Trade and Laffer to $2,000 each
and to forgo altogether the Crosby fee, Brunette said.
   Because the remaining total still would have exceeded the overall
House limit on honoraria, Kemp shifted fees totaling $12,500 to 1989
_ when he said he actually received or will receive them, according
to both Gottlieb and Brunette. That gave him a 1988 honoraria total
of just over $26,000 and within the limit.
   Gottlieb said that after consulting with staff of the House
ethics committee he decided House rules permitted honoraria to be
counted in the year actually received, even though earned in a
different year.
   The manual for House members published by the ethics committee
states that honoraria may be counted in the year in which they are
received. But it also contains another sentence that raises
questions about whether this is permitted if the object is to
circumvent the limit.
   ``A member may therefore not earn income and have it deferred to
another year or to when he leaves Congress to avoid the income
limitation,'' says the manual, titled ``Ethics manual for members,
officers and employees of the U.S. House of Representatives.''
   Transferring the excess to 1989 solves Kemp's problem if he is
judged to be subject to a limit that is 30 percent of a full year's
income _ which is Gottlieb's interpretation of the rules.
   House rules describe the limit as 30 percent of the aggregate
salary received during the year, which might give him a limit of
about $150, since he earned only about $500 as a member of Congress
for two days in 1989. Under this interpretation, the remainder would
have to be donated to charity.

   A fugitive arrested after being recognized as
a contestant on the TV game show ``Super Password'' filed a lawsuit
seeking to collect his $58,400 in winnings and an additional $1
million in damages.
   In a suit filed Friday in Superior Court, Kerry D. Ketchem said
the show and producer Mark Goodson Productions breached the
contestant's agreement by refusing to pay him.
   Ketchem, wanted for using fraudulently obtained credit cards to
spend $25,000 and purchase a BMW with fraudulently obtained funds,
appeared on the show using the name Patrick Quinn. He was arrested
Jan. 14, 1988, when he arrived to claim his winnings.
   Ketchem, of San Bernardino, was sentenced in August to four years
in prison after pleading guilty to one count of bank fraud.
``Password'' officials have refused to pay him, saying he violated
the agreement by falsifying his name.
   But Ketchem's complaint charges the defendants' actions ``were
extreme, outrageous and oppressive in that the plaintiff had
complied (with) each and every rule set forth in the agreement.''

lower casualty toll.
   He said nine people were found dead at the scene, three died of
injuries at a Chittagong hospital, and another person died en route
to the hospital.
   The train derailed near Kumira, 15 miles north of Chittagong. It
was bound for Dhaka, 135 miles southeast of Chittagong.
   The cause of the derailment was not known.

   The bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over
Scotland was planted by Palestinian terrorists in the luggage of a
CIA agent, a radio station said today.
   David Johnson, head of the news department at Radio Forth in
Edinburgh, reported the CIA officer was returning from Beirut with
five colleagues after a mission to negotiate release of the nine
American hostages in Lebanon.
   Investigators In Lockerbie, Scotland, where the investigation
into the Dec. 21 disaster is headquartered, refused comment on the
report, which cited information from unidentified Scottish police
sources.
   In December, U.S. officials in Washington, speaking on condition
of anonymity, told The Associated Press the CIA's chief in Beirut
was among the jet's passengers. They did not give the agent's name.
   At that time, the FBI's executive assistant director, Oliver
Revell, denied the agent was on the jet.
   Radio Forth did not name the agent it said was on the jet. It
said investigators believe a three-pound charge of Semtex explosive
and a timing device were slipped into the agent's luggage by
Palestinian terrorists who infiltrated the secret Beirut mission.
   It speculated the perpetrators belonged to Ahmed Jibril's Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. Jibril has
been accused in the past of involvement in the bombing and has
denied it.
   On Wednesday night, CBS News said Jibril was the principal
architect of the bombing. It said Jibril, based in Syria, was
working for Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi but was required to clear
the operation with Syrian intelligence officials.
   Last month, the Hamburg newspaper Bild reported Jibril's
organization was involved in the bombing.
   CBS quoted Jibril spokesman Omar Shehabi as saying, ``I tell you
that we didn't do it and we are not involved. We don't practice
terrorism and we condemn such actions.''
   In Frankfurt, West Germany, one of the stops on the flight,
prosecutor's spokesman Jochen Schroers said the report of Syrian and
Libyan involvement was ``just speculation.''
   The Radio Forth report quoted sources as saying the bomb was
placed in luggage that also carried ``quite sensitive documents.''
   It said the baggage was shipped from Beirut via Helsinki to
Frankfurt, where the agents caught the flight for New York. The
timer was believed to have been activated during the stop in
Helsinki, the report said.
   All 259 people on board the jet were killed when it exploded in
the sky over Scotland. Eleven people on the ground in Lockerbie also
died. Investigators have concluded a bomb was to blame.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is unlikely to
grant the Rev. Jesse Jackson's request that Thornburgh help free two
imprisoned former Maryland legislators while they appeal criminal
convictions, Justice Department sources said today.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was
extremely unlikely that Thornburgh would intervene to overturn a
judge's ruling on a criminal conviction.
   Jackson hand-delivered a letter to Thornburgh last week that
pleaded for the release of former state Sens. Clarence M. Mitchell
III and Michael B. Mitchell while they appeal 2{-year prison terms
for trying to obstruct a congressional investigation of the Wedtech
scandal.
   ``The attorney general said that he would take a look at the
situation,'' department spokesman Loye Miller said, confirming a
report published in today's editions of The Baltimore Sun that
Jackson had appealed to Thornburgh for help.
   The department sources noted that the trial judge's decision to
deny the Mitchell brothers bail pending appeal was upheld by Chief
Justice William Rehnquist, who handles emergency appeals from
federal courts in Maryland.
   In the letter, Jackson said freedom was ``imperative'' for the
Mtchells, who are nephews of former Rep. Parren Mitchell, D-Md. The
Mitchells are the sons of the late Clarence Mitchell II, who was a
nationally respected civil rights lawyer.
   ``I have agreed to assume a leadership role in the effort to
bring national attention to ensure justice in this important case,''
Jackson wrote in the letter to Thornburgh.
   He said a federal judge's denial of the Mitchells' request for
release was ``unprecedented.''
   Jackson's letter does not directly address racial issues. But
after his meeting with Thornburgh last week, Jackson complained to
reporters that several white defendants convicted in the Wedtech
scandal, including former Rep. Mario Biaggo, D-N.Y., remained free
on bail while the Mitchells, who are black, were ordered to jail.
   The two are serving prison terms at the Lewisburg Federal Prison
Camp in Lewisburg, Pa., for their November 1987 convictions on
federal fraud and obstruction charges.
   During their trial, prosecutors presented evidence they collected
$50,000 from the Wedtech Corp., a New York-based defense contractor,
to help block an investigation of the firm by the House Committee on
Small Business, then chaired by their uncle.

   Carlos Andres Perez was sworn in as
president today before dozens of dignitaries, including Vice
President Dan Quayle and Cuban leader Fidel Castro, and promised to
work for peace in Central America and a solution to the Latin
American debt crisis.
   Perez, 67, who won a second presidential term 10 years after his
first term ended, took office amid a stand-off between the United
States and Latin America on the region's $440 billion foreign debt.
   He is Venezuela's seventh president in 30 years of democracy and
the first to be re-elected. In his first act as president, Perez
appointed his 22-member Cabinet, state governors and other key
government officials.
   The president has left no doubts he will work ceaselessly for a
Latin American common stand against creditors. He has given top
priority to Venezuela's $33 billion foreign debt.
   It is a different Venezuela than the one Perez governed from 1974
to 1979, when the oil-producing nation was awash in oil revenues.
   In a speech Wednesday to the Latin American Economic System, a
regional organization, Perez called on Latin American nations to
``unite our fears and face together the presidents of the United
States, Western Europe and Japan's prime minister'' in debt
discussions.
   More than 20 chiefs of state and government attended the
inauguration, including Brazilian President Jose Sarney, whose
country is the Third World's largest debtor. Perez conferred with
all of them in a series of marathon talks that concentrated on debt
and the Central American situation.
   All the Central American presidents were in Venezuela for the
inauguration except Jose Napeoleon Duarte of El Salvador, who has
cancer.
   Castro's visit was part of Perez's announced intention of
bringing Cuba back into Latin America diplomacy in hopes it will
contribute to peace efforts in Central America. Castro's last visit
to Venezuela was in 1959.
   Quayle, who came to Caracas on Wednesday on his first foreign
policy mission, met with Perez later that day. Quayle rejected the
idea of a Latin debtors' cartel and said the United States would
oppose a move toward one.
   Perez pressed for more U.S. flexibility on the issue, and Quayle
promised to relay the request to Washington, said a Quayle aide,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Perez also is expected to play a key role in efforts to develop a
regional peace plan.
   Nicaraguan Contra leader Alfredo Cesar told reporters Wednesday
he sees Perez as the main leader for resolving the Nicaraguan
conflict.
   Perez supported the Sandinista overthrow of Nicaraguan dictator
Anastasio Somoza in 1979, but he now has joined other critics of the
leftist regime's curtailment of individual freedoms.

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright, moving to limit
political damage from a proposed 50 percent congressional pay raise,
said today the House would vote next week on cutting the increase to
30 percent.
   Wright said the House would also vote on banning members from
receiving speaking fees and other honoraria. Because House members
currently can retain up to 30 percent of salary in honoraria, those
receiving the maximum would receive no actual raise.
   ``The House will vote next week to ban all honorariums and to cut
the pay raise to 30 percent instead of 50 percent. That'll make it
just come out even,'' Wright told reporters.
   A 30 percent raise would hike the current congressional salary by
$26,850, to a total of $116,350.
   A Democratic leadership aide, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity, said Wright planned for the vote to take place after the
raise would become law next Wednesday. This would roll back the
increase for lawmakers and executive branch officials, but not for
judges, whose salary cannot be reduced under the Constitution.
   The Senate planned to vote today or Friday, and was virtually
certain to turn down the 50 percent raise, which would boost most
congressional salaries from $89,500 to $135,000.
   Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill. who has met with Wright and
plans further meetings, ``has not signed off on the 30 percent pay
raise proposal nor the idea of a vote the following day,'' said
Johanna Schneider, Michael's spokeswoman.
   Wright said ``of course there's always a chance'' that his
proposal would be defeated. But he said he was encouraged by answers
given by 326 House members to a survey he conducted this week on the
pay raise.
   Without announcing the results, Wright said:
   ``They indicate that the members feel that they should give up
the honororia and they should substitute a straightforward, upfront
way in which they would receive and all other people in the
government would receive a decent raise, but not an exorbitant
raise, and that they ought to vote to do it. I think it's upbeat.''
   Wright has tried to convince his colleagues for weeks to reduce
the raise to 30 percent but told reporters previously the members
were privately telling him they wanted 50 percent without a vote.
The raise becomes law unless both houses of Congress vote to stop it.
   Wright appeared to be going along with these private sentiments
until he abruptly reversed course this week and ordered the survey.
Aides said the speaker was tired of reading that he was stopping the
will of a majority to vote on the raise.
   An Associated Press informal survey of nearly a third of the
435-member House showed about 88 percent of those responding wanted
a vote on the larger package.
   Groups opposed to the increase said their own survey showed that
slightly more than 60 percent would vote ``no.''
   Meanwhile, House and Senate negotiators moved ahead Wednesday
with separate but similar proposals to bar speaking fees and
restrict other outside income should the raise become law.
   A bipartisan draft document, given to senators and obtained by
The Associated Press, compared the latest House and Senate proposals
on outside income.
   Both packages would ban honoraria, including fees for speeches,
appearances and articles, upon enactment of the raise.
   Leaders in both houses have made clear that honoraria would
continue if the pay raise is defeated because members don't want to
suffer a loss of income. House members currently can retain $26,850
and Senate members $35,800 in honoraria.
   The Senate plan includes a contingency that would permit
retention of some honoraria if the raise is partially scaled back
later.
   The plans under discussion in both houses would permit such fees
to be donated to charity on a member's behalf. The Senate plan would
limit the donation to $2,000 per appearance and require members to
list on financial disclosure forms the amount, the payer and the
recipient of the donation.
   Wright did not get full cooperation from his colleagues in his
survey. House Republican Whip Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., told his hometown
paper, the Casper Star-Tribune: ``I didn't return the form. I don't
do polls.''
   The Associated Press contacted 143 congressional offices and
found 92 members publicly supporting a recorded vote on the pay
raise. Only six said they were against it and seven were undecided.
There was no response from 38 offices.
   The survey released Wednesday by raise opponents, indicating 62
percent of House members opposed to the increase, was conducted by
Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader,
and two conservative groups: the National Taxpayers Union and
Coalitions for America.
   The proposed honoraria plans would allow groups that invite
members to an event to continue paying for travel. The Senate would
direct its ethics committee to issue rules and regulations defining
acceptable limits.
   The House draft would prohibit members from receiving any pension
benefits from honoraria given as a charitable donation. The Senate
plan would go further, prohibiting conversion of any of the
donations to a member's personal use.
   The House plan would limit all outside earned income to 15
percent of a member's salary, half the current 30 percent.
   The House also would end a provision in federal law that has
allowed 190 House members, in office before 1980, to accumulate $39
million in campaign funds that could be converted to personal use.
The measure would become effective in January 1991, giving House
members one chance to retire with the money. The Senate already has
a rule prohibiting such conversion.

   An elementary school principal has been charged in
the paddling of a special education student, and police are
investigating whether school district officials were remiss in
failing to report it.
   Charles R. Taylor, 48, was charged Tuesday with injury to a child
in the May 23, 1988, beating of a 13-year-old boy who was described
as emotionally disturbed, police said.
   Taylor, who did not answer telephone calls to his home this
morning seeking comment, was suspended from his job Wednesday.
   Police said they knew nothing of the incident until state
investigators contacted them six months later. ``The investigation
is ongoing and will probably involve a grand jury,'' said police
Sgt. Bill Staney.
   The boy was hit about the arms, back and head in the principal's
office, where he was called after being involved in a shoving match
with another student, Staney said.
   ``The boy was sitting in a chair and the principal told him to
get down and bend over,'' Staney said. ``The boy started crying,
saying he did not want to get hit.''
   At one point, Taylor pinned the youth's head between his legs and
struck him once on the head with the paddle, Staney said. The boy's
hand also was cut during the beating, which was witnessed by several
people.
   The principal noticed the bleeding hand, took the boy to the
school nurse's office and bandaged the hand himself because no one
was on duty there, police said. The parents told investigators their
son also later underwent an X-ray to check for head injuries.
   One of those witnesses eventually became frustrated at school
officials' lack of progress in an internal investigation and
contacted the state attorney general's office, which contacted
police because the district was uncooperative, Staney said.
   Larry Yawn, a spokesman for the Houston Independent School
District, said he is unaware of any failure to cooperate with
authorities in the investigation.

   The judge in Oliver L. North's Iran-Contra
trial added two more people to a pool of prospective jurors today,
while rejecting two others, including a woman who said she recalled
seeing the former White House aide on television when he gave
immunized testimony to Congress.
   A woman who worked for the Navy for 21 years and a clerk typist
at the Labor Department were sent into the jury pool, which now has
18 people out of a group that U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell
wants to build to 50 by the end of the week.
   Prospective jurors have been instructed not to read, watch or
listen to anything about the case.
   The former Navy employee, now a secretary, said she ``didn't even
turn the television'' on when she went home Wednesday night
``because if I had I would have had to tell a lie. I don't want to
go to jail.''
   The woman said her main source of news was talking to other
people and that her husband thought North was ``somehow messing
up.'' She said she thought North's activities involved ``something
about weapons ... selling weapons to the overseas people.''
   The clerk typist, a woman in her 20s, said she had heard ``teenie
bits'' of North's 1987 congressional testimony in news broadcasts,
but that ``I did not pay attention. I saw it and turned the
channel.'' North attorney Barry Simon said the woman should not be
included as a juror because ``she saw North's testimony,'' but
Gesell said the woman heard it ``only enough time to turn it off.''
   Rejected for the pool was a contracts supervisor at the
government's General Services Administration, who said she recalled
that North had been involved in sending ``some guns to another
country,'' although she could not remember the country.
   The GSA employee also said she recalled something about North
``lying to the committee. I just heard that vaguely.''
   Five of the criminal counts against North charge that he
obstructed and made false statements to congressional panels in 1985
and 1986 by denying he was assisting the Contra rebels fighting the
leftist government of Nicaragua at a time when U.S. military aid to
the Contras had been banned.
   The prospective juror said she wasn't interested in North's 1987
testimony, but ``I saw him on TV.''
   Also rejected for the pool was a man who said ``I do not know
that much about'' the North case, but didn't think he could be a
fair and impartial juror.
   Gesell had said Wednesday he wants to start picking a jury Monday
after rounding up a pool of 50 prospective panelists before the
weekend.
   So far, 18 people have been identified who remained largely
unexposed to North's nationally televised congressional testimony in
1987. In that testimony, the fired White House aide discussed many
activities for which he now faces criminal charges.
   North was granted immunity from prosecution for that testimony.
   North's lawyers say any exposure whatsoever to that testimony
would violate their client's Fifth Amendment rights against
self-incrimination. The office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh
was required to gather information for the criminal charges
independently of any congressionally immunized testimony.
   On Wednesday, Gesell sent nine people into the pool of
prospective jurors, saying ``I think it has gone very well so far.''
Seven prospective jurors were identified on Tuesday after the trial
opened.
   Gesell said he hopes to pick a pool of 50 by Friday, have the
prosecution and defense prepare for in-depth questioning and ``move
for jury selection Monday.''
   Gesell has been calling into court for initial questioning only
those people who say they didn't see, read or listen to North's
congressional testimony in 1987.
   Even with those restrictions, North's lawyers objected to almost
all the 16 who were sent into the jury pool, on the grounds that
they had been exposed to news accounts of North's 1987 testimony.
   North faces 12 criminal charges.
   He is accused of lying to Congress in 1985 and 1986 about his
efforts on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras and of lying to the
attorney general the about the National Security Council's role in
diverting money from the Iran arms sales to the Contras.
   He also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 security
system at his home from co-defendant Richard Secord, converting to
his own use at least $4,300 in traveler's checks from Contra leader
Adolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenue
by using a tax-exempt foundation to funnel money to the Contras.

   U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens apparently offered
a government job to a woman after she asked him why he was ``messin'
around'' with her teen-age daughter, according to a videotape of the
confrontation.
   The 57-year-old divorced congressman also replied, ``I didn't
really know she was a teen-ager,'' according to the videotape
broadcast Wednesday night by WSYX-TV.
   The case has been investigated by Columbus police and turned over
to the Franklin County prosecutor's office and the FBI. The FBI said
Wednesday it found no evidence that the congressman from Middletown
tried to bribe Anna Coffman, who said her daughter was 13 years old
when the girl met Lukens four years ago.
   WSYX-TV said it secretly videotaped the Nov. 11 meeting between
Lukens and and Ms. Coffman at a fast-food restaurant in Columbus.
   At the meeting, according to the videotape, Ms. Coffman told
Lukens: ``I'm a curious mother and I'm concerned, you know, about my
daughter and her, you know, her welfare. ...
   ``I couldn't understand a man in your position, you know, why
you're messin' around with these teen-agers. ...''
   Lukens replied: ``Well, first of all, I didn't really know she
was a teen-ager. I didn't know that, no. I do now, of course.''
   At the end of the conversation, according to the videotape,
Lukens seems to have offered to find Ms. Coffman a government job.
   ``Let me go back (to Washington) and see what there is part-time
and ... (inaudible). ... I don't know what, uh, the government has,
but I can check and find out. And, uh, I'll give you a ring later
today. It may be later today if I find out,'' Lukens said.
   Calls by The Associated Press to Lukens' residence and office in
Washington, and to his home in Ohio, were not answered Wednesday
evening. He declined to comment on Tuesday after WBNS-TV broke the
story.
   His Washington office said today the Republican congressman had
been advised by his lawyer not to comment on the case.
   The girl, who is now 17, said that in 1985, a friend brought her
to Lukens' penthouse apartment in Columbus, according to WSYX, which
said she was able to accurately describe the inside of the
apartment. Lukens was a state Senator at the time.
   ``They took me in this room, and she said get undressed and put
on this robe, and I told her that, you know, I wasn't going to do
nothing, because I was scared,'' she told the station. ``And then
she said, `He just want to see your body.' ...
   ``And then they started having sex, and then he told her to get
up. And then he, like, pulled me on top of him and started having
sex with me,'' WSYX quoted the girl as saying.
   She said Lukens later paid both girls and gave them a business
card, the station reported.
   She also said that three years later she and a friend went back
to the apartment, and that Lukens encouraged the girls to have sex
with each other. The girl said she refused, but that she then had
sex with Lukens and again was given money, the station reported.
   ``I was so angry, and I wanted to cuss him out, and get in
contact with some people to get this guy away from my daughter and
other young people,'' Ms. Coffman said.
   Lukens was first elected to Congress in 1966 and served two
terms. He lost a bid for governor in the Republican primary in 1970.
   He was appointed to the state Senate in 1971 and was elected in
1976. In 1974, he fought allegations that he accepted $1,000 in
campaign contributions from Korean businessman Tongsun Park during
his first stint on Capitol Hill.
   Lukens returned to Congress in 1986.

   Britain's Princess Diana, arriving for a
whirlwind tour, charmed America's fashion elite at a glittering
reception and today chatted with formerly homeless women at a
community center.
   Hundreds of residents of a housing project lined the streets as
the princess' motorcade pulled up to the Henry Street Settlement, a
96-year-old community center that helps immigrants, homeless people
and the elderly.
   Halfway through her visit to the settlement, the princess,
wearing a black skirt and black-and-pink top, emerged from a
building and strolled by crowds, waving and talking to some lucky
residents.
   Inside, she spoke with seven women who were once homeless, but
had acquired apartments with the help of the settlement on
Manhattan's lower East Side.
   ``Her visit does matter,'' said Theather Mitchell, 33, a mother
of four. ``She's royalty and she'll bring attention to the homeless.
She'll help the people realize the problems of the homeless.''
   The princess was met at the settlement by Matilda Cuomo, wife of
Gov. Mario Cuomo, then talked for nearly an hour with the
once-homeless women.
   Residents of a housing project, the Baruch Houses, had cheered
her arrival at the settlement.
   ``It's nice that she came. They cleaned up the place,'' said
Efrain Gonzales, a maintenance man who leaned out a window to get a
glimpse. ``She should come more often. It was very dirty. It was the
pits before.''
   On Wednesday night, awed fashion designers and retailers
proclaimed Diana radiant and divine when she appeared at a party in
her honor.
   The 27-year-old princess, who had just arrived on her first
official visit to New York, sounded equally impressed by her host
city.
   ``It was marvelous, quite dramatic,'' she said when asked her
first impressions of the city.
   Tonight she was to attend the American debut of the Welsh
National Opera, which will perform Verdi's ``Falstaff'' at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music. As the Princess of Wales, she is patron
of the opera company.
   Irish-American activists opposed to British involvement in
Northern Ireland planned to demonstrate outside the opera
performance. But Diana's first evening in the city was devoid of
controversy.
   The princess arrived on a British Airways supersonic Concorde
flight at Kennedy International Airport at 5:49 p.m. Wednesday for
her three-day visit. Her first public appearance was on the 50th
floor of the Equitable Tower, where she attended a gala reception
and buffet dinner hosted by Dawson International, producers of
Scottish cashmere.
   Before she arrived, guests received some last minute instructions
from British Consul George Finlayson. ``For British subjects it's
protocol for the men to nod and the women can curtsy,'' he said.
``For Americans, ever since the War of Independence, you can do what
you want.''
   Many of the guests opted to shake hands.
   The princess arrived wearing a gathered blue satin tunic over a
black wool skirt with pearls at her neck.
   ``She looks divine!'' exclaimed Jack Schultz, chief executive
officer of B. Altman's department store. ``She looks great in that
color.''
   Designer Oscar de la Renta went further. ``She has extraordinary
looks and when you have extraordinary looks you can wear anything,''
he said. ``With time, she will be one of the great well-dressed
ladies of the world.''
   For Schultz, the gathering was bittersweet. His son, Thomas
Schultz, was among a group of Syracuse University students who died
in the December crash of a Pan Am jet in Scotland.
   When it came his turn to greet Diana, Schultz pulled out a
picture of his son and showed the princess.
   She was ``very sympathetic,'' said Irwin Joffe, president of
Dawson International USA, who observed the exchange. ``She said,
`I'm very sorry. He would not have felt anything.' She dealt with it
extremely well.''
   This week's tour is the first lone official visit abroad by Diana
since October 1985, when she went to the Royal Hampshire Regiment's
base in Berlin.
   The princess visited the White House during a U.S. tour in 1985
with her husband, Prince Charles, who remained in Britain this week.
He will arrive in the United States on Feb. 16 for a four-day visit
to Washington and Palm Beach, Fla.

<TEXT>
   U.S. officials said Thursday they are
still planning this year's joint military exercises with South Korea
despite North Korean protests. North Korea said the maneuvers have
already begun.
   North Korea has called for eliminating the exercises as a
precondition for continuing a peace dialogue with Seoul, but it made
no mention Thursday of cancelling upcoming talks.
   The U.S. command in Seoul played down the exercises. It refused
to confirm this year's maneuvers would be held but acknowledged that
U.S. and South Korean officers ``began planning on the training many
months ago'' and that ``planning continues.''
   South Korean Defense Minister Lee Sang-hoon said on state
television Wednesday that the ``Team Spirit'' exercises will be
carried out as planned.
   He said, however, that U.S. and South Korean officials may
consider adjusting the scale and format of future exercises if North
Korea shows a ``concrete change of attitude'' toward Seoul. He did
not elaborate.
   The exercises have been conducted annually since 1976 to test the
joint command of U.S. and South Korean forces in the event of a
North Korean invasion. The maneuvers usually begin in early February
and end in mid-April.
   Announcement of past exercises were made well before the
maneuvers began. This year, however, South Korea asked the United
States to delay a formal announcement until later this month to help
promote its dialogue with North Korea.
   North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency, monitored in
Tokyo, said Thursday the United States and South Korea ``committed a
never-to-be condoned crime'' in starting the exercises as the North
Korea-South Korea talks approach.
   It said preliminary talks for high-level political and military
discussions were scheduled for Feb. 8, and legislators were to meet
Feb. 10 to prepare for a large-scale parliamentary meeting.
   The agency said the exercise ``clearly proves once again that the
U.S. imperialists and their stooges do not want peace and peaceful
reunification of Korea and have not yet awakened from an
anachronistic dream to invade the North.''

   The interior minister says it's a

he has ordered a study to find out why.
   The feeble representation of women among the nation's mayors
``shows that in our democratic system, one can hardly speak of
emancipation,'' said Interior Minister Louis Tobback.
   He announced earlier this week the approval of the nominations of
502 mayors. Of these, 20 are women, or just under 4 percent.
   Belgian mayors are not elected directly but nominated by the
parties that win local elections. The nominations must be approved
by Tobback.

   A court allowed authorities Thursday to
continue holding a suspect in the 1986 killing of Prime Minister
Olof Palme, a news report said.
   It was the third extension of custody for Christer Pettersson,
41. He was arrested Dec. 14 after a nearly three-year manhunt for
Palme's killer.
   Palme was slain as he walked home from a movie theater with his
wife in central Stockholm.
   The court gave the prosecution two more weeks to file charges
against Pettersson. However, Hans Olvebro, the detective in charge
of the investigation, told the national TT news agency that he
believed more time will be needed.
   Olvebro also said he had asked Interpol, an international police
agency, to help find a foreign resident who may have witnessed the
killing. He gave no details.

   The JAS 39 Gripen, designed by a Swedish consortium as a future

   Three more dead sea lions have

loss to say what has killed at least 24 of the animals in two weeks.
   The three sea lions washed up Wednesday in Huntington Beach,

   Cordaro dismissed the idea that sharks could have killed the sea
lions.
   ``If the sea lions had been attacked by sharks, you'd see whole

said. ``I'm inclined to rule out any kind of predator attacks.''

<TEXT>
   New home sales edged up a meager 0.9 percent
last year, the government said Thursday in a report analysts cited
as evidence that higher mortgage interest rates continue to dampen
activity in the housing market.
   Sales for all of 1988 totaled 677,000 dwellings, up from 671,000
sold during the previous year, the Commerce Department reported.
Home sales had plunged 10.5 percent in 1987, with the drop blamed on
rising interest rates and a slowdown in demand after five strong
sales years.
   Analysts said they expected continued increases in interest rates
and a slowdown in the economy to result in a modest decrease in new
home sales this year.
   ``The bottom's not falling out of the market by any means but we
do expect a modest slowing,'' said economist Richard Peach of the
Mortgage Bankers Association.
   Fixed-rate mortgages last week stood at 10.6 percent, up from
10.16 percent a year earlier, according to a survey by the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Many economists are predicting interest
rates could hit 11.5 percent by the middle of this year.
   Last year's new home sales ended with a slight upturn, as sales
for December rose 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 669,000 after dropping 7.9 percent during the previous month.
   All of December's strength came from the Northeast, where sales
rose a surprising 52.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 104,000. Sales were down 22.1 percent in the Midwest, 2 percent
in the South and 1.3 percent in the West.
   However, for the year overall, the Northeast was the only region
to post a decline, with sales down 13.7 percent to 101,000. Sales
were up 9.7 percent in the West, 1.1 percent in the South and 1
percent in the Midwest.
   Analysts were puzzled by the December surge in the Northeast,
saying it might be due to unusually mild weather and difficulties
with seasonal adjustments during the winter months.
   ``The Northeast clearly is fundamentally a weakening part of the
country, with the West probably still, on balance, a strengthening
part of the country,'' said David Seiders, chief economist for the
National Association of Home Builders.
   Analysts said the slackening in the Northeast was coming on the
heels of several years in which a sales boom resulted in
overbuilding and drove up prices. Figures for the West, meanwhile,
have been dominated by strength in California, where the healthy
economy and a fear of future restrictions on development are
spurring sales.
   ``People are trying to buy now and get in now, and builders are
doing the same thing, in hopes that they won't be curtailed by
slow-growth or no-growth initiatives,'' Peach said.
   Nationwide, the median price of a new home rose 9.7 percent in
December to $121,000, meaning half the homes sold for more and half
for less. The average price of a new home also was up, rising 11.1
percent to $152,200.
   Seiders said the December increase in prices was largely due to
the shift of sales to the more expensive Northeast rather than a
national trend toward a surging prices.
   For the year, the median price of a new home was $112,500, up 7.7
percent from a year earlier. The average price was $138,300, up 8.7
percent.

<HEAD>Shinto Priest Blesses First Boeing 747-400</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NARITA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the wave of a sacred evergreen branch
over an altar covered with vegetables, seaweed and dried squid, a
Shinto priest prayed Thursday for the safety of the first
high-technology Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet to enter commercial service.
   The white-robed priest competed with departure announcements
inside an airport lounge overlooking the new plane at Tokyo's Narita
Airport as he chanted prayers for the jet _ the latest version of
the Boeing 747 _ and for the prosperity of its owner, Northwest
Airlines.
   ``This is the most technologically sophisticated commercial
aircraft to enter the skies,'' said Allen Johnson, Northwest's vice
president for the Pacific. ``It will set the pace for commercial air
travel through the 1990s.''
   The plane, received by Northwest last week, is the first 747-400
to be delivered by Boeing and the first of 10 ordered by the
airline. It arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday on a test flight carrying
five Northwest pilots and four officials of the U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration.
   Following the blessing by the priest, who was hired by Northwest,
Johnson and other Northwest executives offered sacred boughs at the
altar and bowed and clapped twice, a standard prayer in Japan's
animist Shinto religion.
   Airlines have eagerly awaited the Boeing 747-400 _ distinctive
for its curved wingtips and extra-long upper deck _ because of its
reduced fuel consumption and two-member flight crews, compared with
the three-member crews needed on other 747s.
   But critics of the planes, including some pilots' unions, have
questioned the safety of the smaller crews, which do without a
flight engineer.
   ``I feel very confident that this plane will be as safe or safer
than the earlier 747s,'' said Capt. Dennis Boston, Northwest's
manager of flight standards for the 747-400.
   In the cockpit, multicolored video displays reminiscent of video
games replace many of the usual gauges. Sophisticated computers
monitor thousands of sensors throughout the airplane, and display
the plane's route and location and keep track of radio signals from
check points along the way.
   ``You might say we now have an electronic equivalent of a flight
engineer on the plane,'' said Joseph Ebli, Northwest's manager of
747-400 maintenance. ``It's like something that you saw in `Star
Wars' _ it's a military concept that is being introduced in
commercial planes.''
   Boeing's worldwide delivery of the planes has been delayed for
more than a month by bugs in the sophisticated computer software
that resulted in false computer messages, but the problems have been
solved, Boston said.
   ``I am very confident in the airplane. I think they've done an
excellent job,'' he said.
   Northwest plans to put the 747-400 into regular service in the
United States and between New York and Tokyo after its FAA-required
proving flights are completed, probably in the spring.
   Northwest's order of 10 planes, including spare parts, is valued
at about $2 billion.

<HEAD>Coast Guard: Expensive Rescue For Man Who Tried Ride To Cuba</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who tried to ride a jet ski to Cuba
to plant a U.S. flag as a publicity stunt was rescued in a combined
Navy-Coast Guard operation after nearly sinking 14 miles south of
Key West, rescuers said.
   Walter K. Vanderveer was picked off his foundering, one-person
motorized vessel by the Coast Guard on Wednesday then airlifted by
the Navy to Florida Keys Memorial Hospital, where he was treated for
hypothermia, Coast Guard Petty Officer Rex Wyers said.
   The three-hour rescue effort cost about $12,000 in Navy and Coast
Guard fuel and equipment costs, Wyers said.
   Vanderveer, 38, of Coral Gables, told his rescuers he had tried
to go to Cuba as a publicity stunt, Wyers said. Cuba's north coast
is about 90 miles south of Key West.
   ``Mr. Vanderveer had planned to jet ski across the Straits of
Florida and plant an American flag on the beaches of Cuba, and then
come back to the Keys,'' Wyers said.
   A Greek merchant ship told the Coast Guard it was in radio
contact with a distressed sailor describing his vessel as a
``disabled jet ski'' that was taking on water. Jet skis have
handlebars and are considered by some to be the equivalent of a
snowmobile for water. They are meant to be used in protected waters
and are not sea-worthy vessels.
   Vanderveer left the hospital late Wednesday, a spokesman said.
There is no telephone listing for him in the Miami-Coral Gables area.

   Federal investigators plan to look into
allegations that sheriff's deputies twice burned crosses on floors
of the jail where gang members are kept, the Los Angeles Times
reported Thursday.
   The FBI investigation into whether deputies violated the civil
rights of Crips and Bloods gang members would follow the Sheriff's
Department's investigation, the newspaper said.
   The allegations became public Jan. 6 when a deputy mentined them
while testifying in an unrelated hearing. Sheriff Sherman Block said
that hearing was the first time he had heard the allegations.
   ``If it did occur, who knew about it? Why didn't it make its way
up the chain of command as it should have?'' he said.
   Capt. Dick Walls, a sheriff's spokesman, said Wednesday the FBI
had not notified the sheriff's department of its reported intention
to investigate the allegations.
   ``We have our own internal investigation going of that alleged
incident,'' Walls said. ``And, until we have notification from the
FBI, then we're just going to continue our investigation, and we
won't have anything else to say until that has been completed.''

   Bernhard Goetz, the electronics engineer
convicted of a weapons charge in the shooting of four teen-agers on
a subway, is earning 50 cents an hour in jail fixing walkie-talkies
and radios.
   Goetz has been working since Jan. 26 in the radio shop at Rikers
Island Jail fixing the equipment from Correction Department cars and
buses.
   ``It's good to see the city taking advantage of this bargain,''
said Donald Cranston, president of the Correction Captains
Benevolent Association. ``Where else could you get a deal like this
for 50 cents an hour?''
   Ruby Ryles, a Correction Department spokeswoman, said Goetz's
assignment represents ``the first time in anybody's memory that an
inmate has worked in the radio shop.''
   ``The deputy warden to whom he reports says he's doing a very
good job,'' she said.
   Goetz was sentenced Jan. 13 to one year in prison for possessing
an unlicensed gun he used to shoot four young men he said he thought
were about to rob him on a subway. Assuming good behavior, and
giving him credit for the nine days he spent in jail after the
shooting, he would be eligible for parole March 5.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI is questioning officials at the
Morehouse University School of Medicine about Health and Human
Services Secretary-designate Louis Sullivan's connection to a former
Georgia official convicted of extortion.
   The FBI is inquiring about former Fulton County Commissioner
Reginald Eaves, who was involved in a financial conflict-of-interest
scandal at the Atlanta school, where Sullivan is president.
   Dr. James Goodman, executive vice president of the Morehouse
medical school, said the FBI ``talked to me about a range of issues
about Dr. Sullivan's fitness for the position (of HHS secretary),
including that (Eaves) and many other things.'' He declined to say
what other issues the FBI questioned him about.
   Meanwhile, Sullivan wants White House permission to maintain his
connection with the medical school while he serves the Bush
administration as secretary of health and human services, according
to published reports.
   The Washington Post and the Washington Times today quoted sources
as saying Sullivan requested that he be permitted to take a
sabbatical as president of the school, possibly with pay. Acting HHS
Secretary Donald M. Newman told a staff meeting Wednesday that
administration officials initially approved the request, but later
reversed themselves, the Post said.
   The Post said Morehouse sources understood the reversal ruled out
a paid sabbatical while Sullivan is at HHS, but not necessarily an
unpaid leave.
   White House counsel C. Boyden Gray told the Times that ``nothing
has been approved. The (White House) lawyers are looking into his
(Sullivan's) requests regarding leave, retirement and sabbatical
policy and will work something out that doesn't violate government
ethics.''
   Sabbaticals are traditionally given in academic institutions over
seven years to senior professors to conduct research at full pay.
   HHS officials said that in the past, academic figures have
frequently taken unpaid leaves from their institutions to work at
HHS for a period of time, but not sabbaticals.
   The White House earlier this week requested that Congress
postpone Sullivan's confirmation hearing, saying that the financial
disclosure statements and FBI background check were not completed.
   White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper said he did not know whether
Eaves' connection to Morehouse was the reason for the delay. The FBI
had no immediate comment.
   The school paid Eaves $675 a month for about four years as a
guest lecturer while he promoted the school's positions on several
issues before the commission. Goodman said he did not know how often
Eaves lectured at the school.
   Eaves was convicted last May on extortion charges.
   Aides to the Senate Finance and Labor and Human Resources
committees, which will hold hearings on Sullivan's nomination, said
they were unaware of Sullivan's connection to Eaves.

   President Bush said today that ``there is no
greater peace than that which comes from prayer'' and later jokingly
predicted that those who pray for him to land in hot water will have
their prayers answered.
   The president, speaking to the National Prayer Breakfast, mixed
serious talk about the value of prayer with jokes about critics and
his pledge to encourage ``a kinder, gentler nation.''
   Bush said he prays daily, and ``there is no greater peace than
that which comes from prayer and no greater fellowship than to join
in prayer with others.''
   Bush had canceled a speech Wednesday to the National Association
of Religious Broadcasters because of laryngitis. He was hoarse this
morning during his brief talk at the prayer breakfast.
   ``Shouldn't we also remember that for all we have to be grateful
for, to pause each day to offer a prayer of thanksgiving,'' Bush
told the gathering of more than 4,000 people, including dozens of
elected and appointed officials. ``All of us should not try to
fulfill the responsibilities we now have without prayer and a strong
faith in God.''
   Bush then turned to humor, first recalling a story the Rev. Billy
Graham had told him about milking a cow in his boyhood days in North
Carolina.
   Graham, Bush said, had been told it was a ``kind and gentle'' cow
but he got whacked in the eye by the cow's tail and nearly kicked
when he tried to milk it.
   ``It's one thing to request it, it's another thing to see it
actually happen,'' Bush said. ``Maybe a lot of folks out there are
thinking that if you folks in Washington stop trying to milk us
we'll stop kicking,'' the president said to laughter from the
audience.
   On a more serious note, Bush said ``if we're to walk together
toward a more caring and a more generous Amercia, let us all share
in paving the way with prayer.''
   Bush also told a joke about a young boy whose grandmother was
always complaining about being cold and the boy's prayer to ``make
it hot for grandmother.''
   ``I suppose there may be some people in Washington and all over
the country who have already begun to pray `make it hot for
George','' Bush said. ``Those prayers will be answered in time. Be
patient.''
   Bush had a tough act to follow _ Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.
   Simpson told several jokes that brought roars from the gathering,
including one about a boy whose mother, during a Mass, pointed out a
memorial to ``the boys who died in the service.''
   ``Which one, the 9 o'clock or the 11 o'clock?'' the boy asked.
   Simpson also brought down the house by saying, ``Those who travel
the high road of humility in Washington are not troubled by heavy
traffic.''

   Vice President Dan Quayle today
criticized former President Carter for holding discussions with
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, saying ``it has a chance of
complicating matters.''
   Quayle noted that the United States refuses to talk with Ortega.
   ``Obviously when you have a former president meeting with heads
of state we don't meet with it has a chance of complicating
matters,'' he told reporters following the inauguration of
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez.
   U.S. Ambassador Otto Reich said Quayle, midway through a
three-day visit to Latin America, would not meet here with Ortega.
The Nicaraguan leader shared his proposal in a meeting Wednesday
with Carter and Perez. Carter declined to discuss details.
   Reich said Quayle had no plans to meet with Carter, although the
two did speak briefly Wednesday night at a reception at the
ambasssador's residence.
   Quayle and the U.S. delegation are trying to learn more about a
peace proposal that Ortega brought with him to Caracas, but the vice
president said nothing has been learned officially.
   Asked if he had talked to President Bush since arriving here
Wednesday, Quayle noted that Bush had a cold and laryngitis.
``Reagan used to use that not to have press conferences, but it
won't be in this administration,'' he said.
   The vice president sandwiched get-acquainted sessions with heads
of state around the inaugural ceremony for Perez.
   While Quayle held bilateral meetings upstairs in the Caracas
Hilton Hotel, Ortega met briefly with Cuba's President Fidel Castro
in the downstairs lobby.
   Quayle met first with Spain's prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez,
and then with Brazilian President Jose Sarney.
   The meeting with Sarney centered almost entirely on the Latin
debt crisis and the one with Gonzalez on a range of U.S.-European
political and security issues, said Quayle's press secretary, David
Beckwith.
   Ambassador Reich said Quayle seems to be developing a good
rapport and handling himself confidently in the meetings. He said
the foreign leaders mostly want to ask questions about the Bush
administration policies on the Third World debt situation and
Central American conflicts.
   ``They like him. There is very good rapport. They think he's very
open, obviously very interested in listening,'' Reich said.
   Quayle has explained that the new administration's policies are
still developing, the ambassador said. ``He's explaining ... that
the administration is less than two weeks old.''
   Beginning his three-day Latin American trip Wednesday, Quayle
warned that the United States will not look kindly on formation of a
``debtors' cartel'' to deal with the region's creditors, whose hold
$440 billion in debts.
   He met with Colombia's president, Virgilio Barco, with outgoing
Venezuelan President Jaime Lusinchi and with Lusinchi's successor,
Perez.
   Quayle today continued his effort to meet as many heads of state
as possible while he was here for the Perez swearing-in. The
schedule included meetings with the presidents of Spain, Brazil,
Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru and Portugal and a lunch with Caribbean
leaders.
   Michael Skol, a State Department Latin America specialist
traveling with Quayle, said the vice president was taking a cautious
approach.
   ``He's not saying too much when he shouldn't say too much,''
especially on topics for which President Bush's policy is still
developing.
   Quayle arrived on the Bush administration's first overseas
diplomacy mission to find a atmosphere buzzing with talk of the
region's financial crisis.
   During his meeting with Perez, aides said, the two agreed to
disagree on the Third World debt issue, but concurred on the need to
push for democratic reforms in Nicaragua and Panama.
   The Venezuelan leader has been active in promoting the idea of a
coordinated Latin effort to deal with the countries' debts. The
United States opposes any organization amounting to a cartel but is
not ruling out other kinds of multilateral approaches, said Quayle's
national security adviser, Carnes Lord.
   Quayle told reporters the new administration is `absolutely
opposed to the idea of a debtors' cartel.''
   Perez pressed for more U.S. flexibility on the issue and Quayle
promised to relay the request to Washington, said an aide, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Perez, who previously served as Venezuela's president in the
1970s, also is expected to play a key role in efforts to develop a
regional peace plan.
   Contra leader Alfredo Cesar told reporters at a reception hosted
for Quayle by Ambassador Reich that he sees Perez as the main leader
for resolving the Nicaraguan conflict.
   Perez supported the Sandinista overthrow of Nicaraguan dictator
Anastasio Somoza in 1979, but now has joined other critics of the
leftist regime's curtailment of individual freedoms.

   President Bush said Thursday that he prays
daily for guidance and, trading solemnity for levity, told those who
pray for him to land in hot water that their ``prayers will be
answered.''
   The president and first lady Barbara Bush attended the annual
National Prayer Breakfast a day after he canceled a scheduled
appearance before the National Association of Religious Broadcasters
because of his laryngitis.
   Still hoarse, Bush mixed serious talk about the value of prayer
with a handful of jokes, bemoaning that because of protocol his
attempt at comedy came after remarks by Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.,
who warmed up the crowd of more than 4,000 with a polished stand-up
act.
   Bush, beginning on a serious note, said: ``There is no greater
peace than that which comes from prayer and no greater fellowship
than to join in prayer with others. ... All of us should not try to
fulfill the responsibilities we now have without prayer and a strong
faith in God.''
   He then turned to humor, poking fun at his call for a ``kinder,
gentler nation'' with a story the Rev. Billy Graham had told him
about milking a cow in his boyhood days in North Carolina.
   Graham, Bush said, had been told it was a ``kind and gentle'' cow
but he got whacked in the eye by the cow's tail and nearly kicked
when he tried to milk it.
   ``Maybe a lot of folks out there are thinking that if you folks
in Washington stop trying to milk us we'll stop kicking,'' the
president said to laughter from the audience.
   Bush also told a joke about a young boy whose grandmother kept
closing the windows each time the boy opened them. Despite their
running battle, Bush said, the boy prayed God would ``make it hot
for grandmother.''
   ``I suppose there may be some people in Washington and all over
the country who have already begun to pray `make it hot for
George','' Bush said. ``Those prayers will be answered in time. Be
patient.''
   Simpson proved a tough act to follow.
   He gave a nostaligic version of a childhood he said included
federal probation for blowing up mail boxes, rowdy college days
during which ``I thought beer was food,'' and a father who when
asked at the age of 91 if he had lived his entire life in Cody,
Wyo., replied wryly: ``Not yet.''
   Simpson drew roars from the crowd with a joke about a boy whose
mother, during Mass, pointed out a church memorial to ``the boys who
died in the service.''
   ``Which one, the 9 o'clock or the 11 o'clock?'' the boy asked.
   Simpson also brought down the house with a one-liner aimed at the
self-important in the nation's capital, saying, ``Those who travel
the high road of humility in Washington are not troubled by heavy
traffic.''

   State legislators say they are getting
complaints from constituents who mistakenly think it is the Indiana
lawmakers up for a 51 percent pay raise.
   It is actually members of the U.S. Congress who may get more
money.
   On Wednesday, the state House tried to resolve the confusion by
passing a resolution that condemns a congressional pay raise. The
resolution is pending in the Indiana Senate.
   ``Some of my constituents have been complaining to me about this
pay increase. They are confusing us with them,'' said Rep. Stephen
Moberly, who sponsored the resolution. ``This gives us a chance to
say the Indiana House doesn't support the pay increase.''
   Debbie Collins, a supervisor at the House telephone center,
estimated Thursday there had been 40 or 50 telephone calls over the
past week.
   ``I've had four today. People are still confused (even after
publicity on the House resolution). I tell them the pay raise is not
here, but in Washington, D.C., and that they need to call their
congressman in Washington or in their hometown.
   ``Sometimes they still get a little upset,'' said Collins.
``We've had some irrate ones.''

   Runaway railroad cars derailed and exploded
early today, knocking out power to 37,000 people in and around
Helena and forcing the evacuation of thousands in wind chills of 70
degrees below zero.
   There were no reports of serious injuries in the 4:48 a.m.
explosion, which rocked houses up to three miles away, overturned
automobiles and shattered windows in a nearby college and homes,
officials said.
   The explosion occurred in an open area near three major power
lines, and authorities believed at least one had been severed.
Electricity was restored to all but half the city within 10 minutes.
   ``It's a miracle no one was killed or injured,'' said Ed Schild,
undersheriff for Lewis and Clark County.
   Firefighters fought a blaze near a railroad tanker containing
hydrogen peroxide, which threatened to set off a second explosion,
police Capt. Bud Carbis said. The fire flared up and spread to a
boxcar containing plastic pipe, releasing hydrochloride gas, which
Carbis described as ``very noxious.''
   Authorities urged ``everybody in town to stay inside,'' Carbis
said. Emergency workers were pulled back from the scene because of
the gas and one paramedic was taken to a hospital after inhaling
fumes, he said. Firefighters wore respirators.
   Snow fell as firefighters poured water on the flames.
Temperatures of 29 degrees below zero combined with winds to produce
wind chills of 70 below, the National Weather Service said.
   About 2,000 people, including 700 to 800 of the 1,100 students at
Carroll College, were evacauted from a square-mile area around the
blast zone, officials said. Evacuees went to churches, the Helena
Civic Center, the National Guard armory and schools, which were
already closed by the cold snap.
   The blast initially knocked out power to all of the state
capital, which has about 27,000 people, and the surrounding Helena
Valley, population 10,000.
   ``Our campus has suffered extensive damage,'' said Mayor Russell
Ritter, who is also head of development for Carroll. ``There are
chunks of rail cars blown from 300 yards away all over campus.''
   Virtually all the windows at the college were smashed and stone
trim was knocked off the physical education building, Ritter said.
   The explosion came after Montana Rail Link freight cars broke
loose near the Continental Divide while engines were being switched
on Burlington Northern tracks, railroad officials said. The cars
rolled nine miles east and downhill into Helena, where they struck a
locomotive and exploded, said Rail Link spokesman Terry Toppins.
   ``I jumped out of the way from being squashed,'' said Mike
McNellis, who was aboard the locomotive struck by the runaway cars.
   About 20 cars derailed, said Mike Lemm of Montana Rail Link. One
of the cars contained hydrogen peroxide, another held alcohol and
the third was carrying an unknown liquid, according to the state
Disaster and Emergency Services Division.
   Hydrogen peroxide is a corrosive and dangerous chemical, Toppins
said.
   The explosion occurred in an open area directly north of the
college and between the city dump and city golf course.
   ``If it wasn't for that golf course and the (adjacent) baseball
diamonds, we'd have a lot of tragedies,'' said Lewis and Clark
County Sheriff Chuck O'Reilly. ``That really saved our bacon.''
   About 300 Carroll College students and nearby residents milled
about the main floor of the National Guard armory, about half a mile
across an empty field from the college.
   Students generally joked and laughed or dozed in groups, but
older people were somber.
   ``It's funny to see what some people brought with 'em,'' said
Alex Lobdell, editor of the campus newspaper. ``There was a lot of
makeup. One girl had her fishtank. And lots of people _ Helena
people, not students _ brought their dogs. No cats, just dogs.''
   The only injury reported at the college was a girl who suffered a
minor cut on her arm, said Jeff Baker, vice president for academic
affairs.

<TEXT>
   The escalating prices of fuel, motorcycles,
and bicycles have created a run on donkeys in a northern state,
increasing their cost by 500 percent, a news report said Thursday.
   The military government ordered a 43 percent increase in fuel
prices in January, the second big increase in a year. Inflation has
put motorcycles and bicycles out of the range of many Nigerians,
prompting some to turn to donkeys.
   Malam Sani-Maijaki of the Katsina state town of Jibia told the
News Agency of Nigeria that demand for his donkeys had increased
sharply because of the higher fuel costs.
   As a result, the price for a medium-sized donkey has risen to
about $30, he said.
   Sani-Maijaki also said some Nigerians had developed a taste for
donkey and horse meat during the country's hard times, also driving
up prices.
   The economy of this West African oil-exporting nation has been in
a deep recession because of low oil prices and economic
mismanagement.

<TEXT>
   Searchers today found a 16-year-old youth who
had been stranded in his car for 2{ days on a snow-blocked road with
only a light jacket, sweatshirt and car mats for warmth in
below-zero temperatures.
   Towner County Sheriff Howard Soderberg identified the boy as
Bennett Stebleton of rural Egeland. He was returning Monday night
from Devils Lake, about 40 miles to the southeast, when he
apparently became disoriented.
   Overnight temperatures in the region had dropped to 20 degrees
below zero or more.
   Greg Mitchell of Rock Lake, a volunteer in the search effort,
came upon Stebleton's car shortly before 11 a.m. today. The vehicle
was on a lightly travthat was blocked by a snowdrift.
   The boy was coherent when he was rescued, but was badly
frostbitten on his feet and hands, Mitchell said. He was listed in
serious condieled rural road tion at Towner County Memorial Hospital in
Cando.
   About 20 to 25 people, both officers and volunteers, helped in
the search, Soderberg said.
   Stebleton had driven to Devils Lake on Monday to take his older
brother to the Amtrak station there, Soderberg said. The brother was
going to Fargo to take a military pre-induction physical, the
sheriff said.
   Stebleton's parents were already in Fargo visiting a sick
relative, and discovered the boy was missing after th   ``I'm trying to
invest it wisely. I never had that much before
and a couple of times I was down on hard times,'' she said,
recalling the time she sold blood plasma to a local clinic for $30 a
week.
   John D. Flowers, an assistant high school principal from
Barboursville, W.Va., has followed a similar play-it-safe pattern
after winning $2 million in the West Virginia lottery in the spring
of 1986.
   Flowers, 40, who continues working but whose wife quit her job,
said most of his first lottery check went toward buying a new house.
On his accountant's advice, 10 percent was placed in a tax-deferred
retirement annuity and another 10 percent was reserved for his three
children's college education.
   A small amount was invested in mutual funds and short-term
tax-free municipal bonds. Flowers, like some other lottery winners
interviewed, has avoided stocks.
   ``This has raised our overall standard of living and lowered our
overall worry level,'' said Flowers.
   Most prize recipients say their main goal is maintaining a higher
living standard, long after the lottery checks cease.
   Tax expert Jane Feola Scaccetti, who has counseled lottery
winners, says that can easily be done through diversified
investments. But her first advice is that clients take things slow.
   ``It's the same thing as with someone who inherits a lot of
money,'' said Ms. Scaccetti, a tax partner with the Philadelphia
accounting firm Laventhol &amp; Horwath. ``You usually try to slow the
pace down, apply all the sound financial decision process ... as you
would a wealthy individual who has earned money over a period of
time.''
   For the first two years most lottery winners might want to keep
the money in high-yielding CDs or Treasury bills, Ms. Scaccetti
said. Some banks, such as Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, offer
special accounts for clients who suddenly have $1 million or more
and need a place to park it.
   Of course, lottery winners also should be looking for ways to
shelter themselves from taxes, such as tax-free municipal bonds or
annuities, Ms. Scaccetti said.
   Later on, ``They need to ask themselves: `Do I need to have a
fixed return because I want to give up working, or do I want to
continue working and put a fixed income amount set aside,'' she said.
   Dick Zimmermann, 39, a former ABC News producer from the San
Francisco Bay area, fell in both categories after winning $9.76
million in the California lottery a year ago.
   Although his annual net income of $500,000 has kept himself and
his wife out of the work force, they've been cautious.
   Zimmermann opted for investments most likely to appreciate, like
a new $425,000, 3-bedroom house and a 1964 Rolls Royce Silver Cloud
III. For tax reasons Zimmermann obtained a 15-year home mortgage
rather than paying cash.
   ``We're trying to be good stewards of this money,'' he said.
``After all, this sort of thing doesn't even come once in a
lifetime. Your chances of being struck by lightning are four times
better.''

<TEXT>
   Part of an overloaded express train
derailed Thursday near the port city of Chittagong, killing at least
13 people and injuring more than 70, officials and news reports said.
   The accident came less than three weeks after another train
disaster that officials described as Bangladesh's worst ever. On
Jan. 5, two trains collided head-on on the Dhaka-Chittagong tracks
near Tongi just north of Dhaka, killing 114 people and injuring at
least 1,000.
   The train in Thursday's accident was carrying about 2,100
passengers, three times its authorized capacity, the government news
agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha said.
   ``Many people were traveling on rooftops of the cars, and many
others were hanging on the doors as there was a rush for going home
for the weekend,'' it reported. People often ride atop overloaded
trains in Bangladesh.
   Although official reports put the number of injured at about 70,
the independent news agency United News of Bangladesh said it was
closer to 200.
   The Dhaka-bound train derailed near Kumira, 14 miles north of
Chittagong. The government news agency said there were indications
the derailment was caused by trouble with a dining car that was
joined to the train at Pahartali, the train's previous stop.
   ``There was a mechanical fault in the dining car and it fell off
the track 15 minutes after it was added to the train. It then pulled
the two adjoining coaches,'' the agency quoted a railroad official
as saying.
   One railroad official said six railroad employees fled after the
derailment but returned about two hours later and were arrested and
detained for questioning.
   Also on Thursday, a government official said investigators blamed
railway officials for the head-on train crash last month near Tongi.
He said railway officials had wrongly cleared both trains to travel
on the same track.
   Earlier reports said the crash was caused by a faulty signaling
system which was installed five days before the accident.
   At least four railway officials were suspended after the Jan. 15
accident. Further action would be taken against them in the light of
the findings, he said, but was not specific.

<TEXT>
   The House Judiciary Committee today ousted the
chairman of its immigration subcommittee, veteran Rep. Romano L.
Mazzoli, D-Ky., in favor of fourth-term Rep. Bruce A. Morrison,
D-Conn.
   Mazzoli, a 10-term congressman from Louisville who headed the
subcommittee for eight years, authored with Sen. Alan K. Simpson,
R-Wyo., the sweeping Simpson-Mazzoli immigration reform of 1986.
   Mazzoli was ousted on a 16ballot vote of
Democratic members of the full committee after speaking on his own
behalf, according to congres-5 secret paper sional sources. Morrison, who
was next
in line of seniority, was voted in 21-1.
   Mazzoli, who will stay on as a subcommittee member, did not
immediately return telephone calls from The Associated Press.
   Plans to oust the sitting chairman, a rare occurrence on Capitol
Hill, had been discussed quietly among committee Democrats since the
November elections, according to Morrison.
   Democratic discontent with Mazzoli had been growing over the way
he ran the panel, according to Morrison.
   ``There are policy issues that Mazzoli and other members of the
Democratic caucus might or might not have agreed on, but that's not
what motivated the votes,'' Morrison said in an interview following
the closed-door meeting.needs.
   ``It is the responsibility of the Democratic chairman to give
first responsibility to his caucus,'' Morrison said. ``The ranking
Republican is in charge of looking out for Republicans.''
   This is not the first time Mazzoli has had troubles with
Democratic colleagues.
   In 1985, Mazzoli voted with Republicans and spoke out on the
House floor over the highly charged partisan issue of the results of
a hotly contested House race in Indiana. That resulted in a
diminishing of his power on immigration issues and left many
Democrats with bad feelings.
   But others pointed to ideological differences between Mazzoli and
other committee Democrats as the chief reason for the change in
leadership.
   Mazzoli ``is more conservative than most of the (committee's
Democratic) members,'' said Rep. `Judiciary is a more liberal committee
and is not ideologically
representative of Congress.''

   Fires killed more than 2,200 people in China last
year, down 7.3 percent from 1987, it was reported Thursday.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said 29,852 fires broke out in
1988. The figure represented a drop of 6.9 percent from 1987.
   Fire damage cost the country $95.5 million, a decrease of 56
percent from 1987, the news agency said.
   Xinhua quoted the Ministry of Public Security as blaming
carelessness, especially in using electrical appliances, for most of
the fires.
   One of the worst fires was in Heilongjiang province, burning more
than 2.5 million acres of forest near the Soviet border and killing
193 people.

<TEXT>
   Former football star O.J. Simpson has been
charged with beating his wife during an argument in which he
allegedly hit and kicked her as he yelled, ``I'll kill you,''
authorities said.
   Simpson, 41, struck his 29-year-old wife, Nicole, and pulled her
hair early New Year's Day at the couple's home here, according to
police records.
   The city attorney's office filed the charges Monday. Simpson is
scheduled to be arraigned Feb. 17 in West Los Angeles Municipal
Court.
   Simpson, a spokesman for Hertz Rent-A-Car and a sports
commentator, on Wednesday downplayed the incident. ``My wife and I
had a fight; that's it,'' he said. ``We put it behind us.''
   Cathy Randa, a spokeswoman for Simpson, said neither he nor his
wife wanted charges filed.
   Simpson is charged with one misdemeanor count of spousal battery,
said Mike Qualls, a spokesman for the city attorney's office. If
convicted, he faces a maximum of one year in jail and a fine of up
to $1,000.
   According to police reports, officers who arrived at the Simpson
home on Jan. 1 were kept outside by a security gate. They telephoned
the home and were told by a housekeeper that no one had been hurt
and that they should go away.
   Soon after police hung up, Mrs. Simpson ran to the gate and
admitted an officer, saying her husband had beaten her up, the
reports said.
   Mrs. Simpson's face was marked with bruises and scratches, police
said. She did not require treatment.
   According to police reports, Simpson yelled, ``I'll kill you'' at
his wife as he struck her.
   Simpson initially denied beating his wife, but later told
authorities that he and his wife had been drinking when a
``wrestling-type altercation'' began, the records said.
   Simpson, the 1968 Heisman Trophy winner, was a star running back
for the University of Southern California Trojans and the National
Football League's Buffalo Bills and San Francisco 49ers. He retired
from pro football in 1979.

<TEXT>
   A man who sued the Transit Authority for $2
million claiming a bus accident left him so weak he needed a cane to
walk, withdrew his claim after the TA showed the judge a videotape
of him changing a tire.
   The case arose from an accident Feb. 27, 1983, in which a bus
rear-ended a car driven by Ali Hanafi of the borough of Queens.
   ``The man claimed that he was reduced to walking with a shuffle
with the aid of a cane and that he had lost so much strength in his
upper body that he could no longer work as a counterman at a pizza
joint,'' said TA spokesman Jared Lebow. ``His lawyer actually
claimed in court that he was too weak to lift pizza dough.''
   Barry F. Bernstein, a lawyer for Hanafi, who has since changed
his name to Steven Haig, put Haig on the stand and called doctors to
testify that he suffered post traumatic stress disorder.
   On Wednesday, Bernstein offered to settle the case for
$250,000.'' Lebow said. ``We declined.''
   TA lawyer Michael Figliolia then produced the videotape, which
was shown while the jury was out of the courtroom.
   The tape, made Jan. 25, showed Haig changing a tire while
Bernstein watched.
   ``The tire must have weighed 40 pounds and he used one hand to
throw it in the trunk and Bernstein stood around watching,''
Figliolia said.
   When the tape ended, Haig withdrew his claim and the judge
dismissed the case.
   Lebow said the videotape would be turned over to the district
attorney and to the appellate division, ``because we feel the
attorney should be subject to some discipline because he was
supporting a phony claim.''
   The telephone company had no listing for a Steven Haig. A number
for Ali Hanafi was unlisted. He could not be reached for comment.
   Bernstein defended his client saying, ``He was hit in the rear
and he went straight to the hospital. He was taken straight from the
scene by ambulance. He was unconscious.''
   When asked if Haig was still suffering, Bernstein replied: ``His
doctors say he is.''
   Asked why Haig withdrew the claim, Bernstein said, ``It was his
decision.''
   Last year there were 3,228 injury claims filed against the TA and
$38.6 million was paid out, either in judgments or settlements.

<HEAD>Ag Chairman Says Farmers Ought To Get Crop Insurance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Kika de la Garza, chairman of the House
Agriculture Committee, urged farmers Thursday to buy crop insurance
and follow ``every known practice of moisture conservation'' because
critical drought conditions still prevail across portions of the
Midwest, the West and South Texas.
   De la Garza, a Texas Democrat, and Norton D. Strommen, chief
meteorologist for the Agriculture Department, said that they are
concerned about the winter wheat crop but that with good early
spring rains, this year's harvest could be a good crop.
   Specific areas of concern they listed are the Texas and Oklahoma
panhandles, South Texas rangeland and pockets of the Corn Belt from
eastern Iowa and western Illinois southwest into Kansas.
   ``As farmers prepare for planting this year, their planning needs
to include every possible moisture-saving measure, the utilization
of drought-resistant plant varieties and a serious look at crop
insurance,'' said de la Garza.
   Although recent snow in the West is a positive sign, ``it is not
anything that would ease the situation,'' de la Garza said.
   ``The projection for winter wheat is still a question mark,'' he
said. ``There may be some injury with the extreme cold weather, but
we can't tell yet. Overall, the projection is guarded but somewhat
positive.''
   Strommen said the situation in the winter wheat belt is
``encouragingly optimistic'' with short and long-range forecasts
calling for normal amounts of precipitation.
   With good rains in early spring, ``we have the potential for
seeing a significant revival of the crops' condition and the
potential for a good crop.''

   It seems to be getting rainier south of the
Equator, unlike the north where the moisture trend has been mixed,
according to a new climate study.
   The report, in the January edition of the Journal of Geophysical
Research _ Atmospheres, covers more than a century of weather
records and indicates increased rainfall at Southern Hemisphere
measuring stations.
   Such a finding would be consistent with the recently popular
theory of a greenhouse-like warming of the climate, the study noted.
   The greenhouse theory holds that carbon dioxide and other gases
being added to the atmosphere by humans will trap an increasing
amount of the sun's heat, tending to warm the earth, somewhat like a
greenhouse warms its interior. Warmer weather evaporating more water
from the ocean could then lead to more rain.
   But R.S. Bradley of the University of Massachusetts, one of the
authors of the new report, was reluctant to tie the findings to that
theory.
   ``We're tending to stay away from that issue. We don't want to
imply it's related in any way. We're just presenting the observed
data,'' Bradley said Thursday in a telephone interview.
   Nonetheless, the report noted that computer models of possible
greenhouse effect changes do call for increased precipitation over
the Southern Hemisphere.
   In addition to the increased rainfall, the new report found
indications of higher sea-surface temperatures and increased wind
speeds over the southern oceans, which could lead to more
evaporation and thus more rain.
   Those findings could also be a result of variations in instrument
readings, however, the study said. It noted that because the
Southern Hemisphere is primarily water-covered there are far fewer
weather measuring sites than in the more land-covered North.
   The strongest rainfall increase was detected in South America,
while there was a lesser effect in Australia and South Asia and no
trend was evident for Southern Africa, the report said.
   The study contrasts with a 1987 analysis covering areas north of
the Equator, which had more mixed results. That report found
increased rainfall in temperate northern areas but a decline in rain
in the tropics north of the Equator.
   Bradley noted that while the new findings indicate increased
rainfall in Southern Hemisphere measurig points, that doesn't
necessarily translate to an overall increase in wetness for the
planet's southern half.
   The findings could be reversed if precipitation has declined over
the vast southern ocean areas where no measurements are taken, the
study said.
   In addition, Bradley noted that rainfall, and what amounts to an
increase, can vary quite a lot from place to place. A small increase
in rain over the Amazon basin, for example, could amount to a
decade-worth of moisture for the northern Chile desert, for example,
he said.
   Overall, the new analysis concluded that rain falling on land
areas in the Southern Hemisphere has increased since the 1940s,
including an increase in the temperate latitudes starting in the
1970s.
   The report was prepared by Bradley, Henry F. Diaz of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Environmental Research
Laboratories and J. K. Eischeid of the University of Colorado.

<HEAD>Winooski Loses Bid To Tax Airspace Near Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINOOSKI, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city has lost its bid to tax the
neighboring city of Burlington for using airspace over Winooski.
   A two-judge panel ruled Wednesday against Winooski's unusual
lawsuit, in which the city tried to make Burlington pay $90,222 for
the airspace used by planes at the Burlington International Airport.
   The lawsuit said the takeoffs and landings interfere with
``Winooski property owners' enjoyment of land and constitutes taking
of Winooski land by Burlington.''
   Chittenden County Superior Court Judge Matthew Katz and Assistant
Judge Elizabeth Gretkowski rejected that reasoning.
   ``Although air rights over land may be bought, sold, developed
and taxed, such rights do not include airport runway cones for
takeoff and landing,'' they ruled.
   Winooski officials said they were glad the case was taken
seriously, although they were disappointed with the outcome.
   ``We'll appeal, as far as I'm concerned,'' said Mayor Ronald
LaCourse, adding that the City Council would have to vote to appeal.
   The lawsuit was filed in March 1988, nearly two years after
Winooski sent the tax bill to Burlington.
   Winooski residents bothered by the noise from planes readily
backed the suit. ``It's aggravating,'' one resident, James Shea,
said of the noise. ``It always happens right in the middle of the
best TV shows.''

   Authorities have ordered women
to remove their veils for passport photographs, abandoning a Moslem
tradition, officials said Thursday.
   The Cabinet made the decision last month with little publicity,
the immigration officials said.
   Until now, authorities in this Mideast federation have issued
passports to women without photographs or with photos showing them
veiled.
   An immigration source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the government changed the policy after discovering several cases of
impersonation.

   The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. has
developed a tiny new transistor that can be used to build smaller,
speedier computers and provide clearer pictures on TV sets, a
spokesman said Thursday.
   The new ``quantum wire transistor'' uses wires one-tenth the
thickness of those in conventional transistors, a company spokesman
said on condition of anonymity. The new wires are five millionths of
a millimeter thick, he said.
   The new transistor can be used to perform calculations at six
times the speed possible with existing high electronic mobility
transistors, the spokesman said.
   He also said the small size of the new transistor would permit
the development of lap-top high-speed computers.
   The transistor also could be used to develop more sophisticated
amplifiers for receiving broadcast waves from satellites and other
objects in space, the spokesman said. He said the advance would help
provide clearer pictures on TV sets.

<HEAD>Roh to Visit Hungary, North Korea Downgrading Ties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo will visit
Hungary in the fall, a news report said Thursday, and North Korea
announced it was downgrading ties with Budapest to protest improving
South Korean-Hungarian relations.
   Roh has accepted an invitation to meet Hungarian Communist Party
leader Karoly Grosz and plans to go in September or October, said
the newspaper Chosun Ilbo quoting an unidentified senior government
official.
   Hungary became the first communist nation to fully recognize
South Korea by upgrading its diplomatic status with the capitalist
country to the ambassador level on Wednesday.
   State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Gyula Horn of Hungary told a
news conference in Seoul on Wednesday that Roh had accepted the
invitation to meet Grosz.
   The Hungarian official also said Hungary did not want to change
its relations with Pyongyang.
   However, North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency,
monitored in Tokyo, said Thursday that North Korea has decided to
recall its ambassador from Budapest and reduce relations to the
charge d'affaires level.
   North Korea also demanded that Hungary recall its ambassador from
Pyongyang, the agency said.
   It quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying: ``If Hungary is
a socialist country true to the name, how dare it recognize South
Korea, a colony of U.S. imperialism, as a `state' and establish
diplomatic relations with it?
   ``This exposes how far the Hungarian authorities have deviated
from the socialist principle and to what extent they have
degenerated politically and morally,'' the spokesman was quoted as
saying.
   The agency said North Korea had warned Hungary that the new ties
with Seoul ``would create new grave obstacles in the way of
accomplishing our people's cause of national reunification.''
   Also Thursday, South Korea's Justice Ministry announced it is
making it easier for tourists from communist nations to visit by
allowing them to apply for a 30-day visa at any of Seoul's foreign
missions.
   Formerly, tourists from communist nations had to apply through
the Justice Ministry in Seoul, a lengthy process.
   South Korea is trying to encourage economic and trade relations
with communist countries.

   An Air Force FB-111 fighter-bomber jet crashed
and exploded today in a wooded area in northeastern Vermont, but the
two crewmen aboard parachuted to safety just seconds before it hit
the ground.
   ``They were at about 1,000 feet when they separated,'' said Gary
Boog, a doctor who saw the crash from his car. ``Then the plane hit
the ground and exploded. And it just disintegrated. There are parts
scattered a quarter mile in every direction.''
   ``It felt like an earthquake,'' said Joan Hahr, who also saw the
crash. ``If there was anybody left in the plane they would have been
killed. It completely exploded.''
   The plane, a medium-range fighter-bomber with a two-man crew, was
based at the Air Force base in Plattsburgh, N.Y., which is about 80
miles west of the crash site.
   Senior Airman John Gardner, a public information officer at the
air base, confirmed that both crewmen survived the crash, which
occurred shortly before noon. The jet crashed less than a mile from
a heavily traveled highway.
   ``We went up into the woods to look for them,'' Boog said.
``Apparently they landed close to a farm house. They radioed the
other plane that was with them that they were OK.''
   The jet crashed in a wooded area, just next to a field, less than
a mile from Route 2.
   ``They did a good job tucking that plane where they did,'' Boog
said.
   Donald Godbut was in his front yard in neighboring Littleton,
N.H., at 11:45 a.m.
   ``I heard an explosion, and I looked up in the air in the
direction of the explosion,'' Godbut said. ``I could see a large
giant puff ball of smoke, probably 300 to 400 feet across rising
into the sky.''

   Civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks was listed in fair
condition and said to be resting comfortably Thursday at Harper
Hospital, where she was taken after suffering chest pains.
   Parks, 75, was admitted Wednesday and has been undergoing tests,
hospital spokeswoman Zoila Brown said. Brown said Parks probably
would undergo a few more days of tests.
   In March 1988, Parks had a pacemaker inserted for an irregular
heartbeat.
   The illness may cause some of Parks' activities for February
Black History Month to be rescheduled, said Elaine Steele, executive
director of the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self
Development. Steele said Parks had scheduled appearances across the
country during the month.
   Parks is noted for her defiance of a law requiring blacks to
yield their seats to whites on city buses. In December 1955, she
refused to give up her seat to a white man on a Montgomery, Ala.,
bus.
   Her action is considered a key event in the modern civil rights
movement. She has lived in Detroit since 1957.

   A champagne company could be expected
to have a Department of Romance, Weddings and Entertaining. And with
Valentine's Day less than two weeks away, it might follow to list
the nation's most romantic cities.
   Of course, the California company, Korbel Champagne Cellars, put
San Francisco at No. 1.
   The selection, announced Wednesday, involved a computer analysis
of 75 metropolitan areas and used such factors as the number of
marriages and divorces per capita, miles of walkable shoreline and
sales figures for flowers, diamonds and champagne.
   San Francisco had the greatest number of fine restaurants and
movie theaters per capita, as well as high scores in virtually every
other romance category.
   In second place was Honolulu, primarily because it had the
greatest number of marriages per capita, according to Deborah L.
Bronstein of New York-based Jessica Dee Communications, which
handles publicity for the champagne maker.
   The other cities, in order, were: Los Angeles; West Palm Beach,
Fla.; New York; Miami; Rochester, N.Y.; San Diego; Boston, and Grand
Rapids, Mich.
   Rochester and Grand Rapids were cities the authors initially
didn't expect in the top 10.
   Bronstein said Rochester has a number of fine restaurants and
miles of shoreline. Grand Rapids has a relatively high marriage rate
per capita, although its ranking was hurt because of a relatively
low rate of diamond sales.

   Workers were evacuated from a

detected, and it took three searches to find the culprit: a rotten
orange.
   The building, which houses the Bernalillo County District
Attorney's Office, was evacuated Wednesday while firefighters
searched for the source of the odor. Nothing was found.
   ``But we knew it was there,'' said Ernie Watson, Fire Department

   Talk about a cat-astrophe.
   More than 200 domestic cats are due here this weekend for a
two-day show at the Palm Springs Pavilion. Nobody's talking scratch
yet, but they may not be fur from it.
   Only six hotels in the desert resort accepts pets, and they are
full, said Byron Tessler, organizer of the international cat show.
   So about 20 cats have no place to stay, he said.
   There is a rare $10,000 hairless sphinx from Paris and a Persian
from Argentina looking for lodging, he said. And a Johnson City,
Tenn., woman will board a plane with her Himalayan knowing there is
no place to stay.
   ``There's a Chartreux and some exotics from Canada without
lodgings,'' he said.
   ``We don't really allow pets in our rooms,'' said Pascale Daniel,
catering and convention services coordinator for the Wyndham Hotel.
``We do not allow even the exception. It is part of our hotel
regulation. If they are worth $10,000 or $1,000 it doesn't make a
difference _ no pets.''
   Maxim's bars pets because of potential damage to the suites and
the possibility of irritating other guests, said Ronnie Alcalay,
rooms division manager at the hotel.
   Mayor Sonny Bono sent a letter welcoming the cat group to Palm
Springs.
   He said Tuesday he had not been called on to help find rooms for
the felines, but organizers were expected to start dogging him soon.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says East German Leader Shows Symptoms of Failing Health</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German leader Erich Honecker is
often confused and his behavior indicates he is in failing health, a
West German newspaper reported Thursday.
   The Bonn-based Die Welt newspaper, quoting unidentified West
German security sources, said Honecker's behavior ``is a clear
indication of his deteriorating health.''
   The newspaper said the 76-year-old Honecker is often disoriented,
forgets what he is saying, and mixes up the titles and functions of
his official guests.
   Die Welt said the during a visit Wednesday by Bjoern Engholm, the
governor of Schleswig-Holstein, ``Honecker referred to Engholm's
adviser on East-West affairs as a member of the state's
parliament.'' Guenter Gaus was Bonn's long-time envoy to East Berlin
before becoming an adviser to Engholm.
   ``Honecker has been making a lot of those mistakes recently,''
Die Welt said.
   The newspaper said Honecker ``repeatedly addressed Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's chief of staff as `Mr. Chancellor''' during a visit by
Chancellery Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble to East Berlin last year.
   Die Welt said Honecker also ``often abruptly stops in
midsentence.''
   The Hamburg-based Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported last month
that Honecker was losing his mental capacities.
   Both newspapers are owned by the conservative Springer publishing
company.

   About 60 border patrol policemen raided
a heroin refinery in the north and battled its defenders, forcing
them to flee into the jungle, a border officer said Thursday.
   Up to 30 men opened rifle fire on the policemen as they moved in
on the refinery Wednesday in Chiang Rai province about 500 miles
north of Bangkok, Police Maj. Gen. Kowit Wattana said.
   He said fighting lasted for 20 minutes before the defenders
retreated into the jungle. No casualties were reported.
   Police seized 33 pounds of high-grade heroin, as well as two hand
grenades and 1,200 rounds of ammunition. They also destroyed the
refinery, where high-grade heroin was made from opium and lesser
grades of heroin.
   Kowit said the refinery was operated by Chinese Haw, one of
several minority groups living in the hills of northern Thailand,
which together with adjacent areas of Burma and Laos comprise the
``Golden Triangle.'' It is the world's largest source of heroin.

   Jack Douglas, an Emmy Award-winning comedy
writer and a frequent guest on Jack Paar's television talk show in
the late 1950s and '60s, has died. He was 80.
   Douglas died Tuesday at West Hills Humana Hospital, where he was

George Schlatter Productions.
   Douglas recently completed words and music for ``The President's

material for Bush during the presidential campaign.
   ``He saw the world from a different angle than the rest of us. He
was not only funny, he was nice,'' said George Schlatter, creator

   Douglas wrote for Dan Rowan and Dick Martin, as well as Bob Hope,
Woody Allen, Red Skelton, Ozzie and Harriet Nelson, Bing Crosby and
George Gobel.
   He and three other writers won an Emmy in 1954 for best written
comedy material. It had been used in ``The George Gobel Show'' on
NBC-TV.
   Douglas is survived by his wife, Reiko, a singer and comedian who

<HEAD>Legislation Attacks Motherhood-for-Pay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the House's most conservative members
joined with one of the most liberal Thursday to announce legislation
against surrogate mother arrangements in which a woman is paid to
conceive a child.
   The measure, introduced by Reps. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., contains no sanctions against the woman or the
person who pays her to have a child.
   Instead, it is aimed primarily at brokers who take a fee to link
women willing to have a baby for pay with couples willing to pay for
a child. It calls for a maximum penalty of five years in prison and
a $50,000 fine for conviction of such brokering and provides that
such contracts are unenforceable.
   Introduction of the bill came one day before the first
anniversary of the famous ``Baby M'' case in which the New Jersey
Supreme Court ruled that a surrogate mother contract could not be
enforced.
   While the legislation is designed to effectively end
commercialized surrogate-mother contracts even if no broker is
involved, Boxer and Hyde said they did not propose criminal
penalities for either the mother or the person who pays her because
they consider both to be victims.
   ``In the case of surrogancy, there is a desperate, childless
couple and a surrogate mother desperate for money,'' said Boxer.
``Into this circumstance a commercial brokerage business has emerged
which could lead to the creation of a new class of women in our
society _ paid breeders, and eventually a new class of children who
will be forced to accept the reality that their natural mothers sold
them.''
   Hyde said the practice of paying a woman to have a baby smacks of
slavery.
   ``By reducing childbearing to an occupation, surrogancy
arrangements attack the essential human dignity of every person,''
said Hyde.
   The two representatives were joined at a news conference by
Jeremy Rifkin, cochairman of the National Coalition Against
Surrogancy.
   ``Commercialized childbearing denigrates human dignity because it
places a commercial bond before a maternal bond,'' said Rifkin.
   The Boxer-Hyde bill technically applies only to surrogate mother
arrangements in which interstate commerce is involved, but attorneys
said the courts have given such a broad interpretation to interstate
commerce that the bill effectively would stop almost all commercial
surrogate mother contracts if it becomes law.
   Hyde is a leading opponent of abortion and Boxer is a staunch
proponent of a woman's right to have an abortion.
   Both turned aside questions about their differences on that issue
and said just because they generally were at opposite poles on the
conservative-liberal spectrum did not mean they did not respect each
other and could not work together.
   After Boxer went out of her way to praise Hyde's integrity, Hyde
said he had always thought of her ``as an honest liberal because she
is tolerant of different views.''

<HEAD>Jackson Says West Should Monitor Progress of Soviet Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Thursday the West can
test Soviet reforms by cooperating in fund-raisers for Armenian
earthquake victims, monitoring human rights cases and visiting
factories converting from military to consumer production.
   ``I believe that at every level of glasnost and perestroika there
must be verification,'' said the former Democratic presidential
contender, who is visiting the Soviet Union for the first time.
   ``The more people can see the transition taking place, the more
people can be relieved of the Cold War tensions that have
characterized our relationship for the last 40 years,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson said he had seen signs of President Mikhail Gorbachev's
reforms during a trip to the Armenian earthquake zone, in
conversations with Soviet officals, and in a visit to a MiG fighter
plane plant being converted to produce household appliances.
   Jackson arrived in the Soviet Union on Sunday to promote his plan
for a joint Soviet-American telethon to aid victims of the December
earthquake in Armenia and to assess the economic and political
reforms under Gorbachev.
   Jackson said he had asked to see a military factory being
transformed to make consumer goods, because Gorbachev mentioned such
plants in a Dec. 7 speech to the United Nations.
   ``We could see on one side the production line making the MiGs,
on the other side we could see where they were making the new
equipment for the conversion,'' Jackson said.
   He said the plant would soon shift its production to washing
machines, blenders and other household products.
   During a meeting with Alexander M. Yakovlev, a member of the
Politburo, Jackson discussed the upcoming trials of five members of
the Karabakh Committee, who were arrested in connection with ethnic
unrest that has been festering between Armenians and Azerbaijanis
for the past year.
   Jackson said Yakovlev assured him the trials would be open to the
press.
   Jackson also said four Jewish refuseniks have been granted
permission to leave the country Thursday. He said one of the
requests of his group was to gain exit visas for some Soviet Jews,
but said he did not know the names of the four.
   During a trip to Armenia earlier this week, he viewed the
devastation from the Dec. 7 earthquake and visited victims in
hospitals.
   ``The crisis in Armenia becomes a real test for glasnost,
perestroika and for our (America's) own humanity,'' Jackson told a
news conference.
   Jackson said he also met with the Soviet minister of culture and
the head of Gostelradio, the Soviet state broadcasting committee, to
discuss the quake fund-raiser, but that no concrete plans had been
made or date set.
   But American celebrities like Cher, Mike Tyson and Bill Cosby
have said they want to take part, and Gorbachev has indicated Soviet
artists will be ``allowed to participate,'' Jackson said.
   He said the money will go to rebuild schools, hospitals, churches
and set up prefabricated homes for some of the more than 500,000
people left homeless by the quake, which killed 25,000 people.

   A chemistry teacher raced from a laboratory
with an explosive vial and reached an outer door before the blast,
but may have lost his sight permanently.
   ``I ran down the steps with flames coming out of the container,''
Suryanarayana Chittilla said from his bed at Duke Medical Center,
where he is being treated for severe burns to his face and eyes. He
was blinded, but it was uncertain whether he would regain his sight.
   ``I reached the door and had my hand out to push the door open
when the vial exploded.
   ``I didn't want the vial to explode in the school,'' said
Chittilla, who grabbed the vial and ran when he realized an
explosion was imminent. Windows in the Durham High School laboratory
could not be opened.
   Chittilla and his students were arranging chemicals in a
renovated laboratory Tuesday morning when water accidentally got
into a vial of sodium metal. The combination can be explosive and
forms lye.
   ``If the explosion had occurred in that laboratory, it would,
indeed, have been a tremendous tragedy,'' Principal Barbara Ellis
said Thursday. ``We are very appreciative of the action he took.''
   Ellis said no one knew exactly how many students were in lab
because school had begun, and the students scattered after blast.
   She said Chittilla, who came to Durham in 1985, is ``a very
humble person, very low-key, but very friendly.''
   She said doctors have not yet been able to closely examine the
damage to his eyes.
   ``They (his eyes) will remain bandaged for a couple of days and
then the doctors will give us some statement,'' said George Wylie,
assistant superintendent of schools. ``This is of great personal
concern to me.''
   Another teacher who washed out Chittilla's eyes immediately after
the blast was treated for burns when the caustic mixture got on her
hands.

<HEAD>Panel Chairman Hits Bennett's Exclusion from Cabinet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee
on Thursday criticized President Bush's exclusion of drug
czar-designate Williiam J. Bennett from the Cabinet as ``a crucial
mistake.''
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the chairman, said his committee would
hold hearings on Bennett's nomination March 1 and 2. Biden said he
would have preferred to start the hearings earlier but agreed to
later dates to give Bennett, who has no staff, time to prepare for
the congressional questioning.
   Biden used the announcement to criticize Bennett's omission from
Bush's Cabinet.
   ``I'm worried that the president has made a crucial mistake,
maybe in part by oversight, by not having the drug coordinator at
the table,'' said Biden, a Delaware Democrat.
   The director of national drug control policy, which will be the
drug czar's formal title, ``has to do what none of the others (in
the Cabinet) has to do,'' said Biden. ``He has to take them on, as a
practical matter. He is entering the most dangerous world in
Washington, and that is the world of fiefdoms.''
   In establishing a national drug control policy, the director will
be called upon to develop a strategy covering more than 30 agencies
spread throughout the federal government and under the more direct
control of individual secretaries, who are in the Cabinet.
   Bush has defended his decision to leave Bennett out of the
Cabinet, saying, ``The reason he isn't in the Cabinet is that I've
tried to reduce down the numbers of full Cabinet members. And I
think that Bill Bennett's time is best spent not worrying about
agricultural subsidies but concentrating on drugs.''
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, argued Bush's position at the
committee meeting and said Bennett must have ``the backing of the
president, and he will.''
   Biden acknowldeged, ``I have no right, nor does the Senate have a
right, to tell him who will sit at his Cabinet table, but I think
it's a tragic mistake, a terrible mistake if he continues that
policy.''
   John Walters, an aide to Bennett, has said Bennett didn't
consider the decision a ``serious problem.''
   ``We have no doubt about George Bush's seriousness about the drug
issue, and his seriousness about his commitment to Bill Bennett as
the guy in charge of this issue,'' Walters said.
   Biden said that, once Bennett is confirmed, he ``must begin work
immediately ... on developing a plan that has never been developed
in the history of the United States of America, and that is a
comprehensive drug plan,'' which is due 180 days after the drug czar
is confirmed, Biden said.

   The government on Thursday criticized Greenpeace
after a ship from the environmental group tangled for a week with
Japanese whalers in the Antarctic.
   The Greenpeace ship Gondwana left the whaling fleet Thursday,
after giving the Japanese whale-shaped gingerbread cookies with a
note, ``If you want to eat whales, eat these,'' according to group
spokesman Paul Bogart.
   The Gondwana had been trying to prevent four Japanese ships from
whaling in the Antarctic Ocean. On Tuesday, the Gondwana collided
with the Japanese mother ship, the 23,000-ton Nisshin Maru No. 3,
but there were no injuries and little damage.
   ``I understand Greenpeace is conducting obstructive activities
while the research whaling fleet is conducting legal and legitimate
activities,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said
Thursday.
   ``As the research ships' activities are in line with
International Whaling Commission guidelines, those obstructive
activities are unjustifiable,'' Watanabe told reporters at a weekly
news conference.
   Greenpeace said Thursday it had filmed the Japanese whaling fleet
while it harpooned and electrocuted minke whales. It said it would
give the film to the whaling commission.
   Bogart, interviewed by radio telephone aboard the Gondwana,
called the cookie packages ``a parting gift.''
   He said the note attached to the cookies also read: ``We bear no
animosity to the Japanese people or members of the Japanese ships.''
   He said one of the Japanese boats relayed a message thanking
Greenpeace for the package.
   Japan says it plans to take 300 whales this year as part of its
scientific research to determine the size of whale stocks.
   Such research is allowed under a moratorium imposed by the
International Whaling Commission. The regulations are to be
reevaluated in 1990 on the basis of the research.
   However, Greenpeace contends most of the whale meat taken by
Japanese boats will end up in sushi restaurants in Japan.
   Japanese whaling and government officials have accused Greenpeace
of engaging in ``terrorist'' tactics and endangering lives. However,
Watanabe said Thursday use of that word was ``regrettable.''
   Greenpeace said its presence temporarily halted the hunt and drew
international attention to the plight of whales. The group estimated
the Japanese had harpooned 55 minke whales.
   In Wellington, New Zealand, Greenpeace supporters in
blood-spattered overalls on Thursday delivered bags of imitation
whale meat to the Japanese Embassy and cultural center to protest
the whale kill.
   Greenpeace said Thursday its ship was headed toward a U.S. base
on Antarctica's McMurdo Sound. The group says that area has been
badly polluted.

   Groundhog Punxsutawney Phil,
prognosticating with political flair, was pulled out of his burrow
at dawn Thursday and saw his shadow, predicting six more weeks of a
``kinder and gentler winter.''
   Despite an overcast sky, Phil's handlers from the Punxsutawney
Groundhog Club claimed he saw a faint shadow at 7:28 a.m.
   Tradition has it that if the weather-wise woodchuck sees his
shadow, six more weeks of winter follow. If he doesn't, spring is
just around the corner.
   ``In honor of America's new president, George Bush, the groundhog
stood tall and proud. He spotted a thin, short shadow,'' club
President James H. Means told hundreds of spectators at Gobbler's
Knob, a wooded knoll about three miles south of this western
Pennsylvania mountain town of 8,000 people.
   ``The king of all groundhogs is returning to his burrow with a
promise of a kinder and gentler winter,'' Means said.
   Phil's forecasts don't always hold up, but his handlers
nevertheless claim he hasn't been wrong for the past 101 years.
   Punxsutawney's tradition has given rise to four-legged
forecasters elsewhere, and most of them broke with Phil and
predicted an early spring Thursday.
   In Lilburn, Ga., a groundhog dubbed General Lee failed to see a
shadow, as did West Virginia's Concord Charlie and French Creek
Freddy, Buckeye Chuck in Marion, Ohio, Rowdy, a groundhog at the
Indianapolis Zoo, and Jimmy the Groundhog in Sun Prairie, Wis.
   Newport, R.I., celebrated ``Quahog Day'' by having a man dressed
as a quahog, a type of clam, come out of his shell. The quahog
failed to see his shadow.
   In Quarryville in eastern Pennsylvania, Octarara Orphie sided
with Phil.
   But it is in Punxsutawney that the tradition is most entrenched.
   Several hours before sunrise, Phil is taken from his year-round
home in a glass-enclosed case next to the town library and shoved
into a man-made, heated burrow atop Gobbler's Knob.
   The woodchuck, which usually hibernates until March, is hoisted
at dawn to the glare of television floodlights and flashbulbs, and
his prediction is announced.
   But the 14 tuxedo-clad members of the groundhog club's ``Inner
Circle'' actually decide Phil's prediction in advance.
   Groundhog Day is based on an old Scottish couplet: ``If Candlemas
Day is bright and clear, there will be two winters in the year.''
Feb. 2 is the Christian holiday of Candlemas.

   China and the Soviet Union reached agreement
Thursday on many aspects of the conflict in Cambodia, which has
clouded efforts to end 30 years of bad blood between the two
communist giants.
   Soviet Embassy spokesman V.V. Duhin said the consensus removed
Cambodia as an impediment to normalization of ties.
   The Chinese were more cautious. Li Zhaoxing, spokesman for the
Chinese Foreign Ministry, said the Cambodian question ``is still a
major item for the bilateral discussions.''
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said the nations agreed ``on many
aspects of the problem.''
   ``Our understanding has been increased, as have the number of
points we agree upon,'' he said in a speech Thursday night at a
banquet for his Soviet counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Shevardnadze arrived Wednesday for a three-day visit to plan the
first China-Soviet summit in 30 years.
   The foreign ministers agreed Thursday that international
supervision is needed to ensure peace in Cambodia after Vietnam ends
its occupation, which began in late 1978 with an invasion that
replaced the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge with a pro-Hanoi regime.
   Last month, China and Vietnam agreed in principle that Vietnam
would withdraw its troops from Cambodia by September and that China
would gradually reduce its aid to the guerrilla groups.
   China has called for an armed supervisory force to oversee the
withdrawal, but Vietnam has rejected that plan.
   Qian and Shevardnadze agreed the guerrilla factions and the
Vietnamese-backed government should be allowed to determine
Cambodia's political makeup without outside interference. But both
countries implied they want a say in Cambodia's interim government,
which will undoubtebly affect the future Cambodian state.
   Details of the consensus' remaining points were not released.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported the two sides also agreed to
set up a group to negotiate reduction of arms and troops in the
border areas, the site of a small war in 1969.
   In a speech later to the banquet, Shevardnadze called for joint
ventures between China and the Soviet Union, cooperation in science
and technology and transformation of their border into a region of
``peace, friendship and good-neighborly cooperation.''
   He painted a broad picture of Moscow's hopes for its relations
with Beijing after the summit between Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
   If the summit takes place, Moscow's relations with Beijing would
reach a level not seen since the 1950s, when thousands of Soviet
advisers worked in China. The nations clashed over ideology and
personal matters in 1960.
   Shevardnadze said he understood ties could never return to their
previous form, when Beijing played the younger sibling to Moscow.
   ``Chinese and Russians used to love an old song on the
Trans-Siberian railroad many years ago,'' he said. ``But time
changes and gives us new songs. And just as songs change, so must
the relationship between the Soviet Union and China.''
   Relations began to improve in the early 1980s as China began a
reform program and after Gorbachev took power in 1985.
   On Friday, Shevardnadze will meet again with Qian and then hold
talks with Chinese Premier Li Peng. Friday night he will fly to
Shanghai to meet Deng.

<HEAD>Senators Uneasy with Tower's Assurances He Can Avoid Conflicts of
Interests</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Tower</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After four days of confirmation hearings,
senators remained uneasy Thursday with assurances from Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower that he could avoid conflicts of
interests stemming from more than $1 million he received as defense
consultant.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee postponed a confirmation vote
to consult with the FBI about an investigation it conducted into
Tower's professional and private lives, including persistent
complaints that he had a drinking problem and was a womanizer.
   On Wednesday, Tower denied that he had a drinking problem and
senators emerging from a closed-door session said they had received
assurances there were no other difficulties stemming from his
private life.
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., a member of the committee, described
the information as ``different'' and ``still relatively old.'' Asked
whether it dealt with Tower's personal or professional life, Lott
said, ``possibilities in both areas.''
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said during questioning Wednesday that
he had not yet seen information he had requested from the FBI.
   Most of the concern expressed by senators during the hearings
related to possible conflicts of interest between Tower and defense
contractors for whom he worked.
   The most pointed questioning during four days of hearings came
from Levin and Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., who pressed Tower on
whether he saw the appearance of conflict of interest stemming from
his transition from the Senate to the U.S. arms negotiating team to
defense contractor to defense secretary.
   Tower provided documentary evidence that he had severed all
financial ties with the contractors. He said he gone beyond legal
requirements to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest.
   He also argued that his contributions to defense contractors were
at once ``valuable'' and ``intangible.''
   ``I gave them sort of academic advice on what could happen,'' he
testified. ``Any number of think tanks in town could have given them
more detailed analysis.''
   ``Being available at the end of a telephone ... is of value to
people,'' he said. His advice, he said, did not involve classified
matter and ``was all enlightened guesswork.''
   ``Yes, but it was enlightened,'' retorted an exasperated Levin,
insisting that ``We have to assume that this is a troubling
appearance.''
   Here's a breakdown of the fees that Tower collected and the
services he rendered during 2{ years as a defense consultant, based
on documents and testimony:
   _ British Aerospace, $265,000. Board member and adviser on
appropriations in fiscal 1988-89.
   _ LTV Corp., $246,860. ``I monitored developments'' on aircraft.
``I visited Pakistan and Turkish government officials to promote
those countries' procrement of the MLRS (Multiple-Launch Rocket
System.''
   _ Rockwell International Corp., $166,750. ``I provided senior
management with personal views on future funding of the B-1'' bomber
built by Rockwell.
   _ Hicks and Associates, Inc., $154,167. ``I served as a sounding
board and gave advice as to political and strategic developments
that would affect R&amp;D (research and development) funding ...''
   _ Maxwell Communications, $153,334. Assisted the British firm in
the acquisition of the Armed Forces Journal.
   _ Martin Marietta Information Systems, $116,000. ``I discussed
with senior management the (Chinese) Long March missile'' and
analyzed the implications of legislation on strategic offensive and
defensive programs.
   _ Textron Inc., $70,000. ``I briefed senior management on defense
and commercial future of the V-22'' aircraft and ``discussed a
possible new production facility for the company in Texas.''
   _ Astrotech International, $16,000. Board member.
   _ Jeford-McManus International Inc., $10,000. ``I discussed and
analyzed and monitored developments of the AV-8B Harrier'' jet.
   _ Pergammon Brassey's International Defense Publishers Inc.,
$4,000. Chairman of the Board of this Maxwell subsidiary.
   _ Advanced Intelligence Technologies Inc. Board Member. Figure
not available.
   _ Armed Forces Journal, $500. Board member of this Maxwell
subsidiary.
   Tower also collected $48,743 as a pension from his 24 years in
the Senate. He served as chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee 1981-84. Additionally, he collected $70,000 lecturing
through the Cosby Bureau and $50,000 lecturing for Southern
Methodist University, with which he retains an academic affiliation.
   His earnings for the period, exclusive of expenses and taxes,
were at least: $1,420,097.

<HEAD>New National Party Leader Is Viewed As Pragmatic</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Botha, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   F.W. de Klerk, elected Thursday
to replace President P.W. Botha as leader of the National Party, is
a pragmatist who has tried to avoid ideological labels.
   The nation's education minister, de Klerk has been viewed for
several years as the leading contender to succeed Botha as
president, and he is now more clearly than ever the favorite.
   Botha plans to stay on as head of state for the time being,
despite his recent stroke, but de Klerk will play a role in
policy-making.
   A former attorney, de Klerk, 52, is considered slightly more
conservative than his main rivals for the party leadership post, but
he does not describe himself in such terms.
   ``It's to the advantage of people in some quarters to label me,''
he said in an interview with Leadership magazine last year. ``It is
part of an attempt to push me in a direction I do not want to go.''
   De Klerk comes from a long line of politicians. His
great-grandfather was a senator, and his father, Jan de Klerk, was
Cabinet minister from 1955 to 1968. De Klerk's brother, Willem,
formerly was editor of Rapport, a nationally circulated,
pro-government Sunday newspaper.
   Willem de Klerk quit his newspaper job under fire for his
increasingly liberal editorial stance. He now is involved in
negotiations aimed at uniting the country's white, anti-apartheid
political parties to challenge the Nationalists.
   F.W. de Klerk was born in Johannesburg on March 18, 1936. He
received a law degree in 1958 and began work as an attorney in
Vereeniging, an industrial city south of Johannesburg.
   He was elected to Parliament from Vereeniging in 1972, became a
Cabinet member in 1978 and was elected National Party leader in
Transvaal Province in 1982.
   Transvaal subsequently developed into a stronghold for the
extreme-right Conservative Party, which opposes Botha's limited
concessions to blacks, who are in the majority.
   De Klerk has devoted considerable energy trying to halt the rise
of the Conservatives, who won 23 parliamentary seats in Transvaal in
1987.
   The National Party, however, has 133 seats nationwide and
maintains firm control of Parliament.

   The mother of a student was arrested Thursday
after she was found roaming the halls of a high school with a loaded
handgun in her pocket and bullets in her purse, authorities said.
   The woman was taken to the Milwaukee County Mental Health
Complex, where she was being held for evaluation, police said.
   The woman did not brandish the .32-caliber gun and no shots were
fired, said Jerome Kopecky, principal at Pulaski High School.
   Kopecky said a school security aide saw the woman talking with
two students in a hall. The aide became suspicious when she noticed
that the students looked shocked as they walked away from the woman,
he said.
   The students told school officials the woman said she had come to
Pulaski after hearing that police officers were shooting black
students at the school, Kopecky said.
   Kopecky said the woman did not appear angry or excited and agreed
to let officials search her purse. After the bullets were found
police were called and officers later found the gun, he said.

   A man who volunteered to coach his
daughter's grade school basketball team and was then dismissed
because he has AIDS was reinstated Thursday while school officials
review his case.
   Allen Ward, 37, was dismissed last week after only one game as
coach of the intramural team at Laurel Elementary School.
Administrators cited a new AIDS policy that requires school
employees suspected of carrying the AIDS virus to be tested and
their cases reviewed by a committee of health and school officials.
   Don Jobe, superintendent of Franklin County Community Schools,
said at a news conference Thursday that Ward would be allowed to
continue coaching after all, at least until the school board decides
whether his condition constitutes a public health threat. He said he
hoped a decision could be made in about two weeks.
   He said he believed Ward's condition ``is not such as to
consitute an immediate health threat.''
   Ward, who had launched a petition drive to be reinstated, said he
was happy to be going back to work.
   ``I really feel good about it,'' Ward said. ``I believe their
decision will come out in my favor.''
   Ward contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome from tainted
blood products used during open heart surgery in 1984. He was
diagnosed as having AIDS last June.
   Before Thursday's announcement temporarily reinstating him, Ward
had criticized the decision to suspend him, as did the parents of
some of his players.
   Dora Cable of Metamora, whose 10-year-old son is on Ward's coed
team, said, ``Everybody's afraid of AIDS, but I don't think breeding
stupidity into our children will make it go away.''
   ``It's been blown out of proportion,'' added another team parent,
Pam Gerrain. ``I don't see anything wrong with him coaching the
team. I'm not worried about it _ but there's always a chance, I
guess.''
   Ward had vounteered to coach the team of fourth-, fifth- and
sixth-graders when his daughter decided to play at the school, 60
miles southeast of Indianapolis. He and his wife, Theresa, also have
a 14-year-old son at the school.
   Ward said he told a school official last June about his diagnosis
and was unsure why it wasn't until last week that they tried to
dismiss him.
   AIDS, which attacks the body's immune system, is transmitted
primarily through sexual contact, sharing of needles intravenous
drug use and blood transfusions, but not through casual contact.

   David Frost has left the anchor chair of the

   Frost will continue to conduct celebrity interviews ``for however

   She noted that his profiles of boxer Mike Tyson and singers
LaToya Jackson and Phil Collins were well received by viewers.
   The trade newspaper Daily Variety reported that the Emmy-winning
English journalist had been replaced by substitute anchor Bill
O'Reilly because Frost was not compatible with the show's lowbrow

   Ms. Kossow said O'Reilly, a former reporter with ABC News, was
not scheduled to become permanent host of ``Inside Edition,'' which
premiered on Jan. 9 and has yet to attract strong ratings.

<HEAD>USDA Proposes Hike in Inspection Fee for Imported Tobacco</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department proposed Thursday to
sharply increase inspection user fees on imported flue-cured and
burley tobacco.
   J. Patrick Boyle, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Marketing Service, said that all flue-cured and burley that is
affirmed by importers to be free of prohibited pesticides is
currently assessed fees of 0.1 cents per pound for USDA verification.
   The proposal would raise the fee to 0.35 cents per pound and
establish a minimum fee of $162 per shipment for sampling and
testing.
   Boyle said that tobacco not affirmed by importers to be free of
banned chemicals is currently charged an additional fee of 0.3 cents
per pound to cover USDA's more extensive testing. The proposal would
raise this fee to 0.35 cents.
   The 1985 farm law required USDA to revise its fees to reflect
changing costs in the inspection and testing of imported tobacco, he
said.
   Public comments on the proposed rule changes can be sent by March
6 to: Director, Tobacco Division, Room 502 Annex Building, AMS,
USDA, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, D.C. 20090-6456.

   Pakistani officials on Thursday denied claims
by a U.S. congressman that their nation was willing to agree to
international inspection of all nuclear facilties there if the
United States would sell it power reactors.
   Javad Akhtar, a spokesman at the Pakistani Embassy, said his
government was sticking to its longstanding position that it was
willing to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty only if India
did likewise.
   India exploded what it called a ``peaceful'' nuclear device in
1972 and U.S. officials have said they believe that Pakistan may
also be developing a bomb.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., had said Tuesday that top Pakistani
officials told him on a recent visit to Islamabad that ``if the
United States is willing to sell nuclear reactors for peaceful
nuclear energy, Pakistan would agree to establish full-scale
safeguards on all their nuclear facilities, including existing
ones.''
   In response, the embassy distributed a statement saying that one
reactor at Karachi was already subject to inspection by the
International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, but that international
inspection of the entire program awaited what it called a regional
solution.
   Neither Akhtar nor the statement mentioned India by name, but the
allusion was clear.
   The statement said that ``Pakistan was not prepared to accept any
discriminatory measures treatment in this regard.''
   ``The cause of non-proliferation in this region could only be
promoted through non-discriminatory and equitable measures. It was
in this context that Pakistan proposed a regional approach to the
nuclear issue and had made a number of proposals in this regard,''
Akhtar said, reading the statement.
   The statement ``reiterated the peaceful nature of Pakistan's
nuclear program.''

   A state trooper, who notched more drunken
driving arrests in Travis County in 1988 than any other lawman, lied
on reports and under oath, and more than 150 cases will be tossed
out, authorities said.
   The 31-year-old trooper, on the force eight years, was suspended
with pay Wednesday after an internal investigation, said David
Wells, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety.
   He said the department would ask that none of the trooper's cases
be prosecuted.
   ``That basically means that neither the Department of Public
Safety nor my office can vouch for his credibility and veracity and
for that reason we will not prosecute any cases'' based solely on
the trooper's testimony, said Ken Oden, Travis County attorney.
   Oden said 150 to 200 pending cases for driving while intoxicated
will have to be dropped.
   The trooper had made 250 arrests for drunken driving through
November, according to reports published in December, when the probe
began. During the investigation, the trooper was transfered to the
warrants division.
   Steve McCleery, first assistant district attorney, said his
office's investigation was progressing and that the DPS probe would
be studied.
   The credibility of the trooper first was questioned in 1987 by
defense lawyers who said his reports in drunken driving cases
contained too many similarities to be believed.

   A report questioning the effectiveness of Navy
systems to defend against low-flying missiles has prompted a House
subcommittee to schedule hearings on the program, a congressional
aide said Thursday.
   Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., chairman of the House Armed
Services subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical
materials, ordered hearings to be held in March, said Ralph
DeGennaro, an aide to the congressman.
   Declassified portions of the report, prepared by the General
Accounting Office, an arm of Congress, said that May 1984 tests of
the Phalanx anti-missile system were done without interference from
other weapons, radars and active shipboard electronic
countermeasures that might exist in combat situations.
   Reps. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and George Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y.,
requested the report after the May 17, 1987, incident in the Persian
Gulf in which the USS Stark was hit by two Exocet missiles fired by
an Iraqi Mirage aircraft. Thirty-seven Americans died in the attack.
   The Stark was equipped with a Phalanx anti-missile system, a
computer-controlled system that shoots down missiles at close range.
   ``I am concerned that not enough attention was paid to the
effectiveness of the radars and fire control systems aboard the
Stark,'' Boxer said. ``These systems are supposed to warn the crew
of airborne threats, such as the deadly Exocet missiles which hit
the Stark, and allow the crew sufficient time to respond.
   ``While the official Navy report and report of the House Armed
Services Committee absolved the equipment of any blame, Mr.
Hochbrueckner and I believe those reports raise questions about the
effectiveness of the ship's system,'' she said.
   A Navy spokesman, Lt. Bruce Cole, responded to the GAO report,
saying, ``We have confidence in the capability of the FFG-7 to
defend itself. But it is generally accepted that the FFG-7 is not as
robust as some of the other combatants.''
   The Stark is an FFG-7, or Oliver Hazard Perry class guided
missile frigate.
   In a letter commenting on the GAO report, Robert C. Duncan,
director of defense research and engineering at the Pentagon, said
the frigates ``have an adequate capability to defeat sea-skimming
missiles, but only if all defensive systems are operational and the
crew is well-trained.''

   A 16-year-old boy was stranded in his car for
2{ days about six miles from home as temperatures dropped to 32
degrees below zero before rescuers found him Thursday.
   Bennett Stebleton of rural Egeland had only a stocking cap, light
jacket, sweatshirt and car mats for warmth after his car became
stuck in snow, authorities said. He was listed in serious condition
at the Towner County Memorial Hospital in this northeastern North
Dakota town.
   Stebleton was coherent when rescued, but had severe frostbite on
his feet and hands. His first words to his rescuers were, ``Thank
you for looking for me,'' said Greg Mitchell, who found him.
   Stebleton was returning Monday night from Devils Lake, about 40
miles to the southeast, when his car got stuck, said Towner County
Sheriff Howard Soderberg. The boy had taken a brother to the Devils
Lake Amtrak station, the sheriff said.
   Mitchell and Danny Krumweide, who came upon Stebleton's car
Thursday morning, said the vehicle was on a lightly traveled rural
road blocked by a snowdrift.
   An arctic cold front has dominated North Dakota since Monday
night, plunging temperatures to 20 to 30 degrees below zero. Howling
winds have driven the wind-chill index to 90 below in some locations.
   Soderberg said the temperature at Cando reached 20 below
Wednesday and 32 below Thursday morning.
   Stebleton told Mitchell he was unsuccessful at trying to dig his
car out. The car's engine eventually died, leaving the boy without
heat, Soderberg said.
   Stebleton's parents were in Fargo visiting a sick relative and
did not discover their son was missing until their return Wednesday
morning, Soderberg said.
   Mitchell said Stebleton was coherent but ``too wrung out to show
any emotion'' aside from saying, ``I'm thankful that I'm alive.''

   Mild electrical shocks and ammonia vapors
could be used in efforts to reshape the thinking of some sex
offenders under two measures approved Thursday by the state House.
   The House voted 96-0 for a joint resolution calling for the
Department of Corrections to institute a program aimed at curing
convicted sex offenders of deviant urges.
   The House then voted unanimously for a bill requiring the program
to be installed at the Joseph Harp Correctional Center. Both
measures now go to the Senate.
   The program, still being formulated by the Corrections
Department, could use aversion therapy, group counseling or other
components, said spokesman Jerry Massie.
   Massie said Corrections officials hope to have the program in
place in the next six months.
   He said legislative approval is not required, but Corrections
officials hope the Legislature will appropriate funds for the
program. No funding was included in the measures passed Thursday.
   Rep. Jeff Hamilton, author of the joint resolution, said the
recidivism rate for sex offenders is about 80 percent where no
treatment program is offered, but it drops to from 5 percent to 33
percent after participation in a program.
   ``In one study, it was shown that 53 offenders committed over
25,000 offenses. Consequently, if there is even a 50 percent (cure),
you reduce victimization by some 12,000,'' he said.
   Participation in the program would be voluntary, and Hamilton
estimated it could be implemented at a cost of $500,000 or less.
   Eleven states now have treatment programs for sex offenders, and
Massie said Corrections officials have reviewed nine or 10 of them.
   An Oregon program uses aversion therapy, including mild electric
shocks and ammonia fumes, to correct inmates when they fall into
deviant ways of thinking.
   ``These are proven methods of treatment that have been around a
lot longer than most people realize,'' said Robert Freeman-Longo,
the developer of Oregon's program and a consultant to the Oklahoma
Corrections Department.
   ``It's not `Clockwork Orange' treatment,'' he said, referring to
a movie in which aversion therapy was used to reshape a violent
inmate's thinking.
   But Massie said too much emphasis has been placed on the aversion
therapy aspect of the program. ``That's just one component,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Greenspan Says Gas Tax Hike Preferable to Oil Import Fee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Thursday he would prefer a gasoline tax increase to an oil import
fee in the event Congress cannot meet its deficit-reduction targets
through spending cuts alone.
   Greenspan told the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee he
would most prefer that Congress cut spending to meet the fiscal 1990
deficit target of $100 billion.
   Pressed, however, on how to acheive that goal after weighing
defense considerations and domestic priorities that rule out
spending cuts, Greenspan said higher gasoline taxes would be the
least disruptive tax to the economy and would have ``certain
advantages'' to the nation's long-term energy posture.
   ``All taxes do harm _ over the long run expenditures tend to
creep up and absorb any increases in them,'' Greenspan said. ``But,
with certain limitations, some do less harm than others.''
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the committee's chairman, has long
supported an increase in the federal tax of 9 cents a gallon on
gasoline as a way of helping balance the budget.
   Greenspan had endorsed an increase in gasoline taxes more than a
year ago, but his qualified support Thursday was the first since
President Bush has taken office.
   The Fed chairman said higher gasoline taxes would be preferable
to oil import fees because any gas tax increase would come ``at the
tail end of the business process'' and therefore would not
reverberate through the economy.
   ``It's only in that sense that I feel that it is the lesser
evil,'' he said. `` ... Allowing deficits to persist courts a
dangerous corrosion of our economy and risks potentially significant
reductions over time in our standard of living.''
   With each penny per gallon yielding a $1 billion in revenues,
gradual increases of five cents a year in the gas tax levy are
becoming more attractive to many lawmakers as a way of reducing the
federal deficit.
   But they are widely opposed in the South and West, where people
drive more than in the rest of the country and would have to bear
much of any increase.
   The government ended the 1988 fiscal year with a budget deficit
of $155.1 billion, $11.1 billion over the $144 billion target for
that year established by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
   With no new taxes or spending, the White House budget office
projects the 1990 deficit will fall to $127 billion, even assuming a
3.5 percent rate of growth and a decline in interest rates.
   The Congressional Budget Office, assuming a slower growth rate
and higher interest rates, predicts the the 1990 deficit would be a
$146 billion without new taxes or spending cuts.

<HEAD>Ideology Conference to Debate Communist Party's Future</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party opened an ideology
conference Thursday aimed at charting a new course following a
Central Committee offer to allow the opposition to organize and
participate in running the country.
   Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the leader of the nation and the party,
delivered the opening address to 469 party members and hundreds of
observers from other East bloc countries gathered in Warsaw.
   ``Poland is living through a time of great transformations. They
are being born among various contradictions, in the course of
discussions and disputes in the increasingly broad socialist
dialogue,'' Jaruzelski said.
   ``Hence our expectation the conference will answer questions
about the current shape of values and principles of socialism, their
presence in political and economic transformations, the essence of
pluralism, and directions of further chances in the party itself,''
he said.
   Issues of ownership, the political system itself and changes in
the party are among the main topics at the meeting, said Andrzej
Czyz, head of the party's ideological department, in an interview
with the news agency PAP.
   The party convened the conference at a time when there is open
criticism among its members over a Central Committee offer made at a
party plenum Jan. 18 to negotiate the legalization of the banned
trade union Solidarity.
   The party-sanctioned martial law crackdown in December 1981
crushed the Soviet bloc's only independent trade union and
parliament formally banned the union about a year later.
   At the plenum, 20 percent of the Central Commitee members opposed
trade union pluralism, Politburo member Jozef Czyrek told the weekly
newspaper Polityka.
   The future of the union as well as political and economic reforms
will be discussed when party officials, government representatives
and members of the opposition open talks Feb. 6.
   ``Agreement combined with opening to broadly perceived pluralism
will not be easy and will also be a struggle,'' Jaruzelski said.
``But we want this process to be marked by political culture, mutual
respect which overcomes confrontational stereotypes, rancour and
resentment.''
   Politburo member Marian Orzechowski, designated to prepare the
ideological conference, said Monday the conference ``is merely
concerned with ideology and theory. It cannot take any personnel
changes. It cannot take any other binding conclusions.''
   Orzechowski said that the party has more than 2 million members
and that less than 100 members had handed in their party cards after
the decision on Soldiarity.
   Czyz said the Polish party had been following changes in other
socialist countries and that party scientists and theoreticians had
met with their counterparts from the Soviet Union and Hungary before
the conference.
   The closed-door sessions of the conference will continue until
Saturday.

<HEAD>Senators Rebuff Hastings in Impeachment Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 3 grafs comment from Hastings' attorney</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Rules Committee on Thursday rebuffed
federal judge Alcee L. Hastings' request that the full Senate
conduct evidence hearings in his impeachment trial.
   Instead, the committee called for a panel of 12 lawmakers to
conduct hearings that would be televised so senators could watch if
they chose.
   ``There will be no question about the fairness of it,'' Rules
Committee Chairman Wendell Ford, D-Ky., said as his panel approved,
9-0, a plan under which Senate leaders would name six Republican and
six Democratic lawmakers to hear evidence.
   The 52-year-old Florida jurist is accused of plotting to get a
$150,000 payoff.
   Under the committee's plan, which is expected to be approved by
the Senate, the full Senate would first hold hearings on Hastings'
motions to dismiss the charges against him.
   Then the 12-senator panel would convene to hear perhaps six weeks
of evidence concerning Hastings, who is the first black official
ever to be impeached. He is also the first black U.S. District judge
in Florida.
   The House approved 413-3 on Aug. 8 a bill of impeachment alleging
that the U.S. District Court judge conspired with a Washington
attorney to obtain money from two convicted racketeers in exchange
for a guarantee they would not serve time.
   It also accuses him of making false statements at the 1983 trial
in which a federal jury acquitted him of conspiracy in that case.
   The bill of impeachment also accuses Hastings of disclosing
information obtained by the government from a wiretap. It says his
action wrecked a federal criminal investigation.
   Impeached by the House, Hastings now faces the second step in the
process, trial by the Senate. If convicted by the full Senate, he
will be removed from his $89,500 post on the bench. House members
act as prosecutors, and there is no appeal from the Senate's
decision.
   Hastings, who was not on hand for the Rules Committee session,
says he is innocent. He wasn't in his chambers Thursday in Miami and
couldn't be reached immediately for comment on the ruling.
   He has been saying that all of the senators who will vote on the
charges should hear the evidence in person and see the demeanor of
the witnesses, not merely read a committee transcript.
   Lawmakers, however, have been wary about tying up the Senate
floor for six weeks or more. Shunting such sessions into a committee
is a procedure devised in the 1930s after a painfully long
impeachment trial.
   ``We have other constitutional responsibilities,'' Ford said.
   The procedure was not used until 1986 when impeached District
Judge Harry E. Claiborne of Las Vegas sought in vain to hang onto
his black robe, even though he already was serving a prison sentence
for tax evasion.
   In the current case, the Rules Committee left it up to the
special 12-member panel to decide if the television signals from the
evidence hearings would be sent by closed circuit only to senators'
offices or made available to the public. The Claiborne trial was
broadcast nationwide by the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network
(C-SPAN).
   The evidence hearings also will be videotaped for viewing by
senators in their offices.
   ``The video will give us an opportunity to accommodate Judge
Hastings in his request that we watch the demeanor of the
witnesses,'' Ford said.
   Before the evidence phase of the trial gets under way, perhaps in
March, the Senate must first act on motions by Hastings and his
attorney, Terence J. Anderson, to dismiss the counts against him.
   Ford said he thought such matters could be cleared up within 30
days.
   Anderson, a University of Miami law professor, said he thought
the scheduling of motions was ``sensible'' and represents ``some
recognition of the seriousness of the issues.''
   Anderson repeated his argument that leaving the case to a panel
was unconstitutional, although he said it could prove beneficial to
Hastings.
   ``The argument is at least you'll have the full attention of 12
senators instead of people wandering in and out. But I'm not sure
that's constitutional,'' he said. ``Judge Hastings is not fighting
just to keep a job; he's fought to vindicate constitutional
principle.''

   A bipartisan group of senators is asking
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner to allow imposition of
tougher miles-per-gallon standards for 1990 cars.
   A department spokesman, Hal Paris, said today that no decision
would be made on the standards until Skinner reviews the matter.
Paris said he doubts that the new secretary has yet seen the
senators' letter, which was sent Wednesday.
   The letter asked Skinner to allow the Corporate Average Fuel
Efficiency standard to go to 27.5 miles per gallon for the 1990
model year. That would mean an automobile manufacturer would have to
meet that standard as an average for all cars produced.
   The current standard is 26.5 miles per gallon, allowed by former
Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley although a fuel conservation
law calls for it to be one point higher. The law allows the
transportation secretary to relax the standard year by year and
Skinner would have to take such action for the standard not to
increase for 1990 models.
   The automotive industry says government imposition of mileage
standards forces it to produce smaller cars that the buying public
doesn't want. A bill was introduced Wednesday to abolish the
standards.
   The senators, led by Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I., who is ranking
Republican on the Committee on Environment and Public Works, praised
Skinner for showing ``a refreshing sensitivity to environmental
concerns'' when he appeared before the committee last week.
   Others signing the letter were Sens. Brock Adams, D-Wash.; David
Durenberger, R-Minn.; Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn.; Bob Graham, D-Fla.,
and John Kerry, D-Mass.
   The senators said Burnley's action allowing a lower standard was
taken ``at the same time that evidence was mounting and suggesting
that, if anything, to help control the problem of global climate
change that results from the emission of greenhouse gases such as
carbon dioxide from motor vehicles, we should be tightening the
standards, not relaxing them.''
   It urged Skinner to reject all petitions to relax the standards
and asked that he consult with senators opposed to the lower
standard before announcing his decision.
   Rep. Bob Carr, D-Mich., said the rules cause the economy to
suffer in his home state and the nation.
   He introduced again a bill which died last session without action
by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, whose chairman, Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., said the fuel-economy standards appeared to
be working fairly well.
   Carr, in introducing the measure, said, ``CAFE is a government
regulation that is simply not needed.''
   He said with the rules, the two largest domestic automakers,
General Motors and Ford, ``face the unfortunate prospect of having
to limit or stop selling some of the most popular cars in America
today.''

   Indian soldiers opened fire Thursday on
student demonstrators at a university in a northern town, killing at
least two people and injuring eight, police said.
   A police official said on condition of anonymity that the
students in Jaffna were protesting the killing of another student by
Indian troops on Wednesday.
   The students were mostly ethnic Tamils. India has about 47,000
troops in northern Sri Lanka to put down an insurrection by Tamil
militants, who have been fighting for an independent homeland since
1983.
   An official at the Indian High Commission, or embassy, in Colombo
said there were no reports of such shooting Thursday.
   However, the official said Indian soldiers killed five Tamil
rebels in two areas in the north.
   Meanwhile, militants from the majority Sinhalese community killed
at least eight supporters of the governing United National Party in
the southern town of Matara, police said.
   They said the victims were killed in separate attacks Wednesday.
Another governing party supporter was killed in the town of
Wattegama, east of Colombo, they said.
   Sinhalese militants have killed at least 1,000 people in an
anti-government campaign launched in July 1987. They say the
government sold out the Sinhalese community by signing an accord to
end the Tamil rebellion.
   India sponsored the July 29, 1987, accord because of the
sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils to the rebel cause. But New
Delhi moved in soldiers to quell the insurgency after the largest
Tamil rebel group reneged on the peace plan.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. They say
they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up 75
percent of the population.
   In other violence reported Thursday, police said the bodies of
three suspected Sinhalese extremists were found and a supporter of
the opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party was killed in other towns in
the south.
   Police said the killings of political party supporters appeared
to be aimed at disrupting general elections set for Feb. 15.
Sinhalese extremists oppose holding the elections.
   Meanwhile, a little-known group called the Green Tigers, believed
to be pro-government, has been killing suspected Sinhalese
extremists over the past two months.

   Israeli officials on Thursday
sharply played down Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's offer to
withdraw troops from some Palestinian cities, following strong
opposition from Jewish settlers.
   Palestinians also have rejected Shamir's plan, saying it is a
ploy to cheat them out of statehood.
   In the West Bank, a Palestinian was killed in a clash with
troops, bringing the Palestinian death toll in the uprising to 371.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said Shamir was simply quoting the
1978 Camp David accords Wednesday when he made the withdrawal offer.
Arens and Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner denied it was part of a new
peace initiative.
   Shamir said troops could be withdrawn from some Palestinian
cities and deployed elsewhere if Palestinians accepted autonomy as
an interim solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. He noted troop
redeployment also was called for in the Camp David accords.
   ``If this (withdrawal) proposal is accepted, terrible things will
happen,'' Rabbi Moshe Levinger, a militant founder of the Jewish
settlement movement, told Arens, who was touring Hebron and West
Bank settlements.
   ``There will be riots and demonstrations by tens of thousands (of
Palestinians) ... They will go out from the cities and conduct
pogroms,'' said Levinger, who is under investigation in the slaying
of a Hebron shopkeeper during a stone-throwing incident.
   Rabbi Moshe Bleicher agreed it would be a mistake to withdraw
troops.
   ``Each concession will cause greater difficulties. If we pull
back from the first line, we have to fight on the second line,'' he
told Arens.
   Arens, visibly embarrassed by Levinger's outburst, tried to
de-emphasize the importance of Shamir's remarks.
   ``Mr. Shamir has on a number of occasions, and most recently
yesterday ... quoted from the Camp David accords, and these are
accords to which Israel, Egypt and the United States are
committed,'' Arens told reporters at Beit Hadassah, a settler
enclave in downtown Hebron.
   Palestinians oppose autonomy as a ploy to cheat them out of
statehood and have rejected both the Camp David accords and Shamir's
offer.
   Israel's former foreign minister, Abba Eban, told The Associated
Press the withdrawal wouldn't work because it is a unilateral move.
   ``A peace proposal ... requires reactions on the other side (but)
here we can decide for ourselves just to get up in the morning and
do it,'' said Eban, who was in the Netherlands addressing a
conference on the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Arens said Shamir's comments were not part of an Israeli peace
initiative.
   ``When the Israeli government will come forth with a diplomatic
initiative, I think it will be quite clear and unambiguous,'' said
Arens, a member of Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc.
   Pazner said a peace initiative would contain ``new ideas based on
Camp David'' and would be presented when Shamir visits Washington
this spring.
   Arens assured settlers they had his full support, but he also
urged them to improve ties with their Arab neighbors.
   ``A life side-by-side with the Arabs, this is one of our goals,''
he said. ``It's up to you to develop these ties.''
   More than 70,000 Jewish settlers live among the 1.7 million
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured
from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Settlers complained to Arens about frequent stone-throwing
attacks by Palestinians but vowed the violence would not make them
leave the area.
   Legislator Hanan Porath of the National Religious Party urged the
government to rehabilitate Palestinian refugee camps, starting with
Dheishe.
   Dheishe is surrounded by a nearly 9-foot-high fence to stop
residents from throwing stones at cars at the adjacent highway.
   ``The refugees are living like monkeys behind that fence, and
there is an obligation to rehabilitate them,'' Porath said. Arens
did not respond to the call.
   In the West Bank village of Fahme, a Palestinian was shot and
killed in a clash with troops, the army said. Arab hospital
officials identified the victim as Ahmed Jamil Saabneh, 22, of the
nearby village of Kfar Rai.
   Three Palestinians were wounded in clashes with troops, Arab
hospital officials said. The army said it was checking the report.
   Also Thursday, residents of the West Bank settlement of Bracha
clashed with shepherds from the neighboring Arab village of Burin,
said officials at Ittihad Hospital in nearby Nablus.
   Three Burin residents, including a 12-year-old boy, were
hospitalized with beating injuries, the officials said. The
shepherd's dog was killed in the fighting.
   The army said it was checking the report.
   Also Thursday, nine left-wing members of parliament sent a letter
to the Justice Ministry demanding that courts in Arab East Jerusalem
stop ordering the detention of Palestinian youth below the age of 16.
   ``We informed the ministry about cases from the last two weeks
and told them that we are afraid that the norms of the West Bank are
coming into Israel,'' said Dedi Zucker, a legislator from the
left-wing Citizens Rights Movement. Zucker said it was common
practice in the occupied lands to detain youth before trial.
   The Justice Ministry spokesman denied that courts in East
Jerusalem detain minors, who under Israeli law are youth below the
age of 14.
   ``We recieved the letter and investigated and we did not find any
Arab under the age of 14 who had been arrested,'' said spokeswoman
Etti Eshed. ``According to the law no one under the age of 14 can be
arrested. We are going to ask the members of Knesset (parliament) to
present specific cases.''

<HEAD>Central Committee to Discuss Politburo Member's Comments on '56 Revolt</HEAD>

   A Politburo member who veered from the
official version of the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt and called it a
popular uprising will have to answer to party leaders for his views,
newspapers said Thursday.
   In an unprecedented move, the ruling Politburo called a meeting
of the policy-making Central Committee 10 days ahead of schedule to
discuss Imre Pozsgay's comments.
   Pozsgay, a leading reformer, said over the weekend the revolt,
which was quashed by Soviet tanks, was not a counterrevolution, as
the official view says, but a popular uprising.
   Party leader Karoly Grosz and Premier Miklos Nemeth publicly
disagreed with Pozsgay.
   Janos Lukacs, who sits on the 11-member Politburo, was quoted as
telling Budapest party activists Pozsgay's statement was his
``personal view.''
   ``As a result of what happened in the last few days, the
Politburo decided ... to seek the opinion of the Central
Committee,'' Lukacs was quoted as saying by the four major state-run
dailies. He said the meeting would be held Feb. 10, 10 days ahead of
schedule.
   Another Politburo member, Matyas Szueros, said the official term
of counterrevolution for the uprising was a ``simplification,'' but
``the contrary view is another oversimplification,'' Hungarian radio
reported.
   It quoted Szueros as saying there was need for analysis of the
1956 events.
   Pozsgay said his opinion was based on a report by a committee he
heads that is reviewing Hungary's recent history.
   The daily Magyar Nemzet said a four-hour discussion followed
Lukacs's speech, with party members demanding a look at the 100-page
report on which Pozsgay said he based his assessment.
   A Western diplomat said he had heard the report would be
published in a party monthly in March.
   The dispute and a controversial suggestion by chief Communist
ideologist Janos Berecz that the party might not be able to lead
Hungary out of its economic and social woes have prompted
speculation about possible changes in the ruling elite.
   Another Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Lukacs' statement indicated Pozsgay might lose his seat on the
ruling Politburo, gained at a party conference in May that swept
reformers into top posts.
   That conference also replaced 38 people on the 108-member Central
Committee. But it remains dominated by more conservative party
members, who won their seats under former party leader Janos Kadar.
   But Pozsgay's popularity outside the party, in particular with
many of Hungary's independent groups, would make it dangerous for
the Central Committee to oust him.
   Lukacs said the Central Committee session also should set ``a
suitable date'' for the next party congress, now due in 1990.

<HEAD>U.S. to Help Clean Up Oil Spill; Penguins Threatened</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. experts with 52 tons of cleanup gear
were bound for Antarctica on Thursday to tackle a fuel oil spill
that officials said threatened baby penguins about to take their
first swim.
   A giant U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy cargo plane carrying the gear
and experts landed in Punta Arenas, on the straits of Magellan, the
official news agency Orbe reported.
   From there, the mission was to board the Polar Duke, a U.S.
research ship bound for the spill, about 590 miles south of the Cape
Horn.
   Anton L. Inderbitzen, head of Antarctic staff for the
Washington-based National Science Foundation, said the Polar Duke
was to depart Friday and take about four days to reach the spill,
just off the Antarctic Peninsula and about two miles from the U.S.
scientific base Palmer Station.
   ``Our concern right now is primarily for the birds,'' he told
reporters at Santiago's airport. ``All the young penguins are just
about at the age where they take their first swim.
   ``When these birds enter the water for the first time, it could
be the last time.''
   There were conflicting reports of the extent of the spill, which
occurred when an Argentine research and supply boat hit a rock
Saturday and listed before sinking Tuesday.
   The 9,300-ton vessel, the Paradise Bay, was carrying 250,000
gallons of diesel fuel, according to the Science Foundation.
   The boat was leaking fuel oil at an undetermined rate, and
hundreds of drums of oil and canisters of compressed gas had slipped
from its decks, the foundation said.
   A spokesman for the Argentine Ministry of Defense said Thursday
``there really wasn't a (significant) spill.''
   A short communique issued by the Argentine navy said its planes
will fly over the sunken vessel ``to make a visual evaulation of the
damage and take photographs that allow us to decide the best means
to employ to combat the effects that could be presented.''
   Also, an icebreaker was to arrive at the scene Friday to ``assess
the best ways available to combat the pollution,'' the communique
said.
   Some environmental experts and scientific groups have said
hundreds of gallons of fuel oil leaked from the ship and created a
slick up to 16 miles long, but the Chilean navy said the reports
appeared exaggerated.
   ``The information that we have is that there is no big spill,''
said navy spokesman Lt. Juan Pablo Barros.
   Jack Renirie, a Science Foundation spokesman said, however, that
a slick did exist and that personnel at Palmer Station were
gathering drums of fuel oil and tanks of compressed gas from around
the grounded ship.
   ``The latest we have now is that there's probably 150 to 200
barrels in the water'' that slipped from the vessel's deck, Renirie
said in a telephone interview from Santiago. ``And there's still oil
coming out of the ship.''
   Inderbitzen said the Science Foundation, which organized the
cleanup mission and directs all U.S. activities in Antarctica,
feared lasting environmental damage.
   Some dead penguins had already been sighted, and the slick had
caused isolated schools of krill, a shrimp-like animal, to surface,
Renirie said.
   Inderbitzen said Antarctica's delicate, unspoiled environment
requires special measures to contain the spill, which is near two
areas set aside for special scientific study under terms of the
Antarctic Treaty.
   ``In warm weather it's easier for plants and even animals to
recover from an accident,'' he said. ``But in Antarctica, it takes
plants and animals many, many years to recover because of the cold.
It's a very, very fragile environment.''
   The U.S. cargo plane, which is twice the size of a Boeing 747,
carries a 35-foot ``skimming boat'' for scooping up spilled oil and
pumping it into floating tanks, and a small tugboat and inflatable
booms to contain drifting oil.
   The cleanup work will be peformed by Marine Pollution Control
Co., under contract to the U.S. Navy, Renirie said.
   The Chilean navy said it will provide logistical support and
dispatch its own ship with scientists and equipment to assist ``in
case any contamination exists.''

<HEAD>Soviet TV Hires World's Biggest Ad Agency to Attract Western Advertisers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE KATZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet television viewers could soon be exposed to
regular doses of something all too familiar to Westerners:
commercials.
   The prospect arose at a news conference Thursday to announce that
the world's biggest advertising agency, Saatchi and Saatchi, has
been hired to advise the Soviets on how to attract Western
advertisers and their hard currency.
   The idea is to build up corporate images and familiarize Soviets
with the types of products they can expect from President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's consumer-oriented reforms.
   ``Since our audience is not used to commercials at all, it's a
sort of entertainment for them,'' said Jane Tarassova, head of legal
services at Gostelradio, the government broadcasting agency.
   Gostelradio has hired the London-based Saatchi and Saatchi as its
exclusive worldwide consultant.
   ``The purpose of the consultancy is to help them generate revenue
from advertising,'' said Michael Parker, deputy managing director of
Saatchi.
   ``We'll be saying to them: `These are the advertising agencies
around the world that you will need to talk to; these are the big
advertisers around the world who are likely to be spending money on
Soviet television.'''
   Under Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, Soviet
television has experimented with commercials for Western products.
   Images of Michael Jackson dancing to rock music in a Pepsi
commercial flickered across Soviet screens last year, and British
Airways, the DHL courier service, Omega Watches and Benetton
clothing also have advertised there.
   Ms. Tarassova said to Soviet viewers, the Western TV ad ``is
beautifully done, it's interesting in some sort of way, it presents
a piece of foreign music.''
   Parker said the consultancy agreement is open-ended. He refused
to say how much the Soviets are paying for it but said Gostelradio
could expect to take in millions of dollars in ad revenues within
the next five years.
   He admitted that enticing Western companies to advertise in a
country where their products aren't available will be difficult.
   ``In the short term,'' he said, ``you will tend to see the sorts
of advertisements which are corporate in nature. They are simply
establishing the name and reputation of the company against that
time when they'll be in a position to be actively selling.''
   Soviet TV broadcasts on two main channels, with regional channels
in all the republics. The estimated audience is 180 million, with
another 30 million viewers in East bloc countries.
   Reaching that audience, Parker said, will cost Western
advertisers $17,500 to $35,000 per 30-second commercial. A
comparable nationwide TV commercial in Britain, a country of 56
million people, averages $52,500.
   Ms. Tarassova predicted Western commercials would have Soviet
viewers glued to their sets.
   ``I think for the mass audience it's a kind of new and
interesting thing to watch,'' she added. ``We would like to make our
television more sophisticated, more interesting to the audience, not
so very stiff and official.''

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1 million workers paralyzed the
nation's largest cities Thursday with a 24-hour general strike over
the socialist government's wage policies and its links to financial
scandals.
   The walkout closed banks, stores and government offices and
grounded Olympic Airways, the national carrier.
   Buses, trolleys and taxis stayed off the streets in the two
largest cities, Athens and Salonica. Hospitals staffed by skeleton
crews accepted only emergency cases.
   ``What's been happening in our country recently can't leave us
indifferent .... The workers' movement says no to it,'' Dimitri
Kostopoulos, a representative of Athens Workers Union, told about
20,000 strikers rallying in Athens.
   He said a plague of multimillion-dollar scandals that have
implicated senior officials from Premier Andreas Papandreou's
Panhellenic Socialist Movement ``offends our dignity, our families,
our stomachs and our intelligence.''
   The latest scandal involves the sale of weapons to Iraq by a
state-owned operation, and another one revolves around the Bank of
Crete and its ousted chairman, George Koskotas.
   Both conservative and Communist opposition parties have united in
demanding Papandreou's resignation and immediate elections.
   Thursday's protesters, including factory workers, teachers and
white-collar employees, marched through downtown Athens to the Labor
Ministry shouting ``No to austerity! Yes to substantial pay
increases!''
   They were protesting the government's failure to index wages to
inflation, which ran at 14 percent in 1988, the highest rate in the
12-nation European Economic Community. Many private sector workers
also took part in the strike.
   A strike declaration handed to Labor Minister Giorgos Gennimatas
also demanded that annual vacation leaves be increased from one
month to five weeks and that the 40-hour work week be reduced by
three hours.
   To curb an enormous public-sector deficit and 24 percent
inflation, the government imposed nearly a total freeze on wages in
October 1985. That program ended in December 1987, but real incomes
had dropped an estimated 12 percent by then.
   The general walkout came a day after educators went on a
nationwide strike to demand higher salaries and more government
spending on education. Their three-day strike has locked more than
1.5 million students out of classrooms.

<HEAD>All Two-Door Cars Suffer Damage in 5 mph Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every model of new two-door cars that was
intentionally run into posts and barriers at 5 mph suffered at least
several hundred dollars damage, with the worst repair estimate
totaling $3,444, according to insurance industry tests released
Thursday.
   Although some cars performed better than in similar tests a year
ago, ``there is no reason why any car should be damaged at all,''
said Brian O'Neill, spokesman for the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety.
   O'Neill said the low-speed tests were conducted over the past
month at test facilities in Hartwood, Va., using 19 new 1989 cars
purchased anonymously by the institute, which is financed by the
insurance industry. Damage estimates were updated for 15 other cars
where the model had not changed since identical 1988 tests.
   Repair estimates after four tests were over $3,000 for three
cars: the Isuzu Impulse at $3,444, the Daihatsu Charade at $3,047
and the Honda CRX HF at $3,040. The least-damaged cars were the Geo
Spectrum with $434 damage, the Toyota Corolla with $495 and the
Plymouth Colt with $642.
   Each of 34 cars tested was run into a barrier both frontward and
backward and also frontward into an angle barrier and backward into
a pole, all at 5 mph. The most-costly damage in most cases was in
the pole test where the impact was concentrated over a smaller area.
The pole did $1,445 damage to the Isuzu model.
   Prior to the 1983 model year, federal law required that cars
sustain no damage in 5 mph front and rear barrier tests. For newer
models, the standard was lowered to 2.5 mph.
   Less than a third of the cars in the new tests sustained no
damage at all in the front and rear barrier tests.
   In 1981 tests, O'Neill said, the Ford Escort suffered no damage
in all four tests.
   In the new tests, a 1989 Ford Escort LX had no damage in the
front and rear barrier tests but the institute estimated repairs
costing $1,481 to the 1989 model after the pole and angle crashes.
   Ford Motor Co. spokeswoman Joyce Stinson said the difference is
due to changes in the model that include a lightweight bumper to
help Ford meet federally imposed mileage standards.
   She said the pole and angle tests are ``very tough'' but all of
Ford's cars voluntarily comply with the pre-1983 standard for
straight-on barrier crashes rather than the less-stringent 2.5 mph
standard.
   A spokesman for Isuzu, Dan McCue, said he could not comment on
the results because he had not seen the documentation from the tests
but he noted that another Isuzu-produced car, the Geo Spectrum,
suffered the least-costly damage in the tests.
   Kurt Antonius, spokesman for American Honda in Los Angeles, said
the CRX HF model is designed for fuel economy with a lighter bumper
but other Honda models have stronger bumpers than last year.
   ``The most important thing is that this is not related to auto
safety,'' he said. The tests did not cover any injuries that might
occur to driver or passengers in low-speed crashes.
   The institute said a basic Honda CRX model, which was the worst
affected in 1988 with $2,782 damage, sustained $2,061 in damage to
the 1989 model.
   ``This improvement is encouraging,'' said O'Neill, ``but there
was still a lot of damage to the '89 (Honda CRX) and a very long way
to go.''
   The fourth most-damaged car, a Chrysler Conquest TSi, with a
repair estimate totaling $2,357, required a new front fender at a
cost of $300.
   O'Neill said the mass-produced sheet-metal fender costs as much
as a washing machine which ``comes complete with motor, pump, hoses
and circuitry as well as the metal housing.''
   He said a similar fender for a 1989 Sundance, also a Chrysler
product, costs $92.
   Bill Dunn, a Chrysler Corp. spokesman, said he had not seen the
data from the institute and could not comment on the results without
knowing more about criteria used for the tests and damage estimates.
   O'Neill said independent appraisers were used to assess damages.
In the case of the Honda CRX HF and 14 other cars, the estimates are
based on 1989 repairs of cars damaged in 1988 tests because there
was no change in the models, he said.
   None of the cars was repaired by the institute, but all were sold
as damaged vehicles to ensure that they would not be passed along as
new after repairs, O'Neill said.

<TEXT>
   With proper precautions, pregnant women can travel
to most places and undertake most activities they enjoyed before,
short of extreme pursuits such as water skiing or high-altitude
climbing, doctors say.
   ``There's a real feeling out there that women should try to be as
active as they can ... during pregnancy,'' said Dr. Frank Bia,
co-author of newly compiled medical guidelines for pregnant women
who travel.
   Pregnant travelers are no longer just businesswomen stepping onto
domestic airplanes, but increasingly are adventure travelers or
career women sent to Third World countries by government or
humanitarian agencies, said Bia, co-director of Yale University's
Tropical Medicine and International Traveler's Clinic in New Haven,
Conn.
   ``There are so many volunteer agencies where you're committed to
a year or two, and people are starting their families in the middle
of central Africa,'' he said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
   The guidelines devised by Bia and the clinic's co-director, Dr.
Michele Barry, are published in Friday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   They cover five major areas: commercial flying; exercise and
trekking at high altitudes; traveler's diarrhea; immunizations; and
malaria.
   ``It's quite complete and up to date. It is a good review,'' said
Dr. Henry Klapholz, an assistant professor of obstetrics and
gynecology at Harvard Medical School in Boston.
   Klapholz said he believes most U.S. women now travel at some time
during their pregnancies.
   Those going abroad should remember that comparable levels of
medical care are often unavailable outside Western nations, he said
Thursday. Prematurity, surgery, blood transfusion and other medical
problems and procedures that are easily handled here often carry
graver risks elsewhere, Klapholz said.
   U.S. airlines now permit pregnant women to fly up until their
36th week of gestation _ about four weeks short of term _ while
foreign airlines usually make the cutoff 35 weeks, Bia and Ms. Barry
wrote.
   Most aspects of flying are entirely safe for normal pregnant
women and their fetuses, including airport metal detectors in
airports, they said.
   The same is not true for strenuous vacations at high altitudes,
the doctors wrote.
   While rigorous exercise need not be curtailed during pregnancy,
treks above 7,000 feet should probably be avoided, they wrote. They
also recommended against water skiing or scuba diving below 60 feet
because of the possibility of injury to the fetus.
   Klapholz added snow skiing to the list, noting it is a sport
requiring a high degree of balance, which is thrown off by the
physical changes pregnancy brings.
   On the topic of traveler's diarrhea, the guidelines said pregnant
women must be ``fastidious'' about avoiding contaminated food and
water, but should not use iodides for long-term water purification
because of the possibility they could cause an enlarged thyroid
gland in the fetus.
   Additionally, women should avoid the popular diarrhea remedy
subsalicylate bismuth, sold under the Pepto-Bismol brand name, Bia
said. Its salicylate component could cause fetal bleeding, and
bismuth, a heavy metal, has been linked to fetal malformations in
sheep, he said.
   Immunizations should be avoided during pregnancy if possible. If
deemed necessary, immunizations should not use live vaccine or cause
fever, the guidelines said. With a live vaccine, virus can infect
the fetus, while fever has been associated with spontaneous
abortions, they said.
   As for malaria, for which no vaccine exists, the best strategy is
to try to protect against mosquito bites that transmit the disease
and to take the preventive drug chloroquine, which has proven safe
for pregnant women, the guidelines say.

   A U.S. Air Force soldier was killed when he
fell from a plane at the military section of the airport here, a

<HEAD>1,000 Protest Failure To Nominate Sakharov For Legislature</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 workers at the Academy of Sciences
on Thursday protested their leadership's failure to nominate human
rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov to a new national legislature.
   ``Resign! Resign!'' the crowd chanted when one speaker read a
banner that demanded the prestigious academy's ruling Presidum step
down.
   Other protesters held handwritten banners reading: ``Down with
Academic `democracy'!'' ``Sakharov _ Yes!'' and ``Who if not
Sakharov?''
   The academy workers, ranging from prominent intellectuals to
members of informal political groups, massed outside the
organization's headquarters in damp weather to hear a dozen speakers.
   ``We have a fundamental crisis in the Academy of Sciences. A
crisis of mistrust of the wide masses in Soviet science related to
ecological problems, the Chernobyl catastrophe and many other
circumstances,'' declared Lev Mukhin, a laboratory head at the
academy's Space Research Institute.
   Sakharov listened to the speeches at the base of the steps,
applauding speakers but not taking the floor himself.
   The academy's Presidium voted Jan. 18 on nominations for deputies
to the new 2,250-seat Congress of People's Deputies, a parliamentary
body that will be elected in March and will in turn choose a
full-time legislature and president. The parliament will have
representatives from professional, political and social
organizations as well as from localities.
   The Presidium rejected the nominations of Sakharov, 67, a nuclear
physicist and dean of the Soviet human rights movement; space
scientist Roald Sagdeyev; and other prominent intellectuals.
   Mukhin, speaking from the steps of the group's neo-classical
headquarters, said the rejections have eroded the prestige of the
Academy of Sciences.
   Sakharov has been nominated to represent a Moscow district, but
many of his scientific colleagues wanted him chosen to represent
them in the academy.
   Sakharov complained Wednesday in the weekly newspaper Literary
Gazette that the nominating process in the Academy of Sciences was
working well at the lower level.
   But he said that when the leadership made its final picks, only
top administrators were picked. He charged the leadership failed to
fulfill its legal obligations and ignored the popular will in
selecting its candidates.
   Similar complaints were voiced at Thursday's demonstration.
   One banner poked fun at the Communist Party newspaper Pravda,
which on Wednesday published an article saying the meeting at which
Sakharov was defeated ``was not only fully democratic but
benevolent.'' The name of the newspaper means truth, and one banner
declared: ``Pravda is Half-Truth.''
   The crowd heckled an academy vice president, Vladimir
Kudryavtsev, who defended the selection of deputy nominees and
promised that alternative views would be considered at a later stage
in the election process.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, quoted academy President
Guri Marchuk as saying the protesters' complaints will be considered
at a meeting of the academy's Presidium on Tuesday.
   Sakharov told reporters after the meeting it showed that
opposition had a voice in President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program
for perestroika, or restructuring.
   ``I consider this is an important event on the road to our
perestroika,'' said Sakharov. ``The scientific society has had its
say. I think it (the meeting) will play a great role in the history
of Soviet science.''
   The demonstrators approved resolutions criticizing the candidates
put forward by the Presidium, asking them to withdraw from the
elections and proposing creation of a new scientific group
independent of the academy.

   The House Judiciary Committee, in a
behind-the-scenes coup, Thursday ousted the chairman of its
immigration subcommittee, who authored sweeping immigration reforms,
in favor of a young liberal from Connecticut.
   Veteran Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli, D-Ky., who was critiized by some
committee Democrats for not paying enough attention to Democratic
needs while viewed by others as too conservative, lost the post he
held for eight years on a secret 16-5 vote of committee Democrats.
   The 10-term congressman co-authored, with Sen. Alan K. Simpson,
R-Wyo., the Simpson-Mazzoli immigration reform of 1986.
   Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., an aggressive and ambitious
former legal aid attorney who quietly orchestrated the move in
recent months, was subsequently elected on a 20-1 vote.
   A combination of issues _ policy and political _ led to Mazzoli's
removal, committee Democrats said in interviews after the vote.
   Morrison believes Democratic discontent with Mazzoli had been
growing over the way he ran the subcommittee.
   ``This is not a matter of personalities and this was not a
personal attack on Mr. Mazzoli,'' Morrison said. ``It was a decision
by the Democratic caucus that they wanted new leadership for the
subcommittee and they were not satisfied with the way the
subcommittee was run.''
   Another member pointed to ideological differences between Mazzoli
and committee Democrats.
   ``Ron is more conservative than most of the (committee's
Democratic) members,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., a leading
liberal.
   Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., a Mazzoli backer, agreed. ``A lot of
it is ideology,'' Hughes said. ``Part of it was personalities.
   Mazzoli will remain on the panel. He did not return telephone
calls seeking comment.

<HEAD>Party Leadership Still At Odds After 3-Day Meeting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A three-day meeting of the divided
Communist Party leadership produced no plan for solving Yugoslavia's
economic and political crisis despite warnings from the military
that it might step in.
   Among the most serious problems are annual inflation approaching
300 percent, a $21 billion foreign debt, unemployment of 17 percent
and a living standard that has been cut in half since President Tito
died in 1980.
   Agreement was reached on only one issue at the party Central
Committee meeting, which ended Wednesday night: to convene a special
party congress this year in an attempt to break the political
deadlock.
   Twenty senior officials resigned their party posts or were
replaced, including a former party president and three members of
the country's nine-member collective presidency.
   The main conflict is between factions who want more political
pluralism and democracy and those who favor increased central party
control.
   ``We are divided on fundamental questions,'' committee member
Josip Vrhovec said during the meeting. ``We have two different,
clearly ideologically defined parties.''
   An editorial in the daily Slobodna Dalmacija said: ``The main
feature of the session, which initially promised `a definite
showdown' but brought just several `skirmishes,' was a huge number
of endless descriptions of the already well-known circumstances and
causes of the crisis.
   ``All Yugoslavs find themselves with a contradictory feeling: On
the one hand we want a final solution to the crisis ... while on the
other we fear such a solution would never occur without a drama.''
   The military, which traditionally sits out political argument,
indicated with unusual bluntness it may take a hand if the
leadership rift deepens.
   ``What some describe as the battle for Yugoslavia will not be
waged without the Yugoslav army,'' said Adm. Petar Simic, chief
political officer of the armed forces.
   He and Vice Adm. Stane Brovet appealed for unity, urgent
market-oriented reforms and more tolerance and democracy.
   Stipe Suvar, the party chairman, told the meeting a political
climate should be created for ``the reforms necessary to overcome
the difficult situation in the country and to enable the Communist
Party to stop losing battle after battle.''
   Party membership in the ethnically diverse federation of six
republics has declined nearly 10 percent since 1981 to fewer than 2
million of Yugoslavia's 24 million people.
   Slobodna Dalmacija said no solution to the country's problems is
possible while each republic has its own independent Communist Party.
   Among those whose resignations from party posts were accepted
were Vidoje Zarkovic, former national party chief, and the three
members of the collective presidency: Lazar Mojsov, Stane Dolanc and
Sinan Hasani.
   Mojsov, Dolanc and Hasani continue as members of the presidency,
but a new policy does not allow an official to hold jobs in both the
national government and party.
   Zarkovic, a close associate of Tito, resigned in response to
demands made during huge demonstrations last month in his home
republic of Montenegro that led to replacement of the Montenegrin
leadership.

<HEAD>Bush Says He's Recovered from Laryngitis, Ear Infection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush declared himself ``totally
recovered'' Thursday after a week-long bout with a cold and
laryngitis as well as a previously undisclosed ear infection that
required him to take antibiotics.
   Pausing outside the Oval Office with visiting Japanese Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, Bush said, ``I'll make a health
statement: I'm a totally new man. All well. Totally recovered.''
   His voice was much stronger and he had color in his cheeks. On
Wednesday Bush canceled a speech because of his voice, which had
been extremely raspy a day earlier.
   The White House had acknowledged earlier that Bush was taking a
decongestant and an aspirin substitute.
   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush also had taken
penicillin ``earlier in the week for an ear infection associated
with the cold, but that has been stopped and he is no longer on any
medication at all.''
   Fitzwater said there had not been an attempt to withhold
information about the ear infection and antibiotic treatment, though
reporters had asked repeatedly during the week about the medication
Bush was receiving.
   ``It just wasn't researched as thoroughly as it should have
been,'' Fitzwater said. ``We didn't do it right the first time,
that's all.''
   The press spokesman said he did not know if Bush had had any
fever during the week.
   Fitzwater said Bush's prognosis was ``excellent. He's in good
shape. His voice is getting stronger. He feels well.''
   He said Bush probably would ``take it easy a little bit in terms
of his speaking'' on Friday ``and then he's got the weekend to relax
so he'll be fit as a fiddle for the big speech on Thursday night''
when he addresses a joint session of Congress about his proposals
for the budget.
   The president will spend the weekend at Camp David, leaving the
White House on Friday evening and returning Sunday night, Fitzwater
said. He said Bush probably would have some guests at the retreat in
Maryland's Catoctin Mountains.
   Asked for assurances that Bush would not leave the presidential
compound over the weekend, Fitzwater said, ``As far as I know he
plans to stay on Camp David, but then there are no guarantees.''

<HEAD>Algeria Gets $58 Million to Fight Locusts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Algeria will get a $58 million loan to fight
locusts that are threatening to destroy over 190 million acres of
crops on land that has helped feed the Mediterranean area for more
than 2,000 years, the World Bank announced Thursday.
   In ancient times, North Africa was the breadbasket of the Roman
empire.
   Now the swarms of locusts could destroy the livelihood of 12
million people. The loan will go to help a $112 million project for
buying trucks and equipment and spraying 15 million acres over two
years.
   That is the expected duration of the locust plague that began in
the Sudan and Mauretania in 1985 and has since swept across the
Sahara to the north.
   The World Bank, which has 151 member countries, is the biggest
source of aid money to the Third World. It will make this loan for
15 years. including a five year grace period. During that period
only interest will be payable at a variable rate beginning at 7.65
percent a year.
   At the same time, the U.S. government's Export-Import Bank
announced a $33.9 million loan to help increase production at oil
wells owned by the Algerian government. The money will go to
Sonatrach, the state oil and gas company, for equipment to be
furnished by Halliburton Services of Duncan, Oklahoma, and used by
wells in the Hassi Messaoud district of Algeria.
   This loan will be repayable in 10 years, with interest of 9.15
percent a year and the first payment due in July 1992.

<HEAD>Jury: Airport Noise Did Not Reduce Homes' Market Value</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Noise from Minneapolis-St. Paul International
Airport has not reduced the market value of three homes that sit
beneath the flight path of one of the airport's two busiest runways,
a jury ruled.
   The homeowners had sued the Metropolitan Airports Commission to
recover about $10,000 per home.
   ``These people are just ordinary citizens who fought their best
fight against an awesome industry,'' an attorney for the plaintiffs,
Richard Gunn, said after the Hennepin County District Court jury's
decision Wednesday.
   The verdict frees the Metropolitan Airports Commission from
liability for the effect of airplane noise on the homes, said Tom
Anderson, staff attorney for the commission.
   Jurors said they sympathized with the homeowners. But to have
issued a verdict in their favor, the law required them to find that
the homeowners' property had been ``taken, destroyed or damaged for
public use without just compensation.''
   The homeowners, Frank and Georgette Ario, Helen Wade, and Carl
and Gloria Frost, argued that noise from the airport has gradually
increased, eroding the value of their homes. They live in an
upper-middle class area of older homes in the south part of the city.
   Frost said he wanted to win the case to make the Airports
Commission more aware of homeowners' rights and encourage moving the
airport to a new location. ``If they had to pay us, it might set a
precedent for other property owners in the area,'' he said.
   Brad Gunn, another of the homeowners' attorneys, said they
probably will ask for a new trial. ``The verdict indicates that
there is not a serious noise problem in that area of the city, and
the one thing that everyone from both sides agreed on is that there
is a serious noise problem in that area,'' he said.
   As part of its defense, the Airports Commission cited a $125,000
appraisal report that found no evidence that airplane noise had
diminished the values of the three homes.
   Commission attorneys argued that demand for homes in the area
remains strong and demand is what holds up prices. He also noted
that the area is tops in the city in terms of how quickly homes put
on the market are sold.

   About 35 Armenian children who suffered loss of

States next week for medical treatment at U.S. hospitals, it was
announced Thursday.
   The first group of five was flown aboard a U.S. military aircraft
to Frankfurt, West Germany, on Thursday. They will be joined by
about 30 others there early next week, according to John Warren,
director of development for Project Hope, an international health,
education and training organization.
   The children, aged 2 to 17, are expected to arrive at Andrews Air

   He added that the children will be taken to medical centers in
Chicago; Buffalo, N.Y.; Boston, Tampa, Fla,; Syracuse, N.Y.;
Philadelphia; Charlottesville, Va., and Ohio.
   They are expected to remain in the United States for three to
four months. The hospitals are providing treatment free of charge,
Warren said.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said he believes this
is the first evacuation from the Soviet Union by a U.S. military
aircraft since the two countries were allies during World War II.

   Sen. Christopher Dodd, saying the American
family has changed since the ``Ozzie and Harriet'' era, reintroduced
legislation Thursday to require certain employers to provide unpaid
leave to parents of newborn or seriously ill children.
   The Connecticut Democrat was joined at a news conference by
several of the House and Senate allies who helped him push the
legislation last year, when it reached the Senate floor only to
expire in the face of an undeclared filibuster.
   Among them was Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the
Labor and Human Resources Committee that is expected to turn to the
Dodd measure by mid-March after first dealing with a proposed
increase in the minimum wage.
   Dodd noted that the bill has the backing of such diverse groups
as the U.S. Catholic Conference, the American Civil Liberties Union,
the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Association of Junior
Leagues.
   ``Like us, they see the American family changing right before our
eyes,'' said Dodd. ``Ozzie and Harriet and June and Ward Cleaver
have been replaced by Roseanne and My Two Dads.''
   He said only one in 10 American families fit the ``Ozzie and
Harriet'' or ``Leave It To Beaver'' role in which the father works
and the mother stays at home. Moreover, he said, projections are
that by 1995 two-thirds of all preschool children will have mothers
who work full time outside the home.
   Immediately after the news conference, Dodd convened the Senate
Labor and Human Resources Committee's subcommittee on children,
family, drugs and alcoholism, which he heads, for a hearing _ the
only one planned on the bill this year _ to give proponents and
opponents an opportunity to restate the positions they staked out
during protracted proceedings last year.
   Dodd released a General Accounting Office study in conjunction
with the hearing that said the measure, which applies only to
companies with 20 or more employees, would cover about 12 percent of
U.S. businesses and 47 percent of the work force.
   The GAO, an arm of Congress, estimated the bill would cost
covered businesses $236 million a year, all of it in the cost of
continuing to provide health insurance for employees while they are
on leave.
   There would be no cost to the government.
   The measure would require covered businesses to provide 10 weeks
of unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a child or for the
serious illness of a child or elderly parent.
   It also would require 13 weeks of unpaid leave for an employee
unable to work because of his or her own serious illness.

   Jazz musician Dave Brubeck will undergo
coronary bypass surgery and has postponed scheduled performances
that included a European tour set for March, a spokesman said.
   Brubeck manager and conductor Russell Gloyd said Thursday the
68-year-old Connecticut resident will have the operation Wednesday
at Yale University Hospital in New Haven.
   Doctors will replace two to four blocked heart arteries, Gloyd
said.
   Plans call for Brubeck to resume limited travel and performances
in a couple of months, he said.
   Physicians have been on guard about Brubeck's problems with
clogged arteries for about eight years, but decided last week that
he should undergo surgery, according to Gloyd.
   ``Dave is in sensational shape, which is why they have given us
such short time. ... They (the doctors) think he's in great shape,''
he said, adding that his heart ``runs like a computer chip.''
   Brubeck's next concert had been set for Stanford University on
Tuesday.
   Brubeck began his career in progressive jazz as a pianist with
dance bands and a trio from 1946-49, before touring the United
States with his own trio in 1950.
   He formed the Dave Brubeck Quartet in 1951. Brubeck has written
more than 250 songs, including such favorites as ``In Your Own Sweet
Way'' and ``The Duke.''

   In the wake of a measles outbreak among young
children in California, federal health researchers said Thursday
that intensive efforts are needed to better vaccinate preschoolers
if the disease is ever to be wiped out.
   Los Angeles County last year reported 513 measles cases, 18
percent of the nation's total of 2,933, according to the national
Centers for Disease Control.
   Of the surveyed cases for which ages were known, 26 percent, or
93 out of 353, were 16 months to 4 years _ old enough to be
vaccinated, but not old enough to fall under mandatory school
immunization rules.
   And of those 93 cases, 86 percent were considered
``preventable,'' meaning the children had not been vaccinated. The
remaining 14 percent were cases where children were vaccinated but
got the measles anyway.
   ``The routine age for vaccination is 15 months, but in most
states where vaccinations are required for school, you've got that
4{-year period where they are not ... required to have measles
immunization,'' said Dr. Paul Stehr-Green, a CDC measles specialist.
   That age group has been a focal point for recent measles
outbreaks in Los Angeles, Miami and other places, Stehr-Green said.
``That's why this (report) is focusing on that age group. They're
not real easy to get at.''
   In the late 1970s, CDC measles specialists believed the childhood
disease could be eradicated in the United States by fall 1982. But
that goal was not met; in the past six years, between 1,497 and
6,282 cases have been reported each year.
   Part of the problem is what researchers call ``non-preventable''
cases _ those patients who were vaccinated but still got measles,
since, at best, one in 20 vaccinations does not provide full
immunity. In the Los Angeles study, 58 percent overall were
considered non-preventable, the CDC said.
   Researchers disagree on whether widespread vaccination of all age
groups can ever, in theory, provide the ``herd immunity'' needed to
completely cut off the spread of measles among the ``susceptibles''
whose vaccines did not work. ``Measles is very efficient at picking
off susceptibles,'' Stehr-Green said.
   But as long as large numbers of preschoolers remain unvaccinated,
spreading the disease, there is no way to talk about complete
eradication, he added.
   In the Los Angeles outbreak, ``the large percentage ... of
vaccine-eligible patients 16 months to 4 years of age who were
unvaccinated demonstrates the need for intensive efforts to increase
vaccine coverage in this hard-to-reach group,'' the Atlanta-based
CDC concluded in its weekly report.
   Many of the Los Angeles cases occurred in Hispanic children from
lower-economic areas, where the quality and availability of medical
care may not be as high, the CDC said.
   ``Long-term outreach programs are needed for parents and children
in low socioeconomic groups in urban areas,'' the agency added.
   The CDC recommended removal of obstacles to immunizations by
extending clinic hours, collaborations between health officials and
community leaders to promote vaccination, and consideration of
community locations for use as temporary vaccination sites.

<HEAD>Yeutter Questioned Closely in Ag Confirmation Hearing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary-designate Clayton Yeutter
said Thursday at his confirmation hearing that as head of the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange he didn't know problems in futures
trading were leading to an FBI investigation.
   ``Some complaints surface almost every week of the year and they
are brought before a disciplinary committee,'' Yeutter told the
Senate Agriculture Committee. ``Most are fruitless. Some have
validity and sanctions are applied upon those against whom charges
are levied.
   ``I was not aware this was a widespread problem,'' he said.
   He said he didn't know of the FBI sting operation, nor was he
ever approached by the agency while he was president of the exchange.
   During a two-year undercover FBI investigation, which began in
the last year of Yeutter's tenure and became public last month,
federal agents infiltrated the exchange to gather information about
alleged fraud by brokers.
   ``I know no more than what is in the newspapers,'' Yeutter said
of the case.
   Yeutter was president of the exchange from 1978 to 1985 when he
left to become U.S. trade representative.
   As he was leaving the trade representative job, he was honored
with a reception Jan. 18 given by the food, tobacco and brewing
conglomerate Philip Morris, Inc., to thank him for his aggressive
pursuit of foreign markets for tobacco and other products.
   Rules of the executive branch forbid officals from accepting
anything of value from those who could be affected by the official's
action. As agriculture secretary, Yeutter would oversee the
department whose policies directly affect Philip Morris.
   The reception was reported Thursday by The Washington Post, and
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., questioned Yeutter about a possible
conflict of interest.
   ``When Philip Morris suggested that they would like to hold some
kind of event in my honor because of all the work we had been doing
in the international trade arena ... I could see no conflict of
interest problems in them doing so because I was fully intending to
go back to the private sector,'' said Yeutter.
   ``When the event was agreed to, it simply did not ring any
conflict of interest bells,'' he said, noting that it was held near
the end of Reagan's term. ``You are not going to be causing any
conflicts of interest in the final 24 hours of an administration.''
   He said President-elect Bush asked him to be agriculture
secretary after he accepted Philip Morris' invitation.
   ``We probably should have reconsidered because of my expected
continuation in government,'' Yeutter said. ``Frankly, I just didn't
think about it. We were so busy ... wrapping up all the trade
problems at USTR and getting ready for the transition into USDA, it
totally disappeared from my attention screen.''
   Leahy also asked Yeutter whether receiving over $500,000 in
deferred payments from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange while he was
a government official could be construed as a conflict of interest.
   Yeutter said the payments were made under a traditional deferred
compensation program and distributed to him in a form advised by his
tax counsel.
   Despite the pointed questions, Yeutter was praised by members of
the committee and is expected to be confirmed without difficulty.
The committee will meet early next week to vote on approval with
confirmation by the full Senate expected shortly thereafter.
   As for his new job, Yeutter emphasized throughout the hearing
what he said was the importance of holding down federal spending in
agriculture and finding more foreign markets for American products.
   ``We have to find ways to permit American farmers to earn income
from the marketplace and depend less on the federal government,'' he
said.
   ``We have had too high a reliance on government by farmers in
this country.''
   Other topics on which senators asked Yeutter's opinion and his
responses were:
   _School lunches: ``What will happen if the subsidy is withdrawn?
That is a policy I will have to take another look at.''
   _Farm Credit: ``If we do our jobs well and the farm economy does
as well as it did this year in the future, then the situation will
not get out of hand.''
   _General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT): ``We are not
about to abandon any import constraints in the United States unless
there is quid pro quo in other countries, giving us export
opportunities. It's a horse trade.''
   _Rural Development: ``The push and initiative should come from
local areas. We can help coordinate and provide technical
assistance.'' He said the federal government does not have billions
of dollars to put into helping farm communities diversify.
   _Subsidies: ``We have to know what the trade-offs are. I never
said we should do away with (all) subsidies, only with trade
limiting subsidies.''

   Nicaragua is believed to have taken delivery of six
North Korean-made torpedo boats in a large consignment of weapons on
a Soviet freighter, Jane's Defense Weekly said in its issue
appearing Thursday.
   The shipment is thought to include mortars, anti-tank weapon
launchers, air-to-ground rockets, anti-personnel mines, ammunition
and vehicle spares, said Jane's, a respected journal of military
affairs.
   The consignment was brought by the freighter Junda in the last
weeks of 1988 and unloaded at the port of Rama, up the Rio Escondido
from the Atlantic.
   Jane's said the six fast-attack craft will make Nicaragua's navy
the most powerful in Central America.
   Nicaragua already has two North Korean torpedo boats, eight
Soviet mine hunters and mine sweepers, and 14 Soviet, French, U.S.
and Israeli-made patrol boats, it said.

of Shibaa, an educator attached to the Lebanese Education Ministry.
The names of the other three men, also from Shibaa, were not
available.
   The Foreign Ministry said it would lodge a formal complaint with
the U.N. Security Council about deportations from the zone just
inside Lebanon, said to number 80 in the past month.
   Most of those deported allegedly refused to cooperate with
Israeli-sponsored administrations in their villages or defied orders
to join the South Lebanon Army, the predominantly Christian militia
that helps Israel patrol the zone.
   Members of the militia ambushed and killed three Palestinian
guerrillas during the night near Srobbine village five miles north
of the border, a security source said. No militia casualties were
reported, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   It was not clear whether the guerrillas were headed for Israel or
planned an attack within the security zone.
   Also in south Lebanon, the Red Cross evacuated nine seriously
wounded Shiite Moslem militiamen of the fundamentalist Hezbollah, or
Party of God, from the village of Jbaa.
   Reporters said the body of a Hezbollah fighter also was taken
from Jbaa, which was caught between warring Shiite militias and the
Israeli-patrolled zone.
   About 500 Hezbollah fighters were trapped in the mountain village
three weeks ago after the Syrian-backed Amal militia drove them from
surrounding areas.
   Four days ago Hezbollah and Amal signed an agreement in Damascus,
mediated by their sponsors Iran and Syria, to end a 9-month-old war
in which more than 600 people have been killed.
   Gen. Michel Aoun, head of Lebanon's Christian cabinet, returned
Thursday from three days of talks with an Arab League committee in
Tunis that failed to reconcile the rival Christian and Moslem
governments. He made no statement.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, head of the predominantly
Moslem cabinet, and Parliament speaker Hussein Husseini flew from
Tunis to Paris to meet with Lebanese leaders living in self-imposed
exile.
   Lebanon's constitutional crisis began in September when
Parliament could not agree on a successor to outgoing President Amin
Gemayel, a Maronite Catholic. By custom, Lebanon's president is
Christian, the prime minister Sunni Moslem and the Parliament
speaker Shiite Moslem.
   Sheik Sabah Jaber Sabah, foreign minister of Kuwait and chairman
of the Arab League committee, said in Cairo it would continue
seeking a solution, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency
reported.
   He spoke with reporters after briefing President Hosni Mubarak on
the Tunis meetings.

   Selection of a jury pool for Oliver L. North's
Iran-Contra trial reached the halfway point Thursday, with the judge
predicting the effort will take most of next week, too. He also
declared heatedly he won't allow ``security gurus'' to interrupt the
trial once it starts.
   As a ``housekeeping matter,'' chief trial prosecutor John Keker
told U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell he had been asked whether
four courtroom seats could be made available on a rotating basis to
the CIA, the Justice, Defense and State Departments and the National
Security Agency.
   Gesell reacted angrily. Getting the seats would be no problem, he
said, but he added:
   ``I'm very concerned about their function. I do not intend to
have this case run by two or three security gurus sitting in the
audience. I don't want to be in a position where every time a
document flashes by you go to these people who check with their
department.''
   Keker said he was only carrying a message. And he added, ``In
some ways the best thing for the trial is to let them see what is
happening.'' He said, ``I do not think it is their intention to
interfere with the trial.''
   Gesell said he would make the seats available, but that he would
work out ground rules for the agency representatives in private with
the lawyers in the case.
   By the end of the third day of selecting a pool of 50 potential
jurors, 18 women and 7 men had been qualified after painstaking,
often solicitous questioning by the judge and the lawyers in the
celebrated case.
   Among those chosen for the final cut were a woman who said she
only likes reading the horoscope and the comics, a woman who heard
something about shredding documents just before she turned off her
TV set and an unemployed office manager who heard North ``was
charged with selling something to Iran, but that didn't interest me
very much.''
   One of those selected was a government heating mechanic working
for the General Services Administration who had difficulty
recognizing North in the courtroom.
   ``I'm not sure if it's that guy who's constantly blinking. ... He
is just constantly winking,'' the prospective juror said when asked
by prosecutor John Keker whether he saw North in the courtroom.
   North, sitting across from the man on the other side of the room,
gave him a thumbs-up sign.
   ``I just don't want to be here,'' said one woman who works as a
staff assistant for the city government. ``I had that experience
before on jury duty and I just don't like it.''
   It turned out she was one of three people accepted in the morning
session.
   The others were a woman who worked for the Navy for 21 years and
a clerk typist at the Labor Department.
   Gesell, North lawyer Brendan Sullivan, and chief trial prosecutor
John Keker took turns at questioning prospective jurors who had said
on a written questionnaire that they had not watched, listened to or
read accounts of the Iran-Contra case.
   Repeatedly, Sullivan would ask whether just after the July 4
weekend in 1987 they remembered seeing North ``testifying in his
Marine uniform'' before the joint congressional committees
investigating the affair.
   ``He testified for six days in uniform, the TV was full of it,''
Sullivan told a government contract specialist. She replied that she
often watched a muted television set while listening to the radio.
   Judge and lawyers took pains to put the prospective jurors at
ease, commiserating with them about having to sit alone and answer
personal questions. Individual questioning sometimes took a half
hour.
   Throughout, North sat at the defense table, flanked by two of his
three lawyers. He appeared to pay rapt attention to the selection
process. Now a civilian, the former lieutenant colonel wore a dark
blue suit and subdued tie.
   Prospective jurors have been instructed not to read, watch or
listen to anything about the case.
   The former Navy employee, now a secretary, said she ``didn't even
turn the television'' on when she went home Wednesday night
``because if I had I would have had to tell a lie. I don't want to
go to jail.''
   She recalled hearing North's name mentioned earlier on
television, but not seeing him. Her knowledge of the case came from
her husband who thought North was ``somehow messing up.'' She said
she thought North's activities involved ``something about weapons
... selling weapons to the overseas people.''
   The court is looking for jurors who were largely unexposed to
North's testimony which dominated the nation's televison in
mid-1987. In his six days' apperance, the fired White House aide
discussed many activities for which he now faces criminal charges.
   North was granted immunity from being prosecuted on the basis of
that testimony and his lawyers say their client's rights against
self-incrimination would be jeopardized if jurors' deliberations
were colored by what they heard then. The office of independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh was required to gather information for the
criminal charges independently.
   North is accused of 12 crimes, including lying to Congress in
1985 and 1986 about his efforts on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras
and lying to the attorney general about the National Security
Council's role in diverting money from the Iran arms sales to the
Contras.
   He also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 security
system at his home from co-defendant Richard Secord, converting to
his own use at least $4,300 in traveler's checks from Contra leader
Adolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the government of tax
revenue by using a tax-exempt foundation to funnel money to the
Contras.

<TEXT>
   About 120 Aeroflot passengers, fed up with the
shoddy service of the Soviet Union's only airline, refused for hours
to leave a plane that landed before reaching their destination, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
   The passengers of Flight 357 from Moscow to Naberezhnye Chelny
waited overnight in a Moscow airport last week for the weather o
clear up so they could take off, the labor newspaper Trud said.
   The plane finally took off at 8:07 a.m. Jan. 24, but it landed
before reaching Naberezhnye Chelny, a town 500 miles east of Moscow
in the Tatar republic. The town formerly was called Brezhnev, after
late Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   The plane was held over, again because of poor weather, in Kazan,
about three hours by car from Naberezhnye Chelny. The passengers
were asked to get out and wait for another plane, but they refused,
Trud said.
   They demanded that Aeroflot provide a bus to take them to their
destination and that the airline refund part of the cost of their
tickets, the newspaper said.
   After much persuasion, airline officals were able to coax the
women and children off the plane, but 33 of the most stubborn
passengers held out for five hours.
   Even the chairman of the republic did his best to get the
passengers off, but they did not agree to disembark until the
airline gave in to their demands, Trud said.
   Aeroflot is the butt of jokes and ridicule in the Soviet Union
for its poor service and delays, but since it is the only carrier
that makes domestic flights, Soviets have no choice.
   On one recent flight, six Aeroflot passengers had to stand
throughout the trip because the flight had been overbooked.

<TEXT>
   Negotiations between NATO and Warsaw Pact
nations on manpower cuts in Central Europe concluded on Thursday
after more than 15 years of inconclusive bickering.
   Spokesmen for both military blocs underscored the positive
aspects of the talks, which comprised the first multilateral arms
reduction forum in postwar Europe.
   But negotiators even had trouble agreeing on a name for the
marathon parley, and the East rejected to the end the Western name
of Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction talks.
   The sides halted their efforts after they agreed in a separate
round of preparatory talks to begin the new Negotiations on
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe in Vienna on March 6.
   What the two sides did agree on was a joint dark blue tie, with
yellow symbols on a blue background symbolizing a sword being beaten
into a plowshare.
   The new talks, unlike the now-concluded conference that began in
October 1973, will involve all 23 member countries of the two
alliances and cover all of Europe ``from the Atlantic to the Urals.''
   The direct participants in the talks now concluded were East and
West Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Britain, Poland,
Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, the United States and Canada.
France did not take part.
   The Vienna negotiations failed because the two sides could not
concur on mutual troop strengths and methods to police an eventual
withdrawal.
   The sides released a brief joint communique that said, ``The
extent of common ground has proved to be insufficient to enable the
participants to agree on a treaty.
   ``Nevertheless, the positions of the two sides have converged on
a number of issues. The participants have gained valuable experience
and a clearer picture of what will be necessary to achieve mutually
agreeable and verifiable reductions and limitations of forces and
armaments in Europe,'' the statement said.
   The alliances refrained from the accusations characteristic of
earlier stages of the negotiations.
   Soviet Ambassador Valerian V. Mikhailov said ``a formidable
amount of useful work'' had been done but that ``the possibilities
to overcome'' differences ``seem to be exhausted.''
   He hailed Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's announcement to
withdraw 50,000 troops from East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary
by the end of 1990 and plans for reducing armies in several Warsaw
Pact countries.
   This ``unilateral major reduction,'' Mikhailov said, ``mostly
supercedes the very subject matter of the Vienna negotiations, which
proved to be unjustifiably narrow, and creates favorable prospects
for forthcoming negotiations...''
   Lambert W. Veenendaal, the Dutch ambassador speaking for the
North Atlantic alliance, said that the two sides had gathered ``a
wealth of experience and deeper insight in the complex issues of
conventional arms control.''
   He said the blocs had reached ``a large measure of agreement'' on
``general aims and principles,'' such as ``the aim of increased
stability at lower levels of forces, the commitment to limit forces
after reductions.''
   Veenendaal said some Western concepts had become ``common ground
during the negotiations.''
   He cited as examples ``the concepts of parity expressed in common
ceilings, collectivity, strict and effective verification and the
need to solve the problem of asymetries.''
   NATO officials on Monday denied Warsaw Pact claims that the
Western alliance maintains roughly the same number of conventional
forces in its European arsenal.
   NATO wants the East bloc to make make greater reductions in their
forces to bring the two sides to rough equality.

<HEAD>Convicted Felon: Sullivan Never Used Improper Influence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convicted Georgia official told the FBI that
his friend and associate, Health and Human Services
Secretary-designate Louis Sullivan, never tried to improperly
influence him, the official's lawyer said Thursday.
   Reginald Eaves, a suspended Fulton County, Ga., commissioner, was
asked about his relationship with Sullivan in a half-hour meeting
with the FBI earlier this week. The interview took place at the
federal prison where Eaves is serving a six-year sentence for
extortion, said his lawyer, Charles R. Floyd Jr., of Atlanta.
   Morehouse College School of Medicine, headed by Sullivan, paid
Eaves more than $34,000 as a lecturer over four years while Eaves
used his seat on the county commission to support measures that
benefited the Atlanta school.
   As Floyd recounted Eaves' FBI interview, ``He said that Sullivan
never sought to influence any of the decisions he had to make as a
commissioner, either as a result of his friendship or any other
position he might have had with Morehouse College.''
   ``They did probe whether he (Eaves) had negotiated his position
with the school through Sullivan directly, and he said he had not,''
Floyd said. Eaves also said that ``he was not sure whether Sullivan
was aware'' of his position with the school and that the two ``never
had any conversations regarding his (Eaves') position with
Morehouse,'' the lawyer said.
   Eaves told the FBI he has known Sullivan ``for some time,'' the
lawyer said. The two knew each other while undergraduates at
Morehouse College, he said.
   The White House, meanwhile, said it was working on a request by
Sullivan that he be allowed to maintain a relationship with the
medical school he founded, possibly through a paid sabbatical.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the request
``unusual,'' but Don Campbell, deputy director of the Office of
Government Ethics, told The Associated Press the office foresees no
problems with that issue or with Sullivan's finances.
   ``He and his attorneys were in here a week ago to discuss his
forms and there were just a couple of matters that came up,''
Campbell said. ``It's simply a matter now of getting the forms
written down, because all the problems have been worked out.''
   A government source familiar with Sullivan's situation said the
nominee had a specific written contract entitling him to certain
payments for a leave of absence. Because the contract is so precise
and was written ``quite some time'' before he was considered for a
federal job, the source said, a federal law prohibiting anyone from
supplementing the salary of a federal official would not apply.
   Campbell's statement also indicated lawyers had found a way to
avoid any conflicts between Sullivan's new job and federal aid to
Morehouse, which in fiscal 1988 amounted to $5.8 million from the
agency Sullivan will head.
   The White House earlier this week asked Congress to postpone
Sullivan's confirmation hearing, saying that the financial
disclosure statements and FBI background check were not completed.
   The FBI had no comment.
   A Sullivan transition source said the holdup on the nominee's
confirmation hearing may be because his nomination was one of the
last announced and because he is from outside the government, an
extensive background check is required.
   ``This is a cover-your-behind town,'' the source said.
   An official at Morehouse said Thursday he has been asked by the
FBI about Sullivan's connection to Eaves.
   ``They raised that among many, many issues,'' said Dr. James
Goodman, executive vice president of the medical school. ``They
talked to me about a range of issues about Dr. Sullivan's fitness
for the position (of HHS secretary), including that (Eaves) and many
other things.''
   He declined to identify the other issues.
   Goodman said he did not know how often Eaves lectured at the
school. Published reports said Eaves lectured only twice over four
years.
   Eaves was convicted last May on extortion charges. He was found
guilty of accepting $35,000 from an undercover FBI agent in exchange
for his vote on a zoning matter. He had been suspended from the
commission when he was indicted in October 1987.
   He was sentenced to six years in prison and fined $25,000. He is
confined at the federal prison at Maxwell Air Force Base in
Montgomery, Ala., while he appeals his case, Floyd said.
   One of the proposals Eaves pushed as a commissioner was to
increase Morehouse's participation at Grady Memorial Hospital. He
wanted the county hospital authority to allow Morehouse to provide
more patient care at Grady.
   J.W. Pinkston, executive director of Grady, said that the FBI had
contacted him and that other hospital administrators in the Atlanta
region have told him they also had been questioned by the FBI in a
background check on Sullivan.
   ``It was the usual inquiry. They did not ask for any documents
but asked routine questions, which were very appropriate,'' Pinkston
said. He declined to say what the FBI wanted to know.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Algeria will get a $58 million loan to fight
locusts threatening to destroy more than 190 million acres of crops
on land that has helped feed the Mediterranean area for more than
2,000 years, the World Bank announced Thursday.
   In ancient times, North Africa was the breadbasket of the Roman
empire. In Algeria now the locusts could ruin the livelihood of 12
million people. Other countries in the area are cooperating in the
fight against them.
   ``The plague could reach Europe or even South Asia if it is not
controled in North Africa,'' said Hasso Molineus, who deals with
Euorpe, the Middle East and North Africa at the bank.
   The loan will go to help pay for a $112 million project for
buying trucks and equipment and for spraying more than 15 million
acres over two years in central and southern Algeria. Planes,
specially equipped trucks and portable knapsack sprayers will be
used.
   Two years is the expected duration of the locust plague that
began in the Sudan and Mauretania in 1985 and has since swept across
the Sahara to the north. But a World Bank paper that published his
remarks added that the plague could go on for as long as 10 years.
   Molineus said that the locusts have also been around for
thousands of years and the current plague is one of the worst in
recent history.

<TEXT>
   Chicago millionaire Noah Robinson says he
beat the odds in his murder and conspiracy trial and will win again
in a retrial of those charges and in appeal of a 10-year prison term
for a felony conviction.
   Robinson, a Greenville native and half-brother of Jesse Jackson,
faced the death penalty on charges he hired members of a Chicago
street gang to murder a childhood friend and former employee who had
harassed him.
   ``In an absolute sense, I'm not happy,'' he said in a telephone
interview Wednesday night with The Associated Press from Chicago.
``In a relative sense I'm better off today than I was last week, and
I thank God for that.
   Robinson was freed from jail Monday on a $1.1 million bond.
   ``I could have been facing 85 years and the electric chair.
Tonight, I'm in Chicago with my family after being away almost six
months, with the opportunity for another day to clear my name if the
state decides to seek a retrial,'' said Robinson, whose businesses
include a chain of fast-food restaurants.
   A state Circuit Court jury in Greenville convicted Robinson
Saturday of accessory after the fact of assault and battery with
intent to kill in connection with the attempted murder of Janice
Desmond Rosemond.
   Circuit Judge James Moore declared a mistrial after the jury
failed to reach a verdict on the murder and conspiracy charges
Robinson faced in the death of Leroy ``Hambone'' Barber and two
other charges in the Rosemond case.
   But he sentenced Robinson to the maximum prison term for the
accessory felony conviction.
   Robinson, 45, was accused of hiring someone to kill Ms. Rosemond,
who witnessed the 1986 murder of Barber in Greenville. Ms. Rosemond
survived a stabbing attack.
   Robinson said Wednesday he would not discuss details of the
Barber case.
   A former employee of Robinson's, Freddie Sweeney, testified that
Robinson offered him $5,000 to kill Ms. Rosemond because she
reportedly testified about Barber's murder before a grand jury in
Chicago.
   Solicitor Joe Watson will make the decision on when to try
Robinson again on the murder charge.
   Watson was out of town Thursday and would not return to his
office until next week, his office said.
   One of Robinson's attorney, Pat Paschal, said the defense filed a
notice of appeal Monday.
   ``I think there's no question that once we've been through this
trial we're in a better position now that we know the accusations of
the key witnesses,'' he said Thursday.

   The administration said Thursday that Secretary
of State James A. Baker's status as chief foreign policy adviser to
President Bush will not be affected by a revamping of operations in
the White House National Security Council.
   ``These changes are procedural and they were all worked out with
Secretary Baker at the State Department and they don't really
reflect very much of a change _ they don't reflect any change,
actually, in terms of who's in and who's out and proportion of
responsibility,'' said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Under the plan, Brent Scowcroft, the president's national
security adviser, and his deputy, Robert M. Gates, will serve as
chairmen of two high-level groups that will meet on a daily basis to
review national security and foreign policy issues, Fitzwater said.
   The groups will replace the dozens of interagency groups set up
during the Reagan administration to deal with specific problems.
``Essentially, it's just a different management style that they feel
more comfortable with,'' Fitzwater said.
   On another point, Fitzwater said Bush wants to hold down the
membership of the NSC. By law, its members include only the
president, vice president, secretary of state and secretary of
defense. Frequently, however, presidents designate other people as
members.
   ``I know the president does want to hold down the membership,
just as he has in the Cabinet as well as in other areas,'' Fitzwater
said.
   The NSC is not intended as a policy-making body although it has
become that at times. Instead, it is designed to be an advisory
panel for the president on national security policy.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Customs Halts Chemical Shipment To Libya</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BREMERHAVEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Customs officials stopped a
shipment of chemicals bound for Libya to determine whether they
could be used to produce explosives or poison gas, a Bremerhaven
newspaper reported Thursday.
   The Nordsee Zeitung said customs officials refused to authorize
loading of the chemical hexamethylene tetramine for shipment to
Libya, which has a chemical plant at Rabta the United States says is
capable of producing chemical weapons. Libya says it is a
pharmaceutical plant.
   ``Customs officials stopped the shipment in connection with
suspicions that West German firms may have been involved in the
suspected Libyan poison gas factory,'' the newspaper said in a telex
of its report to other news media late Thursday.
   It said the containers had proper loading papers and the contents
corresponded to the shipping documents, but customs halted the
shipment as a precaution to determine whether they required a
government export license.
   The chemical can be used to make explosives as well as medicine
and fertilizer, and also emits a toxic gas when ignited, the paper
said.
   According to the Nordsee Zeitung, the shipment was from Degussa
AG in Frankfurt. It quoted company officials as saying the shipment
did not require a government permit.
   ``We have been exporting this chemical for years to a Libyan
fertilizer factory that uses it to enhance the effectiveness of
natural wastes,'' the company was quoted as saying in a statement.
   Degussa's offices were closed Thursday night and company
officials could not be reached by The Associated Press.
   West German officials are investigating several companies in
connection with the Libyan factory.
   On Wednesday, prosecutors investigating a West German company
suspected of a central role in the plant's construction asked Swiss
authorities for help in locating the firm's records.
   Prosecutors in Offenburg asked Swiss officials for help in a
search for Imhausen-Chemie company records, which news reports said
were taken to Switzerland several months ago.
   Imhausen-Chemie of Lahr in the Black Forest region is under
criminal investigation to determine whether it violated export laws
in with deliveries for the Libyan plant.
   Several other West German companies have acknowledged doing work
for Imhausen-Chemie but deny knowing their equipment and blueprints
were destined for Libya.

   A 3-year-old boy torn from his mother and used as
a human shield during a gang shootout is the latest casualty in a
plague of innocent bystanders being drawn into the city's violence.
   Greg Alvarez, 3, was wounded while walking along with his mother
in a Brooklyn housing project on Wednesday when he was thrust into
the middle of what apparently was a drug-related dispute.
   After surgery Greg was in critical but stable condition, a
hospital official said.
   Three young bystanders were killed in Brooklyn during the first
three weeks of this year. Authorities say an increase in guns and
the smokable cocaine derivative crack have made the streets more
dangerous.
   ``Awful things have always happened, but not in the same
numbers,'' said Anthony Bouza, a former assistant police chief in
the Bronx, who recently retired as police chief in Minneapolis.
   ``That someone would pick up a 3-year-old and use him as a shield
is not surprising, not given the current conditions on the street,''
said Thomas Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission of
New York City, a private watchdog agency.
   ``You have a band of criminals out there who just don't care who
they hit,'' Reppetto added.
   The New York City Police Department does not keep statistics on
the killing or wounding of innocent bystanders, said Assistant Chief
Raymond W. Kelly.
   But in 1988, at least 18 innocent New Yorkers were killed by
bullets intended for someone else, and at least 49 others were
wounded, according to figures compiled by The New York Daily News.
   The killings and woundings of bystanders is due to a change in
traditional attitudes towards human life, the introduction of crack,
and the wide availability of weapons, according to Lawrence W.
Sherman, a professor of criminology at the University of Maryland
and the president of the Crime Control Institute.
   Those factors, ``combined with drug markets in densely populated
places, there's a high chance an innocent bystander will get hit,''
Sherman said.
   Drug gunmen on the street call the victims ``mushrooms'' _ people
who pop up unexpectedly in the line of fire.
   The 3-year-old was walking alongside his mother, Modesta Alvarez,
who was pushing a younger son in a stroller at 12:35 p.m. when the
shooting broke out.
   Two groups of teen-agers, handguns blazing, shot at each other as
they ran through the housing project in the East New York section.
One of the teens, Eric Casseus, 18, who was also struck by one of
the bullets, was later arrested and charged with having used the
toddler as a shield.
   Most of the incidents where innocents become victims occur in
poor neighborhoods such as East New York, and a disproportionate
number of the victims are black or Hispanic.
   The traditional ``rules of the street,'' which frowned on the
wounding or killing of bystanders, particularly women and children,
``is being stood on its head; the fact you challenge these
traditional rules show what a hard man you are,'' Sherman added.
   ``Now, you have tremendously sophisticated weapons out there, you
have drugs,'' Bouza said. ``If you look at the murder rate, it used
to be people who knew each other, now strangers are killing each
other.''

<HEAD>Trade School Banned from Federal Aid for Truck-Driving Course</HEAD>

   Education Department officials said Thursday
they have banned an Indianapolis-based trade school from
participating in federal student aid programs for courses such as a
truck-driving correspondence course.
   The non-appealable action against Superior Training Services Inc.
came five months after the Justice Department filed a $366 million
suit charging the school defrauded the aid programs.
   Kenneth Whitehead, assistant education secretary for
postsecondary education, said Superior misrepresented its course
offerings eight years ago when it applied to participate in federal
student loan and grant programs.
   ``They are not now and have never been eligible,'' Whitehead
said. He said the students did not get the training and service they
signed up for.
   Whitehead said the school had pegged its tuition to the maximum
available to students under federal aid programs and ``padded their
courses'' in order to meet the required number of hours for
truck-driving correspondence courses that had a short residential
site training component.
   Depending on the type of aid, the courses are supposed to total
300 or 600 hours, Whitehead said. ``The lessons would have had to
average 10 hours apiece'' to qualify, he said. ``I did four of those
lessons and in each case it took less than an hour.''
   The Indianapolis-based Superior, a subsidiary of Continental
Training Services, Inc., operates a correspondence school in Phoenix
and training sites in Arizona, Indiana, California, Texas, Illinois
and Pennsylvania. The school also has branch campuses, not involved
in student aid programs, in Pennsylvania, Texas, Indiana and Florida.
   The Education Department said Superior has enrolled close to
100,000 students since 1980 and receives virtually all of its
revenues from tuition income, 95 percent of which is obtained by
students through Pell grants and guaranteed student loans.
   Rodger Murphey, an Education Department spokesman, said the
school is still eligible to participate in U.S. financial aid
programs for the residential courses it offers.
   Ward Degler, director of advertising and public relations for
Superior Training, said in Indianapolis that the affected
correspondence course was a combination of home study and driver
training and that the school's other courses were not affected by
the suspension.
   ``Regardless of what the Department of Education says, we're
pursuing every legal avenue available to us to reverse this,
primarily because due process was absent, because it is unfair to
not just Superior, but to literally thousands of students that are
currently studying with us and on behalf of the entire proprietary
school industry,'' he said.
   About 20,000 students a year take the correspondence course,
Whitehead said. Sample tasks in a lesson plan include calculating a
car's gas mileage and making hotel reservations to visit the
Superior school.
   Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos said such a ``lesson plan''
was ``an insult to those in this country dedicated to training
individuals to perform needed tasks.''
   Degler said the school was talking with the department about
extending the course to satisfy the department. He said the
allegations about hotel reservations and gas mileage were
``ludicrous.''
   ``Superior Training School has been in business for 15 years, the
last eight years we've been accredited by the National Association
of Trade and Technical Schools and National Home Study Council,'' he
said.
   An increasing proportion of federal aid is going to the
burgeoning number of proprietary or trade schools. For Pell grants
the figure was 27 percent last year, and department officials have
said they expect it to rise to 33 percent in the early 1990s.

   Jim Wright, in his two years as speaker of the
House, has become accustomed to acting as a lightning rod for
criticism. The storm over a proposed $45,500 congressional pay raise
is subjecting him to his toughest test yet.
   This time, the current is being turned up by disc jockeys around
the country giving out Wright's phone number on the air, by
opponents who have generated an outpouring of tea bags mailed to
lawmakers and by editorial writers in Wright's hometown who have
excoriated the speaker.
   There even was a hunger strike aimed at Wright being staged on
the Capitol steps by a local insurance salesman who said he is
expressing the outrage of most Americans over the pay boost.
   ``They can justify it to themselves,'' said Bob Walters, 37, of
Gaithersburg, Md., who said he had not eaten in five days. ``But the
ones they have to justify it to are the people who are paying for
it.''
   The outpouring of public sentiment against the salary hike has
forced Wright, a Texas Democrat, to back away from his original plan
to let the full 50 percent increase go into effect without a vote.
   Senior House Democrats said that move was a sign of panic by the
speaker and may have damaged his standing with colleagues. ``Members
are turned off by the way he's handled it,'' said one, who spoke
only on condition of anonymity. ``This has permanently hurt Wright.''
   But the speaker brushed it all off as routine. ``Taking the heat
is part of the game plan around here,'' he said. ``It's somewhat
continuous.''
   First, in an apparent effort to spread the blame, Wright sent out
a questionnaire this week to colleagues asking whether they wanted
to vote on the issue. Aides said Wright was tired of reading that he
was imposing his will on House members who wanted to vote on the
issue, when members were telling him otherwise in private.
   But the move was received coolly even by those on his own
leadership team. ``I'm not dealing with the survey,'' said
Democratic whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., when asked about it.
   Then on Thursday, Wright said he will ask lawmakers to vote next
week on a package to pare back the pay raise to $26,850 and ban
speaking fees and restrict other outside income.
   Many House colleagues were privately critical, saying it is
Wright's role as speaker to take the heat for colleagues on matters
such as the pay raise, and that the new plan will leave them with no
increase in pay. For lawmakers who now collect the maximum in
speaking fees, the raise would be offset by the cut in honoraria
income.
   The critics, members of both parties, all of whom declined to be
quoted by name, complained that Wright had been unable to withstand
the heat even though he is politically secure in his Fort Worth,
Texas, congressional district and was unopposed in the last election.
   It remained unclear whether the resentment would be lasting, and
whether Wright's position would be weakened by the controversy.
   ``He's always had difficulty with this issue,'' said one
Democratic leadership aide, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity. The reference was to a House vote to decline a $12,100
pay raise in 1987 that was meaningless because Wright scheduled it
the day after the raise took effect.
   But if Wright's strategy works, the aide said, all will be
forgotten. ``Winning's the only defense,'' he said.
   Wright, since he took the spaker's chair in 1987, has been almost
constantly immersed in controversy. On his first day in the post he
made comments advocating a tax increase that drew immediate fire. A
few months later, he drew the ire of Republicans by holding open a
budget vote tally until he could persuade a fellow Texan to change
his vote and enable the Democrats to win.
   More recently, Wright has been the subject of two separate ethics
investigations _ one into whether he abused his office for financial
gain, and another on whether he improperly disclosed a secret CIA
operation in Nicaragua. Both of those cases remain open.
   But the consensus on Capitol Hill was that the pay raise issue
had been hotter for Wright than any of the previous controversies,
and there were hints that it might persist well after next week's
action.
   ``I can assure you that a vote of the nature the speaker
envisions won't be the last one on this issue in this Congress,''
said Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, a leading pay raise opponent.

<HEAD>FCC Commissioner Says Rules Needed on Phone Companies, Cable TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FCC Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis said
Thursday the government must establish rules to assure that a
``cornucopia'' of video, voice and data material will flow into
American households over high-technology telephone lines.
   Though Dennis expressed reservations about the ways telephone
companies might compete in the cable television arena, she said it
was time to end an era of ``television of scarcity'' in which a few
companies offer a limited amount of programming.
   She said she looked forward to the day when Americans will have
access to an unlimited number of two-way or ``interactive''
entertainment, educational and communications signals carried into
their homes by lasers on telephone fiber optic cables.
   ``It is my job to think about what kind of networks we want for
the future,'' she told a luncheon audience at Federal Communications
Commmission headquarters. ``What kinds of demands are really
ultimately going to be placed on a telephone network or cable system
which starts providing two-way interactive (services)? And I don't
think that we can seriously say it's going to be plain ol' voice
(telephones) any longer.''
   She said regulations must be structured ``so that this cornucopia
of services will blossom _ just not video programming and video on
demand but interactive services for educational purposes, medical
purposes.''
   The FCC voted tentatively last year to seek public comment on a
possible recommendation that Congress allow telephone companies to
enter the cable TV business, repealing laws that ban such entry.
   Dennis said it was important to make sure that telephone
companies would not be able to use their enormous resources to
squeeze cable operators out of the market, either through exclusive
programming or by simply buying up the competition.
   Telephone companies should be required to build cable systems,
and thus they would utilize the potential of fiber optics, she said.
   Also, if phone companies are allowed to provide their own
programming, she said, they must be required to carry other
companies' programs for reasonable fees.
   She advocated an approach in which cable programming ``stores''
would pay to have their products displayed in phone company
``shopping malls.''
   ``We've got a store right now, and that store is operated by the
cable company and they decide what products go in and where the
shelf will be and who gets to be the providers of services within
that store,'' she said.
   ``What I would like to see is just not another competing store
with the telephone companies offering video services but perhaps a
shopping mall opened up. That's what fiber really allows us to do
because it has such high capacity. If the telephone companies come
in as common carriers then lots of stores will be able to occupy
space in that shopping mall and the consumer will be better off
because then the consumer will have an abundance of choice,'' Dennis
said.
   She said a major issue was whether or not the phone companies got
to open their own ``store'' in the ``shopping mall'' and offer their
products and programs over their telephone lines.
   She said if the phone companies operate the mall _ the phone
lines _ ``and they've also got a store they might turn off the
lights for everybody else and keep only their light on so that's the
only one that the consumers would have access to.''
   Another concern was cross-subsidization in which telephone
companies would use telephone revenues to finance cable operations,
or vice versa. She said telephone users shouldn't have to pay more.
   She said of Congress, ``If we can set the landscape and carefully
structure it so that the twin evils of discrimination and
cross-subsidization are avoided or are at least contained well, then
they will listen. I`m hopeful that we will get a very good
reception.''

<TEXT>
   Carlos Andres Perez was sworn in as
president on Thursday and called on the United States to help
Central America achieve peace and economic stability.
   Perez, 67, was inaugurated during ceremonies that drew hundreds
of dignitaries, including Vice President Dan Quayle and Cuban leader
Fidel Castro.
   Perez received the red, blue and yellow presidential sash from
his predecessor, Jaime Lusinchi, who presided over the oil-exporting
nation during a period that saw its standard of living drop with the
plunge in petroleum prices.
   The five-year term is Perez' second. The constitution limits
presidents to a single term, after which they must wait a decade
before seeking re-election.
   Perez first took office in 1974, the year after the Arab oil
embargo sent oil prices soaring. He nationalized Venezuela's oil
industry in 1976.
   In his speech, Perez promised major economic reforms and pledged
to work with the United States to seek peace in the region.
   ``The new United States government has the immense and
challenging possibility of seeing (Latin America) as an area open to
fruitful dialogue,'' Perez told the 2,000 world leaders, diplomats
and politicians in his televised address.
   ``We hope to work together to contribute to a definitive solution
to the problem of the (foreign) debt as well as a peaceful,
respectful and promising solution for the Central American
situation, the recovery of democracy in Panama and the normalization
of inter-American relations.''
   Perez supports a peace pact adopted by the five Central American
nations in August 1986 calling for democratization and an end to
outside military aid.
   The plan has been hamstrung by Reagan administration support for
Contra rebels seeking to overthrow the leftist government in
Nicaragua.
   In meetings here this week, Honduras and Nicaragua exchanged
views on how to move forward with the plan through new proposals
more acceptable to President Bush.
   `The possibility of a fruitful encounter between the U.S. and
Latin America will be strengthened if we are recognized as solid
friends rather than subordinates. I have expressed this to President
George Bush,'' Perez said.
   The new president is also promoting a ``common framework'' for
Latin countries to achieve easier terms to repay their $420 billion
foreign debt, a major factor behind the region's economic troubles.
   Venezuela, the fourth-largest Latin American debtor, recently
suspended principal payments on much of its $32 billion foreign debt
and is involved in talks with the International Monetary Fund to
obtain billions of dollars of new loans.
   ``The responsibility for definitive solutions falls equally on
the United States, the other industrialized nations and Latin
America,'' Perez said.
   He said his economic program, to be announced ``in the next few
days,'' will include a currency devaluation, higher domestic
interest rates, price increases and higher public service charges.

<HEAD>U.S. Drug Agency Reports Big Cocaine Seizure by Police in Colombia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police in Colombia have seized cocaine labs at
a ranch with enough chemicals to produce 40,000 to 50,000 kilograms
of cocaine, the Drug Enforcement Administration said Thursday.
   The raids by the Colombian National Police over the past few days
netted 1,200 kilograms of cocaine base as well as thousands of
gallons of chemicals needed to produce finished cocaine
hydrochloride, but produced no arrests, said DEA spokesman Bill Deac.
   ``Usually, all you get at the labs are small fry, unless you get
a chemist,'' Deac said.
   David L. Westrate, DEA's assistant administrator for operations,
lauded the seizures.
   ``This may be as large or larger than the Tranquilandia site
seized in 1984 and we are extremely pleased with the aggressive law
enforcement action taken by our colleagues in the Colombian National
Police,'' Westrate said.
   The raids targeted a ranch called the Finca Iglesias Vereda La
Danta in Antioquia, which is 100 miles from Medellin, the base of
the Medellin cartel that U.S. officials believe has been responsible
for much of the cocaine brought into the United States.
   The Colombian National Police raided the 17 buildings at the
ranch starting Jan. 28, said DEA spokesman Maurice Hill.
   ``These labs hadn't yet gotten to the stage of actually producing
cocaine,'' said Deac.
   In the March 1984 Tranquilandia raids, which Deac described as
the record cocaine seizure in history, 22,000 pounds of cocaine were
seized, including 18,700 pounds of pure cocaine hydrochloride,
``ready to be exported,'' and 3,300 pounds of cocaine base, he said.

<HEAD>Timothy Leary Unrepentant About Advocating Drug Use In 1960s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A block from Harvard Yard, one of the
university's most notorious former professors is the top act at a
comedy club. But Timothy Leary said Thursday his new career is
simply an extension of his work in academia.
   His message, he said, is no different than it was in the 1960s,
when he was known as an LSD guru:
   ``T.F.Y.Q.A. _ Think for yourself, question authority,'' said
Leary. He added that he does not regret advocating drug use then and
blames the government for the current drug crisis.
   ``I'm a performing philosopher,'' said Leary prior to his
appearance at Catch a Rising Star. ``The performance I give at a
club is no different from what I once said in class. Without getting
heavy, comedy has taken over from rock 'n' roll as the first line of
dissent these days.''
   But Leary doesn't really call his act comedy; he terms it a
``lecture.'' That may be fortunate, since area newspapers almost
universally panned his performances. Leary, however, said he is only
concerned with making audiences think for themselves.
   ``I throw out an enormous amount of ideas,'' said Leary. ``I
strafe and strobe the audience. I throw them curveballs, fastballs,
I make them think.''
   Leary, 69, was fired from his job as a psychology professor at
Harvard in 1963 after his drug experimentation. He now lives with
his fifth wife in Beverly Hills, Calif., and dabbles in educational
computer software while making occasional forays on the comedy
nightclub circuit to ``pay the bills.''
   In his act, Leary tells the audience, ``I'm a little
brain-damaged _ you know that.'' But he claims that, in reality,
drug use has sharpened him.
   ``I'm much better at my job of being a performing philosopher,''
he said. ``I feel I have one of the most efficient minds on the
planet. I see much more clearly.''
   Leary maintains that he never advocated anything but the
``precise and proper'' use of recreational drugs for the purposes of
mind expansion.
   ``If the government had followed my opinion not to have drugs
something we should be persecuted for and instead use them as part
of medical education we would not have a drug problem,'' Leary said.
``We never talked about lumping LSD with cocaine.''
   Leary said he regrets that some LSD users committed suicide or
harmed themselves.
   ``We were deeply concerned that even one person might have been
hurt by self-medication,'' he said.
   But he believes the negative publicity about taking LSD and other
hallucinogens in the 1960s overshadows what he considers a real
tragedy.
   ``I have to look at the comparative statistics,'' he said. ``The
real casualties in the '60s were the men who died in Vietnam and
those who were psychologically crippled by the war. If you want to
talk about flashbacks, the Vietnam flashbacks (experienced by
veterans) are 50,000 times worse.''
   Leary no longer advocates using LSD since ``you can no longer get
it pure,'' but said he still ``medicates myself'' if he feels like
it. He said he and his second wife took the drug ecstasy a few days
before their wedding.
   Leary said he is happy, though he is often broke and lives ``like
a graduate student worrying about how to pay the rent.''
   ``You may hate me ... but at least you always know where I
stand,'' he said.

   A judge has ruled that a lesbian couple's
dispute over custody of a child they raised together can proceed to
trial, in a case that tests a mostly uncharted area of family law, a
lawyer said.
   ``At the heart of it are fundamental concepts of family, equality
and the right of persons who are lesbian to have access to their
children,'' attorney Gloria Allred said Wednesday.
   The lawsuit arises at a time when lesbian partners increasingly
are arranging to have children, either by adoption or artificial
insemination.
   Allred's client, Terri Sabol, 32, of Long Beach, is seeking legal
joint custody of a 2-year-old girl who was born to Sabol's
then-partner.
   The couple conceived the child through artificial insemination,
using sperm donated by a relative of Ms. Sabol's, Ms. Allred said in
a telephone interview.
   When the couple broke up, the 29-year-old mother, who was not
identified, allegedly began to restrict Ms. Sabol's time with the
girl and refused to permit Ms. Sabol to participate in parental
decisions.
   Ms. Sabol sued on Nov. 29 to establish her rights as a parent.
   ``We asked the court to recognize that this was a family,
although not a traditional one, and that it would be unfair to
deprive our client of contact with the child,'' Ms. Allred said.
   The mother's attorney, Mitchell Jacobs, responded by seeking to
dismiss the case in a legal motion known as a demurrer, which argues
that the court has no legal authority to consider the claim.
   But on Monday, Superior Judge Richard E. Denner overruled the
defendant's motion, allowing the case to proceed to determine if Ms.
Sabol has a legal right to joint legal and physical custody. No
trial date has been scheduled.
   ``My client has no comment on the case,'' Jacobs said after the
decision.
   Ms. Sabol expressed relief at the ruling and said she had not had
contact with the child for three months.
   ``There are literally thousands of people now in my situation ...
but there are no laws protecting us,'' she said in a telephone
interview.
   The court has sealed records in the case, according to a bailiff
for Denner.
   Roberta Achtenberg, directing attorney of the Lesbian Rights
Project in San Francisco, said she was aware of a half-dozen similar
cases in California in recent years, as well as a few in New York.
However, there is ``no controlling legal precedent'' because no case
has ever reached appellate level, she said.
   To gain a court hearing, a parental custody claim typically must
cite a recognized legal relationship to the child, usually by a
dissolution of marriage or paternity claim, Ms. Achtenberg said. But
neither claim is available to a lesbian parent.
   Without specific guidance from the legislature, said Ms.
Achtenberg, ``The courts have gotten stuck over their authority to
hear a claim by a person who is not related to the mother, and who
is not related to the child.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Merger Delayed Again</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Thursday ordered a new
delay in the imminent partial merger of The Detroit News and the
Detroit Free Press.
   The U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
said the newspapers could not proceed with their planned combination
of business and production departments, which was scheduled to occur
Feb. 6.
   The delay was requested by opponents of the joint operating
agreement.
   A three-judge panel of the appeals court last Friday rejected
arguments by Michigan Citizens for an Independent Press, a
500-member consortium of newspaper advertisers and readers.
   The Newspaper Preservation Act requires one of the newspapers to
be facing the likelihood of financial failure without combination
with a healthier competitor.
   The consortium contended that former Attorney General Edwin Meese
had distorted the law in approving a partial exemption from federal
antitrust laws for the newspapers last August.
   The court, in ordering the delay, didn't say when the merger
could proceed, but said it must wait until there is a decision on
opponents' request for a rehearing on the issue.
   Gannett Co. Inc., owner of The News, had no immediate comment on
the court action, said Sheila Gibbons, a spokeswoman at company
headquarters in Arlington, Va.
   ``This is surely a disappointment, but I hope only a temporary
interruption toward assuring a future for this newspaper,'' Free
Press publisher David Lawrence said in a statement.
   ``After almost three years, the way we have learned to survive is
to be patient and to hope that finally what is right and justified _
the JOA _ will occur,'' the statement said.
   The newspapers applied for the joint operating agreement 1986,
saying the Free Press was in danger of closing without the merger.
The two papers, the ninth- and 10th-largest in the nation, say they
lost a combined total of $155.7 million between 1981 and 1987.
   Knight-Ridder has threatened to sell the Free Press if the merger
is denied.
   Opponents contend Detroit can support both newspapers, and asked
the court to order a hearing by all 13 appeals judges because of the
extraordinary legal issues raised in the case. They argue that the
newspapers would suffer little harm as a result of the delay.
   In papers filed with the Washington court this week, the Free
Press said the JOA was ready to move ahead.
   ``It would be patently unfair to bring these activities to a halt
because (opponents) cavalierly and belatedly seek a new hearing,''
the Free Press' attorneys said.
   John Kelly, a Michigan state senator who spearheaded opposition
to the partial merger, said Thursday afternoon from his Lansing
office that the newspapers acted prematurely to combine their
business operations.
   ``My reaction is that it's comparable to the Soviet Army
confronting a small group of Afghan guerrillas. They had the
firepower, they had the high tech and they were defeated once
again,'' he said.
   ``They moved ahead without trying to think through the human
consequences. For whatever trauma they've caused their own
employees, they bear the guilt for,'' Kelly said.

<HEAD>Convicted Terrorists Begin Coordinated Hunger Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities fear that a hunger
strike by 38 jailed leftist terrorists could lead to a new wave of
attacks, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office said
Thursday.
   The hunger strike began Wednesday when 28 imprisoned members of
the Red Army Faction refused to take food. Ten more imprisoned
terrorists joined the action Thursday, spokesman Alexander Prechtel
said.
   The hunger strikers, in 12 different prisons across the country,
are demanding to be jailed together and other concessions.
   ``As you know, all previous hunger strikes were accompanied by
terrorist acts,'' Prechtel said when asked if authorities feared
another wave of terrorist attacks by Red Army Faction sympathizers
still at large.
   Prechtel spoke in a telephone interview from his office in
Karlsruhe.
   The Red Army Faction, the country's most notorious terrorist
group, has carried out numerous bomb attacks and assassinations
targeted at the U.S. military and West Germany's business and
government leaders.
   The hunger strike brought the Red Army Faction group back into
the headlines after a relative lull in terrorist actions in recent
months.
   Some leftist politicians have begun a debate among West Germans
by urging authorities to start a dialogue with the group in an
attempt to get it to move away from terrorism.
   Several Red Army Faction members have been pardoned recently
after renouncing terrorism.
   Prechtel said only three convicted members of the group who have
distanced themselves from terrorism and who may come under
consideration for a presidential pardon have not joined the strike.
   He said authorities have not determined what targets, if any,
could be attacked by Red Army Faction sympathizers.
   Prechtel recalled that the start of the hunger strike coincided
with the fourth anniversary of the slaying of Munich industrialist
Ernst Zimmermann by a Red Army Faction commando.
   After Zimmermann's murder, 37 jailed Red Army Faction terrorists
announced they were giving up their 60-day hunger strike.
   That hunger strike was the longest of the nine similar actions
carried out before the latest fast.
   Convicted terrorist Holger Meins died in 1974 after a hunger
strike in prison, and Red Army Faction member Sigurd Debus died in
1981 after a fast.
   The latest action appears to be designed to avoid deaths.
According to a statement by a Red Army faction prisoner printed in a
newspaper, the group will fast for two weeks. After that, the hunger
strike will be continued by two members of the group rotating every
two weeks.
   The letter, signed for the group by Helmut Pohl, said the jailed
Red Army Faction members were demanding to be imprisoned together in
one or two groups.
   They are also demanding freedom for four jailed Red Army Faction
members whose health the group claims has been damaged in prison.
The group is also demanding ``free political communication'' with
all social groups and unrestricted medical care outside police
supervision.
   The statement signed by Pohl, who is serving a life sentence, was
published in the leftist West Berlin newspaper TAZ. Pohl was
convicted in a 1981 car bombing at the U.S. Air Force headquarters
at Ramstein that injured 18 people.
   Among those on the latest hunger strike are such notorious
terrorists as Brigitte Mohnhaupt, Guenther Sonnenberg, Giesela
Dutzi, Eva Sybille Haule-Frimpong and Christian Klar.
   All are serving either life sentences or long prison terms after
being convicted for murders, bomb attacks and other terrorist acts.

<HEAD>Teacher Contract Dispute Escalates With Grade-Withholding Threat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers are threatening to withhold grades to
force resolution of a contract dispute, prompting hundreds of
students to walk out of class Thursday as parents considered a
lawsuit.
   The dispute between the Los Angeles Unified School District's
32,000 teachers and the Board of Education also has led to talk of a
strike.
   The students walked out of classes at several high schools to
support the teachers' wage demands and to demand that quarterly
grades due Friday be reported on official district forms.
   Thousands of students have staged similar demonstrations since
mid-January, although not all have been in support of the teachers
and some apparently have been only a way to cut class.
   The teachers union, United Teachers Los Angeles, plans to have
members give students their midterm grades on a union report card
rather than officially report them to the district after exams
Friday.
   District Superintendent Leonard Britton has threatened to
withhold paychecks if the teachers hold back grade reports.
   One group of parents is exploring the possibility of suing the
teachers or the district, or both, if grades aren't officially
reported.
   The teachers, who have been without a contract since June 1988,
have asked for a one-year pay raise of 12 percent; the district
offered 17.4 percent over three years. During an unsuccessful
bargaining session Sunday, union President Wayne Johnson proposed
pay hikes of 11 percent in the first year, followed by 10 percent in
the second year.
   Johnson proposed at a news conference Thursday that the seven
elected members of the Board of Education meet with union leaders to
resolve the dispute. That would leave the superintendent and the
district's negotiator out of the negotiating process.
   The Board of Education had no immediate response to the proposal,
said spokeswoman Tammy Sims.
   The average teacher salary at the district's 825 schools and
centers is $36,600. Starting teachers earn $23,440. The maximum
salary, based on number of years and a doctorate degree, is $43,319.
   Some high school seniors are worried that their college
applications could be affected if the official grades are withheld.
   But UTLA spokesman Don Schrack said Thursday that applications to
most colleges and universities would not be affected because less
than 1 percent require mid-year grade reports. He also contended
that any grade report accompanied by a credentialed teacher's
signature is official in California.
   UTLA made the first moves toward a possible stike on Wednesday,
when its 50 directors voted to ask that the union's 400-member House
of Representatives approve a strike-authorization vote by the
membership.
   However, Schrack said the union president would do everything to
avoid a strike. The union last went on strike in 1970.
   He characterized the teachers' pay demand as lower on the list of
their concerns than implementation of a ``school-based management
concept'' that would allow greater teacher involvement in improving
the educational process in the district, which has 594,800 students.
   Teachers also are concerned about reorganizing the district's
financial priorities to provide more educational materials, he said.
In addition, he said, the teachers want to be relieved of unpaid
duties such as schoolyard monitoring to give them more time in the
classroom.

<UNK>Protestants and Catholics Hold Secret Talks on Power Sharing, BBC
Reports</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Protestant and Roman Catholic politicians from
Northern Ireland met secretly in West Germany, a participant
reported Thursday, and the BBC said they were exploring the
possibility of a joint provincial government.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said the politicians met Oct.
14-15 at the Angerhof Hotel between Duesseldorf and Duisburg and
unanimously agreed they wanted to be partners in governing the
troubled British province.
   It said the talks could produce the most important political
breakthrough since sectarian violence in the Protestant-dominated
province flared in August 1969. Meetings have continued in Northern
Ireland since October, it said.
   Catholic and Protestant party leaders who were not at the talks
divorced themselves from the report. John Hume, the province's
leading Catholic politician, called the BBC version ``nonsense.''
   James Molyneaux of the Official Unionist Party and Ian Paisley of
the hard-line Democratic Unionists, Northern Ireland's two main
Protestant leaders, also denied the report.
   Peter Robinson, who the BBC said was a Protestant representative,
had been Paisley's chief lieutenant but apparently has taken a more
independent position recently.
   Deputy leader Gordon Mawhinney of the Alliance Party, which gets
support from both religious communities, told The Associated Press
he participated in the talks.
   The BBC said that in addition to Mawhinney and Robinson, the
other two politicians who worked out the agreement in West Germany
were Jack Allen, chairman of the Official Unionists, the largest
Protestant party; and Austin Currie of the moderate Social
Democratic and Labor Party, the largest Catholic political group.
   Mawhinny said the talks were arranged by a German Lutheran church
official for a different purpose, which he did not specify, but the
four politicians involved departed from the agenda ``somewhat by
accident'' and discussed their differences.
   ``There was a regular line of communication opened between the
Northern Ireland political parties and ... great willingness to look
at the problems of the other community,'' he said.
   The BBC said there never has been a Northern Ireland initiative
to solve the province's political problem and the fact that both
sides had continued the secret talks at home for four months showed
willingness to agree.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey of Ireland said Wednesday night
behind-the-scenes contacts had been going on. ``This is a delicate
and sensitive area,'' he said. ``There is a fair amount of contact
taking place.'' Britain's Northern Ireland Office, the Cabinet
department in charge of the province, did not confirm knowledge of
the talks, but said: ``If the reports of contact and talks between
the Northern Ireland parties are correct then the government would
welcome them.''
   From its establishment 1921 until 1972, Northern Ireland had its
own parliament and government, including control of security forces.
Britain handled only finance, defense and foreign affairs.
   With terrorist activity increasing, Prime Minister Edward Heath
decided in 1972 to end self-government and impose direct rule. That
was followed by an agreement in 1974 to establish a Northern Ireland
assembly of all parties.
   That plan collapsed on the issue of power sharing and Protestants
opposed to joint rule with Catholics conducted several crippling
strikes. Several unsuccessful attempts to revive the dialogue were
made in the past decade.
   In its report Thursday, the BBC said the so-called Duisburg
Agreement provides for a provincial government with power shared by
all parties at all levels and control of the police.
   Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army, was not included in the talks. The IRA is fighting
to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite it with the Irish
Republic, which is overwhelmingly Catholic.
   More than 2,700 people have been killed in sectarian violence in
Northern Ireland since 1969.

   The State Department, responding to a news
report linking Palestinian radicals to the bombing of a Pan Am jumbo
jet, said Thursday the attack has not been solved yet.
   ``We are confident we will eventually find out who is
responsible, but we should not expect a quick solution,'' spokesman
Charles E. Redman said.
   Asked about a CBS News report implicating Syria and Libya, Redman
said ``the investigators have not yet reached any conclusion about
who is responsible.''
   A total of 270 people perished in the Dec. 21 crash, including
259 persons on the 747 jet and 11 persons in the Scottish village of
Lockerbie, where the plane hit. The flight originated in Frankfurt,
West Germany, and then went to London before taking off for New York.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Wednesday night he
could not confirm the CBS report. ``I don't know that any
responsibility has been determined,'' Baker said at a White House
reception.
   According to CBS, the attack on Flight 103 was in retaliation for
the U.S. bombing of Libya in 1986 and was also spurred by the U.S.
decision in December to talk with the Palestine Liberation
Organization. The network quoted sources ``deep within the terrorist
movement.''
   The principal architect of the bombing was Ahmed Jibril, head of
the extreme Palestinian group, the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine-General Command, CBS said.
   Jibril, based in Syria, was working for Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi, although he was also required to clear the operation with
Syrian intelligence officials, the network reported.
   Gadhafi sent a distant cousin, Sayed Gaddafidam, to Jibril, who
is known to hate the United States, CBS said. Three years ago,
Jibril told a news conference in Libya: ``There will be no safety
for any traveler on an Israeli or U.S. airliner.''
   Jibril, a former officer in Syrian military intelligence, cleared
the operation for an American target with Syrian intelligence and,
with full backing of the Libyan secret service, moved to Frankfurt,
West Germany, and made the Pan Am plane his target, CBS said.
   The network quoted Omar Shehabi, a Jabril spokesman, as saying
through an interpreter, ``I tell you that we didn't do it and we are
not involved. We don't practice terrorism and we condemn such
actions.''
   Investigators ``are close'' to accepting that chain of events as
the official version, CBS said.
   Investigators believe that the bomb that destroyed Flight 103 was
put aboard in Frankfurt.
   In Edinburgh, Scotland, Radio Forth reported the bomb was planted
by Palestinian terrorists in the luggage of a CIA agent.
   The radio report, citing information from unidentified Scottish
police sources, said the CIA officer was returning from Beirut with
five colleagues after a mission to negotiate release of the nine
American hostages in Lebanon.
   Scottish investigators refused comment on the Radio Forth report.
   In December, U.S. officials in Washington, speaking on condition
of anonymity, told The Associated Press the CIA's chief in Beirut
was among the jet's passengers. They did not give the agent's name.
   Radio Forth did not name the agent it said was on the jet. It
said investigators believe a three-pound charge of Semtex explosive
and a timing device were slipped into the agent's luggage by
Palestinian terrorists who infiltrated the secret Beirut mission.
   The radio report said the baggage was shipped from Beirut via
Helsinki to Frankfurt, where the agents caught the flight for New
York. The timer was believed to have been activated during the stop
in Helsinki, the report said.

   Record high temperatures of nearly 80 degrees warmed parts of
North Carolina and Virginia Thursday, while lows found new depths in
Wyoming, Montana and the Dakotas. In between, a band of freezing
rain caused icy roads from northern Texas to upstate New York.
   At McAllen, in southern Texas, it hit 88 degrees in the afternoon.
   The temperature at Billings, Mont., at 5 p.m. was 24 degrees
below zero, well below the record low for the date of 13 below zero.
The temperature at Casper, Wyo., tied the all-time low for the month
of February when it dropped to 27 below.
   Wind chills were in the 60 to 80 below range from portions of the
Dakotas across northeast Wyoming to much of Montana.
   Light snow continued across the upper Mississippi Valley, the
northern and central Great Plains, the northern and central Rockies
and the Pacific Northwest.
   An inch of snow fell on the northern California coast at Crescent
City.
   Warm moist air covered the south Atlantic and Gulf Coast states.
The moisture from the Gulf of Mexico produced a band of rain from
the southern Plains to the Ohio Valley.
   North of the band was an area of sleet and freezing rain, which
produced icy roads that caused numerous auto accidents Thursday
morning from portions of the southern Plains across the middle
Mississippi Valley and the southern Great Lakes to New York state.
   Strong winds continued over parts of Nevada and California with
wind gusts to 80 mph reported near Reno.
   Low temperature records included 28 degrees below zero in
Billings, 34 below in Great Falls, Mont., and 28 below in Sheridan,
Wyo.
   Highs temperature records were broken in North Carolina at
Asheville, where it was 76, Cape Hatteras at 74, Charlotte at 79 and
Wilmington at 80. A 77-degree reading broke a record in Richmond, Va.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 28
degrees below zero at Cut Bank, Mont., to 88 degrees at McAllen,
Texas. The low Thursday morning in the lower 48 states was 34 below
zero in Montana at Cut Bank, Great Falls and Lewistown.
   The forecast for Friday called for light snow to continue from
the Pacific Northwest across the intermountain West, the northern
and central portions of the Rockies and Plains and the upper half of
the Mississippi Valley to Michigan. A mixture of sleet, freezing
rain and snow is expected to reach from northwest Pennsylvania
across much of New York to New England. Rain was predicted from
southeast Texas across the lower Mississippi and Tennessee valleys
and the upper Ohio Valley to the mid Atlantic Coast states.
   High temperatures were expected to be below zero from eastern
Washington state across the northern half of the Rockies and the
northern and central Plains to Minnesota. Highs in the 20 to 30
below zero range were forecast for most of Montana. Highs above zero
but below freezing were expected from northern New England across
the Great Lakes region, the middle Mississippi Valley to portions of
the southern Plains, and from most of the Plateau region to the
Pacific Northwest. Temperatures were expected in the 60s and 70s
from the Carolinas across the central Gulf Coast, with 80s from
southern South Carolina to much of Florida.

   Hundreds of marchers hurled firebombs and
clashed with club-swinging police on Thursday during a rally to
protest the social event of the year at Vienna's famed opera house.
   The crowd smashed windows, destroyed cars and hurled firecrackers
and Molotov cocktails as they marched to protest the lavishness of
the Opera Ball, an opulent party held annually at the opera house,
police and witnesses said.
   Police in riot gear used rubber truncheons and water cannons to
disperse the crowd as they moved toward the landmark building,
witnesses said.
   Eight policemen were hurt, Vienna Police Chief Gunther Boegl said
on Austrian television. Witnesses also said demonstrators also were
injured but police said they had no figures. Two Austrian television
cameramen also were reported hurt.
   Five protesters were arrested at the site of the demonstration,
police said. Two others, including a West German citizen, were
arrested on the outskirts of town after firebombs were found in
their car.
   Demonstrators, many with their faces covered by scarves or masks,
shouted ``fascists'' as they clashed with police.
   Police estimated the crowd at 800 to 900 people, and witness
accounts said as many as 2,000 people took part.
   Several groups organized the demonstration, which was banned by
authorities. The rally's motto was ``Eat the Rich.''
   Opera Ball guests had trouble getting to the opera house because
all streets around the building were blocked off and entrances to
subway stations closed, leading to a slight delay in the official
opening of the ball.
   Inside the opera house, men in tails and women in elaborate ball
gowns whirled to Strauss waltzes, and opera stars Jose Carreras and
Placido Domingo performed a song together.

   Hundreds of political supporters clashed
Thursday with backers of a rival party in a poor Jamaican
neighborhood. Two people were shot to death and a 12-year-old boy
was wounded, police said.
   ``All hell broke loose. There were gunshots from all angles,'' a
policeman said on condition of anonymity.
   It was the third day of political violence as Jamaica prepares
for general elections to be held Feb. 9.
   On Wednesday, police used tear gas to break up a confrontation
between rival parties in Spanish Town, outside the capital of
Kingston. Two women were shot to death Tuesday.
   The deaths Thursday raised to eight the number of people reported
killed since Prime Minister Edward Seaga launched the campaign on
Jan. 15 by announcing the election date.
   Police said Thursday's violence began when Clinton Davey, a
candidate for Parliament for the leftist People's National Party,
was campaigning with 1,000 supporters in Fletcher's Land, a poor
Kingston neighborhood.
   Police said the crowd plowed through a roadblock set up by
political opponents at a street called Mark Lane.
   Police said they did not know the victims' identities. They said
the 12-year-old boy was shot in the left foot.
   It is the first contested election in Jamaica since 1980, when
Seaga, a conservative, and his socialist rival Michael Manley last
faced off. In a nine-month campaign that year, 700 people were
killed in political violence.

   President Hosni Mubarak voiced some of his
harshest criticism of Israel on Thursday, accusing it of
jeopardizing relations with its stand on a disputed beach resort.
   He said Israel has been guilty of ``repulsive'' equivocation over
withdrawing from Taba, a Sinai border enclave Israel seized in the
1967 Middle East war.
   Mubarak said the Israeli position is threatening normalization of
relations under the two countries' 1979 peace treaty.
   The tone of his remarks to reporters reflected exasperation and,
at times, anger.
   He made the comments even though the Israeli Cabinet on Wednesday
said it was committed to withdrawal. It also agreed to follow
recommendations of a U.S. mediator to get talks back under way, said
a government official on condition of anonymity. But no timetable
for withdrawal was announced.
   In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said he was
``disappointed'' by the criticism.
   ``I think we are very close to reaching an agreement,'' he said.
``I think a little more goodwill on both sides will bring us to
agreement.
   ``There is no stalling. We are doing all we can to finish these
discussions as soon as possible.''
   In Thursday's remarks, Mubarak charged that Israel is dragging
its feet on withdrawing the the Aqaba Gulf resort at the southern
end of the common border. On Sept. 29, an arbitration panel drew a
border to within a few hundred yards of the resort.
   The ruling seemed to put the enclave in Egyptian territory.
However, if the line were extended at a sharp angle, the resort
could still fall in Israeli territory.
   The Egyptian leader said Israel first sought to delay putting the
ruling into effect because of its parliamentary elections last fall
and formation of a new Cabinet.
   ``Now they want another delay,'' he said. ``We want to build
confidence, but this method of equivocation and dilly-dallying does
not inspire confidence .... This method is repulsive, and we refuse
pressure.''
   Mubarak again rejected Israel's attempts to link withdrawal from
the 250-acre area with compensation for an Israeli-owned hotel and
other resort facilities and access for Israeli tourists. He said
withdrawal must come first.
   Two rounds of U.S.-mediated talks on Taba last month ended in
deadlock, mainly over the linkage issue.
   Mubarak took office in 1981, and the Taba dispute began the next
year when Israel withdrew from the rest of the Sinai under terms of
the 1979 peace treaty.
   Abraham Sofaer, the U.S. State Department legal adviser who has
been mediating the talks, went from Israel to Egypt on Thursday to
meet with Egyptian officials.
   An Egyptian Foreign Ministry source speaking on condition of
anonymity said Sofaer had offered new proposals to both sides and
that he was leaving for Washington on Friday. The source gave no
details of the proposals.

   President Fidel Castro of Cuba said
Thursday the Bush administration is less ideological than its
predecessor and more likely to help achieve peace in Central America.
   Also Thursday, President Jose Azcona Hoyos said the leftist
government in Nicaragua would offer to hold free elections and would
moderate its communist revolution.
   Castro, who is among the world leaders in Caracas this week for
the inauguration of President Carlos Andres Perez, said in a
televised interview that his talks with Central American leaders
indicate ``everyone is working in the direction of peace.''
   He said the Bush administration is ``more pragmatic and less
ideological'' than the Reagan administration and ``can reach a
political solution'' to the conflicts in Central America.
   But Castro called Latin America a ``barrel of gunpowder'' because
its combined debt has risen while the value of its exports has
dropped.
   The five Central American nations will hold a summit on Feb.
13-14 in El Salvador to discuss Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's
latest plan for peace with U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels.
   Ortega presented the proposals on Wednesday to Azcona, whose
country is used as a base for the rebels known as Contras.
   The proposals included developing an amnesty program for the
rebels, reviewing the cases of political prisoners, increasing
private sector participation in the economy, and holding free
elections next year, Azcona said.
   Azcona, after meeting with Ortega, said the Sandinista government
in Nicaragua planned to tone down its ``radical'' communist
revolution to deal with its economic and political problems.
   Azcona said that ``the series of problems (Nicaragua) has in all
areas made them realize that a revolution cannot be pushed in such a
radical way and that what is best for all of us, including them, is
a political solution.''
   Of Ortega's latest peace proposal, Azcona said ``If these things
are carried through they will contribute to tranquillity in that
country and then in our country.''
   Azcona is to meet with Vice President Dan Quayle, who also is
here for Perez' inauguration.
   Ortega is expected to meet Castro before his departure for
Havana. Cuba backs Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
   But Ortega said this week that ``the conditions are not yet
ripe'' for direct talks between Nicaragua and the United States.
Quayle said Thursday that the Bush administration ``does not work''
with the Sandinistas.

   The Bush administration has opened arms-sale
talks with Congress that potentially include shipping 315 Abrams
tanks, considered the world's best, to Saudi Arabia and 40
sophisticated FA-18 jet fighters to the United Arab Emirates,
congressional and other sources said Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Other Arab states would be in line for U.S. armaments under the
proposal, made in the next to the last day of the Reagan
administration and now the focus of discussions between the Bush
White House and Congress.
   Also proposed: 200 Abrams tanks, seven multiple-launched
battlefield rocket systems and 1,500 Tow anti-tank missiles for
Kuwait; 40 Maverick air-to-ground missiles with an infra-red
guidance system and electronic warfare gear for Bahrain; 24 F-16 jet
fighters, 100 Mavericks and 100 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles for
Morocco, and seven of the battlefield rocket systems for Saudi
Arabia.
   Greece would get 60 M48 tanks and 100 Harpoon anti-ship missiles
for Greece.
   If Bush follows through, the proposed Arab sales would seem sure
to touch off a battle with congressional supporters of Israel, which
is concerned that sophisticated weapons in Arab hands could be
turned against Israel in a Mideast conflict.
   The list is classified; a copy was obtained by The Associated
Press.
   Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, declined to
identify the weapons under consideration for sale. He stressed that
the document did not amount to a ``sale plan,'' but rather to the
administration's ``best estimate'' of other countries' weapons needs.
   ``Each item has to be reviewed by this administration,'' Redman
said.
   Congress has the power to block a purchase, but only if a
majority of both the Senate and the House reject a formal White
House notification of intended sale.
   The informal list was sent to Congress on Jan. 19 by the outgoing
Reagan administration. The Bush administration opened talks with
Congress last Friday, said a U.S. official who declined to be
identified.
   Currently, the United States only shares the Abrams tank, also
known as the M1A1, only with Egypt. The two nations have a
co-production agreement, but the proposed sale would mean the tanks
would be sold to nations other than Egypt.
   Under the plan now under discussion, Egypt would be sold 150 Hawk
missiles, 24 helicopters, artillery radar and tank equipment. Israel
would be sold 200 shoulder-fired Stinger missiles, 24 helicopters
and new equipment for its F-15 jet fighters.
   Jordan again would receive no American weapons. Since 1985,
Congress has prohibited militry aid to the Arab kingdon until it
agrees to peace terms with Israel.
   Meanwhile, the sources said that the White House, in a cover
letter, told Congress that the Saudis are now deciding whether to
request U.S. or European fighters to replace over the coming decade
their aging fleet of U.S.-made F-5s.
   The letter said the Saudis were considering jets to be jointly
produced by Britain and West Germany along with the French Mirage
4000 and U.S.-built F-16s and FA-18s.

<TEXT>
   The Senate on Thursday night voted to reject a
proposed 51 percent congressional pay raise, but Speaker Jim Wright
said the House would let it take effect next week and then vote to
reduce it to ``a decent raise'' of 30 percent.
   The Senate voted 95-5 to reject the raise for Congress and other
top federal officials, and to change the law to eliminate current
procedures which allow a pay increase to take effect without a vote.
   Then, the Senate gave voice vote approval to legislation to ban
members from pocketing speaking fees or other honoraria, should the
pay raise take effect.
   Five senators voted against the package to eliminate the
currently-proposed pay increase, to roll back the pay raise if the
deadline is missed by the House, and to require votes on all future
pay raises. They were Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.; Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass.; Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii; Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska; and
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
   The final joint resolution was approved by a voice vote.
   The vote against the pay increase was lopsided but largely
symbolic, since both chambers must vote to block it. House
procedures make it easier to protect a pay raise in that chamber,
and Wright, D-Texas, continued as the main target of opponents as he
maneuvered to protect most of the raise.
   House members' public positions, like those of the Senate, have
been overwhelmingly against the 51 percent pay increase, which must
be disapproved by both chambers before Feb. 8 or it will
automatically take effect.
   But Wright said Thursday a ``clear majority'' of members, now
paid $89,500, privately supported his plan for dodging a
pre-deadline vote and then voting a partial rollback of the raise
along with a ban on honoraria.
   However, the restrictive parliamentary procedure planned by the
speaker requires a tough two-thirds vote before the bill could be
sent to the Senate. The 51 percent raise above the current $89,500
salary would remain in effect unless both chambers agreed to cut it
back, and House opponents vowed to roll it back to zero whether
Wright wins or loses.
   ``It would be very difficult for the speaker to find two-thirds
for this resolution,'' said Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, even though
Wright's tactic would force pay raise opponents to appear to be
voting to protect the full pay increase.
   Wright released partial results of a personal questionnaire,
showing 57 percent of House members opposing a pay raise vote before
the deadline and 54 percent favoring instead a vote to reduce the
raise to 30 percent.
   The $26,850 pay raise he was proposing was ``a decent raise but
not an exorbitant raise,'' Wright said, compared with the $45,500
increase proposed by former President Reagan and endorsed by
President Bush.
   The 30 percent figure was equal to the amount of income House
members could lose in a ban on honoraria. The Senate figure is
$35,800, as they are currently allowed to retain honoraria equal to
40 percent of their salaries.
   House members would still make the same amount of money they make
now, he said. ``The difference is we will be serving one master, not
two, that is, the American people,'' he said.
   Actually, most House members would find their incomes
substantially increased, since fewer than half reach the current
honoraria limit of 30 percent of income, according to their
financial disclosures.
   Wright said it was his intention that all top federal officials,
including federal judges, would receive the same increase. Under his
strategy, federal judges might still win the full 51 percent pay
increase, since under the Constitution those new salaries cannot be
reduced once enacted.
   Wright has met with House Republican leader Bob Michel of
Illinois to solicit his endorsement of the plan. Wright was joined
at his news conference only by four leading Democratic members, and
the second-ranked Republican in the House supported the concept of a
dollar-for-dollar trade-off of salary for honoraria.
   ``If we do an effective job of prohibiting outside earned income,
then an adjustment of that size would be appropriate,'' he said.
``Whether we do it before or after the eighth (of February) is less
important than what's in the package,'' he said.
   As the Senate opened its debate, Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, said also supported the concept behind the speaker's 30
percent proposal, and said it was unfair to Wright to take the brunt
of criticism. But he acknowledged the Senate would follow public
opinion and kill the entire raise.
   ``If contemporary public opinion were the sole determinant, the
pay... would be the same as it was in 1789,'' he said.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole said, ``I do think there should
be a pay raise'' but he said ``there's no way you can explain'' 51
percent.
   Although a Senate vote to kill the pay raise was long expected,
the House leadership's original plan was to weather the storm of
public protest and let the pay raise take effect. Then, to lessen
the political damage, they planned action on a bipartisan package of
reforms including an honoraria ban.
   Wright this week changed the course when he promised to hold a
vote to kill the raise before the deadline if a majority of House
members wanted it.
   A subsequent Associated Press survey on Wednesday showed 88
percent of those responding favored such a vote, but Wright said 57
percent of those responding to his private tally wanted the deadline
to pass.
   Wright's survey ``exposes members to a charge of lying,'' said
Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, citing the Associated Press and
surveys by his own organization.
   Numerous public surveys showed members of both chambers would
vote overwhelmingly against accepting the pay increase.
   Wright said the House would vote on rolling back the increase on
Feb. 9 as part of an ethics package which would include:
   _ An immediate ban on members accepting fees for speaking,
writing, consulting, or legal or professional services.
   _ Restrictions on travel expenses.
   _ A repeal, effective in 1991, of the law allowing senior
lawmakers to pocket excess campaign funds.
   Wright's proposal came on the eve of the annual House Democratic
retreat at the posh Greenbrier resort in West Virginia, which is
subsidized by corporate and union donations.

   Two explosions caused by runaway railroad
cars rocked Montana's capital city Thursday, cutting off electricity
and forcing the evacuation of thousands as wind chills dipped to 70
degrees below zero.
   The runaway cars derailed and hit a propane tank near the
railroad tracks, setting off an explosion. Minutes later, the fire
from the blast caused one of the derailed cars containing a highly
flammable chemical to blow up, authorities said. A second car
containing plastic also burned, producing a cloud of black smoke
that prompted the evacuations.
   The force of the 4:48 a.m. blasts overturned automobiles,
shattered windows up to two miles away, damaged a nearby college and
homes, and hurled pieces of railroad cars through buildings a
quarter-mile away. But only two minor injuries were reported.
   ``It's a miracle no one was killed or injured,'' said Ed Schild,
Lewis and Clark County undersheriff.
   Mayor Russell Ritter estimated the damage at $3 million.
   The accident happened as a severe cold snap paralyzed the state.
Gov. Stan Stephens shut down state government throughout Montana,
citing the bitter-cold temperatures, power outages and fumes emitted
by the fire.
   Authorities originally believed that a railroad car containing
polyvinyl chloride was on fire. PVC produces dangerous hydrogen
chloride gas when ignited, and the belief prompted the evacuations
and orders to stay indoors.
   But authorities later discovered that the hopper car, though it
carried a sign indicating PVC was aboard, actually contained
granular polyethylene, and that the smoke billowing over the valley
was carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.
   ``It dissipates in the atmosphere and is not serious,'' said Paul
Spengler, the county disaster coordinator.
   But the fire proved stubborn, and the blaze was still smoldering
Thursday night despite firefighting efforts.
   Fire officials feared the blaze could ignite a nearby tank car
that contained hydrogen peroxide, the chemical that exploded, but
they believed that a layer of ice that encased the car would lessen
the threat, Spengler said.
   The explosions occurred in an open area on the city's west side
and severed one of three major power lines, authorities said.
Although power initially was knocked out for 37,000 people in and
around Helena, electricity was restored to most areas by 11 a.m.
   Authorities evacuated about 2,000 people from an area one square
mile around the burning railroad car, said City Manager Bill
Verwolf. Residents were allowed to return starting late afternoon,
when the fire was under control, he said.
   In Washington, the Federal Railroad Administration said the chain
of events began when a cab heater malfunctioned in a Montana Rail
Link locomotive hauling 48 freight cars over the Continental Divide
west of Helena.
   ``The crew stopped the freight to exchange the lead locomotive
for another lead locomotive with a better heater ...,'' the FRA said
in a statement. ``This manuever required them to disconnect the
locomotives from the 48 freight cars being hauled.
   ``When the exchange of locomotives was complete, the crew
returned to pick up the freight cars only to find they were gone,''
it said, adding that the cars had rolled 12 miles east to Helena.
   The FRA said the runaway cars hit another locomotive and 21 of
the cars derailed. One of those cars hit a propane tank alongside
the track, the agency said, touching off an explosion.
   ``The ensuing fire triggered a second explosion in one of the
hazardous material cars,'' the FRA said
   ``I jumped out of the way from being squashed,'' said Mike
McNellis, who was aboard the locomotive that was struck as it was
switching to another track.
   One paramedic was taken to a hospital after inhaling fumes.
Firefighters wore respirators as they poured water on the flames.
   Evacuees fled to churches, the Helena Civic Center, the National
Guard armory and schools, which were already closed by the severe
cold. Temperatures hovered near 30 degrees below zero, which
combined with winds to produce wind chills of 70 degrees below zero,
the National Weather Service said. Snow fell intermittently.
   ``The weather couldn't be worse,'' said Ritter. ``Displacing
people in these circumstances is tragic, but Helenans are tough
people. We'll adjust.''
   The collision occurred in an open area between the city dump and
golf course, about a quarter-mile north of Carroll College.
   ``If it wasn't for that golf course and the (adjacent) baseball
diamonds, we'd have a lot of tragedies,'' said Lewis and Clark
County Sheriff Chuck O'Reilly.
   Nearly all windows were shattered at Carroll College buildings,
the school's physical education center had portions of its roof
blown out, and pieces of railroad car dotted a snow-covered field
near a dormitory a quarter-mile away. A 1,500-pound railroad coupler
fell through the roof of a dormitory, but no one was injured,
authorities said.
   ``Our campus has suffered extensive damage,'' said Ritter, who is
also head of development for Carroll.
   Bruce Stewart, a Helena airport policeman helping with security
at the blast site, said a set of railroad car axles and wheels went
through the roof of a home near the college, but no one was injured.
   Jeff Meyer said two windows were blown out of his house, about a
third of a mile from the blast.
   ``The explosion shook the whole house,'' he said. ``I saw the
flash of light between our venetian blinds. I was thinking, `World
War III or something.'''

   President P.W. Botha resigned
Thursday as leader of the governing National Party but said he will
carry on as the country's leader after he recuperates from a stroke.
   Education Minister F.W. de Klerk was narrowly elected as the new
leader of the party _ which has held power for 40 years _ and
consolidated his status as the favorite to become the next president.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a leading anti-apartheid
activist, said that repression of blacks under de Klerk likely would
intensify.
   Botha, 73, told party officials in a letter that he was resigning
the party post, which he assumed in 1978, to concentrate on
presidential duties and distance the presidency from partisan
politics. He did not elaborate.
   He is recuperating at his home in Cape Town from the Jan. 18
stroke that weakened his left arm and left leg. Doctors said
Thursday Botha was recovering rapidly, but will need at least one
more month of rest before he can return to work.
   Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis was appointed
acting president during Botha's recovery, but he placed third in
Thursday's vote for a new party leader behind de Klerk and Finance
Minister Barend du Plessis.
   As education minister, de Klerk, 52, has tried to avoid
ideological labels and has not been associated with major
innovations. Last year, he proposed controversial steps to reduce
financial aid to universities that allowed demonstrations protesting
South Africa's apartheid system of racial separation.
   As leader of the National Party in Transvaal Province, de Klerk
has tried to halt defections to the extreme-right Conservative
Party. He supports Botha's policies of slow-paced reform that would
lead to limited power-sharing with blacks, who are in the majority
but have no vote in national affairs.
   At a news conference in Cape Town, de Klerk declined to discuss
his political agenda but said the party would ``change in step with
the times.''
   He said he would consult with Botha before proposing any policy
changes.
   ``A very special relationship will now have to develop between
myself as leader-in-chief of the National Party on the one hand and
the state president as chief executive on the other hand,'' he said.
   The National Party's parliamentary caucus chose de Klerk over du
Plessis by a vote of 69-61.
   The other contenders _ Heunis and Foreign Minister Pik Botha _
were eliminated in early rounds of balloting.
   Wynand Malan, a liberal opposition member of Parliament, said the
balloting indicated dissatisfaction with ``the old-style National
Party.''
   ``Almost half the caucus opted for a more dynamic and more modern
leadership,'' Malan said.
   Alan Hendrickse, leader of the mixed-race chamber of Parliament,
said it did not matter who led the National Party.
   ``As long as the policies of the National Party are executed,
there is no hope for South Africa,'' said Hendrickse, who was fired
from Botha's Cabinet in 1987 after urging the abolition of
residential segregation.
   Tutu said he believed party politics would prompt de Klerk to
take a tougher stand on apartheid.
   ``I don't believe there will be any significant changes because
they both come out of the same stable,'' the Nobel Prize-winning
activist, who is on a three-day trip to Britain, told reporters in
Merthyr Tydfil, Wales.
   ``But there appears to be a split in the party and the new leader
has to establish himself.
   ``In South Africa, that means being a toughie _ and they cannot
be trifled with,'' he said. ``I will be very surprised if we don't
see an intensification of the repression.''
   South Africa's president is chosen by an electoral college
dominated by the party that controls Parliament. The National Party
holds 133 of 178 seats in Parliament's white chamber, and it can
carry out its wishes over combined opposition from the smaller Asian
and mixed-race chambers.
   Botha became party leader in 1978, when he was elected prime
minister. He became president in 1984 under a new constitution that
abolished the prime minister post.
   Botha has refused to discuss his possible retirement, but has
said he wants to reduce his work load. Legislation is pending that
would revive the post of prime minister to share leadership duties
with the president.
   Heunis, as acting president, will open this year's session of
Parliament in Cape Town on Friday.
   There was widespread speculation Botha would use the occasion to
call for a national election in April, but political analysts say
his stroke means an election is unlikely until later in the year.
   The National Party, which enacted the country's apartheid laws
after taking power in 1948, is expected to maintain power in the
next election.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House of Commons on Thursday voted down a
measure that would have allowed civil servants to leak state secrets
to the news media in the public interest.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government
defeated the Labor proposal 267-179 despite the defection of 18
Conservative legislators, including former Prime Minister Edward
Heath, who voted in favor of the measure.
   The measure was a proposed amendment to the Official Secrets
Bill, which is being proposed as a replacement for the government's
78-year-old Official Secrets Act.
   The full bill is designed to reduce some of the government's
sweeping powers to declare virtually anything a state secret. The
bill proposes to decriminalize some trivial leaks and make
prosecutions in some cases more difficult.
   The full bill was approved in principle by Commons last year. It
is now going through a stage where parties are adding various
amendments, which are voted upon individually by the Commons.
   Heath said civil servants prosecuted for leaking official secrets
should be able to claim they acted in the public interest, if indeed
that was the case. He said a ``public interest'' clause was needed
because the public had a right to know instances of wrongdoing.
   Labor's deputy leader, Roy Hattersley, said the Thatcher
government's ``obsession with secrecy is not so much about
protecting information necessary to our security but suppressing
information that is embarrassing to the government.''
   But Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, the Cabinet member responsible
for law and order, said, ``We have to take into account public
servants who might have less good motives.''
   The bill now before Commons proposes to confine secrecy mainly to
defense, security and foreign affairs.
   But civil libertarians, newspapers editors and opposition parties
say the bill does not go far enough to protect individual freedoms
of speech or measures guaranteeing news media freedom.
   Britain has no equivalent of First Amendment or of the Freedom of
Information Act.

   Gunmen opened fire on a convoy of
about 30 U.S. soldiers taking part in military maneuvers on Thursday
and struck one of the vehicles, officials said.
   The identity of the gunmen was not known, said Charles Barclay, a
spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa.
   ``An undetermined number of men fired at the convoy from a
hilltop near the highway but there were no injuries,'' he said.
``Two shots hit the last vehicle in the convoy.''
   Barclay said officials believe four or five shots were fired at
the seven-vehicle convoy.
   ``We don't know if it was an attempted attack or a mistake, but
it is being investigated,'' he said.
   He said the incident took place at about 1 p.m. in Yoro province,
about 125 miles north of Tegucigalpa. The convoy immediately
returned to Palmerola Air Base, about 100 miles away, he said.
   Between 400 and 500 U.S. troops have been rotating into Honduras
through the air base every two weeks for joint maneuvers with the
Honduran armed forces since the beginning of the year. The base is
about 50 miles from the capital.
   Troops from the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, N.C., are
in Honduras for the training exercises.

<DATELINE>FORT ORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pilots of two Army helicopters that
crashed at Fort Ord were on a training mission with night-vision
goggles linked to numerous accidents, an official said Thursday.
   Capt. Michael D. Scotton, 28, of Laytonsville, Md., son of Peace
Corps chief of staff David R. Scotton, was killed in the crash
Wednesday night, the Army said. Another soldier suffered multiple
fractures and two others were released after treatment of minor
injuries.
   Investigators from the Army Safety Center in Fort Rucker, Ala.,
were trying to determine whether the choppers, working together with
two soldiers aboard each, collided before they went down 150 yards
apart, said Army spokesman Jim Davis.
   ``They were on a night goggle training mission,'' said Davis.
``They signed out for the goggles but we don't know if they were
wearing them at the time of the accident.''
   The crashes occurred just hours after Rep. Frank McCloskey,
D-Ind., said a House subcommittee will investigate accidents
involving the military's use of night-vision goggles.
   The soldiers signed out with the newer ANAVS-6 goggles, which
have been in use since March 1987. An older model, ANPVS-5, has been
used since the early 1970s.
   Of 23 Army helicopter accidents since Oct. 1985, 11 have involved
pilots wearing the newer ANAVS-6 goggles, said Lt. Col. John Chapla
at the Pentagon.
   He said, however, ``we haven't been able to determine that any
goggles have been a direct cause in any of the crashes.''
   Fort Ord spokesman Guy Shields said the newer goggles were
specifically designed for night flying and corrected the problems of
the older models, which were intended for ground use. But McCloskey
said, ``The overall situation has not greatly improved.''
   At least 62 helicopters have gone down and 134 servicemen have
died in the past decade in crashes in which the pilots were looking
through night-vision goggles the Pentagon allegedly knew were
unsafe, the Orange County Register reported in December.
   The military blamed almost all of the crashes on pilot error.
   McCloskey's request for the investigation, to take place later
this month, was approved Wednesday by the newly appointed chairman
of the subcommittee, Rep. Nick Mavroules, D-Mass.
   The older goggles, used primarily by the Marine Corps and the
Army, electronically amplify moonlight and starlight, partly
improving night vision but also sacrificing peripheral sight and
reducing normal 20-20 vision to 20-50 or worse.
   Those goggles can lead to eye fatigue and illusions, the Register
said, and tend to shut down in clouds and prevent pilots from seeing
and avoiding clouds.
   It had been cloudy and raining off and on Wednesday.
   In December, McCloskey asked the Army to prohibit the use of the
obsolete goggles and accelerate purchase of the new goggles. But in
a letter delivered Tuesday, the Army refused.
   ``This decision is based on our safety record, intense training
programs, and the acute level of safety awareness throughout the
chain of command,'' wrote J.R. Sculley, assistant secretary of the
Army for research, development and acquisition.
   In the crashes at Fort Ord, Chief Warrant Officer 2nd Class Tracy
J. Gray, 27, suffered multiple fractures and was in stable condition
Thursday at Letterman Army Medical Center in San Francisco.
   Chief Warrant Officer 2nd Class Benjamin C. Graves, 28, and
Warrant Officer 1st Class Cliff L. Walters, 24, were treated for
minor bumps and cuts at Fort Ord and released.
   The two downed aircraft were an AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter and
an OH-58 Kiowa observation helicopter. Both were unarmed and
assigned to Fort Ord's 123rd Combat Aviation Brigade, said Shields.

   Princess Diana's wide-ranging royal rounds
Thursday took her from a family living in a homeless shelter to FAO
Schwarz's treasure trove of toys, topped by a night at the opera and
the visit's first protesters.
   Cheering crowds turned out at each stop to glimpse the princess,
who thrilled some Lower East Siders by shaking some hands and
accepting flowers.
   The exception was a crowd of more than 400 Irish-American
protesters across from the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where the
princess attended the American debut of the Welsh National Opera.
   A dinner at the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center was
planned after the opera performance of ``Falstaff.''
   Charles J. Hynes, a potential mayoral candidate, said, ``The
protest is not directed against Princess Diana, it's directed
against her as a symbol of British government, which for much too
long has inhabited Northern Ireland and depressed Irish Catholics.''
   Both Mayor Edward I. Koch and developer Donald Trump were heckled
as they arrived at the academy, in a neighborhood where scattered
renovations and new businesses contrast with dilapidated low-income
housing.
   When Diana, wearing a white evening gown, arrived by limousine
with a police escort, she was cheered by a smattering of local
residents while the protesters loudly chanted ``IRA, IRA.''
   Koch spoke with her in a receiving line, telling reporters Diana
told him she hoped her motorcade wasn't tying up traffic.
   As for the protesters invoking the name of the British-outlawed
Irish Republican Army, Koch said: ``She didn't mention it. I didn't
mention it. It's part of the New York City landscape.''
   Inside, as she entered a balcony box, the orchestra sounded a
drum roll and a hush fell over the audience. The orchestra played
``God Save the Queen,'' the ``Star Spangled Banner'' and the ``Welsh
National Anthem.''
   From the stage, Koch told her: ``I want to bid you welcome. The
city is graced by your presence. We want to be sure your visit goes
just the way you want it to be so when you go home you can say you
had a royal time in New York.''
   Also at the performance was Bianca Jagger, who described Diana as
``marvelous, attractive, beautiful and seems to be doing a great job
as future queen of England.''
   At the upscale Fifth Avenue toy store FAO Schwarz, Diana attended
a luncheon to promote British-made toys and toured its floors with
store president Peter Harris.
   ``It must be fun to be in a place like this every day,'' store
spokeswoman Brooke Adkins quoted the princess as saying.
   Harris said Diana stopped frequently to admire items, saying,
``Oh, this is cute,'' and commenting that her children, Princes
Harry and William, would enjoy them. Her favorite appeared to be a
large white teddy bear.
   She shook hands with several onlookers outside the store before
leaving.
   Earlier Thursday Diana visited the Henry Street Settlement, a
community center on Manhattan's Lower East Side that has helped the
disadvantaged for nearly a century.
   There she met Linda Correa, a homeless woman who temporarily
lives in an apartment supplied by the shelter, and other women who
were once homeless.
   ``These are really terrific women,'' the princess said, according
to the settlement's director, Verona Jeter, who accompanied Diana on
her tour.
   ``She was really impressed with them,'' Ms. Jeter said.
   And 7-year-old Raamel Correa was impressed with her. ``She's
nice. Like a friend of mine,'' he said.
   At the settlement's day care center, Diana visited a group of 11
children ages 2 to 5, crouching low to admire the valentines they
were making and chatting softly with them. She tied the shoe of one
boy.
   She complimented the work of another youngster, saying, ``I love
the Cupid in the heart. Is that for Mommy?'' related teacher Janeth
Holmes.
   Day care center director Karen Leslie said of the children,
``They're crazed _ there's no ifs, ands or buts about it.''
   Hundreds of residents of the adjacent Baruch Houses project
filled the sidewalks hoping for a glimpse at the princess, who twice
during her tour came as close to the crowds as police barricades
allowed.
   ``We can hold our head up high and say, `Princess Diana came to
the Lower East Side,''' said Wanda Morales, who shook Diana's hand.

<HEAD>Elderly Woman Who Loves Cats Fined $50 For Leash-Law Violation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elderly widow who faced up to $900 in
fines for failing to curb a cat lost her court case Thursday, but
was fined only $50.
   A Municipal Court jury found that 80-year-old Nan Farris violated
the city's leash law and failed to immunize one of her cats against
rabies as required by city ordinance.
   A neighbor claimed that numerous cats fed by Ms. Farris used his
property as a litter box, but the case in court involved only one
pet.
   Ms. Farris' attorney said the fine would be appealed. But Ms.
Farris, who lives on a monthly $410 Social Security payment, also
promised to do a better job keeping track of her felines.
   ``If they get out, I can't help it,'' she said after the hearing.
``But I'm going to do my best to keep them on my own property.''
   Charges against Ms. Farris involve two of six citations she has
received since July, resulting from complaints filed with the Animal
Control Department by neighbor Ralph Neal.
   Neal, in testimony Wednesday, said Ms. Farris' penchant for
feeding stray animals had created an ``unbearable'' problem, with
cats invading and defecating upon his property.
   ``I had piles _ mounds _ of dung in my flower bed,'' Neal, 56,
testified. ``The stench was unbearable. I couldn't even open my
windows.''
   Further testimony revealed that one of the cats Ms. Farris had
fed came from Neal's son and daughter-in-law.

<HEAD>Former Sheriff Charged With Hiring Hit Men To Bomb Political Foe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former sheriff was arrested Thursday and
charged with hiring hit men to detonate a bomb that nearly killed
the man who defeated him in his bid for re-election.
   Former Lafourche Parish Sheriff Cyrus ``Bobby'' Tardo, 58, of
Thibodaux, who was defeated in 1975 by Sheriff Duffy Breaux, was
arrested along with a former policeman, Ralph Bergeron, 42, of
Slaughter.
   U.S. Attorney John Volz refused to give a motive or say whether
Tardo was after Breaux because of a political vendetta.
   ``It's safe to say he supplied the money and wanted it done,''
Volz said.
   The bomb, made of pipe stuffed with explosives, bullets and nails
and hidden in a sack, exploded Dec. 15 outside Breaux's car,
injuring Breaux, 60, and part-time Deputy Sheriff Daniel Leche, 62,
as they left a Christmas party at Thibodaux.
   The bomb nearly blew off Breaux' foot as he was entering the car,
but he underwent massive reconstructive surgery and is recovering.
Leche was less severly injured.
   Mike Hall, a U.S. Treasury agent with the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, said $20,000 was promised for the job, but
only $10,000 was actually paid to the hitmen.
   He said former policemen Marshall McClendon, 42, of Slaughter and
John Tullier Jr., 23, of St. Amant, both of whom were arrested
Tuesday, were paid $8,000 after the explosion and that McClendon got
$2,000 more.
   In addition, Bergeron, who was said to own the remote control
device that set off the bomb, was paid $666, Hall said.
   A criminal complaint, filed after the Thursday arrests, said an
unidentified man came to authorities and admitted his part in the
scheme and helped catch the others.
   ``On Feb. 2, special agents of the ATF monitored a conversation
between a confidential source and Cyrus `Bobby' Tardo,'' the
complaint said.
   ``During the meeting, Tardo described his knowledge of the
bombing ... and admitted supplying officer McClendon an extra $2,000
for his part in the bombing and gave the confidential source $100 to
help him leave town and admitted that he (Tardo) entered into an
agreement with McClendon that McClendon would remain silent if
arrested.''
   Tardo, a retired state policeman who is now a private
investigator and insurance agent, was sheriff from 1971 to 1975,
when he was defeated by Breaux. He later lost a 1980 election for a
Louisiana House of Representatives seat, and served as president of
the Lafourche Parish Council from 1983-87. He was defeated in a
re-election bid.
   The Thursday arrests came shortly after a federal grand jury
indicted McClendon and Tullier in connection with the bombing.
Charges against Tardo and Bergeron were the same as those against
the others in the indictment.
   They were one count of conspiracy to maliciously damage the
sheriff's vehicle, one count of damaging the vehicle and one count
of illegal possession of a destructive device.
   The men face maximum penalties of 35 years in prison and a
$750,000 fine on the federal charges, said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Fred Harper. They also face two counts each of attempted murder
filed by the Lafourche Parish district attorneys' office Wednesday.

   Vice President Dan Quayle on Thursday
criticized former President Carter for meeting with Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega, saying such action ``has a chance of
complicating matters.''
   Quayle also criticized Carter for comments reporters said the
former president hadmade urging the Bush administration to use
economic persuasion in El Salvador to encourage the U.S.-backed
government there to fight human rights abuses.
   ``If he's calling for economic sanctions against El Salvador,
yes, he's complicating matters,'' Quayle said. ``I don't think it's
particularly helpful for a former president to make those kind of
statements.''
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater,
asked about the Quayle criticism of Carter, said, ``I'm not aware of
what the vice president said nor do I have any reaction from the
president. I saw the picture of former President Carter and Danny
Ortega on the couch there this morning _ they looked pretty
comfortable.''
   Quayle, on his first diplomatic mission as vice president, was to
stop Friday in El Salvador after leaving Caracas. He has said he
wants to emphasize concern for human rights and support for
democracy there.
   Asked if he has talked to President Bush since arriving Wednesday
in Venezuela, Quayle said no, noting Bush has laryngitis and a cold.
   Carter, who like Quayle was in Caracas for Thursday's
inauguration of President Carlos Andres Perez, said Wednesday night
that he and Perez had met with Ortega earlier in the day and that
Ortega shared with them a new proposal to resolve Nicaragua's war
against the Contra rebels.
   He declined to discuss details of Ortega's plan with reporters,
and U.S. officials said they had not seen it.
   But officials said they had heard from those familiar with it
that it dealt with resettlement of the Contras. And Carter
characterized it as pricipally a matter between Nicaragua and
Honduras, which the Contras have used as a staging ground.
   The U.S. government has refused to hold talks with Ortega's
government, saying the Sandinistas must first negotiate with their
opposition.
   ``Obviously when you have a former president meeting with heads
of state we don't meet with, it has a chance of complicating
matters,'' Quayle said at a news conference following the inaugural
ceremony.
   He said the U.S. goal is to see free and fair elections in
Nicaragua and a regional solution to Central America's problems.
   During a current hiatus, with no congressional money in the
pipeline for the Contras, Quayle said, Ortega should hold a
``serious dialogue with the resistance within his own country'' and
neighboring nations.
   ``We are going to give the diplomatic route a chance,'' Quayle
said. But he added that he felt the situation in Nicaragua had
worsened since the cutoff of U.S. military aid to the Contras.
   ``This is a testing period for us,'' to see if Ortega is serious
about following conditions set out in the 1987 peace plan agreed to
by five Central American presidents at a meeting in Guatemala, he
said.
   Contra leader Alfredo Cesar, also attending the inauguration,
said that Quayle told him the Bush administraton supports the
Contras but that he offered no specific commitment.
   Ortega and Cuban President Fidel Castro met briefly in the
Caracas Hilton hotel lobby Thursday morning, as Quayle held meetings
upstairs with Spain's Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and Brazil's
President Jose Sarney.
   The meeting with Sarney centered on the Latin debt crisis. Sarney
urged Quayle to consider the adverse affect that his country's debt
has on Brazil's ability to promote democratic institutions, said
Quayle spokesman David Beckwith.
   U.S. officials here said Quayle is making no promises about the
Bush administration's developing policy regarding the debt.
   Quayle's day also included meetings with presidents of Costa
Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Peru and Portugal and a lunch with
Caribbean leaders.
   `You can feel the good chemistry,'' Quayle said. ``You can feel
the positive, upbeat mood that they're in'' in looking to dealings
with the Bush administration.
   After meeting with Quayle, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias said
he is encouraged about the new administration, and is convinced
President Bush will hold give the Central Americans a chance to
resolve their problems diplomatically.
   But he said Quayle didn't make any specific commitment on renewed
Contra aid.
   Arias also said he had not received anything new from Ortega in
the way of a peace proposal.
   But President Vinicio Cerezo told reporters before meeting Quayle
that from what he has heard of the Ortega proposal, he believes it
represents a political opening and is a ``good plan, a good position
to open'' talks again.
   Rounding out a long day of bilateral sessions, Quayle also met
President Alan Garcia of Peru before a late night session with
Portugal's Mario Soares.

   Three men and two boys were arrested
Thursday after four armed robberies of Amish residents near this
rural town over the past two weeks, authorities said.
   ``I feel that we've got all the people involved in the Amish
robberies,'' said Lawrence County Sheriff Tom Pyrdum.
   Six Amish residents in the county about 60 miles south of
Nashville were robbed in a string of holdups that began Jan. 22 when
a gunman took $85 from two men in a milk barn.
   On Jan. 28, an armed man leaped into two Amish buggies traveling
down a dark country road. About $140 was taken in those holdups.
   On Jan. 30, an Amish harnessmaker was held up at his shop by two
men in a pickup truck who made off with about $300.
   Michael McConnell, no age available, Rodney J.D. Smith, 18, and
James E. Smith Jr., 22, each were charged with one count of armed
robbery, and additional charges were expected, Pyrdum said.
   The sheriff identified McConnell as the uncle of the Smiths, who
he said are brothers. Each was being held on $250,000 bond pending a
hearing Friday, he said.
   The two other suspects, ages 16 and 17, were being held by
juvenile authorities, said Pyrdum. All five suspects are from
Lawrenceburg.
   Pyrum said the arrests came after investigators matched a partial
license plate number with a description of the pickup used in the
last holdup. He also said that two of the adults had confessed to
the robberies.
   The sheriff said he expected the full cooperation of the Amish
victims in prosecuting the suspects.
   ``They're very interested in getting these people caught,'' said
Pyrdum. ``Although the Amish are not known as prosecutors, they will
testify.''
   The Amish, a conservative sect of the Mennonite Church, are noted
for their simple lifestyle, which includes wearing plain, dark
clothing. They do not use electricity or motorized vehicles and
refuse to bear arms for self-defense or to take oaths.
   The Lawrence County Amish, who number fewer than 500, came to
southern Tennessee from Pennsylvania in 1944. Most of them farm,
although some also produce leather goods and furniture or do
carpentry and blacksmith work.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Schools in a northern port city shut
down on Thursday after students walked out to protest a government
claim that a peasant revolt was brewing, radio reports said.
   The government, meanwhile, said it has found new evidence that a
revolt was imminent and said the developments ``justify urgent
government measures.''
   The independent Radio Metropole said the students in Gonaives
charged that the government was looking for an excuse to crack down
on peasants and opposition leaders.
   Tires were set afire in some Gonaives streets, but no violence
was reported in the city.
   The protest came after a memo from Information Minister Anthony
Saint-Pierre advised Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, the country's military
ruler, that the Communist Party and other leftist groups were
planning an armed insurrection with large landowners.
   The memo said the rebellion was being supported by the Roman
Catholic Church, according to Haitian radio stations.
   The memorandum, dated Jan. 13, alleged the insurrection would
occur ``in the next few days'' and recommended that it be put down
``by force and even with bloodshed.''
   Col. Carl Dorsainvil, the defense and interior minister, backed
the earlier memo said in a new statement.
   ``This report provoked the immediate creation of an investigation
commission. The first results have confirmed the existence of
certain problems which really justify urgent government measures,''
said a communique signed by Dorsainvil and broadcast by several
radio stations Thursday.
   Late Wednesday, nine political and union leaders, in a joint
statement broadcast by independent Radio Metropole, called for
Avril's resignation, saying he ``has shown his determination to
perpetuate the autocratic and bloody Duvalierist regime.''
   Dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to France in 1986, ending a
29-year family dynasty.
   In his memorandum, Saint-Pierre charged that the ``peasant
insurrection'' was being led by the Peasant Movement of Papaye in
Haiti's Central Plateau with help from the Congress of Democratic
Forces, an umbrella group of several leftist organizations.
   Victor Benoit, the group's co-leader who was named by
Saint-Pierre as an instigator of the uprising, also denied
involvement and said Thursday he would sue the information minister.
   ``Today, the life of every democrat in this country is
threatened,'' Benoit said on independent Radio Haiti Inter.
   About 80 percent of Haitians are impoverished peasants, and many
of them work for wealthy landowners. In July 1987 about 300 landless
peasants demanding land reform near the northwest town of Jean Rabel
were killed in a clash with sharecroppers working for landowners.
   Avril became president after soldiers, demanding a return to
democracy, ousted former ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy on Sept. 17.
Namphy came to power after Duvalier left in 1986.

   All 52 cars of a freight train derailed near
here Thursday, halting passenger rail service between Seattle and
Minneapolis and stranding Amtrak passengers, officials said.
   About 10.4 million pounds of corn spilled from the cars, blocking
traffic on both mainline tracks, said Glacier National Park
spokesman Jerry Nelson.
   Gus Melonas, a Burlington Northern Railroad spokesman in Havre,
cars were strewn over a three-mile stretch of track. No one was
injured and the cause of the derailment was under investigation, he
said.
   Most of the 123 passengers on Amtrak's westbound Empire Builder
were stranded in Havre, a town of 10,000 near the Canadian border
and about 200 miles east of the derailment. Most of the passengers
were staying at the LeHavre Inn.
   Shannon Shearer of Bucksport, Maine, said she was traveling to
Spokane, Wash.
   ``The Amtrak people have been super to us. As for what we're
doing in Havre, we're just kind of visiting and taking it all in,''
she said.
   Erling Strandlund, an Amtrak chef, said his train had stopped
Wednesday near Havre just before midnight ``because of engine
troubles and the freezing cold.''
   Temperatures in the area have been hovering at 30-40 degrees
below zero for several days.
   ``We were prepared to head west this morning, but now, with the
derailment ahead to the west, I have no idea how long we'll be
here,'' Strandlund said.
   The derailment near the southern tip of Glacier National Park was
the third in that area in the past six weeks.
   Plans were being made to route freight trains around the
derailment, but Amtrak officials said passenger trains eastbound
from Seattle and westbound from Minneapolis were canceled until
further notice.
   Passengers already in transit between the two cities were being
bused around the derailment, officials said.

<HEAD>Spraggett, Yusupov Draw Eighth Game</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>QUEBEC (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kevin Spraggett of Canada and Artur Yusupov of the
Soviet Union tied the eighth game in their World Chess Championship
Candidates quarterfinal on Thursday, forcing the contest into
high-speed tiebreakers.
   The 51-move draw left the match score tied 4-4. On Saturday, they
will begin a series of sudden-death encounters played at an
increasingly fast pace.
   In the first game, each player will have an hour's thinking time
for the entire game. If there is no victor, the time will be reduced
to a half hour each for the second duel, and halved again to 15
minutes each for the third game.
   If necesary, more 15-minute games will be played until one player
wins.
   At a brief drawing of lots ceremony, Spraggett, a 34-year-old
from Montreal and pre-match underdog, was loudly applauded when he
gained the advantage of the white pieces for the first game.
   The winner of the contest will advance to the semifinal stage.
The winner of the Candidates will challenge world champion Garri
Kasparov for his title in 1990.
   Playing white in an English opening, Spraggett saddled Yusupov
with weak Queenside pawns and forced Yusupov on to the defensive.
   But the 28-year-old Muscovite defended accurately and Spraggett
offered a draw after a five and half hour battle.
   ``It`s very dificult at this level to nurture a small
advantage,'' said Jean Hebert, a Candadian international master who
is commenting on the games.
   Canadians are hoping Spraggett will triumph in the blitz finish
and become the first North American since Bobby Fischer to reach the
world chess semifinals.
   In the previous stage of the competition, Spraggett scored a
dramatic, giantkilling victory over Soviet Grandmaster Andrei
Sokolov in their fourth tiebreaking game.
   Hebert said Spraggett will go into the sudden-death playoff with
an advantage ``because he's got strong nerves.'
   Other experts said Yusupov`s extensive international experience
could be the decisive factor.
   British Grandmaster Jonathan Speelman is already through to the
semifinals.
   In the third match, under way in Seattle, former world champion
Anatoly Karpov of the Soviet Union has established a crushing
2.5-0.5 lead over Iceland's Johann Hjartarson.
   After two games, Dutch Grandmaster Jan Timman and Lajos Portisch
of Hungary are tied with 1 point apiece in their six-game duel in
Antwerp, Belgium.

   A military fighter-bomber crashed Thursday in
northeastern Vermont, with its two crewmen parachuting to safety
just seconds before the plane hit the ground.
   ``They were at about 1,000 feet when they separated,'' said Gary
Boog, a doctor who saw the crash from his car. ``Then the plane hit
the ground and exploded. And it just disintegrated. There are parts
scattered a quarter mile in every direction.''
   A military spokesman would not say whether the FB-111 was armed,
but local emergency rescue officials told people at the scene it was
not.
   The plane, a medium-range fighter-bomber with a two-man crew, was
based at the U.S. Air Force base in Plattsburgh, N.Y., which is
about 80 miles west of the crash site.
   The pilot was Capt. Randall F. Voorhees and the navigator Capt.
Len J. Esterly Jr., said Sgt. Annette Crawford, a spokeswoman at the
Plattsburgh base. She said ages and hometowns were not immediately
available.
   The two ejected in a a pod. A spruce tree branch broke through
the capsule on impact, bruising Voorhees on the back of his knee,
said David Eastman, 34, a former Air Force sergeant who heard the
crash and set out on snowshoes with a friend to find the two near
his property.
   The two crew members were taken back to the base Thursday
afternoon by helicopter.
   State police said the two airman walked a quarter of a mile from
the crash to a farmhouse where they waited for a car that drove them
to a designated clearing off Route 2 for the helicopter to pick them
up.
   ``He seemed to be a lot calmer than I was when I found out about
it,'' said Trooper Leo Willey of his telephone conversation with the
pilot.
   The FB-111 can carry nuclear and conventional weapons. The same
type of plane was used in the 1986 raid on Libya.
   The jet crashed in the town of Kirby, next to St. Johnsbury,
about 10 miles west of the New Hampshire border. It went down in
woods less than a mile from heavily traveled Route 2. Boog was
driving on that road when ``out of the corner of my eye, I saw this
jet flashing real low.''
   ``The plane was not on fire,'' he said.
   Boog said he borrowed a snowmobile from a house and went to the
crash site, but found the airmen gone. When he was told they were
uninjured he returned the snowmobile.
   Lucy Maroney was at her mother's when the plane crashed on her
mother's property.
   ``It sounded just like a jet was flying real low but then there
was this loud noise that I thought was a sonic boom. It was the
crash,'' she said. ``I looked out the window and we could see flames
and saw a parachute coming down.''
   Donald Godbut, a state employee at Cannon Mountain ski area, was
in his front yard in neighboring Littleton, N.H., at 11:45 a.m.
   ``I heard an explosion, and I looked up in the air in the
direction of the explosion,'' Godbut said. ``I could see a large
giant puff ball of smoke, probably 300 to 400 feet across rising
into the sky.''
   The FB-111 can fly at more than twice the speed of sound and is a
sweep-wing plane, which means it can change the angle of its wings
to increase speed when traveling at supersonic speeds.

   In a Washington courtroom, a judge is looking
for that rarest of creatures _ the person who barely knows anything
about Oliver North.
   The judge selecting jurors to try North is making some progress,
but the question arises: Will the jury that results be a
cross-section of the community, capable of rendering an informed
judgment?
   In the legal sense, it will be a jury of North's peers. The law
only requires that it be a cross-section of citizens from which no
one has been excluded by reason of sex, race or other arbitrary
criteria. It need not be people comparable to North in any other way.
   What Judge Gerhard A. Gesell seeks is a jury ``ignorant'' of
North's activities _ people so removed from world affairs during the
summer of 1987 that they were unaware that North told Congress he
had lied to it, believing his duty to his country required such
deception.

   House Speaker Jim Wright is moving to limit
political damage from an imminent 50 percent congressional pay raise
by offering a follow-up vote to roll the increase back to 30 percent.
   Wright floated the idea of a follow-up vote on Wednesday, as
House members nervous about the reaction back home to the 50 percent
raise told news media and public interest groups that they wanted a
chance to reject it.
   Wright's office said results of a private survey of lawmakers
could be released today, including whether members demanded a vote
on the 50 percent raise that will become law next Wednesday unless
both houses vote to stop it.
   Senators are virtually certain to vote today or Friday to turn
down the proposal to raise congressional pay from $89,500 to
$135,000. House leaders initially planned not to hold any vote,
letting the increase become law, but there were signs that resolve
was wavering on Wednesday.

   Former Rep. Jack Kemp has agreed to return or
give up more than $55,000 in speaking fees after being told by a
Senate committee he had apparently violated federal limits on
outside income for members of Congress.
   Kemp's nomination by President Bush to become secretary of
Housing and Urban Development was before the Senate Banking
Committee today, where it was expected to be approved and sent to
the Senate floor for confirmation.
   Kemp filed financial disclosure forms last week with the
committee and the federal Office of Government Ethics reporting
honoraria amounting to $67,350 above what House rules allow.
   The Associated Press learned Wednesday that the staff director of
the Democratic-controlled committee, Kevin Gottlieb, confronted Kemp
personally last week with the apparent violation.

   Leading Southern Democrats are lining up to
help Ronald H. Brown counter complaints about his liberal ties and
smooth his transition to the chairmanship of the Democratic Party.
   Govs. Ray Mabus of Mississippi and Bill Clinton of Arkansas
planned to greet Brown as he opened a two-day swing through the
region where his links to Edward M. Kennedy and Jesse Jackson
produced the most objections from conservative Democrats.
   An Associated Press survey of elected and party officials around
the country found strong support for Brown, coupled with advice that
he quickly establish his independence and demonstrate a commitment
to keep the party in the political mainstream.
   Brown's four rivals for the party chairmanship have dropped out
of the race, leaving him a sure winner when the Democratic National
Committee elects a successor to Paul G. Kirk Jr. on Feb. 10.

   Tons of equipment that left the United
States on an Air Force transport with a team of clean-up experts
headed for Antarctica today to tackle an oil spill that poses a
major environmental threat.
   The huge C-5 plane was bound for the southern city of Punta
Arenas, where its cargo and the 15-member team will be transferred
to a U.S. research vessel, the Polar Duke, the U.S. Embassy in
Santiago said.
   In the Antarctic, U.S. scientists were trying to catch floating
oil barrels and propane containers near the spill, which was four
miles in diameter and moving to the southwest, the National Science
Foundation said.
   The agency said in Washington that the Argentine supply vessel
that released the oil after it ran aground and sank had carried
250,000 gallons of diesel fuel. It said an ``incurable disaster''
would result if all the fuel leaks into the pristine region's
unspoiled waters.

   Scientists say they are certain that a natural
poison caused the massive die-off of bottlenose dolphins in 1987 and
1988, but they still are puzzled by the persistence of the deadly
``red tide'' that arose in the Gulf of Mexico and moved up the East
Coast.
   ``We have never found this before in history,'' said Joseph
Geraci, a wildlife specialist who headed a team of federal
researchers.
   Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Geraci said laboratory
findings confirm that the dolphins that died had eaten fish
contaminated with a powerful poison, called brevertoxin, originating
from the persistent bloom of red tide algae.
   Gerald Scott, a federal fisheries expert, estimated that 50
percent of the dolphins living off the coast were killed, and said
it could take 100 years for their numbers to recover.

   Love is in the air at two zoos where
scientists hope the world's last 28 California condors will mate
themselves away from the brink of extinction, a biologist says.
   Meanwhile, one of seven Andean condors freed into the wilderness
chickened out of a dogfight with two golden eagles half her size.
   ``We've got all sorts of great things happening with the Andeans
and some equally exciting things happening with the captive
California condors. We're very encouraged,'' Joseph Dowhan, U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service condor recovery coordinator, said
Wednesday.
   Only 28 endangered California condors remain, 14 in captivity at
the Los Angeles Zoo and 14 others at the San Diego Wild Animal Park
in Escondido. Scientists hope the vulture-like creatures, which are
North America's largest land birds with 9{-foot wingspans, will
reproduce enough so that some can be returned to the wild in five to
10 years.

<HEAD>Peter Falk and Burt Reynolds Join TV Lineup with Mixed Results</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Columbo'' is back, but the first in a series of
new two-hour movies, kicking off ``The ABC Monday Mystery Movie,''
sputters like that old Peugeot the rumpled detective drives.
   Peter Falk is back, but the plot seems to be a ``Murder, She
Wrote'' episode stretched into two hours. Was the show always this
dull? Did it just seem more interesting in the 1970s?
   The following week, Burt Reynolds also returns to the small
screen in his share of the three-movie rotating wheel, ``B.L.
Stryker.'' His show is a ``Miami Vice'' episode stretched into two
hours, but Reynolds is well-cast as a beer-swilling ex-cop who has
come home to Palm Beach after losing his cool, and his badge, in New
Orleans. He's helped by some spunky writing and a fine supporting
cast that includes Rita Moreno and Ossie Davis.
   Falk, bless his heart, is so overjoyed to be back in his old
raincoat, he overplays the part, shrugging, shuffling and flailing
like Ronald Reagan with reporters shouting questions at him. He
seems too conscious of the character. You know how little kids are
unintentionally cute, but then they get older and start trying to be
cute, and they're not?
   At least the producers knew not to mess with the formula, which
is exactly the same. First we see the murder, then, silly us, we
worry whether Columbo will figure it out.
   This is an open mystery _ the audience knows the answer but the
hero doesn't _ and they're difficult to write. In the premiere, the
villain is a psychic, played by Anthony Andrews, who beheads a
magician (Anthony Zerbe) who threatens to expose him as a fake.
   After about a 30-minute setup, we return from a commercial break
to a darkened street. The familiar coughing car lumbers into the
frame. Inside, a dark figure lights a cigar. Columbo! There's even
an appropriate pause apparently designed so viewers can stand and
applaud in their living rooms.
   From there on, though, the plot wears as thin as that raincoat
that was once rumored to be hanging in the Smithsonian Institution.
It actually has been in Falk's closet.
   ``Columbo'' left the air in 1977, and Falk went on to a
successful film career. He's enjoying himself in his old role, so
who's to complain? There's a lot worse on network television.
   Reynolds, whose film career has waned in recent years, has found
himself a nice little vehicle in ``B.L. Stryker.'' The B.L. stands
for ``Buddy Lee.''
   A pan of photos on his apartment wall reveals volumes about the
ex-football player _ his wife's face is carefully cut out of his
wedding picture.
   Rita Moreno plays Kimberly, Stryker's oft-wed, gold-digging ex _
her most recent hubby is played by Abe Vigoda. Ossie Davis is
Stryker's old friend Oz Jackson.
   The show is filmed on location in Florida and comes from Tom
Selleck's production company _ Selleck is executive producer _ hence
the same good-natured feel as ``Magnum, P.I.''
   In the opener, Stryker is haunted by his New Orleans past and a
bizarre string of sex crimes in pricey Palm Beach. He tries to help
the local cops while being hounded by a Aussie-sounding reporter
from a supermarket tabloid. ``I always wanted to be on the cover of
your magazine,'' Stryker tells him, ``right next to `Hermaphrodite
Gives Birth on Oprah Show.'''
   He falls for a psychiatrist (Helen Shavers) called in by the cops
and tries to impress her by taking her to dinner at a fancy
restaurant.
   ``This is a nice place,'' she purrs.
   ``This is my hangout,'' he lies. ``I come here all the time.''

<HEAD>Arms Industry in Neutral Sweden Bracing for Difficulties</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For a small neutral country at peace for 175
years, Sweden makes a lot of weapons but its arms industry is
worried about the future.
   The Swedes build their own jet fighters, naval crusiers and
patrol boats, artillery, tanks and anti-tank guns, rifles,
laser-guided missiles, explosives, radar _ enough weaponry to supply
most of its needs.
   But the arms makers are worried because of cutbacks in Swedish
military spending and escalating production costs. Companies are
trimming production and talking about merging.
   ``It's been considered part of our security policy to produce
weapons systems that are necessary to defend Sweden. But that policy
has started to creak at the joints,'' said Paul Palsson, president
of the state-owned Kockums Marine AB, which builds submarines.
   ``Sweden is too small a market to carry the arms industry it has.
You have to get out and export.''
   With a shrinking home market, pressure to export has prompted
some big companies to evade regulations banning sales to countries
at war or even to regions where conflict is likely.
   Two businessmen are on trial for illegal gunpowder exports. Four
executives of Bofors AB, the country's biggest arms producer, face
prosecution on charges of selling weapons to Iran and other Persian
Gulf states.
   The country's military chief, Supreme Cmdr. Bengt Gustafsson, has
said defense policy may have to be redefined, unless the military
gets more money.
   The defense network can no longer afford to keep the arms
industry filled with orders, Gustafsson said. His gloomy reports on
the state of the military have triggered one of the biggest defense
debates here since World War II.
   ``It feels unreal to hear the Swedish military talk about more
money at a time of international detente,'' said Maj-Britt Theorin,
a leading member of the governing Social Democratic Party.
   Dealing in weapons is a sensitive issue in a nation that
champions world disarmament and where the Swedish Peace and
Arbitration Society, a peace-promoting group, has been active for
105 years.
   But defense has become closely linked to economic goals for
Sweden's welfare state and a population of 8.5 million _ full
employment, regional development and the well-being of the big
companies.
   Companies at the heart of Sweden's civilian export industry also
are involved in arms production:
   _Automaker Saab-Scania AB also builds airplanes.
   _Ericsson, the telecommunications giant, also makes sophisticated
electronic military hardware.
   Weapons makers employ 27,000 people, or almost 3 percent of the
industrial work force. Arms exports account for less than 1 percent
of total foreign business, but they bring enough to keep production
lines going.
   The stakes are high in major projects like the development of a
new multirole combat plane, the JAS 39 Gripen.
   The project, which already has consumed roughly $1.7 billion, is
18 months behind schedule. Estimates of the final cost _ around $7
billion _ are rising so fast that the plane risks being scrapped.
   Gustafsson told a news conference that the project could pay off
in the long run, but he added that unless the military got more
government money it might have to take the cheaper option and buy an
American plane.
   Georg Harnsund, head of Saab-Scania, said if the air force
cancels the order, it could spell the end of the Swedish aviation
industry. That would cost thousands of jobs, many of them in
one-industry towns, he said.
   Sweden has strict export laws that effectively rule out selling
weapons to the countries that use them most.
   About 25 percent of total arms production, mainly ammunition and
explosives, is exported, but few of the expensive weapon systems
have been sold abroad.
   That will have to change if the arms industry is to survive, said
Palsson, whose shipbuilders secured a $2.5 billion deal in 1987 to
develop a submarine industry in Australia.
   The Australian contract, including the sale of eight Swedish
vessels, and the 1986 sale of $1.4 billion worth of artillery to
India, were the two largest arms deals in Swedish history.

   Farmers seem to always be looking for ways of
adding to family income, sometimes by moonlighting in town, driving
a school bus, or by setting up roadside stands to peddle seasonal
produce.
   Sometimes a sideline can become a full-time business, one of the
alternatives to traditional crops-and-livestock farming. These days
it can include llamas, water buffalos, deer and ostriches.
   A two-day conference last week at the Agriculture Department
concentrated on LISA, the acronym invented to describe ``low-input,
sustainable agriculture.'' It means producing food by using more
sense and less chemicals.
   Mostly, the meetings included case histories of farmers who have
learned or are trying to learn how to reduce expenses by using less
fertilizer, pesticides and other ``inputs'' while making a living
and improving their land.
   The LISA program is part of an overall thrust by the government,
including legislation and $3.9 million provided by Congress, to help
farmers _ large and small _ look at alternative systems for
producing crops and livestock.
   One of the components is the Office for Small-Scale Agriculture,
which is operated by USDA's Cooperative State Research Service. For
some time, the office has been grinding out one-sheet reports about
the alternatives available to small producers.
   Some of the previous topics include sheep, goats, mushrooms,
foliage plants, herbs, wildflowers and specialty vegetables.
   The latest one-sheeter, prepared by editor George B. Holcomb, is
``Exotic Livestock.'' And the report begins by asking about beefalo,
the crossbred critter of beef and buffalo origins that stirred
imaginations a few years back.
   ``Where's the beefalo? It's still around, but the excitement is
gone,'' the report said. ``Such a query arises because introduction
of exotic types of creatures into a country where they are scarce
encourages speculators to bid prices extremely high.''
   In that case, breeding stock becomes the focus rather than the
basic use of the animal for meat, work, hide, fur or feathers.
   But American consumers, affluent and with sometimes incredible
appetites for exotic menu items, can exert powerful influence.
   For example, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA's
agency that oversees inspection of meat and poultry, has changed its
rules to include reindeer, elk, antelope, water buffalo and deer as
``exotic'' animals.
   Previously, the agency's exotic list included only American
bison, or buffalo, and cattalo or beefalo.
   Officials say fewer than 2,000 ``exotic'' animals are slaughtered
annually in the United States, compared with more than 32 million
cattle each year.
   But because of rising demand from restaurants, small-scale
producers of exotic animals are finding it profitable to market
federally inspected meat from certain species, the report said.
   Meanwhile, there has been a growing demand for other exotic
animals, and sometimes the prices are sky-high.
   ``For the moment, the biggest dollar demand is for such exotics
as ostriches and South American humpless camels such as llamas,
alpacas, guanacos and vicunas,'' the report said. ``Little demand is
noted for Alaska's yaks or musk oxen.''
   According to a quarterly publication, Llama Life, in 1987 a
company called Camelids Inc. sold 52 male and female llamas at an
estimated cost of more than $1 million. One buyer paid $100,000 each
for two breeding males.
   ``Some people predict that 3,500 U.S. owners of 12,000 llamas
will begin to price themselves out of the market, even if camelid
wool is sought by handspinners and weavers, and the pack animals are
used in sorts of fund-raising events,'' the report said.
   Llamas, fabled pack animals in the Andes of South America, are
often used for that purpose by the USDA's Forest Service when
venturing into wilderness areas because they are less intrusive on
the environment than horses and mules.
   Unlike llamas, water buffalos aren't in great demand, the report
said. But there has been commercial herd development in the United
States since 1978. There are two types, both used for work and meat:
the swamp buffalo, or carabao, which is rarely used for milk, and
the river buffalo, which is noted for its milk.
   Breeds of the river buffalo are commonly found in the temperate
climates of Italy, Albania, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, some areas
of the Soviet Union, and in cold, mountainous areas of Pakistan,
Afghanistan and Nepal.
   ``Latin America countries are beginning to catch on to their
value,'' the report said. ``About 18 different breeds of both types
can work in tropical mud that can bog down a tractor. One of these
animals can work as many as 20 years.''
   The European fallow deer is another farming possibility on the
exotic side. Currently, U.S. restaurants import 500 to 1,000 tons of
venison annually, mostly from New Zealand. But a problem with deer
and elk is that a fence about seven feet high is needed to keep the
animals under control, a major expense in getting started.
   West Germany, which has about 2,000 deer farms, still imports
more than 20,000 tons of venison annually, the report said.
   If large poultry is preferred, try ostriches. There are several
ostrich ranches in Oklahoma, dating back to 1981, the report said.
Pairs of breeding size adults bring $12,000 to $30,000 each,
depending on age and quality. Chicks at last report cost $1,000 each
at eight weeks, when sex can be distinguished.
   For free single copies of the report, ``Exotic Livestock,'' write

   It's a story fit for the movies.
   Two of this country's greatest inventors, George Eastman and
Thomas Edison, got together one day to discuss the motion picture
industry they were helping create.
   Eastman already had invented the process to make long rolls of
film and Edison had patented his movie camera. Both were comparing
notes and seeking refinements.
   At one point, Eastman, founder of the Eastman Kodak Co.,
supposedly asked Edison how wide the camera film should be. Edison,
holding thumb and forefinger about an inch apart, said, ``About so
wide.''
   That width, 1] inches, better known as 35mm, became and remains
the standard size for the black celluloid that's been used for a
century to hold the dramas, comedies and happy endings that appear
on the silver screen.
   Who knows if the story is true. It's been told so many times,
altered and edited, that it's impossible to determine exactly when
or even if the conversation occurred, said Kodak spokesman Henry
Kaska.
   ``You just have to say, `Legend has it ...,''' Kaska said.
   This year Kodak is celebrating its 100th anniversary making movie
film, which in terms of miles manufactured is the photo giant's
leading film product.
   ``1889 is the year we sold our first length of motion picture
film _ to Thomas Edison, that much we're sure of,'' Kaska said.
   Edison opened a production company and released 5,000 movie
titles _ shorts of vaudeville acts or boxing matches _ by 1900. He
is credited with starting the entertainment form.
   Kodak always has maintained a subtle role in the movie business,
supplying generations of filmmakers, from pioneers like Edwin S.
Porter, D.W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille to today's kingpins like
Stephen Spielberg and Francis Ford Coppola.
   For many years, Kodak was the only practical supplier of film to
the burgeoning industry and today the company still dominates.
   Its low profile dates to the days of Eastman, who refused to
enter the movie production business and insisted on accepting cash
in advance for movie film, never a share of profits.
   ``George Eastman didn't trust filmmakers. If a film lost money,
he didn't want to lose with it,'' said Chris Horak, curator of film
at the International Museum of Photography in Rochester, where Kodak
is based.
   Moviemakers constantly visited the company offering a percentage
of their profits to Kodak in exchange for free film, but always have
been rejected.
   That policy remains in effect.
   Horak said the no-free-film rule also applies to a Kodak program
that supports young filmmakers who can't afford to buy film.
   ``They give them money and tell them to buy the film,'' Horak
said.
   Kodak's movie division also maintains a low profile within the
company because the division generates about $350 million a year in
sales, a fraction of the company's $17 billion in annual sales.
   Nonetheless, Kodak remains the overwhelming favorite among
moviemakers worldwide, said Jean Turner, associate editor of
American Cinematographer.
   The magazine, published by the American Society of
Cinematographers, has been interviewing moviemakers for 70 years and
nearly all have said they use Kodak film.
   ``We do 12 issues a year and talk to at least three
cinematographers in each issue. I would say we usually find one or
two that don't use Kodak film. In 1988, we didn't have anyone,''
Turner said.
   Horak said without Kodak in the early 1900s, there wouldn't have
been a thriving movie business. Today Kodak is by far the leading
seller of all movie film in America, although Fuji Photofilm Co., of
Japan, and Agfa-Gevaert AG, of West Germany, have started winning
acceptance.
   ``The foreign film has gained in quality over the past couple of
years and as a result I think more people are starting to think
about using it,'' said Fred Austin, vice president of Deluxe
Laboratories Inc. in Hollywood, Calif.
   DeLuxe printed about half of all the Hollywood movies last year,
and Austin said about 80 percent of the film it uses is Kodak-made.
   Fuji and Agfa films are attractive, Austin said, because a studio
can usually get a discount by buying a certain amount of film, a
practice Kodak refuses to offer.
   So, while filmmakers may insist on using Kodak film to shoot
movies, a studio may insist on another film to make the 1,000 copies
sent to movie theaters worldwide.
   ``More and more over the years, it's the bottom line that
counts,'' said Austin.
   There are primarily two kinds of movie film: negative film, used
in the camera when a movie is shot; and print film, which runs
through a theater screen projector.
   The moviemaking process is identical to taking camera
photographs, involving a negative converted to a print.
   The average movie, at 90 feet of film a minute, is about about
90,000 to 120,000 feet long. However, much more is used en route to
the final product.
   Kodak estimates filmmakers use at least 20 times more negative
film than the finished product requires, which means an average
movie might use 1.8 million feet of film.
   If 1,000 prints are needed, a studio must buy 90 million feet of
print film.
   Kodak sells its most popular negative film in a 400-foot roll
priced at about 34 cents a foot. Its most popular print film comes
in a 4,000-foot roll costing about 6 cents a foot.
   Fuji sells its most versatile negative film for about 31 cents a
foot.
   Increased competition may be one reason Kodak is blowing its horn
about its long history in movies.
   Although the company has won five Oscars, three Emmys and two
special scientific awards for technical breakthroughs in the movie
industry, Kodak still feels a little taken for granted, company
officials said.
   Kodak's role in the movie business is not unlike Texaco's or
Mobil's role in the automobile industry, said Joerge Agin, vice
president and general manager of Kodak's Motion Picture and
Audiovisual Products Division.

   Here are some highlights of Kodak's 100
years in the movie industry:
   1889 _ George Eastman invents flexible roll film. It's 200 feet
long and today would be long enough to make a movie just over two
minutes long. Thomas Edison is his first customer.
   1899 _ Long rolls of film _ 1,000 feet _ are introduced. Long,
dramatic films become practical.
   1929 _ First film is made especially for sound motion pictures.
   1931 _ Kodak wins its first Oscar. The company will receive four
more for technical achievements.
   1946 _ First color print film is introduced. This is the
forerunner of the movies seen in theaters today.
   1948 _ Kodak introduces triacetate safety-base film to replace
nitrate-based film which was flammable, potentially explosive and,
when stored improperly, deteriorated into a powder.
   1974 _ Eastman Color Negative II film 5247, the company's most
versatile movie film, is introduced. It remains the most popular
negative movie film sold in the world.
   1982 _ Kodak introduces a negative film that allows
cinematographers to use less light when filming. The new film cuts
production costs.
   1989 _ Kodak introduces a film said to perform even better in
low-light situations and produce sharper images.

   The government reported its chief economic
forecasting gauge posted a strong 0.6 percent gain in December,
continuing a seesaw pattern that some analysts said portends slower
growth this year.
   The Index of Leading Economic Indicators has reversed course in
each of the last nine months, showing little forward momentum.
December's increase left the index at 194.6 percent of its 1967 base
of 100, up a slim 2 percent from the same month a year earlier, the
government said Wednesday.
   The economy grew a robust 3.8 percent in 1988, but the slowest
quarterly performance in two years was recorded during the
October-December period, when the increase in the gross national
product was held to an annual rate of 2 percent.

   Construction spending, depressed by a downturn
in work on apartment buildings, rose just 1.1 percent last year, the
weakest showing since the recession year of 1982, the government
said.
   The year ended on a strong note, however, as construction
spending rose 2.5 percent in December, the Commerce Department
reported Wednesday.
   Spending for all of 1988 totaled $403.4 billion, a slim increase
from $398.9 billion in the previous year. But after taking into
account inflation, spending actually was down 0.4 percent from 1987.

   The government agency that investigated the
mammoth Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. securities fraud case won't see
a penny of a record $650 million settlement.
   In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission _ considered
chronically understaffed and underfunded _ isn't even allowed to
spend the money it raises through routine stock licensing fees,
which amounted to twice its budget last year.
   To put it in perspective, the government agency assigned to
investigate financial institutions where hundreds of millions of
dollars change handsdaily has a budget of $142.6 million this year.
The U.S. military bands are getting $167.5 million.
   ``It doesn't hamstring you; you just can't get to the work,''
Stanley Sporkin, a U.S. District Court judge in Washington who was
the SEC's enforcement director from 1974-81, said Wednesday of the
agency's budget woes.
   ``I didn't believe we were seeing even 10 percent of the
wrongdoing that was out there and I think that remains the fact
today,'' Sporkin said.
   With the government pledging to increase firepower against
securities fraud in the wake of the Drexel case and a commodities
probe in Chicago, many officials want to see the SEC receive more
funding, possibly by retaining some of its securities-licensing fees.
   ``The problem at the moment is that over the last two to three
years we got involved in some important investigations _ cases like
Dennis Levine, Ivan Boesky, Drexel _ which required the devotion of
our resources,'' current SEC Enforcement Director Gary Lynch said.
``Obviously we're not going to take staff away from ongoing
litigation. But right now we are getting hurt.''
   The three Wall Street fraud cases Lynch mentioned all produced
huge settlements.
   Under Drexel's plea agreement with the SEC made public last
month, the investment giant must pay $300 million in criminal fines
and civil penalties. The remaining $350 million is to be placed in
an escrow account to cover payments to investors who may sue to
recover losses from Drexel's actions.
   Levine, an ex-Drexel managing director, in June 1986 agreed to
repay $11.6 million in illegal gains from insider trading, the use
of nonpublic information to profit in stock transactions.
   Cooperation by Levine led the SEC to Boesky, the now-imprisoned
speculator who in November 1986 agreed to pay $100 million in
insider trading penalties.
   In fiscal 1987, the SEC obtained court orders for defendants to
return about $121 million in illicit profits. More than $70 million
of that came from insider trading cases. Another $62.6 million was
ordered in civil penalties for insider trading.
   No one publicly has suggested allowing the SEC to use the money
it rakes in for government coffers, which would make the agency
something like a meter maid for securities investigations.
   ``It's a real problem because you don't want the agency that is
going to be using the fines to have an incentive to fine people,''
said Sporkin, the federal judge.
   Under longstanding guidelines, the SEC has required violators of
federal securities laws to ``disgorge,'' or return, illicit profits.
   As the number of insider trading cases grew, the SEC pressed for
and Congress enacted the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984,
which empowered the commission to seek court-ordered fines in
addition to disgorgement.
   Some investigators also want the commission to be able to levy
fines for relatively minor infractions, rather than just being able
to suspend guilty brokers. Under current guidelines, only judges in
civil and criminal cases can fine securities-law violators.
   The SEC's $142.6 million budget for fiscal 1989 is up from $135.2
million last year. Revenue from securities-registration fees for the
year is projected at $252 million, but as with penalties, the SEC
can't spend a cent of it.
   That's where change is expected. SEC Chairman David Ruder in
December proposed that the commission adopt some form of
self-funding, such as retaining part of its fees.
   Ruder told a House panel the SEC may have allowed some
investigations _ including enforcement of fraud in ``penny stocks,''
which are traded over-the-counter for a few dollars or less _ to
slip because of underfunding and understaffing.
   ``Given the current inadequacies of the SEC's resources,
(self-funding) makes admirable good sense and I'll be working toward
that end,'' Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the oversight
and investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, said Wednesday.
   A recent SEC report said the annual turnover rate for staff
attorneys is 20 percent and that half of SEC lawyers have less than
three years' experience. The starting salary for commission lawyers
is $27,172.
   Ira Lee Sorkin, a former head of the SEC's New York office, said
bureau staffing there fell to 185 in September 1986 from 225 in
November 1980 _ the same period during which the stock market surged
and insider trading scandals were exposed.
   With more staff, he said, ``You'll have more cases, you'll have
more ability to police the industry. Surely it would help.''

<HEAD>Soy Milk Producer Squeezes Product Into Supermarket Chain's Dairy
Cases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small manufacturer of soybean products
has pulled off a coup of sorts by getting a major supermarket chain,
Waldbaum's Foodmart, to make room in some of its dairy cases for
fresh soy milk.
   The Ambrosia Soy Co. does not expect consumers to immediately
begin gulping down its SweetSoy soy milk, but owner Liz Appel says a
major hurdle has been cleared just by getting the cholesterol-and
lactose-free product a place next to cow's milk.
   ``It's very exciting. I still can't figure out how we did it,''
said Appel, 35, who was a senior consultant for a Big Eight
accounting firm before opening her soybean product business in 1987.
   Waldbaum's, a Holyoke, Mass.-based company, will begin carrying
the product this month on a trial basis at stores in several
Connecticut locations, a spokesman said. Waldbaum's has 43 stores in
Connecticut and Massachusetts.
   ``We try to be first with those items that potentially indicate
new trends. Even if it sold marginally we would possibly expand it
because of its uniqueness,'' said John Lucey, dairy
buyer-merchandiser for Waldbaum's.
   Waldbaum's is believed to be the first major supermarket chain on
the East Coast to carry fresh soy milk in its dairy section,
according to Appel and Peter Goblitz, president of Soyatech, a
market research firm in Maine that follows the soybean industry.
   Goblitz said Ambrosia's accomplishment is significant in two
respects: The company has managed to get a major supermarket chain
to sell fresh soy milk and also to put it in the dairy counter.
   ``For soy milk to reach the mainstream market it is going to have
to entice the people who look in the dairy case regularly,'' Goblitz
said.
   Goblitz said he will be interested in seeing how the
supermarket-shopping public takes to the product and how dairy
companies respond.
   ``By being in there she is taking over someone else's turf,'' he
said.
   Lucey said he expected the product's main appeal will be to those
who drink skim milk or no milk at all.
   ``I think it is a completely different customer. I don't really
think its any threat (to the dairy industry),'' he said.
   Still, the dairy industry is likely to keep a close eye on the
development, Austin Tanner, the former chairman of the Connecticut
Farm Bureau's dairy committee, said Wednesday.
   Most of the soy milk sold in the United States is packaged in
aseptic containers that do not require refrigeration and have long
shelf lives. Health food and Asian-American stores account for
probably 95 percent of all sales, Goblitz said.
   Some people may not like the taste of soy milk at first, Appel
acknowledged Tuesday. She says it has a slightly nutty flavor, but
others say the description is generous, describing it as bland and
watery.
   ``We are definitely going to have to do an educational program,''
said Appel. Her company will provide in-store sampling of soy milk
next month.
   Soy milk may be put on cereal, used in recipes or sipped by the
glassful just like dairy milk, Appel said.
   Sales of soy milk, which is about three times more expensive than
dairy milk, have increased 425 percent in the United States since
1983, or up to 4.6 million gallons last year, according to Goblitz.
   In most of the products, oil is added to create a better flavor
and better ``mouth feel,'' Goblitz said. A sweetener is also usually
added.
   Waldbaum's will be carrying Ambrosia's chocolate and vanilla soy
milk as well as the company's plain product, which is made only of
soybean, soy lecithin and water, Appel said. Ambrosia buys
organically grown soybeans from Iowa.
   In Japan, soy milk is so commonplace it is sold in vending
machines, Appel noted.
   ``We want to be the soy milkman of the East Coast,'' she said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special Chicago Mercantile Exchange panel has
appointed a futures regulation expert to help examine possible
changes in trading practices now under scrutiny in a federal fraud
investigation.
   The nine-member Special Committee to Review Trading Practices
appointed Robert Wilmouth, president of the National Futures
Association, to assist in the review of trading procedure and
policy, Chicago Merc spokesman Andrew Yemma said after the panel
held its first meeting Wednesday.
   The futures association is the industry's self-regulatory
organization.
   The federal government is investigating allegations that as many
as 100 brokers and traders at the Merc and the Chicago Board of
Trade systematically cheated investors out of millions of dollars
through illegal trading practices. The ongoing two-year probe was
disclosed two weeks ago.
   Proposals for changes at the Merc are expected in two to three
months. The proposals would then be submitted to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulates the
industry, for approval, Yemma said.
   Reporters were not allowed into Wednesday's meeting, described by
Yemma as the first in a series planned in Chicago and New York to
discuss trading rules and procedures.
   Meanwhile, the CFTC was to vote in Washington today on
implementation of the Merc's proposed Globex electronic trading
system, a key element in the exchange's move to set up after-hours
global futures trading. Electronic trading also is seen by some as a
way to help police improper activity by more closely monitoring
deals.
   The commission's staff has recommended that Globex be approved,
despite criticism from the BOT that computerized trading opens the
industry to hackers and does not eliminate fraud.
   The House Agriculture Committee on Wednesday designated Rep.
Glenn English, D-Okla., to direct a congressional investigation into
trading practices in the futures and options markets.
   English, chairman of the panel's subcommittee on conservation,
credit and rural development, said the probe would focus on the
CFTC's regulation of the markets and on the self-regulating ability
of the markets themselves.
   In establishing the special panel at the Merc last week, Leo
Melamed, chairman of the exchange's executive committee, said there
would be ``no sacred cows'' in the examination of trading practices
in the market.
   Among the practices that will come under scrutiny is dual
trading, Melamed said, in which traders can buy and sell for
themselves and a customer simultaneously.
   Critics say the longtime practice invites abuse of the
traditional open-outcry style of commodities trading.
   ABS Partners, the most powerful group of brokers in the exchange,
has banned the practice to avoid ``an appearance of conflict of
interest,'' the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.
   There is some support among traders for elimination of dual
trading.
   ``It's a conflict of interest. It's me before the customer, and I
don't think it's right,'' said Gene Sikora, who trades for Henning &amp;
Krajewski Trading Co., a Chicago-based commodities brokerage.
   Officials at the BOT are also examining trading practices.
Chairman Karsten Mahlmann told traders this week the exchange is
considering eliminating dual trading, and is exploring the
feasibility of electronic trading.

<HEAD>Malaysian Group Places Ad To Rebut Charges On Palm Oil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Malaysian trade group has begun an advertising
campaign in the United States aimed at countering what it calls
scare tactics of competitors and health advocates who say palm oil
leads to heart disease.
   The Malaysian Oil Palm Growers' Council today placed a full page
advertisement headlined, ``To the American People _ The Facts About
Palm Oil,'' in the New York Times.
   ``Initial scientific research has provided evidence that palm oil
is healthy and nutritious,'' the ad said in part.
   Malaysia's primary industries minister, Lim Keng Yaik, announced
last week that the palm oil producers in Malaysia had set up a $3.69
million fund for a counterattack.
   ``Since we are the world's biggest producer and exporter of palm
oil we cannot let this go unchallenged. We have to nail the lie,''
Lim said.
   He said the campaign would include advertisements in U.S.
newspapers refuting studies that found highly saturated tropical
oils, like palm and coconut, increase blood cholesterol and lead to
heart disease.
   Groups like the American Soybean Association and the National
Heart Savers Association began an anti-palm oil campaign in 1987,
and major U.S. food processors such as General Mills Inc., Kellogg
Co. and Pillsbury Co. have responded with announcements that they no
longer use tropical oils in their cookies, crackers and other
products.
   A delegation of Malaysian government officials, palm oil
producers, exporters and scientists plans to present evidence from
their own study rebutting the charges to the National Institute of
Palm Oil Processors meeting in Tucson, Ariz., in March.
   Malaysian exports account for 65 percent of total world palm oil
exports. The industry generates about $2 billion in revenue.

<HEAD>EEC Grants Largest Knitwear Quota to Indonesia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community has
agreed to allow Indonesia to export 25.5 million knitted garments to
the EEC this year, the largest quota granted any supplier, a textile
trade group said Thursday.
   Hong Kong, previously the largest supplier of knitted garments to
the 12-nation trading bloc, was given a quota of 25.32 million
pieces, said Chamrul Djafri, an executive of the Indonesian Textile
Association.
   The quota agreement was reached in a three-day meeting that ended
here Wednesday. It was the first time the EEC had set a limit for
Indonesian exports of knitted garments, including men's shirts,
T-shirts and underwear.
   ``Sharp increases over the past few years in its imports of the
products from Indonesia prompted the EEC to impose the quota this
year,'' Djafri said.
   Indonesia's exports of knitted garments to the EEC jumped from
1.2 million pieces in 1984 to 12.1 million in 1987. As of September,
1988 exports had reached 18.8 million pieces.
   The EEC is Indonesia's second largest textile customer after the
United States. It accounted for about 20 percent of the country's
earnings from textile exports, which were estimated at $1.12 billion
for the first 10 months of last year.

<TEXT>
   Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. said Thursday
it has developed a tiny new transistor that can be used to build
smaller, speedier computers and provide clearer pictures on
television sets.
   The new ``quantum wire transistor'' uses wires one-tenth the
thickness of conventional transistors, and can be used to perform
calculations at six times the speed possible with existing high
electron mobility transistors, said an NTT spokesman, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Many transistors go into a computer, and the spokesman said the
small size of the new type would permit the development of laptop
high-speed computers.
   He said the transistor uses wires 5 nanometers thick. One
nanometer equals one-millionth of a millimeter, he added.
   He said the transistor also could be used to develop more
sophisticated amplifiers for receiving broadcast waves from
satellites and other objects in space. This would help provide
clearer pictures on television sets.
   Development of quantum wire transistors is also going on
elsewhere in Japan and in the United States.

   The U.S. dollar turned mixed against major
currencies today in moderate trading. Gold was unchanged in London
after opening higher in Zurich.
   The dollar had retreated in Asian trading because of speculation
about a possible increase by the West German central bank in a key
interest rate.
   ``Most of us aren't expecting it,'' a dealer at a U.S. bank in
Frankfurt said of the rumored rate increase, ``but there are some
people who are sure it will come.''
   In London, one British pound cost $1.75 today, unchanged from
Wednesday's close.
   Other midmorning rates for the dollar compared with Wednesdays
late rates: 1.8680 West German marks, down from 1.8725; 1.5880 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5845; 6.3630 French francs, up from 6.3600; 2.1059
Dutch guilders, down from 2.1080; 1,368.50 Italian lire, up from
1,367.50; and 1.8885 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18945.
   Earlier in Tokyo, where the business day ends before London's
begins, the dollar fell to 129.75 Japanese yen, down 0.65 yen. In
London today, the dollar traded at 129.23 yen.
   Gold bullion prices in London opened at $393 a troy ounce,
unchanged from Wednesday's close. At midmorning, London bullion
dealers fixed a recommended gold price today of $392.70.
   Gold in Zurich was trading at a midmorning price of $392.65, down
from a late bid price of $392.75 a troy ounce Wednesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $395.07 bid, up from $392.30.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.83 bid a troy ounce,
down from $5.85.

   The stock market edged upward today, bidding to
resume its early-1989 rally after a pause on Wednesday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose .36 to 2,338.57 in
the first half hour.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 503 up, 386 down and
561 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.67 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said money managers at investing institutions still
seemed to be doing some catch-up buying to try to participate in the
market's rally.
   When prices began rising more than two months ago, many cautious
managers were caught by surprise holding large amounts of cash
reserves.
   Brokers noted some uneasiness over Friday's impending report from
the Labor Department on the employment situation for January. The
data are expected to show a strong increase in payroll employment,
which might buttress the case for further credit-tightening by the
Federal Reserve.
   However, hopes have spread of late on Wall Street that interest
rates are close to peaking out and may decline later in the year.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Digital Equipment rose { to
120\; International Business Machines gained [ to 128|; General
Electric was unchanged at 48\, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
slipped \ to 31~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.11 to 166.58. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .49 at 323.73.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 4.11 to
2,338.21.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines on the NYSE, with
731 up, 703 down and 525 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 215.64 million shares, against 194.05
million in the previous session.

<TEXT>
   The General Accounting Office today recommended
that the government deal with the savings and loan crisis by
promptly taking control of all failed institutions.
   The GAO, the congressional auditing and investigative agency,
told the Senate Banking Committee that regulators should place any
of the 350 insolvent institutions remaining open into receivership
whenever necessary until a decision can be made to liquidate them or
merge them with stronger partners.
   ``Of fundamental importance, these institutions must be
effectively isolated from the rest of the depository institutions
industry to prevent them from competing with healthy institutions,''
said Charles O. Bowsher, the head of the GAO.
   ``Their operations must be limited to investing in high-grade
securities, managing bad assets on their books and accepting
deposits at prevailing market rates,'' he said. Bowsher said S&amp;L
regulators should enlist help from state officials and from federal
regulators of commercial banks to accomplish this task. He said
Congress must reach agreement as soon as possible on the S&amp;L crisis,
or this process could not get started.
   ``We estimate that to fully pay for (deposit) insurance losses
and to put (the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.) back on a
solid financial footing, it will cost at least $85 billion more than
FSLIC currently anticipates receiving in revenue over the next 10
years,'' he said.
   ``Delay will only increase this cost,'' Bowsher said.
   Delay would also permit weak institutions to ``squander our
nation's wealth on questionable economic endeavors,'' weaken the
entire financial system because healthy institutions must match the
high interest rates paid by weak thrifts, and create pressure on
regulators to lower standards for the entire industry to accommodate
weak S&amp;Ls, he said.
   Bowsher also said that Congress, while providing more money,
should also reform the system and improve its methods of rescuing
failed S&amp;Ls.
   He said the FSLIC should be made independent of its parent
agency, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and that healthy and
unhealthy S&amp;Ls should be put into separate insurance funds so that
tougher rules can fairly be applied to the good S&amp;Ls right away.
   Bowsher, whose agency is studying last year's rescue of 205 S&amp;Ls
at an estimated cost of $31 billion, said, ``We have serious
reservations about the way the bank board proceeded.''
   He said the bank board relies too heavily on methods that
preserve cash and spread the cost of any rescues over 10 years.
   ``It is questionable whether many of these mergers really save
the government money compared to other options that would be
possible if FSLIC had the money to resolve cases,'' he said.

<HEAD>Index Up in December but Economists Still See Slower Growth</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with five grafs to UPDATE with home sales report. Picks
up 2nd graf pvs, The Index ...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of new homes increased 0.6 percent in December, while sales
for the whole year rebounded slightly after plunging during 1987,
the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said 1988 sales totaled 677,000 units, up
0.9 percent from the 671,000 sold during the previous year. Last
year's level was the highest since 750,000 homes were sold in 1986.
   Home sales had plunged 10.5 percent in 1987, with the decrease
blamed on higher mortgage interest rates and a slowdown in demand
after five strong sales years.
   December's increase pushed the seasonally adjusted annual sales
rate to 669,000 for the month, up from 665,000 in November when
sales had been down 7.9 percent.
   On Wednesday, the government reported that its chief economic
forecasting gauge posted a strong 0.6 percent gain in December,
continuing a seesaw pattern that some analysts said portends slower
growth in 1989.
   The Index of Leading Economic Indicators has reversed course in
each of the last nine months, showing little forward momentum.
December's increase left the index at 194.6 percent of its 1967 base
of 100, up a slim 2 percent from the same month a year earlier.
   Economists welcomed Wednesday's report from the Commerce
Department as a precursor to slower, more sustainable growth during
the economic expansion's seventh year, saying restraint would help
keep inflation in check without threatening a serious downturn.
   Wall Street was unimpressed by the report, however, as stocks
turned in a mixed showing. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
slipped 4.11 points to 2,338.21.
   In another report Wednesday, the Commerce Department said
construction spending shot up 2.5 percent in December to end a weak
year on a strong note.
   Construction spending for all of 1988 totaled $403.4 billion, up
just 1.1 percent from 1987. Taking inflation into account, spending
actually was down 0.4 percent. It was the slowest performance since
the recession year of 1982.
   ``The economy is going to be slowing down but there is no
recession on the horizon,'' said economist David Wyss of Data
Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass.
   Wyss predicted that by the middle of next year, growth would slow
enough for the Federal Reserve Board to ease its tight grip on the
money supply. Since March, the central bank has been pushing up
interest rates to dampen inflationary pressure and slow economic
growth.
   Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist for Kleinwort Benson Government
Securities Inc. in Chicago., said the report's saw-toothed
performance ``tells you that there is not a boom building. It
suggests maybe somewhat slower growth in the next couple of quarters
but it most assuredly does not point to any kind of a recession.''
   The economy grew a robust 3.8 percent in 1988, but the slowest
quarterly performance in two years was recorded during the
October-December period, when the increase in the gross national
product was held to an annual rate of 2 percent.
   President Bush plans to adopt his predecessor's forecast that the
economy will grow at a 3.2 percent rate in 1989, but many private
economists are making more pessimistic predictions for the coming
year.

   Agriculture Secretary-designate Clayton Yeutter
said today at his confirmation hearing that U.S. agriculture is
still far too dependent on taxpayers for its livelihood.
   ``That is unhealthy and it is almost unsustainable in the long
run. Secondly, we have a major budgetary crunch on our hands,'' he
told the Senate Agriculture Committee.
   ``This country has a $150 billion budget deficit, which will be
reduced only through a combination of economic growth and spending
discipline,'' and the Agriculture Department budget cannot expect to
escape the problem, he said.
   Yeutter, who served as President Reagan's trade representative,
spoke about his experience in opening worldwide markets to U.S.
products. He noted as recent examples beef, citrus and processed
food exports to Japan, tobacco to several Asian countries, and
almonds to India and Europe.
   ``But it is a whole lot more efficient, less time-consuming and
less confrontational to do this multilaterally'' through trade
negotiations,'' he said. ``That should be a high priority for the
USDA as well as for the U.S. trade representative and it has
implications for the 1990 farm bill.
   ``We simply cannot rationally construct farm legislation for the
'90s until we know the outcome of the Uruguay round'' of trade
talks, he said.
   Yeutter noted that President Bush, during his campaign, said the
1985 farm bill has done what it was expected to do in regard to farm
income supports.
   ``But American agriculture is changing constantly,'' he told the
committee. ``And the institutional regime that is appropriate for
today may well be inappropriate five years from now.
   ``I will ask our USDA professionals for a comprehensive
evaluation of existing programs preparatory to submitting
recommendations for policy adjustments in the future, and we will
obviously also seek the views of our agricultural community.''
   Yeutter also said rural development will occupy a large portion
of his time. Last year's drought, he said, has led many in rural
areas to contemplate their future and in so doing they have realized
that they have become too dependent on agriculture.
   ``They need to diversify their economic base,'' he said, adding
that he would be working toward that goal.
   The Washington Post reported, meanwhile, that Yeutter was guest
of honor at an inaugural-week reception costing thousands of dollars
paid by the tobacco, food and brewing conglomerate Philip Morris Inc.
   Yeutter aggressively promoted American tobacco products overseas
as U.S. trade representative, and agriculture secretary he would be
responsible for policies directly affecting Philip Morris business
interests.
   Yeutter did not check with government ethics officers before
agreeing to the reception, the Post said.
   Executive branch ethics rules say an official cannot accept
anything of value from anyone whose interests could be affected by
the official's public duties.
   Roger Bolton, a spokesman for the trade office, said that when
the idea arose Yeutter was planning to leave the government and the
reception ``was viewed as a thank you for his efforts on behalf of
the tobacco industry at large while he was U.S. trade
representative.''
   Philip Morris spokesman George Knox said the company held the
event for Yeutter because it ``thought it would be nice and
appropriate to celebrate the selection of an eminently qualified
man'' as agriculture secretary.
   Donald E. Campbell, deputy director of the Office of Government
Ethics, told the Post that Yeutter should have checked with the
trade office's ethics officer before agreeing to be feted by the
company.
   Bolton said Yeutter ``considered such approval unnecessary in
light of his imminent departure'' from the trade office.

   Wheat futures prices were slightly higher in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade but corn, soybean and
oat futures slipped on ideas that wintry weather in the Corn Belt
will prove beneficial to farmers.
   ``It's been dry all winter but now we're seeing a switch to more
winterlike conditions with more precipitation in the form of snow,
and that tends to mean this spring will be better for the crops,''
said Walter Spilka, a grain-market analyst in New York with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Showers in northern Brazil, the world's second-largest soybean
producer, also weighed on the soybean market, analysts said.
   But less snow has fallen this week in some U.S. winter-wheat
areas than many experts had expected, and that helped support the
wheat market this morning.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 1\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.32{ a bushel; corn was 1 cent
to 1} cents lower with March at $2.72{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent
lower to { cent higher with March at $2.16{ a bushel; soybeans were
1} cents to 3{ cents lower with March at $7.65{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mostly
higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .35 cent lower to .20 cent higher with February
at 74.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .27 cent
lower with March at 84.50 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to
.53 cent higher with February at 44.15 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .30 cent to .45 cent higher with February at 39.90

   Livestock and meat futures closed mostly higher on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Tenneco's Fourth-Quarter Earnings Rebound From Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tenneco Inc. said Thursday its fourth-quarter
earnings rebounded from a loss a year ago, helped largely by an $867
million gain from the sale of its oil and gas businesses.
   For the three-month period ended Dec. 31, the diversified
industrial company reported its net income totaled $598 million, or
$4.23 a share, compared with a loss of $176 million, or 1.26 a
share, in the fourth quarter of 1987. Revenue was $3.6 billion,
compared with $3.2 billion a year earlier.
   For all of 1988, Tenneco's net income was $822 million, or $5.48
a share, compared with a $218 million, or $1.81-a-share, loss in
1987. Revenue totaled $13.2 billion compared with $11.94 billion in
1987.
   ``During 1988 we made fundamental changes in the focus and
structure of Tenneco,'' said James L. Ketelsen, chairman and chief
executive officer. Tenneco was the nation's 10th-largest oil company
before its 1988 sale.
   Ketelsen said the company used the proceeds of the oil and gas
sale to repurchase more than 20 million shares of common stock for
about $1 billion and reduce the company's debt by about $5 billion.
   ``These changes, combined with substantial divisional and
corporate headquarters restructuring and cost reduction activity
during 1988, have put Tenneco in an excellent position to achieve
significant improvements in operating results in 1989,'' Ketelsen
said.
   The remaining assets of Houston-based Tenneco include oil and gas
pipelines, farm and ranch equipment, automotive parts, shipbuilding,
packaging chemicals and minerals.

<TEXT>
   A non-Indian contractor seeking business
reserved for Indians on the Navajo reservation in Arizona told a
Senate committee today that he provided free airplane rides, an
unrepaid $35,000 loan and other favors to the tribe's chairman.
   John A. Paddock said he originally offered to lend his
construction company's plane and pilot to Peter MacDonald, chairman
of the nation's largest Indian tribe, when MacDonald was seeking
re-election to his post in 1986.
   He said MacDonald used the plane for about 35 trips, including
many after his November 1986 election victory, including two flights
to Las Vegas.
   Paddock's construction company had been declared ineligible for
jobs reserved for Indians on the reservation by Peterson Zah, who
had ousted MacDonald as chairman in 1982.
   Paddock said by supplying MacDonald with the plane he hoped
``that we'd be able to bid on contracts.''
   He told a special panel of the Senate Select Committee on Indian
Affairs that has been investigating corruption in programs designed
for Indians that the flights cost him $12,000 in expenses for pilots
and fuel. The trips would have been worth about $60,000
commercially, he said.
   Paddock also told the committee that in December 1987, MacDonald
asked him for a $35,000 loan. He said he couldn't refuse the request
since as a contractor doing work on the reservation the tribe had
his financial statements and ``I would have had a hard time telling
him I was broke.''
   He said the loan, which was to be for one year, was never repaid.
   Paddock testified that he paid for many of the expenses for the
trips to Las Vegas that he made with MacDonald, their wives and
others.
   He said he also lent a company car to MacDonald's daughter, Hope,
and paid a $400 bill he received for use of the vehicle's telephone.
   He said he also paid $2,500 for a birthday party for MacDonald's
wife, Wanda, and was later reimbursed for half of the expenses of
the party.
   MacDonald has denied he has acted improperly as leader of the
Navajo nation.
   Paddock testified that he set up a company called Native American
Construction and Engineering, headed by a friend, Donald James, who
was a full-blooded Navajo, ``to allow us to bid on the preference
work for Indians.''
   On Wednesday, a former Navy official convicted in the Wedtech
scandal told the Senate investigative panel that a Michigan company
received multimillion-dollar government contracts on the strength of
a shaky claim to native American ownership.
   Richard Ramirez, former head of the Navy's Small and
Disadvantaged Business Utilization Program, said he counseled
companies seeking contracts under the Small Business
Administration's minority set-aside program.
   Ramirez said Kinross Manufacturing Co. of Michigan was an Indian
front company controlled by wealthy businessmen, including some with
connections to Wedtech, the Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor whose
top officials pleaded guilty to bribing government officials to get
contracts.
   Ramirez has pleaded guilty to accepting a bribe in connection
with the Wedtech affair and is cooperating with the government in
cases related to SBA contractors.
   The Senate panel went into closed session Wednesday to hear
Ramirez' testimony, which was then summarized in a statement
released by the committee staff.
   The statement did not identify the businessmen Ramirez said had
connections with both Wedtech and Kinross, and committee staff would
not elaborate.
   Ramirez said Kinross installed a man named Gerry Blanchard as
head of the company to win admittance to the minority program,
claiming he was an Indian even though he was not enrolled in any
Indian tribe until 1982.
   Kinross received minority certification and then won
multimillion-dollar ammunition contracts, Ramirez said.
   Ramirez said he had never seen a start-up company supported by so
many government loans. He claimed that Kinross used influential
political ties to gain SBA approval.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who chairs the special panel,
said this week's hearings into Indian set-asides have found problems
common to the entire SBA minority preference program.
   ``The committee has discovered certain patterns of abuses common
to Kinross, Wedtech and other (minority qualifying) companies,'' he
said.
   Earlier in the day, Kraig Kendall, president of K&amp;T Homes, Inc.,
in Shawnee, Okla. told the panel that the government's policy of
requiring companies to have 51 percent Indian ownership to win
Indian-related contracts is ``an invitation for fraud and fronts.''
   Kendall, who served a prison term after pleading guilty in 1985
to charges related to bribing a Chickasaw tribe governor, said
contracting now ``is in a shambles.''
   He said that to participate in bidding for Indian-related
government contracts, he made an employee's wife who had an Indian
relative in her ancestry a 51 percent owner of his company.
   He also said his practice of giving Indian officials gifts
ranging from dinner hams to automobiles was standard procedure among
those seeking construction contracts on lands of the Absentee
Shawnee and Chickasaw tribes.
   He said he was unable to obtain contracts legitimately and soon
resorted to gifts, gratuities and ``in some cases some serious
bribes.''
   The committee began its hearings into corruption in Indian
affairs Monday and has been concentrating on the ``front''
operations.
   Donald Asbra, chief of the contracting division of the Bureau of
Indian Affairs, testified that the agency does not check
contractors' declarations that they are majority Indian-owned.
   He said it is up to Indians to police themselves and that they
can complain to the BIA if they believe business that is supposed to
go to native Americans is going to non-Indians.
   ``We don't have the capacity to inspect fronts,'' said Asbra.

<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the bottling company
spawned by Coca-Cola Co., reported Thursday that its net income
quadrupled in the fourth quarter of 1988 because of a one-time gain
from the sale of a subsidiary.
   Net income for the quarter was $58.8 million, or 40 cents per
share, up from $14.3 million, or 10 cents per share, in the fourth
quarter of 1987.
   The company said it recorded a one-time gain of $103.8 million
before taxes from the sale of the Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of
Mid-America in the quarter ending Dec. 31. It also had restructuring
charges totaling $27 million as a result of planned relocation and
consolidation of operations.
   Net operating revenues in the quarter rose 14.9 percent to $895.2
million, up from $778.5 million in the final quarter of 1987.
   For the year, Coca-Cola Enterprises said its net income rose 72.6
percent to $152.6 million, or $1.03 per share, from $88.4 million,
or 63 cents a share, a year ago.
   Net operating revenues in 1988 rose 16.2 percent to $3.87 billion
from $3.33 billion in 1987.
   Sales volume in terms of cases rose about 19 percent in 1988 and
17 percent in the fourth quarter.
   Brian G. Dyson, president and chief executive officer, said 1988
was ``a successful year for CCE in light of the competitive
environment,'' and added, ``We believe that our strategic actions in
the last two years have built a strong foundation for long-term
growth in shareholder value.''

   Times were so tough for Monika Bogguess when she
and her husband relocated to Tucson, Ariz., that she got a paper
route and once sold blood to pay the bills.
   Since winning the state's $1.35 million lottery jackpot last
spring Mrs. Bogguess, 38, doesn't worry about making ends meet. Now
she has a new set of financial problems: how to invest a windfall
when you don't know the difference between a stock certificate and a
gift certificate.
   ``I find it all very complicated,'' said Mrs. Bogguess, who has
since quit working as a newspaper carrier. ``Even though I used to
deliver the Wall Street Journal I don't know how to read it.''
   Winning the lottery jackpot can be sweet dream but the
temptations and mysteries of new-found wealth often become
overwhelming.
   Many prize recipients such as Mrs. Bogguess are plunged into the
investment world blind. They're inundated with offers from financial
brokers and a few fall prey to peddlers of bogus investments.
   State lottery officials don't provide financial advice after all
the hoopla dies down, except to sometimes explain tax liabilities
and urge winners to hire a good accountant.
   ``The pressures of winning can be enormous,'' said Michael Naste,
an independent financial planner from Baldwin, N.Y., and a $2.5
million lottery winner himself.
   ``People label you a millionaire and expect you to live a certain
way,'' he said. ``If you're not careful you can overextend yourself
and end up in debt.''
   That's what happened to a construction worker who won $4 million
in the New York lottery three years ago and became one of Naste's
three dozen jackpot-winning clients.
   After receiving a check for around $148,000 _ the first of 20
annual after-tax installments _ the middle-aged man quit his
$38,000-a-year job, threw a party and put $10,000 down on each of 10
new Cadillacs.
   ``The only problem was he didn't realize he also needed money to
live on for the year,'' Naste said.
   In the next eight months, six of the luxury cars were repossessed
and the New York man had to borrow $200,000 to hold him over in
between lottery checks.
   ``A lot of people who play the lottery are not used to having
money, so some of them do crazy things,'' said Naste, 37, who puts
most of his winnings in real estate. ``You've got to remember you're
not really a millionaire when you first win. The money comes in over
20 years.
   ``People say, `If I win the lottery I'll buy a baseball team.'
They've got to be kidding. Banks won't even loan you money based on
(future) lottery winnings.''
   Most big-lottery winners, though, are fairly conservative,
according to interviews with winners, financial advisers and
officials among the 32 state lotteries nationwide.
   Michigan found in a survey two years ago that nearly three
quarters of its $1 million-plus lottery winners had sought expert
financial advice. The majority used their first check to pay bills
or splurge on a new home or car, but later, most made long-term
investments, saved for retirement, or established trust funds, the
survey showed.
   Mrs. Bogguess and her husband, David, 42, are among those whom
accountants might call conservative. While she quit her job, he kept
working as a municipal sewage-management official in Tucson, where
they moved three years ago from Kansas.
   The Bogguess' first $54,000 lottery check _ nearly double their
pre-lottery annual income _ was partly used to pay off some
credit-card debts, the $12,000 family jeep and buy a new pickup
truck. Mrs. Bogguess put the rest in a two-year certificate of
deposit and says she'll commit at least $20,000 a year to
still-undetermined long-term investments.
   ``I'm trying to invest it wisely. I never had that much before
and a couple of times I was down on hard times,'' she said,
recalling the time she sold blood plasma to a local clinic for $30 a
week.
   John D. Flowers, an assistant high school principal from
Barboursville, W.Va., has followed a similar play-it-safe pattern
after winning $2 million in the West Virginia lottery in the spring
of 1986.
   Flowers, 40, who continues working but whose wife quit her job,
said most of his first lottery check went toward buying a new house.
On his accountant's advice, 10 percent was placed in a tax-deferred
retirement annuity and another 10 percent was reserved for his three
children's college education.
   A small amount was invested in mutual funds and short-term
tax-free municipal bonds. Flowers, like some other lottery winners
interviewed, has avoided stocks.
   ``This has raised our overall standard of living and lowered our
overall worry level,'' said Flowers.
   Most prize recipients say their main goal is maintaining a higher
living standard, long after the lottery checks cease.
   Tax expert Jane Feola Scaccetti, who has counseled lottery
winners, says that can easily be done through diversified
investments. But her first advice is that clients take things slow.
   ``It's the same thing as with someone who inherits a lot of
money,'' said Ms. Scaccetti, a tax partner with the Philadelphia
accounting firm Laventhol &amp; Horwath. ``You usually try to slow the
pace down, apply all the sound financial decison proccess ... as you
would a wealthy individual who has earned money over a period of
time.''
   For the first two years most lottery winners might want to keep
the money in high-yielding CDs or Treasury bills, Ms. Scaccetti
said. Some banks, such as Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, offer
special accounts for clients who suddenly have $1 million or more
and need a place to park it.
   Of course, lottery winners also should be looking for ways to
shelter themselves from taxes, such as tax-free municipal bonds or
annuities, Ms. Scaccetti said.
   Later on, ``They need to ask themselves: `Do I need to have a
fixed return because I want to give up working, or do I want to
continue working and put a fixed income amount set aside,'' she said.
   Dick Zimmermann, 39, a former ABC News producer from the San
Francisco Bay area, fell in both categories after winning $9.76
million in the California lottery a year ago.
   Although his annual net income of $500,000 has kept himself and
his wife out of the work force, they've been cautious.
   Zimmermann opted for investments most likely to appreciate, like
a new $425,000, 3-bedroom house and a 1964 Rolls Royce Silver Cloud
III. For tax reasons Zimmermann obtained a 15-year home mortgage
rather than paying cash.
   ``We're trying to be good stewards of this money,'' he said.
``After all, this sort of thing doesn't even come once in a
lifetime. Your chances of being struck by lightning are four times
better.''

   Mild weather and lean inventories helped big retailers ring up
good sales in January and analysts said the gains reported today may
have been larger if the stores had more merchandise to sell.
   However, analysts noted last month's gains by the nation's
largest general retailers occurred during a month that typically is
the least important on the industry's calendar.
   Moreover, several store executives and analysts explained that at
least part of the sales increase came in comparison with a
relatively weak January 1988.
   ``Generally speaking, the sales have come in very good for the
month, better, I think, than anyone would have expected,'' observed
Jeffrey Edelman, of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   But Edelman also said, ``January is such an insignificant month.
January's a cleanup month after Christmas. If you had a couple of
good days, that makes a big difference.''
   Unseasonably warm weather over much of the country in January
probably encouraged shoppers and added to sales volumes. During some
years past, severe winter conditions have kept consumers from
venturing out to stores.
   Monroe Greenstein of the investment firm Bear Stearns said the
tight inventories likely depressed January sales. One leading
department store chain informed him that it had to scramble to
locate merchandise to stock stores during January.
   ``I believe if there was more inventory, sales would have been
better,'' said Greenstein.
   Goods were sharply depleted during December, when business was
even better than retailers had expected. Also, stores didn't have
much left over after Christmas because they already had been holding
inventories down to avoid having to slash prices to move unsold
merchandise later.
   Retailers adopted the strategy after two years of sluggish sales
in which consumers devoted more of their discretionary income to
necessities and services and tried to reduce their high debt levels.
Analysts and economists expect this trend to continue this year.
   Retail sales are closely watched for indications of overall
consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the country's
overall economic activity.
   The figures today indicated the industry had about 6.5 percent
growth in sales last year and analysts predicted a gain of about 5.5
percent to 6 percent for this year.
   The nation's largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck and Co., said its
overall sales rose 11.4 percent in the four weeks ended Jan. 28 to
$2.13 billion from $1.91 billion a year earlier. Full-year sales
went up 7.3 percent to $32.42 billion from $30.21 billion. Sears'
same-store sales _ sales in stores open more than a year _ rose 6.2
percent in January and 3.4 percent for the entire year.
   K mart Corp. said its overall sales last month and rose 6.9
percent to $1.58 billion from $1.48 billion. Full-year sales rose
6.5 percent to $27.3 billion from 1987's $25.63 billion. K mart's
same-store sales increased for the month 2.5 percent and 2.8 percent
for the year.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its overall sales rose 30 percent
during January to $1.49 billion from $1.14 billion. Full-year sales
in the year ended Jan. 31 were up 29 percent to $20.65 billion from
$15.96 billion. The discount retailer's same-store sales rose 13
percent for the month and 12 percent for the year.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said sales rose 2.4 percent to $738 million
in the latest four weeks from $721 million. The entire year's sales
came to $13.97 billion, down 0.1 percent from $13.98 billion.
   The results reported were from the biggest general merchandise
and apparel retailers. Unlike monthly retail sales figures released
by the federal government, they do not include sales at auto
dealers, supermarkets or restaurants.

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange rose
Thursday after the market's already-bullish mood was boosted by the
government's approval of the $5 billion bid for Consolidated Gold
Fields PLC.
   The news that the South African-controlled Minorco SA could
proceed with its offer provoked some active trading in the
traditional speculative stocks.
   Dealers said the bid clearance checked the market's tendency to
drift lower following the spectacular gains in London share prices
since the new year.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 3.7
points, or 0.2 percent, higher at 2,043.4, below the peak of 7.7
points up. The index's low was 7.1 points off.
   Volume totaled 571.2 million shares, down from 703 million shares
Wednesday.

   The stock market headed higher today, bidding to
resume its early-1989 rally after a pause on Wednesday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.61 to 2,344.82 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 730 up, 625 down and
557 unchanged.
   Analysts said money managers at investing institutions still
seemed to be doing some catch-up buying to try to participate in the
market's rally.
   When prices began rising more than two months ago, many cautious
managers were caught by surprise holding large amounts of cash
reserves.
   Brokers noted some uneasiness over Friday's impending report from
the Labor Department on the employment situation for January.
   The data are expected to show a strong increase in payroll
employment, which might buttress the case for further
credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve.
   However, hopes have spread of late on Wall Street that interest
rates are close to peaking out and may decline later in the year.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business

   The U.S. dollar ended mixed in dull European
trading Thursday, with many dealers awaiting the release of U.S.
unemployment data and a meeting of finance ministers from major
industrialized countries.
   Gold prices were lower.
   Dealers said the U.S. currency trading in narrow ranges. It
drifted higher on news that the West German central bank didn't
alter its monetary policy at its council meeting. But it fell back
after failing to break through technical resistance.
   Most dealers said they were moving to the sidelines before the
so-called Group of Seven meeting of industrialized nations late
Thursday. The G-7 countries include the United States, West Germany,
Japan, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
   Currency traders said they also were awaiting the January U.S.
unemployment report to be released Friday.
   In London, the dollar weakened against the British pound. One
British pound cost $1.7515 Thursday, slightly higher for buyers than
Wednesday's late $1.7500.
   Other late rates for the dollar compared with Wednesday's rates:
1.8700 West German marks, down from 1.8725; 1.5923 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5845; 6.3735 French francs, up from 6.3600; 2.1135 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.1080; 1,368.50 Italian lire, up from 1,367.50;
and 1.1882 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1895.
   Earlier in Tokyo, where the business day ends before London's
begins, the dollar fell to 129.75 Japanese yen, down 0.65 yen. In
London the dollar traded at 129.48 yen.
   Gold bullion traded in London at a late rate of $392.25 a troy
ounce, lower than Wednesday's $393.
   Gold in Zurich was trading at a late price of $392.65 an ounce,
down from $392.75 Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $395.07 an ounce, up from
$392.30.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.87 a troy ounce, up
from $5.85 Wednesday.

<HEAD>Minorco's Bid Clears Major Hurdle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hostile $5 billion offer for Consolidated Gold
Fields PLC by South African-controlled Minorco SA cleared a major
roadblock Thursday when the British government gave it a green light.
   The Monopolies and Mergers Commission decided the offer for the
London-based mining and minerals company _ which would be this
country's biggest takeover ever _ wouldn't be against the public
interest, the Department of Trade and Industry said.
   However, the bid faces other legal or regulatory hurdles in
Britain as well as the United States, the European Economic
Community, and other countries.
   Minorco, which is based in Luxembourg and has ties with South
Africa's Oppenheimer family, already holds 29.6 percent of its
target's stock. It has 21 days now to renew the bid, which
automatically lapsed when it was referred to the commission.
   Minorco said it had not yet decided whether to renew its bid, but
Consolidated Gold Fields stock moved up quickly on expectations that
Minorco would sweeten its offer.
   On London's Stock Exchange, Consolidated Gold Fields' shares
jumped 1.17 pounds ($2.05) to 14.20 pounds ($24.80). Minorco's
shares rose 14 pence (25 cents) to 731 pence ($12.79).
   Minorco's September bid was valued at 13.03 pounds ($22.80) a
share in cash and Minorco stock.
   The Oppenheimer family's gold-mining giant Anglo American Corp.
and its sister diamond group De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. own 60
percent of Minorco's shares.
   Consolidated Gold Fields' defense has included statements that
those connections would harm its businesses, because anti-apartheid
supporters might refuse to do business with them. Under white-led
South Africa's system of apartheid, the country's black majority is
disenfranchised.
   The commission said it did not find any likely problem with
Minorco's South African associations.
   In addition, the Office of Fair Trading said Tuesday it was
investigating a complaint by Consolidated Gold Fields alleging
anti-competitive practices by a London-based diamond cartel
controlled by De Beers.

<HEAD>Bush and Takeshita Trade Compliments After White House Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush, stressing a message of
continuity amid change, assured Japanese Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita today that relations are strong and any differences
between the two economic powers ``are the differences of friends.''
   ``We respect one another. We need one another. We will continue
to work together,'' Bush said as he bade farewell to Takeshita, the
first foreign leader to visit the new president in the White House.
   Takeshita responded to Bush's comments with similar warm words,
telling him, ``I look to you, Mr. President, for wise and good
leadership and you will have my full support. ... Hand in hand,
there is nothing we cannot achieve.''
   Following more than two hours of talks that included a working
lunch in the private quarters, Bush and the prime minister emerged
to read statements in their respective languages at the Diplomatic
Entrance.
   Both men pledged to work to alleviate irritants that have marked
the four-decade alliance, particularly in internationl relations,
trade and military cooperation.
   The president said Japan can rely on the United States, which has
borne the major burden of that nation's defense since World War II.
Some members of Congress have called upon Japan, now a world
economic leader, to increase its defense spending.
   ``We will continue to shoulder the obligations that belong to a
global power,'' Bush pledged.
   ``Continuity will also be the mark of relations between the
United States and Japan. On occasion, we may have differences, but
these are the differences of friends,'' the president added.
   Bush also applauded Japan's efforts to increase its aid to Third
World nations. Many in Japan hold such spending to be an alternative
to military spending, particularly in light of their nation's
Constitution, which limits the nation's military to a defensive
posture.
   The president also pledged to work toward bringing the two
nations' economies ``into better balance,'' and said he was
determined to reduce the U.S. budget deficit.
   While many in the United States have criticized Japan for failing
to open markets to U.S. goods, thereby contributing to the more than
$50 billion trade imbalance, the Japanese have repeatedly criticized
the U.S. deficit as a cause of the deficit.
   Takeshita called the military alliance ``firm and sound.''
   The prime minister pledged to continue efforts to restructure his
economy, a means to open the nation to freer trade.
   Assistant Secretary of State Gaston Sigur, the State Department's
specialist on the Far East, said after the session that the meeting
``was not designed to deal with very specific issues'' and that it
was geared toward allowing Bush and Takeshita a chance ``to know
each other better.''
   Sigur noted that while the two leaders did not discuss a
controversial new joint U.S.-Japanese jet fighter project that has
come under attack in Congress, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
told Japan's Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno that the project was under
review by the administration.
   Earlier, Koichi Haraguchi, a Japanese spokesman, told reporters
he hoped the Bush adminstration would support the project.
   The agreement under which General Dynamics of the United States
and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industry would joint forces to build
so-called FSX jet fighters was negotiated late in the Reagan
administration.
   Critics in Congress have labeled the project an $8 billion
giveway of U.S. high technology and have called on Bush to review
the agreement. The Japanese government says it needs a final
go-ahead from the United States on the project by March 31 to get
funds for the project into its current budget.
   Haraguchi told reporters that to ``go backward'' by scrapping the
project would ``be against the interests of both Japan and the
United States.''
   Bush is scheduled to travel to Japan later this month for the
funeral of Emperor Hirohito, but a U.S. official who asked not to be
identified said today's meeting was timely because talks on such
matters as defense, the international economy and Japan's trade
surplus would be difficult amid ceremonies for the late emperor.
   ``It's very important for the two leaders to meet early on to
establish a personal rapport and a broad-brush agenda,'' the
official said.
   One irritant arose recently when Secretary of Defense-designate
John Tower suggested during his confirmation hearings that Japan's
contributions to its own defense are inadequate. Tower criticized
the nation's constitution as a ``lousy idea.''
   The 1946 constitution, adopted during the post-World War II U.S.
occupation, limits Japan to a defensive military posture.
   Tower's comments brought a sharp rebuke from the Japanese, who
pointed to a new budget that calls for a 5.9 percent increase in
military spending.
   The senior administration official pointed out that Japan is
spending $2.5 billion to support U.S. troops stationed there. He
acknowledged that the United States ``would like to see a lot of
these things increased,'' but said the administration was pleased
Japan ``is moving in the right direction.''

<HEAD>Gannett, McGraw-Hill Post Earnings Gains in 4th-Qtr</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gannett Co. Inc. said Thursday its fourth-quarter profit rose
10.3 percent from a year ago, while another media concern,
McGraw-Hill Inc., posted a 10.2 percent earnings gain in the same
period.
   Gannett, the Washington, D.C.-based publisher of 87 daily
newspapers including USA Today, reported an after-tax profit of
$117.8 million, or 73 cents a share, in the three months ended Dec.
31. That compared with earnings of $106.6 million, or 66 cents a
share, in the fourth quarter of 1987.
   Revenue rose 8 percent to $905.3 million in the latest quarter
from $835.4 million in 1987.
   For the full year, Gannett had a profit of $364.5 million, or
$2.26 per share, up 14.4 percent from $319.4 million, or $1.98 a
share, in 1987.
   Full-year revenue rose 7.5 percent to $3.31 billion from $3.08
billion the previous year.
   John J. Curley, Gannett's president and chief executive officer,
the gains came ``despite a difficult economy that affected the
advertising demands of our largest customers.''
   The company said earnings for the quarter and the year were
favorably affected by a change in its effective tax rate. Full-year
results include a non-recurring gain on the sale of Gannett's
investment in Cowles Media in February 1988.
   Newspaper advertising linage increased 1 percent in the fourth
quarter, reflecting continuing growth in classified advertising.
   At USA Today, advertising pages edged up 1 percent to 1,132 in
the latest compared quarter, but slipped 2 percent for the year to
3,979. Because of rate adjustments and a higher rate base,
advertising revenues at USA Today gained 18 percent in the quarter
and 15 percent for the year, the company said.
   In addition to USA Today, Gannett publishes 86 daily newspapers,
35 non-daily newspapers and USA Weekend, a newspaper magazine. It
operates 10 television stations, 16 radio stations, Gannett News
Service and the largest outdoor advertising company in North America.
   McGraw-Hill, which is based in New York, said its profit rose to
$55.0 million, or $1.13 a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31
compared with $49.9 million, or $1.01 a share, a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 1.6 percent to $507.4 million from
$498.7 million a year earlier.
   For the full year, the company earned $185.5 million, or $3.83 a
share, up 12.6 percent from $164.8 million, or $3.27 a share, a year
earlier.
   Full-year revenue rose 3.8 percent to $1.82 billion from $1.75
billion a year ago.
   The 1988 results included gains of $26.5 million before taxes
from asset sales and an after-tax gain of $109.8 million on the sale
of its joint venture publishing company in Japan. The company also
took $107.6 million after taxes in asset writedowns and other
charges in 1988.
   In 1987, the company had a pretax gain of about $20 million from
the settlement of penision obligation.
   In the latest quarter, publishing results benefitted from a
``fine performance from our international book operations, a strong
finish by the broadcasting group, improved results in educational
publishing and the acquisition of the Random House college and
school divisions,'' according to Joseph L. Dionne, chairman and
chief executive.
   He said the full-year results reflected higher revenue and
operating income in publishing, financial services and information
services despite softness in the construction and financial services
markets.
   McGraw-Hill publishes Business Week magazine, operates four
television stations, owns the Standard &amp; Poor's debt ratings group
and publishes material dealing with the construction, health care
and aviation and defense industries.

   Sequoia Grove Winery has been named 1988 American
Winery of the Year by International Wine Review, compiling the top

   The competitions involved 1,240 wines from wineries in 18 states.
   Sequoia Grove, a 10-year-old winery located in Rutherford,
Calif., in the Napa Valley, entered eight wines, mostly Cabernets.
   ``In the past, wineries have won American Winery of the Year on
the strength of all-round performance with several varieties, but
Sequoia Grove's performance in one variety is unparalleled,'' said

   Sequoia Grove scored an average of 94 points out of 100,
outpacing second-place Konocti Winery of Kelseyville, Calif., which
averaged 89 points.
   Other runners-up in the contest included: Trefethen Vineyards,
Napa, Calif., 85; Dry Creek Vineyard, Healdsburg, Calif., 83;
Haywood Winery, Sonoma, Calif., 83; Simi Winery, Healdsburg, 83;
Santa Barbara Winery, Santa Barbara, Calif., 82; Viansa Winery,

   Bridgestone Corp. announced plans
Thursday to build a radial truck tire manufacturing plant in the
state at a cost of $350 million. The Tokyo-based company said the
plant, which will be located in Warren County, Tenn., about 65 miles
southeast of Nashville, should to be in operation by 1991 and
generate about 750 new jobs.
   The daily initial output is expected to be 2,000 tires.
   Bridgestone already operates a radial tire manufacturing plant in
La Vergne, Tenn., just south of Nashville and about 60 miles
northwest of the new site. It employs 1,400 and was purchased from
Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. in 1983.
   Bridgestone produces 3,500 Bridgestone and Firestone brand radial
truck tires and 3,000 Bridgestone brand radial passenger car tires a
day at the La Vergne plant.
   Last July, Bridgestone moved its U.S. headquarters to Nashville
from Torrance, Calif.

Jr. says he's debt-free for the first time in 10 years and may even
run for governor.
   Williams, founder of ClayDesta Communications, recently agreed to
merge the long-distance company with 55,000 customers into
Atlanta-based Advanced Telecommunications Corp. The deal will pay
him $33 million in cash and $10 million in Advanced
Telecommunications stock.
   ``I've battled back like a lot of people in Texas and emerged
with a good financial statement,'' he said in an interview in his
hometown of Midland, center of the depressed Texas energy industry.
``It's not as good as it once was, but it's better than a lot of
people's.''
   The move will erase the remainder of what once totaled almost
half a billion dollars in debt spread among more than 20 companies
owned by Williams, including more than $45 million incurred to start
ClayDesta Communications.
   Williams says that after he closes the merger deal, he will owe
``virtually nothing.''
   It's no accident he's paying off debt while the rest of the state
suffers effects of the economic catastrophe Williams calls ``The
Wreck,'' said the 57-year-old oilman with holdings in real estate,
ranching, banking and farming.
   The dizzying collapse of the Southwest oil and real estate
empires in recent years has produced a list of prominent victims
that reads like a Who's Who of Texas tycoons. It includes former
Gov. John Connally, the Hunt Brothers, industrialist T. Cullen Davis
and Dallas Cowboys owner Bum Bright.
   Williams is unusual because he isn't on the list. Keeping ahead
of the economic tide is one of his specialties. Even his bank,
ClayDesta National, is making money in a state where troubled banks
have become a fact of daily life.
   Although he denied political aspirations a few months ago,
Williams said in January after he returned from a two-week Pakistan
safari that he was considering a run for the governor's office on
the Republican ticket. He has said his annual exotic hunting forays
often provide him inspiration.
   It was on another such trip, this one to the Yukon in 1981, that
Williams decided it was time to get out of the oil and gas business
no matter how much it hurt his pride.
   ``When the time came, I said, `Clay, you're not such a big deal.
You better retrench, consolidate, sell,''' he recalls.
   His formula for walking away largely unharmed by The Wreck: cut
your losses, and if it doesn't work, unload it.
   ``We worked like hell going up and then when The Wreck came, we
worked like hell going down to keep from going broke while
everything fell apart,'' he said.
   In more than 30 years of doing business in Texas, Williams mostly
thought only of growth and expansion. Now, he said, ``my direction
is tied to bottom line, cash flow, efficiency.''
   While paring down helped him survive, Williams struggled to
nurture his long-distance company, started in the aftermath of the
breakup of the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. monopoly.
   ``A lot of things happened to this company that happened to
Texas,'' Williams said. ``We'd sign up people (as customers) and a
year later, they'd be broke. They wouldn't even exist anymore.
Companies that had 1,000 employees would have 100 or 200.''
   Despite hostile economics, ClayDesta Communications grew from
five employees to 370 in one year. It's projecting revenues of $63
million for 1988 _ up from $3 million in revenues in 1984, the year
the company was started.
   Then, Williams said, his oil brought close to $30 a barrel and
natural gas $3 per cubic foot. With today's prices a fraction of
that, money to fund a fast-growing company wasn't available.
   ``We weren't able to grow and realize the potential of our market
and our employees because I wasn't able to put more money and more
money into it on $12 oil,'' he said.
   After studying a merger for the communications company for about
a year, Williams decided Advanced Telecommunications, with more than
150,000 customers and $168 million in revenues, would be a good fit.
   Williams has never been a fan of AT&amp;T and once grabbed headlines
by leading a mounted posse up the steps of the Capitol to protest
the proposed deregulation of the telephone giant.
   Ironically, he found himself in the unfamilar telecommunications
business after problems getting phone service for a tenant spawned
plans for his own phone company. The digital and fiber optic network
he built will continue to form the basis for ClayDesta
Communications under the new company.
   ClayDesta will retain its name, management and employees under
the merger. Williams, featured in the company's Western-themed
commercials, will sit on Advanced Telecommunication's board and
serve as ClayDesta's spokesman.
   With responsibility for the phone company's growth and management
now shared, Williams is looking to bolster other ventures. His
cattle operation in Alpine, southwest Texas, is his most profitable
business, he said.
   Given the depressed real estate market and further cutbacks in
the energy sector, Williams said he plans to be a bargain hunter.
   ``The oil business is still sick, which means there could be
opportunities, because of The Wreck, for a small efficient
operator,'' he said.
   Ever-cheerful, Williams is optimistic about discovering hidden
profit in unfamiliar businesses.
   ``It's like being an old hunting dog looking for birds,'' he
said. ``If you get out there and get to hunting you'll find some
birds, but you've got to get out there first.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices weakened further
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade, extending the previous
session's losses amid disappointment over slack export sales and
weather conditions.
   New snow in the northern Plains and the Corn Belt will add badly
needed moisture to the soil, improving the prospects for a good
growing season, analysts said.
   Meanwhile, rain fell overnight in Brazil and Argentina, the
largest soybean-producing countries in South America, giving crops
there a boost.
   Export sales of U.S. corn, soybean meal and wheat have dwindled
since early January, and some traders are losing faith that prices
will rally in the near term.
   ``We've got the market on hold here a little bit and we're seeing
a little profit-taking,'' said Dale Gustafson, a grain-market
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   At the close, wheat was 5\ cents lower to 1} cents higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.26{ a bushel; corn was }
cent to 3\ cents lower with March at $2.72} a bushel; oats were
unchanged across the board with March at $2.17 a bushel; soybeans
were 1} cents to 10{ cents lower with March at $7.65{ a bushel.

   The stock market showed no clear trend today in a
bouncing session as traders awaited Friday's monthly report on
employment.
   Analysts said money managers at investing institutions still
seemed to be doing some catch-up buying to try to participate in the
market's rally.
   When prices began rising more than two months ago, many cautious
managers were caught by surprise holding large amounts of cash
reserves.
   Brokers noted some uneasiness over Friday's impending report from
the Labor Department on the employment situation for January.
   The data are expected to show a strong increase in payroll
employment, which might buttress the case for further
credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve.
   However, hopes have spread of late on Wall Street that interest
rates are close to peaking out and may decline later in the year.

   Assets of the nation's 454 money market mutual
funds rose by $18.6 million in the latest week to a record $285.37
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a
$737.2 million increase in the funds' assets the previous week, the
Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. It was the fourth
straight week that the assets hit a record level.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 226 general
purpose funds rose $301.9 million to $90.22 billion, assets of 91
broker-dealer funds increased $296.9 million to $120.73 billion, and
assets of 137 institutional funds declined $580.2 million to $74.42
billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.40 percent from 8.38 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 8.36 percent from 8.34 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
unchanged at 32 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts rose to 6.33 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.28 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, rose to 5.14 percent from 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.37
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.33 the
previous week. Yields were 8.63 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.58
percent; 8.70 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.67 percent; and 8.80
percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.79 percent.

<HEAD>Chevron Announces `Potentially Significant' Gas Find in Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chevron USA Inc. has announced a
``potentially significant discovery'' of natural gas in the Gulf of
Mexico about 25 to 30 miles south of this Florida Panhandle resort
community.
   If additional drilling confirms a commerical discovery, it would
be the first in Gulf waters off the Panhandle.
   Oil companies have been drilling exploratory wells in the area
since the early 1970s but never have found profitable amounts of gas
or oil.
   The Chevron well is in a block the company leased jointly with
Conoco Inc., who will take over work at the site, including the
drilling of a second exploratory well, said Chevron spokesman
Johathan Lifa.
   The new well is to be drilled this summer or early fall.
   ``We can't tell from this first well by itself if we have the
kind of reserves we need to support a commercial operation,'' Conoco
spokesman Michael O'Connor said Wednesday. ``But I think it's fair
to say this is encouraging. We simply have to see what the potential
is.''
   Lifa said it may be five years or more before a decision is made
whether to produce gas from the field.
   If so, it could be an economic boost for the Panhandle in the
form of onshore support and supply facilities, said Mike Zeigler of
the West Florida Regional Planning Council.
   Most onshore support operations for exploratory drilling in the
region have been based in Panama City, he said.
   Core samples from Chevron's exploratory well and seismic tests
indicated the presence of gas in a formation called Norphlet
sandstone, Lifa said.
   Large gas fields in lower Mobile Bay in Alabama, about 50 miles
west of the new find, are in the same kind of formation.
   The Chevron well is in 180 feet of water and was drilled to a
depth of 22,572 feet.
   Last April, the Interior Department described the Chevron well
and an Amoco well south of Fort Walton Beach as being capable of
producing paying quantities. But at that time the companies said
they were still studying the drilling results.
   Conoco and Chevron were among major buyers when the government
offered new leases at nearby sites in the Gulf last November.

   Crude futures prices rallied after sliding most
of the day Thursday, fueled by a report that an OPEC country would
cut production if necessary to stabilize prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, closed 22
cents higher at $17.73 a barrel after falling to $17.38 earlier in
the session. The contract had risen 48 cents on Wednesday to $17.51
a barrel.
   Other contract months were mixed.
   According to market observers, the report published in an
Arabic-language newspaper said Dubai, the largest producing emirate
within the United Arab Emirates, was willing to cut its output 10
percent after March 1 if market conditions warrant.
   ``It was psychological,'' said Jayne Ball, commodity oil broker
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``Ten percent only amounts to 40,000
barrels a day. The main thing is Dubai had said (previously) it
would not cut back at all.''
   World oil prices had risen rapidly since November, surprising
many analysts, but in recent days began easing slightly mainly on
technical factors.
   Investors interpreted Thursday's news as another sign that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is trying to stabilize
prices, analysts said.
   The United Arab Emirates is one of the OPEC countries believed to
be exceeding a new production quota established by the 13-member
cartel to reduce output and stabilize world oil prices. The quota of
18.5 million barrels a day took effect Jan. 1 but various estimates
since then put OPEC's actual production at between 19.5 million and
20 million barrels.
   Some reports have suggested the UAE is exceeding its quota by
some 400,000 barrels a day.
   Traders said prices also got some support from Venezuelan
President Carlos Andres Perez who during his inauguration on
Thursday called for more cooperation by OPEC and non-OPEC countries.
   Among refined oil products, the March contract for unleaded
gasoline lost 0.1 cent to close at 49.62 cents a gallon, while the
March contract for heating oil rose 0.11 cent to 50.55 cents a
gallon.

<HEAD>Amanda Takes Universal Foods Takeover Bid To Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SOLOMON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Universal Foods Corp. executives testified
Thursday that they had not thoroughly examined a pair of
half-billion-dollar takeover bids by High Voltage Engineering Corp.
before rejecting them two months ago.
   Universal Chairman John L. Murray and President Guy A. Osborn
were the first two witnesses called in a U.S. District Court hearing
over a lawsuit filed by Amanda Acquisition Corp., a subsidiary
formed by High Voltage Engineering of Burlington, Mass.
   Amanda is challenging Universal's poison pill defense and
Wisconsin's anti-takeover law, which have blocked its takeover bid
that began in December.
   Osborn testified that Universal's management and the board of
directors did not feel an analysis on the adequacy of Amanda's two
bids submitted in December was necessary before the board voted on
the matters.
   ``Based on the bright future prospects of the company, we
determined it was inadequate,'' Osborn said.
   Amanda on Dec. 1 offered $30.50 a share for Universal, which
valued the company at $508 million on the basis of Universal's 16.7
million shares. It raised its bid two weeks later to $35 a share, or
$585 million. Amanda already owns 614,500 shares.
   Both offers have been rejected by Universal's board, and
management has threatened to enforce its poison pill if Amanda
continues to press its bid.
   S&amp;W Berisford PLC, a British food conglomerate, is the major
backer of Amanda's bid. According to court documents, it is
providing $195 million.
   Chase Manhattan Bank and investor bankers Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
would provide the rest of the estimated $643 million Amanda says it
would need to close the deal, including investment banking fees.
   Under questioning from Amanda attorney Greg Joseph, Osborn and
Murray both confirmed that the company's directors, before they
voted on Amanda's offer, did not seek:
   _An analysis of what would be a fair offer for the company.
   _A determination of what the future value of the company would be.
   _Opinions from its investment bankers on the adequacy of the
Amanda bid.
   _Any meetings to elicit more information on the history, plans
and financing of Amanda.
   ``Frankly the company is on a roll and this simply is not the
time to be selling the company. You only get to sell the company
once,'' Murray said.
   In his opening arguments, Amanda lawyer William Levitt said he
hoped to show that Universal's management recklessly pursued a
``just-say-no'' approach to purchase offers and had rejected
Amanda's ``offers even before they had received any information.''
   Amanda announced Thursday it extended the expiration date of its
$35 cash tender offer for Universal's common stock through Feb. 13.
It also said it had no immediate plans to acquire any shares as a
result of the offer, pending a decision in the court suit.

   Chrysler Corp. on Thursday posted a 23.8 percent
fourth-quarter earnings increase, although annual profits declined,
and announced an estimated $500 million deal with France's Renault
to build a four-wheel drive vehicle code-named ``JJ.''
   The venture with Renault was the second the nation's No. 3
automaker disclosed with a foreign company during the past week.
Chrysler earlier this week announced it would market autos made in
Canada by South Korea's Hyundai Motor Corp., beginning in 1991.
   ``You look at it and it's a `wow' car,'' Chrysler Chairman Lee A.
Iacocca said of the JJ at a New York news conference.
   Iacocca said joint production of the JJ, which was called a
``mini-sport utility vehicle,'' was scheduled to begin in July 1992
at an existing U.S. plant and one in either Portugal or Spain. The
Jeep-like vehicle would cost under $10,000, he said.
   The venture will mark Chrysler's return to European production
after more than a decade. Chrysler will handle North American sales
while Renault will be responsible for France, Italy, Portugal and
Spain.
   Iacocca said the 50-50 venture France's state-owned automaker
aims to sell 100,000 vehicles in the United States and 50,000 in
Europe. He said the companies' contribution to the deal would total
about $500 million.
   Chrysler closed at $28.50, down 37{ cents, in New York Stock
Exchange trading Thursday.
   Chrysler reported a profit of $433.6 million, or $1.85 a share,
in the three months ended Dec. 31. That compared with earnings of
$350.2 million, or $1.57 a share, in fourth quarter 1987.
   Revenue totaled $9.69 billion, up 13.6 percent from $8.53 billion
in the corresponding 1987 quarter.
   For the full year, Chrysler had a profit of $1.05 billion, or
$4.66 cents a share, down 18.6 percent from $1.29 billion, or $5.90
a share in 1987. Annual revenue rose to $35.5 billion from $29.3
billion the previous year.
   The 1988 results were reduced by $93.1 million due to a $150
million charge for previously announced plant closings in Chrysler's
Acustar parts subsidiary.
   Iacocca said annual results also were affected by the company's
strategy to increase market share by reducing some auto prices and
offering sales incentives.
   Chrysler's share of the U.S. car and truck market rose to 14
percent from 12.3 percent in 1987. The share for cars increased to
11.3 percent from 10.8 percent, while the share for trucks was 19.4
percent, up from 18.3 percent in 1987.
   Iacocca also said hourly and salaried workers would receive
profit-sharing payments averaging about $720 in March. The payments
would be the company's first under a profit-sharing agreement signed
last year with the United Auto Workers.
   General Motors Corp. late last year announced profit-sharing of
about $200 per employee. Officials at No. 2 Ford Motor Co. are
expected to announce profit-sharing well over $1,000 per worker.
   Chrysler said it sold 2.21 million vehicles _ the first time it
sold a million cars and a million trucks in the same year _ compared
with 1.92 million in 1987.
   Chrysler Financial Corp., the automaker's financing arm, reported
a fourth- quarter profit of $74 million, up from $60 million a year
earlier. For the full year, Chrysler Financial had a profit of $259
million, up from $226 million in 1987.
   Automakers and analysts have predicted 1988 would be the
industry's best earnings year ever, with the Big Three posting
combined profits of $11 billion. The previous record was the
combined $9.8 billion profit in 1984.
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are expected to release
their year-end earning figures in mid-February.
   Iacocca also renewed his argument for the U.S. Treasury
Department should impose a 25 percent tariff on all imported trucks,
including minivans and sport-utility vehicles. Some foreign
automakers slightly modify vehicles to classify them as cars, such
as the popular minivans, and thereby have to pay only a 2.5 percent
tariff.
   Iacocca, GM Chairman Roger B. Smith and Ford Chairman Donald
Peterson have called on the Treasury to slap the truck tariff on
light-utility vehicles.
   ``If it looks like a truck and walks like a truck and acts like a
truck, then it's a truck,'' Iacocca said.

   The move comes two days after Copeland's latest court victory. On
Tuesday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reconsider
an earlier decision allowing Copeland to go ahead with the bid.
   Another court decision over the takeover is pending in a San
Antonio federal court.
   The Feb. 19 date is significant because Church's has said it
anticipates finishing an auction of the company by then.
   A. Copeland Enterprises Inc., Popeyes' corporate parent, said
Thursday it now has been offered about 7.7 million shares of
Church's or about 25 percent of the outstanding shares.
   That's down from almost 45 percent. Company spokesman Mark
McKinnon said the drop could be attributed to several reasons
including the decision by Church's to put the company up for auction
and the fact that an extension of the deadline was expected.
   ``We still expect those tenders to come forward,'' he said.

<HEAD>Orange Juice Futures Flatten As Freeze Fears Fade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Orange juice futures prices turned decisively lower Thursday,
erasing nearly two-thirds of the past week's gains, as fears of
frost damage to the Florida orange groves melted away.
   On other markets, precious metals futures resumed their slide
after a 1-day interruption; grains and soybeans moved lower; energy
futures and livestock futures were mixed.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice settled 3.6 cents to 4.4 cents
lower on the New York Cotton Exchange with the contract for delivery
in March at $1.385 a pound.
   The March contract had gained 7.4 cents _ boosting the contract's
value by $1,110 _ during the four previous sessions on concerns that
an arctic cold front howling down from Alaska would spread freezing
temperatures all the way to Tampa.
   But now that the big chill has reached the nation's heartland,
meteorologists are predicting that its impact on Florida's climate
will be less than severe.
   ``The reality is that the (Florida) weather is only supposed to
drop into the mid-40s and that is absolutely nowhere near
freezing,'' said Judith Ganes, a market analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   Another reality is that 45 percent of the 1988-89 Florida orange
crop has already been picked, leaving only a portion of the fruit
vulnerable even if temperatures did fall below 32 degrees, she said.
   Further selling was linked to the dollar's gains against other
currencies, effectively raising prices to European dealers for
Brazilian orange juice, which is quoted in U.S. dollars. The higher
prices could squeeze demand.
   The dollar's strength also contributed to moderate declines in
gold and silver futures prices, which tend to move in tandem with
foreign currency values.
   Some analysts noted a reluctance among traders to buy gold
futures ahead of Friday's meeting in Washington of the finance
ministers of the seven major industrialized Western nations.
   The precious metals staged a modest rally on Wednesday after four
days of sharp losses but Thursday's sell-off offset nearly all of
gold's gains and about one-third of silver's.
   Gold settled $1.10 to $1.40 lower with February at $392.30 a troy
ounce; silver was 1.2 cents lower across the board with March at
$5.863 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures prices continued to slump on the
Chicago Board of Trade, extending the previous session's losses amid
disappointment over slack export sales and precipitation in growing
areas.
   New snow in the northern Plains and the Corn Belt will add
badly-needed moisture to the soil, improving the prospects for a
good growing season.
   Meanwhile, rain fell overnight in Brazil and Argentina, the
largest soybean-producing countries in South America, giving crops
there a boost.
   Wheat settled 4{ cents lower to 1} cents higher with March at
$4.27\ a bushel; corn was { cent to 3\ cents lower with March at
$2.73 a bushel; oats were unchanged to \ cent lower with March at
$2.16} a bushel; soybeans were 3\ cents to 10 cents lower with March
at $7.64\ a bushel.
   Crude-oil futures prices advanced modestly while refined products
ended narrowly mixed in choppy trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Crude prices surged at midday on reports that Dubai had cut its
production of crude oil by 10 percent.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 22 cents
higher with March at $17.73 a barrel; heating oil was .11 cent to
.25 cent higher with March at 50.55 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was unchanged to .25 cent lower with March at 49.62 cents a
gallon.
   Signs of sluggish demand pressured most cattle and pork futures
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle settled .28 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
February at 75.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .10
cent lower with March at 84.67 cents a pound; live hogs were .17
cent to .70 cent lower with February at 43.40 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .48 cent lower to .25 cent higher with February at
39.70 cents a pound.

   The dollar finished mixed against major foreign
currencies Thursday in listless trading, as the market awaited
developments from a meeting of finance ministers from major
industrialized countries and the publication of new U.S. job figures.
   Gold prices slipped. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid price for gold of $391.10 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down
from $391.50 late Tuesday.
   The U.S. currency traded in narrow ranges through most of the
day, dealers said. It fell in early trading in the Far East, then
edged higher in Europe on news that the West German central bank
didn't alter its monetary policy at its council meeting. But the
dollar later fell back after failing to break through key technical
points, traders said.
   Many market participants retreated to the sidelines before the
so-called Group of Seven meeting of industrialized nations that
began late Thursday in Washington. The G-7 countries are the United
States, West Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
   Currency traders also are awaiting the U.S. unemployment report
for January to be released Friday.
   ``There's a fair amount of uncertainty,'' said Peter Borish, a
currency analyst at Tudor Investment Co. ``The best way to trade
when you don't know what's going on is to stay on the sidelines.''
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins, the
dollar fell to 129.75 Japanese yen, down 0.65 yen. Later, in London,
the dollar traded at 129.48 yen. By the end of trading in New York,
the dollar had declined to 129.57 yen from 130.33 yen late Wednesday.
   In London, the dollar weakened against the British pound. One
pound cost $1.7515 Thursday, slightly higher for buyers than late
Wednesday's $1.7500. In late New York trading, the pound was quoted
at $1.7450, down slightly from $1.7470 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8775 West German marks, up from
1.8753; 1.5945 Swiss francs, down from 1.5960; 6.3880 French francs,
up from 6.3845; 1,371.25 Italian lire, up from 1,370.50; and 1.1893
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1900.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.8700 West German marks, down from 1.8725; 1.5923
Swiss francs, up from 1.5845; 6.3735 French francs, up from 6.3600;
2.1135 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1080; 1,368.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,367.50; and 1.1882 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1895.
   Gold traded in London at a late rate of $392.25 a troy ounce,
lower than Wednesday's $393.
   Gold in Zurich, Switzerland, was trading at a late price of
$392.65 an ounce, down from $392.75 Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $395.07 an ounce, up from
$392.30.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
closed at $392.30 an ounce, down from $393.70 late Wednesday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.87 a troy ounce, up
from $5.85 Wednesday. On New York's Comex, silver for current
delivery closed at $5.823 an ounce, down from $5.835 late Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Burger King Corp., which operates the nation's
second largest fast-food chain and is searching for ways to boost
its sales under a new owner, filled two senior management posts on
Thursday.
   Burger King Chief Executive Officer Barry J. Gibbons described
the appointments as ``a major first step in the development of a new
core management team.''
   Robert J. Stetson was named chief financial officer, and Nigel
Travis will serve as senior vice president, human resources.
   Stetson, 38, was most recently executive vice president,
commercial and chief financial officer of Pearle Health Services Inc.
   That company is a subsidiary of Burger King's new parent company,
the British conglomerate Grand Metropolitan PLC. Grand Met acquired
the parent company, Pillsbury Co., in January.
   Travis, 39, had been on special assignment to Burger King. Before
joining Burger King, Travis had been group management development
director at Grand Met's London headquarters.
   Both men will report to Gibbons, who is working on a new
marketing strategy for the fast food chain. He will be directly
responsible for marketing, the company said in a release.
   Burger King is a distant second to McDonald's Corp. in the U.S.,
fast food business. Its sales growth has stalled in recent years as
it has undergone several changes in management and experimented with
several advertising approaches.

<HEAD>Money Supply Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Jan. 23, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,072.6 billion in the week, from $3,070.4 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,914.9 billion from $3,914.2 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $785.8 billion from a revised $783.6 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed last year set a provisional target for 1989 of 3 percent
to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent growth in
M3. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is scheduled to announce new targets
in late February. The Fed has not set a target range for M1 since
early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,062 billion, a 3.7
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $3,899.6 billion, up 4.6 percent, while M1 rose
1.4 percent to an average of $785.7 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $848 million,
compared with a decline of $127 million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $263 million in the week ended Wednesday, down from $453
million in the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves totaled $450 million,
up from $283 million two weeks earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $289.5 billion in the week ended Wednesday, down from $290.2
billion one week earlier.

   Nintendo has filed another suit in its long
dispute with American companies over the $2.3 billion annual video
game market.
   Nintendo of America on Thursday filed legal action in U.S.
District Court against Atari Games Inc., alleging patent
infringement. Also named was Tengen Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Atari.
   On Tuesday, Atari Corp. of Sunnyvale filed a $250 million lawsuit
in U.S. District Court in San Jose against Nintendo Company Ltd.,
accusing the Japanese video giant of monopolizing the market with
restrictions on its licensed game developers.
   In December, Atari Games of Milpitas, which is not related to
Atari Corp., filed a $100 million suit against Nintendo, accusing
the company of unfair competition.
   Early last month, Nintendo sued Atari Games, charging the company
with making and selling unauthorized video-game cartridges.
   In Thursday's action, Nintendo contended that the manufacture and
sale by Atari Games and Tengen of home video cartridges for play on
the Nintendo Entertainment System infringes on a U.S. patent issued
to Nintendo in 1989.
   ``The patent covers a novel system designed to prevent the use of
unauthorized computer software on hardware systems,'' Nintendo said
in a statement.
   The action was filed as an amended complaint to the January suit,
according to the statement.

<TEXT>
   A majority of U.S. corporate controllers
believe leveraged buyouts have a negative impact on the economy, in
a sharp turnaround from a similar survey two years ago, the National
Association of Accountants said Thursday.
   Of about 1,000 members of the trade group responding to a survey
taken in the first week of January, 84 percent said leveraged
buyouts do not contribute positively to the economy. That contrasted
with February 1987 survey where only 47 percent of the respondents
criticized the buyouts.
   ``The change seems to reflect disapproval of two or three recent
large buyouts,'' said Earnest A. Huband, president of the
Montvale-based accountant's association.
   In a leveraged buyout, a purchaser uses the assets of a target
company to finance debts used to acquire the company. The tactic has
become increasingly popular in recent years, as reflected by last
year's record $24.5 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. by the firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   Critics contend the huge amounts of debt loaded on to the target
companies make them especially vulnerable to failure during an
economic downturn.
   Of those responding to the survey, 60 percent indicated they
would like to see greater federal regulation of leveraged buyouts.
That compared with 58 percent who were against greater federal
regulation of LBOs in a survey conducted last May.
   Of those supporting greater regulation, 45 percent said the best
way would be to eliminate the tax deduction for interest on
leveraged buyout financing and 40 percent indicated the Securities
and Exchange Commission should to take action. Only 15 percent
indicated the Justice Department should become involved.

accountants and financial managers.

   Federal authorities said Thursday that they
seized millions of dollars in counterfeit designer clothing and
perfume in Brooklyn and Queens and arrested three men who allegedly
were selling the merchandise to retail stores.
   The men were charged in a federal complaint with making
counterfeit Giorgio, Obsession and Poison perfume at a factory in
Queens and counterfeit designer clothing at a building in Brooklyn,
said Gary Hillberry, the U.S. Customs agent who heads the New York
office.
   At the Brooklyn location, agents seized $2 million worth of
clothing carrying phony labels from Ralph Lauren, Guess Jeans,
Jordache Jeans, Lacoste, Sergio-Valente and others, Hillberry said.
   They found 50 liters of perfume oil, bottles, spray pumps and
cardboard packages at the Queens factory, he said. Also seized were
a capping machine and silk screens used for labeling the bottles.
   ``This counterfeit ring was selling the counterfeit fragrances to
retail stores throughout the country,'' Hillberry said. ``These were
then sold to the public as genuine'' goods.
   The defendants were identified as John Miesner, 45, of Queens;
Franklin Franco Gomez, 44, of Queens; and Robert Dunn, 41, of
Brooklyn. They were charged with trafficking in counterfeit goods
and face up to five years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

<HEAD>Standards Body Rejects Appeal on New TV Standard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deciding a dispute that has split the biggest
networks and TV makers, a standard-setting body Thursday rejected an
appeal over the standard for producing high-definition television
and movies.
   The standards decision removes lingering doubts about what kinds
of cameras, tape recorders and other equipment will be used to
produce the coming generation of sharp, bright TV pictures.
   The market for high-definition television, including production
equipment and receivers, is expected to reach tens of billions of
dollars a year by early in the coming century.
   The appeals board of the non-profit American National Standards
Institute, which has final say, on Thursday voted to turn down an
appeal led by Capital Cities-ABC Inc., which said the decision on a
standard was made without adequate consensus of interested parties.
   The board's action means that the new standard is the one
proposed by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers.
   The standard prescribes 1,125 horizontal lines per screen, more
than twice as many as the 525 lines per screen on today's
televisions, permitting far superior pictures. However, if the
transmission standard is not as sophisticated as the production
standard, some of the extra clarity will be lost. A decision on a
broadcast standard, which involves the public airwaves, will be made
eventually by the Federal Communications Commission.
   The standard matches the Japanese one in having 1,125 lines per
screen. But it calls for 60 frames per second, compared to 59.94
frames per second in the Japanese standard.
   The now-official standard ratifies what exists in most of the
high-definition television production equipment that is already in
use. But to opponents, it threatens to shut off inventiveness while
the industry is still young.
   ``We're disappointed in the outcome,'' ABC spokesman Bob Mackin
said.
   Mackin said the ABC-led group hoped that the Society of Motion
Picture and Television Engineers would consider accepting additional
production standards as they are developed.
   Adoption of any additional standards would depend on the review
of a committee of the engineers' society, Peter Gartland, the
organization's chief counsel, said in an interview. ``SMPTE does not
have a policy against coming up with additional standards,'' he said.
   Supporting the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers
were such companies as CBS Inc., HBO Inc., the Motion Picture
Association of America, Matsushita Electric Industrial Ltd.'s
Panasonic Co., and a major group of broadcast industry unions, the
Department of Professional Employees, AFL-CIO.
   On the other side, Capital-Cities ABC was supported by General
Electric Co.'s NBC, Fox Inc., North American Philips, Zenith
Electronics Corp., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the David
Sarnoff Research Center and Faroudja Laboratories.

<TEXT>
   The Sydney Futures Exchange will become a full
partner in Globex, an electronic trading system for futures and
options being developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and
Reuters Holdings PLC, officials said Thursday.
   The announcement came the same day that the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulates futures
trading, gave the Merc and London-based Reuters permission to launch
the automated trading system.
   ``Now that the CFTC has endorsed Globex and Sydney has become the
first offshore exchange to agree to join us as a partner, we are
truly on the way to our goal of an international system offering the
widest possible product line for the world's financial risk
management needs,'' Leo Melamed, chairman of the Merc's executive
committee, said in a statement.
   The computerized system is expected to become operational this
fall, initially offering only certain financial futures products
traded at the Chicago Merc.
   It will function during the hours that its member exchanges are
closed, offering their products for electronic trading only when
they cannot be traded in the traditional fashion by traders standing
in recessed arenas called pits.
   The New York Mercantile Exchange, the leading market for crude
oil and platinum futures, agreed Jan. 5 to join Globex. The Chicago
Merc is pursuing similar agreements with other futures exchanges.
   A future is a binding contract to buy or sell a designated amount
of a commodity at a specified price by a given date. An option is
the right to buy or sell a commodity for a specified price at some
time in the future.
   Futures and options players use the markets to either lock in
prices for the physical commodities they buy and sell, or to gamble
on price movements.
   The Sydney Futures Exchange lists a variety of financial futures
products, including the All Ordinaries stock-index futures contract,
a 90-day Australian bank bill futures contract and the Australian
10-year Treasury bond.

   The Travelers Corp. said Thursday its fourth-quarter earnings
rose sixfold from a year ago, while another insurance concern, Chubb
Corp., posted a 38 percent rise in earnings despite costs associated
with its drought coverage.
   Travelers, based in Hartford, Conn., reported earnings of $278
million, or $2.74 a share, in the fourth quarter compared with $43
million, or 37 cents a share, a year ago.
   The latest results included realized investment gains of $41
million and $107 million from the sale of businesses in the latest
quarter. The 1987 results included realized investment losses of $55
million.
   Income from operations in the quarter rose to $237 million from
$98 million in 1987.
   For the year, the company's net income slumped to $103 million,
or 92 cents a share, from $374 million, or $3.56 a share, a year
earlier.
   The latest results included $33 million from sale of assets and
realized investment losses of $327 million. The 1987 results
inlcuded realized investment losses of $55 million.
   Income from operations edged up 0.2 percent to $430 million in
1988 from $429 million a year earlier.
   ``The continued strong results in our property-casualty
commercial lines operations contributed significantly to total
earnings,'' said Edward H. Budd, chairman and chief executive
officer.
   The company's property-casualty commercial lines had operating
earnings of $337 million in 1988, up from the $336 million in 1987.
   Chubb, which is based in New York, posted fourth-quarter earnings
of $83.9 million, or $2 a share, compared with $51.3 million, or
$1.23 a share, in the same 1987 period.
   The latest results reflect a loss of $16.5 million that was part
of a rain insurance settlement with Midwest farmers.
   Gail Devlin, senior vice president of Chubb, said one reason for
the jump in earnings was that the company reduced its loss in
investments to $9.5 million in the latest quarter from $36.7 million
in 1987.
   For the full year, Chubb said its profit increased 9.1 percent to
$359.6 million, or $8.55 a share, from $330.1 million, or $7.95 a
share, in 1987.
   Ms. Devlin said profits were boosted by a 27.8 percent increase
to $81 million in after-tax investment income.
   For all of 1988, the company's rain insurance program lost $36.3
million after taxes, or 84 cents per share.
   In December, Chubb agreed to a $48 million settlement with
lawyers representing farmers in 10 states whose rain insurance
applications were rejected last summer.
   The farmers involved were in Illinois, Iowa, Ohio, Kentucky,
Indiana, Tennessee, Minnesota, Michigan, Missouri and Wisconsin.

   Two leaders of the House Banking Committee on
Thursday blamed federal S&amp;L regulators for the failure of private
auditors to uncover problems in institutions that later failed.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, the chairman of the panel, and
Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., a subcommittee chairman, also
complained about an ``institutionalized revolving door'' where major
accounting firms assign employees to the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board as ``fellows.'' The accountants on loan provide advice to the
bank board before returning to their firms, the legislators said.
   The statement by the two accompanied a long-awaited report from
the General Accounting Office that turned up six instances in which
independent accounting firms ``did not adequately audit''
institutions that later failed.
   The GAO, Congress' auditing and investigative agency, said it had
found ``auditing and reporting problems ... significant enough (in
six cases) to warrant our referring the CPA firms performing the
audits to regulatory and professional bodies for their review.''
   It named five firms: J.K. Byrne &amp; Co., subsequently acquired by
Touche Ross & Co.; Deloitte Haskins & Sells; Ernst & Whinney;
Greenstein, Logan &amp; Co., and Arthur Young &amp; Co.
   Aruthur Young audited two institutions that later became two of
the biggest insolvencies in Texas, requiring billions of dollars
from the federal S&amp;L insurance fund: Vernon Savings and Loan
Association and Western Savings Association. Gonzalez and Annunzio
said Arthur Young received nearly $1 million in fees from the two
S&amp;Ls.
   The two said they were ``appalled that the ... bank board ... did
not step in years earlier to demand reform of auditing procedures
and performance.'' They said they would conduct hearings on the
matter.
   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the bank board, said last week that
his agency is vigorously pursuing accounting firms that may have
contributed to failures.
   Bank board spokesman William Fulwider said the agency has civil
suits against 11 firms, including three of the so-called ``Big
Eight,'' and ``other investigations are underway and could lead to
additional suits.''
   Of the six institutions cited by the GAO, ``we have or had all
under investigation,'' he said. He said the bank board has had a
long-standing policy of pursuing accountants, lawyers and other
professionals that may have contributed to a failure, but said it
takes months and sometimes years to build a successful case.
   Ernst &amp; Whinney released a statement saying, ``We find it
incredible that our name has been mentioned in the context of
contributing to S&amp;L industry problems. ... The GAO did not assert
any deficiencies in our audit procedures, but merely disagreed with
how our report disclosed one matter.''

   The board of Fairchild Industries, Inc., on
Thursday rejected a sweetened $230 million takeover offer from
Carlyle Group, a Washington-based investment partnership.
   Fairchild said in a statement its board had rejected Carlyle's
$16.30-per-share offer as inadequate and not in the best interest of
the aerospace company's stockholders.
   The firm also said Thursday it had completed the purchase of $75
million in Fairchild stock held by a group led by George Soros and
Harvey L. Karp, two directors who resigned from the Fairchild board
and agreed to refrain from certain, unspecified activities involving
the company.
   Fairchild also said it had completed the sale of 1.6 million
shares of common stock to its employee stock ownership plan at
$16.05 per share. Employee benefit plans now hold 21 percent of the
company's outstanding stock, constituting about 19 percent of the
voting power.
   Sales of stock to employee ownership plans is often used as a
defensive move against takeover bids.
   Carlyle owns nearly 10 percent of Fairchild's stock.
   The partnership raised its bid to $16.30 to match the price paid
the Soros group for its stock. An earlier $15.50-per-share bid was
also rejected by the Fairchild board.
   Fairchild stock closed at $14.50, down 12{ cents a share in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading Thursday.

   Richard Lowrance has resigned from the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange's 24-member board of governors for personal
reasons, the exchange said Thursday.
   The resignation was not related to the continuing federal
investigation of suspected trading fraud at the Chicago Merc and the
Chicago Board of Trade, said Merc spokesman Andrew Yemma.
   Other board members said Lowrance's resignation letter stated
that he could no longer commit the time required for board business.
   Lowrance, a prominent order-filler in the Merc's high-volume
Eurodollar futures pit, was elected last year to a term that will
expire in 1990.
   Yemma said David Wescott, an unsuccessful board candidate in an
election held last month, was appointed to serve the remainder of
Lowrance's term.

<HEAD>Rogaine Sales Boost Upjohn Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rising foreign sales of the anti-baldness
drug Rogaine helped boost Upjohn Co. earnings 14 percent in the
fourth quarter, the pharmaceutical company said Thursday.
   Upjohn reported earnings of $80.7 million, or 43 cents a share,
for the three months ended Dec. 31, up from $70 million, or 38 cents
a share, in the fourth quarter of 1987.
   Sales for the quarter totaled $710.5 million, up from $649.7
million in the year-earlier period, the company said.
   For the year, Upjohn reported earnings of $353.4 million, or
$1.90 a share, up 16 percent from $305 million, or $1.63 a share, in
1987.
   Full-year sales totaled $2.75 billion, up from $2.52 billion the
previous year.
   The company said its overall U.S. sales increased 5 percent for
the year while foreign sales jumped 15 percent and comprised 40
percent of total sales.
   Growth in foreign sales of Rogaine, marketed in Canada as
Regaine, topped all sales gains, although Upjohn does not divulge
figures for individual products, spokesman R.D. LaRue said.
   Also undisclosed were early sales results for Rogaine in the
United States, where it was introduced in October.
Direct-to-consumer advertising was begun in late November.
   Upjohn said 1988 sales of its human health care products and
services were up 8 percent from the previous year.
   The company reported a 13 percent increase in sales of
agricultural products, including animal medications and Asgrow
agricultural seed.

   The Illinois Supreme Court cleared the
way Thursday for criminal prosecution of five factory officials
whose employees contend they were injured by a ``toxic cocktail''
and other unsafe working conditions.
   Without dissent, the state's highest court ruled that the federal
Occupational Safety and Health Act does not bar criminal prosecution
for unsafe working conditions.
   A Cook County grand jury indicted the five officials of Chicago
Magnet Wire Co. in 1984 on charges of aggravated battery, reckless
conduct and conspiracy. However, a circuit judge dismissed the
indictments a year later, ruling they were pre-empted by federal law.
   The indictment charged that 42 workers suffered nerve and lung
disorders, scars from metals and other problems as a result of their
working conditions.
   Prosecutors said the factory lacked safety equipment, proper
cooling and ventilation and that workers were exposed to what a
doctor who examined them called a ``toxic cocktail'' of hazardous
chemicals. They said accounts of conditions at the suburban Chicago
factory, where wire was coated with polyvinyl chloride and other
chemicals, ``resemble a historical narrative about conditions in the
`sweat shops' of the mid-19th century.''
   The case drew the attention of business groups from across the
nation, as well as county prosecutors from Boston, New York and Los
Angeles who sought to try similar cases in their areas.
   ``The Supreme Court's ruling, which sets a precedent, is of
national importance,'' said Cook County State's Attorney Richard M.
Daley, whose office investigated the case. ``It will help safegaurd
the workers of Illinois from deliberate harm at the hands of a very
few unscrupulous employers who put profits above the safety of their
workers.''
   Business leaders warned that Thursday's decision could lead to a
patchwork of safety standards varying among counties and states,
with executives facing criminal sanctions if their factories failed
to pass muster.
   ``What can an employer do to forsee all of these circumstances,
with the possibility that he may be hauled before the grand jury and
indicted?'' said Arthur Gottschalk, president of the Illinois
Manufacturers Association.
   But Daley said only ``a very few unscrupulous employers'' would
have anything to worry about.
   ``The evidence we uncovered showed that the defendants knew of
the dangers, did nothing to protect their employees, and in fact,
concealed the danger to the workforce,'' he said at a news
conference.
   ``This alleged conduct went beyond the issues regulated by OSHA
and can only be addressed properly in the criminal courts,'' Daley
said.
   Thursday's ruling also set a possible precedent for another
Illinois case in which three executives of Film Recovery Systems
Inc., a suburban Chicago company, were convicted of murder and
sentenced to prison in the death of a factory worker who was exposed
to cyanide on the job.
   That case, currently on appeal, was the first in U.S. history in
which corporate executives were convicted of murder in a
safety-related workplace death.
   In their opinion Thursday, the Illinois justices noted that the
U.S. Supreme Court decided a similar pre-emption question in
upholding a punitive damage award to the estate of Karen Silkwood,
the Kerr-McGee Corp. worker whose death brought national attention
to safety concerns in the nuclear industry.
   ``It is totally unreasonable to conclude that Congress intended
that OSHA's penalties would be the only sanctions available for
wrongful conduct which threatens or results in serious physical
injury or death to workers,'' Justice Daniel P. Ward wrote for the
court.
   Harvey Silets, a attorney for one of the defendants, has
predicted that the case ultimately will go to the U.S. Supreme
Court. He and other defense lawyers did not return telephone calls
seeking comment on Thursday's decision.

   A federal judge began hearing testimony
Thursday on a request by Pennwalt Corp. to block a stockholders
meeting Centaur Partners has demanded in its $765 million hostile
bid for Pennwalt.
   Centaur, which owns about 13 percent of Pennwalt's stock, hopes
to use the meeting to replace the chemical company's board with
directors sympathetic to its offer.
   In issuing the demand Tuesday, Centaur delivered proxies that it
said represented owners of approximately 34.6 percent of Pennwalt's
outstanding shares.
   State law requires a company to hold any meeting requested by
stockholders with at least 20 percent of the firm's shares.
   Centaur, whose principals are New York financiers Abbey J. Butler
and Melvyn J. Estrin, launched the $100-a-share bid in mid-December.
Pennwalt's stock closed unchanged Thursday at $105.62{ on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Pennwalt claims Centaur included inadequate disclosure in the
tender offer, would be short at least $57 million to finance the
merger and failed to reveal that Butler filed for personal
bankruptcy six years ago and was accused of fraud in 1979.
   Attorney Matthew Broderick, representing Pennwalt, alleged in a
legal brief that Pennwalt would suffer irreparable harm without a
temporary injunction to stop the meeting.
   ``The court should recognize that the public interest is not
served by permitting a takeover developed through misleading public
statements to come to fruition,'' the brief said.
   Bruce Kauffman, the lawyer for Centaur, and attorney Stuart
Savett, speaking for a group of stockholders, disagreed and insisted
the only issue was whether a stockholders meeting should be held.
   ``We are not concerned with whether this is a good offer, a fair
offer or a bad offer, but whether there has been full disclosure,''
Kaufman told U.S. District Judge Robert Gawthrop. ``It is up to the
shareholders to decide about the offer.''
   Savett also said the stockholders should be allowed to meet
quickly and make the decision.
   In his brief, Kauffman said, ``Centaur has disclosed all material
information with respect to the financing of the offer as required
under the federal securities laws.''
   Broderick called Butler as a hostile witness and brought out that
he had filed for personal bankruptcy in 1983, reporting debts of
more than $1 million and assets of about $3,500.
   A court document also disclosed that in 1979 in California,
Butler and others were accused of fraudulent stock transfers
totaling nearly $400,000.
   Butler said there was never any adjudication of the charges.
   In a related development, Pennwalt dropped a lawsuit against
PaineWebber Inc., which has agreed to provide $400 million in
short-term financing for the takeover.
   The lawsuit contended the tender offer violated federal
securities laws by containing misleading statements.

   C. Everett Bacon, a Wall Street
investment banker for nearly half a century who was best-known as a
pioneer of the forward pass during his collegiate football career at
Wesleyan University, has died following a brief illness. He was 98.
   Bacon, who was inducted into the National Football Foundation
Hall of Fame in 1966, died Wednesday.
   As a senior at Wesleyan in 1913, Bacon was considered the premier
quarterback in the East and perhaps the most accomplished at the
forward pass, an innovation first used in the 1906 Wesleyan-Yale
game, according to some accounts.
   Bacon, who lived in East Hampton, retired as senior partner of
the investment banking firm of Spencer Trask &amp; Co., in 1968, 45
years after becoming a partner.
   Bacon served as a trustee at Wesleyan from 1923 through 1960,
when he was elected trustee emeritus, and served five years as
chairman of the Wesleyan Annual Fund. He was also an officer or
director of numerous business and financial organizations.
   Born Clarence Everett Bacon on Aug. 18, 1890, in Westbrook,
Conn., Bacon entered Wesleyan in 1909.
   Bacon had no immediate survivors.

   A freighter arrived at the port of
Inchon on Friday with coal from North Korea, the first direct
merchandise shipment from north to south since the Korean War.
   The shipment comes just one day after South Korea's giant Hyundai
conglomerate said it signed an agreement to build a tourist resort,
shipyard and railroad plant in North Korea.
   The South Korean government said Friday that it ``in principle
takes a favorable view of the proposed projects, regarding them as
possible pilot projects that could contribute to efforts to achieve
national unification.''
   The Conch, a Panamanian-registered freighter, took 20,900 tons of
anthracite coal to the western port of Inchon.
   Previous imports from the north have come came through third
countries.
   The North Korean coal was imported by Hyosung Corp., a South
Korean trading firm, at $52.50 per ton or a total of $1.09 million.
   On Thursday, South Korean tycoon Chung Ju-yung, Hyundai's
honorary chairman, confirmed after returning from a 10-day trip to
North Korea that he had agreed in principle with the north to
undertake the resort and other projects along its east coast.
   He was the first South Korean business leader known to have
visited the north with the approval of both governments since Korea
was split in 1945. The Koreas fought the Korean War from 1950 to
1953 and have never signed a peace treaty.
   Under the agreement signed in the north's capital, Pyongyang,
Hyundai and a North Korean state-run corporation will jointly
develop a resort around scenic Mount Kumgang to attract South
Koreans and foreigners, Chung said.
   The Mount Kumgang area is about 20 miles from the demilitarized
zone that divides the Koreas.
   Chung told a airport news conference that the two sides also
agreed to jointly develop resources in Siberia and to jointly
operate a railroad rolling stock plant and a shipyard, both at
Wonsan in the north. He had already discussed the Siberian projects
with Soviet officials in Moscow.
   The agreement was signed by Chung and Choe Su Gil, director of
North Korea's Taesong Bank and consultant to the Korean Association
of the Promotion of Asian Trade. Because both are state agencies,
the Pyongyang government's approval of the projects was seen as
guaranteed.
   Chung said the projects are subject to approval form both
governments, but one Seoul official said the south would approve the
undertakings as a pilot project to stimulate inter-Korean
cooperation.
   Seoul has been seeking direct trade and other exchanges to ease
tension between the two Koreas with an eventual goal of
reunification. Both Koreas recently have made contacts to arrange
high-level government and parliamentary talks to pave the way for
peace.
