<HEAD>15 Vincennes Sailors Disciplined for Drug Use</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy announced Friday that 15 crew members
of the USS Vincennes, the cruiser that shot down an Iranian
jetliner in the Persian Gulf last summer, will be disciplined for
drug abuse.
   ``There is no connection now to the July 3 incident in the
Persian Gulf to what has happened on board the Vincennes,'' said
Navy Cmdr. David Dillon, spokesman for Pacific Fleet Surface Force
headquarters.
   The Vincennes, meanwhile, will be shifted to Long Beach Naval
Shipyard within five weeks for modifications to correct
deficiencies in the Aegis electronic combat control system, The
(San Diego) Tribune reported Friday.
   Aegis, which would enable a ship like the Vincennes to make
computer-recommended battle decisions for entire fleets, was found
flawed in the Persian Gulf confrontation.
   According to Pentagon analysts, split-second decisions were
affected by the inability of radar-scope interpreters to
immediately match the plane's ``blip'' with digital direction,
altitude and speed information displayed on another screen.
   Those problems are one reason the Vincennes will undergo
modernization, an unidentified source told The Tribune.
   None of the sailors involved in the drug sweep were in positions
that may have influenced the decision by Capt. Will C. Rogers III
to fire two anti-aircraft missiles at the jetliner, Dillon said.
All 290 aboard the plane died.
   Of the 15 sailors, six are being processed for discharge from
the Navy, while six others have been given warnings, Dillon said.
   ``Three are petty officers who are being investigated for
possible court-martial in connection with drug sales,'' he said.
   Dillon noted that the 15 sailors represent 3.9 percent of the
384 sailors on board. ``That is less than the 5.4 percent average
for the entire Navy,'' he said.
   The announcement came as preparations were under way at the
Naval Station San Diego for Saturday's change of command aboard the
Vincennes.
   Rogers will be rotated to a new assignment at the Navy's
Tactical Training Group in San Diego. The new Vincennes commander
is Capt. Robert B. Lynch, who had been stationed in Washington,
D.C., and is assuming his fifth sea command.
   Rogers and his wife, Sharon, have been under guard by the Naval
Investigative Service since a pipe bomb exploded under the family
van Mrs. Rogers was driving to her teaching job March 10 in La
Jolla. She escaped injury.
   The FBI is investigating the attack as possible terrorist
retaliation for the airliner's destruction.

   House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho plans to
announce his resignation from Congress on Saturday, Democratic
sources said Friday, throwing the party's House leadership into
even more turmoil with the expected resignation next week of
Speaker Jim Wright.
   Wright, his career in shambles as a result of ethics charges,
disappeared for a long holiday weekend _ after first handing out
roses from his garden to television reporters camped outside his
door.
   Hours later, sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity
said Coelho, the Californian who was third-ranking Democrat in the
party's House leadership, also plans to quit because some of his
business dealings are under scrutiny.
   Popular Majority Leader Thomas Foley of Washington is likely to
be elevated to speaker without a hint of discord, but Coelho had
expected to be a contender for Foley's current job in what was
expected to be a nasty battle.
   But Coelho told the New York Times he plans to resign his
leadership position as soon as a successor is picked and will quit
the House on June 15, his 47th birthday.
   ``I don't intend to put this institution through more turmoil.
And more importantly, I don't intend to put my family through more
turmoil,'' the Times quoted him as saying.
   ``If I can't be leader and if I can't be whip, it's time to try
a new and different challenge. Therefore, June 15, which is my 47th
birthday, will be my last day in the Congress,'' Coelho told the
Times.
   Coelho's decision will be announced Saturday at the Capitol,
said one source, who explained. ``he doesn't want his attention or
abilities distracted in this fashion.''
   Coelho ``has been told by his attorneys that he has no legal
difficulties. But he just thinks enough is enough,'' the source
said. ``He does not want to put his party through it.''
   Coelho was facing questions about a California bank executive's
purchase of a high-yield junk bond for Coelho in 1986, when Coelho
found himself unable to finance the transaction.
   The bond was sold to Coelho by the executive a month later at
the initial offering price, saving Coelho about $4,000 compared to
the bond's market price at the time. The Los Angeles Times reported
this week that the Justice Department was opening a criminal
investigation of whether Coelho received favored treatment from
Drexel Burnham. Coelho said the story was wrong.
   Coelho was expected to face other contenders for the majority
leader's spot, including Ed Jenkins of Georgia.
   Likely candidates for the whip position, the post now held by
Coelho, include Democratic Caucus Chairman William Gray of
Pennsylvania, Chief Deputy Whip David Bonior of Michigan and
perhaps Richard Gephardt of Missouri _ though Gephardt let it be
known he won't try for the No. 2 majority leader's position against
Coelho, who helped in his unsuccessful presidential campaign.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who made an impression
as chairman of the House Iran-Contra Committee, might also jump
into the majority leader's race. Spokeswoman Sarah Binder said he
has been urged by colleagues to run but has made no decision.
   Coelho faced a difficult fight to move up to the no. 2 spot as
Democrats were leery of perpetuating the image problems they have
had to deal with as Wright has fought ethics committee charges of
financial impropriety.
   One lawmaker, a Gephardt ally, said, ``there are a good many of
us'' trying to persuade Coelho to step aside, thus freeing Gephardt
to run.
   Common Cause, the private group that joined in the complaint
that brought the ethics commission investigation of Wright, said
Friday it was asking the panel to open a formal inquiry of Coelho.
   A source close to Jenkins said the Georgia Democrat ``will be a
candidate for the position when the speaker resigns.'' And Jenkins
apparently will have support from the powerful chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee, Dan Rostenkowsk of Illinois.
   The sources, aware of the sensitive nature of the situation with
Wright still in his job, commented only on condition they not be
named.
   While the succession struggle swirled about him, Wright went on
a weekend getaway with his wife, Betty, to an undisclosed location,
his aides said.
   Wright awoke Friday morning to find television crews encamped in
his front yard. He came outside, cut a bouquet of roses from his
garden, and handed them to a network news producer, but declined to
answer questions.
   ``I'll have a statement to make at some time, and when I do,
I'll welcome you,'' he said.
   Earlier this week, Wright's lawyers and representatives of the
ethics panel talked over a possible arrangement under which Wright
would give up his position _ which makes him the nation's highest
elected Democrat _ in exchange for the dropping of at least one of
the major charges against him.
   In particular, he is said to be interested in wiping out an
allegation that his wife Betty was given a no-work job by Wright's
friend and business partner, George Mallick. House rules prohibit
gifts from people with a diret interest in legislation, a
description the committee says applies to Mallick.
   Foley, meanwhile, told a news conference in Spokane, Wash. that
``there is no vacancy'' for the speaker's job and ``I have no
knowledge on his part of plans to resign.''
   Foley said Wright had not asked him to schedule time for Wright
to address the House to defend himself against House ethics
committee charges he committed 69 rules violations.

<HEAD>Police: 6th Graders Steal $10,100 In Bank Field Trip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JAY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two sixth-graders have been charged with
helping themselves to more than $10,000 in cash during a class tour
of a bank vault.
   Jay Elementary School Principal Elton Nowling said he dropped
about 30 students off at NCNB National Bank Thursday morning and
returned to pick them up about an hour later.
   Hours later, the bank manager called to report $10,100 was
missing.
   Nowling said he called Santa Rosa County sheriff's Deputy Scott
Whatley, a resource officer at Jay High School, to ask students
about the reported theft.
   Whatley and another deputy questioned the students who went on
the field trip one at a time.
   Nowling said the boys didn't try to hide the theft but
apparently didn't say why they helped themselves to the cash. The
two allegedly stuffed their clothes with $100 bills.
   Deputies recovered all of the missing money. Sheriff's Capt.
Terry Hardy said the boys were picked up by the Florida Department
of Health and Rehabilitative Services. They were charged with grand
theft and taken to the Youth Detention Center in Pensacola.
   Nowling said the two, who had recently transferred to his
school, aren't representative of its students.
   ``Our kids are good kids, basically. We normally don't have
problems,'' he said.
   Later, Nowling gathered all the sixth-graders for a lecture on
``finance.''
   ``I think (the incident) may have seemed kind of funny to start
out with, but when I got there it ceased being funny,'' he said.
   The principal said he had not had a chance to apologize to the
bank manager, ``but I don't think this will affect our ability to
tour the bank as in years past.''
   Nowling said the boys have been suspended from school for the
remainder of the year. Bank officials refused to discuss the
incident Friday.

<HEAD>Time-Warner Merger Now Needs Only Shareholder Approval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shareholders meetings next month are the last
big hurdle to the $18 billion merger of Time Inc. and Warner
Communications Inc. following action by the Federal Communications
Commission.
   The FCC on Friday granted a temporary waiver of its
cross-ownership restrictions, which was the final regulatory
approval needed in the creation of the world's largest
entertainment and media conglomerate.
   The commission had to review the transaction because a Time
subsidiary _ American Television and Communications Corp. _
operates cable television systems in the Los Angeles and Austin,
Texas, areas, which overlap with the viewership of television
stations owned by Chris-Craft Industries Inc., a company that
controls a 15.5 percent block of Warner stock and would hold about
12 percent of the combined conglomerate.
   The FCC's waiver gave the companies 18 months to comply with
federal cross-ownership rules that generally prohibit one company
from owning multiple media outlets in one area.
   There are at least four ways the companies can comply: American
Television could sell the affected cable systems; Chris-Craft could
sell its TV subsidiary; or it could reduce its stake in the
combined Time-Warner to below 5 percent; or Time-Warner could apply
and receive a permanent waiver from the FCC.
   ``We perceive no public interest benefit in removing cable
service to the many communities involved in this matter until a
buyer or buyers can be found,'' the commission wrote in its
opinion. ``The alternative would be to hold up a major transaction
of which the cable systems constitute but a very small part.''
   The chairmen of both companies, J. Richard Munro of Time and
Steven J. Ross of Warner, said in a joint statement: ``We are
delighted to have successfully completed the federal review process
necessary for our merger. ... We are confident that the nation's
policy makers will not be disappointed in the pro-competitive,
pro-American and pro-consumer impact of the merger.''
   Seven weeks ago, the Justice Department ruled that the merger
would not violate antitrust laws. On Monday, the Securities and
Exchange Commission approved proxy materials for separate Time and
Warner shareholders meetings scheduled June 23 in New York. A
majority of shareholders of record on May 1 must approve the
merger, which was announced on March 3.
   The transaction also must be approved by several local cable
franchising authorities. Time owns systems with about 4 million
subscribers while Warner has about 1.5 million cable subscribers.
   The proposed conglomerate, Time-Warner Inc., would surpass
Rupert Murdoch's Australia News Corp. as the world's biggest media
and entertainment concern.
   Time publishes Time, People and Sports Illustrated magazines and
owns Time-Life Books and the Book-of-the-Month Club. Warner
operates the Warner Bros. movie and television studios as well as
Warner Recording.
   American Television owns cable systems or has a stake in cable
systems serving Canyon Country, Orange, San Marino, South Pasadena,
Gardena and Torrance, Calif., and Austin, Texas. A wholly owned
Chris-Craft subsidiary, BHC Inc., owns KMOL-TV in San Antonio,
Texas, and KCOP-TV in Los Angeles.

<HEAD>McCarthy Target Who Helped Shift Public Opinion Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frederick G. Fisher, who as a young lawyer
became a target of Joseph R. McCarthy but whose boss' spirited
defense of him helped turn the tables on the senator, has died of a
heart attack. He was 68.
   Fisher died Thursday while attending a lecture sponsored by the
Israeli bar in Tel Aviv. He was a senior partner in the Boston firm
of Hale &amp; Dorr, which he joined shortly after his graduation from
Harvard Law School. He recently had moved to Sagamore Beach, Mass.,
from West Newton, Mass.
   Fisher played an inadvertant part in the dramatic 1954
Army-McCarthy hearings that grew out of a dispute between the
senator and Army officials, whom McCarthy had accused of ``coddling
Fifth Amendment communists.''
   McCarthy, a Wisconsin Republican, accused a number of public
officials, military officers and prominent private citizens in the
early 1950s of having Communist affiliations.
   A special counsel for the Army at the hearings before McCarthy's
investigations subcommittee was Joseph N. Welch, a partner in Hale
&amp; Dorr, in which Fisher was then an associate.
   McCarthy accused Fisher of having been a member of the National
Lawyers Guild ``long after it had been exposed as the legal arm of
the Communist Party.''
   Welch, near tears, responded: ``Until this moment, Senator, I
think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness. Fred
Fisher is starting what looks to be a brilliant career with us. I
fear he shall always bear a scar, needlessly inflicted by you.''
   ``Have you no decency, sir?'' he said to McCarthy.
   The exchange on national television was considered a pivotal
point in turning public opinion against the senator, who
subsequently was censured by his colleagues.
   Fisher later became a partner at the firm in 1958 and organized
its commercial law department.
   He also served as president of the Massachusetts Bar Association
and as chairman of many committees of the American and Boston bar
associations.
   He is survived by his wife, Talia; two sons, Frederick 3d, of
Shropshire, England, and Hamilton, of Natick, Mass; a daughter,
Genevieve, of Cambridge, Mass.; two brothers, Clark, of Haywood,
Va., and Champe of West Newton and four grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   Britain has been hit by a series of strikes in
recent months recalling the pre-Thatcher days of national walkouts
that helped bring down a Labor Party government.
   But experts say the scenario is very different from the ``Winter
of Discontent'' of 1978-79 when public service workers paralyzed
much of the country. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative Party ousted the socialists in May 1979 on a wave of
anti-union sentiment.
   Experts predict the strikes will eventually subside after a
current round of wage negotiations. Although there are concerns the
walkouts could lead to higher wages and prices, their impact will
be limited by Mrs. Thatcher's union-curbing laws, they say.
   Repeated one-day walkouts by subway workers and bus drivers have
forced millions of Londoners to walk to work. The British
Broadcasting Corp. has canceled or cut live television and radio
programs because of brief strikes by employees for higher pay.
   Dockworkers are voting on whether to strike at Britain's 40
ports over the government's plans to abolish a job-guarantee plan.
Engineers and university and National Health Service workers are
also restive.
   ``When times were very hard in the 1980s, we took a back seat,''
said Jim Mowat, an official with the Transport and General Workers
Union, Britain's largest union.
   ``We negotiated wage decreases. Now Mrs. Thatcher is telling us
that Britain's economy is booming so we think ... we should be
partial beneficiaries of that boom.''
   The strikes have been spurred by high wage demands stemming from
resurging inflation and interest rates.
   Changes in work practices sought by new managers to control
costs and raise efficiency are also a factor, said John Kelly, a
lecturer at the London School of Economics.
   However, Gavyn Davies, an economist with Goldman Sachs
International in London, said the economic effect of the renewed
industrial strife ``is much less because the economy has moved to
be more service-oriented, more small firm-oriented and more female
labor, and in each of those areas there is less incidence of union
membership.''
   Rod Thomas, an official with the employers' Confederation of
British Industry said: ``Our view is that it is a short-lived
period of industrial disputes.... There is no widespead fear of an
upswing in union militancy.''
   Workers are demanding raises as high as 15 percent, pointing to
the rising inflation, which largely is blamed on a credit-fueled
consumer spending boom. April's 8 percent annual inflation rate was
more than double the 3.9 percent rate a year earlier.
   The government has tried to curb inflation by raising interest
rates 10 times in the past year _ from 7.5 percent to 14 percent.
But the subsequent higher mortgage rates have boosted pay requests.
   Employees of the soon-to-be-privatized electricity industry
recently won a 9.2 percent pay raise, higher than the inflation
rate. The settlement averted a walkout.
   It has been difficult for companies to reject wage demands as
their profits have soared _ they were up 12 percent in 1988 and are
expected to be healthy this year.
   In addition, many employers have difficulty recruiting labor.
Britain's national unemployment rate has nearly halved to 6.5
percent. And lower birth rates of the 1970s are going to translate
into fewer workers in the 1990s.
   ``Unions are in quite a strong bargaining position,'' Kelly said.
   However, Mrs. Thatcher has curbed union power with laws banning
sympathy strikes and mass picketing and forcing secret ballots on
whether to strike.
   Union membership has declined to 8.8 million from a peak of 12.2
million in 1979. Last year, 3.02 million work days were lost to
strikes, compared with 30 million in 1979.

   An engine room fire forced an attack submarine
to surface off the Southern California coast, and the
diesel-powered sub was towed to San Diego on Friday, Navy officials
said.
   None of the 73 crew members aboard the USS Blueback were injured
in the Thursday afternoon fire, the second accident in two days
involving a San Diego-based submarine.
   Another ship was towing the Blueback to San Diego, said Lt.
Sonya Hedley, a spokeswoman for the Naval Submarine Base here.
Officers initially had hoped the sub could make the trip under its
own power.
   ``They experienced a minor electrical fire in their propulsion
system,'' Hedley said. The sub, which carries a crew of 65 enlisted
and eight officers, was on general training operations, she said.
   In the other incident, the attack submarine Gurnard was freed
after being stuck on a reef for about four hours. The ship was
submerged when it hit the reef, Ms. Hedley said, correcting earlier
reports it was on the surface.
   No injuries were reported among the Gurnard's 135-man crew, the
Navy spokeswoman said, and the grounding was under investigation by
Rear Admiral David Oliver, who is commander of the San Diego-based
Submarine Group Five.

   Teachers and students returned to peaceful
campuses Friday after settlement of a nearly two-week strike, but
the atmosphere was more social than academic, some said.
   ``People haven't seen each other in two weeks and they want to
talk to each other and welcome each other back,'' said 10th Street
Elementary School Assistant Principal Evelyn Peter.
   Throughout the 700-square-mile district, teachers at nearly 600
schools were greeted with flowers, balloons and hugs from students.
But numerous absences indicated the Memorial Day weekend may have
tempted many students to stay away.
   Students who reported to class during the strike were subjected
to auditorium assemblies, educational films and lengthy study
periods overseen by substitute teachers. Thousands of others stayed
away from school.
   ``I don't think we knew how much our teachers provided us with
motivation to learn,'' said Sam Perez, a senior at Hollywood High
School.
   ``Everything is back to normal now,'' said a smiling Brenda
Montoya, a 10th grader at Belmont High School. ``We have our
teachers back and now we can get back to our studies.''
   Special education teacher Russell Ung said the mood among the
teachers was upbeat at Belmont High. ``It seems to be getting back
to normal. From everyone I've talked to, the mood is good, the
attitude is excellent,'' he said.
   But he noticed that classes seemed thin. ``Some may be taking
advantage of the long weekend,'' he said.
   There were 365,137 students in class in the nation's second
largest school district, hardly a dramatic lift from the 305,650
attending Thursday, the last day of the strike that began May 15.
   Teachers did return nearly in force, with 24,569 regularly
assigned teachers out of a possible 26,250 returning Friday, with
1,447 substitutes bringing the number to 26,016, ``pretty close to
full strength,'' said school district spokeswoman Eva Hain.
   On Thursday, members of United Teachers-Los Angeles approved by
voice vote a $600 million, three-year contract giving them a 24
percent raise over three years and a bigger voice in the control of
their schools.
   The Los Angeles Unified School District's seven-member board
approved the pact during a closed door meeting the same day, with
arguments centering on the $120 million in cuts the school board
staff says will have to be made elsewhere to provide the teacher
salary increases. The contract, 16 months in the making, is
retroactive to July.
   The union represents 22,000 of the district's 32,000 teachers,
counselors, nurses and librarians.

   Armstrong, commander of the Apollo 11 moon mission, was reunited
with his two crew mates for a news conference Friday to satisfy
requests for interviews in connection with celebrations planned
across the world to mark the event.
   He was asked when exactly he decided on the words ``That's one
small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,'' which he said
after climbing down the ladder on the lunar lander.
   ``It was a statement that was natural in the sense of the
time,'' Armstrong said. ``I thought about it after we got there.''
   With that he destroyed longstanding rumors in space circles that
some anonymous public relations genius, not Armstrong, created
those words for history.
   Armstrong, along with lunar module pilot Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin
and command module pilot Michael Collins, fielded questions from
reporters with humor and self-deprecation for the niche they carved
in the annals of exploration.
   Here are some Armstrong comments:
   _On the use of robots to explore space _ a technique favored by
many scientists: ``Man can be amused and amazed, and a robot can be
neither.''
   _On leaving footprints on the moon that will remain undisturbed
for millennia: ``I had hoped that somebody goes up there some day
and cleans them up.''
   _On how their lives were changed by their adventure: ``Before
1969, press conferences were much smaller.''
   _On whether the Apollo moon program was a stunt of little value:
``Even if it was a bad idea, I'm glad we did it.''
   All three were asked what moment of their mission they would
choose to relive.
   Aldrin, who just published a book on America's space program,
answered it would be the last 10 seconds before they touched down
on the lunar surface and the first 10 seconds afterward.
   Armstrong said, ``I would pick a moment when I could look out
the window and see a full Earth.''
   And Collins said it would be the moment when he saw the lunar
module returning from the moon's surface against the background of
the Earth floating in the black of space.
   In his view, he said, were both the Earth with three billion
people and the moon ship with only two.

<HEAD>Pro-Marijuana Group Agrees to Parking Lot Rally Without Rock Music</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   They can't play rock music, and they
have to use a parking lot, instead of a ballfield. But a
pro-marijuana group has won a judge's permission to hold a rally
over the Memorial Day weekend.
   U.S. District Judge Frank Freedman on Friday ordered the
Massachusetts Cannabis Reform Coalition to refrain from selling
T-shirts or playing amplified music at the rally Sunday in North
Adams, a small industrial city in the Berkshires.
   A rock concert would not be in keeping with the ``solemnity of
Memorial Day, when we acknowledge those who died representing their
country,'' the judge said.
   He also pointed out that ``the Constitution protects expressions
of thought, not profit-making activities.''
   Richard Evans, an attorney for the group, said it was willing to
use the parking lot, rather than a ballfield as it had originally
hoped.
   ``It's a disappointment, but we'll have speeches, acoustic music
and distribute literature,'' said Curt Mansfield, one of the
organizers, after the hearing in U.S. District Court in Springfield.
   On Wednesday, the judge told both sides to find a suitable place
for the rally. Mayor John Barrett III, who opposes legalization,
suggested the city landfill.
   ``This group has a right to express its feelings whether we
agree with them or not,'' Freedman said Friday, noting that the
coalition's request had been before the city Recreation Commission
for four months.
   Mansfield said the group initially wanted to march in the city's
Memorial Day Parade, but a Vietnam veterans group opposed the idea.
   ``They wanted no part of it,'' he said. ``So we came up the idea
of having a gathering in the park.''
   Said Evans: ``We recognize that reform of the marijuana laws is
a very controversial subject. And we were hesitant to inject it
into the Memorial Day Parade because of the solemnity of the
observance.''

<HEAD>Seabrook Operators Prepare for First Atomic Reaction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MOKRZYCKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEABROOK, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Engineer Edward Brown was part of the team
overseeing the startup of a Massachusetts reactor that 30 years ago
helped usher in the age of commercial nuclear power.
   Today, he is preparing to lead the start of atomic fission at
the Seabrook nuclear power plant, a symbol for the anti-nuclear
movement and bellwether for utility industry officials worldwide
who hope to promote a new, safer generation of nuclear reactors.
   The $6 billion Seabrook reactor, which was originally planned
for commercial operation in 1979 and completed but idle for three
years because of evacuation-planning and financial problems, won a
low-power testing license Friday.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted the license a day
after a federal appeals court declined to delay the tests.
   The testing process is expected to start this weekend, leading
to the first fission reaction in Seabrook's fuel core in seven to
10 days, Brown said.
   Brown, president of New Hampshire Yankee, which operates the
plant, recalled his days as a ``dark-haired young engineer''
conducting environmental monitoring at Massachusetts' Yankee Rowe
when the reactor started its atomic tests in 1960. It was the
nation's second commercial nuclear power plant.
   ``It's a different ball game now,'' Brown said in an interview
in his office.
   In contrast to Seabrook's tumultuous history, the Massachusetts
plant was built in three years for $45 million. It produces only
189 megawatts of electricity.
   Seabrook is supposed to produce six times as much.
   ``A lot more is at stake with this one,'' Brown said, arguing
that Seabrook is vital for meeting the region's energy needs.
   Seabrook's opponents agree that much is at stake, but for
different reasons. They say stopping the plant is crucial for the
health and safety of tens of thousands of people who live nearby.
   The low-power license does not settle disputes over evacuation
planning for crowded beaches and coastal communities within 10
miles of Seabrook _ the key issue blocking commercial operation.
   Seabrook officials hope to receive a commercial license in the
fall, but Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and other foes have
promised to fight it even if it means going to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
   Nuclear industry officials around the world also see high stakes
involved with the Seabrook plant, Brown said.
   ``We're aware the rest of the industry is watching us, but we're
not out there fighting the industry's battles,'' he said.
   Two weeks ago, Brown attended a conference in Moscow of nuclear
plant operators from 31 countries, and he said there was
``tremendous interest'' in Seabrook's progress.
   ``When I came back I told the folks here that it really dawned
on me for the first time _ there are people who perceive Seabrook
as the bellwether,'' Brown said. ``But I don't. My objective is to
get it running.''
   When Seabrook's tests start, valves will be opened and water
will be pumped through the reactor coolant system. Friction from
the rapid circulation would heat the reactor from 150 degrees to
its operating temperature of 557 degrees.
   Then, operators would set the stage for a nuclear chain reaction
by withdrawing neutron-absorbing control rods from the reactor fuel
core and reducing the amount of neutron-absorbing boron in the
coolant water, eventually letting uranium atoms start the fission
process.
   Brown estimated the plant would achieve initial ``criticality''
_ its first self-sustained fission reaction _ within seven to 10
days.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mission from the Organization of
American States has failed to make any progress toward a solution
of Panama's political crisis, an opposition leader said Friday.
   ``Unfortunately there has been no progress for the good of
Panama in the talks,'' said opposition presidential candidate
Guillermo Endara after meeting with the OAS delegation.
   The mission, made up of the foreign ministers of Ecuador,
Guatemala and Trinidad and Tobago, also met Friday with Panama's de
facto leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Endara and first vice presidential candidate Ricardo Arias
Calderon said the sticking point had been Noriega's refusal to
negotiate with the opposition.
   Endara said he would not take power if Noriega remained as
commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces, but Noriega called
questions about his possible retirement ``stupid.''
   Earlier Friday, Noriega told reporters that the military would
not be drawn into negotiations and that a solution to the political
crisis should come from talks between the opposition and
pro-government parties.
   ``They both claim they won,'' Noriega told reporters.
   Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez said the OAS mission
had succeeded in giving Noriega and the opposition each other's
point of view, but that a solution ``will require an enormous
effort from the Panamanian people.''
   The OAS delegation seeks to end the impasse created when the
government nullified the May 7 presidential election.
   The opposition, led by Endara, won the elections over
pro-government candidate Carlos Duque by a 3-1 margin, according to
international observers. Noriega's troops seized the vote tallies
and the election was nullified three days later.
   Noriega said Friday: ``The key to the problem lies with the
contending political parties. The opposition has declined to talk
to Duque.
   ``If the opposition remains intransigent, the Defense Forces are
not going to slip on a banana peel'' and be drawn into the dispute.
``The two sides have to start talking.''
   Opposition leaders say they will not negotiate with civilians
because the Defense Forces, which Noriega commands, hold the real
power in Panama.
   ``Nothing positive can come out of a negotiation between Duque
and Endara because Duque doesn't have a single drop of power,''
Endara said Friday in a telephone interview with The Associated
Press.
   ``We are willing to talk to Noriega about an institutional
solution, but for this it is vital that Noriega retire.''
   When asked to say who had won, Noriega said, ``That's up to the
Electoral Tribunal,'' which nullified the vote. ``I'm just another
Panamanian among 2,394,000.''
   Endara noted that, in a resolution passed before the mission was
sent, the OAS called for ``a transfer of power as soon as
possible.''
   ``They didn't talk about the presidency, but about power,''
Endara said. ``That power that is now in military hands.''
   The OAS mission came to Noriega's offices at Fort Amador, south
of Panama City, and waited 15 minutes before the general came
strolling down the street with a half-dozen staff officers,
munching on a mango.
   ``Panamanian mango,'' he remarked, taking a bite. ``You should
try it.''
   Noriega's offices back onto a U.S. naval station and are
cater-corner from the U.S. Southern Command's logistics and
personnel offices.
   Noriega, who also spent 2{ hours with the delegation Wednesday,
said he repeated that Panama's problems were caused by the
``interfering hands'' of the United States.
   Since President Bush sent 1,900 more troops to augment security
at Panama Canal installations, he said, ``Panamanian troops have
been instructed not to get trapped into a provocation. We also ask
Panamanian citizens not to do anything provocative.''
   Noriega has been indicted on drug trafficking charges in the
United States, which he describes as part of a U.S. plot to renege
on treaties that cede the canal to Panama at the end of 1999.
   He said the OAS had made some proposals, but he would not reveal
them.
   ``There are 100,000 formulas,'' he said. When asked if he would
step down, he replied: ``Don't ask stupid questions.''
   At Wednesday's meeting, the OAS was told Noriega's retirement
was a matter for the Defense Forces to consider, not the opposition
or the OAS.
   On Friday, Noriega called the international press
``disinformers'' and agents of imperialism.
   ``You are the ones who have made me out to be a dictator,'' he
said to an unruly crowd of reporters, photographers and television
cameramen. ``You say it's a dictatorship, but right here we have
anarchy.''

   Tobacco ads will be banned from
public billboards in this city of 450,000 in a bid to combat
tobacco-related diseases, a municipal official said.
   ``We think tobacco is such a threat to public health that steps
should be taken quickly,'' spokesman Andy Bellm said Friday.
   Under a city plan, the ads will be banned from The Hague's 250
advertising billboards after renewal of their annual lease
contracts, he said. Bellm said the tobacco ads, on about two-thirds
of the public advertising space, bring in $90,000 a year.
   He noted that in 1986, about 800 people in the city of 450,000
succumbed to tobacco-related diseases such as lung cancer, heart
attacks and respiratory problems. That was the latest year for
which figures are available.
   The Dutch government is considering extending a nationwide ban
on tobacco promotion on radio and television to a more
comprehensive one.

   Although Deng Xiaoping has been China's supreme
ruler for more than a decade, his differing approaches to economic
and political change have not met with universal approval.
   Deng's market-oriented economic reforms have achieved remarkable
results since 1978 and received a resounding vote of confidence at
the 13th Communist Party Congress in 1987. Under his policies,
millions of Chinese have seen their living standards increase
dramatically.
   Zhao Ziyang, who was named Communist Party chief at the
congress, was considered Deng's top protege and heir apparent
because of his enthusiastic support for economic liberalism and
opening up to the outside world.
   But Zhao's sympathy with student demands for free government and
democratic reform apparently proved unacceptable to Deng, an
84-year-old revolutionary with little tolerance for dissent.
   Zhao's moderate attitude toward the students resulted in his
loss of power this week to conservative Premier Li Peng.
   Li, an engineer trained in the Soviet Union, opposed the rapid
pace of economic decentralization that was the result of Deng's
policies. He instead prefered the status quo.
   But Li apparently was acting on Deng's behalf May 20 when he
decreed martial law for Beijing, where students and more than 1
million supporters have been demonstrating for political
liberalization.
   At least temporarily, supporters of Deng's conservative views on
political change have won out over supporters of his far-reaching
economic reforms.
   Among other leaders:
   President Yang Shangkun _ The former general has close ties to
Deng and has been viewed as a supporter of economic reform. Yang
apparently shares Deng's aversion to political pluralism, however,
and announced May 19 that troops were being sent to Beijing to
restore order.
   Wan Li _ The head of the National People's Congress is a firm
supporter of the market-oriented economic reform, but may not
approve Deng's crackdown. During a recent trip to the United
States, he praised the students as leading a patriotic movement and
urged a peaceful resolution to the uprising.
   Chen Yun _ The chairman of the Communist Party Central Advisory
Commission long has been viewed as a staunch conservative opposed
to Deng's economic reform. But he made clear in a speech Friday he
supports the hard-line stance against the pro-democracy movement.
   Joining Zhao and Li on the party's policy-making Politburo
Standing Committee are Hu Qili, Yao Yilin and Qiao Shi. Their
support of Deng's economic and political policies is difficult to
gauge, particularly because all of their meetings are in private.

   The passions of the 16th century, burning fiercely
in the Highlands of Scotland, have driven the Lord High Chancellor
from his church.
   Lord Mackay of Clashfern, Britain's chief legal officer, said
Friday that he would leave the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland
rather than promise not to attend Roman Catholic funeral Mass, as
he had done twice in honor of fellow peers.
   ``I have no intention of giving any such undertaking as that for
which the synod has asked,'' Mackay said in a statement issued from
his office in London.
   Like a 16th century chancellor, Sir Thomas More, Mackay was
forced to choose between private conscience and public duty in a
land where the church as well as the state derives its authority
from the crown.
   More, a Catholic, was beheaded in 1535 after refusing to
recognize Henry VIII's supremacy over the newly formed Church of
England, and the rhetoric of the Reformation echoed in the church
at Inverness where the ``Wee Frees'' held their annual synod this
week.
   ``I find it very difficult to believe that the lord chancellor
of a Protestant country, with a Protestant queen on a Protestant
throne, has any obligation by reason of state to go to a Popish
Mass,'' said the Rev. Donald MacLean, clerk of the Southern
Presbytery.
   Lord St. John of Fawsley, a prominent Roman Catholic and former
Cabinet officer, put the issue this way: ``What is the lord
chancellor of Great Britain, who is the head of the judiciary,
doing belonging to such an intolerant organization?''
   The struggle for the lord chancellor's soul was waged amid
scenes of stout women weeping, solemn men stomping their feet in
protest and the church's moderator, the Rev. Aaron Ndebele of
Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, banging his fist on the table for order.
   Mackay, an elder of his church in Edinburgh, had been suspended
last year following a complaint about his attendance at the funeral
of Lord Russell of Killowan at Westminster Cathedral in London. He
had attended another Catholic funeral in 1986.
   Speaking to the Lord Chancellor's opponents, the Rev. John Ross
of Tain warned the synod that it ``will make the name of this
church stink in the Highland, Scotland, the United Kingdom and
wherever it is known.''
   ``May God have mercy upon us as a church,'' said the Rev. Robert
Sinclair of Wick, at 90 the oldest clergyman in the church. ``Lord
Mackay is a man whose conscience is clear before God.''
   The Rev. Neil Ross of Laide, convenor of the church's committee
on religion and morals, noted that the synod had easily mustered a
unanimous vote some years ago to rebuke Prince Charles for
attending a Mass. ``Yet when one of our own goes to Mass there is a
big hullabaloo when he is disciplined for it,'' Ross said.
   The vote upholding Mackay's suspension, by 33-27, signaled a new
schism in a 6,000-member denomination born in protest in 1893.
   The Rev. Calum MacInnes of Toronto, who had once been threatened
with discipline for refusing to wear a clerical collar, filed a
formal protest and walked out. Besides the Mackay case, MacInnes
complained of a 1987 decision to refuse membership to a man whose
golf club was open on Sundays, and another last year to suspend a
minister who had invited a Catholic priest to pray at an education
committee meeting.
   Appointed lord chancellor by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in
1987, the 61-year-old Mackay presides over the House of Lords, the
unelected upper house of Parliament.
   His tenure has been controversial because of his proposals for
sweeping reform of the ancient privileges and powers of the English
bar, proposals which some lawyers have resented as coming from an
outsider.
   Mackay, with his twinkling eyes and soft smile, appears an
unlikely object of controversy.
   The son of a railway porter, he attended George Heriot's School
(``for the improvement of the children of poor but deserving
folk'') in Edinburgh and then took a degree in mathematics and
natural philosophy in Edinburgh.
   After lecturing for a time at Trinity College, Cambridge, he
turned to law in Scotland and eventually became Lord Advocate, the
top law officer in Scotland.
   In an interview with author John Mortimer, published in The
Daily Telegraph in February, Mackay had defended his church from
accusations of intolerance.
   ``It depends what you mean by intolerance,'' he said. ``If you
believe something strongly, if that is your faith, the testimony
you have received, you seek change in others by way of persuasion.''

   Country music singer Johnny Paycheck
will perform for his fellow inmates at an Ohio prison next month,
and ex-convict Merle Haggard will join him.
   Paycheck and Haggard will perform two concerts June 13 at the
Chillicothe Correctional Institution, said warden Arthur Tate Jr.
   ``We're excited about the opportunity to put on something like
this,'' Tate said. ``This has the makings of something really big.''
   Paycheck, 50, is serving a seven- to 9{-year sentence for
shooting a man in a southern Ohio bar in 1985. Paycheck is best
known for his 1978 hit song, ``Take This Job and Shove It.''
   Haggard, one of country music's top singers for the past 25
years, spent three years in San Quentin Prison for burglarizing a
cafe. He was paroled in 1960 and pardoned in 1972 by
then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan.
   The prison concert will be recorded for release as an album,
tentatively called ``Behind the Walls,'' Billy Don Burns,
Paycheck's record producer in Nashville, said Friday.

   Dolly Parton's younger sister,

   Dustin Hoffman will not pay any money
to the estate of a woman who accidentally died on the actor's
estate in 1986.
   A settlement was reached Thursday in a lawsuit against Hoffman
and three other defendants that stemmed from the drowning of Sheila
Cruse Fionda.
   ``The amount will not be disclosed but the settlement does not
involve any money from Mr. Hoffman,'' said Superior Court Judge
Walter M. Pickett Jr. The case was to go to trial Thursday.
   The lawsuit, filed by Fionda's former husband on behalf of their
son, concerned claims of wrongful death and negligence in Fionda's
Aug. 24, 1986, drowning. Hoffman was not at the estate at the time.
   Fionda, 43, a teacher, was found about 6 a.m. in the hot tub
portion of a swimming pool on Hoffman's Roxbury estate. An autopsy
showed her blood-alcohol count was three times the legal limit for
drunken driving in Connecticut.

   Former Miss America Bess Myerson's boyfriend has
left the Allenwood federal prison in Pennsylvania for a halfway
house in New York City to finish serving his sentence for tax
evasion.
   Carl Capasso, 47, owner of a sewer construction company, is due
for release June 26 after completing two years of a three-year
sentence.
   Inmates awaiting release live in the halfway house, but go to
work during the day and may receive weekend passes.
   Capasso was jailed in 1987 after pleading guilty to evading
nearly $1.5 million in taxes.
   Miss Myerson later was forced to leave her post as the city's
cultural affairs commissioner after taking the Fifth Amendment
before the grand jury that investigated Capasso.
   Later, she was accused of having used her city job to try to
influence a judge handling Capasso's divorce case. She was
acquitted of charges that she gave the judge's daughter a job in
return for rulings that reduced Capasso's support and child care
payments.

<HEAD>Judge Delays Trial After Iran-Contra Defendant Accuses Prosecution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trial of a former CIA agent in the
Iran-Contra arms and money affair is being delayed for two weeks
over allegations the prosecution is using the defendant's testimony
to a congressional panel.
   U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton on Friday moved the starting
date to July 24 after ex-CIA agent Joseph Fernandez said the
prosecution's case has been tainted by his immunized congressional
testimony.
   In a related case, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell on
Friday rejected a motion by former National Security Council aide
Oliver North for a post-trial hearing. North, convicted May 4 of
three felonies stemming from the Iran-Contra affair, had contended
that the evidence against him was prejudiced by his testimony
before Congress during televised hearings in 1987.
   Gesell said North's lawyers raised no new issues to warrant
another hearing or dismissal of the charges. The judge concluded in
a June 16, 1988, ruling that North's congressional testimony ``was
not submitted to the grand jury in any form.''
   In the Fernandez case, Hilton denied a motion to dismiss the
case, but the judge said he will look further into what steps the
prosecution took to insulate itself from Fernandez' testimony.
   Fernandez, the CIA's former station chief in Costa Rica, is
accused of obstructing and lying to the CIA inspector general's
office and the presidential Tower commission.
   He allegedly told investigators that a secret airstrip in Costa
Rica built as part of North's secret resupply network for the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels was an initiative of the Costa Rican
government.
   Fernandez allegedly told the Tower panel he did not know for a
fact that North was assisting the resupply effort, which was
prohibited by Congress.
   Under immunity from prosecution, Fernandez later told
congressional investigators the airstrip was tied into the resupply
effort and that North was part of it.
   Fernandez lawyer Thomas Wilson said two CIA employees, Cole
Black and Louis Dupart, were familiar with Fernandez' immunized
testimony, yet were questioned extensively by prosecutors.
   Wilson said Black maintained he was unable to ``ferret out''
what he learned from Fernandez' immunized testimony and what he
learned from non-immunized testimony. Prosecutor Robert Longstreth
disputed Wilson's contention, saying prosecutors' questions to
Black were framed narrowly and that none of his answers was based
on Fernandez' immunized testimony.
   A Supreme Court ruling bars prosecutors from making any use of
someone's immunized testimony in prosecuting the person. The office
of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, which is prosecuting
Fernandez, has gone to extreme lengths to wall itself off from such
testimony, Longstreth said.
   Walsh's office will supply the court with information on the
steps it has taken to remain free from the taint of immunized
testimony, the judge said at the end of a hearing.
   The trial is expected to last about three weeks. Prosecutor
Laurence Shtasel said the government will call 15 to 18 witnesses
and take five to seven days to present its case. Wilson said the
defense will take a ``similar amount of time.''

<HEAD>Argentines Loot Supermarkets; Police Deployed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supermarkets in at least four
cities were looted and one was set afire in unrest prompted by high
inflation. No injuries were reported, but more than 90 people were
arrested.
   Police in central Cordoba, Argentina's second-biggest city, were
deployed at public buildings and radio and TV stations as well as
supermarkets to ward off incidents, police and Argentine media
reported. They said authorities seized firebombs.
   In Mendoza, 620 miles west of Buenos Aires, a supermarket was
set ablaze Friday by firebombs, the news agencies Diario y Noticias
and Noticias Argentinas reported.
   In the working class towns of Quilmes to the south and Mataderos
to the west, food stores and delivery trucks were robbed, the news
agencies said.
   Police and the news agencies reported 60 arrests in Cordoba,
about 25 in Mataderos and six in Quilmes.
   In Buenos Aires on Friday night, about 300 women demanding wage
increases and an end to recent price rises banged pots and pans
outside Government House.
   Inflation is projected to top 70 percent this month, wages have
shrunk by more than 30 percent this year and people are hungry
across this country that exports huge quantities of grain and beef.
   ``What I spent to buy five bottles of cooking oil last month
won't buy even one now,'' said Elsa de Bermudez, a housewife at the
rally in Buenos Aires.
   ``My husband works two jobs and earns about 5,000 australs'' a
month, or about $25, she said. ``It's humiliating. It makes me
sick.''
   President Alfonsin's governing Radical Civic Union lost
elections May 14 to the Peronist Party in large part because of the
deteriorating economy. Alfonsin offered to step down before
scheduled on Dec. 10; President-elect Carlos Menem declined to take
office early.
   The Argentine currency has been devalued by 90 percent against
the dollar since February. Bus and commuter train, gas,
electricity, telephone and other public utility rates were
increased sharply last week.
   Exchange houses were closed since Monday in an effort to reduce
speculation against the austral. Banks, which fear a run on
deposits, were closed Monday and Tuesday but resumed some
transactions Wednesday. The limit for withdrawals is 20,000
australs every two days, or about $100.
   Looting of supermarkets, butcher shops, food stores and delivery
trucks _ and clashes with police, who have fired tear gas and
rubber bullets _ began Tuesday. Some hungry looters have eaten food
on the spot.
   The government attributes the incidents to agitators that so far
it has refused to identify. ``There is no doubt'' that the looters
are organized, said Facundo Suarez, chief of the state intelligence
agency.
   Alfonsin reportedly was set to address the nation Sunday to
announce details of a new anti-inflation program.

   About 300 radical students went on a
hunger strike outside a Roman Catholic cathedral on Friday in a
protest they said was inspired by the student-led demonstrations in
China.
   The students gathered at Seoul's Myongdong Cathedral to call for
the overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo's government and an
investigation into the death of student leader Lee Chol-gyu.
   ``Overthrow the murder regime!'' and ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!''
protesters chanted as riot police watched but made no move to
intervene.
   The peaceful protest strike was called amid growing pressure on
students to end their violent protests.
   South Korean newspapers have praised the Chinese student
protesters in Beijing for their peaceful tactics in calling for
freedom and democracy. About 3,000 students went on a hunger strike
in Beijing on May 13 to dramatize their demands. That hunger strike
was lifted a week later.
   South Korean student leaders said Friday they were using the
same tactics as Chinese students. Some students claimed they would
fast to the death if their demands were not met.
   ``We are more determined than the students fasting in China,''
one student said.
   About 100 students chanted slogans at the cathedral's main gate.
Others rested in the cathedral compound or took part in discussion
groups, taking water but no food. Students stayed out of the
cathedral itself and administration buildings.
   The Korean students are pro-leftist and anti-Western, rejecting
Western democracy as unsuitable for Korean conditions and calling
for an ill-defined ``workers and farmers state.''
   The Chinese students are demonstrating for a freer society and
an end to official corruption, but are not calling for an overthrow
of the communist system.
   Radical students in South Korea lack popular support because of
their extreme views and violent tactics. Some student groups have
been trying to switch tactics after six riot police officers were
killed May 3 in a clash in the southern city of Pusan.
   A seventh trooper injured in the clash died Thursday night,
police said.
   Radical students and dissidents claim Lee was tortured and
killed by police and are demanding the government admit there has
been a cover up. Lee's body was found May 10 in a reservoir near
the southern city of Kwangju.
   Dissident groups called for a major demonstration in Seoul on
Saturday to protest Lee's death, but police banned the rally.
   Officials deny involvement in Lee's death, although police tried
to detain him at a roadblock just before he disappeared. The
government says an autopsy proves Lee was not tortured and
officials speculate he fell into the reservoir.
   Posters with color pictures of Lee's bloated body were put up
Friday by students in the cathedral compound.
   Crowds of up to 100,000 people marched in Kwangju last week to
demand the government admit police killed Lee. The demonstrations
also called for Roh's fall for the bloody suppression of a 1980
uprising in Kwangju.
   The hunger strikers in Seoul said Friday they also were
demanding Roh's ouster for the Kwangju uprising. Roh was a senior
general during the uprising.
   Protesters also chanted anti-U.S. slogans Friday. They claim the
United States was involved in Kwangju and are demanding expulsion
of the 43,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea.

   House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho, under
scrutiny for his personal business dealings, said he intends to
resign from Congress next month, Majority Leader Tom Foley
confirmed Friday night.
   Coelho's decision was a stunning followup to Speaker Jim
Wright's reported decision to resign under an ethical cloud.
   Foley, of Washington, told The Associated Press he had spoken to
Coelho and that ``he's decided to give up his whip post and go into
(the) private sector which he has considered doing at some time
before.''
   The New York Times reported in its Saturday editions that Coelho
said in an interview he would give up his leadership post as soon
as a replacement is picked and would resign his California House
seat on June 15, his 47th birthday.
   Coelho declined comment through a spokesman Friday night. The
congressman did not return messages left at his home.
   Foley said, ``In the current environment, realistically, there
might be a long period of inquiry which he feels would be damaging
to the party or to the House for which he has deep affection.''
   ``He just said he couldn't be an effective majority leader with
these charges out there,'' a top Democratic leadership source told
The Associated Press. The source, who insisted on anonymity, said
Coelho felt he could not remain as an effective whip and thus saw
no reason to remain in Congress.
   Coelho, the House's No. 3 Democrat, told the Times he was taking
the actions to avoid a protracted investigation of his personal
finances.
   ``I want to give my party a chance to move on,'' the Times
quoted him as saying.
   ``I don't intend to put my party through more turmoil,'' Coelho
told the Times. ``I don't intend to put this institution through
more turmoil. And more importantly, I don't intend to put my family
through more turmoil.''
   ``If I can't be leader and if I can't be whip, it's time to try
a new and different challenge. Therefore, June 15, which is my 47th
birthday, will be my last day in the Congress,'' the paper quoted
him as saying.
   Earlier this month, Coelho acknowledged that a California
savings and loan executive set him up in a junk bond investment
that netted him a $6,882 profit without him having to put up any of
his own money.
   However, Coelho had said that except for some reporting errors
the 1986 deal was ``totally above board'' and he did nothing wrong.
   A source close to Coelho said Friday night that ``He basically
said he's devoted 25 years to public life, he has worked for social
change, and he has spent too much time trying to build the party
up. He doesn't want his attention or abilities distracted in this
fashion.
   ``He has been told by his attorneys that he has no legal
difficulties,'' the source said. ``But he just thinks enough is
enough. He does not want to put his party through it.'' The source
said the resignation is expected to be announced in a statement to
be released Saturday.
   Coelho has been a rising star in the Democratic firmament in the
House, and his aides were busily spreading the word earlier in the
day that he intended to try and move up to majority leader if
Wright resigns, as expected next week, and Majority Leader Tom
Foley becomes speaker.
   At the same time, some Democrats expressed concern privately
over the possible political damage to the party if Coelho took on a
more prominent role at a time when his business dealings were
coming under close scrutiny on the heels of Wright's apparently
unsuccessful campaign to fend off multiple ethics allegations.
   Foley said, ``I think this is a loss for the House of
Representatives... He's had a brilliant record as chairman of the
campaign committee and as the party whip, and I think he'll be
deeply missed by his colleagues and by the constituents he served
so well.''
   Coelho's reported decision could result in a political
free-for-all when House Democrats meet to select new leaders. Foley
is widely expected to be the next speaker, assuming that Wright
resigns next week as expected, and the jockeying already had begun
to fill the other rungs on the leadership ladder.
   Coelho's reported decision would bring an end to a successful
career in the House.
   The Californian was widely respected and liked by other
Democrats for his work as chairman of the party's campaign
committee, which raised funds and provided campaign services for
the party's candidates.
   A report released by Coelho on May 14 showed that Thomas
Spiegel, chief executive officer of the Columbia Savings and Loan
Assn. of Beverly Hills, Calif., purchased $100,000 in bonds for
Coelho and held them until Coelho could raise money to pay for them.
   Spiegel also provided half of the money to finance the bonds.
   The bond was sold to Coelho by the executive a month later at
the initial offering price, saving Coelho about $4,000 compared to
the bond's market price at the time. The Los Angeles Times reported
this week that the Justice Department was opening a criminal
investigation of whether Coelho received favored treatment, but
Coelho said the story was wrong.
   However, Coelho acknowledged that he regretted the deal. He put
his personal funds into a blind trust last year, and he said he
wished he had done it earlier.
   According to Coelho's report, he first considered investing his
1986 campaign funds in 12{ percent bonds, based on a suggestion by
Spiegel. Coelho ruled out that type of investment for his campaign,
but Spiegel suggested the congressman himself could make an
investment in the bonds.
   In the report earlier this month, Coelho's lawyer, Robert F.
Bauer, concluded that Spiegel's role in the transaction could not
be considered a ``gift'' which would violate House rules, because
Coelho paid him interest.

<TEXT>
   The voracious Japanese appetite for sea
urchins has created a booming market for the spiny creatures, and
University of Maine researchers want to develop an even better
version.
   ``Presently, if you take 100, you might get 50 or 60 in a load
that are grade A color,'' said Ben Baxter, extension marine program
coordinator. ``We're trying to get it up to 80 or better. In the
Japanese market, which is very fussy, if you can produce a reliable
product, that is worth more.''
   Sea urchin gourmets consume the eggs, or roe. Researchers hope
they will get greater quantities of roe and give it the colors
considered most desirable by Japanese diners if they keep urchins
in pens and feed them kelp and fish byproducts, Baxter said.
   The new, improved urchins could double or triple a seller's
income.
   A state Department of Marine Resources official doesn't believe
the project will make anybody rich because ``ranching'' the urchins
will probably not be economically feasible.
   ``That's one of their pipe dreams,'' said Phil Averill, director
of the Maine Fisheries Technology Service. ``The price isn't there.
They aren't going to get any more for that urchin than the wild
harvester is.''
   Averill said the industry has been around for 25 or 30 years in
Maine, but it really took off in the last three years because of
the yen's high value in relation to the dollar.
   ``We are estimating that 10 million pounds were shipped last
season,'' he said. ``That's up from like 6 million a year before
that, and there was like 1 million the year before that. You can
estimate 35 cents a pound. On 10 million pounds, that's $3.5
million.''
   When the value of the yen drops in relation to the dollar, the
Japanese are likely to start shopping elsewhere for their urchins,
Averill said. Maine's urchins are not much different from other
urchins, and people harvesting them here don't always know how to
pick the best ones, he said.
   ``There's been a tremendous amount of urchins rejected for
quality reasons,'' Averill said. ``Maine has a so-so reputation.''
   Baxter maintains the research could lead to superior sea urchins
of a bright yellow color favored by many Japanese.
   ``They can range from a muddy brown to a rain-slicker yellow,
with several cream colors at the other end of the spectrum,''
Baxter said. ``If they have a bright yellow color, it gives them a
sweetish flavor. It can almost be a honey flavor.''
   Averill said the state and the university have developed a color
chart that the Japanese can use in ordering urchins that will be
pleasing to the eye. The roe color preferred by the diners varies
from city to city in Japan, and the chart gave Maine urchin sellers
a better idea of what to send.
   ``After you've been looking at sea urchins all day, they start
to look alike,'' Averill said.
   Baxter tries to discourage the notion that someone can easily
start making money in the sea urchin business, pointing out that
someone needs the proper equipment and needs to know how to harvest
the creatures.
   ``Neither the roe improvement nor the wild harvesting are
gold-rush industries,'' Baxter said. ``They're not get-rich-quick
schemes. It's damn hard work and a very fussy market.''

   A young woman was charged with shooting

their child, turned on the radio and began singing loudly, said
Capt. Bob Shortess of the Baton Rouge Sheriff's Department.
   Mrs. Ross asked her husband to stop singing a couple of times
and, when he refused, she picked up the child and tried to leave
the room, Shortess said. Mrs. Ross then picked up a revolver and

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citing concerns of residents fearful of crime
and addicts in their neighborhoods, former first lady Nancy Reagan
just said no to plans for a drug rehabilitation center that would
bear her name.
   Mrs. Reagan cited local concerns for her decision to abandon the
$10 million Nancy Reagan Center for Drug Rehabilitation, a
spokesman said Friday.
   ``There is a God. I'm on the verge of tears,'' said Lew Snow,
vice president of the Lake View Terrace Homeowners Association, the
group opposing the center. ``I think it shows you can beat city
hall.
   ``Despite all the pressures that people with money and power can
put on a mixed community of all races and incomes, they can still
pull together to defend themselves and win.''
   Residents of the rustic Lake View Terrace neighborhood 20 miles
northwest of downtown had objected to the drug treatment center,
claiming it could bring crime to the neighborhood and traffic jams
when Mrs. Reagan visited it.
   Phoenix House, which operates 10 drug treatment centers
nationwide, said Mrs. Reagan's decision to withdraw ended its
efforts to take over the closed Lake View Terrace Medical Center,
but indicated another San Fernando Valley location would be sought
to bear Mrs. Reagan's name.
   The former first lady ``has been deeply impressed by many
treatment programs, especially Phoenix House, which enjoys a
well-deserved reputation for excellence,'' Reagan family spokesman
Mark Weinberg said. ``But Mrs. Reagan respects the concerns of
those in the Lake View Terrace neighborhood. She regrets that this
situation has upset members of the community.''
   Mrs. Reagan has continued her ``Just Say No'' anti-drug crusade
since moving back to California earlier this year.
   ``Phoenix House understands Mrs. Reagan's desire to change the
proposed site of the Nancy Reagan Center,'' said spokeswoman Billie
Greer. ``Accordingly we will terminate our agreement to purchase
the former Lake View Medical Center in Lake View Terrace.''
   Greer said the organization remained ``committed to meeting the
treatment needs of young drug abusers in the San Fernando Valley.''
Another location in the area would be sought, she said.
   Snow said he learned of Mrs. Reagan's decision to withdraw
during a meeting with Nancy Reagan Foundation Executive Director
John Gustafson, Reagan chief of staff Fred Ryan, and Howard
Raphael, the lobbyist hired by the Lake View Terrace Homeowners
Association.
   ``We were dumbfounded,'' Snow said. ``Of the 500 things on my
list of things to come up in the meeting, that was not one of
them.''
   On March 8, the proposed drug center had won a conditional use
permit from the Board of Zoning Appeals, which placed strict
security requirements on the site, and a two-year limit to the
operating permit.
   Associate Zoning Administrator Darryl Fisher said then that
Phoenix House would have to erect a seven-foot wrought-iron fence
around the center, maintain a 24-hour guard at the front gate, and
place video surveillance cameras inside the center.
   Phoenix House was to have 210 beds, a residential high school
and treatment center for as many as 150 teen-agers and 60 young
adults.
   Snow said a planned June 4 demonstration in front of the
Reagan's Bel-Air home had been canceled.
   ``We'll probably have some kind of neighborhood rally instead,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia Court of Appeals is
trying to decide whether Washington's ban on capital punishment can
be used to block the extradition of a juvenile facing a possible
death sentence in Alabama.
   Gerald Fisher, an attorney for the 17-year-old boy identified
only by the initials O.M., urged a three-judge panel of the court
Friday to overturn a lower court ruling that Alabama's extradition
bid must be honored.
   Fisher said the district government's death penalty prohibition
must override its obligation under the Interstate Compact on
Juveniles, the agreement which requires states to honor each
other's extradition requests for juveniles.
   But Edward Schwab, assistant corporation counsel for the
district government, said the interstate compact does not give the
district the discretion to impose its anti-death penalty policy on
Alabama or any other state.
   The three-judge panel court did not indicate when it would rule,
although it agreed in March to handle the case on an expedited
basis.
   O.M. was arrested by district police last December on juvenile
charges of arson and murder stemming from a May 1988 firebombing in
Gadsden, Ala., which killed 14-month-old Tamel Jackson. His uncle,
Yul Devoe Guice, 31, also has been charged with arson and murder in
the case.
   O.M.'s lawyers contend the youth, who is black, will not be
treated fairly the all-white judicial system in Gadsden.
   District City Councilwoman Wilhelmina Rolark, chairman of the
council's judiciary committee, has introduced emergency legislation
to prohibit the district from extraditing any juvenile facing a
potential death sentence unless the state involved certifies that
it will not seek the death penalty. A hearing on her bill is set
for Tuesday.
   During Friday's hearing, James Klein, another attorney for O.M.,
argued that the interstate compact is not valid in the district
because its ratification papers never were published in city
regulations, as required by a 1984 district law.
   One judge indicated that Klein's argument might provide
sufficient grounds to overturn the order that O.M. be returned to
Alabama.
   The Supreme Court is expected to rule in July whether imposing
the death sentence on murderers who commit their crimes before age
18 violates the Constitution's ban on ``cruel and unusual
punishment.''

<HEAD>Agency Rejects Challenge To Multibillion-Dollar AT&amp;T Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission rejected
a challenge to one of the largest non-military government contracts
awards ever made, a decision that could mean up to $15 billion in
business for AT&amp;T.
   In a ruling Friday, the FCC's common carrier bureau said Martin
Marietta Corp. and MCI Communications Corp. failed to prove their
claim that American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. violated regulatory
guidelines by offering a bid below its actual costs.
   ``We conclude that no compelling argument has been presented
that the tariff proposal is patently unlawful so as to require
rejection and that no question has been presented that warrants
investigation at this time,'' said Brock, the FCC's top telephone
official.
   ``This is very good news for AT&amp;T,'' company spokesman Herb
Linnen said. ``We have said all along that the protest was without
merit _ another example of AT&amp;T's long-distance competitors using
the regulatory arena to win something they have lost in the
competitive marketplace.''
   MCI spokeswoman Kathleen Keegan said company officials were
reviewing the order to determine their options.
   ``We're disappointed that the FCC apparently accepted AT&amp;T's
faulty legal justification regarding the establishment of
preferential rates for the government,'' Ms. Keegan said.
   Martin Marietta spokesman Tom Hobson said company attorneys
would review the decision next week and decide whether to appeal to
the full commission.
   The General Services Administration in December awarded 60
percent of the contract to AT&amp;T and the remaining 40 percent to US
Sprint Communications Co. The contract is for telephone and other
high-tech communications equipment and could be worth up to $25
billion, with a $15 billion cap on the amount that could go to AT&amp;T.
   Martin Marietta and MCI challenged the GSA decision, alleging in
their petition to the FCC that AT&amp;T offered the government
``unreasonably preferential and discriminatory'' rates that were
below what it would cost AT&amp;T to provide the services.
   In its response, AT&amp;T maintained its rates would cover costs and
asserted that even if the commission found otherwise there was
legal precedent for offering the government preferential rates.
   The system AT&amp;T and US Sprint are to provide to the government,
known as FTS-2000, is a custom-designed communications network
using digital and fiber optic technology to link the federal
government's expansive telecommunications system.

<TEXT>
   A former rebel leader returned home
after more than two years in exile and became the first to sign a
document saying she did not support armed struggle against the
leftist government.
   ``I have been forced to fulfill a requirement in order to be
allowed back into my own country,'' Azucena Ferrey, a former member
of the Nicaraguan Resistance directorate, said upon her return
Friday.
   ``But the struggle of the Nicaraguan people is well worth
bending one's pride.''
   About 40 cheering supporters, most of them from the Democratic
Christian Party, greeted Ms. Ferrey's flight from Costa Rica.
   ``At this time the battlefield is on the political field,'' Ms.
Ferrey said when asked if her return meant she had cut ties to the
rebels, known as Contras.
   The U.S.-backed rebels have fought the leftist Sandinista
government since 1981. In August 1987, the five Central American
presidents signed a peace plan whose provisions include an end to
insurgencies in the region and to outside aid to rebel groups.
   Adan Fletes of the Social Christian Party was among those who
greeted Ms. Ferrey at the airport. Ms. Fletes said she would run
for a National Assembly seat in general elections scheduled for
February 1990.
   Ms. Fletes also said she will participate in a march organized
by 15 political parties and opposition labor groups set for Sunday
in Masaya.
   Ms. Ferrey said she planned to stay in Nicaragua about a week
but intended to return to Nicaragua permanently.
   Also Friday, wildcat strikes by teachers demanding higher pay
waned after the government expelled two U.S. diplomats, accusing
them and right-wing parties of instigating the walkouts.
   The government said Thursday that the diplomats attended teacher
meetings in Chinandega the day before and promised money to
encourage strikes. The U.S. Embassy denied the charges.

<HEAD>Petition By Older Pilots Denied</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has denied
a petition from a group of older pilots seeking permission to fly
after age 60, saying older pilots are more likely to be involved in
accidents.
   The agency announced, however, that it would fund a detailed
study of pilot age and accident rates and indicated it might be
willing to certify individual pilots over 60 if a way can be found
to determine their capacities.
   ``What is needed and what the petitioners have failed to show,''
the FAA said Friday, ``is a way to discriminate between those who
contribute to the adverse trend of increasing accidents (involving
older pilots) and those who do not.''
   The FAA said it is willing to look at any scientific evidence
that will help in setting criteria for selecting older pilots who
have a low accident risk.

<HEAD>Supplemental Housing Allowance Readjusted by Pentagon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon announced it has readjusted a key
supplemental housing allowance and more than 800,000 people in the
military services will see a small increase in that part of their
paycheck.
   The change in the variable housing allowance, set to begin June
1, will be the second increase this year.
   The Pentagon declined to estimate the average increase on a
percentage basis, saying all the geographic factors hadn't been
computed. But figures released by the Defense Department suggest
the increase will exceed this year's first hike of 3.4 percent, and
will range from an average $4.80 a month extra for a private to
$13.01 a month extra for a colonel.
   Military officials boosted the allowance in January,
deliberately holding down the size of that hike to make sure the
Pentagon didn't exceed a congressional limit of $1.22 billion for
the entire program.

   VA Secretary Edward Derwinski on Friday announced a freeze,
except in emergencies, on accepting new patients with
non-service-connected ailments whose incomes are above certain

   Rep. G. V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of the House

<TEXT>
   Even after tests on air, food and water,
and blood samples from the victims, authorities have yet to find a
cause for 62 office workers becoming so ill that they had to be
treated at hospitals.
   ``We may never find out,'' said Jack Brown, acting director of
the city and county health department's environmental health
division. ``We've done everything possible in the analytical
viewpoint. We went from roof to basement and we didn't find
anything.''
   Brown and others investigating the phenomenon are considering
such causes as lingering airborne pesticides and Sick Building
Syndrome at the Pioneer TeleTechnologies office where the employees
took sick Thursday night.
   Sick Building Syndrome is an illness associated with new or
renovated buildings that have a lot of synthetic materials and poor
ventilation. The telemarketing office was renovated six months ago.
   But every test that Brown and other health and emergency service
workers performed provided no insight about the cause.
   ``We've tested all of that with very sophisticated equipment and
we've found nothing,'' Brown said Friday.
   About 7:30 p.m. a pregnant worker became ill at the
telemarketing office in the lower level of a shopping center, and a
paramedic was called. Shortly after that, a second pregnant woman
became ill and another ambulance was summoned.
   About 9:45 p.m., the paramedics were called a third time. This
time, it was for dozens of people complaining of headaches,
dizziness and nausea.
   Three paramedics and a two firefighters also became ill.
   By 10 p.m., ambulances were taking people to four hospitals and
medical centers.
   But it didn't end there. Workers who went home had delayed
reactions. Several were picked up at their homes by paramedics and
taken to the hospital.
   Business was normal at the shopping center Friday, but the
telemarketing company was closed, and Brown said it was unknown
when it would reopen.
   Hospital spokesmen who declined to give out specific information
said that only a few people remained hospitalized for further
observation. The others were treated and released.

<TEXT>
   Rain has ended a three-month
drought, but it came too late to save much of the rice that most of
this impoverished nation's 110 million people rely upon, farmers
and officials said.
   ``Last week's rain should have come at least a month ago. Now
there is water, but the damage is already done,'' said Abdul Jalil,
a farmer who has to feed 24 people in his family.
   Agriculture officials said the rain can save only 40 percent of
the rice crop near this village about 130 miles northwest of Dhaka.
In some areas the loss is estimated at 80 percent, the officials
said on condition of anonymity.
   Jalil planted rice on the two acres he owns and was planning to
sell the expected harvest of 22,800 pounds.
   ``But this year I will have to buy rice from the market to feed
my family,'' he said, sitting at the edge of his withered rice
paddies.
   Jalil, 40, said he was still trying to repay a bank loan taken
to offset losses during last summer's floods.
   The deluge inundated four-fifths of Bangladesh, killing at least
1,400 people and destroying 2.5 million tons of rice and wheat.
   Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the world with
annual per capita income of $160, alternates between flood and
drought. These and other natural disasters such as tornadoes and
cyclones have crippled government efforts to improve the economy.
   Almost 80 percent of the population depends on agriculture. In
good years, the country produces about 17 million of the 18.5
million tons of grain needed to feed itself. The rest is imported.
   Economists fear this year's drought will prompt a food shortage.
   ``Though the government claims it has adequate food stock, we
are apprehensive. The effect of drought on the economy is going to
be significant,'' said Khwaja Shamsul Huq, head of he Association
of Development Agencies in Bangladesh.
   The group is a coalition of more than 100 local and foreign
non-government organizations.
   The government says it has a food grain reserve of 800,000 tons
and plans to import 2 million tons more.
   Agriculture Ministry officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said last year's flood and the current drought may push
the deficit to 3 million tons.
   The officials said 80 percent of the shallow wells in the area
had run dry. Deep wells, reaching nearly 500 feet underground,
still functioned, but these accounted for only 10 percent of the
total wells.
   Sheikh Surat Ali, another Taraganj farmer, said his village had
only one pump to operate wells that irrigate more than 40 acres.
``But that also did not work'' for most of April.
   ``Today I got water but it will be 15 days before my next
turn,'' Ali said, wiping his brow with his tattered sarong. He said
50 farmers share the pump.
   Officials and economists say relying on deep wells also lowers
the water table.
   A National Disaster Planning Council has discussed building
canals for more water. It also wants to improve techniques to
evacuate people during floods. But the plan has a $7 billion price
tag and the government is seeking foreign donations to implement it.
   ``We are tied in a vicious circle. Flooding this year, drought
next year. It seems we have no escape from natural disasters,'' a
Planning Ministry official said on condition of anonymity.

   A cholera epidemic has broken out in
Angola's capital of Luanda, killing 83 people and infecting more
than 3,000, the official Angolan news agency ANGOP reported.
   The report, monitored in Lisbon on Friday, said the deaths were
reported in Luanda from May 1 to Tuesday. It said flooding had
contaminated the city's water supply, causing the epidemic.
   The agency quoted the director of the Angolan National Health
Program, Pedro de Almeida, as saying 3,364 cases of the disease had
been registered in two Luanda hospitals.
   Lisbon radio on Thursday quoted unidentified Angolan health
officials as saying the epidemic had caused at least 100 deaths.
The radio said supplies of medicine were growing scarce and
authorities had appealed for international help.
   ANGOP said the area of Benguela, south of Luanda, was also
affected.
   The report urged people to boil drinking water and avoid seafood
and raw fruit and vegetables.
   Cholera is an acute intestinal infection that causes dehydration.

   The government and opposition
appeared no closer to resolving the presidential election crisis
after a visit by representatives of the Organization of American
States.
   The opposition said Friday that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
Panama's de facto ruler, must be a party to any negotiations.
Noriega, however, insisted the opposition must negotiate with
pro-government parties.
   The OAS mission, scheduled to leave today, had hoped to help
resolve an impasse that arose when the government nullified the May
7 presidential elections. International observers said the
opposition won by a 3-1 margin.
   ``At this time what we hoped for has not been achieved, an
agreement among Panamanians to resolve the crisis that bedevils
Panama,'' opposition candidate Guillermo Endara said Friday after
meeting with the OAS delegation.
   A member of the OAS delegation, Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez
of Ecuador, said the opposition and government ``understand each
other better, but it will require an enormous effort from the
Panamanian people because they have to develop the formulas to
solve the problem.''
   The other members of the mission were the foreign ministers of
Guatemala and Trinidad and Tobago, and OAS Secretary General Joao
Baena Soares of Brazil. The delegation must file a report the day
before the OAS foreign ministers meet on June 6 to consider the
organization's next step.
   Endara said he would not accept the presidency on Sept. 1, even
if Noriega allowed it but remained commander of the Panamanian
Defense Forces.
   ``I would just be a puppet,'' Endara said.
   The opposition has said repeatedly that Noriega and the Defense
Forces hold real power in Panama and therefore must be a part of
any talks.
   Noriega, at a news conference after his own meeting with the OAS
delegation, said: ``The key to the problem lies with the contending
political parties ... If the opposition remains intransigent, the
Defense Forces are not going to slip on a banana peel'' and be
drawn into the dispute.
   ``The two sides have to start talking,'' he said. ``They both
claim they won.''
   He said questions about the possibility of his own resignation
were ``stupid.''
   Noriega, who was indicted in February 1988 on drug charges in
the United States, said he told the OAS that Panama's problems were
caused by ``interfering hands.''
   He cited the drug charges, which he denies, and economic
sanctions as proof that the United States was plotting to keep the
Panama Canal despite treaties that call for the canal to be turned
over at the end of 1999.

   For slot machine players who feel
they ``get no respect,'' billionaire Donald Trump's casino presents
the ultimate in pampering.
   Not one to ignore customers with big bucks, Trump has created an
elegant slot machine section away from the run-of-the-mill tourists
on the main casino floor.
   Mind you, this posh place is not for those customers who gamble
with quarters and nickels. The ``Monte Carlo Casino,'' which opens
this weekend at Trump Castle Hotel and Casino, features three $100
slot machines _ one with a $400,000 jackpot _ seven $25 slots and
51 $5 slots.
   If slot players invest enough, they will be treated just like
the high roller in the baccarat pit. The new section, which cost
$1.5 million to furnish and equip, has been enclosed with marble
walls, brass rails and etched glass. Flowering plants line the
sides. Deluxe chairs with armrests face each slot machine, and
phone jacks are available alongside.
   The ``Monte Carlo Ambassadors'' _ butlers in tuxedos _ will
provide every amenity: light snacks, slippers for tired feet, a
neck massage and even a hot towel to wipe hands that have been
dirtied by those big-buck tokens.
   ``Traditionally, slot players are handed a Wet-Nap at the
cashier's window,'' said Trump Castle spokeswoman Jeanine Repa.
``We wanted to take things a step up for our preferred customers.''

   Katarina is a Pole by birth who adopted Sweden
as her home, but at an all-American hot dog and apple pie Memorial
Day event she conceded she feels most at home here where she can be
``free, free, free.''
   Katarina and about 80 other foreigners were treated to a slice
of Americana on the eve of a three-day holiday weekend in which
Americans remember their war servicemen.
   The Friday night event was anything but somber, however.
   In fact, it could easily have been called corny except for the
fact that these foreigners beamed with patriotic pride as they
belted out ``Yankee Doodle,'' ``When Johnny Comes Marching Home,''
and other familiar American tunes.
   The Memorial Day festival _ complete with hot dogs and beans,
coleslaw, real lemonade, and apple pie _ took place in the concrete
jungle of Manhattan. The group enthusiastically swayed and members
clapped their hands as the Pep Boys band gave a sampling of
bluegrass.
   Stockholm, where Katarina lived for 20 years, ``is clean,
beautiful, safe and b-o-r-i-n-g,'' she said. In New York, ``you can
find people on the streets all night.''
   What about the crime?
   ``Crime is everywhere. Eight million people live in Sweden and
eight million people live in New York. I'm sure as much crime
occurs in all of Sweden as in New York,'' she replied.
   ``I can be free, free, free'' here, she said.

   A U.S. congressman convicted of having sex
with a 16-year-old girl will run for re-election despite a call for
his resignation from a fellow representative, an aide said.
   Rep. Donald Lukens, R-Ohio, ``will be spending some quiet time,
speaking to family and friends to get a lot of opinion and advice.
But I'll say this, we will be running,'' said Lukens' chief of
staff, William Jarrell.
   Lukens was convicted Friday of contributing to the delinquency
and unruliness of a minor after a Franklin County Domestic Court
jury deliberated for an hour and a half. Lukens faces a maximum
sentence on the misdemeanor charge of 180 days in jail and a $1,000
fine.
   Within an hour after the conviction, the senior Republican of
Ohio's congressional delegation called for Lukens to step down.
   ``I think he should do the gentlemanly thing and resign,'' said
Rep. Chalmers Wylie.
   Lukens showed no expression during the reading of the verdict.
He declined comment before leaving the courthouse. Jarrell said
Lukens plans a statement next week.
   Lukens, 58, who is divorced, was indicted on Feb. 23 after a
Columbus television station broadcast a secretly recorded videotape
that apparently showed Lukens offering to find the girl's mother a
job.
   The charge stemmed from an Nov. 6 incident at Lukens' apartment
in which 16-year-old Rosie Coffman was paid $40 to have sex him.
   Neither Miss Coffman nor her mother, Anna Coffman, was in the
courtroom when the verdict was read. Mrs. Coffman also testified.
   Mrs. Coffman, Lukens' chief accuser, testified that Lukens
offered to find her a government job after she accused him of
having sex with her daughter. The meeting between Lukens and Mrs.
Coffman at a Columbus fast-food restaurant on Nov. 11, 1988, was
videotaped by television station WSYX. Mrs. Coffman had called the
station with her story.
   Miss Coffman said she was pleased with the verdict.
   ``I'm happy to see justice is done,'' she said.
   Lukens' attorney, Thomas Tyack, said Lukens will appeal the
verdict.
   Sentencing was delayed pending completion of a presentence
investigation.

<HEAD>Two Children Caught Burglarizing Apartment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTMINSTER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 5-year-old girl and her 4-year-old
brother allegedly broke into an apartment and filled a grocery cart
with jewelry, cash a camera and some food, police said.
   Westminster police officer Paul Newton said the manager of the
suburban Denver apartments caught the children and detained them
until police arrived.
   The children are from Denver and were visiting their
grandmother, who lives in a nearby apartment building, Newton said.
They were released to their grandmother and a report of the
incident was sent to the Adams County Social Services Department,
he said.
   The children gained access to the apartment by removing a window
screen and opening an unlocked window. They apparently made several
trips and filled the grocery cart, which they had parked nearby,
police said.

<HEAD>New Collectors' Item? _ Quarters With No Mint Mark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coin experts say some 1989 quarters could be
worth hundreds of dollars because the U.S. Mint unwittingly struck
an unknown number of them with no mint mark.
   Readers of the Numismatic News, a weekly coin collector's
publication based in Iola, Wis., sent in two 1989 quarters missing
the mint mark, The New York Times reported today.
   A spokesman for Stack's, a New York coin dealer, said the 1989
quarter could be worth $250 to $1,000, based on prices of other
coins with similar errors.
   All of the 605.9 million 1989 quarters already minted should
bear a mark just to the right of the George Washington's head that
tells where the coin was minted. A ``P'' indicates the mint at
Philadelphia and a ``D'' the Denver mint. Quarters minted in
Philadelphia before 1980 do not have a mint mark.
   The first quarter sent to Numismatic News also had the second 9
in 1989 partly erased.
   Eugene H. Essner, the deputy director of the U.S. Mint, analyzed
the first quarter and confirmed that it was genuine. If it had been
tampered with in an effort to remove the mark, a microscopic
inspection would show signs of metal deformation, he said.
   The last such error with a mint mark came on some 1982 dimes,
which are now worth about $140 each.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from the mid-Atlantic
states across Kentucky and the lower Mississippi Valley to parts of
the southern Plains early today, while earlier flooding in Ohio
left one child dead.
   A one-lane bridge carrying U.S. 52 over the rain-swollen Great
Miami River at Miamitown, 10 miles west of Cincinnati, collapsed
Friday. Two cars were swept into the river, and all the occupants
were feared dead. Police did not know how many people were in the
vehicles.
   Earlier Friday, rescuers in Camden, Ohio, used lifelines and
boats to lead 30 occupants of a trailer park through chest-high
water to safety. A total of 200 people were forced from their homes
in the town southwest of Dayton.
   A 20-month-old drowned in Donnels Creek near Dayton, the
sheriff's department said.
   Flood warnings were posted for four rivers in Indiana. The
Maumee River was expected to crest 6 feet above flood stage at Fort
Wayne tonight.
   Thunderstorms Friday evening produced damaging winds and large
hail in Tennessee, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Texas.
   A tornado caused minor injuries at Sevierville in eastern
Tennessee. In western Texas, golf ball-size hail pounded McCamey
and walnut-size hail fell near Bakersfield. Hail also fell in parts
of Oklahoma.
   Elsewhere, showers were scattered over northern Maine and the
northern Pacific Coast.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT
included nearly an inch at Jackson, Tenn.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
over Mississippi, Georgia and the middle Atlantic Coast; widely
scattered showers over the northern Atlantic Coast and the Pacific
Northwest; and showers and a few thunderstorms in Idaho, Montana,
northeast Wyoming and western South Dakota.
   Highs were expected to be in the 50s and 60s along much of the
California coast and in the Pacific Northwest, the northern Rockies
and the Great Lakes; in the 90s in southeastern North Carolina,
Florida, southern Louisiana and southern Texas; in the 100s in the
desert Southwest and the Rio Grande Valley in Texas; and in the 70s
and 80s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 31
degrees at Hibbing, Minn., to 84 degrees at Del Rio, Texas, and
Phoenix.

   House Majority Leader Tom Foley, the
likely successor to embattled Speaker Jim Wright's post, said the
looming departure of the No. 3 House Democrat will be ``a loss for
the House of Representatives.''
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho has ``had a brilliant record as
chairman of the campaign committee and as the party whip, and I
think he'll be deeply missed by his colleagues and by the
constituents he served so well,'' Foley said of the California
Democrat.
   Coelho told colleagues late Friday that he intends to resign
from Congress next month rather than endure a protracted ethics
investigation. Coelho has come under criticism for his personal
business dealings, particularly the handling of a $100,000
investment in junk bonds.
   Coelho's decision added a new element of uncertainty to the
future makeup of the House leadership. Wright, embroiled in an
ethics controversy of his own, is widely expected to give up his
post next week, and Foley is the favorite to replace him. Coelho
had been expected to be a candidate to replace Foley as majority
leader.
   Foley, a 13-term congressman, declined Friday to answer
questions or speculate on whether he would succeed Wright, should
the Texan resign the speakership.
   Foley said telephone calls and letters from constituents ``are
overwhelmingly about other things,'' such as health care, gun
control and issues other than the ethics controversy.
   Foley repeated that he knew of no plan for Wright to step down
nor any deal in the works that would allow him to do so.

<HEAD>Reports: Takeshita To Back Foreign Minister As Successor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who says he will
resign to take responsibility for an influence-peddling scandal,
has decided to back Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno as his successor,
news reports said today.
   Nearly all major newspapers carried front-page reports of
Takeshita choosing to support Uno, although most said the situation
remained fluid.
   Uno's appointment would fill a leadership vacuum that has
plagued the governing Liberal Democratic Party since Takeshita
announced last month that he would resign. Many party members
previously mentioned as potential successors were believed tainted
by the scandal.
   Takeshita was believed to have discussed the succession problem
today with party Secretary General Shintaro Abe at a Tokyo
hospital, where Abe is recovering from surgery.
   Takeshita told reporters a choice would not be made until late
next week following discussions with other party elders, Kyodo News
Service and other news reports said.
   Party leaders said Uno emerged as the top contender after talks
on Friday between Takeshita and Masayoshi Ito, chairman of the
Liberal Democrats' policy-making Executive Council, according to
the Asahi, Yomiuri and Mainichi newspapers.
   Uno, 66, a 10-term member of the powerful lower house of
Parliament and foreign minister since 1987, also has held the
international trade and industry portfolio and served as party
deputy secretary general.
   ``We haven't received any word from Tokyo,'' an official at
Uno's office in Moriyama in western Japan said on condition of
anonymity.
   A spokesman for Takeshita refused to comment.
   A Foreign Ministry official said Uno was to leave Sunday for
Paris to attend a meeting of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. He is to return June 4.
   Party leaders reportedly favor Uno because he has experience in
foreign affairs and apparently is untainted by the Recruit bribery
scandal, which already has led to more than a dozen arrests.
   Uno faces some opposition, however, because he is a leading
member of the Liberal Democratic faction headed by Takeshita's
predecessor, Yasuhiro Nakasone, who testified before parliament
this week about his links to the scandal.
   The Recruit Co., the publishing and information services
conglomerate at the center of the scandal, is accused of trying to
influence government policy by selling underpriced, unlisted shares
in a real estate subsidiary and by doling out millions of dollars
in political contributions.
   The scandal has led to the downfall of three Cabinet ministers
and the arrest of a former chief Cabinet secretary.
   Many governing party members have called it the worst crisis
since the party was founded 34 years ago.
   In the meeting with Ito on Friday, Takeshita agreed to stay on
as prime minister until a successor is found, although on April 25
he vowed to leave when the year's budget cleared parliament. The
budget is due to become law on Sunday.
   The head of the governing party routinely serves as prime
minister because of the party's large majority in both houses of
parliament.
   Ito's refusal May 13 to take the top job created a leadership
vacuum in a governing party desperately in need of a leader with a
clean enough reputation to steer the party out of scandal.

<HEAD>Investigators Focus on Dents in Fuel Pipeline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials investigating a pipeline
explosion that killed at least two people are focusing on dents
that were not discovered in a check of the line made after a train
derailment two weeks earlier.
   Meanwhile, many residents evacuated from the neighborhood on
Thursday were expected to be allowed to return home today. Few
among the estimated 96 displaced families voiced much willingness
to do so.
   ``They told us the gas line was no danger, but you can see for
yourself that this place looks like a bomb exploded,'' said George
Liti, 54, whose 9-year-old son suffered burns in the fire. ``None
of us can ever forget.''
   The pipeline fire destroyed 10 houses across the street from the
vacant lots left after the freight train derailed two weeks ago.
That accident killed four people and destroyed six houses.
   Heavy pieces of debris from the May 12 freight train wreck were
found embedded around the 14-inch diameter line, the closest about
15 inches away, federal investigators announced Friday.
   Federal investigators could not say if the metal fragments found
near the line had caused the rupture, said Jim Kolstad, acting
chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board.
   Surface dents on the steel pipeline range up to about 30 inches
long and 4 inches wide, Kolstad said. The section bearing the
30-inch by 4-inch rupture was being removed for laboratory tests in
Washington.
   A section of the damaged line that was excavated revealed a
blown-out hole, with a dent directly across the gash.
   David Andries, operations manager of Calnev Pipe Line Co., owner
of the line, said the section of pipe where the rupture occurred
wasn't excavated in spot checks of the line for damage caused by
the wreck.
   Instead, holes were dug every 50 feet along the 2,000-foot
stretch of track involved in the derailment to check for damage, he
said. Two larger areas were excavated, including one spot where a
locomotive dug into the ground.
   The fire that raged all day Thursday as unleaded gasoline gushed
from the pipe was so intense that it has been difficult to
identify, or even count, the dead, authorities said.
   The San Bernardino County Coroner's office has identified only
one of the victims so far _ Darie Lee Brown, 54.

   Teamsters international Vice President Harold
Friedman has been fined $35,000 and sentenced to four years of
probation for arranging a ``ghost employee'' scheme in which people
received union pay for little or no work.
   U.S. District Court Judge George W. White also Friday granted
Friedman's request to retain his various union leadership positions
pending an appeal of his conviction on embezzlement and
racketeering charges to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Cincinnati.
   Friedman, 66, held a finger to his lips while White announced
the sentence. The Teamsters official then turned and smiled at
friends and relatives who applauded the sentence.
   Friedman could have been sentenced to 52 years in prison and
fined $70,000.
   A co-defendant, Anthony Hughes, was fined $30,000 and also was
put on probation for four years. He faced a possible 45-year prison
term and $60,000 fine.
   ``Justice really prevailed,'' Hughes said after the sentencing.
``Our appeal will be better.''
   Stephen Jigger, a government prosecutor, declined to comment
after the sentencing. He had asked White to impose a
``substantial'' sentence, saying, ``Harold Friedman abused his
position of trust.''
   Friedman was a longtime ally of former Teamsters international
President Jackie Presser, who had been indicted in the same case
but died before going on trial.
   Friedman and his attorney, Paul Cambria of Buffalo, N.Y., made
an impassioned appeal during a two-hour morning hearing, asking
White to avoid imposing a prison term and to allow Friedman to keep
his union jobs pending appeal.
   Friedman also serves as president of the Ohio Council of
Teamsters, Teamsters Joint Council 41 in northeast Ohio, Teamsters
Local 507 and Bakery Workers Local 19.
   ``I don't believe I did anything dishonest,'' Friedman said.
   Friedman was convicted Jan. 13 of two counts of labor
racketeering, one count of embezzlement and one count of filing
false reports. He was acquitted of one count of embezzlement and
one count of filing false reports.
   Hughes, 52, secretary-treasurer of Local 507, was found guilty
of all charges against him _ two counts of labor racketeering and
one of embezzlement. He was convicted of being a ``ghost employee''
who did no work for the Teamsters union.

   The government deployed 7,000 riot
police in central Seoul today to block a protest by dissidents
calling for the fall of President Roh Tae-woo. Troopers arrested
more than 500 people.
   Hundreds of troopers in green combat fatigues with shields
blocked off the park where the rally was to be held. Others guarded
main streets, subway stations and government buildings to prevent
protests.
   Several hundred people tried to stage protests or march downtown
after being blocked from assembling at the rally site. Bands of
radical students who tried to march in the center of the city were
dragged away by police after they laid down in the middle of the
road.
   Troopers stopped and questioned people, searched bags and took
away suspects for further questioning. Police officials said more
than 500 people were arrested.
   It was the second Saturday in a row that the government blocked
a protest in Seoul with a massive show of police strength. Few
people responded to widespread appeals by dissidents to take part
in the protests.
   Dissidents and radical students have little public support
because of their violent tactics and extremist views. Opposition to
the dissidents has increased since seven riot troopers were killed
by radical students earlier this month.
   The United National Democratic Movement, the main dissident
alliance which called for protests in Seoul and 10 other cities,
had predicted up to 100,000 people would demonstrate nationwide.
The only other reported protest involved about 2,000 people in the
southern city of Kwangju.
   About 300 radical students continued a hunger protest for a
second day at Myongdong Roman Catholic Cathedral in the city center
today to demand the fall of Roh and a government admission that
police killed a radical student. Riot police ringed the cathedral
but made no move to stop the protest.
   Some of the hunger strikers bit their fingers to draw blood,
with which they wrote anti-government slogans.
   About 500 students were blocked by riot police when they
attempted to march out of Yonsei University in western Seoul.
Students pushed and hit police with sticks, but were not able to
break through lines of troopers with interlocked shields.
   ``Bury Roh Tae-woo!'' students shouted.
   Dissidents are demanding an investigation into the death of Lee
Chol-kyu, who they claim was tortured and killed by police. His
body was found in a reservoir May 10 near the southern city of
Kwangju.
   The government says police chased Lee after stopping him at a
roadblock, but deny any official involvement in the death. The
government says an autopsy shows Lee drowned, and officials
speculate he fell into the reservoir and drowned by accident.

   Federal officials refused to discuss a
broadcast report that a federal grand jury is investigating
allegations of Clean Water Act violations in the Exxon Valdez oil
spill.
   ``Obviously, one method of investigating would be a grand
jury,'' U.S. Attorney Michael Spaan said Friday. He would not
elaborate in response to questions about the ABC News report.
   Tom Matthews, the FBI's assistant special agent in charge in
Anchorage, said he could ``neither confirm nor deny the workings of
a grand jury.''
   In March, FBI spokesman Bill Carter in Washington said the
agency was focusing on possible felony violations of the Clean
Water Act.
   The FBI said its investigation into the March 24 spill of nearly
11 million gallons of crude oil was continuing in cooperation with
a number of agencies, among them the Coast Guard, the U.S. Fish &amp;
Wildlife Service and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
   The Clean Water Act prohibits the willful or negligent discharge
of oil into navigable waters, said Carl Lautenberger, an
environmental protection specialist for the EPA in Anchorage.
   ``The whole jurisdiction for us to write regulations ... to
assess penalities and fines'' is packaged in the act, he said.
   ``It gives federal agencies the jurisdiction to do what they
do.''
   Matthews said the FBI's investigation will be lengthy. He said
he could not specify a time frame.
   ``We're just beginning, really,'' he said.
   Exxon has taken responsibility for the damage that occurred when
its tanker hit a charted reef in Prince William Sound, but has
insisted the company was not negligent in its safety precautions.

<HEAD>Wall Street's Hope for Summer: Easier Credit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hopes are spreading on Wall Street that
investors will get invited to a financial party this summer catered
by the Federal Reserve.
   The festivities would have a simple theme: Lower interest rates
and higher stock prices, courtesy of an easier credit policy from
the Fed.
   Talk of such a celebration has been increasing for some time
now, ever since signs began to show up that the economy was
beginning to slow.
   Inflation, the target of the Fed's long credit-tightening
campaign from early 1988 through the first couple of months of this
year, hasn't been quite so cooperative.
   To judge from the latest readings, it's still running at a 5
percent to 6 percent annual rate that government officials, and a
good many other observers, consider troublesome.
   But optimists in the financial world still seem willing to bet
that a slower pace of business will sooner or later ease upward
pressure on the cost of living.
   Conjecture about a change of course at the Fed has also been
fanned lately by the sharp rise of the dollar in foreign exchange.
   Presumably, a sustained advance in the dollar would be unwelcome
in policymaking circles, because it would threaten to reverse the
difficult progress that has been made toward shrinking the nation's
trade deficit.
   So far, efforts to keep the dollar stable have consisted mainly
of intervention by the Fed and other banks in the foreign exchange
markets.
   If that proves insufficient, the reasoning goes, the Fed might
want to lower interest rates in this country to reduce the flow of
international funds into dollars.
   For the moment, the dollar's strength seems to have worked in
the U.S. markets' favor.
   ``Whether this marks a major turn in the dollar remains to be
seen,'' said Martin Zweig in his investment advisory letter The
Zweig Forecast.
   ``However, in recent days there has been a sharp pickup in
foreign demand for U.S. stocks as those abroad fear they may miss
the boat on the dollar.''
   The 6-month-old rally in stock prices leveled off in the past
week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had climbed
119.14 points over the two preceding weeks, slipped back 7.33 to
2,493.77.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index edged up .39 to
179.31; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
rose 3.16 to 445.21, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up 1.18 at 355.01.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 169.79 million shares a day,
against 192.71 million the week before.
   As popular as it may have become, the belief that the Fed is
succeeding in curbing inflation without tipping the economy into a
recession is not yet universally embraced on Wall Street.
   ``To an economist, the main problem with the soft landing
hypothesis is that it is hard to understand the practical mechanics
of slowing growth enough to lower inflation without creating the
stress of a recession first,'' said Robert Brusca at Nikko
Securities International.
   ``In fact, our experience with such happy events is almost
completely lacking.''
   Said Hugh Johnson at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y., ``the
trend in stock and bond prices is positive. This is being driven by
some measure of speculation in the dollar, which has been
transmitted to our stock and bond markets. This can change.
   ``The current forecast of a soft landing, which is driving the
dollar and the stock and bond markets, may change. It may change at
a time when the stock market is perhaps `overvalued,' and therefore
vulnerable.''

   Here is the text of a statement issued today
by Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., announcing his resignation as House
majority whip and from Congress:
   For nearly 25 years, I have devoted my life to public service --
first as a congressional staffer, then as congressman, campaign
committee chair, and majority whip. All that time, I have worked
for social change, for wider acceptance of the disabled, for the
interests of my district, and to serve the Democratic Party.
   In recent weeks, my ability to complete those missions has been
diminished by needless and baseless charges about my investments or
private life. I have simply spent too much time building the party
and trying to help people to have my attention or abilities devoted
to such distractions.
   Accordingly, I will not seek the office of majority leader.
Instead, I will tender my resignation as majority whip, and will
also resign my seat in Congress _ on my (47th) birthday _ June 15th.
   All week, my colleagues have expressed their confidence in me
and their support for a leader's race. I would have preferred to
land in that race with both feet, and would have had the votes to
win. Moreover, my attorneys remain convinced that a normal business
transaction, admittedly marred by reporting errors, posed no legal
problems for me, and I accept their advice.
   Undoubtedly, some will think this decision was motivated by
weakness in my political standing or my legal position. They are
entitled to their opinion, but they are wrong.
   I want to thank my family, my party and colleagues, my country
and especially my constituents for all the opportunities I have
enjoyed. I particularly want to thank the community of the disabled
for all the strength they've given my for so many years.
   While I will no longer be working in the Congress, Phyllis, my
daughters and I look forward to conquering new horizons. I always
have, and we always will.

   Leaders of China's student protest movement
proposed today that thousands of demonstrators hold a final rally
next week and then end their two-week occupation of Tiananmen
Square.
   Also today, in the first official acknowledgement of a power
struggle at the top, China's former President Li Xiannian accused
``certain people in the leadership of the Communist Party'' of
creating confusion in China.
   The statement, broadcast on state-run radio and television, came
two days after Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang was reportedly
stripped of power and placed under house arrest for apparently
being too sympathetic to the protesters' demands for democratic
reforms.
   Student leaders Wang Dan, Wu'er Kaixi and Chai Ling, at a news
conference on the square, called for a citywide march and mass
rally on Tuesday after which students would leave the square.
   The three, the top leaders of the uprising, said they wanted to
leave the square because of ``sanitation and to return the square
to the people.''
   They demanded an end to martial law ordered for parts of Beijing
on May 20 by Premier Li Peng and the withdrawal of the tens of
thousands of army troops surrounding the capital.
   The student leaders said the approximately 10,000 students
remaining in the square would make the final decision on whether to
leave. They said student representatives would begin tonight
meeting with groups of students to reach a final decision on
whether to end the Beijing protest.
   They also called for April 27 to be made into a holiday for
freedom and democracy. On that date, hundreds of thousands of
students and workers took to the streets in Beijing to protest a
People's Daily editorial accusing the student movement of causing
turmoil.
   Yang Jianjun, a junior at Liaoning Fuxing Institute of Mining
and Technology in northeastern China, said the activism displayed
in Chinese cities should be brought to rural areas.
   Yang, who was at the Beijing train station to return home today,
also said: ``The conditions are really bad at the square. A lot of
people are tired of living out there.''
   Students began leading organized demonstrations on April 15 to
demand talks with officials on democratic reforms and ending
corruption and profiteering by party officials.
   The rallies gradually escalated, drawing many verage citizens,
and culminated with the occupation of the square by hundreds of
thousands and a hunger strike by 3,000 students in Tiananmen Square
on May 13, two days before Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
historic visit to China.
   At times a million people swarmed through the square and city.
Li declared martial law on May 20, but soldiers either were
reluctant or unable to move against the jubiliant masses.
   The protests caused a power struggle between more moderate
leaders and hardliners, with Li apparently emerged victorious.
   The student leaders did not mention another march, planned for
Sunday, in Beijing. Student activists in Beijing had called for a
worldwide march of ethnic Chinese and a citywide strike in Beijing.
   Most people do not work in China on Sunday.
   In a shrill speech, former President Li Xiannian also was quoted
as urging a crackdown on a small band of criminals who, he said,
were trying to overthrow the rule of the Communist Party.
   ``These people have an organization, a plan and a plot,'' he
said. ``If they succeed China will be thrown into a deep disaster.''
   In another blow to the moderate faction led by Zhao, Wan Li,
chairman of the standing committee of the National People's
Congress, threw his support to Premier Li and other conservatives
who ordered martial law.
   Wan, a moderate, cut short his visit to the United States
earlier this week and was initially reported to be placed under
house arrest on his arrival in Shanghai Tuesday. His statement
today, also read on state-run radio and television, indicated that
whatever help he could have provided Zhao had been neutralized by
conservatives.
   ``After I had time to study the situation,'' Wan was quoted as
saying, ``I realized that a small minority was behind a plot to
cause turmoil in society.''
   Wan said he would call a meeting of the National People's
Congress around June 20 to discuss some of the student's demands,
including their opposition to corruption. But, he said, changes
must come ``slowly because society is very complex.''
   Li Xiannian, in his speech to the Chinese Political Consultative
Conference, said part of the current ``disturbances'' were caused
by the fact that campaigns to fight ``bourgeois liberalization''
were not carried out fully. Hundreds of moderate intellectuals were
criticized in the 1987 campaign. Books and movies were banned and
press censorship was tightened.
   Another reason, he said, was the activities of ``certain people
in the leadership of the Communist Party.'' The reference appeared
to be to Zhao.
   Signs that the military, blocked so far by popular resistance,
might move soon to end the students' two-week occupation of the
square were growing.
   Plainclothes officers, wearing military pants, were seen
strolling in pairs around the square this morning.
   Long lines of students formed at the Beijing railway station
waiting for trains to the provinces. Student broadcasts, quoting
railway officials, said 26,000 left Beijing on Thursday and that
the number of departures was growing.
   The government has given students priority in getting tickets to
expedite their departure from the city.
   Smaller numbers of students continued to arrive in the capital
despite a State Council order issued Thursday that students be
prevented from boarding trains for Beijing.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>

   Israeli troops shot and killed a guerrilla
today after he opened fire from the Jordanian side of the border,
the army said. Two soldiers were slightly wounded, it said.
   Jordan, in an official broadcast, suggested the attacker was a
distraught Jordanian soldier who had abandoned his observation post
at the border.
   The attack occurred about 6:30 a.m. near the kibbutz, or
communal settlement, of Hamadiya, the military command said.
Hamadiya is 50 miles northeast of Jerusalem.
   The Israeli army said one of its patrols near a border fence
``encountered light weapons fire from east of the fence'' and
returned fire.
   Soldiers searched the area after the firefight and found the
body of a guerrilla dressed in a military-type uniform and armed
with the U.S.-made, M-16 assault rifle, an army spokesman said.
   The body was found on the Jordanian side of the border, he said.
   Although the army identified the attacker as a guerrilla, the
state-run Jordan Radio quoted an official source as suggesting the
attacker was a Jordanian army soldier.
   ``An official source said today that at 6:30 a.m. the conscript
Issa Mahmoud Ahmad, carrying his gun, abandoned his observation
post at the border,'' the broadcast said.
   ``During search operations for the absent conscript, the sound
of shooting was heard in the Zor Abdullah area northwest of Waqqas
village,'' it said. Waqqas is close to the site of the clash as
given by the Israeli army.
   The Jordanian official was quoted as saying Ahmad ``suffers from
psychological trouble...(and) is still absent.''
   Israel radio gave a different version of the clash, saying that
an army scout was the first to open fire when he heard a noise on
the other side of the border. It said the scout was wounded in the
firefight.
   It was the third infiltration attempt or attack from Jordan
since May 1988.
   ``We have an impression that this is not a new step or a new
direction,'' Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, the head of the army's central
command, told Israel radio in an interview from the site of the
clash.
   ``We see that the Jordanians are making every effort and use all
the means to keep this border secure and closed.''
   In previous cases, Mitzna said, the guerrillas ``succeeded in
sneaking by the Jordanian patrols. This case is still unclear. We
don't know who this man is, where he left from, who sent him and
how he came here.''
   ``We should remember that although Jordan is really trying to
prevent such activity, there is no substitute to our own forces,''
Mitzna said.

<HEAD>Arab Summit Causes Few Ripples in Beirut</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian gunners shelled the Christian
coastline north of Beirut today despite an appeal by Arab leaders
for a cease-fire.
   A dozen 130mm howitzer shells fired by Syrian gunners from a
battery in Moslem west Beirut slammed into the coast near the
Christian ports of Jounieh and Byblos, a police spokesman said. No
casualties were reported, he said.
   Arab leaders ended a summit in Casablanca, Morocco, on Friday
without a blueprint for solving Lebanon's 14-year civil war or the
recent fighting between Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly Christian troops
and his Syrian-Druse foes.
   Fighting broke out again March 8 when Aoun's troops blockaded
illegal Druse-run ports, and the Moslem alliance responded by
shelling the 310-square-mile Christian enclave. Several cease-fires
declared by the Arab League have failed.
   The Arab leaders were unable during their summit to reach an
agreement on proposals to form an observer force for Lebanon.
   Instead, they created a committee of Morocco's King Hassan II,
Saudi monarch King Fahd and Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid to
set up a workable cease-fire over the next six months.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, who attended the summit,
reported a ``gentleman's agreement'' had been reached calling for
Syria to withdraw its 45,000 troops from Leganon, but there was no
sign it would be honored.
   The committee also is to hammer out a new constitution for
Lebanon.
   Salim Hoss, who heads the Moslem cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government, was quick to support the summit's resolutions.
   ``I welcome the resolutions of the Arab summit and hope they
will be implemented as soon as possible,'' he said in a statement
released Friday.
   Aoun, who heads the Christian cabinet, has not announced his
position. But the Christian militia was apparently disappointed
because the resolutions did not call openly for the withdrawal of
Syria's troops.
   Aoun and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of failing
to adhere a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League by
siding with the Moslems against the Christians in the civil war.

   The town's only police officer was suspended
without pay after being arrested on a burglary charge.
   ``We thought he was doing an excellent job. The whole town
thought he was doing an excellent job,'' Mayor Gary Black said. ``I

   Sid Glenn, 24, was arrested Thursday by the Georgia Bureau of

have been taken in a recent burglary of an Arcade business, bureau
spokesman John Bankhead said.
   Glenn, a patrol officer for the town for about a year, posted
bond Friday and was released from the county jail.
   The north Georgia town, population about 500, used to have two
officers, but the other retired recently, Black said. The Jackson
County Sheriff's Department has agreed to provide an officer until
a replacement can be found.

<HEAD>Back at Home, Grounded Red Square Pilot Turns Equestrian</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEDEL, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years after his flight to Red
Square triggered a Kremlin shake-up and drew a Soviet prison
sentence, Mathias Rust's interests are more down to earth. He rides
a horse.
   Back at home in this Hamburg suburb, life is nearly back to
normal for the West German youth who thought his May 28, 1987 stunt
would earn him a meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The crew cut he wore upon release from Moscow's Lefortovo Prison
in August has grown back, as has the grass around his family's
brick apartment house after repeated trampling by journalists and
curiosity seekers.
   But Rust, now 21, has had to change roles from aviator to
equestrian, as local authorities refuse to reinstate his pilot's
license.
   ``I don't like places where there are so many people on so
little space,'' said Rust, seated primly in the tiny dining alcove
cluttered with memorabilia from his moments in the limelight.
``That's why I bought my horse, to get away while I'm not able to
fly.''
   The 8-year-old black mare, Torina, is a champion jumper and was
bought with money Stern magazine paid Rust's family for the rights
to their story.
   The West German press labeled Rust ``the daredevil Kremlin
flier'' when at the age of 19 he flew a single-engine Cessna
through heavily guarded air space and landed in Moscow's Red Square.
   The act was a prelude to the ouster of Soviet Defense Minister
Sergei L. Sokolov and Air Defense chief Alexander Koldunov, because
Soviet air defenses took no action to halt the flight.
   But despite self-confidence about his abilities as an aviator,
Rust is no adventurer and an unlikely hero.
   His political rationale for making the flight has done more to
perplex than impress those who initially took his flight as
reckless derring-do.
   ``It was my direct goal to speak to Gorbachev, to explain that
our people also want better relations. It was impossible at that
time in any other way, so I made the flight,'' Rust said.
   ``I do not regret the flight because in the end, this incident
helped to better relations between East and West and to clarify the
differences and similarities between our societies,'' the
bespectacled youth contended.
   He expresses ``disappointment'' that Gorbachev never granted him
an audience but harbors a hope of meeting him when he travels to
the Soviet Union as a tourist. He cannot get a visa, however, until
his four-year sentence expires in September 1991.
   Rust was convicted in Moscow on charges of violating
international air safety regulations, illegal entry into the Soviet
Union and malicious hooliganism. He was released in August on what
Soviet authorities said were humanitarian grounds.
   He initially faced charges in West Germany, but they were
dropped late last year by the Hamburg state prosecutor's office.
   The sole sanction still in force is the revoked pilot's license.
Rust expects to earn it back some day and fly for one of Hamburg's
air charter services.
   In the meantime, he is spending an idle summer at home with his
parents, Monika and Karl-Heinz, and his 17-year-old brother Ingo.
This fall he will enter the Civilian Service, the pacifist
alternative to West Germany's compulsory military term.
   Rust says his experience in Moscow, where he claims to have
befriended guards, prosecutors and KGB agents, solidified his
opposition to any use of armed force.
   He will instead serve his 20-month term at a local hospital and
get the training he needs to be a health care worker should the
much hoped-for pilot's license not materialize.
   The family's crowded four-room home has been transformed into a
shrine to Rust's crime.
   Photographs, newspaper clippings, artists' sketches and cartoons
lampooning his unauthorized flight from Helsinki to Moscow cover
much of the wall space in the dining and living rooms, as well as
over the bunk beds in what Mrs. Rust still calls ``the children's
room.''
   A poster of Gorbachev has stared across the entrance way since
the first of the family's seven trips to Moscow to visit the jailed
flier.
   Between rides on Torina, stabled at a farm four miles away, Rust
says he is at work on a book and a screenplay that would explain
his Moscow mission.
   The book, progressing slowly, is being penned by hand because
Rust says computers and typewriters are ``intimidating and
overrated.''
   He claims U.S. filmmakers have offered him as much as $500,000
for the movie rights to his story but that he has turned them down
because they would not allow him to write the script.
   His mother claims part of the responsibility for her son's
flight across heavily guarded Soviet territory, recalling how she
would sometimes dream aloud of a Western gesture of peace to the
new Kremlin leader.
   ``But these were just illusions,'' she said. ``I had no idea he
was planning such a thing.''
   Russ contends the idea was his alone and that its roots will
become clear in the book, which he hopes to release some time next
year.

   Eleven drug traffickers were hanged in
northwestern Iran on Saturday, bringing the number of drug-related
executions since January to 686, the official Iranian news agency
reported.
   The 11 were convicted of heroin trafficking and hanged in
Tabriz, 320 miles northwest of Tehran, according to the agency,
monitored in Nicosia. A total of 128 traffickers have been hanged
in the past two weeks.
   In January, the government implemented a new law that mandates
the death penalty for people found in possession of even small
amounts of narcotics.
   The government says 1 million of the 50 million population are
involved in drug abuse, but unofficial figures put the number at

   A bridge collapsed minutes after an engineer
recommended closing it, and the rain-swollen river below swept away
at least two vehicles. Flooding elsewhere in Ohio left two people
dead and hundreds out of their homes.
   Police could not say how many people were in the cars, which
plunged into the Great Miami River when a bridge near Miamitown
collapsed Friday evening. Rescuers resumed searching for victims
this morning, but could not enter the flooding river because of its
swift current.
   ``The car in front of us just dropped straight down,'' said
Sharon Boebinger, who was waiting to cross the bridge when it
started collapsing. ``I said, `Oh my God.' I put it in reverse and
backed up. I didn't feel the bridge shake at all. It just happened
in an instant.''
   Lt. Col. Ramon Hoffbauer of the Hamilton County sheriff's office
was asked if anyone could have survived the plunge.
   ``I wouldn't think so,'' he said. ``The current is moving pretty
fast. I can't tell you how fast, but the rescue crews didn't go
into the water at all.''
   The American Red Cross said it got more than a dozen missing
person calls, but Gary Miller, disaster services director, said
none of the missing could be confirmed as river victims.
   Officials said divers likely would have to wait for the water to
recede before going in.
   The collapse of the one-lane, temporary bridge carrying U.S. 52
over the Great Miami River at Miamitown, 10 miles west of
Cincinnati, occurred just 10 minutes after a Hamilton County
engineer had given an order to close the span.
   Widespread flooding in southwestern Ohio earlier Friday sent
people scurrying to rooftops and high ground.
   A couple and their 10-year-old son were stranded on the roof of
their house all day until rescuers reached them by boat, the Butler
County Sheriff's Department said.
   In Camden, rescuers used lifelines and boats to lead 30
occupants of a trailer park through chest-high water to safety. A
total of 200 people were forced from their homes in the town of
about 1,900 people southwest of Dayton.
   Divers recovered the body of 20-month-old Brandon K. Irwin of
Springfield in Donnels Creek, northeast of Dayton, the sheriff's
department said. The boy fell into the swollen creek from a
footbridge near his grandmother's house.
   In Findlay in northwest Ohio, Hancock County sheriff's deputies
recovered the body of Lisa Faust, 24, of Fostoria, from her
overturned car in the Portage River. The car was swept off a county
road by high water, hit a metal bridge abutment and overturned into
the river.
   At the site of the bridge collapse, witnesses gave varying
accounts of two to four vehicles falling into the river, said Bruce
Smith, chief of the Colerain Township Fire Department.
   Radio station WCKY reported at least six people were missing. An
adult and four children were seen in a yellow pickup truck and at
least one person in a car which went under the water, the station
said.
   William Brayshaw, the county's chief deputy engineer, had been
advised by the contractor, National Engineering Co. of
Strongsville, Ohio, that the river was washing tree trunks and
other heavy debris downstream.
   Engineers said the debris posed a threat to the steel beams
driven into bedrock under the river that supported the 300-foot
bridge.
   The temporary bridge had been in use for several months while a
new bridge was being built to replace a 94-year-old span, Brayshaw
said.
   Just as engineers were moving to barricade the bridge, a
100-foot section collapsed. Late Friday, three other bridges over
the Great Miami were closed.

percent are against Noriega,'' said Sgt. Feliciano Villanueva, a
combat medic.
   Villanueva, of Bayamon, P.R., and Brooklyn, is the old man of
the Latin Corner at 32, ``Papa'' to a group of eight sergeants from
Puerto Rico via New York City.
   ``We didn't bring any dominoes. They just packed us up with two
duffel bags and moved us out,'' said Sgt. Wilfredo Hernandez, of
Bayamon and the Bronx.
   Hernandez thinks he's solved the domino drought. He gave a
Panamanian woman some money to buy a set in town, where retired men
while away the hours at dominoes in the city parks.
   Some people lost more than dominoes in the move, said Boyd, who
tells of a buddy who was about to get married when the call came.
   ``He married Panama instead of the bride,'' said Boyd.
   ``I had a house closing, I left it all for my wife to do,'' said
Spec. 4 Ricky Zimmerman of Hoboken, N.J.
   Food? ``It's hamburgers in line A, chopped steak in Line B,''
joked one soldier. There were extra ribs Thursday night, but a lot
of people have to settle for MRE, or meals-ready-to-eat, like APC
driver McNamara's chicken in a blue plastic bag.
   Boyd is thinking of supplementing the diet with iguana or a
rat-like creature he saw in the jungle. ``I used to hunt a lot back
home,'' he said. ``And I've seen some big shrimp here.''
   The soldiers spend their spare time, what there is of it,
writing letters, because the telephone costs $11 to $15 for three
minutes.
   The rumor mill is churning all the time. Today the rumor is
it'll be a 45-day deployment. Yesterday, it was six months.
   When do they want to get out?
   ``It's hot, I'm ready now,'' said Boyd.
   July 4, says Zimmerman. That's when the New York Mets play the
Astros in Houston; he's a Mets fan, and Fort Polk is only three
hours away.
   July 21, says Colburn. That's his daughter Nikki Michelle's
sixth birthday.

<HEAD>Politics of Judicial Selection Heating Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The politics of judicial selection is heating
up in legal and legislative circles, just as President Bush
prepares to begin filling 46 vacancies on the federal bench.
   The 16 to 18 candidates expected to be nominated in June will
indicate whether Bush plans to extend the conservative control of
judicial appointments that began eight years ago.
   Bush has a chance to consolidate the conservative trend in
federal jurisprudence begun under President Reagan, who appointed
more than half of all federal judges currently sitting during his
eight years in office.
   The expected nomination of Clarence Thomas, a black conservative
who is chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
would signal just such a trend.
   Thomas is expected to be nominated to fill a vacancy created on
the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here by last year's resignation
of Robert Bork _ a martyr of the conservative movement's battle for
the federal judiciary.
   Conservatives are still seeing red over the Senate's 1987 vote
defeating Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court.
   Resentment by conservatives over Bork's defeat won't be hard to
detect this week at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the
American Bar Association's judicial screening role.
   Conservatives criticized the ABA's judicial panel after four of
its 15 members found Bork unqualified on the ground that his
``comparatively extreme views'' on constitutional principles would
affect his judicial temperament.
   Earlier this year, Bush submitted five nominations to the
Senate, but the candidates were chosen from the ranks of potential
judges left over from the Reagan administration.
   The final screening of the first crop of Bush's own judicial
nominees comes amid a dispute between Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh and the ABA over the group's role in judicial screening
and heightened concern about the issue on Capitol Hill.
   Thornburgh, ABA officials and representatives of other interest
groups are scheduled to testify at Friday's Senate Judiciary
Committee hearing.
   Conservatives and liberals alike have criticized the secret
process by which the ABA reviews judicial candidates and renders a
rating of the individual's qualifications before a nominee is
forwarded to the Senate.
   Conservatives accuse the ABA of giving low marks to candidates
because of their political views.
   Liberals like Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., the chairman of
the Judiciary Committee, are concerned about the ABA's practice of
not divulging the basis for holding a candidate unqualified for the
judiciary.
   Thornburgh's dispute with the ABA was born of an apparent
disagreement over discussions he and his aides had with bar
officials over changes in the ABA's guidelines on judicial
screening.
   Robert B. Fiske Jr., the attorney general's choice to be the No.
2 Justice Department official, has become embroiled in the
controversy.
   Conservative critics hold Fiske, who chaired the ABA's Standing
Committee on Federal Judiciary from 1984 to 1987, responsible for
what they regard as the panel's ideological and political bias
against Reagan appointees to the courts.
   A month after Thornburgh confidently told the House Judiciary
Committee that the ABA had agreed not to evaluate a candidate's
political or ideological beliefs, the attorney general is still
trying to resolve the issue.
   The ABA said it made no such agreement, denying it had ever
considered politics or ideology in assessing a candidate's
professional qualifications.
   Thornburgh threatened to cut the ABA out of the judicial
screening process unless it abided by the agreement he insisted he
had obtained.
   The ABA then offered to drop a sentence from its guidelines
stating that ideological and political beliefs are not examined
except to the extent they may bear on other qualifications, notably
judicial temperament.
   Thornburgh's spokesman, David Runkel, said this is an acceptable
solution, but it might not satisfy conservative critics.
   ``I can't believe they are putting that forward as an honest
proposal,'' said Daniel L. Casey, head of the American Conservative
Union.
   Deleting the sentence prohibiting consideration of political
beliefs ``would give them carte blanche to do it because it's not
expressly forbidden as it was before.''
   The discussions between the ABA and Thornburgh are continuing to
try to resolve one remaining obstacle to a joint statement.
   ``When you get more than one lawyer trying to get words down on
a piece of paper, you find controversy over words,'' Runkel said.
   What appears to be still at stake is the ABA's insistence that
it will not admit to ever having improperly having delved into a
candidate's political beliefs.
   At a briefing last week, Runkel conceded that Thornburgh could
not cite any examples of ideologically tainted ABA reviews.
   Signalling a slight retreat in the attorney general's position,
Runkel said Thornburgh ``has problems with the changes in the
language (in ABA guidelines) that have led to perception problems
with the ABA on how they reviewed judicial candidates.''

<HEAD>Health Care Issue Blocks Settlement as Midnight Deadline Nears</HEAD>

   AT&amp;T and its unions raced against the clock
today in hopes of negotiating new contracts before existing pacts
expire tonight, but a bitter dispute over medical benefits
threatened to block a settlement.
   ``There's a lot to be done and a lot of hard bargaining going
on,'' a company official said today shortly after the negotiators
returned to the bargaining table.
   It remained unclear whether the two sides could resolve their
differences over medical benefits, described by one source as ``the
major block to a settlement.'' Also up in the air was whether the
unions would immediately call a strike in the absence of a
settlement.
   After a long and frantic day of negotiating Friday, both sides
publicly continued to express hope of reaching new contracts before
existing pacts affecting about 160,000 workers expire at 11:59 p.m.
EDT. But they say such a development hinges on a major breakthrough
on the benefits package, which has dominated the talks from the
outset.
   ``If we can settle health care _ no easy task _ then we can
reach agreement on wages and the other issues,'' a union source
said late Friday. ``This is the major block to a settlement.''
   Sources close to the negotiations said progress has been made
but they cautioned that negotiations are at a fragile stage and
could turn for the worse. In an arrangement likely to be repeated
today, formal negotiating committees met Friday at a Washington
hotel while the two union presidents and AT&amp;T's top negotiator held
separate meetings periodically on the major issues.
   It remained unclear as the deadline approached whether the
unions would call a strike immediately if no agreement is reached.
Union officials have refused to disclose their plans but have
hinted strongly that they would not strike right away, particularly
if agreement on a contract appeared near.
   Instead, the unions have a number of other strategies designed
to pressure the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. into a
settlement, primarily a nationwide labor boycott of AT&amp;T
long-distance service that the unions contend could cut the
company's long-distance revenues by up to 8 percent.
   As two levels of negotiations continued late Friday, both sides
reported progress but said bitter union opposition to AT&amp;T's health
care proposal remained a substantial barrier to a settlement.
   The unions, the Communications Workers of America and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, vehemently oppose
AT&amp;T's demand that workers pay more up front for medical care. The
company says it needs to reduce its $1 billion annual medical bill,
but the unions have demanded expanded benefits while promising to
devise new cost-control measures.
   Hectic negotiations Friday were marked by repeated exchanges of
proposals and counter offers, including a significant AT&amp;T offer to
limit the use of temporary workers _ a key union job-security
demand.
   The sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said AT&amp;T
proposed in an informal meeting among top officials from both sides
to revise its health care package. Neither side would discuss
details. But a union official said, ``It was a reconfiguration of
the existing offer and it is unacceptable.''
   In addition to offering to regulate use of temporary workers,
AT&amp;T has amended and expanded its contract proposal to improve eye
and dental care and its parental leave policy, company officials
said. Also, it has proposed for the first time allowing leave for
workers to care for sick relatives.
   Those proposals are in addition to the formal offer the company
made Monday, a package which provided varying base wage increases
and lump sum payments depending on job classification and also a
new profit-sharing plan for union workers.

<HEAD>Nuclear Weapons Data Shared with France, Pentagon Confirms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States secretly has supplied France
with information about the design of nuclear weapons since 1972,
the Pentagon acknowledged, confirming a reported published Saturday.
   American officials previously acknowledged sharing nuclear
weapons information only with Britain, and ``U.S.-French nuclear
collaboration has ... been one of the most closely guarded secrets
of both governments,'' Princeton University professor Richard H.
Ullman wrote in the quarterly Foreign Policy.
   The exchange of data means that France is more closely
integrated than previously realized into the nuclear war plans of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the disclosure might
complicate efforts to negotiate a deal to sharply reduce U.S. and
Soviet strategic arsenals.
   ``It may be that public acknowledgement of the program of aid to
France, and particularly of coordination between U.S. and French
nuclear forces, would increase Soviet pressure for the inclusion of
French and British forces in any future strategic arms control
regime,'' wrote Ullman.
   The British nuclear arsenal, now being modernized, is slated to
consist of 500 warheads by the mid-1990s, and the French plan to
have about 1,000 warheads by early in the next century. The United
States and Soviet Union each have more than 11,000 strategic
warheads, and under the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
would cut that number to 6,000 apiece.
   The U.S. policy of sharing nuclear weapons data with the French
was initiated in 1972 by then President Richard M. Nixon and his
national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, as a means to draw the
French more closely into NATO, wrote Ullman. France left NATO's
integrated military structure in 1966, although it remains within
the alliance.
   Ullman concluded ``in the course of more than 100 interviews
over the past two years with top-level politicians, civil
servants'' and others involved in the program that since 1972, U.S.
experts have briefed their French counterparts on aspects of
nuclear weaponry including:
   _Penetration of Soviet defenses.
   _Miniaturization of warhead components to allow development of
Multiple Independently Targeted Re-Entry Vehicles.
   _Guidance and propulsion systems, including the chemistry of
solid fuels for rocket engines.
   Moreover, the two sides have shared targeting information about
the Soviet Union to ensure that the French and U.S. nuclear bombs
do not interfere with one another, Ullman wrote.
   ``The assistance almost certainly has violated U.S. law,''
Ullman wrote.
   The Pentagon acknowledged some aspects of Ullman's article, but
denied that the data exchange was illegal and declined to discuss
details.
   The United States ``has cooperated with France in improving the
operational effectiveness and survivability of its strategic
missile systems, including supporting command and control
systems,'' said a Pentagon spokesman, reading a statement he said
had been cleared by the French government and the White House.
   ``There have been several meetings involving U.S. and French
technicians every year since 1972 under the terms of the 1961
agreement'' on nuclear cooperation, said the spokesman, who spoke
on condition that he not be further identified.
   That agreement was amended in 1985 to provide for the exchange
of classified or ``restricted data ... The 1961 agreement provided
the basis for the exchange of nuclear weapons information related
to military operational requirements,'' said the spokesman.
   ``The amended agreement allows certain classified exchanges,
focused on enhancing the safety, security, and reliability of
nuclear activities and installations,'' said the Pentagon statement.
   The picture that emerged from Ullman's article and the Pentagon
statement was of an information exchange that at first was heavily
in favor of the French, but which in recent years has become more
balanced.
   ``The French nuclear program has reached a technical maturity
which approaches our own,'' the statement said. ``The French force
contributes effectively to Western deterrence.''
   ``Exchanges were aimed at improving our mutual understanding of
technologies related to nuclear safety,'' the Pentagon statement
said. ``More recently we discussed measures to deal with nuclear
weapons accidents. Exchanges facilitated efforts from both sides to
make their nuclear weapons safe.''
   ``The transfer of nuclear weapons, nuclear components of
weapons, source or special nuclear material is not authorized by
this agreement,'' he said.
   As required by law, the Senate and House Foreign Relations and
Armed Services Committees and senior congressional leaders were
informed of the 1985 amendment to the 1961 agreement, and the
exchange of information was fully legal, the statement said. The
amendment did not require Senate ratification, it said.
   Congress was in recess over the Memorial Day weekend and it was
impossible to determine the extent of congressional knowledge of
the nuclear data exchange. Senior congressional aides said they
were unaware of details of the agreement, but that it might have
been so secret that they were not informed.
   Ullman wrote that the 1985 amendment ``seems to have gone
unnoticed by anyone outside the nuclear weapons establishments of
both countries.''

   Anti-NATO protesters clashed with riot
police Saturday while a flotilla of allied warships passed by
during celebrations of Armed Forces Day.
   Crews of the 29 NATO warships saluted King Juan Carlos, who
reviewed the flotilla from the Spanish navy frigate Victoria.
   On shore, protesters threw rocks at guards, knocked down
security barriers and overturned garbage containers, police said.
Some protesters tried to set fire to cars, they said.
   Riot police dispersed the group with truncheons, and some
protesters were slightly injured, police said. No arrests were
reported.
   Earlier, several hundred demonstrators peacefully linked arms in
the port area to protest the naval review.
   Protesters are demanding that Spain withdraw from the 16-member
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and that the ships leave
Barcelona. The Spanish chapter of Greenpeace has said some of the
ships are equipped to carry nuclear weapons.
   The flotilla included the new Spanish navy aircraft carrier
Principe de Asturias and the U.S. Navy warship Belknap. Other ships
were from the navies of West Germany, Britain, Belgium, France, the
Netherlands, Italy, Portugal and Greece.
   It was the largest flotilla of allied warships in Barcelona in
60 years.
   The largest previous naval review in Barcelona took place in
1929 when King Juan Carlos' grandfather, King Alfonso XIII,
observed a flotilla of Western warships in Barcelona's port, city
officials said.

   Thousands of riot police blocked a
protest rally Saturday by dissidents calling for the overthrow of
President Roh Tae-woo and the expulsion of U.S. troops. Police
arrested more than 500 people.
   The government deployed about 7,000 troops in a major show of
strength. Hundreds of police in combat fatigues with shields
blocked off the park where the rally was to be held. Other officers
blanketed the city center.
   Dissidents and radical students staged scattered, peaceful
protests in the downtown area after the rally was blocked. Bands of
students attempted to march in some downtown areas, but were
quickly dispersed and some students were dragged away.
   Small peaceful protests were reported in the provincial cities
of Taegju and Chonju, and about 10,000 people marched in the
southern city of Kwangju, according to Korean press reports.
   About 300 radical students were in the second day of a hunger
strike at the Myongdong Roman Catholic cathedral in Seoul. They are
demanding the fall of the Roh government and a government admission
that police killed a radical student. Riot police ringed the
cathedral but did not move in.
   Some of the hunger strikers wrote anti-government slogans with
their blood drawn by biting their fingers as other protesters
applauded. ``Down with the dictatorship,'' the hungers strikers
chanted.
   The protesters said they were inspired by a hunger strike held
by students demanding political reforms in China.
   About 500 students were blocked by riot police when they
attempted to march out of Yonsei University in western Seoul.
Students pushed and hit police with sticks but were unable to get
past lines of troopers with interlocked shields.
   ``Bury Roh Tae-woo!'' students shouted. ``Drive out the
Yankees!''
   It was the second Saturday in a row that the government blocked
a protest in Seoul. Few people responded to the dissidents' call to
take part in the protests, despite widespread appeals.
   Dissidents and radical students have little public support
because of their violent tactics and extremist views.
   The United National Democratic Movement, the main dissident
alliance which called for protests in Seoul and 10 other cities,
had predicted up to 100,000 people would demonstrate nationwide.
   It called the rally to denounce the government and demand a full
investigation into the death of radical student Lee Chol-kyu. The
alliance had said its protests would be peaceful because of public
anger over past violent demonstrations.
   Dissidents claim police tortured and killed Lee, whose body was
found in a reservoir May 10 near the southern city of Kwangju. The
government says police chased Lee after stopping him at a roadblock
but deny any official involvement in the death.
   The government says an autopsy shows Lee drowned and officials
speculate he fell into the reservoir.
   In addition to the fall of the Roh government, dissidents are
demanding the removal of the 43,000 U.S. troops based in South
Korea under a defense pact.

   About 300,000 people crowded into a 12-hour
concert held Saturday to raise money for students demonstrating for
reform in Beijing.
   The concert, billed as Hong Kong's largest and longest, began
with an explanation of the Beijing student movement, which includes
demands for democratic reforms such as press freedom. The concert
involved more than 100 musicians from Hong Kong and Taiwan, ranging
from rock stars to opera singers.
   Organizers said the concert, held at a racecourse, raised $1.55
million, which was six times more than expected.
   Television and radio stations broadcast the event live with only
commercial and news breaks. Organizers set up a huge outdoor screen
to keep the audience abreast of the latest developments in Beijing.
   Meanwhile, more than 1,000 senior citizens marched to the Xinhua
News Agency, China's de facto embassy in this British colony, which
reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
   In separate protests, 300 youths and 100 journalists also
marched to Xinhua in support of the Beijing students, while 300
trucks slowly drove past the agency.

   Residents of this affluent community,
shaken by the arrests of five high school students on charges of
sexually assaulting a mentally retarded girl, have raised another
disturbing question.
   Why did it take weeks for authorities to bring charges in the
case when students in the high school were buzzing about the
incident the day after it occurred? Authorities say it just took
that long to investigate, while others charge it was a sign of the
popularity and privileged status of the suspects.
   ``Everybody has known about it for a while,'' said a student who
would give her name only as W. Sanford.
   Police say that on March 1, 13 teen-agers accompanied a
17-year-old mentally retarded girl to the home of two of the teens,
where she was sexually assaulted with a broomstick and a miniature
baseball bat. No sexual intercourse took place.
   The girl, who was an acquaintance of the boys, is not capable of
understanding or consenting to what happened, authorities said.
   Five teens, all 17 or 18, were arrested Wednesday, the day after
a New York City television station broadcast a report on the
incident. Three were charged as adults with conspiracy and assault
charges, two were charged as juveniles. The other eight, who were
not charged, watched the incident but did not intervene,
investigators said.
   Patrick Pignatello, a lifelong resident, said: ``This doesn't
happen in Glen Ridge. I know those kids. I know every family in
town. These kids are well educated. They know right from wrong.
They're not on drugs or alcohol.
   ``I just can't understand how anything like this could happen.''
   Some residents are angry that the March 1 incident is being
compared to the case from New York City, 20 miles to the east, in
which a Central Park jogger was raped by a gang of teen-age boys.
   ``Because of the proximity and time of the New York `wilding'
incidents, analogies are made of rich white boys vs. poor black
youths in the city,'' said Kevin Rigby, an attorney for one of the
teen-agers charged. ``You've got two very distinct incidents here
and it's not fair to make comparisons.''
   Some students and residents say the delay in the arrests may be
due to the popularity of the students, many of whom are athletes.
They also note that among the eight who witnessed the incident but
was not charged is a township police lieutenant's son.
   Missy Sheuermann, a township resident, said she suspected a
coverup by authorities to protect a group of privileged students.
   ``It's appalling. ... No one's ever going to hear the truth,''
she said.
   Students said rumors began circulating the day after the
incident and it was known throughout the 340-student school by the
time of the arrest. ``Everybody knew about it,'' said one junior,
who said he didn't want his name used for fear of reprisals.
   Ray Weiss, spokesman for the Essex County prosecutor's office,
said the length of the investigation was justified by the factors
involved _ the mental state of the victim and the number of boys
involved.
   ``It is the normal course that a complex investigation takes,''
Weiss said. ``You do it as thoroughly as you can until you're
satisfied you've gone as far as you can.''
   The girl first reported the incident March 4 to a teacher at
West Orange High School, where she attends special education
classes.
   The delay by a victim in reporting the attack is common in
sexual abuse cases, said Dr. Jeffrey Segal, coordinator of a
Morristown Memorial Hospital program that cares for victims of
violent assaults.
   ``I think victims in general, children or adults, fear of what
would happen if they do reveal an attack,'' Segal said. ``Also
there is the fear, will people believe them?''
   Police were notified about three weeks later. Rose McCaffrey,
Glen Ridge superintendent of schools, said school officials wanted
to be sure of the nature of the incident before calling in police.
Glen Ridge school officials heard about the incident from West
Orange officials and from a student.
   ``There was certainly no cover-up on our behalf,'' McCaffrey
said. ``We cannot answer why it took them that long to investigate.
They shared no information with us.''

<HEAD>Income Tax Hike Urged by Economist to Close Budget Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Enough talk about ``flexible freezes,'' ``sin
taxes'' and ``revenue enhancement'' to cut the federal budget
deficit, says economist Richard A. Musgrave.
   The real solution to the budget problem, insists Musgrave, an
authority on public finance, is the old-fashioned one: an increase
in the individual income tax. And he wants more than higher rates
that hit the wealthy _ he is calling for restricting the mortgage
interest deduction and for repealing the writeoff for charitable
contributions.
   ``We cannot resolve the federal budget crisis without raising
taxes,'' Musgrave, author of ``The Theory of Public Finance,'' said
in a report issued Saturday.
   ``There is not enough scope for responsible program cuts while
paying for the savings-and-loan bailout and beginning to address
the growing backlog of unmet needs in education, child care, the
environment and public infrastructure,'' he wrote.
   ``Increased revenue is needed and should be drawn from the
personal income tax,'' Musgrave said in a report released by the
Economic Policy Institute, a research group financed by labor,
business and foundations. Musgrave is a professor at the University
of California at Santa Cruz and Harvard professor-emeritus.
   Congress and President Bush agree there will be no general tax
increase to reduce the deficit during the budget year that begins
Oct. 1. The president prefers a ``flexible freeze'' on spending _
Congress would not go along _ and such ``revenue enhancements'' as
extending the expiring tax on telephone service and blocking a
scheduled decline in taxes on air tickets and shipments.
   It remains to be seen whether Bush a year from now will abandon
his campaign promise against any tax increase. While there is a
widespread feeling in Congress that higher taxes will have to be
enacted by Oct. 1, 1990, few lawmakers are calling for major
changes in the massive 1986 tax overhaul.
   Musgrave is.
   ``The proposition that the income tax `must not be touched'
because it has been the subject of recent reform has political
appeal but little substance,'' Musgrave wrote. ``On the contrary:
The need to provide for additional revenue and to do so promptly
should make use of the improved tax, rather than worsen the tax
system by resorting to inferior revenue sources or the addition of
a new and complex tax.''
   Raising excise taxes _ the ``sin taxes'' that Congress talks
about _ would be unfair to lower-income Americans and provide
insufficient revenue for deficit reductions, Musgrave says.
Imposing a national sales tax, known as a value-added tax, would
discriminate against larger families, require a new bureaucracy to
administer and preempt a traditional state revenue source, he adds.
   The individual income tax, which already provides 40 percent of
federal revenues, ``remains superior to other proven taxes and
preferable to most alternatives which have been proposed,''
Musgrave says.
   The income tax is highly visible, ``a steady reminder of the
quality of public service that should be provided in return,'' the
report argues. It permits tax liabilities to be adjusted to the
taxpayer's ability to pay and to family size. And, since the 1986
overhaul, the income tax has people with similar incomes paying
similar taxes.
   But the new law can be improved, making it fairer and providing
sizable revenue to reduce the deficit, Musgrave contends. His
proposals, which could wipe out the deficit in one year:
   _Raise the 33-percent top individual tax bracket, which affects
upper-income taxpayers, to 40 percent and impose a new set of
graduated rates that would hit some middle-income families.
   _Limit the amount of home mortgage interest that can be deducted.
   _Repeal the deduction for charitable contributions.
   _Tax interest on state and local bonds.
   _Tax a portion of the money contributed to pensions, health
insurance and other employer-financed benefits.
   _Impose capital-gains taxes at death on the increase in value of
property during the owner's lifetime.

   As so often in its recent history, China is in a
convulsion, seemingly unable to escape the pattern of using force
or the threat of it to settle political differences and achieve
change.
   Once again, as in the violent 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, the
leaders and masses caught up in the struggle seem oblivious to the
possible damage to China's careful advances in economic reform.
   This time, however, the issues are clearer than in the
far-leftist Cultural Revolution, when a power struggle was cloaked
in ideology.
   At stake now is whether the Communist Party will continue to
determine China's future, or whether it will allow students or any
other group a small voice.
   Although other demands were raised during six weeks of student
protests that climaxed in a top-level power struggle, the students'
key demand is for a meeting, on equal terms, at which specific
reforms such as a free press can be discussed.
   Reformist party chief Zhao Ziyang endorsed a dialogue, and for a
brief time student leaders believed he was winning a power struggle
with hardliners. Some hoped that under him, China might take its
first major step away from a 2,000-year-old tradition of autocracy.
   But by last week's end, it was clear that hardliners under
senior leader Deng Xiaoping and Premier Li Peng were in charge.
   Fears of violent conflict between protesters and soldiers _ and
among military units on opposing sides of the power struggle _
subsided as soldiers ordered by Li to enforce martial law moved to
the outskirts of Beijing.
   Li seemed willing to wait before trying to enforce the martial
law that so far has existed in name only.
   Street marches waned and barely 10,000 students continued a
sit-in at Tiananmen Square that began May 13 and peaked with
200,000 participants. However, students and workers said they would
hold new mass marches this week.
   But even if the movement dies, it will only be a matter of time
before Deng is challenged again by the same clamor for democracy
from students, intellectuals, workers and others whose non-material
aspirations the party has ignored for 40 years.
   Their voice has gained strength with each round of protests. In
1978, hundreds of students and workers put posters on a wall in
Beijing calling for reform. In 1986, students marched several
hundred thousand strong. This month, more than 1 million students,
workers, teachers, doctors, police, government workers, party
members and soldiers joined the chorus.
   Little popular respect remains for leaders who have been seen as
ready to go to any extreme to protect their power. Even children
joined the mocking chant, ``Xiaoping, your mind is not sharp.''
   Beijing residents will not forget soon the heady sense of power
it gave them.
   During the height of the protests, many careened down streets in
flat-bed trucks, whooping and waving flags. They hung Li in effigy
and satirized Deng.
   It was a mass catharsis for citizens of one of the world's most
tightly controlled societies. Even the army lost prestige.
   ``Something has snapped in the entire political system,'' said a
Western diplomat. ``It's impossible to put it back together again
the way it was.''
   Some players may be off the stage for good. Zhao was reported
under house arrest, several other top officials were reported in
serious trouble and a purge of liberals in the party, academia and
the media was predicted.
   Li said most of the student protesters will be regarded as
patriots but that ``a tiny minority'' of student leaders conspired
to overthrow the party and will be punished.
   They can expect to go the way of Wei Jingsheng, the last
impetuous youth who dared take Deng's name in vain in public. Wei,
a 29-year-old electrician, helped lead the 1978 Democracy Wall
movement and is serving a 15-year prison term.
   Semi-retired conservative Chen Yun, 84, in a televised speech
blamed the student protests on ``a relaxation in Marxist
ideological education,'' indicating the nation may face a strident
anti-Western, anti-liberal political campaign like the one that
followed the 1986-87 student protests.
   For a time, at least, writers and artists who had been enjoying
a gradual relaxation of censorship will have to feel their way
carefully.
   Pressures for economic conservativism also will increase. Deng
sponsored a 10-year-old reform program that stimulated the economy
by reducing central planning and introducing elements of the free
market.
   But the reforms have been stalled since September while the
government tries to end supply bottlenecks, corruption and more
than 30-percent inflation. Liberal economists prescribed faster
dismantling of the old system.
   In order to defeat Zhao, however, Deng was forced to seek
support from aging revolutionaries such as Chen, who may insist on
moving slowly and even re-asserting some controls.
   The government also may have scared off some foreign investment
by its harsh response to the protests, which negated the image it
had carefully cultived of a united, rational leadership.
   Ripples will be felt in the British colony of Hong Kong, from
which thousands of professionals already have fled in anticipation
of the return to Chinese rule in 1997. The crackdown will only
encourage further exodus.
   In the end, the huge masses of protesters in Beijing and other
cities seemed irrelevant to the power struggle itself, the outcome
of which was determined by the allegiances of military commanders
and votes in the party Politburo.
   Without mass support, however, Deng's rule will be shaky.
Furthermore, he and the party elders who rallied to him cannot live
forever. Deng is known to suffer from minor illnesses and his
public statements have become rambling.
   He or a successor will be forced eventually to respond to the
masses: to students galvanized by the writings of Thomas Jefferson,
Henry David Thoreau and other Western individualists, to workers
who see inflation erode their buying power while corrupt officials
get fat, and to peasants who are angry at being forced to grow
grain and accept IOUs from the government.
   All have a common yearning: to share in China's prosperity.
Beyond that, most want democracy in the simple terms of being able
to choose their leaders, perceiving the current lot as confused and
ineffectual. They want newspapers that are believable, free of
political controls.
   Very few have said they want to replace the Communist Party, but
a growing number of students and others wonder if their goals can
be achieved under a one-party system.
   They may face arrest, but most of the student activists are
determined to continue agitating for reform as long as they can
despite the fall or rise of top leaders.
   ``Democracy and freedom and science can't be accomplished in one
or two years,'' said Chen Zhangbao of Beijing Normal University.
``We want to go forward step by step ... And hope that future
students will join in.''

   Rep. Tony Coelho, No. 3 in the House
Democratic leadership, said today he will quit Congress rather than
endure a protracted ethics investigation similar to the one that
has driven Speaker Jim Wright to the brink of resignation.
   Coelho, the majority whip in the House, has come under fire in
recent weeks for a $100,000 junk bond investment in which he earned
more than $6,000 without investing any money, and for other
financial dealings.
   In a statement, Coelho said his ability to work in Congress and
serve the Democratic Party ``has been diminished by needless and
baseless charges about my investments or private life. I have
simply spent too much time building the party and trying to help
people to have my attention or abilities devoted to such
distractions.''
   ``Accordingly, I will not seek the office of majority leader.
Instead, I will tender my resignation as majority whip, and will
also resign my seat in Congress _ on my (47th) birthday _ June
15th,'' he said.
   The California congressman said that ``all week, my colleagues
have expressed their confidence in me and their support for a
leader's race. I would have preferred to land in that race with
both feet, and would have had the votes to win.
   ``Moreover, my attorneys remain convinced that a normal business
transaction, admittedly marred by reporting errors, posed no legal
problems for me, and I accept their advice,'' Coelho said.
   He added: ``Undoubtedly, some will think this decision was
motivated by weakness in my political standing or my legal
position. They are entitled to their opinions, but they are wrong.''
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., termed Coelho's
departure as ``a loss,'' adding: ``In the current environment,
realistically, there might be a long period of inquiry which he
feels would be damaging to the party or to the House for which he
has deep affection.''
   With Coelho out of the leadership scramble, Rep. Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., has decided to run for majority leader ``no matter
what,'' a congressional source close to Gephardt said today on
condition of anonymity.
   ``He has been persuaded to run,'' the Democratic source said
today.
   Gephardt learned of Coelho's planned resignation through news
accounts Friday night and was in his congressional office today
calling colleagues to seek their support for his leadership bid.
   According to the Gephardt source, the Missouri congressman has
decided to ``unequivocally'' abandon any presidential plans for
1992 if he wins the majority leader position. Gephardt
unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in
1988.
   Gephard said in a statement he was ``stunned and saddened by
Tony's decision.
   ``He has been an extraordinarily able and effective leader in
the House. He has also been my good friend, and he will continue to
be,'' Gephardt said.
   A top Democratic leadership source, who spoke only on condition
he not be named, said Coelho ``just said he couldn't be an
effective majority leader with these charges out there.''
   Coelho's decision, first disclosed in an interview published in
today's editions of The New York Times, further complicates
Democratic efforts to regroup in the wake of the furor over
Wright's ethical problems.
   Foley is expected to become speaker if Wright resigns as
expected next week.
   Earlier Friday, Coelho had been passing word that he would
attempt to move up to majority leader, but his decision to depart
leaves open the posts of majority leader, whip and possibly several
other leadership posts.
   Coelho told the Times he was taking the actions to avoid a
protracted investigation of his personal finances.
   ``I want to give my party a chance to move on,'' the Times
quoted him as saying. ``I don't intend to put my party through more
turmoil. I don't intend to put this institution through more
turmoil. And more importantly, I don't intend to put my family
through more turmoil.''
   ``If I can't be leader and if I can't be whip, it's time to try
a new and different challenge,'' he said.
   Earlier this month, Coelho acknowledged that a California
savings and loan executive set him up in a junk bond investment
that netted him a $6,882 profit without him having to put up any of
his own money.
   However, Coelho had said that except for some reporting errors
the 1986 deal was ``totally above board'' and he did nothing wrong.
   Coelho has been a rising star in the House. The Californian was
widely respected and liked by other Democrats for his work as
chairman of the party's campaign committee, which raised funds and
provided campaign services for the party's candidates.
   But some Democrats expressed concern privately over the possible
political damage to the party if Coelho took on a more prominent
role at a time when his business dealings were coming under close
scrutiny on the heels of Wright's apparently unsuccessful campaign
to fend off multiple ethics allegations.
   A report released by Coelho on May 14 showed that Thomas
Spiegel, chief executive officer of the Columbia Savings and Loan
Assn. of Beverly Hills, Calif., purchased $100,000 in bonds for
Coelho and held them until Coelho could raise money to pay for them.
   Spiegel also provided half of the money to finance the bonds.
   The bond was sold to Coelho by the executive a month later at
the initial offering price, saving Coelho about $4,000 compared to
the bond's market price at the time. The Los Angeles Times reported
this week that the Justice Department was opening a criminal
investigation of whether Coelho received favored treatment, but
Coelho said the story was wrong.
   However, Coelho acknowledged that he regretted the deal. He put
his personal funds into a blind trust last year, and he said he
wished he had done it earlier.
   According to Coelho's report, he first considered investing his
1986 campaign funds in 12{ percent bonds, based on a suggestion by
Spiegel. Coelho ruled out that type of investment for his campaign,
but Spiegel suggested the congressman himself could make an
investment in the bonds.
   In the report earlier this month, Coelho's lawyer, Robert F.
Bauer, concluded that Spiegel's role in the transaction could not
be considered a ``gift'' which would violate House rules, because
Coelho paid him interest.

<HEAD>Soldiers Kill Guerrilla in Firefight on Jordanian Border</HEAD>

   Troops on Saturday shot and killed a guerrilla
who opened fire from across the Jordan-Israel border and wounded
two soldiers, the army command said.
   The attack occurred in a bushy area near the communal settlement
of Hamadiya, 50 miles northeast of Jerusalem, the military command
said.
   An army patrol, ``encountered light weapons fire from east of
the fence'' between Israel and Jordan, and returned fire, the
command said.
   Soldiers searched the area on the Jordanian side of the border
and found the body of a guerrilla dressed in a military-type
uniform and armed with a U.S.-made M-16 assault rifle, an army
spokesman said.
   But in an official broadcast, Jordan said the man may have been
a Jordanian Army soldier, Issa Mahmoud Ahmad, who earlier
disappeared from a border observation post.
   It was the third infiltration or attack from Jordan since May
1988.
   ``We have the impression that this is not a new step or a new
direction,'' Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, the head of the Israeli army's
central command, told Israel radio. ``We see that the Jordanians
are making every effort and use all means to keep this border
secure and closed.''
   In previous cases, Mitzna said, guerrillas sneaked by Jordanian
patrols. ``This case is still unclear. We don't know who this man
is, where he left from, who sent him and how he came here.''
   The last raid across the Jordanian border was on March 17 when
two guerrillas ambushed an Israeli frontier patrol, killing one
soldier and wounding another before escaping back to Jordan.
   The Fatah-Uprising group, a Syrian-backed faction of the
Palestine Liberation Organization led by Col. Said Mousa, claimed
responsibility for the attack.
   Three Arab guerrillas infiltrated Israel from Jordan on May 17,
1988, and one was killed in a firefight with Israeli troops. The
others escaped.

<HEAD>Brothers Say They Never Planned Voodoo Hex</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Voodoo murder is usually the stuff of
paperback novels and B-grade movies, but it's shaping up as the
fare of a real-life court battle for two men accused of trying to
use a hex to kill a judge.
   ``They are ridiculous charges,'' insists John Henry Adams,
charged along with his half-brother, Leroy Ivy, with conspiracy to
commit murder.
   Prosecutors arrested Ivy on Oct. 14, 1988, minutes after he paid
$100 for a faded photograph of Circuit Judge Thomas Gardner III.
   Gardner had sentenced Adams, 25, to 40 years in the Mississippi
State Penitentiary on an armed robbery charge, a sentence that
Adams was serving at the time of the alleged plot.
   Authorities claim the brothers intended to send the picture and
what was supposed to be a lock of Gardner's hair _ both purchased
from undercover agents _ to a Jamaican voodoo priest who would cast
a death curse on the judge.
   The brothers, who have the same mother but different fathers,
have been jailed in Tupelo awaiting trial on the charges, unable to
post $50,000 bonds. If convicted, they could face sentences of up
to 20 years in prison and fines of up to $500,000 each.
   Their trial, originally scheduled to begin Friday, has been
delayed because it was assigned to Gardner. A new judge is to be
appointed. In the meantime, Adams and Ivy, who spoke during
separate prison interviews, said they are growing weary of the wait
and sick of the attention their case has drawn.
   ``I'm tired of this. I want to know what's going on,'' said the
33-year-old Ivy. ``They've already ruined my life with all these
allegations.''
   ``What makes this so interesting?'' asked Adams, his lanky body
thrown into a molded plastic chair in a jail corridor.
   Prosecutors will say little about the case.
   ``I can't comment on the evidence or our trial plans,'' said
Assistant District Attorney Rowland Geddie Jr. Prosecutors are
expected, however, to argue that it makes no difference if the
intended murder weapon was supernatural so long as the brothers
intended to kill Gardner.
   The defense is expected to argue that the judge's life was never
in danger.
   At the center of the case is the brothers' alleged belief in
voodoo, which Ivy flatly denies and Adams will not directly discuss.
   ``Voodoo is a religion and I shouldn't comment on other people's
beliefs,'' Adams said. ``A lot of people have made a joke out of
this. You shouldn't make a joke out of something you don't know
anything about.''
   The brothers say they haven't seen each other while they've been
in the Lee County Jail.
   ``I ain't seen my brother in eight months. He's right down
there,'' Ivy said, gesturing toward one of two wings. I sure would
like to go down there and holler at him. But I know that would be
wrong and I'm not fixing to do nothing wrong.''
   He did not, he insists, do anything wrong when he purchased the
picture of Gardner from one of the judge's employees. Adams takes
the same position.
   ``Nobody can say that I told anybody that I was going to murder
anybody,'' Adams said. ``Nobody can say that I told anybody that I
was going to practice voodoo. Where did that idea come from?''
   What, then, did Adams intend to do with the photo?
   ``If I told you, who would believe me?'' he replied.
   Pressed on the subject, he finally said he planned to put the
picture on a punching bag he used for boxing at the prison. ``That
was all I could do with it,'' he said.
   Ivy said he and his brother are being railroaded because they
are black.
   ``I live in the South and these white folks don't allow no black
man to do nothing,'' he said. ``The justice system is not set up
for a black man. If a black man goes to court, nine times out of 10
he's going to be found guilty.'' Adams said he is eager to go to
trial.
   ``I'm glad this case is going to trial,'' he said. ``Maybe the
public will get a chance to see how the justice system is really
run in Lee County.''

   Robert Redford first fell in love with
Yosemite when he was 10 years old and his mother took him to the
park as a reward for recovering from a slight case of polio, the
actor and outdoorsman said.
   ``I was quite sick,'' Redford said in a telephone interview
Friday. ``I grew up in a poor neighborhood in Los Angeles and never
had an opportunity to get into the outdoors.''
   Redford, who is narrating a documentary about the park called,
``Yosemite: The Fate of Heaven,'' said he and his mother drove
about eight hours through the redwoods and into a tunnel entering
Yosemite National Park.
   ``We came out the other end, and what I saw absolutely put me
away,'' he said.
   Rising above him in the 760,000-acre park were El Capitan,
Cathedral Rocks and Half Dome, with Yosemite Falls plunging 2,000
feet down sheer granite cliffs.
   ``Everything emanates from that moment, my environmental work,
my love for the outdoors,'' Redford said.
   The one-hour documentary examines the difficulty of preserving
Yosemite, while opening the park to more than 3 million visitors
each year. Yosemite is located about 200 miles southeast of San
Francisco. The park celebrates its 100th anniversary next year.

   Best-selling author Jeffrey Archer said Saturday
the Soviet Union had offered ``real money'' for a Western book for
the first time _ paying him $10,000 for his 1982 saga ``Kane and
Abel.''
   Archer said a similar Soviet deal had been arranged for John Le
Carre's spy novel, ``The Russia House.''
   ``Up to now the Russians either `stole' your books or offered
you rubles which you had to go to Russia to be able to spend,''
Archer said.
   ``But now, in this latest example of glasnost, (Soviet leader
Mikhail) Gorbachev has said that Russian publishers have to pay
proper prices if they want to be competitive,'' he said.
   Archer claime both books were anti-Russian ``in the sense that
Le Carre's is about a spy in Russia and mine is about a man who
escapes from Russia and makes good in the United States.''
   ``So they have had the courage not simply to pick books which
automatically say what a wonderful country the Soviet Union is,''
he said.

   Former ``Six Million Dollar Man'' Lee Majors
has been awarded more than $500,000 in a lawsuit filed against a
former business partner in two oil rig drilling companies.
   A Garfield County district court awarded Majors and partner Ray
Davis of Enid about $1 million after deliberating more than five
hours Friday.
   The men had sued Vaughn and Laura Good for $4.9 million for
allegedly spending company money to pay personal bills, and buy oil
equipment and invest in oil wells and then keep the profits for
themselves.
   Majors testified during the two-week trial that he invested $3.2
million in two oil drilling rig companies with the Goods and lost
more than $1 million. Davis claimed he lost more than $1.5 million.
   Attorneys for the defendants said, however, that Majors, who
starred in television's ``The Six Million Dollar Man'' and ``The
Big Valley,'' and Davis may not receive their complete awards
because the judge in the case agreed to impose a $90,000 cap on
judgments against Laura Good and Vaughn Good has filed for
bankruptcy.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has joined the
select and historic band of Freemen of the City of London, but
there were doubts she would exercise one of her new rights _
driving sheep unhindered across London Bridge.
   In a glittering and ancient ceremony Friday at Guildhall, seat
of the square-mile City of London, which is now the capital's
financial district, Mrs. Thatcher joined a list of national and
international notables.
   In his welcoming address, Lord Mayor Sir Christopher Collett
noted that her right as a Freeman to drive sheep across London
Bridge had fallen out of favor in recent years.
   But Mrs. Thatcher's new status does mean she can request an
audience of Queen Elizabeth II and present her with a petition
pleading for help.
   As part of the ceremony, Mrs. Thatcher affirmed an oath of
allegiance to the queen and promised to hinder and give warning of
any plots against her.
   The prime minister, flanked by Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie and members of her Cabinet, also promised never to be
``idle'' and work constantly for her own advantage and the
advantage of others.
   The Freedom of the City of London dates from 1275. Before the
19th century, being a Freeman was essential for anyone wanting to
trade or be a craftsman in the City of London, and Freemen were
exempted from paying tolls at markets and fairs and from being
drafted into the armed forces.

   The newest pizza outlet in the state won't
promise delivery within 30 minutes, but the owners have an excuse _
their new shop is a boat.
   The 32-foot ``Pizza Tug O'' is due to make its maiden voyage
Tuesday. It will ply the waters of southeastern Alaska, where
almost every town is on its own island and pizza delivery was out
of the question until Helen and Fred Tallmadge decided that where
there's a wave there's a way.
   The Tallmadges, who came to Alaska on their honeymoon seven
years ago and never went back, opened the first Domino's Pizza
franchise in Juneau in February 1987 and a second shop six months
later.
   Their third shop, the $125,000, custom-made boat, has a top
speed of 14 miles and 17 pizzas an hour. The onboard kitchen has
been specially designed to meet regulations for safe food handling
in restaurants.
   The boat will make weekly voyages from Juneau, population
28,000, to the smaller communities of Haines, Skagway, Hoonah and
Angoon. It also will drop anchor near commercial fishing grounds.
   The landlubbers at Domino's headquarters in Ann Arbor, Mich.,
Tallmadge said, ``were dubious about it at first. I think mostly
they wanted to protect me. But I was persistent and finally they
approved it.''
   Domino's claims to be the world's largest pizza delivery company
with more than 5,000 stores. Its new Juneau outlet is the only
floating one, said spokeswoman Moira McDermott.
   Tallmadge said he expects to run the pizza boat regularly from
April through October, and there may be some winter runs when
weather permits. Pizzas will be a couple of dollars more expensive
aboard ship than on land, and the company's 30-minute delivery
guarantee will not apply.

   Most sixth-graders work on science
projects, but few receive the results 11 years later from 250 miles
away.
   Barb Spence, formerly of Battle Creek, was 12 years old in March
1978 when she put a note into a baby food jar, sealed it with black
tape and threw the jar into the Elkhorn River.
   The note included instructions to contact her if the jar was
found as part of her sixth-grade science project.
   Over the years, Miss Spence grew up, married and moved to
Tallahassee, Fla. But the jar apparently continued its slow journey
down the Elkhorn, into the Platte River and finally the Missouri
River.
   Last month Bill Jeffrin of Orrick, Mo., found the jar almost
hidden on a sandy shore of the Missouri River southwest of Kansas
City. The note inside was still legible, so Jeffrin contacted Miss
Spence's parents, Lyle and Rosie Spence of Battle Creek.
   ``We couldn't imagine that the note had survived. I thought it
was a joke at first,'' Mrs. Spence said. ``But Mr. Jeffrin seemed
so excited and sincere that we gave him Barb's phone number.''
   At first, Mrs. Spence said, her daughter thought Jeffrin ``was
pulling her leg.'' But then the memory of the project came back.
   ``She thought it was incredible to get the results of that
project so many years later. She was thrilled,'' Mrs. Spence said.
   The find also surprised Loren Kment of Norfolk, the teacher who
assigned the science project 11 years ago.
   Kment, who is now an insurance salesman, said the project was
intended to combine a science lesson on river currents and an
English lesson on communication.
   ``It's wonderful to realize that my lessons are still having an
impact on the students, even 11 years later,'' he said.

<HEAD>Woman Dies of Burns from Tanning Booth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 45-year-old woman who had taken medicine that
made her skin more sensitive to light died from burns she received
in a tanning booth, according to a published report Saturday.
   Patsy Campbell of Portage, Ind., died Wednesday at the
University of Chicago Medical Center from complications caused by
burns she suffered at a beauty salon's tanning booth, said
Christopher Morris, spokesman for the Cook County medical examiner.
   Burns covered 70 percent of her body, he said.
   Ms. Campbell had undergone a 25-minute tanning session on May
13, he said.
   The Chicago Sun-Times on Saturday quoted unidentified sources as
saying that she had been taking psoralen, a drug that increases the
skin's sensitivity to light. The drug is most often used in
conjunction with ultraviolet lamps to treat psoriasis, a skin
disease, the newspaper said.
   Dr. Alan Dimick, a burn expert from the University of Alabama,
said he believes this is the first case of a death caused by burns
from a tanning booth.
   Taking photo-sensitizing drugs, including certain antibiotics
and oral anti-diabetic drugs, ``would set her up for the burn,''
Dimick said.
   Soon after Ms. Campbell went to the tanning parlor, she started
to itch all over her body, and blisters formed two days later,
Morris said. She was admitted to an Indiana hospital and later
transferred to the burn unit at the University of Chicago.

   President Bush and the heads of the 15
other NATO nations meet this week to mark the alliance's 40th
anniversary and set a course for future dealings with Moscow's
unpredictable and popular leader, Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``The East is turning toward the West and is opening up,'' said
Manfred Woerner, secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. ``We will not miss the opportunity.''
   A dispute over NATO's short-range nuclear missiles threatened to
undermine the show of unity, but Woerner said, ``Let me make it
very clear that this summit is not a missile summit.''
   Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, the Netherlands' ambassador to NATO, said
the allies need to agree on an overall strategy. They cannot pursue
``completely independent Eastern policies. They have to do that in
close contact and coordination,'' he said.
   But the strategy will likely contain few initiatives that will
grab public attention in Western Europe as have Gorbachev's
peacemaking promises of major cuts in arms, troops and defense
spending.
   Bush, in keeping with his cautious approach toward the Soviets,
is weighing more moderate moves including a smaller U.S. troop
reduction in Europe and a possible end to U.S. economic sanctions
against the Soviets. While less sweeping than Gorbachev's
proposals, such moves would be likely to gain support in a Europe
hopeful for less combative East-West relations.
   ``I would not exclude the possibility that there will be some
new ideas,'' said Woerner.
   But Alton Keel, the American ambassador to NATO, acknowledged,
``It's hard to match Gorbachev'' in the public imagination,
especially in Europe where his proposals have won him wide
popularity.
   The first of the NATO leaders began arriving in Brussels on
Saturday, with Bush to follow late Sunday after his visit to Italy.
Prime Ministers Brian Mulroney of Canada and Andreas Papandreou of
Greece, the latter accompanied by his much-photographed mistress
Dimitra Liana, were among those arriving early for the two-day
summit.
   Preparations leading up to the summit were dominated by the
dispute between the United States and West Germany over the future
role of short-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
   Bonn would like to enter into early negotiations with the Warsaw
Pact over reducing those weapons, most of which are in West Germany.
   The United States and Britain argue the alliance should focus
its attention on cutting the East's superiority in conventional, or
non-nuclear, weapons. NATO contends it needs a nuclear arsenal as a
deterrent to balance the East's enormous stockpile of conventional
arms.
   The United States agreed last week to accept the principle of
eventual talks on tactical nuclear arms but only with strict
conditions.
   American and British officials worry that entering into the
negotiations would inevitably lead to a ``third zero'' _ the
removal of all those forces from Europe.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared in a radio
interview on the eve of the summit that ``if you reduce those
(missiles), you're going for the jugular of NATO.''
   A West German official, meanwhile, offered an assurance of
cooperation. ``We must not give the impression that the Germans
alone know the recipe for the future of Western policies,'' Defense
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg told the Bild newspaper.
   But West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Saturday ruled out
postponing superpower talks on short-range nuclear weapons ``into
the distant future'' as a possible compromise in the dispute.
   Woerner said that despite the missile dispute, the overall shape
of NATO policy is likely to remain the same. The summit will
culminate Tuesday with the release of a document expected to
reaffirm longstanding NATO positions.
   The main section of the document is tentatively called,
``Overcoming the Division of Europe,'' said a senior NATO official,
who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   A key point, he said, will be:
   ``The alliance reaffirms that it will and must reintensify its
own efforts to overcome the division of Europe and to explore all
available avenues of cooperation and dialogue with the East.''
   The document will refer to the efforts by 35 nations to improve
personal freedoms and human rights and open up military matters in
an effort to reduce tensions among the East and the West. It will
challenge the East to make further progress.
   Bush also was expected to discuss his recent ``Open Skies''
proposal. The plan, expanding on an initiative by President Dwight
D. Eisenhower, calls for NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact to
permit unarmed aerial surveillance flights over their territory.
   The NATO official said the political document will spell out an
``action agenda'' of eight to 10 points for expanding East-West
contacts and cooperation.
   The aim, he said, is to support and encourage ``those reforms
which go our way _ which enhance pluralism and allow democratic
structures to unfold better.''
   The document will also discuss relations among the Western
nations, including ``burden-sharing,'' a shorthand term for the
sticky question of whether the Europeans are paying enough for
their own defense and the United States too much.
   A resolution of the dispute would show up in the Comprehensive
Concept, a blueprint for NATO planning on arms control and force
structures. The document is nearly complete except for wording on
the divisive issue.
   NATO members are: Canada, the United States, Belgium, Britain,
Denmark, Germany, Greece, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Turkey.

   About 2,200 workers from central
Yugoslavia on Saturday protested the government's closing of a
food-processing company implicated in the country's largest
financial scandal.
   The company's workers arrived from the town of Velika Kladusa on
Friday and gathered in a sports stadium in the capital. They
demanded authorities allow the bankrupt Agrokomerc company to
resume production.
   They also asked that a former company manager, now on trial in
Bosnia-Hrrcegovina, be released from detention and that details of
the reported fraud be made public. The company reportedly issued
some $1 billion in uncovered promissory notes before being closed.
   The protesters said they will rally before the federal
parliament on Monday if their demands are not met, the Tanjug news
agency reported.

   Dudley Brewster and his family are
refugees from a disaster they were told would never happen.
   They had been assured by officials that a devastating train
wreck in their modest suburban neighborhood on May 12 posed no risk
to a 14-inch gasoline pipeline buried near the tracks.
   The pipe had been inspected. The trains would roll again.
Everything was safe.
   Then, Thursday morning, as Brewster took a morning walk, the
familiar rumble of a freight train was followed by an unusual
sight: a geyser of gasoline spraying dozens of feet into the air.
   Suddenly, a thunderous explosion rocked the neighborhood and
flames engulfed everything. Brewster woke his wife and two sons,
ages 6 and 12, and tried to get to his truck in the garage, but the
flames beat them back. They blindly ran into the street and
sprinted to safety several blocks away.
   The blast killed two people, injured 31 and destroyed 10 homes.
It was less than two weeks after a runaway train plowed through
homes across the street, killing four people.
   Among the burned homes was the one rented by the Brewsters.
   ``All I've got left is a set of keys that don't go to
anything,'' Brewster said.
   He is not alone in his loss, nor in his bitterness and fear. The
disasters have sent waves of anger, apprehension and uncertainty
through this blue-collar neighborhood of modern, ranch-style homes,
many of them only a few feet away from the train tracks.
   Counselors who were summoned to the neighborhood found adults
and children alike who spoke as if they had just left a combat
zone. Mental health workers said they expect many people to suffer
the same long-term problems that afflict war veterans.
   And everywhere _ in hospitals, rescue shelters and hotel rooms _
people expressed a strong fear of returning to the old
neighborhood, certain that any assurances that the area is safe are
nothing but lies.
   ``They don't want to come back. Nobody wants to come back,''
said San Bernardino City Councilwoman Valerie Pope-Ludlam.
   Cita Wilson, 18, was sleeping Thursday morning when she felt the
rumble of what she assumed was a passing train, a sensation that
still jangled nerves among those who lived by the tracks.
   This time, she rolled over to go back to sleep, but was pulled
out of her slumber again by the shouts of her neighbor.
   ``It felt like an earthquake,'' said Ms. Wilson, who leaped for
the door. ``The whole neighborhood was orange and red. That's all I
saw. I just went outside and ran. I ran north. I just kept
running.''
   Ms. Wilson was unharmed and her home escaped damage, but like
many people, she doesn't want to go back to a neighborhood she
hardly recognizes anymore.
   Duffy Street, in the heart of the damaged area, resembles an
eerie black moonscape covered with gutted cars, charred trees,
blackened telephone poles and the skeletons of homes. At one house,
all that remains of a garage is a small piece of wood holding a
padlock; at another home, what once was a swimming pool is now a
black pit.
   ``When the train fell off the track, I was there by myself,''
Ms. Wilson said. ``When the explosion happened, I was there by
myself. And now I'm afraid to be by myself.''
   Counselors who have spoken to dozens of residents said Ms.
Wilson's feelings are common.
   The train derailment alone had frightened many people out of
returning to the neighborhood, and many were skeptical of official
assurances that the pipeline near the tracks would not be
threatened by the resumption of rail traffic. About 100 residents
even hired an attorney who says he found evidence that the area was
unsafe.
   With the second disaster, the fear of going home is overwhelming
for many people, said clinical psychologist Patricia Haire, a Roman
Catholic nun who met many residents at an evacuation center.
   Mental health workers are paying special attention to children.
At Muscoy Elementary School, a memorial service for two students
killed in the train derailment was postponed Friday. Counselors
came to classrooms, asking students to write down their feelings
and share their thoughts with friends and family.
   ``The trauma will stay with people for some time,'' said Red
Cross psychologist Sandra Smith. ``Especially with the children, it
may pop up later down the line. They could be skittish about an
earthquake, or any other thing like that. It could even pop up in
some nervousness in relationships.
   ``It really is post traumatic stress syndrome, the same thing
you hear about all the time with Vietnam veterans.''
   For some, the anger and bitterness have overwhelmed any ties
they may feel to the neighborhood.
   ``All these people were saying it was safe to go back after the
train accident,'' Brewster said. ``Now the Red Cross says it's got
another place for me a few blocks away. I said, `Uh-uh. No way.
We're never going back.'''

   The Basque separatist organization ETA
claimed responsibility for a car bombing that killed three
policemen and injured five people last week, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
   The Basque daily Egin said ETA sent it a statement also claiming
responsibility for the bombing of a car dealership in Bilbao. That
blast occurred Wednesday, shortly before the car bomb, and
apparently was designed to lure police to the site.
   The car bomb was left in a stolen vehicle parked near the
dealership.
   ETA seeks independence from Spain for the three-province
northern Basque region. In its 21-year campaign of violence, ETA
has claimed responsiblity for killing more than 600 people, mainly
police, military and Civil Guard officers.
   The seven ETA killings this year have occurred since April 4,
when the group broke off three months of peace talks with Spanish
officials and ended a moratorium on attacks on government targets.

   Leaders of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party are seeing red _ and white and green.
   Party leaders are upset that the upstart Democratic
Revolutionary Party has adopted the same three colors used for 60
years by the governing party on its flags and emblems.
   Red, white and green also happen to be Mexico's national colors.
   Governing party leader Fernando Ortiz Arana said during a
meeting of the Federal Electoral Commission on Friday that the
party's newly formed rival should be given 30 days to switch
colors, according to the Excelsior news service.
   But Democratic Revolutionary Party leaders say the governing
party should not have a monopoly on the three colors Mexicans
associate with patriotism.
   Herbert Castillo, a party leader and former presidential
candidate of the Mexican Socialist Party, said his former party had
been allowed to use the colors red and green. The socialist party
is being absorbed by the Democratic Revolutionary Party.
   ``We just want to add white now,'' Castillo said.
   The new party is being formed by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a former
governor of Michoacan state who came in second to governing party
candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari in the July 1988 elections.
Salinas took office in December.
   The Electoral Commission, which is dominated by the governing
party, currently is holding hearings on the formation of the new
party.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists have unearthed the
gold-stuffed tomb of two women in what appears to be the richest
discovery ever made at ancient Nimrud in northern Iraq.
   The 2,700-year-old tomb in the palace of King Ashurnasirpal II
contained more than 55 pounds of gold jewelery including diadems,
necklaces, earrings, belts and anklets, the English-language
Baghdad Observer reported Friday.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, carried
details of the newspaper report.
   Nimrud, a sprawling site 250 miles north of Baghdad, was a major
city of the Assyrian empire that extended from the Persian Gulf to
the Mediterranean in the first millennium B.C.
   Ashurnasirpal II was a ruthless but brilliant military leader
who built the vast palace at Nimrud in the 9th century B.C.
   Scores of Iraqi and foreign archaeological teams have dug at
Nimrud in a century-and-a-half of excavations since British
explorer Henry Layard uncovered huge stone sculptures and
inscriptions there in the 1840s.
   The explorers included British archaeologist Max Mallowan, the
husband of author Agatha Christie, who excavated close to the newly
found tomb between 1949 and 1958.
   Some of Layard's and Mallowan's finds are displayed in the
British Museum in London, as well as in Iraq's national museum in
Baghdad.
   Muzahem Mahmoud, the Iraqi archaeologist who made the new
discovery, said an inscribed stone tablet found in the
32-by-14-foot burial chamber identified one of the women as Yabaya
of the Assyrian royal court, the newspaper reported.
   The inscription in wedge-shaped cuneiform script also placed a
curse on anyone who opened the tomb.
   ``If anyone lays his hands on my tomb, or opens my grave, or
steals my jewelery, I pray to the gods of the nether world that his
soul shall roam in the scorching sun after death...Let the ghost of
insomnia take hold of him for ever and ever,'' it said.
   The other woman was identified only as a much younger person
named Taliya, the newspaper said.
   Yabaya's possessions included gold needles, a bronze mirror with
its enamel handle encrusted with precious stones, and tiny tongs
for applying kohl, a dark eye makeup, the paper said.
   ``We found more than 100 earrings beside her skull, some small,
some large. She had all her personal belongings buried with her in
the grave,'' Mahmoud said.
   The report said that rich royal tombs had been unearthed at
Ashur, another Assyrian city, but none contained as many precious
objects as the Nimrud grave.
   It said that although the Assyrian empire is well-documented,
there are few references to the role of women at the royal court.
   However, Queen Semiramis is known to have ruled Assyria for five
years at the end of the 9th century B.C.

   As President Bush held presummit talks with Italian
leaders, the White House said today the United States will not
withdraw troops from Europe without consulting its Western allies.
There also were hints the United States might ease economic
sanctions against the Soviet Union.
   Leaving the door open for troop reductions, White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the latest Soviet proposal for
reducing tanks and other conventional forces in Europe presents
``some opportunities'' for the West.
   Fitzwater said Bush will discuss conventional force levels with
15 other allied leaders when a NATO summit meeting begins in
Brussels on Monday.
   On three separate occasions today, Bush brushed aside reporters'
questions about whether he was planning to announce withdrawal of
as many as 30,000 troops from Europe, nearly 10 percent of the
total stationed there.
   Bush held private talks with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican
Saturday evening. Afterwards the pontiff praised Bush for
combatting ``the moral crisis'' of drugs.
   Bush in turn spoke warmly of the pope's efforts for world peace
and said ``we've made progress in reducing armaments.''
   Before the audience with the pope, Bush held talks at a 16th
century hillside villa with Italian Premier Ciriaco De Mita, and
later conferred over lunch at the Quirinale Palace with President
Francesco Cossiga.
   Fitzwater refused to discuss possible troop cutbacks but said,
``The United States will not unilaterally withdraw troops from
Europe,'' meaning that Bush would consult first with its allies.
   In Brussels, said Fitzwater, ``the president clearly will be
discussing a number of ideas _ many of them have not been presented
before.'' He said he could not discuss details.
   Asked whether Bush might be willing to ease economic sanctions
that were imposed against the Soviets in 1980, Fitzwater pointedly
noted that the Soviet Union has withdrawn its troops from
Afghanistan.
   It was the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 that
prompted the United States to impose a ban on technology transfers
to Moscow.
   Fitzwater said any action on lifting sanctions would depend on
talks with U.S. allies. ``This is a matter we would have to
discuss,'' he said.
   Fitzwater left the door open for possible U.S.-Soviet talks on
reducing American troop levels in Europe. Until now, the United
States has been willing to talk only about NATO and Warsaw Pact
tanks, artillery and other equipment but has ruled out direct
negotiations over troop levels.
   Fitzwater said the Soviets were ``coming around to NATO
thinking'' and that there was ``a different climate we find
promising.''
   The Washington Times reported that Bush planned to propose a 10
percent cutback in American troop strength in Europe, which totals
between 305,000 and 325,000 personnel.
   The Washington Post quoted sources in today's editions as saying
the administration is considering an offer to negotiate cuts in
troop strength, aircraft and helicopters in Europe if the Soviet
Union agrees to cuts in tanks, armored personnel carriers and
artillery pieces.
   Bush has been under intense pressure at home and abroad to reply
to a series of disarmament proposals from Moscow with some ideas of
his own. White House officials readily acknowledge that Bush has
seemed too negative while Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
been portrayed as a peacemaker.
   There is pressure in Congress for withdrawal of at least 8,000
troops, to pull back Americans whose jobs are eliminated by the
1987 U.S.-Soviet treaty to destroy medium-range nuclear missiles.
   Fitzwater said discussions about conventional arms _ troops,
tanks and non-nuclear artillery _ would be ``a major thrust of the
discussions'' when Bush attends a NATO summit Monday and Tuesday
with leaders of 15 other Western nations.
   ``Any ideas in this area would be ones the president would want
to discuss with the allies,'' Fitzwater said. ``He would raise
(them) with his partners at this session before he discusses
anything publicly.''
   The NATO meeting has been clouded by West German demands for
Washington and Moscow to begin negotiations soon to reduce _
possibly eliminate _ short-range nuclear missiles in central Europe.
   The United States and Britain oppose such talks now because of
the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact's superiority in tanks, troops and other
conventional weapons. Washington and London also fear the
negotiations would ignite public pressure to eliminate the missiles
entirely.
   Fitzwater said Bush and the Italian premier agreed on the need
to encourage reforms in the Soviet Union and maintain NATO unity.
They also discussed East-West talks in Vienna on reducing
conventional forces in Europe.
   On his arrival shortly before midnight Friday, Bush made no
reference to reports of possible troop withdrawals.
   Instead, he declared the United States wants a ``stronger and
more united Europe,'' and said he plans to be ``actively engaged in
Eastern Europe, promoting measures to encourage political and
economic liberalization in Poland.''
   Bush plans to visit Poland in July.

   Cosmos 2021 became Object No.
20,000 in the U.S. Space Command's space catalog this week.
   The Soviet satellite was logged into the catalog at 5:30 a.m.
Wednesday, the time of its launch.
   The Space Command's Surveillance Center is tracking about 7,000
manufactured space objects, but has cataloged every satellite or
piece of junk larger than a softball in Earth orbit since Sputnik
was launched on Oct. 4, 1957.
   The center has tracked a wrench and camera dropped by
astronauts, bits and pieces of exploded rocket bodies, satellites
and shuttles.
   Most of the 13,000 objects that have fallen back toward Earth
burned up in the atmosphere.
   But a few more notable objects, such as the U.S.-built Skylab
and the Soviet-built Cosmos 954, were too large to burn up and came
crashing back to Earth. Cosmos 954 and its nuclear reactor fell in
northern Canada in January 1978; Skylab fell in Australia and the
Indian Ocean in July 1979.
   The Space Surveillance Center uses radar and optical tracking
devices to keep track of the objects.
   The information is used to ensure that the shuttle or other
rockets depositing payloads in space don't run into objects in
orbit, or that a falling satellite isn't mistaken for a missile
attack.

   Communist maverick Boris N. Yeltsin and other
outspoken Moscow reformers lost their bids today for seats on a new
standing legislature, and one suggested they join forces to fight
the Communist Party.
   Yeltsin and other reformers were elected in March to the
2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies, which in turn today
chose the smaller, full-time Supreme Soviet and in doing so shut
out many progressive candidates.
   Many party chiefs and top bureaucrats also faced stiff
opposition from fellow congressmen but were elected to the Supreme
Soviet, the revamped law-making body that replaces the rubber-stamp
predecessor of the same name.
   The deputies voted Friday night from a ballot of 600 candidates
_ all members of the congress _ to fill the 542-member Supreme
Soviet.
   In the Baltic delegations, another hotbed of reform, deputies
nominated only as many candidates as they had seats and succeeded
in electing a number of radical leaders to the Supreme Soviet.
   Yeltsin won a majority of the votes of his fellow deputies but
ran last out of 12 candidates vying for 11 Supreme Soviet seats
designated for the Russian federation. Deputy Yuri A. Osipyan,
chairman of the commission that counted the ballots overnight, said
Yeltsin got 1,185 votes in the Congress of People's Deputies, with
964 members of the national congress voting against him.
   Yeltsin said he was saddened and upset by the results but
pledged to continue his crusade, indicating he might seek the vice
presidency, which also will be voted on by the congress.
   ``I must fight to the end,'' he told reporters. He added that
was his responsibility to the millions of Muscovites who sent him
to the Congress. ``I must fulfill their will and their orders. I
wouldn't throw away any job.''
   The anti-establishment Yeltsin headed a list of vanquished
Moscow-based reformers and radicals, including sociologist Tatyana
Zaslavskaya; economist Gavril Popov; Ilya Zaslavsky, an advocate
for the handicapped; historian Sergei Stankevich; and biologist
Alexei Yablokov.
   In a nationally televised session held in the Kremlim Palace of
Congresses, many deputies applauded in delight as Osipyan announced
the radicals' defeat.
   Before the balloting, some deputies complained the nominating
procedure had been rigged to keep party and government officials in
power.
   ``We have formed a Brezhnev-Stalin Supreme Soviet,'' said
progressive historian Yuri Afanasyev in dismay as election results
were announced for the new 542-seat legislature. He called the
results depressing.
   Popov declared ``the apparatus has undoubtedly won'' and called
on progressive deputies from throughout the country to form an
``independent deputies' group'' to fight Communist Party and state
bureaucrats.
   ``The apparatus clearly wants to get retaliation, clearly wants
to impose its own way at the Congress,'' Popov charged. He said
``deputies of a democratic orientation'' sought at first to work
with fellow parliamentarians, but that ``from the beginning, our
work has met with disbelief and prejudice.''
   In consequence, ``a group of deputies considers it necessary to
withdraw from the Moscow delegation,'' the economist announced.
``We are going to form ... an independent deputies' group, and
invite all deputies to join us.''
   If reformers unite, it would be the first opposition faction in
the congress, where for decades the Kremlin leadership has imposed
its will unimpeded by opposition.
   The deputies elected some more mainstream figures who proclaim
support for Gorbachev's program of ``perestroika,'' or
restructuring, but who refrained at the congress from fiery
rhetoric. They included agriculture reform advocate Alexei
Emelyanov, Izvestia editor Ivan Laptev, Soviet Academy of Sciences
vice president Yevgeny Velikhov and independent historian Roy
Medvedev.
   The Muscovites put up 55 candidates for the 29 seats allotted
them, defending the principle of multicandidate elections but
ensuring some of their number would be defeated. Many old-style
candidates, including former cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, beat
out the reformers.
   Yeltsin lost his job as Moscow party boss in November 1987 after
he criticized the slow pace of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reforms and suggested it was time for a multiparty system to end
the communists' legal monopoly on power.
   In his congressional campaign he attacked official privilege and
called for a better life for average Soviets, and won nearly 90
percent of the vote.
   Yeltsin and the other deputies from Moscow drafted their own
congressional agenda, including radical measures to revive the
shortage-ridden Soviet economy. But the congress rejected any move
to alter the agenda.
   In the Supreme Soviet vote, Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, the only
member of the ruling Communist Party Politburo to stand as a
candidate, met with stiff opposition, with 761 deputies voting
against him. His 1,388 votes, however, were enough for him to
outpoll Yeltsin and be elected.
   Valentin Falin, head of the party's policy-making Central
Committee's International Department, was opposed by 373 deputies,
and Alexander Kapto, chief of the party's Ideological Department,
got 282 ``no'' votes.

<HEAD>Town Balks At Naming Street After Dinah Shore</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINCHESTER, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City council members have tabled a plan
to rename a street after entertainer Dinah Shore because of public
opposition in her former hometown.
   The city's Merchant Association had wanted to rename a street
between Winchester and Decherd ``Dinah Shore Boulevard,'' in hopes
that the singer's name would attract tourists to this small,
south-central Tennessee town.
   Council members tabled the motion ``under advisement from our
constituents,'' Clerk Jimmy Crownover said. ``Most said they would
want to have a name for the street that had some historical value.''
   Miss Shore, who was taping a television show in Los Angeles
Friday, said she was excited at the thought of a street being named
after her. She grew up in Winchester and later moved to Nashville.
   ``I can't tell you what it would mean to have anything named
after me in Winchester,'' she said.
   ``It makes me want to cry with joy and with a thought of sadness
that my mother and father can't be here to know about it, but I
have a feeling they do.''
   Miss Shore has been invited to a celebration this summer marking
the town's 175th anniversary.

<HEAD>OAS Mission Leaves Panama After Failing to Bring About Negotiations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A delegation from the Organization of
American States left Panama on Saturday after four days of futile
talks aimed at finding a solution to Panama's political crisis.
   The delegates indicated they would ask that another OAS mission
travel to Panama soon for additional talks with Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega and the political forces trying to oust him.
   Noriega, who blames the United States for Panama's troubles,
told the mission it was up to the political parties to sit down and
negotiate. Opposition leaders insisted Noriega must negotiate
because he is the real power in Panama.
   ``There are complex problems and deep emotions involved in the
Panamanian situation,'' said Diego Cordovez, Ecuadoran foreign
minister and member of the four-man delegation.
   ``We have promoted communication between the different political
sectors,'' Cordovez said. ``We have fullfilled our mandate.''
   He said the mission met with government and opposition leaders
as well as Roman Catholic Church officials and other groups and
made them all aware of the different points of view.
   ``Unfortunately, there has been no progress for the good of
Panama,'' said Guillermo Endara, the opposition's presidential
candidate in May 7 elections.
   ``The two sides have to start talking,'' Noriega said. ``They
both claim they won.''
   The OAS sent the mission, headed by Secretary-General Joao Baena
Soares, to seek a solution to the impasse created by the annullment
of the elections. International observers say Noriega's hand-picked
candidate, Carlos Duque, lost to Endara.
   The Panamanian government claimed the United States interfered
openly in favor of the opposition by providing financial assistance
and by repeatedly calling for the ouster of Noriega, the Defense
Forces chief and the power behind the government.
   Washington obtained a public condemnation of Noriega from the
OAS, which also blamed Noriega for post-election violence,
including attacks on the opposition candidates.
   The OAS delegates will submit a full report on their mission to
the OAS, which must decide what to do next.
   Noriega has been indicted in the United States on drug
trafficking charges, but he denies the allegations and says
Washington wants him out of power so it can renege on the Panama
Canal treaties.
   Under those treaties, the United States must hand over control
of the Panama Canal by the year 2000.

<HEAD>Illinois Group Forms to Preserve Route 66</HEAD>

   A group of nostalgic Illinoisans with
fond memories of two-lane blacktops and cruising on country roads
are trying to rally support for the historical preservation of a
highway.
   But they're not trying to save just any piece of asphalt with
white lines and gravel shoulders.
   This group wants to preserve and commemorate the legendary U.S.
Route 66, which was wiped off Illinois maps in 1976 upon completion
of Interstate 55 and erased nationwide in 1985. More than half of
the old roadway is gone, while other pieces exist as local
stretches of road.
   ``You'd be surprised how many people have a love affair with
that old road,'' said Mike Yates, one of the group's leaders. ``But
there's a lot of people out there who have strong feelings about
Route 66 and what it represents.''
   To Yates and about 35 other people scattered around the state,
Route 66 represents a bygone era of small towns bustling with
business created by travelers funneled down Main Street by the
nation's highways.
   ``Many people associated Route 66 with freedom, opportunity,
adventure and romance,'' said another organizer, Tom Teague of
Springfield. ``It was the epitome of the open road.''
   Yates fondly remembers small motels, roadside hamburger joints,
shade-tree mechanics and others who made a living in rural America
thanks to highway traffic.
   ``Route 66 really was Main Street, U.S.A.,'' Yates said. ``It
was the `mother road,' as Steinbeck called it, that carried people
west from Chicago to all the way to the shores of the Pacific Ocean
at Santa Monica, Calif. It was an important road for Americans
traveling by car.''
   According to the book ``Route 66, a Photographic Essay,'' Route
66 was formed in 1926 when 2,448 miles of existing and new roads
were connected to establish a link between Chicago and the West
Coast.
   It was dubbed the ``gateway to the west'' and linked eight
states and such cities as St. Louis; Tulsa, Okla., and Oklahoma
City; Amarillo, Texas; Albuquerque, N.M.; and Flagstaff, Ariz., on
its way to the Los Angeles basin.
   ``I remember driving on Route 66 near Springfield a few years
ago,'' Teague said. ``The road was dipping and curving in
topographical rhythm. It caressed the geography instead of bulling
it over like the interstates do. Route 66 had character.''
   The popular song about Route 66, (``Oklahoma City looks oh, so
pretty. ... Get your kicks on Route 66.'') added to its appeal, as
did the 1960s television show featuring two men in a sports car who
experience carefree adventures on Route 66.
   ``That's always been in the back of my mind _ just taking off
down the highway,'' Yates said. ``That's part of the attraction.''
   Yates and Teague are trying to form a Route 66 Association of
Illinois. Two preliminary meetings have attracted three dozen
people interested in preserving and enjoying the estimated 1,000
miles of remaining highway.
   They are supporting a resolution before Congress to authorize a
study of the feasibility of preserving what's left of the road and
naming it a national scenic highway. And Teague wants Illinois
lawmakers to follow the example of their Arizona counterparts, who
rededicated a 158-mile stretch of the old Route 66 in 1988.
   ``They wrote a song about this road and sang `you can get your
kicks on Route 66.' I can't imagine anyone singing `you can shuck
and jive on I-55.' It just doesn't have the same appeal,'' Teague
said.

   Military spending in western countries grew
faster than their economies as a whole in the first half of the
1980s, according to a study based on U.S. statistics.
   It was done by Michael Renner of West Germany for Worldwatch
Institute, a Washington body financed by private foundations and
United Nations.
   The study says the information is based on a handbook of
statistics issued by the CIA and a booklet of the U.S. Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency called ``World Military Expenditures and
Arms Transfers.''
   A table shows that, after a drop in the 1970s, military spending
between 1980 and 1985 grew by an average of 5.7 percent a year in
the western industrial countries. Their gross national products,
meanwhile, grew by an average 2.2 percent annually.
   In the ``centrally planned economies'' _ that is, countries
under Communist rule _ the total growth was an average 1.7 percent
and military spending grew even more slowly _ 1.3 percent, on
average.
   The same pattern is reported for Third World countries, in which
China is included: total average growth of 3.1 percent, and average
growth of military spending 2.1 percent.
   However, the study cautions that ``estimates for centrally
planned economies are likely to have a wide margin of error.''
   For the Third World, it quotes figures from the World Bank to
show that 20 out of 36 countries increased the amount of production
they devoted to military production between 1972 and 1986. All but
three _ the Philippines, Singapore and South Korea _ reduced the
proportion of their spending that went for health or education, or
both.
   Renner cites another private study as saying that if the Third
World countries _ oil-producers excepted _ had bought no arms
between 1972 and 1982, they would have had debts that were 20
percent to 25 percent smaller.
   He said in an interview that he believes the same trend has
continued in more recent years. The United States and other
creditor countries are working now to reduce Third World debt,
estimated at $1.2 trillion, under a plan proposed by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
   Titled ``National Security: The Economic and Environmental
Dimensions,'' the study argues that the true threat to security
comes from damage to the environment, rather than from possible
military attack.
   ``Future generations may regard our recent obsession with
national security maintained by force of arms as a curious
historical diversion that distracted our energies from the most
basic threats to human society,'' it concludes.

   Greek Prime Minister Andreas
Papandreou, accompanied by mistress Dimitra Liani, was first to
arrive here Saturday to attend the 40th anniversary NATO summit.
   His estranged wife, American-born Margaret Papandreou, was due
in Sunday to take part in a peace meeting coinciding with the
summit of leaders of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. The gathering begins Monday.
   Marching through an honor guard of Belgian military policemen,
Papandreou was welcomed at Brussels National Airport by Christos
Zacharakis, the Greek ambassador to NATO, and other diplomats.
   One step behind was Miss Liani, the 35-year-old former air
stewardess who lives with the Greek premier and accompanies him
everywhere.
   She was dressed in a long, multi-colored flowered jacket, a
royal blue blouse, a wide black belt and a short purple skirt that
matched the color of her lipstick and high heel shoes. A bracelet
adorned her left ankle.
   Papandreou shook hands with the Greek diplomats. So did Miss
Liani.
   The meeting was short. The prime minister did not speak with
Greek reporters and left in an embassy limousine with Miss Liani.
   Mrs. Papandreou will be attending the ``NATO Summit Watch''
meeting, a kind of ``off-summit'' of peace organizations.
   She is the international president of the ``Women for a
Meaningful Summit'' organization, a peace group set up for the
first summit between Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev and then-U.S.
President Ronald Reagan.
   Mrs. Papandreou will arrive in Brussels on Sunday and speak at
the opening session of the Summit Watch. Other speakers include:
Ralph Earle II, a former director of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency; John Isaacs, legislative director for the U.S.
organization ``Council for a Livable World,'' and former British
Air Vice-Marshal Anthony Mason.
   It does not seem likely that Mrs. Papandreou will cross paths
with her husband and his girlfriend.
   Elfie Woerner, wife of NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner,
has planned a program for spouses accompanying the NATO leaders,
including a visit to the Museum of Modern Art and a dinner.
   There was no word on Miss Liani's agenda.
   Papandreou, 70, who recently underwent heart surgery, has filed
for divorce from his wife and a ruling is expected shortly before
national elections on June 18.
   According to Athens newspaper reports, Papandreou will marry
Miss Liani in a religious ceremony.

   Joe Clark, the high school principal who
gained national fame by roaming hallways with a bat and bullhorn,
will undergo surgery Sunday to remove bacteria infecting his heart
valve, a cardiologist said.
   Clark, 52, was admitted Wednesday to Beth Israel Hospital with a
high fever, said Dr. Sharlene Watts, his cardiologist.
   ``We're hoping to do it first thing tomorrow morning,'' Watts
said Saturday. ``The reason why it is being done urgently is that
pieces of the bacteria are breaking off the valve and spreading to
other parts of the body.''
   If unchecked, Clark's condition could lead to a stroke, Watts
said.
   ``He is in pretty good spirits,'' she said. ``Because of the
fever he is pretty washed out. You have a very active man and now
he is confined to bed rest.''
   Clark was subject of the recent movie ``Lean on Me,'' which
focused on his disciplinarian ways at Eastside High School in
Paterson.

<HEAD>Armenian Activist Released From Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Armenian activist who was jailed late last year
after widespread unrest in the southern Caucasus region has been
released at the urging of a Communist Party leader, journalists and
activists said Saturday.
   The release of Khachik Stamboltsian, head of an Armenian charity
group, fueled speculation that Moscow may soon free 13 other
leaders of the Armenian protest movement that has been at the
center of the unrest.
   A journalist at Armenpress, the local news agency, said
Stamboltsian's return to Yerevan, the Armenian capital, led to the
cancellation of scattered strikes called to protest the detention
of the activists.
   The journalist, who requested anonymity, said in a telephone
inteview that Stamboltsian was freed after Armenian party chief
Suren Arutyunyan asked the national prosecutor to ``show humanity''
toward the detained activist.
   ``The first response was Khachik's release,'' said Yerevan
activist Hovik Vassilian. ``And now there are rumors that either
all the rest are out, or they soon will be,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   Authorities had been holding at least 14 people, 11 of them
members of the Karabakh Committee that spearheaded demonstrations
and strikes in a jurisdictional dispute touched off by ethnic
friction.
   The Karabakh Committee last year launched a campaign for Armenia
to annex the Nagorno-Karabakh region, where three-quarters of the
162,000 inhabitants are ethnic Armenians. Nagorno-Karabakh is part
of the republic of Azerbaijan.
   The Kremlin rejected the unification demand, putting
Nagorno-Karabakh under Moscow's direct control instead and jailing
the committee members.
   The Armenian drive to annex Nagorno-Karabakh, launched in
February 1988, led to ethnic strife between predominantly Christian
Armenians and mostly Moslem Azerbaijanis in which more than 90
people were killed last year.

   Barbara Bush dished out pasta for homeless women at
a Vatican shelter Saturday and said she found ``great warmth and
affection'' at the facility.
   The first lady set out on her own as President Bush conferred
with Italian officials during the first leg of a four-nation
European trip. Mrs. Bush also inspected one of Rome's crumbling
monuments.
   Mrs. Bush joined her husband later in the day for an audience
with Pope John Paul II.
   At the shelter, Mrs. Bush was welcomed by resident Adelina
Lunati, 65, who presented her with a bouquet of flowers.
   ``We checked it out from head to toe,'' Mrs. Bush said of the
72-bed facility, which was opened last year by the pope and is
operated by the Missionaries of Charity, the order founded by Nobel
Peace Prize winner Mother Teresa of Calcutta.
   ``I'm going to visit Mother Teresa centers when I get back
home,'' she said.
   Mrs. Bush said she found ``great warmth and affection'' at the
shelter.
   Reporters weren't allowed to accompany Mrs. Bush as she toured
the shelter, but a Vatican official said the first lady helped
serve rigatoni al sugo _ short, hollow, tube-shaped pasta with
tomato sauce. The pasta was blessed by Australian Archbishop Edward
Cassidy, deputy Vatican secretary of state.
   Vatican spokeswoman Marjorie Weeke said Cassidy also blessed the
president and Mrs. Bush and the ``important mission they are
undertaking for the good of the U.S. and the world.''
   Afterward, Mrs. Bush inspected Arch of Constantine at the edge
of the ancient Roman Forum, where American tourists greeted her
with a chorus of ``Hello Barbara.''
   Mrs. Bush shaded her eyes from the noon sun as she looked up at
the triumphant arch erected in 315 A.D. to honor Emperor
Constantine. The superintendent of Rome's archaeology department,
Adriano La Regina explained how the arch was decorated with
fragments of other monuments.
   The state spent $1.5 million to clean off some of the black
crust caused by automobile pollution in traffic-choked Rome.
Restoration had to be halted when funds ran out, however, and the
upper half remains whiter than the bottom.
   Security was tight. Italian police, armed with automatic
weapons, were deployed along the edge of the Palatine Hill
overlooking the arch. Helicopters buzzed overhead.
   Asked by a reporter to comment on criticism that her husband has
been too cautious in dealing with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev,
Mrs. Bush said, ``Now what has that to do with ruins?''

<HEAD>Gephardt Jumps Into Race for House Majority Leader</HEAD>

   Missouri's Richard Gephardt began campaigning
for House majority leader Saturday, one day after Democratic Whip
Tony Coelho of California dropped plans to run and said he would
resign his seat in Congress, congressional sources said.
   Gephardt's bid for the No.2 spot in the leadership marked the
latest development in an increasingly complex scramble among
Democrats set off by the expected resignation of House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas.
   Gephardt was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic
presidential nomination a year ago. His race for majority leader
means he will ``unequivocally'' abandon any plans for a White House
bid in 1992, said a source close to the Missouri lawmaker.
   The Missourian has an unblemished record on ethical matters, a
major plus in the wake of financial controversies that have caused
Coelho to resign and brought Wright to the brink of leaving the
speaker's chair.
   The seven-term St. Louis lawmaker had been lobbied hard last
week by some Democrats to run for majority leader, but he chose not
to challenge Coelho, a friend and political ally.
   ``With Tony getting out and people persuading him to run for it,
he made the decision that he would run for majority leader,'' a
Democratic congressional source said.
   Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash., is expected to become
speaker if Wright resigns next week. With Coelho out of the line of
succession, the field is open for the No. 2 and No. 3 leadership
posts.
   On Saturday, Gephardt was in his Capitol Hill office calling
colleagues to seek their support for his leadership bid. His
supporters said he would be the front-runner even if challenged by
others.
   ``If Gephardt gets into it, my feeling is he is the next
majority leader,'' said Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., who had not
talked with Gephardt about the race.
   Gephardt's decision did not daunt at least one other lawmaker
who already is running for majority leader. Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga.,
who began campaigning last week, said Saturday he remains in the
race.
   It ws unclear whether Gephardt's candidacy would dissuade others
from entering the race for majority leader.
   Jenkins and Gephardt serve on the tax-writing House Ways and
Means Committee.
   Gephardt's partisans say he would provide Democrats with a
youthful, high-profile leader who could burnish the party image in
the wake of Wright's ethical problems. The 48-year-old congressman
is viewed by supporters as ``squeaky clean,'' having survived media
scrutiny in 1988.
   He also has earned a reputation as an effective television-age
advocate of tax overhaul and a get-tough trade policy, which was
the centerpiece of his presidential campaign.
   Until the disclosure that Coelho was stepping down from the
House, Gephardt was considering a run for the No.3 post of whip.
   Coelho was a key early supporter of Gephardt's unsuccessful 1988
bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, and the Missouri
lawmaker reportedly did not want to damage his friendship with
Coelho.
   But that changed Friday night when Gephardt learned of Coelho's
resignation from news accounts. Gephardt had met earlier Friday
with Coelho and was stunned when he found out later that his friend
was leaving Congress, according to a congressional source with
close ties to Gephardt.

<HEAD>Israelis and Palestinians Meet; Seven Arabs Reported Wounded in Clashes</HEAD>

   Palestinians who lost
relatives in the anti-Israeli uprising met Saturday with Israeli
peace activists, and some warned that Arabs might take up arms
unless Israel agrees to talk peace with the PLO.
   In the occupied territories, troops wounded seven Palestinians
in scattered stone-throwing clashes, Arab hospital officials
reported.
   In three villages and a refugee camp in the West Bank, about
3,000 Israeli activists from the Peace Now movement met with Arabs
who have lost family members in the 17-month-old uprising. Soldiers
watched the gatherings from afar without intervening.
   Leaders of the 70,000 Jewish settlers living in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip condemned the meetings.
   In the West Bank village of Nahalin, 200 Palestinian men, women
and children greeted the Israelis.
   ``I stand here and greet you because we need peace,'' said
Mohammed Attiyah, whose 22-year-old son Subhi was shot and killed
in a raid last month that left five Palestinians dead and 18
injured.
   Palestinians warned that uprising activists were inclined to use
weapons against the army if Israel persisted in its refusal to talk
peace with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which the
government considers a terrorist organization.
   ``The people with weapons are beginning to wake up,'' said
village leader Abu Khalid. ``We must warn that a true revolution is
possible if we do not achieve our rights.''
   ``We must remind the Israeli government that the Palestinian
nation has its roots here, and there must be peace with our sole
legitimate representative, the PLO,'' Khalid said.
   Last week, a soldier was killed and three Palestinians wounded
in the first gun battle between Israeli troops and Arab activists.
In all, 498 Palestinians and 22 Israelis have died since the
rebellion against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip began in December 1987.
   The Peace Now movement advocates opening talks with the
Palestine Liberation Organization and establishing an independent
Palestinian state. The Israeli government has ruled out either.
   ``If we can prove to Israelis that relations, even political,
are possible, it would also make possible the idea of a compromise
and withdrawal,'' Yoki Amir, a Hebrew University lecturer, said at
Nahalin.
   Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, soldiers shot and wounded seven
Palestinians in stone-throwing clashes, Arab hospital officials
reported. They said the victims included a 16-year-old girl shot in
the head and a 60-year-old woman shot in the ear.
   The army said it was checking the reports.

   Powerful currents that collapsed and swallowed
a temporary one-lane bridge over the Great Miami River prevented
authorities from finding any victims or their vehicles on Saturday.
   The American Red Cross said seven people remained unaccounted
for, but there was no way to know how many of them might have been
on the bridge when it fell into the river Friday evening.
Authorities said efforts to find them could be thwarted for at
least several days by the rushing, muddy water.
   Officials are uncertain how many vehicles plunged into the river
when a 100-foot section of the bridge collapsed. Eyewitness
accounts differed, but authorities believed at least two vehicles
were on the bridge section when it gave out. The number of
passengers aboard was unclear.
   ``We still have no idea,'' said Capt. Arthur Reid of the
Hamilton County Sheriff's Department.
   The river, a tributary of the Ohio River, jumped its banks
Friday following heavy overnight rains that took two lives
elsewhere in Ohio and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars of
damage in Illinois.
   County engineers said the bridge was ordered closed a few
minutes before the collapse because of the danger from debris
pinned against it, but the order had not been carried out when the
bridge collapsed.
   The river was searched Saturday by helicopter, but no trace of
vehicles or victims was found. Authorities tried to use an
air-supported boat, but without success.
   The river crested early Saturday at about 24 feet, eight feet
over flood stage.
   ``Now it's just a matter of time before it starts receding,''
Reid said.
   The fast-flowing river, littered with trees, tires and other
debris, left searchers virtually helpless. Reid said recovery
efforts will be stalled until the waters subside.
   ``You can't even put divers out _ it's too dangerous,'' Reid
said. ``Our boats can't handle the swift currents.''
   The bridge collapsed at Miamitown, a town of 700 people about
seven miles from Cincinnati on the western side of Hamilton County.
Dozens of people gathered at the ends of the bridge Saturday,
craning their necks to see the missing section.
   Chaplains from the sheriff's department were at the scene in
case counseling was needed, but the Rev. Bruno Kremp said there
wasn't much for them to do because of the lingering uncertainty
over the victims' identities.
   The one-lane temporary bridge has been in use for only a few
months. It was erected last year to keep traffic flowing while a
94-year-old bridge is torn down and rebuilt a few feet to the
south. Traffic lights at either end of the 300-foot temporary
bridge regulated traffic over the narrow span.
   The county's chief engineer, William Brayshaw, said he ordered
the bridge closed Friday immediately after the bridge contractor,
National Engineering Co. of Strongsville, Ohio, told him that the
debris-choked river posed a danger to the span. The collapse
occurred before workers could reach it and set up barricades.
   ``The car in front of us just dropped straight down,'' said
Sharon Boebinger, who was waiting to cross the bridge when it
collapsed. ``I said, `Oh my God.' I put it in reverse and backed
up. I didn't feel the bridge shake at all. It just happened in an
instant.''
   Floods caused by heavy thunderstorms elsewhere in Ohio were
blamed for the deaths of a 20-month-old boy who drowned after
falling into a swollen creek near his grandmother's home and a
24-year-old Fostoria woman whose car was washed into a river.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Tony Coelho, the No. 3 Democrat in the
House, said Saturday he will resign from Congress to spare himself
and his party the ordeal of a protracted ethics investigation like
the one that torched the career of Speaker Jim Wright.
   The surprise announcement means House Democrats could be
installing a totally revamped leadership team by the end of next
week, with Thomas S. Foley of Washington the likely new speaker and
several candidates vying for the next two posts of majority leader
and majority whip.
   The end appeared near to Wright's 2{-year reign as speaker _ and
perhaps his 34{-year career in the House _ because of charges
brought by the House ethics committee.
   The Texas Democrat stands accused of arranging bulk sales of his
book as a way to evade House limits on outside income and of taking
gifts from a developer friend with an interest in legislation.
   Wright's lawyers failed last week in an attempt to convince the
House ethics committee to drop at least some of the charges in
exchange for the speaker's resignation. He was in seclusion this
weekend, and the House leadership was preparing for him to deliver
a resignation speech Wednesday.
   Coelho, the current whip, began running for the post of majority
leader last week when it became known that Wright was thinking
about quitting.
   However, Coelho was coming under increasing scrutiny because of
his business dealings, including a deal where a California
savings-and-loan official arranged and helped finance a junk bond
investment.
   A newspaper reported that a federal investigation had begun, and
on Friday Common Cause, the group that lobbies for stricter
government ethics, called on the House ethics committee to
investigate Coelho's finances.
   ``I have simply spent too much time building the party and
trying to help people to have my attention or abilities devoted to
such distractions,'' Coelho said in a resignation statement that
called the charges ``needless and baseless.''
   Coelho said his colleagues had expressed confidence in him and
he would have won the majority leader's race.
   ``Undoubtedly, some will think this decision was motivated by
weakness in my political standing or my legal position. They are
entitled to their opinion, but they are wrong,'' he said.
   Coelho's statement, made available to news organizations, made
no mention of it, but several legislators said privately that he
had been admonished by others not to run for higher leadership. He
would become more of a target, and further injure the party
structure, already reeling because of Wright's travails, they said.
   Coelho, himself, remained out of public view on Saturday. His
statement said the resignation is effective June 15 _ his 47th
birthday.
   Even before Coelho dropped out, Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri was being urged to challenge for the majority leader's
post. With his friend Coelho out of the race, Gephardt began his
campaign in earnest on Saturday.
   Gephardt said he was ``stunned'' by Coelho's decision and
praised the California congressman as ``an extraordinarily able and
effective leader.''
   Gephardt gave up a job in the Democratic leadership to run for
president in 1988. He is now promising colleagues he will not run
for president in 1992 if he wins the majority leader's job.
   Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., began campaigning for leader last week
as an alternative to Coelho and said Saturday he was still in the
running.
   Jenkins declined to handicap his race against Gephardt, but said
many members saw ``a need to bring some new blood, maybe outside
the (established) leadership group, into the game for the good of
the party and of the institution.''
   Jenkins has support from Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the
powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
   At least a three-way race was under way for the whip's post,
between Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., who holds Coelho's former post as
chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee; Rep.
David Bonior, D-Mich., the chief deputy whip, and William H. Gray
III, D-Pa., chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.
   The election for speaker would be held immediately if Wright
were to leave because the House cannot function with that
constitutionally-mandated job vacant. The other party positions
could be elected at the same time or at a later date. But the
Democrats were expected to get it all taken care of in no more than
a week or two.
   Anthony said the resignations and the ensuing shakeup will make
the party look bad. ``In the near term, we've got a problem of
public perception,'' he said.
   But he said ``the spotlight shifts to the Republicans'' soon
because one of their leaders, Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., is the
subject of a complaint before the ethics committee.
   On the other hand, the House GOP, which has largely sat on the
sidelines during Wright's travails lest the ethics probe be seen as
a partisan vendetta, may become more aggressive.
   Republicans are likely to redouble their emphasis on
institutional changes, including pressing for campaign reform and
tougher ethics standards. That would enable them to keep political
pressure on the Democrats by keeping the ethics issue alive without
appearing to be attacking individual personalities.

<TEXT>
   South African Foreign Minister Roelof Botha met with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Saturday and pledged anew
to end white domination of blacks in his country.
   Baker and Botha also discussed a planned visit to Washington by
F.W. DeKlerk, the leader of South Africa's governing National Party
and the man expected to become the country's president later this
year.
   Baker, in a brief exchange with reporters after the meeting,
ssid Botha had ``indicated to us it is the intention of the South
African government to abolish the system of apartheid and we were
pleased to hear that.''
   Botha concurred. ``We are in the process of reform, and we are
dismantling apartheid, and we accept that white domination must
end,'' Both said.
   He said the decision was taken by the South African government
for its own policy reasons and not in response to outside pressures.
   ``It's going to be done in consultation with black leaders,''
Botha said.
   Later, the White House issued a statement saying Botha had told
Baker his party would campaign for the South African presidency
with the view that ``the days of white domination are over.''
   The statement said Baker raised questions about denial of human
and civil rights of black South Africans, individual cases of
detention and restrictions on freedom of travel.
   ``The secretary said that the U.S. government intended to engage
with a full range of black and white South Africans in an effort to
work towards the goal of producing peaceful abolition of
apartheid,'' the statement added.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that in view of the
government changes coming up in South Africa, Baker had taken
``this opportunity to explore any possible changes that might be
taking place in the policies of that government at this time.''
   The invitation to De Klerk, who would be the first top South
African leader to visit Washington in 30 years, and a meeting Bush
had earlier this month with anti-apartheid leaders, are part of a
U.S. initiative to increase contacts with South Africa.
   The United States also appears to be seeking to keep up with the
Soviet Union, which has been meeting with South African activists
across the political spectrum.
   Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen was scheduled to meet
in Rome with his Soviet counterpart this weekend to discuss the
South African changes and other developments.

<TEXT>
   ``Shame on you,'' strikers yell at patrons
entering and leaving Tavern on the Green, one of America's
best-known restaurants.
   ``Please help us or we will die,'' the restaurant management
pleads in a newspaper advertisement aimed at potential patrons of
Central Park's toniest dining spot.
   The monthlong strike at Tavern on the Green may not rival the
Eastern Airlines strike in size or impact on the public, but the
two sides in the restaurant battle yield to no one in rhetoric or
passion.
   Each side accuses the other of lying. In the advertisement,
manager Warner LeRoy calls the restaurant's workers ``among the
highest paid in the restaurant world.''
   ``They are not even the highest-paid in a square mile of his
restaurant,'' snaps back John Turchiano, a spokesman for Local 6 of
the Hotel-Motel Trades Council.
   But while business is down _ and LeRoy admits losing millions of
dollars _ business lunchers and out-of-towners continue to come for
the clubby atmosphere, creme brulee, red snapper and Sunday brunch.
   ``Best reception I ever got,'' joked one business-suited man
Friday after passing through the ``shame on you'' chants.
   ``It's very annoying, them yelling at you,'' said Mary Wieland
of Lancaster, Pa., who was lunching with friends. But, she added,
``I wanted to eat at Tavern on the Green.''
   Management claims Tavern on the Green's workers are among the
best-paid in the business, with a base pay of $18,830 for
dishwashers, the lowest-paid workers at the restaurant. Waiters
make $2.60 an hour plus tips, bringing their total wages to $39,000
to $45,000 a year, management says.
   Turchiano disputes those figures, saying dishwashers who work
five-day, 40-hour weeks make $8,320 a year and that while some
waiters make $40,000 annually, most earn between $17,000 and
$19,000 a year.
   The union has rejected a 21.4 percent increase, saying workers
need 40 percent _ more for dishwashers _ to rise to the level of
workers at comparable restaurants.
   The two sides also disagree about heath care benefits and work
conditions.
   The union has been trying to negotiate a contract with LeRoy
since January and mounted an informational picket line on April 23.
   The strike began April 30, when LeRoy fired workers en masse for
holding a meeting on restaurant premises.
   Details of the incident are murky. Management says there was a
partial walkout by 11 employees; the union says 200 workers called
an impromptu meeting.
   In any event, some workers walked out and were barred from
returning. Most of the rest refused to work and were fired.
   The restaurant management has since hired replacement workers,
and claims to have a full complement of 430 workers. The union says
275 of its members are on strike and 10 have remained on the job.
   Turchiano accused LeRoy of ``spending a fortune to keep the
workers from getting a decent contract.''
   LeRoy said he plans to fight even more fiercely. He said he will
file a lawsuit Wednesday alleging libel, slander and interference
with business.
   ``This is a very rough union playing dirty and telling lies,''
LeRoy said. ``I'm a good employer and I have good employees. This
is a crazy situation.''
   ``He knows how to entertain,'' shot back Steve Palozzi, a
striking waiter, ``but he doesn't know how to take care of his
workers.''

   A group of 40 youths rampaged through Greenwich
Village, threatening passers-by with ice picks and razors and
snatching their gold chains, police said Saturday. Twelve people
were arrested.
   The dozen suspects, aged 12 to 18, were arrested about 10 p.m.
Friday, several minutes after they started running wild through the
Washington Square Park area of Manhattan, said police Sgt. Maurice
Howard. The other youths fled.
   Nine were charged as adults with first-degree robbery and
first-degree riot, he said, and three were charged as juveniles.
   One of the nine, a 17-year-old, also was charged with
third-degree sexual abuse for allegedly fondling a woman's breasts.
Another was charged with criminal possession of a dangerous weapon,
an ice pick, and stolen property, a gold chain.
   They were scheduled to be arraigned Sunday.
   Only minor injuries were reported and no one received medical
attention, Howard said.

   President Bush announced Saturday night that
Italians soon will be able to visit the United States without
obtaining visas.
   Bush announced this step at a black-tie dinner with Italian
Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita and won immediate applause from the
audience.
   ``In the future, Italians who wish to visit our country, whether
as tourists or on business, will no longer need to apply for visas,
and we look forward to that day,'' Bush said.
   The Italians will join British and Japanese citizens under a
special program giving them the privilege of entering the United
States without the usual document required in addition to a
passport.
   A White House fact sheet said the step was taken as part of a
three-year test program mandated by an immigration law to waive
temporary visitor visas under certain conditions.
   The countries are selected by the secretary of state and the
attorney general on the basis of which countries have the highest
volume of non-immigrant visa issuance and which offer reciprocal
treatment of American travelers.
   The program, intended to promote tourism and reduce visa
processing costs, was instituted in Britain and Japan in 1988.
   It allows visitors from these countries to enter the United
States without a visa for up to 90 days for tourism or business.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita has chosen Foreign
Minister Sousuke Uno to succeed him, and the change of power may
come next week, news reports said Sunday.
   Nearly all major Japanese media carried reports that Uno is
likely to become Japan's next prime minister when Takeshita resigns
after 18 months in office because of a huge bribery scandal.
   In a meeting Saturday with Shintaro Abe, the No. 2 man in the
governing party, Takeshita indicated that Uno was his choice as
successor, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. and Kyodo News Service
reported.
   The prime minister said he would seek a consensus on Uno's
selection as party head from other party leaders next week, the
reports said.
   The head of the governing party routinely becomes prime minister
because of the Liberal Democrats' large majority in parliament.
   Uno, 66, told reporters that he had not yet been asked
officially to take the post and said it was ``too early to
comment'' on whether he would accept.
   Kyodo News Service quoted Takeshita as saying ``You should keep
around June 2 in mind'' for the change in administrations.
   Party leaders said Uno emerged as the top contender after talks
Friday between Takeshita and Masayoshi Ito, chairman of the party's
policy-making Executive Council, according to reports in the
nationally circulated Asahi, Yomiuri and Mainichi newspapers.
   Ito, 76, refused May 13 to take the top job, citing his age and
poor health. His refusal eliminated the only strong candidate in a
governing party desperate for a leader with a reputation clean
enough to steer it out of the scandal before elections for half the
seats in the upper house in July.
   Uno said he would leave as scheduled Sunday for Paris, where he
is to attend a meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development. He is due to return June 4, but officials said he
would return immediately if the Cabinet is dissolved before then.
   Party leaders reportedly favor Uno because he is untainted by
the Recruit bribery scandal that has led to more than a dozen
arrests, and because he is experienced in foreign affairs and
therefore capable of leading the Japanese delegation at the July
summit of industrialized nations.
   Uno told reporters Saturday that he believed that extensive
political reforms were needed to deal with the Recruit scandal.
   The Recruit Co., the publishing and information services
conglomerate at the center of the scandal, is accused of trying to
influence government policy by selling underpriced, unlisted shares
in a real estate subsidiary and by doling out millions of dollars
in political donations.
   In addition to forcing Takeshita's resignation, the scandal has
led to the downfall of three Cabinet ministers and the arrest of a
former chief Cabinet secretary.
   In the meeting with Ito on Friday, Takeshita agreed to stay on
as prime minister until a successor was found, although on April 25
he vowed to leave office when the year's budget cleared parliament.
   The $431 billion budget officially took effect Sunday despite an
opposition boycott that blocked debate on the spending bill in the
upper house. Under Japanese law, the budget automatically becomes
law 30 days after being passed by the lower house even if the upper
chamber fails to act on it.

<HEAD>No Longer Laughing Matter For Embattled House Speaker</HEAD>

   Jim Wright chuckled when it was first
suggested that the House of Representatives, which had elected him
speaker just a year earlier, investigate his ethics.
   ``I don't think it really warrants too much of an answer,''
Wright told reporters on Dec. 15, 1987 _ the day Rep. Newt Gingrich
called for a formal inquiry into what he called the corrupt and
blatantly unethical behavior of the veteran Texas Democrat.
   The chuckles have turned to anguish.
   The House took the proposal more seriously than Wright did. It
has driven the 48th speaker to the brink of resignation, which
leadership sources say could come as early as Wednesday.
   As for Gingrich, the Georgia Republican is now his party's House
whip, the second-ranking officer in the GOP leadership.
   Stories about Wright's financial connections in Texas began to
appear within six months after his election in December, 1986, to
succeed Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. as speaker.
   The New York Times and Newsweek magazine reported in June 1987
that Wright had intervened with Edwin J. Gray, chairman of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, on behalf of a savings and loan
executive who had been a longtime political supporter and whose S&amp;L
activities were under board scrutiny at the time.
   The board confirmed that Gray had held a lengthy meeting with
the executive at Wright's urging. Wright's office said Wright
merely ``encouraged him to make sure his agency was being fair.''
   Then, in September, the Washington Post reported that Wright was
receiving book royalties of 55 percent, five times higher than
those normally given to authors, from a friend's company that
received $265,000 from his 1986 campaign. Wright defended the deal,
saying it had been profitable both to him and to his publisher.
   Other news reports raised questions about Wright's efforts to
secure federal grants for a multimillion-dollar historical
renovation of the Fort Worth stockyards, in which his business
partner, George Mallick, was involved.
   Tired of answering questions, Wright announced on Oct. 16 that
he was putting his assets in a blind trust.
   Meanwhile, the new speaker was raising hackles on the Republican
side of the House.
   During a close vote on a Democratic deficit-cutting bill, Wright
``stopped the clock'' for nearly 10 minutes while finding a member
to switch votes so the Democratic leadership could avoid defeat. He
joked about it as his ``hidden ball play,'' but angry House
Republicans created a 14-member panel to seek ways to deal with the
crafty Texan.
   ``With Tip there was warmth and affection,'' said then-Rep.
Richard Cheney, R-Wyo., now secretary of defense. ``There are no
such feelings for Jim Wright.''
   Rep. Trent Lott of Mississippi, then the GOP whip and now a
senator, said the House was being run by ``Jim Wright and his
goons.''
   On May 18, 1988 _ just over a year ago _ president Fred
Wertheimer of Common Cause, a liberal-leaning public interest
lobby, announced that his group would ask the House ethics
committee to investigate whether Wright had violated
conflict-of-interest rules.
   Republicans said the announcement took much of the steam out of
charges that the demands for an investigation were just a political
vendetta.
   ``Having Common Cause come out changed the whole dynamics and
legitimized the issue,'' said Gingrich.
   On May 26, Gingrich and 71 House Republicans formally asked for
an ethics committee investigation. Wright promised cooperation and
said he was sure he had violated no rules.
   On June 10, the six Democrats and six Republicans on the
committee voted unanimously to conduct a preliminary inquiry of the
royalty arrangement for the book, Wright's use of public funds to
compensate an aide who worked on the book, his dealings with the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board in the savings and loan case, his
lobbying efforts for a constituent with whom he had an interest in
a gas well, his intervention on behalf of Texas Oil &amp; Gas Co. with
the Interior Department, and his use of a condominium in Fort Worth
provided by Mallick.
   More allegations came along. A longtime friend said he paid
Wright $5,000 for copies of his book as a legal way to get around
federal limits on campaign contributions. Wright listed more people
who bought bulk copies, including a Washington lobbyist, a Boston
insurance company and a fellow congressman. Records showed that
Wright had funneled more than $50,000 in business from his
congressional office to the printer who paid him his royalties.
Wright acknowledged selling 504 copies of the book to a Texas
university instead of accepting a $3,000 speaking fee that would
have violated House rules.
   On July 26, the committee named Chicago attorney Richard J.
Phelan to investigate, saying an outside counsel was needed to
assure a fair and objective probe.
   On Sept. 14, Wright testified for 5{ hours in closed session and
told reporters he believed he would be exonerated.
   In November, Phelan subpoenaed records on work that Wright's
wife, Betty, did for Mallightco, the partnership formed by Wright
and Mallick and their wives. Until 1984, she had been paid $18,000
a year as an advisor to the investment venture.
   When Congress reconvened Jan. 3, Wright was re-elected speaker
and pledged a spirit of bipartisanship.
   A month later, he was in new political hot water over what
critics called his awkward handling of a proposed congressional pay
raise, which failed after Wright sought to have it approved without
a House vote.
   On Feb. 21, Phelan submitted his final report to the House
committee.
   On April 13, amid reports that the panel was about to conclude
it had found reason to believe that he violated House rules, Wright
made an emotional defense of his conduct and his wife's in a
30-minute appearance before television cameras. He declined to
answer questions.
   Four days later, the committee formally charged the speaker with
69 violations of the chamber's rules, including what Rep. Julian
Dixon, D-Calif., the committee chairman, called ``a scheme to
evade'' limits on outside income through sales of the book. The
most serious allegation stemmed from the committee's conclusion
that Mallick, from whom Wright had accepted $145,000 in what the
committee viewed as gifts over a 10-year period, had a direct
interest in legislation.
   In a half-hour speech to a closed Democratic caucus on April 18,
Wright acknowledged that he ``may have made some mistakes in my
life,'' but vowed to fight the charges and win.
   And in a speech in Fort Worth on May 5, he said that ``the most
unethical behavior I have witnessed is that of those who, for their
own ravening ambitions, attempt to destroy the personal reputations
of political opponents.''
   On May 9 he lashed out at Phelan, accusing the outside counsel
of ``lack of professionalism and prevalence of distortion and
inaccuracy'' in his report. The next day, the Justice Department
announced it would review Wright's conduct after the House
investigation was completed.
   House Republican leader Bob Michel said Wright's problems had
contributed to a ``state of suspended animation'' in Congress but
the Democratic leader, Rep. Thomas Foley of Washington, said the
speaker was still ``fully involved.''
   By May 18, Wright's support in the House was eroding as even his
supporters talked of easing him from his post. ``It's time for a
leadership change,'' said Indiana Democrat Phil Sharp.
   The committee opened public hearings on May 23, with Wright's
lawyer, Stephen Susman, urging the panel to ``stand in the way of a
lynch mob'' and dismiss the most serious charges against the
speaker.
   Susman's arguments failed to move the committee. After a day of
fruitless negotiations, friends of Wright said Thursday the speaker
had decided to resign from Congress.
   ``I earnestly believe that I have committed no serious wrong,''
Wright said.

   Soviet television viewers got to tune into their
first National Basketball Association game on Saturday, even if it
wasn't Saturday's game.
   While American viewers watched the Detroit Pistons-Chicago Bulls
on live network television, Soviet viewers had to settle for the
April 28 playoff contest between the Phoenix Suns and the Denver
Nuggets.
   Citizens here already were glued to their television sets to
watch the live coverage of the blunt and bellicose debate in their
newly formed parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies.
   As the Tass news agency noted, ``The whole of the Soviet Union
seems to be listening to radio and watching television sets,
displaying a huge interest in the work of the Congress of People's
Deputies under way in Moscow.''
   During the afternoon break in the congressional session,
however, state-run television broadcast a first-round game from the
NBA's Western Conference playoffs.
   During timeouts, soft-drink commercials featuring rock music and
dancers and highlights from other NBA games were shown. One
graphic, in English, told Soviets they were watching ``America's
Game.''
   As the hour-long break at the Kremlin drew to a close, the clock
in Phoenix showed three seconds left on the clock. Tom Chambers of
the Suns sank two foul shots, leading Phoenix to a 104-103 victory.
   As soon as the NBA game ended, Soviet television switched back
to the Palace of Congresses, and the proceedings chaired by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev resumed.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet spy ships are eavesdropping off the
West Coast about two out of every three days, a sharp increase over
the past two years, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   In the early and mid-1980s, such Soviet monitoring occurred on
fewer than one out of 10 days, said Adm. David E. Jeremiah,
commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.
   Since 1987, specially designed Soviet vessels, called auxiliary
general intelligence ships, have been found two out of every three
days just beyond the 12-mile territorial limit that marks the
United States' offshore boundary, the Los Angeles Times reported in
Saturday's editions.
   ``There has been a significant increase in Soviet AGI activity
in the Pacific area since 1986,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Robert Anderson, a
spokesman for the Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
   ``This intelligence collection activity has included an
increased presence off the U.S. West Coast, especially off of
Southern California and the Hawaiian Islands,'' Anderson said.
   The increased activity has left some Navy analysts concerned
about the sincerity of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's commitment
to relaxing military tensions with the United States.
   Jeremiah and other ranking Navy officials have urged the United
States to maintain a close watch over the actions of Soviet naval
forces in the Pacific.
   Some analysts say the stepped-up spying may not be military in
nature. The Soviets may be more interested in monitoring U.S.
reaction to Gorbachev's policies or they may be seeking industrial
information Gorbachev could use in trying to bolster his country's
economy, according to the analysts.
   ``In this case, the Soviets appear to be gathering a lot of
technical and industrial intelligence that comes from satellite
downlinks,'' said Desmond J. Ball, a specialist in Soviet
intelligence collection at the Australian National University.

   A cyclone killed 17 people in eastern
India and then blew across the border to Bangladesh, where 15 more
people died, officials and news reports said Saturday.
   Winds racing at 80 mph hit the Indian coast late Friday, leaving
more than 50,000 people homeless, the Press Trust of India news
agency said.
   Finance Minister Asim Dasgupta of West Bengal state told
reporters 15 people died when at least 10,000 mud and straw houses
collapsed in Midnapore, the most severely hit district.
   But PTI quoted district police chief Ashok Abrol as saying 17
people were killed in Midnapore, 75 miles southwest of the state
capital, Calcutta.
   Dasgupta said mud houses were washed away as sea water breached
embankments and rushed into several coastal villages of Midnapore.
Communication links with the affected areas were snapped.
   The storm crossed over early Saturday to Bangladesh, where at
least eight people drowned when their boat was capsized by raging
winds, Bangladesh police said.
   Police said more than 500 huts were torn down by the winds that
battered at least 11 villages.
   Two people died when their houses collapsed, a police official
said by telephone from Manikganj. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Manikganj is 186 miles northwest of the Indian districts hit by
the cyclone.
   Five people were killed and more than 2,000 injured by the storm
in Tangail, 20 miles north of Manikganj, he said.

   Here are excerpts from speeches by members of the
Congress of People's Deputies after the defeat Saturday of the
Moscow reformists.
   Yuri Afanasyev, historian and leading figure in Memorial, a
society investigating the nation's Stalinist past:
   ``I had a depressing view of yesterday's work of our congress .
.. I thoroughly studied the list of candidates to the Supreme
Soviet (the full-time legislature elected by the congress). I must
say, and I am convinced of this, that if we take into account the
level of qualification compared to the tasks the Supreme Soviet
must decide ... we have formed a Brezhnev-Stalin Supreme Soviet.
   ``Now, about the majority that has formed at the congress. This
also depresses me ... I am addressing you all, the
aggressive-obedient majority, and you, Mikhail Sergeyevich
(Gorbachev), who is either attentively listening to the majority or
skillfully manipulating it. We can continue the work the same way,
we may be obedient ... but let us not forget those who sent us here
to the congress. And they sent us here not for that ... but to
drastically change the situation in the country.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Gavril Popov, liberal economist who was among those defeated:
   ``Deputies with a democratic orientation inevitably formed a
minority at the congress. We knew this. We had two choices as to
how to act. First, to try to play the role of opposition, and
second, to become involved in the constructive work of the
congress. We chose the second.
   ``But from the very beginning our work has met with some
disbelief and prejudice ... The documents we prepared have not been
copied so far and distributed among the deputies.
   ``It is becoming more and more evident that the apparatus
clearly wants to retaliate, clear that it wants to impose its own
way of work at the Congress. In these conditions it is impossible
to support the variant we first chose, it would not be understood
either by our country or by those who elected us.
   ``That is why we have to think about changing our positions. A
group of deputies considers it necessary to withdraw from the
Moscow delegation. We are going to form an ... independent deputies
group and invite all deputies to join us.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Yevgeny Meshalkin, Ministry of Health official in Siberia,
member of the Soviet Peace Committee:
   ``Those who are shouting about the disastrous situation did not
make any constructive suggestions, only demands for freedom. Why
don't they understand that we shouldn't behave like pirates, who
capture the ship of state, intend to break it into regions, small
craft they plan to sail in turbulent international waters?''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Ales Adamovich, a reformer famous for his novels about the
horrors of World War II in Byleorussia:
   ``I heard once, the people stopped drinking, sobered up a
little, looked around and asked, `Where is the czar?' What does it
mean, woke up? I witnessed myself during the war that people, very
often out of fear, went into a deep sleep ... It was a kind of
protective reaction of the body. That was how people were killed in
the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, while the rest hibernated.
   ``And what did we find when we finally woke up? ... We realize
that after this long sleep we are not a modern state that sets an
example for others but an underdeveloped superstate which is losing
its ability to develop, to transform the mentally crippled
administrative child into a normal, social organism, to create a
working economy.
   ``People have great hopes for this congress. Does our work
justify their hopes? ... Won't we be forced to buy dark glasses, so
that at the end of the congress, we can slip like shadows through
the crowds which stand each day outside the Kremlin?
   ``The supreme power in the country should belong to the people,
but in reality it belongs to the party ... Without the power to
exercise control (over the budget and the party apparatus), the
congress won't be able to do much.
   ``And it goes without saying that the Congress of Deputies can
vote no-confidence in the government ... if it is obviously unable
to fulfill its duties.
   ``The windows of Western shops are full of goods. In our shop
windows, it would not be a bad idea to hang the portraits of
ministers, the agriculture minister in the butcher's shop, and so
on.''

   Leonid Kravchenko, director-general of the official news agency
Tass:
   ``At Tass we read attentively what the foreign press think about
the Congress. Already during the first day, the Western agencies
said radicals attempted to impose their point of view during the
discussion of procedural questions ... Frankly, I did not believe
in all this, but here is what we have now _ the speeches of
Afanasyev and Popov.
   ``I was amazed to hear such phrases as the Brezhnev-Stalin wing
... I know these comrades as persistent supporters of democracy.
And democracy implies patience for dissent. When such impatience is
shown toward an alternatively thinking majority ... I start to
doubt whether they persistently defend democracy.
   ``We have already answered the question `Who is guilty?'
completely enough. It is high time to answer the questions `What to
do?' and `How to do it?'''

   Alexander N. Kraiko, non-party member, chief researcher at
Moscow aviation research institute, one of defeated reformers:
   ``Comrades, we should realize that Boris Yeltsin is the first
candidate of the Russian Federation. Not only was he elected by
five million Muscovites, but at almost 2,000 enterprises he was the
nominated candidate. In this case, it means that the Congress
neglects the opinion of the people, this is a discreditation of the
Congress ... In order not to have confrontation between us here and
between us and our people, the Presidium and our leadership have to
make necessary efforts to ensure that people like Boris Yeltsin
will take an active part in political life, not only at meetings,
but also here. I call on Mikhail Sergeyevich to do this.''

   Vladimir I. Kirillov, a young researcher at an institute in
Voronezh in southern Russia, who introduced himself as one of those
who gave Afanasyev a standing ovation:
   ``What is politics? It is the art of the possible ... We can now
see what our possibilities are here now. Here is Boris Yeltsin,
esteemed by me, who said that he had become unemployed (Yeltsin
last week quit his post as a first deputy construction minister.)
But I think that in our society he does a very important job. In
fact, he is determining the level of democracy in our society.

   The new Soviet congress dealt reformists a major
setback Saturday by rejecting maverick Boris Yeltsin and several
other prominent reformers who were seeking seats on the powerful
Supreme Soviet legislature.
   Thousands of Muscovites disappointed with the results gathered
for a rally that lasted through the night, and reformers in
congress vowed to form an opposition bloc to challenge the ruling
Communist Party.
   ``Down with the bloodsuckers who prey on the people!'' roared
one speaker at the rally.
   The furor was set off when the 2,250-seat Congress of People's
Deputies chose which of its members would serve on the new Supreme
Soviet, a full-time, 542-seat legislature.
   The election results and blunt debate that followed were
televised live.
   ``The supreme power in the country should belong to the people,
but in reality it belongs to the party,'' said Ales Adamovich, a
writer from Byelorussia and member of the congress.
   During a recess, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sought to
reassure Soviets accustomed to decades of empty institutional
ritual that such clashes of opinion are to be expected.
   ``One need not panic,'' he said in remarks broadcast later on
national television. ``We cannot sit ceremoniously at the meetings
knowing that outside the hall, there is a stormy life with a lot of
problems.''
   Congressional deputies voted Friday to fill the Supreme Soviet
seats from among 573 candidates chosen by congress deputies from
their home regions. The results were announced Saturday.
   The congress rejected an 11th-hour attempt by Gorbachev to have
his protege, Anatoly I. Lukyanov, installed as vice president.
Weary deputies loudly complained the president's choice was being
forced through, and Gorbachev agreed to put the matter off until
Monday.
   In secret balloting for the Supreme Soviet, congressional
deputies elected a number of reform advocates from the tiny Baltic
republics, whose representatives nominated only as many candidates
as they had seats.
   Moscow deputies, however, nominated 55 candidates for their 29
seats, and Yeltsin and other prominent Moscow-based reformers were
among the losers. Also defeated were sociologist Tatyana
Zaslavskaya, economist Gavril Popov, advocate for the handicapped
Ilya Zaslavsky, historian Sergei Stankevich and biologist Alexei
Yablokov.
   Many old-style candidates, among them former cosmonaut Svetlana
Savitskaya, defeated the reformers.
   Yeltsin scored a landslide victory in Moscow in spring elections
for the Congress of People's Deputies and is among the country's
most popular political figures. He said he was saddened by the
results but indicated he may challenge Lukyanov for the vice
presidency.
   ``I must fight to the end,'' Yeltsin told reporters. ``I
wouldn't throw away any job.''
   Several thousand Muscovites gathered in a stadium parking lot to
protest Yeltsin's defeat. One speaker, teacher Vladimir Kuznetsov,
said he sent a telegram to Gorbachev telling him, ``I have less and
less respect for you and more and more'' for progressive Moscow
deputies.
   ``But is it really life, if it's in chains? But is it really an
election, if it's in fetters?'' read one placard.
   But in the Palace of Congresses, many deputies applauded as Yuri
A. Osipyan, chairman of the vote-counting commission, announced in
a droning voice the Moscow reformers' defeat.
   Leonid Kravchenko, director-general of the official news agency
Tass, defended the election.``For God's sake, let's not have chaos.
Everywhere and in everything there should be order.''
   Yevgeny Meshalkin, a Siberian health official, accused the
reformers of sour grapes.
   ``They find themselves in the minority, and the result cannot
satisfy them,'' he said. ``They instigate work aimed at breaking
the congress into factions.''
   Before the balloting in the first competitively elected
parliament in 70 years, some deputies complained the nominating
procedure had been rigged to keep party and government officials in
power.
   ``The apparatus has undoubtedly won,'' Popov declared to his
fellow deputies.
   He called on progressives nationwide to form an ``independent
deputies' group'' to fight Communist Party and state bureaucrats.
   Popov's declaration could lead to the first opposition faction
in a Soviet legislature, where for decades the Kremlin leadership
has imposed its will unimpeded by opposition.
   Yeltsin garnered a narrow majority, with 1,185 deputies
supporting him and 964 against, but he ran last among 12 candidates
for the 11 seats reserved for the Russian federation in one of the
Supreme Soviet's two chambers, the 271-seat Soviet of Nationalities.
   Yeltsin's defeat was a severe setback. His attacks on official
privilege, calls for a better life for average Soviets and his
suggestion that the party should discuss permitting a multi-party
democracy have made him a special target of the party's Old Guard.
   Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, the only member of the ruling party
Politburo to stand as a candidate and the president of the Russian
federation, outpolled Yeltsin with 1,388 votes.
   During the afternoon break, Soviet viewers got to tune into
their first National Basketball Association game _ even if it was a
month old.
   Soviet viewers had to settle for the April 28 playoff contest
between the Phoenix Suns and the Denver Nuggets.
   As the break at the Kremlin drew to a close, Tom Chambers of the
Suns sank two foul shots, leading Phoenix to a 104-103 victory.

   President Bush assured Pope John Paul II on
Saturday that the United States is making progress to reduce
armaments and is committed to helping spur economic and political
reforms in the pontiff's homeland and elsewhere across Eastern
Europe.
   The pope, after nearly an hour of private talks with Bush in the
papal library, praised the American president's commitment ``to
liberate the youth of America from the destructive forces of drug
abuse'' and to alleviate poverty.
   The pope called for renewed efforts to battle the ``moral
crisis'' afflicting society all over the world.
   A senior Vatican official, who requested anonymity, said the
sweeping changes in communist Eastern Europe and the civil war in
Lebanon were the main themes of the private talks between the two
men.
   ``While we are still far from realizing the Biblical injunction
to turn our swords into plowshares, we have made progress in
reducing armaments, and in decreasing the threat of war,'' Bush
told the pope.
   Turning to the civil war in Lebanon, Bush said, ``We've heard
your eloquent appeals for an end to the violence in Lebanon, and my
heart, too, aches for the people of that once peaceful land.''
   The Vatican visit came near the end of the first full day of
Bush's trip, which takes him to Brussels on Sunday for a summit
with NATO allies divided over how best to proceed on arms talks
with the Soviet Union.
   As a Pole and head of a church that plays an important role in
eastern Europe, John Paul has an unusual vantage from which to
offer advice on the changes taking place in the region.
   Both the pope and the president recalled passages from Bush's
inauguration speech. The pope approved Bush's declaration that the
only proper use of power is to serve people, and Bush said anew
that ``a new breeze is blowing'' across the world and bringing
greater freedom.
   ``May God bless America, and make her strong in her defense of
human dignity and in her service to life,'' including the life of
``the weakest and most defenseless ones, those as yet unborn,'' the
pope said, repeating an anti-abortion plea he also made at the end
of his last U.S. pilgrimage in 1987.
   Bush thanked him ``for this opportunity to visit with you to
share in your wisdom, and I assure you of our intent to work ever
more fervently for peace, justice and freedom throughout the
world.''
   Bush, scheduled to visit Poland in July, noted the accords
between the government and the opposition aimed at providing
greater freedom and the communist state's agreement to give the
Roman Catholic Church legal status.
   ``This triumph represents the first full normalization of
church-state relations in any communist state _ and it is a tribute
to your enduring commitment to freedom,'' Bush said.
   `'As you know, I recently announced a package of financial
measures that signaled our active engagement in encouraging
economic and political reform in Poland and elsewhere in eastern
Europe,'' he added.
   The president's wife, Barbara, dressed in a black suit and small
black veil, joined her husband and the pope after their private
talk. The Bushes later toured the Sistine Chapel together.
   A 33-member presidential entourage also got to meet the pope,
including the military officer who carries the black briefcase
known as the ``football'' that contains the codes to be used in
event of a nuclear attack.
   When the officer lined up to shake hands with the pontiff, he
left the briefcase at his seat.
   Later, addressing 250 American seminarians, Bush said he and the
pope discussed ``broad questions of peace, freedom and justice as
they apply or ought to apply all over the world.''
   ``It's a talk that I'll long remember,'' said Bush, an
Episcopalian. ``I leave once again inspired by his moral and
spiritual leadership.''
   The seminarians burst into a chorus of ``God Bless America''
after Bush spoke.
   As the pope and Bush talked, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker
and Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, met with
Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Agostino Casaroli and other top
Vatican officials.
   John Paul will meet with Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev here in
November, the first time a Soviet Communist party chief will sit
down with the leader of the world's 850 million Roman Catholics.
   The pope has spoken favorably if cautiously of Gorbachev's
policies of glasnost and perestroika to open up and reform Soviet
society. John Paul has expressed strong support of attempts by the
independent Polish labor union Solidarity to do the same in his
homeland.
   No world leader encounters so wide a range of visitors as John
Paul. On the eve of the Bush visit, he met with an official
Bulgarian delegation, Lebanon-bound Cardinal John O'Connor of New
York and a Cuban official who reportedly came with an invitation
for the first-ever papal visit to the communist island nation.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Saturday
he opposed postponing proposed U.S.-Soviet talks on short-range
nuclear weapons as a possible compromise in the dispute within NATO
over the issue.
   In a surprise move, Kohl flew later to the Netherlands for talks
with Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers over the division in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Lubbers has offered to mediate the dispute, in which West
Germany is trying to persuade the United States to agree to early
talks with the Soviets on short-range atomic arsenals.
   A government spokesman told The Associated Press Kohl's talks
with Lubbers were part of an earlier planned meeting with Holland's
governing Christian Democrats to discuss a number of topics. But
there had been no announcement of Kohl's plans to confer with
Lubbers.
   Speaking to reporters in the southern city of Nuremberg before
leaving for the Netherlands, Kohl said superpower negotiations on
the short-range atomic arsenals ``cannot be postponed into the
distant future.''
   ``We are the front-line country in NATO. It is clear that we
should be speaking up for our interests,'' Kohl said.
   The United States, seeking to avert a NATO split, has reversed a
firm stand against such negotiations and agreed to talks with the
Soviets at an unspecified time on reducing the number of
short-range nuclear weapons.
   Also Saturday, Kohl's junior coalition partners made a veiled
threat to pull out of the government if the chancellor agreed to
unacceptable compromises on the issue during NATO summit that opens
Monday.
   Kohl is caught between liberal elements within his coalition and
conservatives who fear the internal feud endangers the Western
alliance.
   Public opinion polls show most Germans want the Lance atomic
rockets removed from German soil rather than modernized, as NATO
advocates.
   Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg reiterated West Germany's
call for U.S. talks with the Soviets on the issue, the Bild
newspaper reported. But it said Stoltenberg also noted West Germany
can't formulate European defense policy alone.
   ``We must connect our interests to the clear goal of coming to a
common position within NATO through give and take,'' Soltenberg
said in the interview to be published Sunday.
   Bonn and Washington have tried to heal their rift over Kohl's
call for early talks on the short-range missiles. The United States
and Britain say the talks should not occur while the Warsaw Pact
has superiority in conventional forces.
   West German newspapers said Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher on Tuesday threatened to pull his minority Free Democratic
Party out of the governming coalition if Kohl softens his stand.
   Members of the coalition are Kohl's Christian Democratic Union,
its conservative Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union,
and the business-oriented Free Democrats.
   Some members of Kohl's government, including Stoltenberg,
reportedly have been angered by Genscher's aggressiveness in the
NATO dispute. Newspaper reports said Stoltenberg noted Washington
has agreed in principle to start up negotiations on short-range
nuclear weapons and the question now is when those talks should
begin.

   A posse armed with shotguns killed about
50 pigeons after changing from lighter ammunition that was ``pretty
much bouncing off'' the birds, police said.
   A one-block area was sealed off and police authorized eight
people to shoot the pigeons, which had been damaging buildings and
posing a health hazard to the community, said Police Chief Elliot
Arens.
   ``Last week we used 8-shot and it was pretty much bouncing off.
We were hitting them and the feathers would fly and they just kept
going,'' Arens said. ``This time we used 4-shot and were knocking
them out pretty good.''
   The group bagged about 50 birds Thursday night. An earlier
outing claimed only 15, Arens said.
   The City Council approved the pigeon shoot, Arens said, after
getting a letter from a doctor and the city attorney confirming the
need to eradicate the birds.
   The pigeon plague descended on this northeastern Nebraska
community after the razing of an old bank building, which they used
as a roost.

   Politics wasn't the first career choice of
Tony Coelho.
   The California Democrat, whose savvy and partisan skills helped
him climb to the highest ranks of Congress, originally wanted to be
a Catholic priest.
   But while Coelho, the son of a San Joaquin Valley dairy farmer,
was attending college at Loyola University in Los Angeles, he was
rejected for the priesthood after he discovered he had epilepsy.
   At that point, Coelho got a lucky break. Dolores Hope, wife of
the famed comedian Bob Hope, heard about his problems and persuaded
her husband to offer help.
   Hope suggested that Coelho could serve the public in another way
_ politics.
   The young college graduate came to Washington, went into the
office of his congressman, Rep. B.F. Sisk, and got hired.
   Within five years, Coelho became Sisk's administrative
assistant, his top aide, and when Sisk retired in 1978, Coelho was
ready at the age of 36. He ran for Sisk's seat and won easily,
polling 60 percent, a margin that rose with succeeding elections.
   He announced Saturday that he will resign June 15 _ his 47th
birthday. He said he decided to resign to spare himself and his
party the ordeal of a protracted ethics investigation into a
$100,000 junk bond deal in 1986.
   In the House, Coelho showed himself to be an adept politician
and quickly won a reputation for fierce partisanship. In his first
term, he was picked for the Agriculture Committee, a choice seat
for a freshman congressman and a key post for a man from his
district.
   While taking care of his district, Coelho also kept an eye on
the internal politics of the House and when the chairmanship of the
House Democratic Campaign Committee opened up in 1981, he jumped in
quickly and won the job.
   Coelho had few contenders for the position. The panel had been
outspent by a large margin by its House Republican counterpart,
Ronald Reagan had just been elected president and swept a
Republican-controlled Senate into power along with him, and House
Democrats were reeling.
   But Coelho, working long hours, fought back.
   He worked on building a large direct mail, fund-raising list and
also traveled widely across the country, beating the bushes and
trying to convince businessmen and others with money that the
Democrats _ not the Republicans _ were the party of the future.
   Coelho also courted the political action committees _ the PACs
which control millions of dollars. He reminded them which party _
his _ controlled the House.
   Coelho's efforts paid off. The committee began raising more
money, and its candidates did well. In 1982, when the GOP had been
expected to make inroads into the House Democratic margin, the
Democrats picked up 26 seats. Two years later, when a popular
Reagan was winning a second term with 59 percent of the vote,
Coelho's money helped hold Democratic losses to only 15 seats.
   In 1986, the Democrats picked up a net of five seats and Coelho
was looking to move higher in the House leadership after the
retirement of popular Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr.
   When Jim Wright of Texas, then majority leader, succeeded
O'Neill as speaker, Coelho moved up to the whip's job, the
third-ranking position. It put him firmly on the path to greater
power.
   But he was brought down by ethics problems that began shortly
after it was reported that he had not listed on his 1986 disclosure
forms a loan he obtained to buy $100,000 in high-yield junk bonds.
   More questions were raised about that loan, even as Coelho was
spreading the word that he wanted to replace Tom Foley as majority
leader _ the party's second-ranking leadership position _ when
Foley, as expected, moved up to the speakership.
   Sisk, his mentor, said Saturday he was saddened by the situation.
   ``Basically, he and I were very close _ I guess like a son
because I never had a son,'' Sisk said. ``I feel badly because I
think he still had great possibilities from the standpoint of
things that could develop, but it didn't work out this way.
   ``In the final analysis, I feel very strongly that he will prove
out to be honest and dedicated. I think the time will come when he
will have additional opportunities,'' Sisk said.

   Two Marine helicopters collided Saturday
morning during maneuvers about 70 miles east of here, killing two
of the nine Marines aboard, authorities said.
   The other seven Marines escaped injury, authorities said. The
names of the dead were being withheld pending notification of
family members.
   Officials at the Fallon Naval Air Station said the helicopters
were performing routine training maneuvers when they collided at
8:45 a.m. in an uninhabited desert area near the base.
   Olin Briggs, a spokesman for the air station, said there were
four Marines in one helicopter and five in the other. The ones who
died were in the four-person craft.
   Churchill County Sheriff Bill Lawry said one of the helicopters
received major damage while the other came away with moderate
damage.
   Authorities declined to speculate on the cause of the accident
but said an investigation would begin immediately.
   The CH-46 Sea Knights belonged to the Marine Medium Helicopter
Squadron, which is permanently assigned to the Marine Corps Air
Station in El Toro, Calif.
   The squadron arrived at the Fallon station last week to
participate in operation ``High-Roller,'' a two-week exercise
designed to test combat readiness for the 4th Marine Air Wing.

   When the head of the Italian Communist party visited
Washington two weeks ago he didn't get to meet with any
administration officials. On Saturday he got to shake hands with
President Bush.
   Achille Occhetto joined other Italian leaders in greeting the
president at a glittering state dinner.
   Meanwhile, out on the streets of Rome, leftist demonstrators
protesting the Bush visit clashed with police, and 18 were detained
at the central police headquarters for questioning.
   A band of about 50 demonstrators hurled cobblestones and fired
steel balls from slingshots at riot police, who fought back with
truncheons, the Italian News Agency ANSA reported.
   Three police officers were reported slightly injured and a
60-year-old Italian woman was hospitalized with leg and face
bruises after being accidentally caught up in the melee a mile from
the Vatican, where Bush was meeting with Pope John Paul II.
   The protest was organized by small leftist groups including the
Proletarian Democracy Party upset about plans for Italy to host a
unit of F-16 fighters being forced out of Spain.
   The 120 guests at the black-tie dinner for Bush in the 16th
century Villa Madama included the leaders of major parties invited
by Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita, a Christian Democrat.
   Occhetto not only got to shake hands with the president, but was
seated next to Ruth Rabb, wife of U.S. Ambassador Maxwell Rabb.
   During the toasts, Mrs. Rabb and Occhetto clinked glasses and
smiled. Occhetto also applauded after a vibrantly pro-Atlantic
speech by De Mita, who warned against neutralism in the face of
Soviet offers to cut armaments.
   De Mita also offered his support to the United States in its
efforts to re-establish democracy in Panama and condemned ``the
serious violation of the rules of democracy recently perpetrated by
General (Manuel) Noriega.''
   Occhetto, 53, made the first visit to the United States ever by
an Italian Communist Party head seeking to present a new image of
the largest communist party in the West and Italy's No. 2 party.
   The party has been locked out of the Christian
Democrat-dominated government since 1947, and successive U.S.
administrations have regarded the party with suspicion. In past
years, some members have been denied visas.
   Occhetto got a visa and met with leaders of the House and
Senate. But the government called the visit ``private'' and
arranged no meetings with administration officials.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev took a break from
fierce parliamentary debate Saturday to reassure Soviets used to
empty institutional ritual that the open clash of opinions was
perfectly normal.
   ``One need not panic,'' he told a knot of fellow
parliamentarians during a recess at the Congress of People's
Deputies at the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses.
   ``We cannot sit ceremoniously at the meetings knowing that
outside the hall there is a stormy life with a lot of problems,''
Gorbachev said.
   His comments were carried on national television. Soviet
citizens have been keenly following the fiery proceedings in the
congress, a sharp contrast to the traditional rubber-stamp
practices.
   Lawmakers used to meet in Moscow for only three or four days a
year, unanimously pass legislation put before them by the Communist
Party leadership and deliver ovations to top officials.
   On Saturday legislators made statements that would have been
inconceivable at an official forum even a year ago. The statements
included Byelorussian writer Ales Adamovich's claim that power in
the Soviet Union is held not by the people but by the Communist
Party.
   Even Gorbachev fell victim to the new combativeness of Soviet
parliamentarians when, in an 11th-hour move, he tried to get the
congress to re-elect his protege, Anatoly I. Lukyanov, to the vice
presidency.
   Deputies objected that they were tired after three days of
debate, and wanted more than one candidate to pick from. Gorbachev
backed down, and the congress adjourned until Monday.
   In informal talks with other deputies, Gorbachev said a clash of
views was normal but legislators should respect those they disagree
with.
   ``It is all right that passions are stirring,'' he said. ``When
people talk about the country, the people, their fate, business,
what to do to improve the situation, we have to show respect.''
   Gorbachev said Soviets have been sending letters and telegrams
asking ``what is the congress doing?''
   ``At first glance, the work of the congress might look
disorganized, deputies lacking political culture, even starting to
place others in various categories,'' he said, but the newly
created parliament is only beginning.
   ``The most important thing is to move things,'' he said.

   Arctic air plunged south from Canada on Saturday, bringing
bitter winds and the possibility of snowfall to the Northwest, and
another cold front accompanied by showers and thunderstorms swept
through the eastern United States.
   Much of the rest of the nation, however, enjoyed sunny skies.
   In the Northwest, the bitter winds were expected to bring snow
to higher elevations through Sunday; and a snow advisory was posted
for the Cascade Mountains of Oregon.
   Cloudy skies hung over much of the region early Saturday
afternoon. Northern California and southwestern Oregon were
drenched with numerous showers.
   A cold front in the eastern United States brought showers and
thunderstorms to the middle Atlantic coast region and parts of New
England. A thunderstorm in Millville, N.J., whipped winds to 48 mph.
   The same cold front sent showers through southern Arkansas into
north- central Texas.
   The rest of the nation had dry weather, with clear skies from
the desert Southwest through the middle and upper Mississippi
Valley and to the Ohio Valley and the upper Great Lakes.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 42
degrees at Sexton Summit, Ore., to 97 degrees at Charleston, S.C.,
and Jacksonville, Fla.
   The low Saturday was 27 degrees at Yellowstone National Park,
Wyo.
   Sunday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered
across the middle and upper Mississippi Valley and the northern
Plains region; showers from the upper half of the Rocky Mountain
region to the northern and central Pacific Coast, with snow
possible in higher elevations; widely scattered thunderstorms
through the Florida peninsula; windy conditions to the upper half
of the Mississippi Valley; and fair to partly sunny skies across
the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures were forecast above 80 degrees from Southern
California through the southern and central Plains region to the
southern Atlantic Coast; in the 90s from the southwestern deserts
across much of Texas to the Florida peninsula; in the 60s from
upper Michigan to New England; below 70 degrees from the northern
and central Pacific Coast to Montana; and in the 50s and upper 40s
from the northern Rockies to the northern half of the Plateau
region.

   Frankfurt's Jewish community said
Saturday it is taking court action against a city councilman from
an ultrarightist party for reportedly saying ``Jews are plundering
us again.''
   The city prosecutor's office has said it is investigating
legislator Erich Gutjahr for possibly violating German laws with
his alleged statements, printed Friday in the Frankfurt Allgemeine
newspaper.
   In a telex to the news media on Saturday, the Frankfurt Jewish
community said it was starting its own action to try to get a court
to bring charges against Gutjahr, saying he had ``stirred up
anti-Semitic prejudices.''
   Under West German law, citizens have standing to file a
complaint asking justice officials to bring someone to trial.
   Several members of the city council on Friday demanded the
resignation of Gutjahr, a 78-year-old member of the rightist
National Party of Germany (NPD).
   The NPD, whose views are often likened to those of German
neo-Nazi groups, won seven city council seats in local elections
last March, giving the ultrarightist party a minority voice in the
body.
   Gutjahr was quoted as saying, ``Jews have bought up half of the
city. The Jews are plundering us again. Something must be done
about this.''
   The elderly councilman said he was not anti-Semitic and only
wants to protect ``German interests,'' the Allgemeine reported.

   Queen Elizabeth II of England, whose pursuits
include horse racing, got her first look Saturday at a month-old
foal that she is boarding at a Kentucky farm.
   The queen ``commented on how frisky and bouncy the foal was,''
said Mike Cline, the manager of Lane's End farm. ``She remarked
about how much personality the foal has.''
   The queen was in Kentucky to look at five mares she is boarding
at the Lane's End and Mill Ridge farms, and to see some stallions
for possible breeding.
   Lane's End farmhands Tim Thore and Callan Strouss brought the
young thoroughbred and Highclere, who foaled the colt on April 29,
into a walking area for the queen to examine.
   The playful foal pranced around his mother while the queen
looked on, apparently delighted. The queen patted the mare and gave
her some mints. But she stayed clear of the foal.
   This is the third time in five years that the queen has stayed
at the neatly manicured farm, located about 10 miles west of
Lexington on gently rolling pastureland.
   ``I think most of us are relaxed with her being here,'' said
Cline. ``Since she's a horsewoman, it's been easy being around
her.''
   Racing manager Lord Carnarvon, who accompanied the queen, said
she breeds horses in Kentucky for speed in races that range from 1\
miles to 1{ miles. He said she is putting together next year's
mating list.
   After her arrival Friday afternoon, the queen attended a small
dinner at Lane's End that included British Ambassador Antony
Acland. She will return to England on Tuesday.

   President Bush met Saturday with Pope John Paul II
and leaders of Italy's caretaker government while his spokesman
said flatly that the United States will not reduce its European
troop levels without consulting its NATO allies.
   ``In the final analysis, this is something that the president
will want to discuss directly with his partners,'' Marlin
Fitzwater, the spokesman, said.
   He suggested a cutback was probable, saying he did not ``want to
signal anything in advance,'' but made it clear that no U.S. troops
will be withdrawn without the endorsement of NATO leaders at the
summit that begins Monday in Brussels.
   Bush told Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita that, in concert with
the NATO allies, he intends to seize on the ``openings'' offered by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for arms reductions,
Fitzwater said.
   The pope, meanwhile, praised Bush for his stand against
narcotics, calling drug use ``a moral crisis.'' Bush said he
benefited from John Paul II's ``wise counsel.''
   The president also said he shares the Vatican's concern for
world peace. ``We've made progress in reducing armaments,'' Bush
said.
   Later, at a state dinner with De Mita, Bush announced that
Italians soon will be able to visit the United States without
obtaining visas, joining Britain and Japan in a U.S. program giving
easier entry privileges to residents of selected countries.
   Among the guests who shook hands with Bush at the glittering
dinner was Italian Communist Party head Achille Occhetto. But
elsewhere, leftist demonstrators clashed with riot police in
protest of the Bush visit. Three police and a woman bystander were
injured, and 18 demonstrators were detained for questioning.
   On Monday in Brussels, the president will meet with the leaders
of the 15 U.S. allies in NATO.
   Many of them are eager to have the United States match a series
of weapons reductions pledged by Gorbachev. Fitzwater said the
latest Soviet moves, which include a willingness to impose limits
on Soviet troops in Eastern Europe, presented ``some opportunities,
and those are openings that need to be discussed with the allies
and will be.''
   The White House spokesman, in a subtle policy shift, said the
United States was now willing to negotiate over troop levels in the
East-West talks being held in Vienna.
   Until now, the NATO allies have tried to concentrate the talks
on tanks, artillery and armored personnel carriers. The Soviets, on
the other hand, have insisted on dealing directly with the levels
of NATO and Warsaw Pact forces.
   Fitzwater, responding to Gorbachev's acceptance of equal
ceilings in the two alliances, said ``it's a matter for
discussion.''
   His comments Saturday came after reports that the United States
was considering a reduction in the 305,000 to 325,000 U.S. troops
in Europe.
   Fitzwater took a similar tack in responding to questions about
whether the United States is preparing to lift economic sanctions
imposed on the Soviet Union in 1980 after the invasion of
Afghanistan.
   ``The president will be discussing a variety of ideas, many of
them never presented before,'' Fitzwater said.
   Discussing U.S. forces, Fitzwater said flatly that ``The United
States will not unilaterally withdraw troops from Europe.''
   John Sununu, the White House chief of staff, said in an
interview to be telecast Sunday by Cable News Network that ``You're
not going to see unilateral action taken by one country or another.
It will be an alliance action.''
   A senior U.S. official said, meanwhile, that any action would be
taken as part of the Conventional Forces in Europe, or CFE, talks
in Vienna.
   Any suggestion of a U.S. troop withdrawal is bound to have an
impact on the allies as they consider a West German drive _ opposed
by Bush _ for negotiations to reduce ground-based nuclear missiles
in Europe.
   On Saturday, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned against
delays in negotiating missile reductions, but British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher _ a strong supporter of the U.S.
position _ argued that such cuts would be aimed at ``the jugular of
NATO.''
   Italy is a strong supporter of the United States inside the
Western alliance on most defense issues. While Bush cannot count on
the Italians to side with him in opposing nuclear missile
negotiations with Moscow, his two-day stop reflects strong ties
with Rome.
   Accompanied by Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Brent
Scowcroft, the national security adviser, Bush met with Prime
Minister De Mita at a 16th century hillside villa and then had
lunch with President Francesco Cossiga in a Wuirinale Palace hall.
   He announced the liberalized U.S. entry rules for Italians at a
state dinner with the prime minister, saying, ``In the future,
Italians who wish to visit our country, whether as tourists or on
business, will no longer need to apply for visas, and we look
forward to that day.'' His announcement prompted warm applause at
the black-tie event.
   He also held an unscheduled meeting with Bettino Craxi, the
Socialist Party leader and prime minister from 1983 to 1987. Bush's
audience with the Pope later at the Vatican gave a colorful and
photogenic twist to his first day in Europe as president.
   Bush met first with the pope in his library. The president's
wife, Barbara, dressed in a black suit, and more than 30
presidential aides joined them toward the end.
   The pope praised Bush for his deep commitment ``to liberate the
youth of America from the destructive forces of drug abuse and to
alleviate poverty at home and abroad.'' He said these problems were
``only symptoms of a deeper moral crisis eating away at the very
texture of society in almost every part of the world.''
   Bush, discussing efforts for world peace, assured the pontiff,
``While we're still far from realizing the biblical injunction to
turn our swords into plowshares, we've made progress in reducing
armaments and in decreasing the threat of war.''
   Later, Bush told about 200 American seminarians studying here:
``You remember the old American expression often said of a guru or
individual, `He hasn't got a prayer.' Well, I am delighted to meet
an audience about whom that will never be said.''

<HEAD>Cardinal O'Connor Arrives in Lebanon on Hostage Mission</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Recasts 4th graf to CORRECT that Waite not a cleric but a church
envoy.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York
arrived Saturday on a visit aimed at focusing the world's attention
on foreign hostages held in Lebanon and on the bitter fighting
between Christian and Moslem forces.
   O'Connor said he did not come to Lebanon to negotiate on behalf
of the United States but he would gladly meet with the hostages,
even if that meant entering the Moslem sector of Beirut.
   ``I hope that they can hear my voice or can see me or can read
that the people of our country have not forgotten them. They're in
our prayers,'' he said.
   Among the missing foreigners is Anglican church envoy Terry
Waite, who came on a mission to try to gain the release of
hostages. He disappeared in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1988, after leaving
his hotel for a meeting with captors of some of the victims.
   Before O'Connor arrived, Syrian gunners shelled the Christian
coastline north of Beirut, despite an appeal by Arab leaders to
observe a cease-fire.
   More than 350 people have been killed and nearly 1,400 wounded
since March 8 when the latest round of fighting broke in Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war.
   O'Connor said the fighting in Lebanon, in which the Christian
forces are heavily outnumbered and outgunned by the Syrians and
their allies, has been largely ignored by the U.S. and world media.
   ``This is extraordinary, that a nation is being destroyed, a
religious body is being almost obliterated and an organism where so
many religions lived harmoniously is being torn apart and we really
haven't responded,'' he said.
   O'Connor, who came in his role as President of the Roman
Catholic Near West Welfare Association, flew in from Larnaca,
Cyprus, aboard a military helicopter provided by Christian leader
Gen. Michel Aoun.
   The helicopter landed after sunset at the hilltop monastery of
Bkirki, seat of Maronite Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, nine
miles north of Beirut.
   Sfeir, spiritual head of the Maronite sect that has dominated
the government since Lebanon gained independence from France in
1943, will be O'Connor's host during his three-day visit.
   O'Connor, who ignored State Department objections to the trip,
stopped in Rome on Friday for talks with Pope John Paul II. He came
to Bkirki with a Vatican passport and visa to sidestep a U.S. ban
on travel to Lebanon.
   He told reporters in Larnaca the pope is distressed about the
Lebanese crisis. ``I haven't seen him nearly so anguished about
anything else as he is about Lebanon,'' O'Connor said. ``It's just
eating away at him.''
   Asked whether he was afraid to be in Lebanon, O'Connor smiled
and said: ``No I'm not. Why should I be?''
   There are 15 foreigners, including nine Americans, held hostage
in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Asked if he would seek to free the hostages, O'Connor, who
visited Lebanon in June 1986, said: ``I'll certainly say what I
said last time I was here about the American hostages and all
hostages. I'm not an ambassador from the United States. I'm simply
a priest, a churchman.''
   He said, ``I'm not here as a negotiator ... If their captors
would permit me to see them, then I'd be very happy to see them and
do anything I could to help them.'' Asked whether he would cross
Beirut's dividing Green Line to the Moslem sector, where most of
the hostages are believed held, the cardinal said: ``I'll be going
to wherever Patriarch Sfeir thinks I should go.''
   Officials said O'Connor was scheduled to drive to west Beirut to
meet with acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads a Moslem
Cabinet vying for legitimacy with a Christian government headed by
Aoun.
   The cardinal was scheduled to meet Sunday with Aoun at the
shell-battered presidential palace in Baabda, five miles east of
Beirut.

   Soccer fans clashed Saturday in the
city center and the streets surrounding a Glasgow stadium before,
during and after a game between Scotland and England, and police
reported more than 250 arrests.
   The annual England-Scotland game, the oldest rivalry in
international soccer, often has been the setting for fan violence
in recent years. Police in Glasgow had expected problems and made
special plans for controlling hooliganism surrounding the game.
   ``There were clashes between rival groups and police stepped in
quickly to quell any disturbances and make arrests,'' said
Strathclyde Police spokesman Ralph Howden. ``We generally have kept
on top of things.''
   Howden said about 100 fans were arrested before the match at
Hampden Park stadium, mostly for minor offenses.
   There were no serious injuries reported, he said, and the only
report of property damage was of a broken pub window.
   Police later reported more than 150 related arrests in the city
center.
   Soccer hooliganism, a persistent problem for years, has become
particularly sensitive recently with the involvement of British
fans in the May 29, 1985 Heysel stadium riots in Brussels, in which
39 people were killed.
   On April 15, 95 fans were killed at Sheffield's Hillsborough
stadium when police permitted shoving fans into an already crowded
standing area, creating a fatal crush.

   Idaho Supreme Court Justice Allan G. Shepard
died Saturday of complications from a heart attack suffered two
days before. He was 66.
   ``The cause of death was his heart attack,'' said Bob
Hieronymous, a spokesman for St. Alphonsus Regional Medical Center.
``He just never got better.''
   The senior member of the high court was brought to the hospital
on Thursday after he complained of chest pains. Last week, Shepard
stepped down as chief justice, but remained on the court. He cited
his heavy work load as a reason for giving up his post.
   Shepard joined the five-member Supreme Court in 1969. He
suffered a heart attack in late 1987 that kept him off the bench
for six weeks. He also was hospitalized early this year with chest
pains.
   Shepard served two terms as a Republican state legislator from
Ada County, and held the state attorney general's post for six
years. He is believed to be the only person in Idaho history to
have been elected to all three branches of state government.
   Shepard is survived by his wife Donna and five children.

   Capt. Will C. Rogers III ended his two-year
command of the USS Vincennes on Saturday without apology for the
cruiser's mistaken destruction of an Iranian airliner and with a
call to combat terrorism.
   Navy Capt. Robert B. Lynch took over as the new commander of the
Aegis cruiser that Rogers defended as ``a masterpiece of American
technology and ingenuity,'' despite past criticisms.
   Rogers made no mention of the airliner's destruction July 3,
1988, instead focusing on a pipe bomb attack last March that
destroyed a van driven by his wife, Sharon, as she drove to work.
Mrs. Rogers escaped injury.
   The van bombing remains under investigation by the FBI as a
possible act of terrorism.
   Rogers, speaking to a crowd of about 200 aboard the heavily
guarded ship, denounced terrorism, saying it is a ``subterranean
and shadowy war'' that ``preys on a lack of courage and enlists
those without moral conviction.''
   The Vincennes was engaged in combat with seven Iranian patrol
craft when it misidentified the Iranian jetliner as an attacking
military aircraft and fired at it. All 290 aboard the jet died.
   Rogers, who took command of the Vincennes in April 1987,
defended the Aegis electronic combat control system, which enables
a ship like the Vincennes to make computer-recommended battle
decisions for entire fleets.
   But the system was found flawed in the Persian Gulf
confrontation. According to Pentagon analysts, split-second
decisions were affected by the inability of radar-scope
interpreters to immediately match the plane's ``blip'' with digital
direction, altitude and speed information displayed on another
screen.
   The Vincennes will be moved to Long Beach Naval Shipyard within
five weeks for modifications of its electronic combat control
system, The (San Diego) Tribune reported.
   During the ceremony, Rogers was commended by Vice Adm. Robert
K.U. Kihune, who presented him with the Legion of Merit.
   ``There are very few officers in our ranks who have been faced
with the challenges of command that Capt. Will Rogers has had to
face,'' Kihune said.
   ``I can state today, without any exaggeration, that Capt. Rogers
has met every test and has moved on to instill pride in his men and
to command his warship with true professionalism.,'' Kihune said.
   Rogers' new assignment is at the Navy's Tactical Training Group
on Point Loma, which trains senior naval officers in handling
close-combat situations. He and his wife are under a Naval
Investigative Service guard that has been in place since the van
bombing.
   The Vincennes, which was commissioned in 1984, is expected to
leave San Diego for a routine six-month deployment to the Far East
and Indian Ocean in early December.

   Thousands of Moslems on Saturday fought among
themselves and clashed with police during a march to demand Britain
change its blasphemy laws and allow them to challenge ``The Satanic
Verses'' in court.
   Police said 84 people were arrested and six policemen were
injured during the march, most in street battles in front of the
Houses of Parliament.
   An estimated 20,000 demonstrators waved banners denouncing
author Salman Rushdie and shouted slogans such as ``Rushdie must
die!'' as they began their march in Hyde Park.
   An effigy of Rushdie hanging from gallows was thrust high into
the air. Rushdie, a British author, wrote ``The Satanic Verses,'' a
novel that some say is insulting to Islam.
   Lawmaker Keith Vaz of the opposition Labor Party called on
Rushdie and his publisher, Penguin, to withdraw the novel from
circulation in Britain, home to an estimated 850,000 Moslems.
   Protesters then marched to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
office at 10 Downing St., where representatives handed in a
petition demanding a change in Britain's ancient blasphemy laws.
   Britain's rarely used blasphemy law makes it illegal only to
insult the Christian state Church of England. Moslems want it
extended to reflect Britain's multi-ethnic society, saying this
would give them legal grounds for opposing ``The Satanic Verses.''
   At their next stop in Parliament Square, thousands of protesters
stood under Big Ben and blocked traffic as fighting broke out among
crowd members. Riot police poured into the area to break up the
clashes and force protesters onto Westminster Bridge, out of the
square.
   A Scotland Yard spokesman said fighting broke out among younger
members of the demonstration ``for reasons best known to
themselves.''
   He said the demonstrators refused to move but then resumed the
march after protest organizers announced over a loudspeaker that
police had assured them the arrested people would be released.
   After the skirmishes the protesters continued their march to
their final destination in south London's Kennington where they
dispersed.
   Rushdie, born to a Moslem family in India, is a British citizen
and has been in hiding in England since Feb. 14, when Iranian
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered Moslems to kill him.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by
associating the prophet Mohammed with prostitutes and suggesting
that the Koran, Islam's holy book, was Mohammed's invention, not
the work of God.
   At the start of Saturday's protest, Moslem men sat in circles on
the grass in Hyde Park and punched the air with their fists as they
called for the British government to change the blasphemy law.
   The International Committee For The Defense of Salman Rushdie
and His Publishers issued a statement calling on demonstration
leaders to repudiate Khomeini's death threat. The statement said
the death threat violated international law and contradicted ``the
principle of reverence for life which underlies all religions.''
   The committee agreed with the demonstrators that the blasphemy
law discriminated against Moslems and other non-Christians but said
it should be repealed rather than extended.
   The protest was organized by the British Muslim Action Front and
Moslem leader Abdal Hussain Choudhury.

   The baggage area for American Airlines Flight 1098
was swarming with passengers, but there was no mistaking the man of
the hour _ Eli Infante, who served as interpreter Saturday when
their plane was hijacked.
   ``He's a hero!'' one of his fellow passengers shouted.
   Surrounded by reporters, the Miami man smiled modestly and
remained unruffled as he did throughout the hijacking.
   ``He was great,'' agreed Albert Saghian, a ladies fashion
salesman from Los Angeles.
   Infante's wife Silvia sat patiently while her husband, a
33-year-old sales representative for Minolta Business Systems, told
his story again and again.
   ``I thought I wasn't going to get home,'' said Mrs. Infante, who
with her husband was returning from a company-paid vacation in
Hawaii. ``The beginning was pretty difficult because we didn't know
where we were standing. All they would say was the individual
wanted to go to Havana.''
   Mrs. Infante, 28, said she was proud of her husband's behavior
as he relayed messages between the crew and the Spanish-speaking
hijacker, identified by the FBI as Pedro Rene Comas-Banos, an
escaped mental patient who emigrated from Cuba in the Mariel
boatlift.
   ``I thought he handled it very good, kept himself calm,'' she
said. ``I think that if he would have been tense, it would have
made it worse.''
   She said Infante persuaded the man to release children from the
plane and tried to get him to let the women go _ or at least his
own wife.
   Comas-Banos allowed children the leave the parked Boeing 727,
and Infante and other negotiators talked him into surrendering
minutes later. Infante offered to accompany the man from the plane,
but the crew wouldn't allow it.
   Lenny Anyia, a high school math teacher in Hawthorne, Calif.,
sat across from Infante and Comas-Banos and said the hijacker
didn't act strangely.
   ``I dismissed him almost from the moment we took off,'' he said,
adding, ``Eli, he was great.''
   Mrs. Infante said she and her husband would pick up their two
small sons at her sister-in-law's house, then go home and rest.
   ``Thank God it's a long weekend,'' she said.
   When asked if she would fly again, she laughed and replied,
``It'll be a long time.''

   A Cuban immigrant who escaped from a mental
hospital tried to hijack an American Airlines jetliner to Cuba on
Saturday, but he surrendered after the plane landed at Miami,
authorities said.
   The Boeing 727 carrying 157 passengers and crew en route from
Dallas to Miami was diverted toward Cuba temporarily before heading
back to its original destination. The hijacker was armed with a
starter's pistol and two knives, but no one was injured.
   He was identified as Pedro Rene Comas-Banos, 37, who came to the
United States exactly nine years ago Saturday as part of the Mariel
boatlift, said FBI agent William Gavin.
   The suspect has a history of mental problems, most recently
escaping from an institution in the Los Angeles area, Gavin said,
adding that the date of that escape is not yet known.
   ``He has been living since that time in the Los Angeles area and
reportedly has a son in Cuba and has expressed interest in
returning to Cuba,'' Gavin said.
   Before going to Los Angeles, Gavin said, Comas-Banos escaped
from St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C., where John
Hinckley, who attempted to assassinate President Reagan in 1981, is
held. Comas-Banos was there from 1980 to 1982.
   ``He's a very confused individual, not at all crystal clear and
cogent,'' Gavin said. ``His mind keeps changing.''
   Dressed in olive-drab fatigues and a bomber-type jacket, the
sandy-haired Comas-Banos boarded an American Airlines flight in Los
Angeles on Saturday morning and then transferred to the Miami-bound
flight in Dallas, Gavin said.
   ``After the flight left the ground on its way to Miami, he
produced a demand note and said he wanted to be taken to Havana,''
Gavin said. Speaking only Spanish, the hijacker told the flight
crew he was carrying a bomb in his briefcase, which actually
contained a starter's pistol used in track races, two pocket knives
and a pair of scissors.
   The pilot turned back toward Miami after reporting he didn't
have enough fuel to get to Havana, which Gavin said was true.
`There was no bluff here this morning,'' Gavin said. The plane
never entered Cuban airspace.
   Ninety minutes after Flight 1098 parked in a remote corner of
Miami International Airport, Comas-Banos allowed children to leave
the jet and then gave himself up, Gavin said.
   ``All the passengers are off and safe,'' said Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman Jack Barker.
   Comas-Banos was charged with air piracy and taken to the
Metropolitan Correctional Center in Dade County pending a hearing
Tuesday before a federal magistrate, Gavin said. If convicted,
Comas-Banos faces a maximum penalty of life in prison.
   One passenger, Eli Infante, 33, of Miami, said he served as
interpreter between the hijacker and crew.
   ``I thought I was going to get shot,'' Infante said.
   Asked why Comas-Banos gave up, Infante said, ``I guess he got
tired. We kept telling him we would not take off with passengers
aboard.''
   Infante's wife, Silvia, 28, described Comas-Banos as ``very
tense. He was sweating a lot and walking back and forth saying he
had accomplices. But we never saw anybody but him.''
   Describing Comas-Banos' surrender, Mrs. Infante said ``he
collapsed and everybody jumped on him'' as he left the back of the
jet.
   At one point, the FAA and the airline had said there might be
more than one hijacker, but they said later that that was never
confirmed.
   Robert Baker, senior vice president of operations at American
Airlines, said the hijacker claimed to have confederates aboard the
plane, and the other passengers were being interviewed and the
plane checked for weapons.
   FAA officials said passengers left the aircraft by rear stairs,
and their carry-on luggage was checked by officers with police dogs.
   Flight 1098, carrying 150 passengers and a crew of seven, left
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport about 8 a.m. EDT and was
scheduled to land at Miami at about 10:30 a.m.
   ``Approximately 15 miles north of Miami ... the pilot reported
he had a passenger who wanted to go to Havana,'' said FAA spokesman
Bob Buckhorn in Washington.
   ``The aircraft circled Miami for approximately 20 minutes and
then turned south. Approximately 60 miles south of Miami, the
aircraft turned north again,'' Buckhorn said.
   The Coast Guard was notified of an air emergency shortly before
11 a.m. as the jet flew over the Atlantic Ocean. Ditching ``was a
concern at one point in time,'' said law enforcement duty officer
David Newton.
   In Miami, Metro-Dade police sent a special-weapons and tactics
team to the airport, and the FBI was on the scene.
   During the 1960s and 1970s, there were a rash of hijackings or
attempted hijackings to Cuba before the institution of security
measures at airports and the cooperation of Cuban authorities
stemmed the tide.
   Last December, a Cuban exile tried to hijack a TWA airliner to
Cuba on a flight from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Miami, but the
aircraft landed on Grand Turk Island instead with the hijacker
thinking he was on the ground in Havana.

   Several thousand disappointed Muscovites gathered
in a stadium parking lot Saturday night and denounced the rejection
by the new Congress of reform candidates who ran for seats in the
standing legislature.
   Many people in the crowd shouted slogans supporting maverick
Communist Boris Yeltsin.
   ``The majority of the people is for the minority of the
deputies,'' one banner said. Another placard said: ``But is it
really life, if it's in chains? But is it really an election, if
it's in fetters?''
   Vladimir Kuznetsov, a teacher, said he sent a telegram to
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev telling him, ``I have less and less
respect for you and more and more'' for Moscow's reform deputies.
   He was applauded when he told the crowd, ``Down with the
bloodsuckers who prey on the people!''
   ``Now we see we can't set our hopes on Gorbachev or on the
Congress,'' another speaker told the rally, which went on past
midnight.
   In nationwide balloting last spring and scores of runoff
elections, 2,250 members were elected to the Congress of People's
Deputies. On Saturday the deputies elected members to the
full-time, 542-seat Supreme Soviet legislature. Yeltsin and other
prominent Moscow reformers were defeated.
   Gorbachev's handling of Saturday's session drew comments from
people at the rally.
   ``Did you see how Gorbachev led the Congress? Like a conductor,
waggling his fingers,'' one man said.
   When an organizer asked the crowd to behave more ``ethically''
and stop trying to grab the microphone a woman said, ``What about
Gorbachev's `ethical' behavior?''
   A member of the Moscow branch of the Democratic Union, which
helped organize the rally, said he was disgusted when he saw the
list of deputies elected to the Supreme Soviet. ``They're all the
familiar faces I've been seeing for the last two years,'' he said.
``What prevented them two years ago from making the reforms they're
supposed to start doing now?''
   The rally, held in the Luzhniki sports complex, was approved by
Moscow authorities as a gathering for public expressions on the
Congress.
   Police did not intervene and an organizer said authorities even
offered the use of a public address system.

   House Majority Leader Tom Foley said
Saturday the Democratic Party and Congress were not ``in a crisis''
despite the ethics controversies that have ensnared Speaker Jim
Wright and Rep. Tony Coelho.
   The Washington congressman said he tried to persuade Coelho, who
as majority whip is the No. 3 House Democrat, not to resign from
Congress because of a pending ethics investigation into personal
finances.
   But he said his California colleague told him his decision to
quit was irreversible.
   ``There is an environment of very intense scrutiny and focus on
us,'' Foley told reporters as he shook hands during the annual Old
Mill Days parade in Oakesdale, about 45 miles south of Spokane.
   ``In recent weeks and months, the focus has been so intense, it
has created a mood ... that I hope will soon change to focus on the
legislative issues,'' said Foley, who is favored to succeed Wright
should the speaker resign as expected next week.
   ``I hope the focus of the media will come back to those issues
for which we were elected to undertake.''
   The 13-term congressman, who later was keynote speaker at a
Democratic Party fund-raiser in Spokane, said the ethics issues
have not hurt the Democrats or Congress.
   ``We are not in a crisis. The Democratic Party, or the Congress
are not in a crisis,'' he told reporters. ``We're going to address
ourselves to the legislative issues that face the country.
   ``We'll resolve the leadership issues very soon and we'll go on
and have a very important and meaningful Congress,'' he said.
   He noted Coelho, who had been expected to be a candidate to
replace Foley as majority leader, continued to deny he had violated
any House ethics standards.
   Coelho has ``had a brilliant record as chairman of the campaign
committee and as the party whip, and I think he'll be deeply missed
by his colleagues and by the constituents he served so well,''
Foley said.
   Coelho told colleagues late Friday that he intends to resign
from Congress next month rather than endure a protracted ethics
investigation. Coelho has come under criticism for his personal
business dealings, particularly the handling of a $100,000
investment in junk bonds.

   Race car drivers accompanied by floats,
bands, giant balloons and other celebrities took a slow turn
through town Saturday, a day before the somewhat faster-paced
Indianapolis 500.
   Singing cowboy Gene Autry, the 81-year-old grand marshal, led
the parade through downtown Indianapolis before an estimated crowd
of 325,000 people.
   More than 100 floats, bands and other entries participated in
the 500 Festival Memorial Parade, including the drivers who will
roar around the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Sunday.
   Other participants included Gov. Evan Bayh; Autry, the
actor-movie maker, and his sidekick, Pat Buttram; Misty Rowe of
television's Hee Haw; political humorist Mark Russell; actor and
race car enthusiast James Garner; and ``Airplane'' star Robert Hays.
   The parade theme, ``The American West _ From the Frontier to the
Future,'' heralded the opening of the Eiteljorg Museum of American
Indian and Western Art next month and had several floats displaying
Conestoga wagons and space ships.
   An estimated 40,000 people lined the parade route in reserved
seats and thousands more watched from crowded sidewalks, office and
apartment windows and rooftops.
   ``We're parade people,'' said one spectator, Ruth Wilson, of
Phoenix, Ariz. ``We came to see the drivers for this one.''

   Yang Jianjun, one of thousands of students
waiting Saturday at Beijing's railroad station to go home, said it
was time to bring the spirit of the demonstrations that have
convulsed the capital out to the countryside.
   ``Participation of the people will help bring about a new
government,'' Yang said after spending four days marching and
chanting anti-government slogans at Beijing's central Tiananmen
Square.
   But, he conceded, ``the conditions are really bad at the square.
A lot of people are tired of living out there.''
   As he and others prepared to leave, hundreds of students were
arriving at the station. Soldiers blocked many from leaving the
station to go to Tiananmen.
   Yang, a junior at the Liaoning Fuxing Institute of Mining and
Technology in northeastern China, said he was not discouraged that
the Beijing demonstrations appeared to be coming to an end, with
only about 10,000 protesters remaining in Tiananmen Saturday
compared to hundreds of thousands a week ago.
   ``People from my school are still at Tiananmen, and many of us
return to Beijing after going home to continue our movement,'' Yang
said. But he added that the journey back and forth is ``getting
hard now with all the soldiers at this station.''
   Demonstrations have been reported in many cities, apparently led
by students who returned home after participating in the Beijing
protests.
   ``We have to tell the people to arise, including peasants,
workers, intellectuals and others from every walk of life,'' said a
24-year-old student from Wuhan who asked not to be identified.
   On Saturday, several dozen soldiers kept crowds of students in a
waiting area outside the station for a long trip back by special
train to Wuhan in central China. Several dozen more plainclothes
soldiers wearing red armbands made a ring around the departing
students _ making sure they did not stray back into the city.
   ``Soldiers have blocked the exits to keep students from getting
out (of the station),'' said Li Xiongdong, a junior at Beijing's
University of Science and Technology who was seeing friends off.
   Li said guards scuffled with five students from Suzhou
University earlier Saturday, tearing their shirts while hauling
them away to be sent back to eastern Jiangsu province.
   ``If a big group arrives (from the countryside) the soldiers
won't try to stop them, but if it's just a handful, they won't get
through,'' he said.
   The government has issued orders to provincial officials to stop
students from coming to Beijing.
   During the peak of the demonstrations, some 50,000 students
arrived by train daily, according to newspapers. State-run radio
reported 26,000 students left Beijing Friday.
   Railroad officials declined to answer questions about the
situation Saturday.
   Railroad workers have allowed many students to ride the trains
free to join the demonstrators at Tiananmen, but that too is to
end. Loudspeakers at the Beijing station said that starting Sunday,
all students would have to pay for their trips.

<HEAD>SEIU Wins 2-1 As Health Care Union Votes to Affiliate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Service Employees International Union
picked up about 50,000 new members Saturday and its chief rival in
the health care field an estimated 27,000 as a smaller but
aggressive union dissolved to join the ranks of labor's giants.
   SEIU immediately claimed preeminence in the burgeoning health
care industry but its rival, the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees, vowed to continue its organizing
forays in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy.
   Both had campaigned hard for the affiliation of locals now tied
to the National Union of Health Care and Hospital Employees, also
known as District 1199, a 30-year-old pioneer in health care
organizing that decided to join a larger union to expand its
financial and political clout.
   Results of an election supervised by the American Arbitration
Association and released Saturday showed 13 of the District 1199's
18 locals chose to join SEIU. That would swell the union's
membership from 850,000 to about 900,000.
   Five of the locals, with a total of about 27,300 members, voted
to join AFSCME, which entered the election 1.2 million members
strong.
   The results left SEIU representing about 375,000 health-care
workers to about 330,000 for AFSCME.
   District 1199 Secretary Treasurer Jerome Brown, who sided with
SEIU in the affiliation fight, said the election was ``but the
opening salvo in a battle to organize all health care workers into
one great union.''
   Added SEIU spokesman Gerry Shea: ``We come out of this with a
lot of energy to turn to the question of unorganized workers.''
   But an AFSCME spokesman said SEIU would face continued
competition in organizing the estimated 6 million health care
workers not currently represented by unions.
   ``We're very pleased to have gotten those votes, to have gained
those members that we have,'' said AFSCME's Robert Harman. ``That
means we're a very potent health care union too and we intend to
remain so.''
   The election took on added significance because of a recent
National Labor Relations Board decision unions believe will make it
easier to organize health care workers.
   The two larger unions were unable to resolve differences over
how an affiliation vote would be conducted so the AFL-CIO brokered
a compromise under which each local of the health care union
decided which of the bigger unions to join. That decision
essentially guaranteed District 1199 would be split up because
AFSCME and SEIU had concentrated their lobbying efforts in
different regions and were competing head-to-head in only a few.
   SEIU emerged victorious in two of the hardest fought battles,
gaining 5,000 members in the Baltimore area and another 2,500 in
Michigan. It also won the affiliation of District 1199 members in
New England _ except for one Connecticut local _ Rome and
Rochester, N.Y., Washington state, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky,
Indiana, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania except Philadelphia.
   AFSCME's wins included the two largest District 1199 locals, a
10,500-member unit in Philadelphia and one representing 10,000
workers in New Jersey. About 5,200 California nurses picked AFSCME
over SEIU as did one District 1199 local in Connecticut and another
representing workers in several Southern states.

<TEXT>
   Phineas Newborn Jr., who was considered
one of the top jazz pianists during his prime but who never gained
widespread acclaim, has died at the age of 57.
   Newborn was found dead Friday at his home. The cause of death
has not been released.
   Irvin Salky, Newborn's agent and friend, said X-rays six weeks
ago showed a growth on one of Newborn's lungs.
   ``We found him slumped over in a chair on the front porch,''
said his brother, Calvin Newborn. Newborn was taken to the Regional
Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.
   ``In his prime, he was one of the three greatest jazz pianists
of all time, right up there with Bud Powell and Art Tatum,'' said
jazz critic Leonard Feather, a columnist for Downbeat magazine and
the Los Angeles Times.
   Newborn's work was best known in the mid 1950s and 1960s.
Although he was not a celebrity, he was highly regarded by jazz
aficionados.
   His albums included ``A World of Piano,'' ``The Newborn Touch,''
``The Great Piano of Phineas'' and ``Piano Artistry of Phineas
Newborn.''
   Survivors include his mother, daughters, son and two
grandchildren.

   Congress owes the public ``an up or down
vote'' on alleged ethics violations by two Democratic leaders even
if they step down, Republican National Committee Chairman Lee
Atwater said Saturday.
   Atwater said the resignation of House Majority Whip Tony Coelho
and the anticipated resignation of Speaker Jim Wright does not mean
the ethics investigations should be halted and the allegations
dropped.
   ``If I were a member of Congress, I would want an opportunity to
vote on these Wright and Coelho matters,'' he said. ``What would
disappoint me would be if these things are just kind of brushed
aside.''
   Atwater, who said he was taken by surprise by Coelho's decision
to step down, urged Congress to improve its tarnished image. ``It's
very dangerous and very unhealthy for the American people to have
such a bad attitude about one of our institutions,'' he said.
   The GOP chairman said he's been avoiding attempts to make
political hay out of the Wright and Coelho problems. He would not
say whether he expects congressional ethics to be a dominant issue
in the 1990 elections.
   ``I've been following the Napoleonic maxim, which is `never
interfere with the enemy when he's in the process of destroying
himself,''' Atwater said.
   Atwater, who managed George Bush's presidential campaign last
year, was in Maine for an afternoon fund-raising reception at the
Cape Elizabeth home of House Minority Leader Mary Clark Webster.

<TEXT>
   An 18-year-old man accused of murdering
his parents escaped with another prisoner from a northwestern
Wisconsin jail early Saturday.
   Washburn County Sheriff Don Fuller said late Saturday afternoon
that investigators had found no sign as yet of Todd A. York, who is
scheduled for trial Oct. 2 in the shooting deaths of his parents.
   ``We've been following a lot of leads,'' Fuller said.
   He said law enforcement agencies throughout Wisconsin and
surrounding states were alerted of the escape, and the search would
continue Saturday night.
   ``All they had on was jail coveralls and small sandals _ almost
barefoot,'' the sheriff said. ``Whether they were picked up
outside, we just don't know.''
   Fuller said the two, who had been cellmates since the other
escapee was jailed May 13, used hacksaw blades to saw through the
bars of an outside window.
   The sheriff said it was not known how they obtained the cutting
device, although it was possible to pass things into the jail
through windows.
   ``We're dealing with a 100-year-old jail here,'' he said.
   Fuller said York, 18, of rural Spooner, who was being held on
two counts of first-degree murder, and Keith Thompson, 17, of
Trego, held on a burglary charge and a probation violation, escaped
sometime after 2 a.m.
   York was accused of the Sept. 8, 1988, slayings of his parents,
William and Wanda York, both 49, in their home about two miles
northwest of Spooner. Authorities said each had been shot once in
the head with a rifle.
   The criminal complaint filed in the case contends York got into
a quarrel with his parents after he and his father returned home
from a carpentry job.
   York had been freed on a $100,000 cash bond after being charged.
He was put in the custody of relatives in northern Illinois, but
did not maintain required contact with authorities and was arrested
in March on a bail jumping charge.

<HEAD>Panel Clears Biden of Law School Plagiarism Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Joseph Biden was cleared of
allegations that he committed plagiarism in law school by a panel
under the authority of the Delaware Supreme Court, The (Wilmington)
News Journal reported.
   In its Sunday editions, the newspaper also said Biden has
received a clean bill of health from his physician following two
life-threatening brain aneurysms in 1987.
   The Delaware Democrat pulled out of the 1988 presidential
campaign following accusations that he quoted British Labour Party
leader Neil Kinnock without attribution and had plagiarized an
article while attending Syracuse University's law school.
   Biden called his failure to attribute the Kinnock quotes an
oversight.
   The alleged law school plagiarism involved an essay Biden wrote
in 1965 for an introductory class on legal methodology.
   The senator ended his presidential campaign Sept. 23, 1987, and
notified the state Supreme Court of the plagiarism allegations
later that year.
   The court's Board on Professional Responsibility, consisting of
lawyers and non-lawyers, ruled on Dec. 21, 1987, that Biden had not
violated any rules.
   Biden said he decided not to publicize the ruling, which was
confidential. ``I didn't know what to do with it,'' Biden said.
``Why didn't I hold a press conference? I guess I had in the back
of my mind ... this was more of a personal vindication than a
political one.''
   He added, however, that he finally decided to divulge it because
he expected ``somebody would go back someday and check. And I knew
there was a hard record there.''
   L. Susan Faw, independent disciplinary counsel for the board,
confirmed that the ruling had cleared Biden.

   About 500 protesters demonstrated Saturday outside the Chinese
Consulate in Los Angeles and about 300 people gathered in St. Paul,
Minn., to support the flagging protests for political reform in
China.
   In New York, actors Mike Farrell and Ed Asner and Detroit Bishop
Thomas J. Gumbleton were among those who signed a statement
supporting the right of students and workers in China to strike for
democracy.
   The statement from nearly 60 activists was sent via facsimile
machine to students, the Chinese government and to President Bush,
according to a release Friday by Voters for a Nuclear Free New York.
   Philip Lam, an organizer of the Los Angeles demonstration, said
a 24-hour hunger strike began at noon. Participants were students
from local universities.
   In St. Paul, the rally at Como Park was held by the Minnesota
chapter of the Organization for Chinese Americans.
   Members of the organization said they urged the United States to
grant temporary asylum to Chinese students and scholars who are
studying in America. They say they fear that those who oppose the
Chinese government's policies may face persecution when they return
to China.
   Sympathy protests have erupted in several U.S. cities since the
historic occupation of Beijing's Tiananmen Square began two weeks
ago.
   Student leaders of the protest movement in China have proposed
that demonstrators hold one more rally this week and then end the
occupation.
   The leaders said it was time to change tactics in their push for
greater freedom and an end to official corruption. But they said
protesters in Tiananmen Square, whose numbers have fallen sharply
to about 10,000, would have the final say on ending the sit-in.

<TEXT>
   Italy's president on Friday asked former Premier
Giovanni Spadolini to try to mediate an end to a week-old political
crisis that seemed likely to continue beyond President Bush's
three-day visit.
   Premier Ciriaco De Mita, a Christian Democrat, resigned as the
head of a 13-month government last Friday after repeated attacks by
the Socialists, one of his allies in the five-party coalition.
   A few hours before Bush's arrival Friday, President Francesco
Cossiga asked Spadolini to talk with party leaders and find a way
to solve the crisis brought on De Mita's resignation. Cossiga, as
head of state, is charged with picking someone to try to form
Italy's 49th postwar government.
   The Christian Democrats had sought to have De Mita succeed
himself as premier. That would have enhanced De Mita's position in
talks with Bush and at the NATO summit next week in Brussels.
   But there have been indications Socialist leader Bettino Craxi
was opposed to another De Mita-led government.
   Craxi has accused De Mita of failing to demonstrate leadership.
   Spadolini said after his meeting with Cossiga that he would
begin his consultations on Wednesday after De Mita returns from
Brussels.
   His appointment as mediator marked the ninth time that an
Italian president has given a prominent politician the so-called
``exploratory mandate'' for resolving a government crisis.
   Spadolini, 63, was premier from June 28, 1981, until Aug. 7,
1982 and from Aug. 23, 1982 until Nov. 11, 1982. He was the first
non-Christian Democrat premier since 1945. He has been the
president of the Senate since July 1987.

   A graduate student has sued the University of
Michigan claiming that its new anti-discrimination policy violates
his First Amendment right to free speech.
   The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan filed the
complaint Thursday in U.S. District Court in Detroit on behalf of a
graduate student in psychology, who wished to remain anonymous.
   The university introduced the policy in 1988 in response to a
series of racial incidents that included the broadcast of racially
offensive jokes on a campus radio station in 1987 and distribution
of anti-black leaflets.
   The plaintiff is a specialist in behavioral psychology and fears
punishment if he discusses some of his theories in class, said ACLU
attorney Robert Sedler said.
   ``Under the university's policy ... the expression of ideas
concerning the superiority or inferiority of members of one sex
over the other or of members of one race over another, as a result
of biopsychological differences, would be considered to be
`discriminatory harassment,''' the complaint said.
   The Policy on Discrimination and Discriminatory Harassment by
Students in the University Environment prohibits ``any behavior,
verbal or physical, that stigmatizes or victimizes an individual on
the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation,
creed, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, handicap or
Vietnam-era veteran status.''
   The case would have important implications for other schools
that have anti-discrimination policies, said Howard Simon,
executive director of the ACLU of Michigan.
   The University of Wisconsin at Madison and The University of
Massachusetts at Amherst are considering introducing
anti-discrimination plans.
   ``Our suit may serve as an important precedent,'' Simon said.
``If we can prevail and redirect the University of Michigan's
efforts to deal with racism and sexism, it will have an influential
effect on other universities.''
   Walter Harrison, executive director of university relations,
said Michigan has always sought to preserve First Amendment rights.
   ``When we crafted the anti-discrimination policy, we gave
careful consideration to the First Amendment, which we consider to
be essential to the successful operation of the university,''
Harrison said.
   ACLU officials called the policy excessively broad, making any
offensive speech the target of disciplinary action.
   ``You do not address the problem of racism by attacking the
Constitution and the First Amendment,'' Simon said. ``If there is
any institution in the country where controversial, in fact
outrageous and even offensive, ideas ought to be aired, analyzed,
evaluated and debated, it ought to be a university.''
   The policy addresses only the symptoms and not the disease of
racism, Simon said.
   ``If all the racist fliers and jokes and sexually offensive
fliers or jokes are eliminated from the campus of the University of
Michigan, that does not mean racism and sexism will be
eliminated,'' he said.
   The university has 30 days to respond to the lawsuit, Sedler
said.

   A bridge collapsed minutes after an engineer

   ``The car in front of us just dropped straight down,'' said

   Britain has been hit by a series of strikes in
recent months recalling the pre-Thatcher days of national walkouts
that helped bring down a Labor Party government.
   But experts say the scenario is very different from the ``Winter
of Discontent'' of 1978-79 when public service workers paralyzed
much of the country. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative Party ousted the socialists in May 1979 on a wave of
anti-union sentiment.
   Experts predict the strikes will eventually subside after a
current round of wage negotiations. Although there are concerns the
walkouts could lead to higher wages and prices, their impact will
be limited by Mrs. Thatcher's union-curbing laws, they say.
   Repeated one-day walkouts by subway workers and bus drivers have
forced millions of Londoners to walk to work. The British
Broadcasting Corp. has canceled or cut live television and radio
programs because of brief strikes by employees for higher pay.

   There is a glimmer of hope as AT&amp;T and union
negotiators race against a contract deadline at midnight tonight,
but little progress is reported on the issue of health benefits,
described by one source as ``the major block to a settlement.''
   Both sides are expressing optimism at reaching new contracts
before existing pacts affecting about 160,000 workers expire at
11:59 p.m. EDT. But they say such a development hinges on a major
breakthrough on the benefits package, which has dominated the talks
from the outset.
   ``If we can settle health care _ no easy task _ then we can
reach agreement on wages and the other issues,'' a union source
said late Friday. ``This is the major block to a settlement.''
   Sources close to the negotiations said progress has been made
but they cautioned that negotiations are at a fragile stage and
could turn for the worse. In an arrangement likely to be repeated
today, formal negotiating committees met Friday at a Washington
hotel while the two union presidents and AT&amp;T's top negotiator held
separate meetings periodically on the major issues.

   Citing concerns of residents fearful of crime
and addicts in their neighborhoods, former first lady Nancy Reagan
just said no to plans for a drug rehabilitation center that would
bear her name.
   Mrs. Reagan cited local concerns for her decision to abandon the
$10 million Nancy Reagan Center for Drug Rehabilitation, a
spokesman said Friday.
   ``There is a God. I'm on the verge of tears,'' said Lew Snow,
vice president of the Lake View Terrace Homeowners Association, the
group opposing the center. ``I think it shows you can beat city
hall.
   ``Despite all the pressures that people with money and power can
put on a mixed community of all races and incomes, they can still
pull together to defend themselves and win.''
