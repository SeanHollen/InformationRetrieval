   Members of a Shelby County women's club say
they can help reduce the national debt, and they've got $83 to prove
it.
   ``Shelby County is going to challenge all the little white-haired
ladies across the country to help out, all the Republican clubs,''
said Dana McKelvy, publicity chairwoman for the group.
   Ms. McKelvy's club, the Shelby County Republican Women, began a
fund drive at its monthly meeting Monday with plans to help reduce
the nation's $2.6 trillion debt. The opening collection drew $83.
   While club members realize their initial contribution is somewhat
small, they hope it is the start of bigger things.
   ``You don't become a millionaire until you save your first
nickel,'' said club president Dot Wieters.

<HEAD>Chinese Defy Cremation Policy To Build Big Tombs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defying a government policy that promotes
cremation, rural Chinese are building tombs so deluxe that some
people are actually setting up house in them, an official newspaper
said today.
   The China Daily said one farmer spent $540, or about four times
the per capita annual income in the countryside, to prepare for his
parents a final resting place fashioned out of 3,000 bricks and 3.7
tons of stone.
   In coastal Zhejiang province, one farmer was found living in a
four-room tomb he had built for himself, his wife and his late
parents. The tomb came equipped with electric lights.
   The Communist government has long urged Chinese to abandon their
traditional burial practices in favor of cremation. Burial, the
government contends, is a serious drain on land resources in a
country with 23 percent of the world's population but only 5 percent
of the earth's arable land.
   Although most city people are now cremated, there has been strong
resistance to cremation in more conservative rural areas. The
defiance has increased in recent years as newly affluent villagers
seek to honor the dead with large banquets, Buddhist ceremonies and
impressive burial sites.
   Funeral catering services are booming while crematoria are
closing for lack of business or dependent on government subsidies,
according to official reports.
   Entrepreneurs in the scenic city of Hangzhou last year built
1,000 tombs, almost all for overseas Chinese willing to pay large
sums to bury their remains in the motherland.
   Of the 6 million Chinese who died in 1987, only 1.6 million, or
27 percent, were cremated.
   The English-language China Daily said that in the Hunan county,
140 people had been injured in disputes over limited space for
burials.

<HEAD>Astronaut Denies He Failed Eye Test, NASA Chief Mum on Allegations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An astronaut scheduled to command a shuttle
mission this year denied a published report that he failed two tests
for colorblindness, and another astronaut called the allegation of
colorblindness ``absurd.''
   However, Daniel C. Brandenstein, chief of the astronaut corps at
the Johnson Space Center, did not specifically deny that he is
colorblind, a condition that would have disqualified him from flying
in space.
   Brandenstein, who is to command a mission this year, made his
comments Monday following a story in the Houston Chronicle the
previous day that said he and astronaut Frederick C. Hauck received
waivers for medical conditions that would have otherwise grounded
them.
   Hauck commanded the first post-Challenger mission.
   On Tuesday, the Houston Post reported that an anonymous caller to
the newspaper said the astronaut had failed a standard
colorblindness test in 1987 and then failed the Farnsworth Lantern
test, also for colorblindness.
   ``Without going into detail, it's not accurate,'' Brandenstein
was quoted as saying in the article.
   Brandenstein said the claims about his vision are contrary to his
performance as a Navy pilot who has made 400 carrier landings.
   ``I have a long record of operational flying in the Navy with no
problem,'' he added.
   Hauck would not discuss reports he had kidney stone problems, but
he did say the ``allegation Dan Brandenstein is colorblind is
absurd.''
   James C. Fletcher, NASA's chief administrator, refused to comment
on the medical records of Brandenstein and Hauck. But he issued a
statement from Washington, saying, ``I am confident that the system
has not been abrogated and that no one flies without qualifying by
the book.''
   Fletcher, like other NASA officials, said he would not discuss
any individual medical records on the grounds that such records are
legally a private matter.
   The Chronicle, citing unidentified sources at the Johnson Space
Center, said Hauck underwent special medical treatment last year to
dissolve kidney stones, and Brandenstein received a waiver earlier
keeping him on flight status despite colorblindness.

<TEXT>
   Two groups of farmers fought a
gunbattle over land in a remote town in southern Mexico and at least
nine people were killed, authorities said.
   State officials said eight of the dead were among a group about
100 campesinos who occupied a 500-acre tract in December after
losing an eight-year legal battle over the land.
   The ninth was one of 83 campesinos who together own a 7,000-acre
cattle ranch near Pijijiapa that includes the disputed land.
   The owners tried to run off the occupying peasants, according to
official accounts of Sunday's clash 490 miles southeast of Mexico
City in Chiapas state.
   The farmers occupying the land belong to the leftist Independent
Center for Farm Laborers and Campesinos, while the owners belong to
the National Campesino Confederation, part of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   ``There is no doubt that the criminal action, with the use of
sophisticated weapons, as well as the decision to kill the
campesinos, was generated by the group of property owners,'' Gov.
Patrocinio Gonzalez was quoted as saying in Tuesday's editions of
the Mexico City newspaper La Jornada.
   He said AK-47 automatic rifles were used.
   Campesinos occupying the land had petitioned for about 2,500
acres for expansion of their cooperative farm, Enrique Vazquez, a
leader of the Independent Center, said Tuesday.
   Under the Mexican agrarian reform system, campesinos may petition
for the use of privately-owned land that is not being used.

<TEXT>
   Authorities in the southwestern province of
Sichuan have arrested a miner and another man for spying for
Taiwan's military, an official report said today.
   The China News Service said Deng Dongsheng, the coal miner,
entered a spy ring run by Chen Sumei in late 1987.
   It said the two regularly reported ``secrets'' to Taiwanese
authorities, although it did not specify the nature of the
intelligence they provided.
   ``They also developed an underground organization,'' the report
said.
   Earlier this year, public security agents busted the ring ``and
seized a large amount of proof of the spy activitiy,'' the report
said. Both Chen and Deng have admitted they were spies, it said.
   Every few months, the state-run media reports that Taiwanese
spies have been arrested.
   China regards Nationalist Taiwan as a renegade province and the
two are still technically at war. The Nationalists fled mainland
China to Taiwan in 1949 after the Communists defeated them in a
civil war.

   A cloud is hanging over negotiations between the
government and 3,000 National Weather Service employees who are
striking for higher wages.
   ``Negotiations are blocked,'' said a spokesman Tuesday for one of
four unions representing the striking meteorologists.
   The unidentified spokesman, quoted by the French news agency
Agence-France Presse, said the unions have no meetings scheduled
until Thursday with government officials responsible for the weather
service.
   Meteorologists, however, continued to provide critical aviation
and marine forecasts during the walkout.
   Before the walkout began Sunday night, meteorologists graciously
prepared a five-day forecast that runs through Thursday. After that,
the weather is anybody's guess.
   Television and radio weather forecasters have had to be
resourceful in the absence of the standard weather service bulletins
and charts.
   ``What we are doing is very rudimentary,'' said Laurent Cabrol,
chief weatherman at the network Antenne 2. ``Like some skippers, we
are capturing a few weather charts transmitted by short and medium
wave radio as facsimiles.''
   He added that he is getting some help from his colleagues in
Britain and West Germany.
   Weather service meteorologists currently earn about $1,000 a
month at the beginning of their careers.

<HEAD>Soviets Complete First Short-Notice Check of U.S. Compliance To Arms
Treaty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet inspectors completed a tour Tuesday of a
former cruise missile production plant, the first such survey on
American soil under a treaty reducing medium-range nuclear missiles.
   The 10-member Soviet delegation arrived in San Diego on Monday
and completed the inspection of Air Force Plant 19 within 24 hours
as prescribed by terms of the 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces
Treaty.
   Soviet inspectors did not comment publicly on their findings,
which are part of a verification process to make sure the two
superpowers are abiding by their agreement, officials said.
   They were to prepare a report, a copy of which will be left with
U.S. officials, and then fly on an Air Force transport to San
Francisco. From there they were to board a Soviet plane in the next
day or so and return home, said Navy Cmdr. Ken Pease, chief
spokesman for the On-Site Inspection Agency in Washington, D.C.
   ``The Soviets are escorted 100 percent of the time they are in
the United States,'' Pease said. ``Both parties have not commented.
We feel that these inspections are a privileged function of the
treaty. The inspections are just a small part of the INF treaty.
   ``Inspectors' reports are sent back to the various governments,
both ours and theirs, and analyzed along with other inputs from
other sources.''
   The inspection at the plant, operated by General Dynamics Convair
Division, was to verify that components of the banned Air Force
Tomahawk missile system are no longer being produced there.
   ``It went in accordance with the provisions of the treaty,''
Pease said. ``The time lines have been meet. The professionalism on
both sides has been exemplary. That's about all I can say.''
   The United States and the Soviet Union are each allowed 20 annual
``quota'' or short-notice visits of certain defense plants through
1992, when the number drops to 15 per year. It will be reduced again
in 1997 to 10 visits annually for the remainder of the 13-year pact.
   U.S. inspectors have made six of their short-notice visits to
Soviet defense since August, while the Soviets have conducted four
previous short-notice inspections of U.S. installations in Europe,
Pease said.
   The inspection in San Diego was the first by the Soviets in
American territory, however, Pease said.
   Tranporter-erectors used for the ground-launched Air Force
Tomahawk missile, which has a range of 1,500 miles, had been
produced at leased areas of Air Force Plant 19 in downtown San Diego.
   The 1987 treaty calls for eliminating the U.S. military's
stockpile of 859 Air Force Tomahawk cruise missiles and Army
Pershing 2 missiles in exchange for the elimination of the Soviet
Union's 1,752 intermediate- or shorter-range nuclear missiles.
   Navy Tomahawk models, which can be fired from surface warships or
submarines, are not addressed in the accord.

   First lady Barbara Bush paid a Valentine's Day
visit to a nursing home where she worked as a volunteer while
President Bush was in Congress, and told the residents that ``his
success is yours and my success.''
   The first lady, in a red blazer and black-and-white checked
skirt, took a basketful of signed, handmade valentines on Tuesday
for the patients at the Washington Home for the elderly and
terminally ill.
   ``That really means I love you all,'' Mrs. Bush told a group of
patients who chatted with her.
   She was given a large poster-board valentine reading: ``To Mrs.
Bush. Always the first lady in our hearts.''
   Mrs. Bush is a board member of the non-profit, 189-bed facility.
   Mrs. Bush told her press secretary, Anna Perez, that as a
volunteer she helped out with whatever the nurses wanted her to do,
including such tasks as doing the patients' fingernails.
   For her visit Tuesday, however, it was a different setting. She
sat and answered questions from about two dozen patients, some in
wheelchairs, while board members and others looked on.
   When one man wished success for the new president, Mrs. Bush
replied:
   ``I appreciate that and remember, his success is yours and my
success, too ... He's a good man and he won't let you down.''
   ``I love being married to the president,'' she said. ``I love my
house, and I love my life so I feel pretty good.''
   As first lady she said she wants to continue focusing attention
on literacy, and: ``I hope I'll make people care more about one
another. I think that's very important.''
   Mrs. Bush called the White House ``the most beautiful house you
could possibly believe,'' and said she would change little from the
redecorating done by former First lady Nancy Reagan.
   ``It's filled with beautiful paintings, lovely furniture and
bright sunshine,'' she said. ``If you couldn't be happy in the White
House, you just couldn't be happy anyplace.''
   One elderly man, Nathan Scott, showed her two letters he got from
Bush last year. One, dated Oct. 31, thanked him for donating to
Bush's campaign fund. The other, from July, thanked him for
contributing to the debt retirement fund of one of Bush's rivals for
the Republican nomination, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas.
   ``He wrote you and asked you for money?'' Mrs. Bush said. ``You
ought to scold him.''

   U.S. embassies abroad have hired hundred of
foreign nationals for security posts and other jobs without
background checks, heightening the risk of espionage and terrorism,
a congressional report says.
   The General Accounting Office, looking at security for U.S. posts
in nine countries, found that employees at eight of them had not
been adequately investigated.
   ``These shortcomings represent not only noncompliance with ...
regulations but more importantly, a gap in the U.S. efforts to
reduce the risk of espionage and terrorism at overseas posts,'' the
GAO report said.
   The GAO found that of 328 local guards hired in Egypt, at least
204 were not investigated by U.S. officials. It said there were no
plans to investigate 48 guards who were hired for U.S. posts by
Egyptian commercial contractors.
   In Argentina, the ambassador hired a nanny and a chauffeur at his
own expense without telling the American security officer, according
to the report. Later the nanny was found to have both local and U.S.
police records, and the chauffeur was fired for helping to steal the
ambassador's car, it said.
   The report did not name the ambassador.
   It found that in Algeria _ like Egypt, a neighbor of Libya _ only
52 of the 229 foreign nationals employed were investigated, and none
of the local guard force of 94 was among them.
   In Morocco, of 821 non-American employees, security files were
missing on 112 and the security officer said 108 were probably never
investigated.
   In Argentina, 71 guards were investigated by a local contractor
who hired them, with no check by Americans. The U.S. security
officer in Thailand had not investigated 183 local guards, and the
local contractor who supplied them was allowed to determine which
ones to investigate.
   A State Department official said Tuesday it is reviewing each
post to see that investigations are in compliance with its rules.
But he added that the report does not seem to account for the
various restrictions imposed by governments of the host countries.
   ``In some countries no investigations are possible,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

   Triple-bypass heart surgery and a stroke left
Emile Blouin disabled and with substantial medical bills. When he
got a letter a few months ago telling him he had won $5,000 in a
sweepstakes, he thought at least some of his problems were over.
   ``I was completely surprised. I was so elated,'' said Blouin, 77,
of Phoenix.
   He and his wife, Mary, followed the instructions on the prize
notification letter, which asked them to send in money which would
be donated to a charitable cause. They sent a $25 check to the
Cancer Fund of America and waited. But their $5,000 prize never came.
   ``You feel as though you can't trust anybody anymore,'' said Mary
Blouin. ``It's not fair to the public.''
   The Blouins are among thousands of consumers around the country
who have complained to charity regulators that they were tricked
into making contributions.
   Attorneys general in Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, Massachusetts and
Illinois have filed suit against the Watson and Hughey Co., a
direct-mail fund-raiser which represents a number of charities. They
allege that the Alexandria, Va., company engages in fraudulent fund
raising with its sweepstakes prize announcement letters.
   A foundation started by an award-winning government scientist is
among the groups that have employed Watson and Hughey for fund
raising. Robert I. Glazer, a senior scientist at the National Cancer
Institute, has been ordered by federal officials to return all
donations collected through the solicitations, his lawyer said
Tuesday.
   Attorney David H. Shapiro said Glazer's foundation, the National
Leukemia Research Foundation, has yet to receive any money from
Watson and Hughey under a contract giving the direct-mail company
the first $100,000 raised.
   Tom McClure, a postal inspector, said the U.S. Postal Inspection
Service also has launched an investigation into Watson and Hughey.
   ``People are really upset,'' said Frank Driscoll, of the National
Charities Information Service in New York City. He said his office
averages 36 calls a day from people concerned about the sweepstakes
letters. ``We never imagined we were going to get this avalanche.''
   Many consumers have complained to charity regulators that they
were sent letters telling them they had won $5,000 or some other
amount in a Cash Bonanza or Irish Sweepstakes. To claim their prize,
they were asked to make a voluntary contribution which would go
toward a charity.
   After sending in donations and a form to claim their prize, most
received checks for only 10 cents.
   ``They create the false impression that you win a valuable prize
and the likelihood that you would win a lot of money is not very
likely,'' said Wendy Burt, a Minnesota state attorney spokeswoman. A
disclaimer on the back of the letter was insufficient, she said,
adding ``it was in fine print and could easily be overlooked.''
   The Iowa suit alleges that Watson and Hughey's solicitations are
``targeted toward susceptible populations, including elderly people
who may be unable to read deceptively worded disclosures buried in
fine print.''
   The award notices are signed by Washington attorney Robert R.
Stone, who defended the fund-raising tactics. ``I don't believe
they're misleading if they read the facts. But some people don't
read everything,'' Stone said.
   Stone said he advises the company on state fund-raising laws and
his name appears on the letters.
   Watson and Hughey Co., is headed by Jerry C. Watson and Byron C.
Hughey, both of Virginia. Most of their clients are small charities
with no large-scale fund-raising experience, according to the
Chronicle of Philanthropy, a trade publication.
   Watson and Hughey declined to be interviewed. Contacted by phone,
Hughey said only, ``I'm sorry. I can't talk to you on the advice of
my attorney.''
   Besides the leukemia research foundation, Watson and Hughey
clients have included the Cancer Fund of America of Knoxville,
Tenn.; Pacific West Cancer Fund of Seattle, Wash.; Walker Cancer
Research Institute of Edgewood, Md.; Social Security Protection
Agency of Washington; American Heart Disease Prevention Foundation,
Inc., of Mountclair, N.J.; and Project Cure@Center for Alternative
Cancer Research, of Washington.
   Some state attorneys general allege that little of the money
raised through Watson and Hughey actually goes toward research.
   ``Normally, less than 5 percent of the contributions are used for
research or some kind of service for the people they say they're
going to help,'' Ms. Burt said.
   The Minnesota suit alleges that one of the charities, Project
Cure@Center for Alternative Cancer Research, reported $3.6 million
in revenue for 1987, but allocated nothing for research. The
majority of the $3.6 million went to management and fund-raising
expenses, according to the suit.
   James T. Reynolds, president of the Cancer Fund of America,
denied that his organization tries to trick people with Watson and
Hughey's fund-raising letters.
   ``They (consumers) are familiar with the rules,'' Reynolds said.
``How in the world do you write everything so that everybody
understands it?''
   Reynolds said the Cancer Fund of America doesn't do research, but
helps cancer patients pay their bills.
   ``We raise funds to provide assistance to medically indigent
people,'' he said. ``We're trying to help people.''
   Also named in several suits is a for-profit organization called
the Social Security Protection Bureau. It sells consumers statements
of their Social Security record, Social Security cards and
information on Social Security rule changes, according to one of its
fund-raising letters.
   A call to the organization was referred to the Social Security
Administration, which is not affiliated with the company.
   Social Security Administration officials said many of the
services sold by the company are available free of charge through
the federal agency.
   SSA spokesman Frank Battistelli said some people have walked into
the government agency looking for money they've won in a sweepstakes.
   ``We have a lot of problems,'' he said. ``Our best defense
against it is an educated public.''

<HEAD>Lack of Scripts Keeps ABC's `Moonlighting' Off the Air Until Spring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The inventive television series
``Moonlighting'' is suspending broadcast until April because of a
lack of scripts stemming from last year's scriptwriters' strike, the
executive producer said.
   ``The rumor of our death is greatly exaggerated,'' executive
producer Jay Daniels said Tuesday. ``There has been absolutely no
discussion. The word `canceled' has never been broached.''
   ABC executives said they are putting the hit comedy ``Roseanne''
in half of the show's hour-long time slot on Tuesday nights,
beginning at 9 p.m. EST on Feb. 28.
   Another popular comedy, ``The Wonder Years,'' is moving to 8:30
p.m. EST Tuesday, the spot ``Roseanne'' had occupied.
   ``Moonlighting'' has fallen in the ratings and was being beaten
regularly by NBC's ``In the Heat of the Night.'' Glenn Caron,
creator of ``Moonlighting,'' has left the show, reportedly over
creative differences with star Cybill Shepherd.
   Producers have had scheduling problems because of the 22-week
strike, Daniels said. Each episode takes nine days to shoot when
they are on schedule.
   ``We just couldn't shoot episodes fast enough, even staying on
schedule as we are,'' he said.
   The tongue-in-cheek detective show starring Bruce Willis and Miss
Shepherd will return in the spring with all new episodes, said
Brandon Stoddard, president of ABC Entertainment.
   Some say the show has suffered creatively. When Miss Shepherd
became pregnant, the producers made her character pregnant. And when
the actress' real pregnancy cut back her appearances, several
episodes featured the show's secondary stars, Allyce Beasley and
Curtis Armstrong.
   ``We've tried to get back to entertaining shows and cases pretty
much as David and Maddie have been,'' Daniels said. ``We do think
it's time for David and Maddie to start dealing with their
relationship again.''
   The absence of ``Moonlighting'' makes room for ABC to introduce
two new half-hour comedy series, ``Anything But Love,'' starring
Jamie Lee Curtis and Richard Lewis, and ``Coach,'' starring Craig T.
Nelson, Jerry Van Dyke and Shelley Fabares.
   ``Anything But Love'' will premiere Tuesday, March 7, in its
regular time slot at 9:30 p.m. EST. ``Coach'' will have a sneak
preview at 9:30 p.m. EST Feb. 28, then move into its regular 9 p.m.
time slot on March 1.

<TEXT>
   Sales of existing homes in 1988 hit their
highest level in nine years as purchases shifted to the lower-cost
South and Midwest and consumers opted to buy less costly dwellings
rather than leave the market, a real estate trade group reported.
   Despite the dampening effect of rising mortgage interest rates,
sales for 1988 totaled 3.99 million units, up 2.6 percent from the
previous year and the highest since 4.05 million sales were recorded
in 1979, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.
   ``We underestimated the buying power strength of the baby boom
generation,'' said Ira Gribin, president of the Realtors group.
``The market is being driven by people who are buying in spite of
rising rates.''
   The biggest sales gains were posted in the least expensive
regions of the country.
   Sales in the Midwest were up 6.1 percent during the last quarter
of 1988 from the previous three months and sales in the South rose
5.4 percent. The Northeast, meanwhile, posted a 2.4 percent decline
in sales, while the West recorded a 1.4 percent increase.
   ``The Midwest was a bright star of the nation's housing sector
last quarter, and we think its improvement will continue this
year,'' said John A. Tuccillo, the Realtors' chief economist. ``We
have seen activity pick up in the Midwest and South and subside in
the high-cost areas of the Northeast.''
   Prices of existing homes, meanwhile, rose 4.1 percent in 1988 to
a national median of $89,100, meaning half the homes cost more and
half cost less. For the fourth quarter of 1988, the median price was
down to $87,900.
   The group's survey of 62 metropolitan areas found stark
differences in median home prices around the nation, ranging from a
high of $231,200 in California's Orange County, which includes
Anaheim and Santa Ana, to a low of $53,500 in Oklahoma City.
   Two other California markets, San Francisco and Los Angeles,
ranked second and fourth in cost with median resale prices of
$228,100 and $191,200. Honolulu, with a median price of $225,000,
was third.
   The hot markets in California and Hawaii also recorded the
nation's largest price increases between the fourth quarter of 1987
and the same period last year.
   Prices in Orange County were up 32.2 percent, while they rose
29.6 percent in San Francisco, 24.6 percent in Los Angeles, and 18.6
percent in San Diego. In Hawaii, prices were up 16.4 percent.
   The increased sales activity in the Midwest resulted in healthy
price appreciation in several cities in that area, including
Chicago, where the median price last quarter rose to $101,400, up
10.8 percent from the fourth quarter of 1987.
   The $87,200 price in Minneapolis-St. Paul was up 8.2 percent and
Detroit's median of $73,400 was up 10.7 percent.
   ``In the Midwest, we are seeing prices increase in areas that
were largely bypassed by the housing expansion earlier in the
1980s,'' Tuccillo said.
   While prices in the Northeast remained high, costs in several
cities there showed little escalation and even dropped in some cases.
   Prices in fifth-ranked Boston moved up a modest 3 percent to
$182,800.
   In the New York metropolitan area, which includes Long Island and
northern New Jersey, prices were down 3.6 percent in the last
quarter of 1988, but still ranked sixth in the nation at $178,500.
   Seventh-ranked Hartford, with a median home price of $165,000,
saw prices edge up just 0.7 percent.
   ``In the Northeast, prices have basically run away from family
income,'' Tuccillo said. ``The market is slowing down there until
incomes can catch up.''
   The least expensive places to live were led by Oklahoma City,
where the median price was $53,500; followed by Des Moines, Iowa, at
$54,800; Louisville, Ky., at $55,600; Toledo, Ohio, at $56,400; and
Lansing, Mich., at $56,700.
   Prices in Oklahoma City fell 10.1 percent from the fourth quarter
of 1987, the sharpest drop in the survey. Other oil-dependent areas
also recorded falling prices, including Houston, where the median
dropped 9.6 percent to $56,800, and San Antonio, Texas, where the
median fell 8.1 percent to $62,100.

   Voters in a special primary Tuesday put
Tuskegee Mayor Johnny Ford, who is seeking to become Alabama's first
black congressman this century, into a runoff against Secretary of
State Glen Browder.
   The winner of the Democratic runoff on March 7 will face state
Sen. John Rice of Opelika, who won the Republican nomination amid a
light GOP turnout. The general election, on April 4, is to fill a
vacancy created by the Dec. 13 death of Rep. Bill Nichols, a
Democrat first elected in 1966.
   Ford, 46, ran strongly in his home base of predominantly black
Macon County and drew well enough elsewhere to make the runoff ahead
of state Sen. Jim Preuitt of Talladega and state Rep. Charles Adams
of Phenix City, two generally conservative figures who appeared to
have split each other's vote.
   ``We obviously received overwhelming support from the
African-American community, which is good,'' said Ford. ``Now that
we're in the runoff ... much of the quiet white support we got will
come out openly now.''
   Browder, a 46-year-old former Jacksonville State University
professor, received 14,701 votes, or 25 percent, followed by Ford
with 14,434 votes, or 24 percent, with all precincts reporting
unofficial returns. Trailing were Preuitt with 10,153 votes, or 17
percent, and Adams with 9,831 votes, or 17 percent. State Sens.
Gerald Dial and Donald Holmes and three other candidates shared the
remainder.
   ``We did not have a large media budget,'' said Browder, ``but we
had a lot of people working for us.''
   Among Republicans, Rice, a 37-year-old real estate developer,
avoided a runoff by winning 11,145 votes, or 62 percent, followed by
Ray Robbins with 4,647 or 26 percent and two other candidates.
   The 13-county 3rd Congressional District in east Alabama, which
contains the university town of Auburn and the industrial town of
Anniston as well as Tuskegee, is about 75 percent white.
   Prior to Nichols' death, Democrats held a 5-2 edge over
Republicans in the state's congressional lineup. The 3rd District is
traditionally Democratic, but since Alabama elected its first
Republican governor in a century in 1986, the GOP has hopes of
increasing its congressional numbers in Alabama for the first time
since five Republicans won in 1964.
   ``We're the party of the conservatives, the party with the
majority of the feelings in the South,'' said Rice. `` The key is
that it's a conservative district.''

<HEAD>Erratic Work Schedule, Sleeping Train Crew Blamed for Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal safety officials blame the fatal
head-on collision of two Conrail freight trains last year on work
schedules that deny train crews normal sleep, and called on the
industry to improve conditions.
   The National Transportation Safety Board, in a ruling Tuesday,
asked the railroad industry to ``make an in-depth assessment'' of
what it can do to ensure that crews operate trains without falling
asleep at the controls.
   The railroad industry has long had unpredictable work schedules,
but the problem has worsened, the board said. It blamed the
elimination of many regularly scheduled freight and passenger
trains, a cutback in yard operations, agreements protecting employee
seniority, longer freight runs and relocations of work assignments.
   ``Under present conditions, many train crew members may well work
their entire careers without ever having a job with regularly
assigned working hours and off-duty periods,'' the board said,
adding that this leads to sleep disorders.
   The recommendations came in a report on a Jan. 14, 1988, crash
that killed four men _ two engineers and two brakemen operating
Conrail trains that plowed into each other outside Thompsontown, Pa.
   The board concluded that engineer Melvin Russell Curry, 40, and
brakeman Francis Joseph Madonna, 46, were asleep when warning
devices went off and said Curry likely responded to the warning by
hitting a foot pedal in his sleep, deactivating an automatic braking
system.
   Killed in the crash in addition to Curry and Madonnna, were
engineer Russell Paul Henderson, 30, and brakeman Charles Stephen
DeSantis, 56, who were operating a 61-car train headed from Chicago
to Harrisburg, Pa.
   The two trains were moving at a combined speed of 71 miles per
hour when they collided, with one locomotive plowing over the top of
the other one.
   The board recommended several changes in the warning system,
safety controls, locomotive design and the line's computer-based
traffic control system, but it laid the brunt of blame on erratic
work schedules.
   ``The probable cause of this accident was the sleep-deprived
condition of the engineer and other crew members ... which resulted
in their inability to stay awake and alert,'' the board said.
   The report said none of the men on the coal train, which was
headed from Baltimore, Md., to Altoona, Pa., had had more than two
hours' sleep in the previous 22 to 24 hours, and they had not eaten
in more than 13 hours. The men had reported for work at 11:30 p.m.
and the crash was at 7:45 a.m. the next day.
   The report said Curry had a different starting time almost every
day and worked any day of the week. It said he had only about 1{
hours of sleep and an hour's nap in the 24 hours prior to the crash.
   Conrail spokeswoman Pat Linsky said the company could not comment
in detail until officials had reviewed the board report.
   But the railroad said Curry and Madonna had signed off their
previous runs 37.5 hours earlier and the conductor 50 hours before
boarding the Baltimore-Altoona train.
   The company also said that the safety board had a statement from
the engineer's wife saying he liked his job and had no problems with
the erratic hours.

   Diana Ross will be takin' care of Motown
business, or at least some of it, anyway, now that she has rejoined
the label as part owner and performer.
   Motown didn't reveal the size of the 44-year-old singer's
investment in the company when it announced the deal Monday.
   Motown founder Berry Gordy Jr. sold the company in June to a
partnership of MCA Inc. and Boston Ventures, an investment firm, for
a reported $61 million. MCA didn't say how the entertainer's
investment might fit in with the company's promise to maintain 20
percent minority ownership in Motown, once considered one of the
nation's largest and most successful black-owned businesses.
   Beginning with ``Baby Love'' in 1964, Miss Ross and the Supremes
recorded 12 No. 1-selling hits with Motown. She left Motown in 1980.
   Miss Ross is scheduled to release an album, ``Working Overtime,''
as part of her new exclusive contract with Motown, the company said.

   ``Diff'rent Strokes'' TV star Todd
Bridges, already jailed on an attempted murder charge, is under
investigation for armed robbery, a prosecutor says.
   A person police believe to be Bridges took the actor's BMW at
gunpoint from a repairman in south Los Angeles on Jan. 23 without
paying $500 owed, Deputy District Attorney Patti Ryan said Monday.
Ryan said there was no rush to file charges because the 23-year-old
actor is in jail.
   Bridges has pleaded innocent to attempted murder in the Feb. 2
shooting of a man in a home where police said cocaine was being
sold. He has been ordered held without bail.
   The actor has gotten into trouble over his car before. He
received a suspended sentence in January 1987 after pleading no
contest to making a bomb threat in a case that stemmed from the
bombing of an auto customizer's car during a dispute over work on
Bridges' Porsche.
   Bridges' attorney, Johnnie Cochran, didn't return calls placed to
his office Tuesday.

   Former President Nixon doesn't expect
future historians to judge him as the greatest chief executive,
daughter Julie Eisenhower says.
   ``He has never talked about it. He is extremely forward looking.
But he's a realist,'' said Mrs. Eisenhower, here with her husband,
David, for a lecture.
   ``He doesn't think they'll say he was the greatest president. But
many of his domestic programs were far reaching.''
   David Eisenhower said Tuesday his father-in-law was ``the most
durable politician'' ever to lead the nation. He also described his
grandfather, former President Eisenhower, as ``a politician who was
in soldier's garb for a time before he found his true calling at age

   Sophie, whose father is commodities broker Martin von Haselberg,

<HEAD>Flag Industry Spurs Probe Of Label-Switch Suggestion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A manufacturer's suggestion that American
companies buy foreign-made U.S. flags and replace ``Made in Taiwan''
labels with ``Made in USA'' is causing a small uproar on Capitol
Hill.
   ``In all my years as a member of Congress, few issues have struck
me as being as blatantly outrageous'' as the label-switch proposal,
Rep. Douglas Applegate, D-Ohio, wrote in a letter seeking a Customs
Service investigation.
   Applegate was one of several members of Congress who asked
Customs to look into the issue. The inquiries were triggered by a
letter-writing campaign by domestic flag manufacturers.
   ``I feel we can compete with a U.S. flag labeled `Made in Taiwan'
but we cannot compete with a U.S. flag labeled `Made in USA' when in
fact it wasn't,'' wrote Vane Scott, general manager of the Colonial
Flag Co. in Coshocton, Ohio.
   Scott provided Applegate with a copy of a three-page 1987
solicitation on the letterhead of the Ming Teh Flag Co. Ltd. of
Taipei, Taiwan, which suggested changing ``Made in Taiwan'' labels
after the flag shipments had cleared Customs.
   ``We can realize why you need to lift off this label ... to
prevent the resistance in U.S. to import flags,'' the solicitation
said. ``If possible, we suggest you cut off this label after you
receive the goods and spend very little cost to mark on the flags
your own brand name and Made In U.S.A. signs.
   ``We can offer the labels too,'' the solicitation added.
   The copy, which does not show to whom the solicitation was
originally addressed, was forwarded to Customs by several
congressional offices.
   But a Customs Service spokesman said the label-switch
solicitation itself may not make a good case.
   ``In the opinion of our folks here, the letter is in effect a
blueprint to a violation,'' Dennis Shimkoski said Tuesday. ``It's
like a book on how to make a bomb.
   ``If it were actually being done and people were in cahoots doing
what the letter suggested, that would be something else. After a
lengthy and complex investigation we might convict someone of a
misdemeanor.''
   About a week ago the Customs Service asked the Federal Trade
Commission to look into the situation.
   But Robert Easton, special assistant for enforcement in the FTC
Bureau of Consumer Protection, said there's no evidence yet that an
American flag importer has violated country-of-origin labeling
requirements.
   ``We can't do anything,'' Easton said. ``There's no violation in
just sending a letter.''
   If there is evidence of label-switching, the FTC could go to
court to stop the illegal practice, he said. And if any U.S. company
could show it lost business to a label-switcher, the Lanham
Trademark Act enables the company to file suit in federal court and
recover both the amount of lost profit and the cost of bringing the
suit.
   Without such a legal action, there's no way of telling whether
any U.S. company has been hurt by fraudulent imports, said Whitney
Smith, executive director of the Flag Research Center in Winchester,
Mass.
   The domestic flag industry is a small collection of privately
owned companies that make few public disclosures, he said.
   ``They're extremely secretive. They consider almost everything a
trade secret,'' he said.
   Smith said he had not heard of label-switching as a widespread
problem, but had heard complaints of textile companies in Taiwan,
Singapore and Hong Kong cutting into the domestic market with
foreign-made Stars and Stripes.
   In many cases, he said, the foreign companies send semi-finished
products to the United States, where they are completed and perhaps
packaged along with poles, decorative eagles, etc.
   If more than half of the contents in a package come from the
United States, a company can legally remove a country-of-origin
label such as ``Made in Taiwan,'' said Easton.
   But ``they can't say `Made in USA' unless it's made in the USA,''
he said.

   The Environmental Protection Agency and its
Ohio counterpart have barred their employees from a federal uranium
processing facility because of the risk of exposure to radioactivity.
   Tests indicated EPA personnel were exposed to uranium oxide when
they attended meetings at the Feed Materials Production Center in
Fernald, Ohio, EPA Regional Administrator Valdas Adamkus said in a
letter obtained Tuesday by congressional investigators.
   Adamkus ordered that no EPA personnel go to the site ``until this
health risk can be satisfactorily addressed.''
   The Ohio EPA followed suit Tuesday but characterized the move as
a precaution since its periodic checks have not revealed a similar
problem.
   The plant's operator said it believes the facility is safe and
questioned the accuracy of urine tests given to EPA employees. It
said it will try to demonstrate by the end of the week that its own
routine testing program is accurate.
   ``We don't know what lab EPA is using, but we have the utmost
confidence in our program,'' said William H. Kelley, spokesman for
Westinghouse Materials of Ohio, the contractor operating the plant
for the U.S. Department of Energy.
   A spokeswoman for Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste said the actions
reinforce the governor's desire ``to get an expert panel to look
into the situation, a panel of the caliber of the one that looked
into the (space shuttle) Challenger accident.''
   The Fernald plant has been the subject of intense scrutiny by
Congress and the press because of contamination problems and
allegations that its radioactive and chemical discharges may have
harmed people who live and work nearby.
   A long-range blueprint approved by President Reagan shortly
before he left office targeted the deteriorating uranium foundry as
the first that should be closed as the government modernizes its
network of nuclear bomb plants.
   Adamkus discussed his order Tuesday at a meeting in Chicago with
Joseph La Grone, the Energy Department's Oak Ridge Operations
Manager, EPA spokeswoman Ann Rowan said.
   The officials agreed to meet again on the subject but no date was
set and ``what we said in the letter still holds,'' she said.
   Ohio EPA Director Richard Shank decided to make a similar order
covering state EPA employees after meeting with the federal
officials in Chicago, spokesman Allan Franks said.
   ``As a precautionary measure, we have ordered our people who do
routine work to stay away from the site until a regular monitoring
system is set up,'' he said, adding that a state EPA safety health
officer would set up the monitoring system ``as soon as possible.''
   La Grone on Monday offered to have the Energy Department finance
new urine tests ``to determine whether there is truly a potential
personnel exposure problem or in fact a laboratory problem.''
   Adamkus' letter, dated Feb. 9, and La Grone's letter of response
were obtained Tuesday by the investigative staff of Rep. Tom Luken,
D-Ohio.
   Luken said he was upset that the EPA didn't notify Fernald
workers about the uranium oxide exposure threat.
   ``The public is totally unprotected when the monitor bars its own
inspectors from the premises,'' he said. ``If it's unsafe for EPA
shouldn't it be off limits to everyone? It is scary.''
   Kelley said workers at the plant in southwest Ohio, about 18
miles from Cincinnati, were notified Tuesday of the EPA actions.
   The plant, which processes uranium for use in nuclear weapons or
as fuel for reactors, is the subject of a lawsuit on behalf of
14,000 people who live or work nearby and believe their health has
been threatened by radioactive discharges into the air and water.
   Cincinnati attorney Stanley Chesley, an attorney in the $300
million class-action lawsuit, called the latest development ``an
example of the ongoing trauma that continues to plague this plant.''
   ``This is why we are so concerned about compensation to the
victims,'' he said. ``Every day there is another revelation.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush `Back Home' in Maine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the helicopter ``Marine One,''
bound from Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, N.H., reached the
Atlantic Ocean at twilight and whirred north along the rocky Maine
coast, its primary passenger suddenly grew animated.
   President Bush was headed home. Even though he and his wife
Barbara have lived in 31 homes in 17 cities, the comfortable
three-story gray shingle and stone house on the ocean is the only
one they own.
   ``You could see the sparkle in his eyes as he was getting closer
to home. He started pointing out houses of friends and neighbors as
we got closer. He loves being back in Kennebunkport,'' said Press
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater was aboard the presidential chopper with Bush last
weekend as the chief executive made his first visit back _ as
president _ to his family retreat, a stop on the way back to
Washington from a visit to Ottawa, Canada.
   But the seacoast village _ permanent population 1,200 _ had
changed even since the Bushes visited there last Thanksgiving.
   No longer can motorists drive unimpeded along Ocean Avenue, which
winds along the coast right past the Bush compound on a rockbound
promontory known as ``Walker's Point.'' The road passes so close
that you can easily pick out individuals on the lawn of the house.
   At night when the president is present, the road _ a main
thoroughfare _ is closed now where it passes the Bush home, except
to ``authorized personnel'' or to the three other families who live
in the secured stretch. They must carry large cards identifying
themselves as residents.
   Security officers standing by bright floodlights at two
checkpoints divert other traffic onto a back-road detour.
   During daylight hours, drivers are stopped and told they can
proceed, but only if they don't stop.
   A new Secret Service command post sits on the grounds, and a
Coast Guard cutter maintains a constant vigil offshore.
   Bush memorabilia now dominates windows in the stores bordering
Dock Square and along Route 9 on either side of the drawbridge that
crosses the Kennebunk River in the center of this summer vacation
spot.
   The items range from ``Kenne-BUSH-port'' sweatshirts to towels
showing a Bush character lounging in a beach chair, to cookbooks
featuring recipes from Barbara Bush (who insists she doesn't cook)
to postcards depicting the ``Summer Home of the President.''
   The postcards were wrong. It was deep February. Snow was on the
ground. And, even though only three rooms of the house are heated in
the winter, the Bushes were clearly intent on not limiting their
visits to the warm months.
   Nor were they about to spend all their time at home. The Bushes
last weekend walked into town to buy household items at a pharmacy,
visiting a lobster market on the way and causing something of a stir
all along the 1.5-mile route.
   They also attended services at the tiny two-room First
Congregational Church of Kennebunkport on Sunday, where the first
lady responded in a clear voice to a request by the Rev. Robert
Howes for any news of interest to the congregation.
   ``We had a new baby,'' Barbara Bush said, referring to their 11th
grandchild, Ashley Bush, who was born to Neil and Sharon Bush of
Denver earlier this month.
   Bush has told townspeople that he intends to keep coming back to
the house on the coast, where he has been coming for every one of
his 64 summers except once during World War II.
   He also promised to drive his speedboat slowly when in the
channel in the Kennebunk River, to permit lobstermen to continue to
work their traps in the cove next to his house, and to ``try not to
hold up traffic.''
   ``Barbara and I want to be good neighbors,'' he told a town rally
when he visited last Thanksgiving.
   The Bush compound is set on more than six acres of seashore land
that was purchased originally by the maternal grandfather after whom
Bush was named, George Herbert Walker Sr., a prominent stockbroker.
   The Bushes bought the house in 1981 from his mother, Dorothy
Walker Bush.
   During their marriage, the Bushes have owned two houses in
Midland, Texas, three in Houston, one in Washington and two in
Kennebunkport.
   All have been sold except for the one on the Maine coast, which
Bush has valued at about $1 million. (The overall compound is worth
$3.5 million, but Bush's mother still owns the land).
   In his 1987 biography, ``Looking Forward,'' Bush said that while
he was growing up, ``Maine in the summer was the best of all
possible adventures.''
   As president, it still seems to be, and not just in the summer.

<HEAD>Anti-Erosion Program Also Cuts Pollution, USDA Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   An Agriculture Department study shows that the
massive Conservation Reserve Program for taking fragile cropland
from production could save billions of dollars by helping clean up
the nation's rural water supply.
   The CRP was included in the 1985 farm law as a vehicle for taking
40 million to 45 million acres of highly erodible land from crop
production and planting it in protective grass and trees for 10
years.
   More than 28 million acres have been enrolled, and USDA officials
say further signups will bring the 1990 target within reach.
   Overall, the report said Tuesday, the CRP ``may generate an
estimated $3.5 billion to $4 billion in water quality benefits''
through reduced water treatment costs, lower sediment removal costs,
less damage to equipment that uses water, and increased recreational
fishing.
   Farming activities generate materials than can be carried into
waterways by runoff. These farm-generated pollutants include
nutrients from chemical fertilizers and animal manure, primarily
nitrogen and phosphorous; pesticides; sediment; and dissolved
minerals and salts, the report said.
   ``Sediment washing off cropland and into waterways can fill
reservoirs, block navigation channels, interfere with conveyance
systems, harm aquatic plant life and degrade recreational
resources,'' the report said.
   ``Potential for the CRP to bring about a major reduction in the
discharge of agricultural pollutants into waterways is large,
because of the large acreage involved and because only highly
erodible land is eligible to be enrolled,'' the report said.
   The study, by the department's Economic Research Service, said
the estimate of $3.5 billion to $4 billion in water benefits was
based on an assumption that the full 45 million acres would be
signed into the program.
   It said the benefit estimates are incomplete because neither the
benefits associated with swimming and commercial fishing nor those
from reduced pesticide use were taken into account.

   Farmers are going to use more fertilizer this
year, and they'll be paying higher prices for it, says the
Agriculture Department.
   Overall, fertilizer use by U.S. farmers is expected to rise 9
percent this year because of larger crop plantings and higher crop
prices, the department's Economic Research Service said Tuesday in a
report. By spring planting, prices are expected to average about 7
percent more than a year ago.
   World use of commercial fertilizers also is climbing, a trend
that is expected to continue at least for several more years.
   ``By the early 1990s, world growth in nitrogen demand could
exceed supply, leading to higher prices,'' the report said. ``The
developed countries will likely have excess phosphate supplies,
while the Soviet Union, Asia and Eastern Europe will be deficit
areas.''
   The greatest surplus of potash, another fertilizer ingredient, is
expected to be in North America, while Western Europe, Asia, Afria
and Latin America are projected to be in short supply, the report
said.
   Some other farm production items are likely to be more costly
this spring, including pesticides, up 2 percent to 5 percent; crop
seeds, 10 percent to 15 percent; and farm energy costs.
   ``Despite the drought, 1988 farm machinery expenditures rose an
estimated 5 percent to 10 percent over 1987,'' the report said. ``A
similar increase is likely in 1989, when expenditures could reach
$6.4 billion to $7.1 billion.''
   Last year's sales of most types of machinery remained stable or
increased, except for a 16 percent drop in combine sales, the report
said. Barring poor weather, sales of all major kinds of machinery
are expected to increase in 1989.

   The Agriculture Department plans to lower honey
supports for the 1989 crop by nearly 5 percent from last year, part
of a gradual decline specified by 1985 farm law.
   Milton Hertz, executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said Tuesday that the basic honey support
would be lowered to 56.36 cents per pound from 59.1 cents in 1988.
   Adjustments of the basic support can be made according to honey's
flower source, color, class, grade, location and other market
differentials.
   Details of the 1989 honey program were officially published Feb.
13 in the government's rule-making document, the Federal Register.
   Comments on the proposal can be sent by March 15 to: Director,
Commodity Analysis Division, USDA-ASCS, P.O. Box 2415, Washington,
D.C. 20013.
   Hertz also asked for comments on continuing the program's
``marketing loan'' provision, which allows producers to repay honey
price support loans at less than the original loan rate.
   In effect, this lets the producer to ``sell'' honey to the
government and then buy it back for less.
   Currently, for example, producers can buy back 1988-crop honey at
rates of 34 to 40 cents per pound, depending on quality. The CCC
loans originally were for 48 to 62 cents per pound.

<HEAD>Europeans Puzzle over U.S. Confirmation Probes</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Europeans generally seem puzzled by the probes into
the personal lives of people nominated for high U.S. government
posts, such as the investigation now of John Tower, the designee for
secretary of defense.
   Some say they think the deep probing that goes on inside and
outside Senate confirmation hearings in Washington may be harmful in
the long run.
   Such proceedings are virtually unknown in Western Europe, where
Cabinet ministers by and large are chosen from the ranks of loyal
party troopers who over the years have worked their way to the top.
   Any serious scrutiny nearly always comes after the fact.
   The difference is one of system of government. But it is also
cultural. In most European countries, a politician's private life is
sacrosanct. Except for the most extreme cases, personal foibles are
considered irrelevant to professional abilities.
   Tower's nomination is on hold while the FBI investigates
allegations about his drinking, womanizing and financial ties with
military contractors.
   ``The confirmation process in the United States is not very well
understood in Europe,'' said Dominique Moisi of the French
Insititute for International Relations. ``In France, when the
president of the republic asks his premier to choose a defense
minister, the Parliament has no say in the matter.''
   The president of France selects his premier from the majority
party in the National Assembly. The premier proposes a Cabinet to
the president, who has final say and makes the official
appointments. Ministers are nearly all known political faces, with
the occasional specialist thrown in.
   The French government as a whole can be voted out of office by
Parliament, but there is no individual confirmation process.
   That is generally the case throughout Western Europe.
   ``What's worrying about the entire American system is that the
way the press, now with the cooperation of Congress, is going with
these inquiries, it is going to be very hard to find people of real
ability to go into public life,'' said Anthony Barnes, a lecturer in
government at the London School of Economics.
   In Britain, the prime minister chooses the Cabinet, whose members
must also be legislators, and in practice all are members of the
governing party. There are no hearings, though MI5, the British
secret service, is widely believed to run checks on most members of
Parliament.
   ``The aggression on the private lives of individuals is pushed
too far in the United States,'' said Moisi. ``The sexuality of our
politicians, except in the most extreme cases, is never discussed in
public. The number of politicians with mistresses is numerous, but
never discussed. There is a sort of self-censorship.''
   Indeed, the peccadillos of some extremely high-ranking French
political figures are widely known but rarely mentioned publicly.
   At the time of the great brouhaha over Gary Hart's relationship
with Donna Rice, the big joke in Paris was that the French were not
at all shocked by the fact that Hart, a Democratic presidential
hopeful, spent the night with a woman. What disturbed them was he
said afterward that nothing happened.
   ``Typically American,'' Rome's La Repubblica newspaper said of
the Tower hearings, ``so full of ... puritanical echoes but in
reality dense with precise political intentions. Tower is the
sacrificial victim.''
   Wrote the Washington correspondent of the Paris' Le Monde: ``Even
if Mr. Tower finally is confirmed, he will arrive at the Pentagon in
a pitiful state.''
   Italy's Cabinet ministers ostensibly are named by the premier,
who is named by the president, but in reality, the parties negotiate
Cabinet spots during coalition-building.
   West Germany's ministers are selected by the chancellor and
approved by the president and the president of the Parliament, but
there are no hearings and no vote by Parliament.
   A West German government spokesman, Ulrich Strempel, said while
background and security checks are routinely made the selection
process ``is nothing like the unique system practiced in the United
States. But that doesn't mean some embarrassing details can't come
to light later that could spell a swift end to a ministerial
career.''
   Britain's Barnes said: ``To assess presidential choice for
integrity seems quite reasonable. But the pursuit of every kind of
tittle tattle about a man's sex life or the fact that he's been seen
with a drink in his hand seems to be carrying the process too far.
   ``No system is immune to corruption, but I'm not sure that a
corrupt appointee is more or less likely to be exposed in the United
States than here.''

<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department has released an 18-page
summary of savings and loan legislation the administration intends
to submit to Congress next week. Here is a summary of new details in
the document, which was released Tuesday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORP.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., with responsibility for both
bank and S&amp;L deposits, would get broad new power to countermand
regulatory decisions by the primary regulator of S&amp;Ls, the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, which would become part of the Treasury
Department.
   Regulators would restrict interest rates offered by insolvent
institutions, limit the institutions' growth and their ability to
obtain high-cost deposits from money brokers.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CAPITAL RULES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The FDIC would get the power to put an institution into
receivership if its capital falls below what the FDIC determines is
a safe level, even if it is still solvent.
   Currently, an institution can't be closed until all of its
capital is exhausted. Advocates of ``early closure'' say it would
save money for government insurance funds.
   S&amp;L owners by June 1991 are being required to come up with money
to raise capital levels from the required 3 percent to the 6 percent
level now in force for commercial banks. In the meantime, regulators
would be required to restrict the growth of any institution that
doesn't meet the capital requirements.
   As a way of bringing new capital into the industry, bank holding
companies would be allowed to buy healthy S&amp;Ls after two years.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEPOSIT INSURANCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Bush plan calls for raising bank insurance premiums from 8.3
cents per $100 to 15 cents and S&amp;L premiums from 20.8 cents to 23
cents. But, in extraordinary circumstances, insurance fund
administrators could increase the premium by 50 percent a year up to
a maximum of 75 cents. Currently, Congress must approve any increase.
   The insurance fund would also be allowed to raise the insurance
premiums for individual institutions as their capital fell closer to
failure levels.
   The Treasury Department would have 18 months to finish a study on
reducing the scope of deposit insurance.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CREDIT UNIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Accounting rule changes would have the effect of requiring the
nation's 14,000 credit unions to come up with about $1.5 billion
over eight years to strengthen the National Credit Union Share
Insurance Fund. The rules would also make it costly for a federally
insured credit union to pull out and enter a private insurance plan.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SAVINGS AND LOAN RESCUES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Officials of the restructured regulatory system would be directed
to review last year's rescue of 205 S&amp;Ls with the goal of reducing
the government's costs. The government can't undo the deals, but it
could exercise contract rights reducing the ultimate cost of
assistance to the new owners of rescued S&amp;Ls.
   In the future, regulators would have to take tax losses to the
government into consideration before deciding on the best rescue
method. Regulators' ability to use promissory notes and loss
guarantees would be restricted.
   The Federal Asset Disposition Association, a much-criticized
quasi-government agency created to manage and sell off assets from
failed S&amp;Ls, would be abolished within six months.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>S&amp;L CONVERSIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Currently, S&amp;Ls are prohibited from converting into banks until
August. The Bush plan would extend that for five years. After that,
S&amp;Ls could convert by paying an exit fee to the S&amp;L insurance fund
and an entrance fee to the bank fund. Large healthy S&amp;Ls looking to
become banks much sooner than five years likely will fight this
provision.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Banks and S&amp;Ls would have to bail out sister institutions owned
by the same holding company.
   Regulators would be allowed to offer whistleblowers a reward for
reporting bank fraud and give regulators the power to require that
fired informants be reinstated and given back pay.
   The administration leaves open the question of whether banks and
S&amp;Ls would carry the same insurance logo on their doors. Banks want
the logos to clearly differentiate between banks and S&amp;Ls. S&amp;Ls say
the logo should be the same since deposits in both kinds of
institutions are federally insured.

   An Army National Guard helicopter
based in Colorado crashed Tuesday while en route to war games in the
desert, killing one crewman and injuring the other, the Air Force
said.
   The AH-1 Cobra gunship went down at 1:30 p.m. about 50 miles
northwest of Las Vegas while on its way to an exercise at the Nellis
Air Force Base range, Air Force Sgt. Ronald Bloise said.
   The dead crew member was identified as Chief Warrant Officer
Howard P. Osterlin, 47, of Lakewood, Colo. Osterlin was the co-pilot
and had 24 years of military service, National Guard spokesman Bruce
Collins said.
   The pilot, Warrant Officer Craig A. Temmer, 28, of Denver, was
taken to the Nellis hospital, where he was treated for minor
injuries.
   Collins said the two-seat attack helicopter was assigned to the
2nd Battalion 135th Aviation unit at Buckley Air National Guard base
in Aurora, Colo., and had been participating in Red Flag exercises
at Nellis since Feb. 4.
   Red Flag is a simulated war games program conducted several times
each year at the southern Nevada base. The exercise draws Air Force
units from around the world for mock combat.
   Bloise said an emergency response team was dispatched to the
crash site, about five miles west of an auxiliary air field in
Indian Springs.
   Bloise said a board of Army officers will investigate the
accident.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top adviser to President Bush says the
administration will fight any effort to scuttle proposals designed
to sever the close relationship between federal regulators and the
savings and loan industry.
   Bush's proposal to restructure the S&amp;L regulatory system is
inseparable from any infusion of taxpayer money, Richard C. Breeden,
assistant to the president, said in an interview at the White House
on Tuesday.
   Last week, Bush proposed spending $126 billion over the next
decade to close or sell failed S&amp;Ls, $40 billion of it a direct
charge against the taxpayers and federal budget.
   He also would wrap the independent Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
which regulates the nation's 3,000 S&amp;Ls, into the Treasury
Department and merge the staff of the S&amp;L deposit insurance fund
into the larger Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which guarantees
commercial bank accounts.
   S&amp;L industry officials have denounced the restructuring plan as a
power grab by the Treasury Department and have vowed to fight it.
Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the House Banking
subcommittee with jurisdiction over S&amp;Ls, has promised to help them.
   Breeden said the bank board, as an independent agency, has a
``long history of a close relationship with the industry it
regulates.''
   ``The president wants to be able to say to the American public
that we are ensuring that this (crisis) will not happen again and he
can't make that promise if the agency that has responsibility for
oversight isn't accountable to him,'' Breeden said.
   ``At $40 billion, we're talking about the equivalent of something
on the order of 100 billion school lunches. ... I find it
inconceivable to suggest that we would drop a $40 billion check in
the mail and just say, `Well, we hope you use it wisely and we hope
things come out better next time,''' he said.
   Breeden said the administration would ``spare no effort'' to help
Congress meet Bush's challenge to pass the S&amp;L program in 45 days.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee, and Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the committee's
senior Republican, have already agreed to introduce the
administration program.
   An inch-thick draft of the bill was sitting on Breeden's desk
Tuesday and he said it likely would be submitted to Congress next
week. He described the tone of discussion on the issue between the
administration and legislators as excellent.
   ``I hope things will go smoothly, but I don't want to be
unrealistic,'' he said. ``We are proposing some profound long-run
changes in the regulatory system.''
   Breeden, a 39-year-old lawyer, came to the administration from
the Washington office of the well-connected Texas law firm of Baker
&amp; Botts. Previously, he served as staff director of a task force on
financial regulation, chaired by Bush as vice president.
   Breeden said the president's plan also would make changes to
insulate S&amp;L examiners from the institutions they regulate.
   Examiners work for the regional Federal Home Loan Banks, which
lend money to individual S&amp;Ls and are owned by the industry. Breeden
said the administration would expand the boards of directors of the
12 regional banks to include more members representing the general
public. Bush would also have examiners report directly to top
regulatory officials in Washington rather than to the regional bank
presidents, he said.

<HEAD>Hill Report Says Reagan Administration Sought Third-Country Aid for
Contras</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration, thwarted by Congress
in its efforts to provide money to the Nicaraguan Contras, sought
aid for the rebels from third countries starting in 1984, according
to testimony from a 1987 congressional investigation into the
Iran-Contra affair.
   ``Between June 1984 and the beginning of 1986, the president, the
national security adviser and the National Security Council staff
secretly raised $34 million for the Contras from other countries,''
said a congressional report, based on hearings into how officials
sold weapons to Iran and then diverted the proceeds to the Contras.
   The issue of third-country support for the Contras surfaced this
week at the trial of Oliver L. North, the former National Security
Council aide and chief architect of the Iran-Contra plan.
   North's attorneys claim that a plan to protect state secrets
during the trial will prevent them from showing that former
President Reagan and other top administration officials offered
inducements to foreign governments in soliciting military aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   The congressional report said Saudi Arabia gave the lion's share
of the money _ $32 million _ to the Contras after Congress balked at
appropriating military aid to the rebels in late 1984. Taiwan gave
$2 million in that period.
   The report detailed how U.S. officials from the NSC, the CIA and,
eventually, the State Department sought financial assistance to keep
alive the Contras' war against Nicaragua's Marxist regime. Some
solicitations to third countries were unsuccessful.
   The Saudis were the first to contribute to the Contras in June
1984 after the rebels had exhausted the last portion of U.S.
assistance.
   Before that, U.S. officials had been rebuffed in an approach to
Israel, and declined an offer by South Africa to donate money, said
the report, which does not identify the countries by name. Officials
later confirmed the names.
   Robert McFarlane, the former national security adviser, testified
that the Saudi ambassador agreed initially to contribute $1 million
a month through the end of the year.
   In February 1985, the Saudis pledged another $24 million, meaning
the oil-rich kingdom handed over a total of $32 million to the
Contras between June 1984 and March 1985.
   After the Saudis' first offer, McFarlane said he told Reagan and
then-Vice President Bush about contribution, and was informed of
Reagan's ``satisfaction and pleasure that this had occurred.''
   But other top White House officials had second thoughts about
accepting contributions for the Contras, the report said.
   Secretary of State James Baker III, then the White House chief of
staff, reportedly said it would be an ``impeachable offense'' for
the United States to act as a conduit for third-country funding for
the Contras, according to the testimony of Baker's predecessor,
George Shultz. Baker later said he did not recall using that
language, but was concerned about legalities.
   Because of his objections to third country solicitations, Shultz
was not told of the contributions from Saudi Arabia, the report said.
   But North arranged for the transfer of money to Contra leader
Adolfo Calero on June 25, 1984, the report said.
   Later officials at the CIA and the Justice Department agreed
there would be no legal problem with third countries giving money to
the Contras so long as the United States did not appropriate the
money.
   Former Attorney General William French Smith also said the donors
could not expect Washington ``to repay that commitment in the
future,'' Stanley Sporkin, a former CIA general counsel, said.

   Here is a chronology of key events in the
Oliver North Iran-Contra case, from his indictment through Tuesday's
developments.

<NOTE>1988</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   March 16 _ North, former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter and two others are indicted on charges they conspired to
divert Iranian arms sales profits to the Contras. ``I can assure you
I will never give up, we will win, I just cannot tell you how
soon,'' North says.
   March 18 _ North announces his retirement from the Marine Corps
because he may subpoena ``the highest ranking officials in our
government.''
   June 6 _ U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell, who authorized
turning over 300,000 documents to the defense, warns that the danger
of exposing the nation's most sensitive secrets poses a serious
obstacle to pursuing the conspiracy charges against the four
defendants.
   June 8 _ Gesell orders separate trials for the four defendants;
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, the next day, chooses North
for the leadoff trial.
   Sept. 30 _ An appeals court rebuffs an attempt by North and two
other defendants to stop the prosecution.
   Nov. 7 _ One of 16 criminal counts, fabricating a document, is
dismissed.
   Nov. 21 _ Gesell warns that if North stands trial, the court will
have little control over the testimony of witnesses ``acquainted
with high security matters.'' He appeals to President Reagan to
decide whether North is to be pardoned.
   Nov. 29 _ Gesell refuses to dismiss two of the central charges
against North, conspiracy to defraud the government and theft of
government property. He dismisses a third, wire fraud.
   Dec. 1 _ Reagan rules out a North pardon but says ``duty
requires'' his administration to block release of secret documents
North wants for his trial.
   Dec. 1 _ Mexican officials disclosed that Amiram Nir, the Israeli
go-between in secret U.S. arms deals with Iran, died Nov. 30 in a
plane crash in Mexico while traveling under an assumed name.
   Dec. 12 _ Gesell tells North he can't use 3,500 secret documents,
that he can use more than 300, roughly the same number planned to be
introduced as evidence by the prosecution. The decision removes a
major obstacle to the trial going forward.
   Dec. 30 _ North subpoenas Reagan and President-elect Bush as
defense witnesses. Gesell, after Bush is sworn in the following
month, rules that the sitting president cannot be called. He
postpones a decision regarding Reagan pending further hearings.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>1989</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Jan. 5 _ Prosecutors ask Gesell to dismiss conspiracy and theft
charges, citing North's ``insistence on introducing classified
information in his defense'' and the Reagan administration's refusal
to release material the judge ruled North would need. Gesell later
dismisses those counts.
   North remains charged with 12 crimes, including lying to Congress
in 1985 and 1986 about his efforts on behalf of the Contras and
lying to the attorney general about the National Security Council's
role in diverting money from the Iran arms sales.
   He also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 security

<HEAD>Bush Still Behind on Appointments, Calls for Quicker Background Checks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is still trying to fill scores
of top government posts and has asked his legal counsel to look into
ways to speed up background checks on people he wants to appoint, a
White House source said.
   Bush is frustrated by a drawn-out process that is keeping him
from putting people in place and moving his agenda forward, said the
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The president, at a Tuesday meeting of his top assistants,
expressed impatience and told White House counsel C. Boyden Gray to
see what he could do about speeding up the process, the source said.
   That source and another official said much of the problem
involves the lengthy FBI background-checking process and the
requirement that a person who worked for one government agency in
the past must start anew in the process when picked for a different
agency.
   But White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush is
moving slowly in making nominations partly because of attempts to
recruit women and minorities, people from outside government who are
undergoing checks for the first time.
   ``We're in no particular hurry,'' Fitzwater told reporters at the
daily White House briefing.
   He said some 130 appointments were being checked by the FBI, and
the administration was ``particularly trying to find women and
minorities for many of these positions.''
   ``Some of the background checks are taking longer than has been
the case in the past,'' he said.
   In the meantime, many of these key jobs are being held by Reagan
administration holdovers.
   In the first weeks of the Reagan administration in 1981, dozens
of such key nominations had been confirmed by the Senate. There so
far has been no confirmation of anyone but some Cabinet nominees.
   The Washington Post reported Tuesday that Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher complained to White House staff chief John Sununu
about the selection process.
   Fitzwater said he believed that the report overstated Mosbacher's
frustration with the situation.
   On another matter, Fitzwater said that in selecting people for
ambassadorial posts, Bush wants to find the best-qualified
candidates, not necessarily use the posts to reward old friends and
supporters.
   Few ambassadorial appointments have been announced. The New York
Times reported Tuesday, however, that Bush has honored tradition by
rewarding major campaign contributors with plum assignments.
   The newspaper mentioned the appointment of J.P. Curley Jr. of New
York, a fund-raiser and family friend, to become ambassador to
France; Peter Secchia, the Republican national committeeman from
Michigan, ambassador to Italy; investor and developer Joseph Zappala
of Tampa, Fla., ambassador to Spain; Florida developer Melvin F.
Sembler, ambassador to Australia; and Fredrick Bush, deputy finance
chairman of the campaign and no relation to the president,
ambassador to Luxembourg.
   Fitzwater said Bush wants ``qualified men and women of recognized
leadership and ability. And we think all our ambassador appointments
will be of the highest quality.''

   The government could save more money in the
long run if it paid for the early detection and treatment of a
blinding disease in diabetics, says a study that is one of a growing
number to stress the economics of health care.
   ``The cost of saving a year of sight is substantially less _
approximately one seventh _ the cost of a year of disability paid by
the federal government (to the blind),'' Dr. Jonathan C. Javitt, an
ophthalmologist at the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins
University and principal author of the eye disease study, said in an
interview Tuesday.
   In the face of soaring health care costs, more researchers are
considering the financial implications of expensive medical
treatments and the savings that can be had through preventive
measures.
   This growing new class of research based on financial as well as
clinical considerations of treatment comes from the ``recognition
that just outcomes of care without sensitivity to cost is not
enough,'' said Jonathan Weiner, associate professor of health policy
at Johns Hopkins.
   The studies come in response to increasing pressures from the
federal government and other health-care payers in the face of
escalating health care costs and the consequences for an estimated
35 million Americans who don't qualify for government health
assistance and can't afford private insurance.
   ``More and more clinical journals are talking about cost
effectiveness,'' Weiner said, and doctors are increasingly looking
at ``dollars along with their doses.''
   The eye disease that was the subject of the study, diabetic
retinopathy, is the leading cause of new cases of blindness among
working-age Americans. The study said more than 70 percent of
diabetics will develop the disease in their lifetime.
   Early detection and treatment of the eye disease, though, can
reduce the likelihood of severe vision loss by 60 percent, said the
study published in the February issue of Ophthalmology, the journal
of the American Academy of Ophthalmology.
   As many as 880,000 of the 11 million Americans who have diabetes
have no medical insurance, and many more may be underinsured, the
study said. These people are less likely than insured diabetics to
seek medical care for screening and treatment of the eye disease.
   Early screening and treatment could save an average three years
of sight for each diabetic, the study said. Adding up the costs of
screening and treatment for all diabetic patients, this amounts to
an average savings of $966 for each year of sight saved per person,
the study said.
   In contrast, the average annual cost of Social Security
disability payments made to each American worker disabled by
diabetes-related vision loss is $6,900, the study said. In addition,
anyone who remains eligible for Social Security disability insurance
for two years automatically becomes eligible for Medicare benefits.
   Javitt and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins' Dana Center for
Preventive Ophthalmology developed a computer model that analyzed
progression of the disease, vision loss in afflicted patients,
treatment outcome and mortality.
   These disease-related events were applied statistically to 31,000
cases _ the estimated number of new cases of juvenile-onset,
insulin-dependent diabetes each year in the United States. People
with this kind of diabetes generally get the disease before age 30.
   Diabetes deteriorates small blood vessels in the body, including
those in the retina at the back of the eye. In the early stages of
the eye disease, weakened blood vessels may leak, causing the retina
to swell and resulting in blurred vision.
   In more advanced stages of the disease, the retina becomes so
starved of oxygen-carrying blood, new blood vessels begin to grow,
but they tend to rupture and bleed. This results in more scarring
and blurred vision and can cause the retina to detach from the back
of the eye, which often leads to severe vision loss or blindness.
   The most common treatment for the eye disease is laser therapy,
which seals the blood vessels and halts the disease's progress.
   The computer model predicted that 54 percent of the 31,000 people
studied would have severe vision loss if not screened or treated for
the eye disease, compared with 28 percent who received early
treatment.

<HEAD>Panel Urges Dropping Social Security Funds From Deficit Count</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Social Security trust fund should be
removed from calculations of the federal deficit because it makes
the budget picture too optimistic and undermines the retirement
program, a House panel says.
   ``The Social Security trust funds represent an opportunity for
current workers to save for their retirement,'' the report said.
``But, they cannot have this effect if they are used simply to
offset current deficits in other federal accounts.''
   The task force, appointed by House Democrats Byron Dorgan of
North Dakota and Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio, included a bipartisan
group of economists. The panel's view echoes a growing perception on
Capitol Hill that using Social Security taxes to hide shortfalls in
the government's operating budget is flawed and allows a drain on
the economy.
   The 1983 revisions to the Social Security law increased
retirement taxes on workers to build up a surplus that would protect
the Baby Boom generation when it retires early in the next century.
According to recent calculations by the Congressional Budget Office,
the Social Security trust fund surplus reduces the deficit by $56
billion this year and will soon top $100 billion a year.
   But because that money is covering the shortfall in the rest of
the budget, the government-enforced savings is essentially
cancelled, the task force said.

<NOTE>U.S., Soviets to Work Together Against Illegal Salmon Fishing</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union have
agreed to work more closely in efforts to curb illegal salmon
fishing in international waters of the Pacific Ocean, the State
Department says.
   Department officials said Tuesday that negotiators from the two
countries had decided that illegal salmon fishing on the high seas
by other nations represented an ``irrational and wasteful harvesting
method and that all efforts should be taken to prevent the
unauthorized possession, harvest, transport and sale of salmon in
the North Pacific.''
   American fishing groups have contended that illegal catches by
foreign trawlers, sometimes under the guise of fishing for squid,
have already resulted in depleted salmon runs in the Pacific
Northwest and Alaska.
   Soviet and U.S. negotiators, meeting last week in Washington,
signed a memorandum of understanding in which the two countries
agreed to ``increase their bilateral cooperation in the field of
enforcing salmon conservation measures.''

<NOTE>Blend VA, Military Hospital Systems, Says Leader of Vets Group</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Disabled American Veterans say military and
veterans' hospitals can save money and improve care by working
together more often.
   The three military hospital systems and the Veterans
Administration system are in ``deep trouble'' because of years of
financial starvation in the face of growing patient demands, said
Billy E. Kirby, national commander of the group.
   Lack of money has brought about losses of staff and beds and a
rationing of care, he said Tuesday at a joint hearing of the House
and Senate Veterans Affairs committees.
   In 1982 Congress permitted local installations to agree with
their neighbors in another hospital system to share facilities _ for
example, to send over patients needing a CAT scan rather than buy a
second scanner. There are now 1,800 agreements involving 300
installations.
   ``Rather than settling for locally initiated ad hoc agreements,
the more ambitious of which often encounter bureaucratic resistance,
we propose the creation of a new nationwide Veterans
Administration-Department of Defense health care alliance,'' Kirby
said.

   Highway trucks will spread a non-corrosive,
non-polluting de-icer made of corn rather than salt if a scientist
at a federal lab succeeds in reducing the cost of the product.
   The goal is to eliminate use of salt, which penetrates concrete
and corrodes metal and steel, doing damage to highways, bridges and
the cars that travel them.
   ``There are several advantages of the corn-based de-icer,'' said
William Bryan, a chemical engineer at the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's research laboratory here.
   ``It's not only non-corrosive to automobile bodies, roads and
bridges _ it's actually acts as an inhibitor. Plus, it's
non-polluting and it would create a new market for corn products,''
Bryan said Tuesday.
   The corn-based de-icer, a compound called calcium magnesium
acetate or CMA, already is produced commercially but only on a small
scale.
   State highway departments simply can't afford to make a large
investment in it because it costs so much more than salt _ $600 per
ton versus $25.
   But some state officials, such as New York's Lawrence Hudson, say
eliminating salt can save money in the long run.
   ``For every ton of salt we buy for $25 and put on the road,
society ends up paying a great deal more _ about $1,000 per ton,''
said Hudson, of the New York State Energy Research and Development
Authority.
   ``The problem is that CMA is very expensive. We must find a way
to bring down the cost of CMA so that state highway departments can
afford it without needing a tax increase.''
   New York state uses about 1 million tons of salt each winter, or
about 11 percent of the national total, said Hudson, who estimates
his state's damage from salt to roads, bridges, automobiles and
environment at $900 million to $2 billion a year.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates the national
damage at $5 billion.
   Bryan plans to dramatically reduce the cost of the corn de-icer
by using a new production process.
   ``It's unknown how much we can reduce the cost but I certainly
think we can cut it in half,'' he said. ``But we're looking at a
tougher fermentation process and it will be difficult to handle on a
large scale. That's the problem.''
   Bryan said the key to his project is finding a more efficient way
to convert sugar to acetic acid _ a primary component of the corn
de-icer. His plan involves a new fermentation process that requires
temperatures of 140 degrees in large air-free vats.
   The environmental advantages are as important as the economics of
replacing salt, Bryan said, suggesting the corn de-icer would help
alleviate acid rain and reduce groundwater pollution and vegetation
loss due to salt runoff.
   As an example, he said sodium levels in some Massachusetts water
supplies are too high for people on low-sodium diets. That problem
prompted Massachusetts to field test CMA on its highways.
   ``This is the third year we've tried CMA and, except for the
cost, we're pleased with its effectiveness and optimistic about
decreasing sodium levels in our water supplies,'' said Mark Cain, an
engineer with the Massachusetts Department of Public Works.

   Some grassroots lobbyists are bound for the

_ on one of those products you just can't find in fancy Georgetown
bistros.
   We're talking about venison sausage.
   About three dozen folks from Superior, a blue collar town of
27,000 on the shore of Lake Superior, are taking suitcases full of
the stuff to Washington on Monday in hopes of influencing as many
Wisconsin congressmen and staff members as they can on a $1,000
budget.
   They'll also bring smoked salmon, wild rice, smoked turkey and
artificial crabmeat, paper plates to eat it on and plenty of
Wisconsin beer and mineral water to wash it all down.
   ``It'll be the lobbying event of the year,'' promised state Rep.
Frank Boyle, who spent Thanksgiving weekend negotiating icy
northwoods roads in his pickup, collecting the carcasses of
illegally killed deer to make sausage for the trip.
   The Superior lobbyists plan to talk to lawmakers about Food for

a federal penitentiary in Superior, which is known for punishingly

   Len Powell is building a business,
selling what appears to be one of the most abundant products in
Georgia _ road kill opossum.
   His 3-ounce cans are labeled ``Sun Dried Georgia Possum.
Contents: Pure Possum killed by a log truck on U.S. 19 South in
Thomasville, Ga.''
   The novelty items, a salable embodiment of every 'possum pancake
joke ever heard, are being sold around Georgia, Powell said. He
quickly added that they're just a joke and don't really contain
road-killed marsupial meat.
   ``It's just potted meat. It wouldn't hurt somebody to eat it,''
he said. But after a pause, he added, ``Between the two, you'd
probably rather have 'possum.''
   The label _ which reads ``GUARANTEED SUN-CURED FOR ONE DAY'' _
also has serving instructions: ``Serve on crackers. Goes best with
sweet potatoes, R.C. Cola and a Moon Pie.''
   Powell said he modeled his product after a similar one he saw in
Alabama, and initially gave them away to customers at his
Thomasville nursery.
   ``People started wanting 'em so much I started selling 'em,'' he
said, adding that they're now sold in about 70 stores around the
state.
   Powell said he's expanding with labels for Mississippi,
Louisiana, Alabama, Tennessee and South Carolina. In addition, he
markets cans of ``road-killed'' armadillo, which he calls, ``possum

   Some northeastern Alabamans profess to be
bewildered by an unidentified flying object _ a fast, silent craft
described variously as looking like an airplane or a banana with
lights on it.
   Police Chief Junior Garmany, who went with Assistant Police Chief
Fred Works to check out reports to his office, said the object was
still hovering when officers arrived Friday night.
   ``We got out of the car and we turned off the engine and the
radio,'' he said. ``When we started towards it, it began moving
away.''
   People from Grove Oak to Lickskillet were left Tuesday with
speculation, but no explanation, as to what they had seen.
   Garmany said the craft was ``bigger than a jumbo jet,'' covered
with green, white and red lights and ``going about three or four
hundred miles an hour.'' An Oak Grove woman described the object as
shaped like a banana with the arch upright. ``There was a red light
on each end and a white light in a line between them. The top of the
curve was outlined in green light,'' the woman, who asked not to be
identified, told the Fort Payne Times-Journal.
   According to the newspaper, the sheriff's office got another call
from a Lickskillet resident who said, ``You better get a deputy over

<HEAD>Scotland Has A Princess, After Battle Royal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 2{-year-old girl has won the right to be named
Princess after a battle royal between her parents and officials from
Buckingham Palace and the Scottish bureaucracy.
   Princess Dulcima Rosetta Manwaring-Spencer claims no royal
connections but her parents liked the name and never imagined they'd
run into problems with the royal family and the government.
   Audrey and Hugh Manwaring-Spencer finally emerged triumphant last
week when Scotland's registrar general of births, deaths and
marriages backed down and decided there was no specific authority
banning the use of names like Princess.
   ``They're very pleased that it's finally been resolved and they
can finally call their little girl Princess,'' said Martin Johnson,
a family spokesman. ``They always assumed common sense would
prevail.''
   Princess and her parents remained unavailable for comment the
non-paying media. They were on their farm on the Isle of Skye off
Scotland's west coast, which is better known for its rugged beauty
than its courtly graces.
   Shortly after the girl was born July 5, 1986, the registry clerk
on the Isle of Skye duly recorded Princess Dulcima Rosetta on her
birth certificate and she was baptized with those names.
   ``We simply liked the name,'' Mrs. Manwaring-Spencer told The
Associated Press last year when the problem surfaced. ``Every family
argues over what to call their children. We liked Princess.''
   The birth certificate was sent to the registrar general in
Edinburgh, which wrote back five months later saying the name was
unacceptable and demanded that Manwaring-Spencers hand over their
copy of the certificate.
   ``Based upon an Order in Council of 1910, the name Princess is
not a recognized forename in this country because it is part of the
Crown's royal prerogative and cannot be assumed or entered in any
register or official document without the consent of the
sovereign,'' the letter said.
   The Manwaring-Smiths, tenant farmers who have four other
children, took up the challenge and wrote to Queen Elizabeth II.
   In December 1987, royal aide Robert Fellowes wrote back: ``You
may rest assured that you have caused no offense to the queen and
you may continue to use the word as your daughter's Christian name.''
   But three weeks later, Fellowes wrote again to inform the
Manwaring-Spencers the 1965 Scottish birth registration law ruled
out the name Princess.
   Last week, after an investigation by the registrar general, the
Manwaring-Spencers were informed that the name Princess could remain
on the registry of births, said a Scottish Office spokesman,
requesting anonymity.
   One of the main conclusions of the investigation was the
registrar general had ``no specific authority as such for preventing
the use of the name Princess on a birth register,'' the spokesman
said Tuesday.
   ``It's not a change in rules,'' he said. ``It's merely a change
in practice and attitude as interpreted by the registrar general's
office in Scotland.''
   A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman, also requesting anonymity, said:
``There's been no objection from here. It's been a question of
abiding by the law.''

<HEAD>Priest Accused Of Vatican Ties Released From Jail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An elderly priest in the underground Roman
Catholic church who was alleged to have received money from the
Vatican has been released from jail after 2{ months, a Chinese
official said.
   The Rev. Liu Shuhe, 69, who also uses the name Paul, was arrested
in October after allegedly meeting with an unidentified Italian.
   The Italian Embassy said today it did not know of any Italian
having been in contact with Liu and was not familiar with the case.
   Police confiscated $12,000 he was carrying and alleged that it
was sent from the Vatican, an official of Liu's home county said
Tuesday.
   Contacts with the Vatican, with whom China has no relations, are
illegal.
   Shen Rongbin of the Civil Affairs Committee in Yi County, about
60 miles south of the capital, said Liu was jailed there and
released Jan. 16.
   Shen said Liu maintained that the money was mailed to him by a
former classmate now in the Philippines. But Shen said Liu was known
to be in contact with the Vatican through foreign travelers to China
and the mail.
   The Vatican, a sovereign state within Italy, still recognizes the
Nationalist Chinese on Taiwan as the rightful rulers of all China.
   The Communists who took power in 1949 set up their own Catholic
Patriotic Association to manage Catholic church affairs, and ordered
all Chinese Catholics to renounce allegiance to the Vatican.
   Liu was among hundreds of priests, nuns and laymen who were
arrested in the 1950s and released only in the 1970s because of
their refusal to renounce the Vatican.
   An unknown number of Catholics still loyal to the Vatican
continue to worship in the underground church. China's official
Catholic church claims more than 3 million members.
   An undetermined number of Protestants also hold illegal services
at ``house churches'' because they reject the government-run
Protestant church organization.
   Foreign Catholic and Protestant groups supply underground
worshipers with Bibles and other religious materials carried in by
tourists.
   China and the Vatican have held behind-the-scenes talks for
several years but do not appear near reaching agreement on
rapprochement.

   The government must stop trying to turn national
forests in the mountains of southern Appalachia into tree farms,
says a conservation group which calls the U.S. Forest Service's
plans for them ``seriously flawed.''
   The service's plans for the six forests in Virginia, the
Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia ``continue to threaten the region's
environment'' with extensive clearcutting, road construction and
other actions, the Wilderness Society said in a report released
today.
   The government must begin developing a regional approach to
protecting the forests, which offer recreational and wildlife
benefits not found anywhere else in the area, the Washington-based
group said.
   ``We want them to manage them as an ecosystem, not just isolated
units,'' said Peter Kirby, the society's Southeastern regional
director.
   Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., chairman of the agriculture
subcommittee on conservation and forestry, said in a statement that
he was greatly disturbed by the report, ``Mountain Treasures At
Risk,'' and his panel would examine some of its findings.
   The report, released today at the group's southeastern regional
headquarters here, covers the Jefferson National Forest in Virginia,
the Cherokee, Pisgah and Nantahala in Tennessee and North Carolina,
the Sumter in South Carolina and the Chattahoochee in Georgia, which
essentially surround the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
   The forests cover about 4,700 square miles, roughly the size of
Connecticut.
   ``The Wilderness Society maintains that plans for the Southern
Appalachian national forests are seriously flawed,'' the report said.
   While demand for wilderness recreation is increasing, the Forest
Service plans to designate 60 percent of the areas suitable to be
made wilderness areas as suitable for timber production instead, the
report noted.
   In the past decade, the service doubled the volume of timber sold
from the six forests, from 63 million board feet in 1977 to 126
million in 1986. Plans call for doubling it again in 10 years and
increasing it more than 350 percent by 2030.
   The forests provide essentially the only wilderness areas in the
region. The service plans to build roads and cut old trees in remote
areas which do not yet have official wilderness designation from
Congress and are essentially the only old-growth forests in the area.
   It plans to build 3,263 miles of roads, which are built for
logging, in addition to the current 4,951 miles. Balancing the cost
against the sale price, the agency reported a $5.5 million loss on
timber sales from the six forests in fiscal 1987, the report said.
   The service itself has admitted private forests could produce the
timber it sells, the report said.
   The study said the service views wildlife management ``primarily
as an adjunct of timber production'' in each individual forest when
a regional approach is needed.
   The society recommended an outside task force to evaluate the
service's plans, establishing more wilderness areas, phasing out
timber sales, stopping road construction, reforming forestry
practices and restructuring the agency's budget to provide more
balance among the uses of the forests.
   The Forest Service has previously defended its handling of
national forests by pointing out that they have multiple uses:
logging, recreation and wildlife management.
   ``We get confused with national parks that are managed strictly
for non-timber purposes,'' Cherokee National Forest planning officer
Bob Larkey said after conservationists appealed the plan for that
forest in 1986. ``It's very difficult to give everybody what they
want.''

   A crowded bus traveling in southern China
flipped over into a deep ditch, killing 13 people and injuring 33,
according to an official Chinese report that appeared today.
   The accident occurred early Tuesday in Zengcheng county about 40
miles northeast of Canton, the capital of coastal Guangdong
province, the China News Service said in a report appearing in Hong
Kong newspapers.
   The pro-Beijing Wen Wei Po newspaper said the bus, which was
traveling from Jieyang county in northeastern Guangdong to Canton,
was carrying 50 people, or five more than its capacity.
   An initial investigation indicated the brakes failed, the
newspaper said.

<HEAD>`Lonesome Dove' Rounds Up CBS' Highest Weekly Rating in Two Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was ``The Case of the Much-Watched
Miniseries,'' and Perry Mason came to the defense of NBC.
   Because of the unexpected success of CBS' Western miniseries
``Lonesome Dove,'' NBC fully expected to come in second after
winning 33 consecutive weeks in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings.
   NBC led by less than a rating point going into Sunday, CBS' best
night for ratings. But ``Perry Mason: The Case of the Lethal
Lesson'' defended the network against CBS' weaker made-for-TV movie,
``Outside Woman,'' and NBC eked out a tie with CBS for first place
for the week.
   The final episode of ``Lonesome Dove'' was last week's
highest-rated, prime-time show. The four-part series corralled CBS'
highest rating in two years.
   Monday's and Tuesday's installments of the eight-hour miniseries
landed in the top 10. But `Mason' and `Cosby,' et al, helped NBC
extend its unbeaten streak to 34 weeks.
   ``The Cosby Show'' was on twice last week and came in second and
third. There was a special Monday episode as part of NBC's
programming against ``Lonesome Dove.''
   ``Lonesome Dove, Part 4'' had a 27.3 rating and 41 share. The
miniseries wound up with a four-night average rating of 26.1 and a
39 share, good enough for 14th on the all-time-high miniseries list.
It is the highest-rated multi-part movie in 4{ years. The first
night of the miniseries, on a Sunday, was included in the previous
week's Nielsens.
   Each rating point represents 904,000 households with televisions.
The share is a percentage of sets in use.
   NBC also expected trouble because President Bush's address to
Congress pre-empted more than an hour of its high-rated Thursday
lineup.
   NBC and CBS had a 16.7 rating for the week; ABC 12.8. It as CBS'
highest since March 1987. Thanks ``Lonesome Dove,'' the three
networks had their highest combined share of the season, 72,
compared with the season-to-date average of 68.
   Last week's top 10 shows were: ``Lonesome Dove, Part 4,'' CBS;
``The Cosby Show,'' NBC; ``The Cosby Show Special,'' NBC; ``Lonesome
Dove, Part 3,'' CBS; ``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS; ``A
Different World,'' NBC; ``Golden Girls,'' NBC; ``Lonesome Dove, Part
2,'' CBS; and ``ALF,'' NBC.
   ABC's new ``Columbo'' premiered Monday against ``Lonesome Dove''
and NBC's special comedy lineup, but came in a respectable 26th with
a 16.3 rating.
   NBC couldn't count the whole rating for ``L.A. Law'' on Thursday,
because 25 minutes of it was after prime time, and it ended up 25th,
the first time in recent memory it's been out of the top 20.
   In the news category, CBS won the week with a 12.0 rating and a
20 share. ABC and NBC were in a virtual tie, with an 11.0 and a
10.9, respectively, and a 19 share each.

<HEAD>Dollar Plunges, Stocks Hit Another Record High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen for the
second consecutive day today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's
leading index climbed to another record high in active trading.
   The dollar closed at 125.90 yen, down 1.30 yen from Tuesday's
close of 127.20 yen and down 2.40 yen from Monday's finish. It
opened at 126.30 yen, the day's high, and plunged at one point to
125.80 yen.
   The U.S. currency thus has fallen 4.50 yen since hitting this
year's highest close of 130.40 yen on Feb. 1.
   Dealers said the dollar's decline today was due to growing
pessimism in the market over U.S. trade figures to be announced
later this week.
   They added that the weaker dollar led to expectations of a
sell-off by investment trusts before they closed their books for the
year at the end of March.
   Exchange dealers said volume totaled $10.582 billion, second
largest this year. The previous high of $10.70 billion was set
Friday, when the dollar fell 1.74 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Average, a
2.43-point loser Tuesday, gained 166.59 points, or 0.52 percent,
closing at a record 32,149.48 points.
   Stock traders said volume was estimated at 1.6 billion shares in
the first section, compared with 1.56 billion Tuesday.
   Individual and foreign investors showed strong buying interest,
with their concern over political uncertainty linked to the
so-called Recruit scandal apparently subsiding, the traders said.
   Prosecutors have arrested several people, including Hiromasa
Ezoe, founder of the information services conglomerate Recruit Co.,
on suspicion of giving bribes by offering bargain-priced stock to
influential politicians and businessmen. The scandal has rocked the
government of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.

   The commander of the Red Army contingent in
Afghanistan walked alone across a frontier bridge into the Soviet
Union on Wednesday, completing the Kremlin's withdrawal from a
costly nine-year war, Tass reported.
   The Soviet military adventure in its southern neighbor had
claimed the lives of more than 15,000 Soviet soldiers and left
35,000 wounded.
   Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov was the last soldier to cross the bridge
into to Soviet city of Termez from the Afghan town of Khairaton, the
official news agency said.
   He walked across the bridge over the Amu-Darya River at 9:55 a.m.
Moscow time, Tass said.
   A Moscow Radio reporter in Termez said:
   ``There they are, standing in front of us, the lads who were the
last to leave ... Two battalions, a reconnaissance one and airborne
assault one, left today. Everyone is wearing medals and smiling with
satisfaction.''
   ``The dust-covered armored personnel carriers are still. The guns
of many of them are already under cover,'' said the reporter, whose
broadcast was monitored in London.
   ``That is it _ this war has come to an end.''
   With the forces Gromov commanded gone, major cities held by the
Soviet-backed government of President Najib were expected to fall to
the insurgents in a matter of weeks.
   Soviet media reported looting by troops of the 30,000-member
Afghan army _ and mass desertions as the guerrillas gain ground.
   ``Some garrisons have been plundered. Certain posts and
strongholds transferred to the Afghans have been emptied,'' an
article in Trud said Tuesday.
   ``The political situation in the republic is becoming tense.
Attacks by military formations on peaceful cities are increasing
daily, not to mention the artillery and rocket shellings of Kabul,
Kandahar, Jalalabad and other big centers. The extremists from
Peshawar don't want a peaceful national settlement,'' it said,
referring to the city in western Pakistan where many of the
U.S.-supplied guerrillas are based.
   The last Soviet troops left Kabul aboard military transport
planes late Tuesday, leaving defense of besieged capital to the
conscript Afghan army and Najib's security forces.
   A U.N. airlift of food to Kabul, which has been plagued by food
and fuel shortages because of the guerrilla blockade _ has been
suspended for fear the planes would be shot down.
   Soviet soldiers intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979 _ a
year after a Marxist coup touched off civil war _ and an estimated
115,000 were in the country when the withdrawal began May 15 under a
U.N.-mediated agreement.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfilev told a news
briefing in Moscow Tuesday that guerrillas were massing outside
major cities _ including about 30,000 around Kabul _ but he did not
say whether they were preparing to attack. He said the withdrawal
was proceeding on schedule.
   ``As of Feb. 15, not a single Soviet soldiers will be on Afghan
territory,'' Perfilev said.

<HEAD>Vandals Steal Aluminum Anywhere They Find It</HEAD>

   Richard Arregui parked his car at a Miami art gallery one day
late last year and noticed something amiss. An 8-foot aluminum
outdoor sculpture was now only 4 feet high.
   ``Someone had literally torn half of it off,'' said Arregui,
assistant director at the Barbara Gillman Gallery. He found the
missing half of the $25,000 sculpture hours later _ at a scrap yard.
They had paid $192.50 for it.
   In recent months, thieves have stolen aluminum from practically
everywhere to cash in on a prolonged boom in aluminum prices at
scrap yards.
   Vandals have stripped siding and gutters from New York City
homes, faucets and window frames from a New Orleans housing
development, swing sets from a Miami playground, bridge railing from
Connecticut highways, and cans from Chicago recycling bins.
   Nothing is sacred. Not even the historic Brooklyn Bridge.
   A few months ago, three men pried loose supports from the
105-year-old suspension bridge's pedestrian walkway and from a
catwalk used by ironworkers, authorities said. Two were caught.
Damage was estimated at $37,000 and the walkway and catwalk were
closed temporarily for repairs.
   ``I think all this is a little nuts,'' said Officer Bob Hardy,
who in his Queens precinct in New York City has investigated cases
of stolen aluminum siding, gutters and 100 posts from a foot bridge
in the last month. ``People are desperate for money, that's what it
is.''
   Hardy and other police officers said the aluminum is stolen by
crack addicts or scavengers. Authorities said the problem is limited
to areas with markets to recycle aluminum. A pound of the material
can bring up to 60 cents, triple the price three years ago.
   ``Unfortunately in our society, many people will do illegal
things to make money,'' said Frank Rathbun, spokesman for the
Aluminum Association in Washington, D.C. ``When the price of
aluminum is high enough, people will steal aluminum. It's really not
a surprise.''
   Aluminum is swiped more often than other metals because of its
high price and availability.
   It is used in hundreds of products, from beverage cans to
airplanes. More than 25 percent of the 16 billion pounds of aluminum
made each year in the United States comes from recycled aluminum,
which is much cheaper than producing aluminum from ore.
   ``We encourage recycling,'' Rathbun said, adding quickly, ``but
legally, of course. We don't believe in taking bridges apart.''
   In New Orleans, a crew worked four days on an apartment at a
housing project only to return each morning to see its repairs
undone by thieves who removed all the aluminum in sight _ window
frames, mail boxes, mail slots and faucet handles. In eastern
Connecticut, railings from six highway overpasses were stolen last
year.
   Scavengers are even hitting on Chicago recycling centers, taking
newspapers and aluminum left in special collection boxes, said
Michele White, program developer for the Resource Center.
   ``If recycling is going to be viable in the city of Chicago or
anywhere, scavengers are going to have to be stopped,'' she said.
   Chicago police are now helping the recyclers by enforcing an old
ordinance that makes it illegal to sort through junk on streets and
alleys. The first scavenger arrested was scheduled to face a
misdemeanor charge in court Friday.
   Mo Ross, manager of AMF Enterprises Corp. in New York and a
40-year veteran of the recycling business, said the recent spate of
thefts doesn't surprise him.
   ``In the scrap business, anything is possible,'' said Ross, who
doesn't buy scrap off the street. ``You'll see stealing all over the
(New York) metropolitan area. ... Anything laying around loose, they
take it.''
   And a few things bolted down.
   After the top half of the Miami sculpture was taken, the art
gallery asked for police surveillance. But several days later,
Arregui arrived at work and the bottom half was gone.
   ``All that was left were the bolts from the platform,'' he said.
Police never found the aluminum and have made no arrests.
   The artist, Linda Howard, said she was shocked initially. ``I
have aluminum sculptures all over the country and nothing has ever
even been defaced,'' she said.
   Insurance covered the theft, and Howard said she will continue
using aluminum ``because that's what I do.''
   The sculpture's top half is in storage. ``Maybe we could use it
as table sculpture,'' Arregui said.

   Residents voted overwhelmingly to change the
city's 81-year-old form of government to give blacks a political
voice, prompting the NAACP to say its discrimination lawsuit had
been settled ``out of court.''
   Voters approved the change to the city's 1908 charter Tuesday by
33,373 votes, or 70 percent, to 14,213 votes, or 30 percent,
according to complete unofficial election results.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
sued Tulsa in 1987, contending that at-large balloting for city
commissioners unconstitutionally diluted the minority black vote
concentrated in north Tulsa, where 75 percent of the city's 42,000
blacks live.
   The new charter creates a council with nine members to be elected
by district, including one in north Tulsa. The mayor, who gains
power under the new charter, continues to be elected at large.
   ``The result of the election was the basis of our lawsuit,'' said
Hubert Bryant, an NAACP attorney. ``We claim victory. This is
something that the citizens of Tulsa brought in, but it was only
possible by the filing of our lawsuit. We are delighted that we were
able to settle this out of court.''
   Attorneys are scheduled to meet here March 9 with U.S. Magistrate
John Leo Wagner to determine the lawsuit's status under the new
charter. But Bryant said NAACP attorneys believe the charter
addresses the lawsuit's concerns.
   ``We are satisfied, but the court now must be satisfied,'' he
said.
   Election board officials had predicted a turnout of about 50,000
of the city's 225,000 registered voters Tuesday. But poll workers
said they were busier than expected despite rain.
   The NAACP lawsuit claimed Tulsa had a history of racial
discrimination that dated back to a 1921 race riot and continued
through the city's government. A north Tulsa black has never been
elected to the city commission.
   Tulsa voters have rejected four attempts in 35 years to change
the city's government. A 1969 proposal failed by 63 votes out of
more than 23,000 cast. The most recent, a 1973 proposal, was
defeated by a wide margin.
   Similar lawsuits in other cities have prompted federal judges to
order a change to a more representative government. The NAACP filed
its lawsuit against Tulsa after winning a similar case in
Springfield, Ill.
   Tulsa's traditional government has allowed commissioners to serve
in executive and legislative functions. Under the new charter, the
mayor becomes the chief executive responsible for day-to-day
operations, while the nine-member council elected by district
handles legislative matters and approves mayoral actions.
   `What Tulsans have proved is that this is a city with the
confidence to make this kind of major change,'' said Mayor Rodger
Randle, who along with the city's four other elected commissioners
campaigned in support of the new charter.
   ``This is something I've thought we should have had for many
years,'' said Police Commissioner Bob Dick, the lone Republican on
the commission who as a young Tulsa police officer enforced the
city's segregation laws.
   ``So early on, I was very sensitive to saying there's something
very, very wrong here,'' Dick said.
   Supporters of the measure had said better representation for
black voters would be one of the benefits of changing the charter.
Opponents had said the charter change would give the mayor too much
power.

   Can a nice guy finish first in the rowdy race for
mayor of New York?
   Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins, who announced his
candidacy Tuesday for the Democratic nomination, intends to find
out, in addition to whether he'll be the first black man to hold the
highest office in the nation's largest city.
   The 61-year-old Dinkins has a conciliatory manner that comes up
in political discussions as frequently as his skin color, which
political analysts say could virtually guarantee him 30 percent of
the vote.
   Supporters _ and even opponents like Mayor Edward I. Koch _ use
the same words to describe Dinkins, who now leads all comers,
including the incumbent, in the polls. He's nice. Thoughtful.
Cautious. Courteous. The polite politician.
   In other words, he's no Ed Koch, a combatative candidate known to
shoot from the lip at the slightest provocation.
   Instead, Dinkins is known for forming committees, including one
to determine what was needed to make a run for mayor.
   ``Some people try to be critical of the fact that he gives
reasoned, well thought-out opinions, which should be valued in
public officials,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
   ``I've been hearing a lot of pundits say he's too nice,'' the
congressman added. ``Anybody could be considered a nice guy compared
to Ed Koch. It's all relative.''
   ``I am running because our city has become sharply polarized,''
Dinkins said in announcing his candidacy. ``We need a mayor who can
transcend differences so we can work together to solve our
problems.''
   The name of the borough president, the highest ranking black city
official, was tossed around for months before he entered the race.
   Koch, who will run for an unprecedented fourth term, annoyed many
blacks last year by making disparaging remarks about Jesse Jackson
during the presidential primary.
   Dinkins, who supported Jackson, said he expected Jackson to
campaign for him this year.
   For his part, Koch said he consider Dinkins ``to be a very
formidable candidate. I perceive myself as the underdog. That's not
just rhetoric. I think the polls show that. I hope to turn them
around.
   ``I know that both he and I will conduct the election battle in a
responsible way,'' the mayor added.
   Though it seems everyone already has an opinion of Koch, 36
percent of the voters said they didn't know enough about Dinkins to
have an opinion, according to a Daily News poll.
   Several polls have shown that Dinkins would defeat Koch and other
potential Democratic candidates, such as City Council President
Andrew Stein, special state prosecutor Charles J. Hynes, City
Councilwoman Ruth W. Messinger and former U.S. Rep. Herman Badillo.
   ``He's warm, tender, generous, quietly assertive,'' is the
opinion of Percy Sutton, a longtime friend and former Manhattan
borough president himself. ``He doesn't bring down buildings when he
talks, but he's quiet and firm.''
   His political career has been quiet, by New York standards. A
former Marine and graduate of Brooklyn Law School, Dinkins became
``hopelessly hooked'' on politics after winning a race for state
Assembly in 1965.
   He lost two elections for borough president before winning in
1985.
   There had been an earlier setback: Dinkins admitted not filing
income tax returns from 1968-71, which wrecked his chance to become
a deputy mayor to Abe Beame. Dinkins paid $15,000 in back taxes and
admitted his negligence.
   As borough president, he and his staff have addressed numerous
issues of importance to Manhattan residents, often by forming a task
force: housing and homelessness; child welfare; infant mortality;
drugs; even pedestrian safety.
   Though he may have lost ground among some Jewish voters by
backing Jackson for president, Dinkins has earned the respect of
many others with his lobbying on behalf of Soviet Jews and
denunciation of radical Louis Farrakhan.
   And, he warned, don't be misled by his courtly manner.
   ``Let me tell you. ... I'm also an ex-Marine,'' Dinkins said.
``And I don't intend for a second to get shoved around in this or
any other campaign. So let's be clear on that.''
   Political consultant Bill Cunningham, the former executive
director of the state Democratic committee, said voters would
decide: ``Do they want the tough-talking guy for another four years,
or do they want to make a change?''

   Children playing with matches may have ignited a
fire in a house from which firefighters rescued five people,
including four who were revived after being pulled out unconscious,
authorities said.
   The four _ a man, a young boy and two infants _ were
hospitalized. Three of them were listed in critical condition.
   Tuesday morning's blaze began on the first floor of the
three-story Brooklyn row house where several children had been
playing with matches, said John Mulligan, a fire department
spokesman.
   The fire quickly spread to the upper floors, where 43-year-old
Melvin Bell Sr. was found unconscious, his body shielding
2-month-old Tawana Bell.
   Firefighters also found the infant, 4-year-old Lamar Bell and
4-month-old Tenora Coleman unconscious, Mulligan said.
   All four were brought outside, revived and hospitalized for
severe smoke inhalation. Melvin Bell and Tawana were in critical but
stable condition at Kings County Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman
Leah Johnson. Tenora Coleman was in stable condition, she said.
   Lamar Bell was in critical condition at St. Mary's Hospital
before his transfer to the hyperbaric chamber on City Island, said
hospital spokesman Tom Hall.
   The victims' relationships were not immediately available.
   Bell's 20-year-old son, Melvin Jr., was able to flee to roof,
where firefighters rescued him uninjured, Mulligan said.
   Mulligan said five firefighters who rescued the residents would
receive commendations for heroism.
   A cat and a dog also were rescued and revived with oxygen.

<TEXT>
   Movie heartthrob Kathleen Turner accepted
the Hasty Pudding Theatricals' 1989 Woman of the Year wearing a
rhinestone tiara and garlanded in a string of sizzling, sexy
adjectives.
   Ms. Turner joined in a chorus of ``Wild Thing'' and engaged in
off-color banter with the Harvard University students who since 1951
have given the award annually to the performer ``who makes a lasting
and impressive contribution to the world of entertainment.''
   The students suggested the title of Tuesday's ceremony should
have been, ``Peggy Sue gets verbally lambasted by a bunch of
snot-nosed Harvard guys.''
   They compiled a list of adjectives to describe Ms. Turner: ``Hot,
steamy, smouldering, sizzling, torrid, blazing, sweltering,
simmering, seething, balmy...''
   ``Oh, that was Sesame Street,'' the actress interrupted.
   Ms. Turner made her 1981 film debut in ``Body Heat,'' starred in
``Peggy Sue Got Married'' and was recently featured in ``The
Accidental Tourist.'' She also was the voice of Jessica Rabbit in
the cartoon, ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' in which her most
memorable line was: ``I'm not bad; I'm just drawn that way.''
   Ms. Turner said her roles in ``Accidental Tourist'' and ``Roger
Rabbit'' may compete for this year's Academy Awards.
   ``I'm told I may be up against myself for supporting actress as
both Sarah and Jessica Rabbit,'' she said before accepting the small
brass Hasty Pudding pot.
   Asked by reporters about her throaty voice and faintly foreign
accent, Ms. Turner replied, ``It's because I grew up in South
America and England and because I'm a little affected.''
   Ms. Turner said she plans to start rehearsals in December for a
New York stage production of Tennessee Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof, in which she will plays the part of Maggie.
   Before the ceremony, Ms. Turner was paraded through Harvard
Square on the back of a 1947 Lincoln Contintental convertible.
Wearing a red dress and rhinestone tiara, she was flanked by male
Harvard students in drag, a tradition that dates back to the days
when the university's constitution forbade men to wear women's
clothes.
   Previous recipients of the award include Lucille Ball, Katherine
Hepburn, Meryl Streep and Elizabeth Taylor.
   Actor Robin Williams is scheduled to accept Hasty Pudding's 1989
Man of the Year Award on Feb. 21 at the opening of the annual
student production, ``Whiskey Business.''

<HEAD>Bill Would Have Massachusetts Compensate Blacks for Slavery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black state senator has proposed a bill modeled
after federal reparations to wartime Japanese internees that would
have Massachusetts compensate blacks for the injuries of slavery and
racism.
   Lawmakers in the state, one of the first to outlaw slavery and a
hotbed of abolitionism, are not expected to approve the measure. But
a Harvard law professor and other observers said it should spark a
worthwhile debate.
   The bill's sponsor, Democratic Sen. Bill Owens of Boston, said
the government and the country's white majority have an obligation
to acknowledge the wrong of slavery and the continued impact of
racial discrimination.
   Whites, he said, ``tend to forget that we are the only people who
gave to this country our work, our labor and our lives'' as slaves,
``and got nothing for it.''
   The measure, which has yet to have a public hearing before a
committee, does not specify how much compensation should be paid and
calls instead for creation of a commission to ``negotiate with
legitimate representatives of African descendants.''
   Owens' proposal is modeled on a bill passed by Congress last year
which pays $1.25 billion in damages to Japanese-Americans forced
into internment camps during World War II. The law promises lump-sum
payments of $20,000 to more than 60,000 Japanese-Americans who were
imprisoned without trial.
   ``The Japanese claim that they had been deprived of educational
opportunity, they had been deprived of housing and they had been
deprived of employment, which diminished their social and economic
conditions,'' Owens said. ``We suffered exactly the same thing,''
Owens said.
   ``The vestiges of slavery, as we view it, continue even today,''
the senator said.
   As drafted, the one-paragraph bill is likely to raise practical
problems because it does not define ``people of African descent'' or
state whether claims could be pressed only by descendants of former
slaves.
   Slavery was outlawed in Massachusetts in 1783 by the state
Supreme Court, which ruled that the practice violated the state
Constitution.
   Asked about the proposal, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said he had not
seen the bill, but balked at the potential cost. ``At this point,
we're trying to make ends meet around here,'' said Dukakis, who is
facing a $600 million deficit.
   The Senate's Republican floor leader, Sen. David Locke, also
expressed surprise at the legislation and questioned its merits.
   ``My concern is it drives a wedge betwen the black community and
the white community, and I think that should not be done,'' Locke
said.
   Outside government, the proposal drew a mixed assessment.
   ``There's no question that from a moral standpoint, it's just,''
said Boston University historian Howard Zinn. ``I don't think it's
going to happen, of course.''
   But Zinn said the idea was worth raising, and pointed out that
much of Massachusetts' early wealth came in part from the forced
labor of blacks.
   ``The value of Senator Owens' bill is that it's going to spark a
debate,'' said Harvard Law School professor Derek Bell, adding that
he doubted payments would ever be made. ``But in terms of the
legality, it's just as valid as the Japanese-American reparations.''

<HEAD>Study Says Milk Passes Meat as Top Source of Saturated Fat for Kids</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Youngsters who love milk should stick to
the fat-free variety, because dairy products have surpassed meat as
the top source of unhealthy saturated fat in teen-agers' diets, a
researcher says.
   Studies by Dr. Curtis Ellison at two elite New England prep
schools found that 35 percent of students' daily intake of saturated
fat comes from milk, cheese, ice cream and other dairy food.
   Preppies are not unique in what they eat, according to Ellison,
who said at least two other unpublished studies have reached similar
conclusions.
   ``The studies show that the main source of saturated fat is not
meat anymore,'' he said. ``It is milk and other dairy products.''
   Eating too much saturated fat raises cholesterol levels in the
bloodstream. This clogs the arteries that feed the heart. Decades of
bad eating eventually can result in a heart attack, but many experts
believe that the damage begins early in life.
   Ellison measured the sources of salt and saturated fat in the
diets of students at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire and
Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., as part of a study of dietary
changes.
   He found that after dairy products, meat, fish, poultry and eggs
provided 28 percent of the students' saturated fat; baked goods and
cereals 16 percent; ketchup, gravy and other ``food adjuncts'' 7
percent; fruits and vegetables 7 percent, snacks 6 percent, and
everything else 1 percent.
   Ellison said that many people shy away from red meat because of
its fat content, but they sometimes substitute kinds of cheese, such
as chedder cheese, that contain far higher levels of saturated fat.
   ``Kids love milk,'' he said. ``Some of them drink two liters a
day, and they grow up thinking that it's a good thing to have. We
are not trying to take their milk away. Just take the fat out of
it.''
   Ellison presented his data Tuesday at a program on school lunches
held at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Clinical Research
Center.
   Ellison is among health experts who believe youngsters should cut
down on saturated fat and salt to establish good eating habits and
prevent coronary artery disease and high blood pressure as they get
older.
   Salt aggravates high blood pressure, and his prep school survey
found that breakfast cereal and baked goods provide about 30 percent
of the salt in teen-agers' diets. Meats add 21 percent, dairy
products 16 percent, food adjuncts 12 percent, fruits and vegetables
9 percent, snack foods 6 percent, table salt less than 1 percent and
all else 5 percent.
   In dietary experiments at the academies, Ellison found that by
substituting low-salt recipes in the cafeterias, cooks could make
food that the students would eat but still reduce their salt
consumption by 15 percent to 20 percent. This also reduced the
youngsters' average blood pressure by about 2 points.
   In another experiment, cooks substituted polyunsaturated fat for
saturated fat in recipes. This reduced saturated fat consumption
from 13 percent of total calories to 10.6 percent. However, because
of problems measuring the youngster's blood cholesterol levels, it
was unclear what effect this had on their cardiovascular health.
   Ellison said the average cholesterol levels of U.S. youngsters is
between 160 and 170. The ideal is 110, although this is probably not
obtainable if they follow a typical American diet.
   ``Our target is to get all children in the United States down
around 140 over the next 10 years,'' he said. Even with cholesterol
levels this low, some of them will still have cholesterol over 200
after they reach adulthood.

<HEAD>New Military Space Rocket Launches Navigation Satellite</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An advanced navigation satellite
circled Earth today, boosted into orbit on the inaugural liftoff of
the Delta 2, the first of the post-Challenger space rockets
developed to launch vital military payloads.
   ``It was in every way a picture perfect launch,'' Air Force Lt.
Col. Bob Tayloe, the launch director, said after Tuesday's
successful liftoff. ``The satellite came up very strong and we're
receiving a good signal.''
   The Delta 2 is the first of at least 54 new unmanned rockets the
Pentagon is ordering in a $14 billion program to launch much-needed
reconnaissance, navigation, communications and other national
security satellites.
   About 40 of these payloads have been grounded for lack of a
launch vehicle since the shuttle Challenger exploded three years
ago, killing seven astronauts.
   As a result of the accident, the Air Force decided it was a
mistake to abandon unmanned rockets and to use the shuttle for sole
access to space. It ordered three new rocket systems, the
medium-size Delta 2 and Atlas 2 and the large, more powerful Titan 4.
   The Delta 2 was the first to fly. On its debut, it carried into
orbit the $65 million Navstar Global Positioning satellite, the
first payload removed from the shuttle manifest to a throwaway
rocket.
   The satellite entered an initial elliptical orbit ranging from
about 100 to 11,000 miles above Earth. On Thursday, an on-board
motor will be fired to shift the satellite into a circular orbit of
about 11,000 miles high.
   The 3,675-pound satellite is an advanced version of of seven
earlier model Navstars currently in orbit. It will enable U.S. and
allied military units such as ships, planes, submarines and tanks to
locate their positions within 50 feet by using an encrpyted channel.
The accuracy for civilian users will be within 300 feet.
   The satellite is the first of 21 of the upgraded Navstars the Air
Force plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992, giving
anyone anywhere in the world 24-hour access to the positioning
information.
   The original plan was to launch all 21 on NASA's space shuttle
fleet. But that idea was scrapped after the Challenger explosion.
Now, only two remain scheduled on the shuttle.
   The Air Force has ordered 20 Delta 2s from McDonnell Douglas, 23
Titan 4s from Martin Marietta and 11 Atlas 2s from General Dynamics.
It is negotiating for 26 more Titan 4s.
   The Titan 4 is scheduled to make its first flight next month. The
Atlas 2 debut is set for next year.

<HEAD>American Doctors Go To Vietnam To Perform Plastic Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first organized group of American
doctors to go to Vietnam since the war ended in 1975 left for that
country today to perform surgery on children with congenital mouth
deformities.
   The first 12 members of the 34-person surgical team, which
includes plastic surgeons, anesthesiologists and pediatricians,
departed for Vietnam's capital of Hanoi. The rest are to join them
Saturday.
   The group, ``Operation Smile,'' is one of various charitable
groups responding to the U.S. government's recommendation that
Vietnam be given private aid in humanitarian fields.
   At the Olof Palme Institute for the Protection of Children in
Hanoi, the Americans will spend the first three days examining young
children whom Vietnamese doctors screened for the free operations.
   They will stay in Hanoi until Feb. 25, performing reconstructive
surgery to correct cleft lips and palates and burned scar
contractures, said chief surgeon Dr. Craig Merrell, spokesman for
the Norfolk, Va.-based non-profit group.
   ``When you fix the face of a child, nobody can take that away
from him ... he's changed forever,'' said one group member, Dr.
Frank Yeiser.
   ``If we can begin by helping each other through the face of a
child, then let us try,'' Yeiser quoted a Vietnamese plastic surgeon
as saying on a recent exchange program to the United States.
   The United States and Vietnam do not have diplomatic relations,
but Washington has encouraged more humanitarian aid since Vietnam
pledged in August 1987 to speed up an accounting of Americans
missing from the war.
   The Americans are taking to Vietnam hundreds of thousands of
dollars worth of surgical equipment and medical supplies, mostly
donated by large American pharmaceutical companies. Some items will
be donated to the hospital there.
   In Hanoi, seven plastic surgeons will operate on six patients at
a time for five days, adding up to some 400 man-hours, Merrell told
a news conference.
   Group members who left for Hanoi today included Dr. Craig Merrell
of Chesapeake, Va.; Yeiser of Norfolk; pediatrics dentist Dr. John
Moffitt of Spokane, Wash.; pediatrician Dr. Mike Solhaug and
clinical nurse specialist Valre Buchholz, both from Virginia Beach,
Va.; and Vietnam war veteran Steve Hayes, from Washington, D.C. who
was to handle logistics.
   They are to be joined Saturday by William Magee, the founder of
Operation Smile and Mary Stout, president of the Vietnam Veterans of
America.
   Solhaug, a former combat soldier in Vietnam, said he had ``mixed
emotions'' about returning to the country.
   But going back as a pediatrician presents a ``marvelous
opportunity to revisit my old memories .. a sort of dangerous
prospect on one hand and yet a healing process,'' he said.

   Secretary of State Glen Browder led a
Democratic primary election but will face a runoff with Tuskegee
Mayor Johnny Ford, who is seeking to become Alabama's first black
congressman since Reconstruction.
   The winner of their March 7 runoff will face Republican state
Sen. John Rice in a special election in the 3rd Congressional
District, which stretches through the mostly rural counties to the
east and north of Montgomery.
   The April 4 election is being held to select a successor to
Democratic Rep. Bill Nichols, who died in December at age 70 after
serving 21 years.
   Browder, 46, a former Jacksonville State University professor who
vaulted from the Legislature to his statehouse post in 1986, edged
Ford by a 25-to-24 percent margin in Tuesday's primary despite
trailing in district-wide surveys in recent weeks.
   ``It was a very competitive campaign,'' Browder said. ``Nobody
walked away with this race. I respect Mayor Ford very much, and I
think that we'll have a pretty sprited campaign.''
   Ford, 46, ran strongly in predominantly black Macon County and
drew well enough elsewhere to beat out state Sen. Jim Preuitt of
Talladega and state Rep. Charles Adams of Phenix City.
   ``We obviously received overwhelming support from the
African-American community, which is good,'' Ford said Tuesday
night. ``Now that we're in the runoff ... much of the quiet white
support we got will come out openly.''
   Rice, 37, seeking to claim a traditionally Democratic district,
said the general election race will pit a conservative against a
liberal.
   The Opelika real estate developer won his GOP race without a
runoff, pulling about 62 percent of the vote.
   Blacks make up about 25 percent of the district. The last time a
black won a primary runoff spot for Congress in Alabama was in 1978,
when Chris McNair of Birmingham ran against the eventual winner,
Richard Shelby of Tuscaloosa, in the 7th District.

   Shantytown dwellers who lost loved ones when
deadly gas from a Union Carbide plant enveloped the neighborhood in
1984 say the $470 million settlement the company has agreed to is
not punishment enough.
   ``We have often been promised money, but for us it was more
important that those who killed our brothers and sisters should be
hanged,'' said Sunil Kumar.
   The 15-year-old Kumar lost his parents and five siblings to the
cloud of methyl isocyanante that escaped from a storage tank in the
world's deadliest industrial disaster.
   At least 3,329 people died from exposure to the gas released from
a pesticide plant owned by the Danbury, Conn.-based company's Indian
subsidiary.
   The government says at least 20,000 survivors still suffer
shortness of breath, eye problems and other ailments.
   On Tuesday, the Supreme Court of India ended four years of legal
wrangling and ordered Union Carbide to pay the $470 million in
compensation.
   The settlement was acceptable to both the company and India,
which had sought $3 billion.
   Today, the court agreed to advance the date of payment from March
31 to March 23 and to allow the company's Indian subsidiary to pay
$45 million of the settlement with the parent company responsible
for the remaining $425 million.
   The news was slow to sink in at the Jai Prakash Nagar shantytown
across the road from the deserted Union Carbide plant, which closed
after the Dec. 3, 1984, gas leak.
   Kumar still lives with a younger brother in the shack where his
family slept as the white killing vapor wafted across the teeming
squatter settlement.
   This morning, he was studying for high school examinations _ one
of the few teen-agers in the shantytown who can afford not to work.
   He achieved this relative affluence soon after the disaster when
the Indian government gave next-of-kin 10,000 rupees (then worth
$833) for each gas death in the family. Kumar received 70,000 rupees.
   Throughout the shantytown today, many people seemed unable to
comprehend what the settlement would mean for them.
   One man, Shanker Lal, said there had been promises of money in
the past but he had yet to receive anything.
   At a hospital near the camp, Shaukat Bai, a veiled woman in her
mid-20s, waited for treatment for respiratory problems blamed on the
gas. Pregnant at the time of the disaster, she lost her unborn child
in a miscarriage health workers blamed on the gas. Her husband was
killed by the gas.
   ``Union Carbide should have been stripped of its assets,'' she
said. She said she thought pregnant women who suffered miscarriages
or gave birth to stillborn babies should be given compensation.
   Local politicians who crusaded on the victims' behalf were more
vehement.
   ``The Rajiv Gandhi government has committed an inhuman crime by
undermining the extent of the disaster,'' Giriraj Kishore, president
of the Slum Dwellers Federation said, referring to the prime
minister and his Congress Party.
   Satinath Sarangi, a scientist and member of the Bhopal Group for
Information and Action, said: ``This settlement is the final
testimony to the anti-people collusion between the government of
India and the Union Carbide Corp.''
   Alok Pratap Singh, a leader of the Poisonous Gas Episode Struggle
Front that often organized anti-Carbide demonstrations, called the
$470 million agreement ``a shameless settlement.''
   Vibhuti Jha, a young lawyer for the front, said the government
had committed a ``criminal offense'' by agreeing to drop criminal
charges against Union Carbide, its Indian subsidiary and corporate
officials.
   Warren Anderson, chairman at the time of the gas leak, and eight
officials of Union Carbide of India Ltd. were charged in 1987 with
culpable homicide in the disaster.
   They never appeared for trial, and the Supreme Court quashed the
charges when it ordered Union Carbide to pay the ``full and final
settlement.''
   Dainik Bhaskar, a Bhopal daily newspaper, called the settlement
``niggardly and inadequate'' and said it set a dangerous precedent
for the Third World where ``people are considered guinea pigs by the
multinationals.''

<TEXT>
   The Chicago Symphony may have made its reputation
playing Mahler, Wagner and Beethoven, but it will make contemporary
works an important part of its future, says newly appointed music
director Daniel Barenboim.
   The 46-year-old Barenboim, meeting with reporters for the first
time since being named Jan. 30 to replace Sir Georg Solti in
September 1991, said he doesn't plan any sweeping changes.
   But, he added, ``I don't want to pay lip service to contemporary
music ... and I don't expect everybody to agree with my choices and
like them. ...
   ``If we are limited to the music of the past, all our
institutions ... (will become) like well-equipped museums.''
   Barenboim said he has planned world or American premieres for
each of the five subscription weeks that he will work as a guest
conductor next season.
   In March for instance, the CSO under Barenboim's guidance will
play four works by composer Maurice Ravel, but also unveil a work by
Toro Takemitsu commissioned in honor of the orchestra's centennial.
   Barenboim cautioned Tuesday he won't undertake the new works
simply to tinker.
   After spending the last 13 years as musical director of
L'Orchestre de Paris, a post in which Solti also preceded him,
Barenboim has nothing but the utmost respect for the master. Solti,
who led the CSO since 1969, will become conductor laureate beginning
with the 1991-92 season.
   ``Because of its association with Sir Georg, I find an orchestra
at a level of excellence that is very rare and it would be
presumptuous of me to say I'm going to change that,'' said Barenboim.
   ``But it is also true that when you find something very good, you
cannot simply hope to gain hold of it and keep it like that. There
is a fluidity to life as well and it is important to keep that in
mind,'' Barenboim said.
   At the hour-long news conference, Barenboim was asked repeatedly
whether there had been a resolution of his much-publicized dispute
with officials of the Bastille Opera in Paris.
   Barenboim was fired last month as musical and artistic director
at the new Paris opera house, losing a salary of $1.1 million over
four years, as well as the chance to guide the ambitious project in
its infancy.
   He declined to discuss the matter in detail, but hinted that one
of the Mozart operas that was being considered for the opening of
the Paris opera house may well wind up elsewhere.
   Barenboim _ born in Argentina and raised in Israel _ was already
a world-famous pianist when he performed as a guest conductor in
1970 with the Chicago Symphony.
   ``My weaknesses are known to them, their strengths are known to
me,'' he said of the Chicago musicians. ``That should augur well for
the future.''

<TEXT>
   The Vice that made Miami famous was celebrated by
fans, city officials and the show's cast in a gala that may well
have served as a joyous wake for television detectives Sonny
Crockett and Rico Tubbs.
   The 100th show of ``Miami Vice'' was broadcast Feb. 10 amid
complaints by critics that, after five seasons, the NBC series has
lost its spirit of innovation and zest.
   But it remains popular enough in its home city that this week was
declared Miami Vice week. The crowning event was a party Tuesday
night.
   Several hundred people gathered at the Biltmore Hotel in Coral
Gables wearing everything from formal wear to jeans and high-topped
tennis shoes. They watched fireworks, met the cast and craned their
necks for Don Johnson, who played Crockett, and fiancee Melanie
Griffith, the star of the film ``Working Girl.''
   The publicist for both said earlier in the day that they are
expecting a child. However, the publicist, Elliott Mintz, said
rumors they would marry on Valentine's Day were untrue. He said no
date has been set.
   ``Miami Vice'' catapulted Johnson, co-star Philip Michael Thomas
and several other regulars to stardom.
   For years it stayed near the top of the ratings and
revolutionized men's fashion, television filming techniques, and
rock music scores for television.
   Olivia Brown, featured regularly on the show, said executive
producer Michael Mann encouraged creativity on the set and made it
fun.
   ``They allowed each of us to take chances,'' she said. ``It's
been the best experience of my life. I'm gonna cry a lot when it's
over.''
   Thomas, who played the cool and savvy Tubbs, said he doesn't plan
to leave Miami and hopes a theater he's starting here will help
other young actors get an opening.
   Emmy-winning actor Edward James Olmos, Lieutenant Castillo on the
show, told the crew goodbye, saying he was off to Poland to work on
a movie about the Nazi death camp Auschwitz.
   ``Tomorrow is my final day on Miami Vice,'' he said. ``I will put
to rest Lieutenant Castillo.''
   But Johnson and some others were not so willing to say last rites.
   ``I have learned very definitely in this business, never say
never,'' Johnson told his fans and coworkers. ``This isn't goodbye.
This is a celebration of 100 shows. We'll see what happens after
that.''

<HEAD>Study: Most Americans Dissatisfied With US Health Care System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vast majority of Americans favor a major overhaul
in the U.S. health care system, according to the first simultaneous
study of Canadian, British and U.S. attitudes about the issue.
   ``Americans apparently are so frustrated and discouraged with
their existing health care arrangements that a large majority say
they would favor a system like that in place in Canada,'' Robert J.
Blendon, chairman of the Department of Health Policy and Management
at Harvard University's School of Public Health, said Tuesday.
   Eighty-nine percent of Americans said there is room for a major
overhaul in the U.S. system, according to the Louis Harris survey
commissioned for Health Management Quarterly.
   Given a description of the Canadian and British systems, 61
percent of Americans said they would prefer to adopt the program
used by their neighbors to the north and 29 percent said they would
opt to try the British system, according to the poll.
   ``Americans are clearly disenchanted with the direction of their
nation's recent health policies, despite the fact that the United
States spends more for health care than Canada or Great Britain,''
said Blendon, principal analyst of the survey.
   About 7.5 percent of surveyed Americans also reported they were
not receiving necessary medical care for financial reasons, whereas
fewer than 1 percent of Canadians and Britons said financial
constraints kept them from obtaining care.
   Combined public and private funding provide the U.S. system's
foundation. Canadian health care is totally underwritten by the
government-funded national health insurance system. Under the
British National Health Service, doctors and hospitals work for and
are funded by the government.
   Only 3 percent of Canadians and 12 percent of the British said
they would prefer the U.S. system, the study said.
   The survey, which has a margin of error of 5 percentage points,
polled a nationwide cross-section of 1,250 adults in America, 1,026
Canadians and 1,667 Britons.

<HEAD>Galileo Probe Rebuilt For October Launch, 1995 Plunge Into Jovian
Skies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A space probe grounded for 3{ years by
the Challenger explosion has been rebuilt for an October launch to
Jupiter, where it will plunge to its doom as it seeks clues to the
birth of the solar system.
   The $1.36 billion Galileo mission should climax in December 1995,
when the probe deploys a parachute and collects information for 75
minutes before it is crushed by Jupiter's intense atmospheric
pressure.
   Its mother ship, the Galileo orbiter, will circle the planet for
22 months.
   Hughes Aircraft Co. planned to deliver the refurbished $157
million Galileo probe late this afternoon in Pasadena, where NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory is completing modifications to the orbiter.
   ``This is a very proud day for us. We are ready to deliver it to
JPL on its way to Jupiter,'' Hughes Vice President Steven Dorfman
said at a news conference Tuesday.
   JPL will send the 4-foot-diameter, teardrop-shaped probe to
Kennedy Space Center in Florida in late April, followed by the
orbiter in mid-May. The probe and orbiter then will be hooked up
together, placed atop a booster rocket, and finally loaded into the
cargo bay of the shuttle Atlantis.
   The shuttle, set for launch no earlier than Oct. 12 and no later
than about Nov. 21, will release the combined Galileo spacecraft
into Earth orbit. Then Galileo's rocket will fire, sending the
orbiter and probe on a circuitous, 2.4-billion-mile, six-year voyage
to the solar system's largest planet, which is the fifth planet from
the sun and is about 400 million miles from Earth.
   En route to the giant gaseous planet, Galileo will observe two
asteroids. The probe and orbiter will separate 150 days before they
reach Jupiter, then fly in tandem until the probe enters the
atmosphere at 115,000 mph. The probe will deploy a parachute and
descend about 370 miles through Jovian skies until it is crushed by
pressure more than 25 times Earth's atmosphere.
   Data from the probe will help scientists better understand the
origin of Jupiter, the solar system and the universe, said Richard
Young, Galileo probe project scientist at the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration's Ames Research Center in Mountain View.
   Scientists believe the Jovian atmosphere could be a sample of the
original material from which stars are formed, according to a Hughes
statement.
   The orbiter will measure Jupiter's electrical particle and
magnetic fields, and snap 50,000 photographs of the planet and its
moons, including Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, which were
discovered in 1610 by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei.
   The spacecraft had been scheduled for launch from a space shuttle
in May 1986 and powered out of orbit atop a Centaur booster for a
three-year trip to Jupiter. But Challenger exploded on Jan. 28,
1986, killing its crew of seven and grounding the shuttle fleet
until last fall.
   After the tragedy, NASA decided it was too dangerous to carry
liquid-fueled Centaur rockets aboard the shuttle. Galileo's route to
Jupiter was drastically redesigned and lengthened from three years
to six because Earth and Jupiter are no longer aligned as ideally as
they were in 1986 and because Galileo's new solid-fueled booster is
less powerful.
   The launch delay and longer flight time prompted a decision to
take the probe apart for refurbishing and to make sure some parts
wouldn't fail because of aging.
   White House approval for the launch is expected in September,
said Richard Spehalski, Galileo project manager at JPL. Such
approval is needed because the probe and orbiter each carry a power
plant and heater containing radioactive plutonium. A NASA
environmental impact statement concluded last month that the risk of
a nuclear accident when the shuttle lifts off with Galileo is very
small.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady In Late Morning European Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was trading today at lower levels in
thin late morning European dealings.
   Gold prices fell.
   The dollar was being undermined by a growing feeling that any
discount rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve would be matched by
the West German Bundesbank, said one trader with a major Italian
commercial bank in Milan.
   In addition, it was being pressured by statements by President
Bush indicating he wasn't unduly worried by inflation fears, he said.
   ``Bush's statement was received fairly neutrally in Europe on
Tuesday, but not in New York, they really sold the dollar off,'' the
trader said.
   The dollar has been strong recently, primarily due to
expectations of a tighter monetary policy by the Fed.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 1.30 yen to close at 125.90 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 126.10 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.8408 West German marks, down from 1.8615
   _1.5622 Swiss francs, down from 1.5815
   _6.2650 French francs, down from 6.3325
   _2.0782 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1015
   _1,342.25 Italian lire, down from 1,355.05
   _1.1830 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1835
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7730 from $1.7588 Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $382.75 a troy ounce,
down from $386.25 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $381.70.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $381.85, down from $385.50 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $4.02 to close at a bid $384.66.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.79 a troy ounce,
down from Tuesday's $5.83.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the astronaut corps at the Johnson
Space Center has denied a published report that he failed two eye
tests for colorblindness, although he did not specifically deny that
he is colorblind.
   Daniel C. Brandenstein, who is scheduled to command a shuttle
mission this year, made his comments Monday following a story in the
Houston Chronicle that said he and astronaut Frederick C. Hauck
received wavers for medical conditions that otherwise would have
grounded them.
   Hauck said the allegation that Brandenstein is colorblind is
``absurd.''
   ``Without going into detail, it's not accurate,'' Brandenstein
told the Houston Post in response to claims from an anonymous caller
to the newspaper that the astronaut had failed two colorblindness
tests.
   ``I have a long record of operational flying in the Navy with no
problem,'' he added.
   Although James C. Fletcher, NASA's chief administrator, refused
to comment on the medical records of Brandenstein and Hauck, he
issued a statement saying he is confident that NASA flight rules are
not being violated.
   ``I am confident that the system has not been abrogated and that
no one flies without qualifying by the book,'' Fletcher said.
   Like other NASA officials, Fletcher would not discuss any
individual medical records on the grounds that such records are
legally a private matter.
   Sources at the Johnson Space Center said Hauck underwent special
medical treatment last year to dissolve a kidney stone, and
Brandenstein received a waiver earlier keeping him on flight status
despite colorblindness, the Chronicle reported.

<HEAD>Police Shooting Victim's Family Files $10 Million Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The family of a motorcycle passenger who was killed
in the incident that touched off three days of race riots last month
has filed a $10 million lawsuit against the city.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court by the family of Allan
Blanchard, accuses Miami police of allowing a pattern of activity
that has violated suspects' civil rights during the past decade.
   Tuesday's lawsuit names as defendants the city, Mayor Xavier
Suarez, Police Chief Perry Anderson and his department, and Officer
William Lozano, a Hispanic who shot the driver of the motorcycle on
which Blanchard was riding.
   Also Tuesday, Anderson said he will not consider a request by
Hispanic officers for reassignment from black neighborhoods because
of tension following the shooting of the black motorcyclist.
   ``They have a responsibility as police officers to serve this
community, even throughout the rough times,'' Anderson said. ``I
would never even contemplate any type of reassignment.''
   An attorney for the Hispanic Officers Association had written a
letter to Anderson complaining that tension for Hispanic officers in
black neighborhoods ``is becoming unbearable.''
   Miami police say 25 Hispanic officers work in the Liberty City
and Overtown sections, two predominantly black areas where looting
and violence erupted after the shooting of motorcyclist Clement
Lloyd on Jan. 16.
   In the lawsuit, attorney Mark Rubin said Blanchard, who also was
black, was the victim of wrongful death and deprivation of civil
rights. He was fatally injured in an accident that immediately
followed Lloyd's shooting.
   In describing the alleged pattern of police behavior, Rubin cited
the 1979 police beating death of a black insurance executive, the
1986 drownings of three drug suspects and the 1988 police shooting
of a black man who washed car windshields for money.
   Lozano pleaded innocent Monday to criminal charges of
manslaughter with a firearm in the deaths of Lloyd, 23, and
Blanchard, 24. A June 19 trial date has been set.

   Balloonist Fumio Niwa floated on toward North

   Thirteen hours after taking to the air, Niwa's huge orange and

and flying at 12,900 feet, said project spokesman Tadakatsu Izumi.
   Niwa, 38, who quit his job in a computer company three months ago
to prepare for the flight, had left Yokohama before dawn, aiming for
San Diego.
   His plan was to grab a ride on the high-speed jet stream at about
26,000 feet altitude and travel 5,000 miles to North America in four
days _ but weather reports said the jet stream was angled more to
the north than usual, and might carry Niwa to Alaska.
   Izumi said Niwa was staying at a low altitude by holding on to
his ballast so the balloon would drift farther south before entering
the jet stream.
   ``All I see is clouds and the ocean,'' Izumi quoted Niwa as
saying by radio from the balloon's cramped gondola. ``It's boring. I
have nothing to take a picture of.''
   Before he lifted off, Niwa was aware of the problem with the wind
direction.
   ``My long dream of crossing the Pacific is coming true today,''
Niwa said. ``I still wonder if it's really possible. The jet stream
is bending strangely, but America is big, so I think I'll make it _
somewhere.''
   Izumi said Niwa reported in a radio contact that one compressor
used to maintain air pressure inside the gondola had failed, but the
pilot was using the sole standby compressor to continue the flight.
   The compressor sucks in the thin, high-altitude air and keeps
pressure inside the high-tech plastic gondola at normal levels.
   In 1981, four men crossed the Pacific in a balloon from Japan to
the United States for the first time, but no one has done it alone.
   The gondola, the fifth Niwa has designed, is 6 feet in diameter
but is not tall enough for him to stand. It has no heating to
protect Niwa from nighttime temperatures of about minus 50 degrees,
but his flying suit has built-in electric coils to keep him warm.
The coils are powered by batteries charged by solar panels outside
the gondola.
   Besides the compressor problem, Izumi said Niwa was bothered by
many amateur radio operators who found his frequency and called him
to chat. The spokesman said they had changed frequency, but the
amateurs were still calling.
   Niwa, who has about 1,000 hours of ballooning experience,
estimated the flight will cost about $540,000. He said money
constraints kept him from installing alarms to warn him of a loss of
gas in the balloon or a sudden change in altitude.
   Niwa planned to sleep during daylight hours and stay awake at
night when problems are more likely.

<HEAD>Settlement Allows Invocations To Continue Until High Court Rules</HEAD>

   Non-denominational invocations
will be allowed at football games and other extra-curricular events
in the Okaloosa County school system until the U.S. Supreme Court
rules on the prayer issue.
   The school board agreed Tuesday night to settle a lawsuit filed
by a Jewish family that objected to prayers at football games. Both
sides said they would await the outcome of a similar case in Georgia
that is expected to go to the Supreme Court.
   Board member Jim Harkins Jr., who cast the lone vote against the
settlement, said he objected because prayers in the name of Jesus
Christ would not be allowed.
   ``We can pray in God's name,'' said school board lawyer David
Selby. ``But we will not pray to Mohammed. We will not pray to
Buddha. We will not end a prayer in the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost, or in Jesus' name.''
   The lawsuit, filed in November 1987, objected to what then were
primarily Christian prayers offered by Protestant ministers at high
school and junior high football games.
   Without the settlement, the case would have gone to trial Feb. 27
in U.S. District Court in Pensacola.
   The lawsuit was filed by Air Force Master Sgt. Mark Berlin, who
is stationed at nearby Eglin Air Force Base, his wife, Jan, and
their children, Tammy and Max, with the support of the New
York-based American Jewish Congress.
   ``I think both sides got what they wanted,'' said Marc Stern, a
lawyer for the family. ``We did quite well.''
   As part of the settlement, the board agreed to pay $32,000 in
fees and legal expenses of the Berlins.
   A decision last month in a similar case by the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta led to the settlement. A three-judge
panel ruled 2-1 that non-sectarian prayers before public school
football games in Douglas County, Ga., were unconstitutional even if
they were offered by laymen rather than ministers.
   The appeals court ruled the primary purpose of the prayers was to
advance religion, which violated the First Amendment's doctrine of
separation of church and state and its religious freedom guarantees.
   Douglas County school officials have asked for a rehearing before
the full appeals court, which numbers about 30 judges, and failing
that will appeal to the Supreme Court, Selby said.
   He said the case would go to the Supreme Court regardless of
which side wins at the appellate level, and it may take up to two
years to settle the issue.

<HEAD>PACs Contribute To Legislators On Banking Panels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial institutions who have a direct stake
in the outcome of the savings and loan industry bailout contributed
$3.8 million to members of Congress who will shape the legislation,
it was reported.
   The members of congressional banking panels accepting campaign
contributions from groups representing financial institutions vastly
outnumbered those who rejected money from political action
committees, the Los Angeles Times reported today.
   In their last election campaigns, legislators accepting PAC money
outnumbered those who refused it by 70 to 1, the newspaper reported.
   Bank PACs contributed about $2.9 million, savings and loans gave
about $680,000 and credit unions donated about $210,000, according
to figures compiled for the Times.
   Charles O. Zuver, who lobbies for the Credit Union National
Association, said PAC contributions are aimed in part at gaining
access to legislators.
   ``If you do something for somebody, they'll usually remember
you,'' he said.
   President Bush's bailout proposal would increase federal
insurance premiums, substantially more for thrifts than banks, to
help repay $90 billion to depositors at failed institutions.
   The plan also calls for doubling the savings and loans' level of
capital, which would take away an advantage they have over banks. It
also would require federal bank regulators to oversee the thrifts.
   Senate banking committee members among the top 10 recipients of
PAC contributions from banks and savings and loans are: Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; Terry Sanford, D-North Carolina; Jim Sasser,
D-Tenn.; Jake Garn, R-Utah; and Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the
newspaper said.
   Those on the top 10 list of recipients serving on the House
Banking Committee include: Stephen L. Neal, D-North Carolina; John
Hiler, R-Ind.; Elizabeth Patterson, D-South Carolina; and David E.
Price, D-North Carolina.
   While Rep. Richard H. Lehman, D-Calif., a member of the House
Banking Committee, said it would be naive to believe PAC money
wields no influence, he contended that critics exaggerate it.
   Lehman received $20,400 from banks, savings and loans and credit
unions for his 1988 campaign.
   ``I don't think it (PAC money) will have any impact at all,''
said Riegle, Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee
chairman. He accepted $183,000 from PACs during his re-election
campaign.
   Federal Election Commission records show the new chairman of the
House Banking Committee, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, received
$5,500 from bank PACs in his re-election campaign last year. He also
received $1,500 from savings and loans and $1,200 from credit unions.
   Gonzalez, in a letter to the San Antonio Express-News, professed
disdain for PAC money, saying ``no PAC money from banks has ever
come to me.''
   Aides declined to make Gonzalez available for comment, the Times
said.

   Sergei Khrushchev was on a roll.
   The son of former Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was telling a
story about a bit of advice his father once gave him. He looked up
at the audience, chuckled, paused for effect ...
   And the translator muffed the punch line.
   Though flustered by the audience's silence, the 54-year-old
Soviet computer scientist really could not have made his point more
eloquently.
   He was giving a news conference Tuesday on his first trip to the
United States in 30 years, and the main thrust of his remarks was
that Soviets and Americans still have great difficulty understanding
each other.
   ``It seems to me that the main thing is, we've come to understand
how poorly we actually understand each other, and those
misunderstandings have led to missteps even at the highest levels,''
he said.
   It is a point of particular importance to Khrushchev these days,
because he has been vigorously denying American news reports that he
said Cuban leader Fidel Castro urged his father to launch a nuclear
strike on the United States during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.
   Those reports came out of a historic three-day conference in
Moscow last month that brought Soviet, Cuban and American
policymakers from that era together to discuss the missile crisis.
   Several newspapers reported that Sergei Khrushchev dropped a
bombshell on the conference by privately telling participants that
on Oct. 26, 1962, near the height of the crisis, Castro sought a
pre-emptive nuclear strike on the United States to forestall what he
believed was an imminent invasion of Cuba.
   After the translator botched Khrushchev's story Tuesday, the
Soviet said he thought a similar loss in translation may have
resulted in the disputed reports from Moscow.
   David A. Welch, a Harvard research fellow who attended the
conference, gave a possible explanation for the reports.
   He said many U.S. scholars believe Castro asked for Soviet troops
to fire anti-aircraft missiles at American military jets flying over
Cuba.
   ``When someone said Castro asked Khrushchev to fire the missiles,
(journalists) may have thought he was talking about the nuclear
missiles,'' Welch said.
   Welch added, however, that ``I wouldn't rule out entirely the
possibility that Castro asked for a nuclear strike ... If Castro did
make that request, it would be a politically very awkward fact to
admit.''
   The Moscow conference was the culmination of a six-year Harvard
study of the missile crisis, which brought the superpowers to the
brink of nuclear war as President John F. Kennedy ordered a naval
quarantine of Cuba and demanded that the Soviets remove their
nuclear rockets from the island.
   The world sat glued to televisions and radios as Soviet ships
steamed toward the quarantine line and what seemed like an
inevitable military confrontation. But Nikita Khrushchev eventually
backed down and pulled out the missiles in return for an American
pledge not to invade Cuba.
   The Boston Globe reported today that the United States was
considering attacking Cuba and had aircraft and ammunition in place
before the Soviet missiles were discovered there.
   One document said plans for an air attack, an invasion or both
were finished and troops were ordered into final readiness for
combat between Oct. 8 and Oct. 12, 1962, the Globe said.
   Robert S. McNamara, secretary of defense at the time, and
McGeorge Bundy, Kennedy's national security adviser, have said the
administration had no thoughts of invading Cuba at the time.
   The newspaper said it got a copy of the report from Graham
Allison, dean of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government,
where Khrushchev spoke.
   Sergei Khrushchev, whose father died in 1971, said Tuesday that
the crisis illustrated the danger of misunderstandings between the
superpowers. He also said there is a better opportunity today than
at any time in the past 25 years for an improvement in
Soviet-American relations.
   ``In the past, unity between peoples was considered science
fiction. But today, we see that as a real possibility,'' he said.

<HEAD>Indian Subsidiary To Pay Fraction Of Union Carbide Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DILIP GANGULY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to a
proposal by Union Carbide Corp. for its Indian subsidiary to pay
part of the $470 million settlement in the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster
that killed 3,300 people.
   A five-judge bench also issued an order protecting the Danbury,
Conn.-based multinational and its employees from any future suits,
claims or criminal complaints concerning the world's worst
industrial disaster.
   The court advanced the date of payment from March 31 to March 23
to enable the Indian government to record the payment before the
government's fiscal year ends. This could speed up distribution to
gas victims.
   The Supreme Court on Tuesday, in an effort to end four years of
legal wrangling, ordered Union Carbide to pay the entire $470
million dollars in ``full and final settlement'' for damages from
the disaster.
   It said further litigation efforts would be dismissed.
   The court said the payment would be used for the benefit of all
victims of the disaster and not as fines, penalties or punitive
damages.
   However, it gave no immediate details of how much money should be
paid for death, injury, medical care, job rehabilitation or any
other categories frequently mentioned by victims and political
activists.
   More than 20,000 people still suffer from exposure to the gas and
victims continue to die at a rate of at least one a day, according
to a government gas relief board.
   Union Carbide of India Ltd., a subsidiary of the U.S.-based
multinational, is the owner of the pesticide plant in the central
Indian city of Bhopal where methyl isocyanate leaked out of a
storage tank on Dec. 3, 1984.
   Under today's decision, the Indian subsidiary will pay the rupee
equivalent of $45 million. The parent company is responsible for the
remaining $425 million.
   The order should enable the U.S. company to make the payments
without financial complications.
   James Wilbur, a vice president with Smith Barney, Harris Upham
and Co. Inc. in New York, said Tuesday that Union Carbide had set
aside $200 million toward the settlement and had $250 million in
insurance coverage.
   Meanwhile, a senior official of the Indian subsidiary said the
company may soon decide on the fate of the Bhopal plant, which has
stood idle since the disaster.
   ``Now that the curtain has finally come, down we will sit down
and decide what to do,'' said Kishore Hattangdi, corporate
communication manager of the company. ``But we have miles to go.''

<HEAD>Jury Blames Government, Port Authority for World Airways Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE H. DREYFOUS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury's finding that the federal government and
Massachusetts Port Authority were to blame for the 1982 crash of a
World Airways jet here came as surprise, the airline's attorney says.
   The U.S. District Court jury Tuesday exonerated World Airways in
the crash, in which a DC-10 carrying 105 passengers and 12 crew
members slid off an icy runway at Logan International Airport. Two
passengers were presumed killed and 39 were injured.
   World Airways, the federal government and Massport, which
operates Logan, have blamed each other for the accident.
   David W. Davis, executive director of Massport which operates
Logan, could not immediately say whether the agency would appeal
Tuesday's verdict.
   ``I felt very strongly and still feel that the principal cause of
the accident was pilot error but for whatever reason the jury has
felt differently and we're going to have to go on from there,''
Davis said.
   James Meehan, chief counsel for World Airways, said the decision
was ``a wonderful and hard-fought victory.''
   ``It took seven years to put the pieces of what happened that
night together,'' Meehan said, ``and finally to lay the
responsibility where it should rest for World Airways and that's
with Massport and the federal government and they fought it all the
way.''
   A new trial to determine who will pay what percentage of damages
was scheduled to begin Feb. 27 in U.S. District Court here.
   Meehan said that although the jury assigned blame to both the
Federal Aviation Administration and Massport, World Airways would
seek to recover damages only from the Port Authority.
   Under federal law, interest on the cost of compensation, the lost
aircraft and the rescue of passengers and crew from the wrecked
aircraft cannot be assessed on the U.S. government.
   ``But we can recover the full amount from Massport and that's
what we intend to do,'' Meehan said.
   Meehan said the ruling came as a pleasant surprise following U.S.
District Judge Robert E. Keeton's 1986 ruling, which found World
Airways 50 percent responsible for the accident, Massport 30 percent
responsible and the federal government 20 percent responsible.
   At the time, Keeton said Massport had failed to close the runway
despite hazardous conditions and that neither it nor the FAA had
informed World Airways that conditions had deteriorated.
   Massport and the federal government have maintained, however,
that the crash was caused by pilot error.
   Keeton made his ruling after a previous jury failed to reach a
verdict and a mistrial was declared.
   Lawyers for both sides said it was not immediately clear how the
divergent decisions would affect one another, but Meehan said
Keeton's ruling was binding solely on the U.S. government.

<HEAD>Tyson Divorces Givens In Dominican Republic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavyweight boxing
champion Mike Tyson got a Valentine's Day divorce from his former
sweetheart, actress Robin Givens.
   Tyson, accompanied by boxing promoter Don King, was cheered by
passengers on his flight from Miami and in the airport terminal, 17
miles from Santo Domingo. He waved his arm in a victory sign.
   Ninety minutes after his arrival Tuesday, the 22-year-old boxer
and his lawyers appeared before Judge Ricardo Gomez at the capital's
Civil and Commercial Court, where he signed papers making the
divorce final.
   A law in this Caribbean nation allows for divorce between
foreigners to be carried out in the presence of only one of the
parties, provided an official document ratified by lawyers of the
other person also is presented.
   Neal Hersh, an attorney for Ms. Givens, said the 24-year-old
actress signed settlement documents last week.
   ``Mike went to the Dominican Republic because Robin was
unavailable due to her acting commitments in Los Angeles,'' Hersh
said in Los Angeles.
   Ms. Givens' New York attorney, Raoul Felder, has said Ms. Givens
would keep her possessions, and Tyson ``will keep what is his.''
   Tyson and Ms. Givens were married Feb. 7, 1988, in Chicago after
the National Basketball Association All-Star game, which Tyson
attended, and then remarried two days later in New York because they
didn't have an Illinois license.
   Tyson and his lawyers met with Gomez in the judge's office to
sign the divorce papers. The court had closed four hours earlier,
and when Tyson arrived the judge, janitors and a few secretaries
were the only people present.
   During an interview with Barbara Walters on ABC's ``20-20'' last
October, Ms. Givens said Tyson has an ``extremely volatile temper''
and that she was afraid of him.
   A few days after the interview, police in New Jersey went into
the couple's Bernardsville mansion to try to calm Tyson at the
request of Ms. Givens and her mother, Ruth Roper, because the
champion reportedly had angrily hurled furniture through windows.
   Tyson will defend his heavyweight crown in Las Vegas on Feb. 25
against Frank Bruno of Great Britain.

   The Red Army commander for Afghanistan
today led the last contingent of his troops across a border bridge,
ending for the Soviets a nine-year war that claimed the lives of
15,000 of their countrymen.
   ``That is it _ this war has come to an end,'' a Moscow Radio
correspondent said from the scene.
   About 200 cheering, windburned soldiers, clutching automatic
rifles and riding mud-spattered armored personnel carriers, roared
across the steel bridge spanning the Amu Darya River just 40 minutes
before the noon withdrawal deadline set by an accord signed in April.
   ``I wasn't looking back,'' said Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov, the
commander, after the Red Army officially left Afghanistan's army
alone to face Moslem guerrillas in a 10-year-old civil war.
   He rode in the last armored personnel carrier and was met halfway
across the bridge by his 14-year-old son, Maxim, who carried a
bouquet of flowers.
   Together, they walked the final yards to Termez.
   The 45-year-old general, at times appearing near tears, was
kissed by a soldier, then climbed atop an armored personnel carrier
to be taken to a dusty hillside for the official welcoming ceremony.
   Some at the ceremony said getting involved in a neighbor's civil
war was a mistake.
   ``It was a clear error, so many died,'' said senior Sgt. Asgat
Husayinov, 22. He said Afghanistan was ``a hell after which you fear
nothing, except maybe yourself.'' The soldiers at the ceremony
received watches sent on the orders of Defense Minister Dmitri T.
Yazov.
   Lt. Col. Igor Azarenok of the Defense Ministry said Gromov's
group was the last to leave, ending what many Soviets have come to
view as their Vietnam.
   In Moscow, the Communist Party daily Pravda said Leonid
Brezhnev's decision in 1979 to send troops to Afghanistan may have
been an error. It suggested future commitments of Soviet forces
abroad should be sanctioned by Parliament.
   It called the withdrawal ``the first step'' toward peace in
Afghanistan.
   With Gromov and his troops gone, guerrilla leaders have predicted
that major cities held by the Soviet-backed government will fall in
a matter of weeks, if not days.
   Soviet media have reported looting by troops of the 30,000-member
Afghan army _ and mass desertions as the U.S.-supplied guerrillas
gain ground.
   Soviet officials estimate 30,000 guerrillas are massed around the
cold, hungry capital of Kabul, which has been blockaded for months.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said another 15,000
guerrillas were around the eastern city of Jalalabad. Kabul Radio,
monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp., reported more
insurgents surrounding Herat and Khandahar.
   Guerrillas claimed there was heavy fighting around a former
Soviet airbase north of Kabul.
   Along the muddy, narrow streets of Kabul's bazaar, merchants
huddling under thick quilts seemed more interested in bartering for
their goods than discussing the Soviet withdrawal.
   ``The Russians are gone,'' said one, trying to sell Soviet fur
hats. ``Now there will be peace.''
   There was no announcement on national radio or television about
the final departure. Only those with access to BBC radio heard the
news.
   The decision to intervene in Afghanistan was made by the late
President Brezhnev and a few close associates, high-ranking
officials have said. Pravda said the security threat perceived by
them may not have merited sending in troops.
   ``It is possible to doubt the Brezhnev leadership's evaluation of
the level of military ttest pain and worry for
our people. Scientists, politicians, soldiers and all other people
will be thinking and debating for a long time whether the decision
of the government of the country taken at that time was right.''
   Pravda continued, ``It is possible to say that such vitally
important decisions as the use of troops cannot be decided secretly
by a small circle of people, without the sanction of the parliament
of the country.''
   The Soviet Parliament has been a rubber-stamp body for decades,
but recent reforms under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev have
strengthened its role.
   A spokesman for the Pakistan-based Jamiat-i-Islami guerrilla
group said its fighters captured 155 Afghan government soldiers and
10 officers in an attack Saturday on the huge Bagram airbase, 24
miles north of the capital.
   He said 10 guerrillas were killed or wounded and that fighting
continued today, but he gave no details, and there was no
independent confirmation.
   Kabul state radio said guerrillas fired five rockets into the
capital on Tuesday, killing four children and an old man lined up in
the snow for bread.
   It said two rockets landed at the airport.
   The final Soviet troops in Kabul left aboard military transport
planes late Tuesday.
   Soviet soldiers intervened in Afghanistan a year after a Marxist
coup touched off civil war with Moslem guerrillas. At the height of
its involvement, the Red Army had an estimated 115,000 soldiers in
the country.
   Under a U.N.-mediated accord signed in Geneva in April, the
withdrawal began May 15.

   A 108-pound dog whose owner was being
attacked by a robber crashed through a glass storm door and chased
the assailant away, police and the pet's owner said.
   ``I think the dog saved my life,'' said Buddy's owner, Peggy
Satterwhite.
   Mrs. Satterwhite said she was playing with Buddy, a Bernese
Mountain dog described as having the characteristics of a lamb, in
the back yard Tuesday morning when she heard the sound of breaking
glass. She went in to investigate.
   As soon as she walked in, a man grabbed her and began choking
her. ``I was gagging, couldn't breathe,'' she said.
   He demanded money, and while Mrs. Satterwhite struggled, he bound
and gagged her with duct tape. He took her wedding band, another
ring, her watch and two necklaces she was wearing.
   Outside, Buddy barked furiously. The robber cursed at the dog,
opened the storm door and threw a radio at him.
   The man beat Mrs. Satterwhite on the head and shoved her onto the
floor against a wall, she said. She only heard what happened next.
   ``Buddy crashed through that door like hell on fire,'' she said.
``Buddy chased the man.''
   As best as Mrs. Satterwhite can tell, the man raced through the
house and jumped out the same bedroom window he had broken to get
in. He escaped with the jewelry he had taken.
   After Mrs. Satterwhite worked her hands free, she found Buddy
sitting quietly in another room. He had suffered only a minor cut on
one paw. She telephoned her husband and police were summoned.

   Turner Entertainment Co. said it will not
colorize Orson Welles' black-and-white film classic ``Citizen Kane''
because the late director's estate may have the right to prohibit it.
   A storm of criticism blew up in January when the company revealed
it was colorizing test scenes. Director Henry Jaglom said Welles
specifically asked him to protect the movie from such treatment two
weeks before he died in 1985.
   Turner Entertainment, which is part of Ted Turner's broadcasting
empire, obtained partial rights to ``Citizen Kane'' with the 1986
acquisition of MGM's film library and remaining rights from RKO
Pictures in 1987.
   Turner President Roger Mayer's announcement Tuesday that
preparations to color the film had stopped indicated that it was a
legal decision rather than a bow to those who claim coloring
artistically spoils a black-and-white film.
   ``Our attorneys looked at the contract between RKO Pictures Inc.
and Orson Welles and his production company, Mercury Productions
Inc., and, on the basis of their review, we have decided not to
proceed with colorization of the movie,'' Mayer said.
   ``While a court test might uphold our legal right to colorize the
film, provisions of the contract could be read to prohibit
colorization without permission of the Welles estate. We have
completed restoration of a printing negative which now enables us to
show first-rate black and white prints of this masterpiece.''
   ``Citizen Kane'' is considered one of the finest American movies
ever made. Welles starred in and directed the 1941 saga of a wealthy
and reclusive newspaper publisher.
   Jaglom recounted last month that Welles was adamant about not
letting his film be tinted.
   ``Orson said to me at lunch, about two weeks before he died, I
remember this vividly, `Please do this for me. Don't let Ted Turner
deface my movie with his crayons,''' Jaglom said.
   Movie purists have previously lamented the colorizing of such
classics as ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' ``Casablanca'' and ``A
Christmas Carol.''
   Proponents claim adding color gives films a wider audience.

<HEAD>Two More Executives Arrested In Stock Trading Scandal</HEAD>

   Prosecutors today arrested two top executives of
companies at the center of a stock trading scandal, news reports
said, bringing to six the number of people charged in the affair.
   The managing director of Recruit Co., a fast-growing business
information conglomerate, and the managing director of a real estate
subsidiary, Recruit-Cosmos Co., were arrested on charges of
violating the Securities and Exchange Law, television and news
agency reports said.
   They identified those arrested as Shunjiro Mamiya of Recruit and
Seiichi Tateoka of Recruit-Cosmos.
   Prosecution officials refused to discuss the reports, saying they
would talk only to reporters from a handful of Japanese news
organizations assigned to covering their office.
   The parent company sold valuable stocks in the subsidiary to
dozens of politicians, their aides and influential businessmen and
journalists.
   Today's reported arrests came two days after the parent company's
founder and three others were arrested on bribery charges.
   Prosecutors Monday arrested Recruit's founder, Hiromasa Ezoe, an
executive of a Recruit-affiliated finance company and two executives
of Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Corp., Japan's largest company.
   Recruit-Cosmos sold hundreds of thousands of shares prior to
their public listing to the political and business figures. The
stocks soared in value after being made available for
over-the-counter trading, bringing huge profits to the purchasers.
   Those arrested Monday were held on suspicion of bribery involving
resale of U.S.-made supercomputers by NTT to Recruit and leasing
telephone lines to Recruit at discount prices.
   Thirty officers from the prosecutors office searched NTT's
downtown Tokyo offices for more than eight hours Tuesday,
confiscating documents that filled 70 boxes.
   Mamiya played a central role in the sale of Recruit-Cosmos
stocks, while Tateoka looked after the financial aspect of the
transactions, according to the reports.
   The sales were not illegal under Japanese law, but give the
impression of influence-peddling and raised outcries among the
public and in Parliament about political fundraising and ethics in
government.
   More than a dozen members of Parliament _ including three
incumbent Cabinet ministers _ former top bureaucrats and senior
businessmen have stepped down from public positions because of their
link to the scandal.
   Most of the politicians and political aides so far named in the
Recruit affair have come from Prime Minister Takeshita's governing
Liberal Democratic Party, which has come under increasingly harsh
public criticism because of the scandal.
   The Liberal Democrats lost a Parliamentary seat to the Japan
Socialist Party in a by-election last Sunday in what was widely seen
as a referendum on public support for Takeshita's government.
   Opposition parties have repeatedly insisted that Takeshita and
his Cabinet resign over the affair, but Takeshita has rejected the
calls.

   The presidents of five Central
American countries have agreed to dismantle military bases used by
Nicaraguan rebels in Honduras and to hold elections in Nicaragua.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua said his leftist government
will move up elections to February 1990 and let the opposition help
organize them.
   The presidents said they would devise a plan within 90 days for
disbanding the U.S.-backed rebel force in Honduras, estimated at
11,000 fighters.
   The accord was reached Tuesday, at the end of a two-day summit
meeting.
   ``We're ready to return to Nicaragua when we see that Ortega
seriously is going to begin implementing his promises,'' Adolfo
Calero, a member of the Contra directorate, told a news conference.
   The United States cut off military aid to the Contras 12 months
ago.
   The summit produced an eight-page accord the presidents said
would reinvigorate the regional peace plan they signed 18 months ago.
   President Jose Azcona of Honduras, whose country became the
Contras' haven at the urging of the United States, said he expected
Washington to back the agreement. There was no immediate comment
from the State Department.
   ``We believe we have adopted a decision in the interest of the
five Central American countries. We also believe that the United
States ... will respect the accord that we have signed this day,''
Azcona told a news conference.
   What remained unresolved was the issue of verification of
progress toward democracy under the Central American peace plan.
   Ortega promised to move up national elections, which had been
scheduled for November 1990, and to hold local elections at the same
time.
   His term is to end in January 1991 but members of the ruling
Sandinista party have indicated that could change.
   Ortega said opposition parties would have equal access to radio
and television _ which the government now controls _ and
representation on the national election commission.
   He also said the entire election process would be open to
international observers.
   Nicaragua promised to free about 1,600 imprisoned Contras and
members of the National Guard of dictator Anastasio Somoza, who was
overthrown in 1979 by the revolution the Sandinistas rode to power.
   The five-way agreement on disbanding the Contras, adopted at the
urging of both Nicaragua and Honduras, calls for the rebels and
their families to be offered voluntary repatriation or relocation to
``third countries.''
   The Contra leaders, consigned to the sidelines during the
negotiations over their fate and safe haven, were stung by the
agreement.
   ``I would say whatever accord is reached based on Ortega's
promises is equivalent to trying to leash a dog with sausage
links,'' Calero said after the summit.
   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace
Prize for authoring the regional peace plan, said the international
community should help relocate the Contras and their estimated
10,000 family members.
   He said ``those who sponsored the Contras for many years'' should
feel most responsible for finding them new homes.
   Ortega's promises of democratization, said Contra directorate
member Roberto Ferrey, signaled ``the burial of the Sandinista
dictatorship.''
   For their part, Sandinista officials said they came to the summit
looking for help in burying what Ortega has called the Contra
``cadaver'' and declaring Nicaragua's readiness for democracy.
   That readiness, they said, sprang from the military and political
defeat of the Contras and the change of administrations in
Washington.
   The Bush administration has said it would prefer a diplomatic
solution to the eight-year Nicaraguan conflict over the military
option the Reagan administration had so vigorously pursued.
   The Central American summit at this beach resort 25 miles
southeast of San Salvador was the regional leaders' first meeting in
13 months and took place after five postponements.
   The last presidents' meeting was in January 1988, the deadline
for implementing the provisions of the regional peace plan.
   The plan calls for an end to outside aid to insurgents, political
amnesties and democratic reforms. It bars each signatory from
letting its territory be used for insurgent attacks on neighboring
nations.
   The plan was a catalyst for a cease-fire signed last March by the
Contras and the Sandinistas, but it has not quelled civil wars in El
Salvador and Guatemala.
   In the summit document, Arias, Azcona and Presidents Jose
Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador and Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala took
formal note of Nicaragua's new pronouncements about democratization.

<HEAD>Man Given Life Prison Term For Sexually Assaulting Stepdaughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man has been sentenced to life in prison for
sexually assaulting his 9-year-old stepdaughter, a leukemia victim.
   Authorities say the 31-year-old man, whose name was withheld to
protect the victim's identity, assaulted the girl several times,
including once while he was free on bond awaiting sentencing on a
charge of sexually assaulting her.
   He pleaded guilty to two counts of sexually molesting his
daughter. State District Judge Frances Maloney announced the
sentence Tuesday.
   Defense lawyers had asked that the man be placed on probation so
that he could get psychological help, but prosecutor Lynne Cartsunis
had asked for the life term.
   The sentence was ``completely appropriate for what he did to this
child,'' Cartsunis said. ``I hope it tells that child and other
children that they will be protected from this kind of abuse.''
   The man, who lost his job as a baggage handler for American
Airlines following his arrest last December, had pleaded guilty last
September to fondling the child four times between July and October
1987. But he was allowed to remain free on bond while awaiting
sentencing.
   When authorities discovered that he had allegedly raped the girl
in November, Maloney ordered him arrested and set his bond at
$500,000.
   The man testified Monday that the attacks were a form of
``compassion'' that ``went the wrong way.''
   He agreed to plead guilty to the charges stemming from the
attacks in 1987 and last November in a deal that prosecutors said
would keep the child from having to testify against him. The only
issue during the trial was the length of his sentence.

   Residents of this besieged city quietly
bid good riddance to the Soviet army today and said they hoped the
completion of the withdrawal would lead to peace.
   ``The Russians are gone,'' said a merchant in the city's old
bazaar who identified himself as Hasan. ``Now there will be peace,''
he said as he tried to sell one of the few Soviet fur hats left in
the shopping district.
   ``We are brothers,'' another merchant said, referring to the
Moslem guerrillas massed outside the capital. ``We can solve our
problems without foreigners. The problems are just between Afghans.
We don't need help from foreigners,'' said the jewelry seller, who
gave only his first name, Ghulam.
   As the merchants spoke, the last Soviet troops rolled home from
Afghanistan, crossing a bridge at the border town of Termez.
   Guerrilla leaders have predicted that with the Red Army gone,
major Afghan cities held by the Soviet-backed government of
President Najib would fall within weeks. A loose coalition of
guerrilla factions has been meeting in Pakistan to coordinate their
plans.
   The completion of the Soviet withdrawal was not announced on
Afghan national radio or television.
   Along the muddy, narrow streets of the city's old bazaar today,
merchants wearing thick quilts against the bitter cold seemed more
interested in bartering for their goods than discussing the Soviets
withdrawal.
   The pullout from Kabul was completed Tuesday night when about 80
Red Army troops at the city's airport filed two-by-two onto the four
Il-76 military transport planes that would take them home.
   A few Afghan soldiers stationed at checkpoints around the airport
watched the Soviets' departure. For the first time in nine years,
the Afghan army alone will have to defend the embattled capital
against Moslem guerrillas.
   As the Soviet pullout neared completion, many foreign embassies
closed.
   The latest to withdraw its diplomats was Poland, which sent its
four envoys home on Tuesday. Hungary closed its embassy last week.
   West Germany, the United States, France, Italy, Britain and
Austria closed their missions earlier this month.
   Since mid-January, Moscow has been airlifting up to 600 tons of
flour, fuel and other supplies into the capital, to help ease
shortages that have caused long lines at bakeries and gasoline
stations. Refugees fleeing fighting in the rugged countryside have
swelled Kabul's population to 2.2 million.
   The Soviets had hoped to bring in 12,000 tons of flour by today,
but Red Army soldiers said the goal had not been met, partly due to
heavy snows that closed the airport for several days.
   Th Soviet Union agreed to withdraw its troops from Afghanstan
under a U.N.-sponsored accord signed in Geneva in April.
   Moscow sent the troops into Afghanistan in December 1979 to back
the Marxist government in war with the Moslem insurgents. At the
height of the Soviet involvement, there were an estimated 115,000
Red Army troops in Afghanistan.
   More than 1 million people, including more than 15,000 Soviet
soldiers, have died in the fighting and about 5 millions of Afghans
fled to refugee camps in neighboring Pakistan and Iran.

   A federal judge has sentenced a teen-ager to nine
months in prison for tapping into U.S. military computers and
copying highly sensitive computer programs valued at $1.2 million.
   Herbert Zinn Jr., 18, of Chicago, was also ordered Tuesday by
U.S. District Judge Paul Plunkett to pay a $10,000 fine and serve 2{
years' probation.
   Zinn was 17 when he broke into computers at AT&amp;T, NATO and the
Defense Department. His case is one of the first ever brought under
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.
   ``Our intention is to prosecute such cases aggressively in the
future,'' said U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas.
   In sentencing Zinn, Plunkett said he hoped that the young man's
brush with the law would direct his extraordinary computer skills
toward legal outlets.
   Zinn was convicted Jan. 23 of breaking into AT&amp;T and U.S.
government computers in three states, illegally copying more than
$1.2 million worth of computer software, and of illegally publishing
computer passwords on computer bulletin boards in Chicago and Texas.
   Court documents indicate that Zinn, a high school dropout who
used the name Shadow Hawk, broke into AT&amp;T computers in suburban
Naperville and New Jersey, as well as NATO computers run by AT&amp;T in
Burlington, N.C., and at Robbins Air Force Base in Georgia. The
intrusions took place from July to September 1987.
   Zinn stole an estimated 55 computer programs, including complex
programs relating to artificial intelligence and computer designs,
according to the court documents. No classified materials were
obtained, but the government regards the programs obtained by Zinn
as ``highly sensitive.''
   By entering the computers, Zinn caused $174,000 worth of damage
to AT&amp;T equipment, according to the court documents.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney William Cook said Zinn obtained access to
the AT&amp;T computers from underground computer bulletin boards.
   Zinn was uncovered in 1987 when AT&amp;T security officials spotted
his telephone number and his messages in the computer bulletin board
system.

   Sinhalese gunmen killed the son of a
Cabinet minister and at least 46 other people today, but millions of
people voted for a new Parliament despite the violence, officials
said.
   Police shot and killed at least seven Sinhalese extremists who
tried to disrupt voting at various places across the country, police
reported. Tamil militants killed two other people, the police said.
   An estimated 65 percent of 9.3 million eligible voters cast
ballots by the time the polls closed, according to Deputy Election
Commissioner Lakshman Perera. No results are expected until Thursday.
   Only 55 percent of those eligible cast ballots in the
presidential election last December.
   More than 1,000 people, including 14 candidates, have been slain
since campaigning started Jan. 6. Sinhalese and Tamil militants
vowed to disrupt the election and threatened to kill voters.
   Both groups oppose a plan to grant the country's ethnic Tamil
minority greater autonomy. The Sinhalese say it is too generous, and
the Tamils say that it is inadequate.
   More than 80,000 soldiers and policemen took up positions across
the island to ensure calm balloting, government officials said.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa predicted victory for his United
National Party in the 225-seat Parliament where it has held a strong
majority.
   ``We have given maximum protection to the voters,'' Premadasa
told reporters as he walked 500 yards to a Colombo polling station
to cast his ballot.
   A few hours later, police reported that Jayantha Mallimarachchi,
son of Fuel Minister Weerasinghe Mallimarachchi, was killed when
Sinhalese extremists ambushed his jeep in a Colombo suburb.
   They said the extremists killed 46 other people in a series of
election day attacks across the Sinhalese heartland of central and
southern Sri Lanka.
   The victims included two election officials and a soldier whose
jeep was ambushed while they were taking ballot boxes to a polling
center near Bandarawela, 80 miles east of Colombo, the police said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Five other election officials were reported missing after their
two jeeps and several ballot boxes were found burned in the
Mahiyangane district in the middle of the island nation.
   Police blamed all the attacks on the People's Liberation Front, a
Sinhalese group.
   The United National Party held 139 of the 168 seats in the
outgoing Parliament. The chief opposition group, former Primer
Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike's Sri Lanka Freedom Party, held only
eight.
   Smaller parties and independents had the rest.
   Sinhalese militants oppose the elections as part of an
anti-government campaign launched in July 1987.
   They say the government gave away too much to autonomy-seeking
rebels of the minority Tamil community in a largely unsuccessful
attempt to bring an end to the six-year-old Tamil insurrection.
   The elections also are opposed by the Tamil guerrillas, who are
fighting for an independent homeland in the north and east.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and say
they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up 75
percent of the population and control the government and military.

<TEXT>
   At least 40 people were killed today in
tank and artillery battles between army troops and Christian
militiamen in east Beirut and the hills above the capital, police
reported.
   A communique from the army command of Gen. Michel Aoun said seven
soldiers and officers were killed, 14 were wounded, and three were
missing and presumed kidnapped in the latest battle for control of
Lebanon's Christian heartland.
   Police said most of the other casualties were from the Lebanese
Forces, the main Christian militia in the nearly 14-year-old civil
war against the Moslems. They said at least 90 people were wounded.
   Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib, who commands Moslem units of Lebanon's
divided army, declared support for Aoun, saying ``the Lebanese
Forces are our common enemy.''
   Khatib's statement was broadcast by Moslem-controlled radio
stations. He has about 22,000 soldiers under his command. Aoun has
an estimated 20,000 Christian soldiers under his command.
   Fires burned out of control as tank-led Christian army units
rolled down from the central mountains into east Beirut behind a
heavy barrage of artillery on the militia's seaside war council
command headquarters, police said.
   The stench of cordite wafted across the city.
   Police said Aoun's units drove the Lebanese Forces from their
main barracks in east Beirut's densely populated Ein Rummaneh
district and circled another barracks in the sprawling Ashrafiyeh
neighborhood.
   ``The army is pushing hard to capture the whole of east Beirut,''
said a police spokesman, who under standing rules could not be
identified.
   He said the army was trying to seize sections of the northern
coastal highway to block the Lebanese Forces' supply routes between
their strongholds of Byblos and Jounieh.
   The spokesman said army commandos stormed the headquarters of the
Lebanese Forces' French-language newspaper Le Reveil in east Beirut
and also flushed out militiamen from villages around the mountain
towns of Souk el-Gharb, Beit Meri and Bekfaya above Beirut.
   Christian militiamen mounted grenade assaults on army barracks in
Sarba and a nearby air base in the coastal town of Edma, 15 miles
north of Beirut, a police spokesman said.
   Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, spiritual guide of the dominant
Maronite Catholic community to which most of the belligerents
belong, appealed for a cease-fire.
   ``From the hell of this disastrous bloody battle throughout the
Christian hinterland, we appeal to the warring brethren to stop
shooting at once and allow peace negotiators to avert further
bloodletting and destruction,'' Sfeir said in a statement.
   The command of the 6,000-strong Lebanese Forces, which is led by
Samir Geagea, announced its ``full preparedness to abide by a
cease-fire on all warfronts.''
   Aoun's command in suburban Yarze, five miles east of Beirut, said
the general told the patriarch also was willing to stop shooting.
   Fighting subsided after the announcements, but police said the
lull was short-lived, and fierce battles broke out at midday.

<HEAD>Former Judge Caught in Court Scandal Sentenced to Six Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former judge was sentenced to six years in
prison for paying bribes, becoming the 15th former judge punished in
the Operation Greylord crackdown on court corruption.
   James Oakey, 57, told U.S. District Judge James Holderman before
sentencing Tuesday that he had ``sunk as low as I can sink.''
   ``It's a terrible way to end a legal career,'' said Oakey, a
former Cook County circuit judge.
   Under a plea-agreement, Holderman could have sentenced Oakey to
up to eight years in prison on racketeering charges involving bribes
he admitted paying to the former chief judge of the Traffic Court,
Richard LeFevour.
   LeFevour was convicted of corruption in another Greylord case and
is serving a 12-year federal prison sentence.
   In 1982 and 1983, Oakey had left the bench and was practicing
law. He admitted paying $200 to $300 a week so he could drum up
business from defendants in the courtrooms.
   Oakey said he started hustling defendants in the courtroom after
he lost his judgeship in 1975, following allegations that he had an
improper relationship with a private security firm.
   However, Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Mendeloff said the
prosecution had evidence that Oakey was taking money to fix cases
even while on the bench.
   Mendeloff said nearly 100 people have been sentenced in the
Operation Greylord investigation of corruption in the Cook County
court system.
   Oakey's six-year sentence will run concurrently with an 18-month
prison term he is already serving for tax evasion.

said. The killer set the bodies on fire and locked the children,
ages 4 to 11, in a bedroom.
   The fire destroyed the single-story brick house, but the children
escaped unharmed when the oldest child broke through a window. Fire
Chief Alan Causey said only the rafters were left standing by the
time firefighters arrived.
   John Wayne Owens, 27, was arrested at the home of his ex-wife two
hours after the fire, police said. Owens was charged with two counts
of murder, along with arson and burglary. He was held in the Marion
County Jail.
   County authorities said the motive is unknown, but some people
who knew the suspect said the Valentine's Day shooting stemmed from
a broken love affair.
   Nichols Magistrate Evan Goodyear said Owens had tried desperately
to win the woman back, even threatening suicide.
   ``It's a real tragic situation,'' Goodyear said.

<HEAD>$500,000 Vase Missing from Syracuse Museum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vase worth $500,000 and considered one of
the best-known pieces of ceramics in the world has been stolen from
a museum here, just days after a similar robbery in Albany 150 miles
away.
   ``It's the Mona Lisa of ceramics,'' Ronald Kuchta, art director
of the Everson Museum, said Tuesday of the Scarab Vase, made in 1910
by potter Adelaide Alsop Robineau of Syracuse.
   The theft at the Everson was discovered just a few hours after
Kuchta distributed copies of a newspaper article about the theft of
three small sculptures from the Albany Institute of History and Art
on Saturday.
   The Scarab Vase, its value estimated at $500,000, was apparently
removed from the Everson's Falcone Gallery between 7:30 a.m. Monday
and 10 a.m. Tuesday, while the museum was closed to the public,
Kuchta said.
   A thief removed four screws holding a plexiglass cover over the
vase, took the 17-inch-tall aqua-tinted work, and substituted a less
valuable copper vase.
   ``This is staggering. The vase is irreplaceable. It's one of the
best-known pieces of ceramics in the world, probably the best-known
piece of ceramics in the United States,'' Kuchta said. The vase was
purchased by the Everson in 1930, the year after Robineau's death.
   Kuchta said he was unsure how the vase was removed without
activating the Everson's electronic security system or drawing the
attention of museum guards.
   The vase could not be easily stuffed under a coat because it is
so delicate, Kuchta said.
   Everson has notified Syracuse police, the FBI and the
International Foundation for Art Research, a New York organization
that monitors art thefts.
   The vase, which is insured, is so well known in art circles that
there is virtually no chance it could be sold to a museum, dealer or
reputable art collector, Kuchta said.

   Moslems in Yorkshire wrote the latest chapter in
the world's long history of book-burning when they used a cigarette
lighter to set fire to a copy of Salman Rushdie's ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   The Moslems, who mostly emigrated from Pakistan to work in the
textile mills of Bradford, say the novel blasphemes their Islamic
religion and demand that it be withdrawn.
   Their protest-by-burning on Tuesday night was seen on British
TV's commercial Channel 4 network.
   The Indian-born Rushdie lives in London. He says he takes ``very
seriously indeed'' a call to Moslems on Tuesday by Iran's Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini to kill the author and publishers of ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   Violence over the novel has killed at least seven people in
Pakistan and India.
   And so, in further anger, the book burning on Tuesday night _ a
practice at least as old as the Great Wall of China.
   In 230 B.C. in China, Emperor Shih Huang Ti who called himself
the First Emperor, unified the country and constructed the Great
Wall. But he is chiefly remembered for burning books.
   The emperor apparently believed the books of the past provided
ammunition for his intellectual opponents. So he had all the
existing literature _ including the works of China's greatest sage,
Confucius _ gathered and committed to the flames.
   Exempted were some copies he preserved for the imperial library
and books dealing with the occult, medicine, farming and
tree-growing. Chinese scholars to this day still reproach him for
his vandalism.
   The emnperor commanded scholars to stop discussing the past and
buried many of them alive when they protested.
   The ``Decameron'' by Giovanni Boccaccio, one of the earliest
works in Italian and among the most famous books in all literature,
was publicly burned in Florence more than a century after the author
died in 1375.
   A collection of moral and immoral tales, it was ordered to the
flames by Girolama Savonarola, a priest who campaigned against
corruption and immorality.
   Bonfires also consumed the works of Francesco di Petracco, known
as Petrarch, the Italian humanist, inaugurator of the Renaissance in
Italy and a supreme poet of love.
   Savonarola himself was accused of heresy after he denounced Pope
Alexander VI and was tortured, hanged and burned at the stake in
1498.
   The Roman Catholic Church in 1520 burned the writings of Martin
Luther, the German religious reformer and founder of Protestanism.
Luther retaliated by publicly consigning Pope Leo X's condemnation
of himself to the flames, together with a copy of the church's laws.
   John Milton, author of ``Paradise Lost'' and regarded as
England's greatest poet after William Shakespeare, fared no better.
Two of his works, ``Eikonklastes'' and ``Defensio prima,'' were
gathered and burned in 1660 by order of the House of Commons.
   The works were written in defense of the Commonwealth led by
Oliver Cromwell, whom Milton enthusiastically supported.
   The persecution of Milton began with the restoration of the
monarchy when King Charles II came to the throne. But Milton escaped
the scaffold, probably because he had friends at court like the poet
Andrew Marvell.
   Another kind of book-burning took place in Germany in 1817, at a
time when student associations were agitating for German unity.
Liberal students publicly burned the writings of conservatives whose
ideas they opposed.
   The most notorious book-burning of modern times was in Germany in
1933, the first year of Adolf Hitler's dictatorship.
   The Nazis began burning books by Jewish writers, by socialists
and Marxists in April, less than three months after Hitler became
chancellor.
   Their bonfire was lit in front of the Berlin Opera House on May
10. Works by hundreds of writers which had been seized from
libraries were burned in a huge pile.
   Among the authors were the Germans, playwright Bertolt Brecht,
novelists Lion Feuchtwanger, brothers Heinrich and Thomas Mann,
Franz Werfel who wrote ``The Song of Bernadette'' and cultural
theorist Walter Benjamin; Austrian novelists Arthur Schnitzler and
Stefan Zweig and Czech novelist Franz Kafka.
   Alumni at Dulwich College in London recall that some books by one
of their famous old boys, humorous English novelist P.G. Wodehouse,
were burned by boys at the school after the writer agreed to
broadcast for the Germans during World War II.
   The writer was captured by the Germans in France in 1940 and held
in Germany. His broadcasts caused a scandal in Britain and after the
war he settled in the United States. He died in 1975.

<TEXT>
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, taking a first-hand look
at inner city problems, said today he was ``committed to a vigorous
effort to expand the housing stock, both public and private.''
   Kemp told a meeting of black Atlanta leaders arranged by Coretta
Scott King, ``There are fiscal restraints I am going to be
considerate of...but we're going to make a difference.''
   Mrs. King, widow of the slain civil rights leader Martin Luther
King Jr., said, ``From everything we've heard you say, we think you
mean business. If something happens and there is not a
follow-through, you're going to have a lot of disappointed people.''
   Kemp said he hoped to expand affordable housing for low-income
people through both federal projects and incentives to encourage
private development.
   On Tuesday, Kemp offered tax incentives and enterprise zones to
fight ``distress and despair'' among the urban poor, but made no
promise to spend more on housing as he toured this city's poor
sections.
   ``Areas that were at one time redlined for despair need to be
greenlined for success,'' Kemp said Tuesday, referring to the
practice by lenders of refusing to grant housing loans in
neighborhoods they considered undesirable.
   Kemp was spending a second day today visiting Atlanta's poor
neighborhoods on what he said was the first in a series of visits to
troubled inner cities as the administration's new secretary of
Housing and Urban Development.
   He was led on his tour by the city's black Democratic leadership,
including Mayor Andrew Young and Rep. John Lewis on Tuesday, and
today was being shown more troubled areas by Coretta Scott King,
wife of the late Martin Luther King Jr. He also met with community
leaders and developers.
   ``We've had a national recovery, but folks have been left
behind,'' said the former pro football player, congressman and
unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate.
   ``There is distress and despair in many of those areas of the
economy that have been left behind, and that's where I definitely
want to focus my attention,'' he said.
   Kemp brought the leaders no pledges of more federal money for
permanent housing, which the nation's mayors have said is needed to
fight homelessness. But he said he would push for ``dramatic
incentives'' to attract business investment into inner cities, and
consider other innovative public and private inducements to bring
jobs and housing to blighted areas.
   He said he would seek enactment of specific tax incentives,
including breaks on capital gains, to create the urban enterprise
zones in troubled inner cities. The tax breaks would be contingent
on the businesses hiring people who otherwise would be on welfare
rolls.
   Congress has passed enterprise zone legislation, but without the
tax incentives. President Bush's 1990 budget proposal includes such
tax incentives.
   Some of the redeveloped projects Kemp visited were accomplished
with local versions of that _ abatements in property taxes.
   ``We've got to do it at the federal level because only the
federal government can provide dramatic incentives,'' he said.
   Kemp was warmly greeted and met bipartisan encouragement,
although several local leaders suggested there were needs that
exceeded the ability of enterprise zones.
   Eugene Bowens, president of Interfaith Inc., a church group, said
that around the country many 15- to 30-year agreements with owners
of existing subsidized rental housing are due to expire soon. As a
result, the units could no longer be available to low-income people.
   ``That is a big problem and it's going to be happening on my
watch,'' Kemp said, adding that he wants to find ways to
``reincentivize'' both taxes and housing.

<HEAD>Inventories, Sales Both Up in November</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business inventories rose 0.9 percent in
December, the biggest increase since October, and sales jumped 0.8
percent for the fastest gain since August, the government reported
today.
   The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and
backlots rose to a seasonally adjusted $760.6 billion, while sales
reached $508.2 billion.
   December's 0.9 percent boost in inventories followed a 0.4
percent increase in November. It was the 24th straight month in
which inventories had risen.
   The 0.8 percent increase in sales followed a 0.4 percent sales
rise for November, as the rates of increase for inventories and
sales closely tracked one another.
   The similar increases in December produced no change in the ratio
of inventories to sales, which stood at 1.50, meaning it would take
1.5 months to exhaust inventories at the December sales pace.
   If not accompanied by rising sales, increasing inventories can
signal economic weakness because they may lead manufacturers to
order production cuts and layoffs while they sell off reserve goods.
   December's sales gain was the biggest since a 1.3 percent
increase in October. It was pinned to a 2.4 percent increase at the
manufacturing level, which offset a 0.8 drop in sales by wholesalers
and a 0.1 drop in retail sales during the crucial holiday shopping
season.
   The government on Tuesday reported that retail sales in January
jumped a healthy 0.6 percent after the disappointing year-end
performance.
   December's increase in inventories was the biggest since a 1.1
percent jump in August. It was led by a 1.5 increase at the retail
level due to the year-end sales slowdown, while manufacturer
inventories climbed 0.7 percent and wholesale inventories rose 0.6
percent.

<TEXT>
   A New Jersey man sought in the stabbing
death of a 17-year-old boy and the abduction of a teen-age girl was
captured after his car rolled over following a 65-mile chase by
state police, authorities said today.
   Mike Ardila was arrested Tuesday evening, and treated for minor
injuries at Guadalupe County Hospital, police dispatcher Roberta
Parker said. He was held in the Guadalupe County Jail pending
extradition, said Prosecutor Richard Honig of Sussex County, N.J.
   Ardila, 19, was wanted on a warrant in the death of Anthony
Pompelio, of Sparta, N.J., over the weekend and the abduction of
Donna Shaban, 17, also of Sparta.
   New Mexico state police officers began chasing Ardila on
Interstate 40 near the Texas border, Parker said. Ardila ran through
a roadblock near Santa Rosa before his vehicle rolled over in the
town.
   Ardila apparently pushed Ms. Shaban out of the car in Groom,
Texas, 175 miles east of where Ardila was finally apprehended and
about 50 miles east of Amarillo, Honig said.
   Ms. Shaban, a Sparta High School cheerleader, was picked up by a
truck driver and taken to the sheriff in Carson County, Texas, Honig
said. She was cut in the leg by Ardila, but otherwise was fine.
   Honig credited an alert gas station attendant in Amarillo with
providing the information that led to Ardila's arrest. He said the
attendant notified officials that someone bought gas Tuesday night
with a credit card belonging to Richard Pompelio, the victim's
father.
   Pompelio was found dead Sunday at the home of Lance Monti, a
classmate of Pompelio and Ms. Shaban, police said. Ardila and
Pompelio had argued over Ms. Shaban during a party at Monti's home,
police said.
   He was stabbed seven times in the head and torso.
   Ardila faces charges in New Jersey of murder, kidnapping, auto
theft and illegal possession of a weapon, Honig said. No charges
were filed against Ardila in Texas.
   Honig said he did not know when the extradition hearing would
occur.

   Former President Carter, who protested the Soviet
Union's invasion of Afghanistan by keeping U.S. athletes out of the
1980 Olympics in Moscow, called the Soviet pullout a victory for
democracy.
   As the last Soviet troops left Afghanistan aboard military
transports Tuesday, Carter said in a prepared statement that the
Soviet occupation was wrong from the beginning.
   ``The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 was an
international tragedy,'' Carter said. ``The heroism of the Afghan
men and women who fought against foreign subjugation has forced
Soviet forces to withdraw in defeat.''
   The former president said the U.S. support given to the Afghan
rebels was vital to their success.
   ``I am proud of the support the United States gave from the
earliest day to those who offered their lives for freedom,'' Carter
said. ``We now hope that they and their fellow citizens can forge a
society based on peace, justice and democracy.''

   A murder investigation has been
launched in the death of a boy who allegedly was abducted and beaten
at the home of black activist Winnie Mandela, police announced today.
   Mrs. Mandela met for 80 minutes at a prison farm near Cape Town
with her husband, African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
She refused to disclose any details of their conservation when she
returned to Johannesburg with her daughter, Zindzi, later in the day.
   As she was driven away from Johannesburg's airport, police
stopped the mini-bus she was in and took into custody a young man
who had met her. Police said only that the man, whose name was not
disclosed, was needed for questioning. Mrs. Mandela raised no
objections, according to journalists who saw the incident.
   While the Mandelas were meeting at the prison farm, police
headquarters announced that the body of a boy found in Soweto last
month had been positively identified as Stompie Seipei. The boy, 14,
allegedly was abducted and beaten at Mrs. Mandela's house by young
men who have served as her unofficial bodyguards.
   Police said a murder investigation would be conducted because the
decomposed body appeared to have stab wounds in the neck. All people
who might be able to assist the investigation would be questioned,
police headquarters said without elaborating.
   Mandela's husband is serving a life sentence for planning
anti-government sabotage. He heads the outlawed African National
Congress.
   Mandela United is a soccer club whose young members have served
as Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards in Soweto, the black township outside
Johannesburg.
   Methodist Church officials and Soweto community leaders have
alleged that members of Mandela United abducted three young men and
Seipei from a church residence, then beat them.
   The three men, according to their attorney, have made statements
saying Mrs. Mandela was ``involved in the events'' on the night they
were allegedly abducted and taken to her home.
   Mrs. Mandela, an anti-apartheid activist in her own right, has
denied she was present. She said the soccer club took the four from
a Methodist Church residence to protect them from sexual abuse, a
charge church officials say is false.
   The African National Congress has called publicly for the
disbanding of Mandela United.
   Maj. Gen. Jaap Joubert, who heads the police investigation of the
case, said today that fingerprint experts had been able to identify
a body at a Soweto mortuary as Seipei. Earlier, Joubert has said the
body appeared to have two stab wounds in the neck.
   He said the body was found in a field in Soweto after police
received an anonymous phone call Jan. 6.
   A Johannesburg newspaper on Tuesday quoted an unidentified
witness as saying one of the young men living at Mrs. Mandela's home
had been hacked to death in Soweto on Monday.
   Police said they were investigating the possibility that a young
man found dead of multiple stab wounds may have been a Mandela
United member.
   The Star newspaper said the dead man was Maxwell Madondo, 19, who
had been staying at Mrs. Mandela's house.
   The Star quoted an unidentified youth as saying he saw a crowd of
youths attack Madondo with pick handles, then drag his body into a
house, where he was stoned.

   Police closed an avant-garde art exhibit today
after a newspaper received a letter saying bombs would be placed in
the gallery if the show continued.
   It was the second time the exhibit has been closed.
   Police and several organizers searched the China Art Gallery for
signs of a bomb. As of this afternoon, nothing had been found.
   The Beijing Daily received a letter Tuesday saying three bombs
would be planted in the gallery if the show was not shut. The letter
was composed with Chinese characters cut from a newspaper and pasted
on a piece of paper, organizers said.
   Organizers said they suspected an artist who was not picked to
take part in the show was behind the threat.
   ``It seems to be another kind of performance art,'' said one
organizer. ``We think the artist is trying to show art's
relationship with Chinese society.''
   Police closed the show the day it opened, Feb. 5, when a woman
shot her sculpture with a BB gun in defiance of a ban on performance
art. The artist and her boyfriend were detained for three days and
then released.
   Other artists also defied the ``action'' art ban by tossing
condoms and change on the floor and sitting on eggs.
   The show reopened Friday.
   Organizers said although they did not approve of the bomb threat,
they believed it could benefit modern art in China.
   ``Through this activity we will get much publicity,'' said one
organizer. ``At this stage in its development, Chinese modern art
needs all the publicity it can get.''
   The show is the largest avant-garde show in China's history,
filling five halls of the China Art Gallery with more than 250 works.
   Many of the works are controversial. Some, like a huge balloon
shaped as a breast, are explicitly sexual. Others, like a portrait
on graph paper of the late leader Mao Tse-tung _ are political.
   Other pieces, such as a dozen dead fish wrapped in plastic, are
just strange.
   For decades, art in China was controlled by the state, and works
that did not serve the Communist Party were not welcome. Recently
the state has allowed more freedom in art.

   A priest whose transfer sparked a sit-in
at a largely Polish Roman Catholic Church has been ordered back to
Poland, but a small group of dissenting parishioners vowed to stage
a hunger strike tonight.
   The Rev. Roman Palaszewski has been ordered by the head of the
Franciscan order in Krakow to return to Poland in an attempt to
defuse tensions at St. Michael's, a friar at the order's provincial
headquarters in Baltimore said Tuesday.
   The friar, an assistant to the Very Rev. Daniel Pietrzak, head of
the Franciscan province that includes St. Michael's, said the
telegram sent within the past two days was a ``last resort.''
   ``We're all free to do wrong,'' the friar, who declined to give
his name, said of Palaszewski. ``He obviously has a decision to
make.''
   Palaszewski has been in seclusion since about 100 dissident
pashioners, angered by his removal in December, began occupying the
church in shifts on Saturday. Neither church officials nor the
dissidents have revealed Palaszewski's whereabouts.
   But Halina Chmiel, one of the leaders of the dissidents, said
Palaszewski told her that he had received no telegram ordering him
back to Poland.
   Two members of the dissidents plan to start a hunger strike
tonight, she said.
   ``They said they will sacrifice their lives for the rest of the
parish,'' Chmiel said.
   The dissidents vow to remain in the church until Bridgeport
Bishop Edward Egan agrees to meet with them. They want Palaszewski,
who spent three years at St. Michael's as an associate pastor,
reassigned to their church and want the present pastor, the Rev.
John Bambol, removed.
   The dissidents claim Bambol engineered Palaszewski's removal
because he was too active in the Polish community. Some say they are
upset by Bambol's efforts to open up the parish, located in a
largely Hispanic section of Bridgeport, to other ethnic groups.
   Palaszewski's five-year contract was terminated late last year by
joint agreement between Franciscan officials in Baltimore and
Krakow, the friar in Baltimore said. He was asked to return
voluntarily to Poland at the time, but failed to comply, the friar
said.

<TEXT>
   Salman Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses'' is
filled with references to the Islamic faith founded by Mohammed.
   Moslems revere Mohammed as the prophet who brought Allah's
revelations in the Koran, the holy book of Islam.
   Three main characters in the book are Mahound, the prophet of a
city of sand called Jahilia and recipient of a revelation in which
satanic verses mingle with divine; an Indian movie star, Gibreel
Farishta; and Saladin Chamcha.
   As the book opens, Farishta and Chamcha are passengers on a
hijacked jetliner. The plane blows up. They fall clinging to each
other singing rival songs. Gibreel becomes the archangel Gabriel,
although Rushdie continues to call him Gibreel, and Chamcha the
devil.
   Locked into conflict, their identities blur.
   In one passage Gibreel sees God:
   ``Gibreel's vision of the Supreme Being was not abstract in the
least. He saw, sitting on the bed, a man of about the same age as
himself, of medium height, fairly heavily built, with
salt-and-pepper beard cropped close to the line of the jaw. What
struck him most was that the apparition was balding, seemed to
suffer from dandruff and wore glasses. This was not the Almighty he
had expected. `Who are you?' he asked with interest...
   ```Ooparvala,' the apparition answered. `The Fellow Upstairs.'
   ```How do I know you're not the other One,' Gibreel asked
craftily, `Neechayvala, the Guy from Underneath?'''
   Another passage is set in a brothel called The Curtain where
prostitutes adopt the names of some of Mohammed's 12 wives,
including Ayesha and Hafsah.
   ``It was during one of these playful sessions at the end of a
working day, when the girls were alone with their eunuchs and their
wine, that Baal heard the youngest talking about her client, the
grocer, Musa. `That one,' she said. `He's got a bee in his bonnet
about the Prophet's wives. He's so annoyed about them that he gets
excited just by mentioning their names. He tells me that I
personally am the spitting image of Ayesha herself, and she's His
Nib's favorite, as all are aware. So there'...
   ``When the news got around Jahilia that the whores of The Curtain
had each assumed the identity of one of Mahound's wives, the
clandestine excitement of the city's males was intense.''
   Charles Eaton, a British scholar and convert to Islam, told The
Guardian newspaper this is one of the most offensive passages to
Moslems _ the ``equivalent offense to presenting the Virgin Mary as
a whore.''
   ``Salman Rushdie, who was brought up in Islam, knows exactly
where to put the needle in,'' said Eaton, also known as Hasan
Abdul-Hakim. ``Western readers very often don't see this.''
   Another passage tells of the Persian scribe, Salman, who takes
dictation from the prophet, and begins to add his own inventions:
   ``Little things at first. If Mahound recited a verse in which God
was described as all-hearing, all-knowing, I would write, all
knowing, all-wise. Here's the point: Mahound did not notice the
alterations. So there I was, actually writing the Book, or
rewriting, anyway, polluting the word of God with my own profane
language. But, good heavens, if my poor words could not be
distinguished from the Revelation by God's own Messenger, then what
did that mean? What did that say about the quality of the divine
poetry? Look, I swear, I was shaken to my soul.
   ``It's one thing to be a smart bastard and have half-suspicions
about funny business, but it's quite another thing to find out that
you're right. Listen: I changed my life for that man. I left my
country, crossed the world, settled among people who thought me a
slimy foreign coward for saving their, who never appreciated what I,
but never mind that. The truth is that what I expected when I made
that first tiny change, all-wise instead of all-hearing _ what I
wanted _ was to read it back to the Prophet, and he'd say, What's
the matter with you, Salman, are you going deaf? And I'd say, Oops,
O God, bit of a slip, how could I, and correct myself. But it didn't
happen; and now I was writing the Revelation and nobody was
noticing, and I didn't have the courage to own up. I was scared
silly, I can tell you. Also: I was sadder than I have ever been...''

   ``Legs Diamond,'' the megabuck Peter Allen
musical that opened Dec. 26 to scathing reviews, will close Sunday,
the Broadway play's producers say.
   The play had $8 million in advance sales when it began previews
Oct. 18, and its investors had provided a $5 million bankroll. All
is lost, according to producer Arthur Rubin.
   Word-of-mouth about the play was negative from the beginning, and
the reviews found fault with every aspect of the show, a
fictionalized look at the Prohibition-era gangster.
   A dramatic increase in ticket sales could prolong the play's run,
a spokeswoman said, but chances of that happening are slim.

   St. Cloud (Minn.) Times on John Tower as defense secretary:
   The first vote on John Tower's nomination as secretary of defense
has been put on hold for two weeks while the FBI reviews new
allegations about his finances and excessive drinking.
   Tower has vowed to stick with the fight for Senate confirmation.
That's a mistake. He should withdraw and allow (President) Bush to
submit another nomination.
   Many of the allegations against Tower may well prove to be
unfounded. But there have been enough serious questions about his
character that it is doubtful that he could function effectively in
one of the nation's most vital Cabinet positions. ...
   Tower has not been convicted of any misdeeds. But questions about
his personal life and hints and allegations of conflicts of interest
have not subsided. If anything, they grow as time passes.
   The result is a dangerous void in one of the nation's most
important leadership roles. Even if he survives confirmation,
lingering doubts will impair his ability to lead for many months, at
best.

   The Milwaukee Journal on congressional pay raises:
   Congressional leaders, having taken a beating in the recent
pay-raise controversy, seem to have concluded that their present
method is doomed.
   Adopted 22 years ago, the plan was supposed to spare lawmakers
direct responsibility for setting their own pay. A bipartisan
commission would recommend salary increases, if deemed appropriate,
once every four years _ subject to paring by the president and
passive acceptance by Congress.
   As it turned out, however, lawmakers did not get credit for
letting someone else decide what their pay should be.
   Far from it. They were accused in various quarters of cowardice
and subterfuge for ``not having the guts'' to vote on their own
salaries. ...
   The Senate and House, working with the president, need to search
for an alternative.
   We believe the method Wisconsin uses is part of the answer.
Technically, at least, the lawmakers in Wisconsin do not give
themselves a raise. Voters have the opportunity to throw them out of
office before the salary increase takes effect.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on mob justice:
   What happened to a mugger who got caught in Brooklyn's close-knit
Williamsburg section ... tells us again that when people take the
law into their own hands ... the consequences may also be criminal.
   A man who held up another at knifepoint ... and slashed his face
when he resisted was chased by a crowd of some 50 people and beaten
unconscious.
   Should a mob, even well-motivated against crime, ... have meted
out this rough justice?
   This society long ago established the principle ... that it is
the function of the police to apprehend suspects and of the courts
to determine their guilt or innocence.
   That angry crowd ... should have grabbed him and held him for the
police. That, in sum, is what the rule of law is all about.

   The Arizona Republic, Phoenix, Ariz., on drug tests of nuclear
plant employees:
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is headed in the right
direction with its move toward a rule requiring random drug and
alcohol testing of employees at all U.S. nuclear power plants.
   Given the risks and the magnitude of mishaps, it is frightening
to think that workers at such critical jobs would not be closely
monitored, and certainly the monitoring should include regular
checks for evidence of substance abuse.
   Implementation of the proposed regulation, which would apply to
all utilities operating or building atomic power stations, hinges on
final approval by the NRC, which is expected to rule in about a
month, and official publication of the rule, which could take an
additional month.
   The possibility _ more likely a probability _ also exists of a
time-consuming legal challenge.
   The federal government's plans for random drug testing seldom go
unchallenged by civil libertarians, and that is fine, provided the
courts do not lose sight of the public safety.

   The Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette on affirmative action:
   Predictions that President Reagan's appointees to the U.S.
Supreme Court would undercut affirmative action proved partly
correct last month.
   In its ruling on a Richmond (Virginia) case, the court slightly
curtailed this discrimination remedy, and perhaps opened the door to
future assaults.
   The Richmond City Council had set aside 30 percent of all
municipal contracts for minority firms. ...
   The high court scuttled the Richmond law, decreeing that state
and local governments can't establish set-asides without first
proving past discrimination and their predecessors' responsibility
for it _ a tough task.
   Further, the city or state cannot establish quotas or goals.
   Writing for the majority, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor warned that
set-asides will be subject to ``strict scrutiny.''
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, in a biting dissent, ... said the
court is ``constitutionalizing its wishful thinking'' which assumes
that racial equality has been achieved in America.
   That's not so. Until it is, affirmative action will continue to
be unequal but necessary.

   An unusual winter deluge that left three people dead in Tennessee
and Kentucky raised the threat of more flooding from Indiana to
Texas today as hot southern air met cold northern air with dangerous
results.
   The relentless rain filled rivers to overflowing, closed roads
and forced the evacuation of a hospital. Although it brought relief
to drought-stricken areas of Tennessee and Texas, for many people it
was too much of a good thing.
   ``There have been very few floods people can remember worse than
this,'' Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., said Tuesday night as he
toured hard-hit sections not far from his home in Carthage.
   Wilson County, just east of Nashville, was drenched with nearly 6
inches of rain. One woman, 62-year-old Sophia Payer, drowned when
she ignored police warnings not to cross flooded U.S. Highway 231,
authorities said.
   The rainfall also caused a power outage in the county that forced
70 people to be evacuated from a hospital in Lebanon. Schools were
canceled and police reported 80 vehicles stalled on flooded roads.
   Thirty people in Cheatham County, northeast of Nashville, were
evacuated early today when the Harpeth River overflowed its banks
and flooded 10 homes, said Danny Newton, chief of operations for the
Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.
   Rivers overflowed in central and western Kentucky. Frankfort, the
state capital, was under a flood warning today as the Kentucky River
exceeded flood stage. The state Division of Disaster and Emergency
Services reported the river was at 31.79 feet at 8 a.m. and rising a
foot an hour. Flood stage is 31 feet.
   Residents were evacuated along the Green River and Little River,
and merchants in New Haven in central Kentucky continued sandbagging
the banks of the Rolling Fork of the Salt River.
   Schools were closed today in at least 16 counties plus Frankfort.
The Western Kentucky Parkway, a major east-west artery, was closed
between Leitchfield and Elizabethtown due to high water.
   Many other rivers in Kentucky, Tennessee and Indiana are expected
to flood later in the week as their water levels continue to rise.
   Flash flood watches were in effect early today from northeast
Texas to southern Ohio, ranging along a line that crossed through
Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and West Virginia.
   ``The ground is pretty well saturated,'' National Weather Service
meteorologist Bob Watson said in Paducah, Ky., which received more
than half a foot of rain between midnight Sunday and late Tuesday.
   A nun, Sister Robert Edlin of the Sisters of Loretto, was caught
in high water as she drove along Kentucky 605 about 30 miles
southeast of Louisville. Authorities said she was rescued as the
water reached the depth of her dashboard. She was treated at
hospital in Bardstown for minor hypothermia.
   Two people in Kentucky died Monday when their car went out of
control in heavy rain near the Indiana border.
   Forecasters in Tennessee said the downpour should end a drought
that has lingered for four years. Nashville's rainfall for the year
is approaching 9 inches, 3 above normal. The 4.19 inches it received
Tuesday marked the most rain in a 12-hour period during the past 10
years, weather officials said.
   In west Texas, the storm brought rain to areas that had seen few
drops since last August.
   In Western Mitchell County, east of Big Spring, there were
reports of up to 2{ inches of rain Tuesday night. Up to 1{ inches
was measured in the Garden City area between San Angelo and Midland.
   ``There are still some pretty fair chances of getting more
moisture,'' said Jim Boyd of the National Weather Service in San
Angelo, Texas, in predicting that the weather system would remain in
the area another 36 to 48 hours.
   Nonetheless, meteorologists said it wasn't enough to end a
drought that has plagued ranchers and caused dust storms.
   ``It's not going to be any better this spring,'' warned Barry
Lambert of the National Weather Service. ``Just wait until March
when the wind begins blowing.''
   Officials speculated Tuesday that the weather may have
contributed to Monday's crash of a helicopter ambulance near Tyler,
Texas. The pilot and two nurses died after the copter struck a power
line during a storm.
   The heavy rains were caused by the meeting of three weather
fronts _ one carrying warm, wet air northeast from Baja California,
one carrying warm tropical air north from the Gulf of Mexico and one
keeping a band of cold air in place across much of the north-central
portions of the United States.
   ``It's more typical of an early spring situation,'' said Dan
McCarthy, meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Severe
Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City, Mo.
   Does that mean spring will be early? ``It doesn't mean anything
like that,'' he said.
   In fact, McCarthy said, another frigid blast of arctic air is
heading south and should lower temperatures in the northern Plains
to highs of around zero by the weekend.

   The Miami Herald on Bush's address to Congress:
   The tone was kindler and gentler, but the underlying economic
message of President Bush's budget address to Congress (Feb. 9) was
the familiar supply-side voodoo.
   Those facts likely mean that the rhetoric between the White House
and the Capitol will be softer than in recent years, but the
prospect for stalemate is as strong as ever. ...
   The voodoo comes in the fact that ... Bush hopes to keep his
no-taxes pledge by simply projecting a whopping $80 billion growth
in Federal revenues from exisitng sources.
   Given the $150 billion deficit in foreign trade, the $100 billion
emergency in the savings and loan industry, the festering wound of
unpayable debts owed by Latin America to U.S. banks, and early signs
of creeping inflation, that projection looks wildly optimistic.

   The Meridian (Miss.) Star on higher taxes:
   House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.,
is a true Democrat. He wants higher taxes.
   Congressman Rostenkowski said Sunday that President Bush should
look to gasoline, tobacco and alcohol as possible vehicles for
higher taxation as Congress begins work on the government's 1989-90
budget. ...
   Never mind that the president, both in his 1988 campaign for
election and since taking office, has vowed that he will not go
along with new taxation.
   Never mind, either, that ... Bush already has presented the
Congress with a plan showing how the new budget can be funded
without new taxes. ...
   Despite the voter mandate, the Democratic Party's prescription
for government financing has not changed one iota. It is to
tax-and-tax, spend-and-spend. So far as it is concerned, there
apparently is no limit.

   The Hudson Dispatch, Union City, N.J., on FBI bungling of a
kidnap case:
   Somebody needs to say it: Irving Flax probably would be alive
today if it weren't for the FBI's handling of the (New Jersey) case.
   The kidnapped warehouse supervisor was alive when his wife paid a
$25,000 ransom late last month. Within four hours, the 58-year-old
was killed execution-style.
   (The FBI's) first mistake was failure to notify Paramus police of
the imminent pickup of the ransom money at a borough diner _ clearly
a dangerous situation, and the FBI obviously could have benefitted
from the help and expertise.
   After the pickup, FBI agents could have arrested the kidnapper.
Incredibly, they passed up the chance, then lost the car.
   The suspect in the case, John M. Martini Sr., was apprehended not
by the FBI, but by Fort Lee Police.
   Arrogantly, the FBI _ which could be called the Federal Bureau of
Ineptitude for its actions _ works in a vacuum, assuming a false
superiority and slighting local law enforcement agencies. ...
   FBI agents have bungled dangerous situations and heightened
potential danger to the public.

   The Joplin (Mo.) Globe on Bill White as National League president:
   It seems fitting the search committee that selected Bill White, a
black man, as the National League's next (president) was headed by
Peter O'Malley, owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
   For it was a former Dodgers official, Al Campanis, who stood the
game on its ear with his remark that blacks could never attain top
positions in baseball because they were unequipped for management.
   The decision to choose White ... should help silence the
criticism that baseball has refused to extend to minorities the
opportunities for top executive positions.
   Talent is the key to the selection. The owners didn't choose
someone as head of the National League just because he was black.
Rather, the choice was predicated on the ability of the man to
handle the high responsibility of the task. ...
   In short, Bill White fills the job description of National League
president nicely, thank you, and is what the game needs.

   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on wrestling as entertainment, not

   Professional wrestling, it turns out, is just an
``entertainment'' and not a dangerous sport at all. The admission
comes from no less than the World Wrestling Federation.
   Talk about a drop kick in the abdominal area.
   It's near impossible to believe. ... You mean those terrifying
choke holds, those vicious body slams, those flying body presses
launched from the top of the ropes are all just fun and games?
   Apparently. The WWF concedes as much in legislation it is
supporting in New Jersey in order to win exemption from regulations
that apply to boxing and other sports that can cause serious
physical injuries.
   It wants professional wrestling defined as ``an activity in which
participants struggle hand-in-hand primarily for the purpose of
providing entertainment to spectators rather than conducting a bona
fide athletic contest.''

   An explosion and fireball rocked an
exlosives plant early today, injuring seven people and damaging four
buildings in a blast felt 10 miles away, authorities said.
   ``I thought it was a little tremor,'' said Brendon Nichole, an
engineer at radio station KHON in Spanish Fork, about two miles from
the Trojan Corp. explosives plant at the mouth of Spanish Fork
Canyon.
   The explosion at 6:37 a.m. was felt as far away as Provo, about
10 miles to the north, and there were several reports of cracked
windows in Spanish Fork and Mapleton, said Utah County sheriff's
Sgt. Craig Turner.
   Witnesses described the blast as a ball of fire that melted the
snow on a mountainside.
   A bus carrying three workers was about 50 yards away when the
blast occurred, Turner said. Those three workers and four others
either outside or in nearby buildings were injured. All the injuries
were minor.
   Five people were treated at Mountain View Hospital in Payson,
said Pam White, hospital public relations coordinator.
   The sheriff's office reported the fire under control shortly
before 8 a.m., but people were not allowed in the 100-acre plant
because of the potential for other explosions.
   Workers later secured the plant and chemists and engineers
planned to enter it and stabilize chemicals, Turner said.
   ``It may take quite some time,'' he said.
   The cause of the explosion, which occurred in an unoccupied
building where primers were manufactured, was not immediately known,
Turner said.
   The primers are replacements for dynamite and made of TNT and a
chemical called PETN, he said.
   Calls to the company were referred to plant managers, who
declined to comment.

   A senior Iranian cleric today offered up to $2.6
million for the slaying of Salman Rushdie, whose novel ``The Satanic
Verses'' has angered Moslem fundamentalists. Newspapers said the
writer was under armed guard.
   A representative of Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
said any Iranian who kills Rushdie will receive a reward of 200
million rials, or $2.6 million, for bringing ``this mercenary of
arrogance to his punishment,'' the Islamic Republic News Agency said
in a report from Tehran.
   The representative, Hojatoleslam Hassan Saneie, who heads the
Islamic charitable foundation 15th Khortad, said the group would pay
a foreigner $1 million for killing the 41-year-old author.
   Demonstrators in the Iranian capital broke windows at the British
Embassy, a diplomat there said. He said no embassy employees were
injured. About 2,000 people took part in the protest, expressing
support for Khomeini's decree and anger over the book.
   IRNA, in a report monitored in Cyprus, said the Revolutionary
Guards Corps today expressed their ``readiness to carry out the
Imam's (Khomeini's) decree.''
   Khomeini, leader of Iran's Islamic revolution, said Tuesday that
Rushdie's novel is so offensive to Islam that he had ordered the
author and the novel's publishers put to death.
   A senior British diplomat, reached at the embassy by telephone
from Cyprus, said today the ``noisy'' demonstrators paraded outside
the walled compound for three hours before dispersing. ``Local
authorities provided effective protection,'' said the diplomat, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said the demonstrators hurled stones at the building, breaking
some windows. He said all seven British employees were inside the
embassy at the time, and that none of them was hurt.
   Tehran Radio reported that Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
told diplomats in Tehran his government will order the closure of
cultural centers belonging to nations that permit publication of the
book.
   In London, police would not confirm a report in The Times of
London that Rushdie was under armed police guard. Scotland Yard said
it was police policy not to comment on matters of personal security.
   It is rare for British police to guard private citizens.
   A spokeswoman for Viking, publisher of the novel, said today it
could not confirm or deny that Rushdie, a London resident who was
born into a Moslem family in India, was under guard.
   Rushdie's agent, Gillon Aitken, said a decision would be made
soon on whether the author should go ahead with a promotional and
lecture tour of the United States. The tour had been scheduled to
begin Friday.
   In Pakistan, fundamentalist and opposition leaders called for a
peaceful ``day of mourning'' Friday to protest the book.
   Six people were killed and 82 injured when police opened fire
Sunday on demonstrators who stormed a U.S. cultural center in
Islamabad to demand the novel be banned in the United States, where
it recently went on sale. One person was killed in a similar protest
Monday in northern India.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' has sold more than 100,000 copies since it
was published in Britain in September to critical acclaim.
   At least five countries have formally banned the novel _ India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt and South Africa.
   Khomeini's threat emerged in a Tehran Radio broadcast that quoted
him as saying Rushdie and his publishers ``are hereby sentenced to
death.''
   ``I call on all zealous Moslems to execute them quickly, wherever
they find them, so that no one will dare to insult Islamic
sanctity,'' it quoted Khomeini as saying of the Bombay-born and
Cambridge-educated novelist.
   The Foreign Office on Tuesday expressed ``grave concern'' about
Khomeini's reported remarks. Rushdie said he was taking them ``very
seriously indeed.''
   The Daily Mail printed a picture that it said showed Rushdie and
his wife Marianne in London on Tuesday, but they could not be
contacted at home.
   Moslems revere Mohammed as the prophet who brought Allah's
revelations to mankind in the Koran, the holy book of Islam.
   They are especially angered by one sequence in ``The Satanic
Verses'' in which prostitutes are given the names of some of
Mohammed's nine wives and by the book's implication that Mohammed,
not Allah, may have been the real author of the Koran.

<HEAD>Court to Deliver Verdict in Bad Oil Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court will deliver a verdict May 20 after
nearly two years of trying 38 people charged with preparing or
selling oil blamed for the deaths of more than 700 people, an
attorney said Wednesday.
   Most of the rapeseed oil, made from the rape plant of the mustard
family, was imported from France and sold by itinerant merchants in
1981 in 1.3-gallon plastic jugs around Madrid.
   People were told it was cut-rate olive oil, but it was actually
rapeseed oil processed for industrial use, not human consumption.
   The trial began March 30, 1987, and arguments ended June 28,
1988. An estimated 23,000 people say they suffered lasting
impairments from consuming the oil.
   Prosecutor Eduardo Fungairino is asking for conviction of the
eight principal defendants on charges of involuntary manslaughter.
He is seeking convictions for the other 30 defendants charged with a
variety of fraud and public-health crimes.
   He also has asked for compensation of $120,000 for each of the
families of the dead.
   Defense attorneys say prosecutors have failed to show the oil
caused the deaths and impairments.

   Authorities have detained three people who
admitted that they killed a rhinoceros, an endangered species in
Nepal, and sold its horn for about $24,000.
   Conservation authorities still sought five other people allegedly
involved in the killing of the rhino in June in Royal Chitwan
National Park, 75 miles southwest of Katmandu, the news agency RSS
said Wednesday.
   The one-horned Asian rhinoceros is protected by Nepal law, and
its population has recovered to about 370, from 108 in 1967.
   Violators face up to three years in prison and fines of up to
$1,000.

   A man who admitted stealing a piece of
wreckage from the bombed Pan Am Flight 103 was fined about $265
Wednesday in Dumfries Sheriff's Court.
   Scott Thomson, 21, of nearby Ecclefechan, admitted taking a piece
of a landing gear disc, about 8 inches by 4 inches, from the main
highway past the town.
   The main part of the wreckage blasted a crater in Lockerbie after
the New York-bound plane exploded in flight on Dec. 21. All 259
people aboard the Boeing 747 were killed, as well as 11 residents of
the town.
   ``This was a mean and shameful offense,'' said Sheriff Kenneth
Barr, adding that if the theft had interfered with the
investigation, he would have imposed a long prison sentence.
   Three people are awaiting trial on similar charges.

   President Bush, hitting the road to drum up
support for his new budget proposal, pledged today to work with
Congress on spending cuts and said, ``We weren't sent to Washington
to sit on our hands.''
   Although members of Congress are pressing him for detail on where
he wants to make some $10 billion in proposed cuts, Bush deferred
that decision to future negotiations between his administration and
Capital Hill.
   And in a speech to a joint session of the South Carolina
Legislature that was interrupted by applause several times, Bush
said he has no intention of sitting by and allowing cuts to be made
across the board under provisions of the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law.
   ``I am prepared to work with the Congress to make those hard
choices,'' the president said. ``We weren't sent to Washington to
sit on our hands, either to pass the cost of indecision on to
working Americans by raising their taxes, or to fail to reduce the
deficit, which will cause the cuts to be done automatically under
the law.''
   Bush boasted that no one had termed his budget proposal that he
delivered last week to Congress ``DOA'' or dead on arrival. Leaders
of the Democratic-controlled Congress often used that term to
describe the budgets that former President Reagan submitted in the
latter years of his administration.
   If anyone wants to use the term ``DOA'' now, Bush said, he has
his own interpretation of the acronym _ ``defining opportunity for
Americans.''
   The president said his budget analysts have figured that with no
new taxes, the government will take in an extra $80 billion in
revenues just due to economic growth.
   That figure is more conservative, he said, than the projection of
the Congressional Budget Office, which he quoted at $86 billion.
   Whichever number is used, Bush said, ``that's enough money to
reduce the deficit down to the levels required by
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings and to spend more money on priority programs.''
   The president had lunch at the residence of Republican Gov.
Carroll Campbell, a longtime friend and political backer, before his
flight back to Washington in early afternoon.
   Bush and chief of staff John Sununu sat at the ends of an oblong
table at the luncheon, attended by about 15 people.
   For the second of his out-of-town budget speeches, Bush chose
another state that played a major role in his election victory last
year, after visiting New Hampshire on Monday.
   Bush won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary last
March 5. That victory, which followed his win in New Hampshire,
catapulted him toward the near-sweep of the Super Tuesday primaries
and caucuses on March 8.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that
Bush was not attempting, in his out-of-town trips, to circumvent
Congress and put pressure on Washington's lawmakers to support his
budget policies _ as Reagan often had done.
   Bush has come under criticism among some Democratic quarters on
Capitol Hill, with some lawmakers complaining that his proposed
budget allows him to claim credit for proposing more spending on
social problems while making sure that Congress shares
responsibility for coming up with unpopular cuts in other programs.
   Fitzwater acknowledged that the administration has not offered a
separate proposal for filling a $9.6 billion to $11 billion gap in
the amount of money available to finance Bush's spending initiatives
in areas such as help for the homeless, education and child care.
   Bush generally has called for freezing most domestic programs at
1989 levels. That would leave the $9.6 billion to $11 billion
financing gap in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 if the programs
are merely allowed to keep pace with inflation and population growth.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, and Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., head of the
Senate Budget Committee, told Bush in a letter Tuesday that if he
failed to provide more detail on areas that will need to be cut,
Congress would ``have no alternative'' but to assume that he
endorses the reductions that Reagan proposed last month.
   Bush budget director Richard Darman, talking to reporters after a
meeting Tuesday with congressional budget leaders, said the
administration was making ``an extraordinary effort'' to achieve a
budget consensus with Congress.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said the White House appeared cooperative. He said he
hoped the administration would, in meetings scheduled later this
week, provide Congress with more information.
   Sununu, the White House chief of staff, said: ``It's not a
question as to whether the detail is available. It's a question of
whether you do it a step at a time.''

   A judge Wednesday ordered a man's car seized
to punish him for abandoning his dog on the roadside.
   Judge Giorgio Cabrini ruled the car of Ermanno Minghetti should
be seized because it was used to commit a crime. He was acting on a
complaint from an animal protection society.
   Minghetti, 49, denied the charge, saying he drove his dog out of

   ``Rain Man,'' the story of a
scheming car salesman learning to love his autistic brother, topped
nominations for the 61st Academy Awards today with honors in eight
categories, including best picture.
   The movie also received nominations for Dustin Hoffman as best
actor and best director for Barry Levinson. It was the sixth
nomination of Hoffman's career.
   Earning seven nominations each were ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' a
drama hinging on the bed-hopping seductions of the wealthy in
pre-revolutionary France, and ``Mississippi Burning,'' the
controversial depiction of the FBI's investigation of the slaying of
three civil rights workers in 1964.
   Both were nominated for best picture, as were ``The Accidental
Tourist,'' an adaptation of Anne Tyler's acclaimed novel tracing the
emotional journeys of a travel writer, and ``Working Girl,'' a
Cinderella tale of a secretary who battles her way up the corporate
ladder.
   Sigourney Weaver claimed a rare Oscar double nomination, for best
actress for ``Gorillas In The Mist: The Adventure of Dian Fossey''
and best supporting actress for ``Working Girl.''
   The nominations were announced in a predawn news conference at
the headquarters of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
Oscar trophies will be presented March 29 at a 6 p.m. PST ceremony
broadcast on ABC-TV.
   Joining Weaver in the best actress competition were Glenn Close
for ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' Jodie Foster for ``The Accused,'' Meryl
Streep for ``A Cry In The Dark'' _ her eighth career nomination.
Melanie Griffith received her first Oscar nomination, for ``Working
Girl.''
   Their male counterparts, joining ``Rain Man's'' Hoffman were Gene
Hackman, for ``Mississippi Burning.'' He was joined by Oscar nominee
newcomers Tom Hanks for ``Big,'' Edward James Olmos for ``Stand And
Deliver,'' and veteran actor Max Von Sydow for Denmark's ``Pelle The
Conqueror.''
   Olmos, who portrays real-life high school math teacher Jaime
Escalante in the inspirational movie about barrio kids motivated to
become top calculus students, said a decade ago he was moving
furniture to support his family.
   ``It's beyond anybody's wildest dreams. I'm really thankful that
I'm here and representing a film like `Stand and Deliver,''' Olmos
said in an interview with ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   In addition to Levinson's nomination for ``Rain Man,'' best
director nominees included Charles Crichton for ``A Fish Called
Wanda,'' Alan Parker for ``Mississippi Burning,'' Mike Nichols for
``Working Girl,'' and Martin Scorsese for the controversial ``The
Last Temptation of Christ,'' attacked by some religious leaders as
blasphemous.
   Nominated for best supporting actress were Joan Cusack from
``Working Girl,'' Geena Davis for ``The Accidental Tourist,''
Frances McDormand for ``Mississippi Burning,'' Michelle Pfeiffer for
``Dangerous Liaisons,'' and ``Working Girl's'' Weaver.
   Veteran actor Alec Guinness, co-star of ``Little Dorrit,''
received a nomination for best supporting actor, as did Kevin Kline
for ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' Martin Landau for ``Tucker: The Man And
His Dream,'' River Phoenix for ``Running On Empty,'' and Dean
Stockwell for ``Married To The Mob.''
   Sir Alec Guinness said he was delighted to be nominated, but he
does not think he has a chance to win an Oscar for his role as
William Dorrit in Christine Edzard's six-hour adaptation of the
Charles Dickens novel. ``You have to be in a popular film. I think
`Little Dorrit' is splendid, but it's an art-house film.''
   ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' the inventive comic blend of
animation and live action, drew six nominations, but all of them for
technical achievements. ``Working Girl'' also collected six
nominiations, including best original song for Carly Simon's ``Let
The River Run.''
   Other multiple nominees included ``Gorillas In The Mist,'' with
five and ``The Accidental Tourist'' and ``Die Hard,'' with four
nominations.
   Among the films and performers attracting little or no attention
from the Academy were ``A Cry In The Dark,'' and ``Bull Durham,''
each collecting only one nomination.
   ``The Accidental Tourist's'' William Hurt, nominated the last
three years, was overlooked this year, as was Shirley MacLaine for
``Madame Sousatzka.''
   Also, there was no apparent backlash against ``Mississippi
Burning,'' widely criticized for rewriting the history of the civil
rights movement.
   Weaver becomes the fifth performer named in two acting categories
in the same year. Jessica Lange last performed the feat in 1982 with
``Frances'' and ``Tootsie.'' The others were Fay Bainter in 1938,
Teresa Wright in 1942, and Barry Fitzgerald in 1944.
   Nominated for best foreign language film were Hungary's
``Hanussen,'' Belgium's ``The Music Teacher,'' India's ``Salaam
Bombay!,'' Spain's ``Women on the Verge of A Nervous Breakdown,''
and Denmark's ``Pelle the Conqueror.''
   On Tuesday, a special achievement award was given to Richard
Williams, director of animation and creator of Roger, Jessica and
all the new characters in ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit.''
   An honorary Oscar also was given to the National Film Board of
Canada in recognition of the board's 50th anniversary and its
commitment to artistic, creative and technological excellence.
   The Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Science will present the winners at the Shrine Auditorium.
   A record 270 films were eligible this year, and more than 4,600
academy members were given ballots.

   Authorities closed the University of
Kinshasa and other schools in the capital Wednesday after two days
of clashes between police and students.
   The students have been protesting to demand a raise in their
monthly stipend of about $15. They also say they need more bus
service to get to classes.
   The official Zaire radio announced the closure and said the
schools would reopen March 1. It gave no other details.
   On Tuesday, students at the University of Kinshasa campus battled
police, and some officers were injured, witnesses said. About 20
people were arrested during the violence, which began Monday,
according to students who spoke on condition of anonymity.

   Traffic police donned surgical masks
Wednesday and mounted a protest demanding heavier fines for drivers
who violate anti-pollution rules.
   Traffic officials said the officers believe the fine of about $9
is too low to discourage private motorists from driving into the
congested historic center without authorization.
   Pollution blamed mainly on car exhaust is plaguing Florence and

   Vandals spray-painted anti-Semitic
slogans Wednesday on the Metropolitan Cathedral, a landmark in this
inland capital.
   Graffiti reading ``The CNBB is Jewish'' and ``The Amazon is ours,
Jewish ecologists get out'' were painted on a wall outside the
cathedral, designed by the prominent Brazilian architect Oscar
Niemeyer and opened in 1967.
   A spokesman for the CNBB, the Portuguese acronym for the
Brazilian Roman Catholic Bishops' Conference, called the graffiti
``absurd and ridiculous.''
   The Rev. Felix Neefjes said the church has good relations with
the estimated 150,000 Jews in this predominantly Roman Catholic
country of 144 million people.
   The Bishops' Conference often has spoken out against destruction
of the Amazon rain forest and the invasion of Indian lands by miners
and wood cutters.
   ``One can understand an attack on the CNBB, but it makes no sense
to link Jews with it,'' Neefjes said.

   A would-be burglar died while trying to break
into a restaurant when he tried to shimmy down the chimney, got
stuck and suffocated, police said.
   The man, as yet unidentified, was found Tuesday morning hanging
over a grill, with only his feet showing, at the Hamakom restaurant,
a Mideastern and Israeli restaurant in the Canarsie section of
Brooklyn.
   ``I came in just like always, switched on the lights and turned
around,'' said owner Victor Bar. ``I saw these feet sticking out of
the vent. It really scared the hell out of me.''
   The man climbed into the chimney feet first, with his hands up
over his head, but got stuck about 10 feet down, his progress
impeded by some fire extinguisher lines, said Detective James
Coleman.
   An autopsy report was not complete, but officials believe he was
asphyxiated because the narrowness of the passageway prevented his
chest from expanding.

   A lawyer has been fined $15,000 for drunken

   The penalty, which included a 21-day suspended jail sentence, was
levied Tuesday by an Oslo court under new rules pegging fines to
income. The unidentified 45-year-old lawyer earned about $190,000 a

   Edward James Olmos learned of his Oscar
nomination today over a cellular telephone, Dustin Hoffman heard his
name called out on television and Melanie Griffith and Martin Landau
were awakened by friends.
   Surprise and realization of a dream come true were common
reactions among Oscar contenders, particularly on the West Coast
where groggy wake-up calls rang in the good news moments after the
pre-dawn announcement.
   ``The phone started ringing. Actually, I was asleep. It's a
wonderful way to wake up, really an incredible way to wake up,''
said Landau, nominated for his supporting role in ``Tucker: The Man
and His Dream.''
   ``It's just terrific. I am very pleased. It's a dream. As a kid
in Brooklyn, I dreamed of this. I think everyone does,'' Landau said
from his Los Angeles home.
   Melanie Griffith didn't expect her ``Working Girl'' best actress
nomination and slept through the nationally televised Academy Award
announcement, said her publicist Elliot Mintz.
   ``We went out last night for dinner and I told her I was staying
up late to see the nominations come in. She said she didn't think
she would be nominated and went to bed,'' Mintz said.
   ``I called her this morning and she was completely overwhelmed
and surprised. She doesn't give me any indication whatsoever that
she thinks she will win the award,'' Mintz said.
   Miss Griffith, who disclosed this week she was pregnant, and
fiance-actor Don Johnson were in Miami.
   ``Don was fairly confident all along that she would be nominated.
He is Melanie's biggest booster,'' said Mintz, who also was in Miami.
   Tom Hanks wasn't available for reaction to his nomination for his
performance ``Big.'' Publicist Heidi Schaeffer said tersely: ``He's
not talking to anybody.''
   Dustin Hoffman, nominated for ``Rain Man,'' was more gracious.
Watching the announcement on TV, he expressed pleasure that director
Barry Levinson was nominated for the movie beset by difficulties.
   ``Thank you. I'm happy for Barry Levinson, the film and everybody
connected with it,'' he said from New York.
   The film had four directors and many script overhauls. In
addition, Hoffman almost quit in the first week of shooting.
   ``All through the filming, people would come up to me ... and
say, `This is definitely an Oscar film.' And I would say, `Please.
Not now. We'll worry about that later,''' said ``Rain Man'' producer
Mark Johnson.
   ``It really was charmed from the beginning. It was next to
impossible to put together,'' Johnson said. ``But there hasn't been
a stumble along the way. It has very much been a storybook kind of
film.''
   ``Miami Vice'' star Olmos was overwhelmed by his nomination for
his portrayal of inspirational math teacher Jaime Escalante in
``Stand and Deliver.'' He grinned as he heard his name over a
cellular phone.
   ``I can't believe it. I'm very happy right now. It's
extraordinary,'' Olmos said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``It's beyond anybody's wildest dreams. I'm really thankful that
I'm here and representing a film like `Stand and Deliver.'''

<HEAD>Sakharov Says He's Quitting Race for a Territorial Parliament Seat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human rights campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov said in
a letter published Wednesday he is withdrawing from the race for a
territorial seat in a new national legislature.
   Sakharov's letter, published in the weekly Moscow News, said he
would not accept nominations from territorial districts because he
believes he should represent the Academy of Sciences.
   The prestigious academy, where Sakharov works as a nuclear
physicist, last month rejected proposals to throw his hat in the
ring as its representative in the new 2,250-seat Congress of
People's Deputies. The 67-year-old dean of the Soviet human rights
movement was nominated to represent a Moscow district, but many of
his scientific colleagues wanted him to represent them in the new
congress.
   Sakharov, who won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, said he agreed.
   ``I feel that I am inseparably linked with the academy, of which
I have been a member 35 years,'' Sakharov wrote. ``I have come to
the conclusion that I should be a candidate namely of the academy in
the new elections or not be one at all. Therefore, I am taking the
decision not to run anywhere except the Academy of Sciences of the
U.S.S.R., withdrawing my consent to run from all territorial and
national-territorial districts which fielded my candidacy.''
   In a letter accompanying Sakharov's in Moscow News, space
scientist Roald Sagdeyev said he supports his colleague's decision
and hopes the academy leadership will reverse its decision and
``find a way'' to nominate Sakharov. Sagdeyev was also passed over
as an academy nominee.
   Sakharov is visiting Canada, where he has given conflicting
signals about whether he will continue to seek a Congress of
People's Deputies seat. On Sunday, he told reporters in Ottawa, ``I
don't reject the idea that I will still be a candidate in the
election.''
   More than 1,000 Academy of Sciences workers rallied Feb. 2 to
protest the organization's rejection of the candidacies of Sagdeyev,
Sakharov and several other prominent intellectuals. The protesters
charged that the academy leadership failed to listen to the popular
will in rejecting the nominations.

   ``Miami Vice'' star Don Johnson isn't ready to give
up on the NBC series that critics say has lost its zest after five
seasons.
   ``I have learned very definitely in this business, never say
never,'' Johnson told friends and co-workers at a gala Tuesday
night. ``This isn't goodbye. This is a celebration of 100 shows.
We'll see what happens after that.''
   The show remains popular enough in its home city that this week
was declared Miami Vice week. The crowning event was the party.
   Several hundred people gathered at the Biltmore Hotel in Coral
Gables to watch fireworks, meet the cast and crane their necks for
Johnson and fiancee Melanie Griffith, who on Wednesday was nominated
for a best-actress Oscar for her role in the film ``Working Girl.''
   Their publicist said earlier Tuesday that they are expecting a
child. The publicist, Elliott Mintz, said no marriage date has been

announce the engagement on Wednesday night's show.
   The former Miss South Dakota, who received six dozen roses during
the Valentine's Day show Tuesday, began her career as a Las Vegas
showgirl. In 1987, it was announced that her legs were insured by
Lloyd's of London for $2 million.
   Miss Hart has been a co-host of ``Entertainment Tonight'' for
more than six years.

   Executive producer Bonny Dore said she got the
idea for the script for the upcoming HBO satire ``Glory, Glory!''
when she worked for Oral Roberts and found a similarity between
religion and variety shows.
   In the Feb. 18 issue of TV Guide, Ms. Dore said her work eight
years ago helped inspire the musical about an outspoken woman,
Sister Ruth, played by Ellen Greene, and an evangelist, played by
Richard Thomas.
   The producer said she was working on the ``Barbara Mandrell and
Mandrell Sisters Show'' eight years ago when Roberts asked her
advice. He wanted her to apply her glitzy, Hollywood-style expertise
to his prime-time TV shows.
   ``A lot of stuff in the script is right out of those days,'' Ms.
Dore said. ``I was struck by how similar religion and variety shows
were.''

<HEAD>Memorial Caps Transformation of Panchen To National Hero</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Top government and Communist Party leaders paid
lavish tribute Wednesday to the late Panchen Lama, who used his
influence as Tibetan Buddhism's No. 2 leader to support Chinese rule
in Tibet.
   Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, Premier Li Peng and other
top officials stood with bowed heads in front of a portrait of the
Panchen Lama, capping the official transformation of him in death
into a national hero and symbol of ethnic unity.
   The Panchen Lama ``took a clear-cut stand of patriotism for
decades, particularly in the fight against the separatists on the
Tibetan issue,'' Vice President Wan Li said in eulogy to about 1,000
government and religious leaders at the Great Hall of the People.
   It is rare for a dead official, even one of high rank, to be
honored with such a lavish memorial at the Great Hall.
   The Panchen Lama died Jan. 28 at age 50 of a heart attack. He was
a vice chairman of the National People's Congress, China's
legislature, as well as the highest-ranking Tibetan Buddhist monk in
China. The Dalai Lama, the faith's top leader, has lived in exile in
India since a failed 1959 Tibetan revolt against China.
   ``His death means the loss of a great patriot and statesman to
our country, a devoted friend to our party and an outstanding
patriotic religious leader to the Tibetan people,'' the official
Xinhua News Agency quoted Wan as saying.
   The memorial, parts of which were shown on TV, was closed to
foreign reporters. Reporters also have been barred from attending
ongoing mourning services for the Panchen Lama in Tibet.
   Tibetan officials tightly restrict foreigners' access to Tibet
for fear they will witness demonstrations of anti-Chinese sentiment,
periodically reported by travelers.
   After nearly 40 years of Communist rule in Tibet, China remains
in tenuous control of the Tibetan people. Despite a heavy military
presence, revolts have broken out sporadically. Three large-scale
protests and many smaller ones have been held in the capital, Lhasa,
in the past 1{ years.
   Many Tibetans argue that they have their own language, culture
and religion and wish to be left alone.
   The Panchen Lama, by virtue of his religious role, was the only
Tibetan who supported Chinese rule and still held the respect of the
people. He was regarded as the 10th incarnation of the Buddhist god
Amitabha.
   His death leaves the government without a credible foil to the
Dalai Lama, who has sharply criticized the Chinese for human rights
abuses in Tibet.
   The only other Tibetan with a high post in the Chinese government
is Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, 78, also a congress vice chairman. He was
an aristocrat and official in the pre-Communist Tibetan government
who declared allegiance to the Chinese soon after their troops
entered Tibet in 1950. He has no strong following among Tibetans.
   Although he has opposed calls for Tibetan independence, the
Panchen Lama spoke out several times against what he considered
harsh treatment of his people. In one of his last speeches, he said
Tibetans had paid too high a price for their development under
Chinese rule, and that communist mistakes outnumbered their
successes in Tibet.
   The comments were reported in the official media at the time, but
have not been mentioned since his death. Instead, the Panchen Lama
has been turned into a symbol of loyalty to the Chinese motherland.
   The party newspaper, the People's Daily, carried a full-page
tribute to him Wednesday, referring to him as the ``great Panchen.''
   The government has indicated it will allow religious officials to
carry out the traditional method of selecting a new Panchen Lama by
identifying his reincarnation in a child. However, it has said the
choice must be approved by the government.
   Tibetan officials have refused to say if the process has begun.

<HEAD>Phone Harassment Complaint Dropped Against Reagan's Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Reagan, son of former President
Reagan, won't be prosecuted for making a threatening telephone call
to a photographer because he has apologized to the man, the city
attorney's office said Wednesday.
   A prosecutor dropped the misdemeanor telephone harassment case at
the recommendation of a hearing officer who listened to Reagan
apologize for leaving an obscenity-laced message on the answering
machine of Roger Sandler.
   ``In the hearing officer's opinion, the dispute was resolved at
the hearing,'' said Mike Qualls, spokesman for the city attorney's
office.
   Reagan was not available for comment, said his spokesman, Dale
Olson. He previously apologized for any embarrassment the incident
brought on his family.
   The complaint against Reagan, 43, the adopted son of Ronald
Reagan and his first wife, actress Jane Wyman, involved a dispute
over the use of two of Sandler's pictures in Reagan's 1988 book,
``On the Outside Looking In.''
   Sandler is seeking $1,500 for alleged copyright infringement
because he wasn't given credit and because he says he didn't give
permission for the photos to be published.
   In the Jan. 15 telephone message, Reagan threatened Sandler and
ended with the words: ``I hope your ... family dies in a plane crash
with you in it.''
   The prosecutor's office considered filing a misdemeanor charge of
making an annoying phone call, which carries up to a year in jail
and a $1,000 fine.
   The Feb. 7 session before hearing officer was conducted under
routine procedures intended to resolve minor cases without charges
or court hearings.

   More than 1,000 Central Americans formed a
half-mile-long line today outside a rural Immigration and
Naturalization Service detention center opened after the INS was
evicted from its offices.
   It was their first chance to file for political amnesty since the
INS processing center in Harlingen was closed Friday because of
alleged health and fire code violations.
   ``This tremendous line here represents a large number of Central
Americans flooding into the Rio Grande Valley, and we just can't
continue like this,'' said Omer G. Sewell, the INS district director
in Harlingen, while walking the length of the line of immigrants.
   INS officials at about 10 a.m. began moving the refugees on to
the grounds of the minimum-security Port Isabel detention center,
which holds 425 aliens, most of them awaiting deportation.
   ``I'm fleeing from military service,'' said Henry Torres, a
27-year-old Nicaraguan, as he waited in line. ``A communist country
is no good.''
   Torres was one of several hundred people who camped overnight
just outside the entrance to the detention center near the community
of Bayview, 25 miles southeast of Harlingen. By midmorning, hundreds
more had joined the line.
   Taxis, vans and cars carried many of the immigrants to the rural
center, avoiding some of the traffic congestion that had led to
complaints about the processing site at a former furniture store in
Harlingen.

<HEAD>Bush Says He and Congress Will Make `Hard Choices' on Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Wednesday his new
budget plan will force Congress and the White House to make ``hard
choices'' on spending cuts so that more money can be targeted for
social programs, the environment, educaton and the space program.
   But Bush, speaking to the South Carolina legislature, did not
offer any suggestions about where to reduce spending. Democrats
complain that Bush is taking credit for raising spending for
domestic programs while making Congress share responsibility for
unpopular cuts.
   Bush flew here as part of a series of appearances around the
country to extol the $1.16 trillion budget he unveiled last week.
The president will travel to St. Louis on Friday for a speech and
lunch with students at Washington University.
   The expanded social programs proposed in Bush's budget would have
to be offset by up to $11 billion in spending reductions to keep the
deficit down.
   Bush got a friendly reception from the Democratic-controlled
legislature. Speaking in the cavernous, white-brick House chamber,
the president said:
   ``I speak to you in the spirit of bipartisanship. I've got to _
you've got us outnumbered.''
   Bush made a pitch for his proposed reduction in the capital gains
tax to a maximum of 15 percent. Now, capital gains are taxed as
ordinary income.
   The president said that change would spur investment and produce
more tax revenues while, at the same time, making America more
competitive in international markets.
   ``All of our biggest trading partners, including Japan and West
Germany, tax long-term capital gains modestly if at all,'' Bush said.
   Pledging anew not to raise taxes, Bush said that reducing the
deficit means the government will have to make tough choices.
   ``My budget is a realistic plan that does more for education,
more for the environment and more for the space program,'' he said.
Moreover, he said it would increase spending for Head Start, the war
against drugs, child care and other social programs.
   Bush said that projected economic growth would result in up to
$80 billion in additional tax revenue.
   But spending more on ``priority programs,'' he said, would
require that savings be found elsewhere in the budget.
   ``And I am prepared to work with the Congress to make those hard
choices,'' Bush said.
   ``We weren't sent to Washington _ any of us up there _ to sit on
our hands, either to pass the cost of indecision onto working
Americans by raising their taxes or to fail to reduce the deficit,
which will cause the cuts to be done automatically under the law,''
the president said.
   Faced with a Congress controlled by Democrats, Bush said, ``I
will seek to work'' with the House and the Senate ``not as members
of competing political parties but as cooperating public servants.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush's budget
chief, Richard Darman, would meet during the day with congressional
staff people to discuss Bush's budget proposal.
   ``Details are being exchanged all the time,'' Fitzwater said.
``Darman goes up there with an armload of books and numbers so
there'll be detail.''
   Fitzwater acknowledged Tuesday that the administration had not
offered a separate proposal for filling a $9.6 billion to $11
billion gap in the amount of money available to finance Bush's
domestic spending initiatives.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, and Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., head of the
Senate Budget Committee, told Bush in a letter that if he failed to
provide more detail on areas that will need to be cut, Congress
would ``have no alternative'' but to assume that he endorses the
reductions that Reagan proposed last month.

<HEAD>Intel Unveils Super Processor Chip</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with company executive confirming that new
chip will be offered as basis for new line of computers, analyst commentl;
No pickup; A version also moving on the financial wire.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intel Corp. has developed a ``supercomputer on a
chip'' that will be offered as the basis for a new line of
high-speed computers, a senior Intel executive disclosed today.
   Intel's N-10 chip is the main source of excitement at the
Integrated Solid State Circuits Conference in New York, the biggest
research meeting of the year for the world semiconductor industry.
   Intel was not permitted to discuss the commercial uses of the new
chip in its technical presentation today. But in an interview
afterward, Intel senior vice president David House said the company
sees the N-10 as the basis for a major new line of computers.
   Some analysts had predicted the Intel chip would be offered only
as a helper chip to Intel's main microprocessors, such as the 80386
and forthcoming 80486 that are the brains of personal computers.
   But House said the chip also would be offered as the main
processor in engineering and graphics workstations and
multi-processing computers. Other companies, with Intel's help,
could build computers around the N-10, House said.
   An announcement of the availability of the N-10 is expected by
the end of the month, probably at a Feb. 27 news conference in San
Francisco.
   Analysts have said Intel's chip could be a fearsome competitor to
speedy processor chips from Sun Microsystems Inc., Motorola Inc. and
Mips Computer Systems Inc.
   Unlike those chips, Intel's chip can handle instructions that
have a ``word'' length of 64 bits, twice as long as the 32 bits used
in competing chips.
   The 64-bit word length is what entitles Intel to call the N-10 a
supercomputer on a chip, because mainframes and supercomputers also
use 64-bit words.
   ``This is the first microprocessor product, when it is formally
introduced, which will be a true mainframe computer,'' James I.
Magid, a senior adviser to the securities firm Needham &amp; Co., said
in an interview.
   ``The N-10 is a major event. It's had a lot of excitement built
up around it and it does appear to be the highest-performance
processor soon to be available,'' Michael Slater, editor of
Microprocessor Report newsletter, said Tuesday in advance of the
presentation.
   As a helper chip, the N-10 could handle the ``grunt work'' of
high-speed, repetitive calculations while a computer's main
processor handled more complex tasks, said Dean McCarron, a
microprocessor expert at In-Stat Inc. in Scottsdale, Ariz.
   It probably would take a personal computer equipped with the N-10
and Intel's forthcoming 80486 microprocessor a few seconds to
recalculate a long electronic spreadsheet, instead of the minute it
would take on today's fastest PCs, McCarron said.
   The N-10 is built with so-called Risc technology, for reduced
instruction set computing, so it could not be used as a replacement
for the microprocessors used in industry-standard personal computers.
   Until today, Intel's only public statement on the N-10 was a
brief abstract of its paper, in which it said the chip has a peak
speed of 150 million operations a second. That is five times faster
than Risc chips designed by Motorola and Japan's Fujitsu Ltd.
   Aside from the Intel chip, researchers also are expecting
announcements from Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.
of new generations of microprocessors, according to Mark Horowitz, a
Stanford University chip expert.

<HEAD>Kids Scramble For Hatchets On Washington's Birthday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHOL, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the 67th year, children in this little
town will celebrate George Washington's birthday with a hatchet hunt.
   The tradition is aimed at reminding youngsters of the ``little
lessons'' in the story of young Washington admitting to his father
that he chopped down the cherry tree, said Joseph Hawkins, director
of the local YMCA, said Wednesday.
   The hunt in this town of 10,000 sends about 300 youngsters
ranging from pre-schoolers to teen-agers scrambling through the
woods for two engraved hatchets and two dozen other prizes, such as
fishing tackle and portable radios.
   Finders get to keep the hatchets. The grand prizes are quite
capable of taking down a cherry tree, but no injuries have been
reported, and no one has suggested a break with the tradition,
Hawkins said.
   ``The parents have always gone along with it,'' he said. ``But of
course, after 67 years we now have a lot of the parents that took
part in the hunt when they were kids.''
   Hawkins said there have been instances when some participants
didn't take the lesson of honesty to heart.
   ``We've had some kids that tried to get into the woods early,''
said Hawkins. ``But the Fire Department monitors the situation and
when we find them we take the kids down to the police station where
they get a little talk warning them about doing those sort of
things.''
   The search is sponsored by the YMCA and the Fire Department.
Washington's birthday is celebrated on Monday.

<HEAD>Pilot From Taiwan Crashes in China, Requests Asylum</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Taiwanese fighter pilot whose jet crashed in
China has requested asylum from Beijing, and he denied reports he
was carrying military secrets.
   Lt. Col. Lin Xianshun told a news conference in Canton that he
wanted to be a pilot in the air force of the People's Liberation
Army.
   ``I am proud to be a Chinese,'' Lin said, appearing on Hong Kong
TV Wednesday night. ``I have studied the history and geography of
the motherland since grade school ... I think coming back is better
for myself.''
   The defection is the first since China announced in September it
would abolish rewards for defecting military personnel.
   Lin, 35, met with reporters from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan at
the Pearl River Guest House in Canton, capital of the southeastern
province of Guangdong.
   China's Air Force had held Lin incommunicado since Saturday when
the crash occurred in Fengshun county, about 180 miles north of
Canton.
   Lin parachuted to safety after his F-5E fighter ran out of oil in
heavy fog Saturday. He had flown from Chihhang Air Base in Taiwan.
   Lin, who suffered minor injuries from his jump, said he decided
about a month ago to defect to China because he wanted to return to
the ancestral home of his father's family, Meixian county in
northern Guangdong.
   Lin said planned his escape for the Spring Festival holidays
because he thought his fellow Air Force officers would not be at
their most vigilant.
   He said he did not believe that his family in Taiwan would suffer
because of his action and said he would like to call them from China.
   Lin denied reports in the Taiwanese press he had brought
Taiwanese military secrets to China. He said he only had things
``absolutely necessary for flying.''
   Lin declined to comment on a Taiwanese government statement he
suffered from an ``emotional imbalance'' due to problems with his
marriage. He denied a government report that he had sinus problems
which prevented him from flying.
   In Taiwan, the Defense Ministry said Lin flew to China because of
fears that he soon would be grounded permanently and because of
serious family problems.
   The statement said Lin had been expelled from the military and a
warrant issued for his arrest. It also said the commander of the
Chihhang Air Base and other responsible officers had either been
transferred or received other penalties. It said that Lin did not
carry confidential reports to China.
   Chinese reporters said air force officials have yet to decide
whether to allow Lin to join China's military.
   Reports on the defection have been muted in the Chinese press,
which usually employs such incidents as a propaganda tool against
Taiwan. The state-run TV news did not report on Lin's news
conference.
   More than a dozen Nationalist Air Force officers have sought
asylum in China since 1949 when the Nationalists fled to Taiwan
after losing a civil war to communist forces on the mainland.
   Military officials in Taiwan said 19 military personnel have
defected from China to Taiwan since 1949. All of the 19 defected in
planes, 13 flying to South Korea.
   Taiwan still offers rewards for Chinese military defectors, but
they reduced them when China stopped its rewards.

   President Bush's spokesman said Wednesday
there was nothing improper about Bush's brother, Prescott, trying to
drum up business in Asia for his consulting firm in advance of the
president's visit to the region next week.
   ``He's there as a private businessman,'' said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``No conflict in any way.''
   Calling the president's brother a ``very well respected
businessman,'' Fitzwater said Prescott Bush had received ``no
government help, government support, government contacts, government
aid in any way.''
   Fitzwater briefly discussed Prescott Bush's business trip while
the president was flying on Air Force One to South Carolina for a
speech.
   Prescott Bush is traveling through Japan, South Korea and China _
the same countries his brother will visit _ in search of business
for his consulting firm, the Washington Post reported.
   ``There is no conflict of interest,'' the Post quoted Prescott
Bush as saying in an interview. ``I have a very firm rule: I do not
do business with the United States government. I do not lobby the
United States government, and I do not ask anything of embassies or
commercial officers that is any different from what anyone else
gets. I don't need the U.S. government to do my business.''
   The elder Bush is seeking business for his four-year-old company,
Prescott Bush Resources, Ltd., which pursues real estate and other
development consulting and already is working on one project in
China, the Post said.
   Prescott Bush acknowledged that his reception in Asia has been
affected by the family tie, the Post said.
   It quoted him as saying that in Manila, President Corazon Aquino
invited him in for a chat and in Seoul, speaker Kim Chae Soon
requested a courtesy meeting. But the Post said Kim's aide, Lee Dong
Bok, recalled otherwise, saying Bush requested the meeting through a
third party.

   Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov promised his troops he would
be the last Soviet soldier to leave Afghanistan.
   He kept that promise Wednesday, crossing into the Soviet Union
over the Amu Darya bridge that links the Soviet Union to Afghanistan
at the city of Termez.
   His four years as commander of Soviet forces in the embattled
country earned him the title ``Hero of the Soviet Union'' and a
promotion to commander of the Kiev military district, the Tass news
agency said.
   The 45-year-old career soldier was met by his 14-year-old son,
Maxim, as he crossed over to Soviet soil, officially ending the
nine-year military engagement that turned into what President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev called a ``bleeding wound.''
   Gromov graduated with honors from the Kalinin Suvorov Military
School, the All-Arms Command in Leningrad and the Frunze Military
Academy before serving the first of three tours of duty in
Afghanistan, Tass said.
   ``In one of the battles, when rebels broke through to the command
post, he courageously drew regimental artillery fire on himself,
though he knew that the slightest inaccuracy could be fatal,'' Tass
said.
   Between his second and third Afghan tours, Gromov graduated in
1984 from the General Staff Academy. ``He submitted a report
requesting that he be sent back to Afghanistan,'' Tass said. ``He
was appointed commander there.''
   Gromov's wife died in a plane crash in 1985, and as he returned
to the Soviet Union, he said, ``My two sons are looking forward to
my return.''
   The general was given the title ``Hero of the Soviet Union'' for
leading an operation to unblock the Gardez-Khost highway in
Afghanistan.
   According to Tass, Gromov is well-liked by the men who served
under him and his troops were known to call him ``Dad'' on informal
occasions.
   On his arrival in Termez, he was greeted by army Gen. Valentin
Varennikov, who said, ``Boris served in Afghanistan three times. He
held different posts and distinguished himself as a man with a high
sense of duty, who works for the fulfillment of the tasks set with
minimum losses.''

<HEAD>Group Formed to Combat Telephone Marketing Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty trade associations, advocacy groups,
businesses and government agencies announced Wednesday that they
have formed a group to combat telephone marketing fraud.
   ``Don't believe offers that sound too good to be true,'' said
Linda Golodner, executive director of the National Consumers League,
one of the organizers of the Alliance Against Fraud in Telemarketing.
   John Baldwin, director of the Utah Division of Securities and
president of the North American Securities Administrators
Association, told a news conference announcing the formation of the
alliance that ``Americans lose $1 million an hour to investment
fraud promoted over the telephone.''
   Such an amount is equivalent to $8.8 billion a year. This would
be about a fifth of Baldwin's estimate of all fraud losses by small
investors.
   Many members of the new organization are involved with selling by
telephone, and one of them said con artists are giving legitimate
businesses a bad name.
   Richard Barton, senior vice president of the Direct Marketing
Assocaition, said that ``fraudulent telemarketers reach consumers
not only on the telephone, but also through the mail and
advertisement.''
   Ms. Golodner said the new group believes the most common scams by
telephone salespeople are prize offers to lure buyers of water
purifiers and vitamins, so-called ``penny'' stocks, office supplies,
magazine subscriptions, credit repair, precious metals, travel
arrangements, art, business ventures and cellular telephone lottery
applications.

<HEAD>Administration Modifying `Zero Tolerance' Seizures of Fishing Vessels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Discovery of small quantities of illegal drugs
will no longer be sufficient reason for federal agents to seize
commercial fishing vessels at sea, according to a change in the
government's ``zero tolerance'' policy.
   Coast Guard Adm. Paul Yost and Customs Service Commissioner
William von Raab are issuing interim guidelines, expected to be
announced Thursday, to conform with a congressional mandate that was
included in anti-drug legislation signed into law in November, Coast
Guard and Customs officials said.
   Under the policy that began last March, federal agents were free
to seize vessels within 12 miles of the U.S. coastline if any amount
of illegal drugs was found on board.
   Recreational boat owners were furious, complaining that they
could face the loss of millions of dollars worth of property if a
crew member or guest possessed a trace of marijuana without the boat
owner's knowledge. And commercial fishermen said they could lose
their livelihoods even if they were eventually found innocent and
their vessels were returned.
   Late last year, Congress narrowly approved ``zero tolerance''
modifications that would, in the words of Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska,
``prevent innocent owners of fishing vessels from being persecuted
by well-meaning but overexcited enforcement agents.''
   Congress instructed the executive branch to issue new regulations
within 60 days and then hold a 30-day public comment period. But the
Bush administration already is a month late, and Customs Service
officials said they do not expect formal regulations to be proposed
for at least several weeks.
   But Yost and von Raab, in a joint announcement set for Thursday,
are issuing interim rules for commercial fishing boats, said
officials from their agencies, commenting on condition of anonymity.
   Under the new rules, seizures of commercial fishing vessels in
operation or en route to or from fishery operations will be
prohibited if the amount of drugs found is ``personal use
quantities.'' That is generally described as less than one gram of
cocaine or heroin and less than one ounce of marijuana.
   Instead of being immediately seized and escorted to port to await
forfeiture proceedings by the Customs Service, fishing vessel
operators will be given a summons and ordered to appear before the
agency at the completion of the fishing trip. Customs officials then
will decide whether the vessel should be forfeited or if a penalty
should be imposed.
   The joint Customs-Coast Guard announcement also outlines
expedited administrative procedures for the forfeiture process,
setting a maximum 20-day period for a final decision.
   The announcement will not, however, detail other congressionally
mandated changes in the ``zero tolerance'' policy, including a
provision to protect innocent owners by ordering a vessel's release
if owners can prove drug offenses occurred without their knowledge,
consent or ``willful blindness.''

<HEAD>Lithuanians Celebrate Independence Anniversary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two days of celebrations marking the anniversary of
Lithuanian independence began Wednesday in the city of Kaunas,
despite demands by ethnic Russians the event be canceled, reform
movement sources said.
   According to the Lithuanian Information Center in New York,
15,000 ethnic Russians rallied in Lithuania's capital of Vilnius on
Sunday to protest the celebrations. They called for the removal of
the republic's government because of what they called ``nationalist
tendencies.''
   Speakers at the Sunday rally criticized the Lithuanian reform
movement Sajudis and denounced a government decree making Lithuanian
the republic's official language.
   ``Celebrations are starting now in Kaunas, where independence was
proclaimed on Feb. 16, 1918,'' Kazimeras Moteka, a member of the
Sajudis council, said in a telephone call from capital of Vilnius.
   Lithuania was a Russian province under the rule of the czars and
proclaimed its independence following the Bolshevik Revolution of
1917. But it was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940 under a
secret pact between the Kremlin and Germany.
   Alvydas Medalinskas, a spokesman for the movement, told the
Lithuanian Information Center the commemorative program would last
for two days and that the program was not changed because of
pressure from the Russian community.
   However, Medalinskas said, the Lithuanian government and
authorities in Moscow apparently had bowed to Russian pressure and
had scaled back planned TV coverage of the celebrations.
   Russians make up 10 percent of Lithuania's 3.7 million
population, the smallest Russian minority in the Baltic states of
Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.
   On Monday, about 100,000 mostly ethnic Russians rallied in
Vilnius protesting the language decree adopted earlier this year,
the Communist Party newspaper Pravda said.
   ``The protesters claimed that such a decree is a violation of
human rights of non-Lithuanian people living in the republic,''
Pravda said.

<TEXT>
   Wildlife agents and dozens of news organizations
waited in boats this morning for sea lions to return to a floating
trap that officials hope will keep migrating salmon and steelhead
from becoming sea lions' lunch.
   At least a dozen sea lions were basking in the floating cage when
wildlife agents, with reporters and photographers there to capture
the battle, launched their latest plan to stop the steelhead and
salmon suppers.
   But there were too many sea lions in the cage for National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administation agents to handle so the agents
yelled and slapped the water with paddles to scare them away.
   The sea lions stop at the Ballard Locks near the canal as they
migrate from Southern California and feast on steelhead, which are
rainbow trout headed back to their native streams and rivers in
western Washington to spawn after a few years at sea. The locks, a
gateway for fishing vessels as well as migrating salmon that are
also preyed on, connect saltwater Puget Sound with freshwater Lake
Washington and Lake Union.
   Officials launched ``Operation Goodbye,'' the sixth plan in five
years, in an effort to save the valuable fish runs. Agents hope to
move the sea lions from the sound to the Long Beach Peninsula some
250 miles away.
   ``This is our best opportunity so far,'' Hal Alabaster of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Tuesday.
   Wildlife officials hope to pull the door to the floating cage
shut today, then take the sea lions two at a time to a barge for
removal to a hangar at the Sandpoint Naval Base on the Lake
Washington shore, state Wildlife Department spokesman Bob Byrne said.
   There the sea lions will be tagged and equipped with radio
collars to monitor their travels after being dropped off 250 miles
to the southwest near Long Beach Peninsula, where the Columbia River
meets the Pacific, Alabaster said.
   ``We're confident this plan is going to work,'' he said. ``At the
very least it'll be a good test of how long it takes them to get
back. Some are guessing they'll beat the trucks back'' to Seattle.
   The sea lions are being tagged with colored streamers to tell if
any of the culprits returns to the locks.
   At stake is the run of 1,600 steelhead expected to approach the
locks by April, with the peak late this month or in early March. An
average of five sea lions a day has been camping in the ship canal
and near the locks, each eating a couple of steelhead daily to the
distress of fishermen who depend on the run, Byrne said.
   The ``war'' with the sea lions began about five years ago when
officials detonated noisemaking bombs to try to scare them away,
Alabaster said. But the bewhiskered diners quickly got used to the
underwater booms.
   Wildlife officials then tried playing tapes of the sounds made by
killer whales; the sea lions weren't fooled, the NOAA official said.
   Lithium fluoride, a chemical used to stop wolves from eating
sheep, was injected into some steelhead fed to sea lions. But the
seagoing predators didn't become nauseous as expected, Alabaster
said.
   Officials turned to nets to capture the sea lions, but the
mammals simply eluded them. ``They were too smart,'' Alabaster said.
   A steel mesh barrier that would let fish through but block sea
lions also proved ineffective.
   After officials tried the nets, ``Some lumber company had a
reader board and they put up `Sea Lions 4, Government 0' or
something like that,'' Alabaster said. ``It was pretty embarassing.''

   The European Parliament on Wednesday
awarded its first Sakharov Prizes to jailed anti-apartheid activist
Nelson Mandela and Anatoly Marchenko, a Soviet dissident who died in
prison.
   Relatives represented the prize winners at the awards ceremony.
Both prizes carry $5,600 cash awards.
   Larissa Bogoraz, Marchenko's widow and a human rights activist
who spent three years in Siberian exile, accepted the prize for her
husband. She said she was proud the prize had been named after
another Soviet dissident, Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei Sakharov.
   Mrs. Bogoraz said she hoped other Sakharov Prize winners would
have a fate ``less tragic than those of Nelson Mandela and even more
the tragic fate of my dead husband.''
   Marchenko died in a Soviet prison in 1986 after spending more
than 20 years in jail. He was a member of a group that tried to
ensure that Moscow respected the Helsinki human rights accords. His
book, ``My Testimony,'' described life in Soviet labor camps and
prisons.
   Mandela Sizwe Dalibhunya Mandela, 14, who lives in Swaziland,
accepted the prize on behalf of his grandfather.
   ``I hope that I will be allowed to visit him on my return to
South Africa to describe this ceremony and hand over this silver
medal, this scroll and check to him personally,'' the teen-ager
said. He said he hopes to visit his grandfather this week.
   Nelson Mandela, a founder of the African National Congress, the
chief guerrilla group fighting to overthrow the South African
government and end apartheid, has been jailed since 1962.

   Two skiers were killed and a third was
injured when they were caught in an avalanche in an off-limits area
near Telluride ski area, authorities said today.
   The victims of the avalanche, which occurred Tuesday, were
identified as Anthony Shelly, 25, of Telluride, and Paul Wolfert,
whose age and hometown were not immediately available.
   A third skier, Todd Richards, 23, of Telluride, was in good
condition today at Montrose Memorial Hospital, hospital spokesman
Jerry Cooper said.
   San Miguel County Sheriff Bill Masters said the three were skiing
in a narrow passage in a back bowl outside the ski area when the
avalanche hit.
   The area had been roped off and clearly marked as off-limits to
skiers, and Masters said the men would have had to cross the ropes
to enter the area.
   Authorities learned of the avalanche after they were summoned to
the area by skiers in a nearby back bowl who heard Richards shouting
for help.
   Masters said sheriff's deputies used a specially trained dog to
find the victims.

   Scientists say they have determined the
three-dimensional structure of an enzyme the AIDS virus needs to
spread its infection, a step that could lead to new AIDS drugs.
   An enzyme is a protein that initiates or speeds up a chemical
reaction. The findings, published in Thursday's issue of the British
journal Nature, are the first report on the three-dimensional
structure of any protein of the virus.
   The discovery will help researchers develop drugs to block the
enzyme and keep the AIDS virus from spreading, said Manuel Navia,
who with eight other scientists from the Merck Sharp and Dohme
Research Laboratories in Rahway, N.J., and West Point., Pa.,
reported the findings.
   ``It's pretty dramatic,'' said AIDS researcher Jay Levy of the
University of California at San Francisco.
   William Haseltine of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston
called the finding ``an important and critical step along the
pathway to rational, anti-AIDS drug development.''
   The enzyme, which looks like a tangled string in the general
shape of an angelfish, is called an aspartal protease, and it comes
into play as the AIDS virus makes copies of itself.
   To reproduce, the virus infects a cell and hijacks the cell's
protein-making machinery. It then orders the machinery to produce
proteins, including the aspartal protease, for assembling new
viruses.
   The proteins are manufactured in a string, like cars on a train.
But the proteins, which new viruses need to infect other cells, will
not work unless they are separated. The newly analyzed enzyme is
responsible for cutting the proteins apart.
   If a drug can be found to inhibit the enzyme's function, it could
stop the spread of infection, Navia said.
   Haseltine said such a drug should also keep an infected person
from being infectious to others. Researchers would have to make sure
that the drug would not block similar enzymes elsewhere in a
person's body, Levy said.
   As of Monday, the federal Centers for Disease Control had counted
a cumulative total of 86,157 AIDS cases in the nation, with 49,390
deaths.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coretta Scott King told new HUD Secretary Jack
Kemp on Wednesday he had raised expectations about the Bush
administration's commitment to easing urban problems and now must
deliver.
   Kemp, in his first duties as the new secretary of housing and
urban development, completed a high-visibility tour of Atlanta's
poor black neighborhoods and pledged to work to increase the
availability of afffor low-income people through
both public and private efforts.
   ``You have really raised our hopes and excited people about the
prospects of something happening with housordable housing ing and jobs,''
Mrs. King,
widow of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., told
Kemp.
   ``From what we've heard you say, we think you mean business,''
she said. ``If something happens and there is not the follow
through, you're going to have a lot of disappointed people.''
   Kemp met privately with Mrs. King and her sons, then attended a
meeting with black leaders.
   Kemp, an unsuccessful Republican presidential hopeful who has
sought to broaden the party's appeal to blacks, promised to work to
eliminate discrimination in housing, to support affirmative action
efforts and to encourage more housing for the poor.
   ``I'm commited to a vigorous effort to expand the housing stock,
both public and ot going to solve the problem,'' said Naim
Sheikh, the owner of a shop selling leather goods who called for a
law that would prevent such books from being written again.
   ``There must be some way that governments can approve a
resolution that in future no writer should have a right to write
against any prophet _ Mohammed, Jesus or Moses,'' he said.
   Moslems revere Mohammed as the prophet who brought Allah's
revelations to mankind in the Koran, the holy book of Islam.
   ``But do I personally agree with the ayatollah? It doesn't
matter,'' said Sheikh, one of the many Moslem Bangladeshis living in
the Brick Lane area.
   ``You can't stop the ayatollah. You can't stop the people who
will do the job ... Anyone who kills Rushdie will become a hero in
the Islamic world.''
   Like Sheikh, most Moslems acknowledged they haven't read the
book. Most learned about it at one of the five mosques located in a
one-square-mile area of this district, from leaflets, or from
television reports.
   ``He insulted our prophet, our religion. From TV we know this,''
said a shopkeeper selling sticky sweets who refused to give his name.
   Even though they haven't read the book, they are sure it insults
their prophet and are quick to say so when the novel is mentioned.
   ``Our older people read it, they say it's wrong, so we believe
them,'' Nassim Khan, a Pakistani Moslem, said as he ate lunch at a
modest tandoori restaurant. ``They've been studying for years and
years and they should know.''
   Maqbool Ali-Kassam, waiting for his takeout tea, boomed from
across the room: ``Anyone who denies the religion of Islam shall be
killed.''
   Ali-Kassam, a taxi cab radio controller who calls himself a
follower of the ayatollah, said he believes Rushdie deliberately
meant to insult Islam.
   Dozens of drivers from his company stayed at the office until
early Wednesday morning, he said, arguing about the book and the
execution order. ``Some said he didn't mean anything about Islam,
others wanted him killed.''
   Many Moslems believe Rushdie, 41, insults Mohammed by portraying
him as a character called Mahound, a prophet of a city called
Jahilia. Mahound was a medieval corruption of the word Mohammed.
   They are especially angered by one sequence in which prostitutes
are given the names of some of Mohammed's nine wives and by the
book's implication that Mohammed, not Allah, may have been the real
author of the Koran.
   Rushdie was born into a Moslem family in Bombay, India, and
educated in Cambridge. He lives in London. His novel has sold more
than 100,000 copies since it was published in Britain in September
to critical acclaim.
   ``Previously Mohammed has been criticized, but not in this naked
way,'' said Abul Khair, a top officer at the Sonali Bank,
Bangladesh's state bank, on Brick Lane. ``It is intolerable for
Moslems.''
   But he doesn't agree with the ayatollah. ``We don't want
violence. Islam is a peaceful religion,'' he said.
   Restaurant manager Asaad Ramjaun, a Mauritian immigrant, said of
Rushdie: ``I think he's the devil himself.''
   ``We understand this is a free society, but I think this is
freedom of abuse,'' he said. ``But since this is a free society _ he
shouldn't be killed. He should be given a chance.''

   Art didn't just imitate life at the North
Carolina Museum of Art, it hatched it _ in the form of 100 praying
mantises.
   An egg sac containing the insects hitched a ride into the museum
on one of the maple saplings that artist Patrick T. Dougherty used
in his sculpture ``Shelters of Transition.''
   The museum's warm, spring-like air prompted the pecan-size bundle
of eggs to begin hatching last weekend. The first of the half-inch
critters were noticed Friday by security guards.
   Anna Upchurch, a museum spokeswoman, said the saplings had been
fumigated in the parking lot for several days prior to the
sculpture's installation, which began in mid-January. The exhibit
runs through March 26.
   But apparently the eggs survived the chemical warfare.
   The bugs posed no danger to other artwork because they eat other
insects, not canvas or plaster, she said.
   ``There is nothing for them to eat in the museum except each
other,'' Ms. Upchurch said. Praying mantises are sometimes
cannibalistic.
   As more hatched over the weekend, they were sucked into a vacuum
cleaner and released outside.

   The fashion statement of shorts over
longjohns has been silenced, at least for the moment, at Syracuse
Junior High School.
   The shorts just got too short, Principal James Schmidt said
Wednesday. They are allowed under school policy, if of a proper
length and type.
   ``They were wearing thermal underwear in a way you can call
extreme,'' Schmidt said.
   The principal said he believes the students tested the school
policy on shorts by pushing them to extremes of brevity. The

something out that is reasonable.
   ``We're not going to stop thermals. It's just the extremes I'm

   Former Rep. Joseph DioGuardi, R-N.Y., has
returned more than $50,000 in disputed campaign contributions to
employees of a New Rochelle, N.Y., auto dealership, a spokesman for
the ex-congressman said Wednesday.
   ``The contributions in question all came in December 1987, and
all those were returned,'' said Kieran Mahoney, DioGuardi's former
administrative assistant who now is a consultant and lobbyist.
DioGuardi was defeated last year by Democrat Nita Lowey.
   According to DioGuardi's year-end campaign finance report, filed
with the Federal Election Commission, People for DioGuardi returned
$39,000 in mid-December to present and former employees of Crabtree
Automotive.
   Mahoney said these were the last of the disputed contributions.
   ``In our previous report, we also listed contribution refunds to
a number of people. I don't have my files in front of me but it
totals in excess of $50,000,'' he said Wednesday.
   DioGuardi, reached at his Westchester County home, referred all
questions to Mahoney.
   DioGuardi lost the election after Gannett Westchester Newspapers
reported that employees of Crabtree Automotive had been reimbursed
for giving money to DioGuardi's campaign. Such reimbursement is a
violation of federal election law.
   Dealership owner Joseph Crabtree had been on DioGuardi's
executive campaign finance committee and quit the post after the
published report. He maintained the supposed reimbursement checks
were Christmas bonuses.

   Crippen was struck on the head by a five-inch limb of a falling
tree Tuesday, according to officials at Bradford Hospital, where the
logger was first taken.
   Fire Chief Cliff Hastings said it took rescuers nearly four hours
to get Crippen to Bradford, about 15 miles from a densely wooded
mountain ridge.
   About 50 volunteer firefighters, paramedics and other volunteers
took turns carrying the injured man on a stretcher 1\ miles to a
clearing at the base of the ridge, where Dr. Glenn Irwin and
paramedics were waiting, Hastings said.
   Others carried bottled oxygen to Crippen, running in relays from
a command post on the logging trail.
   Irwin, medical director for advanced life support services at
Bradford Hospital, said he performed a procedure, similar to a
tracheotomy, that involved cutting a hole in the man's throat to
open a passage in his windpipe.
   The doctor worked on the back of a pickup with instruments he
brought from the hospital. The operation took place at the end of a
dirt logging trail.
   ``It was not the kind of thing we do every day, but given the
transport time involved, we elected to do it in the field,'' Irwin
said.
   Officials said it was impossible to get a car or truck any closer
to the scene of the accident.
   ``It was very rough going. They had to hand-carry him over very
rocky terrain,'' Hastings said. ``You could just feel the tension
all over the place. It dazes you. You almost blank everything out,
there's so much stress and strain.''

<HEAD>More Americans Dying in Nursing Homes as Hospitals Cut Costs</HEAD>
<HEAD>For Release at 6 p.m. EST</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

   The percentage of elderly Americans dying in
nursing homes rose sharply during the 1980s as hospitals began
discharging terminally ill patients to save money, a new study
concludes.
   The report largely attributed the change to Medicare rules that
encourage hospitals to release elderly patients as quickly as
possible.
   However, it said that other cost-cutting pressures, including the
rise of health maintenance organizations, may also have contributed.
   Dr. Mark A. Sager, who directed the study, said that sending
dying people to nursing homes rather than keeping them in hospitals
is not necessarily a bad trend.
   ``It may be very appropriate and less costly,'' he said in an
interview. ``The issue is whether nursing homes can adequately take
care of a sicker population today than they were seeing a few years
ago.''
   However, Sager said there is no sign that quicker hospital
discharges have shortened these people's lives.
   Medicare's new payment system began in 1983. Instead of covering
patients' actual expenses, the program pays hospitals flat fees in
advance for each patient. Hospitals get the same amount for each
patient with a specific disease, regardless of whether the patient
stays in the hospital for a day or a month.
   Meanwhile, another report showed Medicare expenditures have risen
less sharply than experts predicted a decade ago.
   A study directed by Dr. Louise B. Russell of Rutgers University
estimated the Medicare payment program will be responsible for a 3
percent reduction in the nation's total health care bill, which is
expected to be $650 billion in 1990.
   In 1980, the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the branch of the
government that actually pays Medicare bills, predicted it would be
spending about $55 billion by 1990. Instead, it appears the actual
expense by then will be $43 billion in 1980 dollars, the study said.
The savings will amount to $18 billion in 1990 dollars.
   Both studies were published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   Sager's study found that in 1981, 65 percent of all deaths among
people over 65 occured in hospitals. By 1985, this had fallen to 61
percent. At the same time, the proportion of deaths occurring in
nursing homes rose from 19 percent to 21.5 percent.
   ``What has to be said is that hospitals are in a bind because
they are being pressured by cost cutting,'' said Sager, a physician
at Dean Medical Center in Madison, Wis. ``Nursing homes are in a
bind because nobody wants to pay for nursing home care. Patients are
in a bind because they are in a system that does not want to provide
continuity of care and health care financing is fragmented.''
   His study found that in 1983-84, 35 states showed significant
declines in hospital deaths, while 33 reported increases in nursing
home deaths. In New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Maryland _
states that did not initially participate in the new payment system
_ there was no change in where people died.
   His work also found that the changes were most pronounced in the
Midwest, South and West. He could not entirely explain this
difference but said some of it might have resulted from the heavy
concentration of HMOs in these regions.
   HMOs try to minimize hospital stays because members pay flat
rates for comprehensive care.

   Three men were killed and 11 other people were
wounded by gunfire in a 5{-hour period in the nation's capital,
police reported today.
   The deaths bring the District of Columbia's homicide toll so far
this year to 74, compared with 46 at the same point in 1988. The
city registered a record 372 homicides last year, most of them
drug-related.
   The shootings occurred between 6:30 p.m. and midnight _ almost
all of them in the southeast area of the city, said Officer Walter
Ferguson, a police spokesman. Nineteen people initially were
reported as wounded, but authorities later revised the figure down
to 11.
   Two men were shot to death while sitting in a car in an alley
near Capitol Hill, Ferguson said. They were identified as Anthony
Bailey and Derrick Bell, both 25 and of suburban Capital Heights, Md.
   Darnell Wells, 26, of Capital Heights, was shot to death near one
of the city's most notorious open-air drug markets and three other
men were wounded, Ferguson said. He said police confiscated a
shotgun, a machine gun, nine handguns and a quantity of cocaine at
the scene.

   A gunman opened fire in an office building
today, killing three people and wounding one before killing himself,
Montgomery County police said.
   Police Capt. Richard Williams said the man emerged from an
elevator and opened fire. After killing three people, he turned his
gun on himself, Williams said.
   The shootings occurred at the credit card department offices of
Chevy Chase Federal Savings Bank in this Washington, D.C., suburb.
   The gunman appeared to be a ``disgruntled employee,'' according
to another police spokesman, Officer George Luddington.
   The identities of the victims were not known immediately.
   Hillary Murphy, spokeswoman for Suburban Hospital, said a
30-year-old man was listed in critical condition with a gunshot
wound to the face.
   Alex Chapin, of Atlanta, who was on the telephone with a bank
employee when the shootings occurred, told WUSA, a Washington
television station:
   ``I heard the gun shots and I heard a woman screaming in the
background and I heard a guy say `I'm hit, I'm hit' and another
person say `quick, get some towels'.
   ``I hear a banging at the door and ... I heard somebody say,
`don't let him in, don`t let him in.' And then ... I hear another
scream and I hear another shot and I'm like, `Oh my God, what is
going on up there?'
   ``Out of horror, I'm sitting here listening to the phone, cause I
don't know if it's a hostage situation going on or what. And I
waited and waited and waited until I heard the police sirens, so I
figure somebody's on the scene at that point. Then I heard somebody
say something, `Why don't they come up here?' and that's when I
heard some more shooting and then the phone went dead.''

<HEAD>ADA Blasts Budget-FTC Agreement on Rental of Cars with Unrepaired
Defects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A public interest group on Wednesday sharply
criticized a proposed consent agreement between Budget Rent-A-Car
and the Federal Trade Commission that would allow Budget to rent
cars with unrepaired safety defects.
   ``The FTC-Budget solution is dumb, dangerous and potentially
disastrous,'' said Ann Brown, chairwoman of the consumer affairs
committee of Americans for Democratic Action.
   Under the proposed agreement announced Dec. 28, Budget could
choose to ignore manufacturer safety defect recall campaigns by
posting a disclaimer indicating that the affected vehicle is
``subject to a recall notice and has not been inspected or
repaired.''
   William MacLeod, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer
Protection, said the circumstances which gave rise to the consent
agreement dated back several years and have since been rectified.
   ``There is a procedure in place at Budget whereby these things
(safety defects) are repaired. The cars are in fact repaired
according to the recall notices,'' he said.
   Commenting on the ADA committee's statement, MacLeod said, ``it
sounds to me like they are making a controversy out of whole cloth.''
   At Budget Rent-A-Car headquarters in Chicago, spokeswoman Jody
Wilson said the company had no immediate comment on the ADA panel's
criticism of the consent agreement. She cited a press release issued
Dec. 30 by Budget, saying ``we have always provided our customers
with safe, reliable cars.''
   Ms. Brown told a news conference that ``sometimes consumer
information and even clear disclaimers provide no useful consumer
protection. This is one of the clearest examples.''
   ``When a car is known to be unsafe _ it simply shouldn't be on
the road _ no amount of nebulous warnings will protect a car renter
from a dangerous, life-threatening defect,'' she said.
   In comments submitted to the FTC, the ADA panel said it
``strongly opposes giving Budget Rent-A-Car or any other auto rental
firm an option to ignore safety recalls. It offers great risk to
customers that is not outweighed by the relatively minimal cost
savings.''
   Fred B. Goldberg, an attorney who prepared the ADA statement,
said the organization hopes that the FTC will vote to reject the
proposed consent agreement after a public comment period ends March
6.
   He noted that Budget's rental fleet includes, for example, the
1988 Buick Regal, for which five recalls were issued last year.
   ``The defects include potential disengagement of the steering
column, undesired resumption of cruise control, loss of braking
capacity, unexpected opening of the car's hood _ each of which poses
a clear safety threat,'' Goldberg said.

<HEAD>FDA Asks Doctors to Warn Contact Lens Patients About Homemade Solutions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday
it is asking eye doctors to warn their contact lens patients that
improper use of homemade salt solutions can lead to damaged vision
and even blindness.
   The FDA said the solutions are not sterile and can become
contaminated with microorganisms that can cause serious and painful
eye infections.
   Homemade salt solutions, prepared by dissolving salt tablets or
capsules in water, can be used safely in heat disinfection of
contact lenses or just before heat disinfection because the high
temperature kills any germs that might be in the solution. The salt
itself, however, does not kill any germs.
   If a contaminated solution is used after disinfection,
microorganisms can enter the eye and cause serious infections, the
FDA said.
   Homemade solutions also should not be used with chemical
disinfection of lenses because while the chemical solution kills
most microorganisms that cause eye infections it does not eliminate
a particularly harmful orgamism called Acanthamoeba.
   Acanthamoeba infections, which can cause severe eye damage and
can result in blindness, are rare but the FDA said their incidence
appears to be increasing. Since 1984, about 200 Acanthamoeba
infections have been reported, about 90 percent of them in contact
lens wearers.
   The FDA said that if homemade salt solutions are used, the
solution should be prepared fresh daily and discarded after use and
the solution bottle should be sterilized in boiling water for 10
minutes at least once a week.

<HEAD>Calif. Appears Ready To Move Up Presidential Primary Date</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tired of being a wallflower in
presidential nomination politics, California appears ready to move
up its primary to make it one of the nation's earliest, a step that
could jolt the selection process.
   ``It would be probably one of the most significant changes in the
texture of the nominating process in the last several decades,''
Mike McCurry, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee,
said earlier this month.
   ``It would probably confine the field of likely candidates to
those that are well financed and able to put together substantial
state organizing drives.''
   Delegate-rich California, with more than 13 million registered
voters and five major TV markets, requires several million dollars
even for a minimal statewide campaign effort.
   Various proposals would schedule the state's presidential primary
on the third Tuesday in February, the first Tuesday in March or in
April.
   If the February or March proposals had been in effect last year,
California's primary would have come immediately after the Iowa
caucuses and New Hampshire primary and would have overshadowed those
races, traditionally the kickoff points for presidential campaigns,
one lawmaker said.
   New Hampshire has a law mandating that it always be the first
primary. Iowa caucuses, in which party activists pick committed
delegates, have in the last four elections preceded the New
Hampshire primary by about two weeks.
   ``If you're a candidate running for president do you want to be
trudging around in the snow (in Iowa or New Hampshire) or do you
want to be in California?'' asks Assemblyman Mike Roos, co-author of
one early primary bill.
   California holds one of the latest primary elections in the
nation _ on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in June _ and
its voters have not had a real impact in determining a presidential
nominee since 1972, even though the state sends the largest blocs of
delegates to the Republican and Democratic conventions.
   In recent years, the nominations of both major parties have been
locked up or virtually locked up by June.
   Critics grumble that the late primary has allowed candidates to
tap the state for campaign donations but ignore issues of particular
concern to Californians, such as offshore oil drilling, until after
the conventions.
   Putting California near the top of the schedule would reverse
that situation and help the state's economy by increasing campaign
spending here, supporters of a change say.
   ``The result is that all of the candidates would spend a lot more
time in California actively campaigning,'' said Assembly Minority
Leader Ross Johnson, author of a February primary bill.
   The Legislature has rejected several previous attempts to move up
the election date, but backers have been picking up influential
support.
   Gov. George Deukmejian, once an opponent of early primary
legislation, endorsed the idea in January, and the Legislature's top
leaders have all given the concept at least lukewarm support.
   ``There is a growing realization across the board that California
ought to play a greater role in the candidate selection process,''
said Johnson. ``It does not make sense for New Hampshire and Iowa to
have the disproportionate influence they do.''

<HEAD>Scientist Says Mayhaw Being Rediscovered As Possible Cash Crop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Can some of those fancy, expensive imported
fruits hold a candle to the down-home mayhaw?
   ``The mayhaw is a good ol' Southern crop that's been around for a
long time,'' says Jerry A. Payne, an Agriculture Department
scientist. ``Because of its tart flavor, it makes one of the best
jellies in the world. It's just now being rediscovered as a possible
cash crop from North Carolina to Texas.''
   Mayhaws grow wild in the acid soils of swamps and shallow ponds
and are about the size and color of ripe cherry tomatoes. They grow
on thorny trees that can get as high as 25 feet.
   Payne, who is with the department's Agricultural Research Service
in Byron, Ga., said in a report issued here Wednesday that mayhaws
may be catching on for a good reason: fruit sells for $5 to $8 a
gallon and the jelly for $8.50 per pint.
   Farmers and homeowners interested in planting mayhaw trees should
find them widely available in the next few years, he said. Related
to hawthorns, they can live 50 years or longer and remain
productive. Some varieties, once established, can withstand subzero
temperatures without damage.

<HEAD>Investigate Killing of Teen Allegedly Held at Mandela Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police began an investigation
Wednesday into the death of a 14-year-old whose body was found early
last month after he allegedly was beaten at the home of
anti-apartheid activist Winnie Mandela.
   Police and community leaders say the youth, Stompie Seipei, led a
``children's army'' of 1,500 black children in the Tumahole township
of the Orange Free State and became a legend in the racial unrest of
1984-87. He was jailed under emergency rules at age 10, the youngest
of the thousands detained, and held for 11 months.
   Mrs. Mandela had an 80-minute meeting Wednesday at a prison farm
near Cape Town with her husband, African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela.
   When she returned, police stopped her van on the highway and
impounded it. Mrs. Mandela, her daughter and granddaughter hitched a
ride with a journalist to her home in Soweto, the huge black
township outside Johannesburg.
   Police took a young man accompanying them into custody but
released him later.
   Capt. R.H.V. Bloomberg said the van was ``impounded for
examination, for investigation in connection the murder'' of Seipei,
whose decomposed body was identified in a police morgue Wednesday
through fingerprints.
   Mrs. Mandela made no comment about the meeting with her husband
or the controversy that has surrounded her since three men told a
community meeting in Soweto last month about the alleged abduction.
   She said she did not know why police took the van and the man,
who met her at the airport and was not identified. Mrs. Mandela told
a police officer: ``We don't want any trouble.''
   The men said they and Seipei were abducted Dec. 29 and taken to
Mrs. Mandela's home. They said the boy was beaten more severely and
was taken away after a few days.
   Their attorney said Mrs. Mandela was involved in the events.
   She has denied being home at the time and said the three men and
Stompie Seipei were taken from a Methodist Church residence in
January to protect them from sexual abuse. The church denied the
charge.
   According to the three men, the abductions and beatings were
carried out by members of the group known as the Mandela United
soccer team. Mrs. Mandela formed the group in 1986 and its members
act as her bodyguards.
   Police said the boy's body was found Jan. 6 in an open field in
Soweto after they received an anonymous telephone call. The body
remained in the morgue unidentified until police began investigating
the disappearance this week.
   Soweto community leaders said Seipei, like other young activists
from the years of revolt, decided to resume his education and went
to live in the house operated by the Methodist Church, from which he
and the others were abducted.
   A murder investigation will be conducted because there appear to
be stab wounds in the neck, police said. An official statement said,
without elaboration, that all people who might be able to assist the
investigation would be questioned.
   Mandela, who was convicted of plotting sabotage a quarter-century
ago and is serving a life sentence, was transferred to a staff house
at the Victor Verster prison farm in December after recuperating
from tuberculosis.
   The government has said Mrs. Mandela is free to live with him
there permanantly or have unlimited visits, but she has said she
would make her normal 40-minute monthly visits. The meeting
Wednesday was twice that long.
   Mandela has made no statements about the controversy. The African
National Congress, the main guerrilla group fighting white
domination in South Africa, has urged that Mandela United be
dismantled.
   Mrs. Mandela often is surrounded by Mandela United members, who
wear gold, green and black track suits, but they were not in
evidence at the airport Wednesday.
   On Sunday, Johannesburg's Star newspaper said Dr. Abu Baker
Asvat, a prominent anti-apartheid physician, saw Stompie Seipei at
the Mandela home after the boy had been beaten.
   Gunmen subsequently killed Asvat at his clinic in Soweto and
police are trying to determine whether the killing was linked to the
Mandela United controversy.
   Police said Wednesday a man found dead of stab wounds Tuesday
morning in Soweto was Maxwell Madondo, 19, who lived at Mrs.
Mandela's home. The Star quoted a witness as saying a crowd of young
men hacked Madondo to death.

   Business inventories rose 0.9 percent in
December and sales increased at almost the same pace despite a
buildup in stockpiles of unsold autos as car purchases lagged, the
Commerce Department said Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and
backlots rose to a seasonally adjusted $760.6 billion in December,
while sales reached $508.2 billion.
   December's 0.9 percent increase in inventories followed a 0.4
percent increase in November. Sales, meanwhile, rose 0.8 percent in
December following a 0.4 percent increase in November.
   Because the rates of increase for inventories and sales closely
tracked one another, there was no change in the ratio of inventories
to sales, which stood at 1.50, meaning it would take 1.5 months to
exhaust inventories at the December sales pace.
   If not accompanied by rising sales, rising inventories can signal
economic weakness because they may lead manufacturers to order
production cuts and layoffs while they sell off reserve goods.
   Robert DeFina, senior economist for Security Pacific National
Bank in Los Angeles, said the balance between sales and stockpiles
suggests most ``businesses are in a pretty comfortable position.''
   The auto industry was an exception, with stoent
says the war left 1 million Afghans dead and sent 5 million fleeing
into Iran and Pakistan.
   Moslem guerrillas are massed around Kabul, the capital, and
Western officials believe Afghan troops left behind will be defeated
soon. The divided guerrilla leadership has been meeting to try to
coordinate a strategy.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said in Washington the
Soviet pullout marks ``a long awaited day for the Afghan people and
they can now go on to determine their own future.''
   He said the United States would not be proposing any blueprints
for the future course of Afghanistan's government.
   ``This whole struggle has been about self determination,'' he
said. ``We'll continue to be supportive of the Afghan people as they
pursue this.''
   The United States ``has supported efforts to form a broadly based
government'' in Afghanistan, he said, but it would not tell the
Afghan people how to go about it. Redman said U.S. support for the
rebels continues.

<HEAD>Officials Hopeful That Mothballed N Reactor Might Get New Life Making
Tritium</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year after the government's N Reactor
was closed, backers are encouraged by a study suggesting the
plutonium-producing facility could find new life making a weapons
material whose stockpiles are dwindling.
   The government has been without a source of tritium, a rapidly
decaying gas used to increase the power of nuclear weapons, since
the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina shut down last summer for
safety reasons.
   That has raised hopes in the Richland area, hard-hit when the
Energy Department closed the N Reactor at its Hanford weapons
complex because of a plutonium surplus. That cost 1,800 jobs and
ultimately could cost 5,000.
   ``It's the newest of all the (defense) reactors and considerably
newer than the Savannah River reactors,'' Republican U.S. Rep. Sid
Morrison said Tuesday. ``This is an option and one we've worked to
keep alive.''
   Then-Energy Secretary John Herrington placed the N Reactor on
``cold standby'' on Feb. 16, 1988. The plant, which began operating
in 1963, had been shut down for more than a year for safety
improvements spurred by the reactor's similarity in design to the
Soviet Union's Chernobyl plant.
   However, a Department of Energy study released this week said the
N Reactor could be converted to make tritium within three years for
$125 million.
   The nation's supply of tritium is a closely guarded secret. The
Energy Department has proposed new tritium reactors in South
Carolina and Idaho, but they are a decade away from production. Some
lawmakers and the Pentagon have said the shortage threatens national
security.
   The Bush administration now must determine future tritium needs
and whether to restart the Savannah River plants before deciding
what to do with the N Reactor, said Morrison, whose district
includes the sprawling facility.
   Restarting it would be good news for the economically ravaged
cities of Richland, Kennewick and Pasco. The closure has cost 1,800
jobs, with 1,000 more to be lost when shutdown work concludes by
October, according to Westinghouse Hanford Co., which operates most
Hanford operations for the Energy Department.
   More important, the closing sounded the death knell for all 5,000
plutonium production jobs at Hanford by the 1990s. That's when the
stockpile of plutonium produced by the N Reactor for further
processing at Hanford will run out.
   The shutdown ``was the most disastrous thing that's ever hit this
area,'' said Sam Volpentest, director for the Tri-City Industrial
Development Council's Hanford division, which lobbies Congress for
new projects at the 560-square-mile site.
   Much of the economic impact of the shutdown has been delayed by
an early retirement and voluntary layoff program and by the decision
of many workers to seek jobs elsewhere. Many reactor workers filled
other vacancies on the site.
   Employees are now removing the 1,003 nuclear fuel rods, a job
that should be completed by the end of March.
   Problems began for the N Reactor shortly after the 1986 Chernobyl
disaster that killed a reported 31 people and spread radiation
around the world. Much was made of the N Reactor's design
similarities, including graphite in the reactor core and the lack of
a containment dome.
   The N Reactor was shut down in January 1987 for $100 million in
safety improvements. That touched off a political battle over its
restart.
   But the issue became moot with Herrington's announcement that the
nation had ample plutonium and no longer needed the N Reactor.
   Hanford officials all along disputed the Chernobyl comparisons,
and Wallace Ruff, manager of the defense reactor division, said the
improvements have made an already safe reactor safer. The work
included pressure tests on the containment system and improvements
to the emergency cooling and seismic systems.
   Recent risk assessments on the N Reactor show it to be comparable
to commercial reactors, Ruff said, even though Energy Department
plants are not subject to Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards.

   Anti-apartheid church leaders
Wednesday urged some of the 300 detainees on a hunger strike to
suspend the fast while efforts are made to resolve the crisis.
   The detainees, some of whom have not eaten since Jan. 23, are
demanding they be released or put on trial. Twenty-one have been
hospitalized, and church leaders said they were worried about the
health of the men.
   ``We urge the detainees, particularly those already in the danger
zone, to suspend their action while church leaders, lawyers,
community leaders and the public seek ways of resolving the
problem,'' the Rev. Frank Chikane told a news conference in
Johannesburg.
   Chikane, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Rev. Allan Boesak
planned to discuss the hunger strike Thursday in Cape Town with the
minister of law and order, Adriaan Vlok.
   Vlok has said the government cannot be ``blackmailed'' by the
estimated 1,000 people in detention, but 17 men were released
Tuesday, including two who were participating in the strike.
   Chikane said the church leaders were asking only those detainees
who were sick or who had been fasting most of the 23 days to resume
eating.
   ``We are concerned that their health could be permanently
damaged,'' said Chikane, leader of the South African Council of
Churches, which represents most major Protestant denominations.
   ``We are encouraged that Minister Vlok is willing to address the
situation of emergency detainees as a matter of urgency,'' Chikane
said.
   But he added, ``If he does not respond positively he will create
a serious problem.''
   The strike began at Diepkloof Prison outside Johannesburg on Jan.
23 and has spread to several cities around the country. Some of the
participants have been held without charge since the nationwide
state of emergency was declared in June 1986.
   Lawyers said Wednesday that an undetermined number of the 111
detainees at Westville Prison in Durban had joined the hunger strike
and that detainees at a nearby prison in Pietermaritzburg will stop
eating Monday.
   Student leaders at five South African universities began a hunger
strike Wednesday in solidarity with the detainees. They said it
would last eight days.
   ``We support the detainees' demand to be charged or released,''
the group said in a statement. ``We see their demand as a response
to the intransigence of a government intent on criminalizing the
voice of the majority of South Africans.''
   At the University of the Western Cape outside Cape Town, about
2,000 students participated in a rally calling for the release of
the hunger strikers.
   In another development Wednesday, an inquest began into the 1985
killings of black teacher and activist Matthew Goniwe and three
colleagues.
   Goniwe's associates contend the four were assassinated because of
their involvement in the anti-apartheid movement. No suspects have
been arrested.
   Goniwe and Fort Calata, Sparrow Mkhonto and Sicelo Mhlawuli
vanished on June 27, 1985, after starting back to their hometown of
Cradock from a meeting in Port Elizabeth of the United Democratic
Front, an anti-apartheid coalition to which they belonged.
   Their burned-our car was found near Port Elizabeth the next day.
Their bodies, burned and stabbed, were discovered during a five-day
search.

   The government Wednesday thanked the
Soviet Union for its help in Afghanistan but said future relations
should develop on the basis of non-interference in each other's
internal affairs.
   The last Soviet soldiers who had been fighting Moslem guerrillas
left Afghan soil earlier in the day, meeting the U.N.-mediated
deadline set by an accord signed in April.
   ``The government of the republic of Afghanistan, on behalf of the
entire people of the country, expresses its appreciation to the
people and the government of the Soviet Union for their all-sided
assistance and continued solidarity in the cause of defending
Afghanistan's national sovereignty, political independence and
territorial integrity,'' the government said.
   It accused the United States and Pakistan of ``virtually
trampling'' on the Geneva agreements that paved the way for the
withdrawal of the Soviet soldiers, who entered the country in
December 1979.
   The statement said the United States and Pakistan shraply
increased their support for the guerrillas since the accord was
signed in April.
   It said the government of President Najib was confident relations
with the Soviet Union would develop on the basis of ``friendship,
mutually beneficial good neighborliness, equal sovereignty and
non-interference in each other's internal affairs.''
   The statement also denounced the shura, or council, being held in
Pakistan by the guerrillas, who have predicted Najib's government
will fall within weeks of the Soviet withdrawal. The shura is to
coordinate their plans for a postwar government.
   ``Pakistan has been making futile efforts of late to forge
various Afghan opposition groups into a so-called shura and a
transitional government on the territory of Pakistan by exerting
enormous pressure on them ... Such hostile and expansionist schemes
which are aimed at infringing upon the independence of Afghanistan
are resolutely rejected and condemned by the people and the
government,'' it said.
   Residents of the besieged capital said they hoped the completion
of the withdrawal would lead to peace after 10 years of civil war.
   ``The Russians are gone,'' said a merchant in the city's old
bazaar who identified himself as Hasan. ``Now there will be peace,''
he said as he tried to sell one of the few Soviet fur hats left in
the shopping district.
   ``We are brothers,'' another merchant said, referring to the
Moslem guerrillas outside the capital. ``We can solve our problems
without foreigners. The problems are just between Afghans. We don't
need help from foreigners,'' said the jewelry seller, who gave only
his first name, Ghulam.
   The pullout from Kabul was completed Tuesday night when about 80
Red Army troops at the city's airport filed two-by-two onto four
military transport planes that took them home.

   Moslem guerrilla leaders presented a
plan for an interim government in Afghanistan and said Wednesday
they would take control of their country swiftly now that Soviet
forces have gone.
   Delegates to a special council chanted ``Death to the Russians!''
and ``God is great!'' as their leaders declared that the Kremlin had
suffered a devastating and humiliating defeat.
   The last Red Army soldiers left Afghanistan on Wednesday after
nine years of involvement in the civil war that cost the Soviets
about 15,000 dead and 35,000 wounded.
   ``It was the power of the faith, the steadfastness and
determination of the Afghan Moslem nation that forced the Russians
to leave our nation,'' guerrilla leader Rasul Sayyaf told a news
conference.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in 1978
and, before the withdrawal began last May under a U.N.-mediated
agreement, faced an estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers as well as the
Afghan army.
   Sayyaf said a plan for an interim government was presented to the
council, or shura, of about 400 delegates and would be debated for
several days before a vote was taken.
   It calls for approval of a provisional government the guerrillas
created last summer with Ahmed Shah as prime minister, but some
cabinet appointments announced previously are expected to be changed.
   Leaders of the seven parties in the insurgent alliance based in
Pakistan have been deeply divided for years, competing for power and
influence. Ahmed Shah leads one of the parties.
   Wednesday's session was the first full one since the shura
assembled Friday. It became deadlocked almost immediately and party
leaders wrangled over key issues in private.
   The council is seen as the best chance for the guerrillas to form
a united government that could take control and restore peace and
stability to Afghanistan after 11 years of war.
   Even with an interim government, top party leaders are expected
to retain ultimate control. Sayyaf said the seven leaders would
serve as an executive body for the temporary administration.
   Afghanistan's Marxist government said Wednesday the council's
decisions were meaningless. ``The decision of the so-called shura is
not important to the Afghan nation,'' said Kabul radio, monitored in
Islamabad.
   Guerrilla officials, speaking privately, said some council
delegates expressed opposition Wednesday to Ahmed Shah or said an
individual should be head of state rather than the collective
leadership.
   One of the seven parties, the Afghan National Liberation Front,
boycotted the council. Officials of the party said they would not
return until Shiite Moslem guerrillas based in Iran were included in
the council or shura.
   Front leader Sibghatullah Mojaddidi had offered the Shiites 100
seats in the council and seven cabinet posts. Leaders of the other
six parties rejected the plan.
   Most of the guerrillas based in Pakistan are Sunni Moslems, as
are 80 percent of Afghanistan's people. Shiites make up about 15
percent of the population.
   Sayyaf said the council had appointed a committee to deal with
the Shiite issue. He also said all parties would attend the council
Thursday, but aides to Mojaddidi said their party would stay out
until the question was resolved.
   Shiite representatives have said they will accept nothing less
than Mojaddidi's proposal.

   The new family on the block _ mom, dad, three
kids and a dog _ have settled into their Victorian mansion on
Massachusetts Avenue and already thrown a video slumber party to
break in the place.
   But even when you're master of the vice presidential digs, like
Dan Quayle, you find there are some things that don't change.
   Quayle, who moved his family into the vice president's official
residence a week ago, agreed to let his three children each have a
friend over for a slumber party Saturday night.
   Dad accompanied son Tucker, 14, to a local video store to pick
out the evening's entertainment. Quayle was instructed by his wife
Marilyn to ``supervise'' the selection process and to put a
two-video limit on Tucker, according to Quayle's press secretary,
David Beckwith.
   ``I guess I didn't do a very good job of supervising because he
got away with four,'' Quayle told Beckwith, adding that he stood in
line for 10 minutes to return them Sunday night.
   The comedy lineup included ``Moonstruck,'' ``Vice Versa,''
``Throw Momma From the Train,'' and ``Planes Trains and
Automobiles.''
   With the first slumber party behind them and the Quayle family
ensconced in their new home, there is remodeling yet to be done and
things to get used to _ like a staff of stewards.
   The remodeling plans are on hold pending a private fund-raising
effort being handled by a group of Quayle's friends. The work is to
include installing a bathroom for daughter Corinne since all three
children are sharing one bathroom now, redoing one upstairs bedroom
as a family room and reconfiguring the children's bedrooms on the
third floor.
   In addition, Mrs. Quayle wants a laundry room on the third floor
since she intends to do the children's laundry, according to a
spokeswoman.
   The stately three-story residence is situated on the sprawling
Naval Observatory grounds in Northwest Washington, near the British
Embassy and a tree-lined upscale residential neighborhood.
   President Bush lived there for eight years as vice president. But
while Bush and his wife Barbara often had a bevy of grandchildren
underfoot, with frequent visits by the five Bush offspring and their
families, none of the children lived with them.
   The 42-year-old Quayle brings a crew that includes Tucker and
Benjamin, 12, and Corinne, 10, and an arthritic Labrador, Madame
Justice, 14.
   The current laundry facilities are in the basement, below the
large first-floor rooms that are decorated with elegant period
furnishings and are more suited to entertaining than to family life.
   Beckwith said that for the Quayles' purposes the house is ``very
spacious. It's just not configured for a family with children at the
moment.''
   Aides to Mrs. Quayle brushed aside most questions about the
Quayles' personal lives. One aide, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Mrs. Quayle ``is very protective of their family
privacy,'' and that even though the former Indiana senator now is
vice president, ``The Quayles would like to keep their kids' lives
as normal as they can.''
   Tucker will finish out this year at Langley High School, where he
is in the ninth grade and a member of the basketball team. The
school is near the McLean, Va. house where the family lived when
Quayle was a senator.
   The other two children have switched to private schools in
Washington.
   The one family member who's having a tough time at the new house
is Madame Justice, so named because Mrs. Quayle, an attorney, got
the dog right after passing her bar.
   The dog has difficulty negotiating stairs due to arthritis and
old age. That makes it hard not only to get to the third floor where
the Quayle kids live and but also to enter and leave the house using
the porch steps.

   Former Prime Minister Paul Vanden
Boeynants said Wednesday he spent his month as a kidnap victim
hooded and handcuffed and never saw his captors' faces or heard
their voices.
   Vanden Boeynants described the kidnappers who abducted him Jan.
14 as ``professional criminals'' interested only in money. He said
they were well organized and operated with military discipline.
   ``My impression is that I was in France,'' Vanden Boeynants said
two days after he was freed by his kidnappers, who were paid a
ransom of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
   The wealthy businessman said his captors, possibly as many as
five, first sought a $10 million ransom but reduced the demand after
reading a newspaper article indicating he was not as rich as they
thought.
   At a news conference, Vanden Boeynants said he spent almost all
his time in captivity handcuffed and hooded. The first two weeks
were spent under threat of a gun, he said.
   The kidnappers, calling themselves the Socialist Revolutionary
Brigade, used the guise of a left-wing terrorist group to mislead
investigators and had no political motives, said Vanden Boeynants.
   ``We don't give a damn about politics. We want money,'' he quoted
them as telling him in a typewritten note.
   All communication with his kidnappers was done through such
notes, said Vanden Boeynants, 69. He said he remained calm
throughout the ordeal by repeatedly telling himself, ``You're not
going to die here.''
   He said two men attacked him the evening of Jan. 14 after he had
parked his car in the garage of his apartment building in Brussels.
   During a struggle, a third man came to help the assailants. They
pulled a hood over Vanden Boeynants' head, dragged him into a car
and drove for about 2{ to three hours.
   For the next four weeks, Vanden Boeynants said he was kept in a
darkened room in a house and always wore the hood. His handcuffs
were only taken off to allow him to eat or go to the bathroom.
   He was released late Monday in Tournai, 50 miles southwest of
Brussels, after his family paid the abductors a ransom that police
say totaled ``several tens of million of francs.'' Ten million
francs is about $250,000.
   Vanden Boeynants did not reveal the sum paid but did not dispute
the estimate given by police.
   Some newspapers reported Tuesday the ransom totaled $1.61 million.
   Vanden Boeynants was prime minister from 1966 to 1968 and again
from 1978 to 1979. He was also defense minister for seven years
during the 1970s and served as a Brussels city councilman for more
than 30 years starting in 1953.
   He received a three-year suspended sentence and was fined nearly
$17,000 in 1986 for tax fraud and forgery as head of a Brussels
meat-packing company.

   The prosecutor in Oliver North's Iran-Contra
case today outlined procedures which he said would would enable the
trial to go forward with the agreement of the Justice Department.
   Under the procedures, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh said he
would, if necessary, request an affidavit from Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh to prevent the introduction of classified information at
North's trial.
   In a four-paragraph statement, Walsh said he was issuing the
procedures in response to Tuesday's order by the judge in the case
which bars Thornburgh from filing affidavits at any time during
North's trial to block disclosure of specific classified material.
   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Justice Department agreed to the procedures after department
officials met with the independent counsel's staff. The department
will now go to the Supreme Court and seek to abandon a stay issued
Sunday at the department's request by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist.
   Walsh's statement came after the judge in the case said that if
the Justice Department is intent on preventing the trial, it should
do so now instead of trying to ``chop up the case'' with constant
censorship demands.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell on Tuesday rejected a Justice
Department bid to intervene in the case whenever they feel it
necessary to block disclosure of classified information. Instead,
Gesell said the independent counsel prosecuting the case would have
that authority.
   North's lawyers revealed more of their planned defense on
Tuesday, saying that the Reagan administration offered ``CIA covert
support'' to Central American nations if they would help the Contras
during a period in which Congress had banned U.S. aid.
   The alleged ``quid pro quo'' added a detail to the scenario
outlined earlier this week by North's attorneys, who say Reagan and
other top administration officials ordered that the arrangements be
kept secret.
   The Justice Department wants to limit the amount of evidence
released on the arrangements, saying more extensive disclosures
could harm national security. North's lawyers say the information is
essential to his defense.
   Four of the 12 criminal charges against North involve allegedly
misleading Congress in 1985 and 1986 by denying reports of National
Security Council efforts on behalf of the Contras. Three other
counts say he obstructed Congress, an inquiry by the attorney
general and destroyed documents in November 1986 by shredding
material that concerned aid to the Contras.
   Gesell said Tuesday he won't let Thornburgh ``chop up the case''
with a series of affidavits barring disclosure of information each
time North tried to introduce evidence the government found
objectionable.
   He noted that Thornburgh could invoke the Classified Information
Procedures Act and bar any such disclosures. That, however, could
make any trial of North impossible.
   ``He can act now if he wants,'' Gesell told Thornburgh deputy
Stephen Saltzburg.
   Otherwise, Gesell said, decisions on possible challenges to
classified information will be left to Walsh.
   Saltzburg had proposed a three-step process for dealing with
classified information.
   He said the government, through Walsh, would first seek to
fashion for the court a summary of facts. Failing that, the
prosecution would then seek to censor portions of the material and
as a last resort have the attorney general object to disclosure of
the specific information in question.
   The judge rejected the last part of Saltzburg's proposal, saying
the only time the attorney general may come into court with an
affidavit is to terminate a count or terminate the case.
   Under that drastic procedure, once the attorney general files the
affidavit, the court would have to order North not to disclose the
information on national security grounds, even though it is relevant
to his defense. That could lead to dismissal of charges.
   The department was reviewing Gesell's order, meeting with the
independent counsel and ``reviewing the options,'' said Thornburgh
aide David Runkel.
   The Supreme Court meets privately Friday to consider a further
stay.
   Gesell earlier this week noted the possibility that North had
been put ``between a rock and a hard place'' by his superiors,
questioned by Congress and others about the Contra aid efforts but
told by his bosses in the Reagan administration to keep the
arrangements secret.
   North lawyer Brendan Sullivan says the arrangements and the
alleged coverup must be presented to the jury in opening statements
and detailed in cross-examination if North is to have a fair trial.
   The inducement held out to Central American nations ``in return
for their military support for the resistance was, in part, CIA
covert support,'' Sullivan said Tuesday in a court filing.

   ``Legs Diamond,'' the lavish Peter Allen musical
about the 1920s gangster, will close Sunday after a troubled
four-month run and a drubbing from the critics.
   The musical, which cost more than $5 million, will have played 64
regular performances and 72 previews, the show's spokeswoman, Glenna
Freedman, said Wednesday.
   ``Legs Diamond'' has been plagued by problems since October, when
its preview at the Mark Hellinger Theater was delayed a week because
of difficulty with the complicated scenery.
   The opening was postponed twice as the book by Harvey Fierstein
and Charles Suppon was extensively revised, and two performers were
written out of the show.
   The musical finally opened Dec. 26 to overwhelmingly bad reviews.
Allen, who also wrote the music and lyrics, vowed to keep the show
running.
   He reportedly took a salary cut from $20,000 to $5,000 a week.
But weekly grosses slid from $455,250 during the Christmas holiday
week to $196,283 last week.

   The U.N. official who negotiated the Red
Army's withdrawal from Afghanistan said Wednesday that the pullout
was officially concluded even though some Soviet soldiers will
remain behind as advisers.
   Diego Cordovez, special U.N. representative for Afghanistan,
confirmed that more than 100,000 Soviet troops had been withdrawn by
the Feb. 15 deadline set under the U.N. agreement.
   ``Officially, I can tell you that they (the Soviet troops) have
left,'' said Cordovez, a former undersecretary-general who now is
the foreign minister of Ecuador.
   Cordovez personally negotiated the Soviet withdrawal accord among
the governments of Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Soviet Union and the
United States. The anti-Soviet guerrillas were not part of the
negotiations.
   Cordovez said the U.N. observer team in the region ``is satisfied
of the exemplary manner in which the time frame (for withdrawal) ...
has been fulfilled very, very strictly, both in the first phase and
the completion of the second phase.''
   Cordovez said the Soviet Union ``is leaving behind only a few
military advisers ... less than 10, a residual presence.''
   He did not elaborate and said he had no information about Soviet
civilian advisers who might remain.
   He indicated that the presence of Soviet military advisers did
not violate the Afghan agreements because the United States and
other nations which have closed their embassies have left behind
guards.
   Despite the withdrawal, Cordovez failed to persuade Afghans to
form a broad-based transition government as Soviet troops withdrew.
The future government, he said, must be decided by the Afghan people
themselves, without outside interference.
   He cited the history of friendship between Afghanistan and the
Soviet Union and predicted the Kabul regime would always be friendly
toward the Soviet Union, or at least ``not hostile.''
   He declined specific comment on whether aid provided by the
United States and Pakistan to the rebels violates the U.N.
agreement's provisions against intereference by other nations.
   ``Anything that fuels hostilities would be a violation of the
letter of spirit of the agreement,'' he said.
   The Soviet withdrawal began May 15 under U.N.-mediated accords
signed in Geneva on April 14 by Afghanistan and Pakistan, with the
United States and Soviet Union signing as guarantors.
   Fifty U.N. military observers in Afghanistan have a 20-month
mandate to fulfill. They are to concentrate on assisting the
repatriation of Afghan refugees and the rehabilitation of the
country.

   Only three people have turned in assault
rifles to police since the City Council banned the semiautomatic
weapons following a schoolyard rampage in which a gunman killed five
children, authorities said.
   The ban on a variety of assault weapons began Tuesday, one week
after the council passed it unanimously.
   Police Lt. George Lerner said that although only three residents
have given assault rifles to police, others are selling their guns
or storing them outside the city to comply with the law.
   ``Certainly, we'd like to see them off the streets altogether,
but they have alternatives to stay within the law,'' Lerner said.
   The ban was in response to the Jan. 17 attack in which Patrick
Edward Purdy sprayed his AKM-47 at Cleveland Elementary School
students, killing five youngsters and wounding 30 other people. He
then took his own life.
   Some gun shop owners said people won't give the guns to police
because the weapons are expensive, starting at around $300.
   ``Nobody is going to turn them in to the cops,'' said Tim
Cassidy, owner of Cassidy's Pawn Shop. ``They'll just take them into
an area where it's still legal to have them.''
   Several Stockton gun dealers sold their stocks of semiautomatic
weapons to retailers outside the city, and some said they stored the
guns with other dealers because of the possibility that the ban will
be overturned in court.
   Stockton's ban, similar to one under study by the state
Legislature, prohibits possession or sale of semiautomatic rifles
with detachable magazines that hold 20 or more rounds and are
designed for military purposes.
   The ordinance also applies to some semiautomatic shotguns and
pistols.
   Violators can be sentenced to up to six months in jail and a $500
fine.
   A similar ban has been adopted in Los Angeles, 325 miles south of
Stockton.

<HEAD>Elderly Americans Dying from Mismedication, Report Says</HEAD>

   Older Americans account for more than half of
all deaths from drug reactions, according to a government report
Wednesday warning of widespread medication problems among the
elderly.
   The report by the Health and Human Services Department's
inspector general pointed to improper use of drugs by the elderly,
misdiagnoses of their conditions by doctors, inappropriate dosage
levels and dangerous combinations of prescribed drugs.
   ``A growing body of evidence accumulated over the past 10 years
indicates that mismedication of the elderly has become a critical
health care issue, labeled by some as the `nation's other drug
problem,''' said the report written by Inspector General Richard P.
Kusserow.
   Americans over age 60, who comprise 17 percent of the population,
account for 39 percent of all hospitalizations and 51 percent of
deaths from drug reactions, the report said.
   In addition, according to the report:
   _In 1985, an estimated 243,000 older Americans were hospitalized
for adverse reactions to drugs.
   _Every year, 32,000 elderly adults fracture their hips in
drug-induced falls.
   _163,000 older adults experience serious mental impairment either
caused or worsened by drugs.
   _2 million elderly Americans are addicted or at risk of addiction
to tranquilizers or sleeping pills because of daily use for at least
one year.
   The report said the problems will worsen when government drug
payments under Medicare begin unless an effective drug-use review
system is developed. Congress directed the Health and Human Services
Department to develop such a system as part of the catastrophic
health insurance program created under Medicare last year.
   The drug benefit will begin in 1991, with the government paying
part of the cost of outpatient prescription drugs that exceed $600 a
year for a Medicare recipient.
   ``Before we start having wholesale payment by Medicare for these
prescriptive drugs, we should probably take some corrective action,
we should probably try to build greater safeguards for elderly
Americans,'' Kusserow said at a news conference.
   Such measures should include education efforts, drug counseling,
pharmacists' review of drug regimes in consultation with physicians
and improved drug labeling, he said.
   The report said the ``widespread problem of mismedication'' was
due to several weaknesses in the drug therapy delivery system,
including inadequate information about appropriate dosage levels for
older people. Most drugs are tested on healthy, young adults
although they may be marketed for conditions common among the
elderly.
   Also, the report said that physicians are untrained in the area
of geriatric pharmacology and that only a small percentage of the
elderly receive drug counseling services, even when required by
state law.
   The report also said the elderly more often than not fail to take
their medications as directed.
   ``Compliance with drug regimen rates range from 38 percent to 57
percent, with an average of 45 percent,'' the report said.
   Medication use problems include underuse and overuse of drugs,
sharing of drugs among family and friends, use of outside
prescriptions and use of damaged medications, the report said.
   In addition, the elderly often suffer from multiple chronic
diseases and frequently are under the care of more than one
physician ``who may prescribe drugs without the knowledge of the
patient's full drug regimen. Thus, the physician may be unaware of
the potential for drug interactions.''

<HEAD>Top Kohl Aide Acknowledges First Reports on Libyan Affair Date Back
to 1980</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government
learned in 1987 that Libya planned to produce poison gas at a plant
West German companies are suspected of helping to build, Kohl's
chief of staff said Wednesday.
   Wolfgang Schaeuble also said intelligence reports to the Bonn
leadership dating back to 1980 suggested West German involvement
with the plant in Rabta, but that authorities then determined there
was no ``conscious participation.''
   Schaeuble's disclosures have plunged the Bonn government deeper
into the scandal that has plagued U.S.-West German relations for
three months.
   But he declined to comment when asked whether the mounting
indications that Bonn authorities have known about the Rabta plant
all along have damaged West Germany's international prestige.
   Schaeuble said companies from at least six other countries have
been mentioned since the controversy over the chemical plant in
Rabta became public in late December. He said it was too early to
assess what responsibility West Germany might bear.
   Schaeuble reported the findings of a government investigation
into the Libyan affair to Parliament on Jan. 18, but the information
was made public Wednesday.
   He answered reporters' questions about the report after Economics
Minister Helmut Haussmann outlined proposals endorsed by Kohl's
Cabinet on Wednesday that would impose stricter export controls.
   The measures Parliament could consider this spring include a
proposed 15-year prison term and fines up to $540,000 for West
German businessmen who knowingly provide materials or technical
know-how for the production of chemical weapons.
   They also broaden the list of chemical, biological and nuclear
materials for which shippers must obtain federal approval to deliver
abroad, as well as reducing the number of countries to which
sensitive materials can be exported without government authorization.
   West Germany is the world's largest exporter, and 30 percent of
the nation's companies are involved in international trade,
Haussmann said.
   U.S. officials informed Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher during their visit to the United States in November that
intelligence reports linked the Black Forest chemical company of
Imhausen-Chemie to the Libyan project.
   The allegations were made public in late December, and Kohl and
others initially denied they had any indications West German
companies broke the law.
   Although authorities now say the U.S. charges probably are
grounded in fact, they say they have no clear evidence against any
of the companies implicated on which to press charges.
   According to Schaeuble's report, the Bundesnachrichtendienst
(BND), the country's central intelligence service, sent its first
report on the Libyan plant to the chancellor's office and the
Foreign Ministry on April 22, 1980.
   ``The BND reported that Libya proposed to build a plant to
produce chemical weapons with the help of East and West German firms
that were not named,'' Schaeuble said.
   ``The BND considered it possible that what was involved was a
normal chemical plant. A conscious participation by German firms in
construction of a chemical weapons plant was excluded.''
   Schaeuble repeated claims made by other senior officials over the
past couple of months that their first substantial information on
which they could base investigations came only in October 1988.

   The Soviet Union ended its costly
nine-year intervention in Afghanistan on Wednesday when the last
soldier _ the commander of the Red Army contingent _ walked across a
border bridge clutching flowers and accompanied by his teen-age son.
   ``I wasn't looking back,'' said Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov after
leaving Afghan soil where 15,000 Soviets died in a civil war that
still rages on.
   The pullout through this border town _ where many of the 115,000
Soviet troops had entered Afghanistan _ closed a painful chapter in
Soviet history that even Mikhail S. Gorbachev once called a
``bleeding wound.''
   But it did little to silence the critics who said the Kremlin's
December 1979 intervention to aid a Marxist government against the
Moslem insurgency was a mistake.
   About 200 cheering, windburned soldiers clutched automatic rifles
as they rode mud-spattered armored personnel carriers across the
Friendship Bridge over the Amu Darya River on Wednesday _ the
U.N.-mediated deadline for all Soviets to be out of Afghanistan.
   Gromov, the 45-year-old commander of the Soviet contingent in
Afghanistan, rode the last armored personnel carrier off Afghan soil.
   His vehicle stopped halfway across the bridge linking Termez with
the Afghan town of Khairaton, and his 14-year-old son, Maxim, ran
out. He gave his father a bouquet of carnations and they walked
arm-in-arm the final yards to Soviet soil.
   At the border, the sunburned general appeared to be near tears
when he said his thoughts were for his countrymen who served or died
in Afghanistan.
   ``I thought about those who were left behind, but most
importantly about those who have come home,'' said Gromov, who took
command in Afghanistan in 1984 on his third tour of duty there.
   Lt. Col. Igor Azarenok of the Soviet Defense Ministry said
Gromov's headquarters group was the last to leave, and the official
news agency Tass said other troops crossed the border Wednesday at
Kushka.
   In Afghanistan, tens of thousands of guerrillas reportedly were
advancing on the capital of Kabul and other major cities.
   Moslem guerrilla leaders in Islamabad, Pakistan, presented a plan
for an interim government in Afghanistan that would be debated in
the coming days.
   They would take control of their country swiftly now that the
Soviets are gone. Delegates to a special council chanted ``Death to
the Russians!'' and ``God is great!'' as their leaders declared the
Kremlin had suffered a devastating and humiliating defeat.
   The Afghan government Wednesday night thanked the Soviet Union
for its assistance, but it also said relations between the two
should develop on the basis of non-interference in each other's
internal affairs.
   The Kremlin, in a statement carried by Tass, thanked the Soviet
soldiers for ``fulfilling your patriotic and internationalist
duty.'' But the Communist Party daily Pravda, state-run TV and
commentators questioned whether the Kremlin was correct in sending
troops into Afghanistan in the first place.
   Some of the troops at the border ceremony also said getting
involved was a mistake.
   ``It was a clear error, so many died,'' said senior Sgt. Asgat
Husayinov, 22. He said Afghanistan was ``a hell after which you fear
nothing, except maybe yourself.''
   The Soviets acknowledged that 15,000 of its soldiers were killed
and more than 35,000 wounded in Afghanistan. The U.S. State
Department estimates that 1 million Afghans have been killed,
including combatants and civilians.
   The ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan seized power
in a 1978 Marxist coup, touching off a civil war.
   The Kremlin sent in the troops in December 1979 to replace the
pro-Moscow government with another. The Soviets have said the late
President Leonid Brezhnev and a handful of his closest associates
decided to intervene because the civil war threatened the Soviet
Union.
   ``It is possible to doubt the Brezhnev leadership's evaluation of
the level of military threat,'' Pravda said Wednesday. ``Such
vitally important decisions as the use of troops cannot be decided
secretly by a small circle of people, without the sanction of the
parliament.''
   Tass raised similar questions.
   ``All these years, Afghanistan has probably been the greatest
pain and worry for our people,'' the official news agency said.
``Scientists, politicians, soldiers and all other people will be
thinking and debating for a long time whether the decision of the
government of the country taken at that time was right.''
   Commentator Alexander Bovin told the Novosti press agency the
intervention was a ``tragic mistake.'' Despite official
pronouncements the Kremlin never sought victory in the war, Bovin
declared: ``It has ended in defeat for us, because we've failed to
cope with the tasks that brought us there.''
   He said the Red Army failed to stabilize the Kabul government and
disarm the guerrillas.
   The Soviet government said Afghanistan's future will depend on
whether the guerrilla force ``shows a sense of responsibility,
self-restraint and an ability to think not only in terms of
violence.''
   The Kremlin also called on the United States to prevent further
bloodshed by stopping its arms shipments to the rebels. The Soviet
Union reiterated it was prepared to end arms shipments to the Kabul
government.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the
end of the Soviet pullout marks ``a long awaited day for the Afghan
people and they can now go on to determine their own future.'' He
reiterated that U.S. support for the guerrillas will continue.
   The United States was the principal supporter of the Moslem
guerrillas, but they also were aided by Pakistan, China and Iran.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in Portugal on a tour
of NATO countries, said the Soviets should now help in Afghanistan's
reconstruction.
   Soviet TV devoted the first 17 minutes of its evening news show
``Vremya'' to the pullout, and a correspondent said the war would
not end for mothers who lost their sons and are asking, ``What for?''
   Although Gromov described the present situation in Afghanistan as
calm, Soviet officials estimate 30,000 guerrillas are massed around
Kabul, which has been blockaded for months. Foreign Ministry
spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said 15,000 guerrillas were around
Jalalabad, and Kabul Radio said insurgents surrounded Herat and
Khandahar.
   Facing them were 30,000 poorly trained Afghan Army conscripts,
with little loyalty to the Soviet-backed Marxist regime in Kabul,
according to Western intelligence. Some guerrilla commanders say
they expect fiercer resistance from an estimated 20,000 secret
police, elite guardsmen, police and armed Communist Party members.
   Diego Cordovez, the special U.N. representative for Afghanistan
who negotiated the Soviet withdrawal, said in New York that fewer
than 10 Soviet military advisers remain in Afghanistan.
   Literaturnaya Gazeta reported that at one point during the war,
Red Army soldiers intentionally ran over a car carrying seven
civilians. It said they fired at the car because its driver had
ignored warning shots.
   The article implied that all those in the car were killed, either
by gunfire or when it was run over later by an armored personnel
carrier.
   The soldiers had suspected the car was being used by guerrillas,
and the soldiers' commander told his men, ``I don't need
prisoners,'' according to Literaturnaya Gazeta.
   The commander was sentenced to six years in prison but later
freed in an amnesty, the newspaper said.

   Pakistani analysts on Wednesday
praised the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan but said they foresee
further struggles in the country before its 10-year-old civil war
ends.
   ``This must be the miracle of century. It's finally come about,''
said retired Lt. Gen. Kamal Matinuddin after the last Red Army
troops left Afghanistan.
   As the head of Pakistan's Institute of Strategic Studies,
Matinuddin has followed the decade-long war between communist forces
and Moslem guerrillas.
   ``Today is a very historic day. It must be marked,'' said Ijaz
Gilani, research director of the institute's crisis and conflict
analysis team, which has published monthly statistics on the war.
   They spoke during a status report on Afghanistan at the
institute's Islamabad headquarters.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman, speaking on the usual condition of
anonymity, said the withdrawal ``paves the way for a comprehensive
settlement based on the right of the Afghan people for
self-determination.''
   Matinuddin said he was skeptical of widespread predictions that
Afghanistan's government will fall quickly to the guerrillas in the
absence of Soviet soldiers, who entered the country in December 1979.
   ``I don't think it's that simple. (President) Najib's forces are
strong. I think the most likely scenario is that fighting will
continue ... by harassment by mujahedeen _ attacks on airports and
such,'' he said.
   Guerrilla leaders, most of whom are based in Pakistan, said they
do not plan to launch frontal assaults on communist-held Afghan
cities.
   They said their main tactic will be to besiege cities in hopes
that demoralized government troops will defect to the guerrillas,
causing the communist government to collapse.
   Matinuddin said the pullout leaves the guerrillas in disarray as
they argue over formation of a postwar government.
   He indicated the guerrillas' failure to form a cohesive
alternative to the Kabul regime may cost it its credibility in the
crucial months ahead.
   ``I don't believe the international community will respond to the
new government very quickly,'' Matinuddin said.
   Gilani gave an account of the military situation in Afghanistan
on the last day of the Soviet withdrawal. Among other points, he
said:
   _ All cities with strategic or ``psychological'' importance were
under guerrilla siege.
   _ The important airports were within attacking range of the
guerrillas.
   _ All major highways were at least partially interrupted by the
guerrillas.
   _ Kabul was relatively calm.
   _ There was a rising trend in defections by communist troops to
the resistance.

<HEAD>U.N. Planning Starvation Prevention In Sudan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudan's government has invited U.N. relief
officials to Khartoum next month to begin planning ways to prevent
mass starvation during the rainy season, officials said Wednesday.
   ``It's a meeting that is looking at a potential tragedy, and we
want to find practical solutons to avoid it,'' said Charles-Henri La
Muniere, a senior U.N. official working on the Sudan relief project.
   The conference is planned for March 8-9 and will be led by UNICEF
Director James P. Grant and Undersecretary-General Abdulrahim A.
Farah, said U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani.
   Private relief agencies will be contacted shortly to join the
effort, said La Muniere.
   Unless food is delivered throughout the Sudan to about 4 million
people displaced by rebellion, drought and famine before the rainy
season begins in May, hundreds of thousands of people may starve.
   ``It's a race against time,'' said La Muniere. ``We've got to
beat the devil at his game on this one. The donor community is
solidly behind this.''
   The United States and other Western nations are pressuring the
Sudanese government of Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi to improve food
distribution and other aid to all sections of his country.
   Madhi's government has often cited the rebellion by the Sudan
People's Liberation Army as posing too great a danger for relief
flights and convoys in the south.
   The government has allowed little aid to reach the rebel-held
south, where about 500,000 people died of starvation last year. The
rebellion broke out in 1983 over demands for greater automony and
economic reforms.
   The southern provinces of Bahr Ghazal, Upper Nile and Equatoria
are mainly Christian and animist and resent being ruled by the
predominantly Islamic governing elite in the north.
   During the past year the rebels have become more cooperative due
to limited negotiations with some elements of Mahdi's government,
said U.N. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Relief flights organized by the World Food Program, the Red
Cross, UNICEF and the U.N. Development Program have been allowed by
the rebels to land in cities in the south, where peasant farmers
have fled to escape the guerrilla war.
   Distributing food throughout the country before the rainy season
will require truck convoys and shipments by train, said U.N.
officials.

<HEAD>Study Says Alcohol Toxic to Heart and Other Muscle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lifetime of heavy alcohol abuse can damage the
heart by weakening the body's muscles, according to a new study.
   Researchers concluded that people risk muscle damage if their
lifetime consumption of pure alcohol is more than 13 kilograms for
each kilogram of body weight. This is the equivalent of a 150-pound
man drinking more than 12 ounces of whiskey a day for 20 years.
   Doctors long assumed that weakness among heavy drinkers, a
condition called chronic alcoholic myopathy, resulted from
malnutrition, because alcoholics often eat poorly.
   However, the new study found that such muscle wasting, including
weakness of the heart muscle, was also common among alcoholics who
lived in stable homes and ate well.
   The study was conducted on 50 alcoholic men by Dr. Alvaro
Urbano-Marquez and colleagues from the University of Barcelona in
Spain. The results were published in Thursday's New England Journal
of Medicine.
   They found that one-third of the alcoholics had weakness of the
heart muscle, and nearly half had abnormalities in other muscles.
   An accompanying editorial by Dr. Ivan Diamond of the University
of California, San Francisco, called the Spanish study important.
   He said it shows that ``a large lifetime dose of ethanol
(alcohol) determines the prevalence and severity of damage to
cardiac and skeletal muscle in alcoholism.''

<HEAD>Officials Say Offer Being Reviewed But Could Pose Some Difficulties</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Department is still reviewing an
offer made last month by a group of American businessmen to purchase
the partially built U.S. Embassy in Moscow, but the proposal could
pose some difficulties, officials said Wednesday.
   The United States has halted construction on the eight-story
embassy because it was found to have been riddled with Soviet
listening devices while the Soviets were building it.
   Last year, then-President Reagan recommended that the building be
razed and rebuilt.
   But last month, a trade group headed by Dwayne O. Andreas, one of
the nation's richest men and chairman of Archer Daniels Midland Co.,
offered to buy the building for use as business offices.
   Andreas is also co-chairman of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and
Economic Council, which has tried to promote more trade between the
two superpowers. He made the offer on behalf of a consortium of U.S.
companies, which would use the building as a Moscow headquarters.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman, asked about a
report that U.S. officials had found the Andreas proposal to be the
most expensive of several options for dealing with the building,
said Wednesday that ``all of the options'' were still under study,
including the proposal from the businessmen.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is expected to send a
recommendation to President Bush once the ``in-depth review'' of
those options is complete, Redman said. The spokesman said he was
not aware of any deadline for completion of the study.
   Joseph S. Hulings, the coordinator of embassy problem in the
department's management bureau, said his office was ``still
evaluating'' the businessmen's offer.
   Hulings said he could estimate ``off the top of my head'' that it
might cost 25 percent more to sell the building to the businessmen
and build a new embassy.
   That is because the foundation of the unfinished building
contains some of the electrical, water and other facilities for the
surrounding living quarters of the U.S. diplomats and their
families, and if a new building were built at a different site, new
utilities would be required.
   The Soviets would have to approve any sale because the building
was intended for use as a new embassy, built under a 1972 agreement
between the two countries.
   Another problem arises because, under the agreement, the Soviets
cannot occupy their new facility in Washington until the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow is ready. If U.S. businessmen occupied the Moscow
building, the Soviets might seek to take over their completed
chancery in Washington.
   Although the United States has informally discussed the proposal
with the Soviets, no reply has been received from them, and until
they reply, no formal cost estimate can be drawn up, Hulings added.
   The United States has filed claims against the Soviets for $29
million in connection with what the United States claims are defects
and delays in the construction. Those claims must be negotiated by
an arbitration panel in Stockholm, Sweden.
   The existence of bugs in the structure became widely known in
1986. Under the 1972 construction agreement, a Soviet
government-owned construction firm was permitted to build the
American embassy.

   A flurry of shootings overnight, including
three killings, accelerated demands Wednesday for tougher action to
stem rising violence in the nation's capital.
   ``No mayor anywhere could be more unhappy about this situation
than me,'' Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. said at his monthly news
conference. ``If I had the solutions for these killings at my
fingertips, I'd stop them. It's frightening, it's sad, that we've
come to this point.''
   Said Barry, ``Obviously, meeting in the community is not enough,
marches aren't enough, sending hundreds of police officers out isn't
enough. We're in an epidemic around America.''
   Paramedics responded to 14 reports of shootings in the city
Tuesday, 11 of them between 6:30 p.m. and midnight, according to
Twyla Geraci, a spokeswoman for the D.C. Ambulance Service. Five of
the 14 ended up being false calls or people refusing treatment. She
didn't know whether other shootings might have occurred without
ambulance calls.
   The three slayings, combined with the death Tuesday of a
teen-ager who was shot in the head the previous night, raised the
total of lives taken in the first 45 days of 1989 to 75, compared to
46 at the same time in 1988. The total for all of last year was 372,
a record for the city.
   The dead Tuesday night were identified as Anthony Bailey and
Derrick Bell, both 25, and Darnell Wells, 26, according to Officer
Walter Ferguson, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department.
He identified the teen-ager as Habib Mathis, 15. All four were from
suburban Maryland.
   Nearby but not included in the D.C. toll, a gunman described as a
``disgruntled employee'' killed three women and then himself at the
office of a savings bank in suburban Bethesda, Md., on Wednesday.
   Police and Mayor Barry have blamed drugs for most of the recent
homicides in the District of Columbia.
   ``Obviously, these are targeted murders,'' Barry said. ``They are
not random killings _ these are assassinations, drug dealers killing
one another.''
   The mayor said city residents needn't fear for their lives.
   ``Downtown Washington is safe, and a lot of our neighborhoods are
safe. Washington is not Dodge City,'' the mayor said, though last
year Police Chief Maurice Turner said the number and variety of
weapons seized on the city's streets reminded him ``of something out
of the wild, wild West.''
   Though blaming drugs for the violence, Barry two months ago
drastically curtailed Operation Clean Sweep, the police department's
program targeting street drug sales.
   At his news conference, he promised a major announcement on new
crime fighting strategies by next Monday.
   Since budget problems will prevent Barry from hiring many new
officers, some police officials predict the city will try to deal
with the crime wave by moving officers from safer neighborhoods into
drug-plagued sections.
   But council members called for more drastic action.
   Councilman H.R. Crawford renewed his call for the National Guard
to patrol notorious drug markets.
   Barry has opposed such a move, saying the city can handle its own
problems.
   ``It just says to me that we need to apply tougher standards
across the board when it comes to dealing with this,'' Councilman
James Nathanson said. ``We cannot let this continue.''
   The mayor said legislation instituting the death penalty in the
District of Columbia isn't the answer.
   ``We have a death penalty already _ 70 percent (of last year's
murders) were assassinations, and those count as executions,'' Barry
said. ``That's an unjust system, but if that's not keeping people
from killing one another, I'm not sure a just system would.''

   Jamaica will receive $30 million in additional
U.S. assistance for hurricane relief, the Agency for International
Development announced Wednesday.
   The new aid is targeted for reconstruction of homes and public
buildings and restoration of water, electrical, health and
telecommunications services.
   Last September, Hurricane Gilbert wrecked tens of thousands of
homes and businesses and destroyed crops and power lines.
   The new aid package brings the total U.S. hurricane relief effort
in Jamaica to $154 million, AID said.

<HEAD>Allies Urge Bush Administration To Respond To Gorbachev Agenda</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NATO allies are urging Washington to launch a
comprehensive arms control initiative or risk of allowing Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev to take charge of the East-West agenda,
a senior U.S. official said Wednesday.
   The official briefed reporters aboard the plane of Secretary of
State James A. Baker III as Baker moved into the final phase of his
tour of NATO capitals.
   The U.S. official said said Gorbachev was getting credit from the
West European public for arms reductions and human rights advances
that were pressed on him by the United States.
   ``There are potential opportunities for us to launch
initiatives'' to reduce long-range nuclear weapons arsenals, slow
the proliferation of ballistic missiles in troubled areas of the
world and curb chemical weapons, the official said on condition of
anonymity.
   ``There are real problems that threaten to make the whole
environment a lot more dangerous,'' he said. ``If the Soviets really
have new thinking _ and we think they may _ these are good areas for
us to be both probing and challenging.''
   He said that if the West, led by the United States, does not take
charge ``and deal with that reality ... Gorbachev's agenda will
become one that is much more prominent and we will have to respond
to Gorbachev's agenda rather than have him respond to ours.''
   Baker's eight-day trip is designed primarily to solicit the views
of the allies as the Bush administration tries to formulate new
foreign policy initiatives.
   In the meantime, resumption of U.S. negotiations with the Soviets
to reduce strategic nuclear weapons has been postponed indefinitely.
   Baker made stops Wednesday in Spain and Portugal, meeting in
Madrid with Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzales and Foreign
Minister Francisco Fernandez-Ordonez and in Lisbon with Portuguese
Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva and Foreign Minister Joao de Dues
Pinheiro.
   Baker then flew to Brussels for meetings Thursday with Belgian
and NATO officials. Later Thursday he will stop in Luxembourg and
the Netherlands. He flies home Friday.
   In a brief exchange with reporters in Madrid, Baker marked the
final pullout of Soviet troops from Afghanistan with an appeal to
Moscow to contribute to rehabilitating that country.
   He called the Soviet military intervention, which began in
December 1979, ``a tragic chapter'' in Afghanistan's history.

   A black Alaskan timber wolf, described as
``friendly'' but ``quite timid,'' was on the loose in the nation's
capital Wednesday but authorities said it probably was not dangerous.
   The wolf, on tour with its owner to promote its job as mascot of
a Fairbanks radio station, escaped Tuesday from its crate in a
garage near the National Zoo while the woman was visiting relatives.
   Kristina Harper, chief of animal disease control for the city's
Department of Human Services, said, ``We have no reason to think
that the animal's dangerous.''
   ``It sounds kind of alarming to think there's a wolf in the city,
but it's a domesticated hybrid. Apparently it's tame and used to
people,'' she said.
   The wolf is named ``Athena'' and is part dog. It chewed its way
through a wooden crate, said Glenner Anderson, program director of
KWLF in Fairbanks. He said Dawn Maddox, of Fairbanks, had raised the
2-year-old wolf as a pet since its birth, alongside her two children.
   ``It's extremely friendly, but is quite timid,'' said Anderson.
``It's probably got its tail between its legs and it's running
around somewhere or hiding somewhere. It's going to be hard to catch
because it's scared around people.''
   The wolf won a contest eight months ago seeking a mascot for the
radio station and has been on an East Coast tour promoting the
station.
   Ms. Harper said her agency had received no calls from people
sighting the animal.
   She described the animal as ``mostly black with a little bit of
brown in its mane and some white on its back and haunches.'' It has
amber eyes and was wearing a choke collar.

   Army gunfire wounded 15 people in the occupied
lands on Wednesday, and soldiers rounded up 40 Palestinians
suspected of anti-Israeli activities, Arab and Israeli reports said.
   Arab reporters and Israeli radio stations said the Palestinians
were detained in raids on refugee camps and villages in the West
Bank.
   An Israeli military spokeman said soldiers made arrests and
sealed a Palestinian home in the Ein Beit Elma refugee camp near
Nablus, but he would not say how many people were arrested. Army
radio said 14 Palestinians were taken into custody there.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under army regulations,
said the purpose was to capture Palestinians suspected of attacking
others who have collaborated with Israel.
   He said a resident of the sealed house is accused of attacking an
alleged collaborator last September. Arab reports identified him as
Talat Abu Saris, 19, who has been held four months without trial.
   More than 30 Palestinians were detained in other raids at
villages and refugee camps near Ramallah on suspicion of
anti-Israeli activities, the Arab reports said. The army said it was
checking the reports.
   Nine Palestinians were reported shot by soldiers Wednesday in the
Gaza Strip, six of them in the Shati refugee camp.
   Camp residents said troopers stopped an elderly man for
questioning and struck him, then a crowd gathered, urged on by
chants of the Moslem rallying cry ``Allahu akbar'' (God is great).
   The crowd began throwing stones and the soldiers fired, the
residents said.
   At the Rafah refugee camp, soldiers dispersed schoolchildren by
using rubber bullets and a machine that fires gravel, the reports
said.
   Hospital officials said two Palestinians, aged 16 and 25,
suffered leg wounds and a 17-year-old in Gaza City also was shot in
the leg.
   In the West Bank, six Palestinians were reported wounded at
Nablus, the nearby Faraa refugee and Janna Ein village.
   At least 380 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed since
the uprising against nearly 22 years of occupation began 14 months
ago. More than 7,000 Palestiians have been wounded.

<HEAD>10-Question Test Helps Identify Alzheimer's Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quick, 10-word memory test developed by
researchers to help identify Alzheimer's patients in early stages of
the brain disorder has won praise from the American Medical
Association.
   The test, which takes less than 10 minutes, seems to be ``a
brief, efficient and accurate means of predicting Alzheimer's'' in
elderly patients, the AMA said in a statement.
   The University of Minnesota researchers who developed the test
report that it is 95.2 percent accurate in distinguishing elderly
people with early signs of Alzheimer's disease from those with no
sign of mental impairment.
   The test makes use of findings by other researchers. One of those
findings is that people with Alzheimer's forget things within
minutes of learning them and that attempts to improve their memory
do not significantly help.
   Other researchers also have found that normal elderly people
forget at a much slower pace and are helped appreciably by memory
improvement strategies.
   ``Alzheimer's patients lose their ability to encode things (store
them for easy retrieval),'' Dr. Soren Ryberg said Tuesday. Ryberg
and Dr. David Knopman reported their test in this month's Archives
of Neurology journal.
   Alzheimer's is a progressive, irreversible disorder with no known
cause or cure. It is characterized by memory loss, disorientation
and personality changes.
   Ryberg, in an experiment, gave 55 patients thought to be normal
and 28 thought to have Alzheimer's the same series of 10 common
words. He asked them to use each word in a sentence twice. Both
groups ranged in age from 65 to 85.
   Ryberg said creating a sentence is a way of encoding a word in
the brain, something studies indicate Alzheimer's patients do poorly.
   After five minutes, he asked the participants to recite as many
of the words as they could. He suggested they jog their memories by
trying to recall the sentences.
   Most of the Alzheimer's patients were able to recall no more than
two of the words. The average was less than one word per patient. On
average, the normal elderly recalled about six of the 10 words,
Ryberg said.
   Ryberg said the conclusion is that a score of zero to two is
``strongly suggestive'' of Alzheimer's or some similar dementia, and
three is just ``suggestive.''
   He said that Knopman, an associate professor of neurology,
confirmed the Alzheimer's diagnosis as much as possible by ruling
out other likely causes, such as stroke, depressed function of the
thyroid gland or low levels of vitamin B-12.
   ``You still have to say possible or probable because it's a
clinical diagnosis (based on symptoms),'' he said. ``It's not until
autopsy that you can be absolutely positive of the diagnosis.''

<HEAD>First Full-Fledged Opposition Party To Hold Founding Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) The first full-fledged opposition
party to be established in Yugoslavia since the Communist takeover
in 1946 says it will hold its founding convention in this regional
capital on Thursday.
   The Slovenian Social Democratic Union published its program in
Wednesday's issue of the liberal Mladina youth weekly, which said
the party ``will strive for a peaceful transition from the country's
single-party (Communist) system to a system based on (Western-style)
parliamentary democracy.''
   It will also work for establishment of independent trade unions
in Yugoslavia and for legalization of the right to strike, according
to the program.
   Authorities in Slovenia, Yugoslavia's most liberal republic, have
demonstrated an unprecedented degree of tolerance by allowing the
establishment up of alternative political, cultural, ecological and
other groups.
   The first autonomous political group here, the Slovenian
Democratic Union, was formed in Ljubljana on Jan. 11. It agreed to
operate within the framework of the Socialist Alliance, a
Communist-led mass organization.
   But the Social Democratic Union rejected any cooperation with the
Alliance as long as it is led by the Communist Party, the party's
leading founder, France Tomsic, told The Associated Press.
   ``The Social Democratic Union will strive for parliamentary
democracy, since the social democratic program has been a part of
political life in most progressive and developed European countries
for more than 100 years,'' Tomsic said.
   Yugoslav Communist leaders repeatedly have denounced the idea of
introducing a multiparty system, claiming the parties would be
formed on ethnic lines and lead to tensions and even fratricidal
clashes among the country's patchwork of six republics and two
provinces.
   Zoran Polic, a hard-line member of Slovenia's Communist
leadership, was quoted Wednesday by the press as saying formation of
the Social Democratic Union ``should be decisively prevented.''
   Authorities thwarted previous efforts to set up independent
political parties in Yugoslavia, but preparations for holding the
founding convention in a convention hall in Ljubljana continued
despite the official criticism.

   The Air Force announced Wednesday it would
conduct a full-scale environmental impact study of its plan to build
a radio transmitter complex in an ecologically sensitive area near
Warren Grove, N.J.
   The complex, dubbed the Northeast Regional Communications
Facility, is designed to guarantee international communications in
the event of war or other national emergency, supplementing the
satellite links used now.
   Last November, the Air Force informed local officials it intended
to proceed with the project under a national security justification
without performing an environmental impact study.
   But local residents, New Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean and the
state's congressional delegation all have expressed opposition or
concern over the plan, prompting the Air Force to reconsider the
matter.
   ``The Air Force will begin preparation of the Environmental
Impact Statement in the near future,'' the service said Wednesday in
a brief statement.
   ``There will be opportunities for public involvement in the
process, which will be announced at the appropriate times.''
   The Air Force was named to build and operate the facility by the
Defense Communications Agency and wants to use a 43-acre site now
owned by the Federal Aviation Administration in Warren Grove _ in
the heart of the Pine Barrens.
   The Pine Barrens is an ecologically sensitive wilderness area
that harbors a variety of endangered plants and wildlife. It has
been designated a National Reserve since 1978.
   More than a dozen radio towers would be constructed at the FAA
site, which is located about 20 miles southeast of McGuire Air Force
Base.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. and British transportation secretaries
appealed Wednesday for better security practices to make
international air travel safe from terrorists.
   They addressed the 33-member council of the International Civil
Aviation Organization at the opening of a two-day meeting the United
States and Britain requested after a bomb blew up a Pan Am jetliner
Dec. 21 over Scotland.
   Samuel K. Skinner of the United States said: ``No one country or
carrier should have to stand alone in matters of security. It is
only by joining together, in the finest traditions of ICAO, that we
can secure international civil aviation from acts of terrorism.''
   Paul Channon, the British secretary, told the council members:
``We meet today because the list of such disasters has grown too
long.''
   He noted the attack on Pan Am flight 103, which killed 259 people
on the plane and 11 on the ground, and the bombings in flight of an
Air India flight in 1985 and a Korean Airways jet in 1987.
   Those attending the meeting said bomb attacks on planes must be
considered a phenomenon to be fought much as international
cooperation helped reduce the number of aircraft hijackings after
they became epidemic.
   Among suggested neasures are increased screening of passengers
and carry-on baggage, more thorough screening of checked baggage,
pairing passengers with checked baggage and better screening of
cargo and mail.
   Others include faster development and installation of screening
technology, tighter control of access to strategic areas and the
possibility of limiting carry-on radios, computers and other
electronic devices in which explosives are difficult to detect.
   Channon asked the council for a unanimous decision ``that the
time has come to take vigorous action to review existing provisions
and examine the need for new ones to improve our common defenses
against the scourge of sabotage which has taken such a hideous toll
of innocent life in the past four years.''
   U.S. airlines have taken more stringent security measures since
the Pan Am bombing, but officials said air terrorism can be
controlled only through international measures.
   ``We are dealing with terrorists who can and will strike
anywhere,'' Channon said. ``Only concerted action by all ICAO's
member states can give air travelers and air crews confidence in
their security.''
   The organization is a U.N. agency and 160 countries are members.

   The city agreed Wednesday to a one-week delay

decides whether he has jurisdiction in Colt Industries' lawsuit
challenging the new law.
   The city's ban on the sale of the rapid-fire weapons will remain

Industries Inc. is considered.
   The City Council on Feb. 7 banned the sale of semiautomatic
weapons including Colt's AR-15, the AK-47 and the Uzi. The law also
bars possession of such guns after Feb. 22 unless they have been
modified so they cannot fire.
   New York-based Colt, makers of the legendary Colt .45-caliber
revolver and the AR-15 _ a civilian version of the military's M-16 _
contends in its lawsuit that the law will harm the company's
finances and its image.
   A court hearing was postponed Wednesday because of the
jurisdiction issue.
   ``By making one of our firearms illegal by specifying in an
ordinance that it's an apparently bad or unuseful weapon not
(intended) for sporting is bad for our reputation,'' Colt attorney
Harry G. Melkonian said after the Wednesday's court session.
   ``Colt is making a fine and precision weapon and firearm used for
target shooting and competition. It's a sporting rifle and not a
Saturday night special. We're really offended that we're thrown into
this category,'' he said.
   City officials said Colt was ignorant of the dangers of firearms
in Los Angeles. There were 452 gang-related slaying in Los Angeles
County in 1988, most of which were committed with guns and many with
semiautomatic weapons.
   Guns sales have become an emotional issue statewide since a
schoolyard massacre Jan. 17 in Stockton in northern California. A
gunman using a AK-47 assault rifle killed five children and wounded
29 other students and a teacher.
   ``Obviously, the Colt executives don't walk the streets of Los
Angeles and experience the violence we have here,'' said Councilman
Zev Yaroslavsky, who introduced the ordinance.
   About 30 states, including California, are considering some sort
of control or ban on semiautomatic weapons.
   U.S. District Judge William Gray delayed a hearing on Colt's
request to issue a temporary restraining order to block the
ordinance.
   Gray said he must decide if he has jurisdiction in Colt's lawsuit
or if it should be sent to state court. He scheduled a hearing for
Feb. 22.
   City attorneys agreed that enforcement of the possession ban
would be suspended until March 1 pending the outcome of the next
hearing before Gray.
   ``We're very pleased with the results,'' Melkonian said. ``As far
as we're concerned, this is the beginning of the end of this
ordinance.''
   City Attorney James Hahn predicted otherwise. ``We're going to
prevail in this issue. What happened today keeps our ban against
sales in effect,'' he said.
   Colt Industries wants the ordinance barred on grounds that it
illegally preempts state law regarding the sale and possession of
weapons and would force a hardship on the company.
   Deputy City Attorney Byron Boeckman said he would argue that
state law does not bar cities from regulating weapons.
   ``We contend the state never said we can't regulate the use or
possession of most weapons. It is not a matter of statewide concern,
but of local concern,'' Boeckman said.
   According to the lawsuit, Colt shipped more than $100,000 worth
of the rifles and other firearms to the Los Angeles area just prior
to enactment of the ordinance, which prohibits dealers and retailers
from receiving them.
   ``They must either break sales contracts with Colt or be in
criminal violation,'' the suit contends.

   Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial appeared to
get back on track Wednesday as prosecutors, after meeting with
Justice Department lawyers, issued guidelines designed to guard
against disclosures of classified material by North.
   In a four-paragraph statement, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh
said he will, if necessary, seek an affidavit from Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh to prevent the disclosure of classified information
which could harm national security.
   The statement was worked out with Thornburgh, who said it will
permit national security secrets to be protected.
   Hours after the announcement, Thornburgh asked the Supreme Court
to lift the stay that has delayed the start of the trial and said he
will also drop his appeal of rulings by U.S. District Court Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell on secrecy issues. Chief Justice William Rehnquist
had issued the administrative stay at the Justice Department's
request.
   Walsh's statement was in response to an order issued Tuesday by
Gesell, who told Thornburgh to stay out of the North case, barring
the attorney general from filing affidavits in ``bits and pieces''
in response to individual documents or testimony planned by North.
Gesell said Walsh ``will be recognized as responsible for the
day-to-day conduct of this case.''
   North's attorney, Brendan Sullivan, was not immediately available
for comment.
   Thornburgh, in a statement, endorsed the plan. ``The independent
counsel's planned implementation of yesterday's district court order
provides the government with the substance of what we have been
seeking for the past week.''
   ``I am pleased that a mechanism has been developed that will
permit the trial to go forward while ensuring that I can fulfill the
responsibility imposed upon me by the Congress to protect the
national security interests of the United States,'' Thornburgh said.
   Walsh's statement also says Walsh will notify Thornburgh if
evidence in any of eight specific categories is to be introduced.
   Those categories include information identifying undercover CIA
officers, and information revealing locations of CIA stations and
U.S. covert activities other than paramilitary support for the
Contras. Also included are details about specific CIA operations
with foreign intelligence services and government officials as well
as information identifying by name or description foreigners who are
CIA assets or liaison officials.
   ``If the Attorney General, by affidavit, states that the evidence
(in the eight categories) is such a threat to national security that
it can not be introduced, Independent Counsel will accept this
statement as a statement by the Administration and ask the Court to
take appropriate action,'' said Walsh.
   ``If the attorney general, by affidavit, states that the evidence
(in the eight categories) is such a threat to national security that
it can not be introduced, independent counsel will accept this
statement as a statement by the administration and ask the court to
take appropriate action,'' said Walsh.
   Walsh also said he ``will, of course, object to any classified
information not previously'' designated by North as being part of
the evidence he plans to introduce at trial.
   Walsh's statement differs from Gesell's order of Tuesday in one
respect. Gesell's order says Walsh may prevent the introduction of
classified information through the section of the Classified
Information Procedures Act dealing with affidavits.
   Walsh, however, said he doesn't have the power to file an
affidavit under the section of CIPA permitting the barring of
classified information damaging to the national security.
   But Walsh said he can ask Thornburgh to file an affidavit if it
becomes necessary and after the court has rejected other
alternatives such as summarizing, or censoring, the classified
material.
   Gesell said Tuesday he won't let Thornburgh ``chop up the case''
with a series of affidavits barring disclosure of information each
time North tried to introduce evidence the government found
objectionable.
   Decisions on possible challenges to classified information will
be left to Walsh, Gesell said.
   Concerns over classified material that North wanted to use in his
defense erupted Feb. 8. The Justice Department sought a court order
that would have barred the fired White House aide from disclosing
any classified material without a court ruling that it is admissible
and as long as there is an objection to its release pending from the
government.
   North faces 12 criminal charges. He is accused of allegedly
concealing from Congress in 1985 and 1986 his efforts on behalf of
the Nicaraguan Contras and of covering up from the attorney general
the National Security Council's role in diverting money from the
Iran arms sales to the Contras.
   North also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 security
system at his home from co-defendant Richard Secord, converting to
his own use at least $4,300 in traveler's checks from Contra leader
Adolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenue
in connection with charitable contributions supporting the Contras.

<HEAD>Opposition, Government Discuss Farmers Union Freedoms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition and the government agreed on
union freedom for farmers at talks Wednesday, an opposition
participant reported.
   He said the two sides still are divided on agricultural price
reforms.
   The government meanwhile announced an average 8 percent increase
in processed meat prices, a touchy issue among consumers. Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa was hailed when he visited a pro-Solidarity
factory in southeastern Poland, and small strikes broke out across
the country.
   ``We were able to agree on pluralism,'' Law Professor Andrzej
Stelmachowski told a news conference after the first session of an
agriculture working group.
   The agricultural reforms talks are part of the unprecedented
round-table negotiations on a wide range of political and economic
reforms.
   ``I had an overwhelming impression that many concrete things were
discussed,'' said Stelmachowski, who wore the badge of the banned
Solidarity independent union movement.
   Wielsaw Mlynarczyk, deputy minister of agriculture and forestry,
said the group agreed on ``creating organizational and legal
conditions of activities of farmers' trade unions, covering
Solidarity, farmers' circles or any other organizations that farmers
will form according to their will.''
   Solidarity national spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said agreement
on the need to allow more than one legal trade union for farmers
will influence discussions at talks on union freedoms set to resume
Thursday.
   ``It's important in the context of pluralism because it implies a
change in the union law,'' he said.
   The 1982 law on trade unions does not allow farmers to organize
independent unions.
   Talks began on Feb. 6 and are intended to negotiate the terms for
restoring Solidarity's legal status and to develop a ``social
contract'' between the opposition and the government to chart
Poland's future.
   On Wednesday, the government proposed a system to lessen state
control of market prices for agricultural products. Solidarity said
a minimum level of prices must be guaranteed to protect farmers'
incomes.
   Stelmachowski said the government-sanctioned trade union alliance
OPZZ vetoed the proposal on minimum prices, but that it will be
discussed again when agriculture reform talks resume Friday.
   The state news agency PAP announced the average 8 percent meat
price increases, effective Thursday.
   Better quality meat products are affected, including ham, which
will increase by 12 cents per pound, PAP said.
   The increases are aimed at reducing state price subsidies for
meat, Mlynarczyk said.
   In state-operated butcher shops, meats are rationed and supplies
of better quality cuts are erratic. The government has talked of
eliminating meat-rationing. Some products have been seen recently in
state-run specialty stores available at much higher prices but
without ration coupons.
   Meat also is sold at high prices in private markets.
   Walesa's rally Wednesday in Stalowa Wola was one in a series he
has held to build support for talks with the government and to
inform followers on the progress of the talks.
   Machinery factory workers in the industrial town struck during
the labor unrest in May and August. On Tuesday, Walesa was in the
coal region of Silesia to address miners whose work stoppage began
last August's wave of strikes.
   Local authorities granted permission for the Stalowa Wola rally
and march, and Walesa was greeted by posters bearing his portrait
and followers chanting ``Solidarity must be!''
   A flare-up of strikes began after round-table talks started. Only
one, by textile workers in Ozorkow, appeared to be led by Solidarity
supporters. The others were led by OPZZ or could not be linked with
any specific union.
   Various strikes were reported in Zdunska Wola, Starachowice,
Bilgoraj, Szczecin, Piotrkow Trybunalski, Lask, Sieradz, Lodz,
Ostrow Swietokrzyski, Ciechanow and Lublin.
   PAP said health service workers in Poznan decided to suspend a
strike for the duration of the round-table talks.
   Walesa asked workers not to strike during the talks to give the
discussions a chance to produce results.

   Nicaraguan rebel leaders
Wednesday criticized the Central American summit agreement that
would dismantle their movement, and they insisted they must be
included in negotiating their own future.
   Leaders of the guerrillas known as Contras also said they felt
abandoned by the United States, which one called ``a bad ally, not a
trustworthy ally.''
   The agreement announced Tuesday by five Central American
presidents calls for disbanding the Contra guerrillas and for early
elections in Nicaragua. But the presidents still face two major
tasks: getting the rebels and their U.S. sponsors to go along with
the accords, and verifying Nicaraguan compliance.
   ``A lot of people put themselves out on a limb by signing this,''
Contra leader Adolfo Calero said Wednesday.
   Presidents Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, Jose Azcona Hoyo of
Honduras, Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala and
Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador said they agreed to develop a
plan within 90 days to demobilize and dismantle the 11,000-strong
Contra army.
   Ortega also promised to advance national and local elections from
November 1990 to February of that year and open the electoral
process to the opposition. He said he would permit United Nations
observers, but the presidents were unable to agree on a verification
procedure.
   The two major components of the accord were presented as
unilateral agreements. Nicaragua's promise to hold elections does
not formally depend on what happens to the Contras, although
Sandinista spokesmen made it clear they expect the Contras to be
gone by the time electoral reform begins.
   Neither the United States nor the rebels are parties to the
accord, although neither rejected it outright.
   ``We are neither rejecting nor enthusiastically promoting this
action,'' Calero said.
   The accord left the Contras isolated diplomatically and
psychologically in Central America, but it was not known what would
happen if the rebels refuse to go along with the plan to dismantle
their camps.
   An estimated 11,000 fighters and several thousand family members
are in Honduras along the border with Nicaragua, many of them vowing
to fight on. They ran out of ammunition and moved into the camps
after the United States suspended military aid last February.
   The Honduran army would have a difficult time ejecting the
battle-hardened guerrillas by force, and Honduras fears ending U.S.
humanitarian aid would leave a hungry horde on the loose.
   ``We are well and alive,'' Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros
insisted during the summit. ``We are a very real ghost.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman had no
comment on the summit meeting except to say U.S. officials will be
interested in consulting with the four Central American countries
friendly to the United States.
   He said no consultations with Nicaragua are planned, consistent
with the Reagan administration's policy of avoiding diplomatic
contact with the Sandinista government.
   Arias noted the importance of the U.S. reaction after the summit
ended.
   ``It is the responsibility of the international community _ but
above all of those who for many years sponsored the Contras _ to
find a solution to this problem,'' Arias told a news conference.
   Contra spokesmen were bitter toward the United States, saying
Washington had abandoned them despite their sacrifices and the 8,000
dead they have suffered.
   ``The U.S. has not lived up to its responsibility to us, to our
dedication,'' Calero said.
   ``The United States is a bad ally, not a trustworthy ally,'' said
Calero, a soft-drink distributor in pre-revolutionary Nicaragua.
``But of bad allies, it was the least bad.''
   Matamoros said in a separate interview that ``if we had to do it
over again, we would look for support from China (Nationalist China,
or Taiwan), or some other reliable country.''
   Calero said that ``whether it likes it or not, the United States
is deeply involved in what's happening'' and should monitor the
accord, using ``coercive force'' if need be to make sure the
Sandinistas live up to their promises.
   ``The United States must either assume its responsibility or give
us more military aid to keep going,'' he said.
   Both the Contras and President Bush have said peace would come
when Nicaragua became a democracy. Contra military leader Enrique
Bermudez said dismantling the Contras would remove any incentive for
democratization.
   ``If we take these promises as the foundation, if they serve to
dismantle us, then the Sandinistas will be there forever,'' he said.
   The Sandinistas clearly expect the Contras to be gone before
Ortega's summit promise of open, early elections is fully tested in
February 1990.
   The Sandinistas said they were ready for democratic reform
because the Contras had been defeated both politically and
militarily.
   Bermudez and Calero said the rebels could resume their fight from
Nicaraguan soil if they are no longer welcome in Honduras.
   ``Leaving Honduras is one thing,'' Calero said. ``Dismantling is
another.''
   Calero estimated the cost of disbanding the Contras at between
$150 million and $250 million and said the United States should take
in former Contras who want to live there.
   ``Like the Vietnamese,'' he said. ``The U.S. has done that before
with abandoned allies.''

   Three years after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster,
cancer rates have doubled among residents of a contaminated farm
region and calves are being born without heads and limbs, a
newspaper said Wednesday.
   ``My daughter recently got married. What kind of grandson will I
have?'' the weekly Moscow news quoted one woman as saying.
   It said authorities drastically underestimated the health
problems caused by the reactor explosion and fire April 26, 1986,
which sent a cloud of radiation around the world.
   Moscow News said more than half the children in the Narodichsky
region of the Ukraine have illnesses of the thyroid gland, which
exposure to radiation can cause.
   Elevated levels of cesium 137 were detected among many residents
of the region, an agriculturally rich area which is within 30 miles
of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and was not evacuated after the
accident. Thirty-one people died as the immediate result of the
disaster.
   ``Health officials of the republic insist there is no health
danger for people outside a 30-kilometer (19-mile) zone around the
atomic power station,'' Moscow News said. The danger zone was
declared soon after the accident.
   Soviet officials have said repeatedly that radiation levels are
safe except in the zone, and generally have discounted warnings from
some Western doctors of dramatic increases to come in cancer and
some other diseases.
   The Moscow News article was the second in the Soviet press this
month to suggest growing health problems because of Chernobyl.
   In a report Feb. 9, the official news agency Tass said cancer and
other diseases are increasing in Byelorussia, which is just north of
the Ukraine. Tass said authorities determined one-fifth of the
Byelorussian republic was contaminated.
   Moscow News said lip, mouth and other cancers doubled among
residents of the Narodichsky region since the accident.
   It quoted veterinarian Peter Kudin of the Petrovsky Animal Farm
as saying 37 pigs and 27 calves were born with defects in the year
after Chernobyl and the numbers for the first nine months of 1988
were 41 and 35.
   ``The calves (were) frequently without heads, limbs, eyes or
ribs, the pigs goggle-eyed or with deformed skulls,'' he said. Kudin
said only three defective pigs were born at the farm before the
accident and no abnormal calves.
   According to Moscow news, animals at the farm had been feeding on
fields to which winds had carried radioactive particles.
   ``Clean'' meat and dairy products are brought to the region for
residents, but some who ignore warnings drink milk from local cows
and pick fruit and vegetables from their gardens, the newspaper said.
   Vladimir Kolinko, the Moscow News correspondent who wrote the
article, said if the government is serious about its pledges to make
things right, residents ``would have the right to demand ... full
compensation ... not to mention the right to full information about
people's health and the condition of the land.''

   The ability of mental health workers to
cope with sexual abuse is being questioned following the discovery
that youngsters at a children's psychiatric center had turned the
place into a sexual playground.
   A state investigation uncovered 64 instances of sexual activity
involving 47 children from November 1987 to July 1988 at the Western
New York Children's Psychiatric Center. The children, most of them
ages 5 to 12, had sex with each other while administrators looked
the other way, according to the report by the watchdog commission
that investigated the facility in this Buffalo suburb.
   Chairman Clarence Sundram said the panel determined that
administrators considered the sexual activity normal and did nothing
to stop it.
   State Mental Health Commissioner Richard Surles called the
findings ``morally offensive'' and ``inexplicable.'' He promised
reforms at the facility and a review of the state's four other child
psychiatric hospitals.
   Experts in child abuse said the case has revealed an
extraordinary inability of mental health workers to deal with sexual
abuse.
   Jen Henry, an expert on treating sexually abused children who was
brought in to assist the West Seneca staff, said sexual abuse has
become a major topic of general concern only in the past 10 years.
   ``The training of mental health professionals has not caught
up,'' said Henry, who noted that victims of sexual abuse can become
child abusers as adults if they do not receive treatment.
   For example, she said, most of the center's personnel who worked
closely with the children had only associate's degrees in social
work and were not required to take courses on how to recognize
sexual abuse.
   The scandal was revealed only after the parents of an 8-year-old
who had been sodomized several times by his 12-year-old roommate
refused to accept administrators' explanations that the behavior was
normal.
   The couple told police the boy had been disciplined for
complaining about the situation. Police later confronted
administrators.
   ``We had to inform them that sex between children is a crime,''
said Lt. Allen Scioli of the police juvenile division. ``They were
of the opinion there was nothing for the police to investigate.''
   After an initial police probe, the state commission investigated.
   ``Thank God they (the parents) persisted and were able to bring
their complaints to a place where could be dealt with,'' Sundram
said.
   The couple, who had sent their son to the facility because he was
hyperactive, are suing the state.
   Several top administrators who have resigned or been reassigned
have since acknowledged errors in judgment in not reporting the
incidents.
   C. Richard Orndoff, regional director of the state Mental Health
Department, defended the staff.
   ``It wasn't that they were callous or didn't care,'' Orndoff
said. ``They tried to address the problem clinically'' in group
therapy and in counseling.
   Dr. Kathleen Fowler, a child abuse researcher at the University
of Michigan, said most institutional health workers have little or
no training in handling sexual incidents. Staff members often
discount children's accounts of sexual situations because youngsters
sometimes tell stories to get attention.
   But the stories are sometimes true, said Fowler, who is
investigating a case in a similar facility in Michigan where a boy
was sodomized by 14 others.
   While sexual activity between children is definitely not
``normal,'' it is not unusual for children who are the victims of
sexual abuse to act out the abuse on each other, she said. She said
it is up to administrators to check a child's background and be
aware of possibly dangerous behavior patterns.
   State officials estimate that up to 75 percent of the children
that were at the West Seneca facility may have been sexually abused.
   Among the revelations was that children at the facility formed a
sex club variously called the ``GI Joes'' or the ``Transformers''
that required members to engage in oral and anal sex as an
initiation rite.

<HEAD>Vatican Warns Its Radio on Broadcasts to Czechoslovakia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican rebuked its radio station
Wednesday for some of its broadcasts to Czechoslovakia, apparently
in hopes of resolving a dispute over the choice of Roman Catholic
bishops in that communist country.
   The nature of the broadcasts was not disclosed, but Vatican
sources said they involved a report on a demonstration for religious
freedom in Bratislava last year and one about events in
Czechoslovakia at the end of World War II.
   Spokesman Joaquin Navarro expressed the Vatican position in a
statement about a visit last month by Vladimir Janku, the
Czechoslovak official in charge of church affairs.
   In talks with Archbishop Francesco Colasuonno, special envoy to
Eastern Europe for Pope John Paul II, Janku complained of ``attacks
on Czechoslovakia'' in Vatican Radio programs, Navarro said.
   He said the ``Holy See confirmed its desire of arriving with
Czechoslovak authorities at a correct dialogue made with good will
toward resolving the problems regarding the Catholic church and in
particular the nominations of bishops.''
   Navarro said the two sides agreed the radio should keep its
broadcasts about Czechoslovakia ``in harmony'' with the Holy See's
attitudes toward that country.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Navarro's
statement would be broadcast back to Czechoslovakia.
   Relations between the Vatican and Prague have been cool because
of Czechoslovakia's intolerance toward believers and refusal to
accept bishops who do not belong to the pro-government Pacem in
Terris organization.
   Some improvement occurred last year, with the approval of two
auxiliary bishops for Prague and an apostolic administrator in
Trnava, but nine of the 13 sees still do not have Catholic bishops.

   Terrorists killed at least 49 people
and police killed seven on Wednesday during Sri Lanka's first
parliamentary elections in 11 years, authorities said.
   One victim of the terrorists was a Cabinet minister's son.
Another was a cyclist seen lying dead in the road, shot from a
passing car minutes after he voted.
   Extremist gangs attacked election officials and assaulted several
polling places with bombs and gunfire, wounding at least 20 people,
authorities reported.
   The government announced a nationwide overnight curfew beginning
at 9 p.m. ``in order to assist security forces to implement law and
order.''
   Election officials said about 65 percent of the 9.3 million
eligible voters cast ballots despite the violence and threats of
intimidation from Sinhalese and Tamil extremists. Only 55 percent
voted in the presidential election in December.
   Nine political parties and 10 independent groups competed for the
225 seats in the new Parliament. Results were expected Thursday.
   Police blamed terrorists of the Sinhalese majority for 47
killings, including that of Jayantha Mallimarachichi, whose jeep was
ambushed in a Colombo suburb. His father Weerasinghe is fuel
minister.
   Officials said police killed seven Sinhalese who attacked polling
stations and two people were reported killed by Tamil terrorists in
northern Sri Lanka, stronghold of the ethnic minority.
   Sinhalese extremists began an anti-government campaign in July
1987 and opposing the elections was part of it.
   They say the government has given too much to Tamils rebels, who
seek an independent homeland in the north and east, in an attempt to
end the ethnic civil war that has taken at least 8,500 lives since
1983.
   Tamils, who are predominantly Hindu and make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people, claim discrimination by the Sinhalese,
most of whom are Buddhist. The Sinhalese, 75 percent of the
population, control the government and military.
   More than 1,500 have been killed in the backlash from extremists
in the Sinhalese community, and elections had been postponed because
of the ethnic warfare.
   Most of the violence Wednesday was in the southern and central
regions, the Sinhalese heartland of this island off the tip of
India, which was renounced for tranquil beaches, gemstones and tea
before the ethnic warfare began.
   Voting was brisk in Colombo, but most merchants closed their
shops in case of trouble.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa, elected in December, predicted
victory for his United National Party, which held 139 of the 168
seats in the last Parliament.
   ``We have given maximum protection to the voters,'' he told
reporters on a 500-yard walk to a voting station from his official
residence in central Colombo.
   He was followed by hundreds of cheering supporters dressed in
caps and vests of green, the party color.
   Voter turnout was fairly high in urban areas, election officials
said, but threats from Sinhalese extremists left polling places in
many rural districts nearly deserted.
   P. Sydney Fernando, a Sinhalese in Dibbeddi village, 20 miles
south of Colombo, said ``I am scared to vote'' because a bomb
wounded at least six people earlier in the day at the Dibbeddi
voting station.
   Few vehicles were on the winding roads of the southern hill
coutry. Soldiers in camouflage uniforms stopped passers-by for
random searches.
   Police said the 56 known victims were shot or stabbed to death in
a series of incidents. Five people, including three women, were
killed by gunmen who riddled a car carrying members of the governing
party in a Colombo suburb.
   Sinhalese militants killed a soldier and two election officials
in an ambush of their jeep near Bandarawela, 80 miles east of
Colombo, police reported.
   They said the bodies of 11 Sinhalese men were found in central
Anuradhapura and Kandy districts and at least seven bodies were
found in southern Matara district.
   In Mahiyangane district in central Sri Lanka, five election
officials were reported missing after their two jeeps and ballot
boxes were found burned.

   Angry survivors of the 1984 gas disaster
that killed more than 3,300 people accused the Indian government
Wednesday of settling too cheaply with Union Carbide Corp.
   As part of a settlement reached between Union Carbide and the
Indian government, the Supreme Court of India on Tuesday ordered the
U.S.-based multinational company to pay $470 million in compensation
for the death and injury caused by the lethal cloud of gas that
seeped out of a storage tank at the Bhopal pesticide plant operated
by its Indian subsidiary.
   ``We have often been promised money, but for us it was more
important that those who killed our brothers and sisters should be
hanged,'' said 15-year-old Sunil Kumar, whose parents and five
brothers and sisters died in the world's worst industrial disaster.
   Kumar and a younger brother still live in the hut in the Jai
Prakash shantytown where they were asleep with the rest of their
family when methyl isocyanate escaped from a storage tank in the
Union Carbide plant across the street on Dec. 3, 1984.
   Soon after the disaster, the government awarded the boys about
$5,833. It gave out $833 for each immediate family member who
perished.
   Similar payments were made to relatives of hundreds of other
victims, but the major battle for compensation was waged in Indian
courts for four years. In 1986, after U.S. courts declined
jurisdiction in the case, the government of India sued Union Carbide
for $3 billion.
   Tuesday's court decision for $470 million was received with anger
by many survivors and the Bhopal political activists who had
espoused their cause.
   ``We want justice!'' a crowd of 200 women chanted Wednesday
outside government buildings in Bhopal, a city of 1 million people
in central India.
   ``The government has shaken hands with Union Carbide, whose hands
are dipped in the blood of our brothers and sisters!'' one cried.
   Another woman reminded the crowd of the Jan. 6 executions of two
Sikhs convicted in the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi. ``Two people were hanged for killing one woman,'' she said.
``No action was taken against those who killed thousands.''
   The crowd responded by chanting: ``Hang Anderson!'' It was a
reference to Warren Anderson, the chairman of Union Carbide at the
time of the disaster.
   The Supreme Court threw out all criminal charges pending in the
case, including one of culpable homicide against Anderson.
   More than 2,000 people died almost immediately when the gas
leaked from the plant operated by Union Carbide of India Ltd.
   Deaths attributed to the gas continue at the rate of at least one
a day, according to the government of Madhya Pradesh state. The toll
has reached at least 3,329.
   More than 20,000 people are still listed as gas victims,
suffering from shortness of breath, eye problems and other ailments.
   The Indian government and the Danbury, Conn.-based Union Carbide
came close to an out-of-court settlement in November 1987 _ for
about $500 million, $30 million more than this week's court-ordered
payment.
   To many in Bhopal, Tuesday's agreement smacked of collusion.
   ``This shameless settlement shows that the multinationals have
not just the support of the Indian government but also of the
highest court in the land,'' said Alok Pratap Singh, a leader of the
Poisonous Gas Episode Struggle Front.
   Attorneys for the government and Union Carbide said the
settlement was fair and just, and it would enable compensation to be
given to the victims.
   There has been no word on how the funds would be distributed.
   In 1987, a tentative plan was drawn up to pay compensation to
relatives of the dead and to gas-affected survivors. In addition,
continuing free medical care would have been provided, disabled
survivors _ many of them manual laborers no longer able to perform
physically taxing jobs _ would have been retrained for new work, and
restitution would have been made for business and environmental
losses, including dead livestock.
   On Wednesday, the Supreme Court said Union Carbide and its Indian
subsidiary must pay the $470 million by March 23, instead of by
March 31 as ordered Tuesday. This was done because India's fiscal
year ends March 31.
   The court Wednesday also agreed to a proposal by Union Carbide
that its Indian subsidiary pay part of the settlement.
   Union Carbide Corp. will be responsible for $425 million of the
settlement. The court said it will have to pay only $420 million
because of a $5 million emergency payment the company made in 1985
under orders from a U.S. court.
   The subsidiary, Union Carbide of India Ltd., must pay the
remaining $45 million. Union Carbide Corp. owns 50.9 percent of the
Indian subsidary. Indian shareholders, including government
institutions, have the remaining 49.1 percent.
   This division should enable the parent company to make payment
without financial complications. It has already set aside $200
million for the settlement and has insurance covering an additional
$250 million, according to James Wilbur, a vice president with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham and Co. Inc. in New York.
   The Indian subsidiary said Wednesday it would meet its obligation
primarily through the sale of a chemical and plastic plant in Bombay.

<HEAD>Heavy Rains, Flooding Continues In Several States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy rains caused flooding Wednesday in Tennessee, Kentucky,
Illinois and Indiana and flood watches were posted in a number of
other states.
   Nearly 9 inches of rain has soaked parts of western Kentucky
since Sunday, forcing hundreds of evacuations.
   In Frankfort, the Kentucky River had reached 4.6 feet above flood
stage by Wednesday afternoon, state officials said. The Barren River
was expected to crest about 5 feet over flood stage at Bowling
Green, Ky., on Thursday.
   Many small streams in southern Illinois and southern Indiana
flooded Wednesday morning. In Ohio, the Scioto River was flooding
and a flood warning was posted Wednesday for the West Virginia
counties of Cabell, Wayne and Mason.
   Flood watches remained in parts of Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana,
Illinois, Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas.
   In the southern Atlantic, a tropical disturbance sent heavy rains
and gusty winds toward Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The
hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, putting the tropical
disturbance well beyond the normal bounds of tropical weather.
   ``Of course, we've had hurricanes in March, but this is not at
that stage yet. It's still just an area of disturbed weather
associated with a low-pressure system,'' said Bob Sheets, director
of the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   Winter weather advisories were posted in parts of Illinois, New
York, Idaho, and Vermont. A snow advisory was posted in northeast
Washington state.
   Snow fell Wednesday in northern New England, northeast New York
state, Michigan, northern Indiana, central Illinois, the Dakotas,
eastern Montana, eastern Nebraska, Colorado and northern New Mexico.
There was freezing rain in parts of Oklahoma, Missouri, Pennsylvania
and New York state.
   Snowfall during the 6 hours ending at 1 p.m. EST included 2
inches at Burlington, Vt., and an inch at Bismarck, N.D., Buffalo,
N.Y., Chicago, Grand Rapids, Mich., Peoria, Ill., and Syracuse, N.Y.
   Rainfall during the same period included 1} inches at Fort Knox,
Ky., and almost an inch at Fort Campbell, Ky.
   Several cities in the South broke high temperature records for
the date including Augusta, Ga., 82; Cape Hatteras, N.C., 72;
Charleston, S.C., 81; Chattanooga, Tenn., 77; Greer, S.C., 74;
Huntsville, Ala., 74; Lynchburg, Va., 76; Mobile, Ala., 80; Norfolk,
Va., 79; Pensacola, Fla., 76; Roanoke, Va., 78; Richmond, Va., 82;
and Savannah, Ga., 82.
   The nation's low Wednesday in the Lower 48 was 29 degrees below
zero at Warroad, Minn.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 13
degrees below zero at International Falls, Minn., to 86 degrees at
McAllen, Texas.
   Thursday's forecast called for snow showers from north-central
Kentucky across central Ohio to west-central Pennsylvania. Snow was
expected to become rain from southern New England across Maryland
and west across the Appalachians, from northern Georgia across
Arkansas, Oklahoma and northern Texas. Showers and occasional
thunderstorms were to reach from southeast Texas across Louisiana,
southern Mississippi and central Alabama. Snow was to extend from
the northern Rockies across the Pacific Northwest and change to rain
along the northern Pacific Coast.
   Predicted high temperatures were: single digits from the northern
Rockies across North Dakota; single digits and teens over northern
Maine, Upper Michigan, Wisconsin across the upper Mississippi
Valley, South Dakota, northern Wyoming and western Montana; 20s and
30s from the central half of New England across the Ohio Valley, the
remainder of the Great Lakes, the middle Mississippi Valley, the
central Plains, Oklahoma, Texas, the remainder of the Rockies, the
Pacific Northwest and the northern coast of Washington; 40s and 50s
from southeast New York state across Delaware and Maryland, much of
Virginia, western Tennessee, Arkansas, northern Texas, southern
Rockies and the Pacific Coast from central Washington through
central California; 80s from southeast Louisiana across Florida.
High temperatures will generally be in the 50s and 60s in the
remainder of the nation.

   An investigation found no criminal wrongdoing
or negligence by police officers in the death of a suspected drug
dealer that touched off two nights of disturbances, prosecutors said
Wednesday.
   The Hillsborough State Attorney's Office concluded that the Feb.
1 asphyxiation of Edgar Allen Price, who was black, was accidental,
Assistant State Attorney John Skye said.
   Two officers were put on administrative leave while prosecutors
reviewed the case, amid racial sensitivities heightened by three
nights of rioting last month in Miami sparked by the fatal police
shooting of a black motorcyclist.
   Police Chief Austin C. McLane said he was not surprised that no
charges were filed. He said his officers properly restrained the
battling Price with handcuffs and leg ropes.
   A police department internal review of the officers' actions has
not yet been completed and was not expected for a couple of weeks.
   Eight police officers subdued the 6-foot-3, 300-pound Price in a
violent struggle after an informant made a crack cocaine buy in
College Hill, a predominantly black housing development.
   The officers hogtied the 40-year-old Price and placed him face
down in the back seat of a police cruiser, authorities said.
   Before paramedics could arrive to tend to a cut on the suspect's
head, rock- and bottle-throwing erupted. An officer drove the patrol
car to a parking lot a couple blocks away, where police noticed
Price was having trouble breathing. He died at a hospital two hours
later.
   The medical examiner's office said the restraint following the
exertion of the struggle figured into Price's death.
   ``By being placed in a limited space with the head face down into
the back seat associated with limited activity from being handcuffed
and restrained, the necessary conditions for producing an asphyxial
death existed,'' Dr. Charles Diggs, associate Hillsborough medical
examiner, said in a report released Friday.
   Diggs said the way Price was manacled is normally ``relatively
innocuous.'' Police said the medical examiner's report showed that
Price was not beaten or choked to death by officers.
   At least 10 people were arrested in the two nights of
disturbances, and five officers received minor injuries. A grocery
store was looted and torched.
   Price served 11 years of a 50-year prison sentence in Texas for
attempted murder of a Houston police officer and a string of
robberies. He was paroled in 1984 and came to Tampa in 1986, police
said. His girlfriend said Price worked as a long-distance trucker
and laborer.
   Arvida Marion, grandmother of Price's girlfriend, who was in her
house when Price and a band of officers came crashing in, said she
believed prosecutors never had any intention of filing charges.
   ``I'd knew they wouldn't do nothing to those cops,'' Ms. Marion
told The Tampa Tribune. ``But you'll be hearing from me again. This
ain't over yet.''
   ``They didn't need to tie him like a wild horse,'' she said.
   Police reported streets in the College Hill area were quiet early
Wednesday night and no extra patrols were called out, said Officer
John Newman.

<HEAD>Parties to Talk with Guerrillas, Bomb Injures Two</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political parties on Wednesday
agreed to meet with leftist guerrillas to discuss a rebel proposal
to postpone and participate in this year's presidential elections.
   A bomb destroyed an opposition union's offices and injured two
people, and a union leader said leaflets found at the scene claimed
claimed responsibility for a right-wing death squad.
   Also Wednesday, guerrillas accused the army of attacking a rebel
field hospital on Monday, killing three patients, two nurses and a
doctor. The army denied the charge but said it killed eight
guerrillas in combat in the same area.
   Despite the parties' willingness to talk with the rebels, the
government, armed forces and the right-wing party leading in polls
for the upcoming vote have virtually ruled out any postponement of
the vote.
   ``The main parties don't really want to talk with the (rebels).
But no one wants to be the one to give the definitive `No,''' said
Mario Aguinada of the leftist Democratic Nationalist Union.
   Aguinada spoke to journalists after the announcement that
representatives of El Salvador's 13 parties were willing to meet
with a delegation of the guerrilla command next week in Mexico,
Guatemala or Costa Rica.
   The parties left site selection up to the rebels.
   The insurgents said previously they would come to San Salvador to
talk, but it was not known if they would be willing to take part
outside the country.
   The parties, in a communique, suggested the meeting take place
Monday.
   Rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN,
proposed last month that the presidential election scheduled for
March 19 be postponed until September.
   The guerrillas said they would respect the outcome of the vote if
it were put off and security and anti-fraud conditions were met.
They had rejected as a ``farce'' the previous five national
elections this decade.
   The rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, is
favored to win the March election. It is staunchly against any
postponement, which would have to be approved unanimously by all
parties.
   The bomb that ripped apart an opposition union's offices on
Wednesday also damaged six nearby homes.
   Humberto Centeno, a leader in the National Union of Salvadoran
Workers, said the self-proclaimed Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez
Front claimed responsibility for Wednesday's blast in leaflets left
at the site.
   The leaflet warned that the group would ``not rest until it
exterminates communists ... and those groups and people who help the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.''
   When U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle was in El Salvador earlier
this month, he complained about the re-emergence of death squads.
   The new group takes its name from Hernandez Martinez, a
conservative Salvadoran president from 1932-44.
   The rebel Radio Venceremos said troops of the elite Atlacatl
battalion attacked the field hospital Monday. It said the three
women killed _ two nurses and a Mexican doctor _ also were raped.
   But Col. Galileo Torres told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview, `There was no hospital there.'' He said Atlacatl troops
killed eight guerrillas in an ambush, and recovered a radio, several
rifles and explosives from the rebels.

   The brotherly love of ``Rain Man,''
the racial brutality of ``Mississippi Burning'' and the sexual
intrigue of ``Dangerous Liaisons'' added up Wednesday to 22 Academy
Award nominations.
   All three dramas were nominated for best picture, as were ``The
Accidental Tourist,'' an adaptation of Anne Tyler's novel about the
heartbreaks and romances of a travel writer, and ``Working Girl,'' a
corporate Cinderella story about a secretary on Wall Street.
   ``Rain Man'' got eight nominations, the most of any film for the
61st Academy Awards, continuing a remarkable journey for a movie
that went through months of delays and rewrites. Among the nominees
was Barry Levinson, the fourth director of the drama of a
self-absorbed car dealer (played by Tom Cruise) learning to love his
autistic brother (Dustin Hoffman).
   ``I'm happy for Barry Levinson, the film and everybody connected
with it,'' said Hoffman, who received his sixth Oscar nomination. He
won best actor in 1979 for ``Kramer vs. Kramer.''
   ``It really was charmed from the beginning,'' said producer Mark
Johnson. ``It was next to impossible to put together the film (in
eight weeks). But there hasn't been a stumble along the way.''
   Sigourney Weaver claimed a rare double nomination for best
actress for ``Gorillas In The Mist: The Adventure of Dian Fossey''
and best supporting actress as a shrewish executive in ``Working
Girl.''
   Also in the best actress competition were Glenn Close,
``Dangerous Liaisons;'' Jodie Foster, ``The Accused;'' Meryl Streep,
``A Cry In The Dark,'' and Melanie Griffith, ``Working Girl.'' Miss
Streep, who won in 1979 for ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' and in 1982 for
``Sophie's Choice,'' now has eight Oscar nominations in 15 roles.
   Facing Hoffman in the best actor race will be Gene Hackman for
``Mississippi Burning,'' Tom Hanks for ``Big,'' Edward James Olmos
for ``Stand And Deliver,'' and Max Von Sydow for the Danish ``Pelle
The Conqueror.''
   Best director nominees included Charles Crichton for ``A Fish
Called Wanda,'' Alan Parker for ``Mississippi Burning,'' Mike
Nichols for ``Working Girl'' and Martin Scorsese for ``The Last
Temptation of Christ,'' a film criticized by religious groups as
blasphemous.
   Nominated for best supporting actress were Joan Cusack for
``Working Girl,'' Geena Davis for ``The Accidental Tourist,''
Frances McDormand for ``Mississippi Burning,'' Michelle Pfeiffer for
``Dangerous Liaisons'' and Miss Weaver for ``Working Girl.''
   Alec Guinness, co-star of ``Little Dorrit,'' received a
nomination for best supporting actor, as did Kevin Kline for ``A
Fish Called Wanda,'' River Phoenix for ``Running On Empty,'' Dean
Stockwell for ``Married To The Mob'' and Martin Landau for ``Tucker:
The Man and His Dream.''
   ``It's a wonderful way to wake, really an incredible way to wake
up,'' said Landau, upon learning that he had received his first
Oscar nomination. ``As a kid in Brooklyn, I dreamed of this. I think
everyone does.''
   There was no apparent backlash against ``Mississippi Burning,''
widely accused of rewriting the history of the 1964 murder of three
civil rights activists and overemphasizing the role of the white law
enforcement agents.
   ``Mississippi Burning'' received seven nominations, as did
``Dangerous Liaisons,'' a drama set in the bedrooms of the elite in
pre-revolutionary France.
   Among other multiple nominees, ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' the
inventive comic blend of animation and live action, drew six
nominations, all for technical achievements. ``Working Girl'' also
collected six nominations, including best original song for Carly
Simon's ``Let The River Run.''
   ``Gorillas In The Mist,'' had five and ``The Accidental Tourist''
and ``Die Hard,'' earned four nominations each. ``A Fish Called
Wanda'' and ``Tucker'' both drew three nominations.
   Among the films and performers attracting little or no attention
from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were ``A Cry In
The Dark,'' ``Bird'' and ``Bull Durham,'' each collecting only one
nomination.
   A record 270 films were eligible this year, and more than 4,600
academy members were given ballots. The awards will be presented
March 29 at a ceremony broadcast on ABC.
   Nominated for best foreign language film were Hungary's
``Hanussen,'' Belgium's ``The Music Teacher,'' India's ``Salaam
Bombay!'' Spain's ``Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' and
Denmark's ``Pelle the Conqueror.''

<HEAD>Union Won't Pull Employees From Plant EPA Says Contaminated</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-N Reactor Anniversary, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A union leader said Wednesday he won't advise
uranium plant workers to stay off the job despite a decision by U.S.
and Ohio environmental protection agencies to keep inspectors away
over safety concerns.
   David Day, president of the 14-union Fernald Atomic Trades and
Labor Council, said he sees no reason for workers to stay away from
the government-owned uranium processing plant.
   The U.S. and Ohio environmental protection agencies announced
Tuesday that they have barred their inspectors from the Feed
Materials Production Center after two people were contaminated with
uranium.
   Day described himself as ``surprised but not shocked'' that
meeting areas at the 38-year-old plant in the Fernald community
might be contaminated.
   He said the union coalition repeatedly has alleged that
urinalysis tests by the plant operator and the U.S. Department of
Energy on uranium-exposed workers are unreliable.
   ``We don't think we can trust the results of those tests. And the
DOE takes too long to give us results,'' Day said.
   The Energy Department plant, on 1,050 acres 18 miles northwest of
Cincinnati, processes uranium for the department's production
elsewhere of nuclear weapons. Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio
operates the plant for the Energy Department.
   Inspector Catherine McCord, a Chicago-based federal Environmental
Protection Agency inspector, said her contamination was through
either inhalation or ingestion.
   She said she would return to the plant after it is satisfactorily
cleaned up. `It's my job,'' Ms. McCord said.
   Ms. McCord is overseeing the plant's cleanup, which is projected
as a 10-year, $5 billion program to remove surface uranium
contamination, thousands of drums and thousands of tons of
contaminated wastes in pits from the plant site.
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, in a statement, said he was ``alarmed
that the federal government has had to pull its inspectors from
Fernald because of unsafe working conditions. It is time for the
federal government to live up to its responsibility to operate a
safe plant.''
   The EPA inspectors were contaminated by radioactive uranium in
mid-December while attending meetings, according to a Feb. 9 letter
to the Energy Department from Valdas Adamkus, U.S. EPA regional
administrator in Chicago.
   ``As of today, U.S. EPA personnel and contractors will not be
going to the U.S. DOE Fernald site until this health risk can be
satisfactorily addressed,'' Adamkus' letter said.
   Lisa Crawford, spokeswoman for the citizens group Fernald
Residents for Environmental Safety and Health, said Wednesday she
found the EPA's announcement frightening.
   ``I just think it lends credit to what we've been saying all
along, that there is a problem there and something needs to be done
about it. I think the EPA made a valid choice,'' Mrs. Crawford said.
   Her group has filed a $300 million lawsuit in U.S. District Court
in Cincinnati against the plant's former operator, National Lead of
Ohio Inc. The group alleges the plant contaminated the environment,
created a health hazard and ruined values of neighboring properties.
   Judge S. Arthur Spiegel ruled this week that the lawsuit, filed
as a class-action on behalf of 14,000 people living within five
miles of the plant, can proceed to trial June 5.
   Westinghouse officials questioned the Energy Department test and
said they are also seeking an independent evaluation. Tests of plant
workers have shown no unusual problems, and Westinghouse considers
its laboratory examinations reliable, company spokesman William H.
Kelley said.

<HEAD>Lawyer Unleashes Clout Against Veterinian Over Dog's Death</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   CHICAGO _ A former Watergate prosecutor unleashed her clout over
the death of a beloved dog, with her former personal lawyer named
special prosecutor to go after the veterinarian who tended her pet,
the vet's lawyers say.
   Hearings by the Professional Regulation Department have been
scheduled against Mell Wostoupal after former prosecutor Jill
Wine-Banks filed a complaint against the veterinarian over treatment
of her dog, Finnegan.
   Ms. Wine-Banks is executive vice president of the American Bar
Association and a former deputy Illinois attorney general.
   Lawyer Ken Ross, who had been gathering information for a
possible lawsuit against the veterinarian, last month was named by
the attorney general's office to handle the licensing case. Ms.
Wine-Banks acknowledged the appointment was at her suggestion, but
says she sees no conflict.
   The general counsel for the regulation department said Wednesday
the appointment by a special prosecutor was rare and was made by the
attorney general's office.
   At issue is the death in December 1987 of Finnegan, a 7-year-old
Dalmatian owned by Ms. Wine-Banks and her husband, Michael Banks.
   An autopsy found a ``fibrous substance'' blocking Finnegan's
intestines was the cause of death.
   Ms. Wine-Banks says when she and her husband took the dog to
Wostoupal, he said Finnegan had just eaten some leaves.
   The animal died several days after he was stricken with symptoms
that included vomiting and a loss of appetite.
   Angry about Wostoupal's diagnosis, Ms. Wine-Banks sought
revocation of his license. The regulation agency issued a formal
complaint and scheduled hearings.
   The veterinarian's lawyers, John Huston and Glen Crick, say the
appointment of a special prosecutor is outrageous, and that Ross's
appointment places him in violation of legal ethics.
   The case arises ``from the same facts and circumstances in which
he privately represents the complaining witnesses,'' they said.
   ``Ken represents the state now. He is going to pursue this to
protect the pet owners of Illinois,'' said Ms. Wine-Banks, a
prosecutor in the Watergate burglary coverup revealed after
President Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign.
   She said she suggested Ross for the job after they became
frustrated that Finnegan's case wasn't moving fast enough.
   ``I did what any citizen should do: I went to the state. I have
faith that the system will work,'' Ms. Wine-Banks said.
   ``I don't know that Jill used clout. My guess is she used a
little yelling and screaming,'' said spokeswoman Jeanne Marie
Schultz in the office of Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan.
   Ms. Wine-Banks said regulation department officials concurred in
Ross's appointment, but Michael Accettura, general counsel for the
agency, said they had no say.
   ``The attorney general's office has the power to tell us Ross was
our man,'' Accettura said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
   Michael J. Hayes, deputy attorney general, said he approved Ross'
hiring for the case Jan. 25 after the regulations agency agreed to
pay his fee.
   Ross said the department will pay him $160 an hour.
   Accettura agreed the appointment of special prosecutors in such
cases is rare, but refused to comment on the alleged conflict of
interest.
   ``That's for the attorney general to decide. They appointed this
individual,'' he said.
   Accettura said hearings before the department's veterinarian
board are scheduled for next month. The agency director will decide
the matter.
   Board members ``will decide whether a violation occurred or not,
and what penalty should apply _ a two-month suspension or
whatever,'' Accettura said. ``They make a recommendation and the
director acts on it.''

   Here are the main points of the
agreement signed Tuesday by the presidents of Nicaragua, El
Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala.
   Nicaragua said it would:
   _ Hold national and local elections 10 months early, by Feb. 25,
1990.
   _ Give opposition parties equal access to the Sandinista-run
radio and television.
   _ Invite international observers to be present during the
campaign and the election.
   _ Free people classified as political prisoners by the
International Commission on Human Rights.
   The five presidents jointly:
   _ Agreed to devise a plan within 90 days to demobilize the
Nicaraguan rebels and relocate the estimated 11,000 Contra fighters
in Honduran base camps.
   _ Decided to continue talks on having the United Nations send
unarmed military observers to Central America to monitor security
issues.
   The accord does not:
   _ Say what will happen if the Contras refuse repatriation or
relocation.
   _ Say when Nicaragua will free political prisoners.
   _ Say whether early elections in Nicaragua mean the presidential
inauguration now scheduled for January 1991 will also be advanced.
   _ Satisfy a demand for international monitoring of all political
reforms called for by an August 1987 regional peace plan.
   _ Directly address major aspects of the regional plan that call
for an end to continuing civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala.
   The reaction:
   _ Opposition political leaders in Nicaragua said the Sandinistas
would try to cheat on their election promises and would have to be
watched closely.
   _ Contra leaders expressed skepticism about Nicaraguan promises
and said they and the United States would have to be involved in
negotiating their future.
   _ The United States said it would not lift a four-year ban on
diplomatic contact with the Sandinistas, and Vice President Dan
Quayle said he did not think the accord was a ``death warrant'' for
the Contras.

<HEAD>Court Suspends Trial Of Indians And American</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has suspended the trial of
two Indian chiefs and a American who were charged with criticizing
Brazil during a trip to the United States, an official said
Wednesday.
   Federal Judge Milton Luiz Pereira on Tuesday halted the trial of
American Darrell Posey and chiefs Kube-I and Paulo Paiakan because
of ``unsound accusations and a lack of just cause,'' Claudia de
Oliveira, an official in the Federal Appeals Court, said by
telephone from Brasilia.
   Kube-I and Paiakan, both of the Kayapo tribe, and Posey, 41, a
native of Henderson, Ky., and an expert on tropical insects, were
accused of breaking Brazil's foreigners law during a trip last year
to the United States, where they denounced the white man's
encroachment upon Indian lands in Brazil.
   Brazilian law prohibits foreigners from making political
statements or interfering in the country's legal affairs.
   The trial caused a sensation in Brazil because it marked the
first time native Indians had been legally considered foreigners.
Legally, Brazil's 220,000 Indians are wards of the state and do not
have the full rights of other citizens.
   Pereira ordered the trial suspended because Kube-I and Paiakan
were found to be ``native Brazilians recognized by the federal
constitution'' and because Posey, a Brazil resident, proved he had
acted solely as a language interpreter when the remarks were made,
de Oliveira said.
   The court's action appeared to be an attempt by the government to
back off the controversial case. De Oliveira would not comment on
why the judge suspended the trial instead of simply throwing the
charges out.
   He said the proceedings could be renewed but the possibility of
that was ``very, very unlikely.''
   The trial began in August in Belem, capital of the northern
Amazon jungle state of Para.
   The Brazilian government charged the Kayapo chiefs and Posey with
illegal political activities after they spoke at Miami's Florida
International University about forest conservation. Posey said he
attended the forum as a friend and interpreter for the chiefs.
   Soon after the forum, environmental groups invited Paiakan and
Kube-I to speak to the World Bank in Washington, where they
criticized deforestation in the Amazon jungle, erosion, mercury
pollution from gold mining, and the construction of hydroelectric
projects that caused flooding in low-lying jungle areas and
displaced Indian tribes.
   Later, the World Bank held back funds for the Xingu hydroelectric
project, which would have inundated an estimated 18.8 million acres
of mostly Indian land.
   Many Brazilian observers credited the Kayapo chiefs with blocking
the project.
   But Posey, also a federal researcher in the Brazilian National
Research Council, said funding had been suspended because of
financing problems with the government power company Eletronorte.

<TEXT>
   Rock Hudson was guilty of ``outrageous
conduct'' in concealing his AIDS diagnosis from his homosexual
lover, a jury ruled Wednesday in awarding him $14.5 million from the
late actor's estate.
   Marc Christian, 35, won $3.5 million more than he had sought in
the case, regarded as a precedent-setting action and watched closely
by lawyers. No similar case has had a like result when the plaintiff
has not developed AIDS.
   Hudson, the handsome Hollywood leading man who kept his
homosexuality a closely guarded secret, died Oct. 5, 1985, at age
58, a few months after his battle with AIDS became public knowledge.
   Christian, who smiled when the verdict was read, has consistently
tested negative for the AIDS virus, but claimed he was entitled to
compensation for the emotional distress he suffered in fear that he
would develop the disease.
   Christian declined to comment when he left the courtroom. A gag
order imposed by Superior Court Judge Bruce Geernaert at the start
of testimony last month remained in effect while the jury decides
punitive damages.
   Geernaert ordered jurors to remain silent when they left the
courtroom and told them they must return Thursday morning to hear
further evidence and deliberate on the question of punitive damages.
   The damages awarded Wednesday were compensatory, meaning they are
to compensate Christian for actual losses. Punitive damages could be
intended to punish the defendants for their actions.
   With attorneys also prohibited from talking to reporters, the
size of Hudson's estate also remained unknown. The value of Hudson's
estate was not disclosed in his will when it was filed in November
1985.
   The will established a trust, and contained no details about the
trust except to say the value of the estate exceeded $10,000.
   The jury ruled that Hudson conspired with secretary Mark Miller
to keep secret the actor's disease to induce Christian to continue
having high-risk sex with Hudson.
   Miller, who also was found liable, didn't visibly react to the
verdict, but leaned over to talk with his attorney.
   One of the 37 questions on a complicated verdict sheet filled out
by the Superior Court jury was: ``Did Rock Hudson engage in
outrageous conduct?'' The jury answered: ``Yes.''
   The jurors also ruled that Christian suffered emotional distress
because he wasn't told about the actor's condition.
   The verdict was viewed as a landmark by Margaret Davis, a Los
Angeles attorney and author of ``Lovers, Doctors and the Law,'' a
book on the legal consequences of transmitting sexual diseases.
   ``The jury is telling America that you have to make full and
complete disclosure if you are aware that you have the disease,''
Ms. Davis said.
   ``It's absolutely a landmark case,'' she said.
   A spokesman for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, Steven Petrov,
said Christian had a right to know that Hudson had AIDS.
   ``We find it a troubling case because it places the entire burden
of safe sex on one individual and not the two,'' Petrov said. ``It
underscores for us again the need for everyone who engages in sexual
activity to take responsibilityy for themselves as well as for their
partners.''
   Christian, who lived with Hudson during the last two years of the
actor's life, testified the couple continued to have high-risk sex
for eight months after Hudson was told he had AIDS in June 1984.
   Christian and his attorney argued the actor had a duty to warn
his lover he had the disease. They accused Miller, one of the chief
beneficiaries of Hudson's will, of conspiring to keep the actor's
disease secret from Christian.
   In a seven-week trial punctuated by detailed testimony about the
couple's sex practices, attorneys for Miller and the Hudson estate
portrayed Christian as a gigolo who took money for sex and had only
a brief relationship with the actor.
   Christian's attorney introduced as evidence sentimental love
letters he received from Hudson to buttress his claim the actor
loved Christian. Witnesses told of spying on Hudson and Christian
while they engaged in homosexual sex.

<HEAD>Government Holds Firm To May 1 Election Schedule; Opposition Angry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders on Wednesday said
they will discuss this week whether to boycott the May 1 elections
set by the new military regime.
   The government of Gen. Andres Rodriguez reiterated on Wednesday
that it would not postpone the balloting despite opposition
contentions that there is not enough time to mount an effective
challenge to the ruling Colorado Party.
   ``Gen. Rodriguez expressed in a clear and final manner his vow to
respect the constitution and its laws,'' Gen. Orlando Machuca
Vargas, the interior minister, told reporters.
   ``If we violate those articles of the constitution at the request
of the opposition, we would also be empowered to violate other
articles.''
   The constitution states that in the event of the death,
disability or resignation of a president, elections must be held
within three months.
   Opposition leaders say Rodriguez deposed President Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner by coup on Feb. 3 so the constitutional clause does not
apply.
   ``This clearly shows the ill will of the provisional
government,'' said Domingo Laino, president of the Authentic Liberal
Radical Party. ``They've already violated the constitution with
cannons.''
   Laino said the National Accord opposition coalition planned to
consider Thursday whether to participate in the elections ``under
the existing conditions, which we believe are not the most
propitious for a clean election.
   ``We're not going to do what we refused to do during the
Stroessner years, which is to participate in electoral farces,''
Laino said.
   Machuca Vargas spoke with reporters following a meeting with
Rodriguez, a 65-year-old cavalry general and the presidential
candidate of the ruling Colorado Party.
   Opposition parties filed a formal request for the postponement of
elections with Machuca Vargas on Monday, saying they needed more
time to organize if they were to have any chance of defeating
Colorado candidates. The minister's official reply still was pending.
   In past elections, opposition parties called for the abstention
or casting of blank votes, and thus few of their leaders and members
are included on voter registration lists.

   A Japanese adventurer attempting the first solo
balloon flight across the Pacific Ocean battled shifting winds and
mechanical problems Thursday as he floated three miles above the
Earth, bound for California.
   By 6 a.m. (4 p.m. Wednesday), balloonist Fumio Niwa was 660 miles
southeast of Yokohama and flying at 35 mph at an altitude of 20,000
feet, said his spokesman, Naoko Higashi.
   Niwa set out before dawn Wednesday from Yokohama, near Tokyo, in
a mammoth blue-and-orange helium balloon. Depending solely on the
power and direction of the wind, he hoped to land in San Diego,
Yokohama's sister city.
   During radio contact early Thursday, Niwa described the 56-foot
helium balloon as ``slightly swollen'' and complained of rising
temperatures in some of his instruments. However, neither problem
was considered serious, Higashi said.
   In radio contact made 2{ hours later, Niwa reportedly said he was
descending to 15,000 feet because the balloon was swelling in higher
outside temperatures.
   Otherwise, there was ``nothing unusual,'' Niwa told Higashi.
   On Wednesday, Niwa said the main compressor that maintains air
pressure inside the tiny gondola broke down, but that his backup
compressor was working well.
   Niwa had planned to move directly into the jet stream at an
altitude of 26,000 feet to cover the 5,000 miles to his target in
four days.
   But he changed his mind after discovering the jet stream was
veering north rather than east, as it normally does, and could push
him toward Alaska.
   His trip may now last six days and he has enough food to last 10,
Higashi said.
   ``He said he's going to hang under the jet stream as he
approaches Hawaii before moving up into the winds,'' Higashi said.
   Niwa said earlier he was staying low by holding on to his ballast
so the balloon would drift farther south before entering the jet
stream.
   After his first half day of flight, he commented: ``All I see is
clouds and the ocean. I have nothing to take a picture of.''
   The temperature inside the unheated gondola, an elongated capsule
measuring 6 feet in diameter, was 56 degrees Wednesday evening and
below freezing on the outside, Higashi said. Temperatures could
plunge to minus 75 at such altitudes.
   For heat, Niwa depends on his flying suit, which has built-in
electric coils powered by batteries charged by solar panels outside
the gondola.
   The gondola also is too small to stand up in and lacks
navigational equipment. Niwa relies on amateur radio reports of his
location, drawn from radio beacon signals.
   In 1981, four men traveled by balloon from Japan to the United
States, but no one has crossed the Pacific alone in a balloon.
   Niwa, 38, has about 1,000 hours of ballooning experience, and he
estimated the flight will cost about $540,000.
   He said money constraints kept him from installing alarms to warn
him of a loss of gas in the balloon or a sudden change in altitude.
   Niwa quit his job at a computer company in November to prepare
for the flight. He hopes to recoup his investment from a book and
public appearances.

   Wildlife agents tried using a floating cage
Wednesday to capture and deport sea lions that have been devouring
salmon, trout and other migratory fish on Puget Sound.
   So far, the sea lions are winning.
   Fisheries experts over the last five years have tried everything
from foul-tasting chemicals to taped sounds of predatory whales to
stop the huge mammals from depleting the fish runs.
   The latest and sixth plan of attack is a floating cage, which was
set just outside a ship canal to help wildlife agents remove the sea
lions for tagging and then take them 250 miles to the Pacific Ocean
off the southwest Washington coast.
   But the sea lions proved to be worthy opponents for the state and
federal government.
   On Wednesday morning, at least a dozen sea lions were crowded
happily into the cage, which was set out several weeks ago to allow
them to become accustomed to it. Unsure if they could handle that
many sea lions, eight wildlife agents yelled and slapped the water
with paddles to scare them away.
   By Wednesday afternoon, two sea lions had been caught. One of the
sea lions, nicknamed Blue Eye because of a cataract on his eye, has
been a problem for three years, said Bob DeLong, marine mammal
biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
   ``We're confident this plan is going to work,'' said Hal
Alabaster of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   But not too confident.
   ``At the very least it'll be a good test of how long it takes
them to get back,'' he said of the plan known officially at NOAA as
Operation Goodbye. ``Some are guessing they'll beat the trucks
back.''
   In recent years, nets and steel barriers at the Ballard Locks,
site of the fish ladder for fish returning to spawn, have led to
failure.
   After sea lions simply swam under and over the net, a lumber
company put up a board that read ``Sea Lions 4, Government 0,''
Alabaster said. ``It was pretty embarrassing.''
   Over the years, the sea lions ignored tape recorded sounds of
killer whales, and fish injected with nauseating chemicals failed to
slacken the sea lions' voracious appetites.
   The feasting sea lions have been the bane of fishermen and others
concerned about the salmon run, but they have delighted residents
and tourists who flock to the Ballard Locks to watch the spectacle
and applaud the frolicking animals.
   This year's run of steelhead was about 1,650 at the fish ladder,
down from about 2,600 last year, officials said last month.
   Seven to nine California sea lions ``hanging around'' the locks
are gulping an average of 14 fish a day each, said Bob Byrne, state
Wildlife Department spokesman.
   In Operation Goodbye, the 300- to 800-pound sea lions will be
taken two at a time to a barge, then to a hangar at the Sand Point
Naval Base on Lake Washington, where they will be tagged and
equipped with radio collars so they can be tracked.
   DeLong said moving a sea lion is like moving a ``leather bag
filled with 600 pounds of rocks.''
   Alabaster said if the sea lions return from Long Beach Peninsula,
the next step might be to transport them all the way back to
California.

   Radical students yelling anti-American
slogans and armed with steel pipes and firebombs attacked a U.S.
cultural center Thursday, injuring at least six policemen, police
said.
   Police said the fighting broke out when scores of students
hurling firebombs tried to storm the Kwangju Cultural Center in
Kwangju, about 180 miles south of Seoul.
   About 300 protesters briefly occupied the center's compound after
driving off police and smashed windows in the building, police said.
They said some firebombs expoded against the wall and roof of the
building.
   The U.S. Embassy in Seoul reported fire damage to furniture and
fixtures in the building, which houses a public library and
dispenses information about the United States. It said staffers at
the center were not hurt.
   Police said they arrested one protester.
   The cultural center in Kwangju has been the target of frequent
attacks by radical students demanding an end to U.S. influnce in
South Korea.
   Several weeks ago the United States acknowledged that it was
considering closing the Kwangju Cultural Center because of repeated
violent attacks and concern for the safety of its staff.
   The center would be the first U.S. facility shut down in the face
of anti-American protests.
   The government apologized publicly after two attacks in January
and appealed to radical students not to damage ties with the United
States.

<TEXT>
   Three senior parliamentarians urged Japan to develop
its own plane after U.S. congressmen criticized an agreement for
joint U.S.-Japanese development of Japan's next jet fighter, a
newspaper said Wednesday.
   The English-language Japan Times said the three told reporters
this week that Japan should consider abandoning an agreement to
develop its future mainstay fighter using technology from the U.S.
F-16.
   It said former Transport Minister Shintaro Ishihara and two other
legislators suggested Japan should go ahead with development of its
own jet fighter, called the FSX.
   ``Since there clearly are disagreements over the accord, they
suggested that the agreement be reviewed and possibly abandoned,''
an aide to one of the legislators said on condition of anonymity.
   Japan orginally intended to build the jet on its own, but U.S.
government officials and aircraft makers urged Tokyo to buy
U.S.-made F-16 jets to help cut Japan's $47.6 billion trade surplus
with the United States.
   After years of talks, the two sides signed a memorandum of
understanding last November under which Mitsubishi Heavy Industries,
Japan's leading defense contractor, would head development of the
FSX using technology from Japan and from General Dynamics, which
produces the F-16.
   Congress will have 30 days to vote against the project after it
is formally approved by the Bush administration.
   The FSX issue surfaced on Feb. 3 during Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita's visit to Washington, where he urged Bush to line up
congressional support for the agreement.
   Last week, 21 senators introduced a resolution declaring ``strong
reservations'' about the deal and urging a 60-day delay to allow
time for a review.
   In Japan, the criticism of an agreement seen as a concession to
the United States led to renewed calls to develop the plane alone.
   Supporters say it's the best compromise possible given Japan's
refusal to buy F-16s from the United States. They say the
arrangement involves beneficial technology exchanges and will
generate employment in both countries.
   American critics say the agreement virtually gives away $7
billion in advanced aircraft technology that eventually could help
Japan compete effectively against the United States in the global
aviation market, a field in which Japan lags.
   Japanese officials said that despite the uproar they hope to go
ahead with the plan. Japan has appropriated $84.2 million in its
preliminary budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1 for FSX
development.
   Initially, 130 of the jets are to be built, with a possible
follow-up order of about 100 more at a cost of $40.5 million each.
Japan reportedly will maintain control over the FSX design and over
any new technology developed.
   General Dynamics would act as a subcontractor to Mitsubishi and
receive about 35 to 45 percent of the work, funded entirely by the
Japanese government.
   Japan's aviation industry has remained small. It relies mainly on
defense contracts, including development of Japan's current jet
fighter, the F-1, and production of F-15 fighters under license from
McDonnell Douglas of the United States.

   Army chief Humberto Regalado
Hernandez on Wednesday criticized remarks attributed to CIA director
William Webster about alleged military conspiracies to topple Latin
American governments.
   ``The armed forces were not created to govern the country, but to
work within the constitution,'' the military chief said. ``For this
reason, we are bothered by a foreigner questioning what we have
denied and repeated.''
   On Feb. 10, Webster was quoted by the Los Angeles Times as saying
Democrats and Republicans in the United States should agree on
undercover work in Latin America because of growing restlessness and
``coup conspiracies'' in the region.
   In the interview, the CIA chief said some fragile Latin American
democracies depend on the military to maintain law and order.
   The Times quoted Webster as saying U.S. Secretary of State James
Baker must confront difficult situations in other parts of Latin
America and mentioned Nicaragua, Honduras, Panama and Haiti as
possible trouble spots. He said military conspiracies exist to
overthrow various governments.
   Regalado said he wants Webster ``to present his proof of who is
conspiring, because if there is someone under my command, then I
would have to take decisions that the situation merited.''
   Honduras' Congress appointed a special commission Tuesday night
of six deputies, belonging to the nation's four active political
parties, to investigate the matter and issue a report in 30 days.
   The group plans to interview U.S. Ambassador Everett E. Briggs
and then key military leaders.
   The Congress mandated the group ``try to discover the truth about
the alleged conspiracy that exists in the country that intends to
change the government.''
   Charles Barclay, spokesman at the U.S. Embassy, said, ``The
United States will continue its constant support to democratic
institutions in Latin America.''
   ``What Webster said is that the administration of President
George Bush will have as its principal policy the strengthening of
democratic Latin America, and he warned that the future of the
region is highly unpredictable because the hemisphere is confronting
serious threats to democracy.''

<HEAD>Rumors Of Impropriety Spur Harvard Business Students To Discuss Honor
Code</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE H. DREYFOUS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethics already is required study for Harvard
University business students, but campus activists said Wednesday
they want an honor code to prevent even the rumor of a breach in
their computerized classrooms.
   ``We're not terrible, amoral people here,'' said Anthony
Antonick, ``If we can come up with some sort of list to go by, I
think people would conform to the rules.''
   Antonick is one of a group of business students that organized in
reaction to recent rumors of borderline behavior during classroom
testing. The students are hoping in the coming months to pool their
opinions and come up with a formal code that the school might
eventually adopt.
   ``There are clearly things that are right and clearly things that
are wrong,'' said Earl Sasser, chairman of the master's degree
program in business administration. ``But where things are less
clear, there is for me the need for some kind of honor code.''
   The 80-year-old business school has left students on their honor,
free to take breaks during exams and remain after the testing period
was up to print out their answers.
   Since the school began requiring students to use personal
computers in the classrooms, questions of impropriety have cropped
up. Is it acceptable for people to exchange diskettes during exams?
Should students be allowed to print out their answers after the
allotted test time is up? If so, would it be cheating to correct a
typographical error?
   When rumors began circulating on campus that there had been some
cheating during final exams, concerned first-year students began
discussions on ethics.
   Antonick said he and others who organized an informal survey
recently were surprised at the disparity among students' opinions of
what might constitute an ethical compromise.
   ``We're looking at not only dos and don'ts of test-taking but
also at issues of what's acceptable in terms of classroom
preparation and participation,'' said Jennifer Raiser, a survey
organizer.
   Last fall, the school's 800 first-year students were required for
the first time to take a three-week course in ethics, spurred in
large part by a $20 million gift from former Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman John Shad.
   But the school's own policy toward cheating and other ethical
questions was not sufficiently clear, Raiser said.
   ``We're trying to draw the line between competitiveness and
fairness,'' Raiser said. ``You can be competitive, but there are
still some guidelines of decency that people can and should abide
by.''

<HEAD>Vatican Attacks Theologians Who Question Birth Control Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican on Wednesday took to task
theologians who question the church ban on contraception and accused
them of sowing confusion among the faithful.
   A front-page editorial in the daily newspaper L`Osservatore
Romano repeated a statement by Pope John Paul II that the ban is not
open to discussion.
   It did not cite anyone by name but mentioned recent remarks by
``one noted moral theologian'' and challenges to the church teaching
by other theologians.
   Last month, a group of 170 German-speaking theologians released a
statement called the Cologne Declaration that strongly criticized
the pope and the ban on artificial birth control.
   The Italian press earlier quoted another German theologian,
Bernard Haring, as attacking one of the pope's advisers on family
issues.
   The editorial responding to criticism carried three asterisks at
the end, the newspaper's way of showing it was authoritative.
   The editorial said married couples having difficulties living up
to the church's teaching for personal, economic or social reasons
deserve ``great respect and love.''
   But it said there was also need to affirm that the moral norms in
Pope Paul VI's 1968 encyclical ``Humane Vitae,'' which barred
aritificial birth control, ``do not allow exceptions.''
   It said this was no ``rigid and intransigent'' interpretation but
has been the ``clear and explicit teaching'' of both Paul VI and
John Paul II.
   L`Osservatore Romano said doubts raised over the Roman Catholic
Church's teaching on the family amounted to a ``concerted and
systematic'' attack by some theologians and lamented what it called
the ``serious confusion and misunderstandings'' caused among the
faithful.
   It repeated remarks by John Paul in June 1987 that ``what is
taught by the church on contraception is not a matter that can be
discussed freely by theologians. To teach otherwise is tantamount to
inducing into error the moral conscience of the married.''

<HEAD>Fan Blade Broke In Engine of Crashed Jet, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fan blade broke in the left engine of a Boeing
737 before the aircraft crashed on Jan. 8, killing 47 people, a
French engine manufacturer was quoted as saying Wednesday.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said it obtained a document being
circulated by the French company SNECMA. It said the document urges
airline companies to check engines similiar to those on the British
Midland Airways jet that crashed in central England.
   SNECMA, which builds the CFM-56 engine with General Electric of
the United States, stripped down both engines from the jet at its
headquarters at Villaroche near Paris.
   The BBC quoted the document as saying a fan blade had broken in
the Boeing's left engine but the cause of the crash still had not
been established.
   Engineers found no evidence of a malfunction in the right engine,
which was shut down by the pilot before the crash, the BBC quoted
the document as saying.
   The accident investigation team's metallurgists were quoted as
saying there was metal fatigue on one fan blade in the left engine.
That fan blade fractured and apparently then pierced the engine's
cowling or outer skin, the BBC said.
   SNECMA was quoted as saying it was not known why the fan blade
fractured in what was a virtually new engine. Nothing similar has
occurred in any other CFM-56 engines during their 5.5 million flying
hours, the BBC said.
   Nonetheless, the BBC said the company recommended that all
airlines using SNECMA engines review their policies and instructions
on the maintenance and repair of the fan blades.

<TEXT>
   The House minority leader, Rep. Robert H.
Michel, R-Ill., said Wednesday he would try to block floor action on
legislation requiring disclosure of foreign owners of U.S. property.
   ``It has very serious implications for the faltering financial
industry and the potential international repercussions are
considerable,'' Michel said in a letter to the House Rules Committee
chairman, Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla.
   The bill, scheduled for floor action Thursday, would require
foreign owners to report sizable holdings in this country to the
federal government.
   Sponsored by Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, the plan started life as
part of the 1,000-page trade bill that was signed into law last year
but was dropped long before the trade measure reached the
president's desk.
   The administration said it would stifle vitally needed foreign
investment and hurt business in a variety of other ways. Bryant said
Americans deserve to know who owns property in this country.
   Michel said the bill, heavily debated last year, should have been
sent to committee again for a fresh hearing before being brought to
the floor.
   ``Having just read the preliminary floor schedule for next week,
I find myself imploring you to `tell me it ain't so,''' said
Michel's letter to Pepper, who as Rules Committee chairman cleared
the way for the vote.
   ``This is a new Congress, a new century of government, with a new
president, new direction and constantly changing public opinions and
circumstances,'' Michel said.
   Wright was en route to Texas and thus had not seen Michel's
letter, according to an aide, Mark Johnson.
   The letter was distributed to reporters by the Republican
leader's office.
   An increase in foreign investment in U.S. property in recent
years has prompted concern on Capitol Hill, although a two-year-old
study by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of
Congress, found that overseas owners still held only a tiny
percentage of American farm land.

   A teen-age girl abducted from her home by a
man answering an ad for a water bed was held handcuffed in a closet
before she escaped and, in a fortunate coincidence, got to meet
President Bush Wednesday on Air Force One.
   Just as strange as the ordeal authorities say the 17-year-old
endured is the story of the kidnapping suspect.
   Richard D. Starrett, 29, was arrested late Tuesday while napping
in his red sports car at a rest stop on Interstate 10 near Houston,
authorities said.
   Starrett has no known criminal record, Lexington County Sheriff
James Metts said, and is an engineer at a federal nuclear weapons
facility, the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C., across the
river from Georgia, his employer said.
   Starrett was barefoot when he awoke to find a 12-gauge shotgun
pointed at him, Trooper Kevin Kennedy said by telephone from Texas.
   ``He didn't really say a whole heck of a lot of anything,''
Kennedy said. ``I asked him if he was Richard Daniel Starrett. He
said, `Yes, I am.'''
   Starrett of Martinez, Ga., was jailed in Houston and was to be
returned to Georgia and South Carolina, said Columbia County, Ga.,
Sheriff Otis Hensley. Starrett was charged in federal and state
warrants with kidnapping, and Georgia authorities added aggravated
sodomy and false imprisonment warrants Tuesday.
   The 17-year-old was abducted from her home in Lexington, S.C., on
Feb. 6. She remained in protective custody Tuesday, when a law
enforcement officer took her to see the presidential limousine that
was flown from Washington to Columbia, S.C., where Bush delivered a
speech Wednesday.
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell said he happened to meet the
teen-ager at the airport, and she expressed an interest in seeing
the president. Campbell, a Republican, told her she could do so at
the airport the next day.
   Bush gave her a presidential pin as a memento of their meeting,
the governor said.
   Bush ``expressed his sympathy for what she went through,''
Campbell said. ``That little girl has been through hell.''
   Authorities said the high school senior was abducted at gunpoint
and held for four days in a house in Martinez, near Augusta, part of
the time handcuffed and in a small closet.
   She escaped last Saturday from the house, which authorities say
Starrett owns. She told authorities she fled when her abductor fell
asleep, running to a neighboring home to call her family.
   Investigators said they seized videotapes from Starrett's house
showing the two together, but they would not elaborate on the
contents. They kept the girl's location secret Wednesday.
   Kennedy said the arrest followed a routine computer check on
Starrett's out-of-state license tag. He said he called for backup
before making the arrest, and added that Starrett had a .38-caliber
revolver between his legs on the car seat when arrested.
   ``He said he had been in Texas, in the Houston area, for three
days,'' Kennedy said, adding that Starrett had no money or credit
cards.
   Metts said an investigation indicated Starrett was having
drinking problems and problems at home and on the job. He said
authorities want to question Starrett in connection with at least
four other South Carolina disappearances, abductions or sexual
assaults that took place after a man answered a want ad.
   Starrett is employed by Bechtel National Inc. of San Francisco, a
contractor at the Savannah River Plant. Company spokesman Rick
Laubscher said Starrett began working for Bechtel in October and was
assigned to SRP for work on the federal government's Defense Waste
Processing Facility.

   Opposition leaders said Wednesday they
are pleased President Daniel Ortega has promised electoral reform
but added that the Sandinistas must be watched carefully or they'll
try to cheat.
   ``President Ortega only talked with the Central American
presidents, but he still needs to talk with the Nicaraguan people,''
said Gilberto Cuadra, president of the opposition Superior Council
of Private Enterprise.
   Ortega announced Tuesday at the end of a two-day regional summit
in El Salvador that Nicaragua will hold early elections, permit the
opposition freedom to campaign and allow United Nations observers
into the country.
   Ortega and the presidents of Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and
Costa Rica also announced they will devise a plan within 90 days to
dismantle the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebel force, known as the
Contras.
   In a nationally televised speech Wednesday night, Ortega went
over the summit points and said his government's willingness to
institute election reform ``shows our political strength which is
rooted in the Nicaraguan people.''
   Miriam Arguello, secretary general of the Nicaraguan Conservative
Party, said in an interview in El Salvador that the opposition will
play watchdog.
   ``We can be sure that the Sandinistas, in spite of their
signature, will do whatever they can get away with to win,''
Arguello said. ``But we will fight to make them comply with their
agreements.''
   Nevertheless, Arguello said, ``The four democratic presidents of
Central America have given the Nicaraguan opposition a weapon that
we can use to say for ourselves who will govern us.''
   Also on Wednesday, the government announced the cordoba's fourth
devaluation this year. Fuel prices automatically increased, and a
rise in the price of basic foods was expected shortly as a result of
the 18.5 percent devaluation of the Nicaraguan currency.
   The leftist Sandinistas have been hurt by the crash of the
Nicaraguan economy, which has resulted in 20,000 percent annual
inflation. They blame most of their problems on a U.S. economic
boycott and the war against the Contras.
   They face an opposition split into at least 14 parties, and
Arguello and others said that advancing the elections by 10 months,
to February 1990, would actually give the Sandinistas an advantage.
   ``We see advancing the elections as a typical Sandinista game.
They look like they are willing to sacrifice time in office, but
they also leave less time for the organization and mobilization of
the parties,'' she said.
   She said the period for organization of parties was short,
``given that the opposition has been repressed, restricted and
terrorized.''
   ``There remains much to discuss in this country,'' Cuadra, whose
council is Nicaragua's largest grouping of businessmen, said in an
interview broadcast by Radio Noticias, an independent private radio
station.
   Jose Antonio Bonilla of a faction of the Social-Christian Party
told The Associated Press that advancing the elections left too
little time for ``the development and adequate organization of the
political bodies.''
   Luis Vega Miranda, an official of another faction of the
Social-Christian Party, called Ortega's promises ``superficial.''
   Upon his return to Nicaragua on Tuesday night, Ortega called the
presidential agreement to dismantle the Contras ``the final blow to
the war.''
   An estimated 11,000 rebels and about 10,000 family members are
living in camps on Honduran territory along the Nicaraguan border.
It remained unclear how the agreement at the summit would directly
affect the Contras.
   Wednesday's devaluation, announced by the Central Bank, raised
the cordoba's official rate of exchange to 3,200 cordobas to the
U.S. dollar, up from 2,700 cordobas to the dollar. Fuel prices also
rose as of Wednesday: the price of a gallon of gasoline went from
5,600 cordobas to 6,700 cordobas.
   In January the cordoba was devalued three times.
   Ortega announced on Jan. 30 an austerity plan for 1989 to combat
inflation. He has said at least 30,000 public employees will be laid
off and many government subsidies will be eliminated.

   A 400-foot luxury liner attempting
to dock in the Port of Palm Beach Wednesday night hit an anchored
Navy ship and tore several holes in the 110-foot vessel, the U.S.
Coast Guard said.
   The accident involving the Viking Princess and the unnamed naval
cargo loading craft at about 7:30 p.m. caused no serious injuries to
passengers or crew, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Jerry Snyder.
   ``It's a very small harbor,'' with only two shipping channels and
a small area where the cruise liners have to turn around, said
Snyder.
   Two Coast Guard utility boats plugged three holes below the Navy
vessel's water line, and minor flooding was quickly brought under
control, Snyder said. No fuel was known to have leaked into the
harbor.
   Some passengers of the Viking Princess were shaken up, but the
crew was able to care for them without assistance, Snyder said.
   The West Palm Beach-based ship, owned by Crown Cruise Lines, was
returning from an all-day Florida coastline cruise, which it runs
three days a week. The other four days a week it sails on a day
cruise to Freeport, Bahamas.
   Five days earlier, the Miami-based Celebration, owned by Carnival
Cruise Lines, sliced a Cuban cargo vessel in two, leaving three
Cuban crew members missing off the Cuban coast. No cruise passengers
were injured.

   Iran on Wednesday placed a $2.6 million bounty on the head of
Salman Rushdie, whose novel ``The Satanic Verses'' has enraged the
world's Moslems. Rushdie dropped from sight and canceled a U.S.
promotional tour due to start Friday.
   Police guarded Rushdie's home and his publishers.
   ``If the executioner is a foreigner he will receive a million
dollars,'' said Hojatoleslam Hassan Saneie, head of the 15th Khordad
Relief Agency, according to the Iranian news agency.
   The reward for an Iranian, however, will be 200 million rials, or
$2.6 million, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Saneie as
saying.
   The Times of London on Thursday quoted a former Pakistani
minister of information and religious affairs, Moulana Kausar Niazi,
as saying death squads from Pakistan and other Moslem states were on
their way to Britain to kill Rushdie, who lives in London.
   Tehran Radio denounced the book as ``a shameless onslaught on the
sacred character of Islam's prophet'' and protesters shattered
windows at the British Embassy in Tehran.
   The radio said Iran's ambassador to the Vatican, Salman Ghaffari,
urged Pope John Paul II to ``seriously oppose'' the publication of
the Italian translation of the book ``and prove that he defends
religion and spirituality.''
   ``With a glance at the writer of this book one may see the hidden
hands of world imperialism and the devious role of arrogance in the
activities of publication agencies which serve it,'' said a Tehran
Radio broadcast monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp.
   About 2,000 noisy protesters appeared at the British Embassy in
Tehran, Charge d'Affaires Nick Browne told BBC-TV, but he said
authorities protected the embassy and the seven people inside.
   ``There was never any question of any of us being in danger,''
Browne said.
   Tehran Radio, monitored by the BBC, reported other protests
Wednesday in Kashan, southeast of the holy city of Qom, and
Firuzukh, east of Tehran.
   Six people were killed and 82 injured when police opened fire
Sunday on demonstrators against the book who stormed a U.S. cultural
center in Islamabad, Pakistan. One person was killed in another
protest Monday in northern India.
   The Times said Moulana led the demonstration in Islamabad and
headed the movement to have the book banned in Pakistan.
   On Tuesday, Tehran Radio quoted Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as
saying Rushdie and his publishers ``are hereby sentenced to death.''
   ``I call on all zealous Moslems to execute them quickly, wherever
they find them, so that no one will dare to insult Islamic
sanctity,'' it quoted Khomeini as saying.
   Rushdie _ a Moslem born in Bombay, India, and educated at
Cambridge _ was reported to be under police guard Wednesday with his
wife, American novelist Marianne Wiggins.
   In New York, spokesman Paul Slovak of Viking Penguin Inc. read a
statement representing ``the agreed joint position by the publisher
Viking and the author Salman Rushdie.''
   It said events in Pakistan and India and threats made against
Rushdie and others ``led us to conclude that the current climate is
not appropriate for a promotional tour in the U.S. as previously
planned.''
   The statement said no offense was intended in writing or
publishing the book and ended, ``It is also our unalterable position
that freedom of speech, freedom to publish and freedom to read must
be guaranteed internationally.''
   ``The Satanic Verses'' has sold more than 100,000 copies since it
was published in Britain in September to critical acclaim.
   At least five countries have formally banned the novel: India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt and South Africa.
   Christian Bourgois, a French publishing house that bought the
rights to the novel, said Wednesday it was delaying publication.
   Britain recently reopend its embassy in Tehran, and the Foreign
Office said Browne was seeking a meeting with Iranian authorities to
clarify the situation.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati told diplomats in Tehran the
government would order the closure of cultural centers of nations
that permit publication of the book, Tehran Radio reported.
   ``There has been no direct impact on ties so far,'' IRNA said
Wednesday, ``but by being the first to allow the book to be
published on its soil, Britain could pay a heavy price for ignoring
the strong sentiments of over 1 billion Moslems worldwide.''
   Mostafa Barzegar, spokesman for Iran's Culture and Islamic
Guidance Ministry, announced a ban on books published by Viking and
other imprints of the Penguin Group, and said Penguin's invitation
to the second Tehran International Book Fair in May has been
canceled, IRNA said.
   Playwright Harold Pinter led a delegation to Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's residence at 10 Downing St. to deliver a letter
denouncing the Iranian threats.
   ``Salman Rushdie lives in this country and must be given full
protection, along with the other people involved,'' said the letter,
whose signatories included authors Fay Weldon, Marina Warner and
Hanif Kureishi, publisher Liz Calder and Stuart Weir, publisher of
the left-leaning New Statesman magazine.
   In The Netherlands, opposition lawmakers appealed to Foreign
Minister Hans van den Broek to cancel a planned trip to Tehran.
   Police were posted outside Rushdie's home and the office of his
publisher, Viking, and Kureishi said Rushdie had gone into hiding.
``He is obviously very frightened,'' said Kureishi. ``These people
are completely nutters,'' said Kureishi, who wrote the script for
the film ``My Beautiful Laundrette.''
   A major character in Rushdie's book is named Mahound, a medieval
corruption of the name of the prophet Mohammed. Moslems have
complained the book represents the prophet's wives as prostitutes
and suggests that he wrote the Koran, rather than receiving it from
God.
   The title refers to verses which Mohammed removed from the Koran,
Islam's holy book, believing they had been inspired by the devil.
   Before he went into hiding, Rushdie expressed no apologies for
his book.
   ``Frankly, I wish I had written a more critical book,'' he said
in an interview with BBC-TV on Tuesday.
   ``A religion that claims it is able to behave like this,
religious leaders who are able to behave like this, and then say
this is a religion which must be above any kind of whisper of
criticism, that doesn't add up,'' Rushdie said.

   A long-delayed summit of five
Central American presidents ended with a promise from Nicaragua to
hold free elections and agreement to dismantle the bases in Honduras
of U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua pledged as the two-day
meeting concluded Tuesday that his leftist government would move up
elections to February 1990 and let the opposition help organize them.
   The presidents also said they would come up with a plan within 90
days for disbanding the Contra force in Honduras _ an estimated
11,000 fighters.
   ``We're ready to return to Nicaragua when we see that Ortega
seriously is going to begin implementing his promises,'' Adolfo
Calero, a member of the Contra directorate, told a news conference.

   The judge in the Oliver North case says that if
the Justice Department is intent on preventing the trial, it should
do so now instead of trying to ``chop up the case'' with constant
censorship demands.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell on Tuesday rejected a Justice
Department bid to suppress evidence which North's lawyers say will
show a Reagan administration coverup of secret attempts to help the
Nicaraguan Contras.
   North's lawyers revealed more of their planned defense on
Tuesday, saying that the Reagan administration offered ``CIA covert
support'' to Central American nations if they would help the Contras
during a period in which Congress had banned U.S. aid.
   The alleged ``quid pro quo'' added a detail to the scenario
outlined earlier this week by North's attorneys, who say Reagan and
other top administration officials ordered that the arrangements be
kept secret.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III says he
will sell his large stock holdings in a major international lender,
after questions were raised about the potential for conflicts of
interest.
   Baker said Tuesday he will sell his stock in Chemical New York
Corp., which has loaned $4.5 billion to Third World nations, as well
as all other publicly traded stocks held in a qualified blind trust.
   Members of Congress had expressed surprise when Baker's stock
holdings were publicized last week, noting that as Treasury
secretary under President Reagan he made decisions affecting the
Third World debt crisis. The same issue confronts him as secretary
of state in the Bush administration.
   Baker's promise to get rid of the stocks was hailed Tuesday at
the White House, where President Bush's ethics chief had questioned
Baker's holdings under a new, stringent interpretation of government
ethics rules.

   Can a nice guy finish first in the rowdy race for
mayor of New York?
   Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins, who announced his
candidacy Tuesday for the Democratic nomination, intends to find
out, in addition to whether he'll be the first black man to hold the
highest office in the nation's largest city.
   The 61-year-old Dinkins has a conciliatory manner that comes up
in political discussions as frequently as his skin color, which
political analysts say could virtually guarantee him 30 percent of
the vote.
   Supporters _ and even opponents like Mayor Edward I. Koch _ use
the same words to describe Dinkins, who now leads all comers,
including the incumbent, in the polls. He's nice. Thoughtful.
Cautious. Courteous. The polite politician.
   In other words, he's no Ed Koch, a combatative candidate known to
shoot from the lip at the slightest provocation.

   A manufacturer's suggestion that American
companies buy foreign-made U.S. flags and replace ``Made in Taiwan''
labels with ``Made in USA'' is causing a small uproar on Capitol
Hill.
   ``In all my years as a member of Congress, few issues have struck
me as being as blatantly outrageous'' as the label-switch proposal,
Rep. Douglas Applegate, D-Ohio, wrote in a letter seeking a Customs
Service investigation.
   Applegate was one of several members of Congress who asked
Customs to look into the issue. The inquiries were triggered by a
letter-writing campaign by domestic flag manufacturers.
   ``I feel we can compete with a U.S. flag labeled `Made in Taiwan'
but we cannot compete with a U.S. flag labeled `Made in USA' when in
fact it wasn't,'' wrote Vane Scott, general manager of the Colonial
Flag Co. in Coshocton, Ohio.
   Scott provided Applegate with a copy of a three-page 1987
solicitation on the letterhead of the Ming Teh Flag Co. Ltd. of
Taipei, Taiwan, which suggested changing ``Made in Taiwan'' labels
after the flag shipments had cleared Customs.

<HEAD>War Created `Necessity' of First Female Ordination in Anglican Communion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 81-year-old woman sat quietly in a waiting
room, her priestly robes gathered about her as she remembered the
perilous journey across war-torn China that culminated with her
ordination in 1944 as the first female priest in the Anglican
Communion.
   The issue was one of pastoral necessity _ no male priest ``dare
run the risk'' of being stationed in Macao, a tiny Portuguese
territory on the southern Chinese coast.
   But the break with 2,000 years of Christian tradition
reverberated thousands of miles away, in England, and in 1946 the
Rev. Florence Tim-Oi Li was given an ultimatum: She must resign or
the bishop who ordained her would be forced to resign.
   ``There's no problem,'' the Chinese woman recently recalled
thinking then. ``I would give up my title. I don't only want the
title.''
   Last week, more than four decades after she acceded to church
pressure to preseve an all-male priesthood, Li helped elevate the
Rev. Barbara C. Harris into the highest echelons of the Anglican
hierarchy.
   ``In my life, I can see the first woman bishop,'' Li said. ``It
made me hopeful. Things are realized now.''
   Harris' triumph refocused attention on the historical role of Li,
who quietly continued her religious work in China after World War II
and through the Cultural Revolution while the battle for female
Anglican priests raged in the United States and elsewhere.
   The Episcopal Church approved female priests in 1976, two years
after 11 women were ``illegally'' ordained in a service in
Philadelphia.
   One of the 11, the Rev. I. Carter Heyward, said it was an
``extraordinarily profound and moving'' experience to be a
concelebrant with Li at the consecration service.
   ``I feel part of a great chain,'' said the Rev. Suzanne R. Hiatt,
another member of ``the Philadelphia 11.''
   While advocates for the ordination of women have often taken
matters into their own hands with lobbying and ``illegal''
ordinations, Li's path to the priesthood was different.
   In ``Much Beloved Daughter,'' his book about Li, Ted Harrison
said she had been working as a priest in all but name in Macao
during World War II when Bishop R.O. Hall made his decision to
ordain her. Nearby Hong Kong had fallen to the Japanese and travel
to Macao had become dangerous as people sought to flee there.
   With male priests denied permission to go to Macao, Li was
authorized to baptize, marry, bury and eventually even distribute
Holy Communion.
   In a letter to the archbishop of Canterbury explaining his
decision to ordain Li, Bishop Hall said, ``Please be sure that my
reason was not theoretical views of the equality of men and women,
but the needs of my people for the sacraments and the manifest gift
of the pastoral charisma.''
   As news of her ordination spread to England, protests mounted
against Hall's unilateral decision to break with church tradition.
   In an interview at Harris' consecration, Li recalled her reaction
when she realized the uproar threatened Hall, who had refused even
before the archbishop of Canterbury to back down.
   ``I pray quietly,'' she said.
   She said it took her a brief time to decide to stop functioning
as a priest because she knew the act of ordination placed a calling
upon her that could not be revoked, even if she no longer held the
title publicly.
   ``This holy order, I never put it off. I work for the church
quietly, calmly for the rest of my life,'' she said.
   The ordination of Li, who works as a priest now in Toronto, was
eventually recognized _ she celebrated Holy Communion according to
the Chinese Anglican rite as early as Christmas Eve 1957 _ but there
are still reminders that women clergy are not universally accepted
in the Anglican Communion.
   Thus, Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie warmly welcomed Li
to Westminster Abbey in 1984 for a service marking the 40th
anniversary of her ordination, but Li and the other women clergy
could not officiate at Communion because the Church of England still
does not accept women clergy. The Church of England and the
Episcopal Church are among 27 self-governing churches in the 70
million-member Anglican Communion.
   Reflecting on her own experience, Li said she has no doubt God
called Harris to be the female bishop in the Anglican Communion.
   ``He opens a proper way for women to help their church to move
on, to give more help to people, especially the female _ good news
to the female,'' Li said. ``God uses all of His creatures. He would
like every one of us to create a beautiful world.''

   An international group of 10 churchmen and
statesmen has completed a series of firsthand appeals to industrial
nations to apply economic sanctions against South Africa for its
apartheid system.
   Such sustained economic pressures are the last hope for peaceful
change in that country, they maintained in visits with government
leaders in Western Europe, Japan and the United States.
   Their three-week tour, organized by the World Council of
Churches, was concluded in early February with meetings with
officials in Washington.
   The Rev. Canaan Banana, former president of Zimbabwe and head of
the groups, said:
   ``It's our considered view that economic assistance of any kind
helps sustain the apartheid system and contributes to the suffering
of the people there.''

<HEAD>Town Tempers Its Hopes For Super Collider</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM LOTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WAXAHACHIE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the federal government decided to
put the superconducting super collider here, bands played and folks
celebrated. You'd have thought the 1901 ``Spindletop'' gusher was
pumping oil again.
   Gov. Bill Clements declared a great day for Texas. Newspapers ran
huge headlines. Politicians predicted new jobs and a building boom,
and the chamber of commerce toasted Waxahachie's good fortune.
   ``When you talk about what it means to us and the state of Texas
_ $275 million to $300 million is not anything to sneeze at,''
chamber Director N.B. ``Buck'' Jordan said when Waxahachie was
chosen Nov. 10 over six other states as the site for the
53-mile-long underground particle accelerator.
   Waxahachie, a town of 18,000 people about 25 miles south of
Dallas, is the seat of primarily agricultural Ellis County. The
county blossomed in the early 1980s, but not as much as its northern
neighbors, Dallas and Tarrant counties. Two years ago, the largely
rural area felt the blow of the Texas recession.
   Faced with the prospect of 4,000 construction jobs and 3,500
permanent jobs connected with the proposed Ronald Reagan Center for
High-Energy Physics, Jordan said: ``It's fantastic what's
happening!''
   Arizona, Illinois, Colorado, Michigan, North Carolina and
Tennessee lost out to Texas in the competition, and losers'
complaints of influence-peddling in the site selection haven't
subsided. Construction money also hasn't arrived, and Ellis County
has yet to see benefits from the $5.9 billion-project.
   Energy Secretary John Herrington stamped the final seal of
approval on the Texas site Jan. 18. President Bush, who calls
himself a Texan, has agreed with Reagan's recommendation to spend
$250 million in fiscal 1990 _ $160 million on initial construction
and $90 million on research and development.
   But area residents didn't seem to notice.
   Take City Manager Bob Sokoll, for instance. He said he had heard
the site might have been finalized, but didn't know for sure, and he
wasn't going to get worked up about it anyhow. He smiles an uneasy
smile when talking about getting the money out of a Congress that is
looking for ways to cut the federal budget.
   Congress agreed last year to spend $100 million on the project,
but none of it for construction.
   ``Put it to you this way _ and I'm not trying to be negative
about this _ but I wouldn't go out and buy a lot of land yet unless
I was a pretty good gambler,'' Sokoll said.
   In fact, about the only thing that has changed around Ellis
County since Nov. 10, he said, is a surge in real estate activity.
And even that is hard to measure. Realtors say there has been a lot
of looking but little buying.
   ``I think we could be close to making some big deals,'' said
Realtor Tom Crabb.
   Linda Sukla, an agent with Coldwell Banker in Waxahachie, said
she saw an increase in people looking at land after the selection.
``But after the first month, it slowed down a little. ... There are
no done deals.''
   Over in Maypearl, population 462, some people hope there never
are any done deals. If the super collider is built, its campus would
be nearby.
   Maypearl hasn't ``changed a lick,'' as they say thereabouts. It's
still a two-cafe, one-barbershop town. Folks who drive through still
wave at cars going the other way. On a Monday afternoon there are
two little boys riding bicycles on the sidewalks through the middle
of the one-street downtown, in front of boarded storefronts.
   Inside Ruby's Main Street Kitchen at the west end of town, Grady
Moore, 81, is waiting for a hamburger to go and kindly criticizing
the ``older folks who don't want anything to change.''
   Moore said many older residents of Maypearl and western Ellis
County don't want anything to do with the super collider. They like
things the way they are: slow and peaceful. They want their children
and dogs to be able to wander through town at a leisurely,
unmolested pace.
   ``A lot of them are worried about drugs and alcohol. But I'm for
anything that's good for jobs, even if it does shake up some things
little.''
   Moore, a retired steelworker, talks of missed opportunity and
wasted worry.
   ``I can understand why they feel that way, worried and all, but
they have to allow change for the young people.
   ``These young people need jobs. That's what's important, that
they have something to look forward to when they get out of school.''

<HEAD>The White House Pulpit Makes For Great Communicators</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At the White House, it's one man, one voice,
from a political pulpit that cannot be matched. That has been a
dilemma for Democrats through most of the past two decades, but they
thought it would ease when Ronald Reagan retired.
   They're learning otherwise. President Bush may not be the great
communicator, but he's isn't bad. And the Democrats have no solo
spokesman to send up against him.
   That is an inevitable problem for the opposition party, even one
as powerful as the 1989 Democrats, who control the Senate and House,
and hold a majority of governorships and state legislatures.
   In the age of the sound bite, the president commands audiences
and attention they cannot match for all their clout.
   Bush took his message to Congress and the nation in a nationally
televised address last Thursday, with a catalogue of proposals that
redeemed campaign promises and emphasized what he wants government
to do. He offered a defense spending curb to offset part of the
cost, but left the details of paying for deficit reduction for later.
   He's taken the same themes on the road, with three speeches this
week, calling his a sensible budget that can meet needs without new
taxes, and promising to cooperate with the Democratic Congress to
get it all done.
   Nothing dramatic there; it's essentially a rerun. But it shows
the power of the president, any president, to dominate the dialogue.
   Ronald H. Brown, the new Democratic chairman, says he'll work to
make the party more competitive in communications by stressing the
Democrats' message and providing the technology to deliver it to
voters.
   Brown, the first black man to head a major party, said he will
deliver part of that message personally, as a national Democratic
spokesman. ``I don't believe our chairman should try to set the
party line on policy, and I won't try,'' he said as he took office.
``But I do want to help define our party, because if we don't define
ourselves, our opponents ... surely will.''
   Speaker of the House Jim Wright of Texas and Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell of Maine are the party's chief spokesmen at
the Capitol, where that line is set, issue by issue _ rarely with
unanimity.
   Wright brings some political scars to the task _ an ethics
investigation and his unpopular role as legislative strategist for a
51 percent pay raise, rejected after he had to reverse himself and
submit it to a House vote.
   Mitchell is a new leader, a new face, and a persuasive speaker.
That makes him an effective spokesman _ but he has 54 colleagues,
most of whom want a piece of the action, too.
   None of that adds up to a Jim and George Show to rival the
performances of Ev and Charlie, then Ev and Jerry. Those were the
weekly appearances of Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen of
Illinois and his House counterparts, first Charles Halleck of
Indiana, then Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, back in the 1960s, when
Republicans seemed an endangered species.
   Dirksen was a political showman; the House leader got to play his
straight man.
   Republicans regularly sought to devise new ways to deliver their
message and get somebody to listen. Their plight was worse for the
fact that they were out of power in Congress as well as the White
House. Even with congressional majorities, Democrats have had
trouble competing for political attention with the Republican
presidents who have held office 16 of the past 20 years.
   Back when Democrats had the presidency, too, the GOP set up
something forbiddingly named The Republican Coordinating Committee,
including the party's congressional leaders, representatives of its
governors, and former presidential nominees. It met, issued policy
statements and vanished, ineffective and unmourned, when Richard
Nixon became president.
   When Ford lost the White House to Democrat Jimmy Carter, he said
the Republicans should set up a shadow cabinet on the British model.
That didn't work out, either. Presidents are always seen and heard,
but for the opposition, it's a struggle to find a stage.

<HEAD>Cheryl Ladd Stars in Movie with `Scandalous Idea'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cheryl Ladd's new TV movie might have a rather
scandalous plot, but the story was recommended to her by her mother.
   Airing Sunday on CBS, ``The Fulfillment of Mary Gray'' is based
on the romantic novel ``The Fulfillment,'' by LaVeryle Spencer,
about a turn-of-the-century farm couple who consider an unusual way
of overcoming their lack of children.
   ``The husband decides that his younger brother can father their
child,'' Miss Ladd said.
   The author based the book on stories she had heard from her
grandmother. The book was recommended to Miss Ladd by her mother.
   ``My mother's an avid reader,'' Miss Ladd said. ``She not only
recommended that I read it but said it would make a fabulous film. I
read it and agreed with her. It has great characters and a rich and
powerful story. Good stories are tough to find. I worked on the
script six to eight months with Laird Koenig.''
   Miss Ladd's husband, Brian Russell, was supervising producer on
the film. Miss Ladd said she liked the story because of the way the
characters' relationships changed.
   ``The wife and the brother had been friendly up to that time, but
there was nothing more,'' said Miss Ladd. ``But when the husband
makes the announcement at the dinner table, it changes all
relationships. They had been married for seven years and had no
children. He comes to the conclusion it was because he had mumps as
a boy. He's a very religious man and he prays and prays and comes to
this decision.
   ``She's very hurt by the suggestion that he would give her to
another man. He thinks he's giving her a gift. Children are very
important on farms, and it's important that the land be passed on
generation to generation. When the husband goes out of town for a
few days they make a baby and fall in love. Now it really gets
sticky because she loves both of them.''
   The movie also stars Ted Levine as her husband and Lewis Smith as
the younger brother. Piers Haggard directed. The movie was filmed in
Brenham, Texas, which stood in for Minnesota.
   ``We got the weather we needed, in fact, all four seasons,'' she
said. ``We found a farm house from the early 1900s and a grange hall
for a dance.''
   Miss Ladd said she was attracted to the book because it's a
strong story that presents ``a moral issue that we can all relate
to.''
   ``These are all imperfect people,'' she said. ``You can feel the
pain they're going through. They're good people trying to do the
right thing. The husband is solid, quiet and introspective. The
brother is more open and more fun. Put them together and they make a
complete man.''
   Miss Ladd's last television appearance was the CBS miniseries
``Bluegrass,'' but she is best known for the popular series of the
1970s, ``Charlie's Angels.''
   Her latest feature film, ``Millenium,'' which also stars Daniel
J. Travanti and Kris Kristofferson, will be out in April.
   ``I play a woman a thousand years in the future in what's really
a time-travel love story,'' she said. ``I come to the present and
fall in love. It's written by John Varley, who's a leading science
fiction writer. He spent a lot of time on the set. He has a very
free and strange imagination.''
   Miss Ladd said she is still asked frequently to do another series.
   ``I'm not ready yet for another series,'' she said. ``I'm having
too much fun playing all these different characters.''

<TEXT>
   The world premiere of ``The Barber of Seville''
was such a fiasco that the humiliated composer, young Gioacchino
Rossini, fled the theater in fear of assassination.
   Luckily, the piece survived that first Rome performance in 1816
and has gone on to become the most popular comic opera of all time.
   Television viewers can sample its melodious delights tonight when
it is shown on the Public Broadcasting Service as part of the series
``The Metropolitan Opera Presents.''
   Rossini, always a fast worker, claimed he spent all of 13 days
setting to music his adaptation of the famous play of the same name
by the French dramatist Beaumarchais. The straightforward plot tells
how two young lovers, heroine Rosina and her suitor Count Almaviva,
triumph over old fogies, her guardian Dr. Bartolo and the music
teacher Don Basilio, with the help of some inventive duplicity _
provided by the resourceful barber Figaro.
   Tonight's performance, taped last fall, is well worth watching,
both for die-hard opera fans and for those to whom the words ``Largo
al factotum'' are more suggestive of a prescription for cough
medicine than the title of Figaro's big patter song. English
subtitles are provided for viewers who don't know Italian.
   Chief among its virtues are the performances of Kathleen Battle
as the spunky Rosina, and Enzo Dara as Bartolo, the elderly
gentleman who is not only her guardian but who wants to become her
husband.
   Miss Battle's soprano is as ravishing as ever and her voice
sounds fuller and more powerful than it often does in the opera
house.
   Rossini wrote the part of Rosina for a mezzo, but it is often
appropriated by sopranos. Few listeners will regret a casting
decision that allows Miss Battle to toss off scads of high-flying
coloratura the way she does here.
   The only blemish on her performance is a lack of spontaneity in
her acting and a tendency to rely too heavily on stock gestures and
facial expressions.
   Dara is a joy to watch, a great comic actor having a field day.
And he can sing, too! He brings the house down in his Act 1 aria,
feigning heart failure one moment, dancing a jig the next. In Act 2,
he steals the music lesson scene right out from under Miss Battle
without opening his mouth, nodding off in his easy chair, a glass
full of wine in his hand gradually tipping over further and further
until it spills.
   Unfortunately, the Figaro of Leo Nucci and the Almaviva of
Rockwell Blake don't measure up to their co-stars. Both are
efficient but charmless, and Blake, while undeniably an expert vocal
acrobat, often looks and sounds ill-at-ease.
   Too bad the telecast couldn't have borrowed the superior Figaro
and Almaviva who took over the roles later at the Met _ Americans
Thomas Hampson and Frank Lopardo.
   The production by John Cox boasts a spectacular turntable set by
Robin Wagner that allows a speedy change-of-scene in Act 1 and some
welcome visual distraction during the storm scene in Act 2.
   Conductor Ralf Weikert takes a brisk, no-nonsense approach to the
proceedings. But that's a shame, because the ``Barber'' IS nonsense
_ inspired nonsense _ and the music doesn't sparkle and bubble as it
can under lighter batons.
   ``Il Barbiere di Siviglia'' has long been Rossini's most popular
work _ aside from the overture to ``William Tell'' _ but its start
in life was shaky. Another Italian composer, Giovanni Paisiello had
set the same Beaumarchais play to music 35 years earlier, and his
followers disrupted the premiere of Rossini's work with whistles and
catcalls.
   The second night went much better, and by the third night, the
new piece was being hailed as a triumph, one that swept across
Europe and quickly put Paisiello's work into the shade.
   It's the second of three operas televised this season in the Met
series. This spring viewers can see a twin bill of Bartok's
``Bluebeard's Castle'' and Schoenberg's ``Erwartung.''
   Host for the series is actor F. Murray Abraham.

<HEAD>Mortgages: The New 1989 Models</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial evolution is producing some exotic
species indeed in the world of home mortgages these days.
   Shoppers for loans to finance housing purchases now may encounter
the ``interest only'' mortgage, the 40-year mortgage, or the
15-minute mortgage, just to name a few.
   In theory, these innovations, born of intense competition among
lenders, provide borrowers with an ever-growing number of options to
make home ownership work to their best advantage.
   But financial observers say it is important to separate mere
gimmicks from good deals, and to concentrate on the total cost of a
given loan.
   Forty-year and ``interest only'' mortgages have recently made
their appearance at a few large big-city lending institutions. The
prime target for both is first-time homebuyers who have to stretch
especially hard to meet monthly payments.
   With the ``interest only'' mortgage advertised recently by one
bank, the borrower does not begin repaying the principal on the loan
until the sixth year.
   Conceivably, these propositions could provide access to the
housing market for some people who couldn't otherwise qualify.
   But analysts point out that the potential benefits of either seem
small. On a conventional mortgage, very little principal is paid
back in the first five years anyway.
   And stretching out a loan from the customary 30 years to 40
yields a surprisingly small difference in the monthly payment.
   On a fixed 30-year, $100,000 mortgage at 10 percent interest, the
monthly payment would be $877.57, calculates William Brennan, editor
of the Financial Planning Reporter newsletter published by the
accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Whinney.
   Extend the term of the loan to 40 years, and the monthly payment
is reduced only to $849.15. The $28.42 difference is ``really
meaningless,'' Brennan observes.
   One cost of this modest benefit is much slower reduction in the
unpaid loan balance, leaving the borrower with less equity in the
property.
   After 15 years of payments, the 30-year borrower would have
worked the balance down to $81,644.56, while the 40-year borrower
would still owe $93.446.16.
   With the adjustable-rate mortgages that are common these days,
the same dubious tradeoffs apply.
   In fact, notes Robert Heady, publisher of several banking
newsletters in North Palm Beach, Fla., the extra interest a 40-year
borrower pays will increase should rates go up.
   On a $100,000 loan at 10.9 percent, he reckons, the 40-year
borrower will wind up paying about $101,600 more in interest than
the 30-year borrower.
   Should the rate increase to 12.9 percent, the difference expands
to about $123,600.
   The stretch-out to 40 years means ``inviting a lot of pain down
the road,'' Heady says.
   At the other end of the time scale, the 15-minute mortgage is the
latest brainchild of Citicorp, one of the nation's biggest
originators of home loans.
   ``Fifteen-minute,'' of course, refers not to the duration of the
loan, but to the time Citicorp says it will take to process a
mortgage application, rather than the usual three weeks to a month.
   According to the company, the 15-minute service will be done with
a computer to approve or reject applications transmitted over
telephone lines from the offices of real estate brokers and lawyers.
   There may be something to be said for such rapid service,
replacing the agonizing wait that aspiring homeowners often endure
while lending institutions decide their fate.
   But financial experts say the speed of processing is a separate
question from matters that remain important for many years _ in
particular, which lender's mortgage will cost you the least over the
period in which you expect to own the home.

<TEXT>
   The National Academy of Recording Arts &amp;
Sciences, which annually bestows the industry's highest honor, has
been reshaped over the past year to pay more attention to artists'
needs and to educate the public about the music industry.
   But while this year's Grammy awards show is a far cry from the
days of Andy Williams, as it recognizes new formats of music
including rap and heavy metal, academy president Michael Greene
still wants to retain the integrity of contemporary American music.
   ``Our challenge has always been to remain true to why we are an
academy and what the entire scope of music is all about, and not
worry about the rest of it,'' he said.
   The three-hour presentation of the 31st annual Grammy awards is
scheduled for broadcast on Wednesday, Feb. 22, from 8 to 11 p.m. EST
on CBS-TV from the stage of the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.
The show was telecast from Radio City Music Hall in New York last
year. It will alternate between the two cities.
   For the first time in Grammy history, a heavy metal group will
perform. Metallica, whose sound is slightly more melodic than other
hard-core metal groups, has anti-war themes running through its
music. The group's popularity has soared without major radio airplay
and few videos. Metallica has been nominated in the Hard Rock-Metal
Vocal or Instrumental for ``... And Justice for All.''
   Another first on the telecast is a Latin music performance.
However, the academy isn't presenting a mainstream Latin group or
artist such as Tito Puente but pop artist Linda Ronstandt. She will
sing ``La Charreada,'' from her album, ``Canciones de mi Padre,''
which has been nominated in the best Mexican-American performance
category.
   Meanwhile, some rap artists feel snubbed because the rap music
award isn't set for the televised portion of the show. And Greene
said the network is uneasy because he's delivering a short
state-of-the-profession speech, a move destined to send home
audiences running to the refrigerator for refills.
   ``CBS hates it, they truly hate it, when we get out and spend
even two minutes (talking about issues),'' Greene said. ``But it
would be a real failing on the part of the academy not to. What we
are really about is the representation of the creative and technical
community all the other 364 days of the year.''
   Greene, the first full-time president of NARAS, has been busy
restructuring the 6,000-member organization since he arrived here
last March. Included in his plans are a museum, an archive and
research center, and a permanent office building for the academy.
   But the primary product of the organization is the annual Grammy
ceremony, which includes 76 categories this year, 17 of which will
be presented during the broadcast produced by Pierre Cossette with
Billy Crystal as host. The rest of the awards are handed out during
a fast-paced non-televised ceremony before the show.
   Top nominees for the best music of 1988 include singer-songwriter
Tracy Chapman with six nominations for her surprise debut album, and
jazz stylist Bobby McFerrin with five nominations, most of them for
his ``Don't Worry, Be Happy'' single and the ``Simple Pleasures'' LP
from which it came.
   Unlike the American Music Awards show, which was designed for
television consumption and based on consumer popularity, the Grammys
is an awards presentation that wound up being televised. It also
carries prestige, and guarantees to any artist or group chosen to
perform, exposure to millions of potential record buyers.
   So rarely is everyone happy with how the show turns out. One
year, jazz artists said they were snubbed and threatened to form
their own academy. Classical and gospel artists also have complained
of being shortchanged.
   This year, with their foot just in the door, rap artists are
already ``dissing the Gram-dogs'' (speaking badly about the academy)
and threatening a ``major chill-out'' (boycott).
   Don Rush of Rush Artist Management said two clients, nominees
L.L. Cool J and D.J. Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, will not be
attending the awards show. Jeff and the Prince also were scheduled
as presenters.
   Rush said rappers were ambivalent about the creation of the award
category in the first place, because it could isolate the
multi-influenced genre from rhythm and blues and rock slots.
   ``And now to find out we're being treated like a stepchild _ our
guys just aren't interested,'' Rush told the entertainment trade
paper Daily Variety.
   ``There is no tail that wags this dog,'' Greene said in an
interview. ``The academy and the Grammy show is not going to respond
to boycotts because if we did that, we would have to do it every
year.''
   Last year Run-D.M.C. (also clients of Rush Management) performed
on the show in anticipation of the rap category being added.
   ``I love what's going on in that music category, and I fought
very hard to get it added,'' Greene said. ``It just wasn't possible
to fit it into three hours. If we turn it into a miniseries, maybe
we can do it.''
   What the show will feature is ``the theme and essence of
contemporary music, to showcase musical diversity from hip-hop to
heavy metal to country to jazz to rock,'' said Greene.
   Among those scheduled to perform are Melissa Etheridge, Sinead O'
Connor and Toni Childs, representing three female rockers who ``are
really the new kids on the block,'' Greene said.
   Other performers include Itzhak Perlman, Anita Baker, Whitney
Houston, Lyle Lovett, Bobby McFerrin, K.T. Oslin, Buck Owens, Dan
Seals, Take 6, Joe Williams, The Winans and Dwight Yoakum.
   Lifetime achievement award winners Dizzy Gillespie, Lena Horne,
Leontyne Price and Sarah Vaughan will participate in a special jazz
segment.

<HEAD>Grammys Camouflage Music Industry's Racial Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   On the eve of the Grammy awards ceremony, a black
singer-songwriter is the record industry's uncrowned queen. Tracy
Chapman swept most major categories for her groundbreaking debut
album, receiving six nominations.
   Michael Jackson is looking to add to his trophy collection with
the gospel-tinged ``Man in the Mirror,'' while Bobby McFerrin, with
five nominations, Anita Baker and Whitney Houston are also
contending for big awards. All are black and all have been nominated
for the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences' most
prestigious award, Record of the Year.
   It would appear that the music industry is free from racial
strife. A look beneath the surface, however, says otherwise.
   According to minorities and others in the business, and the
nation's oldest civil rights group, not only do blacks have
difficulty getting their music heard _ except for the superstars _
they also are kept from the corporate jobs that drive the industry.
   Music history has its share of bigotry: white artists remaking
black hits for white audiences and reaping the financial rewards;
pioneer rockers such as Bo Diddley who were underpaid or not paid
and had to fight for every dime; Motown artists who kept their black
faces off album covers. And few can ever forget that rhythm and
blues was once referred to as ``race music'' and its artists were
treated like third-class citizens.
   But it's more than history. A scathing report by the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1987 concluded
the record industry is ``overwhelmingly segregated and
discrimination is rampant.'' Blacks are blocked from advancing at
every level, said the NAACP.
   Two years later, little has changed, said Fred Rasheed, author of
the report.
   ``We have to constantly remind ourselves that this is just music,
that we have to break down these barriers,'' said Ramon Hervey, a
manager who's steered the careers of such artists as Luther Vandross
and Andrae Crouch. ``It's just ingrained into the record companies.''
   The music business is like sports, where there are plenty of
blacks on the playing field but few in the manager's chair or
owner's office, the NAACP said. It is also mirrors the Hollywood
movie industry in which one or two black superstars generate
tremendous box office for studios that have no black executives at
the helm or in decision-making positions.
   This doesn't mean much for chart-topping artists such as Jackson
and Houston; their music gets heard regardless of who's working
behind the scenes.
   But it means a lot for artists such as Vandross, Aretha Franklin,
Rick James and even Stevie Wonder. They're on the second echelon.
Record company promotion people plug records by these musicians
first at black radio stations. If the records aren't big hits on the
black charts, chances are they won't be heard on the radio stations
that cater to a larger consumer group.
   And having a hit on ``urban'' radio stations _ a euphemism for
black audiences _ is no guarantee the record will ``cross over'' to
pop charts. That's a lesson newcomer Vanessa Williams learned very
quickly when ``The Right Stuff'' hit No. 1 on the black charts but
couldn't dent the pop Top 40.
   ``I believe it could have been a much bigger hit on pop (radio)
if I had more support promotion-wise,'' said Williams, a former Miss
America.
   The question of whether black artists get pop hits is
inextricably tied to the hiring patterns within the industry. The
high-powered music business jobs that decide where a company puts
its promotional muscle are almost all filled by whites, said
Billboard's Nelson George. Blacks are steered to the black music
division of a record company, he said.
   ``Most blacks are in the promotion area _ these are the ones that
are calling on radio stations _ and are not necessarily in the
mainstream of the business area of the company,'' said LeBaron
Taylor, vice president and general manager for corporate affairs at
CBS Records.
   ``Very few black acts have longevity as pop artists,'' said
Hervey, who manages and is married to Williams. ``I can't think
historically of any black artist who can consistently release albums
and be successful on the pop charts without being successful on the
black charts.''
   Stevie Wonder was at that point in the 1970s, when he raked in
awards and smash hits with ease. But today, the Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame member has trouble getting on the pop charts.
   Stunted racial attitudes have even led to a few tragic-comic
situations.
   The Detroit band Was (Not Was), which has two whites and two
blacks and play an eclectic mix of soul and rock, was not allowed by
its former record company to include pictures with promotional
materials sent to radio stations.
   ``They didn't want black radio to know there were white people
involved with the band, nor white people to see there were black
people involved,'' said band member David Weiss, currently riding
high with the band's hit ``Walk the Dinosaur.''
   Rick James (``Super Freak (Part 1)'') can't get his videos on
MTV, while black video stations have complained he has too many
whites in his clips, said his manager and brother, Leroi Johnson.
   For a good part of the '80s MTV refused to play videos of black
artists, saying they didn't fit with their rock format. The practice
ended when CBS Records threatened to pull all its videos from the
station if MTV didn't show Michael Jackson.
   ``Most record companies in America are looking to do what Geffen
Records did with Guns 'n Roses,'' Weiss said. ``They're looking to
find that band that's going to tear the heads off white America. ...
It's a game of numbers.''
   Many blacks are just as rigid in their views of what music should
or shouldn't be as whites. There was a lot of grumbling among
blacks, George said, when George Michael, who is white, had big hits
on the ``black'' charts.
   ``You may say there's a lot of segregation and stereotyping, but
a lot of the stereotyping is self-inflicted,'' he said. ``Blacks
can't keep blaming the white establishment. A lot of it comes from
the inside.''
   Another problem is that successful black artists rarely bring
other blacks into the business with them, the NAACP's Rasheed said.
Also, only a handful of major black artists have black managers.
   No one in the industry disputed the NAACP report, but responses
were left to the individual companies, said Trish Heimers of the
Recording Industry Association of America.
   However, said Rasheed, ``The attitude of most record company
executives was to ignore it and hope it goes away.''
   Both Warner Bros. Records and CBS Records have programs to
advance minorities, although both stressed it wasn't in response to
the NAACP report. They also couldn't say how many blacks are
employed.
   ``I believe that it is healthier than the report indicates,''
said Tom Draper, vice president for community relations at Warner
Bros.
   But it's important, Draper said, not to let the success shown by
Grammy nominees deceive people into thinking total racial harmony
has been achieved.
   ``We need more Tracy Chapmans to break through, more artists who
don't conform to stereotypes,'' George said. ``That's really
crucial. The industry follows the artist.''

   As the government fashions a $90 billion
rescue for the savings and loan industry, a bailout of the $52.5
billion Farm Credit System has entered its second year, costing a
fraction of initial estimates.
   A reviving farm economy, supported by generous government subsidy
payments to farmers, has helped improve the outlook for what was
once considered one of the riskiest federal rescue packages.
   Nevertheless, some weeds still plague the 73-year-old independent
farm banking system and its 600,000 borrowers.
   ``The bleeding has stopped, which is good to see,'' said Jeff
Plagge, executive vice president of the First State Bank of Webster
City, Iowa, and a member of the state bankers association's
agriculture committee.
   But he said the Farm Credit System ``has ways to go before I
think they are perceived by customers as a stable organization.''
   The system, a network of rural banks and credit associations, was
created in 1916 to provide a reliable source of credit to farmers,
the only way for many to pay for the seed, fertilizer, weed killers
and insecticides needed in the spring to get a crop in and carry a
farm operation to the fall harvest.
   ``We need it to survive. We need it to be rehabilitated. We need
an institution people in agriculture can depend on for financing or
we're going to see bad days again,'' said farmer Reynold Minski, who
raises cotton and soybeans near Lake Providence, La.
   At the beginning of 1987, after losing $4.6 billion over the
previous two years, the Farm Credit System sought $6 billion in
government aid.
   By the end of that year, with signs of a revival in farm
prosperity under way and systemwide losses cut to $17 million,
Congress approved the Agricultural Credit Act, authorizing the sale
of up to $2.8 billion in government-backed bonds to provide a
capital infusion. If that was not enough, the system could ask
Congress for up to $1.2 billion more.
   To date, the system has borrowed $690 million, just 11.5 percent
of estimated needs only two years ago and 17.25 percent of the
maximum assistance authorized.
   Although the system eventually will have repay the money, the
U.S. Treasury will pay the interest on the debt, now $64.9 million a
year, for the first five years of the 15-year bonds and half the
interest for the next five years before the system starts paying the
interest itself.
   Still worrisome, however, is the uncertain long-term outlook for
repayment of the principal, given the roller coaster course of
agriculture, and the much bigger price tag associated with bailing
out insolvent savings and loans.
   ``Who will repay the bonds? That is the big question,'' said Son
Won Song, chief economist at Norwest Corp., a Minneapolis banking
company.
   Money wasn't the only part of the Farm Credit System package.
   A board created by Congress to review assistance requests quickly
closed the system's sickly banking operation in Jackson, Miss.,
because of what it called poor management. Many of the system's
three dozen banks and hundreds of credit associations were
consolidated.
   ``Other than the Jackson situation, most of the worst times are
behind us,'' said Daniel Bienz, vice president for disclosure and
reporting at the Farm Credit Financial Assistance Corp., a system
subsidiary.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, a member of the House Banking Committee,
credits what he called generous government assistance with
stabilizing the Farm Credit System, despite the devastating drought
of 1988 that otherwise would have made many struggling farmers even
worse off than before.
   ``The federal government rained dollars in the farm economy. We
didn't get natural rain, we got manmade rain,'' Leach said.
   That has some economists worried, too, given the clamor for
budget cutting in Washington and selection of farm programs as a
likely target.
   ``If there is a significant reduction in farm income, the ability
of farmers to repay is diminished,'' said Neil Harl, an agriculture
economist at Iowa State University.
   Harl said farm program payments accounted for 94 percent of
Illinois' farm earnings in 1987, 72 percent of Iowa's and 36 percent
nationwide, leaving agriculture vulnerable if federal support is cut.
   Marvin Duncan, acting chairman of the Farm Credit Administration,
regulator of the system, also expressed caution about the recovery.
   ``Overall, the system turned profitable last year, but earnings
were not particularly high quality,'' he says.
   An upturn in farmland values increased the collateral backing
many problem loans, enabling banks systemwide to remove hundreds of
millions of dollars from reserves set aside for possibly
uncollectable debts.
   In the four-state Omaha, Neb., Farm Credit Services district
alone, $271 million in provisions for bad loans were removed from
the red ink side of the books in 1988.
   The Omaha district, which covers Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota and
Wyoming, intends to go a step beyond recovery. It has suggested
expanding into activities that include checking accounts, credit
cards and investment services.
   Its Iowa office even has a small program that offers borrowers
discounts when buying cars.
   ``We went down the tubes because we were not diversified,'' said
John Scherle, district spokesman.
   Regulators and lawmakers are skeptical about such straying from
the system's basic mission.
   ``I think they are smoking something in Omaha that isn't grown on
the typical Iowa soybean farm,'' Congressman Leach said.
   Duncan at the Farm Credit Administration said such programs
probably must be approved by his agency, and asked, ``If you broaden
the range of offerings do you bring additional risk to the financial
stability of the institution?''
   Bankers also are alarmed because of possible competition from
federally subsidized farm credit agencies and the prospect of even
more from S&amp;Ls.
   ``They had a record that indicated they couldn't adequately
manage a loan portfolio. Now they want to take deposits,'' said
Edward Tubbs, Iowa's banking superintendent.
   With a fresh infusion of money, farm credit banks have become
fierce competitors for loans in many parts of the country, leading
to banker complaints of illegal ``predatory pricing.'' The practice
refers to loan-making that undercuts interest rates offered by banks.
   Joseph Daly, president of the Farley State Bank in northeast
Iowa, said his bank was about to refinance a mortgage at 11 percent
interest in early February from a customer who'd paid the Farm
Credit System 12.7 percent for years.
   When the Farm Credit office heard of the deal, it offered to
refinance the loan at 10.5 percent, Daly said.

   ``I don't see how you can cover costs at those rates or cover
yourself for another crunch,'' he said. He also accused the system
of arbitrary standards, claiming it quoted 11.5 percent as its
lowest rate to another farmer.
   Marlin Jackson, chairman of First State Bank of Conway, Ark.,
said that while competition has intensified, the farm credit system
has not ``opened the floodgates'' like in the late 1970s when it
encouraged farmers to expand at a time of rising inflation and
interest rates.
   Many farmers later got caught with unmanageable debts when land
values and farm prices collapsed in the early 1980s.
   ``It's highly competitive (now) for the best credits, but it's a
step well short of cannibalistic-type pricing,'' Jackson said.
   Jeff Graves, a vice president at Central Trust and Savings in
Eldridge, Iowa, said the government's assistance to the Farm Credit
System is ``like a grandparent giving you free money to run a
business.''
   But Farm Credit officials said they have new management practices
as well as ground to regain from the banks after losing a big chunk
of farm debt.
   The Farm Credit System accounted for 33.4 percent of the total
$192.7 billion in farm debt in 1983 but held 27.4 percent of a total
debt of $142.7 billion by the end of 1987, U.S. Agriculture
Department figures show, while banks' share rose from 23.6 percent
to 28.7 percent.
   Bankers have no right to grouse, said Moe Russell, president of
Farm Credit Services of Iowa.
   ``I've got 99 credit officers around the state telling me `the
banks are undercutting us.' The point is, the Iowa farmer is the
winner,'' Russell said.
   Duncan said his agency's investigations have not substantiated
complaints of predatory pricing.
   Bankers, meantime, have an opportunity to win more long-term farm
lending with the creation of the Federal Agricultural Mortgage
Corp., known as ``Farmer Mac.'' It's designed to create a market for
farm mortgages the same way the Federal National Mortgage
Association, ``Fannie Mae,'' did for residential housing. Banks will
be able to pool farm mortgages for resale to investors.
   While the credit outlook may be brightening, many farmers,
especially in the troubled Jackson district of Alabama, Louisiana
and Mississippi, are complaining they cannot get loans.
   ``The availability of credit is one of the hardest problems we
face right now,'' said Hugh Arant, who raises cotton, rice, soybeans
and catfish in Ruleville, Miss.
   Duncan said money abounds for lending. He also said ``farmers
often badmouth their industry. Farmers are often the last to admit
that improvements are occurring.''

in November.
   Also Tuesday, automakers reported that sales of North
American-made cars and light trucks fell 15.2 percent in early
February from the same time last year, when automakers were offering

<TEXT>
   Smith &amp; Wesson is trying to sell a new line of
handguns to women, but several leading women's magazines are
refusing to carry the gunmaker's advertisements for the petite
``LadySmith'' .38 revolvers.
   ``We would not accept that category of advertising,'' said John
de Holl, director of advertising services for Woman's Day magazine
in New York. ``It would be against the policy of the magazine to run
any advertisements for firearms.''
   Woman's Day is not alone. Smith &amp; Wesson officials say New
York-based Conde Nast Publications, including Mademoiselle, Glamour
and Self, and Des Moines-based Meredith Group's Better Homes &amp;
Gardens all have rejected ads for the LadySmiths.
   ``We do not accept handgun ads for any of our magazines _ even
Playboy,'' said a representative of Conde Nast's West Coast
advertising firm, who asked not to be identified. Playboy is not
published by Conde Nast.
   ``Some publications I have approached have turned down the ads,''
said Michael Shypula, director of advertising and promotions for the
Springfield, Mass.-based gunmaker. ``I think the bias is against the
Smith &amp; Wesson name...since there are no guns in our ads.''
   Smith &amp; Wesson last month unveiled the new line of four handguns,
the LadySmiths, at a trade show in Dallas. The guns _ all
.38-caliber revolvers _ have been scaled down to better fit a
woman's hand.
   Shypula said advertisements for the guns will focus on public
safety. The ads will not feature pictures of the guns, but rather
illustrations of women in typical pre-crime situations _ stuck on
the side of the road with car trouble or hearing a noise the middle
of the night.
   Rather than carrying the name of the guns, the ad will have a
toll-free 800-number Smith &amp; Wesson is setting up for women to talk
to a female gun specialist about purchasing a handgun.
   ``We're using illustrations,'' Shypula said. ``None of them show
anyone in a dangerous situation. A lot of our ads tell women to call
the police.''
   The ad with the woman with car trouble carries the headline:
``This is no place to take a walk.'' The one featuring a
startled-looking woman in bed reads: ``Things that go `bump' in the
night aren't always your imagination.''
   ``I want to inform women, I don't want to offend women,'' Shypula
said, adding the ads do not specifically advocate buying a gun.
``People who want to learn more about it, can pick up the phone and
dial the toll-free number to talk to someone about it.''
   Shypula said the ads will run for about four months, beginning in
April issues of these magazines: Country Home, Executive Female,
First, Harpers Bazaar, Lady's Home Journal, McCalls, Metropolitan
Home, Redbook, Shape, Town &amp; Country, Vanity Fair, Women's Sports
and Fitness, Working Mother, Working Woman.
   But Andrea Kaplan, spokeswoman for the Working Woman-McCall's
Group magazines, said none of the company's three publications,
including Working Mother, will be running the ads.
   ``I think there had been some discussion about them, but our
publisher decided not to run the ads,'' she said.
   Barbara Lautmann, spokeswoman for the Washington-based Handgun
Control Inc., criticized Smith &amp; Wesson when the LadySmiths were
introduced. She said the company and the National Rifle Association
have tried to boost sagging handgun sales by presenting women with a
fear campaign.

<HEAD>Union Carbide's Payment Is Smaller Than Drexel Settlement</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Carbide Corp. is paying millions less to
settle claims from a chemical leak that killed thousands of people
in India than Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is paying for white-collar
crime on Wall Street.
   To some legal experts, the comparison between Union Carbide's
$470 million payment and Drexel's $650 million settlement suggests
that Union Carbide got off lightly, while to others, it indicates
Drexel was overpunished.
   In either case, differences in the treatment of Carbide and
Drexel point up oddities in the way legal systems deal with
allegations of corporate crime and negligence.
   ``There's no doubt in anyone's mind that the Bhopal incident is
more serious than the Drexel Burnham Lambert case. But whoever said
that rationality prevails in the administration of justice?'' said
Robert Figlio, adjunct professor of legal studies at the University
of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
   Carbide agreed Tuesday to pay $470 million to the government of
India in a surprise court-ordered settlement resulting from the Dec.
3, 1984, gas leak at Bhopal that killed more than 3,300 people in
the world's worst industrial disaster.
   Activists in Bhopal denounced the settlement as a betrayal of the
20,000 victims who still suffer from exposure to the deadly gas that
escaped from a pesticide plant. The government had sought $3 billion
in damages.
   In Drexel's case, the Wall Street firm that pioneered ``junk
bond'' financing agreed in December to pay $650 million in fines and
restitution and to plead guilty to six felony accounts.
   The plea bargain, which awaits the approval of a federal court
and the Securities and Exchange Commission, averted a lengthy trial
over charges of insider trading and stock manipulation.
   Which corporation committed a more serious offense?
   The National Survey of Crime Severity, which asked more than
50,000 Americans in the late 1970s to rank offenses ranging from
loitering to murderous bombing, gives some hint that Carbide would
be considered the more serious offender.
   Price-fixing between large corporations, a crime similar to
Drexel's, was given a relatively mild score of 9.2 in the survey.
   Willful pollution of a city water supply that resulted in 20
deaths, the closest approximation of Carbide's offense, was rated
extremely serious at 39.1.
   Several factors complicate the comparison, however. For one,
Carbide's chemical leak was not a willful act by senior management,
although prosecutors charged that the company was criminally
derelict in its duty to ensure the plant's safety.
   The U.S. government could get more out of Drexel than the Indian
government could get out of Carbide because it had more legal
leverage over the company.
   Also, $470 million goes a lot farther in India than it would in
the United States. Differences in the cost of living amplify the
actual value of Carbide's payment.
   Carbide's average payment per life lost is about $140,000. That
is nearly 100 times as much as an Indian court had ever ordered in
payment for deaths in cases that involved government, such as train
wrecks, according to Curtis Tarr, dean of Cornell University's
Johnson Graduate School of Management.
   Tarr said he had no figures on cases involving liability of
private entities.
   ``The difference between the cases is that Carbide has always
sensed a responsibility and wanted to do what they could,'' Tarr
said. ``In the Drexel thing, you have quite a different situation,
where some people were operating in a kind of a gray area of
legality.''
   Drexel might have gotten off more lightly five or 10 years ago,
before revelations about E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., Dennis Levine, Ivan
Boesky and others caused a wave of public outrage over insider
dealings on Wall Street.
   Today, Figlio said, ``You've got a whole buildup of sentiment
against that activity in all levels of society.''

<HEAD>Board Of Trade Executives Say Dual Trading Misunderstood</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dual trading is a misunderstood and essential
element of the commodity futures markets, and its potential for
abuse can be offset by closer surveillance, say top officials of the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Dual trading, the practice among floor brokers of trading both
for their own accounts and those of brokerage-firm customers, has
long been cited by critics as a potential source of fraud.
   The debate has heated up since the revelation Jan. 19 of a broad
federal investigation of suspected trading fraud at the Chicago
Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   But Board of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann and President Thomas
Donovan said Tuesday that dual trading helps ensure active, liquid
markets by providing an incentive for floor brokers to stay in the
pits and trade when the flow of orders from the public runs slow.
   Federal rules require brokers to execute all their pending
customer orders before trading for their own accounts, thus giving
customers the first crack at profiting from price fluctuations.
   Mahlmann said the exchange's board of directors voted to
tentatively retain dual trading, a decision announced last week,
because ``through the expansion of the surveillance system we could
eliminate any and all potential abuses of dual trading and keep the
benefit.''
   The rival Chicago Mercantile Exchange is still considering making
changes in its trading rules, including dual trading.
   ``There's nothing wrong with dual trading per se,'' Donovan said.
``The problem is when someone would trade ahead of a customer. And
we can detect that abuse.''
   The Board of Trade hopes to better detect such abuses through a
$1 million upgrade this year of its computerized trade
reconstruction system, an electronic system that officials estimate
can now catch about 90 percent of all improper trades. The goal is
100 percent.
   On another matter, Mahlmann said he was not involved in the
hiring by his own brokerage firm of two salesmen who have since been
indicted on fraud charges.
   The two salesmen, Michael N. Kolb and Jan Y. Biesiadecki, were
indicted by a federal grand jury Jan. 17 on charges they defrauded
investors while working for First Commodity Corp. of Boston, a
futures brokerage firm that collapsed in 1986 after its expulsion
from the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, a Board of Trade affiliate.
   Sixteen other former First Commodity employees also were indicted.
   Mahlmann is the chairman of Stotler &amp; Co., a large Chicago-based
commodity futures brokerage that hired Kolb and Biesiadecki last
year, according to records of the National Futures Association, a
self-regulatory arm of the futures industry.
   Kolb, hired in March 1988, still works for Stotler. Biesiadecki,
hired in November 1988, left Stotler on Jan. 24 and is currently not
registered with the National Futures Association.
   The hirings of former First Commodity salesmen by Stotler and by
RB&amp;H Inc., a brokerage firm headed by a high-ranking executive of
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, have raised questions about the
industry's ability to police itself.
   Mahlmann said Board of Trade activities had consumed ``almost 100
percent'' of his time over the past two years and that he had not
been involved with individual hirings at Stotler during that time.
   He also said all salespeople hired by Stotler had been registered
with the National Futures Association, which is funded by the
nation's 11 futures exchanges through a per-trade fee on public
transactions and carries a federal mandate to screen and register
all commodities salespeople.
   ``As a brokerage firm, there is a reliance that goes with the
registration,'' he said.
   But Robert Wilmouth, president and chief executive officer of the
Chicago-based association, said hiring decisions ultimately are made
by brokerage firms.
   RB&amp;H is headed by John F. Sandner, the immediate past chairman of
the Chicago Merc, who now holds the title of senior policy adviser
at the exchange.
   RB&amp;H employed at least three former First Commodity salesmen last
year, all of whom left the firm before they were indicted.
   Sandner has said he was not directly involved in the hirings and
that his firm has not had any customer complaints relating to their
activities.

   Union Carbide Corp.'s $470 million
settlement with the Indian government over the 1984 Bhopal gas leak
pleased Wall Street but was criticized by a prominent attorney who
originally was involved in the case.
   ``They got off criminally cheap,'' said Melvin Belli, the
attorney who represented the interests of about 2,000 plaintiffs
before the cases were transferred from U.S. courts to India.
   ``We had that amount of money two years ago in New York and it
wasn't enough and it isn't enough,'' Belli said Tuesday in a
telephone interview from San Francisco. He added that he thought two
or three times the $470 million would have been fairer.
   The stock market, however, was delighted by the settlement, which
was ordered by the Supreme Court of India, sitting in New Delhi.
   Union Carbide's stock price soared $2.12{ to $31.25 a share in
New York Stock Exchange trading after news of the settlement and the
company's estimate that it expected a relatively mild impact on its
earnings from the agreement.
   The Indian court ordered the Danbury-based chemical company to
make payment by March 31, thereby settling all claims resulting from
the leak of deadly methyl isocyanate at the Bhopal pesticide plant,
which was operated by Union Carbide's Indian subsidiary.
   More than 3,300 people died as a result of the Dec. 2, 1984,
leak, the world's worst industrial disaster. The plant has been
closed since the accident.
   The Indian government sued Union Carbide for $3 billion in
damages, claiming company negligence caused the leak. Union Carbide
maintains that sabotage by a disgruntled employee was to blame.
   The company said it expected an earnings impact of no more than
50 cents a share from the settlement.
   In the year ended Dec. 31, Union Carbide earned $720 million, or
$5.31 a share, on revenue of $8.32 billion. That compared to 1987
earnings of $231 million, or $1.76 a share, on revenue of $6.91
billion.
   ``Psychologically, it's terrific. Financially, it's reasonable,''
said Leslie Ravitz, a research director for Salomon Brothers Inc. in
New York. ``This relieves the pressure on Union Carbide and the
stigma.''
   James Wilbur, a vice president with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co. Inc. in New York, said Union Carbide has set aside $200 million
toward the settlement and had $250 million in insurance coverage,
leaving it at risk for another $20 million under Tuesday's
settlement.
   ``I think it's a decision that was pretty much anticipated,'' he
said of the settlement.
   Union Carbide had offered to pay the Indian victims $350 million
as early as 1986. That settlement was accepted by U.S. courts but
rejected in India.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keegan ruled in May 1986 that all
claims filed against Union Carbide by individuals and the Indian
government should be transferred to India.
   Under Tuesday's settlement, the Indian government also will
dismiss all criminal charges brought against the company and at
least nine present or former Union Carbide employees, including
former Chairman Warren M. Anderson, who was charged with culpable
homicide.
   Anderson, who maintains an office at Union Carbide headquarters,
did not return telephone calls Tuesday seeking comment.
   In a statement, Union Carbide Chairman Robert D. Kennedy said,
``We are pleased that this will now provide for the care and
rehabilitation of the victims and their families and a fair
resolution of all issues.''
   Had the settlement not been reached, ``The alternative is
litigation that probably would have extended into the next century
with the final outcome that would be completely irrelevant to the
interests of the affected people in Bhopal and a continuing drain on
Carbide,'' said company spokesman Earl J. Slack.
   Richard Grand, founder of the Inner Circle of Advocates, a group
of more than 100 liability attorneys who have won
multimillion-dollar damage awards for clients in personal injury or
death cases, said it would be irresponsible to speculate on how much
Bhopal victims could have won in U.S. courts.
   ``American lawyers should let India judge what's fair,'' he said
from Tuscon, Ariz.

<HEAD>Centaur Increases Offer For Pennwalt To $110 Per Share</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pennwalt Corp., which has agressively spurned
Centaur Partners' advances since the group announced eight months
ago it wanted to take over the chemical company, now says it will
consider a $110 per share offer.
   Centaur announced its increased offer Tuesday morning. After the
stock market closed, Pennwalt came back with its answer.
   Pennwalt Chairman Edwin E. Tuttle said in a letter to Centaur
that the company would call a special board of directors meeting to
consider the increased offer.
   Centaur had offered $100 a share for the company in mid-December
in a deal valued at $698 million. The offer was to expire Feb. 22.
Tuesday's offer is estimated at $869 million.
   Tuttle said the board also will consider a date for a special
stockholder meeting called by Centaur and other stockholders.
Centaur has said it intends to try to fire Pennwalt's board of
directors and install its own board to approve the tender offer.
   The increased offer, due to expire March 1, came four days after
a federal judge denied a Pennwalt request to block the stockholders'
meeting.
   Pennwalt's stock closed at $113.12{ Tuesday, up $7.37{ from
Monday.
   Pennwalt's stock was trading at about $70 per share when Centaur,
an investor group with offices in New York and Bethesda, Md.,
launched its takeover bid.
   To fend off the takeover attempt, Pennwalt sold its
pharmaceutical division and most of its equipment business and
bought back about 40 percent of its outstanding shares for $85 each.
   Most recently, Pennwalt lobbied the Pennsylvania Legislature for
protection, hoping lawmakers would view the company as a victim of
the recent takeover frenzy.
   In an effort to thwart Pennwalt's defense efforts, Centaur, whose
stake in the Philadelphia-based company has increased to 17 percent
since mid-December, called for the meeting.
   Centaur said it has solicited support from shareholders
representing 34.6 percent of the common shares believed to be
outstanding, more than the 20 percent required under Pennsylvania
state law to call such a meeting.
   Michael Brinn, a senior vice president of the Carter
Organization, which tracks shareholder investments, testified in
federal court that arbitrageurs, who hope to make short-term profits
in takeover attempts, owned about 40 percent of the outstanding
shares as of November.
   Centaur said its increased offer would be funded from an
additional $10 million equity investment to be made by Centaur's
partners and from previously disclosed financing to be provided by a
syndicate of banks and the investment firm of PaineWebber Inc.

<HEAD>Judge Grants Appeal In Prime Computer Takeover Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will conduct
an expedited review of a lower court order that has blocked MAI
Basic Four Inc.'s hostile takeover of Prime Computer Inc., which is
based in suburban Natick.
   MAI Basic said Tuesday that the federal appeals court in Boston
granted its motion for an quick appeal and scheduled a hearing for
March 2.
   On Dec. 29, Massachusetts District Court Judge A. David Mazzone
issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting MAI Basic from
pursuing its $20-per-share tender offer for Prime, saying the
company needed to make further financial disclosures.
   The Tustin, Calif.-based firm submitted a financial disclosure on
Jan. 24, but Prime insisted the information was still incomplete and
that MAI Basic's financing plan was in violation of several federal
securities rules.
   Mazzone refused to lift his injunction, and MAI Basic filed an
appeal last week.
   The two companies also are fighting a separate legal battle in
Delaware, where Prime is incorporated. Peter Rosenthal, a spokesman
for MAI Basic, said a Delaware court will schedule a hearing in that
case once the federal court in Boston makes its decision.

<HEAD>News Reports Say Seoul To Abolish Import Barriers On Some Consumer
Goods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea plans to abolish import
barriers and lower customs duties on 44 consumer goods whose
domestic prices are more than 50 percent above the international
level, news reports said Wednesday.
   The government's Economic Planning Board said it hoped the move
would increase imports and stabilize consumer prices, said Yonhap,
the national news agency.
   Among the 44 consumer items expected to affected are washing
machines, toasters, vacuum cleaners, video cassette recorders,
electric shavers, honey, insecticide and whiskey.
   Yonhap said the government plans to remove barriers such as
paperwork and import quotas and lower customs duties by 5 to 15
percent.
   The board recently completed a survey of prices of 91 commodities
in South Korea, the United States, Great Britain, France, West
Germany, Japan and Singapore.
   Yonhap said the government found only 16 items cheaper in South
Korea than in other nations. These included instant noodles,
powdered coffee, coffee creamer, chewing gum, biscuits, tooth paste,
cordless telephones and umbrellas.
   The other 71 items were more expensive in South Korea, the report
said, and 44 items cost over 50 percent more.
   Prices in South Korea rose 7.1 percent last year, compared with 3
percent in 1987, government reports show.

<HEAD>World Bank Affiliate To Invest $200 Million In Mexican Companies
This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANITA SNOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Finance Corp. will invest at
least $200 million in private Mexican companies by the end of this
fiscal year, primarily to refinance individual foriegn debts, an
official of the World Bank affiliate said Tuesday.
   ``Not only does the Mexican government have a major foreign debt
problem, but so do many Mexican companies,'' corporation vice
president William Ryrie said at a news conference. ``One of the
things we do is to help various private companies restructure their
finances and liberate them from the financial burdens that have kept
them from expanding.''
   Ryrie said the corporation's investment in Mexico this fiscal
year includes $14.5 million already appropriated to Polimar, a
plastics export firm, and a $60 million line of credit granted for
restructuring of the government controlled Banca Serfin.
   He said most other investments planned for Mexico during the
remainder of fiscal 1988-89 are still in negotiations and he would
not say what other companies would be involved.
   The corporation was formed to boost economic development through
private-sector investment.
   Helmut Paul, the corporation's director of Latin American
investments, said future investments in Mexico will benefit
companies producing petrochemicals, household appliances, automobile
parts and hotels.
   Paul said those petrochemical companies are small private firms
making such things as plastics from petroleum derivatives and do not
include Pemex, the government oil monopoly.
   Ryrie was in Mexico to review corporation programs and meet with
federal officials, including Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe.
   ``Mr. Aspe and his collegues have encouraged us to expand our
activities here and we expect to have a close relationship with the
new (presidential) administration,'' Ryrie said. President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari took office in December.
   ``Our activities in Mexico are growing very fast,'' Ryrie added.
He said the corporation already has invested $375 million in 27
companies nationwide.
   The corporation will continue investing at least $200 million in
Mexico each year in the future, he said.
   Much of that money will be used to restructure private companies'
foreign debts, Ryrie said.
   In 1988, the corporation used an $80 million loan to help the
Visa Group of Monterrey slash its foreign debt from $1.7 billion to
$400 million. The group's principal holdings are breweries,
including Dos Equis beer.
   Visa's restructuring included a variety of alternative
refinancing methods, including debt-for-equity exchanges, in which a
debtor uses equity to pay off outstanding debts.
   Mexico should examine similar alternative refinancing methods to
reduce its $106 billion foreign debt, Ryrie said.
   Ryrie said that despite its economic troubles ``the adjustment
Mexico has made in the last year of crisis has been an impressive
one, and one that should be respected.''
   ``The recent expansion of non-oil exports is important, as is the
new liberalization of previous trade policies,'' he added.
   Ryrie also praised the government's recent push to reprivatize
some government-held companies and said the corporation is willing
to help in the sale of additional state-owned companies to the
private sector.

<HEAD>Early February Car and Truck Sales Slide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Automakers suffered a 15 percent drop in sales of
domestic-made cars and light trucks in early February over a year
ago, reflecting rising interest rates and declining incentives.
   The companies reported Tuesday that during the Feb. 1-10 period,
they sold vehicles at an average daily rate of 27,770, compared with
a rate of 32,749 during the same time in 1988.
   Car sales were off 18 percent, led by Chrysler Corp.'s drop of
nearly 31 percent, and light truck sales fell by 10 percent.
   The decline occurred partly because there were more enticing
incentives being offered in the market during early February last
year. Incentives are available now but only on a smaller number of
cars than in early February a year ago.
   Interest rates also have crept up since early February last year.
   ``I think the recent rise in (interest) rates have hurt sales a
little bit,'' said analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. of
New York. ``Also they finished '88 on a very strong note.''
   So far this year, car and light truck sales are off 4.4 percent,
going to a daily rate of 31,257 from a rate of 32,686. Car sales are
down 7.7 percent while light truck sales have risen 1.9 percent so
far this year.
   Chrysler said its car sales fell 30.9 percent during early
February to a daily rate of 2,200 from a rate of 3,185 in the same
period last year. Chrysler's truck sales fell 5.1 percent to a daily
rate of 2,398 in early February from a rate of 2,528 at the same
time last year.
   So far this year, Chrysler's car sales are 13.6 percent lower
than they were last year, but truck sales are 7.7 percent ahead of
last year's pace.
   GM car sales fell 23 percent during early February to a daily
rate of 8,355, compared with a rate of 10,856 in early February
1988. Trucks made by GM in the United States sold at a daily rate of
4,040 during the first 10 days of the month, down 13 percent from
the 4,643 daily rate during early February last year.
   For the year, GM has sold 14.3 percent fewer cars this year than
last year, and 2.3 percent fewer trucks.
   Ford said its early February car sales slipped 9.5 percent to a
daily rate of 5,557 from last year's rate of 6,143. Ford truck sales
fell by 11.3 percent during the period to a rate of 3,596 compared
with a rate of 4,053 in the same period last year.
   Ford has sold 0.2 percent more cars and 0.7 percent more trucks
so far this year than during the same time last year.

<HEAD>Accord Reached In Westinghouse-Asea Brown Boveri Venture</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. and ABB Asea Brown
Boveri Ltd. of Switzerland are going ahead with planned joint
ventures following a proposed settlement of a federal antitrust
action.
   The Justice Department filed both the antitrust lawsuit and
proposed settlement Tuesday at federal court in Manhattan.
   Westinghouse and ABB later announced they have established joint
ventures in the electrical transmission and distribution equipment
markets of the United States, Brazil and Argentina.
   The Justice Department had sued to block the ventures, proposed
last April, claiming they posed significant threats to competition
in U.S. markets for power transformers, converter transformers,
steam turbine generator equipment and services.
   In January, Charles F. Rule, assistant attorney general in charge
of the Antitrust Division, said reduced competition ``would likely
mean higher electric rates for all users of electricity and higher
prices for many products manufactured using electricity.''
   Under the proposed settlement, the Justice Department withdrew
its objections to the joint ventures in return for ABB's agreement
to divest its Waukesha, Wis., transformer plant and related assets.
   One of the joint ventures establishes the Westinghouse ABB Power
T&amp;D Co., with Westinghouse owning 55 percent and ABB 45 percent. The
newly formed company will consist of Westinghouse and ABB's
manufacturing plants and engineering and marketing organizations of
their U.S. transmission and distribution businesses.
   Under separate agreement, ABB, based in Zurich, Switzerland, also
has acquired 45 percent of the stock of certain Westinghouse
subsidiaries in Brazil and Argentina.
   But as part of the settlement with the Justice Department,
Westinghouse must sell its technology for designing and making
converter transformers, used by electric utilities to convert
electricity to different voltages for efficient long distance
transmission.
   In its previous objection to the venture, the Justice Department
claimed the combined power transformer sales of Westinghouse and ABB
would exceed 50 percent of total U.S. sales, which were more than
$400 million in 1988.
   The settlement also bars both concerns from completing their
previously announced joint venture in the steam turbine generator
business for 10 years.
   Westinghouse and ABB are two of only four significant sellers of
major turbine generator repair and related services to U.S.
utilities, along with General Electric and Utility Power Corp., a
subsidiary of Siemens A.G. of West Germany, Rule said. U.S. sales of
steam turbine generators and the related services are estimated at
over $600 million per year.
   Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse had $12.5 billion in sales in 1988
and employs about 120,000 people.
   ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd. was created Jan. 1, 1988, with the
merger of Asea AB of Sweden and BBC Brown Boveri Ltd. of
Switzerland. ABB had 1988 sales of about $18 billion and 180,000
employees worldwide.
   Combined annual sales of the joint ventures are expected to be
about $1 billion. The operations employ about 10,000 and will
involve 20 Westinghouse and three ABB facilities in the U.S. and
Latin America.

<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. has been fined 14 times for a total of
$245,000 in the past four years by the Federal Aviation
Administration because of quality control problems, records show.
   Responding to a Freedom of Information request filed by the
Morning News Tribune of Tacoma, the FAA released a list of civil
penalties paid by Boeing and one paid by McDonnell Douglas from 1985
through 1988.
   Reports on the list were published Tuesday by The Seattle Times
and today by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
   The sole penalty McDonnell Douglas paid in that period was $1,700
for leaving a pin off an aircraft tail assembly.
   In addition, the FAA is pursuing a $200,000 fine against
McDonnell Douglas for failure to reinforce an area on the top side
of the fuselage of 174 aircraft where a blinking light is installed,
FAA attorney Douglas Anderson said.
   Fines paid by Boeing ranged from $1,000 for piercing wire
insulation with a marker, which caused an in-flight fire in a
lavatory on a Monarch Airlines 757, to a company-record $125,000
early last year for installing thousands of defective self-locking
nuts on flight-control systems of 22 767s.
   The list showed Boeing's second-largest fine was $30,000 last
October for installing faulty parts that help open the exit doors of
747 and 757 jetliners.
   Boeing discovered problems with ``emergency pressure reservoirs''
supplied by Textron Inc. but, ``in going through the process to
figure out what happened, they (Boeing) dropped the ball'' and the
parts were installed in 44 planes, Anderson said.
   Other Boeing fines on the list included:
   _$20,000 last September for failing to detect that another
supplier, Northrop Corp., improperly made a secondary
fuselage-support bracket used on 747s. The parts were installed on
an unknown number of 747s, resulting in an FAA order for the bracket
to be inspected periodically or replaced.
   _$16,000 last July for failing to install brake system guard
assemblies on 14 737s delivered in 1986 and 1987. Anderson said the
part was accidentally left off manufacturing blueprints.
   _$21,000 in January 1987 for using obsolete drawings at the
Everett plant and improperly trimming certain parts on half a dozen
747s without approval.
   _ $12,000 in February 1986 for ``reversing the installation of
right-hand and left-hand landing-gear up-lock and down-lock
actuators'' on five 737s.

<HEAD>U.S. Computer Chip Makers Say Barriers Remain in Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANICE FUHRMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American semiconductor makers are selling more in
Japan, but still face a ``psychological barrier'' in efforts to
expand their market share, a representative of the U.S.-based
Semiconductor Industry Association said Wednesday.
   Since the United States slapped $300 million in sanctions on
Japan in April 1987, saying it had violated a semiconductor trade
pact, the government and the country's largest chip makers have
tried to increase the foreign market share, said David Metz, Tokyo
representative of the American trade group.
   But Metz told the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan that
changes in ``attitudes and practice'' have not been far-reaching
enough. He said the biggest barrier is that many Japanese
semiconductor users are not accustomed to doing business with
non-Japanese suppliers and are especially reluctant to deal with any
but the largest and most well-known foreign companies.
   ``The record during the last 1{ years under the semiconductor
trade agreement clearly reflects efforts of the Electronics Industry
Association of Japan and others to increase foreign access to the
Japanese market,'' Metz said.
   ``But the changes in practice have not filtered throughout the
industry,'' he said. ``We have to see a broader basis for increased
market share in Japan. The top five companies are not extensive
enough.''
   Foreign market share in Japan reached its lowest point in 1986 at
8.4 percent and rose to 12 percent in the fourth quarter of last
year.
   The United States says that Japan and the United States agreed in
1986 that the U.S. share of Japan's market should be about 20
percent in the absence of barriers. The Japanese say they promised
market access, but not guaranteed market share.
   ``We are no longer arguing that there are any formal or
legislative barriers, but there is a psychological barrier,'' Metz
said.
   U.S. officials imposed the unprecedented sanctions after accusing
Japan of dumping _ selling computer chips at unfairly low prices _
and not meeting pledges that the foreign share of Japan's market
would grow.
   The sanctions were in the form of special duties on imports from
Japan, and half were lifted in June 1987, when the United States
said it no longer could find evidence of dumping.
   But $165 million in sanctions remain, and Metz said the SIA does
not want them lifted yet.
   ``We won't advocate the sanctions be dropped because we want to
make sure that South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore know
there shouldn't be any dumping at all,'' Metz said.
   The world market for semiconductors is expected to soften in 1989
and Metz said the real test of progress for foreign producers in
Japan will be whether foreign firms are the first dropped by
Japanese users.
   Japanese producers captured half of the world's semiconductor
market last year, and enjoy an 89 percent share of their domestic
market.

<HEAD>Imports Continue To Soar, While Domestic Production Falls</HEAD>

   U.S. oil imports soared to more than 8 million
barrels per day in January for the first time since 1980 as demand
rose sharply and domestic production continued to dwindle, an
industry trade group said today.
   The American Petroleum Institute, which represents major oil
producers anday outside
government buildings to denounce the $470 million compensation
payment ordered by the Supreme Court.
   ``We want justice!'' and ``Hang Anderson!'' they shouted,
referring to former Union Carbide Corp. chairman Warren Anderson.
   ``The government has shaken hands with Union Carbide, whose hands
are dipped in the blood of our brothers and sisters,'' one woman in
the crowd of about 200 cried.
   The demonstration was organized by the Bhopal Gas-hit Women's
Front, one of several groups that accused the government of making a
deal with Union Carbide. The government had sought $3 billion
compensation for the gas leak, which according to the government
killed at least 3,329 people.
   Some survivors said they were glad a financial settlement was
finally reached, but they thought Union should be punished.
   ``We have often been promised money, but for us it was more
important that those who killed our brothers and sisters should be
hanged,'' said Sunil Kumar, 15, whose parents and five siblings died
when methyl isocyanate escaped from a pesticide plant owned by Union
Carbide's Indian subsidiary.
   On Tuesday the Supreme Court of India ended four years of legal
wrangling and ordered Union Carbide of Danbury, Conn., to pay $470
million to the government.
   The news was slow to sink in at the Jai Prakash Nagar shantytown
across the road from the deserted Union Carbide plant, which closed
after the Dec. 3, 1984 leak.
   Kumar still lives with a younger brother in the shack where his
family slept as the white killing vapor wafted across the teeming
settlement.
   This morning, he was studying for high school examinations _ one
of the few teen-agers in the shantytown who can afford not to work.
   He achieved this relative affluence soon after the disaster when
the Indian government gave next-of-kin 10,000 rupees (then worth
$833) for each gas death in the family. Kumar received 70,000 rupees.
   Many people seemed unable to comprehend what the settlement would
mean for them.
   One man, Shanker Lal, said there had been promises of money in
the past but he had yet to receive anything.
   At a hospital near the camp, Shaukat Bai, a veiled woman in her
mid-20s, waited for treatment for respiratory problems blamed on the
gas. Pregnant at the time of the disaster, she lost her unborn child
in a miscarriage health workers blamed on the gas. Her husband was
killed by the gas.
   ``Union Carbide should have been stripped of its assets,'' she
said. She said she thought pregnant women who suffered miscarriages
or gave birth to stillborn babies should be given compensation.
   Local politicians who crusaded on the victims' behalf were more
vehement.
   ``The Rajiv Gandhi government has committed an inhuman crime by
undermining the extent of the disaster,'' Giriraj Kishore, president
of the Slum Dwellers Federation said, referring to the prime
minister and his Congress Party.
   Satinath Sarangi, a scientist and member of the Bhopal Group for
Information and Action, said: ``This settlement is the final
testimony to the anti-people collusion between the government of
India and the Union Carbide Corp.''
   Alok Pratap Singh, a leader of the Poisonous Gas Episode Struggle
Front that often organized anti-Carbide demonstrations, called the
$470 million agreement ``a shameless settlement.''
   Vibhuti Jha, a young lawyer for the front, said the government
had committed a ``criminal offense'' by agreeing to drop criminal
charges against Union Carbide, its Indian subsidiary and corporate
officials.
   Anderson, chairman at the time of the gas leak, and eight
officials of Union Carbide of India Ltd. were charged in 1987 with
culpable homicide in the disaster.
   They never appeared for trial, and the Supreme Court quashed the
charges when it ordered Union Carbide to pay the ``full and final
settlement.''
   Dainik Bhaskar, a Bhopal daily newspaper, called the settlement
``niggardly and inadequate'' and said it set a dangerous precedent
for the Third World where ``people are considered guinea pigs by the
multinationals.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sony Corp. said Wednesday its earnings rose 44.4
percent in its third fiscal quarter on the strength of healthy sales
gains.
   Half of the 36.8 percent increase in quarterly sales was the
result of Sony's $2 billion acquisition of CBS Records Inc., which
was announced in November 1987 and took effect in January 1988.
   By product area, Sony said sales rose 25 percent in video
equipment, 16 percent in audio equipment, 9 percent in televisions
and 22 percent in other products.
   Sony said its earnings for the period ended Dec. 31 totaled 28.9
billion yen, or $229 million, up from 20 billion yen a year earlier.
Sales totaled 613.8 billion yen, or $4.87 billion, up from 448.7
billion yen.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Sony said its
earnings rose 107 percent to 58 billion yen, or $461 million, from
28 billion yen a year earlier. Sales rose 39.9 percent to 1,160
billion yen, or $12.7 billion, from 1,148 billion yen a year earlier.
   Results for 1987 were restated to reflect adoption of an
accounting standard that requires consolidation of its previously
unconsolidated subsidiaries. The dollar equivalents were calculated
on the basis of an exchange rate of 126 yen to the dollar that
prevailed at the end of the reporting period.

   The nation's factories, mines and utilities in
January operated at 84.4 percent of capacity, a level that has not
been surpassed for nearly a decade, the government reported today.
   The Federal Reserve Board said January's operating rate was
unchanged from December, for which the figure was revised upward
from an earlier estimate of 84.2 percent.
   The operating rate for January and December has not been
surpassed since October 1979, when factories were functioning at
84.6 percent of capacity.
   As capacity use rises, so do fears that factories will have
trouble keeping up with orders, leading to shortages and price
increases and adding to inflationary pressures.
   The Fed since last March has been nudging interest rates upward
in an effort to slow the economy and keep inflation in check.
   In a second report today, the Federal Reserve said industrial
production climbed 0.3 percent in January following a revised
increase of 0.5 percent in December.
   A pickup in the production of both manufacturing and commercial
equipment during the month more than offset a decline in output of
transit equipment.
   The Fed's industrial production index stands at 141.1 percent of
its 1977 base, 5 percent higher than a year earlier.
   At manufacturing plants, the operating rate rose to 84.8 percent
last month, up from 84.6 percent in December. Capacity for durable
goods _ ``big ticket'' items expected to last more than three years
_ rose 0.1 percentage points to 83.3 percent, while capacity for
non-durable goods increased by 0.3 percentage points to 86.9 percent.
   Use of motor vehicles and parts manufacturing capacity was down a
hefty 4.1 percentage points to 75.7 percent.
   The January operating rate at utilities was 80.4 percent, down
from 81 percent a month earlier.
   In the mining sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, the
operating rate was down 0.8 percentage points to 82.5 percent. The
decrease reflected a substantial drop in coal output and oil and gas
extraction.
   Production in the manufacturing sector rose 0.5 percent in
January, matching a December increase, while output from mines and
utilities declined.
   Within manufacturing, production increased for all major
industries except transportation equipment and paper.
   Automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 7.5 million
units, down from 7.9 million in December.
   Output at mines was down 1.2 percent in January after a 0.1
percent increase a month earlier. Production at utilities was down
0.8 percent from December, when output had increased 0.9 percent.

   Sunshine Mining Co. said it has abandoned
plans to acquire Rexene Corp., a Dallas-based plastics and
petrochemical maker, in a reported $896 million deal.
   ``We cannot reach agreement with the sellers on price and
terms,'' Sunshine Chief Financial Officer Joseph Denahan said.
   Sunshine said in December that the company known primarily for
silver mining and natural gas production with major operations in
the Idaho panhandle would pay $28 a share for Rexene common stock in
cash and securities.
   The proposal raised concern among some investors over how
Sunshine would finance the deal amid continuous losses the last four
years.
   Sunshine Chairman Michael Boswell had said the company wanted to
obtain a third line of business related to natural resources but
counter-cyclical to oil, gas and precious metals.
   ``I think our strategy continues as it has been and that is to
try to expand our precious metals and oil and gas business both
internally and through acquisition,'' Denahan said.
   Rexene, through its subsidiary Rexene Products Co., makes
thermoplastic resins and petrochemical products.
   Its products are used in many household goods, including food
packaging, toys, linings for disposable diapers and styrene for
production of disposable cups and other containers.

<HEAD>GAF Executive James Sherwin: Thoughtful Chess Master On Trial For
Stock Fraud</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   James T. Sherwin keeps a chess board in his
office at GAF Corp. with the white pieces arranged in a cautious
opening strategy known as the Samish Variation against the King's
Indian Defense.
   Careful, analytical, a risk-taker only when odds are good,
Sherwin's chess style doesn't square with the charges against him in
federal court: that he broke federal law by trying to manipulate the
price of a company's stock.
   Once the third-ranked U.S. chess player and still a prominent
figure in the chess world, the GAF vice chairman faces real-life
checkmate as a key defendant in the first jury trial emanating from
the Wall Street insider trading scandal. He has denied the charges
and vowed to vindicate himself in court. But if convicted on all
counts, Sherwin could get 50 years in prison and fines up to $2.5
million.
   ``You walk into an office and you see a chess set and you wonder
if he beat himself,'' said Charles J. Rose, an analyst with the
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. investment firm, who knows Sherwin personally.
   In a recent session of the trial in U.S. District Court in lower
Manhattan, Sherwin sat intently at the defense table, scrutinizing
damning testimony by Boyd L. Jefferies, a disgraced stockbroker and
admitted felon who is the government's key witness in the GAF case.
   Jefferies alleged Sherwin asked him by telephone in October 1986
to buy Union Carbide Corp. stock in order to artificially inflate
the price, and that Sherwin agreed to compensate him for any losses.
Under federal securities laws, the telephone calls alone would have
been illegal.
   The purpose of the alleged deal was to maximize GAF's gain from
the sale of its holding in Carbide stock after a failed takeover of
the much larger chemical company.
   Friends, corporate analysts and chess colleagues were dumbfounded
when Sherwin was indicted along with GAF last July, saying the
charges belie his character.
   ``He's as likely to do something dishonest as he is to flap his
arms and fly home across the Hudson River,'' said Allen Kaufman,
executive director of the American Chess Foundation, who has known
Sherwin for 40 years.
   ``The funniest thing about this thing is I can't imagine Jim
Sherwin doing what he has allegedly done,'' added chemical industry
analyst Mark Gulley of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``It just does not
add up.''
   Sherwin, 55, declined through his lawyers to be interviewed
during the trial. But associates describe him as deeply analytical,
articulate, self-effacing and cautious both in the office and behind
a chess board.
   At GAF, he was known as a effective administrator who played a
lesser role in major expenditures. Chess players extoll what they
call his integrity, honesty and intense calm.
   Last year, when the Marshall Chess Club in Manhattan was
embroiled in a vote-fraud dispute during board elections, members
turned to Sherwin as an arbiter. Another time, colleagues recall,
Sherwin gave free legal defense to a club member involved in a
fistfight over a chess game.
   Sherwin grew up in the Bronx, playing chess from an early age. He
entered Columbia College at age 16 and went to law school there. At
age 21, Sherwin and Kaufman hitchhiked cross-country to play in a
tournament in California.
   Golombek's Encyclopedia of Chess includes a listing on Sherwin,
describing him as ``a leading American international master in the
1950s and 1960s.''
   Sherwin tied for fifth in the 1953 world junior championships and
placed 17th in a world championships preliminary five years later in
a tournament that included playing companion Bobby Fischer, who went
on to become the world's best player. Fischer included a 1957 game
against Sherwin in his book, ``My 60 Memorable Games.''
   In the late-1950s Sherwin placed third in the U.S. championships
two years running, but after that his results fluctuated, according
to Golombek's, and he rarely played competitively after 1968,
choosing business over chess.
   ``He doubtlessly would have gone to the top had he chosen chess
as a profession,'' Kaufman said.
   ``His style is assertive, determined but sound,'' he said. ``He
won't go off on the flights of fancy the way lesser players do. He
analyzes very, very accurately and deeply and always gets into time
pressure because of that.''
   The description also applies to Sherwin's business style. In 1960
he joined GAF, the Wayne, N.J.-based maker of specialty chemicals
and building materials that also owns WNCN-FM in New York. He
patiently rose through the corporate ranks under the tutelage of
Jesse Werner, GAF's prior chairman.
   In the early-1980s, Sherwin led a failed fight to prevent a
takeover of GAF by the current chairman, Samuel J. Heyman, according
to analysts. He left the company in 1983 for a senior post at
Triangle Industries Inc. just before Heyman triumphed, but returned
a year later after assiduous courting by Heyman.
   Analysts said Sherwin has played a principal role in law,
accounting, tax and staff support matters that helped increase
profits and raise the company's stature.
   ``He showed Heyman how to make the company profitable,'' analyst
Rose said.
   Though he no longer plays chess competitively, Sherwin is
president of the American Chess Foundation, offers chess analysis on
public television for world championship matches and stops by the
Marshall Chess Club to play, as recently as a few weeks ago.
   ``He always wants to find out what the right move is. He wants to
find out the truth of the chess position,'' said Shelby Lyman, a
syndicated chess columnist who has hosted championship broadcasts
with Sherwin six times since 1978.
   ``He's a guy who would do his own income tax and never cheat.
He's been so successful all his life just playing by the rules,''
Lyman said.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III says he
will sell his large stock holdings in a major international lender,
after questions were raised about the potential for conflicts of
interest.
   Baker said Tuesday he will sell his stock in Chemical New York
Corp., which has lent $4.5 billion to Third World nations, as well
as all other publicly traded stocks held in a qualified blind trust.
   Members of Congress had expressed surprise when Baker's stock
holdings were publicized last week, noting that as Treasury
secretary under President Reagan he made decisions affecting the
Third World debt crisis. The same issue confronts him as secretary
of state in the Bush administration.
   Baker's promise to get rid of the stocks was hailed Tuesday at
the White House, where President Bush's ethics chief had questioned
Baker's holdings under a new, stringent interpretation of government
ethics rules.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater issued a statement
saying Baker ``has gone even further than required to insure there
is not even the perception of a conflict of interest.''
   The controversy revolved primarily around Baker's holdings in
Chemical New York.
   While heading the Treasury Department in the Reagan
administration, Baker developed the so-called Baker plan, which
called on Third World nations to make good on their debts as they
restructured their sagging economies. It called for new public and
private lending, but it did not attempt to force the banks to
forgive the loans.
   As Bush's chief adviser on foreign policy, Baker will be forced
to deal with the same nagging problem of the indebted nations, which
owe billions to Western and other commercial banks.
   Baker initially had said he would seek a conflict-of-interest
waiver on Third World issues from the White House. But on Tuesday,
with increasing attention being focused on the issue, he said he
would instruct the trustees in charge of the bank stocks to sell
them.
   Baker made the announcement during a visit to NATO nations. A
Baker spokeswoman, Margaret Tutwiler, said the publicly traded
stocks held by his wife, Susan, and those held for their minor
daughter, Mary Bonner Baker, also will be sold.
   Baker said the decision went ``well beyond'' what was required by
law.
   Baker's holdings were in a qualified blind trust in 1981, when he
was serving as Reagan's White House chief of staff.
   A trustee was in control of the stocks, but under the law Baker
knew what he had put into the trust and was barred from taking
action involving those specific items until the trustee told him
they were either sold or worth less than $1,000.
   ``I think it is the correct decision for someone committed to
meeting the highest ethical standards,'' Baker said in an
announcement distributed to reporters as he flew to Rome from Athens.
   The size of Baker's blind trust and the market value of stocks
that will be sold were not disclosed.
   However, Baker's latest financial disclosure form, filed with the
Office of Government Ethics in January, put a value of ``over
$250,000'' on the assets in the trust.
   The form shows that the secretary received ``over $100,000'' in
income from the trust during the time that was covered, January
through August of 1988. Baker left the Treasury Department last
summer to help then-Vice President Bush's campaign for the Oval
Office.
   The disclosure form also lists the separate property of Mrs.
Baker, which includes 1,087 shares in Houston Industries, with a
valuation between $15,001 and $50,000.
   The report listed assets of daughter Mary as including 5,310
shares of Chemical New York Corp., 196 shares of Exxon Corp. with a
value listed between $5,001 and $15,000; 144 shares of Houston
Industries with a value listed between $1,001 and $5,000; and 330
shares in Trinity Petroleum Trust, with a value listed between
$5,001 and $15,000.
   Baker's bank stocks originally were in Texas Commerce Bancshares,
a holding company that grew out of a bank organized by Baker's
grandfather.
   In May 1987, Texas Commerce was merged with a subsidiary of
Chemical, and Baker became a large holder of the New York
corporation's stock.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said last week that
the White House had undertaken a review of Baker's holdings because
of a more stringent interpretation of government ethics rules based
on a 1987 Justice Department opinion.
   The Office of Government Ethics, interpreting the opinion,
requires officials ``to be more conservative ... than previously
believed necessary by government ethics attorneys,'' Redman said.
   Baker told reporters last week he'd not spoken with White House
ethics chief C. Boyden Gray, but that Gray raised the subject of
selling the Chemical stocks with Robert Kimmit, a Washington lawyer
recently named as Baker's undersecretary of state for political
affairs.
   At that time, Baker said he would seek a conflict-of-interest
waiver permitting him to participate in decisions affecting the
economies of developing nations.
   But Ms. Tutwiler said Baker never asked the White House for the
waiver.
   Meanwhile, a congressional source, speaking on condition he not
be identified, said the Senate Foreign Relations Committee asked
Baker last week for more information about his holdings.
   The committee had approved Baker's nomination for the State
Department post shortly before Bush's inauguration.
   Now that Baker has decided to sell his stocks, the issue may be
moot, the source said.

of domestic oil production, imports from reliable suppliers and the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the government's underground stockpile
of 555 million barrels, the Commerce Department study said.
   It added that forced curtailment of fuel use by the general
public during wartime would result in serious economic hardships.
   ``Our analysis concludes that the United States will be able to
meet direct and indirect military petroleum requirements during a
major conventional war,'' said the report, released Tuesday.
   The report was prepared by the Commerce Department's Bureau of
Export Administration at the request of a coalition of energy
industry groups, which asserted in a petition that the domestic oil
industry has been so damaged by rising imports that it could not
meet the military's fuel needs in the event of a major war.
   In rejecting the industry group's claim, the Commerce Department
said the group had underestimated the extent to which fuel use in
the private sector could be reduced in the event of a national
defense mobilization and an actual military conflict.
   The report said civilian use of fuel could be reduced by more
than the 10 percent assumed by the industry group.
   Meanwhile, an industry trade group said U.S. oil imports soared
to more than 8 million barrels per day in January for the first time
since 1980 as demand rose sharply and domestic production continued
to dwindle.
   The American Petroleum Institute, which represents major oil
producers and refiners, said U.S. oil production fell to 7.9 million
barrels a day, a 3.4 percent drop from January 1988.
   Imports of oil surged to an average of 8.2 million barrels a day,
an increase of 20.6 percent over the January 1988 level of 6.8
million barrels. It was the first month that imports averaged more
than 8 million barrels since 1980, the API said.
   The Commerce Department report recommended a series of actions
aimed at improving U.S. energy security. These included:
   _Removing the remaining controls on the price of natural gas.
This would be expected to increase use of natural gas, thus helping
reduce the need for oil imports.
   _Permit oil exploration and development on the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge Coastal Plain in Alaska and on the Outer Continental
Shelf. The industry considers these the most promising domestic oil
prospects, although opponents say drilling in these areas would
cause too much environmental damage.
   _Providing greater tax incentives for independent oil drillers.
   All three recommendations are contained as well in President
Bush's 1990 budget.
   The report assumed 1987 levels of domestic oil production, or
about 8.3 million barrels a day. Output last year fell to about 8.2
million barrels daily and the Energy Department foresees an
accelerating decline in the 1990s.
   Domestic oil production has been declining since 1986, when world
oil prices collapsed from about $30 a barrel to below $10 a barrel.
Prices currently are in a range of $15-$17 a barrel, which the
nation's oil producers contend is too low to prevent a further drop
in production and rise in imports.
   The Energy Department said last month that oil imports, currently
running at about 38 percent of total oil supplies, would jump above
50 percent by 1994 and could approach 60 percent before the end of
the century.
   The Commerce report said the nation was better prepared for an
energy crisis than in 1979, when a brief pinch on Iranian oil
supplies sent world oil prices soaring, but that nevertheless
``petroleum imports threaten to impair the national security.''
   Jim Groninger, director of governmental affairs for the
Independent Petroleum Association of America, said his group was
disappointed in the report's outcome.
   ``It came to the right conclusions, in that there is a national
security issue here, but it didn't take the next logical step in
promoting a serious set of solutions,'' Groninger said.

<HEAD>British Airways' Profit Up 44 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways PLC said its profit jumped 44
percent in the third quarter of its fiscal year, boosted largely by
its acquisition of British Caledonian Airways.
   British Airways reported Wednesday that its net profit in the
three months ended Dec. 31 rose to 33 million pounds, or around $58
million, from 23 million pounds, or $41 million, a year earlier.
Earnings per share for the quarter increased to 4.6 pence, or 8
cents, from 3.2 pence, or 6 cents.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 20 percent to 1 billion pounds, or
$1.77 billion, from 831 million pounds, or $1.5 billion.
   British Airways Chairman Lord King said British Caledonian has
been ``successfully merged and we can look forward to the benefits
of the acquisition being reflected in future results.'' British
Airways acquired the rival airline in 1987 for 253 million pounds,
or $448 million.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, British Airways'
profit was only slightly higher, however.
   Net profit for the nine months edged up 1.7 percent to 177
million pounds, or $313 million, from 174 million pounds, or $308
million, in the year-earlier period. Earnings per share rose to 24.6
pence, or 44 cents, from 24.2 pence, or 43 cents.
   Nine-month revenue increased 15 percent to 3.26 billion pounds,
or $5.8 billion, from 2.84 billion pounds, or $5 billion.
   King said the results for both periods were ``encouraging, with
the long-haul routes showing very satisfactory growth.''
   He said the outlook was good for passenger and cargo loads,
``particularly on long-haul routes, which remain high for the time
of year.''
   However, ``with increased competition, we must make sure that we
are competing effectively not only in terms of product and service,
but also on cost,'' the chairman said.

<HEAD>English Wine: An Industry In Ferment</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto LON5 of Feb. 14</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lot of English wine should never have been made,
admits the head of the English Vineyards Association.
   ``Or, if it's made, it shouldn't be drunk, and certainly not sold
for money,'' says retired British Navy Commander Geoffrey Bond.
   ``But having said that, there is far, far less, proportionately,
bad English wine than almost anybody else's.''
   English wine?
   Yes, this land of lager lovers and sherry sippers has a
burgeoning domestic wine industry.
   Even fans admit it will never never push the great European
vintages off the shelves, mainly because few grape varieties can
survive, thrive and ripen in the cold, wet climate.
   But England's 360 vineyards did produce 108,500 gallons of wine
in 1987, and the industry gets about 10 percent bigger every year,
Bond said.
   Most English wines are white and more sweet than dry. They're
best as aperitifs or accompaniments to white meat, fruit and salads.
   ``There is a very clean and distinct crispness, a fresh crispness
about English wine, which follows a very flowery bouquet,'' Bond
said. ``There is perhaps a tendency to sharpness and acidity which,
rather than condemning it, identifies it.''
   Wine writer Kathryn McWhirter says tactfully, ``I think they're
quite interesting as a sort of rare occasion drink because they're
English and it's interesting to drink wines from different places.''
   Most have good fruit flavor, she said, but ``they tend to be
rather thin.''
   English vineyards are concentrated among the farms and fruit
orchards of the southeast, but grapes grow as far west as Truro, in
Cornwall, and one even claims to be the world's most northerly
commercial vineyard.
   The Romans planted the first English grapes about 2,000 years
ago, and the Domesday Book records nearly 50 vineyards in southern
England in 1086.
   King Henry VIII wiped out the industry when he closed the last
Roman Catholic monastery in 1526, at a time when the map of the
monasteries mirrored the map of the vineyards.
   A renaissance began after World War II when scientist-cum-amateur
gardener Ray Barrington Brock set out, as a hobby, to discover which
grapes would grow best in southern England.
   For years, winemaking remained a hobby and tax writeoff, and most
vintners need another source of income to survive.
   David Westphal of Penshurst Vineyards in Kent relies on tourism
and his apple orchard, and, in honor of his father's Australian
roots, raises rare sheep and small kangaroos called wallabies. A
wallaby is hidden in every label on his wine bottles.
   Westphal says one of his biggest problems is getting the English
to try English wine: ``The English are very conservative, they don't
like to try... Quite often you get the response, `Ooohhh, that's
nice,' you know, as if you were going to give them arsenic.''
   Only 1,350 acres of land is devoted to English vineyards, which
Bond admits is ``infinitesimally small'' compared with Germany or
California.
   At full production, and with better weather, output could
increase tenfold, Bond said. Recent summers have been particularly
wet, and gales ruined much of the 1987 crop.
   English winegrowers favor hardy German grapes, particularly
Mueller Thurgau, a cross between the Riesling and Sylvaner vines.
It's Germany's most widely grown grape, and accounts for 30 percent
of all grapes planted in England, Bond said.
   There just isn't enough sun to ripen red grapes for a full-bodied
wine, he said, although a handful of brave souls continue to
experiment.
   Most English wine is sold directly from the winery or to local
hotels and restaurants. Very little is exported, and it's difficult
to find in London stores.
   However, Carr Taylor Vineyards near Hastings in the southeast
sells its sparkling wine to French hotels and eateries, including
the second-stage restaurant at the Eiffel Tower, and supplies its
1987 Schonburger, a still white wine, on some British Airways routes
to Canada.
   Elmham Park Winery in Norfolk, more than 100 miles northeast of
London, claims to be the world's most northerly commercial vineyard,
and said it recently sold 200 cases of its blended 1986 dry white
wine to a Parisian wine merchant.
   Many English wines _ not to be confused with British wines which
are made from imported concentrates _ are available in the $7 range.
   To the consternation of winemakers, as much as $1.75 of the
bottle price is is excise tax, four times the average of the
12-nation European Economic Community to which Britain belongs.

<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Limited Inc. said its fourth-quarter profit
soared 90 percent from a year earlier, boosted by a change in
merchandising strategy.
   The specialty apparel retailer reported Tuesday that its
fourth-quarter net income jumped to $120.1 million, or 67 cents a
share, from $63.3 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter sales rose to $1.35 billion from $1 billion in the
year-earlier period.
   The performance in the quarter represents ``the results of
merchandising views that started to coalesce in May,'' said Ken
Gilman, Limited's executive vice president and chief financial
officer.
   ``We developed strong feelings about fall merchandise during the
back-to-school period, and those strong feelings enabled us to
position for a strong fourth quarter,'' he said.
   For the year, the retailer reported net income of $245.1 million,
or $1.36 a share, up from $235.2 million, or $1.25 a share, in 1987.
Annual sales rose to $4.07 billion from $3.5 billion the previous
year.
   The company operates 3,381 specialty apparel stores throughout
the United States under the names The Limited, Express, Henri
Bendel, Victoria's Secret, Lerner, Lane Bryant, Lerner Woman and
Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. It also distributes apparel nationally through
its Brylane and Victoria's Secret catalogue divisions.

   Stock prices closed mixed in slow trading Wednesday
as buying interest dried up amid uncertainty about the outlook for
interest rates and British corporate earnings.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 1.6
points, or 0.1 percent, at 2,047.5. The index moved down as much as
8.7 points in the afternoon, but then recovered on the back of early
gains on Wall Street. At its best, the index was up 6.4 points at
midmorning.
   Volume fell to 468.5 million shares from Tuesday's 534.1 million
shares.
   Dealers said the market had room to fall after its strong rally
since the start of the year. But significant buying interest in the
futures market for the second day in a row supported the underlying
equities, they said.
   Share prices have been ``artificially held up all day by the
futures,'' said one equity salesman.
   British inflation remains a key concern for the market,
particularly ahead of Thursday's report on average earnings and
Friday's retail price index, dealers said.
   The market is bracing for further rises in inflation after
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson signaled that the annual
inflation rate would top 7 percent for January.
   ``We know it's going to be over 7 percent, it's just a question
of how much,'' said one trader.

<HEAD>Scientists Developing Microrobot to Travel in Human Body</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese scientists have begun developing a tiny
robot to move inside the human body to treat diseased tissue, a
professor said Wednesday.
   The scientists eventually hope to produce a robot that can
transmit its location and findings, and can cut or otherwise treat
diseased parts, said Iwao Fujimasa of Tokyo University's Research
Center for Advanced Science and Technology.
   ``Researchers for many years have sent probes to study the oceans
and outer space. We hope to be able to study the inner world,''
Fujimasa said.
   Fujimasa, an artificial heart specialist, said the goal is a
robot less than 0.04 inches in size that will be able to travel
through veins and inside organs.
   The project will require that the smallest currently available
parts, such as motors, gears and screws, be reduced to about
one-thousandth their present size, he said.
   Even with a robot that size, the team will need to study how to
minimize problems created by its presence in the body, such as
blocking blood flow, Fujimasa said.
   The group includes scientists from schools such as Tokyo
University and Tokyo Institute of Technology, and from companies
such as Toyota, Hitachi and Sumitomo Electric Industries, he said.
   Fujimasa said Japan's high level of semiconductor manufacturing
technology, which is capable of producing components less than 1
micron in size, would aid the project.
   Since September, the group has received financial support from
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Fujimasa said. It
hopes the ministry will agree to fund a $80 million International
Micromachine Center and provide annual funding of $1.6 million, he
said.

<TEXT>
   A jury has decided Wells Fargo Bank
overcharged its credit card customers $5.2 million in fees for
making payments late and exceeding credit limits.
   The Superior Court verdict Tuesday, in the first of several
similar suits against major banks, entitles holders of MasterCard
and Visa cards from Wells Fargo between July 1982 and May 1987 to
$4.1 million in refunds for late-payment fees and more than $1
million for over-limit fees.
   The jury agreed with lawyers for a group of bank customers that
Wells Fargo failed to make a reasonable attempt to set its fees no
higher than its costs. But jurors awarded less than half the $11
million the plaintiffs sought.
   Lawyers for the customers said Wells Fargo charged between $3 and
$5 for paying bills late while spending only $1.89 to process each
late payment. The lawyers said the bank charged $10 for exceeding
credit limits but spent only $1 to $2 for each excessive charge.
   ``We claimed you can't impose one of these charges (above costs)
as a penalty to get someone to comply with a contract. That's
illegal,'' said S. Chandler Visher, a lawyer for the customers.
   ``Other banks have been doing the same thing,'' he said. ``Each
case will be evaluated separately. But with this win, other banks
are going to start to think that this can happen to them. They may
want to settle out (of court).''
   Visher, who also represents customers in several other bank
suits, said similar suits are pending against Crocker National Bank,
Security Pacific Bank, Barclays Bank, Eureka Savings and Loan, and
First Interstate Bank. The Wells Fargo case was the first to go to
trial.
   Weyman Lundquist, a lawyer for Wells Fargo, said he and the bank
were not unhappy with the amount of the verdict but planned to
appeal.
   Wells Fargo believes its fees accurately reflect the total cost,
including indirect administrative costs, of handling late payments
and excessive charges, Lundquist said.
   Superior Court Judge Robert Dossee is to hear arguments next week
on whether he should order Wells Fargo to reduce its fees.

<TEXT>
   Nissan is shifting $9 million in planned
magazine advertising for its 1989 models to television, the Japanese
carmaker's top U.S. ad man said Wednesday.
   Joe Opre, national advertising manager for Nissan Motor Corp.
USA, said the company already has spent $27 million on magazine ads
for 1989 and will resume magazine ads with introduction of the 1990
models in October or November.
   ``You get more visibility in the short term, a lot more reach a
lot faster,'' he said. ``It's an attempt or desire to get things
rolling maybe a little bit faster in terms of hitting our sales
goal.''
   In the first quarter of the 1989 model year, Nissan's share of
the import market dropped to 36 percent from 39 percent a year
earlier.
   The Magazine Publishers of America sent a contingent from its New
York headquarters to meet with Nissan officials in this Los Angeles
suburb this week seeking reassurances.
   ``We just want to find out what Nissan is thinking,'' said Jim
Gunther, executive vice president of the magazine trade group.
   Nissan will continue advertising in magazines aimed at car buffs
and at the black and Hispanic markets. The latter decision, Opre
said, grew out of a commitment to those magazines and to increasing
visibility in minority communities.
   On Feb. 3, Nissan settled a discrimination complaint before the
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by agreeing to pay
$605,000 and promote blacks, Hispanics, women and older workers.

   Blue chips led the way as the stock market
rallied Wednesday, breaking out of a week-long slump.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen 65.89
points over the five previous sessions, climbed 22.68 to 2,303.93.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
907 up, 556 down and 498 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 154.22 million
shares, up from 149.56 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 183.19 million shares.
   Interest rates, which have been climbing of late, pulled back a
bit in the credit markets Wednesday.
   Analysts said that evidently encouraged traders to do some
selective buying of stocks, especially in the blue-chip sector and
in issues involved in takeover rumors and speculation.
   In the economic news, the Federal Reserve Board reported a 0.3
percent increase in industrial production last month.
   The figure came in slightly below what most analysts had been
expecting, and thus didn't do much to aggravate the inflation
worries that have been dogging both the stock and bond markets.
   In the closing stages of the session, the market's advance
carried the Dow Jones industrials past the 2,300 level, which some
chart-watching analysts had suggested might be shaping up as a
psychological obstacle.
   Polaroid rose 1[ to 42|. Shamrock Holdings Inc., which is making
a hostile takeover bid for the company, said it plans to step up a
campaign to replace Polaroid directors.
   Tambrands gained 3 to 62{ amid takeover speculation.
   Claire's Stores, which estimated record profits for the quarter
ended Jan. 28, gained | to 7}.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, up 2\ at 127; General Electric, up | at 46\; American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up \ at 31\, and General Motors, up } at 89].
   Airline stocks, a hot group in recent weeks, added to their
recent gains. UAL rose 1~ to 127[; AMR 1\ to 60; Delta Air Lines }
to 56\, and NWA 1] to 67[.
   Analysts say investors have turned bullish on airlines in the
belief that the industry is emerging from a long period of
turbulence created by deregulation.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $20.93 billion, or 0.73
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
1.27 to 165.21.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.10 to 339.84, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up 2.43 at 294.24.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
2.15 to 404.17. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 325.02, up 2.06.

<HEAD>Conrail Names Longtime Railroader New Chairman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED DUNCOMBE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conrail on Wednesday elected a 77-year-old
railroader as interim chairman to succeed Richard D. Sanborn, who
died of an apparent heart attack after just six weeks as the freight
railroad's top executive.
   Philadelphia-based Conrail's board of directors said the
appointment of Stanley E.G. Hillman was temporary. The board set no
timetable for finding a permanent top executive but said it would
move quickly.
   Hillman was trustee of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pacific
Railroad in 1978-79 and served as chairman and chief executive
officer of Illinois Central Gulf Railroad from 1976-78.
   He has been a Conrail board member since 1980 and was on the
search committees that selected Sanborn and his predecessor, L.
Stanley Crane. Many analysts expected Conrail to appoint Crane
temporarily.
   Andrew Geller, a transportation analyst with Provident National
Bank in Philadelphia, said the election indicated Conrail will
``just go back to square one'' and search both inside and outside
the company for a permanent head.
   Conrail probably will seek ``someone with direct railroad
experience, direct marketing experience with railroads and someone
who is very tough with costs,'' Geller added.
   Sanborn, 52, died Sunday in Baltimore after an apparent heart
attack at his home. Services were Wednesday afternoon at Old St.
Paul's Episcopal Church in Baltimore.
   Sanborn was Crane's handpicked successor. Crane was credited with
leading Conrail to profitability and enabling it to be returned to
the private sector after 11 years of government ownership.
   Hillman was appointed trustee of the Milwaukee Road in January
1978 to oversee its reorganization plans under federal bankruptcy
laws. He proposed trimming the 9,800-mile railway system to 2,500
miles, a plan that was carried out in modified form before its sale
to the Soo Line in 1985.
   Hillman also served as president of the Illinois Central's parent
company, IC Industries, from 1971-77 and as vice chairman of IC
Industries in 1977-78.
   Conrail was formed by Congress in 1976 to reorganize six bankrupt
Northeast railroads, the Penn Central, Erie Lackawanna, Reading,
Central of New Jersey, Lehigh Valley and Lehigh &amp; Hudson River.
   It was sold in March 1987 for $1.6 billion in the largest public
stock offering in U.S. history.
   Conrail has been trying to build its traffic in such areas as
automobile shipping after concentrating on rebuilding track, gaining
clearance for double-stacked container cars and other equipment
needs.
   Under Sanborn, Conrail had been expected to try to expand into
such areas as hauling refuse and had discussed acquiring some
smaller rail lines.

<HEAD>Imports Surge In January, While Domestic Production Falls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil imports last month surged to the highest rate
since 1980 as domestic production fell and consumption rose,
reviving fears that foreign producers may soon control more than
half of U.S. oil supplies, energy analysts said Wednesday.
   The American Petroleum Institute, which represents major oil
producers and refiners, said U.S. crude oil production fell to 7.9
million barrels a day, a 3.4 percent drop from January 1988.
   Alaskan production, which in recent years offset declines in
other parts of the United States, slipped for the second straight
month with no major new oil fields tapped, the Washington,
D.C.-based group said in its monthly report. About a quarter of U.S.
oil comes from Alaska.
   Imports of oil and oil products surged to a rate of 8.2 million
barrels a day, an increase of 20.6 percent over the January 1988
level of 6.8 million barrels. It was the first month that imports
averaged more than 8 million barrels since 1980, the API said.
   Last year, imports jumped to the highest level since 1979 and
domestic production hit a 12-year low, according to an earlier API
report.
   Of the 18.3 million barrels of oil consumed daily in the United
States, 45 percent is from foreign sources and experts say that
number will soon exceed 50 percent.
   About 15 percent of U.S. imports are from Persian Gulf countries.
Larger percentages come from Latin America, including Venezuela and
Mexico, and from the North Sea.
   ``We better do something to ensure that this dependency doesn't
cause us economic and security problems,'' said John Sawhill, former
deputy energy secretary and now a director of the McKinsey &amp; Co.
Inc. management consultant firm.
   ``We're putting ourselves in a situation where we're gradually
going to become more dependent and at some point OPEC is going to be
in a position to curtail our supplies.''
   Weak oil prices have curtailed incentives to find and develop new
oil in the United States. Furthermore, because imports are cheaper,
experts predict they will continue increasing.
   Proven, or recoverable, U.S. reserves are about 26.5 billion
barrels, or 3 percent of total world reserves, said John Redpatch,
an oil analyst with Security Analysis Inc. in Washington.
   That compared with 170 billion barrels, or 19 percent, of proven
reserves held by Saudi Arabia, he said.
   ``Out of all the oil left in the world today to be produced and
exploited...about two-thirds is in the Middle East,'' he said. ``So
sooner or later if we continue consuming oil the way we do now we
are going to become dependent on Middle East supplies _ sometime in
the next century.''
   A Commerce Department study released Tuesday said that although
growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil is a long-range threat to
national security, it has not jeopardized the Pentagon's ability to
fight a major non-nuclear war, so no government action is needed to
restrict oil imports.
   However, proposals are expected in Congress for an oil import fee
aimed at curbing the trend toward growing imports and shrinking
domestic output.
   The institute's latest report also said demand for oil and oil
products surged last month, with deliveries up more than 6 percent
from the previous year for the third consecutive month.
Approximately 18.3 million barrels a day of petroleum products were
supplied in January, compared with 17.2 million barrels in January a
year ago.
   Despite the increase in imports, inventories fell 13 million
barrels, or 2.3 percent, with part of the decline the result of
higher refinery activity. Refinery utilization rose from a rate of
82.8 percent to 85.4 percent, the highest monthly level since 1979.
   Gasoline deliveries jumped last month by 5.8 percent to a rate of
7 million barrels per day, compared with 6.68 million barrels in
January 1988.
   Home heating oil and diesel fuel, in the distillate category,
rose 4.7 percent last month, while kerosene jet fuel rose 3.3
percent and residual oil was up 9.3 percent compared with the
previous January.

<HEAD>Federal Mortgage Company Reports Earnings Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., which
buys mortgages and packages them into securities for investors, said
Wednesday its earnings rose 26 percent in the fourth quarter of 1988.
   Net income for the October-December quarter totaled $97 million,
up from $77 million in the final quarter of 1987.
   For all of last year, earnings totaled $381 million, or $5.73 per
share, up from $301 million in 1987, or $4.53 per share.
   David Glenn, Freddie Mac executive vice president, attributed the
gain to a decline in corporate income tax rates.
   Also, an increase in short-term interest rates enabled the
corporation to increase its ``float benefit,'' or the income earned
on money collected from mortgage payers before it is passed to
investors holding Freddie Mac securities.
   Glenn said the income gains triggered by those factors were
partly offset by a drop in fee income caused by increased
competition and less mortgage origination activity.

<HEAD>Dollar Down Again But Above Its Lowest Levels; Gold Off</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede LONDON-BC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar retreated across a broad front before
recovering some lost ground Wednesday in hectic dealings.
   Gold fell. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a gold
bid of $383.60 a troy ounce late Wednesday, off 80 cents from
Tuesday's bid.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar endured a surprisingly
deep plunge early in the session as sellers acted aggressively. The
depth of the dive brought fresh buying by market operators
realigning their currency holdings.
   The result was the dollar finished Wednesday near its opening
levels and slightly below Tuesday's close.
   ``We had quite a wild day,'' said John McCarthy, chief dealer at
Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank. ``The violence in the movements were as
much generated by technical factors as by bearish sentiment.''
   Dealers also described the dollar's sell-off as an expected
correction after the strong advance it made earlier this year.
   They said the dollar has dipped over the past week because of
skepticism about the ability of the Bush administration to cut the
budget deficit and uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve
intends to raise interest rates to combat inflation.
   In London, one British pound traded late at $1.7805, over 2 cents
more expensive for buyers than Tuesday's late $1.7588.
   Later, in New York, a pound cost $1.7743 compared with $1.77375
Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with levels late
Monday included: 1.8405 West German marks, down from 1.84325;
126.125 Japanese yen, down from 126.305; 1.56225 Swiss francs, down
from 1.56325; 1.1796 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1835; and 6.2637
French francs, down from 6.2715.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with Tuesday's late
levels were: 1.8315 West German marks, down from 1.8615; 1.5565
Swiss francs, down from 1.5815; 6.2425 French francs, down from
6.3325; 2.0680 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1015; 1,339.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,355.05; and, 1.1800 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1835.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar dropped to 125.90 Japanese yen, down
from 127.20. In London late Wednesday, the dollar traded lower at
125.72 yen.
   Gold bullion prices fell in active trading, the weaker dollar
having no effect.
   Usually, when the dollar falls the gold price rises as it makes a
safer hedge for investors. But traders said gold market operators
are wary of pushing the price higher in case the dollar resumes its
recent rally.
   The late London bid price of gold was $382.00 a troy ounce, down
from $386.25. The late Zurich bid price was $381.60, down from
$385.50.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
declined to $384.60 a troy ounce from $385.40 Tuesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $384.66 bid, down from
$388.68.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.79 bid a troy ounce,
down from $5.83.
   On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery finished at
$5.89 a troy ounce, up from Tuesday's settlement of $5.828.

<HEAD>Secret Miltary Project Causes Large Fourth-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northrop Corp. lost $86.1 million in the
fourth quarter of 1988 because of provisions for an expected $150
million loss associated with a secret military project, the
aerospace company said Wednesday.
   Company officials declined to identify the nature of the research
and development project but said it did not involve the B-2 stealth
bomber it built for the Air Force.
   The quarterly loss compared with a profit of $34.9 million, or 74
cents a share, recorded in the same period last year.
   Fourth-quarter sales also dropped, by 2 percent to $1.73 billion,
compared with $1.77 billion during the same 1987 quarter.
   The $150 million fourth-quarter charge ``resulted from the
company's conclusion that it will probably sustain a loss on certain
classified long-term fixed-price research and development
contracts,'' Northrop said in a statement.
   The company said it was negotiating with the Pentagon to make up
some of the unanticipated costs on the project. A company spokesman
refused to elaborate.
   For the full year, Northrop reported earnings of $104.2 million,
or $2.22 a share, an 11 percent increase over $94.2 million, or
$2.01 per share, in 1987.
   Northrop officials said the annual increase was made possible by
tax breaks related to the fourth-quarter loss. Because of the loss,
the company got a tax benefit of 42.7 percent in 1988, in contrast
to its tax rate of 31.4 percent the year before.
   The sales decline, which was 4 percent for the full year, was
largely the result of reduced research and development on several
classified projects and fewer deliveries of fuselages for the Navy's
F-A-18 Hornet fighter.
   Northrop makes the fuselage for the prime contractor, McDonnell
Douglas Corp.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Surge On News Of Cuts By Non-OPEC Members</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices broke through an important price barrier
and posted significant gains Wednesday after reports that non-OPEC
oil producers have proposed limiting their output of crude oil by
300,000 barrels a day, as well as rumors of contaminated oil stocks
in Louisiana.
   On other markets, soybeans added modestly to Tuesday's strong
gains; platinum surged despite a continuing gold slump; and cattle
and pork futures were off slightly in advance of a government report
that traders fear could show too many animals are already at feed
lots.
   Crude oil futures settled 83 cents higher in the spot month of
March, with the contract for delivery reaching $18.25 a barrel.
Gains ranging from 29 cents to 66 cents were registered in the back
months at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   ``The crude (oil) market started off going nowhere, but once it
heard an offer was on the table for that kind of a cut, it pushed
through a lot of resistance at $17.85 level,'' said Peter Beutel, of
Elders Futures Inc.
   A report originating in London said a number of non-OPEC
producers ranging from Mexico to the Soviet Union have indicated a
willingness to cut their combined production before a meeting with
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries set for
London sometime next month.
   ``Then the market stalled again at $18,'' said Beutel, ``and we
got a second boost from rumors of contaminated stocks in Louisiana.
No one pinned it down,'' he added, ``but in the absence of being
clear, we saw some very good buying.''
   Louisiana state officials said there was no contamination of
stocks. The rumors most likely were sparked by state environmental
officials' plans to adopt emergency rules for storage and handling
of oil field pipe that has been contaminated after use in
radioactive soil.
   The runup in crude oil helped heating stocks climb 1.29 cents to
1.64 cents higher, with March at 48.74 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline rose .45 cent to 1.44 cents, with March at 48.77 cents a
gallon.
   Soybeans, meanwhile, got most of their support from the nearby
soybean oil pit at the Chicago Board of Trade. Traders said export
business for the oils and fears of supply tightness because of a
decline in Malaysian stocks helped firm up prices in both pits.
   Weather, however, was again the market's dominant motivating
factor, and it was bearish on two counts. Traders said the rain and
snow in the Midwest would replenish soil moisture for the resumption
next month of spring planting. And steady rain in South America is
expected to help developing crops there.
   That dampened bean prices, as well as prices for the grains.
   Wheat was 1 cent lower to 1} cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in March at $4.25\ a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1\ cents
higher, with March at $2.71 a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 cent
lower, with March at $2.08{ a bushel; and soybeans were 3\ cents
higher to 5} cents higher, with March at $7.38{ a bushel.
   Gold plummeted to a new low for the year in early trading at the
Comex, but recouped most of its losses for the day, settling 80
cents to $1 lower, with February at $384.60 a troy ounce.
   Silver registered rises of 5.8 cents to 6.7 cents, with February
at 5.89 a troy ounce, but platinum was the best performer among the
precious metals Wednesday, climbing $5.90 across the board, with
February at $536.20 a troy ounce.
   Platinum has been improving steadily since dropping sharply in
recent months following a Ford Motor Co. announcement that it had
developed a substitute for the metal in catalytic converter used in
automobiles.
   Livestock and pork futures were mostly lower at the Chicago
Mercantile as traders braced for the release Thursday of the USDA's
cattle-on-feed report.
   ``There's some apprehension the report will show plenty of cattle
on the feed lots,'' said Charlie Richardson of Lind-Waldock Inc.,
Denver. ``Cattle's been the strength of the whole meat complex
recently, and with those marking time, there wasn't much reason to
walk in and buy hogs.''
   Live cattle settled .50 cent lower to .18 cent higher, with
February at 74.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .43 cent lower
to .02 cent higher, with March at 81.82 cents a pound; live hogs
were .38 cent lower to .02 cent higher, with February at 41.82 cents
a pound; and frozen pork bellies were unchanged to a limit-down 2
cents, with February at 37.82 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   American industry is using more of its capacity
than at any other time in nearly a decade, the government said
Wednesday in a report that showed operating rates approaching levels
that can worsen inflation.
   The stock and bond markets were not alarmed by the report. Bond
prices rose modestly and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial
stocks climbed 22.68 to 2,303.93. The dollar fell sharply but later
made back most of its losses.
   The Federal Reserve Board said January's operating rate of 84.4
percent of capacity was unchanged from December, for which the
figure was revised upward from an earlier estimate of 84.2 percent.
   The operating rate for January and December has not been
surpassed since October 1979, when factories were functioning at
84.6 percent of capacity.
   ``Historically, capacity utilization rates of around 85 percent
are the flashpoints for a speedup in inflation,'' said Robert
DeFina, senior economist for Security Pacific National Bank in Los
Angeles. ``There are signs that things are getting tight, that
inflation pressures are building.''
   In a related report Wednesday, the Fed reported that its
industrial production index in January climbed 0.3 percent following
a revised increase of 0.5 percent in December. January's increase
was paced by a 0.5 percent rise in manufacturing production.
   The Fed's industrial production index now stands at 141.1 percent
of its 1977 base, 5 percent higher than a year earlier.
   Economist Michael K. Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm,
said the reports show ``there's no sign of a slowdown in the
economy'' despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to restrain economic
growth and keep inflation in check by pushing up interest rates.
   Evans said the ``portents are right'' for the Fed to push rates
even higher, partly as a backlash against President Bush's comments
this week that he would ``not like to see'' the Fed tighten credit
further.
   But Richard Rahn, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, said that reports indicate industrial expansion was
unnecessarily restrained by the Fed's tightening.
   ``Further hiking of the rates will restrict investment in
capacity equipment even more and hold down further growth in
capacity,'' Rahn said.
   As use of industrial capacity rises, so does concern that
factories will have trouble keeping up with orders, leading to
shortages and price increases.
   January's report showed operating rates at manufacturing plants
up 0.2 percentage point to 84.8 percent, while activity at mines and
utilities decreased.
   Capacity utilization for durable goods _ ``big ticket'' items
expected to last more than three years _ rose 0.1 percentage point
to 83.3 percent, while the rate for non-durable goods increased 0.3
percentage points to 86.9 percent.
   Even higher operating rates existed in several industries,
including primary metals, at 91.6 percent of capacity; petroleum
products, 89.1 percent; chemicals, 89.2 percent; and paper products,
94.6 percent.
   Automobile plants, meanwhile, slipped to 75.7 percent of
capacity, down from 79.8 percent in the previous month. The
production report showed autos were assembled at an annual rate of
7.5 million units, down from 7.9 million in December.
   Economist Cynthia Latta of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,
Mass., said that while the reports didn't indicate growth has been
so strong the economy will overheat, the capacity utilization
figures also ``don't suggest that we can stop worrying about
inflation.''
   DeFina said the message was that ``the economy remained healthy
as it entered the new year. It indicates that the things the Fed is
worrying about, inflation pressures ... are still there.''
   Consumer prices rose 4.4 percent last year, identical to the 1987
gain. The first look at consumer prices in the new year will come
with the release of January's report on Feb. 22.
   Wholesale prices in January shot up at their fastest pace in
nearly three years, the Labor Department said last week.
   A third economic report released Wednesday showed that business
inventories rose 0.9 percent in December while sales jumped 0.8
percent, leaving the ratio of inventories to sales unchanged at 1.50.
   That means it would take 1.5 months to exhaust inventories at the
December sales pace reported by the Commerce Department.
   If not accompanied by rising sales, increasing inventories can
signal economic weakness because they may lead manufacturers to
order production cuts and layoffs while reserve goods are sold off.
   Ms. Latta said it was a positive development that inventories
remained under control because companies won't be left holding big
surpluses in the event of an economic downturn.
   ``If inventories are lean, then the effect of a slowdown is
cushioned,'' she said.
   The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and
backlots in December rose to a seasonally adjusted $760.6 billion,
while sales reached $508.2 billion.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Surge Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude oil futures surged Wednesday, fueled by a
report that non-OPEC producers may cut production.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 83 cents
to $18.25 a barrel, breaking through what analysts said was a
crucial technical barrier at $18. The contract closed at $17.42 on
Tuesday. Other contract months also rose.
   The jump in crude prices helped pull up refined product prices,
traders said. Unleaded gasoline scheduled for release next month
rose 1.44 cents to close the day at 48.77 cents a gallon, while
heating oil increased 1.36 cents to 48.74 cents a gallon. Contracts
for delivery after March also rose.
   Traders said the market opened higher but slid early despite a
weekly American Petroleum Institute report showing that crude oil
stocks fell 7.6 million barrels a day last week. The report proved
neutral for the market because it offset the previous week's
statistics that showed a 7 million barrel rise in crude inventories.
   About midday, a report quoting a representative of a non-OPEC
observer nation rallied the market, said Nauman Barakat, vice
president of energy investments at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The report said a group of producers outside the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries is considering a 300,000 barrel-a-day
cut in output.
   ``The report indicated it's a deal already done,'' Barakat said.
He said such an agreement would be formalized at a meeting next week.
   The non-OPEC group is scheduled to meet in London on Monday and
Tuesday. A similar meeting last month adjourned without producing an
accord, but the group issued a statement saying it supported recent
cutbacks by OPEC.
   Wednesday's energy prices also got a lift from a report that
Louisiana oil field pipes are contaminated, said Andrew Lebow,
senior broker and analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   Louisiana state officials said there was no contamination of
stocks. The rumors most likely were sparked by state environmental
officials' plans to adopt emergency rules for storage and handling
of oil field pipe that has been contaminated after use in
radioactive soil.
   The state's Department of Environmental Quality is enacting
emergency rules next week for the pipes until formal rules can be
adopted in about 120 days.
   Lebow said the report was bullish because it led to concerns
about possible production cutbacks.

   The militant Machinists union announced overwhelming
support Wednesday for a strike against Eastern Airlines next month
unless a contract is signed, while the carrier charged that an
illegal work slowdown has backed up 19 aircraft and delayed flights.
   In other developments, the union contended that Eastern
management has brought recruitment of possible strikebreakers to its
home turf.
   Charles Bryan, Machinists district president, told members at a
packed union hall meeting that 97.33 percent of the voting
membership authorized a strike if no contract is reached.
   The final ballots were cast Tuesday in Atlanta, the count was
completed late Wednesday afternoon, and participation was 77
percent, Bryan said.
   After announcing the vote, the union leader charged that Eastern
has been stalling talks.
   ``They have not moved in 16 months in their original opening
position,'' Bryan said. ``They are not negotiating. This strike vote
simply means that if they continue in that mode and do not
negotiate, there will be a strike on March 4.''
   Eastern responded that the strike authorization vote was easily
predicted and that the carrier has been focusing all efforts on a
negotiated settlement.
   Meanwhile, Eastern attorney David Ross charged that a ``very
serious slowdown'' and a sickout by union workers have caused a
backlog of aircraft that cannot fly until they pass mandated checks.
   But Bryan called the charge ``a smokescreen.''
   ``The work is being done,'' he said.
   Members of the Machinists union, representing around 8,500
mechanics and ground workers at Eastern, have been working without a
contract for 13 months. If there is still no solution by late next
week, federal mediators plan to bring both sides together in
Washington.
   If there is still no contract by midnight EST March 3, Eastern
will be able to impose its own work rules, and the Machinists will
be able to strike legally.
   Ross charged that the Machinists have caused the 19-aircraft
backup by taking twice the normal time to perform what he called C
and D checks, anything from routine mechanical inspections to major
overhauls.
   ``Historically we have had no backup. We always have planes in
C-check or D-check status, but we don't have 19 planes waiting to be
worked on,'' he said. ``We would normally only have a certain number
in being done and then put back in service.''
   But Bryan claimed that Eastern's recent performance refutes the
carrier's allegation of widespread work slowdowns.
   ``It is mind-boggling that the main line of (Eastern) advertising
right now currently is they're the No.1 on-time operator in the
entire airline industry,'' the union leader said. ``How could that
possibly be going on if our people are slowing down? We must perform
and perform quickly and do a good job for that to happen.''
   Meanwhile, both sides pressed their arguments in federal court
Wednesday, with the union trying to keep the carrier from farming
out work traditionally done by organized labor. Eastern said it has
no other choice.
   The airline has ``begun to subcontract certain work that it has
been unable to perform as needed due to circumstances beyond its
control,'' Eastern said in an amended complaint filed late Tuesday.
   If the Machinists are allowed to continue on the same course, the
union ``will continue to cause substantial and irreparable injury to
Eastern, the traveling public and the free flow of interstate
commerce,'' the complaint alleged.
   The airline also contended that slowdowns and sickouts ``have
caused and will continue to cause substantial flight delays and
disruptions during Eastern's normally heavy winter travel season.''
   U.S. Senior District Judge C. Clyde Atkins agreed to accept the
Machinists' case on subcontracting and directed Eastern to file a
response by noon EST Thursday. He said he will then set a hearing,
probably before the week is over.
   The Machinists asked U.S. District Judge James W. Kehoe on
Tuesday to send the case to a different judge, but Kehoe granted
Eastern motion's Wednesday to send the case to Atkins, who ordered
an end to a wildcat strike by ground crews last week.
   The union also charged that Eastern has started recruiting
strikebreakers in Miami with newspaper ads offering airport
opportunities for baggage handlers, agents and managers but listing
no employer. Similar ads ran in Atlanta and in Washington, D.C.,
last week.
   Eastern, based in Miami, is a subsidiary of Houston-based Texas
Air Corp.

<HEAD>Morgan Stanley Scraps Voluntary Curb on Program Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. said Wednesday it has
abandoned a voluntary restraint on a controversial form of
computerized stock trading that was widely blamed for price
volatility during and after the October 1987 crash.
   The move by the venerable investment banking firm ended a
nine-month suspension on so-called index arbitrage program trading
by Morgan Stanley for its own account.
   Morgan was one of several brokerages that restricted use of the
technique for their own accounts in May because of a public outcry
that index arbitrage program trading was injecting wild price swings
into the stock market without regard to underlying values. The firms
continued to use it for customers.
   Bear Stearns &amp; Co., another prominent index-arbitrage program
trader that had limited use of the technique for its own account,
resumed it this past summer.
   Index arbitrage program trading refers to the use of big
computers to instantly sell massive amounts of stock in New York and
simultaneously buy the underlying stock-index futures in Chicago, or
vice versa, to profit from temporary price disparities between the
two markets.
   Some studies of the Oct. 19, 1987, the worst stock panic in
history, said index arbitrage program trading may have played a role
in aggravating the crisis and contributing to the record 508-point
drop in the Dow Jones industrial average that day.
   ``The joint industry solutions and the significant reduction in
market volatility since Oct. 19, 1987, have permitted an increase in
confidence in the U.S. equity market,'' Morgan said in a statement
about its decision to resume index arbitrage program trading.
   Morgan also said it believes ``index arbitrage plays an important
economic role in linking the futures and underlying stock markets.''
   Last February the New York Stock Exchange banned the use of its
computers for index arbitrage program trading on days when the Dow
average rose or fell 50 points from the previous day's close.
   That limitation, dubbed ``the collar,'' was scrapped last Oct.
19, on the crash anniversary, replaced by a broader set of reforms
that included temporary trading halts if the Dow average fell 250
points or more in a day.

<TEXT>
   Caterpillar Inc. unveiled a new corporate
trademark Wednesday, the second time in three years the
image-conscious company has changed its public identity.
   In 1986, Caterpillar dropped ``Tractor'' from its name and
launched an aggressive effort to diversify the products and services
it offers. Caterpillar is the world's leading manufacturer of
earth-moving equipment.
   The new trademark is actually two different logos to be used
interchangeably. One features the word ``CAT'' with a yellow
triangle underneath, the other uses the word ``Caterpillar'' in
block letters with a yellow triangle under the first three letters.
   The triangle is a graphic device designed to evoke thoughts of
stability, strength and technology, said John Hanson, the
Peoria-based company's vice president of marketing.
   ``No one is naive enough to expect these changes alone will
produce an immediate increase in sales or a renewed image,'' said
George Schaefer, chairman and chief executive officer.``But giving
the Caterpillar trademarks a new look is another important step in
company strategy. If identifies Caterpillar as a modern, progressive
company.''
   Caterpillar's current logo is an abstact black-and-white ``C''
introduced in 1968. However, it failed to increase the identify of
Caterpillar products and internal surveys showed poor recognition of
the symbol when it was not accompanied by the company name, company
executives said.
   Schaefer said the change is designed to capitalize on the
public's positive image of ``CAT'' and ``Caterpillar'' and provide
some uniformity to the growing list of Caterpillar subsidiaries and
their logos.
   Hanson said the company estimates it will cost upwards of $10
million over five years to convert all buildings, vehicles,
equipment, stationery, packaging and other items to the new logo.
   Caterpillar is coming off perhaps the best year ever in the
64-year history of the company, which employs 60,558 people
worldwide and consistently ranks among the top 50 U.S. industrial
corporations in sales.
   Caterpillar posted record sales of $10.4 billion and profits of
$616 million in 1988.
   Although earth-moving and construction equipment and engines
remain the foundation of Caterpillar's success, the company has
broadened its operations to include turbine engines, lift trucks,
high technology, parts distribution, financial services and
insurance.

   The chairman of the Coleman Co., whose
world-famous lanterns and stoves played a major role in two world
wars, said Wednesday he has received bank funding assurances for a
$332 million leveraged buyout.
   Sheldon C. Coleman said he and other family members formed
Chatham Acquisition Corp. and retained Goldman Sachs and Co. as
financial adviser for a $64-a-share buyout of the company founded by
his grandfather in 1899.
   A special committee of Coleman's board is considering the offer.
   But Coleman stock traded far above the family offer Wednsday,
closing up 87.5 cents at $71 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   More than 672,00 shares changed hands on the heels of 1.9 million
traded Tuesday, when the stock gained $21 a share. The normal
average daily trading volume for the company is 20,700 shares.
   Coleman camping products include the G.I stove, once rated with
the Jeep as the two most important pieces of equipment in World War
II, and the lantern, a staple of World War I. The company says that
by last year it had sold 40 million lanterns.
   Coleman now also makes coolers, jugs, sleeping bags, heaters, hot
tubs, fishing boats, air conditioners and air guns.
   Coleman, 36, is the grandson of founder W.C. Coleman. He was
elected chairman last fall after the death of his father. Coleman
went public in 1920. The buyout offer would take the company private
again.
   The company said in a statement that Chatham had received a
commitment letter from First National Bank of Chicago for up to $415
million to make the deal.
   The bank also has agreed that $330 million of that amount will be
available as a bridge loan, the statement said. Family members said
they would provide another $20 million bridge loan.
   The Coleman family said it owns about 27 percent of the company's
7.1 million shares outstanding. The leveraged buyout offer
apparently would account for all the shares Coleman doesn't already
own. Overall, the $64-a-share bid values the company at $454 million.
   Chatham's offer consists of $54 cash per share with preferred
stock intended to have a value of $10.
   Some analysts pointed out Wednesday there is a nearly $50 million
gap between what the stock was trading for and Chatham's offer.

   The probe is focusing on the automaker's Facilities Management
Department at company headquarters here, WXYZ-TV said.
   Chrysler confirmed Wednesday in a statement the existence of an
internal audit at the division. It said the investigation was

   Irving Brown, longtime European representative of
the AFL-CIO, has died at the age of 77, the Paris office of the U.S.
labor federation announced Wednesday.
   Brown was buried Tuesday at the Montparnasse cemetery in southern
Paris. The AFL-CIO office in Washington said he died of cancer at
his home on Friday.
   Brown, born in New York City, helped organize strikes at the
General Motors Corp. and the Ford Motor Co. between 1936 and 1942,
and was assigned to Europe in 1945.
   He was known for his support for anti-communist causes, and was
barred from France in 1956 for supporting Algerian rebels. He was
allowed to return only after the North African country won its
independence in 1962.
   Brown was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in October by
then-President Reagan for helping lead the resistance to communist
takeovers of trade unions in Western Europe after World War II.
   Brown continued working until 1986, when he suffered a stroke.
The AFL-CIO office said he was survived by his wife, Irene Brown,
and a son, Robert.
