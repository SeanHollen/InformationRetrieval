   The jury that convicted ``Night Stalker''
Richard Ramirez of 13 murders and 30 felonies spent a full day
deliberating on his punishment Thursday without reaching a decision.
   The panel must decide whether to recommend the death penalty or
life imprisonment without possibility of parole for Ramirez, 29, of
El Paso, Tex.
   The jurors, who have spent over a year on the ``Night Stalker''
case, were urged by a prosecutor to give Ramirez death as
punishment for his crimes.
   But a defense attorney asked for life, saying that even if
Ramirez was possessed by the devil, as some claim, he deserves
mercy.
   ``Richard Ramirez ... has no claim to your kindness,'' attorney
Ray Clark Clark said in his closing argument Wednesday. ``But if
you give him kindness, then that's what mercy is.''
   The prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney P. Philip Halpin, urged
that jurors recommend death in the gas chamber for Ramirez, a man
he described as ``a miserable human being'' who killed for self
gratification.
   The jury's decision is a recommendation. Superior Court Judge
Michael Tynan has the final say on sentencing. He has the option of
reducing a death penalty recommendation to life, but cannot
increase a life without parole verdict to death.
   The serial murderer still faces trial in San Francisco for a
``Night Stalker'' murder and in Santa Ana for the attempted murder
of a Mission Viejo couple.

<HEAD>Suicide Death of Witness Being Evaluated in Weapons Case</HEAD>

   An attorney who committed suicide was a
key witness in a weapons-possession case against a man under
investigation in the Green River serial killings, a prosecutor said
Wednesday.
   Police Sgt. Gene Ziegler said Dale Wells died of a
self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head sometime between Saturday
morning and Tuesday morning.
   Wells, a deputy public defender for Spokane County, was a law
school classmate of William J. Stevens II, who has been described
by the Green River Task Force as a ``viable suspect'' in the serial
killings of as many as 48 women in the Pacific Northwest from 1982
to 1984.
   Stevens has not been charged in the killings.
   Ron Skibbie, an assistant U.S. attorney, said Wells gave two
handguns to Stevens, inluding a .45-caliber Colt that is the basis
for a federal charge against Stevens accusing him of possessing a
firearm while a fugitive.
   Stevens finished serving a King County sentence for burglary and
escape on Monday before being brought to Spokane to face the
federal charge on Tuesday. He walked away from a Seattle
work-release center in 1981 and remained a fugitive until his
arrest in January.
   A plea of innocent was entered for Stevens during an initial
appearance before U.S. Magistrate James B. Hovis on Tuesday.
Stevens was ordered held without bail, but his court-appointed
attorney, Roger Peven, said he would request a bail hearing this
week.
   Peven said he hasn't had time to consider the impact Wells'
death would have on the case. He said Stevens was saddened upon
learning of the death of his former classmate at Gonzaga
Univeristy's School of Law.
   ``He and Dale Wells were good friends in law school. His feeling
was much like that of others who knew Dale; a real sense of
tragedy,'' Peven said.
   Skibbie called Wells ``a very important witness'' in the
firearms case.
   ``We're still investigating the ramifications'' of his death to
the case, Skibbie said, declining further comment.
   Skibbie said Wells was not under investigation. He had told
investigators he did not know Stevens was a fugitive when he gave
him the guns.
   Twenty-three guns were found in Steven's possession when he was
arrested.

<HEAD>It Took Hemingway 44 Tries to Bid ``A Farewell to Arms''</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ernest Hemingway imitators for years have parodied
the master in writing contests. But 60 years after the publication
of ``A Farewell to Arms,'' it's clear Hemingway was his own best
imitator.
   Hemingway went through 44 different, often sappy or verbose,
endings of his second novel before he settled on a last line.
   The discarded endings are included in an exhibit that opened
Wednesday at the John F. Kennedy Library, which has the world's
largest collection of Hemingway manuscripts. The exhibit focuses on
the book in celebration of its 60th anniversary Wednesday.
   The endings, written over six months, read like a series of
entries in the annual International Imitation Hemingway Contest.
   ``A Farewell to Arms'' is the story of a wounded soldier who
falls in love with a nurse named Catherine. (Hemingway served in
the Italian Army on the Austrian front.) In the novel, the two
become lovers but do not marry. Catherine dies in childbirth at the
end of the story.
   The last paragraph of the novel comes just after Catherine's
death in the hospital. The nurses are shut out of the room and the
soldier is left with his dead lover.
   ``But after I had gotten them out and shut the door and turned
off the light, it wasn't any good,'' the paragraph reads. ``It was
like saying goodbye to a statue. After a while I went out and left
the hospital and walked back to the hotel in the rain.''
   As bleak as that was, many of the other endings Hemingway
scrawled on different pages paint an even darker picture.
   ``That is all there is to the story,'' read one discarded
ending. ``Catherine died and you will die and I will die and that
is all I can promise you.''
   Another ending tried by Hemingway was: ``You can stop your life
the way you stop a story but you do not do it and afterwards you
are not sorry. It stops for awhile by itself and then it goes
again.''
   At times, Hemingway wallowed in bitterness:
   ``See Naples and die is a fine idea: You will live to hate its
guts if you live there. Perhaps there is no luck in a Peninsula.''
   Sometimes, he was bitter _ and sappy.
   ``That is all there is to this story. There is supposed to be
something which controls all these things and not one sparrow is
forgotten before God. It was probably.''
   Some of the endings veer toward the verbose, like this one:
   ``After people die you have to bury them but you do not have to
write about it. You do not have to write about an undertaker. Nor
the business of burial in a foreign country. Nor do you have to
write about that day and the next night nor the day after nor the
night after nor all the days after and all the nights after while
numbness turns to snow and snow blunts with use. In writing you
have a certain choice that you do not have in life.''

   The towheaded fourth-grader hugged a
stuffed animal and earnestly assured the officer he'd see to it his
friend got up in time for his appointment at the parole office.
   Then he frowned.
   ``I have to go see the police in the morning,'' he said. ``I got
in trouble at school.''
   ``Trouble'' was a loaded .25-caliber gun the 10-year-old took to
school that day. He first told police he needed the gun to fend off
pressure from drug dealers trying to sign him up. On Wednesday, the
boy told officers another story, saying he took the gun to show off
to friends.
   His ``friend,'' was a 19- or 20-year-old man, maybe his brother,
being sought on a burglary charge, said Gary Sherzan, a parole
officer.
   But in the walkup flat on Sixth Avenue, amid scattered wine
bottles and beer cans, the war on drugs was slowly surrendering
another prisoner in the nation's heartland. Crack cocaine won
another round.
   ``The cocaine gets ahold of them. We can get a percentage of
them back, but it's a powerful drug,'' said Kent Elithorpe.
   A block away on a chilly Tuesday evening, the night sky is
illuminated by the steady flashing of red and blue as police round
up that night's batch of drug dealers and users. Prostitutes stroll
by, pausing to watch people draped across police cars.
   At the Polk County Jail, an officer grimaces at the question but
says they've got 199 guests for the night. Capacity is 180.
   ``It's only eight o'clock,'' Elithorpe said.
   While cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Boston and New
Orleans wage war on drugs, Elithorpe keeps tabs on people on the
edge in a place where it isn't supposed to happen.
   But the number of arrests of adults for allegedly selling
cocaine has increased 80 percent over last decade. And in the first
nine months of this year, the number of people in treatment for
cocaine addiction increased four times over the same period last
year.
   A parole officer, Elithorpe's nights are spent poking and
probing, providing a lifeline for those already afoul of the
system. Increasingly, crack is a part of his life and the lives of
people like Frank.
   With a wife and a 5-week-old baby, Frank lives on a tree-lined
street on the city's south side, in sight of Des Moines' sparkling
skyline. He's got a record of nickel-and-dime crimes, but on this
night, he's also got an arrest warrant with his name on it.
   ``If he'd stay off the cocaine, that would probably help,'' said
Elithorpe. ``He's done more time on a dime than anybody I've ever
met. He's done eight years, and you have to work at that.''
   A ``dime'' is a 10-year term. Tuesday night, Frank had been
alerted and is nowhere to be found. His third-floor apartment is
dark.
   ``We'll be patient,'' says Elithorpe. Tomorrow, next week, next
month, Frank will turn up.
   Dressed in jeans and sweatshirts, Elithorpe and his partner for
the night, Sherzan, try to keep on an increasingly hectic schedule.
   That schedule means gangs as well as drugs.
   ``It looks like we're entering Vice Lord land. South of here is
the Crips,'' said Elithorpe. ``They stake it out and let it be
known it isn't healthy to compete.''
   They're looking for Jim, who's done time for selling drugs and
runs many of the prostitutes up and down the street. Pulling up
next to a patrol car, they hail a uniformed officer.
   ``Have you seen Jim?'' asks Elithorpe.
   ``Jim? I just sent him up,'' the officer replies.
   ``He's back.''
   ``Did I waste my time or what?'' groans the officer.
   Iowa's image is usually idyllic, like that portrayed in the
movie ``Field of Dreams.''
   With a rebounding state economy and jobs to be found, there are
few of the pressures that plague other cities. There is, however,
crack.
   ``It's a field of dreams for a few,'' said Sherzan. ``Yes, it's
getting worse. Why? It's crack cocaine. You're looking at a county
with a 3 percent unemployment rate. It's not jobs.''
   On the streets, some residents fight back. Others hunker down.
   ``People are getting sick of it,'' said Sherzan. ``On a good
summer night, you'll see 50 or 100 people up and down this street''
taking part in a neighborhood patrol.
   But a few blocks away, outside a tavern, crowds gather and crack
is traded openly. ``It's a free-fire zone,'' Elithorpe said.
   On the city's near north side sits Homes of Oakridge, a public
housing project that drug czar William Bennett will tour next
month. The brightly colored brick buildings don't have the
bombed-out look of projects in other cities. But they house many of
the same problems.
   Cesar lives there, or he did. His drug of choice is alcohol and
there's a warrant with his name also. He had the bad luck to be
home when Elithorpe knocked, and he won't be around for Bennett's
visit.
   His mother watches quietly, her head hung. The scene isn't new
in this tiny apartment.
   As the shift ends, Elithorpe brightens.
   ``Let's do this again,'' he said. ``We do this all the time.''

<HEAD>Bomb Blast Kills Two in Bogota as President Heads for Talks with
Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to CORRECT death toll to two, add details

<TEXT>
   A powerful bomb blew up in a car after
it pulled into a suburban Bogota gas station Wednesday night,
killing two people in the cr who police theorized were terrorists
and injuring two bystanders.
   The explosion of what police said was a 110-pound dynamite bomb
leveled the filling station and damaged at least 12 vehicles. It
was the 42nd bomb blast in Bogota since drug traffickers declared
war on the government last month.
   The force of the blast blew out windows in homes within 1,600
feet of the gas station in the northwestern suburb of Suba.
   The government began its crackdown on the cocaine cartels Aug.
19 after traffickers assassinated leading presidential candidate
Sen. Luis Galan, an outspoken foe of the drug lords.
   The traffickers have responded with nearly daily bombings. There
have been 113 attacks since then with dynamite or incendiary
devices, causing 10 deaths, 139 injuries and damage estimated at $5
million.
   President Virgilio Barco headed for Washington Wednesday to talk
with President Bush about Colombia's war on drugs after announcing
his government had reached a peace accord with a leading rebel
group.
   Barco swore there would be no peace for the nation's cocaine
cartels, however. He is to address the United Nations on Friday and
said he would ask more countries to help Colombia in its drug
battle.
   As Barco began his trip, Britain announced it will give
``substantial'' anti-terrorist aid, training, communications and
other help to Colombia in its drug war. British Foreign Secretary
John Major made the announcement to the U.N. General Assembly in
New York. He did not mention a dollar amount.
   Before leaving for Washington, Barco told Colombians that
democracy was at stake in the fight.
   ``This criminal organization wants to destroy the most precious
thing Colombians have _ their democracy,'' he said in a surprise
nationwide speech on radio and television late Tuesday.
   The peace treaty with the April 19 Movement, known as M-19, is a
major achievement for Barco. Congressional approval still is needed
for major aspects of the accord, however.
   He said the accord was signed Tuesday afternoon at a guerrilla
base camp in Santo Domingo, a village in the Andes mountains.
   The treaty calls for M-19's estimated 2,000 guerrillas to turn
in their weapons in exchange for pardons and the right to form a
political party.
   The treaty also calls for a national referendum on 53 proposals,
including agrarian reform to give land to peasants and programs to
provide more housing for the poor.
   Congress must approve a change in the constitution to allow such
a referendum and any pardons. Barco said he will present the
proposed treaty to the lawmakers next week.
   Tuesday's agreement is to be followed by another signing when
there is an amnesty and weapons have been surrendered.
   No deadline was set for the guerrillas to turn in their weapons,
but it appeared the date would coincide with any congressional
action on pardons.
   The peace treaty would end nearly eight years of negotiations
started by former President Belisario Betancur.
   The Barco government is trying to start peace talks with five
other guerrilla groups. Altogether, about 10,000 rebels are
fighting the government.
   Colombia's politicians and lawmakers are divided over whether
the government should pursue peace with the drug traffickers.
   Barco has steadfastly refused to consider negotiating with the
drug lords.
   ``The drug terrorists do not respect the sacred right to life.
They have threatened the press and they have trampled laws,'' he
said Tuesday night.
   Since the crackdown began, authorities have seized 1,056 pieces
of property believed to belong to the drug lords, including
mansions, ranches and businesses, and 525 vehicles, 74 boats and
375 airplanes, Barco said.
   He said 10,800 people have been arrested and 535 charged with
crimes linking them to drug traffickers.
   Barco said, however, that Colombia cannot win the war without
major help from other countries.
   Bush has approved $65 million in military equipment for
Colombia's war on drugs.
   In Washington on Wednesday, the Senate approved a $9.4 billion
plan to pay for the United State's own war on drugs through
education, prevention and treatment, law enforcement and a host of
other programs. The House must similarly approve the measure.

<HEAD>Disabled Protesters Arrested After Blocking Bus Station</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBRA ELLIOTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested 25 disabled protesters outside a
bus station late Wednesday after about 200 demonstrators blocked
entrances, forcing buses to unload passengers on a busy downtown
streets.
   Police loaded the protesters in wheelchairs into buses equipped
with wheelchair lifts _ devices the demonstrators were demanding be
provided on Greyhound-Trailways buses. Those arrested were charged
with disorderly conduct or criminal trespassing and released.
   Wednesday's demonstration marked the third day of protests in
Atlanta by American Disabled for Accessible Public Transportation.
Members of the group occupied a federal building Monday and Tuesday
in an unsuccessful bid to force the federal government to order
wheelchair lifts installed on public buses.
   That protest ended Tuesday when Bush administration officials
promised to urge Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner to meet
with the protesters.
   On Wednesday, police began arresting demonstrators after more
than 18 buses were forced to park on side streets to unload
passengers because protesters were blocking the bus terminal.
   First taken into custody were protesters sitting on buses,
parked in front of them or sitting inside luggage compartments.
   Barricades were placed on either side of the station to block
off passers-by as protesters locked their wheelchairs together and
chanted, ``Access is a civil right.''
   Protest leader Michael Auberger said the group was demonstrating
against a Greyhound-Trailways policy requiring passengers in
wheelchairs to bring someone with them to carry them on and off
Greyhound buses.
   Tom Street, regional manager of Greyhound-Trailways, had asked
police to arrest the protesters _ one of whom chained himself by
the neck to the steering wheel of the Nashville, Tenn.,-bound bus.
   ``This is to symbolize how the private industry tries to
discriminate against us,'' said Clayton Jones, 41, of Houston.
``They feel if they give you a place to live you should live inside
the four walls and not have any other life.''
   Auberger said the group targeted the bus line for Wednesday's
demonstration because Greyhound-Trailways has refused to add
wheelchair lifts to its buses because of the costs.
   ``We're making improvements to handle the handicapped. We can't
handle it in tis manner,'' said Street, refusing further comment.
   Greyhound's ``helping hands'' policy requires a passenger in a
wheelchair to be carried on and off the buses but allows a
companion to travel with the disabled passenger free of charge. The
policy also prohibits battery-powered wheelchairs inside the bus.

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS grafs 10-12: ``The votes,'' on catastrophic care situation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House, edging toward a decision on cutting
capital-gains taxes, on Wednesday stripped from a big
deficit-reduction bill a provision requiring that workers share in
the power over company-financed pension plans.
   The provision, said Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., ``would
jeopardize the pension levels of millions of employees and
retirees'' and encourage companies to drop pension protection for
workers.
   ``This is where America should be going in cooperation between
employers and employees,'' said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif. ``This
is about fairness; it's about equity and control of your own
destiny as an American worker.
   The provision, which would have required that half the trustees
controlling single-employer pension plans be workers, was removed
from the budget bill on a 250-173 vote. Republicans voted almost
solidly against it.
   By a 390-36 margin, the House voved to repeal a 1986 provision,
fought vigorously by business, that prohibits employers from
claiming tax deductions for health plans that discriminate against
lower-paid workers.
   Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., chief sponsor of repealing the
provision, known as Section 89, said the tests required to prove
non-discrimination are an expensive maze of complexity _ a good
idea that simply cannot be put into practice.
   ``The only question America has is `why did it take so long'''
to repeal? said Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass. ``Where is the
documentation that a problem existed (requiring the rules)? There
is none.''
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, proposed wiping out most of the non-discrimination
complexity but still requiring employers to prove that
tax-subsidized health plans are not provided solely for executives.
   ``Full repeal will do nothing but result in discrimination, pure
and simple,'' Rostenkowski said.
   Meanwhile, a vote was scheduled for next week on a new proposal
from two key subcommittee chairmen to repeal much of the
catastrophic care provisions added to Medicare last year _ and to
repeal the unpopular income surtax for the elderly that finances
the program.
   Reps. Fortney H. Stark, D-Calif., chairman of the Ways and Means
subcommittee dealing with health care, and Henry Waxman, D-Calif.,
chairman of a health subcommittee of the energy and commerce
committee, would leave intact provisions paying for prescription
drugs.
   Next week's vote would be on whether to advance the Stark-Waxman
proposals instead of the section of the overall bill reported by
the Ways and Means Committee that would cut the surtax in half.
   Wednesday's votes came as President Bush continued seeking
support for his proposal to cut taxes on capital gains and
Democratic leaders sought to defeat it with a substitute plan to
liberalize tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts.
   Members on both sides of the capital-gains question guessed that
backers of the reduction held a slight advantage on the eve of
Thursday's scheduled vote.
   Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., who has led opposition to the
reduction, refused to concede. ``Nobody has the votes,'' he said.
``It will be close. ... We will keep working and we are very
encouraged by the response.''
   At the White House, Bush restated his support for the cut and
accused Democrats of distorting the issue by calling it a tax
reduction for the rich. ``They are wrong,'' he told reporters.
   Bush emphasized that the Democratic alternative for expanded
IRAs would be financed by a tax increase, which would affect the
nation's 600,000 wealthiest people. A vote for IRAs, he said, will
be a vote for higher taxes.
   In the Senate, Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, introduced with support of 34 other Democrats his plan for
expanding IRAs _ but without the tax increase.
   The capital-gains cut is part of a 2,000-page bill designed
principally to reduce the deficit by $16.6 billion in the budget
year that begins Oct. 1.
   The defeated plan to give employees a vote in how their pension
funds are invested was one of scores of provisions in the bill that
are unrelated to deficit reduction.
   Another labor-backed provision remains in the bill. It would
prohibit employers from recovering pension assets when a plan is
terminated. The Labor Committee said that would discourage
employers from killing a plan in order to use the money for other
purposes.
   Rep. Peter Visclosky, D-Ind., wrote the provision giving workers
equal representation on boards of trustees that administer
employer-financed pension plans. It would have applied to an
estimated 1.5 million single-employer plans, including those known
as Section 401(k) plans. Plans covering more than one company have
had worker trustees for 40 years.
   Viscosky said he was motivated by a government report estimating
that 40 percent of corporate takeovers result in the termination of
one or more worker pension funds.
   ``It is unworkable, untenable and unbelievable,'' Mrs. Roukema
contended. She noted the Labor Department opposes the provision and
said there is no need for such a change because federal law already
requires that pension trustees act solely in the interest of
beneficiaries.

<HEAD>A Dirty Word Becomes Respectable, Though Finns Still Cautious</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Finlandization'' used to be a dirty
word in Finland. Attitudes are changing, but Finns still squirm
over their history of deference to the Soviet Union.
   The term used to describe a nation's subservience to a greater
power. But as the Soviets open to the West, Eastern Europeans now
look to Finland as a model for free cooperation with the superpower.
   ``Finlandization'' is losing its slavish connotations.
   A reminder of how deeply the Soviets were involved in Finnish
affairs is being published in the memoirs of Ahti Karjalainen, a
former prime minister, alleging Soviet interference in the 1982
presidential election.
   The book, ``The Minister of the President,'' hit the stands this
month, setting off an unusual furor in this nation of consensus
politics.
   Karjalainen disclosed the existence of a letter from
then-Foreign Minister Paavo Vayrynen, his colleague in the Center
Party, about a 1981 meeting with Soviet Embassy official Viktor
Vladimirov to discuss Moscow's help for Karjalainen's presidential
bid.
   Vladimirov reportedly told Vayrynen that the Kremlin could
influence Finnish Communists and other pro-Soviet factions to
support Karjalainen against the Social Democratic candidate, Mauno
Koivisto. Moscow also could manipulate its trade with Finland to
make Karjalainen, a senior trade official, look good.
   Vayrynen, now the opposition leader, claimed the letter was
misinterpreted and threatened legal action. But he admitted that
such talks with the Soviets were routine.
   ``Those discussions were similar to the discussions that most
Finnish politicians at that time had with Soviet representatives,''
he said on Finnish television. ``Fortunately, habits have changed
from eight years ago.''
   The actual extent of Soviet involvement was not disclosed, and
Koivisto won the election. It was not clear why Karjalainen, who is
now retired, published a story so damaging to his own party.
   The episode recalled days when no major policy was adopted
without consulting the Soviets, or at least considering how they
would respond.
   In domestic affairs, Finnish politicians often would play ``the
Moscow card,'' getting a Soviet nod for a particular position to
gain leverage over their opponents.
   ``Ten years ago, almost every member of the Finnish Parliament
had what we jokingly call a `home Russian' in the Soviet Embassy,''
said Jorn Donner, an author, filmmaker and right-wing member of
Parliament.
   ``The Russians have been used in one way or another by different
parties. It's not visible any more as it was then.''
   Erkki Kauppila, who retired last year as editor of the Communist
Party newspaper Kansan Uutiset, said: ``The Soviets used to say
openly what they would accept or not accept. Later they discovered
that was not the best policy. After that, things were done in
political corridors.''
   Finland shares a 793-mile border with the Soviet Union. During
World War II, a subdued Finland ceded the Karelia isthmus and
relocated 400,000 Finns. Under Soviet duress, the two countries
signed a friendship and cooperation treaty in 1948 that is still
valid.
   Urho Kekkonen, Finland's dominant post-war president who retired
in 1981, fashioned a neutral foreign policy designed to reassure
the Soviets that Finland would never become a military threat, thus
buying continued Finnish sovereignty.
   The term ``Finlandization'' first appeared in the 1960s in West
Germany to refer to a country intimidated by the Soviet Union to
adopt acquiescent policies.
   Eastern Europeans today use the term to mean a promise of
political sovereignty and economic freedom, alongside respectful
neighborliness with the Soviet Union.
   ``Finlandization isn't a problem any more. Not like it used to
be,'' Donner said, adding, however, that Finnish politicians remain
``very cautious.''
   Prime Minister Harri Holkeri, on a visit to Washington in May
1988, lost his temper when asked by reporters about the aspirations
in Eastern Europe for Finlandization.
   ``I hate that word Finlandization. From the depths of my heart I
would like that word to be abolished,'' he said.
   But a senior Foreign Ministry official said recently, ``The word
doesn't bother us any more, though the comparisons with Eastern
Europe or the Baltic states miss the point.''
   Unlike Eastern Europe, he said, Finland is a capitalist nation
free of military alliances.
   ``Finland is not a model for anyone else,'' said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Finland continues to be neutral, but wealth drawn from a
fast-growing industrial economy and new attitudes in Moscow under
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev have given the Finns self-confidence
they never had before.
   One indication came two years ago with the formation of a
government led by Holkeri's Conservative Party, which had been kept
out of any meaningful Cabinet position since the war because of of
their anti-Soviet image.
   ``A new generation has taken over in Finland ... and the
atmosphere among the Russians also has relaxed,'' Donner said.
``There are still some traces of influence, like a shadow.''

<HEAD>Soviet President To Visit Japan in 1991</HEAD>

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev will visit Japan in 1991,
becoming the first Soviet leader ever to visit this country, a
Foreign Ministry official said today.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze informed his Japanese
counterpart Taro Nakayama of Gorbachev's intention in a meeting at
the Soviet mission to the United Nations in New York on Wednesday.
   Shevardnadze also told Nakayama that he hopes to visit Tokyo in
mid-March and invited Nakayama to visit Moscow afterwards, the
official said.
   To date, four Japanese prime ministers have visited Moscow, but
no Soviet leaders has ever visited Tokyo.
   Japan has repeatedly requested the Soviet Union to send its top
leader to Japan to improve relations.
   The Tokyo government hopes a visit by a Soviet leader would help
resolve the territorial dispute over the ``Northern Territories,''
a group of small islands off northern Japan claimed by Japan but
occupied by the Soviet Union.
   The two countries began long-stalled talks on a peace treaty
earlier this year, but the territorial issue remains the largest
stumbling block.

   President George Bush has
telephoned ex-president Jose Napoleon Duarte to inquire about the
health of the former leader, who is dying of liver cancer, Duarte's
son said.
   ``They talked for about 10 minutes, as old friends,'' Alejandro
Duarte said by telephone of Wednesday's conversation. ``President
Bush asked him about his health, how he was feeling.''
   Alejandro said his father, who nearly died last week from
pneumonia, was out of bed, lucid and feeling well during the
morning, when Bush called.
   ``But this afternoon he has been in acute pain, in the area of
his liver, from the cancer,'' he said.
   Doctors sedated the former president, who was in bed late
Wednesday receiving both oxygen and intravenous feeding, said
Alejandro.
   ``He is still not completely recovered from the pneumonia,'' he
said.
   Duarte's doctors have said that, as soon as the former president
is well enough to travel, he will fly to Washington for analysis
and treatment at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where his cancer
was diagnosed in June 1988.
   Alejandro said Bush expressed the desire to visit with Duarte
when the ailing leader travels to Washington.

<HEAD>Cease-Fire Does Not Persuade Many Lebanese to Return Home</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cease-fire in Lebanon has sent
thousands of refugees streaming back home, but Tony Raphael and
many others are turning their backs on their ravaged homeland and
planning new lives elsewhere.
   ``I don't believe in it,'' the 26-year old Maronite Catholic
said as he waited for a Canadian visa in Cyprus. ``It's always like
this, one cease-fire after another. It's been going on for 14
years. I don't want another 14 years.''
   Tens of thousands of Lebanese, most of them Christians, have
made the hazardous 100-mile trip to Cyprus since fighting broke out
in March between Syrian and Christian forces in Lebanon. Some came
seeking visas to other countries, others to sit out the fighting.
   About 1 million refugees have returned to Beirut since a
cease-fire Sept. 22. Raphael's parents are among those who plan to
go back home.
   ``I told them, `You want to go back? You're crazy!''' said
Raphael, who lived in Beirut. ``I swore last time I got off the
boat, I'm not going back.''
   Cyprus government spokesman Akis Fantis said Wednesday there
were 11,000 Lebanese in Cyprus, which often has been a sanctuary
during periods of intense fighting in Lebanon.
   But relief officials said the number just before the cease-fire
was at least 30,000.
   In the latest exodus, most of the Christian refugees made the
risky three-hour journey on a 330-seat hydrofoil, the Santa Maria,
from Jounieh north of Beirut to Larnaca on the southern Cyprus
coast.
   For much of the last six months, the hydrofoil, often shelled by
the Syrians, was the Christians' only link to the outside world
from their enclave north of Beirut.
   Ghada Nasser, 26, was one who fled on the Santa Maria. The last
straw for her was the fear that an artillery barrage would mar her
wedding reception, as happened during a friend's wedding.
   ``Shells started falling when they were having the reception.
Boom! Boom!'' she said. ``That was it, and the bride was crying.''
   Mrs. Nasser came to Cyprus, was married in Nicosia in a civil
ceremony and prepared to start a new life with her Jordanian
husband in Kuwait.
   Bassel Abou Jaoudeh, 19, ran an electronics repair shop part
time while studying at a college in Christian east Beirut. The
Syrian barrages ended that.
   ``My house was destroyed. My shop was destroyed. The college
closed and there was no way to continue my studies,'' said Jaoudeh,
a Maronite who has just received a Canadian visa after a four-month
wait.
   On the eve of his departure for Canada and a new life, he spoke
in the dining room of a 15th-century monastery nestled in the heart
of the bustling southeastern tourist resort of Ayia Napa.
   The monastery, run by the Middle East Council of Churches as a
conference center, has become a haven for Lebanese who arrive in
Cyprus penniless or have difficulty finding shelter.
   The Rev. Riad Jarjour, who runs the center, helps dozens of
Lebanese who turn up on his doorstep seeking assistance with money,
lodging or food.
   The exodus from Lebanon to Cyprus over the last six months was
``unlike any time before,'' said Jarjour. Hotels and furnished
apartments were crammed with refugees.
   Jarjour stressed that his center does not encourage people to
emigrate. ``We want them to stay, to live in unity in their own
country.''
   But many Lebanese are not convinced.
   Every weekday, dozens line up at the U.S. Embassy in Nicosia,
staying up all night for visa interviews the next morning.
   An embassy spokesman said consular officers interview 30 to 40
applicants a day. Only a few dozen are allowed to wait in line.
Security guards turn away as many as 100 others, asking them to
come back the next day.
   Canada had to open an immigration office in Nicosia to cope with
the flood of applicants. The emigration process for the United
States, Canada and other countries takes months. But for the
war-weary Lebanese, it's worth the wait.
   ``Anything's better than sitting in Lebanon, even if it's just
sitting here and not doing anything. Here there are no shells
falling on you,'' said 24-year-old Zena Touma.

   Artillery fire at a practice range
overshot its target Wednesday and struck a group of about 80
soldiers standing in formation, killing three and injuring 23
others, officials said.
   One or more rounds exploded outside the Fort Sill firing area
about 5 p.m. and struck a nearby rifle range where the soldiers
were training, said Master Sgt. Michael Brown, a base spokesman.
   The unit had completed a tactical training course and was in
formation and preparing to trade places with another unit when a
shell hit 10 to 15 feet behind them, creating a crater a yard wide
and a foot deep, said Col. John Dobbs, another base spokesman.
   Fort Sill officials were trying late Wednesday to determine how
many shells hit the soldiers, what type howitzer was being fired
and why the artillery missed its mark.
   ``The error could have been made in more than one way,'' said
Dobbs. The howitzer may have been aimed incorrectly or had the
wrong amount of gunpowder, he said.
   ``We have to analyze the craters and interview all the units on
the range,'' said Jon Long, a base spokesman.
   Long said it appeared the impact occurred from 700 to 1,000
meters beyond the target area. He said the base, which has 21,000
soldiers and is the Army's Field Artillery Center, has three sizes
of howitzers.
   The soldiers were assigned to A Battery, 2nd Battalion of the
80th Field Artillery and were a week away from completing an
eight-week basic training course, said Staff Sgt. William Biel, a
base spokesman. ``They were out there qualifying with their
weapons,'' he said.
   Military police roped off an area approximately 70 feet by 70
feet at the accident site and would not let reporters speak with
any troops. Remnants of military uniforms and helmets littered the
ground. Buses were used to carry uninjured soldiers back to the
post.
   Three of the most seriously injured underwent surgery Wednesday
night, Long said.
   Biel said Staff Sgt. Scott Harris was in critical condition at
the base hospital. Pvts. David Saltsman and David Adams were in
stable condition. He did not have their hometowns.
   Long said the accident site was about four miles from the
populated area of the base.
   Helicopters and ambulances were used to evacuate the injured to
Reynolds Army Hospital on the base, located in south central
Oklahoma, officials said.
   Brown said the identities of the dead soldiers were not released
pending notification of relatives.
   Other details were not immediately available.
   The last major accident involving artillery at the post occurred
in December 1978, when a shell exploded aboard an
ammunition-carrying vehicle, killing one soldier and injuring four
others.

   Thousands of Hurricane Hugo's victims
lined up Wednesday for food, clothes and building supplies while
officials pleaded with the Bush administration to cut federal red
tape and get aid to stricken areas.
   ``We're very appreciative for all the help. But if it could have
been done quicker and had been done quicker it would have been
better,'' Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said. ``I'm not sure the extent
of the damage from Hugo is understood yet at the federal level.''
   Riley, who earlier this week was full of praise for federal
relief efforts, told reporters he has had to seek help from Sen.
Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., to get more military generators to provide
electricity.
   An estimated 233,000 utility customers in South Carolina remain
without power, more than half in the Charleston area.
   There were reports, meanwhile, that President Bush may fly to
South Carolina on Friday to inspection caused by the hurricane.
   A White House survey team was en route to Charleston late
Wednesday to review sites where Bush might visit. A Bush
administration official, who declined to be identified, said it was
not certain that Bush would make the trip.
   From Washington, Hollings called officials with the Federal
Emergency Management Agency ``a bunch of bureaucratic jackasses.''
   `If you can get around them, you can get relief,'' he said.
   Hollings said he would seek $400 million for victims in South
Carolina, North Carolina, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Sen.
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said he has asked for $1.1 billion and has
the support of Hollings and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell announced Wednesday the U.S. Department of
Labor has given the state $5 million to hire jobless workers to
help in the cleanup. An estimated 270,600 people lost their jobs,
at least temporarily, because of the storm.
   Late Wednesday, Campbell announced five additional counties have
been added to the list approved for federal disaster aid. Seventeen
of the state's 46 counties have now been approved for federal aid.
   If the progress of federal aid disappointed some, the outpouring
of compassion from around the country did not.
   Twelve food and clothing distribution centers opened Wednesday
around this 300-year-old city, and coordinators expected to give
away 20 to 30 tractor-trailer trucks filled with necessities every
day for days to come.
   ``This will keep us alive,'' said Senella Ladson, who walked
away with a box of free food from the suburban Citadel Mall parking
lot.
   ``I'm looking for anything I can get _ food, clothes,
everything,'' said Necole Jerremah, who stood next to a baby
carriage filled with clothes, bread, pork and beans, soup and baby
food. ``We lost pretty much everything.''
   Goods rolled in from all over the country nearly a week after
the worst hurricane to hit South Carolina in three decades rampaged
through the state. Twenty-nine people died in the United States, 18
of them in South Carolina, when Hugo made its way north and west
before dissipating.
   A national phone bank has brought in 10,000 pledges of donations
from individuals, communities and corporations. The rural community
of Awendaw, northwest of Charleston, was sent 1,000 fish dinners by
the citizens of coastal Beaufort.
   The Red Cross had an additional 32 relief centers operating in
three counties hard hit by the storm with more were scheduled to
open, spokeswoman Liz Leopard said.
   At the Citadel Mall, where National Guard troops and sailors
helped in the handout lines, there were boxes of used shoes,
blouses, slacks and other items for people who fled the storm with
nothing but the clothes they were wearing.
   Ralston Purina Co. sent four tons of pet food to replenish the
Charleston Humane Society's food supply, which was destroyed in the
storm.
   Riley said about 50,000 Charleston residents remain displaced by
the storm. The mayor said there were 55 collapsed buildings in the
city and 310 with moderate to severe damage.
   ``We must gird ourselves up and take the challenges before us as
opportunities _ from the dirty job of cleaning our houses and
getting our economy back to order, and dealing with all aspects of
it,'' he said.
   The city still bears its scars, with smashed tree trunks and
wrecked houses a part of the landscape. A boat from a marina sat in
a yard, blown there by Hugo's might.
   A nighttime curfew remained in effect, and National Guard troops
continued to patrol the streets.
   But power was slowly being restored to the Historic District,
and traffic lights were again working in the heart of downtown
Charleston.
   Some were making the best of the storm's destruction. Chain saws
were being sold from the backs of rental trucks. And T-shirts
appeared, proclaiming, ``Hugo 1, Charleston 0.''
   ``Everybody's buying them. People were knocking on my door,''
said Deren Sawyer, 22, of the Shirt Shack, which had 1,000 shirts
to sell for $8 apiece.
   Residents of the Isle of Palms, a barrier island northeast of
Charleston that bore the brunt of the storm, were able to travel at
will to the island for the first time Wednesday to begin cleaning
up.
   Nearby Sullivan's Island still was closed to residents while
Army personnel moved in heavy equipment by boat and air to assist
in cleanup efforts. Island residents were expected to be able to
return to the island Thursday.
   For many residents, there was no end in sight to the struggle
for survival.
   ``I'm just trying to get my life back together,'' said Karen
White, 25, as she waited for milk and canned fruit for her
2-year-old son. ``I don't think it'll ever be the same.''

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor urged a jury Wednesday to
recommend death in the gas chamber for convicted ``Night Stalker''
Richard Ramirez, saying he killed for simple gratification.
   Deputy District Attorney P. Philip Halpin, delivering his final
argument after the defense decided not to present witnesses,
described in detail the gruesome murders committed by Ramirez in
1985.
   The same jury decided Sept. 20 that the 29-year-old drifter was
the devil- worshiping Night Stalker who committed 13 gruesome
murders and 30 felonies, including numerous sex crimes in which he
forced his victims to ``swear to Satan.''
   The jurors were to begin their deliberations on the penalty
Thursday morning.
   ``It is very difficult for us, as human beings, to face this
type of evil, without trying to deny it, without trying to
rationalize it, without trying to explain it away,'' Halpin said.
   ``If anyone has ever earned the death penalty, Richard Ramirez
has,'' he said.
   Halpin acknowledged that the motive for Ramirez's killing spree
has never been explained and he can only surmise the shootings,
throat slashings, eye gougings and other atrocities were ``for the
simple gratification of this miserable human being.''
   Ramirez showed no reaction to the prosecutor's remarks and
continued chatting with his defense team as Halpin spoke.
   Defense lawyer Ray Clark, the last to address the jury, stressed
that life in prison without possibility of parole _ the only
alternative to a death sentence under California law _ is ``hell''
and sufficient punishment for Ramirez.
   ``Mr. Ramirez will die in prison. There's no question about
it,'' said Clark. ``The only question you're going to answer is
whether he dies according to ... the schedule of the state of
California or according to God's schedule.''
   Referring to evidence that Ramirez was a devil worshiper, Clark
suggested that even the devil deserves mercy.
   ``I think it's inescapable that something was wrong (with
Ramirez) and we don't know what it was,'' said Clark. ``Let's say
we believe he was possessed if there is such a thing. Then the
extension of mercy goes to the devil because he is considerably
more in need of mercy than anybody else.''
   Ramirez' decision not to present witnesses during the
life-or-death penalty phase of his trial startled Superior Court
Judge Michael Tynan, who quizzed him on it.
   ``Mr. Ramirez, is it true you do not wish to take the stand?''
the judge asked.
   ``Yes,'' the shaggy-haired Ramirez replied in a husky voice.
   ``And you agree with the tactical decision that you not put on
evidence at this stage of the proceedings?'' Tynan asked.
   ``Yes,'' Ramirez said.
   Lawyer Daniel Hernandez said he had 100 witnesses lined up to
testify about Ramirez' ``value as a human being'' and his early
life in El Paso, Texas, but decided at the last minute to abide by
his client's wishes.
   ``We felt and he felt he didn't particularly want to lay his
life out for the public and the court to scrutinize,'' said
Hernandez. ``I wanted to give him the last grain of dignity _ human
dignity _ and spare him that.''
   Asked whether he could explain what drove Ramirez to commit the
grisly string of crimes, Hernandez said, ``That's confidential. I
can't discuss it.''

   The threat of toxic fumes from a fire raging
out of control at a chemical plant Wednesday night forced the
evacuation of more than 600 homes and shut down Amtrak's Northeast
Corridor.
   A fire dispatcher said the first alarm in North Philadelphia was
reported at 8:23 p.m. By midnight, the fire was under control. No
injuries were reported.
   ``We're very worried about it because of the volatility of the
chemicals,'' Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer said.
   He said the chemicals included benzene, styrene, hydrochloric
acid, benzyl-peroxide, sulfuric acid, caustic soda, bromine,
propylene dichloride and di-vinyl benzine.
   ``They are very flammable, explosive and also several of those
are very toxic,'' the commissioner said.
   Witnesses said the 500-foot building was almost completely
engulfed in flames minutes after the fire broke out, and it
appeared to be destroyed as the fire raged. Some of the 200
firefighters on the scene said they were worried about the walls
collapsing.
   The evacuees were taken to three nearby churches.
   ``We're fortunate that most of the products of combustion went
straight up into the air. However, every once in a while there's a
wind change and they blow to the south. That's the reason for the
evacuation,'' Ulshafer said.
   Four Amtrak tracks on the Northeast Corridor near the factory
were shut down from 8:45 p.m. until 10:05 p.m., when two tracks
were re-opened, according to railroad spokesman John Jacobsen.
   ``We had six northbound trains and three southbound trains
holding in different parts of Philadelphia,'' Jacobsen said soon
after partial service was restored. ``Two tracks is all we need,
and we should be back to normal.''
   Local trains that also use the Amtrak line were stopped. The
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority arranged for
shuttle bus service for two inbound trains and delayed several
outbound ones.
   The burning building was owned by the Purolite Chemical Co., a
water-purification business, but employees said the second floor
was rented to Sterling Hobbies, a company that makes balsa model
airplanes.
   The Purolite employees said they smelled an odor like gasoline
and looked up to see flames.

<HEAD>Comic Pulls Out of Giuliani Campaign After Dinkins Remark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comic Jackie Mason will no longer campaign for
Republican mayoral candidate Rudolph Giuliani after commenting that
Democratic candidate David Dinkins looks like ``a black model
without a job.''
   ``Mason is withdrawing from the campaign because he didn't want
this matter to deflect from the importance of the campaign,'' said
Charles Perkins, a Giuliani spokesman.
   Mason told reporters he meant nothing by the remark, published
Wednesday in The Village Voice.
   ``I care more for the black people than any other person in the
country,'' Mason said. ``I hate bigots.''
   Dinkins said he was ``not particularly'' offended by the remark.
``I can say that that kind of comment is not helpful to our city,''
he said.
   Giuliani was ``troubled'' by Mason's comment, Perkins said.
   The Voice, a weekly newspaper in New York, also quoted Mason as
saying: ``There is a sick Jewish problem of voting for a black man
no matter how unfit he is for the job. ... Jews are sick with
complexes.''
   Mason later called that comment ``stupid,'' but not before Mayor
Edward I. Koch and several Jewish groups denounced the remark as
offensive. Dinkins defeated Koch in the Democratic primary.
   Mason's attorney, Raoul Felder, said the comic's remarks were
taken out of context by the Voice and the interview was off the
record. Mason said he would file a $25 million libel lawsuit
against the Voice on Thursday ``for a vicious attack on the
goodness of my name.''
   Jonathan Larsen, editor-in-chief of the Voice, said the paper
would ``reserve comment until we actually see the suit. But we
stand behind the story.'' He denied Mason's comments were taken out
of context and made off the record.

<HEAD>Abortion Pill Developer Gets Top American Medical Award</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The inventor of an abortion pill widely used in
France but not allowed in this country has won America's most
prestigious medical research award, outraging anti-abortion
activists.
   Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu of France provoked an international
ethical debate with his discovery of RU 486, which prevents a
fertilized egg from developing into a pregnancy.
   In addition to Baulieu, five other scientists won Albert Lasker
Medical Research Awards on Wednesday.
   The awards are a kind of American Nobel Prize for medical
research. Dr. James O. Mason, assistant secretary of the Health and
Human Services Department, described them as ``the most prestigious
and coveted in American science.''
   They often foreshadow the choices of the Nobel judges. Forty-six
Lasker winners went on to win Nobel Prizes, often within a few
years of receiving the U.S. award.
   The other winners Wednesday were Lewis Thomas, the writer and
doctor, and four scientists who study the chemicals that allow
cells to respond to hormones, growth factors and neurotransmitters.
   The four are: Michael J. Berridge of the University of
Cambridge, England; Alfred G. Gilman of the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas; Edwin G. Krebs of the Howard
Hughes Medical Institute and the University of Washington School of
Medicine in Seattle; and Yasutomi Nishizuka of the Kobe University
School of Medicine in Japan.
   Thomas, scholar-in-residence at Cornell University Medical
College in New York and president emeritus of Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, received the Albert
Lasker Public Service Award for his writings on medicine.
   Thomas' writings ``have heightened and transformed the public's
perception of biomedical science,'' the committee said.
   Anti-abortion activists condemned the award to Baulieu, while
women's rights advocates praised the action.
   ``His achievement is to kill people,'' said Dr. John Willke,
president of the National Right to Life Committee in Washington.
``It's outrageous that they would give this to a man whose
achievement is to develop chemical warfare against the unborn.''
   Patricia Ireland, executive vice president of the National
Organization for Women, said: ``It's an encouraging sign that the
know-nothings are not going to stop the medical research community
from honoring Baulieu's contribution.''
   Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, chairman of the awards jury, said the
controversy surrounding RU 486 did not influence the jury.
   ``They look at the scientific content of the work, and that's
all,'' he said. ``Society makes the decision about what it does
with the knowledge.''
   In his acceptance speech, Baulieu said that 200,000 women around
the world die each year of poorly done abortions, ``and there are
many hundreds of thousands of women wounded physically and
psychologically.''
   The discovery of RU 486 gives women a choice, he said. ``Choice
is freedom. Science cannot and must not dictate our beliefs. But
science can provide choices,'' he said.
   The drug, reportedly being used for about 15 percent of elective
abortions in France, has not been approved in the United States,
but it has provoked a storm of controversy here nonetheless.
   Opponents have threatened boycotts of any company that should
choose to sell it in the United States, and abortion-rights
advocates have promised to lobby for the pill's sale in the United
States.
   The drug's manufacturer, Roussel Uclaf of France, withdrew it
from the French market on Oct. 26, 1988, because of an ``outcry of
public opinion at home and abroad'' and a threatened boycott of its
products. Sales were resumed two days later at the insistence of
the French government.
   The drug blocks pregnancy after conception by interfering with
the hormone progesterone, which is essential to the maintenance of
pregnancy. When progesterone's action is blocked, the uterus sheds
its lining. Any egg that might have been fertilized and implanted
in the lining is shed along with it.

<HEAD>Former Premier Papandreou Indicted For Alleged Role In Bank Scandal</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By PHILIP DOPOULOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament early today indicted former
Premier Andreas Papandreou on bribery charges in a $210 million
bank embezzlement scandal that helped topple his nearly decade-old
socialist administration.
   The 300-member unicameral legislature voted 166 to 121 that
Papandreou and four of his senior Cabinet ministers should stand
trial before a special court in connection with the Bank of Crete
scandal.
   It was the first time in Greece's history that a civilian
political leader was ordered to stand trial for alleged wrongdoing
in office.
   The governing coalition of conservatives and Communists, formed
after June elections that removed Papandreou from power, controls
173 seats in Parliament so Papandreou's indictment had seemed a
certainty when debate began.
   In a rare appearance before a packed chamber before the vote,
Papandreou said he is innocent of the criminal charges _ bribery,
accepting stolen money and breach of faith.
   He said he accepts political responsibility for the scandal that
broke in October, but called the indictment politically motivated.
   ``I have not come to respond to the transparent charges nor to
my slanderers but to restore the truth,'' he declared.
   Papandreou, 70, whose Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK)
rose to power in 1981 on a platform of pulling Greece out of NATO
and closing U.S. military bases, remains a popular hero to many
Greeks.
   In fact, Papandreou still heads his party and is expected to run
for office in elections to be held by Nov. 5.
   The governing coalition that took power after the June elections
left a hung Parliament and promised to prosecute politicians
involved in scandals before holding new elections.
   Today's vote, by secret ballot, ended a two-day debate on
evidence presented by a parliamentary commission that recommended
prosecution.
   The indicted former ministers are Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas, who
was deputy premier and justice minister; Giorgos Petsos of
Transport and Communications; Dimitris Tsovolas of Finance, and
Panayiotis Roumeliotis of the Ministry of National Economy.
   Papandreou and the four allegedly skimmed interest from money
deposited by state-controlled organizations in the Bank of Crete
and accepted payoffs from the bank's chairman, George Koskotas.
   Koskotas is currently jailed in Salem, Mass., fighting an
extradition request from Greece. He has implicated the former
premier in the scandal.
   Speaking to parliament, Papandreou said the accusations he
accepted bribes from Koskotas and that he authorized the
embezzlement scheme were based solely on Koskotas' testimony.
   Papandreou accused ``local and foreign interests'' of being
behind what he called his defamation, a charge that he has made
repeatedly since October.
   It was the second indictment of Papandreou, who last week was
ordered to stand trial for allegedly instigating widespread illegal
wiretapping of friends and political opponents while in office.
   The special court is not expected to hear the two cases until
mid-November, meaning Papandreou may run for office while under
indictment.
   Four of the accused appeared in Parliament to defend themselves
during the debate while Roumeliotis, a deputy of the European
parliament, sent a memorandum.
   All face a minimum of five years imprisonment if convicted of
the charges.
   The debate began early Tuesday, just hours after terrorist
gunmen killed lawmaker Pavlos Bakoyannis, a member of the
conservative New Democracy party led by his father-in-law,
Constantine Mitsotakis.
   Bakoyannis' alleged killers, the leftist November 17
organization, accused him in a statement of involvement in the same
scandal under which Papandreou stands accused.
   Tsovolas told Parliament Tuesday that charges against him were
concocted because he refused to bow to pressure exerted by foreign
and Greek special interest groups.
   Koutsogiorgas told lawmakers that he committed no wrongdoing and
denied taking a $2 million bribe from Koskotas that allegedly was
deposited in a Swiss bank account.
   Koskotas fled to the United States in November after a central
bank audit at the Bank of Crete uncovered the embezzlement scheme.
   The 35-year-old fugitive, in interviews from his prison cell
claimed Papandreou blackmailed him into embezzling funds for the
benefit of his party.
   According to a constitutional amendment passed by the 1967-74
military dictatorship, government officials can only be tried by a
13-member special tribunal made up of Supreme Court judges and
Appeals Court presidents.
   The indictments must be made by Parliament, acting on the
recommendation of deputies, in the session immediately following
the one in which the crimes were allegedly committed.

   Glenda Jackson, winner of two Academy Awards
and two Emmys, says she's dismayed by the roles being written for
actresses today, but sees hope in a pair of situation comedies.
   ``I would like to think that contemporary dramatists and
screenwriters would write more about women as they are, and not the
adjunct of the male,'' Miss Jackson said in a recent interview.
   The British performer, who won Oscars for ``Women in Love'' and
``A Touch of Class,'' said she likes the female characters in the
TV sitcoms ``Golden Girls'' and ``Roseanne.'' She said she's
pleased to see performers like Roseanne Barr who, with her plump
figure, doesn't conform to Hollywood beauty standards.
   ``In their different ways, it seems to me they're trying to
break through the concrete molds of what it is to be a woman,'' she
said of the two series.
   Miss Jackson is preparing to appear with John Lithgow in a
revival of ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' directed by
playwright Edward Albee at the UCLA James A. Doolittle Theatre in
Hollywood.

   An appeals court ordered
billionaire developer Donald Trump to fork over an additional
$81,000 a year in property taxes on his 100-room Palm Beach mansion.
   The Fourth District Court of Appeal on Wednesday overturned a
lower court ruling that had reduced the appraised value of the
estate from $11.5 million to $7 million.
   Trump bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in 1986 from the Merriweather
Post Foundation for $10 million. He later said he sealed the deal
with only $2,812 of his own money.
   But several days after the purchase, when a county appraiser
valued the home at $11.5 million, Trump claimed it was worth just
$7 million. The rest of the purchase price was for untaxable
furnishings, he said.
   Trump said the 54,000-square-foot estate, which stretches from
the Intracoastal Waterway to the Atlantic Ocean and includes a
nine-hole golf course, a citrus grove and a six-car garage, was so
huge that few could afford to buy it, lowering its value.
   The appeals panel upheld the Palm Beach County appraisal and
said the methodology employed by Trump was dubious.
   ``It's wonderful,'' said Willa Fearrington, an attorney for the
county, which put the annual tax bill at $208,341 when the dispute
began. Trump had said the annual bill should be only $126,816.
   This year, the county reappraised the mansion's value at $13.9
million.

   With a simple, ``Thanks, guys,'' Gen. Colin L.
Powell said farewell to the troops he commanded at the U.S. Forces
Command at Fort McPherson.
   Powell, who has become the first black to head the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, turned over leadership of the Forces Command _ known as
FORSCOM _ to Gen. Edwin H. Burba Jr., former commanding general of
the Combined Field Army in Korea.
   ``I'm saddened to leave FORSCOM and Atlanta,'' Powell said at
Wednesday's brief ceremony.
   The command provides a strategic reserve of troops and has 1
million men and women in active and reserve branches. During his
six-month tenure, Powell oversaw the activation of troops for duty
in Panama during unrest over elections and for duty in the Virgin
Islands and South Carolina after Hurricane Hugo.
   ``You need troops for a hurricane; no sweat, we've done it
before,'' Powell said.

   Entertainer Frank Gorshin is suing Harrah's
Marina Hotel Casino, claiming it reneged on a contract for his
appearance.
   Gorshin, who played the Riddler in the ``Batman'' television
series, is seeking $75,000 in damages in a suit filed Tuesday in
U.S. District Court. On July 14, Harrah's canceled his contract to
appear at the casino's Bay Cabaret Oct. 4 through Oct. 30. The
55-year-old impersonator was to have been paid $15,000 for the
appearance.
   Gorshin performed at the cabert in mid-June and walked off the
stage on more than one occasion, said Alyce Parker, a spokeswoman
for Harrah's.
   In a letter to Gorshin's agent, the casino's entertainment
manager, Bruce C. Rowe, referred to Gorshin's ``continuing
inappropriate and unacceptable behavior that does not meet the
standards of Harrah's or the industry in general and is clearly not
in the best interest of our guests.''

   When actor Jack Scalia said this city had
opened its heart to the cast and crew of the CBS-TV series
``Wolf,'' Mayor Art Agnos unleashed his heart on the star.
   The mayor invited the cast and production chiefs of ``Wolf'' and
NBC's ``Midnight Caller'' to a City Hall reception Wednesday to
thank them for filming in his city. He credited the two shows with
bringing $16 million a year to the local economy and employing more
than 450 residents.
   ``There is no question the film business is good for San
Francisco,'' Agnos declared.
   ``The people of the city have been more than magnanimous with
our show,'' Scalia told the gathering. ``I was raised in New York
and I can say it's much cleaner than New York. The people are a lot
friendlier. The restaurants here are great, and the city has opened
its heart to us,'' he said, adding, ``We can be comfortable here.''
   At that point, the mayor, looking as if he'd just been handed a
million dollars, leaped in and gave Scalia a hearty kiss on the
cheek.

<HEAD>State Of Emergency Declared To End Oil Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Rodrigo Borja imposed a national
state of emergency and put petroleum installations under military
control after oil workers went on strike.
   Workers at the U.S.-owned Texaco Inc. walked off the job early
Wednesday demanding severance pay. The action came just days before
the company is to turn its operations over to the government.
   ``A state of emergency is declared and constitutional guarantees
are suspended,'' Borja said in a decree signed late Wednesday.
   Troops were sent to petroleum installations controlled by Texaco
and the state-owned oil company, PetroEcuador. Together, the
companies produce 90 percent of the country's daily oil output of
300,000 barrels.
   Luis Roman, president of PetroEcuador, said the move was to
prevent sabotage and to ``protect national interests.''
   Besides being involved in oil exploration and drilling
operations, Texaco runs the 300 mile-long Trans-Ecuador pipeline,
which transports oil from Ecuador's jungle fields to the coast.
   Texaco spokesman Guillermo Cevallos said the strike shut down
the oil fields, the pipeline, ship-loading facilities and company
offices. Oil exports _60 percent of Ecuador's export earnings _
were paralyzed, he said.
   Government spokesman Gonzalo Ortiz said oil reserves would cover
Ecuador's need of 120,000 barrels daily for the time being.
   The 170 striking Texaco workers want severance pay from the
company, which has agreed to turn over its operations to the state
on Oct. 1. It was not immediately clear how much compensation the
workers were demanding.
   The contract between the government and Texaco expired in March
1986, and the government decided in September last year to take
over the company's operations.

   For University of Virginia senior
Mike Cloud, President Bush's education summit means he must be up
and out of his room by 6 a.m.
   But others are getting a chance to see some of their classroom
studies acted out in real life, and they're taking the opportunity
to talk with the nation's chief government executives and leaders
of the media.
   Kimberly Zenarolla, a freshman who hopes to get into
broadcasting, says the summit is a chance to meet people such as
Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and CNN reporter Bernard Shaw.
   ``I've been totally into it,'' said Miss Zenarolla, a Virginia
Beach native whose picture with Shaw appeared Wednesday on the
front page of The Cavalier Daily, the student-run newspaper. ``The
whole thing has been so exciting.''
   After watching a television crew interview Virginia Gov. Gerald
L. Baliles, host governor for the summit, Miss Zenarolla told
Baliles, ``I want to be governor of Virginia someday.''
   ``I would pursue it,'' Baliles told her. ``I'd vote for you.''
   But Cloud, a philosophy and history major from Wilmington, Del.,
was not bubbling over about having to leave his room on the
university's West Lawn before dawn.
   ``I suppose it's worth it for the security of the president, but
I'm not sure it's worth it for all of the rhetoric,'' he said of
the summit.
   Cloud's room is near the center of the university founded by
Thomas Jefferson. The area has been disrupted for various periods
when Bush was around.
   Some classes were moved to make room for visitors at the two-day
summit, prompting Lisa Roberge, a junior from Richmond, to wonder
why the event wasn't scheduled for two weeks later, during fall
break.
   Still, she said, ``most students here feel it's a prestigious
event to have at the university.''
   The student newspaper, in an editorial on the summit's opening
day, took note of the prevailing mixture of ``confusion and
hassles'' with ``unprecedented excitement.''
   ``The university's investment in this publicity plum should
provide abundant returns and an enhanced reputation for many years
to come,'' the editorial said.
   Many students are taking a keen interest in the discussions
President Bush is having with the nation's governors about a topic
they are expert on _ education.
   ``Certainly, not all problems will be solved here,'' said Brett
Marston, a senior from Appomattox, Va. ``But at least it'll bring
education into the national spotlight.''
   Marston, a government major, said the federal government should
take a more active role in education, not so much for funding, but
to improve the efficiency of public school systems.
   Kimberly Harrison, a junior majoring in economics, said the idea
of developing national standards to measure educational performance
is a good one.
   But Miss Harrison, from near Petersburg, Va., said the money
question is more crucial to schools.
   ``I don't want to pay for it. You don't want to pay for it,''
she said. ``But I think that increasing taxes is the only way we
can pay for it all.''

<HEAD>House Members Want Diplomatic Relations With Angola</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 60 House members are asking the Bush
administration to move towards establishing diplomatic relations
with Soviet-backed Angola.
   Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Africa, introduced the resolution
Wednesday, saying it is ``in the interest of the United States to
take immediate and significant measures to normalize relations with
the government of Angola.''
   The resolution, signed by 42 Democrats and 15 Republicans, calls
for the United States to establish a liaison office in Luanda, the
capital; for support of Angola's full participation in the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund, and for U.S. assistance to
help Angola rebuild its war-ravaged economy.
   Meanwhile, lawmakers from both chambers have invited Jose
Eduardo dos Santos, the president of Angola, to visit the United
States as soon as possible ``to explore with you the perspective of
the Angolan government'' on a range of issues.
   Among the 34 people signing that letter, which was dated Sept.
21, were Sens. Paul Simon, D-Ill., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Africa subcommittee, and Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   The congressional actions come as members of Congress are
debating the future of U.S. policy on Angola, an oil-rich country
in southeastern Africa where civil war has raged for nearly 14
years.
   Some Democrats, led by Wolpe, have charged the Bush
administration is too biased in favor of Jonas Savimbi, the rebel
leader who has fought the central Marxist government for over a
decade.
   The United States provides as much as $50 million to Savimbi in
what experts believe is one of the largest military covert aid
programs in the world. Savimbi is scheduled to come to the United
States to lobby for more money next week.
   Republicans and administration officials contend, however, that
dos Santos' Soviet-backed government, is to blame for the failure
of peace efforts to end the conflict.
   ``There is absolutely no question that the major obstacle to
peace is the intransigence and duplicity of the communist
dictatorship in Luanda,'' said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ill.
   He said it is unlikely the government would ever agree to
voluntarily share governing power with Savimbi's forces.
   ``If we do not keep up the pressure on them at this critical
juncture, there will be no hope for reconciliation,'' he said.
   Wolpe said at a hearing Wednesday that administration officials
are hampering peace prospects by failing to deal fairly with the
Angolan government.
   ``U.S. policy towards Angola is simply not working,'' he said.
``Now is an appropriate moment to advance the public debate of U.S.
policy _ to question whether policy should be determined by rigid
ideological commitments ... or whether there is a possibility for
greater rationality and balance in U.S. foreign policy.''
   Another Democrat, Rep. George Crockett of Michigan, charged that
``the State Department policy plays into the hands of South
Africa.'' South Africa provides aid to Savimbi.
   But Warren Clark, the assistant secretary of State for African
affairs, said Washington will continue to support Savimbi until a
reconciliation between the two sides in Angola is achieved.
   ``The administration believes that lasting peace and national
reconciliation can take place only in a scenario in which there are
no losers, only winners,'' he said.
   Clark dismissed the idea of diplomatic links with Angola until
national reconciliation is achieved.

   The nation's five-year program to restrict
steel shipments from 29 countries ends Saturday, but the Bush
administration will extend the curbs for 2{ years under agreements
with some of the countries, says a trade official.
   ``We do have some agreements, but I want to make an announcement
Monday morning,'' Christina McCown, a spokeswoman for U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills, said Wednesday.
   While McCown declined to say what nations had come to terms, she
did provide a list of countries that had sent representatives to
Washington this week for negotiations.
   The list included many of the United States' leading steel
trading partners: Japan, South Korea, the European Community,
Mexico, Venezuela and Romania.
   The earlier agreements were negotiated by the Reagan
administration in 1984 to give U.S. steelmakers breathing space
from foreign competition and allow them to modernize.

<HEAD>Philly Brokerage Suspended Over Penny Stock Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Philadelphia brokerage has been fined
$50,000 and suspended from the National Association of Securities
Dealers following accusations of manipulating the price of a
publicly traded stock.
   The NASD said Wednesday the action was part of a crackdown on
fraud and abusive sales practices in the penny-stock market.
   Bailey, Martin &amp; Appel Inc. was accused of violating the NASD's
anti-fraud provisions by artificially increasing the price of stock
for Northgate Industries Inc., a shell corporation with no assets.
   The firm neither admitted nor denied the allegations. It settled
the case by paying the fine and agreeing to the suspension.
   Two of the firm's owners, who also were suspended from the
association, denied any wrongdoing. They said they had agreed to
settle the case to prevent a long, costly legal fight.
   ``We feel they've made an enormous mountain out of a molehill,''
said Donald Bailey, chairman of BMA Group Ltd., the holding company
that owns Bailey Martin.
   Howard M. Appel, a co-owner of the firm, said the sales involved
only 30 clients and none had complained to the association, which
regulates over-the-counter stocks.
   The association's market-surveillance committee filed a
complaint in July stating that Bailey Martin had acquired 70
percent of Northgate's stock at 20 cents per share shortly before
it merged with Starcom Entertainment International Inc., a company
with no operating history or revenues.
   After the merger, the brokerage increased the price of the stock
to $3 per share _ an increase of 1,400 percent _ by purchasing and
selling shares at higher prices despite ``limited wholesale and
retail demand for the stock,'' the complaint said.

<HEAD>Ag Committee Chairman Vows Farm Bill By Spring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Agriculture
Committee says he expects to see a 1990 farm bill on President
Bush's desk next spring, with or without an administration
blueprint.
   Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, said Wednesday the 1990 farm
bill will not be held up so trade negotiations can proceed ``in
Geneva or any other place.''
   De la Garza reacted to recent comments by Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter who has indicated that only minor work might be
necessary on current farm law until substantive progress is made in
the Uruguay Round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade.
   The current Food Security Act of 1985 will expire at the end of
next year, and Congress is just getting started on a 1990 bill.
   Much of the nuts and bolts of the legislation will bear directly
or indirectly on GATT trade policies and whether the United States
will be successful in its bid to scale back _ and eventually
eliminate _ trade barriers and subsidies that distort agricultural
trade.
   Yeutter said earlier this week in Minneapolis, Minn., that he
expected only minor changes in the commodity portions of the 1985
farm law and that major modification could come in 1991 after GATT
negotiations are completed.
   De la Garza said it is up to Congress to legislate and decide
how long a farm law will be in effect.
   ``The Congress will decide whether or not to accept or reject
any agreement made by the administration in Geneva or any other
place,'' he said in a statement.
   ``We will cooperate to the extent possible with the
administration, but it is my firm intention to continue with our
stated goal of concluding the most extensive set of farm bill
hearings in history by the end of this calendar year,'' de la Garza
added.
   Further, he said, ``it is my intention to begin the markup of a
farm bill early in 1990,'' with or without a proposal by the Bush
administration.
   Yeutter has said he expects the administration to send its 1990
farm bill to Congress by the end of this year.
   De la Garza said he wants to have a five-year farm bill
completed and on the president's desk by the end of May.

   A National Farmers Union official says
President Bush's proposal to reduce the capital gains tax rate
would attract many non-farmers into agricultural investment.
   Mike Dunn, NFU legislative director, said Wednesday that his
organization's policy is ``opposed to rescinding capital gains''
although there are some inequities in the current law.
   Dunn said the current law puts an unfair load on some farmers,
primarily those who have had to restructure loans as provided by
the 1987 Farm Credit Act. In some cases, he said, high capital
gains taxes offset any write-off benefit that might be extended by
lenders.
   When that happens, the borrower can be pushed into bankruptcy or
liquidation to settle the debt.
   The Bush proposal, however, includes some worrisome provisions
that could be attractive to outside investors _ a common practice
before Congress overhauled the tax structure three years ago, Dunn
said.
   ``We would see (the capital gains proposal) as an excuse for
absentee landlords to get back into agriculture,'' he said.
   The American Farm Bureau Federation, on the other hand, has
applauded the recent House Ways and Means Committee approval of
reduced capital gains taxes. It would help ``mom-and-pop type''
farmers, not just rich people, said federation president Dean
Kleckner.
   But analyst Chuck Hassebrook of the Center For Rural Affairs,
Walthill, Neb., noted the USDA's own economists had reported the
1986 Tax Reform Act tightened up the investment loopholes and that
``tax breaks became more progressive'' in agriculture.
   In other words, he said in a telephone interview, the
higher-income farmers paid a larger proportion of the tax load as a
result of the 1986 reform.
   With a reduction in capital gains, he said, the impact would be
to shift tax burdens off the highest-income farmers.
   ``If we raise the capital gains exemption, we'll again turn
farmland and breeding stock into tax shelter investments,''
Hassebrook said.
   By doing that, livestock herds could increase, thus boosting the
supply of meat and milk and depressing prices that farmers are
paid, he said.

   The Agriculture Department says preliminary
payments totaling $248 million are going out to states as their
share of national forest sales receipts are collected this fiscal
year.
   F. Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, said Wednesday
total state shares for the fiscal year than ends Sept. 30 are
expected to be more than $331 million, up from $318 million last
year.
   By law, 25 percent of the revenues collected by the USDA agency
for the sale of timber and other use of national forest resources
must be returned to the states where the forests are located. The
states are required to use the money for schools and roads.
   The 10 largest preliminary payments will go to Oregon, $118
million; California, $39 million; Washington, $33 million; Idaho,
$7 million; Arkansas, $6.2 million; Montana, $5.4 million; Arizona,
$5.3 million; Alaska, $3.2 million; Pennsylvania, $2.8 million; and
Mississippi, $2.6 million.

<HEAD>Southern Boll Weevil Democrats Poised for Return Engagement in House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Those Southern boll weevils, who gave the
House Democratic leadership fits early in the Reagan
administration, are on the rise again.
   This time, conservative Southern legislators are swing votes in
the confrontation between President Bush and House leaders over
conflicting tax plans.
   To win approval of his plan to cut the tax rate for capital
gains, Bush will need strong support from Southern Democrats. He
got it on the House Ways and Means Committee when six Democrats _
five of them Southerners _ joined Republicans to support Bush over
their committee chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.
   The Democratic leadership offered an alternative plan that would
revive the deduction for Individual Retirement Accounts and pay for
it by raising taxes on the richest 600,000 couples and individuals.
   Few of the 1981 boll weevils remain in the House, but their
ideological heirs are prime targets of lobbying on the competing
tax bills.
   ``The Bush proposal gives a tax break for the rich, paid for by
the middle class. Our proposal gives Individual Retirement Accounts
to the middle class, paid for by the super-wealthy,'' is the way
House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt defines the issue.
   The White House portrays the leadership alternative as another
Democratic proposal to raise taxes.
   Many Southerners are siding with the president, particularly
those whose districts include hundreds of small farmers and
businessmen, timber owners and real estate investors. They reject
the idea that a capital gains tax cut benefits only the wealthy.
   ``Timber is the number one industry in Georgia and I have no
qualms in speaking out for it,'' said Democratic Rep. Lindsay
Thomas.
   ``We've made our case and there are many people (in Congress)
who have listened and that's what the party leadership is not
listening to,'' he said. ``We've got to start talking about
assisting the middle-income people who've been defecting from our
party.''
   But the new boll weevils are far from united on the issue.
   Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, a leader of the 1981 defection
to Reagan, is backing the leadership bill, saying that a capital
gains cut now would increase the federal deficit.
   In Georgia and Alabama, only one of 14 House Democrats indicated
support for the leadership alternative. Three others were
undecided, but the rest said they were solidly behind the capital
gains reduction.
   Rep. Ben Erdreich, D-Ala., said he has been a long-time
supporter of a lower tax rate for capital gains and does not intend
to abandon that position for a plan that includes a tax increase of
nearly $40 billion.
   ``There's no question that what they (the leadership) have
fashioned is appealing, but I just have a problem starting out with
a tax increase at the front end of budget deliberations,'' Erdreich
said.
   The Democratic leadership's plan would raise the tax rate for
family income above $155,000 and individual income above $93,000
from 28 percent to 33 percent. The 33 percent rate now applies only
to family income between $74,850 and $155,000 and individual income
between $44,900 and $93,000.
   The plan also would provide a scaled-down capital gains tax
break by eliminating the 33 percent bracket for capital gains, so
that the tax on profits from asset sales would never climb above 28
percent.
   Rep. Buddy Darden, D-Ga., said he voted against the 1986 tax
reform law because it eliminated IRA deductions. But he said he
won't support the leadership alternative because, ``I frankly doubt
the sincerity of this plan since it was created for the sole
purpose of derailing the capital gains reduction.''
   Rep. Roy Rowland, D-Ga., is particularly sensitive to charges of
party disloyalty since he won his seat in 1982 by criticizing his
boll weevil Democratic opponent for supporting the Reagan economic
program.
   ``I don't like to call myself a boll weevil,'' he said. ``I look
at myself as a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who has some
allegiance to the leadership in the House.
   ``But my primary responsibility is to the people in my district
and my district is the largest timber-producing district that is
privately owned in the U.S.,'' he said. ``There are a lot of people
who are small landowners and small timber owners who are going to
be helped by this capital gains reduction.''

<HEAD>Senate Chairman Wonders if Bush Choice is ``James Watt Clone''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, expressing reservations about President Bush's choice
for a top Agriculture Department post, says he doesn't want ``a
James Watt clone'' in the job.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., opened confirmation hearings
Wednesday for James Cason, whose tenure as an Interior Department
official was strongly criticized by environmentalists, by saying he
had ``serious reservations'' about Cason.
   Cason was nominated by Bush to be assistant secretary of
agriculture for natural resources and the environment, the
department's job overseeing national forest land and agricultural
conservation programs.
   ``Mr. Cason has no professional training in forest land-use
stewardship and neither training nor experience in soil and water
conservation,'' said Leahy.
   Leahy and other committee members pressed Cason for four hours
about decisions he made during his seven years at the Interior
Department.
   Environmentalists have charged that Cason in 1986 tried to
prevent a report from becoming public that said the spotted owl's
existence could be endangered by the harvesting of old growth
forest in the Pacific northwest.
   Cason told Leahy he did not try to hide the report, saying
changes needed to be made and he was holding it until ``it was
cleaned up.''
   Cason, 35, also said that contrary to accusations, he did
nothing to hold up a petition to prevent listing the spotted owl as
an endangered species.
   He also defended the sale of land under his jurisdiction at well
below market costs to private interests who made large profits by
reselling the properties. Sen. Kent Conrad said that in one
instance, an 1872 law was used to sell land for $42,000 to private
interests who sold it a few weeks later for $37 million.
   The sale was one of several actions Cason took in the final
three weeks of the Reagan administration, some of which were either
stopped or reversed by President Bush's interior secretary, Manuel
Lujan.
   Cason said he had been working on the sale for two years and
wanted to get it finished before the next administration came in
and that he had been following a mandate from then-Secretary Donald
Hodel to continue with business despite the impending change in
administrations.
   Decisions by Cason that were changed by Lujan included an audit
agreement with 12 major oil companies that would have caused states
and Indian tribes to lose royalty payments, and a policy that would
have allowed surface mining in national parks.
   ``What appears here is not just doing the job,'' said Leahy.
``But an overabundance of zeal.''
   In his opening statement, Leahy said, ``We are at a time when a
strong and heightened awareness of the environment is needed in the
Department of Agriculture _ a spirit of cooperation among all
interests has to prevail.
   ``We do not need a James Watt clone in this position.''
   The Agriculture Committee has scheduled an Oct. 3 hearing for
environmental groups to give their views on Cason.

<HEAD>Authors Say U.S. Paying Unfair Share for Olympic Coverage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two researchers say the financial setup of the
Olympic Games is a ``travesty'' that demands enormous sums from the
American networks while giving sports coverage to other nations at
cut rates.
   Those other countries can turn their savings into big subsidies
for their athletes, the authors contend in their study, ``Fool's
Gold: How America Pays to Lose in the Olympics.''
   NBC paid $300 million for the rights to the 1988 Summer Olympics
in Seoul and needed 5,000 commercials in 179 hours of air time to
recover its costs, Robert Z. Lawrence and Jeffrey D. Pellegrom note
in the study for the Brookings Institution.
   Even then, the network later returned $70 million to advertisers
because of low ratings, they say in the fall issue of The Brookings
Review.
   ABC paid $309 million bid for the U.S. rights to the 1988 Winter
Olympics in Calgary and lost some $65 million when expenses
exceeded advertising revenue.
   Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, meanwhile, paid only $3
million combined to get rights to the Seoul Games. Western Europe,
negotiating through a single body, paid just $5.7 million total for
the Calgary rights.
   The study says that after each competing nation receives a share
of the TV monies from Olympics organizers, the Soviet Union and
East Germany may be getting more back than they spend on TV rights.
   The East Bloc nations may then lavish funds on their athletes.
   ``The funding setup for the Olympics is a travesty,'' the
authors say.
   ``We pay more than our fair share for the games, we have to put
up with an excessive number of commercials to see them, and our
athletes receive little of the money we do pay,'' they say.
   The IOC divides the money between the host city, judges and
officials, media centers, the national Olympic committees and the
IOC itself.
   The U.S. Olympic Committee got 2.5 percent of the $609 million
ABC and NBC paid for the summer and winter games in 1988, the study
says. USOC's share for the 1992 games, for which CBS and NBC are
paying $644 million, will be 10 percent.
   Lawrence and Pellegrom suggest the U.S. government and the U.S.
Olympic Committee form a joint entity that would auction the U.S.
television rights. That group then would negotiate for U.S. TV
rights with the IOC, as other nations do.
   Presuming the auction amount is higher than what is finally paid
to the IOC, the excess money could be used to support athletes, the
authors say.
   Congress might have to grant the networks an antitrust exemption
for them to bid together.
   CBS on Wednesday refused comment on the article, and NBC
officials did not return a call seeking reaction.
   Dennis Swanson, president of ABC Sports, said ``We have no
response on any proposals at this time.''
   One network official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
he did not see how a government-USOC body could make substantial
changes. Also, the official said, ``We don't think it is the burden
of the networks to finance the training of the athletes.''
   He denied the networks were overbidding.
   ``When a network bids on a rights package ... they take a look
at what its value is. Obviously, networks aren't going to be
spending money that they can't justify.''
   Lawrence and Pellegrom acknowledge most foreign TV networks are
non-commercial and public owned and can't afford huge fees, but say
there are an increasing number of commercial networks and the
American networks no longer should have to foot the Olympics bill.
   Lawrence is a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington think tank. Pellegrom is a research
assistant.

   Additional safety tests ordered on the three
Savannah River reactors that produce a gas needed for nuclear
warheads could lead to further delays in restarting the idled
reactors.
   The order announced Wednesday by Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins marked a switch from his earlier position that the tests
need not be completed before restarting the reactors, which have
been plagued by various mechanical problems.
   In a related development, Watkins confirmed the department was
considering a possible two-year delay in underground testing at
Yucca Mountain, a Nevada desert site being studied for use as the
first permanent dump for nuclear waste.
   The Savannah River complex, near Aiken, S.C., is the nation's
only source of tritium, a radioactive gas used to boost the
explosive power of nuclear warheads. All three reactors have been
shut down for more than a year for repairs.
   Watkins made no mention of a possible restart delay. His
spokeswoman, Christina Sankey, said later it was ``too early to
tell'' whether a delay was likely.
   Watkins announced Sept. 7 that the first of the three Savannah
River reactors would begin low-power testing late next summer and
would start production by the end of 1990. He ordered ultrasonic
testing of the reactor vessels to begin immediately, but he did not
require completion of the tests before restart.
   Ms. Sankey said Watkins changed his mind about the testing after
some of his own advisers said it should be completed in all three
reactors before any one is restarted.
   The timing of a Savannah River restart is viewed by the Bush
administration as critical because of dwindling supplies of the
gas. Tritium decays relatively rapidly and therefore must be
replenished to keep nuclear weapons fully operational.
   The Savannah River reactors have had a history of cracks and
leaks in the primary cooling system pipes as well as flaws in the
backup cooling systems. A leak from a crack in the vessel of
another Savannah River reactor, known as C reactor, was discovered
in 1984. That led to its permanent shutdown a year later.
   Watkins also announced that ultrasonic testing that began
recently on the P reactor vessel at Savannah River had discovered
``a potential indication'' of a crack ``in excess of nine inches''
in the area of a welded seam. He said the finding is still being
studied and that further tests are being performed on the P reactor.
   He said the significance of the problem had not yet been
determined, although Ms. Sankey said later, ``We're quite confident
there is no crack'' in the vessel.
   Ms. Sankey said there was ``no technical reason'' to condition a
K reactor restart on completion of the ultrasonic testing, but that
Watkins chose to impose the condition in order to ``instill greater
public confidence in the restart program.''
   In ultrasonic testing, sound waves are bounced off the reactor
vessel, and any abnormalities show up as breaks in the waves.
   Restarting the Savannah River reactors and completing a
suitability study of the Yucca Mountain, Nev., waste dump site are
two of Watkins' highest priorities.
   In a letter to Sen. Richard H. Bryan, D-Nev., on Tuesday,
Watkins said a senior department official had suggested a delay in
underground testing at Yucca Mountain in order to more intensely
study surface-level features that could disqualify the site.
   Watkins stressed ``no decisions have been made'' on the matter.
   The underground work had been scheduled to start earlier this
year but has been held up by Nevada's refusal to grant the needed
environmental permits.

   Congressional liberals and conservatives are
seeking middle ground on a measure barring federal grants for art
considered obscene, but the ban's author says he won't let them
``gut'' his proposal without a fight.
   House-Senate negotiators planned today to discuss Senate-passed
legislation by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., barring federal assistance
for ``obscene or indecent'' art. It also forbids government backing
of materials that offend people because of their race, ethnic
background, religion, age or handicap.
   ``We're trying to work it out now,'' Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill.,
a liberal opposed to the Helms amendment, said after the two sides
debated the issue briefly Wednesday. ``I recognize this is a matter
that has provided controversy for decades and for centuries.''
   Helms said the art he opposes ``is the promotion of
homosexuality, and as long as I have breath in me, the American
taxpayer isn't going to be forced to subsidize this kind of
garbage.''
   The provision is part of a Senate measure providing $10.9
billion for federal land and cultural programs for the 1990 fiscal
year, which begins Sunday. The House's $11.5 billion version
includes no such language.
   Negotiators faced other issues, too. The Senate measure contains
new reporting requirements for lobbyists that the House bill lacks.
The Senate _ not the House _ also allows large tracts of federally
owned forest in the Northwest to be felled by timber companies and
bars environmentalists from using legal action to block some of the
cutting.
   The most intense public reaction has been to the Helms
amendment, which pits worries about government censorship against
concerns that tax dollars should not spent on offensive work.
   Helms, not among the bargainers, told a reporter the negotiators
are ``going to gut'' his proposal. He said he might force the
Senate to vote ``three or four times before we're through'' on
whether to reject a compromise and restore his original proposal.
   Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, a conservative who defended Helms'
provision, said he has unsuccessfully sought an alternative. He
told reporters the Helms measure leaves unclear what should be
considered obscene or offensive.
   But he said, ``I still haven't found language which is an
adequate substitute.''
   McClure said a study is needed of the grant-making process used
by the National Endowment for the Arts. The endowment has come
under fire for spending $45,000 on two controversial exhibitions _
one including a photograph by Andres Serrano of a Christ figure in
a jar of urine, and the other including Robert Mapplethorpe
photographs depicting homosexual acts and erotic poses by children.
   Yates said he was considering offering guidelines, similar to
Supreme Court rulings, permitting federal aid to art that attains
certain artistic, scholarly or other standards.
   He also discussed the possibility of giving more responsibility
to top officials of the endowment. He said the endowment granted
money for the Serrano show before the artist produced his work, and
for the Mapplethorpe exhibition without seeing all of the
photographs in advance.
   The Senate adopted the Helms amendment with almost no debate on
a July 26 voice vote. On Sept. 13, the House rejected 264-153 an
attempt by conservatives to accept the Helms amendment.
   The House voted July 12 to cut a symbolic $45,000 from the
endowment's $171.4 million budget to protest the controversial
grants, but lawmakers rejected conservative efforts to eliminate or
severely slash the endowment's budget.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Funds for Drug War, Testing of Transport Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposal to test millions of transportation
workers for drug and alcohol use is gaining in Congress along with
the Senate-approved $9.4 billion compromise to finance the war
against drugs.
   ``The war within our borders is a more terrifying and insidious
threat than any war on foreign shores _ so we must not be timid,''
Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said Wednesday as the Senate approved
the drug plan 97-2.
   ``We're not going to whip this problem in one year, three years
or four years. Let's find out what works,'' added Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. ``We're going to save a generation if we
can. It may take a generation to do it.''
   The Senate added the drug plan to an $11.9 billion bill for
transportation programs in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, and
included some other drug-related provisions, including testing for
transport workers.
   The measure also bans smoking on all domestic airline flights.
Current law bans smoking on flights of two hours or less, and the
total ban was added last week over the objections of tobacco-state
senators.
   The Senate approved the transportation bill 99-0 and sent it to
a House-Senate conference committee to resolve differences with a
House-passed version.
   The anti-drug compromise was worked out by the White House and
senators of both parties began after Democrats sought to add $2.2
billion to the $7.9 billion plan outlined by President Bush in a
nationally televised Sept. 5 speech.
   Democrats said Bush's funding for prevention and treatment was
inadequate.
   The final compromise includes the original $7.9 billion plus
$400 million for crime-fighting programs not directly related to
drugs, $200 million for juvenile justice, $800 million for
prevention and treatment and $100 million for law enforcement. The
additional money would come from a 0.43 cut in federal spending.
   The Senate approved the transportation drug and alcohol testing
plan, sponsored by Sen. John C. Danforth, D-Mo., on a voice vote
with no opposition.
   It would cover an estimated 125,000 airline and Federal Aviation
Administration workers, 172,000 railroad employees and 3 million
motor carrier workers, such as bus and truck drivers.
   Private industries would be required to pay for random,
pre-employment tests as well as tests ordered for cause or
following accidents. The Transportation Department could also order
periodic testing.
   ``The need for this legislation is obvious,'' Danforth said.
Since an Amtrak-Conrail collision at Chase, Md., three years ago
that killed 16, ``there has been an average of one train wreck
every 10 days in which testing has subsequently disclosed drug or
alcohol abuse,'' he said.
   A measure passed by the House in July covers only the rail
industry and would bar the firing of employees merely because they
tested positive. The Senate version would leave that decision to
the employer.
   The transportation bill includes $11.9 billion in new spending
plus $15.9 billion from previously collected taxes. It calls for
$12.2 billion for highway projects, $7.3 billion for aviation
programs and $3 billion for mass transit assistance.
   Another measure attached to the transportation bill on a voice
vote would earmark $50 million of the money in the drug package for
drug treatment and aid for pregnant women, new mothers and their
babies who have drug problems.
   Voting against the drug funding plan were Republicans Jake Garn
of Utah and Steve Symms of Idaho. Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., did
not vote.
   Garn issued a statement saying the ``problem with the drug bill
is that it essentially was the product of a bidding war between the
administration and Congress over who is going to spend the most on
drugs.''
   He said the cuts it envisions would hurt key programs, adding,
``We are not going to solve the drug problem by just throwing money
at it.''

   However history judges the education
summit, one thing is certain: George Bush came better prepared than
Franklin Roosevelt did the last time a president convened the
nation's governors.
   That was in March 1933 when FDR summoned the governors to the
White House two days after his inauguration to discuss unemployment
benefits, taxes and other issues in the midst of the Depression.
   Roosevelt, the former governor of New York, tendered the
invitation to fellow governors a month before his March 4 swearing
in.
   But the tasks of getting his grips on the reins of government
while preparing emergency decrees to deal with a run on the
nation's banks left Roosevelt with little time for the governors.
   As FDR aide Rexford G. Tugwell later wrote, ``he was caught in
such a tangle of events that when he was wheeled into the East Room
... and faced the assembly of state executives, he had no prepared
address and was not ready to discuss the several matters mentioned
in his invitation.''
   The gathering took place the same morning the new Democratic
administration had promulgated a 1 a.m. decree closing the nation's
banks _ Roosevelt's famous bank ``holiday.''
   By Roosevelt's own account in his public papers, ``There simply
was not enough time in which to do all the things which had to be
done.''
   Speaking extemporaneously to the 25 governors and
representatives of a dozen others who had answered his call,
Roosevelt told of his plans to restore stability to the banking
system and ``prevent the withdrawal of any further gold and
currency.''
   The governors gave the distracted president a unanimous,
bipartisan show of support. They adopted a resolution expressing
their confidence in Roosevelt and urging both Congress and the
American people to back his efforts to restore ``banking and
economic stability.''
   Tugwell said the summit gave Roosevelt ``a chance to reassure
them concerning federal aid and to show them that a firm hand was
on the wheel. They responded.''

   Chinese students are using the
education summit to prod President Bush to take a tougher line with
the government in Beijing.
   Organizers said Chinese students from more than 70 American
universities have endorsed a nine-page memorandum expressing
``disappointment'' with Bush's stance since the June 4 massacre in
Tiananmen Square.
   The appeal, spearheaded by the Chinese Student and Scholars
Society at the University of Virginia, said, ``The Chinese
democratic movement is now in a very difficult situation.''
   It urged Bush ``to take a firm stand on the side of the Chinese
people and to take appropriate measures to push the Chinese
government toward democratization.''
   ``Since the massive persecution in China is still going on, we
advise the United States not to eagerly seek improved elations with
the communist regime at this time,'' the memo says.
   The students support investments in China's private sector, but
urged the U.S. government ``to do nothing that would provide
financial and economic support for China's repressive ruling
clique.''
   Bush cut off military sales, withdrew U.S. support for loans to
China by international lending institutions and barred high-level
contacts after the Chinese government crushed the pro-democracy
demonstrations with tanks and troops.
   Quingsong Zhang, a spokesman for the University of Virginia
group, said the memo will be sent to Congress and the State
Department and will be given to the White House staff at the
education summit.
   The memo says the United States faces a ``crucial time of
decision. Will (it) repeat policies of the past by adhering to the
unpopular communist government and alienating the Chinese people,
or will it sacrifice short-term interests by standing with the
Chinese democratic movement and gaining a long-term friendship with
the people of China?''
   ``We firmly believe that the current regime will not last long.
We hope that by the end of the 20th century, a new, open and
democratic government will be established in China,'' it said.

   Governors meeting with President
Bush to find cures for the nation's education ills are pressing the
case for less federal red tape, more accountability and a greater
commitment to help youngsters at the earliest age.
   ``If you want a slogan, it's exchange red tape for results,''
Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton told reporters Wednesday evening.
   Citing an example of federal rules that slow reform, Clinton
said current regulations forbid students in evening adult classes
from using computers bought for disabled children with federal
dollars.
   In urging Bush to give the states more flexibility, New Mexico
Gov. Garrey Carruthers said: ``Let us do it our own way. We will
demonstrate that we're doing it better.''
   Bush, for his part, responded to the call for deregulation with
a challenge for more specifics on how states will prove they are
getting results with less regulation.
   Governors met in three closed-door sessions Wednesday with Bush
and his Cabinet, discussing how to revitalize the teaching
profession, how to improve the learning environment, and who should
be in charge of governing schools.
   Clinton and other governors indicated that they hoped the summit
sessions will produce the raw material to develop concrete national
reform goals, possibly as early as the February meeting of the
National Governors' Association.
   Clinton said, ``The federal funding question is not the major
issue for this summit,'' although some governors have said they
want the federal government to boost its share of school spending.
   Federal drug czar William Bennett, who headed the education
department during the Reagan administration, said the exchanges
between governors and administration officials were sometimes
``feisty,'' especially when several questioned the lag in federal
education spending compared with defense.
   The discussion, Bennett said, was marked by ``standard
Democratic pap, Republican pap, with occasional outbursts of
candor.''
   On early childhood programs, the governors repeated their call
for full funding of federal programs such as Head Start. But
neither Bush nor anyone in his administration gave a clear signal
that they were ready to adopt full funding as a goal.
   ``It is a good program, it works, but it is not available except
to about 27 percent of the (eligible) students,'' complained
Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, a Democrat.
   Pennsylvania Gov. Robert P. Casey, a Democrat, said one of his
concerns is accountability in education, saying efforts to improve
schools need objective criteria to measure their success.
   Another session on how to revitalize the teaching profession
centered on, among other issues, how to recruit more minority
youngsters, but ``with a recognition that for a long time to come
minority students will be taught mainly by white teachers,'' said
Washington Gov. Booth Gardner, co-chair of that group.
   A two-page memo summarizing objectives for the summit by the NGA
outlined seven possible national performance goals, including:
   _All preschool-age children be ready for first grade by the year
2000.
   _Student achievement levels ``will rise to internationally
competitive levels,especially in math and science.''
   _``Disparities in achievement levels of students of different
races and economic backgrounds will be dramatically reduced.''
   _The number of students going on to college or other higher
education will be dramatically increased.
   _Adult illiteracy be ``virtually eliminated.''
   _Schools will have well-trained teachers and the technology to
be competitive.
   The memo proposed that once goals are set and ways are found to
achieve them, ``we should move to a report card issued every year
on the efforts of students, schools, the states, and the federal
government.''
   The memo suggested that governors urge Bush to get each member
of his cabinet to target federal resources to ten of the largest
and most troubled districts and ``50 to 100 poor rural districts''
to reduce racial and economic disparities in educational
opportunities.
   States, for their part, should agree to ``restructure the
education system in each state,'' work with the federal government
to reduce losses in the student loan program, and work toward
drug-free schools, the memo said.

   A powerful congressmen who has been critical
of the Food and Drug Administration has asked the agency to add to
its generic drug review those drugs with a narrow margin of safety,
including ones used to treat epilepsy.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce investigations subcommittee, based his request on the 1988
recall of a generic version of an epilepsy drug.
   Pharmaceutical Basics Inc. of Denver recalled 50 million tablets
of generic carbamazepine because the tablets didn't dissolve
correctly. FDA documents released by Dingell show problems with the
drug became apparent after the company switched suppliers for its
raw ingredient.
   Dingell blames the FDA process for failing to assure the safety
and effectiveness of drugs like carbamazepine that have a narrow

<HEAD>Diuretics May Leave Patients More Susceptible to Heart Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Diuretics, a class of drugs routinely recommended
for millions of people battling high blood pressure, may increase
the risk of heart attacks, according to a study published today.
   Researchers have found the relatively inexpensive and widely
used weapon against hypertension can cause biochemical changes that
make patients vulnerable to adverse side effects.
   An estimated 15 million to 25 million of the nation's 60 million
high blood pressure patients use diuretics, which reduce blood
pressure by depleting the body of sodium. But increasingly,
researchers are recommending doctors consider alternative
treatments.
   The study published in the New England Journal of Medicine
indicates diuretics can act directly on body tissue to chemically
induce diabetic conditions, and can increase cholesterol levels.
   ``This is a major study,'' Dr. Randall Zussman, director of the
division of hypertension and vascular medicine of the Massachusetts
General Hospital, told The New York Times. ``It should make a
difference.''
   The researchers, Drs. Thomas Polare, Hans Lithell and Christian
Berne of the University of Uppsala in Sweden, gave 50 hypertension
patients either the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide or the
non-diuretic captopril without revealing to patients or their
doctors who got which drug. After four months, the patients'
medications were switched.
   The study found that the tissue in patients who took
hydrochlorothiazide was less responsive to the hormone insulin, a
resistance that could increase the risk of heart disease.
   The patients using diuretics also showed cholesterol levels 15
percent higher than those recorded in the subjects using captopril,
which reduces blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels.
   The non-diuretic users showed signs of increased sensitivity to
insulin and reduced cholesterol levels, the study found.
   Diuretics are among four classes of drugs recommended by the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute as initial medications
for reducing hypertension. The three other classes are ACE
inhibitors, like captopril; beta blockers; and calcium channel
blockers.

   Ten-year-old Joshua Dennis paced, prayed and
never gave up hope during the five days he spent trapped by
darkness inside an abandoned mine.
   After days of frantic search efforts and growing despair that he
would be found alive, Joshua was found Wednesday afternoon by a
mine search team that had passed within 150 feet of him during
previous sweeps.
   The youngster, suffering from dehydration and frostbitten feet,
was flown to a hospital in Salt Lake City, where his tearful
mother, Janeen, pronounced him ``gorgeous.''
   Joshua, a Cub Scout, became separated Friday night from a group
of Boy Scouts that his father was helping to supervise during the
expedition into the Hidden Treasure Mine in western Utah's Oquirrh
Mountains.
   Dennis said her son had faith he would be found.
   ``He never heard rescuers until today,'' she said Wednesday.
``And he heard their voices and he yelled for help and they heard
him.''
   Dr. Tony Woodward said the boy probably would lose some skin on
his feet, but would go home in three to four days with all of his
toes.
   Sheriff's deputies, Utah Power &amp; Light Co. mine rescue crews,
search dogs and dozens of volunteers had scoured the mine's tunnels
and surrounding canyon areas, but found no sign of the boy.
   Tooele County Sheriff Donald Proctor said hopes were dwindling
when power company rescuers Ray Guymon and Gary Christensen went
back in the mine Wednesday afternoon to recheck an ore pocket with
local historian John Skinner.
   The three probed the area for about 30 minutes and then heard a
cry for help, Guymon said.
   Christensen scrambled up a 150-foot incline and found Joshua in
a cavity in the ore pocket about 500 feet from where he was last
seen and more than 2,000 feet from the mine entrance.
   The boy seemed well and was shocked to learn he'd been lost five
days, Christensen said.
   ``He was one brave little boy. He wasn't crying. He wasn't
scared,'' Christensen said.
   Word of the rescue was met with tears, cheers and embraces by
family members and their neighbors in Kearns, who planned a block
party to celebrate.
   ``It's amazing,'' Guymon said. ``We did not expect to find the
boy in the condition that he's in. This was the ultimate of what we
were hoping for.''
   Christensen said searchers had been through the passageway just
below the ore cavity about 10 times, but the cavern muffled sound
and Joshua would not have been detected had he not cried out at
that moment.
   ``He was just isolated in a little hole that you couldn't see
until you were on top of it,'' he said.
   Proctor had said other Scouts apparently teased Joshua into
entering the mine and then tried to scare him once he was inside.
   The boy told hospital personnel he had become separated from his
father, Terry, and the older Scouts and tried to find his way out
by feeling the walls.
   Hart Bullock, chief executive of the Great Salt Lake Boy Scout
Council, said the incident would be discussed by the Boy Scouts of
America's national health and safety committee in November.
   Hidden Treasure Mine, a gold, silver and zinc mine last worked
in 1953, will be sealed, Proctor said.

<HEAD>Word `Bush' Found on Packages of Cocaine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The names ``Bush'' or ``Bush I'' were found on
several packages of cocaine seized in a raid. Four Colombian men
were arrested.
   Officials said it was unclear whether the labels found on 19 of
the 93 packages of cocaine worth about $17 million were a derisive
reference to President Bush, who is aiding the crackdown on
Colombian drug lords.
   But they speculated on the possibility.
   ``The president has brought the issue to an issue of national
priority unlike the issue has ever been brought to that point
before,'' said Robert Stutman, special agent in charge of the Drug
Enforcement Administration office in New York.
   ``So if you're a businessman down there selling dope you've
clearly got to say this guy is a pain in the neck to us.''
   Stutman said the word ``Bush'' had been found on cocaine
packages several other times in the city this year, and that
authorities are checking to see if it had been found in drug raids
elsewhere.
   Police trailed a car to the home in Great Neck, Long Island,
after watching a drug pickup in the New York City borough of Queens.
   Police seized 210 pounds of cocaine. The four men were charged
with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, authorities said.

   The state attorney general's crime
prevention coordinator was stabbed in the back on his first day on
the job, authorities said.
   Chuck Moltz, 42, was stabbed with a hunting knife Wednesday as
he leaned into his car to get a radio out, said Sheriff Paul
McGrath.
   The car was parked across the street from the attorney general's
office when the unknown assailant stabbed Moltz, the sheriff said.
   ``He didn't try to take anything. It's really an odd case.
There's no apparent reason,'' said McGrath.
   The sheriff said Moltz ``turned around and tried to chase the
man, but he felt a little uncomfortable.'' That's when Moltz
realized part of the 6-inch blade was still in his back, McGrath
said.
   Moltz was taken to a fire station and later sent to Carson-Tahoe
Hospital, where he was listed as stable. Doctors closed the wound,
but no operation was necessary.

   Two American kestrels, the
product of a surprise union of two injured birds in captivity, have
been set free for a life in the wild.
   The chicks' parents had been expected to languish in their home
at Dreher Park Zoo in West Palm Beach, but turned out to be very
active.
   ``We never expected them to reproduce,'' said Gail Schneider,
zoo executive director. ``They came into captivity as adults.
That's considered pretty stressful for them. So we didn't pay any
attention to their breeding behavior. And then, lo and behold, the
female was sitting on eggs.''
   She laid four eggs. One chick died. One broke a feather Tuesday
on its trip to the Everglades National Park, delaying its release.
   That left a 4-month-old male and female from the threatened
species, the smallest member of the falcon family. The birds were
released in the park Tuesday.

   Darryl Hartley-Leonard, the latest doorman and
bartender at the Hyatt Regency Chicago hotel, turned in his
uniforms and surrendered his tips after only one day on the job.
   That's because Hartley-Leonard, 45, had to return today to his
regular job _he's president of the Hyatt Hotel Corp.
   He wasn't alone. Thomas J. Pritzker was to return to being
chairman of the Hyatt Corp. after spending Wednesday as a bellhop
at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Washington, D.C. About 400 other
corporate bigwigs also celebrated the hotel chain's 32nd
anniversary by taking service-level jobs for one day.
   The program was called ``Hyatt in-Touch,'' and Hartley-Leonard
intends to make it an annual event.
   ``See, they even tip me,'' he said in front of the hotel, where
he hailed taxis and greeted guests. He pulled a wad of crumpled
dollar bills from his pocket.
   Hartley-Leonard even got to open the door for The Fat Boys rap
group, who were in town for a concert. They didn't tip, though.
   The hotel president, who started working for Hyatt 26 years ago
as a desk clerk, said he started the program when he found out that
340 of the company's 426 executives and managers had never held a
hotel service job.
   ``By doing service jobs for a day, maybe they'll understand a
bit more what service means,'' he said.
   Hartley-Leonard didn't go the whole day without being found out.
One guest stopped and read his name tag.
   She said, ```No, you're not,' but I told her, `Oh, yes I am,' ''
he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Stocks Up In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen for the
fourth consecutive day today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key
index rebounded to another new high.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which fell
74.25 points on Wednesday, shot up 319.41 points _ 0.90 percent _
on Wednesday, closing at 35,689.98. The previous record high
closing was 35,444.82 on Tuesday.
   Stock dealers said market players, especially institutional
investors, were reassured by the yen's recovery against the dollar
after last weekend's agreement among seven major industrial nations
to cooperate in stopping the dollar's recent rise.
   Trading was active, with first section volume estimated at 1
billion shares, the same as on Wednesday. Among gainers were steel,
chemical and electrical issues.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 140.85 yen, down 0.50
yen from Wednesday's 141.35-yen finish. It opened at 140.70 yen and
moved between 140.65 yen and 141.00 yen. The dollar has fallen 4.15
yen in four days.
   After opening lower following a downswing on overseas markets
overnight, the U.S. currency moved little during Tokyo trading,
said Yoshitsugu Hanada, a trader with Mitsui Bank.
   ``The dollar's uptrend was halted by the concerted central bank
interventions that became especially powerful after the G-7 (Group
of Seven) meeting last weekend,'' he said. ``But the market expects
the 140-yen level will probably be the lowest it can go for now.''
   The Bank of Japan sold dollars as soon as the U.S. currency
climbed above 140.80 yen early Thursday, and sold more when it
almost touched 141.00 yen, said Toru Kanai, foreign exchange
analyst with New Japan Securities Co.
   The amount of selling by the central bank was not known. The
bank does not comment on its exchange market activities.

   Senior Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap
today embraced the leaders of military units returning from
Cambodia, where the pro-Hanoi government was said to be losing
territory to guerrillas.
   Before the outdoor ceremony to welcome back thousands of troops,
Vietnamese generals said that their last units had left Cambodia
Tuesday, ending a nearly 11-year struggle against resistance forces
in the neighboring country.
   Vietnam says it has now withdrawn the last 26,000 of its troops
from Cambodia. But the Cambodian guerrilla resistance claims
thousands of Vietnamese soldiers have stayed, disguising themselves
as Cambodians.
   Rebel radio broadcasts monitored in Bangkok, Thailand, on
Wednesday said 3,000 Vietnamese troops were defending the gem-rich
Cambodian town of Pailin near the Thai border from a three-pronged
attack by Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
   Gen. Nguyen Van Thai, chief spokesman for the Ministry of
Defense, denied the claim but said guerrilla forces had taken some
territory.
   The announced Vietnamese withdrawal has raised fears that
Cambodia will slide into a protracted civil war.
   Wars and bloody revolution have kept Cambodia torn by conflict
for the last 20 years. The Khmer Rouge, the strongest of three
resistance groups, sent hundreds of thousands of Cambodians to
their deaths in trying to turn the country into an agrarian commune
from a nearly four-year rule that ended with Vietnam's 1978
invasion.
   Giap, 78, told reporters after the welcoming ceremony that peace
can be achieved in Cambodia if countries supporting the resistance
respond to Vietnam's pullout by ending their aid.
   ``Now that Vietnamese troops have been withdrawn, the ball is on
the other side,'' he said. ``If they don't respond, the Cambodian
people must continue their fighting.''
   Giap a key strategist during Vietnam's war with the United
States,currently is vice chairman of the Vietnamese Military
Council.
   He said Vietnam would ``patiently try to achieve a political
solution'' to the guerrilla war in Cambodia.
   ``We have created a favorable condition for a political
settlement by withdrawing from Cambodia. Now other countries must
stop their military support'' for the guerrillas.''
   China supplies arms to the insurgents, while Thailand has
allowed them to set up bases on its territory.
   In the back of the troop formations during the outdoor welcoming
ceremony, soldiers chatted with giggling girls from Le Qui Don, an
elite girls' school.
   ``It's nice to talk to Vietnamese girls again,'' said a
22-year-old soldier grasping a bouquet of flowers given by the high
school girls.
   Few other residents of Ho Chi Minh City took part in the
ceremony in front of the city hall, formerly South Vietnam's
presidential palace.
   ``I'm happy the soldiers have come back, so mothers and fathers
won't have to worry any more and families will stop losing their
sons,'' a shopkeeper said.
   Asked if Vietnamese troops might return to Cambodia, Giap said
it now is the ``duty of the international community'' to prevent a
return of the Khmer Rouge to power.
   Nguyen Vinh Nghiep, chairman of the People's Committee of Ho Chi
Minh City, called the withdrawal of troops from Cambodia a big
event for Vietnam, and said ``people all around the world are
paying attention.''
   Behind him, a large banner read, ``Solidarity forever between
the peoples of Vietnam and Cambodia.''
   Many Western countries have withheld diplomatic recognition of
Vietnam and the Phnom Penh government because of Vietnam's invasion
and continued military presence.
   Officials from both countries say they hope the withdrawal will
encourage the establishment of political and business ties with
other nations.
   Asked if Vietnamese troops should have withdrawn earlier from
the stalemated guerrilla war, Giap said he disagreed:
   ``American troops, after eliminating Japanese fascism, remained
in Japan, and in Germany and in South Korea. Have they been there
too long?''
   Giap said he believed the troop withdrawal would lead to peace
in Cambodia.
   ``I'm optimistic. I think the international community loves
peace and justice, and in the end we will find a peaceful
solution.''

<HEAD>London To Facilitate Emigration of Some Hong Kong Residents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Secretary John Major of Britain
says London will make it easier for some Hong Kong residents to
resettle in Britain if their freedom is threatened by China as it
takes control of the colony in 1997.
   Major also promised a more representative government for Hong
Kong and an early bill of rights for the colony that sets forth
basic liberties such as freedom of expression and travel.
   These fall under a ``package of concrete measures to reassure
people in the territory about their future,'' Major said Wednesday
in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly.
   Many Hong Kong residents, anxious about their future under
communist China after its repression of the pro-democracy movement,
have appealed to Britain to let them emigrate.
   London has ruled out large-scale immigration from Hong Kong.
   But Major said it would give people considered ``essential to
Hong Kong's future stability and prosperity'' guarantees of
resettlement in Britain if they wish when the colony reverts to
Chinese rule.
   This was believed to cover citizens such as senior public
servants but it was not immediately clear how the ``essential''
citizens would be chosen and how many would be allowed to emigrate.
   Major said Britain would hasten the introduction of a
democratically elected government in Hong Kong, where the
legislature currently is appointed. The aim is for half the seats
to be chosen in popular balloting by 1995.
   He said the measures to be implemented and the resettlement
offer were to encourage citizens to stay in Hong Kong and push
China to uphold its promises under a 50-year agreement to maintain
the colony's freedoms and way of life.
   ``Practical reassurances are required from China to the people
of Hong Kong, so that they may feel secure in their future both up
to 1997 and beyond,'' Major said.
   Hong Kong is resilient and its economy is thriving, ``but it
will take time, steady nerves and, above all, an explicitly
supportive attitude on the part of China, to restore Hong Kong's
confidence in its future,'' Major said.
   ``Millions of us around the world were shocked to see Chinese
troops kill and wound their fellow citizens on the orders of their
own government,'' he said. ``No government can survive indefinitely
by the suppression of peaceful dissent.''
   Major said London's response to the June military crackdown in
China is not intended to isolate Beijing.
   ``We hope to see China return to genuine reform and repair the
damage done to her international relations,'' he said.
   In London on Wednesday, Chinese and British officials began
three days of talks on the issue. British officials pressed Beijing
authorities for pledges that China will respect human rights and
preserve Hong Kong's position as the major Asian financial center.

   A teen-ager charged with murdering his
parents, sister and brother with an ax had talked to his friends
about killing his family as ``a kind of game,'' a prosecutor said.
   Jurors were presented with grisly evidence at the start of the
trial Wednesday, including photos of the carnage and a
blood-spattered ax the prosecution claims was used in the killings.
   Olmsted County District Judge Ancy Morse told jurors not to
discuss any trauma the trial may cause them, and said the county
would provide counseling to anyone seeking it after the trial ends.
   Seventeen-year-old David Brom is charged with first- and
second-degree murder in the Feb. 18, 1988 ax slayings of his
parents, Bernard and Paulette Brom, both 41; his sister, Diane, 13;
and brother, Ricky, 11.
   If he is found guilty, a second phase of the trial will be held
to determine if he was mentally ill at the time of the slayings and
therefore not responsible.
   Brom was dressed neatly and sat with his back to a half-filled
courtroom gallery, showing no emotion.
   County Attorney Ray Schmitz told jurors that Brom repeatedly
talked to friends about killing his family as part of ``a kind of
game.''
   The ``game,'' as the teen-agers referred to it, also called for
Brom and his friends to flee to the West or South after the
killings, Schmitz said, adding that some scenarios included talk of
the friends killing themselves.
   The prosecutor said a friend of Brom would testify that Brom
proposed different alternatives for killing his family and talked
on one occasion about practicing doing something against his mother.
   Schmitz said Brom admitted the killings in a conversation with a
friend. And he said Brom told a friend he had an altercation with
his father the night of the killings.
   ``Suddenly,'' Schmitz said, ``it moved from the game to
something far more serious.''
   Brom's palm print was found on a bloodstained ax found in the
family's home, the prosecutor said.
   A defense attorney said he does not plan to challenge evidence
linking the defendant with the slayings. Conceding that the jury
likely will reach ``a guilty verdict of some type,'' lawyer
Terrence Walters said he would argue that the slayings were not
planned and Brom should be convicted of the lesser charge of
second-degree murder.

<HEAD>Canadian Pair Survive Trip Over Niagara Falls in a Barrel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two men who became the eighth and
ninth persons to survive a ride over Niagara Falls in a barrel said
they did it to show kids there are better things to do than drugs.
   ``It felt like a roller coaster ride, falling straight down,''
Jeffrey Petkovich said afterward. ``But with a roller coaster ride,
you come to a minor stop. You feel it, but not as much as we did.''
   Petkovich, 25, of Ottawa, and Peter DeBernardi, 42, of Niagara
Falls, Ontario, rode a 10-foot metal container over the
176-foot-high Horseshoe Falls on Wednesday to become the first pair
ever to go over together in the same barrel.
   Three people did not survive the plunge.
   ``We wanted to show these kids there's a lot better things for
kids to do than be on the brink of dope,'' DeBernardi said.
   The two suffered ``very, very minor cuts and scrapes'' during
their ride, said Constable David Jahns of Niagara Parks Police.
   Jahns said DeBernardi and Petkovich entered the Niagara River
about 100 yards from the brink of Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian
side of the border at about 5:30 p.m. They were rescued at the
bottom by park police, but the barrel was still in the water and
was to be recovered today, he said.
   Both men were charged with unlawfully performing a stunt in the
park. DeBernardi, who had been saying for 18 months he would
perform the stunt, also was charged with engaging in a prohibitive
activity in the park, Jahns said.
   The men were released pending an Oct. 26 appearance in
Provincial Offenses Court in Niagara Falls, Jahns said.
   The metal barrel, lined with foam on the inside, was about 10
feet long and 4 to 5 feet high, Jahns said.
   ``Your chances are quite low on the 1-to-10 scale type of
things, no matter how high-tech your equipment is,'' he said.
   The last person to make the rough journey was John David Munday
of Caistor Center, Ontario, who went over on Oct. 5, 1985, and
survived.
   A month before Munday went over, Steven T. Trotter of
Barrington, R.I., successfully took the plunge. The previous year,
Karel Soucek of Hamilton, Ontario, also made a successful trip, but
he was killed six months later when he tried a similar barrel drop
at the Astrodome in Houston.
   The first daredevil to attempt the stunt was Annie Edson Taylor,
a Michigan school teacher. She survived the trip in 1901, although
she was badly injured.
   Those who have died going over the falls were George Stathakis
in 1930, Charles G. Stephens in 1930 and William ``Red'' Hill Jr.
in 1951.
   Only one person has ever survived the plunge outside a barrel.
Nine-year-old Roger Woodward was accidentally swept over the falls
in 1960. Although he was wearing only a life jacket, he was plucked
from the water unscratched.

   A Royal Navy warship was en route to Colombia
today as part of a British aid package requested by Colombia's
government to help it battle the country's powerful cocaine cartels.
   The ship will patrol Colombia's coast looking for drug
traffickers, but will not have the jurisdiction to arrest or detain
suspected drug traffickers, the Defense Ministry said.
   A ministry spokesman would not identify the ship involved, but
British news reports said the frigate HMS Alacrity was en route
from the Caribbean island of Montserrat where it had been helping
to clean up from Hurricane Hugo.
   Britain will also provide a secure communications network to
help protect government officials, judges and other senior
Colombian figures under death threats from the drug traffickers,
and protective clothing such as bulletproof vests for people at
risk.
   British military advisers will be sent to help train local
officials in bomb disposal and protection skills, and all-terrain
motorbikes will be sent to provide greater mobility for drug
enforcement teams working in remote areas.
   The package was outlined by Foreign Secretary John Major at the
United Nations and by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher speaking at
a Wednesday night reception in London.
   ``What we have offered is certain help after requests from the
Colombians,'' Mrs. Thatcher said. ``Of course we, in any event, try
to intercept drugs before they come on the seas.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said there were three steps to tackling the global
drugs problem.
   The first was ``to stop the countries from growing it, because
that's where the trouble starts,'' she said. The second was to
track down the people who were laundering drugs money and the third
was ``to try to stop the demand by warning people,'' she said.
   The Royal Navy is experienced in maritime surveillance, having
for many years patrolled the seas around Hong Kong searching for
vessels carrying illegal immigrants, drugs and other illicit
merchandise to the British colony.
   Capt. Richard Sharpe, editor of ``Jane's Fighting Ships,'' said:
``The Royal Navy has developed great expertise, both in Hong Kong
and in the fisheries protection role, in detecting and intercepting
vessels. Often these people are armed so you really need people who
are highly skilled.''
   ``Finding a drug runner is no different to finding a fast attack
craft coming in to fire a missile at you,'' Sharpe said.
   ``To sort out what you are interested in from a mass of radar
contacts is where military expertise is invaluable and it is
something the Royal Navy trains vigorously for.''

<HEAD>Thai Army says Cambodia Guerrillas Seize Many Areas in West</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cambodian guerrillas have after fierce
fighting seized many areas of western Cambodia from which
Vietnamese troops have recently withdrawn, a Thai army spokesman
claimed today.
   Lt. Gen. Naruedol Dejpradiyuth said fighting between rival
Cambodian factions had intensified over the past month in parts of
the country close to the Thai frontier.
   He said it appeared that the three guerrilla factions opposing
the Hanoi-backed Phnom Penh government were taking the opportunity
of the Vietnamese troop pullout to capture key positions.
   Vietnam said that it had completed the withdrawal of its last
26,000 troops from Cambodia on Tuesday.
   Naruedol said a civil war was inevitable in Cambodia now that
the Vietnamese have gone. Hanoi's withdrawal has given the
guerrillas their best opportunity yet to oust the Phnom Penh
government, he said.
   He said heavy fighting has been reported in the Ratanamondol
district near the important gem-trading town of Pailin.
   There were also battles at Sisophon in Battambang province and
in the northwestern province of Oddar Meanchey, he said.
   The guerrillas have taken many important areas formerly held by
government troops, the Thai general said, including positions
opposite the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet and another further
north opposite the town of Ta Phraya.
   He said the guerrillas killed many government troops and
captured 15.
   The Phnom Penh army was forced to bring in 3,000 extra troops to
help defend areas in Battambang and Oddar Meanchey, he said. The
new troops came from Phnom Penh and included draftees from Kompong
Cham, located northeast of the capital, he said.
   The general said morale among the government forces seemed low
and that since Sept. 20, 146 Cambodian government soldiers had
deserted their units and fled to Thailand. The latest group of 27
arrived on Tuesday, he said.
   Thailand is a major supporter of the resistance. Details of
Naruedol's battlefield reports could not immediately be confirmed
by other sources.
   Naruedol said that many heavy shells had fallen into Thailand
from the fighting over the past month. Three Thai villagers had
been killed in the southern part of the border between the towns of
Chantaburi and Trat, he said.
   On Wednesday, thousands of refugees at a United Nations refugee
camp on the Thai border were forced to flee as hundreds of shells
landed nearby. They were believed fired by Cambodian government
troops reacting to Khmer Rouge guerrilla operations in the area.
   The strongest of the guerrilla factions, the Khmer Rouge has
claimed several victories recently, both near Sisophon and around
the gem trading center of Pailin.
   Phnom Penh officials recently have admitted some setbacks at
Pailin.
   One official said the Khmer Rouge was firing up to 2,000 mortar
rounds a day at the town.
   The fanatical communist Khmer Rouge was responsible for the
deaths of hundreds of thousands of Cambodians when it ruled the
nation between 1975 and 1978, when Vietnam invaded.
   Many Cambodians have said they fear a return to power by the
Khmer Rouge. But Phnom Penh officials insist their army is capable
of fighting the guerrillas without Vietnamese military support.

   A Soviet cosmonaut and an American astronaut
have landed in Mars on a special educational mission, and Martian
school children and just about everybody else in town are on cloud
nine.
   ``I don't think I'll ever forget this because I'll probably
never see a cosmonaut again or an astronaut for that matter,''
10-year-old Mandy Rooker said after the spacemen visited her
classroom at Adams Intermediate Elementary School.
   ``There's a certain pride today,'' said third-grade teacher Suzi
Wingfield.
   Cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev and astronaut Mario Runco Jr. spent
Wednesday talking about space travel with students and discussing
the need for cooperation between the two countries. They planned to
visit other schools in the district today and Friday.
   ``Children must study for a working future and maybe we will
work together,'' said Krikalev, 31, a flight engineer who lives
near Moscow.
   ``It's important that they learn that the world is becoming a
better place to live,'' agreed Runco, 37, a Navy lieutenant
commander awaiting assignment to his first space shuttle mission.
   During a visit with 367 students at the Mars Primary Center,
Krikalev received gifts of crayon drawings and homemade Soviet and
American flags, letters, fresh-cut flowers and Russian tea cakes.
Dozens of other drawings and greetings adorned the hallways' walls.
   ``Welckim To Mars,'' one first-grader wrote on a note
accompanying a rocket ship made of purple construction paper.
   The cosmonaut handed out autographed photographs showing himself
and his two partners during a five-month French-Soviet Soyuz
mission that ended in April.
   ``It's not so much the gifts. It's the friendliness that went
behind the gifts. It's coming from the insides of the people who
gave the gifts,'' he said through an interpreter.
   Krikalev later was joined by Runco at the intermediate school,
where they addressed 275 second- through fifth-graders. Runco
presented a slide show and gave the school 485 NASA photographs.
   Pupils asked them what it's like to eat and sleep in a spaceship
and whether they are nervous about space travel. They also wanted
to know about life in the Soviet Union and how each man had trained.
   ``I have a question,'' Runco said at one point. ``What's it like
living in Mars?''
   ``Out of this world,'' several in the crowd replied.
   Krikalev and Runco were invited to this small community 25 north
of Pittsburgh by the Mars Area Foundation for Educational
Excellence.
   ``The goal was to bring unusual cultural programs to the school
district, and it has blossomed beyond anything I had imagined,''
said Ralph Terrell, foundation chairman.
   The two visitors were thrilled at the prospect of being the
first spacemen to set foot in Mars.
   During a brief jaunt into the center of town, each man put on a
rubber boot and stepped into a tray of brown clay and signed his
name in the clay. The footprints and signatures were sealed in
glass and marked with a plaque noting that both men ``stepped on
Mars, Sept. 27, 1989.''
   They also posed for pictures near a spaceship 10 feet in
diameter made from the lids of steel barrels.
   ``I didn't think I'd get there this soon,'' Runco joked as he
accepted a blue T-shirt emblazoned with the words ``I've already
been to Mars, Pennsylvania.''
   Krikalev said he consulted numerous maps and even an American
acquaintance to find out where Mars was before leaving on his first
trip to the United States. He could not locate it and was forced to
bring clothes for all kinds of weather.
   Krikalev knows how he will describe Mars when he returns home
early next week.
   ``I'll say it's a small town,'' he said, ``and the town is very
friendly.''

<HEAD>Health Costs Battle Continues Long After Other Phone Strikes Have
Ended</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A month after telephone peace was declared
throughout most of the land, negotiators are still trying to bridge
the long distance between 60,000 striking workers and northeastern
phone companies.
   The strike against NYNEX in New York and New England has gone
eight weeks. It has produced consumer complaints, allegations of
widespread vandalism, and little movement on the main issue: the
cost of health care.
   Talks have been intermittent. The first informal bargaining in
two weeks was scheduled for today in Rye Brook and in Boston.
   In August, workers staged walkouts against four of the Baby Bell
companies formed in the break-up of AT&amp;T _ NYNEX, Pacific Telesis,
Ameritech and Bell Atlantic. All except NYNEX were back at work by
the end of the month, though Pacific Telesis workers have since
rejected a tentative pact.
   NYNEX has insisted that its workers assume as much as $1,500 a
year in health costs.
   On that issue, ``NYNEX is really out there alone, away from AT&amp;T
and the other six Baby Bells,'' said Gaye Williams Mack, a
spokeswoman for the Communications Workers of America in Washington.
   The CWA represents 40,000 NYNEX strikers at New York Telephone,
a NYNEX subsidiary; they are joined by 20,000 members of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers who work for New
England Telephone, another subsidiary.
   To the union, NYNEX's stand ``really looks like a very classic
and depressing case of corporate greed,'' Mack said.
   But Paul Aran, an industry analyst with Bear Stearns, noted
NYNEX suffered losses in the last quarter.
   ``It's not their fault that doctor costs are skyrocketing in the
double digits. It's not anybody's fault,'' Aran said. ``Management
would like the labor force to pay for part of that increase.''
   NYNEX's 10.5 million customers are paying the price for the
dispute. The New York State Public Service Commission has recorded
more than 4,600 complaints against New York Telephone since the
start of the strike Aug. 6. There were 11,000 complaints filed in
all of 1988.
   Management workers have taken the place of union members. But it
is often impossible to get through to directory assistance, and
requests for phone installations often are delayed days or weeks.
   In Boston, the City Council has sought to question New England
Telephone officials about service disruptions due to the strike.
The executives have refused, and are fighting subpoenas.
   Today, the council was expected to consider a proposal to
withhold payment of the city's telephone bill until the strike is
settled.
   Service problems have been compounded by damage done by vandals.
New York Telephone said it has experienced more than 325 acts of
vandalism, affecting 75,000 customers since the strike began.
   On Tuesday, the company said, service was cut to 12,000
customers using voice and data circuits made of fiber-optics and
copper on Long Island in what officials called the worst act of
sabotage yet.
   In response, the company quadrupled its reward to $100,000 for
information that would flush out the vandals. ``This sabotage is
despicable and must be stopped,'' said New York Telephone's
president, Frederic V. Salerno.
   Strikers walk picket lines at all NYNEX installations; one
picket died early in the strike when he was hit by the car of a
woman who was crossing the line to get to work.
   A Westchester County grand jury began hearing evidence Tuesday
in the death of 34-year-old Edward Horgan at a NYNEX office in
Valhalla in suburban Westchester County who was fatally injured on
Aug. 15.
   Police said Horgan jumped on the hood of the woman's car,
pounded her windshield, then fell off and struck his head. The
union charges the car struck Horgan as the driver sped into work.
   The electrical workers union said it intended to reduce its wage
demands at today's negotiations; CWA spokesman Bob Master would not
confirm that the CWA planned a similar proposal, though the two
unions have acted in concert.
   Still, the two sides are dug in on the health costs issue.
   ``We are still firm that we are not going to accept payroll
deductions to maintain health benefits. We have not moved on that
principle,'' said Master.
   ``This theory of asking for employees to pay for part of their
health care costs is our principle and will continue to be,'' said
NYNEX's John Bonomo.

   China charged today that at least 30,000
disguised Vietnamese soldiers remain in Cambodia and indicated it
will continue to arm guerrillas fighting that country's pro-Hanoi
government until a political settlement is reached.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing, devoting much of a
weekly briefing to criticism of Vietnam, also renewed charges of
Vietnam's ``brazen violation'' of China's territorial sovereignty
in occupying islands in a disputed South China Sea chain.
   Li refuted Vietnam's claims of a troop withdrawal and said at
least 30,000 Vietnamese troops have changed to the uniforms of
Cambodian government troops.
   He contended that large amounts of weapons and military
equipment have been left behind and that Vietnamese officials
continue to control administrative organs in the ``puppet regime.''
   He said, ``hidden among the over 1 million illegal Vietnamese
settlers in Cambodia are many Vietnamese militiamen and special
agents. Clearly there has been no change in Vietnam's basic scheme
for keeping Cambodia under its control and creating an Indochina
federation.''
   Li's statement came a day after Vietnam proclaimed it had
completed the withdrawal of its last 26,000 troops in Cambodia,
ending an 11-year military presence in that country.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, ending nearly four
years of rule by a Khmer Rouge regime that sent hundreds of
thousands of people to their deaths in trying to turn the country
into a primitive agrarian commune.
   Asked whether China will continue to arm the Khmer Rouge and
other resistance forces, Li said all countries should stop military
assistance to Cambodia _ but only after the warring factions in the
country reach a political settlement and Vietnam genuinely
withdraws all its troops.
   Vietnam has urged those countries supporting the Cambodian
resistance _ China and Thailand chief among them _ to stop arming
the guerrillas, saying that only then can a political settelement
be achieved.
   On another matter, Li said that since June, Vietnam has sent
troops to invade and occupy a reef and two shoals in the Spratly
Islands, an archipelago in the South China Sea claimed by both
China and Vietnam.
   ``This is a brazen violation against China's territorial
sovereignty,'' he said, adding that those islands and others in the
area ``have been part of China's sacred territory since ancient
times and China has irrefutable sovereignty over all these islands
and their adjacent waters.''
   In March, Chinese naval forces sank three Vietnamese ships in an
exchange of fire off the islands that left more than 70 Vietnamese
sailors dead or missing.
   The Philippines, Taiwan and Malaysia also claim the islands and
the surrounding seas, which are thought to contain large oil
deposits.

<HEAD>Rudder Found Turned Left; Airline, NTSB Discount Report of Crew Drinking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL GEITNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rudder of a USAir jetliner was set wrongly
before last week's fatal skid into the East River, and that could
explain the drift the captain said led him to abort takeoff,
according to investigators.
   An airline spokesman and the National Transportation Safety
Board, meanwhile, dismissed a report Wednesday that the crew of
Flight 5050 had been drinking for five hours before getting into
the cockpit.
   The NTSB said the rudder trim in the 737-400's cockpit, which
holds the rudder steady, had been found in the full-left position.
   ``That would tend to want to move the plane to the left if he
didn't do other things to compensate for it,'' Ted Lopatkiewicz, a
NTSB spokesman in Washington, said of the pilot.
   He said it would be the responsibility of either the captain or
copilot to set the trim before takeoff.
   ``It clearly could have been one of the factors that led to the
crash,'' said Peter Baron, who heads the National Center for Air
Traffic Safety in New York, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group.
   The trim is on the pretakeoff checklist that the captain and
crew are supposed to go through, Baron said. But he added, ``It's
not the type of thing where you're going to get a warning horn if
it was mis-set.''
   The effect of setting the rudder to the left would not become
apparent until the plane built up speed during takeoff, he added.
   Capt. Michael W. Martin told investigators he aborted the
takeoff because the aircraft was moving left and he heard and felt
a strange vibration.
   Two passengers died in the Sept. 20 crash and 59 people
survived. The plane was scheduled to fly to Charlotte, N.C.
   Published reports have said cocaine had been found aboard the
plane. The Cable News Network, citing the NTSB, reported Wednesday
that more than a pound of cocaine was found in a piece of carry-on
luggage, but not among the holdings of the flight crew.
   But the NTSB's chief spokeswoman, Rachel Halterman, said, ``We
don't confirm that. That's absolutely ridiculous. That's nothing to
do with us. If it's true it's not a confirmation that would come
from us.''
   Also Wednesday, Lopatkiewicz and a USAir spokesman said the two
pilots had only about two hours between the time they landed at
LaGuardia from Baltimore and the time Flight 5050 left the gate.
   ``That's documented,'' said David Shipley, an airline spokesman
in Arlington, Va.
   In addition, Lopatkiewicz said the copilot was on the plane for
most if not all of that time, while the captain went to USAir
offices at LaGuardia.
   The New York Post reported Wednesday that a detective close to
the investigation said the crew may have spent as many as five
hours before the flight in bars near the airport.
   The newspaper said a passenger, Eric Trendel, the husband of a
USAir employee, told authorities immediately after the crash he had
been out ``bouncing'' with the captain and the copilot.
Investigators said they believed he meant ``drinking'' or ``bar
hopping.''
   But Lopatkiewicz said the NTSB had not turned up any suggestion
that the pilots went drinking.
   Trendel may be subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury
investigating the crash, the Post said. The Daily News quoted
unidentified sources as saying USAir also was subpoenaed because it
had been reluctant to cooperate with the investigation.
   Drug and alcohol tests on Martin and Kleissas came out negative,
but the urine samples were taken 48 hours after the accident,
making them useless for alcohol testing.

   An emigration boom permitted by Soviet political
reforms likely will force Washington to turn away more than 200,000
Soviets next year after decades of pressing Moscow to free
emigration, U.S. officials say.
   Under new regulations that take effect on Oct. 1, would-be
emigrants must fill out a questionnaire that will be sent directly
to Washington for consideration.
   Officials in Washington will then send notices to those who
qualify for interviews at the Moscow embassy. The system depends,
however, on the notoriously slow and unreliable Soviet mail and
U.S. officials acknowledged that people who deserve to emigrate may
fall between the cracks.
   U.S. Embassy officials said Wednesday they expect 300,000
applications in 1990 but will accept just 50,000 refugees. An
additional 20,000 to 30,000 Soviets may enter the country on a
conditional basis.
   Besides setting ceilings to contain growing numbers of potential
U.S. immigrants, the new procedure is intended to cut down on the
long lines outside the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
   The line to receive an application was said at one point to
include thousands of people, and a spot at the front reportedly
cost hundreds of dollars in bribes to Soviet police.
   Jews, who long have been an American priority, worry they will
now be forgotten. Refuseniks believe the new procedures will limit
Jewish emigration to the United States at a time when they say
anti-Semitism is on the rise in the Soviet Union.
   ``The situation here is getting worse,'' Elena Rappoport, a
leader of the Jewish refusenik group Poor Relatives, said in an
interview.
   The U.S. has said the 1990 Soviet immigration ceiling is higher
than the roughly 50,000 Soviets the United States will admit this
year.
   ``There is a limit to the number of Soviet emigrants, and to the
number of emigrants the United States can take,'' a U.S. Embassy
official said on condition of anonymity.
   Under the new regulations, three-quarters of the spaces are
likely to go to applicants with relatives in the United States.
Members of groups considered to be persecuted in the Soviet Union,
such as Jews and Pentacostalists, are also considered a priority.
   Jews will no longer be able to leave the country on an Israeli
visa and then apply for admission to the United States in Vienna or
Rome, where thousands are now waiting.
   Jews and Armenians together still make up the vast majority of
the applicants, but U.S. officials are seeing large increases in
applications from others since President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
liberalized emigration procedures.
   They said 10 percent, or more than 1,000, of the applicants in
August, were ethnic Russians, few with relatives in the United
States.
   One would-be applicant, 18-year-old Vladimir Azarov of Moscow,
said he had some brushes with the law because of his political
views and wanted to receive political refugee status.
   ``It's not that I have a big reason to leave the Soviet Union,
it's just that I want to live in the United States,'' he said.
   The United States is appealing to other Western countries to
help, the U.S. Embassy official said.
   ``Nowhere is it written that the United States should be the
only destination of Soviets who want to emigrate.''

   Dreams of a ``sub-Bay'' series are alive
as the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics clinched
division titles and earned berths in Major League baseball's
playoffs.
   The A's beat Texas 5-0 in Oakland on Wednesday to take their
second straight American League West title.
   ``This was probably the biggest victory of my career,'' said
Mike Moore, who pitched seven innings of one-hit ball. ``It wasn't
necessarily a do-or-die game, but better to do it now than later.''
   The Giants, the A's National League rivals across the San
Francisco Bay, backed into the league's West title despite losing
their third straight game, 1-0, to the Dodgers in Los Angeles. They
clinched later when the San Diego Padres lost to the Cincinnati
Reds, 2-1.
   ``We wanted to win this thing outright, but right now, we'll
take it any way we can get it,'' Giants slugger Will Clark said
while listening to the Reds-Padres game on the radio.
   San Francisco will take on the Chicago Cubs in the National
League playoffs beginning Wednesday in Chicago.
   The Athletics, whose eighth division title is the most for any
team since divisional play began 20 years ago, must wait for the
outcome of the American League East race between the Toronto Blue
Jays and the Baltimore Orioles for their opponent.
   If Oakland and San Francisco make it to the World Series, fans
can take the BART, the train that runs under San Francisco Bay
between the cities.

   With the purchase of Columbia Pictures, Sony
Corp. is acquiring some of the most treasured American films ever
made, from the classic drama ``Lawrence of Arabia'' to the classic
slapstick of ``The Three Stooges.''
   The giant Japanese electronics manufacturer announced the $3.4
billion deal Wednesday, giving it another foothold in the U.S.
entertainment industry.
   Sony bought CBS Records for $2 billion last year while looking
for properties to provide records and movies it hoped consumers
would use with its stereos and videocassette recorders.
   The Columbia deal will give it control of a major production
studio, a film library of 2,700 movies and 23,000 episodes of
television programming in 260 series.
   Columbia was attractive because of its successful stable of
television productions and its two film studios, Columbia Pictures
and Tri-Star.
   Among Sony's new holdings will be 11 films that have won Academy
Awards as Best Picture, including two with themes that were
anti-Japanese. ``From Here to Eternity'' in 1953 climaxed with the
Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor that drew the United States into
World War II. ``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' in 1957, portrayed
inhumane conditions in a Japanese-run prison camp.
   Columbia's other Best Picture winners were: ``It Happened One
Night,'' 1934; ``You Can't Take it With You,'' 1938; ``All the
King's Men,'' 1949; ``On the Waterfront,'' 1954; ``Lawrence of
Arabia,'' 1962; ``A Man For All Seasons,'' 1966; ``Oliver,'' 1968;
``Kramer vs. Kramer,'' 1979; and ``Gandhi,'' 1982.
   Columbia began in 1920 as the C.B.C. Film Sales Co., using the
initials of its founders, brothers Harry and Jack Cohn and Harry
Brandt. The founders changed the name to Columbia Pictures in 1924.
   Harry Cohn led Columbia's rise in a tiny studio on Hollywood's
Poverty Row, and the company's growth accelerated with the 1928
arrival of Frank Capra, who promptly directed seven films.
   Capra's movies of the 1930s _ including ``It Happened One
Night,'' ``Lost Horizon'' and ``You Can't Take it with You'' _
helped establish Columbia as a major studio.
   Cohn and Columbia produced some of the most popular and
sophisticated films of the 1930s and 40s _ ``One Night of Love,''
``The Awful Truth,'' ``Here Comes Mr. Jordan,'' ``The Jolson
Story,'' ``Cover Girl,'' ``All the King's Men.'' Among Columbia's
stars were Rita Hayworth, Glenn Ford, William Holden, Kim Novak,
Broderick Crawford and Judy Holliday.
   In 1952, Cohn formed a subsidiary, Screen Gems, to produce TV
series. The film division continued to thrive with such hits as
``Born Yesterday,'' ``The Caine Mutiny'' and ``The Bridge on the
River Kwai.''
   Columbia's television arm remains hugely profitable, making $155
million on revenue of $620 million in the company's last fiscal
year, ended Feb. 28.
   The television division has been boosted by newer shows such as
``Who's the Boss?,'' ``227'' and ``Designing Women,'' while
continuing to receive revenue from such older productions as its
more than 200 ``Three Stooges'' shorts. The films, made between
1934 and 1958, are frequently shown on television.
   With Harry Cohn's death in 1958, Columbia became host to
independent producers such as Sam Spiegel (``Lawrence''); Ray Stark
(``Funny Girl,'' ``The Way We Were''); Carl Foreman (``The Guns of
Navarone''); Otto Preminger (``Anatomy of a Murder''); and Stanley
Kramer (``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'').
   Columbia sold its Sunset and Gower studios in the heart of
Hollywood in the late 1960s and moved production to The Burbank
Studios, which it shares with Warner Bros. Inc.
   The Coca-Cola Co. purchased Columbia in 1982.
   Despite the soft-drink empire's attempts to inject its
production and marketing techniques into the movie business, its
film divisions declined. Tri-Star could not produce a solid hit and
Columbia sponsored the disastrous ``Ishtar.''
   In 1987, Coca-Cola combined Columbia and Tri-Star into a new
company, Columbia Pictures Entertainment, and retained a 49 percent
interest while distributing part interest to Coca-Cola shareholders.
   During Coca-Cola's ownership, Columbia's Loews Theatre
Management Corp. took off. Loews, acquired in 1986, is among the
nation's five biggest theater chains, with more than 800 screens in
220 locations.
   Still, Columbia's motion-picture arm has drifted in recent
years, with projects like ``Ghostbusters II,'' ``The Karate Kid
III'' and ``Casualties of War,'' failing to become runaway hits.

<HEAD>Valedictorian Cries During Sentencing for Beating Death of Mother</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN F. BONFATTI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOCKPORT, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A youth broke into tears as he described
why he beat his mother to death with a baseball bat on the evening
before he was to graduate as valedictorian of his high school class.
   But the show of emotion didn't sway Niagara County Court Judge
Charles J. Hannigan, who on Wednesday rejected William Shrubsall's
petition that he be granted youthful offender status and sentenced
him to 5 to 15 years in prison.
   Hannigan rejected defense attorney Paul Cleary's contention that
Shrubsall had been physically and emotionally abused for years and
that the abuse led to the beating death of Marianne ``Marge''
Shrubsall in the family's Niagara Falls home on June 25, 1988.
   ``In this case, from my way of seeing it, I don't think we have
any real physical abuse,'' Hanningan said. ``And I don't believe
there was any emotional abuse to any significant degree.''
   Shrubsall, 19, was originally charged with second-degree murder
in the death of his 56-year-old mother, but the charge was reduced
to manslaughter June 6 following a plea bargain.
   Cleary argued for about an hour that Shrubsall was entitled to
youthful offender status, which would have reduced his sentence
significantly and made it possible for the conviction to be
expunged from his record.
   Under state law, Shrubsall must serve at least 5 years of his
sentence before becoming eligible for parole.
   At the sentencing hearing, Shrubsall said the level of violence
in his house ``was getting worse'' since his father died two years
before. ``After my father died, there was no one there to defend
me,'' he said, crying.
   ``That was not the Cleavers,'' said Cleary, referring to the
idyllic family portrayed on the television series ``Leave It to
Beaver.'' ``This was not a happy household. This was a relationship
with problems.''
   But in refusing the youthful offender petition, Hannigan said he
thought Shrubsall ``came from basically a normal household.''
   Hannigan ordered the sentence be stayed until it could be
reviewed by an appeals court. He allowed Shrubsall to remain free
until the appeal is decided.

<HEAD>Mason Out of Giuliani Campaign After Remark About Dinkins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comic Jackie Mason says he was just joking, but
he agreed to stop mayoral campaigning after saying Democratic
candidate David Dinkins looks like ``a black model without a job''
and claiming Jews will vote for him out of guilt.
   The remarks, published Wednesday in The Village Voice, ended
Mason's affiliation with the campaign of Republican mayoral
candidate Rudolph Giuliani.
   ``Mason is withdrawing from the campaign because he didn't want
this matter to deflect from the importance of the campaign,'' said
Charles Perkins, a Giuliani spokesman. Perkins said Giuliani was
``troubled'' by Mason's remarks.
   At a news conference, Mason tried to show he is not racist by
producing a $100 canceled check he sent to the NAACP in 1988 and
having a black agent, Jim Willis, attest that Mason had hired a
number of black singers for his shows.
   As for his remark that Dinkins looks like a model, Mason said:
``I don't think a joke like that means anything. I said much worse
jokes about Jews.''
   He said he supports Giuliani because ``he's a great crimefighter
and blacks are suffering from crime more than anyone else. I wanted
him to help the minorities and the poor of this city, so now all of
a sudden they call me a racist.''
   Dinkins said he was ``not particularly'' offended by the remarks
but added, ``I can say that that kind of comment is not helpful to
our city.''
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, who lost the primary to Dinkins, and a
number of leading Jewish organizations issued statements denouncing
Mason's remarks.
   Mason also was quoted by the Voice as having said: ``There is a
sick Jewish problem of voting for a black man no matter how unfit
he is for the job. ... Jews are sick with complexes.'' He later
called that remark ``stupid.''
   The comedian said he was ``exaggerating to prove a point'' when
asked to comment on his remark that ``the Jews are constantly
giving millions of dollars to the black people. Have you ever heard
of a black person giving a quarter to a Jew?''

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Corazon
Aquino's statement on the death of former President Ferdinand
Marcos. The statement was made in English.
   We note the passing of Ferdinand E. Marcos, former president of
the Philippines. Speaking for the nation, I can say that he touched
the life of every Filipino who was his contemporary as no other
Filipino leader did before him. His rule changed our country.
   In what ways he changed it, I leave for now to others and
ultimately to history to describe. For at this moment of passage,
we must allow such a loss to transcend _ for his family _ politics
and history, and the opinions of men and women. No one should
trench on the dignity of this painful moment in the life of a
family.
   I personally condole deeply with the family he leaves behind
with all sincerity, for I and my children know the pain of such a
loss.
   It is, therefore, with deep regret that I must reiterate the
policy that our government has adopted after long and careful
deliberation.
   In the interest of the safety of those who will take the death
of Mr. Marcos in widely and passionately conflicting ways, and for
the tranquility of the state and the order of society, the remains
of Ferdinand E. Marcos will not be allowed to be brought to our
country until such time as the government, be it under this
administration or the succeeding one, shall otherwise decide.
   A chapter in the history of our nation, a chapter uniquely his
own, and a part of each of our lives, closes on this day with the
death of Ferdinand E. Marcos.
   Let us pray for his repose. I express again to his wife and
children my condolences and that of our people.''

<HEAD>Disabled Protesters Arrested For Blocking Bus Station</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto AX1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-five disabled demonstrators who blocked
more than a dozen Greyhound-Trailways buses to demand the
installation of wheelchair lifts were arrested and loaded aboard
police buses fitted with the devices.
   The protesters arrested Wednesday at the Greyhound-Trailways
station were released on their own recognizance, and buses that had
been stopped for several hours began rolling again.
   About 200 demonstrators surrounded one intercity bus, forcing it
to unload passengers on a busy downtown street. More than 18 other
buses were forced to unload passengers on side streets because of
the protest.
   The protesters parked their wheelchairs in front of the buses
and sat inside their luggage compartments. One demonstrator chained
himself by the neck to the steering wheel of a bus.
   Locking their wheelchairs together, they chanted, ``Access is a
civil right.''
   ``I am trying to hold up Greyhound because they are holding up
my life,'' said Clayton Jones, 41, of Houston, who lost the use of
his legs in a 1985 accident.
   Tom Street, regional manager of Greyhound-Trailways, asked
police to arrest the protesters.
   Police loaded the demonstrators into unmarked buses with lifts.
Charges included disorderly conduct, trespassing and failing to
clear streets and sidewalks.
   Protest leader Michael Auberger said his group, American
Disabled for Accessible Public Transportation, targeted the bus
line because Greyhound-Trailways has refused to add wheelchair
lifts because of the cost.
   He also said the group was demonstrating against a
Greyhound-Trailways policy requiring passengers in wheelchairs to
bring someone with them to carry them on and off.
   Street said he told the protesters that with 24 hours' notice,
Greyhound will help load disabled passengers. He also said major
stations will have mechanical lifts within two years.
   Wednesday marked the third day of protests in Atlanta by ADAPT.
Its members occupied a federal building on Monday and Tuesday in an
attempt to force the government to order wheelchair lifts installed
on public buses.
   That protest ended when Bush administration officials promised
to urge Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner to meet with the
protesters.

<HEAD>Ole Miss Ousts Fraternity For Racial Prank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Mississippi has banned a
fraternity for leaving two members naked and painted with racial
slurs at a mostly black college.
   The university's chancellor Wednesday said the incident had
opened an old wound at Ole Miss, which erupted in violence in 1962
when its first black student, James Meredith, enrolled.
   ``Nothing can totally undo the effects of the deplorable events
of September 18,'' Gerald Turner said in announcing he accepted a
hearing panel's recommendation to shut the Beta Theta Pi chapter
for three years.
   He gave the fraternity a week to close its house.
   ``Unquestionably, this action of the few has reflected very
negatively on the university community in such a way as to deny the
significant advancements in human relations that have occurred on
campus in the past few years,'' Turner said.
   The two fraternity members were carried by car to Rust College,
a small, private school 25 miles to the north, and their hands and
feet bound with duct tape before they were released. The two were
picked up by Rust security officers.
   Members of the fraternity, which had been active at the
university for 110 years, refused to comment Wednesday. Turner said
the 90-member chapter, suspended earlier by its national
organization, wouldn't appeal the ban.
   The chancellor said about 15 students may have had leadership
roles in the incident and some may be expelled.
   Students, faculty and the state chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People had called for
harsh penalties. An NAACP official also asked for a federal
investigation into racial discrimination by fraternities at the
10,370-student university.
   ``It's sad the entire fraternity has to suffer because of the
actions of a few, but the punishment is acceptable to us,'' said
Ishmell Edwards, dean of students at 925-student Rust College.

<HEAD>East Germans Scale Embassy Fence; Czechs Rule Out `Hungarian Solution'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Desperate East Germans today
scaled a fence surrounding the overcrowded West German Embassy
compound and joined nearly 2,000 refugees hoping to emigrate to the
West.
   East German authorities have failed to persuade most of the
refugees to leave their tents in the compound and return home,
despite difficult living conditions that were aggravated by heavy
rain.
   Botho Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, president of the West German
Red Cross, and Foreign Ministry officials left for Prague to review
conditions in the embassy garden and seek improvememnts.
   After meeting his East German counterpart, Oskar Fischer, at the
United Nations in New York, West German Foreign Minister Hans
Dietrich Genscher told reporters ``he did not rule out'' progress
in the refugee standoff.
   A Czechoslovak government spokesman, Miroslav Pavel, said today
that ``as soon as they (the two German states) reach an agreement,
Czechoslovakia is willing to provide comprehensive humanitarian and
technical help.''
   However, ``a Hungarian solution is out of the question,'' he
told Austrian radio, referring to Hungary's decision earlier this
month to open its borders for thousands of East German refugees to
emigrate freely to West Germany.
   By 7 p.m. Wednesday, 1,882 refugees were registered in the
embassy compound, but more than 100 people climbed over the fence
during the night.
   East Germans filled the grounds with hundreds in tents. Many men
spent the night in sleeping bags in the open air because there was
not enough room in the tents. Some adults slept on stairwells, and
three people shared one cot.
   In Bonn, a Red Cross official said it was impossible to pitch
more tents in the Prague compound. Therefore, the Red Cross has
sent tarpaulins to protect those staying outside the tents against
rain.
   The refugees included almost 300 children, including a
4-week-old baby, refugees told Western reporters talking to them
through the fence.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has returned 100 planes
seized during a 6-week-old crackdown on drug traffickers, a Bogota
daily said today.
   On Wednesday night, a powerful bomb exploded in a car as it
pulled into a suburban gas station, killing the man and woman
inside. Police said they believed the two were terrorists working
for drug bosses.
   The planes were part of 375 aircraft confiscated since Aug. 19
when President Virgilio Barco ordered government security forces to
hunt down suspected traffickers and seize their property.
   The National Drug Council decided that 180 of the aircraft had
been used in drug trafficking and turnd the planes over to the
Colombian air force, the daily El Tiempo said. It said 100 were
returned, and the council is investigating the other 95 aircraft.
   Two bystanders also were injured in the blast Wednesday, which
leveled the station in the northwestern suburb of Suba, damaged at
least 12 cars and blew out windows of homes within 1,600 feet.
   Police said the bomb contained 110 pounds of dynamite.
   Early today, another bomb exploded at a bank in Bogota, injuring
the night guard and damaging at least 15 neighboring shops, police
said.
   The two blasts brought to 43 the number of bomb explosions in
Bogota since drug traffickers declared war on the government last
month. The traffickers want Barco to negotiate peace and reverse
the government's decision to extradite cocaine barons to the United
States.
   Since the government began there have been almost daily bombings
and arson attacks in Bogota, the capital, and the drug trafficking
center of Medellin. Ten people have been killed and 140 injured in
114 attacks that have caused an estimated $5 million in damage.
   Late Wednesday, Barco arrived in Washington for talks with
President Bush about how to combat the drug bosses, who through
payoffs and intimidation of judges and police have until recently
operated with near impunity in Colombia.
   Earlier, he announced that his government had reached a peace
accord with a leading leftist rebel group. He reiterated, however,
that there would be no peace for the country's cocaine cartels.
   Barco is to address the United Nations on Friday and is expected
to ask more countries to aid the country's drug battle. Barco has
said Colombia cannot win the war without major help.
   President Bush has approved $65 million in military equipment
for the effort and, on Wednesday, Foreign Secretary John Major on
Britain told the U.N. General Assembly in New York that his country
would give ``substantial'' anti-terrorist aid, training,
communications and other help to Colombia.
   In a nationwide television and radio speech late Tuesday, Barco
said democracy was at stake in the fight against the drug cartels.
   ``This criminal organization wants to destroy the most precious
thing Colombians have _ their democracy,'' he said.
   The peace treaty with the M-19 guerrilla movement is a major
achievement for Barco. Congressional approval is, however, needed
for major aspects of the accord, which was signed at a guerrilla
base camp in the Andes mountains.
   The treaty calls for M-19's estimated 2,000 rebels to turn in
their weapons in exchange for pardons and the right to form a
political party. It also calls for a national referendum on 53
proposals, including land reform and programs to provide more
housing for the poor.
   Congress would have to approve a change in the constitution to
allow a referendum and any pardons. Barco said he will put the
proposed treaty before lawmakers next week.
   The peace treaty would end almost eight years of negotiations.
   Colombia's politicians and lawmakers are divided over whether
the government should pursue peace with the drug traffickers. Barco
has refused to consider negotiating with drug lords.
   ``The drug terrorists do not respect the sacred right to life.
They have threatened the press and they have trampled laws,'' he
said.
   Since the crackdown began, authorities have seized 1,056
properties believed owned by the drug lords, including mansions,
ranches and businesses, as well as 525 vehicles, 74 boats and 375
airplanes, Barco said.
   He said 10,800 people have been arrested and 535 charged with
crimes linking them to drug traffickers.

<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Ku Klux Klan chapter has applied to take
part in North Carolina's Adopt-a-Highway litter program under which
volunteers get a stretch of road to keep clean and a road sign with
their name on it.
   The Department of Transportation is considering the request from
the Rockingham County chapter of The Invisible Empire Knights of
the Ku Klux Klan.
   If it is approved, the state will erect a green-and-white sign
with the Klan name along the adopted highway.
   Rocky Chapman, exalted cyclops of the Klan chapter, said he
filed the application two weeks ago.
   ``I feel it's our constitutional right to adopt a highway,'' he
said. ``It isn't like I was going out here doing something
disruptive. We're trying to do something good for the state. We're
trying to clean up North Carolina.''
   James Sughrue, assistant secretary of transportation for
external affairs, said officials were studying the application.
``It is not a usual request and therefore it is not being handled
in the usual manner,'' he said.
   Sughrue said he did not know if any applications had been
rejected since the program began last year.
   Chapman said a local department official had persuaded the group
to change their original requested stretch of road because it was
in a heavily black area.
   The official told him he was worried that motorists would
intentionally litter there to make more work for the Klan, Chapman
said.
   Under the Adopt-A-Highway program, weekend volunteers from 4,669
civic groups, businesses and neighborhoods pick up litterl from
more than 10,000 miles of roads.

<TEXT>
   For three days, Estelle Ray searched
frantically for a generator to power her daughter's kidney dialysis
machine after Hurricane Hugo knocked out electricity to her home.
   Civil defense had none. Each time she heard about one for sale
from North Carolina to Virginia, it was sold by the time she called.
   ``I was real scared,'' she said.
   A generator was finally located Monday with the help of a
supervisor at a bank where another daughter, Wendy, worked. The
generator was working in her home Tuesday.
   ``It was a blessing, I mean a great blessing from God,'' Mrs.
Ray said.
   Until the generator was hooked up, Mrs. Ray had to do the work
of a dialysis machine manually to save the life of her 19-year-old
daughter, Nicole. Without dialysis, poisonous wastes created by her
body could kill her.
   Using the manual method, fluid had to be drained from a tube in
Nicole's stomach and fresh fluid replaced at least four times a day.
   Each time Mrs. Ray or Wendy changed the fluid, there was the
chance for infection.
   ``I almost died one time before and I don't think you could be
that lucky twice,'' Nicole said. ``I just thought maybe I'd be one
of the deaths that Hurricane Hugo caused.''
   Matters were compounded when the city's water system shut down.
   ``I said, `We can't scrub; we're going to have to do the best
that we can,''' Mrs. Ray said.
   Her luck changed when Wendy talked about her sister's problem
with her boss, Kenneth Richey, a senior vice president at a bank.
He rounded up a generator.
   ``I think that was good for someone to care that much about
someone they do not even know and someone who is not their
responsibility, because he never heard of me or met me,'' Nicole
said.
   Richey said he bought 30 generators to operate the bank's
automatic teller machines in Charleston and several other cities,
and he gave one to the Rays.
   ``Somebody's got to help her. You just do it,'' Richey said.

<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's Parliament today asked
the Supreme Court to urgently rule on whether the northern republic
of Slovenia has the right to secede from the federation.
   Amendments to Slovenia's constitution adopted Wednesday give its
legislature the right to secede and provide for strict controls by
Slovenia over the use of the Yugoslav armed forces in the region in
peacetime.
   They also pave the way for introduction of a Western-style
multiparty democracy in the republic bordering on Italy and
Austria. Several independent opposition parties have already been
formed in the republic.
   Anti-Slovenian protest rallies and state-run media in some
southern parts of Yugoslavia demanded tough action against the most
liberal of its six member republics.
   Slovenian authorities have repeatedly stressed they do not plan
to secede and that the changes only provide ``an added sense of
security'' for the 2 million Slovenes, who make up about 8 percent
of Yugoslavia's population.
   But Slovenia's actions have met with strong opposition in
Serbia, whose leadership advocates limiting regional autonomy and
introducing greater central controls.
   Enactment of the changes came in the wake of warnings by the
federal leadership that they ``conflicted'' with the national
constitution. There was even speculation that martial law might be
imposed in the region.
   Authorities dissuaded several thousand Belgrade students from
staging a demonstration today in front of the downtown federal
parliament building, university sources told The Associated Press.
   The students were demanding that the federal authorities ``take
all necessary measures to ensure the integrity of Yugoslavia,'' the
sources said.
   Belgrade radio reported a spate of smaller protest gatherings in
several towns in the country's largest republic of Serbia. Up to
50,000 people demonstrated in Montenegro on Wednesday, demanding
the ``toppling'' of the Slovenian leadership.
   Zarija Martinovic, a Serbian deputy in the federal parliament,
demanded that Yugoslavia's Constitutional Court immediately review
the constitutionality of the Slovenian action.
   But Marjan Rozic, a Slovenian, asked that the court also
consider all other constitutional amendments, including Serbia's,
which caused demonstrations by ethnic Albanians in the southern
province of Kosovo in March that left at least 24 people dead. The
changes gave Serbia more control over the province.
   Both proposals were accepted by the parliament, the state Tanjug
news agency said.
   Yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous
provinces, each with its own government and party structure. The
decentralized system of government and collective federal
presidency were devised in 1974 to prevent one republic from
gaining sway over the others, but it has resulted in an ineffective
government by compromise.

<HEAD>Rabin Gets Key Endorsement in Quest for Labor Party Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin picked up a key
endorsement today amid growing signs he might be able to unseat
Finance Minister Shimon Peres as leader of the left-leaning Labor
Party.
   Rabin, 67, a career army officer who served as prime minister
from 1974 to 1977, won the backing of Labor Party dove Ezer
Weizman, a former air force chief who is now science minister.
   ``If today the question would be him or my good friend Shimon
Peres to lead the party to peace and elections, I think (Rabin) is
the man to do it,'' Weizman said on Israel radio.
   Another Labor dove, Ely Ben-Menachem, also indicated he favored
Rabin over Peres, who has led Labor since 1977, should early
elections be called and the party convened to choose a leader.
   But Labor legislator Avraham Burg said in an interview that he
believed Peres would win any showdown in the party, even though
Rabin had more public support at the moment.
   ``(Peres) has a firmer grip on the party machinery,'' he said.
   The leadership issue is not likely to come to a decision unless
the coalition between Labor and the right-wing Likud bloc of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir breaks apart and new elections are called.
   A Labor-Likud split is likely only if there is a serious move
toward Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on the future of the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Labor favors returning land in
exchange for peace while Likud opposes any yielding of territory.
   Labor Party insiders said Rabin, who has been defense minister
since 1984, improved his standing with Labor doves as a result of
his meeting earlier this month with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
   Outside the party, Rabin has garnered the respect of
right-wingers by taking a tough line against the Palestinian
uprising in which more than 570 Palestinians and 40 Israelis have
died.
   ``Rabin has the best of both worlds,'' Hanoch Smith, an
independent pollster, said in an interview. ``By dealing toughly
with the intefadeh (uprising), he has won support from Likud and
religious parties while getting support from Laborites because he
favors a land-for-peace settlement.''
   Smith said a survey now being completed is expected to show a
continuing upward trend in support for Rabin, who has been
outpolling both Peres and Shamir since the coalition government was
created last year.
   Rabin, who served as armed forces chief of staff during the 1967
Middle East war, became prime minister in 1974 after Golda Meir
stepped down.
   He was forced to call new elections after losing the support of
a key religious party. He then lost the party leadership and
resigned as premier after his wife, Leah, was revealed to have an
illegal bank account abroad.

   A hurricane hit Charleston again, but this time
it struck only on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera as the Met
presented ``Porgy and Bess'' on the third night of its season.
   Director Arvin Brown, artistic director of the Long Wharf
Theater in New Haven, Conn., intensified some of the stage action
and changed the location of one scene _ the hurricane. On Wednesday
night, instead of everybody going to a rickety lean-to near the
ocean, they take shelter in Serena's room. It isn't as
fear-inducing for the audience but it's better dramatically because
it's more sensible.
   Michael Smartt and Priscilla Baskerville sang Porgy and Bess,
making their love story more real than many singers make it.
   They both made their Met debuts in 1985, in small parts in the
opera. Smartt's voice has intrinsic dignity. It isn't loud but his
words can be understood.
   Miss Baskerville isn't a flamboyant Bess. Though Crown turns her
head with sex appeal and Sportin' Life turns it by giving her dope
to sniff, this Bess seems to be her real self when she's with Porgy.
   Ben Holt, tall and slim, was Sportin' Life. He was directed
oddly, being intimidated by the matrons of Catfish Row in Act 1 and
acting rather adolescent. Singing ``It Ain't Necessary So'' in Act
2, he was an entertainer at the picnic, moving like a dancer. Only
in Act 2, singing ``There's a Boat That's Leavin' Soon for New
York,'' did he seem the suave Pied Piper of ``happy dust.''
   His voice was focused with an interesting, attractive timbre.
Oddly, in an opera in which events are large and not genteel,
Smartt, Miss Baskerville and Holt made this listener desire to hear
all of them in recital.
   Gregg Baker was Crown, almost the only cast member recreating
his role from the 1985 Met Opera premiere of Gershwin's 1935 opera.
Surely the Met has nobody else as suitable as Crown. Baker is built
like an athlete, tall and broad. His chest is bare a couple of
times, so the effect isn't missed, and he picks up Bess like she's
a feather. His voice is strong and compelling, too.
   Marvis Martin sang Clara, singing ``Summertime'' with sweet
clarity.
   Camellia Johnson sang Serena and Marjorie Wharton of
Philadelphia, a notable Maria, was one of 10 singers making Met
debuts.
   Mezzo Linda Thompson of Brooklyn and tenor Lynn Randolph of New
York were able to make an impression in the tiny but noticeable
roles of early morning sellers of strawberries and crabs.
   James Levine conducted, without flagging. He's conducting the
first five performances of the Met's opening week.

   A criminal justice student troubled by his
mother's illness and the loss of a college grant has been charged
with robbing a bank and killing one of his four hostages by backing
his car over her.
   William Troy McAlister, 21, of Shaftsburg, was jailed without
bail Wednesday on charges of murder, assault with intent to murder,
kidnapping and bank robbery.
   One of McAlister's older brothers, Mitch, said the younger man
had been under stress lately.
   ``Our mother has Alzheimer's and I left him in charge for the
last month and a half, which is hard on him,'' he said. ``He was
going to college and his grant was cut off. I don't know, he just
slipped.''
   Terry McIntosh, whose wife, Sue, was one of the hostages, said
his wife told him the abductor ``was kind of nervous and didn't say
a whole lot, but at one point he said he needed the money for
college.''
   McAlister was studying at Andrews University in Berrien Springs,
his brothers said.
   Police said a hooded gunman Tuesday took an estimated $50,000
from the vault at a bank and took four bank employees hostage as
they arrived for work.
   The gunman then forced the four to drive in two cars about 70
miles, ordered them to lie side-by-side in a field and backed his
car over them, hitting two women while another woman and a man
escaped, police said.
   He shot at the escaping pair but missed.
   One woman was killed. Another was in stable condition with a cut
on her scalp.
   McAlister was arrested hours later at a roadblock. Police said
they spotted money in his car and found a diagram of the bank and
notes on bank procedures at the home of his mother, Catherine G.
Wells, where he had been staying.

<TEXT>
   Poland's new non-communist-led government is
getting warm words of encouragement from President Bush and other
Western leaders but few promises of fresh aid in the country's
historic economic transformation from state control to free
enterprise.
   Polish Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, warning of
``potentially explosive social conditions,'' appealed to Western
democracies Wednesday for $1.5 billion to maintain essential
imports and stabilize its currency.
   ``We must do more,'' agreed President Bush, speaking at the
annual meetings of the World Bank and the 152-nation International
Monetary Fund.
   However, Bush mentioned no specific figure for U.S. help beyond
the $219 million in food and economic aid already pledged. He told
reporters later the amount of aid hinged on the details of Poland's
reform package.
   ``We want to work with them in every way we can, but I think
it's important to see what their plan is for economic reform,'' the
president said.
   The IMF and World Bank, international lending agencies
established 44 years ago to foster economic stability and
development, are wrapping up their annual meetings today.
   Delegates have been discussing a wide variety of topics in
addition to Eastern Europe, ranging from the Third World's crushing
$1.3 trillion debt burden, environmental problems such as the
global warming trend and efforts to reduce the U.S. trade deficit
by stabilizing currency exchange rates among the major industrial
nations.
   World Bank President Barber B. Conable today said his
organization, before deciding on when to resume lending to China,
will look closely at the outcome of a conference next month at
which Chinese leaders will decide on the country's economic program
for the next three years.
   ``Coming out of that will be interesting signals about their
intention of moving ahead with economic reform,'' he said at a news
conference.
   The World Bank in June held up $780 million in loans to China
following the massacre of student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square
and the imposition of martial law.
   In a development on the Latin debt problem, Argentine President
Carlos Menem, who met with Bush at the White House on Wednesday,
announced that his country had reached agreement clearing the way
for an IMF loan. Argentina is the third largest debtor in the
developing world with $60 billion owed. IMF officials said $1.4
billion would be disbursed through 1990.
   Balcerowicz has been busy drumming up support for his government
with an address to the IMF and World Bank on Wednesday and with a
round of one-on-one meetings this week with world finance officials.
   The most senior Polish leader to visit Washington since a
government led by the trade union Solidarity came to power on Aug.
24, Balcerowicz met with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and
the finance ministers of Japan, West Germany, Great Britain, France
and Italy.
   Balcerowicz said, ``I would hope that results would be
forthcoming quite quickly.''
   He has been outlining Poland's plan to curb runaway inflation,
prop up the faltering currency, turn over state-run enterprises to
private ownership, encourage entrepreneurship and create a new
market-based financial system.
   To aid the effort, Poland is seeking two major packages from the
West. One, of $490 million to $500 million, is needed by December
to maintain imports of essentials such as medicine and fertilizer.
Another $1 billion is needed for reserves to stabilize the
faltering zloty, Poland's currency.
   Both requests are separate from Poland's effort to secure loans
from the World Bank and IMF. Balcerowicz did not mention an amount,
but Juergen Warnke, West German minister for economic cooperation,
told reporters the IMF was considering $700 million a year.
   Balcerowicz, stressing that his government's measures likely
will cause unemployment and other distress, focused on the urgent
need for foreign aid, saying the Polish reform movement's chances
of success ``would be considerably enhanced by ... fast, efficient,
substantial and sustained economic and financial support.''
   He drew immediate backing from Democrats in Congress, who are
rallying support for food and economic assistance packages for
Eastern Europe that total at least $3.7 billion, most of it
earmarked for Poland.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., called Bush's aid proposal
``pathetically timid'' and Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, said the ``administration's timidity in the face of these
opportunities is puzzling and dismaying.''
   Finance leaders of other nations joined Bush's call for aid to
the Poles, but they shared his concern that aid be linked to
changes in Poland. Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto,
West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Great Britain's
chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson, said Poland must agree
to a program of economic reforms with the IMF as a first step.

   President Bush will fly to South
Carolina on Friday for a firsthand look at the devastation spewed
by Hurricane Hugo, the White House said today.
   The hurricane, which killed 28 people on the U.S. mainland and
33 in the Caribbean, left behind upwards of $3 billion in damage.
   The hurriedly arranged trip will complicate a schedule that
already calls for Bush to be in Annapolis, Md., in late morning for
a retirement ceremony for Adm. William Crowe, who has been chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   To fulfill his commitment to Crowe, Bush will have to make a
pre-dawn flight to Charleston and complete his tour by mid-morning
in order to leave time to travel to Annapolis, officials said.
   White House officials flew to Charleston late Wednesday to map
out an itinerary for Bush.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush wanted
``to make sure that all that can be done is being done'' and to
assure the people of South Carolina the governor will provide
``whatever help we can.''
   Fitzwater was asked about complaints about federal relief
efforts from Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C. ``Hollings' job is to
keep the pressure on,'' said Fitzwater.
   The press spokesman said government agents were fighting
``remarkable odds'' in the relief effort.
   ``We think things are going pretty well,'' Fitzwater said. Asked
if Bush might help cut red tape that is hindering the cleanup,
Fitzwater said, ``If there is any _ yes. We'll take a look at
that.''
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell said planners were trying
to arrange for Bush to get of view of devastated areas on the coast
as well as inland. Possible stops include Myrtle Beach, Charleston
and Sumpter.

   President Bush today said he was
saddened to hear of the death of former Philippines leader
Ferdinand Marcos and offered his condolences to the family.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in a brief statement
issued from Charlottesville at the education summit, said:
   ``The president and Mrs. Bush were saddened to hear of the death
of former President Marcos. They offer their condolences to Mrs.
Marcos and the members of her family. For over 20 years, Mr. Marcos
was the leader of the Philippines, a nation that has been and
remains a staunch friend and ally of the United States. Mr. Marcos
agreed to leave the Philippines at a critical juncture in his
nation's history. His departure permitted the peaceful transition
to popular, democratic rule under President (Corazon) Aquino.''
   Bush, during a trip to Manila in 1981, five years before the
Philippine leader fled in disgrace, praised Marcos and his
government.
   ``We love your adherence to democratic principles and to the
democratic process,'' Bush said during his visit as vice president.

   A former top housing official was the key
figure to see for developers seeking federal grants _ even after he
left the Department of Housing and Urban Development _ former
regional housing officials say.
   The official, Lance H. Wilson, became the fourth former top HUD
official to refuse to testify when he appeared Wednesday before a
House subcommittee probing alleged influence-peddling and
mismanagement at the agency.
   As former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce did a day earlier, Wilson
asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
Wilson said he had been labeled a ``prime candidate for a criminal
investigation'' and said he was convinced ``the subcommittee had
already prejudged me.''
   Also on Wednesday, a former HUD staffer told of investigating a
project on behalf of a contributor to President Bush's 1980
campaign for the vice presidency.
   The Senate Banking Committee, meanwhile, resumed today its
parallel investigation of HUD during the eight years it was headed
by Pierce.
   Paul Adams, HUD's inspector general, described how HUD officials
disagreed with suggestions for tightening the department's troubled
coinsurance program, which used private lenders to handle
HUD-backed loans, and which has led to mortgage losses estimated so
far at $960 million.
   He said his recommendations in audits conducted in 1984 and 1988
were rejected by HUD officials as unfair and likely to discourage
lender participation. Adams credited new HUD Secretary Jack Kemp
with moving to tighten the program.
   But Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., called for a more urgent response
and denounced former HUD management for ``indolence in the
management of this program.''
   Alexander Naclerio, a former director of housing in HUD's New
York area office who became a consultant after retiring in 1986,
told the House panel Wednesday he paid Wilson $15,000 for help in
getting HUD grants for two projects after both men had left the
agency.
   Naclerio said he asked Wilson for help because he felt politics
were harming his ability to get HUD approval for the projects in
Puerto Rico and New York City.
   ``I felt I was getting the political zing,'' Naclerio said. ``I
called Lance Wilson and I related to him the story.''
   Naclerio also said Wilson called him in 1982 and asked him to
look into a project in Puerto Rico. Wilson ``indicated this was on
behalf of a major contributor to George Bush's vice presidential
campaign,'' Delio Rojo, Naclerio testified.
   The Washington Post reported today that HUD officials, whom it
did not identify, had said that an unidentified aide to Bush asked
Wilson to meet with Rojo about the project.
   The newspaper said aides to Vice President Bush said they made
referrals to government agencies without endorsements.
   Rojo' consultant, Carlos Figueroa, said he arranged the
Rojo-Wilson meeting on his own and probably discussed the matter
with Rafael V. Capo, an aide to the vice president.
   Wilson's refusal to testify made him the fourth top-ranking
former HUD official to refuse to answer questions before the House
panel.
   Deborah Gore Dean, who replaced Wilson as Pierce's executive
assistant, and R. Hunter Cushing, a former deputy assistant
secretary at HUD, refused to testify on constitutional grounds in
earlier appearances.
   Another former HUD regional administrator, Dick Eudaley of Fort
Worth, Texas, said Wednesday: ``There were a few people who could
make things happen at headquarters. One of these was Mr. Wilson,
and another was Ms. Dean. She depended on him for a lot of her
instructions.''
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the House Government
Operations employment and housing subcommittee, said he wanted to
question Wilson about a series of HUD projects he worked on after
leaving the department.
   One, Lantos said, involved a gift to Wilson from developer
Leonard Briscoe of a 15 percent interest in a $24 million Riviera
Beach project in Florida. While at HUD two years earlier, Lantos
said, Wilson had backed a $7 million grant application for a Fort
Worth, Texas, project that was pushed by Briscoe.
   ``I knew the deal was happening but I knew there was nothing I
could do about it,'' Eudaley said. ``The feeling within the agency
was that this project had the personal interest of the secretary's
office and Mr. Wilson.''
   Although he did not testify, Wilson issued a written statement
saying the Fort Worth project met HUD criteria and that he urged it
receive a ``fair hearing'' because ``he felt there was a lack of
receptivity to minority applicants in some HUD regional offices.''
   Wilson is on paid leave from his job as first vice president of
Paine Webber Group Inc.

   Vice President Dan Quayle today
called for all-out support for non-Communist resistance factions in
Cambodia to help prevent a comeback by the Khmer Rouge.
   Quayle declined, however, to say whether his comments meantthe
United States had been sending military assistance to those
factions.
   ``I don't comment on matters like that. But I want to reaffirm
our strong support for the non-Communist resistance. We need to
make sure that they have credibility, that they have resources,
that they can participate efficiently in a resolution in
Cambodia,'' Quayle told a news conference before leaving for
Washington at the end of his four-nation Asian tour.
   Quayle arrived in Malaysia from the Philippines, where President
Corazon Aquino said today she has accepted an offer to begin talks
on extending the lease on U.S. military bases. But she said there
can be no certainty the talks will produce agreement.
   Quayle said earlier he was confident the two sides would reach
agreement during the December talks that would guarantee the
``longtime involvement'' of the United States in the Philippines.
   The lease expires in September 1991.
   Quayle said that in Malaysia, he had conferred with the U.S.
heads of mission from Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore
on how to cope with the situation in Cambodia following a
Vietnamese troop pullout that Hanoi said was completed this week.
   The talks ``reaffirmed our view the Khmer Rouge must not return
to power'' and ``assistance must be given to the non-Communist
factions,'' he said.
   The fanatical Communist Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975
until it was toppled by a Vietnamese invasion in late 1978. It now
is the strongest faction in a resistance coalition that also
includes two non-Communist groups.
   With the Vietnamese troop pullout, the resistance is fighting
troops of the Phnom Penh government installed by Vietnam.
   The issue of American assistance to non-Communist resistance is
sensitive. Vietnam has called on foreign countries to cut off aid
to the resistance.
   Quayle said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and U.S.
positions on the Khmer Rouge did not differ, and both did not want
to see the Khmer Rouge in power.
   ASEAN, a major backer of the resistance coalition, includes
Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and
Brunei.
   In the Philippines on Wednesday, police hurled tear gas to
disperse 2,000 leftists demonstrating against Quayle and the bases.
At least 157 people were arrested.
   Quayle handed Mrs. Aquino a letter from President Bush
suggesting new talks on extending the bases' lease, despite growing
opposition among Filipinos to their presence.
   In announcing her agreement to the December talks, Mrs. Aquino
said in a statement:
   ``This only means that a panel, the composition of which is
still under study, will meet with an American panel ... The
discussions may or may not lead to a new bases agreement. The
Philippine panel will be guided by what we believe to be in our
national interest and no other.''
   In a departure statement, Quayle said he would personally convey
Mrs. Aquino's acceptance to Bush when he returns to Washington from
his Asia tour.
   ``I am confident that we will find a mutually acceptable
agreement on the future of the facilities in the Philippines,'' he
added.
   Any agreement on extending the bases' lease must be ratified by
two-thirds of the 23-member Senate, where opposition to the bases
is strong. At least 12 senators have called publicly for them to be
closed in 1991.
   Before departing, Quayle toured the battlefield on Corregidor
island, where U.S. and Filipino forces were defeated by the
Japanese during World War II.
   Quayle's visit was also marked by the killing of two American
civilians slain near a U.S. base hours before he arrived Tuesday.
Police suspect Communist rebels were responsible.
   About 40,000 American troops, civilian employees and military
dependents are stationed at the six U.S. installations, including
Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay naval base.

<DATELINE>HADDONFIELD, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The borough's Board of Commissioners
has ordered the community's only hot dog vendor to keep his buns
moving.
   Under an ordinance passed unanimously Tuesday, Steve Bodner must
move his hot dog cart at least 25 feet every 15 minutes and cannot
return to his original location for at least an hour.
   Bodner is the only vendor in the borough of about 12,000
residents, just across the Delaware River from Philadelphia.
Merchants complained when Bodner set up his cart, saying his
cheaper prices threatened their business.
   ``We're not against Mr. Bodner; we are against peddlers,'' said
Joan Aiken. ``The citizens of this town want no vendors, no
peddlers.''

<HEAD>Times: NASA Fears Dependence on Contractors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top NASA officials have questioned whether the
space agency is depending too much on private contractors and
risking loss of control over operations, costs and safety,
according to a report published today.
   ``I am deeply concerned over the continuing erosion of our civil
service capability,'' wrote James R. Thompson Jr., NASA's deputy
administrator, in a letter to federal Budget Director Richard G.
Darman.
   The letter, written after Darman asked each federal agency to
assess itself, was obtained by The New York Times under the Freedom
of Information Act.
   In the letter, Thompson wrote that the budget office's effort to
``convert more and more critical functions'' to contractors is
taxing NASA's management and supervisory abilities, the Times
reported.
   ``We've been stretched to the point where it's troubling to me,
given the oversight that's required,'' he wrote.
   Crucial parts of NASA's work are dependent on vendors, he noted.
   Thompson said bolts have been falsely certified by contractors
and that substandard or counterfeit electronic parts could have
created safety problems if they had not been detected.

   The chairman of the Democratic Party,
describing President Bush as offering the nation timid leadership,
called on the Republican president today to begin ``matching his
actions to his charming words.''
   ``It would be wonderful to have an American president seize this
time of change and begin leading the world again,'' Ronald H. Brown
told a meeting of the Democratic National Committee.
   The party chairman's speech reflected his earlier statements
that it was time to ``start taking on George Bush,'' and it
received an enthusiastic response from his partisan audience.
   ``Are we going to go forward with a public spirit, a commitment
to doing what it takes at every level of American society using
every American political institution?'' asked Brown. ``Or are we
going to continue the ethic of greed, humming the lemming-like
melody _ don't worry, be happy?''
   Brown attacked the Bush anti-drug program as ``big words
followed by limited action. ... They declared war and decided
somebody else is going to have to find the bullets.''
   The Democratic chairman said the first thing the president was
willing to fight for was a cut in the capital gains tax a
``massive, needless tax break to the wealthiest one percent _ a
giveaway that will cost working Americans billions.''
   ``When it comes down to risking his polling numbers, when it
comes to leading America rather than timidly following the
prevailing winds, George Bush hasn't come through,'' said Brown.
``Let's be clear _ for our country which we love, for our people,
and as a party, we hope President Bush changes his course and
begins matching his actions to his charming words.''
   The nearly 400 members of the DNC also were ready to roll back
part of a party rules compromise reached at Atlanta in 1988. The
DNC members also were set to require that they have a voice when
any such deals are cut in the future.
   As part of its attempt to become more aggressive, the DNC began
airing a 30-second advertisement on Cable News Network that
attacked Bush's proposal to cut taxes on capital gains.
   The ad featured House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.,
saying, ``George Bush wants to raid the Treasury by reducing
capital gains taxes for the super-rich. And he wants you to pay for
it.''
   The House is debating the tax plan and some Democrats are
supporting the president.
   The DNC members were poised to restore their status as automatic
unpledged delegates to national conventions, a role they lost in
the compromise reached between Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson at
the Atlanta convention in 1988.
   Brown was the principal negotiator for Jackson at that
convention, but supported negating that part of the compromise.
   Remaining intact was the decision to drop the requirement that
candidates in presidential primaries and caucuses must receive at
least 15 percent of the vote to be awarded delegates.
   The so-called 15 percent threshold was dropped at the insistence
of Jackson. But party officials at the DNC meeting were freely
predicting it will be restored for the 1992 convention.
   ``It can be done any time,'' said James Ruvolo, the Ohio
Democratic Party chairman who is president of the Association of
State Democratic Chairs.
   ``I think you'll find support (for restoring the threshold) from
a lot of quarters,'' said Ruvolo.
   In another look ahead to 1992, the Democrats were getting an
early start on choosing the site for their next nominating
convention. The list already has been narrowed to eight cities _
New York, Houston, Detroit, Cleveland-Brook Park, Seattle, New
Orleans, Miami Beach and Atlanta.
   The Democrats met in Atlanta in 1988, while the Republican
convention was in New Orleans.
   Several major cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco,
Dallas and Chicago, told the Democrats they wouldn't bid for the
1992 convention. Most cited the requirement that the party have
unlimited access to the convention hall for three months prior to
the convention. The city of Dallas told the Democrats that
requirement would force the city to cancel nine major trade shows.

   The Ukrainian Communist Party today ended the
17-year reign of one of the nation's last old-guard conservatives
and replaced him with a protege of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
in a competitive, secret ballot.
   In a meeting attended by Gorbachev, the Ukrainian party accepted
the resignation of Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky and appointed Vladimir
A. Ivashko, the Tass news agency said.
   Shcherbitsky, 71, was retired from the ruling Communist Party
Politburo on Sept. 20 in a move that cemented Gorbachev's hold on
the party, and Shcherbitsky's removal as Ukrainian party chief had
been widely expected.
   Other than Gorbachev himself, he was the last Politburo member
from the days of now-discredited former President Leonid I.
Brezhnev and was widely regarded as one of the most conservative
forces on the Politburo.
   Ivashko, the No. 2 Ukrainian party leader, was pitted in a
secret ballot against another party official, Stanislav Gurenko,
Tass said. It did not say what the vote total was, but it said
Ivashko received solid support from Ukrainian regional party chiefs
who participated in the balloting.
   Analysts say Gorbachev probably has been a patron of Ivashko's
for some time and that his writings indicate he is a firm backer of
the Soviet leader's reforms.
   Gorbachev's decision to participate personally in the meeting
showed the significance he attached to making the change. The
party's general secretary would not ordinarily be present for the
changing of a republic party chief.
   Two years ago Gorbachev went to a Moscow city party committee
meeting to fire maverick Boris Yeltsin, and he traveled to
Leningrad in July to retire that city's party chief, Yuri F.
Solovyev, who had been defeated when he ran unopposed for a seat in
the new national parliament.
   Ukrainian reformers blame Shcherbitsky for squelching dissent
and holding back Gorbachev's economic reforms in the nation's
breadbasket. The Ukraine, with 50 million people, is second only to
Russia among the Soviet Union's 15 constituent republics.
   Gorbachev waited until this year to challenge Shcherbitsky,
perhaps because of Shcherbitsky's personal power base or because he
feared an outbreak of Ukrainian nationalism or other political
unrest.
   In February, as the country prepared for its first nationwide
competitive elections in 70 years, Gorbachev made a five-day
campaign-style trip through the Ukraine promoting his reform
program known as ``perestroika'' and upstaging Shcherbitsky at each
stop. He met with leaders of a fledgling local reform movement that
has since mushroomed and spoke to workers in the streets,
encouraging them to oust their old-style bosses.
   Immediately after Gorbachev's departure, Shcherbitsky cracked
down again on protesters and political opponents, but opposition to
him grew. He was rejected three times when he sought nomination for
a seat in the national Congress of People's Deputies and finally
ran successfully in Donetsk, where he remained politically secure.
   The surface calm that Shcherbitsky struggled to maintain with
police power was rocked again in July when coal miners in the
Donetsk region, the country's largest coal-producing area, joined a
strike that began in Siberia to protest living conditions and the
administration of their mines.

<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection today for the
second time in seven years and laid off 2,700 employees, but
company officials said they were confident they could rebuild as a
smaller carrier.
   The actions came a day after the cancellation of flights through
the carrier's home base of Orlando, Fla., and its major Kansas
City, Mo., hub as rumors of the bankruptcy filing drove its stock
price down.
   All but four flights between Kansas City and two major Braniff
destinations were scrubbed. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at
many airports and many employees complained about being left in the
dark about the company's plans.
   ``The company has suffered a liquidity problem as a result of a
delay in completing recently announced financing and a softening of
airline traffic and yields in recent months,'' said William G.
McGee, chairman, president and chief executive officer.
   Braniff sought protection from creditors to allow it to
reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code at about 2
a.m. in Orlando, where lawyers took the petition to a judge's home,
said Don McGuire, an airline spokesman.
   ``We expect to operate four flight segments, that's non-stop
services, between two cities today and we want to raise that to
more than 40 by Monday,'' McGuire said. ``We'll gradually expand
the service.''
   Today's flights will be between Kansas City and Orlando and
Kansas City and Dallas, the company said.
   The airline said it is reducing the number of cities it serves
from 36 to 11. The 11 are: San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco,
Phoenix, Dallas, Chicago, Kansas City, Orlando, New York (La
Guardia), Newark, N.J., and Washington, D.C. (National).
   Braniff lost $31.8 million on revenue of $293 million in the
first six months of the year.
   ``Our goals are to operate a smaller and efficient airline,''
said McGuire.
   The layoffs were beginning today, reducing the payroll to about
2,000 employees. The company's work force includes an estimated
2,000 employees in Kansas City, 1,165 in Orlando and 450 in Dallas.
   Braniff also extended the expiration date of issued tickets
until Sept. 27, 1990.
   McGee said the company was confident there will be a place in
the U.S. travel market for the type of small carrier Braniff will
be when it emerges from Chapter 11.
   ``In the current airline environment, major airlines enjoy a
distinct competitive advantage over smaller carriers in the use of
their computer reservations systems, frequent flier programs,
pricing, and control of facilities and slots at capacity-controlled
airports,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, rumors that Braniff planned to file for protection
pushed the stock down $1.75 in over-the-counter trading to $3.125 a
share.
   The airline issued a terse statement late Wednesday saying it
began canceling ``selected flights'' at 2:45 p.m. EDT and some
additional flights would be scrubbed later.
   Braniff had given no explanation for the action or the state of
the airline in general.
   The passengers were stranded at Kansas City International
Airport after Braniff canceled about 30 departing flights, airport
administrator Del Karmeier said. The airline put some passengers on
other flights, he said.
   ``It's mad, just mad,'' said Andrew Meyer of Houston, who was
among those stranded.
   Braniff filed for Chapter 11 protection in 1982 with nearly $1
billion in debts, the first major casualty of deregulation of the
domestic airline industry begun four years earlier. It emerged from
bankruptcy protection and started flying again in 1984 as a
low-cost, no-frills carrier. Last May, it moved its headquarters
from Dallas to Orlando.
   Last May, McGee announced an aggressive program that included
expanding the work force by 35 percent, ordering more than $2
billion worth of new aircraft and constructing new maintenance
depots in Orlando and Kansas City.
   The following month an investor group led by PaineWebber Group
Inc. acquired the airline, shifted most of its flight operations to
Kansas City and began trying to attract more business travelers by
increasing its daily schedules.

   Marines on bulldozers cleared the path
for volunteers driving carloads of baby food, canned goods and
clothing into rural areas cut off by Hurricane Hugo. President Bush
today said he would tour devastated areas Friday.
   ``We need him to understand how deep the human suffering is in
this,'' said Gov. Carroll Campbell. ``I want him to know that it's
a long haul for us, and it's not a quick fix.''
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a South Carolina native, visited some
displaced residents today and chided Bush for not having come
sooner. Also this morning, Charleston's airport reopened to limited
commercial flights and the federal government opened five offices
to take applications for relief loans and grants.
   The White House announced the president's hurriedly arranged
trip after officials flew in Wednesday to select sites to inspect.
Bush, who has declared parts of the Carolinas disaster areas, has
been criticized for not responding faster.
   A congressional delegation, led by House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., also is scheduled to visit.
   In this isolated area between Charleston and Florence, officials
said that until the Marines arrived Wednesday, some people were cut
off from food and water by Hugo's 135 mph winds and 17-foot tidal
surge a week ago today.
   ``We're trying to get it to people,'' said Gloria Pipkin,
director of a relief station in Jamestown on the edge of the
Francis Marion National Forest. ``We found today a family that did
not have food for three days.''
   Hugo contributed to 29 deaths in the United States mainland, 18
in South Carolina. The storm also killed at least 33 people in the
Carribbean.
   Almost 18,000 miles of South Carolina roads were damaged or left
covered with debris, said state Highway Department Director Joe
Rideoutte. He said it could take 18 months to clean all the roads.
   All major roads in rural Charleston and Berkeley counties are
now passable, but some dirt roads remained blocked by twisted and
fallen trees.
   ``They're coming in cars, pickups, vans and tractor-trailer
trucks,'' bringing food, clothing, baby formula and diapers and
paper plates and napkins, said Bobby Hoffman, mayor of St. Stephen,
a community of 1,970, 40 miles inland from the state's devastated
coast.
   Hoffman said volunteer fire departments and churches have opened
relief distribution points and volunteers were driving into remote
areas to deliver goods.
   To speed access, about 400 Marines from Camp Lejeune, N.C.,
moved into Jamestown and McClellanville with bulldozers to clear
roads and bring generators and water purifiers for residents still
cut off from electricity and drinking water.
   ``I feel good to see them,'' said Earthale Simmons, 53, a relief
worker in nearby Awendaw. ``That makes me think everything will go
smoothly.''
   Relief materials have been flowing into hard-hit Charleston at
an estimated 20 to 30 tractor-trailer loads a day.
   Twelve food and clothing distribution centers opened Wednesday
around the 300-year-old city, handing out everything from water to
donated clothing and canned goods.
   ``The stuff is streaming in and people are pouring in to get
it,'' said Orlando Brockingtn, who was coordinating distribution.
   Many Charleston residents stood in lines run by National
Guardsmen and sailors from the Charleston Naval Base. In addition
to food and clothing, there were ice, disposable diapers, bottled
water, plywood and roofing nails.
   Jackson said he was to be followed by a ``Rainbow Coalition of
Mercy,'' a group of union, church and political leaders who loaded
trailers with essentials to be trucked into the Carolinas this
weekend.
   Jackson, who headed to the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico after
visiting South Carolina, charged that the federal government has
been ``too slow to move.'' He said Bush should ``not just come and
visit a house or two but to come with a plan and resources.''
   He suggested unskilled youths be trained as carpenters and
masons to help in the cleanup.
   Some officials said they could do with less federal red tape.
Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said the federal government
has been slow to respond to some aspects of the disaster.
   ``I'm not sure the extent of the damage from Hugo is understood
yet at the federal level,'' he said.
   Riley, full of praise for federal relief efforts earlier this
week, told reporters he has had to seek help from Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., to get more electricity generators.
   An estimated 233,000 customers in South Carolina remain without
power, more than half in the Charleston area. An estimated 50,000
Charleston residents remain homeless.
   Charleston International Airport, closed since Friday because of
water damage, reopened today to limited commercial airline traffic.
Seventy-five percent of the airport remained closed to the public
because of leaking roofs.
   Patra Bucher and her 7-year-old son, Beau, waited to take one of
the first flights out. Their Mount Pleasant home was still without
electricity and sustained severe roof damage.
   ``I'm getting him out of this situation, with no power and chain
saws,'' she said. ``We're starting to get real stressed-out. We're
taking him to his grandparents'' in Detroit.
   Hollings and Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., announced efforts to
get $1.1 billion in aid to the state. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency opened five offices across South Carolina today
to handle applications.
   Campbell announced Wednesday the U.S. Department of Labor has
given the state $5 million to hire jobless workers for the cleanup.
An estimated 270,600 people have temporarily lost their jobs
because of the storm.

   The Senate passed legislation today providing
$1.1 billion for Hurricane Hugo disaster relief assistance to
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, South Carolina and North Carolina.
   The emergency aid program was attached to a stopgap spending
measure aimed at keeping government agencies in business when the
new budget year begins Sunday, which passed on a vote of 100-0.
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., had said earlier that the damage
in his state was closer to $3 billion to $4 billion but getting
that amount would be impossible without triggering across-the-board
cuts under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget balancing bill.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said, ``I have never seen so much
damage in my life. It looked there had been a war there, and we
need all the help we can get.''
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., told his colleagues he had been
assured by House leaders that the amendment to the temporary
spending measure containing the hurricane relief assistance would
be quickly approved by the House and sent to the White House for
President Bush's signature.
   Thurmond said the Bush administration, through the Office of
Management and Budget, had supported the request for the $1.1
billion in emergency funds.

   President Corazon Aquino said today
the body of Ferdinand Marcos cannot be returned from exile for
burial because his funeral could inflame passions and create civil
unrest.
   But opposition leaders, including the vice president, called on
her to reconsider her long-held position in the interest of
national unity.
   In Marcos' home province, where he is still widely revered,
people wept when they learned of his death.
   Senior military commanders met after the death was announced,
but there was no sign of extraordinary security or of any
pro-Marcos demonstrations.
   One Marcos supporter, Oliver Lozano, said loyalists will stage a
symbolic funeral march to protest, but he did not say when.
   ``We consider the banning of President Marcos' return as an act
of unforgiveness and oppression because there is not a
constitutional and factual basis to the reason of President
Aquino,'' he said.
   Mrs. Aquino said in a statement: ``In the interest of the safety
of those who will take the death of Mr. Marcos in widely and
passionately conflicting ways, and for the tranquility of the state
and the order of society, the remains of Ferdinand E. Marcos will
not be allowed to be brought to our country until such time as the
government, be it under this administration or the succeeding one,
shall otherwise decide.''
   Mrs. Aquino _ who came to power on Feb. 25, 1986, after a
military-civilian uprising ended Marcos' 20-year rule _ issued the
statement within an hour of the announcement that he had died in
Hawaii, where he lived in exile.
   Marcos' death was announced after the close of the business day
in the Philippines, and there was little overt reaction to the
passing of the man who ruled longer than any other Filipino leader.
   Manila radio stations interrupted their programming to announce
the death, and news organizations were flooded with calls asking if
the report were true.
   Of three people approached on the street, one had not heard of
the death and the other two said they did not care.
   In the United States, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said President Bush was ``saddened'' to hear of Marcos' death. He
said Marcos ``permitted the peaceful transition to popular
democratic rule'' by agreeing to go into exile.
   Several U.S. lawmakers said that despite Marcos'
accomplishments, he left power in disgrace.
   Although she offered condolences to Marcos' family, Mrs. Aquino
also urged Filipinos to pray that ``we preserve the gains'' won in
the uprising that ended Marcos' rule.
   She had refused to let him return for the funeral of his mother,
Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who died May 4, 1988. Her body, which has
been embalmed several times, remains at the family home in Batac,
230 miles north of Manila.
   There, people mourned Marcos' death with tears.
   ``We are all sick at heart,'' said Gigi Nalupta, 29, by
telephone from the town in Ilocos Norte province. ``We loved him
very, very much.''
   The Rev. Ruben Abaya, the Roman Catholic priest in Batac, said
special Masses would be celebrated Friday.
   ``In the hearts and minds of the people here, Marcos is the
greatest son of Batac,'' he said. ``I can foresee great mourning in
the entire Ilocos Norte.''
   Shortly before the Aquino statement today, Vice President
Salvador Laurel asked her to consider her long-held position and
let Marcos be buried at home.
   Laurel, a leading opposition figure during the Marcos era, said
his death closed a bitter period in the nation's history and that
the former dictator's body should be returned from exile for burial.
   ``My family and I wish to express our deep sympathy to the
bereaved wife and children of the late President Ferdinand E.
Marcos,'' said Laurel, who broke with Mrs. Aquino last year and
organized his own opposition party. ``The passing of former
President Marcos should now close a painful chapter in our history
and put to rest all bitterness and rancor that have divided our
people.
   ``I know, therefore, ask President Corazon Aquino to allow the
remains of the former president to be brought home and buried in
his hometown with all the honors due a former head of state of this
country.
   ``Let us now strive to bring about national reconciliation,
which we failed to achieve during his lifetime.''
   Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile also urged Mrs. Aquino to allow the
return of Marcos' body. Enrile served as Marcos' longtime defense
minister but then led the February 1986 military mutiny that
triggered the uprising that swept Mrs. Aquino to power. Enrile was
fired as defense minister on Nov. 23, 1986, after a failed coup
against Mrs. Aquino by his followers.
   ``I agree with the position that the Marcoses should return
here,'' Enrile said in a radio interview. ``I am calling on the
president to allow him to return. This would give people who
believed in the former president to give his due.''
   But Senate President Jovito Salonga, a longtime Marcos opponent,
said he will support Mrs. Aquino's decision. Salonga also said he
would ``pray for the repose of the soul and condole with all the
members of his family.''
   In her statement, Mrs. Aquino said Marcos ``touched the life of
every Filipino who was his contemprary as no other Filipino leader
did before him.''
   ``His rule changed our country,'' she said. ``In what ways he
changed it, I leave for now to others and ultimately to history to
describe. For at this moment of passage, we must allow such a loss
to transcend _ for his family _ politics and history, and the
opinions of men and women. No one should trench on the dignity of
this painful moment in the life of a family.
   ``I personally condole deeply with the family he leaves behind
with all sincerity, for I and my children know the pain of such a
loss.''
   Mrs. Aquino's husband, former Sen. Benigno Aquino, was
assassinated in August 1983 moments after he arrived at Manila's
airport to challenge Marcos for leadership of the country. He had
been in self-imposed exile in the United States. Forty people,
mostly soldiers, are on trial for his murder.
   Mrs. Aquino has foiled six armed attempts to overthrow her
government and Marcos' supporters are believed responsible for some
of them.
   Sen. Agapito Aquino, the president's brother-in-law, said he did
not expect major disturbances following Marcos' death. However, he
also said: ``Let's not be complacent because anything that could
lead to a destabilization should be curtailed at the onset.''
   Jesus Valdez, a former commissioner of the Security and Exchange
Commission, said Marcos' death may encourage stability because it
deprived pro-Marcos groups of their symbolic leader.
   In his statement, White House spokesman Fitzwater said: ``For
over 20 years, Mr. Marcos was the leader of the Philippines, a
nation that has been and remains a staunch friend and ally of the
United States.
   ``Mr. Marcos agreed to leave the Philippines at a critical
juncture in his nation's history. His departure permitted the
peaceful transition to popular, democratic rule under President
Aquino.''
   U.S. Rep. Gus Yatron, D-Pa., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs human rights subcommittee, said any contributions Marcos
made were overshadowed by ``many years of dictatorial rule and
repression, which has left the Philippines in an economic shambles
and threatened by powerful Communist insurgency.''
   Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., a longtime former member of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, said Marcos was a ``true friend and ally
of the United States'' but should have relinquished power before he
was ousted.

   Mississippi's 5th District congressional
seat is being fought over by a protege of the Republican who held
the seat for 16 years, the state attorney general and a
hard-campaigning state senator.
   The seat became vacant last month when freshman Rep. Larkin
Smith, a Republican, was killed in the crash of a small plane.
   The candidates in Tuesday's open primary _ where all candidates
run in one race _ are Tom Anderson, long-time aide to U.S. Sen.
Trett Lott, R-Miss., state Attorney General Mike Moore and state
Sen. Gene Taylor, who lost to Smith a year ago. Anderson is
Republican; Moore and Taylor are both Democrats.
   Lott held the 5th District post for 16 years before winning
election to the Senate in 1988. Smith, viewed as a rising GOP star,
was sworn into office in January.
   If no candidate wins a majority Tuesday, the top two
vote-getters will meet in a runoff Oct. 17.
   Although Democrats control most statehouse offices, the 5th
District, which skirts the Gulf Coast, has been held by
conservatives since the 1932 election of the late Bill Colmer, a
Democrat. Colmer held the post until 1972 when he was succeeded by
his then-aide, Lott.
   Lott threw his support to Anderson, 45, his chief congressional
aide for 16 years. Anderson has roots in the populous Mississippi
Gulf Coast but has spent his adult life in Washington, where he
owns pizza parlors and rental property. It is his first political
race.
   Moore, 37, took office in January 1988, and also has strong ties
to the Gulf Coast, while Taylor is a two-term legislator who is the
only one of the trio who has ever run for congression.
   Taylor, 36, got 46 percent of the vote against the better-known
Smith in the November 1988 general election. Taylor has counted on
his name recognition to continue his door-to-door campaign style.
   Some people note that Moore and Taylor are both natives who have
stayed in Mississippi, while Anderson worked for Lott in Washington
and served a brief tenure as ambassador to Barbados.
   Moore has been criticized for wanting to leave the attorney
general's office after only 21 months. He is considered as
political ambitious as Mississippi's youthful governor, Ray Mabus.
   Taylor has had to contend with an $8,000 deficit from his 1988
congressional race and deep inroads into his conservative
Democratic support by Moore.
   The war on drugs has been a recurring theme in the campaign with
Anderson contending that during his two years as ambassador to
Barbados he was the Reagan administration's point man against the
drug lords in the Caribbean.
   Moore has countered that he was prosecuting drug dealers while
Anderson was in Washington serving as nothing more than Lott's
right-hand man.
   ``The only thing he pointed at was the planes as they flew over
loaded with dope,'' Moore has said of Anderson's service in the
Caribbean.
   Taylor has stayed out of the political ambushing.

   Kitty Jordan reached Nashville with a
name on a piece of paper in her pocket. She has stayed at a women's
shelter since then, making friends and earning the respect of
others. But who is she?
   Kitty Jordan was the name on the paper, but she's not sure who
she is. Doctors believe she is a legitimate amnesiac.
   Police have appealed to the public for help in identifying the
woman. With nine months of work behind them, they say they are
running out of clues.
   The woman, who is white and appears to be in her early to mid
40s, described her memory as ``bits and pieces.'' The black-haired,
brown-eyed woman said Wednesday she had an abusive ex-husband but
has no memory of children.
   She believes she is from Chicago where she worked in an office.
   ``I can remember driving into Chicago and seeing the skyline,''
she said at the shelter where she stays. ``I remember having been a
business office manager. I've worked with computers.''
   She is going by the name Kitty, ``but it might have been a
nickname,'' she said.
   ``At this point I don't know my Social Security number,'' she
said. ``I can't work without one or do anything. I'm stuck in
limbo. I have to do something to get along with the rest of my
life.''
   The woman is slightly overweight, has a Midwestern accent and
has a scar from a hysterectomy, police said.
   ``She's fairly intelligent and she's kind of neat to talk to,''
police Lt. Tommy Jacobs said. ``She does want to remember and just
can't.''
   Chicago police have no one named Kitty Jordan listed as missing,
he said. The National Crime Information Center checked her
fingerprints and determined she has no criminal record.
   Bonnie Grauman, assistant director of the Family Life Center
where the woman stays, said the woman is ``quiet and she gets along
well with other people who stay here. She has kind of a pleasant
way about her.''
   Grauman said the woman is Catholic ``and remembers teaching
Sunday school classes.''

<HEAD>Miscarriage Rate in Louisiana `Chemical Belt' Not Out of Line</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY COATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. GABRIEL, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rate of miscarriages in this section
of Louisiana's Chemical Belt is no greater than in any other part
of the country, Tulane University scientists said.
   The university's School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine
began the study nearly two years ago after informal research by a
St. Gabriel pharmacist logged more than 60 miscarriages by 50 women
over three years.
   One hundred residents attending a community meeting to hear the
report Wednesday night didn't like what they heard.
   ``I think it was a mockery. The pain we went through in this
community. The team wanted a sterile, statistical report. And
that's what they got,'' said Sandi LeBlanc, who had a miscarriage
in 1986.
   Tulane scientists examined hospital and doctor records and
surveyed women living in St. Gabriel, Sunset and Carrville, all
along the Mississippi River below Baton Rouge. The women had been
pregnant in 1982 through 1987.
   The river area between Baton Rouge and New Orleans is known as
the Chemical Belt. Dozens of petrochemical plants dot both sides of
the river.
   LuAnn White, a toxicologist and member of the Tulane team, said
there was no significant association between the proximity to
industrial sites and the miscarriages.
   The researchers said they were able to identify 372 live births,
seven stillbirths and 69 miscarriages among 354 women. Fifteen of
the miscarriages were disregarded because documentation was
unavailable, said White.
   The overall documented miscarriage rate was 12.7 percent of all
pregnancies, White said. She said that was comparable to figures
anywhere in the nation.
   Peggy Hoffman, one of those interviewed, complained that the
statistics didn't include miscarriages by those who didn't go to
hospitals and those under 18.

<TEXT>
   From his hiding place, author Salman Rushdie has
teamed up with his French publisher to sue a magazine for printing
an unofficial translation of ``The Satanic Verses'' illustrated by
sexually explicit drawings.
   Emil Malet, director of the trendy intellectual magazine
Passages, was quoted today in the daily Liberation as saying
Rushdie is suing the magazine despite the fact that it admitted it
made a mistake and withdrew most of the issues in question.
   Passages in July became the first magazine in France to publish
selections from Rushdie's controversial novel. It published them
along with drawings that Rushdie's publisher, Christian Bourgois,
called ``frankly scatological.''
   Forty-eight hours after meeting with Bourgois, Malet withdrew
the issue from newsstands, he said, and also removed 3,000 posters
advertising the issue. Only 5,000 of 75,000 copies were sold, he
said.
   Nonetheless, Rushdie and Bourgeois filed suit in July, asking
$48,000 for ``counterfeiting'' the translation without Rushdie's
authorization. A hearing is set for Oct. 4.
   The publisher and Rushdie found offensive the magazine's
headline _ ``Explosive _ The Prophet's Satanic Women, Rushdie's
Erotics,'' _ as well as the drawings by illustrator Willem.
   Malet said that by filing suit, Rushdie and Bourgois were trying
to kill the magazine.
   ``Does Rushdie want our death?'' Malet was quoted as telling the
leftist French daily Liberation. ``We have no money, if we're
convicted, we'll go bankrupt.''
   Malet said the magazine has more than made up for its mistake by
withdrawing the offensive material from circulation and later
publishing an editorial admitting ``we had made an error.''
   ``No Moslem association has complained, and the book, published
by Christian Bourgois has sold very well. What's more, we defended
Rushdie, whom we compared to Voltaire,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Bourgois was not available for comment.
   In February, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called on Moslems
worldwide to kill Rushdie because, he said, ``The Satanic Verses''
blasphemed Islam.
   After Rushdie was threatened and Islamic clerics placed a
multimillion dollar bounty on his head, Bourgois suspended
publication of the work in French from February until July.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' is now No. nine on the best-seller list
in France.

   The chief neurosurgeon of Cyprus' main
hospital was summoned urgently to operate on the broken skull of a
three-foot sea turtle, the Cyprus Mail reported Thursday.
   The English-language daily said the female turtle was found
floating in the water off the east coast with its skull broken,
apparently hit by a propeller.
   The injured turtle was taken to the government fisheries
department. Its director, Andreas Demetropoulos, said he took it to
the Nicosia General Hospital ``for specialized brain surgery since
she had been bashed on the head.''
   Dr. Nicos Spanos said he performed a 45-minute operation on the
turtle.
   ``It was not a difficult operation, but undeniably an
interesting one,'' said Spanos.
   The turtle was recuperating at a fisheries department turtle
hatchery near Paphos on the west coast of this east Mediterranean
island.
   ``She seems to be very well,'' Demetropoulos said.

   Prosecutors Thursday demanded death
sentences for three radical students on trial for the deaths of
seven riot police killed during an anti-government demonstration.
   Six other students charged in the case should receive life in
prison, the prosecution said in the trial at Pusan District
Criminal Court in the southern port city of Pusan.
   The proceedings were briefly disrupted when tear gas was
scattered in the court.
   The defendants are charged in the fiery deaths of seven riot
police who stormed the library at Dongui University on May 3 to try
to free five policemen held hostage by radical students.
   Students set a library hall on fire, leaving the seven police
officers in a fire trap. The five hostages were freed.
   So far, 71 Dongui students have been indicted on various charges
in connection with the incident, which resulted in a police
crackdown on campus protests and the arrests of hundreds of radical
students.
   Radical students are a small but vocal minority in South Korea.
Their demands include the withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S. troops in
South Korea and reunification of North and South Korea.

   Hundreds of riot police armed with
tear gas took control of a prison in southern France on Thursday
after a night of rioting by inmates protesting prison conditions,
police said.
   Prisoners offered no resistence when about 400 police entered
the jail at 7:45 a.m. and ordered the inmates back to their cells,
according to police.
   Calm was restored within 45 minutes.
   The rioting occurred during a strike by prison guards, who are
demanding higher wages. About 200 prisoners trashed cells, burned
beds and climbed on the roof to protest conditions and the
disruption of visiting schedules caused by the strike.
   Tension is said to be high in many of the country's 180 prisons.
Union officials say guards are on strike in about 70 of them.

   Two U.S. Army pilots were rescued unhurt
from the Persian Gulf after their small helicopter crashed during a
night patrol exercise, the Navy said Thursday.
   The OH-58D helicopter was operating from the missile frigate USS
Rentz when the crash occurred, 65 miles northeast of Bahrain about
10 p.m. Wednesday, said Petty Officer Joseph Bartlett, spokesman
for the Navy's gulf-based force.
   A Navy helicopter from the Rentz recovered the two pilots, whose
identities were withheld.
   The Army helicopters, part of a special operations unit based at
Fort Bragg, N.C., are equipped to fly in darkness with little noise.
   They were brought to the gulf in 1987 to augment Navy protection
of U.S.-flagged shipping during the Iran-Iraq war. Most were
withdrawn after a cease-fire in August last year.
   Bartlett said two U.S. mine sweepers were ordered to the crash
scene to help determine whether the wreckage could be raised from
about 230 feet of water.
   He said the cause of the crash was not known, adding that there
were no indications of trouble before the craft hit the water.

<TEXT>
   The government today announced a plan for
expanded distribution of a drug that appears to be effective in
stopping replication of the AIDS virus.
   The plan for wider distribution of dideoxyinosine, or ddI, marks
the first time the Food and Drug Administration has agreed to make
such an experimental drug so widely available so early in testing,
the FDA said.
   Under the plan, ddI would be available to about 2,600 people
with AIDS or AIDS related complex in controlled clinical trials to
test the effectiveness of the drug against zidovudine, known as AZT.
   The plan also would make ddI available to people with AIDS or
advanced AIDS related complex who cannot take AZT, the only
FDA-approved drug that directly combats the AIDS virus, and those
for whom the disease is progressing despite AZT and who have no
other treatment options.
   Bristol-Myers, which holds the license to manufacture ddI, has
said it will distribute the drug at no cost under the plan.
   The plan is ``an interim measure to make a promising
investigational therapy available for people with AIDS who do not
have satisfactory treatment options,'' the Department of Health and
Human Services said in its announcement.
   HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan said the plan ``reaffirms our
commitment to speeding both the development and the availability of
promising new drugs for patients with AIDS whenever possible.''
   AIDS activists also applauded the department's action. Mark
Harrington of the New York-based AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power,
or ACT-UP, said: ``This is the start of something we've been
working for for a long time ... Let's use this as a good precedent
and build on it.''
   The plan is the first demonstration of a concept that has been
under consideration by officials at the Public Health Service, an
HHS division that includes the FDA and the National Institutes of
Health, to make promising AIDS drugs available to more people
earlier during testing.
   They have called the concept ``parallel track,'' meaning that a
drug would be made available to people with AIDS in clinical trials
as well as to those who cannot participate in the trials.
   The first phase of clinical trials, during which dosage is
examined, have been completed on ddI by the National Cancer
Institute and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases.
   ``These studies showed that, while ddI appears promising, it has
toxicities related to the dose taken; thus, its use requires
careful monitoring,'' the department said in its announcement.
   The drug has sparked great expectations among people with AIDS,
partly because earlier studies on the drug showed it could be
tolerated by most AIDS patients with less servere side effects as
those associated with AZT.
   However, more recent data indicates that some patients taking
higher doses of ddI have experienced painful nerve damage to the
feet and damage to the pancreas. These side effects appear to be
reversible if they are detected early and the drug is stopped, the
department said.
   The department also cautioned: ``Despite the promising early
results with ddI, it is important to emphasize that zidovudine
(AZT) is the only drug with proven efficacy for the treatment of
patients with AIDS and advanced ARC (AIDS related complex).''
   The second phase of clinical trials are scheduled to begin soon
under the plan. These studies are intended to provide more data on
whether the drug is safe and effective.
   The department also said that while Bristol-Myers is not
charging for the cost of the drugs, people receiving it are likely
to incur charges for costs of physician and laboratory costs.

<HEAD>Officials Meet to Prepare New U.S.-Soviet Round</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet officials met Thursday to prepare
a new round of arms talks, in which negotiators will be under
pressure to get a treaty slashing long-range nuclear arsenals ready
for signing at next year's summit.
   Prospects for progress in the 4{-year-old negotiations were
improved by Soviet concessions at weekend talks between Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and U.S. Secretary of State James A.
Baker III in Wyoming. But officials on both sides also warned
against underestimating the work still ahead.
   President Bush said Wednesday the setting of his first summit
with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev early next summer is ``a
catalyst for moving forward'' on the draft Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty, or START. Shevardnadze told the U.N. General Assembly of
``realistic prospects'' for halving superpower nuclear arsenals by
the summit.
   However, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the Soviets are
modernizing their armed forces and still threaten ``the very
survival'' of the United States, despite Gorbachev's promised
cutbacks and pledges of reform.
   Officials met Thursday to set meeting schedules for the new
round of talks. The first full meeting of both delegations is
scheduled Monday. It is not known how long the session will last.
   START is intended to cut by up to 50 percent the land-, air- and
sea-based nuclear missiles with which each superpower can strike
the other. Both sides have already agreed to lowered ceilings of
missiles, bombers and nuclear warheads.
   Yuri Nazarkin, chief Soviet negotiator in Geneva, said he could
predict the chances of early agreement only after Washington
formally responds at the bargaining table to the recent Soviet
moves.
   Shevardnadze removed a long-standing obstacle by announcing
Moscow would no longer let its objections to U.S. plans for
space-based missile defenses block signing of a START pact. Moscow
also agreed to a U.S. demand for dealing with sea-based cruise
missiles outside START.
   The Bush administration earlier dropped its demand for a ban on
mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles provided Congress
approves funding for such missiles. The Soviets have such missiles,
but the United States does not.

   The judge at Jim Bakker's fraud trial
ruled today it would be a waste of time to take the jury on a tour
of PTL's former resort.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter also prodded Bakker's lawyers
to end their parade of satisfied PTL ``lifetime partners'' _ $1,000
contributors who were promised three nights' lodging a year at the
ministry's hotels.
   By midmorning today, 42 of the contributors had testified they
never were mistreated by Bakker. One witness said that he would
believe Bakker if the TV evangelist claimed he could stuff a man
into a water pitcher.
   In testimony today, George Tinker, a retired electrician from
Chester, S.C., said he bought a $1,000 lifetime partnership in the
unfinished Towers hotel because Bakker said it would include a
health club.
   ``I married a sweet young woman,'' Tinker said. ``To keep
abreast of my body, I lift weights and I walk.''
   Tinker said he was satisfied with his treatment at PTL until
Bakker resigned in 1987 and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who took over
the ministry, ``began to low-rate our pastor.''
   ``He began to say things I personally felt were untrue,'' Tinker
said. ``He was quite mean, so I quit going.'' Falwell had accused
Bakker of greed and immorality.
   Bakker, who is accused of cheating contributors of $3.7 million
by overselling partnerships and using the money to live in high
style, faces up to 120 years in prison and more than $5 million in
fines if convicted on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.
   PTL partners testifying for the government said they sometimes
were turned away when they tried to reserve rooms.
   Jurors have seen Heritage USA, Bakker's Christian retreat in
nearby Fort Mill, S.C., on videotape. But defense attorney Harold
Bender asked Potter for permission for the 12 jurors and six
alternates to visit the complex, which has been closed by a
bankruptcy court trustee.
   Potter sided with the prosecution, which argued that a visit
would be a waste of time.
   Arnold Santjer, who said he owned 76 lifetime partnerships in
PTL costing a total of $76,000, testified Wednesday that he still
has faith in Bakker. Santjer owns a ship-loading business in
Bradenton, Fla.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller pressed Santjer on
cross-examination. The 6-foot-3, 220-pound Miller pointed to a
water pitcher on a table and asked Santjer: ``If Mr. Bakker said he
could fit me inside that pitcher, do you believe he could do it?''
   ``If he thinks he could, yes,'' Santjer replied.
   The judge on Wednesday clashed with Bender in a hearing outside
the presence of the jury about the number of lifetime partners
testifying for the defense. Potter said his policy is to limit
lawyers to five character witnesses.
   ``We have not put up anyone for the purpose of specifically
being a character witness,'' Bender told Potter. ``These are the
partners, judge. People who have put their money into this
ministry.''

   Clerics led an estimated 7,500
blacks on an anti-apartheid march through this conservative mining
town Thursday, and police stood aside as part of a new policy to
allow peaceful protests.
   The demonstration began in the black township of Galeshewe and
moved into Kimberley, where protesters handed a list of demands to
police that included lifting the state of emergency and freeing
activists detained without trial.
   Marchers sang and danced and some carried the banners of the
outlawed Communist Party and the African National Congress
guerrilla movement.
   Volunteer marshalls guided the marchers. Police were present but
did not intervene, and no incidents were reported.
   Several dozen whites joined the march.
   There have been a series of mass demonstrations across the
country since President F.W. de Klerk announced Sept. 13 that
authorities would not break up peaceful protests given prior
approval by the government.
   Most approved rallies in the past two weeks have been peaceful,
except for some minor looting at a march last week in the
southeastern city of Pietermaritzburg.
   In Pretoria, police used clubs and dogs Saturday to disperse
some women trying to proceed with a march that was not authorized.
   The demonstrations have spread from the major cities of
Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban to smaller, more conservative
towns such as Kimberley, Oudtshoorn and East London.
   They are part of a nationwide protest campaign launched in early
August by anti-apartheid groups opposed to the system of legal
racial segregation that denies the black majority a voice in
national affairs.
   Under the system, the white minority controls the economy and
government and maintains separate schools, districts and health
facilities.
   On Tuesday, city officials in Johannesburg voted to open public
amenities such as buses and swimming pools to blacks.
   The African National Congress, the main guerrilla movement
fighting the government, on Thursday dismissed the move as
``insignificant.''
   ANC spokesman Tom Sebina, speaking from ANC headquarters in
Lusaka, Zambia, said the move would only be relevant if apartheid
were abolished throughout the nation.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor's trial for slapping
a police officer went to a jury, while her aristocratic husband
told reporters she deserves special treatment because she's rich.
   ``She's not going to jail,'' Prince Frederick Von Anhalt
predicted after jurors began deliberating Wednesday. ``The rich and
famous should be treated differently. They bring the money into
Beverly Hills.''
   Deputy District Attorney Elden Fox told the jury Miss Gabor
already had been treated better than the average citizen arrested
on charges of assaulting an officer.
   ``She was treated differently than you or I would have been for
the same conduct,'' Fox said.
   The jury today resumed deliberations, which began after final
arguments from Fox and defense attorney William Graysen and
instructions from Municipal Judge Charles Rubin.
   During final arguments, Miss Gabor bolted from the courtroom in
tears after Fox characterized her as a spoiled Hollywood aristocrat.
   ``She came to entertain you ... she craves the media attention
in this case, it is clear,'' Fox told the jury.
   It was Miss Gabor's fourth such exit during the 13-day trial
that has cost taxpayers nearly $30,000.
   ``I want to get out of here. I want to go to Europe,'' Miss
Gabor said in the hallway.
   As a misdemeanor defendant, accused of slapping Beverly Hills
police Officer Paul Kramer, Miss Gabor was not required to be
present at the trial, except for sentencing if convicted.
   Also Wednesday, Rubin fined Miss Gabor $500 for remarks made in
a television interview Tuesday. He said the remarks violated his
gag order.
   In his closing arguments, Graysen characterized Kramer as a
threatening brute.
   Kramer pulled Miss Gabor over for expired registration tags on
her Rolls-Royce Corniche. As he checked for other violations, she
drove off.
   Miss Gabor slapped him after he stopped her again. He said the
attack was unprovoked. She said she reacted in self-defense when he
forcibly removed her from her car.
   Miss Gabor could receive 18 months in jail if convicted of
battery on a police officer, disobeying an officer's orders,
driving with an expired license and having an open container of
alcohol in her car.

   It's taken the devastation caused by
Hurricane Hugo to stimulate repayment of a 211-year-old debt
between two cities almost 1,000 miles apart.
   As a way of repaying a kindness dating to 1778, Kingston is
raising money to help Charleston, S.C., recover.
   After Kingston, then New York's capital, was burned in October
1777 by the British, New York Gov. George Clinton received a letter
from South Carolina Gov. Abraham Livingston. The letter included
nearly 1,000 New York pounds to help Kingston residents get through
their crisis.
   ``This money has been received for the charitable purpose of
alleviating the distresses of the now-indigent inhabitants of the
town of Kingston, who by the ravages of the enemy are reduced to
poverty and want,'' Livingston wrote on March 31, 1778.
   Kingston Historian Edwin Ford remembered the letter when
Hurricane Hugo ravaged the Carolinas last week. ``I figured they
helped us, we should do something for them,'' Ford said.
   On Wednesday, a local Red Cross chapter began collecting
donations for victims of the hurricane.
   ``A lot of people have been calling, asking to send donations
down there,'' said Susan Lawlor, executive director of the Ulster
County Chapter of the Red Cross.
   On Tuesday, New York state sent two airplanes full of food,
clothing and water to parts of the Caribbean ravaged by Hugo. A New
York National Guard C-5A cargo plane also left Tuesday to pick up
equipment in Mississippi and take it to Puerto Rico.
   Another cargo plane was scheduled to leave Stewart Air Force
Base in Newburgh, taking 70 tons of food, water and other supplies
to Puerto Rico.

   Colombian President Virgilio Barco assured the
United States today it had properly shaped its emergency military
aid to help his government battle drug traffickers, but he sought
more help on the economic and trade fronts, according to drug
control policy director William J. Bennett.
   The administration is weighing options for assisting Colombia
economically while it battles the traffickers. U.S. officials have
said trade concessions are being considered for some Colombian
exports such as cut flowers and textiles, among other products.
Another possibility is providing inducements for U.S. private
investment in Colombia.
   ``President Barco talked about an array of things,'' including
trade issues such as coffee and flowers, Bennett said, adding that
he referred the matters to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills,
with whom Barco was to meet later today.
   ``A number of these things we'll take up again later at a
meeting at the White House'' with President Bush, Bennett said
after the hour-long meeting with Barco and Colombian Gen. Guillermo
Munoz Sanabria that was held under tight security at the Colombian
ambassador's residence.
   During the meeting, the officials discussed the current
situation in Colombia, where Barco ordered emergency measures to
crack down on drug traffickers following the Aug. 18 assassination
of leading presidential candidate Luis Carlos Gala.
   Those measures, including the resumption of extradition to the
United States of suspected drug traffickers, prompted the
traffickers to declare ``total war'' on the government. They have
set off bombs around the country, killed several people at the
Bogota airport, and have vowed to kill 10 judges for every
trafficker extradited.
   Some Colombian officials have said the $65 million in emergency
U.S. assistance does not suit their needs. They have said they need
better police equipment to help track down the traffickers, while
the U.S. aid is primarily military equipment such as helicopters
and other troop transport vehicles as well as training by military
advisors.
   ``I was reassured by all present that the assistance we were
providing was the right assistance, it helped,'' Bennett said.
   Barco, who is to address the United Nations General Assembly on
Friday, has become a White House favorite since his government
began cracking down in earnest on cocaine cartels last month.
   A report surfaced Wednesday that Colombian drug barons had
threatened to kidnap one of Bush's children if the two governments
don't back off their anti-narcotics campaigns.
   Bush said he won't be ``deterred by rumors,'' adding he has
confidence in the ability of the Secret Service to do its job.
   Bush's meeting with Barco was taking place against a background
of a U.S.-Colombian disagreement over trade in coffee, Colombia's
main legal export.
   Last week, Bush rejected a plea by Barco for a one-year
reinstatement of a coffee-export quota system that had been
beneficial to Colombian farmers.
   Colombian coffee prices have fallen sharply since the 74-nation
International Coffee Agreement collapsed in July after United
States pulled out in a dispute with coffee-producing nations over
prices.
   Colombian officials have suggested they will have an even more
difficult time persuading hard-pressed Colombian farmers to grow
coffee instead of coca if coffee export prices continue to slip.
   The administration announced several weeks ago it is sending $65
million worth of equipment to Colombia's police and military forces
to combat cocaine smugglers.
   Britain announced Wednesday it will give ``substantial''
anti-terrorist aid, training, communications and other help to
Colombia in its drug war. British Foreign Secretary John Major made
the announcement to the U.N. General Assembly in New York but he
did not mention a dollar amount.
   Before leaving for Washington, Barco told Colombians that
democracy was at stake in the fight against cocaine traffickers.
   ``This criminal organization wants to destroy the most precious
thing Colombians have _ their democracy,'' he said in a speech
Tuesday.
   Administration officials said there has been a significant
disruption in the cocaine industry as a result of the Colombian
government's crackdown. The price of semi-refined coca paste is
down to $600 a kilogram, from $1,200 before the crackdown, the
officials said.
   Barco's visit comes on the heels of a peace accord his
government signed on Tuesday with the leftist M-19 guerrilla group.
   The treaty calls for M-19's estimated 2,000 guerrillas to turn
in their weapons in exchange for pardons and the right to form a
political party.
   The treaty also calls for a national referendum on 53 proposals,
including agrarian reform to give land to peasants and programs to
provide more housing for the poor.

   Out of view of sunburned tourists
sipping rum punch in yacht clubs, the inhabitants of the Caribbean
islands struggle daily with poverty and the vestiges of colonialism
in America's back yard.
   For many, Hurricane Hugo swept that struggle into view and
brought to the surface the bitter divisions of a predominantly
black society in which whites control the land, the jobs and the
food.
   From the slave revolts of the 1700s and early 1800s to
modern-day coups, revolutions, gang warfare and food riots, the
history of the Caribbean is punctuated by civil strife.
   This century, the United States occupied Haiti for 15 years
until 1934, twice occupied the Dominican Republic _ in 1916 to put
down a civil war and in 1965 after the assassination of Gen. Rafael
Trujillo _ and led an invasion of Grenada in 1983 to oust a Marxist
junta.
   Now, the Bush administration has sent more than 1,000 military
police to St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands in response to
widespread looting and virtual anarchy in the aftermath of Hugo.
   Tourists and other witnesses gave varying versions, but it
appears hundreds of people of all ages went on a four-day looting
spree after the storm battered St. Croix on Sept. 17. The National
Guard acknowledged that some of its members took part, and several
witnesses said police were involved. Some tourists said they had
heard gunshots and begged to be taken off the island.
   By the time federal troops arrived Sept. 21, supermarket shelves
were bare and merchandise ranging from toys to jewelry had been
cleaned out of the other stores so that there was hardly anything
left to loot.
   The disturbance shattered a veneer of tranquility that had
enveloped St. Croix in the years since tourists were scared away by
the killing of eight whites, including four American tourists, by
five black men at the Fountain Valley Golf Club on Sept. 6, 1972.
   In the Virgin Islands, which calls itself the ``American
Paradise,'' tourism is the No. 1 industry, with 1.5 million
visitors a year spending more than $500 million.
   Former territorial Sen. Alicia Torres James said reports of
white residents and shopkeepers arming themselves against
machete-wielding gangs of blacks were wildly exaggerated.
   ``I came out of my roofless house at 6 a.m. and, yes, I saw some
looting,'' she said. ``But people were taking food and things they
needed for their houses.''
   Others said the looting developed into a nonviolent
free-for-all. Adults accompanied by children were seen casually
picking through merchandise, and many gave their names to reporters
and allowed themselves to be photographed.
   Some feel it was the lack of police or military authority on St.
Croix after the hurricane that provoked looting on a scale that did
not occur in its sister island of St. Thomas or anywhere else in
the storm-struck region.
   ``I can understand people getting food and getting supplies,''
said Alex Pelovitz, 31, who owns a computer business and has lived
in St. Croix for eight years. ``But I can't understand people
getting lawn mowers and refrigerators and VCRs. It was more of a
party than anything else.''
   The disturbance was probably as much rooted in economics as in
racial tension, said Pedro Rivera, an economist at the Institute of
Caribbean Studies in San Juan.
   ``In a situation of survival more or less, if you're from the
poor group, that is one way of trying to survive,'' he said of the
looting. ``It was not an uprising'' of blacks against whites, he
said.
   Two-thirds of the Virgin Islands' 106,000 population is of
African descent. A quarter are from Puerto Rico and other Caribbean
islands, and migrants from the States make up most of the rest.
   Black resentment of wealthy white property owners and tourists
is pervasive in the Caribbean, Rivera said, particularly in
English-speaking former British colonies such as Jamaica, where
black nationalism played an important part in independence
movements.
   ``It doesn't manifest itself in terms of any overt act, but in
terms of the way the tourist is seen and the way he is treated,''
he said. ``It's sort of like a person serving the master but
resenting it inside.''
   Penny Feuerzeig, executive editor of the Virgin Islands Daily
News on St. Thomas, said race relations have improved in recent
years, but there is still resentment among native Virgin Islanders
against the better-off whites who freely move in from the United
States and buy up prime property and businesses.
   In particular, she said, unemployed blacks are offended by young
college-educated whites who come to the Virgin Islands on a lark
and get a job ``three days after they arrive at the airport.''
   ``It creates social strains with racial overtones,'' she said.

   Victims of a firing-range accident that
killed three soldiers and injured 23 heard the whistle of an
incoming artillery shell just before they were ``blown off their
feet,'' a commander said today.
   Two more soldiers were killed at Fort Stewart, Ga., today during
firing exercises involving 4.2-inch mortars, the Army said. Details
were not immediately released.
   In Wednesday's accident, a round from a howitzer overshot the
target area and hit 10 to 15 feet behind soldiers lined up in
formation on a rifle range, authorities said.
   If the artillery fired from a practice range had hit 10 to 15
minutes later, the rifle range would have been empty, said Lt. Col.
John Dobbs.
   ``If you had to write a worst-case scenario where soldiers are
injured or killed by artillery rounds out of the impact area, this
is it,'' he said. ``The round landed at a time when the soldiers
were in a formation and were in close proximity.''
   The cause of the accident was under investigation. Dobbs said
two possible explanations were that the howitzer was aimed
incorrectly or the wrong amount of gunpowder was used.
   Remnants of uniforms and helmets littered the ground on the
rifle range in the shadow of the Wichita Mountains. The site was
roped off and reporters were kept from talking with soldiers. A
crater a yard across and a foot deep was visible.
   ``They heard a whistle of incoming, a yellow blast and then they
were blown off their feet,'' said Col. William Gonzales, commander
of the post hospital. ``It's amazing what the power of a shell can
do.''
   Pvt. 1 Jimmy N. McCain, 21, of Troy, Ala., and Spec. Thomas P.
Boyle, 25, of Ventura, Calif., were killed, along with a third
soldier whose name was withheld until notification of relatives,
said Master Sgt. Michael Brown, a post spokesman.
   The injured were taken by helicopter and ambulance to Reynolds
Army Hospital. Six soldiers underwent surgery Wednesday night,
Gonzales said. He said one soldier whom he would not identify had a
leg amputated.
   Staff Sgt. Scott Harris of Rockmart, Ga., and Pvt. 1 David
Saltsman of Dayton, Texas, were in critical condition, and Pvt. 1
David Adams of Vinemont, Ala., Pvt. 1 Troy Emmons of Hubbard, Neb.,
Pvt. 1 Charles McCrossen of Mason, Ohio, and Pvt. 1 David Mechem of
Wichita, Kan., were in serious condition, said post spokesman Daran
Neal.
   Sixteen other soldiers remained in hospitals and were listed in
stable or good condition today.
   The soldiers were a week away from completing an eight-week
training course, said Staff Sgt. William Biel, another post
spokesman.
   Fort Sill investigators were joined today by a team from the
Army Safety Center in Fort Rucker, Ala. A preliminary report may
not be ready for a day or two.
   ``We'll review everything that's happened here and use our
findings to prevent future accidents,'' said Gen. Lou Hennies,
director of Army safety at Fort Rucker.
   The Army's Field Artillery Center at Fort Sill has three sizes
of howitzers _ 105mm, 155mm and 8-inch. Hennies said all three were
being used Wednesday and investigators must determine which was
involved in the accident.
   ``We have to analyze the craters and interview all the units on
the range,'' said Jon Long, another post spokesman.
   He said the accident site was about four miles from the
populated area of the post, which has 21,000 soldiers.
   The last fatal accident involving artillery at the post was in
1978, when a shell exploded aboard an ammunition-carrying vehicle,
killing one soldier and wounding four.

   A jury today began deciding whether the
``Night Stalker'' killer should live or die after a plea from a
prosecutor to ``face this type of evil'' without flinching and give
Richard Ramirez the death penalty.
   The panel on Sept. 20 found the 29-year-old, devil-worshiping
drifter guilty of 13 murders and 30 felonies in the crime spree
that terrorized California during the summer of 1985.
   The jury also found special circumstances that made him eligible
for the death penalty. But the panel could also recommend life in
prison without parole.
   Defense lawyer Ray Clark, acknowledging the horror of Ramirez's
satanic killings, argued that even if Ramirez was possessed by the
devil, he deserves mercy.
   ``I think it's inescapable that something was wrong (with
Ramirez) and we don't know what it was,'' said Clark. ``Let's say
we believe he was possessed, if there is such a thing. Then the
extension of mercy goes to the devil because he is considerably
more in need of mercy than anybody else.''
   ``Richard Ramirez ... has no claim to your kindness,'' Clark
told the jury. ``But if you give him kindness, then that's what
mercy is.''
   Deputy District Attorney P. Philip Halpin urged death in the gas
chamber for Ramirez, whom he described as ``a miserable human
being'' who killed for gratification.
   Halpin argued that jurors must not be afraid to confront the
evil of Ramirez' acts, and vote for his execution.
   ``It is very difficult for us, as human beings, to face this
type of evil, without trying to deny it, without trying to
rationalize it, without trying to explain it away,'' the prosecutor
said in a hushed courtroom.
   ``You have to look this case right in the face,'' he told
jurors. ``If anyone has ever earned the death penalty, Richard
Ramirez has. I urge you to vote for the death penalty.''
   The shaggy-haired Ramirez, wearing his blue jail uniform at his
own request, paid no attention to either lawyer, choosing instead
to chat quietly with members of the defense team at the counsel
table.
   Earlier in the day, Ramirez's attorneys announced they would
call no witnesses in the penalty phase of his trial because Ramirez
``didn't see any need to put his life on display.''
   Attorney Daniel Hernandez, who said he had 100 witnesses lined
up to testify about Ramirez's ``value as a human being'' and his
early life in El Paso, Texas, told reporters he abandoned the plan
at Ramirez's request.
   ``I felt and he felt he didn't particularly want to lay his life
out for the public and the court to scrutinize,'' said Hernandez.
``I wanted to give him the last grain of dignity _ human dignity _
and spare him that.''

<TEXT>
   At least 40,000 people linked arms and sang
``We Shall Overcome'' in this remote village Thursday to protest a
planned dam project that would wipe out farm land and forests and
leave about 1 million people homeless.
   Protest organizers said the participants, who traveled by bus,
trucks tractors and even on horseback, live along Narmada River,
one of India's longest and holiest waterways.
   The protesters joined hands and formed a 4-mile-long chain to
symbolize their determination to save Harsud and 572 other villages
that will go under water if the dams are constructed.
   Environmentalists, social workers, film stars and politicians
called for the project to be permanently shelved.
   ``We shall not move, the dam is our doom!'' the protesters
chanted.
   The rally was organized by the Save Marmada Committee, which has
spearheaded a year-old campaign against the Narmada Valley Project.
   The plan calls for construction of four major dams and about
3,000 smaller dams on the 805-mile-long Narmada River and its 41
tributaries.
   Environmentalists say the project would destroy an estimated
865,500 acres of forests, 495,000 acres of farming land and force
an estimated 1 million people to leave their homes.
   They also contend that some of the country's richest
archeological sites and oldest fossils would be under water.
   ``We chose Harsud to symbolize the protest because it is the
largest village that will be submerged by the projhect,'' said
Vinod Raina, spokesman for the Save Narmada Committee.
   Harsud, a town of 15,000 people in central India, is 15 miles
from the river, which originates at Amarkantak in Madhya Pradesh
state and flows through the states of Maharastra and Gujarat. It
empties into the Arabian sea.
   The government said it plans to proceed with the project, which
is expected to generate electricity, irrigate fields and solve
drinking water problems in Gujarat, which is often plagued by
drought.
   The government said it would provide land elsewhere for
displaced villagers, but most don't want to leave their homes.
   ``I don't want to drown in Narmada water and I don't want to
leave the village where I was born and grew up,'' said Bhure Singh,
a 55-year-old farmer. Singh's village, Mallan Goan, would be
submerged if the plan drafted in 1948 is carried out.
   During the speeches, youngsters went through the crowd seeking
autographs from film stars and other celebrities in the crowd.
   ``If my village is drowned, this autograph book will remind me
of this day,'' said 15-year-old Mavin Jain.

   A 68-year-old woman has pleaded guilty to
illegally collecting more than $50,000 in rebates from
manufacturers.
   Marie Haley of Uniontown entered the plea Wednesday to two
counts of mail fraud, and federal prosecutors agreed to dismiss
seven others.
   Ms. Haley was indicted June 6 on the nine counts for collecting
$50,609 in rebates from 1979 to 1988.
   Ms. Haley, a secretary for a coal-mining company for 50 years,
had submitted about 27,000 product refund forms using false names
and addresses and receipts supplied by friends and relatives,
according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory Nescott.
   The woman faces a maximum of five years in prison on each count
and up to $250,000 in fines. Sentencing was scheduled for Nov. 16.

   Ferdinand E. Marcos, former president of the
Philippines, died today, ending in defiant exile a life that took
him to the pinnacles of power and worldwide notoriety in his
impoverished land. He was 72.
   Corazon Aquino, who came to power in the 1986 uprising that
drove Marcos from his homeland, refused again to allow his burial
in the Philippines for the sake of ``the tranquility of the state
and the order of society.''
   Marcos died at 12:40 a.m. (6:40 a.m. EDT), said Eugene Tiwanak,
spokesman at St. Francis Medical Center, where Marcos had been
hospitalized nearly 10 months with kidney, lung and heart ailments,
pneumonia and bacterial infections.
   At 1:17 a.m., Marcos' son, Ferdinand Jr., emerged from the
hospital room and announced his father had been taken to ``a higher
place.''
   ``Hopefully friends and detractors alike will look beyond the
man to see what he stood for _ his vision, his compassion and his
total love of country,'' the younger Marcos said. He said no
funeral arrangements have been made.
   ``Father's not here anymore. He's gone,'' Marcos' widow, Imelda,
told about two dozen supporters outside the hospital room, said
family spokesman Roger Peyuan.
   The canny, combative politician, who governed at times as a
democrat, at times as a dictator, had settled into exile in
Honolulu at a hillside estate overlooking the Pacific. He died
under U.S. indictment on charges he plundered the Philippine
treasury during his two decades in power.
   President Bush, who during a trip to Manila in 1981 praised
Marcos and his government for ``your adherence to democratic
principles,'' said today he was saddened to hear of Marcos' death
and offered condolences to the family.
   Former President Reagan said, ``Nancy and I are deeply saddened
and extend our sympathy and prayers to his family.''
   In Marcos' home province, where he is still widely revered,
people wept when they learned of his death. In Manila, senior
military commanders met, but there was no sign of extraordinary
security or any pro-Marcos demonstrations. One supporter, Oliver
Lozano, said loyalists will hold a symbolic funeral march, but he
did not say when.
   ``I hope it can contribute to the healing process in our
country,'' Narciso Reyes, Jr., spokesman for the Philippine
Consulate at the United Nations, said of Marcos' death.
   In Washington, the State Department, noting the wishes of the
Philippine government, said the Federal Aviation Administration is
taking steps to prevent any flight from carrying Marcos' body to
his homeland.
   Marcos had been hospitalized three times since December, lapsing
in and out of critical condition. The family had instructed doctors
to take every measure to save his life, and life-support equipment
was not turned off until after death, Peyuan said. Doctors had
implanted a pacemaker on Wednesday.
   Peyuan said Marcos' son arrived from California just in time to
see his father alive one last time. Also with Marcos at his death
were his wife and Mrs. Marcos' sister, Peyuan said.
   Peyuan said Marcos opened his eyes briefly about 30 minutes
before his death. ``I think he wanted one last look at his son,''
the spokesman said.
   Of Mrs. Marcos, Peyuan said, ``She is holding up with great
dignity. They were still hoping to give him a more dignified end.''
She left the hospital without comment.
   Mrs. Aquino, who in May rejected appeals from Mrs. Marcos that
he be buried on Philippine soil, again said no after Vice President
Salvador Laurel asked her to reconsider.
   ``In the interest of the safety of those who will take the death
of Mr. Marcos in widely and passionately conflicting ways, and for
the tranquility of the state and the order of society, the remains
of Ferdinand E. Marcos will not be allowed to be brought to our
country until such time as the government, be it under this
administration or the succeeding one, shall otherwise decide,''
Mrs. Aquino said in a statement.
   Mrs. Marcos said in April she would embalm her husband's body
and display it in Hawaii until she could return and scatter his
ashes to ``fertilize'' the Philippines.

<HEAD>Moscow Lawyer Calls for Giveaway of State-Owned Housing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet socialism should get out of the housing
business and turn it over to a system condemned for decades as the
root of evil _ private ownership, a lawyer was quoted as saying
Thursday.
   The lawyer, A. Movye of Moscow, said in the Communist Party
daily Pravda that giving away millions of state-owned apartments to
their occupants would save the cost of maintaining them, make
people more mobile and save the hassle of selling individual
apartments only to those who can afford full price.
   Besides, he argued, people have already paid for the basically
shabby array of state-owned apartments through a variety of
indirect taxes. People also pay a nominal rent.
   Pravda ran Movye's lengthy article on its second page, under the
headline ``More Profitable To Give Than To Sell'' and with the
sub-heading: ``For The Agenda of the Supreme Soviet.'' It appeared
the newspaper was endorsing the idea, but it might merely have been
endorsing discussion of the issue.
   Movye's proposal came at a time when some members of the Supreme
Soviet legislature are urging that a measure of private property be
reintroduced into a system that has crushed most forms of private
ownership.
   A law on property is going before the legislature during the
fall session that opened Monday, and a group of reform-minded
deputies on Sunday endorsed a call for legalization of private
property.
   The group's leader, Boris Yeltsin, told supporters last week he
believes 10 percent of the property in the Soviet Union should be
turned over to private owners.
   Movye said economic reforms that include cutting unneeded
workers in a drive for greater efficiency are going to redistribute
the Soviet work force, and the only way to ensure housing in new
areas is to take it out from under central control.
   Currently, about one in five Soviet families must share
apartments. The vast majority of apartments are owned by the state,
are cramped, and rented for very low prices.
   A minority own their own apartments in cooperative buildings,
and in rural areas people are allowed to own or build their own
houses or summer cottages.
   A Kremlin directive calls for every Soviet family to have its
own apartment by the year 2000.
   ``But where should they be built? In what cities?'' Movye asked.
``No planning or other kind of agency is in a position to make such
an accounting in a huge country.''
   People will be more willing to move for work purposes if they
think they can obtain an apartment on their own rather than wait in
line for a state-owned apartment, he said.
   Movye, in criticizing current law limiting the rights of
cooperative owners to sell their apartments, appeared to support
the idea that people should be allowed to buy and sell the homes
the government would give them.
   The government now spends large sums of money as a landlord on
upkeep and staff for its buildings and could trim those sums from
its deficit budgets if apartments simply were given away to their
occupants.
   ``I think it is necessary not to sell, but to freely ...
transfer to personal property all apartments in buildings of the
state and social funds,'' he said.
   ``In other words, re-establish social justice and transfer to
workers that which by right belongs to them,'' he said. Although
people pay the nominal rent, they have basically paid the
government for construction costs with a variety of hidden taxes,
he said.
   The piecemeal sale of some apartments is no solution because
private and state ownership in government buildings is
incompatible, Movye said.
   He said the legislature should form a committee to deal with
Soviets who because of special privilege live in especially large
apartments.
   Movye also attacked the system of residence permits by which it
is illegal for Soviets to live anywhere without first receiving
permission from local authorities.
   While workers in virtually any country are free to move to find
new work if they lose their jobs, Soviets are tied down by their
residence permits, he said.
   Some radical lawmakers also have called for elimination of the
residence permits.

roof was blown off, windows and doors were broken and rooms were
flooded but the building sustained ``no structural damage.''
   He said the hotel would be closed for repairs until Oct. 16.

   Marcos had never given up hope of returning to his homeland. At
his 71st birthday party, Marcos told thousands of supporters: ``I
am no scoundrel. ... I will go back, I intend to go back, at any
price, without violence.''
   A federal grand jury in New York indicted Marcos, his wife and
eight others on racketeering charges in October. In April, a judge
separated Marcos from the other defendants, saying he was too ill
to stand trial.
   In an interview in November, Marcos denied he and Imelda had
drained the Philippines of billions of dollars and said he did not
expect to live through a trial.
   ``I'll take my destiny, whatever that may be, but I'm going to
fight for my dignity and honor,'' he said.
   A staunch U.S. ally during his presidency, Marcos said he felt
betrayed by the American justice system but held no hard feelings
for Reagan or Bush. Associates said he had hoped for a presidential
pardon.
   Marcos was elected president of his Asian homeland in 1966 and
ruled longer than any other Philippine president. But in his second
four-year term he declared martial law, under which thousands of
opposition politicians, students and other critics were jailed.
   Finally, in 1986, he was toppled by a popular uprising and fled
in disgrace. He left behind a nation of 62 million people deep in
debt and facing dual uprisings of communist and Moslem-secessionist
guerrillas.
   Once in Hawaii, Marcos claimed he had been tricked by U.S.
authorities into leaving his homeland, but Mrs. Aquino forbade his
return.
   Besides the racketeering indictment, which charged him with
stealing $103 million and using it to buy real estate and artwork
in the United States, Marcos faced lawsuits and investigations in
Honolulu, Los Angeles, Seattle, Washington, D.C., Virginia and his
native country.
   The Philippine government claimed Marcos and his associates
embezzled up to $10 billion and stashed the funds abroad, but it
never brought charges.
   Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, who once was believed to be the
world's richest man, was arrested in Switzerland in April and later
extradited to the United States on charges of helping the Marcoses
hide their riches.
   Marcos was regarded even by his enemies as a clever politician
and strategist who understood his people better than any other
Philippine president.
   The eldest son of a lawyer and a schoolteacher, Ferdinand
Edralin Marcos was born Sept. 11, 1917, in Sarrat, about 250 miles
north of Manila.
   As a young man, Marcos received the highest scores on the
national bar exam. During World War II, he claimed to have led a
guerrilla band against the Japanese occupiers of the Philippines,
but these claims were later largely discredited. His supposed
war-hero status helped him, at age 31, become the youngest
representative elected to the Philippine Congress.
   In 1954, after an 11-day courtship, Marcos married Imelda
Romualdez, a 26-year-old beauty queen. She bore him three children:
Imelda in 1955, Ferdinand Jr., called ``Bong Bong,'' in 1958, and
Irene in 1960. The Marcoses claimed another child, Aimee, as their
own, but she is actually Mrs. Marcos' grandniece.
   During her husband's tenure, Imelda Marcos wielded nearly as
much power as her husband. She was known for lavish shopping sprees
and was subjected to worldwide ridicule after the couple's ouster
when it was discovered she owned 3,000 pairs of shoes while
Filipinos suffered in poverty.
   As president, Marcos reduced widespread street violence, built
more than 60,000 miles of roads and 3,354 schools, and brought
electricity to thousands of rural villages.
   But he also abolished the congress, rewrote the constitution,
imposed martial law, jailed tens of thousands of opponents and was
accused of widespread human rights abuses, including murder.
   The pivotal event in Marcos' downfall was the assassination of
political rival Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr., who was gunned down in
1983 as he returned from self-imposed exile in the United States.
The slaying, which Filipinos blamed on Marcos and his supporters,
galvanized the opposition to the longtime president.
   Stunned by a mass revolt, betrayal by several key military aides
and pressure from the United States, Marcos and his family fled
Manila Feb. 25, 1986, leaving the presidency to Mrs. Aquino, the
slain politician's widow.
   After an aborted attempt to overthrow Mrs. Aquino in 1987 _ a
coup bid many attributed to Marcos _ the ex-president was barred
from leaving the island of Oahu without U.S. permission.

<TEXT>
   A pet bull named Fernando wandered from
a pasture and trapped five people in a convenience store for 45
minutes, until a veterinarian shot him with a tranquilizer dart.
   No one was injured in the escapade Wednesday, but it prompted
the owner of the 1,500-pound Jersey bull to make plans for his sale
next week.
   The 2-year-old bull hemmed in customers at the Country Market,
charging the building, gasoline pumps and denting a pickup truck,
said store manager Linda Eshuis.
   ``It was as scared as it was angry,'' Trooper Ken Van Kooten
said.
   Fernando broke through a barbed wire fence to escape the nearby
pasture.
   The pet's owner, Ishmael Gomberoff, was called to the store,
along with veterinarian Gordon Plotts, who tranquilized the bull. A
groggy Fernando eventually followed his owner home.
   Gomberoff was charged with allowing the bull on a right of way.
   ``He's just a sweetheart,'' Wayne Davis, an employee of
Gomberoff's, said. ``He's so tame when he's not around filling
stations.''

<HEAD>Frozen Embryos Issue In Divorce Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple who are in the midst of divorce
litigation are battling to determine rights to two frozen embryos,
against the background of a ruling in a similar case in Tennessee.
   The woman in the case wants them preserved so she can try to
have children.
   Joel F. Sacco, a Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Court
referee who is handling the case of Fred Wendel III and Mary
Wendel, both of suburban Chagrin Falls, said a pretrial meeting
Tuesday did not result in a settlement. A trial is scheduled Jan.
16.
   ``I have a feeling they are going to try and settle this case in
private,'' Sacco said. ``The parties want to keep it a secret as
much as possible.''
   He said he was going to review the Tennessee decision last week
involving similar circumstances, but said that case would serve
only as background and would not affect his.
   In Maryville, Tenn., Blount County Circuit Judge W. Dale Young
awarded temporary custody of seven embryos to Mary Sue Davis, who
wants them implanted in her so she can bear a child. He rejected
the arguments of her estranged husband, Junior Lewis Davis, who
sued for divorce and sought an order preventing implantation.
   Davis, 31, vowed to appeal.
   According to court documents, Wendel, 40, and Mrs. Wendel, 38,
were married March 15, 1974. Mrs. Wendel filed for divorce on Jan.
26, 1989, alleging her husband, a Cleveland lawyer, was guilty of
gross neglect of duty, extreme cruelty and adultery.
   On Jan. 27, she was granted a restraining order keeping her
husband, who moved out of their house Oct. 30, 1988, from entering
it, removing its contents or removing either of their two dogs.
   Wendel, who in a separate complaint alleges his wife was guilty
of extreme cruelty and gross neglect of duty, was granted a
restraining order keeping her from selling the home or its contents
or using credit cards in his name.
   On April 19 they agreed to temporary alimony in which he would
pay the mortgage, utilities and insurance and pay her $1,200 a
month.
   The embryos, created by in-vitro fertilization and frozen, did
not become an issue until July 11, when Mrs. Wendel sought a
restraining order to keep her husband from disposing of them.
   ``Unless restrained, the Cleveland Clinic Foundation will permit
the defendant husband to obtain or destroy said embryos defeating
her last and only chance to have natural children during her
lifetime,'' she said in an affidavit.
   Wendel, in a court document, denied the allegations regarding
the embryos.
   Wendel, contacted at his home Thursday, said: ``I'm not sure
everybody really understands everything about what is going on. I
prefer to resolve it as much as possible in private. I don't want
to make it public. I'll see whether there is a need to make a
public comment at some future time, but I don't care to make a
statement now.''
   Mrs. Wendel, reached at her residence, said Thursday she would
have no comment.

   A 225-pound convenience store clerk
foiled a robbery by sitting on a man who demanded cash, then got
three customers to take over while he called police.
   The clerk, who asked that his name not be used, said the unarmed
man threatened to kill him if he didn't open a cash drawer early
Wednesday at the Amoco Food Mart.
   ``I said, `Hey, hit the door,''' the clerk said. ``That's when
we started tossing and turning. Stuff was flying everywhere. Before
that, the place was looking great. I had just waxed the floor.''
   The clerk said the man, who weighed about 150 pounds, ``just
wanted to forget it'' when he found himself on the bottom of the
pile.
   Dewayne D. Rudd, 20, of Fort Wayne was arrested and jailed on a
preliminary charge of robbery, police spokesman Steve Engelman said.

   The damage caused by Hurricane Hugo has led
North Carolina tourism officials to change an advertisement that

   The advertisement, scheduled to start next month in newspapers
north of North Carolina, originally read: ``For Great Golf, South
Carolina Should Be Your Last Resort.''
   ``Those people down there are really hurting,'' Dick Trammell,
new director of the state Travel and Tourism Division, said of
South Carolina. ``We just didn't think this would be appropriate
right now.''
   The ad will be replaced by one that reads: ``For Great Golf,
North Carolina Should Be Your First Resort,'' Rick Myracle of
McKinney &amp; Silver Advertising told tourism officials Wednesday.
   ``Even though we compete with each other, the tourism agencies
in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and the other Southern
states have a good relationship,'' Trammell said. ``We'll fight
each other for tourists, but we help each other when we need it,
too.''

   Chuck and Charlene Staley moved out of town a
decade ago to escape city life, but now the city is coming to them
with condemnation proceedings to make way for a new airport.
   The Staleys are tired of fighting the bureaucracy and have
``kind of decided we'll settle with them,'' Staley said Wednesday.
   On Wednesday, federal officials presented a $60 million check to
Denver Mayor Federico Pena to begin airport construction.
   Denver has bought 138 of the 139 one-acre plots in the Arrowhead
Estates where the Staleys are the last holdouts. The airport will
take up 32,000 acres.
   Staley, a self-employed accountant, said he moved his family out
of the city about 10 years ago because he loves solitude and the
rural lifestyle.
   ``I just realized the other day that I haven't been to town for
two weeks,'' he said with satisfaction.
   Staley isn't sure where his family will end up, but he's sure it
won't be in the city and county of Denver.

   Staying out of your car in this Seattle
suburb can pay off.
   The city will begin next month reimbursing its employees who
carpool, use public transportation, bicycle or walk to work.
   Full-time city employees who use such an alternative at least
three days a week will be paid $25 a month. Part-time employees who
do the same will be paid $15 a month. In addition, the city will
annually reimburse employees for up to 40 miles' worth of emergency
cab fare.
   Kirkland officials say they want to do their part to reduce
traffic congestion in the city of 20,000. They also say they hope
their program, expected to cost up to $16,000 a year, will set an
example for businesses to follow _ on foot, of course. About 92
percent of the city's 230 employees ride to work alone.
   ``We feel it is a good thing for the city to take a leadership
role,'' said Andy Barton, assistant to the city manager.
   Bellevue, another Seattle suburb, has offered similar incentives
for its employees since 1987.

   Sharon Hope's business is picking up _ after
customers' pets.
   ``When I moved back to Tulsa, I knew I wanted to start a company
and so I tried to find a niche,'' said Ms. Hope, who lived in
Denver for several years before returning to Oklahoma several
months ago.
   Her niche is ``Poop Van Scoop,'' a local cleanup service for pet
owners that lets them have the joy of pet ownership without any of
the smelly side effects.
   ``It's probably not a job everyone would want to do, but it
really isn't bad at all,'' she said.
   For $11.95 a month, Ms. Hope will make a weekly visit and clean
up after one pet. Owners of more than one pet get a discount for
any additional animals.
   Her customer base has grown ``from just a few friends'' to about
50 homes.
   ``It's really not that bad. I use a Sanitary Scooper _ which
used to be named the Pooper Scooper _ and just pick up where the
dog left off,'' she said.

<HEAD>Defense Minister Proposes Cuts to Reduce Noise, Hazards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced Thursday it
is seeking a 25 percent cut in low-level flying exercises that have
been the target of national protests since a crash at an air show
last year killed 70 people.
   Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg introduced the proposed
reductions, aimed at cutting noise and protecting populated areas
from accident hazards, during a session of the Parliament's Defense
Committee.
   Stoltenberg told reporters later that the changes were worked
out in conjunction with the United States and other NATO countries
that have aircraft and pilots stationed in West Germany.
   One tactical training center involved in low-level flying
exercises is being relocated to neighboring Belgium, and
negotiations are continuing with other allies to export more of the
missions, Stoltenberg said.
   Of the 68,000 hours of low-level training exercises flown over
West German territory this year, only about 23,000 involve West
German air force aircraft and personnel.
   West Germans have staged noisy demonstrations over the past year
against low-flying and other military exercises.
   The protesters have accused the government of failing to assert
its sovereignty in getting NATO to reduce the number of disruptive
maneuvers, turning the issue into a major political battle between
the governing conservative-led coalition and opposition leftists.
   Opposition has intensified since Aug. 28, 1988, when three
Italian planes crashed during an air show at the U.S. Air Base at
Ramstein. Seventy people died when the flaming wreckage flew into
the crowd of spectators.
   Another crash, on Dec. 8 in the city of Remscheid, killed six
West Germans and the American pilot.
   Neither of the disasters involved low-flying exercises, but they
stirred up broad opposition to the foreign military presence in
West Germany.
   The leftist Social Democrats have been campaigning for a ban on
low-level training flights.
   ``A full halt to low-level flying would put our commitment to
the NATO alliance in question,'' Stoltenberg told reporters.
   Instead, he said, the ministry has worked out a number of
measures to address public concerns, including:
   _ A 25 percent reduction in low-level training flights over West
German territory.
   _ A 50 percent reduction of West German air force training
flights, already put into force.
   _ An increase in the number of areas off-limits to exercises,
from 25 to 61 densely populated municipal regions.
   _ A midday break in the exercises in summer months and no
flights on weekends and holidays.
   _ Reduction of maximum allowable speeds from 1,336 mph to 1,244
mph to cut noise from the exercises.
   As the measures already reportedly have allied backing, they are
expected to be approved by the Parliament.

<HEAD>Black Foster Care Children: An Uncertain Existence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A disproportionate number of black children
wind up in foster care homes because of poverty, abuse and neglect,
according to a study released Thursday.
   Such children are also unlikely to be reunited with their
parents ``in a reasonable period of time,'' according to the
report, ``Who Will Care When Parents Can't.'' The study was
conducted by the National Black Child Development Institute, an
educational and advocacy group.
   ``In our study, we found that the black child in foster care has
lived and is still living an uncertain and fragmented existence,''
said Clarice Walker, a Howard University professor and chief
investigator in the study.
   In 1986, when the study was conducted, there were 275,000 to
350,000 children of all races in foster care systems around the
country, she said. Black children accounted for 25 percent to 40
percent of the total; the numbers are approximate because of poor
record keeping, she said.
   The study looked at 1,003 children in foster care programs in
five cities _ New York, Miami, Houston, Detroit and Seattle.
   Almost half the children, or 49 percent, were age 5 or younger
at placement. Forty-six percent came from single-parent households.
The median age of mothers when a child was placed in foster care
was 29; of fathers, 34, the study found.
   Seventy-five percent of all children who entered the foster care
system were there because of abuse or neglect, the study found.
   In Detroit, Miami and New York, neglect was the No. 1 family
factor contributing to foster care placement; in Houston, child
abuse was first, and in Seattle, voluntary placement topped the
list.
   Drug abuse by parents was the second most prevalent family
factor in New York, Miami and Seattle, the study found. Half the
cases in New York and Miami reported drug abuse by parents.
   In New York City alone, 43 percent of the cases studied found
the children were unattended or unsupervised upon entering the
foster care system; 41 percent of the cases reported return of the
parent was uncertain.
   Sometimes the children themselves have physical or emotional
problems that contribute to their winding up in foster care, the
study noted.
   However, it found that overall, ``the proportion of
child-related factors contributing to placement was not very
great.''

   Federal investigators trying to determine
the cause of a crash that killed 10 people aboard a sightseeing
plane went today to the hill where the aircraft went down on
approach to Grand Canyon Airport.
   The pilot and co-pilot were among those killed Wednesday when
the de Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter veered from the runway into the
wooded hill 300 yards away, authorities said. Eleven people were
injured, eight critically.
   Tall Ponderosa pines sheared off the wings of the Grand Canyon
Airlines plane, but the fuselage remained intact.
   ``We were very fortunate that this didn't burst into flames, or
we'd have lost a lot more victims,'' said sheriff's Detective Lt.
Jack Judd.
   National Park Service Ranger Paul Crawford said some of the
passengers were walking around when he arrived.
   ``They were shellshocked. They had that empty, dazed look,''
Crawford said.
   A team of investigators from the National Transportation Safety
Board went to the crash site this morning.
   A sheriff's deputy removed a video camera from the wreckage, but
it was not known what the tape had captured, or even if it had been
in use while the plane was landing at the airport, situated about
five miles south of the Grand Canyon.
   Federal Aviation Administration records said the plane on Feb.
27 ``lost directional control on landing. Struck wingtip on runway.
Possible nose-wheel centering problem.'' The records indicated only
two crew members were aboard and neither was injured. The FAA
records listed wind as a contributing cause, and Ronald L. Warren,
Grand Canyon Airlines vice president and general manager, said this
morning he didn't know the final determination of the cause.
   He said the plane veered to the right on Feb. 27 and that it
went off to the left Wednesday. On Feb. 27, the plane was piloted
by a then-new employee who was being checked out by the pilot
killed in Wednesday's crash, Warren said.
   Warren said the plane in Wednesday's crash was on its second
flight of the day and making its final approach to the airport. He
said the plane, with 19 passengers and two crew members, had a
one-hour, 100-mile flight over the canyon.
   The plane hit the runway, bounced back up in the air about 100
feet then veered to the left and struck a power line and into a
ridge, Judd said.
   All the passengers were Americans, Warren said. The dead
included John Sutton, a Modesto, Calif., city councilman, and his
wife, Donna, said Modesto Mayor Carol Whiteside.
   The injured were taken by ambulance, airplane and helicopter to
the Flagstaff Medical Center, about 75 miles away. Eight were
listed in critical condition. The 11th survivor was released from
the hospital.
   Warren said when the 14-year-old plane reached the airport,
skies were clear, winds were light and temperatures normal.
   The pilot was in his mid-40s and had worked for the airline for
4{ years, Warren said. The co-pilot was in his mid-20s and in his
first year with the airline.
   No cockpit voice recorder or flight data recorder was aboard
because the devices are not manufactured for that type of aircraft,
Warren said.
   In 1986, a Grand Canyon Airlines plane collided with a
sightseeing helicopter inside the canyon, killing 25 people. In
1983, 10 people died when a sightseeing charter plane from Las
Vegas smashed into a cliff near the canyon's South Rim. A
crash-investigation report said the pilot encountered rough weather
and could not climb out of the canyon.
   In Washington, NTSB spokesman Mike Benson said the de Havilland
Twin Otter has been involved in 77 accidents since 1962, including
25 that killed a total of 135 people. During that period, the board
lists 89 accidents at the Grand Canyon, including 28 that resulted
in 105 fatalities.

   The Democratic-controlled Senate, in a major
reversal, today restored $600 million to President Bush's Star Wars
program as part of the $288 billion military spending bill.
   The Senate responded to the pleas of several legislators,
including leading defense figures, who said they were worried that
continuing cuts in the space-based defense initiative would cause
irreversible damage to the program.
   By a vote of 53-47, the Senate adopted an amendment requiring
that $4.3 billion of the money appropriated for the Defense
Department in the fiscal year beginning Sunday be spent on Star
Wars.
   On Tuesday, the Senate had voted overwhelmingly, 66-34, to spend
$3.7 billion on Star Wars, formally known as the Strategic Defense
Initiative, and lawmakers indicated that the vote reflected an
erosion in the support for the program.
   But the ranking members of the Senate Armed Services Committee _
Democrat Sam Nunn of Georgia and John Warner of Virginia _ argued
today that the Star Wars total approved Tuesday had undermined
their bargaining position in negotiations with the House on the
defense authorization bill.
   The Senate, in adopting its authorization legislation last
month, approved $4.5 billion for Star Wars. The House's defense
blueprint earmarked $3.1 billion for the program.
   ``We are being confronted by House conferees unwilling to look
at our number. They are instead taking the appropriations number,''
Nunn, a sponsor of the amendment, told his colleagues.
   He urged his colleagues to ``send a signal to the House
conferees'' that the Senate wants a final budget number for Star
Wars that is close to the fiscal 1989 total of $4.1 billion.
   Failure to restore the funds, Nunn said, would ``cut out any
negotiating position we have.''
   Warner, another amendment sponsor, said the vote would have a
``profound impact on the outcome of the House and Senate conference
on the authorization bill.''
   But Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., questioned whether senators
really believe the House is ``weak-willed and weak-minded'' and
wouldn't know ``what's going on here.''
   Johnston said the proponents of the amendment have asked the
Senate to ``engage in an exercise in self-delusion. ... Why should
we have such loyalty to unattainable goals. The goals (of Star
Wars) are elusive and vague.''
   The Senate was expected to complete work on the appropriations
bill today with a handful of amendments on anti-satellite weapons,
U.S. troop levels in Europe and Star Wars.
   The chamber today approved 95-5 an amendment allowing the use of
Defense Department funds for a multinational anti-narcotics strike
force if such a group is formed. A total amount was not specified.
   The other aspect of the measure, sponsored by Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., was a non-binding resolution calling on the
president to allow U.S. involvement in such a strike force. The
Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 had urged the president to enter into
negotiations to create a force.
   The other amendments pending:
   _Bar funds for anti-satellite weapons tests unless the
administration could certify that the Soviets had engaged in tests
of their own, had refused to bargain in good faith in limitations
and had blocked international verification efforts.
   _Call for either a reduction of 30,000 American troops stationed
in Europe or a requirement that U.S. allies foot the bill for those
personnel if NATO and the Warsaw Pact nations fail to reach a
conventional arms agreement by Oct. 1, 1990.
   _Require that $820 million of the money for Star Wars be used
for research on lasers and particle beams. Proponents of the
amendment expressed concerns that the administration will sacrifice
long-term research on directed energy weapons such as lasers and
particle beams in favor of a ``quick fix or a Phase 1 deployment''
that would favor the so-called ``Brilliant Pebbles'' scheme favored
by many in the administration.
   Lawmakers who on Wednesday assessed the damage of the Senate
Star Wars vote provided several explanations for the action,
including the shrinking defense budget, the decrease in support and
recent comments by Vice President Dan Quayle on the program.
   ``It was a straight referendum on this,'' Rep. Patricia
Schroeder, D-Colo., a member of the House Armed Services Committee,
said as she pulled an article on Quayle's comments from her file
folder.
   The vice president, who was a strong support of Star Wars when
he served in Congress, a few weeks ago said then-President Ronald
Reagan's SDI ``astrodome'' approach to protect the United States
was ``political jargon.''
   ``Members remember his passion'' for Star Wars, Schroeder said.
   But Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, discounted the effect of Quayle's comments as well as
the recent announcement by the Soviet Union that it would separate
Star Wars from a treaty reducing strategic arms.
   Some lawmakers had suggested the Soviet announcement had
undercut support for Star Wars.
   ``It's too soon to factor that in _ the impact of delinking,''
Aspin said.
   Aspin said the Senate vote ``doesn't represent a watershed'' but
rather ``support for the program has been eroding. Watch the vote
over the years.''
   Kasich said for six years Congress had kept ``sending this money
somewhere'' without knowing the results and the enthusiasm has
diminished. The vote, Kasich hopes, will prod the Bush
administration into indicating the future of the program and what
level of funding it will accept.
   ``The administration has to put a line in the sand on what is
not acceptable to them. I hope this shakes the administration out
of its unwillingness to confront this issue in a sharp way,'' he
said.
   ``Every year they're losing more support. They don't have any
program or any plan,'' he said.

   The number of legal abortions performed in the
United States has held largely steady throughout the 1980s, U.S.
health officials said Thursday.
   A total of 1,353,671 legal abortions were performed in the
United States in 1987, an increase of just under 2 percent from
1,328,112 in 1986, the national Centers for Disease Control said in
its weekly report.
   The total compares with 1,297,606 in 1980 and 1,333,521 in 1984.
   The actual number has risen somewhat, as has the U.S.
population, since 1980, but the rate of abortions has fallen
slightly. In 1987, health officials reported 356 abortions for
every 1,000 live births, compared to 359 in 1980, the Atlanta-based
CDC said.
   Twenty-six percent of the women having abortions in 1987, the
latest year for which statistics are available, were under 20.
Thirty-three percent were 20-24, and 41 percent were 25 or older.
   Seventy-three percent were unmarried, and 54 percent had never
given birth.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death of former Philippine President
Ferdinand E. Marcos today leaves his wife alone to battle charges
they stole between $168 million and $10 billion from their
homeland's treasury.
   A federal indictment charges that 60-year-old Imelda Marcos and
her husband took $168 million.
   But the Philippine government accuses the couple in a lawsuit of
making off with between $3.5 billion and $10 billion in cash and
property while his country amassed a large foreign debt.
   The money allegedly was spent directly or indirectly on such
luxuries as prime New York City real estate, a $4 million home in
Beverly Hills and paintings by artists including Picasso, Van Gogh
and Jan Bruegel.
   As the Marcoses fled to the United States on Feb. 26, 1986, the
Customs Service impounded more than $7 million in cash, valuables
and jewelry from their plane.
   His 20-year rule came to a swift end in a public uprising after
he was accused of stealing an election from Corazon Aquino, now the
Philippine president.
   Marcos entered a Honolulu hospital Jan. 16 with bronchial
asthma, pneumonia and congestive heart failure. He died there this
morning.
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the federal charges. Her
husband's ill health kept him from making the trip from Hawaii to
New York for arraignment on racketeering and other charges.
   The federal grand jury that indicted the Marcoses last October
also indicted Adnan Khashoggi, 54, the flamboyant Saudi financier
once reputed to be the world's wealthiest man. He was arrested in
Switzerland and extradited to New York.
   Khashoggi is accused of helping hide riches stolen by the
Marcoses and taking away 25 paintings from New York properties
owned by the couple and later selling them for $3.2 million.
   Although Marcos never appeared in court to counter the charges
directly, he commented when reports surfaced in late 1987 that a
federal investigation was under way into his real estate dealings
and jewelry acquisitions.
   He called the investigation ``a clear case of pure harassment.''
   He said he and his wife ``committed no wrongdoings, no violation
of any law in our conduct in relation to any properties now alleged
to be illegally obtained by us from anyone.''
   U.S. prosecutors this year conceded Marcos was too ill to stand
trial and his case was severed from the others but the charges were
not dropped.
   The Aquino government sought $50 billion in punitive damages in
a lawsuit filed in federal court in California against the Marcoses
and an aide, Ramon Azurin.
   The Marcoses were accused in the lawsuit of bribery, extortion,
theft and other charges in a scheme to steal billions of dollars in
public money to be used for their personal benefit.
   The Aquino government says it has statements from Swiss bank
authorities that Marcos and his family have accounts there worth
more than $1.5 billion.
   A federal judge's order bars the Marcoses from using any of
their assets except to pay their lawyers and for daily living
expenses. Mrs. Marcos has complained that this restriction has left
her in poverty.

   The first informal bargaining in two weeks between
striking telephone workers and New England Telephone Co. began and
ended Thursday when company officials rejected a new union proposal.
   Union officials presented a proposal in which they scaled back
wage increase demands to 4 percent for first year workers and a 1
percent for second and third year in addition to cost-of-living
adjustments, said officials for the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers.
   New England Telephone spokesman Peter Cronin said he could not
comment.
   After the company rejected the proposal, union members requested
a meeting over the weekend. A date has not been set.
   The strike against NYNEX, the parent company of New England
Telephone, in New York and New England has gone eight weeks. More
than 40,000 workers are on strike. It has produced consumer
complaints, allegations of widespread vandalism, and little
movement on the main issue: the cost of health care.
   NYNEX has insisted that its workers assume as much as $1,500 a
year in health costs.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Offers To Host Israeli-Palestinian Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze on Thursday proposed to act as an intermediary between
Israel and the PLO and offered to hold a meeting between them on
Soviet soil.
   Shevardnadze made the comment to reporters after meeting with
Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens. Both men praised the
improvement in Soviet-Israeli relations but said there were no
immediate plans to resume full diplomatic ties, severed by the
Soviets 22 years ago during the 1967 Middle East war.
   The ministers discussed the stalemated Mideast peace process,
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's election plan for the
occupied territories and a wide range of bilateral issues,
including consular relations and direct air links between Moscow
and Tel Aviv.
   Arens, speaking first to reporters after the meeting, said he
urged the Soviet Union to endorse the Israeli peace initiative.
``The Soviet Union does not reject that initiative,'' he said,
``and it sees some positive aspects in the initiative. I hope we
will eventually get endorsement from the Soviet Union.''
   Shevardnadze said ``I urged Foreign Minister Arens to engage in
dialogue and direct contact with the PLO.'' He added that in the
Soviet view, no Middle East settlement could succeed without the
participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``I even proposed my good offices to organize such a meeting
(between Israel and the PLO on the territory of the Soviet Union,''
he said. ``That could be a very good meeting and a sensation for
reporters,'' he said.
   Arens had departed and there was no immediate comment from the
Israeli side on the Soviet offer. However, Israel refuses to
negotiate with the PLO, which it views as a terrorist group.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union still hoped for an
international conference on the Middle East and said the five
permanent members of the U.S. Security Council _ the Soviet Union,
United States, China, Britain and France _ should be involved in a
settlement.
   Israel rejects any conference that would impose a settlement on
it and calls instead for bilateral talks with its neighbors.
   Later Thursday, Arens, of the right-wing Likud bloc, was to meet
with Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Egyptian Foreign
Minister Esmat Abdul Meguid.
   Israeli Finance Minister Shimon Peres, head of the center-left
Labor Party, was to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
Arens was to meet Mubarak on Friday.
   Mubarak's plan attaches conditions to Shamir's election plan and

   Chicken grease that leaked from a truck
smeared over 35 miles of highway, causing several accidents and
slightly injuring a motorist.
   ``It was very slick, mixed with rain _ like ice,'' police
Officer Chris Robinson said.
   The truck was hauling chicken waste from a poultry company
Tuesday, when a valve was left open by mistake, said Sam McClure, a
state maintenance engineer.
   Authorities would not identify the truck's owner, but said the
goo was smeared intermittently over 35 miles. Sand was spread over
the grease.
   Judy Croy of Gainesville was injured slightly when the pickup
truck she was driving hit a greasy patch and struck a guardrail,
Robinson said.
   The Florida Department of Transportation had not determined if
charges against the truck's owner were in order, McClure said.

<HEAD>Mark Harmon Welcomes Challenge of Williams Play</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mark Harmon says an actor's goal should be to
reach a level where you can ``work with the great people and say
the great words.''
   He got the chance to do that, he said, working opposite
Elizabeth Taylor in a television version of Tennessee Williams'
``Sweet Bird of Youth,'' directed by Nicolas Roeg.
   Harmon says he made no secret of his admiration for Miss Taylor
during filming of the two-hour movie, which will be broadcast
Sunday on NBC.
   ``I'm a tremendous fan of hers, and I told her that right from
the beginning,'' he said. ``I think she was having fun, too. I
think she's always wanted to play Alexandra Del Lago.''
   Del Lago is a fading movie queen who hooks up with Harmon's
Chance Wayne, a gigolo run out of his hometown after a sex scandal
involving a politician's daughter. A 1962 film version of the play
starred Paul Newman and Geraldine Page.
   Harmon, 38, says he thinks the play has as much power and
relevance now as it did 30 years ago.
   ``It's a story about time, and that's universal, and it's a
story about two people who need each other but have to destroy each
other in order to survive. That kind of relationship transcends
generations.''
   Harmon deliberately seeks parts that play against his clean-cut
good looks to avoid being typecast exclusively in lighter roles.
   ``People in this business love to find a niche for you. But I
need the challenges and I need to do different things.''

<HEAD>Czech Playwright Sends Message to International Writers Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The PEN international writers' association met
Thursday with an empty chair for Vaclav Havel, the Czech playwright
whose government barred him from attending.
   Instead, Havel sent a message asking for support for all writers
who face persecution.
   Havel had been invited to appear on a panel at the session,
titled ``The Writer and the Exercise of Freedom.'' Havel's passport
was confiscated 20 years ago, however, and his recent application
for a new one was denied.
   Jean-Guy Pilon, the Quebec writer who led Thursday's panel,
referred to the empty chair and said: ``This is a silent testimony,
yet an eloquent testimony to the exercise of freedom by a writer.''
   He noted that Havel's work has appeared on the world's stages,
``everywhere but in his native country.''
   In his message, read to the conference, Havel said: ``If a
single writer in our country is in chains, then there are some
links of that chain that bind us all.''
   He referred not to his own legal troubles but to those of three
other Czech writers _ Ivan Jirous, Frantisek Starek and Petr
Cibulka, whom Havel said were imprisoned for their writings or for
publishing others' work.
   ``Every voice raised in their defense is immensely important,
both to them personally, and to us all,'' Havel wrote. ``And so
your public support for these three friends of mine will not just
be an act of general humanity; it will be in the interest of us
all, in the interest of a free and truly authentic literature,
unbound by the agenda of any power.''
   Havel was released from prison May 17 midway through an
eight-month jail sentence on charges of incitement and obstructing
a police officer.
   He was charged in January after attending a memorial for Jan
Palach, a student who set himself on fire and burned to death in
January 1969 to protest the Soviet-led invasion a year earlier that
crushed the a reform movement.
   The increasing links between Eastern and Western writers as a
result of social and political reforms in the Soviet bloc have been
emphasized at the PEN congress.
   Czechoslovakia's leadership, however, has resisted the reforms.
   Two delegates from a new Soviet chapter based in Moscow attended
the world congress this year for the first time. The chapter was
admitted last May, ending a 65-year quarrel between Moscow and PEN,
the International Association of Poets, Playwrights, Editors,
Essayists and Novelists.
   The Czech chapter was declared dormant after the 1968 invasion
but is seeking to be reactivated.
   Canada is the host of the PEN world congress for the first time
since the association was formed in 1921. The English-speaking
Canadian chapter organized a two-day session in Toronto before the
conference moved Wednesday to Montreal for a session sponsored by
the French-speaking chapter.
   Betty Friedan, the American author and feminist, also was on the
Thursday panel and said threats to freedom of expression can be
more subtle but still exist in countries such as the United States
and Canada.
   ``I can tell you this from my personal experience as a writer
and a woman,'' said the author of ``The Feminine Mystique,'' a
classic on women's liberation.
   She said writing about women as anything other than the
acceptable post-World War II images such as housewife and sex
object was virtually impossible when her book was published more
than 25 years ago.

<UNK>Black Political Leaders Protest Council `Arrests'</UNK>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black political leaders are blasting
the City Council president and the sheriff's office for using
arrest warrants and restraints to force three black members to
return to a meeting for a vote.
   Arrest warrants, handcuffs and bolted doors were used to detain
Warren Jones, Dietra Micks and Denise Lee after they left the
meeting. President Tillie Fowler ordered them returned so the
Council would have a quorum.
   The three council members walked out Tuesday after failing to
get more money for sewage and drainage projects in their districts,
leaving the council without a quorum to adopt the city budget.
   State Sen. Arnett Girardeau said the council president's
decision to issue arrest warrants for the three set Jacksonville
back years in terms of racial relations.
   ``We have witnessed last night a preview of apartheid,''
Girardeau said at a news conference Wednesday.
   Other black leaders protesting the action were state Reps. Betty
Holzendorf and Corrine Brown, Civil Service Board Chairman Terry
Fields and the three council members. They were joined by several
black ministers, NAACP President Willye Dennis and businessmen.
   ``This act ... was an embarrassment to the entire Jacksonville
community and showed a void in the leadership of the City
Council,'' Ms. Holzendorf said.
   Undersheriff Raymond Miley said the Sheriff's Office will
investigate the conduct of the officers who forced the council
members back to the meeting.
   Mrs. Fowler said she thought the three council members acted
irresponsibly by walking out and almost delaying passage of the
budget that takes effect Oct. 1.
   She said her actions were not racially motivated and said the
procedure had been used in the past.

   The Federal Aviation Administration on
Thursday prohibited any aircraft from flying the remains of
Ferdinand E. Marcos out of the United States for the Philippines.
   The emergency regulation was issued after a request from the
State Department, which said a plane carrying the former Philippine
president's remains would ``create a danger to the safety of the
aircraft and persons involved.''
   Marcos died early Thursday in a Honolulu hospital where he had
been treated for 10 months for a series of ailments. Marcos, who
died at 72, had come to the United States in February 1986 after an
election and popular revolt ended his 20-year rule and installed
Corazon Aquino as president.
   Mrs. Aquino, in reacting to Marcos' death, reiterated a
government decision to bar the return of his body ``in the interest
of safety of those who will take the death of Mr. Marcos in widely
and passionately conflicting ways and for the tranquility of the
state and the order of society.''
   Prior to his death, Marcos' wife Imelda vowed to take the
remains back to his homeland.
   FAA spokesman John Leyden said the agency has a range of fines
and other actions that can be taken against a pilot or air operator
who violates regulations. The maximum fine is $10,000 for airplane
owners and $1,000 for individuals for each instance, but a pilot or
plane operator could also lose their flight certificates, depending
on the circumstances, Leyden said.
   The emergency regulation prohibits flight with Marcos' remains
from anywhere in the United States to any point in the Philippines
or to any intermediate destination on a flight whose ultimate
destination is the Philippines.
   The regulation remains in effect until Oct. 1, 1990, and could
be extended, the FAA said.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's
16-day-old government has outlined its economic battle plan,
focusing on out-of-control state finances that have unleashed an
inflation rate of 50 percent a month.
   The government's plan, however, envisions quickly raising prices
even higher in order to cut state subsidies on food and thereby
reduce the government budget deficit.
   An adviser to Mazowiecki, Waldemar Kuczynski, went on television
Wednesday night to appeal for public patience, likening the premier
to a driver who has taken over the steering wheel in the middle of
a skid.
   ``Every driver knows that leading a vehicle out of a skid
requires a very delicate and difficult maneuver,'' he said.
   The government's top economic officials outlined the plan
Wednesday in Washington to the International Monetary Fund. They
plan to submit a final economic program by Nov. 1 that would let
Poland get a standby credit agreement from the IMF by early 1990.
   An IMF standby agreement _ in which Poland would agree to a
strict reform program in exchange for new credits _ is considered a
prerequisite to any significant new loans from other lenders or
rescheduling of its crushing $39 billion foreign debt.
   ``I hope that soon we will receive a standby credit,'' said
Wladyslaw Baka, head of the National Bank of Poland, in an
interview with the state PAP news agency. ``Within two or three
weeks an IMF mission will arrive in Poland to conclude the talks.''
   Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz met with experts from
the Group of Seven most industrialized nations and requested a $1
billion loan to support the zloty while Poland introduces a
realistic exchange rate between the dollar and the zloty.
   He also sought an emergency loan of $500 million for imports of
food, medicine and fuel.
   According to the outline of the ``stabilization plan'' announced
by Balcerowicz and reported in the Polish press Thursday, the
government plans in the coming months include:
   _ Cutting the state budget deficit, now estimated at $3.4
billion.
   _ Limiting borrowing by creating market-based interest rates.
   _ Stopping or lowering most subsidies for production and lifting
most state price controls.
   _ Raising domestic prices for raw materials, such as coal and
lumber, to bring them into line with world prices.
   _ Limiting the growth of wages in excess of what the economy can
afford.
   In addition, under the heading of ``structural adjustments,''
the government plans:
   _ Eliminating administrative and fiscal barriers to privatizing
state-enterprises, which account for 93 percent of the
non-agricultural economy.
   _ Privatizing a great number of state-owned institutions.
   _ Tightening fiscal discipline of state-owned enterprises
through reduced credit, lower state subsidies and other means.
   Inflation has climbed alarmingly since the outgoing Communist
government of Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski released
controls of food prices Aug. 1.
   Meat prices alone were up 680 percent in August, according to
one Western economic specialist, and the respected economic
newspaper Zycie Gospardarcze estimated inflation at 50 percent in
August.
   Inflation at 50 percent a month is considered the threshhold of
``hyperinflation,'' and would translate into an annual inflation
rate of more than 600 percent.

   Army investigators from Fort Rucker,
Ala., were dispatched Thursday to Fort Stewart, where two soldiers
were killed during live fire exercises.
   The U.S. Army said in a statement that the soldiers were killed
about 8:45 a.m. Wednesday while firing 4.2-inch mortars at the
base's mortar range.
   The three-person investigative team left about 12:15 p.m., said
Lt. Colonel Herbert Blanks, spokesman for the Army Safety Center at
Fort Rucker.
   Identities of the victims were not released pending notification
of relatives.
   A 4.2-inch mortar is a short-barreled cannon which can be fired
from a position on the ground or from a vehicle like an open-back
armored personnel carrier.

<TEXT>
   An Air France supersonic Concorde jetliner on a
flight from New York to Paris lost a piece of the door covering the
landing gear as it was approaching Charles de Gaulle airport in
Paris, the company said Thursday.
   Air France said the piece was not a part of the landing gear
itself, but a part of the outer layer of the left landing gear door
and did not affect landing.
   The incident occurred Wednesday as the plane was flying at 250
mph about 3,600 feet over the French countryside.
   The piece of metal, about 40 inches by 30 inches and weighing 11
to 13 pounds, fell into an empty lot in Sannois, northwest of Paris.
   A man living in a trailer nearby heard the piece of metal fall
to the ground. He turned it over to police.
   Air France said the accident was caused by the breaking of a
connecting rod in the door. The company said all such rods were
being checked by technicians.
   Earlier this year, a Concorde, which flies at more than twice
the speed of sound, aborted its flight to New York and returned to
Paris after cracks appeared in a porthole. The crack was in the
outermost of four panes of glass in the porthole.

   ``House for Rent. Beautiful villa ... secluded
pool surrounded by a large patio bordered by tropical flowers and
bushes,'' said an ad in a real estate booklet that arrived in many
Washington area homes this week.
   The rent was $2,100 a week from January to April, $1,080 a week
from August to December.
   The house was in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, devastated by
Hurricane Hugo on Sept. 17.
   ``At this point, we are basically telling people who call for
the ad that to our knowledge, we have had damage, we don't know the
extent of it, so we are not taking renters at this point,'' Jorgen
Muurman of suburban Arlington, Va., who placed the ad, said
Thursday.
   ``The ad, of course, went into that magazine before the
hurricane struck.''
   Muurman's wife, Laura Del Corona-Borgia, said the house, which
they have owned for about 10 years, was one of two they had in St.
Croix. She said they had recently retired and planned to move to
the second St. Croix house.
   However, she said it, too, was believed to be severely damaged.
   Muurman, a Dane, worked for the World Bank here. Ms. Del
Corona-Borgia, an Italian, worked for the International Monetary
Fund.
   ``At this point, we only have reports from friends who have come
off the island,'' Muurman said. ``None of them have been close to
our houses, but we expect that it won't be in any condition to be
rented out for quite a while.''
   The villa, according to the ad, ``has a magnificent view since
it is situated on a hilltop overlooking the Caribbean Sea, and it
is within walking distance of one of the best and most private
beaches on St. Croix. 5 minutes from Christiansted, tennis and golf
nearby.''
   The house was vacant when the storm struck.

   A promising new anti-AIDS drug still in the
early stages of testing will be made widely available while safety
and effectiveness trials continue, the government announced
Thursday.
   The plan for expanded distribution of dideoxyinosine, or ddI,
marks the first time an unapproved, experimental AIDS drug will
become so widely available so early in testing.
   ``The epidemic of AIDS is extraordinary, and must be met with
extraordinary measures,'' said Food and Drug Administration
Commissioner Frank Young.
   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan said the plan ``reaffirms our
commitment to speeding both the development and the availability of
promising new drugs for patients with AIDS whenever possible.''
   Dideoxyinosine has stirred much anticipation and expectation in
the AIDS community because early study results have shown it may be
effective in stopping replication of the AIDS virus with fewer side
effects than zidovudine, known as AZT, the only FDA-approved drug
to combat the AIDS virus.
   Under the plan, ddI would be available to about 2,600 people
with AIDS or AIDS related complex in controlled clinical trials to
test it head-to-head against AZT.
   The plan will also make ddI available to people with AIDS or
advanced AIDS related complex who cannot take AZT and those for
whom the disease is progressing despite AZT and who have no other
treatment options.
   Bristol-Myers, which holds the license to manufacture ddI, has
said it will distribute the drug at no cost under the plan.
   Neither the company nor the FDA would estimate how many people
with AIDS might benefit under the plan.
   Clinical trials will be conducted at 50 sites around the
country, the company said. AIDS patients will have to have been
rejected for one of the clinical trials before they will be able to
receive ddI under the other distribution options.
   AIDS activists applauded the action. Mark Harrington of the New
York-based AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT-UP, said: ``This
is the start of something we've been working for for a long time.
... Let's use this as a good precedent and build on it.''
   The plan is the first demonstration of a concept that has been
under consideration by officials at the Public Health Service, an
HHS division that includes the FDA and the National Institutes of
Health, to make promising AIDS drugs available to more people
earlier in the testing process.
   They have called the concept ``parallel track,'' meaning that a
drug would be made available to people with AIDS in clinical trials
as well as to those who cannot participate in the trials.
   The first phase of clinical trials, during which dosage is
examined, have been completed on ddI by the National Cancer
Institute and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases.
   ``These studies showed that, while ddI appears promising, it has
toxicities related to the dose taken; thus, its use requires
careful monitoring,'' said an announcement of the plan by the
Department of Health and Human Services.
   Recent data indicate that some patients taking higher doses of
ddI have experienced painful nerve damage to the feet and damage to
the pancreas. These side effects appear to be reversible if they
are detected early and the drug is stopped, the department said.
   The department also cautioned:
   ``Despite the promising early results with ddI, it is important
to emphasize that zidovudine (AZT) is the only drug with proven
efficacy for the treatment of patients with AIDS and advanced ARC
(AIDS related complex).''
   The second phase of clinical trials on ddI is scheduled to begin
soon under the plan. These studies are intended to provide more
data on whether the drug is safe and effective.
   The department also said that while Bristol-Myers is not
charging for the cost of the drugs, people receiving it are likely
to incur charges from their doctors and for laboratory costs.
   Bristol-Myers said registration for the clinical trials will
begin immediately. Physicians, patients and others who want
information about the trials and other protocols should call a
toll-free government number, 1-800-TRIALS-A, Monday through Friday
9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Eastern time.
   Physicians who want to find out how to enroll patients can call
Bristol-Myers' toll-free number, 1-800-662-7999, daily 8 a.m. to 8
p.m., Eastern time.

<HEAD>IMF Officials Conclude Meetings; Optimistic on Increased Lending
Resources</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite public misgivings by the Bush
administration, officials of the International Monetary Fund on
Thursday predicted ultimate victory in their campaign to
dramatically increase their lending resources.
   Delegates from 152 nations concluded the annual meetings of the
IMF and its sister lending organization, the World Bank, without a
formal agreement on either a doubling of IMF resources or a
substantial increase for World Bank lending for the poorest nations
of the world.
   A final agreement on IMF resources, possibly by the end of the
year, is expected to represent a big boost for Japan's
international standing.
   Resolution of both issues was blocked by objections by the U.S.
delegation, led by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who
maintained that a persuasive case has not yet been made for the
increases.
   Despite those objections, officials said they had received
encouragement in private discussions with U.S. officials, including
talks with Bush, who spoke to the delegates on Wednesday.
   Dutch Finance Minister H. Onno Ruding, who heads the IMF's
policy-setting Interim Committee, said he came away from talks with
Bush ``very pleased that he showed himself to be very aware of the
issue.''
   IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus has appealed for a
doubling of IMF resources from the current $120 billion to $240
billion, saying the increase is needed for the IMF to meet added
responsibilities in the 1990s.
   Those challenges include support for the economic reforms under
way in Communist Eastern Europe and trimming the $1.3 trillion debt
burden being carried by the Third World.
   Officials said it was unlikely that Camdessus would get a 100
percent increase in IMF resources, known as quotas, although they
predicted that a significant boost of between 50 percent and 67
percent would occur.
   Camdessus told reporters he had been ``heartened by the growing
momentum of support'' for the quota increase as the week
progressed. He said the three countries still raising objections _
the United States, Britain and Saudi Arabia _ would likely drop
their opposition so the matter could be resolved by the end of the
year.
   The whole question of boosting IMF resources had to be settled
in conjunction with the ticklish diplomatic issue of how to
re-order the ranking of the major nations who contribute to the
fund.
   A country's voting power in the fund is based on its
contributions to the fund's programs. Japan, flush with capital
because of its huge trade surpluses, has been willing to recycle
some of those funds to help poor nations, but only if its power in
the IMF was increased.
   Under what many delegates believe is a likely outcome, Japan
will move from fifth place to second place, right behind the United
States, which would maintain the No. 1 position with 20 percent of
the voting shares. Japan would share second place with West
Germany, currently ranked third, according to the scenario.
   Britain, which is currently No. 2, would drop into a tie for
fourth with France. This shuffling of power would provide West
Germany and in particular Japan with stronger voices in the affairs
of the IMF, the agency created 44 years ago to prevent the kind of
economic dislocations which had resulted in two world wars.
   World Bank President Barber Conable was optimistic the issue of
boosting resources for the World Bank would soon be settled. The
United States is the lone hold-out over the question of providing
$14.5 billion for three years worth of loans by the Indernational
Development Association, the World Bank affiliate which provides
loans at low interest rates to the world's poorest nations.

   President Bush and the nation's
governors agreed today on goals for ``tradition-shattering reform''
of troubled American schools, including an anti-drug campaign,
reducing dropouts and slashing government red tape.
   ``We've reached agreement on the need for national performance
goals, on the need for more flexibility and accountability, the
need for restructuring and choice.... and the need for more federal
support for the pre-kindergarten education process,'' Bush said in
a sun-splashed ceremony ending a two-day education summit at the
University of Virginia.
   Speaking on the lawn outside the university Rotunda, the
president pledged ``my determination to follow up in every way
possible'' on the accord he reached with the governors.
   ``We just cannot let it sit here and end here and I promise you
that I won't, my Cabinet won't and my entire administration will
not,'' he said.
   Gov. Booth Gardner, D-Wash., reflecting a widespread concern
among the governors, said any additional federal aid ``that becomes
available will be applied to the issue of early childhood education
and Head Start.''
   The agreement was announced by Bush, Gardner and Gov. Terry
Branstad of Iowa, chairman of the National Governors' Association,
after the president had outlined his views on the school crisis.
   ``From this day forward, let us be an America of tougher
standards, an America of higher goals and a land of bigger
dreams,'' Bush said at a midday convocation with governors,
educators and students at the University of Virginia.
   The president pledged to loosen federal restrictions on the
states and urged the governors, in turn, to relax their regulatory
hold on local schools.
   Calling for national goals by which to judge the performance of
schools and students, Bush said there must be ``a new spirit of
competition between students, between teachers and between schools,
a report card for all.
   ``And to get results,'' he said, ``we will need discipline,
structure and goals.''
   Bush added, ``The American people are ready for radical reforms.
We must not disappoint them.''
   The president called for ``tradition-shattering reform'' in
several areas.
   He said every student should be literate enough to know not only
their three R's but ``why Americans died at Bunker Hill, at
Gettysburg and at Monte Cassino.''
   Bush also urged allowing parents to choose which schools their
children attend, and said there must be new, more accurate ways of
evaluating schools and making educators more accountable for
classroom performance.
   The president said the education system must never settle ``for
the minimum in academics or in behavior. Decades of research bear
out what the best teachers already know: when standards and
expectations are high, everyone does better.''
   On the sensitive issue of financing reforms, Bush said:
   ``To those who say that money alone is the answer, I say that
there is no one answer. If anything, hard experience teaches that
we are simply not getting our money's worth in education. Our focus
must no longer be on resources. It must be on results.''
   The statement of summit goals, drafted at an early morning
meeting of White House aides and a delegation of leading governors,
included these proposals:
   _ Helping all children prepare for school through nutrition
programs, Head Start care for needy preschoolers and other programs
aimed at overcoming the effects of poverty.
   _ Restructuring the school system to make educators more
accountable for their pupils' classroom performance.
   _ Keeping drugs out of schools.
   _ Bolstering on-the-job education to make sure American workers
can meet competition from abroad.
   _ Improving literacy in a nation where an estimated 23 million
adults are classified as functionally illiterate.
   _ Providing more flexibility for educators by reducing federal
and state government regulations.
   _ Renewed efforts to reduce a national dropout rate approaching
30 percent.
   Neither White House aides nor the governors offered an estimate
of how much the long-term school reforms would cost or how they
would be financed.
   Although Bush has rejected any major new federal spending
initiatives, White House chief of staff John Sununu said the
president was impressed by the governors' widespread support for
early childhood programs such as Head Start. He suggested that Bush
would continue to give them a high budget priority.
   Despite Bush's apparent satisfaction with the summit's work,
former Education Secretary William Bennett told reporters the
closed sessions were marred by uninformed discussions and partisan
``pap.''
   About 50 university students and 10 United Mine Workers
unionists registered their disapproval by holding a protest rally
outside the Rotunda, where Bush and the governors were meeting.
   ``When we read your lips, all we see is lip service,'' read one
demonstrator's sign, paraphrasing Bush's widely quoted opposition
to raising taxes.
   Democratic governors, meanwhile, played down the issue of
increased federal school aid, although they warned that Washington
ultimately must bolster its support for public education.
   ``We just don't think that at this time it's worth letting the
summit break apart over a fight over how much money they'll have to
put up next year,'' said Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
   ``Yes, there'll have to be a greater investment,'' he said on
NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``Yes, they'll have to reverse their
declining participation. But ... setting the goals is the most
important thing to do.''
   At the governors' first plenary session this morning, Bush said
the summit had been ``extraordinarily helpful to me and our
Cabinet.'' Then they discussed reports from workshop debates on
improving the learning environment, enhancing the teaching
profession and defining who's in charge of the schools.
   After further meetings and concluding statements by the
summiteers this afternoon, Bush was returning to Washington for a
ceremony honoring outstanding secondary schools and a meeting with
Colombian President Virgilio Barco on their battle against cocaine
barons.
   The president planned to fly to South Carolina on Friday for a
first-hand look at the devastation left by Hurricane Hugo.
   Clinton and Republican Govs. Terry Branstad of Iowa and Carroll
Campbell of South Carolina reportedly worked with White House aides
until 3 a.m. today on the draft of summit goals.
   Branstad previously had said that a set of targets may be ready
by the time the governors meet again next February in Washington.
   Virginia's Democratic Gov. Gerald L. Baliles, the summit host,
said Bush's closed-door talks with the governors did not focus on
money.
   ``We're not here today to rattle a tin cup,'' Baliles said.
``Many of us would be satisfied if the federal government would
just keep the promises it has made in education.''

   Comedian Jackie Mason, whose schtick has stung

Democratic candidate David Dinkins looks like ``a black model

   Mason's participation in the Giuliani campaign was severed

included a comment that Jews would vote for Dinkins out of guilt.
   ``I'd like to say something from the bottom of my heart,''
Mason's statement began. ``I'm a comedian, not a politician. ...
The jokes come from affection.''
   Dinkins, asked again Thursday about Mason's comments, expressed
the hope they would not become an issue as the campaign continues.
   ``He has withdrawn from the campaign and, hopefully, that is the
end of that,'' Dinkins said.

<TEXT>
   The government has returned 100 planes
seized during its crackdown on the cocaine cartels because it had
no proof they were used in drug trafficking, a government source
said Thursday.
   Security was tightened for a second day in the capital as
authorities tried to stop a wave of bombings that officials blame
on the drug lords.
   A high-ranking government official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said in a telephone interview that of the 375 aircraft
seized in the past six weeks, 180 were found to have been used in
drug trafficking and were turned over to the Colombian air force.
   Colombia's National Drug Council has used guidelines of the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration to order the seizure of property
believed to have been used in trafficking.
   Since President Virgilio Barco declared war on the nation's drug
dealers Aug. 19, security forces also have seized 525 vehicles and
74 boats.
   The government source said that 100 of the aircraft were
returned to the owners because there was no proof they were used to
haul drugs. The Drug Council has not identified the owners.
   The council consists of five Cabinet ministers, the attorney
general and the chief of the national police. The ministers did not
return telephone calls Thursday and could not be reached for
comment.
   Barco said Tuesday that as part of the crackdown, security
forces also had seized 1,056 mansions, ranches and other property.
   The owners cannot reclaim the property unless they prove in
court that they bought it with legally earned money.
   Traffic was tied up in many parts of Bogota for a second day
Thursday as police at checkpoints searched cars for dynamite and
guns.
   There were two explosions in the city of 6 million people
Wednesday night, one at a bank and another at a gasoline station.
   The bomb at the service station killed two people, who appeared
to be terrorists in a car that was loaded with dynamite and blew
up, said police Gen. Octavio Vargas. Five people were injured.
   In the past six weeks 114 bombs have exploded in Colombia's
biggest cities, killing 10 people and wounding 140.
   No one has claimed responsibility for the blasts, but government
security forces say all were caused by drug traffickers.

   The government on Thursday stripped disgraced
former President Leonid I. Brezhnev of the nation's highest
military honor, saying he did not deserve it.
   Brezhnev had a fondness for awards and medals and during the
later years of his life had himself presented with many of the
country's highest honors.
   One of those was the Order of Victory. Only a few have been
awarded it, including the leaders of the Soviet and allied forces
in World War II.
   The decision to take away Brezhnev's Order of Victory from 1978
was made by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's
highest executive body, the Tass news agency said.
   Brezhnev was a Red Army political officer in southern Russia and
the Ukraine during the war and made much of his service in a 1978
book called ``The Small Land,'' about the battle for a small group
of islands in the Black Sea.
   Since he died in 1982, Brezhnev has been subjected to scathing
criticism for fostering economic stagnation and an atmosphere of
cronyism in the Soviet Communist Party and government.
   His name has been removed from cities, streets, and factories
and a plaque honoring him has been removed from an apartment
building in Moscow where he lived as Communist Party leader.

   Parliament on Thursday condemned
Hungary's participation in the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of
Czechoslovakia and called it illegal.
   Hungary joined Poland as the only Soviet bloc governments to
condemn the invasion in which all pact countries _ except Romania _
took part. Hungary's Communist Party previously had condemned the
Aug. 20-21, 1968, invasion.
   Janos Seboek, a member of Parliament who presented the motion,
said that did not represent the Hungarian people to the extent that
Parliament does.
   ``On the basis of the principle of sovereignty and equality of
nations and heeding the lessons of recent Hungarian history,
Parliament condemns the decision which illegally sent Hungarian
troops into Czechoslovakia and intervened in the affairs of a
neighboring country,'' the government statement said.
   Parliament adopted the position with 250 votes in favor and 11
against.
   Earlier in the day, Defense Minister Ferenc Karpati called the
Brezhnev Doctrine ``outdated for good.''
   The doctrine, which allows Moscow to intervene militarily if the
Kremlin considers communism ``in danger'' in other Warsaw Pact
countries, was invoked by the late Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev to
justify the crushing of the ``Prague Spring'' reforms of Alexander
Dubcek.
   Hungarian leaders, eager to assure their citizens there is no
threat from Moscow to the broad political reforms under way in
Hungary, have said they have assurances from the Kremlin that the
doctrine was no longer in force.
   Seboek said that because the doctrine was an ideology and not a
law, it could be invoked against Hungary at any time.
   It could be used in two ways, he said: ``Either directly, which
is a genuine danger as long as there are Stalinist regimes in the
neighboring countries, or indirectly when the same powers help
domestic conservatives regain power.''
   Hungary's bilateral agreements with allied countries should be
reviewed, Seboek said, noting that Parliament members do not know
``if our fraternal assistance agreements contain military clauses.''

   Rescuers Thursday recovered the
bodies of two climbers killed in an avalanche on the Matterhorn,
the first victims of an early snowstorm that blanketed the Swiss
Alps.
   The two fell about 300 feet to their death when they were caught
in an avalanche Wednesday evening while exploring the mountain's
north face, Air Zermatt rescue service said. Bad weather prevented
immediate rescue efforts.
   Authorities withheld the victims' identity pending notification

<HEAD>From Shelter to Stanford, Homeless Teen Attends Top University</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXNARD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old girl who lived in a noisy
homeless shelter and whose mother was a migrant farm worker has
worked her way with high grades and scholarships into Stanford, the
state's most expensive university.
   ``Ever since I can remember, we've been poorer than poor,'' said
Maria ``Lupe'' Vasquez. ``I would think the only way out is to get
married. The only other way, my mother would tell me, is through
education.''
   On Wednesday, Ms. Vasquez started classes at Stanford
University, where she plans to major in engineering, pursue a
doctorate degree and enjoy the kind of social life that eluded her
in high school.
   ``I want to have my freedom,'' she said. ``I want to have fun.''
   She's the pride of the Zoe Christian Center homeless shelter.
   ``Lupe is the culmination of 11 years of working with the poor,
and we finally strike gold,'' said the Rev. Jim Gilmer, the
center's director. ``Lupe was such a blessing to us.''
   Ms. Vasquez, born in Chihuahua, Mexico, was 2 when her parents
divorced. She and her mother, an itinerant onion picker, and a
sister moved to Arizona, where they lived in a series of small
apartments.
   Her mother remarried and had three more children, and the family
of seven moved to Oxnard, squeezing into a boarding room with three
beds, a table and a policy against children.
   Every time the family heard the landlord coming up the steps,
they went out the back way and hid in abandoned cars behind the
building, said Ms. Vasquez.
   From the boarding room, the family moved to the homeless
shelter, a relief at first for Ms. Vasquez because she could count
on a bed and regular meals.
   Despite life in the noisy shelter, Ms. Vasquez did extremely
well in school, graduating second from Oxnard High School in a
class of 397 last June and collecting so many awards and
scholarships that the year-end honor ceremony was jokingly called
``Lupe Vasquez Night.''
   ``She has the basic tools to start with and the work ethic along
with that,'' said Paul Orseth, her teacher in honors classes in
economics and government.
   Ms. Vasquez applied to six colleges, was accepted to all of them
and chose Stanford, the most expensive university in the state with
yearly costs topping $21,000.
   She's paying for her education with a collection of grants and
scholarships and money from a 20-hour-a-week job at the shelter.
The shelter also gave her a donated used car and $1,000 for
spending money.

<HEAD>Old Guard Party Chief Loses Job to Gorbachev Protege</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The conservative chief of the Ukrainian Communist
Party lost his position as boss of the Soviet Union's strongest
political machine Thursday to a progressive protege of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev sharply criticized the dictatorial style of the ousted
official, Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, who ran the Ukraine and its 50
million people with an iron hand for 17 years.
   He was retired in a meeting of Ukrainian Communists, which
Gorbachev attended.
   The new Ukrainian party boss is Vladimir A. Ivashko, who was
Shcherbitsky's second-in-command and who three weeks ago used the
pages of the daily newspaper Izvestia to sharply criticize absolute
commanders unresponsive to the public.
   Ivashko, an economist and engineer, was chosen in a competitive,
secret ballot, the Tass news agency said.
   Shcherbitsky was expected to lose the Ukrainian job after he was
retired from the Soviet Union's ruling Politburo last week in a
shake-up that cemented Gorbachev's hold on power.
   The meeting Thursday of the Ukrainian Communist Party Central
Committee was highlighted by Gorbachev's warning to Ukrainian
Communists to stop fighting reform groups and start listening to
their ideas and complaints.
   ``Either we recognize the right of others to independence of
thought and actions, either we lead active work to gain public
opinion and public sympathies to our side, and multiply leading
forces of perestroika, or we turn into a limited organization,
merely claiming a leading role,'' Gorbachev said in a speech
broadcast on national television.
   With the exception of Gorbachev himself, Shcherbitsky was last
member of the Politburo picked by the late President Leonid
Brezhnev, whose rule is now officially termed the ``period of
stagnation.''
   Activists in the Ukraine blamed the 71-year-old Shcherbitsky and
his men for slowing economic and political reform in the nation's
breadbasket and industrial heartland.
   Activists said he remained in power as long as he did because
Gorbachev did not have the political strength to oust him, or
because Gorbachev needed his strong-arm tactics to keep Ukrainian
nationalists in line.
   In the Izvestia article, Ivashko described himself as ``a
stubborn supporter of choosing leaders from below.''
   ``This is critically important, for after all it is impossible
to change the system if one absolute commander is simply replaced
by another,'' he said. ``The system remains the same _ commanding.''
   The 56-year-old Ivashko, who was promoted to the No. 2 job in
the Ukrainian Communist Party in December last year, is considered
a supporter and protege of Gorbachev.
   Ivashko became a candidate member of the Soviet Communists'
Central Committee in 1986, shortly after Gorbachev came to power.
He was promoted to a full, voting member in April, when 110 mostly
elderly conservatives were retired.
   Last winter, top Communists nominated Ivashko as one of the 100
candidates for 100 uncontested seats reserved for the party in the
new Soviet Congress of People's Deputies, said a Western analyst.
   Shcherbitsky, in contrast, was one of the few Politburo members
who had to run in a contested election. He chose a safe candidacy
in his home base in the Dnepropetrovsk region after workers in his
capital of Kiev turned him down three times.
   Ivashko had been demoted out of the secretariat of the Ukrainian
party in 1987, and some Western analysts say this occurred shortly
after a clash between Gorbachev and Shcherbitsky.
   Tass said Ivashko ran for the first secretary job Thursday
against another Ukrainian Communist Party secretary, Stanislav
Gurenko. The news agency did not report the vote totals but said
that Ivashko received solid support.
   In February, as the country prepared for its first nationwide
competitive elections in 70 years, Gorbachev made a campaign-style
trip through the Ukraine promoting his reform program known as
``perestroika'' and upstaging a dour-faced Shcherbitsky at each
stop.
   He met with leaders of a fledgling local reform movement that
has since mushroomed and spoke to workers in the streets,
encouraging them to oust their old-style bosses.
   Ivashko, like Gorbachev, has had some kind words for the
alternative organizations that have sprung up under perestroika.
But both men criticize ``demagogues'' in some of the groups for
seeking political power.
   During Gorbachev's February visit, Ukrainian police permitted
nightly protest meetings where activists openly called for
Shcherbitsky's defeat at the polls.
   Immediately after Gorbachev's departure, Shcherbitsky cracked
down again on protesters.
   The conservative party boss struggled to maintain surface calm
with police power, but the picture cracked in July when coal miners
in the Donetsk region of the Ukraine joined a strike that spread
nationwide.

<HEAD>Head Start: Bush, Governors Like It but Money Lacking</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates with joint statement, subbing grafs 2-4</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Head Start, the federal pre-school
program, was singled out for praise by governor after governor at
the education summit, but there was no indication they had
persuaded President Bush to provide enough money for all poor
toddlers to attend.
   Still, supporters of the program could claim at least a bit of
progress. Thursday's concluding joint statement by Bush and the
governors said in regard to federal education money: ``We urge that
priority for any further funding increases be given to prepare
young children to succeed in school.''
   Bush himself, in his speech to the governors, made a point of
noting that his education proposals to Congress last spring
included ``an increase in funding for Head Start.''
   However, Bush's proposed increase _ about $250 million for a
$1.2 billion program _ falls far short of what many governors and
educators say is needed.
   ``It is a good program, it works, but it is not available except
to about 27 percent of the (eligible) students,'' complained
Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, a Democrat.
   Other governors, said Bush's press secretary Marlin Fitzwater,
also indicated to the president during summit working sessions that
``early child'' programs, including Head Start, can be critical in
terms of ultimate educational success for children who would
otherwise start school at a disadvantage to kids from well-off
families.
   And a list of goals, drafted by White House aides and a
delegation of leading governors at the summit, included helping all
children prepare for school through nutrition programs, Head Start
care for needy preschoolers and other programs aimed at overcoming
the effects of poverty.
   But, again, no talk of full funding.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a Democrat, recalled that during the
presidential campaign Bush said he favored the idea that all
disadvantaged 4-year-olds be covered.
   However, Clinton indicated that governors spending much time
fighting for funding for Head Start at the summit would have been
``a very foolish expenditure of our time ... when we have so much
more to fight over, argue about or work through.''
   ``There's a difference of opinions among Democrats and a
difference of opinions among Republicans,'' said Clinton. ``Gov.
(Carroll) Campbell (a South Carolina Republican) and I would like
to see our children covered with Head Start funds but it's a
mistake to think that's the sole subject of the summit.''
   Head Start, begun as part of President Lyndon Johnson's War on
Poverty in 1965, serves about 452,000 youngsters, including 13
percent handicapped. Estimates are that there are 2.4 million
eligible children.
   About $1.2 billion was spent on the program this year. The
National Education Association estimates about $6.3 billion is
needed to serve all eligible children aged 3 through 5.
   ``Certainly Head Start has been a fine program,'' said Education
Secretary Lauro Cavazos in an interview. ``The problem that we're
getting into is the funding issue again.''
   ``All you've got to do is look at the federal budget and it's
clear that there's no room for a lot of new programs and a lot of
expansion activity,'' he said. ``That's not to say that as a
department we're not going to push early childhood education. We
certainly believe that's a part of it.''
   Head Start is administered by the Administration on Children,
Youth and Families within the Department of Health and Human
Services, not the Education Department. It started as an eight-week
summer program to help disadvantaged youngsters catch up with
wealthier children so that they could enter first grade on an equal
footing.
   Rules say 80 percent of enrolled children must be from families
at or below the poverty level.
   Frequently touted by liberals and conservatives alike, the
program has a proven track record of improving children's
performance on school achievement tests, helping them learn social
skills and improving parents' attitudes toward their children.
   The program also provides medical and nutritional services.
   The Council on Competitiveness said a review of Head Start
evaluation studies shows that the program also helps to reduce
school absenteeism and health problems, and lowers the likelihood
that a student will drop out of the education system.
   Bush's proposed increase of $250 million would allow an
additional 90,000 children to receive services, officials say.
   Both houses of Congress have approved authorization for the
extra money but in different pieces of legislation.

   Here are some of the major provisions of the
tax and entitlement bill before the House. Several of the
provisions, including the catastrophic illness coverage and child
care, are subject to amendment or change before final passage of
the bill.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>CAPITAL GAINS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The bill would reduce the maximum tax rate on profits from the
selling of capital assets, such as real estate and stocks.
   Through the end of 1991, the current 33 percent top rate would
be reduced to 19.6 percent. The rate would then be raised to 28
percent and the basis of assets ``indexed'' so that profit caused
entirely by inflation would not be taxed.
   The change is expected to bring the Treasury additional revenue
in the next three fiscal years _ $2.9 billion in fiscal 1990, $3.8
billion in fiscal 1991 and $2.7 billion in fiscal 1992 _ as people
take advantage of the lower rate and increase their capital
activity.
   After the initial increase, the government's intake would drop
sharply with losses of more than $5 billion projected for fiscal
1993 and 1994.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>CATASTROPHIC HEALTH</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The bill would cut in half the surtax paid by the wealthiest 40
percent of retirees and increase the flat monthly catastrophic
premium paid by all but the poorest Medicare beneficiaries. It
would allow retirees to turn down catastrophic coverage only if
they drop out of Medicare Part B, which pays physicians' fees.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>CHILD CARE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The bill includes competing child proposals that will be settled
in a House vote next week.
   In one version, the Head Start program for pre-school children
would be expanded into a full-year, all-day system, along with
additional child care in the schools and state grants for child
care chosen by parents.
   The other would provide an additional $16 billion in tax credits
and state-administered grants to lower-income families over the
next five years to help improve child care for working parents. It
would liberalize the earned-income credit, which benefits
lower-income working families with children.
   The credit, worth more to larger families, ould range up to
$1,790 a year for those with three or more children. A new credit
of up to $430 a year would help families with children under the
age of 6.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>CORPORATE TAXES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The bill includes about $6.3 billion in net revenue increase for
fiscal 1990, including the capital gains cut.
   Significant among the others are repeal the completed-contract
method of accounting, by which big defense contractors may defer
taxes; eliminate special tax benefits for banks that lend money to
Employee Stock Ownership Plans; and end an interest break on big
banks' large loans to developing countries.
   The bill would also require companies to move quickly to give
the government the payroll taxes they withhold from employees, and
would repeal a 1986 tax law provision aimed at ensuring that
employer-financed health plans don't discriminate in favor of
higher-paid employees.
   The bill would extend the 25 percent deduction for health
insurance premiums paid by self-employed workers, due to expire
this year. A variety of expiring tax-code incentives would be
extended, including authority for state and local governments to
issue tax-exempt bonds for low and middle-income housing, a
research and development tax credit and a break for
employer-provided educational assistance.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>EXCISE TAXES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The bill would cancel a scheduled reduction in the 8 percent tax
on airline tickets and 5 percent tax on air freight. The 3 percent
federal tax on telephone service, scheduled to expire at the end of
next year, would be made permanent.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>OZONE LAYER</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The bill would levy $4.3 billion in new taxes over the next five
years on profits of companies making ozone-depleting chemicals.
   The Bush administration sought the measure, which targets
windfall profits that chemical companies could earn after an
international treaty reduces supplies of chlorofluorocarbons. The
chemical industry denies there will be windfall profits.
   CFC's destroy the ozone layer in the stratosphere and increase
risk of skin cancer. A similar provision is pending before the
Senate.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PENSIONS=
   The bill would put new restrictions on employers seeking to
terminate pension plans, in order to discourage companies from
using those assets for other purposes.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>AGRICULTURE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The bill would change the system for paying deficiency payments
to some farmers, reducing the fiscal 1990 deficit by changing the
calculations and shifting some of the costs to fiscal 1991.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>STUDENT LOANS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The bill would institute a six-month amnesty program for people
who defaulted on their student loans. The loans and interest could
be repaid without additional penalties during the amnesty.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>FAIRNESS DOCTRINE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Fairness Doctrine, which required broadcasters to allow time
for opposing viewpoints, would be re-established. It was abolished
during the Reagan administration.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>DIAL-A-PORN</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The bill would require telephone companies to block access to
``Dial-a-Porn'' services unless a customer requests such access. A
more sweeping ban on all such services passed in the last Congress
was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>SOCIAL SECURITY</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The bill increases to $10,440 by 1991 the amount that a Social
Security recipient may earn without having benefits reduced, a $600
increase. The Social Security Administration would be made an
independent agency, removed from the Department of Health and Human
Services.

<HEAD>Munich Paper Quotes Cardinal as Saying Jews Don't Understand Poles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal Jozef Glemp of Poland was
quoted in an interview published Thursday as saying Jews,
especially those in the United States, don't understand the Polish
people.
   The respected Sueddeutsche Zeitung of Munich also quoted the
controversial Polish primate as saying he wants to hold a symposium
to clear up misunderstandings between Jews and Poles.
   Poland's Roman Catholic leaders and Jewish organizations have
been at odds in recent weeks over a Carmelite convent outside the
walls of the former Auschwitz Nazi concentration camp in Poland.
   Jewish and Catholic representatives, including Polish Cardinal
Franciszek Macharski, agreed in Geneva in February 1987 to move the
17 Carmelite nuns from the convent. The convent comes under
Macharski's Krakow diocese.
   Jewish groups claim the convent and a 23-foot cross at the
Auschwitz-Birkenau location are offensive and insensitive. An
estimated 2.5 million Jews were killed at Auschwitz during the Nazi
Holocaust.
   On July 14, an American rabbi and six other Jews staged a
protest at the site because the convent had not been closed, as
agreed. The protesters tried to scramble over a convent wall and
were forcibly ejected by Polish laborers.
   Cardinal Macharski announced Aug. 10 that the agreement to move
the nuns would be abrogated due to the ``aggressive'' atmosphere of
the controversy.
   In a sermon on Aug. 26, Glemp said it was only luck ``that none
of the nuns were murdered,'' further angering Jewish groups.
   He insisted the agreement to move the convent should be
renegotiated, and that the Polish church lacked funds to build a
new facility for the nuns.
   But on Sept. 19, the Vatican announced the convent should be
moved and said it would help finance the relocation.
   Elan Steinberg, executive director of the New York-based World
Jewish Congress, hailed the announcement as a breakthrough.
   Glemp denied in the newspaper interview that his sermon had
anti-Jewish undertones.
   Referring to ``many press comments alleging my anti-semitism,''
Glemp said: ``I counter by saying that this anti-semitism does not
exist in me.''
   Glemp said the Jewish protests against the convent ``offended
our dignity and that of the nuns.''
   ``That is why I had to also protest loudly. This protest was
misunderstood. For me it concerned a more open and deeper
dialogue,'' the newspaper quoted Glemp as saying.
   Glemp, who suggested in his sermon that Jews stirred up
anti-Polish sentiments in the international press, said the
coverage was at times hurtful and showed ``ignorance of Polish
problems.''
   ``I think that after this storm, after these very sharp and
vehement discussions, the weaknesses on both sides are clearer,''
Glemp was quoted as saying when asked how Christian-Jewish
differences could be resolved.
   He said an inter-faith symposium should be convened to discuss
problems.
   ``We want the Jews to understand us, especially the Jews in
America, who talk a lot but do not understand the situation. We
want them to develop a correct respect for the Poles,'' the
newspaper quoted Glemp as saying.

Hiroshima, its hands fixed forever at the fatal time of 8:15, was
stolen from a collection of artifacts, U.N. officials said Thursday.
   U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes said the watch vanished from a
display case about a month ago, that an investigation failed to
find it and it is presumed stolen.
   Japan donated the watch for display with a collection of
Hiroshima artifacts.
   Undersecretary-General Therese Sevigny, wrote to Japan's Foreign

<HEAD>Senate Panel Balks at Bush Plan To Aid Nicaraguan Candidate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's $9 million plan to help the
Nicaraguan political opposition in next year's election ran into
trouble Thursday at a Senate hearing when some lawmakers said it
was too vague and Sen. Jesse Helms accused the administration of
trying to ``railroad'' it through Congress.
   But Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, urged a Senate Foreign Relations panel to
approve the transfer of money to help opposition candidate Violeta
Chamorro, saying ``this is fundamentally not a fair fight.''
   In a related development, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman
David Boren, D-Okla., said he had been assured by Bush
administration officials that there would be no attempt to use the
CIA or other means to influence the elections clandestinely.
   ``I've been given absolute assurance,'' Boren said. ``There's
not a glimmer, not a crack, not a loophole of any kind.''
   The overt aid plan calls for giving an additional $5 million to
the National Endowment for Democracy, a quasi-governmental
foundation, to use for election monitoring, voter registration and
other activities deemed non-partisan.
   Another $4 million could go outside NED channels to monitoring
groups, registration and get-out-the-vote activities.
   Aronson asked senators to see that the aid is approved quickly,
since voters may register for the Feb. 25 voting only during
October.
   But Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said it was unlikely money
could be approved before next week at the earliest, and he
challenged Aronson on how the money would be spent.
   When Aronson began to compare the ``modest'' U.S. proposal with
the billions received by Nicaragua from the Soviets, Dodd halted
him and called it a ``silly point.''
   Aronson protested that the United States is seeking to build
from scratch an electoral mechanism in a country which never has
had free elections, ``educate people about the process and give
them some sense that they can vote safely.''
   ``The question is whether it's well thought out,'' Dodd said.
``There is no question we ought to be involved. The question is
whether we're doing it intelligently.''
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., echoed those concerns. ``There is
a lot of money going out. In our fervent desire to see a strong
election and hopefully the success of Mrs. Chamorro, we have to be
cautious about how that money is being spent,'' she said.
   NED Director Carl Gershman conceded that ``this dwarfs what the
endowment itself has been able to spend in any other situation,''
including larger countries like the Philippines, Panama and Chile.
   The hearing was cut short because of a Republican procedural
objection, and Helms, R-N.C., entered the room only long enough to
complain that the session had been scheduled without any advance
notice to Senate Republicans.
   ``The minority was not consulted ... and I resent it,'' he said.
   When chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said the session had been
arranged with the ``Republican administration,'' Helms replied:
``You thought you were going to snooker us.''
   ``I fundamentally object to this thing being railroaded as it
is,'' Helms said outside the hearing. ``If they want to play games
like that I know how to play them as well.''
   Helms' stated objections to the package include a philosophical
opposition to U.S. involvement in overseas elections, disapproval
of the opposition coalition which includes communists and
socialists, and the necessity of paying some of the money in the
form of a tax to the Sandinista-controlled Supreme Electoral
Council.

<HEAD>Wine Hidden from Germans in Danish Castle is Sold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rare wine from a Danish castle cellar that was
hidden from the invading Germans in World War II sold for $162,000
on Thursday, the auctioneers Christie's said.
   All of the nearly 3,000 bottles of wine, most of them French,
were sold by the owner of the 1,100-year-old Aalholm Castle near
Nysted in southern Denmark. The chief buyers were two collectors, a
Belgian and a Norwegian, the London-based auction house said.
   Michael Broadbent, head of Christie's wine department, said the
Germans who invaded Denmark in 1940 visited the castle but never
found the wine cellar.
   ``The family were afraid that the Germans would drink all their
wine so the entrance door was bricked up and there appeared to be
nothing behind the wall,'' he said.
   ``A secret entrance was made by digging a hole through the
kitchen floor next to the stove and constructing a shaft, covered
with a trapdoor concealed under a basket of logs.''
   Many of the wines had been undisturbed for decades after being
shipped to the castle in casks and bottled in the cellar by the
butler.
   The owner, Baron Johan-Otto Raben-Levetzau ``does not entertain
on the scale of his forebears and as the stock of older wines is
too large to be consumed by his family, and he needs more space, he
decided to thin out the older vintages dating from the late 19th
century,'' Broadbent said.

<HEAD>New Steel Trade Program Will Be in Place by Sunday, Bush Official
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration expects to reach its
deadline of having a new steel import restraint program with 29
nations in place by Sunday, a top trade official said Thursday.
   ``There will be a steel program as of Oct. 1,'' Deputy U.S.
Trade Representative Linn Williams told a conference of steel
manufacturers as the Bush administration was completing hurried
negotiations on the program.
   ``We may have some cleanup to do after Sept. 30, but we will
have a new program Oct. 1,'' Williams said.
   The program will replace a series of five-year, Reagan
administration steel trade pacts that expire Saturday.
   Negotiators in the office of U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills have been meeting this week to finalize pacts with the
European Community and other leading steel-exporting nations,
including Japan, South Korea and Mexico.
   Now, it is up to Congress to pass legislation implementing the
program. A bill containing President Bush's proposal to extend the
pacts passed the House Ways and Means Committee Wednesday, but has
yet to be considered by the full House or the Senate.
   ``Congress needs to get a new program enacted as soon as
possible to prevent steel-exporting countries from taking advantage
of the situation,'' said Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., a sponsor of
the bill. ``We don't want to send the world a signal that it is
alright to begin dumping steel in the U.S. again.''
   She said the sponsors have adopted an informal ``no-amendment''
rule because ``if we start to tinker with it again, the whole thing
could unravel.''
   The Reagan program lasted five years, but the scaled-down Bush
version only lasts 2{ years.
   U.S. Trade negotiators had a difficult time in 1984 getting some
steel-exporting nations to agree to annual, product-by-product
ceilings on the volume of steel to be shipped to the United States.
   Those negotiations took six months, but Williams said pact
renewals could be signed by Sunday even though trade
representatives were given only 45 days this time around.
   ``There is no country with which we are dealing that I am not
convinced will enter into a voluntary restraint agreement and a
consensus agreement on time,'' Williams said.
   In the consensus agreements, nations are being asked by the Bush
administration to commit to steps designed to remove government
subsidies or other barriers to free steel trade.
   Steel labor is backing the Bush program, but has doubts about
whether a meaningful consensus on free trade can be achieved.
   ``We have many reservations about whether that's possible,''
United Steelworkers President Lynn Williams said in an interview
Thursday. He is not related to his Bush administration namesake.
   The steelworkers had pushed for an extension of five years _ not
2{ _ of the product-by-product pacts. But the union leader said,
``We don't want to undercut the president's program. We'll wait and
see how it plays out.''

   Former Health, Education and Welfare Secretary
Arthur S. Flemming was honored Thursday as the first recipient of
the Pepper Distinguished Service Award, established in memory of
the late Rep. Claude Pepper.
   Flemming, 84, long has been an advocate for Social Security,
Medicare, civil rights and other causes. He served as HEW secretary
from 1958-61, U.S. Commissioner on Aging from 1973-78 and as
chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights from 1974-82. He
also chaired the first White House Conference on Aging in 1971.
   Flemming for seven years has headed the Save Our Security
Coalition, uniting more than 100 organizations seeking to protect
Social Security. He also is chairman of the National Health Care
Campaign, seeking comprehensive health-care and long-term care
protection for all Americans.
   The award was bestowed by the Mildred and Claude Pepper
Foundation, a non-profit organization established by Pepper in 1986
to support efforts to make lives longer, healthier and happier for
all Americans. Pepper, a Florida Democrat who was known as the
singular champion of senior citizens, died in May at age 88.

   Gen. Dimitri Yazov will get a taste of
America's old and new military next week when he takes the
first-ever tour of the United States by a defense minister from the
Soviet Union, officials said Thursday.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Yazov will be treated to a
tour of the Civil War battlefield at Gettysburg, Pa., as well as a
number of military installations during his Oct. 1-6 tour.
   Yazov, who arrives on Sunday, will wrap up his week in New York
on Friday, the spokesman said.
   The visit marks another in the series of high-level U.S.-Soviet
military exchanges that have occurred amid the warming of
superpower relations.
   Yazov and former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci met last year
in Switzerland in sessions that led to an exchange of visits
between the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William
Crowe Jr. and his counterpart, Gen. Sergei Akromeyev, to each
other's homelands.
   The defense minister's visit to the United States reciprocates a
visit Carlucci made to the Soviet Union in August 1988.
   Yazov is to be greeted at the Pentagon on Monday with a full
honors ceremony by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   The two men will conduct a round of bilateral meetings and Yazov
will remain at the Pentagon for lunch, Williams said.
   Williams cautioned that the general's schedule ``hasn't really
jelled yet,'' but said plans included a wreath-laying later in the
day at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery.
   The Soviet general also intends to visit the Naval Air Station
near San Diego and the Marine Corps training base at nearby Camp
Pendleton.
   Also on his agenda are Luke Air Force Base near Phoenix, Ariz.,
and Fort Bragg, N.C., the spokesman said.
   Williams said the Soviet general will be accompanied by his
wife, Emma, and several other high-level Soviet officials.

<HEAD>Two Sentenced to Life Imprisonment for Rioting During Protests</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with official comment; China denying
reporter's story of arrest, abuse. No pickup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two people were sentenced to life in prison and
three others to jail terms of five years to 12 years for
``hooliganism'' during rioting in the Chinese city of Xian this
spring, an official report said.
   Also Thursday, China said a French reporter's story of the
arrest and abuse of a student, which he told at a news conference
by China's top leaders, was an ``appalling lie'' and violated
journalistic ethics.
   The life sentences were given to Liu Gang and Sun Guanghu for
allegedly leading others to attack stores and the railroad station
during April riots, said the report in Wednesday's edition of the
Legal Daily.
   Three other people were given jail terms of five years to 12
years. The newspaper did not say when the sentencing took place or
give any details about the defendants.
   Liu Gang also is the name of a student on China's list of
most-wanted leaders of the spring pro-democracy movement. The Liu
Gang mentioned in the Legal Daily report is not believed to be the
same person.
   The provincial foreign affairs office, contacted by telephone,
said it did not know whether the court sentenced the student leader
or another man with the same name. The court refused comment.
   The Xian violence erupted shortly after a memorial ceremony for
ousted Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang, whose April 15 death
triggered massive student demonstrations.
   The newspaper said the five who were sentenced hurled stones and
bricks at buses and other vehicles during rioting.
   Sun, blowing on a whistle, led a group that attacked the train
station, while Liu incited others to destroy the Liberation Road
department store and 13 other private shops, the report said.
   In Beijing, thousands of people, including many students, were
arrested after troops crushed the seven-week democracy movement on
June 3-4. Chinese sources say some have been beaten in prison.
International rights groups such as Amnesty International have
appealed to China to release them as prisoners of conscience, and
say some may have been tortured and executed secretly.
   The official People's Daily party newspaper Thursday quoted
Beijing and Sichuan authorities as denying the story of French
reporter Eric Meyer of Les Dernieres Nouvelles d'Alsace.
   At a Tuesday news conference, Meyer said he knew of a Chinese
woman student wounded June 3 in the army attack, arrested and sent
to work in a brick factory in southwestern China's Sichuan
province, where she was raped three times by peasants.
   ``We feel strongly indignant at this French reporter, for he
dared to brazenly tell such a fabricated story before some 300
Chinese and foreign reporters in violation of the basic principle
of journalism that news reporting must be factual,'' the paper
quoted Beijing's deputy police director, Wang Dingfeng, as saying.
   It quoted Zheng Wenju, Sichuan justice department director, as
expressing ``his deep regret over the French reporter spreading
such an appalling lie.''
   Meyer said Thursday he stands by the story, but refused to say
how he learned of it.

   Rain spread over the Southeast on Thursday, with more than 4
inches at one Florida city, and record low temperatures continued
in the Northeast.
   Thunderstorms poured rain on northeastern Florida for much of
the day, causing flooding in Jacksonville, the National Weather
Service said.
   By midafternoon, Jacksonville had gotten 4.28 inches of rain
since midnight, including 3.56 inches in the six hours up to 2 p.m.
EDT. That made a total of 5.48 inches at Jacksonville since noon
Wednesday.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended over the Tennessee
Valley, from Florida and Georgia across the lower Mississippi
Valley, and scattered along the Texas Gulf Coast.
   During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 1.48 inches of rain fell
at Marietta, Ga., and Meridian, Miss., got 1.37 inches.
   Elsewhere, showers reached from eastern South Dakota into
northwestern Iowa and southwestern Minnesota. And light showers
extended over southwestern California.
   Afternoon temperatures were only in the upper 50s and 60s across
New England. But more seasonable temperatures were expected during
the night and Friday morning, when readings were expected to be 10
to 15 degrees warmer than Thursday morning.
   Record lows Thursday included 40 in Baltimore; 30 in Binghamton,
N.Y.; and 32 in Toledo, Ohio. Mansfield, Ohio, tied its record of
36 and Pittsburgh tied its record of 34.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 47
degrees in Caribou, Maine, to 99 in Palm Springs, Calif., and Yuma,
Ariz. Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 24 in Houlton,
Maine.

<HEAD>Commonwealth Lobbying Banks to Cut off Loans to South Africa</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Shridath Ramphal, secretary-general of the
48-nation British Commonwealth, said Thursday that a delegation
from Australia, Canada and India is lobbying international banks to
cut off loans to South Africa.
   In another development, former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm
Fraser said Commonwealth leaders have indicated he is the leading
candidate to succeed Ramphal in June, ahead of Nigerian Chief Emeka
Anyaoku.
   This conflicted with reports by Commonwealth secretariat sources
that Anyaoku is virtually certain to get the job.
   On South Africa, Ramphal said the Commonwealth will continue to
press for tough embargoes. But he indicated it will not try at its
biennial summit meeting in Malaysia next month to impose new
measures _ thus avoiding a dispute with Britain.
   ``The Commonwealth (Britain apart) will continue to use the
pressure of sanctions to persuade South Africa to end apartheid,
and to mobilize wider international support to this end,'' said
Ramphal.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is the sole leader in
the mainly African, Asian and Caribbean association of Britain and
its former colonies who publicly opposes tough measures against
South Africa, a major trading partner of Britain.
   She says sanctions would hurt blacks most, invite cheating and
harden white South African resistance to change.
   Addressing a luncheon given by Commonwealth journalists, Ramphal
added, ``I don't think the time is ripe for the introduction of a
new package of sanctions, but for sending a clear message that they
can be expected if there is no evidence of clear progress.''
   Instead, Ramphal said, the Commonwealth is concentrating on
getting banks to refuse to reschedule South Africa's foreign debt.
   South Africa's repayment agreement on $8 billion of foreign debt
expires next June and government and banking officials are battling
for new agreements.
   At a news conference at the Australian High Commission, Fraser
said ``a hard-headed and unsentimental count'' by Australian
missions and another major supporter put him ahead in the contest
for Ramphal's job.
   Answering a question, he said Canada backed him, but declined to
identify other supporters.
   He added he had ``significant support'' in Africa. ``A number of
African countries have told me they want to make a decision on the
man, not on a regional basis,'' said Fraser.
   Commonwealth leaders are to decide on the new secretary-general
during their meeting in Malaysia.
   Anyaoku is a deputy to Ramphal, a Guyanese who has held the job
for 15 years.
   Commonwealth secretariat sources who requested anonymity
maintain Anyaoku, who would be the first African Commonwealth
secretary-general, has a strong lead, including backing from almost
all African and Caribbean members.

<HEAD>Serbians Denounce Slovenian Constitutional Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SLOBODAN LEKIC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of angry Serbs
rallied on Thursday to denounce the Slovenian republic's adoption
of major changes in its regional constitution, including the right
to secede.
   The Yugoslav parliament asked the Supreme Court Thursday to rule
urgently on whether the amendments were allowed under the federal
constitution.
   The changes, adopted by the Slovenian parliament on Wednesday,
give that small northern state the right to secede from the
six-republic federation and to control use of the Yugoslav military
in Slovenia in peacetime.
   In the southern republic of Serbia, at least 10,000 people
rallied in Novi Sad, 50 miles north of Belgrade, to hear speakers
describe Slovenia's action as ``a lunatic act of hatred'' and
``high treason.''
   ``The integrity of this country will be defended by armed force
if necessary,'' one speaker told a cheering crowd.
   The gathering was broadcast live by state television.
   An additional 15,000 Serbs protested in the town of Leskovac,
and ``hundreds'' of other rallies were held elsewhere throughout
Serbia, the official Tanjug news agency said.
   The meetings were organized by supporters of the Serbian
communist leadership, which advocates more central control in the
country.
   The amendments in Slovenia pave the way for introduction of a
Western-style multiparty democracy in the state, where independent
opposition parties have already been formed. Slovenia borders on
Italy and Austria.
   The federal constitution's preamble also stipulates the right to
self-determination and the right of individual republics to secede,
without specifying how this could be achieved.
   Slovenian authorities have stressed they do not intend to secede
and that the changes only provide ``an added sense of security''
for the 2 million Slovenes, who make up about 8 percent of
Yugoslavia's population.
   Joze Smole, head of the communist-led Socialist Alliance of
Slovenia, told the Belgrade daily Borba, ``Not a single Slovene
wishes the republic to secede from Yugoslavia.''
   Up to 50,000 people demonstrated on Wednesday in the southern
republic of Montenegro, demanding the Slovenian leadership be
``toppled.''
   The protests appeared similar to those preceding imposition of a
state of emergency last February in Serbia's Kosovo province, where
ethnic Albanians make up 85 percent of the population.
   That measure was immediately followed by a constitutional change
limiting Kosovo's autonomy and giving Serbia a greater say in its
affairs. Subsequent ethnic Albanian riots left 24 people dead.
   The Slovenian Delo daily said Thursday that to opponents, ``We
can only say: we are Yugoslavs but we are Slovenes first ... and
the constitutional changes reflect our national interests.''
   Yugoslavia has a decentralized system of government and
collective federal presidency, fashioned in 1974 to keep one
republic from gaining sway over the others, but resulting in an
ineffective government by compromise.

   Bush administration officials
apologized for federal drug policy coordinator William Bennett's
dismissive assessment of governors' remarks at the education
summit, Gov. Terry Branstad said Thursday.
   ``A number of (administration) people expressed regret that the
secretary was somewhat flip in his remarks,'' said Branstad,
Republican governor of Iowa.
   ``I think Mr. Bennett went overboard with some of his statements
and that was the general consensus among both the administration
people and the governors,'' he said. He didn't name any officials.
   Bennett, who headed the Education Department during the Reagan
administration, was moderator Wednesday of a closed session on
``The Learning Environment'' with a number of governors. Later, he
joined several governors in publicly summing up what had been
discussed.
   ``There was pap _ standard Democratic pap. There was standard
Republican pap, and there was stuff that rhymes with pap on both
sides too,'' he said.
   Bennett added, ``Much of the discussion took place in total
absence of any knowledge of what works or what's effective in the
actual experience of school. ... Some people were saying things
that other people had written for them, and they were reading them
out of books and reading them off cards.''

   Police mediated a truce between armed
residents of a drug-ridden neighborhood and alleged crack cocaine
dealers after simmering tensions erupted into a cross-street
gunbattle, officers said Thursday.
   The truce, in which neighbors agreed to put firearms away and
drug dealers agreed to keep dealing off the street, has brought a
measure of calm to the nervous Hilltop neighborhood.
   Police said the two sides exchanged 300 shots Saturday during an
anti-drug block party at the home of Army Ranger Staff Sgt. Bill
Foulk, who summoned 11 off-duty Rangers as reinforcements.
   No one was injured, however, until the next day when fistfights
broke out and some neighbors suffered scrapes and bruises from
thrown bricks. Only two arrests were made Saturday, both of alleged
gang members, although the Rangers' weapons were confiscated.
   Patrol Officer Lee Giles, who helped arrange the meeting
Wednesday that led to the truce, said the alleged drug dealers
``agreed that selling of drugs on the street or in the area was
unacceptable'' and would stop.
   For their part, Foulk and his neighbors agreed not to use
weapons.
   ``I don't want to say we're friends yet, but it's a start,''
Foulk said.
   ``We won't be in the open selling drugs,'' said Robert Brown,
who negotiated with Foulk and his neighbors on behalf of the youths
and alleged drug dealers on the block.
   Telephone numbers were exchanged and both parties said they
would try to talk out any disagreements, Giles said.
   ``All the people involved felt it was better to talk than
shoot,'' said police Sgt. Steve Smith, another mediator.
   Foulks and neighbor John Harper said their key concession was to
realize that neighbors cannot stop drug dealing entirely.
   ``All we can hope to do is get the drug dealing off the street _
the violence associated with it _ so we can start to feel safe,''
Foulk said.
   Police participation does not mean they are sanctioning drug
sales on or off the street, Giles said.
   ``We're not so naive as to say we're going to stop all drug
sales,'' he said. ``Let's be real. But at least we're giving them
the message we will not condone that.''
   ``We're still going to go after them as aggressively as we
can,'' added police spokesman Mark Mann. ``If they think we're
going to back off because they've moved inside, they're wrong.''
   Foulk, 32, and his fellow negotiators said a key to the
agreement will be Brown's ability to convince his side to abide by
the terms.
   Brown, 28, said the residents ``made it plain and clear they
were going to keep on fighting'' if the dealers did not leave the
street.
   Mayor Doug Sutherland said the terms of the agreement are
``certainly different,'' but praised the unusual pact.
   Fort Lewis officials, where the Rangers are stationed, said they
would not take action against their personnel involved and leave
the matter to local authorities.

<HEAD>Bush Complains About Gephardt As Reporters Listen</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Capital Gains, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, unaware that reporters were
listening to his phone conversation, complained Thursday that House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt turned the fight over a
capital-gains cut into a ``personal'' battle.
   ``I tell you, I'm displeased with Gephardt, the way he made it
so personal,'' Bush said in a telephone conversation with Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas.
   Archer, who took the call in the House Radio-TV Gallery, quickly
interrupted Bush.
   ``Mr. President, I must tell you I'm in the press gallery right
now with a whole lot of reporters so I think you should be alerted
to that,'' said Archer, a sponsor of the successful capital-gains
cut.
   ``But just so they can hear you and not me,'' Bush said.
   ``I'm afraid they're hearing you, too,'' Archer laughed.
   ``Oh, well. They will _ er, uh _ this is not a personal thing.
This is a very important thing for the country ... But in any
event, well done.''
   Gephardt, D-Mo., argued against the tax cut on grounds 80
percent of the benefit would go to those with incomes over $100,000
a year. He declined to comment on Bush's complaint.

   Israel outlawed the radical Islamic
fundamentalist movement Hamas on Thursday, and announced it will
bar the 700,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip from entering Israel
during the Jewish New Year holiday.
   Troops shot and killed a Palestinian in the West Bank town of
Nablus during a stone-throwing confrontation and wounded 17 others
in clashes in the Gaza Strip, Arab reports said.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   The death of Bilal Einab, 20, brought to 575 the number of Arabs
killed by Israeli troops or civilians since the start of the
Palestinian uprising in December 1987. An additional 121
Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of
collaborating with Israel. Forty Israelis have died.
   Also Thursday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin picked up a key
endorsement amid growing signs he may be able to unseat Finance
Minister Shimon Peres as leader of the left-leaning Labor Party.
   Rabin, 67, who was prime minister from 1974-77, won backing from
Labor Party doves Ely Ben-Menachem and Ezer Weizman, the science
minister.
   The leadership issue is unlikely to come to a head unless
Labor's coalition with the right-wing Likud bloc breaks apart _
likely only with serious movement toward Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations.
   Hamas emerged soon after the start of the revolt, spreading its
influence from Gaza to parts of the West Bank. The movement
advocates an Islamic state including the occupied lands and Israel.
   ``This movement has a religious character, is very radical and
is using very cruel means. It pledged violent struggle not only
against Israel but also against Judaism and Zionism,'' said Shmuel
Goren, Israel's coordinator for the occupied territories.
   The army announced a three-day closure of the Gaza Strip from
Friday through Monday during Rosh Hashana, the New Year holiday.
Security throughout the country will be reinforced over the weekend.
   Also Thursday, Palestinian activist Faisal Husseini warned the
uprising will intensify if peace efforts fail, but he rejected the
idea of armed struggle.
   Husseini and three other prominent Palestinians, speaking on a
panel, also said the 10-point Egyptian peace plan, aimed at ending
the impasse over Israel's peace initiative, does not go far enough
in pressing for Palestinian independence.
   ``We are ready to deal with any proposal, we are ready to start
any negotiations if we will be addressed as a people, not as a
minority or as refugees or as inhabitants of a certain place,'' he
said.
   Husseini, a pro-PLO activist, told the forum sponsored by the
Foreign Press Association that if peace efforts fail, ``We will
escalate our struggle. We will cover more areas, cover more
people.''
   But ``we will not be provoked. The Israelis will not push us to
use weapons,'' Husseini said.
   He and the other activists said the Palestinians were ready to
open peace talks with Israel but criticized the Israeli
government's peace initiative and the plan put forward by Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
   The Israeli government has called for elections in the occupied
territories to select Palestinians to open talks with Israel on an
interim period of self-rule.
   Mubarak, in an effort to overcome Palestine Liberation
Organization objections to the Israeli plan, has urged Israel to
hold preliminary talks with a delegation including Palestinians
from outside the territories, and to consider accepting the
U.S.-backed formula of trading land for peace. There is opposition
in Israel to both moves.
   The Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq, meanwhile, charged in
a statement that tax raids in the Wst Bank town of Beit Sahour by
army troops were ``blatantly illegal'' and conducted with
``extraordinary ... savagery and violence.''
   Troops have been entering homes in Beit Sahour, a town of about
5,000 people near Bethlehem, and confiscating goods since Sept. 20
in lieu of unpaid taxes.
   A PLO-ordered tax boycott has been widely observed in Beit
Sahour, a hotbed of activism against Israeli occupation. Residents
closed shops and offices Thursday at the start of a three-day
strike to protest the raids.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress passed and sent to the White House on
Thursday a stopgap spending bill to keep government agencies in
business while lawmakers continue work on appropriations bills for
the new budget year.
   The measure, which has the support of the White House as well as
both the House and Senate, continues funding for these agencies
through Oct. 25.
   The Senate passed the measure on a 100-0 vote after the House
had approved it 274-152 earlier in the week. Because the Senate
attached an amendment providing $1.1 billion in disaster relief for
areas stricken by Hurricane Hugo, the measure had to go back to the
House for final approval. Lawmakers there passed the bill by voice
vote.
   The temporary spending measure had to be passed because Congress
has been immersed in an array of disputes that have kept lawmakers
from finishing work on the 13 annual appropriations bills for
fiscal 1990, which begins Sunday.
   The Senate also passed, on a 92-8 vote, a $67.2 million measure
financing federal housing, veterans, space and environmental
programs in the new budget year. The measure also provides $1.85
billion for NASA's space station project.
   One key element of the bill was an amendment boosting the price
ceiling on home mortgages the Federal Housing Administration can
insure. Adoption of the measure increased the current $101,250
limit to $124,875.
   Voting against the bill were Sens. William Armstrong, R-Colo.;
Alan Dixon, D-Ill.; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.;
Robert Kasten, R-Wis.; William Roth, R-Del.; Steve Symms, R-Idaho,
and Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.

   Here are excerpts from President
Bush's speech to the nation's governors Thursday, the final day of
their education summit at the University of Virginia:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   It's easy to keep your perspective and be humble at a school so
rich in history and in educational endeavor. And I've also been
deeply impressed by the commitment, the creativity and the
knowledge that my fellow chief executives bring here to this
education reform agenda.
   In our meetings yesterday, I learned exactly how much you care
about the children of your states and the future. And in short, I
came to Charlottesville with high expectations, and I've got to say
you have exceeded them.
   So the spirit of our summit is not who will get the credit. The
spirit of this summit is, how can we get results? We're here to put
progress before partisanship, the future before the moment, and our
children before ourselves.
   I've heard eloquent advice from many of you and from so many
others in the last few weeks, and I've listened, and I am deeply
appreciative of all that I have learned. But I've also learned that
we should listen to our children, and they have much to tell us.
   In many ways, they are the luckiest generation in history. Just
last month, our children observed, in the clarity of Voyager's
sight, the horizons of new worlds, the majesty of space. And think
what these images would have meant to the ever curious founder of
this university, who could only look through a primitive telescope
at faint patches of light and wonder.
   But our children are growing up in an age where wonder is
commonplace, peace and prosperity often taken for granted. And our
children are also the beneficiaries of a nation that lavishes
unsurpassed resources on their schooling. So, in many ways, we're
close to fulfilling the enlightenment dream of universal education,
a dream that became a reality in the shadows of the Shenandoahs
here at Mr. Jefferson's school.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   So, let us make this an education society. We've already come
close to this Jeffersonian ideal. Our educational system is, in
many ways, unrivaled in its scale and its diversity and its
commitment to meeting special needs and individual differences. And
we're inspired by our best teachers who give more than we can
rightly expect and from our best students who surpass our highest
expectations.
   And yet, after two centuries of progress, we are stagnant. While
millions of Americans read for pleasure, millions of others don't
read at all. And while millions go to college, millions may never
graduate from high school. The national assessment of educational
progress estimates that fewer than one in four of our high school
juniors can write an adequate persuasive letter, and only half can
manage decimals, fractions, and percentages, and barely one in
three can locate the Civil War in the correct half century.
   No modern nation can long afford to allow so many of its sons
and daughters to emerge into adulthood ignorant and unskilled. The
status quo is a guarantee of mediocrity, social decay, and national
decline. Education is our most enduring legacy, vital to everything
that we are and can become. And come the next century, just ten
years away, what will we be? Will we be the children of
enlightenment, or its orphans?
   Six years ago, the Committee on Excellence in Education issued
its powerful report, and yet today, our nation is still at risk.
The educational reform movement has done well in articulating its
criticisms, and now it is time to define goals. This is the time
for action.
   I sent my proposals for federal action in education to Congress
last spring, including an increase in funding for Head Start. The
Educational Excellence Act of 1989 includes ways to reshape and
expand federal efforts, to recognize excellence, lift the needy,
foster flexibility and choice, and measure and reward progress.
   I remain solidly committed to these principles, and I value your
advice and ideas as we continue to refine the federal role. Some
offer a completely different answer _ spend more money alone. And
at the federal level, we have asked Congress to provide nearly half
a billion dollars in new funding for ten worthy programs.
   Your states may also choose to spend more. But to those who say
that money alone is the answer, I say that there is no one answer.
If anything, hard experience teaches that we are simply not getting
our money's worth in education. Our focus must no longer be on
resources; it must be on results.
   And this is only the third time in our 200 years as a nation
that a president has called a summit with the governors. And I've
called you together, because you bear the constitutional
responsibility for education. And I didn't ask you to such an
historic occasion merely to bemoan what is wrong. We are here to
work, and work together, to once again make an American education
the best in the world.
   And let me say to the governors, before this majestic audience,
these sessions have been informative and thoughtful, and very
useful to me. And I appreciate the obvious extensive preparations
that the governors have undertaken in the days and weeks leading up
to this summit.
   The governors have emphasized to me the need for national
performance goals and the importance of greater flexibility in the
use of federal funds, while accepting enhanced accountability for
the results. And they've also stressed the high priority that
helping prepare preschool children should have in federal spending,
even in time of fiscal constraint.
   And finally, the governors have articulated eloquently the need
to restructure our education system. You already are consulting
with state legislators to better our schools. Our teachers already
are giving their heart and soul to their jobs. But we've never
before worked together, president and principal, governor and
teacher, to achieve results in education.
   A social compact begins today in Charlottesville, Va., a compact
between parents, teachers, principals, superintendents, state
legislators, governors and the administration. Our compact is
founded not on promises, but on challenges, each one a radical
departure from tradition. I hope that you will join me to define
national goals in education for the first time. From this day
forward, let us be an America of tougher standards, of higher
goals, and a land of bigger dreams.

   U.S. Jewish organizations on Thursday
protested the granting of visas to three Palestine Liberation
Organization leaders to attend the U.N. General Assembly this year.
   ``The three PLO representatives who have received visas are
among the most radical members of the PLO leadership,'' said a
statement from the Conference of Presidents of Major American
Jewish Organizations.
   ``Their record of terrorist activity and rejectionist statements
makes clear that they come not in the cause of peace, but of
propaganda,'' the statement said.
   The visas, granted by the State Department, were announced
Wednesday and diplomats said they expected PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat also to apply for a visa. The approval of visas for Arafat's
lieutenants, they said, increases the likelihood that Arafat will
be allowed to visit.
   After he was denied a visa last year, the 159-nation General
Assembly in protest moved to Geneva for a special session to hear
Arafat. From that podium he announced the renunciation of terrorism
and recognition of Israel's right to exist _ demands made by the
United States.
   On Thursday, however, the Jewish organizations said his
representatives _ Farouk Kaddoumi, Yasser Abed Rabbu and Sulim
Najib _ have been involved in terrorist acts and called for the
destruction of Israel.
   Seymour D. Reich, chairman of the conference, said: ``These are
not the words or deeds of peacemakers, but rather of violent men.
... That they should have been chosen to represent the PLO confirms
once more that the PLO remains committed to its (stated) goal'' of
purging Israel from the region.
   The conference is an umbrella group representing such
organizations as Hadassah, B'nai Brith, the American Jewish
Congress.
   The statement of protest was sent to the State Department.

   Southern Democrats provided the margin of
victory Thursday as the House rejected an effort by its Democratic
leaders to derail a capital gains tax cut.
   Southerners accounted for 42 of the 64 Democrats who joined with
a nearly solid bloc of Republicans in a 239-190 vote to defeat the
leadership plan to replace the capital gains tax cut with expanded
deductions for Individual Retirement Accounts financed by higher
taxes on the wealthy.
   The winning coalition was similar to the one that enacted many
of former President Reagan's economic programs. But Southerners who
supported President Bush in the capital gains fight were quick to
reject the boll weevil label that was applied to Southern Democrats
who backed Reagan eight years ago.
   ``I'm not even a member of the boll weevils,'' said Rep. Ed
Jenkins, D-Ga., one of the authors of the capital gains tax cut in
the House Ways and Means Committee. ``You'd have to call me a
liberal boll weevil.''
   Jenkins said the capital gains reduction had broad support among
both conservative and moderate Democrats, and the leadership
alternative failed because it didn't address that issue.
   ``There are a large number of Democrats who simply are not going
to vote for a tax increase,'' he said, ``and the alternative had
nothing to do with capital gains. That was the real weakness of
their proposal.''
   Rep. Ronnie Flippo, D-Ala., another sponsor of the capital gains
proposal, said moderate and conservative Democrats supported it as
``a pro-growth, pro-jobs issue'' even though it put them at odds
with party leaders and aligned them with Bush, who had promised
such a tax cut during his campaign.
   ``We did it because we thought it was the right policy and
because we thought the leadership was going in the wrong
direction,'' Flippo said. ``We're going to continue to do
everything we can to see that the Democratic Party at least
considers a more conservative viewpoint.''
   Rep. Ben Jones, D-Ga., said the leadership made a mistake in
trying to portray the capital gains issue as a tax break for the
wealthy.
   ``This was a main street issue,'' he said. ``The people I've
been hearing from on this are not the country club people, they're
the barber shop people. ... The leadership misjudged it.''
   Voting for the capital gains reduction were eight of the nine
Democrats from Georgia, four of five from Alabama, three of four
from Louisiana, three of four from Mississippi, all four from
Kentucky, three of four from South Carolina, both from Arkansas,
and half of the 18 from Texas.
   Southern support for the leadership position was concentrated in
North Carolina and Florida, where seven of eight Democrats in each
state opposed the tax cut; in Virginia, where three of five opposed
it; and in Tennessee, where four of six opposed it.
   Jones said many of the Southern Democrats who voted for the
capital gains reduction represent districts dominated by ``small
farmers, timber interests and people with a little bit of real
estate.''
   ``These are the very people we've been losing'' in presidential
elections, he said. ``We're an inclusive party, why not include
some successful people?''

<HEAD>Suit Seeks to Halt Launch of Nuclear-Powered Space Probe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three citizens' groups, claiming ``a potential
disaster in the making over Florida,'' filed suit Thursday to
prevent the launch of a nuclear-powered probe on the space shuttle
next month.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, contends an accident
during the launch of the nuclear-powered Galileo space probe could
spread poisonous plutonium over a heavily populated area of Florida.
   ``There's a potential disaster in the making over Florida,''
Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, said
at a news conference. ``We are determined that that will not take
place.''
   Bruce Gagnon of the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice said
that if the lawsuit is not successful, his organization plans ``to
put people into the launch area to sit on top of the launch pad in
an effort to stop the launch.''
   The other group filing the suit was the Christic Institute.
   NASA plans to send Galileo into space aboard the space shuttle
Atlantis on Oct. 12. Once in orbit, Galileo is to rocket itself on
a round-about voyage to Jupiter. The probe is to circle Venus once
and the Earth twice before streaking away from the sun toward
Jupiter.
   Powering the craft are two radioisotope thermoelectric
generators. Each of the RTGs are energized by 24.7 pounds of
plutonium-238. The radioactive decay of the nuclear material
produces heat which is converted to electricity.
   The lawsuit calls plutonium ``a deadly carcinogen.'' It said the
Galileo project will condemn thousands of eastern Florida residents
``to a wholly unnecessary and virtual certainty of contracting
cancer'' if a shuttle launch accident, similar to the one that
destroyed Challenger in 1986, caused the plutonium to be vaporized
and spread over the area.
   A press release from Rifkin's group claimed that NASA has said
there was a 1-in-430 chance of radioactive contamination from a
shuttle accident and that a release of plutonium could cause
thousands of fatal cancers.
   In a statement, NASA spokesman Dave Garrett said the group's
news release ``contains several glaring inaccuracies.''
   ``The fact is that the highest probability of launch area
release of plutonium due to a shuttle accident is less than
1-in-2,500,'' the NASA statement said. It also said such a release
would have no appreciable adverse health effects on the population.
   The suit claims that NASA did not comply with all provisions of
the National Evironmental Policy Act in compiling an environmental
impact statement on the Galileo launch. It asks the court to block
the launch until the agency has ``prepared a final environmental
impact statement for the project that fully complies'' with the law.
   Garrett said NASA has not seen copies of the lawsuit, but the
space agency's statement notes: ``The approval to launch the
Galileo spacecraft followed lengthly evaluations of the risk, the
results of which are on the public record. The processes were
followed to the letter. We are confident that the mission will be
carried out without incident.''
   The suit asks for ``temporary, preliminary and permanent
injunctive relief'' in stopping the launch, and Rifkin said expects
quick action from U.S. District Court Judge Oliver Gasch.
   Rifkin said the groups hope to delay the launch by at least 18
months. This, he said, would give NASA time to investigate
alternate means of launching Galileo, such as with an unmanned
rocket from a remote site, or to find other ways of powering the
craft.
   Lanny Sinkin of the Christic Institute said that putting
plutonium on Galileo was part of a process by the government and by
industry to put nuclear fuel into space. He said the lawsuit will
force NASA to find means to power deep-space probes other than the
use of nuclear material.
   Garrett said that the nuclear RTGs were ``the only things that
made any sense'' in powering Galileo.

   Democratic and Republican governors
alike hailed plans mapped out Thursday at the education summit to
cut federal red tape and rejuvenate America's schools, but a few
grumbled that the gathering largely ducked the issue of federal
money.
   Several, including California Gov. George Deukmejian and New
Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean, both Republicans, said the ``education
establishment'' might fight to keep the status quo and resist many
of the changes discussed at the two-day summit between President
Bush and the nation's governors.
   Bush's address Thursday, in which he promised to ask Congress to
``loosen the grip of federal restrictions,'' was praised as ``one
of the best speeches I've ever heard him deliver'' by New York
Democratic Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez said the summit marked a radical
change in how educational problems are viewed.
   ``It's a change from measuring education by how much we spend to
what we're getting for how much we've invested,'' said Martinez, a
Republican.
   ``Everyone felt that the president's message was well-crafted
and well-delivered and it set the right tone,'' said Deukmejian.
   He predicted there would be no difficulty in drafting concrete
national education goals by the February meeting of the National
Governors' Association.
   ``The difficulty,'' he said, ``is that many people in the
education community resist change. They like the status quo. The
difficulty is going to be that there is going to have to be some
restructuring, some accountability, some redirecting of funds, to
meet the primary objectives.''
   ``It cannot be business as usual,'' he said.
   Even with cooperation from educators, he predicted it would take
10 years to achieve the reform aims outlined at the summit.
   ``They were saying, `Look, Mr. President, if this is so
important, if education is such a national policy, at least don't
reduce what the federal government is doing in funding,''
Deukmejian said.
   Tennessee Gov. Ned Ray McWherter, a Democrat, said governors
were generally pleased at the prospect that the summit might lead
to eliminating needless federal rules that made certain educational
programs inflexible.
   ``I believe you can trust local people to run the education
system,'' he said.
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, also a Democrat, said the jury was
still out on whether Bush had earned the title ``education
president'' and said the administration had ``painted itself in a
corner'' by foreclosing the possibility of stepped-up federal
funding for schools.
   ``The president would have been better served if somebody had
said, `Look Mr. President, we can do without these three stealth
bombers, and we put them in your pocket, and you come in and at an
appropriate moment you identify where you think in 1990 a new
federal investment can galvanize this reform agenda.''
   Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas said, ``I want to thank
President Bush for giving us the chance for the governors after
seven hard years of work on education reform, to have a real
national partnership in education.''
   Gov. William O'Neill of Connecticut, also a Democrat, said, ``It
was a first, it was important, the problem has been recognized.''
   Kean of New Jersey said, ``I'm reinvigorated. This is really
exciting, this idea that the president of the United States is
going to lead the way toward a restructuring of the schools which
is vital and very difficult to do.''
   But he warned that fundamental change would be resisted by some
educators.
   ``If the people involved in education oppose and stand in the
way, it will be difficult and time consuming to get any of these
things accomplished. We've got to now bring along the people in the
system. There is still a great body within the education profession
who say, ``It's certainly fine in my school, it's certainly fine in
my classroom.'
   ``For those of us who believe that everything is not fine,
that's an attitude that's got to be changed,'' he said.

   Congress on Thursday approved $1.1 billion in
emergency aid for the victims of Hurricane Hugo, Capitol Hill's
largest disaster-relief package ever. The White House said
President Bush will sign the legislation, perhaps when he visits
South Carolina on Friday.
   ``There never was this much money,'' said Bill McAda, a
spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ``But this
also may well be the most damaging one (hurricane) in history.''
   The aid was attached to a stopgap spending resolution intended
to keep government agencies operating when the new fiscal year
begins Sunday. The spending measure passed the Senate on a 100 to 0
and cleared the House by voice vote.
   ``I have never seen so much damage in my life,'' Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., told his colleagues before the vote. ``It looked
there had been a war there. ... We need all the help we can get.''
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Bush would fly to South Carolina Friday to get a first-hand look at
the devastation left in the wake of Hugo's passing a week ago and
may sign the legislation while he is there.
   Fitzwater said the president wanted ``to make sure that all that
can be done is being done'' and to assure the people of South
Carolina that Gov. Carroll Campbell will provide ``whatever help we
can.''
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., had said Wednesday that damage in
his state was closer to $3 billion to $4 billion but that getting
that amount would be impossible without forcing across-the-board
federal budget cuts.
   McAda said the aid cannot go for home or business repairs to
people who have insurance. But he did say that the assistance
provides for loans of up to $10,000 for people ``who have needs and
cannot qualify for (private) loans for some reason or other.''
   Fitzwater defended the emergency relief agency against
accusations by Hollings that help was being help up in ``red tape.''
   The presidential spokesman said that ``Hollings' job is to keep
the pressure on'' and said government agents were fighting
``remarkable odds'' in the relief effort.
   ``We think things are going pretty well,'' he said. Asked if
Bush might help cut red tape that is hindering the cleanup,
Fitzwater said, ``If there is any _ yes. We'll take a look at
that.''
   In South Carolina, Campbell said people planning Bush's trip
Friday were trying to arrange for the president to see devastated
areas on the coast as well as inland. Possible stops include Myrtle
Beach, Charleston and Sumter.

<HEAD>DNC Chair `Disappointed' in Number of Defectors on Capital Gains
Issue</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Capital Gains, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Party chairman Ronald H. Brown,
insisting his party still must get tough with the president, said
Thursday he was ``disappointed'' with the number of House Democrats
who sided with President Bush on his proposal to cut capital gains
taxes.
   But Brown, who had called the Bush proposal ``a tax giveaway to
the ultra rich,'' said the House defectors from their party
leadership ``are certainly good Democrats, they are certainly
Democrats we are proud to have as members of our party.''
   Forty six Democrats sided with the president on the capital
gains vote, which occurred while the Democratic National Committee
was meeting across town and hearing Brown excoriate Bush for a lack
of leadership and a continuation of ``the ethic of greed.''
   After the House vote, Brown said, ``I think it's very important
that we draw the line, that we make the distinctions, that we make
choices.''
   In his speech to the DNC, Brown called on Bush to begin
``matching his actions to his charming words.''
   Brown attacked the Bush anti-drug program as ``big words
followed by limited action. ... They declared war and decided
somebody else is going to have to find the bullets.''
   Some of his harshest rhetoric was directed at the plan to cut
tax rates on capital gains, which he called a ``massive, needless
tax break to the wealthiest 1 percent _ a giveaway that will cost
working Americans billions.''
   But the chairman sidestepped any confrontation with the
Democrats who supported Bush.
   He called capital gains ``a tough vote'' and said, ``Many of the
members who didn't vote with the (Democratic) leadership position
thought they were doing what was in the best interests of their
constituents.''
   ``I am not here to criticize Democrats,'' he said.
   During their meeting, the Democrats undid key elements of the
agreement reached between Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson at the
party's 1988 convention.
   The DNC voted to restore its members to their status as
unpledged delegates to nominating conventions. The body also voted
to require that any future convention deals be ratified by the DNC.
   Brown, who was Jackson's chief negotiator at the 1988
convention, supported the changes and said he also would back a
requirement that presidential candidates receive a minimum of 15
percent of the vote in primaries and caucuses to qualify for
receiving delegates. Part of the Jackson-Dukakis deal was a rules
change that eliminated thresholds.
   The DNC also elected former Louisiana Democratic Party chair
Kathy Vick to succeed Dorothy Bush as party secretary.
   Mrs. Bush retired after 46 years in the office, which placed her
in the spotlight every four years when she called the roll of the
states on the ballot for the presidential nomination.
   The Democrats also announced that seven cities are the finalists
to host the 1992 Democratic National Convention. They are New York,
Houston, Detroit, Cleveland-Brook Park, New Orleans, Miami Beach
and Seattle.
   Party officials also had expected Atlanta, site of the 1988
convention, to bid, but city officials notified the Democrats they
would not enter the competition.

<HEAD>Diesel Fuel Spilled At South Pole, Agency Reports</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A leaky pipe spilled 44,000 gallons of diesel
fuel into the snow at an American station at the South Pole, but is
not expected to cause any environmental damage, the National
Science Foundation said Thursday.
   Jeffrey Norris, an NSF spokesman, confirmed in response to an
inquiry that the fuel leak was discovered on Aug. 21 by personnel
spending the Antarctic winter at the United States' Amundsen-Scott
South Pole station.
   He said the fuel drained down through the snow and is expected
to be trapped against an ice layer 150 feet below the surface.
Environmental impact, said the spokesman, is expected to be
``minimal.''
   ``There are no plants or wildlife in the area to be affected,''
Norris said.
   Norris said the spill represented no health hazard to personnel
at the station and noted, ``There is no immediate plan to clean it
up.''
   Antarctica now is in the midst of deep winter cold, with
temperatures continuously staying far below zero.
   Norris said the 20 scientists and technicians wintering at the
station started searching for a leak in July when measurements
showed that nine fuel tanks at the station were being drained
faster than could be explained by ordinary usage. The diesel is
used to operate generators.
   The leak was found in a pipe that carries the fuel from the
storage tanks to the power generators, Norris said.
   NSF officials made no public announcement of the spill, but
Norris said the incident was reported to the U.S. Department of
State. The Antarctic is controlled by an international treaty, and
the National Science Foundation is operates the U.S. outposts at
the bottom of the world.
   The Amundsen-Scott station sits on 9,200 feet of snow, and is
the only outpost at the South Pole.
   Norris said the incident is the second major spill of diesel
fuel at the South Pole station. In 1975, 22,000 gallons of diesel
fuel escaped into the snow when a storage tank collapsed.

   The General Assembly made an 11th-hour
appeal asking South Africa to commute the death sentence of a black
man scheduled to be hanged Friday for murder.
   According to U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, Mangena
Jeffrey Boesman was convicted of burning to death a black woman in
her 50s, apparently because she took her children to school during
a 1985 strike against school attendance.
   By a 149-0 vote Thursday, member nations called on South Africa
to commute his death sentence and use their influence with Pretoria
on his behalf.
   The United States and Britain abstained, the first time in the
current assembly that they have been out of step with the rest of
the international community.
   Pickering said Washington distinquishes between political
prisoners and those convicted of non-political crimes.
   ``There can be no circumstances in which a violent murder such
as the one in this case _ what has come to be called `necklacing' _
could be considered a rightful political act,'' said Pickering.
   `Necklacing' involves placing a gasoline-soaked tire around the
neck of the victim and lighting it.
   Boesman is a member of the guerrilla-backed African National
Congress, the movement banned in South Africa for its fight to end
race discrimination.

<HEAD>Bills Requiring Seafood Inspection Introduced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two bills requiring seafood inspection were
introduced in Congress Thursday as lawmakers search for a way to
protect humans from contaminants eaten by sea life.
   Agriculture Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, offered
legislation he calls Federal Inspection for Seafood Healthfulness,
or the FISH Act of 1989. It puts the Agriculture Department in
charge of inspecting seafood much the way it does meat and poultry.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., came out with the Consumer Seafood
Safety Act, which splits the responsibility between USDA and the
Food and Drug Administration.
   ``The FDA and National Academy of Standards have the most
experience in establishing scientific standards to protect against
adulteration by which food should be inspected,'' Glickman said.
``The USDA has inspection expertise that can be relied upon to
effectively carry out the guidelines established at FDA.''
   De la Garza said the ``inspection should be in USDA where
historically the food inspection process has been from the
beginning.''
   Another seafood inspection measure is being worked on by the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, and similar proposals also
have been introduced in the Senate.
   All are attempts to reassure consumers, who cut back their
consumption of seafood last year after 10 years of steady increases.
   Seafood is the only flesh food in the United States not subject
to comprehensive and rigorous mandatory safety inspection by the
federal government.
   Both consumer and industry groups favor strengthening the
regulations.
   Public Voice, a non-profit organization that has been seeking
mandatory seafood inspection since 1983, praised both Glickman and
de la Garza for their efforts, but favors Glickman's bill.
   Glickman's measure would ``establish a strong federal program,
driven by public health considerations,'' said Ellen Haas,
executive director of Public Voice.
   The National Fisheries Institute, a trade association of 1,000
seafood companies, supports de la Garza's bill. It ``contains the
authority and direction needed to provide comprehensive regulation
and inspection of seafood products and plants,'' said Lee Weddig,
the institute's executive vice president.

<HEAD>FAA Orders Fuel Tank Work On Big Jets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal aviation officials ordered airlines
Thursday to strengthen fuel tank covers on all large jetliners to
reduce the chance of fire when a plane crashes.
   The new regulation will cost airlines $19.7 million and require
changes in nearly 27,000 fuel tank access doors, the Federal
Aviation Administration estimated. The order, which will take
effect 30 days after official publication, gives airlines two years
to comply.
   The agency said there have been several incidents where fuel
tank access panels on airliners' wings have failed, including an
August 1985 accident involving a British Air Tours Boeing 737 in
Manchester, England, that killed 55 of the 137 people on board.
   That incident led to an order to strengthen fuel tanks in all
U.S. 737s. The new action extends the order to all large jets that
have fuel doors that might be exposed to damage from flying engine
parts, pieces of tire tread or other debris in an accident.
   The FAA said Boeing-built airliners would be most heavily
affected because they have fuel access covers on the bottom
surfaces of the wings where they are most likely to be damaged.
Most other aircraft have them on the top, the FAA said.

<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos, unwavering in her assertions of
innocence, now stands alone to face charges that she and her late
husband stole millions from their Philippine homeland.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is scheduled for trial in New York in March,
along with the eight others who were indicted with her and her
husband, former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos. The
72-year-old Marcos died Thursday in Hawaii.
   ``I look forward to defending myself,'' she said recently. ``If
I have to face the court alone, so be it. I will walk into the
courtroom with my head held high.''
   She said she expects to be acquitted, return to private life and
participate in Philippine politics _ from a distance if she is
never allowed to return from Hawaii, where she and Marcos lived in
exile.
   Until her legal problems are resolved, Mrs. Marcos is barred by
court order from transferring most of the couple's alleged vast
wealth. On June 9, federal prosecutors in Manhattan filed a civil
racketeering lawsuit to guarantee claims against the deposed
Philippines president after his death.
   On Oct. 31, 1988, Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan to racketeering charges. Her husband's ill
health kept him from making the trip from Hawaii to New York for
arraignment and he was severed from the case last April.
   Tobacco heiress Doris Duke put up $5 million to secure Mrs.
Marcos's bail.
   ``I was born ostentatious,'' said Mrs. Marcos, who wore a
full-length chiffon aquamarine gown to her arraignment. ``They will
list my name in the dictionary someday. They will use `Imeldific'
to mean ostentatious extravagance.''
   It wasn't until after the Marcoses' February 1986 exile that the
world glimpsed the full meaning of `Imeldific' _ symbolized by the
former first lady's 3,000 pairs of shoes.
   The Marcoses' Philippines palace, opened to the public in March
1986, revealed bulletproof powder rooms, a bedside grand piano, and
a videotape of a birthday party _ the guests in baby clothes and a
fat man in diapers jumping out of the cake.
   At the couple's Manhattan townhouse, representatives of
President Corazon Aquino's government recorded neglect and evidence
of a hasty retreat: rare books beneath a boiler; Steuben stemware
worth $150 to $200 per glass scattered inside an oven; two smashed,
Louis XV mirrors lying in water.
   Fueled by the public's fascination with the Marcos frippery,
collectors eagerly shelled out $850,000 for antiques, plastic palm
trees and trinkets from the townhouse at an August 1986 auction
held by the Aquino government.
   The federal indictment issued in New York last October accuses
Mrs. Marcos and her husband of stealing $168 million.
   But the Philippine government accuses them of walking off with
from $3.5 billion to $10 billion in cash and property. If
recovered, the money could help reduce that nation's large foreign
debt.
   Either directly or indirectly, the money allegedly was spent on
prime Manhattan real estate, a $4 million home in Beverly Hills,
Calif., paintings by artists including Picasso and Van Gogh, among
other purchases.
   Marcos' 20-year rule came to a swift end in a public uprising
after he was accused of stealing a presidential election from Mrs.
Aquino.
   When the Marcoses fled to the United States on Feb. 26, 1986,
the Customs Service impounded more than $7 million in cash,
valuables and jewelry, including 48 square feet of pearls, from
their plane.
   Included in the indictment against the Marcoses and eight others
were racketeering charges that couple looted more than $103 million
from the Philippines to buy art and real estate in New York City.
The indictment also said they defrauded lending institutions of
more than $165 million in buying and financing the real estate.
   A superseding indictment in March accused them of illegally
funneling an additional $77 million into this country _ at least
$65 million of it allegedly stolen from the Philippines.
   Indicted along with the Marcoses was Adnan Khashoggi, 54, a
flamboyant Saudi financier once reputed to be the world's
wealthiest man. He was also accused of siphoning money from the
Philippines into the United States to buy real estate and art.
   The death of Marcos will not change the thrust of the defense,
said Robert Morvillo, attorney for Khashoggi.
   The Aquino government also sought $50 billion in punitive
damages in a lawsuit filed in federal court in California against
the Marcoses and an aide, Ramon Azurin. The Marcoses were accused
in the suit of bribery, extortion, theft and other charges in a
scheme to steal billions of dollars in public money for their
personal benefit.

<HEAD>Development of New Shuttle Boosters Questioned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a NASA advisory panel said
Thursday that he questioned the space agency's decision to develop
a new generation of shuttle booster rocket.
   Joe Sutter, chairman of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel,
told a House subcommittee on space science and applications that
NASA could continue to rely on the redesigned solid rocket motor
that has been in use since the 1986 Challenger explosion.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Sutter said,
should instead focus its attention and limited financial resources
on safety programs within the current shuttle program.
   That need is critical while NASA accelerates the shuttle
program, building up to 14 annual launches by 1994, he said.
   ``We still consider the space shuttle an inherently high-risk
endeavor,'' he said. ``The present NASA management organization
with its greater emphasis on safety and quality assurance, which is
excellent, should be maintained and strengthened.''
   The hearing of the Science, Space and Technology subcommittee
was called to review the annual report of Sutter's panel. The
report in March had contained a recommendation to postpone
development of a so-called advanced solid rocket motor and focus on
the redesigned version.
   However, NASA decided to procure the new rocket, saying it can
deliver heavier loads and, more important, addresses a number of
safety problems brought out by the Challenger disaster.
   The new design emphasizes welds over bolts, allows for
mechanical closing of joints and has different seals that permit
more visual inspection, NASA said. The joints were blamed in the
Challenger disaster.
   NASA in April awarded a $1.1 billion contract to Lockheed to
develop 44 advanced motors, with the first to be delivered in 1994.
   ``It is still the No. 1 priority with me,'' said J.R. Thompson,
NASA deputy administrator. ``It is the last system that failed.
(When it fails) it always fails catastrophically.''
   Thompson also said the manufacture of the new rocket motor would
be less labor intensive and thus less prone to human error.
   The panel said that many of the improvements could be
incorporated into the current design.
   Sutter told the panel that NASA needs to have a tried-and-true
shuttle rocket ready for the space station program in 1995, since
it will rely on the shuttle for construction, supply and operation.

   The Environmental Protection Agency on
Thursday added 93 toxic waste sites, including five at two nuclear
weapons plants, to its priority list for cleanup under the federal
Superfund law.
   The additional sites and the removal of 31 others from the list
brings to 1,194 the number of waste sites where chemicals or other
material have been judged so much of a threat that they are
eligible for federal funds for cleanup.
   The federal Superfund law since 1980 has allocated more than $8
billion, raised through taxes on chemicals and crude oil, for
removal of toxic materials from the top priority sites, but so far
cleanup has been concluded at only a handful of sites.
   The addtional target locations for cleanup announced Thursday
were spread over 32 states and Puerto Rico. Seventeen of the
additional sites were in Pennsuylvania, nine in California and
seven in Washington state.
   Among the new sites were 11 federal facilities including the
Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant in Colorado and four in the
government's nuclear complex near Hanford, Wash.
   These facilities joined 52 other military installations, nuclear
fuel processing plants and other plants already on the EPA priority
cleanup list.
   As the EPA added to the number of sites eligible for federal
Superfund cleanup funds, it also announced that 27 sites previously
on the priority list had been shifted to a different cleanup
program. Although cleanup activities would continue on those sites,
the federal money would come from another program.
   These 27 sites are active hazardous waste treatment, storage or
disposal installations that will be handled under the federal waste
disposal law.
   Four sites were deleted altogether from the cleanup list. The
agency said it had downgraded the threats posed by the four.
   The priority list of 1,194 cleanup sites represents the worst of
an estimated 30,000 hazardous waste dumps in need of treatment or
cleanup in the country.
   The EPA has been under sharp criticism from Congress and
elsewhere for its failure to make more progress. Earlier this
month, a study by the Rand Corp. concluded that the Superfund
program has been ``superslow.''
   During the program's first eight years cleanup was finished at
only 34 of the 1,175 sites on the priority list at the time, the
Rand Corp. analysis said. The report also criticized the agency for
not spending more of the money provided by Congress for cleanup and
for not recovering more of the costs from polluters.
   EPA officials have acknowledged problems in the Superfund
program and recently announced plans to pursue polluters more
vigorously to get them to pay more for cleanups.

   Laws designed to protect victims of
Hurricane Hugo from price gouging may actually delay the flow of
supplies to rebuild this storm-ravaged city, an economist says.
   ``There are strong needs for certain items. When the word gets
out you are willing to pay $200 for a sheet of plywood ... 20
million self-employed contractors will start shipping in plywood,''
said David Laband, an associate professor in economics at Clemson
University in western South Carolina.
   If there is no potential for a sizeable profit, there is no
financial incentive to send additional supplies into the area,
Laband said Wednesday in a telephone interview.
   Charleston has imposed a price-gouging ordinance that calls for
fines of $250 and jail terms upon conviction.
   Mayor Joseph Riley Jr. defined price gouging as selling items at
prices substantially higher than prices before the storm. ``It's
hard to define but I know it when I see it,'' he said.
   Earlier this week, an out-of-town contractor was arrested for
allegedly charging $20,000 to remove downed trees from a yard.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell has said the state also will prosecute
suspected price gougers under anti-trust laws.
   But Laband said any price increases as a result of price gouging
tend to be temporary. ``Prices fall almost as immediately as they''
rise, he said.
   There are similar supply issues in other areas that people do
not get as excited about, Laband said. For instance, he said, math
and science teachers are in short supply and can demand higher
salaries.
   ``The people who have the goods are in a position to `gouge'
their employers,'' he said.
   The same theory applies to ice.
   ``Prices come down for an item when there is plenty of it,'' he
said. ``When prices are artificially low and there is no supply
side pressure, you end up having no ice for two weeks and people
are worse off.''

   A homosexual man said Thursday he is seeking
$20 million in damages against members of a ``Skinhead'' gang for
alleged anti-homosexual violence.
   The D.C. Superior Court suit alleges the group of shaven-head
men and women planned and executed ``a vicious gay-bashing
campaign'' in which Rodney Johnson was beaten and robbed.
   Johnson said he was walking home from work at a restaurant in
the Georgetown section of Washington during the early morning hours
of Sept. 17, 1988, when he was attacked by a group of men with
baseball bats.
   ``While I was being beaten they were shouting `die, faggot,
die,''' the 37-year-old admitted homosexual said in a telephone
interview.
   Johnson suffered a concussion, fractured skull, collapsed lungs
and broken bones in the attack.
   Six men and two women, all believed to be minors from the
Washinton area, are named in the suit. Three of them were charged
with assault in connection with the incident.
   ``I felt that there should be some other form of justice or some
way to get at these guys and all the other people responsible for
this type of thing,'' said Johnson of his suit, which was filed
earlier this month.
   ``I feel we all have the right to walk down the street without
being attacked, either physically or verbally,'' Johnson said.
``Gays are not protected in lot of ways under some of these laws.''
   ``I think this case is an unprecedented case. It is the first
time the Skinheads have been sued for their violent, hateful
behavior,'' said Paula Ettelbrick, Johnson's attorney with the
Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund.
   ``It's also the first time that a gay victim has sued the
Skinheads under the federal civil rights laws,'' she added,
explaining damages were being sought under a 100-year-old law,
known as the Ku Klux Klan Act.
   ``We want to set a precedent that the Skinheads are the present
day embodiment of a hate group,'' she said.
   Other lawyers, civil rights and homosexual support groups
joining the suit include attorney Linda Delaney of Lyons, Mack,
Delaney & Young; the D.C. Gay and Lesbian Activists Alliance; the
Atlanta-based Center for Democratic Renewal; the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force; and the Anti-Defamation League.

<HEAD>Group Files Suit Against FDA Over Red Dye No. 3</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A public interest group filed suit Thursday
against the Food and Drug Administration, trying to force the
agency to ban Red Dye No. 3 as a cancer-causing food additive.
   The additive, which among other things gives marachino cherries
their bright glow, ``represents a completely unnecessary risk of
cancer to American consumers,'' said William B. Schultz, an
attorney for Public Citizen.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, cites repeated
extensions of the FDA's deadline for ruling on the safety of the
additive as evidence that FDA Commissioner Frank Young has acted in
bad faith.
   FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbitt said the agency had no comment on the
suit.
   The FDA on Aug. 30 extended for two months its deadline for
deciding whether to ban Red Dye No. 3. That pushed the dealine to
Oct. 30.
   The House in July passed legislation calling for further study
of the food coloring. The Senate has not acted on the legislation.
   Since 1960, when Congress called for a ban on foods that cause
cancer in laboratory animals, Red Dye No. 3 and other additives
have been on a provisional list that allowed them to remain on the
market for an additional two years pending further study.
   Public Citizen said that since then, the FDA has granted 40
extensions to the provisional listing of Red Dye No. 3.

   Heeding President Bush's warning
that the nation is imperiled when children ``emerge into adulthood
ignorant and unskilled,'' the nation's governors joined him
Thursday in framing national goals for improving America's public
schools.
   The objectives, product of a two-day education summit, range
from reversing a dropout rate that sends nearly one youth in three
into the job market without a diploma to making educators more
accountable for their pupils' classroom performance.
   At a convocation with the governors, a beaming Bush sported a
blue and orange striped necktie in the colors of the University of
Virginia, site of the summit, and declared himself pleased by ``the
commitment, the creativity and the knowledge that my fellow chief
executives bring here to this education reform agenda.''
   A joint statement agreed upon by Bush and the governors put
special emphasis on expanding pre-kindergarten programs that
prepare poor youngsters for schooling.
   Bush and the governors also said they wanted to cut through
federal regulations and ``swap red tape for results.''
   Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican from Iowa, said the summit
marked the first time governors and a president had agreed upon
``specific results-oriented goals'' for education _ historically a
matter under local control.
   But Democratic Gov. Richard Celeste of Ohio said the jury was
still out on whether Bush had earned the title ``education
president.'' He said the administration ``painted itself in a
corner'' by foreclosing the possibility of spending more on schools.
   ``The president would have been better served if somebody had
said, `Look Mr. President, we can do without these three stealth
bombers,'' Celeste said.
   Republican Govs. George Deukmejian of California and Thomas Kean
of New Jersey cautioned that the proposed reforms may be resisted
by professional educators.
   ``They like the status quo,'' Duekmejian said. ``The difficulty
is going to be that there is going to have to be some
restructuring, some accountability, some redirecting of funds, to
meet the primary objectives.''
   Said Kean, ``If the people involved in education oppose and
stand in the way, it will be difficult and time-consuming to get
any of these things accomplished.''
   Winding up the proceedings under sunny skies, Bush said he was
determined to make the summit make a difference.
   ``We just cannot let it sit here and end here and I promise you
that I won't,'' he told the governors.
   ``We've reached agreement on the need for national performance
goals, on the need for more flexibility and accountability, the
need for restructuring and choice ... and the need for more federal
support for the pre-kindergarten education process,'' Bush said.
   Democratic Gov. Booth Gardner of Washington said that while
federal money was limited the governors and Bush had agreed that
whatever additional education dollars might become available ``will
be applied to the issue of early childhood education and Head
Start,'' the program intended to prepare 3-and 4-year-olds for
school.
   ``We're going to empower teachers by letting them take over the
classroom again,'' said Gov. Garrey Carruthers of New Mexico, a
Republican.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a Democrat, said the governors
``expect to be held personally accountable for the progress we make
in moving this country to a brighter future.''
   The summit didn't reach conclusions on how to pay for the
reforms that all agreed were essential to the nation's future.
   ``We just don't think that at this time it's worth letting the
summit break apart over a fight over how much money they'll have to
put up next year,'' said Clinton.
   In his speech, the president called for greater competition in
education _ ``between students, between teachers and between
schools'' _ and ``a report card for all,'' in which parents,
educators and students could all see how their schools rank.
   ``The American people are ready for radical reforms,'' Bush
said. ``We must not disappoint them.''
   He ticked off what national tests have shown the problem to be.
He said ``fewer than one high school junior in four can write an
adequate persuasive letter and only half can manage decimals,
fractions and percentages and barely one in three can locate the
Civil War in the correct half century.''
   He concluded: ``No modern nation can long afford to allow so
many of its sons and daughters to emerge into adulthood ignorant
and unskilled.''
   Though far from radical, the agenda framed by the governors and
the White House looked toward greater local responsibility for
making schools work better.
   The goals called for helping all children prepare for school
through nutrition programs, Head Start and the like; making
educators more accountable for students' progress; keeping drugs
out of schools; bolstering on-the-job education to make workers
more competitive; improving literacy throughout the population;
giving educators more flexibility by reducing state and federal
regulations; combatting a dropout rate that has been approaching 30
percent.
   Governors generally seemed pleased with their sessions with Bush
and his Cabinet, feeling that national attention had been focused
on the ailments of a public education system which, in Bush's word,
had turned ``stagnant.''
   ``While millions of Americans read for pleasure,'' the president
said, returning to his particulars, ``millions of others don't read
at all. And while millions go to college, millions may never
graduate from high school.''

<HEAD>Soviets Slash Projected Budget Deficit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet government has slashed its projected
budget deficit for 1989 from an estimated $187 billion to $143
billion largely through cuts in government spending on
construction, factory equipment and defense, Tass said Thursday.
   Since nearly all businesses in the Soviet Union are
government-owned, the budget includes most of the capital
investment projects in the country.
   The official Tass news agency report did not say if Vladimir
Panskov, a deputy finance minister, detailed the defense cuts in
his testimony to a committee of the Supreme Soviet legislature.
   Soviet officials said earlier this week they planned to trim the
defense budget from $119 billion this year to $109 billion in 1990
as part of a planned 14 percent cut in military spending by 1991.
   Separately, Gen. Anatoly Shabanov told Tass that projected
military spending cuts would save the Soviet Union $46 billion. But
the report did not say when that budget reduction would occur. Nor
did it say if he was counting from the current budget or from
once-projected increases.
   Shabanov also said the military will shift to the civilian
economy 45,000 pieces of major equipment in 1989 and 1990,
including trucks, earthmovers and telephone facilities. He said the
amount to be transferred by the army this year is valued at $774
million.
   Legislators continued debating the budget in Supreme Soviet
committees Thursday. Alexander Orlov from the Ural Mountains
criticized the $155 billion food subsidies, Tass said. Orlov
suggested such funds would be better spent improving agricultural
efficiency.
   The committee on law added a clause to a strike bill that says
only the Supreme Soviet or its parent body, the Congress of
People's Deputies, would have the power to ban strikes. That panel
also debated a blanket prohibition on strikes in certain areas of
the economy but came to no decision, Tass said.

<HEAD>Ecuador Will Ask International Help to Keep Oil Flowing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ecuador said on Thursday it is ready to
ask for international help to restart oil production here, one day
after a strike by Texaco workers paralyzed the nation's petroleum
shipments.
   The strike shut down the Trans-Ecuador pipeline, which connects
oil fields in the eastern jungle with Esmeraldas on the Pacific
coast 310 miles away.
   Luis Roman, manager for the state oil corporation PetroEcuador,
told a news conference if company technicians cannot reopen
production in 48 hours PetroEcuador will seek help from state oil
companies in Venezuela, Colombia and Brazil.
   He reported that before the strike Ecuador was producing 290,000
barrels of crude daily, more than twice its domestic daily needs.
   The government put the entire country under a state of emergency
Wednesday night and ordered the military to take charge of the
affected installations.
   Strikers are demanding severance pay from Texaco, which is due
to turn over operation of the pipeline to PetroEcuador on Oct. 1.
   Texaco officials refused to comment on the demand.
   The Labor Ministry says severance should be paid by Texaco.
PetroEcuador, which now has a minority share in the consortium made
up of the two companies, says it is not liable for severance pay.
   The 170 workers who operate the pipeline, pumping stations and
shiploading facilities for Texaco are demanding about $43 million
from the company before the turnover Oct. 1. Hundreds of Texaco
office workers in Quito walked out in support of the strikers.
   Roman said PetroEcuador sent technical personnel Thursday to the
main oil region of Lago Agrio, 120 miles east of Quito, to restart
production after the military expelled strikers who had taken over
facilities.
   He said the company was considering an emergency measure using a
pipeline that runs from Lago Agrio into neighboring Colombia. It
connects with a Colombian pipeline at the jungle city of Oritos to
carry oil to Tumaco, Colombia, on the Pacific coast.
   Roman said, ``The government has reacted swiftly and forcefully
... since losses from the strike are surpassing $4 million a day.''
   He said the country has 15 days of refined oil products and
crude oil reserves for another 15 days. Ecuador uses 120,000
barrels of oil daily.
   The state of emergency restricts civil rights and freedom of
movement. In signing the decree, President Rodrigo Borja, a Social
Democrat, said ``internal commotion'' threatened the nation's most
important source of income.
   Ecuador, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, relies on oil for 60 percent of its export earnings. It
earned more than $1 billion in oil sales last year.

   Residents who suffered damage to their
homes and property from Hurricane Hugo's fury can expect to feel
shock, anger, depression, anxiety and a whole range of emotional
pain, experts say.
   ``There's so many emotions going on right now. Almost
everybody's had some major disruptions. They're going to have to
deal with their losses,'' Sharon Foley, a social worker at Southern
Pines Psychiatric Hospital in Charleston, said Wednesday.
   The emotional upheaval may result in nightmares, sleep disorders
and jumpiness. Some feelings may last for weeks, months or even a
year, doctors said.
   ``Hugo was an experience of being immersed in chaos, of people
losing everything they possessed, of not knowing if they would be
alive,'' said Dr. Linda Austin, associate professor of psychiatry
at Medical University of South Carolina.
   ``It really rattled us to our roots,'' said Austin, coordinator
of the school's crisis response effort to the killer storm, which
was blamed for 29 deaths in the United States.
   One of the most common emotions is that of anger.
   ``What we're angry at is that Hurricane Hugo came and demolished
our homes and our beautiful city, but how do you get mad at a
hurricane,'' Austin said.
   The university is setting up a speaker's bureau to talk about
psychological trauma to schools, churches and businesses.
   The Charleston County Mental Health Center has offered a 24-hour
mobile crisis unit since Sunday that allows doctors to send a nurse
and a social worker into the field to prescribe medication for
stress.
   Southern Pines has set up a crisis line and referral service for
people having problems. The crisis line, in operation since Monday,
is taking hundreds of calls a day on five lines, officials said.
   Residents should not isolate themselves and should talk about
their feelings with family or friends.
   ``The main thing is to be aware that these feelings can occur.
People should be open to sharing their experience,'' said Dr.
Stephen McLeod-Bryant, medical director for the county's mental
health center.
   ``Anxiety can also lead to flashbacks. If the wind gusts and
rattles the windows, people might wake up in a cold sweat and feel
like they're back in a hurricane,'' McLeod-Bryant said.
   ``If you hold in these emotions, you could develop emotional and
physical problems. It's going to come out in some way,'' Ms. Foley
said.
   Thousands of people are without homes or still lack basic
necessities such as electrical service and water. Others have been
unable to return to their jobs.
   But experts advise residents to try to get back to normal as
quickly as possible, even if it's something as simple as going to
bed and getting up at the same time.
   Doctors also advise residents not to vent their anger at
spouses, loved ones or public officials. Energy should be targeted
to rebuilding.
   ``Dealing with these emotions makes you look at what's really
important in your life. It helps you put things in perspective,''
Ms. Foley said.

<HEAD>Angolan Guerrilla Leader Urges U.S. To Step Up Quest For Peace</HEAD>
<HEAD>By DAVID CRARY</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JAMBA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi on Thursday
accused African leaders of undermining peace prospects in Angola
and urged the United States, which backs his forces, to do more to
end the 14-year civil war.
   Savimbi, who is to visit Washington next week, said neither his
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, called UNITA,
nor troops of the Soviet-backed Marxist government are making any
effort to observe a cease-fire declared in June.
   He spoke to reporters at the end of a four-day emergency
congress of guerrilla officials at his bush headquarters.
   In a secret ballot, delegates voted 2,985-to-1 in favor of
calling for a new cease-fire and 15-month transition with a
coalition government, followed by free elections, Savimbi said.
   He also said President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia and several
other African leaders have aggravated the situation by asserting at
a summit in Zimbabwe that Savimbi had agreed to temporary exile and
to his guerrillas being integrated into the Angolan army.
   These proposals never have been accepted by his movement and
were introduced by the Angolan government, said Savimbi. He
withdrew a previous offer to stay out of a possible temporary
coalition government, saying his movement reserves the right to
pick its own members of such a government.
   ``UNITA calls for elections and nothing else,'' Savimbi said.
``If democracy and elections are good for Namibia and good for
Poland, why not for Angola?''
   The guerrillas never have had a chance to test their popularity
at the polls. They have been at war since Portuguese colonizers
hastily withdrew, granting independence in 1975 and leaving rival
black factions to fight it out for power. The victory went to the
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, led by President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
   Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko mediated talks leading to a
June 24 truce. Savimbi said Thursday this attempt was unrealistic
because neither side had time to notify their combatants.
   Heavy fighting broke out shortly afterward, and both sides
accused the other of mounting attacks. Guerrilla officers said two
Angolan government offensives have been repulsed, but a third
continues.
   Savimbi said his movement seeks new talks, and he proposed a new
truce monitored by a multinational African force, possibly
including Nigeria, Togo and Morocco.
   The cease-fire would lead the way to a coalition government, and
then elections supervised by the United Nations and Organization of
African Unity, he said. But Savimbi noted this cannot happen unless
the government agrees to rewrite its constitution, which
establishes a one-party political system.
   ``We cannot join a Marxist-Leninist party,'' Savimbi said.
``They have to make room for us.''
   The guerrillas are prepared to make ``real concessions'' in
negotiations, he said, but also are willing to risk a cutoff of
foreign aid rather than agree to unacceptable terms.
   Savimbi voiced confidence that U.S. aid will continue, but said
many Americans are not well-informed about Angola.
   ``We want the U.S. to be more active,'' he said, suggesting
American officials convince the Soviet Union to join a push for a
negotiated settlement.
   Moscow still backs the Luanda government. South Africa provided
military aid to the rebels during much of the war, but agreed to
halt it as part of a regional accord in exchange for a phased
withdrawal of the 50,000 Cuban troops fighting on the government
side in Angola.
   Savimbi said he believes Cuba is honoring its withdrawal
timetable.

   A civil righs group Thursday accused the FBI
of trying to intimidate a music company for distributing a
controversial record that the FBI contends encourages violence
against police.
   ``It's extraordinarily frightening to get a letter from the FBI
saying the FBI has officially decided they don't like your music
... and to intimate that the music is going to cause violence,''
said Barry Lynn, legislative counsel for the American Civil
Liberties Union.
   The letter was written by Milt Ahlerich, FBI assistant director
for public affairs, to Priority Records about the song ``---- Tha
Police'' by the rap group NWA. The song's title contains an
obscenity.
   ``It (the letter) intimidates the recipient because the source
is the federal government ... (and) is likely to have a very
chilling effect on that record company and that artist,'' Lynn said.
   Lynn said he and representatives of Music in Action, a group
concerned with censorship of rock music, met with a Justice
Department official Monday to demand a retraction of the letter.
   Thomas Boyd, director of the department's office of policy
development, didn't take a position on the letter but said he would
look into it, Lynn said.
   Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian said Thursday that the
department ``will review all of their concerns and points of view
and try to be helpful where we can.''
   Eramian said Ahlerich was ``expressing his point of view and
that's his right under free speech. He is not advocating taking
action. He's just saying I don't believe you should be doing
anything that advocates violence against police.''
   Ahlerich, in an interview Thursday, said the letter was
``absolutely not'' a threat against the Los Angeles record company
and that ``it's their decision to distribute it.''
   The song includes lines such as ``beat a police outta shape,''
and ``takin' out a police will make my day.'' The song says police
believe ``every nigger is selling narcotics.''
   Gunfire is heard in the background of the record.
   Ahlerich said ``We wanted to take the opportunity to supply
(Priority) with information about violence associated with police
officers ... and concern about violence in this country. It was not
anything past that.''
   Ahlerich said he had received a ``couple of letters'' from
anti-censorship groups but no response from Priority.
   The Associated Press obtained a copy of the Aug. 1 letter from
the trade publication Radio &amp; Records. The letter, written on
official FBI stationery, was addressed to Gui Manganiello,
Priority's national promotions director.
   ``Advocating violence and assault is wrong, and we in the law
enforcement community take exception to such action,'' Ahlerich
wrote, adding that he felt the song advocated such violence.
   ``Seventy-eight law enforcement officers were feloniously slain
in the line of duty in 1988, four more than in 1987. Law
enforcement officers dedicate their lives to the protection of our
citizens, and recordings such as the one from NWA are both
discouraging and degrading to these brave, dedicated officers. ...
I wanted you to be aware of the FBI's position relative to this
song and its message.''
   Manganiello did not immediately return a call seeking comment
Thursday.

   President Bush returned from his education
summit on Thursday to a ceremony on the White House lawn and
praised principals from 218 of ``America's best'' schools.
   Bush spoke briefly to the principals from the award-winning
schools after stepping from his helicopter, concluding his
participation in the two-day summit in Charlottesville, Va.
   ``You set your own high goals and then you met them,'' the
president told the gathering of principals and their families. The
educators represented schools which won awards this year in the
Education Department's Secondary School Recognition Program.
   The president called the schools ``America's best. Some are
private, some are religiously affiliated, some are public ... But
you all have one thing in common: a determination to excel.''
   The public and private secondary school winners were named last
May by Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos, who said the 218
schools were ``examples of what's right with American education.''
   The schools are located in 42 statres, the District of Colombia
and Peurto Rico.

<HEAD>Postal Equipment Firm Was Victimized, Attorney Tells Trial</HEAD>

   Top executives at Recognition Equipment Inc.
of Dallas were victimized by a Michigan consultant and the former
vice chairman of the postal board of governors, a defense attorney
said Thursday.
   The postal governor, Peter Voss, and Detroit-area consultant
John Gnau ``played us like a violin,'' atorney Robert Bennett said
in federal court at the criminal trial of REI and two of its
officers.
   REI hired Gnau at Voss's urging and the company agreed to pay
Gnau $325,000 in a little more than a year in an attempt to get
$400 million in postal service contracts.
   ``They were pumping us up'' into believing REI would get the
postal business, Bennett said.
   The company, along with chief operating officer William Moore
and marketing vice president Robert Reedy, are accused of
conspiring with Voss, Gnau and others to fraudulently obtain the
postal contracts to build mail-sorting equipment.
   U.S. postal inspectors uncovered an arrangement in which Gnau
allegedly agreed to share some of the money he got from REI with
Voss.
   Bennett, who represents Reedy, said REI executives were unaware
of Voss and Gnau's ``hidden agenda.''
   Voss and Gnau ``were looking for pigeons,'' Bennett said. If a
company was ``trying to get business with the postal service and
not doing very well, they would be targeted'' by Voss and Gnau,
said Bennett.
   Voss and Gnau agreed that REI would never be told about the
arrangement, the lawyer added.
   Bennett said that in order for the government to prove REI was
part of a conspiracy, it would have to show that Voss and Gnau told
REI executives, ``We can make music together. Here is how much it
will cost.''
   ``That didn't happen,'' Bennett said.
   The attorney said Reedy failed to tell postal inspectors the
truth just once, an incident for which Reedy later apologized to
the government and for which he hasn't been charged with a crime.
   A U.S. postal inspector asked Reedy on April 8, 1986, how Reedy
had met Gnau. Reedy told the inspector it was through a public
relations executive, according to Bennett.
   In fact, it was Voss who urged Reedy in the fall of 1984 to hire
Gnau's firm.
   The first witness in the trial, postal contract officer John
Simmons, testified that Voss at one meeting in 1985 criticized
postal official Currie Boswell, who favored the type of
mail-sorting equipment that was manufactured by REI's competitors.
   Voss ``kind of blamed Mr. Boswell's group for going down the
wrong path,'' Simmons testified, adding that Voss had leveled a
parting shot at Boswell as people filed out of the meeting.
   ``Maybe we'll send you some flowers,'' Voss told Boswell,
according to Simmons, signifying that Boswell's career was in
peril. Boswell currently is director of the postal service's office
of operational requirements.
   Voss, who headed Ronald Reagan's 1980 Ohio presidential
campaign, received a four-year prison term in 1986 after pleading
guilty to expense account fraud and taking an illegal gratuity from
Gnau in connection with efforts to steer postal contracts to REI.
   Gnau, who headed Reagan's 1980 Michigan campaign, was sentenced
to three years for conspiracy and paying an illegal $2,500 gratuity
to Voss in connection with work on behalf of REI.
   Voss and Gnau are to be government witnesses in the non-jury
trial before U.S. District Court Judge George Revercomb.

<HEAD>Portugal Smokes Least, Denmark Most, EEC Survey Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Overall, Portuguese smoke the least and Danes the
most, but the picture changes markedly among younger men, according
to a survey of European Economic Community countries published
Thursday.
   Only 28 percent of the Portuguese smoke, compared with 45
percent in Denmark, 43 percent in Greece and 42 percent in Holland,
said the survey.
   But among men aged 15 to 24, the figure for Portugal is 52
percent, Denmark 33, Greece 59, and Holland 38, it said.
   Among women in that age bracket, the figure for Portugal is 26
percent, Denmark 44, Holland 41 and Greece 35, the survey found.
   The EEC said the findings were an average of four surveys
conducted since 1987, covering about 4,000 people aged 16 and older
in each of 10 EEC countries, plus 1,200 in Luxembourg and 2,500 in
Britain.
   The highest number of doctors smoking was in Spain, with 45
percent, followed by Italy with 41 percent, Greece and Portugal 39
percent, and Denmark 38 percent, the survey said. Britain came
lowest, at 10 percent.
   Turning to teachers, it found the highest smoking levels in
Denmark and Spain, at 34 percent, and the lowest in Britain, at 13
percent.
   It said 2,780 teachers and 2,314 doctors were questioned. No
margin of error was given for any category, and no indication how
many refused to answer.
   Overall, 36 percent of citizens of the EEC smoke _ 44 percent
men and 28 percent women, it said. Among young men the figure is 39
percent, and women 34 percent. It said 36 percent of doctors and 21
percent of teachers smoke.
   In an introduction, the EEC said smoking kills 450,000 people a
year in the 320-million-strong community. It congratulated Portugal
for its ``very advanced legislation'' to curb smoking, which
includes a complete ban on advertising and a prohibition of the
sale of high-tar cigarettes.
   It warned, however, that Portugal and other southern European
countries register the highest smoking levels among young men, and
attributed it to the low price of cigarettes there.
   The EEC noted what it called a paradox _ the highest levels of
female smoking were in countries where cigarettes were most
expensive, and suggested that the cigarette as a symbol of female
equality outweighs economic constraints.

   When 10-year-old Joshua Dennis was rescued
from an abandoned mine after five days, he had long since exhausted
his tiny supply of licorice but thought he'd been missing only a
couple of days.
   ``Mostly I just slept a lot of the time. I got tired of looking
around and just sat there,'' the boy said Thursday. ``I wasn't
feeling very lonely or scared ... but I cried once.''
   His feet mottled purple with mild frostbite and propped on a
pillow, Joshua spoke from his hospital bed just 24 hours after
rescuers found him on a ledge some 2,000 feet inside the mine where
he got lost during a scouting expedition.
   ``I was just following the wall,'' after being separated from
his father inside the mine last Friday night, he said. ``There was
a whole bunch of exits and I went down the wrong one.''
   Joshua is in good condition and expected to go home to suburban
Kearns over the weekend, his doctor at Primary Children's Medical
Center said.
   ``He's squared away. ... He'll do just fine,'' Dr. Ted Jenkins
said.
   The boy's father, Terry Dennis, said Joshua went into the Hidden
Treasure mine with 10 bite-size pieces of licorice in his pocket.
He exhausted the meager cache only after slowly sucking one piece
at a time. He had no water and was dehydrated when found Wednesday
afternoon.
   Joshua, Cub Scout, strayed from the Boy Scout group his father
was helping supervise on an expedition into the former silver, lead
and zinc mine in the Oquirrh Mountains 45 miles southwest of Salt
Lake City.
   After five days, hope had all but vanished that the boy would be
found alive. Then a search team that had passed within 150 feet of
him in half a dozen sweeps heard his faint cry and discovered him
on the ledge.
   Joshua said that during his vigil he had heard searchers' voices
a few times but his cries for help weren't heard.
   ``I wondered how long it was going to take me to find my way
out,'' he said. ``I couldn't really hear what they were saying. I
called for help, but not one of the times they couldn't hear me.''
   At the head of his bed was a white hard hat inscribed with the
names of the two Utah Power &amp; Light Co. mine rescue team members
who found him.
   ``I was thinking if it was day or night, or what day it was. I
thought it was night, and when they told me it was Wednesday I
thought it was Sunday,'' Joshua said.
   Sheriff's deputies, utility crews, search dogs and dozens of
volunteers had scoured the mine's tunnels and surrounding canyon
areas in their search, finally concluding that Joshua probably had
left the mine only to fall into one of hundreds of other abandoned
mines nearby.
   But Ray Guymon and Gary Christensen returned to double-check an
ore pocket with a local historian, John Skinner, whose grandfather
once was superintendent of the same mine.
   Christensen found Joshua in a 6-by-20-foot cavity in the ore
pocket about 500 feet from where he was last seen.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III held
out hope Thursday of Israel and Palestinian Arabs holding
negotiations on the future of the West Bank and Gaza.
   But Baker was cautious at a news conference after meeting
jointly with Foreign Ministers Moshe Arens of Israel and Esmet
Abdel-Meguid of Egypt.
   ``There may be some potential for progress,'' he said. But,
Baker added, ``we really will not know'' until key members of the
Israeli Cabinet meet in Jerusalem next Wednesday.
   Baker again endorsed a plan by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir for negotiations with Palestinian Arabs to be elected on the
West Bank and in Gaza.
   He said a 10-point formula for negotiations advanced by Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak ``was not, in any sense, a competing
proposal.''
   Some of Mubarak's points upset Shamir, particularly having one
or two of the Palestinians deported during the rebellion
participate in the negotiations.
   Mubarak also demanded that Israel commit itself to relinquishing
territory in exchange for peace.
   Baker stressed the U.S. goal was ``to look for ways to move the
process forward.''
   He added: ``We're in this thing to try to find a way to move
toward peace.''
   Baker has been in New York all week meeting with foreign
ministers who are attending the special session of the United
Natiions General Assembly. He will hold a news conference Friday
before returning to Washington.
   Arens told Israeli reporters, meanwhile, that he would like
Mubarak to endorse the entire Shamir proposal.
   The Egyptian president, who is due to address the assembly on
Friday, met separately with Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon
Peres.
   He told Peres no Palestinian objedtionable to Israel would be in
the negotiating delegation.
   He also said he would be willing to meet with Shamir to launch
tne negotiations.
   In a sudden flurry of Mideast diplomacy, Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze met with Arens and offered to act as an
intermediary between the Palestinians and Israel.
   Baker was not impressed. Noting the complications in getting
Mideast talks started, he said ``I don't react positively to this.''

<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday
formally downgraded its rating of a generic drug made by Bolar
Pharmaceutical Co. for treating high blood pressure, saying it is
not equivalent to Dyazide, the brand-name product.
   By changing the code it assigns Bolar's product, the FDA is
telling physicians that it does not consider the generic drug to
have the same therapeutic value as the brand-name drug.
   The FDA had announced plans for the change on Aug. 28 when it
also began moving to withdraw the generic from the market because
of questions about whether the drug has the same effect as Dyzaide.
The removal process is still under way.
   In a letter to Copiague, N.Y.-based Bolar, Carl C. Peck,
director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said
``significant questions remain as to the reliability'' of the data
the company submitted to the FDA as part of safety and
effectiveness tests conducted last year.
   ``There appear to be significant misrepresentations in your
documentation of this raw ingredient testing which you have not
adequately explained,'' he said. ``These facts alone warrant a
change in the therapeutic equivalence rating.''
   He also cited ``unorthodox practices and inconsistent
representations of information'' in the reporting to FDA of
bioequivalence testing results. This testing, required for FDA
approval to make and sell copies of brand-name drugs, is designed
to show that a generic drug dissolves in the body at roughly the
same rate and produces approximately the same effect as the
brand-name product.
   Bolar officials could not be reached for comment. Their offices
said they had left for the day.
   Bolar is one of 11 generic drug companies the FDA is
investigating after disclosures of fraud and corruption involving
some companies and employees in FDA's generic drug division and
admissions by some companies that they had provided false data to
the agency.
   The agency is also sampling 30 of the most prescribed generic
drugs and their brand-name counterparts to test the safety of these
products.

   Ferdinand E. Marcos succumbed to cardiac arrest
Thursday, but even in death he remained an unwanted exile, his
remains barred from U.S. air lanes, his political legacy still
stirring passions in his Philippine homeland.
   Marcos, who ruled the Philippines for more than 20 years before
being ousted in February 1986, died at 12:40 a.m. Thursday at St.
Francis Medical Center. He was 72.
   Doctors said kidney and lung failure and a widespread infection
contributed to the cardiac arrest listed as the cause of death.
   The canny, combative politician, who governed at times as a
democrat, at times as a dictator, died without facing trial on U.S.
criminal charges he plundered the Philippine treasury.
   While Marcos spent nearly 10 months in the hospital, his family
begged Philippine President Corazon Aquino to let him come home to
die, but she refused.
   Mrs. Aquino took office as a result of the popular revolt that
drove Marcos into exile, and her government has survived six armed
attempts to overthrow it. She said she refused again after his
death to allow his burial in the Philippines for the sake of ``the
tranquillity of the state and the order of society.''
   Philippine opposition leaders urged her to reconsider.
   ``It is just so wrong. It is his birthright. He is a Filipino,
the greatest Filipino,'' said Joe Lazo, president of the Honolulu
group Friends of Marcos.
   Later Thursday, the Federal Aviation Administration in
Washington prohibited any aircraft from flying Marcos' remains out
of the United States for the Philippines, saying it would ``create
a danger to the safety of the aircraft and persons involved.''
   Lazo said family and friends would pay respects at Marcos'
hilltop home overlooking downtown Honolulu and the Pacific Ocean.
Marcos' remains, in a polished wooden casket, were taken by hearse
to the mansion Thursday morning.
   The house will be open to mourners 24 hours a day until Sunday,
then his body will be taken to a local mortuary for viewing through
Thursday, Lazo said.
   Mrs. Marcos did not want reporters and photographers to view the
body in a group Thursday, but said journalists could come in later
without their cameras and notebooks, Lazo said.
   A funeral Mass is planned for next Friday, but there are no
definite plans for burial, Lazo said. He said Mrs. Marcos would
keep trying to bring her husband back to his homeland. ``She knows
that's what he wanted.''
   Marcos' mother, who died in May 1988, has been embalmed several
times and lies unburied because Marcos was not allowed into the
Philippines for the funeral.
   Tomas ``Buddy'' Gomez, Philippine consul general in Honolulu and
an outspoken Marcos critic, said he would not attend the memorial
service and urged Mrs. Marcos not to ``exploit her husband's
death.''
   Marcos' death was confirmed at about 1:15 a.m., when his son,
Ferdinand Jr., emerged from the intensive care unit and said his
father had been taken to ``a higher place.''
   ``Hopefully friends and detractors alike will look beyond the
man to see what he stood for _ his vision, his compassion and his
total love of country,'' said the composed younger Marcos.
   ``Father's not here anymore. He's gone,'' Marcos' widow, Imelda,
told about two dozen supporters outside the hospital room, said
family spokesman Roger Peyuan. Somber but dry-eyed as she left the
hospital dressed in black, Mrs. Marcos did not talk to reporters.
   Marcos' family had told doctors to do everything they could to
save his life, and life-support equipment was not turned off until
after Marcos died, Peyuan said.
   A staunch U.S. ally during his presidency, Marcos claimed he was
tricked by U.S. authorities into leaving his homeland. But he said
he had no hard feelings toward former President Reagan or President
Bush, who as vice president traveled to Manila in 1981 and praised
Marcos and his government for ``your adherence to democratic
principles.''
   Bush said Thursday he was saddened by Marcos' death and offered
his condolences to the family.
   Reagan said that ``Nancy and I are deeply saddened and extend
our sympathy and prayers to his family.''
   In Manila, senior military commanders met, but there was no sign
of extraordinary security or any pro-Marcos demonstrations.
   In his home province of Ilocos Norte, where Marcos remained
popular, many people wept at the news.
   A federal grand jury in New York indicted Marcos, his wife and
eight others on criminal racketeering charges last October. In
April, Marcos was separated from the case because of his health.
   In an interview with The Associated Press in November, Marcos
denied allegations that he and Imelda had drained the Philippines
of billions of dollars, and said he did not expect to live through
a trial.
   ``I'll take my destiny, whatever that may be, but I'm going to
fight for my dignity and honor,'' he said.
   Marcos was elected president of his Asian homeland in 1966 and
ruled longer than any other Philippine president.
   In his second four-year term he declared martial law, under
which thousands of opposition politicians, students and other
critics were jailed.
   The pivotal event in Marcos' downfall was the assassination of
political rival Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr. in 1983 as Aquino returned
to the Philippines from self-imposed exile in the United States.
The slaying, which Filipinos blamed on Marcos and his supporters,
galvanized the opposition and led to the election of Aquino's widow.
   Marcos left a nation of 62 million people deep in debt and
facing communist and Moslem-secessionist uprisings.
   Besides the racketeering indictment, which charged him with
stealing nearly $200 million and stashing it in the United States,
Marcos faced lawsuits and investigations in Honolulu, Los Angeles,
Seattle, Washington, D.C., Virginia and his native country. A U.S.
government civil suit ensures that claims against Marcos' estate
did not die with him.
   The Philippine government claimed Marcos and his associates
embezzled up to $10 billion and stashed the funds abroad. But
Marcos was regarded even by his enemies as a clever politician and
strategist who understood his people better than any other
Philippine president.
   He reduced widespread street violence, built more than 60,000
miles of roads and 3,354 schools, and brought electricity to
thousands of rural villages.
   The eldest son of a lawyer and a schoolteacher, Ferdinand
Edralin Marcos was born Sept. 11, 1917, in Sarrat, about 250 miles
north of Manila.
   During World War II, he claimed to have led a guerrilla band
against the Japanese occupiers of the Philippines. The claims,
later largely discredited, helped him as a 31-year-old lawyer to
become the youngest representative elected to the Philippine
Congress.
   In 1954, after an 11-day courtship, Marcos married Imelda
Romualdez, a 26-year-old beauty queen. The oldest of their three
children, Imelda, learned of her father's death from her exile in
Morocco. Ferdinand Jr., called ``Bong Bong,'' and Irene, born in
1960, were with their mother Thursday.

   The Rev. Jesse
Jackson arrived in the Virgin Islands on Thursday and criticized
the Bush administration for its slow response to the U.S.
territory's needs following the devastation caused by Hurricane
Hugo.
   Jackson, accompanied by the territory's Health Commissioner,
Alfred Heath, toured St. Thomas in Gov. Alexander Farrelly's
limousine and briefly spoke with residents of the popular tourist
resort.
   Jackson on Friday is to visit the sister island of St. Croix,
where Farrelly said the storm caused $500 million in damage and
destroyed most of the island's buildings.
   ``The (federal) government was not prepared. Recovery is slow,
there's no plans for rebuilding,'' Jackson said.
   Bush sent about 1,100 military policemen to St. Croix on Sept.
21 to prevent looting, three days after most stores on the island
of 55,000 people had been looted. Relief supplies began arriving
from the United States on Saturday, a week after Hugo struck.
   Hugo, which whipped across the northeastern Caribbean first
before heading north and west to the United States, left at least
33 people dead on the islands of Montserrat, Antigua, Guadeloupe
and Puerto Rico.
   On St. Thomas, most of the power and water was cut and many
building roofs were blown off, but damage was minimal compared to
St. Croix.
   Later Friday, Jackson is also scheduled to visit the neighboring
U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, where Hugo caused widespread
destruction, leaving an estimated 53,000 people homeless and $200
million in damage.
   Officials in Puerto Rico said that on Thursday, 78 percent of
the island was receiving water and that power would be restored to
all of metropolitan San Juan by Sunday, two weeks after Hugo swept
across the island with 125 mph winds.

   Jim Bakker will take the stand Friday to
defend himself against fraud and conspiracy charges, his lawyers
said Thursday after presenting about 50 character witnesses on
behalf of the PTL founder.
   ``When it's over I'll talk,'' Bakker said as he got into his car
at the end of Thursday's testimony.
   Bakker is expected to be the last defense witness.
   ``It could have been today, we're going tomorrow,'' defense
attorney George T. Davis said when asked by reporters if Bakker
would take the stand Friday.
   A federal judge refused Thursday to allow the jury to tour the
Heritage USA retreat built by the disgraced television evangelist.
   ``It would be a waste of time and serve no purpose for the 18
people on the jury to go see it,'' U.S. District Court Judge Robert
Potter said.
   Another Bakker lawyer, Harold Bender, contended that the jury
and six alternates would benefit from seeing the Heritage park in
nearby Fort Mill, S.C. It was closed this week by a bankruptcy
trustee.
   The judge clashed the day before with defense lawyers over the
number of witnesses for Bakker. Potter said he generally allows
only five character witnesses per side. Bender insisted his were
not character witnesses, but satisfied Bakker backers important to
his case.
   The defense has presented at least 72 witnesses since it began
its case Sept. 21. More than 50 of the witnesses testified to
Bakker's character.
   Jurors heard Thursday as they have on previous days from
witnesses who were satisfied with their $1,000 ``Lifetime
Partnership'' memberships that allowed them three nights a year at
the hotel at Heritage USA.
   Prosecutors contend the parterships were oversold and that
Bakker used more than $3.7 million of the proceeds to fund his
lavish lifestyle.
   Lola Penny testified she recently changed her will to leave her
entire estate to the Bakkers without consulting her only child.
Julie Wright, a real estate agent from Woodgreen Village, Mich.,
testified she and her husband bought 30 lifetime partnerships and
were ``very satisfied'' with her $30,000 investment.
   Sharon Creech, a school teacher from Rock Hill, S.C., described
her stay at Heritage Grand Hotel as ``the next best thing to being
... close to Jesus.''
   Bakker resigned in March 1987 after it was revealed that
ministry funds were used to buy the silence of Jessica Hahn, with
whom Bakker had a sexual tryst in 1980.
   Bakker faces up to 120 years in prison and more than $5 million
in fines if convicted on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.
   A group women wearing red ribbons saying ``Enough is enough''
and representing the International Christian Women Fellowship
handed out petitions at the courthouse seeking mercy for Bakker.
The petitions were addressed to the U.S. attorney general.
   ``This man has not been shown any mercy or compassion,''
fellowship president Deanna Smith said. The women removed their
ribbons when Potter ordered them to do so or leave the courtroom.

<HEAD>Yeutter Refuses to Intervene With Canada For Durum Producers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter refused
to take action against Canada for its U.S exports of durum wheat,
saying there is no proof of a ``lack of cooperative spirit on
Canada's part.''
   In a letter to Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., Yeutter blamed a sharp
rise in Canadian durum exports on periodic shortfalls in U.S.
production and tight supplies caused by use of Agriculture
Department loan and export subsidy programs.
   The administration is committed ``to take action against
Canada's wheat export policies in the event that trade problems in
this sector cannot be resolved cooperatively between our two
countries,'' Yeutter wrote.
   ``However a look at the facts surrounding recent increases in
U.S. imports of durum from Canada does not indicate a lack of
cooperative spirit on Canada's part.''
   Canada, which did not ship any durum to the U.S. before 1985,
now has 13 percent of the U.S. market.
   Canada exported 2.3 million bushels to the U.S. in the 1986-87
marketing year, 7.4 million bushels in 1987-88 and 6.84 million
bushels for the 1988-89 marketing year that ended July 31.
   Durum, which is grown primarily in North Dakota, is used to make
pasta.
   Dorgan has been urging Yeutter to pressure Canada to reduce its
durum exports and charged Thursday that he reneged on a promise to
ensure Canada didn't dump grain on U.S. markets after the two
countries' free-trade agreement took effect this year.
   American producers are prohibited from selling wheat in Canada
until the levels of government subsidies in the two countries are
determined to be equal.
   ``I'm terribly disappointed that the secretary has taken the
position that American durum producers are on their own and don't
deserve protection from unfair exports from Canada,'' Dorgan said.

   A woman who survived the crash of a
sightseeing plane on approach to Grand Canyon Airport said Thursday
a pilot struggled with the controls before the aircraft ``shot
straight up'' and flipped over.
   ``I crawled as far away as I could and I waited for the
medics,'' Katherine Mayes told reporters from her hospital bed in
Flagstaff.
   ``I'm sure they got there as fast as they could, but it seemed
an eternity,'' said the 66-year-old woman from Nashville, Tenn.
   The Federal Aviation Administration, meanwhile, disclosed that
the same plane also lost control while landing in February and
cited a ``possible nose-wheel centering problem.''
   Ten of 21 people on board the de Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter were
killed Wednesday when the Grand Canyon Airlines plane veered from
the runway into a wooded hill 300 yards away, authorities said.
   John Lauber, a member of the National Transportation Safety
Board, said transcripts of radio communication between air traffic
controllers and the pilot revealed nothing unusual.
   ``They were cleared to land and that was the last communication
with the aircraft,'' he said.
   The two crew members, pilot William Welch, 47, of Sedona, Ariz.,
and co-pilot Keith Crosson, 43, of Kailua Kona, Hawaii, were among
those killed. The twin-engine plane was returning from a
sightseeing trip over the Grand Canyon.
   Ms. Mayes was among 11 people injured. Three survivors were in
serious condition, one was in guarded condition and seven were in
stable condition Thursday at Flagstaff Medical Center, about 75
miles away.
   Federal investigators were at the crash site Thursday. NTSB team
and representatives of the plane's manufacturers were expected to
spend four or five days at the site.
   The investigation will be ``somewhat more difficult'' by the
lack of a cockpit voice recorder or flight data recorder, Lauber
said. The devices are not required for the DCH-6.
   Investigators had not spoken to survivors by Thursday, Lauber
said.
   Ms. Mayes, who had a severely bruised right shoulder and a
broken pelvis, said she heard and felt the right wheel of the plane
touch the runway. Then she heard the aircraft skid and looked up to
see either the pilot or co-pilot struggling with the controls just
before the airplane ``shot straight up.''
   She said she heard a buzzing sound before the plane flipped over.
   ``I'm really fortunate. God really blessed me. He blessed us
all. He worked a miracle right there before our eyes,'' Ms. Mayes
said.
   She vowed never to fly again, and said she would travel home to
Tennessee by van when she is released from the hospital.
   ``I'm not going back on any plane. I'll crawl before I do
that,'' Ms. Mayes said.
   Welch had worked 3{ years for Grand Canyon Airlines and logged
about 2,000 hours of flight time, Lauber said. Crosson was in his
first year with the airline, said Ronald L. Warren, vice president
and general manager of the airline.
   FAA records showed the 14-year-old plane had a problem while
landing at the airport last Feb. 27. The plane ``lost directional
control on landing. Struck wingtip on runway. Possible nose-wheel
centering problem.''
   The FAA records indicated only two crew members were aboard and
neither was injured. The records listed wind as a contributing
cause in that incident. Warren said he did not know the final
determination of the cause.
   Warren said the plane veered to the right on Feb. 27 but went to
the left Wednesday. On Feb. 27, the plane was piloted by a then-new
employee who was being checked out by the pilot killed in
Wednesday's crash, Warren said.
   FAA spokeswoman Elly Brekke said controllers in the airport's
tower reported seeing the aircraft veer right, then left.

   Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet, an illustrious name
in the dance world since 1946, will become the Birmingham Royal
Ballet next year when it moves to the English Midlands city.
   The Royal Opera House, parent company of the ballet, announced
the name change Thursday along with plans to premiere four new
works in the two years after the move.
   Birmingham, 100 miles northwest of London, has drawn the company
with offers of increased funding, and on Thursday the Opera House
general director Jeremy Isaacs said the city also offered $6.4
million for a new headquarters and studios.
   The company was formed in 1931 by Dame Ninette de Valois as the
Vic-Wells Ballet, performing at Sadler's Wells Theater and the Old
Vic.
   It went to the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden after the
theater was bombed in World War II, and was named the Sadler's
Wells Royal Ballet in 1946.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato said Thursday he is
blocking confirmation of President Bush's nominee to head the Urban
Mass Transit Administration to force a promise that the agency will
study New York City's transit troubles.
   D'Amato, R-N.Y., put a hold on the nomination of Brian W.
Clymer, of Media, Pa., preventing a confirmation vote by the full
Senate.
   Clymer, a certified public accountant, is a former director of
the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority.
   D'Amato apparently is not the only senator objecting to Clymer's
nomination. According to reports published last month, Clymer's
nomination was blocked by other senators because of a questionable
link to the scandal-plagued Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   Clymer's accounting firm reportedly received no-bid contracts to
audit the books of a Pennsylvania developer that received a grant
from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Clymer was not available for comment late Thursday, according to
Richard Centner, an UMTA spokesman. Clymer has been filling the
administrator's job since Alfred Dellibovi left the job to became
deputy HUD secretary.
   Last April, Dellibovi announced UMTA would investigate safety at
the MTA, which has been plagued by fires, doors opening on moving
trains, crashes and other hazards.
   But on Thursday, the senator said ``virtually no progress has
been made on this probe and it appears to be going nowhere.''

   The Bush administration is ready to approve a
$3.2 billion contract enabling Saudi Arabia to buy American-made
tanks, Rep. Mike Oxley, R-Ohio, said Thursday.
   The deal involves 315 M-1 A-2 tanks, and should be finalized by
the end of the year, Oxley said.
   General Dynamics Corp. will build the tanks if the arrangement
is completed. By law, Congress must have the chance to say no to
the sale.
   If it goes through, the deal will increase production by 20
percent at General Dynamics' its Lima, Ohio, facility, Oxley said.
   The congressman said General Dynamics hadn't been counting on
landing the Saudi business.
   ``Clearly there are always sensitive issues when you're talking
about military sales to Arab states, even moderate Arab states,''
Oxley said.
   Before approving the sale the administration had to be convinced
the new generation of M-1 tanks were vital to Saudi Arabia's
defense, he said.

   China said Thursday that reports it had begun
unofficial talks with the Vietnam-backed government in Cambodia are
``entirely groundless.''
   China ``has never had any relations with the illegal Phnom Penh
regime,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
   The chief editor of a government-sponsored magazine in Phnom
Penh recently told The Associated Press that three Chinese
officials had discussed resumption of trade ties during a visit to
Cambodia early this year as part of a Thai business group.
   A Foreign Ministry official said another group of 15 Chinese
officials was expected in January, and an East European diplomat
said he believed Cambodian military officials had conducted talks
with Chinese officials in the Laotian capital of Vientiane.
   China is the main backer of the Khmer Rouge and other resistance
factions fighting Vietnamese troops and the forces of the Phnom
Penh government.
   Earlier Thursday, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Vietnam's
claimed withdrawal of the last of its troops from Cambodia was a
sham, and indicated China will continue to arm the resistance
forces until a political settlement is reached among the warring
factions.
   The ministry said: ``Before a comprehensive, just and reasonable
political settlement of the Kampuchea (Cambodia) issue is realized,
China will never establish economic relations'' or any other
relations with the Phnom Penh government.
   ``It is despicable and futile for the Phnom Penh side to
fabricate lies with ulterior motives, split up and sow discord and
confuse public opinion.''

   President Bush on Thursday announced his
selection of former Labor Secretary Ann Dore McLaughlin to head his
newly formed commission on air terrorism.
   The seven-member panel was created by Bush last spring, in the
aftermath of the December 1988 explosion of a Pan AM jetliner over
Scotland, to investigate ways to better protect the skies from acts
of terrorism.
   McLauglin, who was labor secretary in the final year of the
Reagan administration, is a senior fellow at the Urban Institute in
Washington, a private public-policy research organization.
   Other members named by Bush to the commission included Gen.
Thomas C. Richards, the deputy commander in chief of the U.S.
European Command headquarters in Stuttgart, West Germany; and
Edward Hidalgo, of Virginia, a Washington lawyer.
   Also serving on the panel are four members of Congress: Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.; Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J.; Rep.
John Paul Hammerschmidt, R-Ark.; and Rep. James L. Oberstar, D-Minn.

   Troops and police went on full alert
Friday and security was reinforced at vital installations after
President Corazon Aquino banned the burial of Ferdinand Marcos in
the Philippines.
   The 72-year-old Marcos, who ruled longer than any Philippine
president, died Thursday in exile in Hawaii, and opposition leaders
urged Mrs. Aquino to reconsider and ``close a painful chapter in
our history.''
   Early Friday, Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, chief of the National
Capital Region Defense Command, ordered the alert in the Manila
area. Biazon reinforced security at all radio and television
stations, electric power plants, telephone exchanges and other
essential installations.
   Marcos supporters announced plans for a Roman Catholic Mass and
rally Friday, but there was no sign of trouble early Friday. Marcos
loyalists have been blamed for some of the six armed attempts to
topple Mrs. Aquino since she took power Feb. 25, 1986, after a
popular uprising ended Marcos' 20-year rule.
   Manila radio stations interrupted their programming to announce
his death, and the former president's fellow northerners wept at
the news. Manila newspapers bannered news of Marcos' death in
Friday's editions.
   ``The national mood hinges on the question of forgiveness from
both sides,'' said the Philippine Daily Inquirer in a front-page
editorial. ``Nothing less than the fate of the nation hinges on the
story's resolution.''
   In a statement Thursday, Mrs. Aquino expressed her condolences
to Marcos' family but ruled out any burial in the Philippines.
   ``In the interest of the safety of those who will take the death
of Mr. Marcos in widely and passionately conflicting ways, and for
the tranquility of the state and the order of society, the remains
of Ferdinand E. Marcos will not be allowed to be brought to our
country until such time as the government, be it under this
administration or the succeeding one, shall otherwise decide.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the Federal Aviation Administration would seek to prevent any
flight from carrying Marcos' body from the United States to the
Philippines.
   One Marcos supporter, Oliver Lozano, said loyalists would stage
a symbolic funeral march to protest Mrs. Aquino's decision, but he
did not say when.
   Marcos' only son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., told Manila television
station GMA that the family would try to persuade Mrs. Aquino to
change her mind. Nicanor Yniguez, former speaker of the National
Assembly, called Mrs. Aquino's refusal ``the height of sacrilege.''
   Marcos' death was announced after the close of the business day
in the Philippines, and there was little public reaction to the
passing of the man who ruled 21 years, longer than any other
Filipino leader.
   ``I'm not surprised,'' said Jazmine So, 42, a Manila merchant.
``It was expected. I don't know what will happen, but the situation
will not affect me.''
   In Marcos' home province of Ilocos Norte, many wept at the news
of his death.
   ``It is painful, but what can I do,'' said Ernie Suarez, a
former soldier in Batac, 230 miles north of Manila. ``We wanted him
back alive and we still want him to return now that he's dead.''
   ``Our family cried when we heard about the news,'' said Gigi
Nalupta, 29, in a telephone interview from Batac. ``We are sick at
heart because we loved him very, very much.''
   Rolando Abadilla, vice governor of Ilocos Norte and Marcos'
former police intelligence chief in Manila, said the former
president's supporters would exhaust ``all legal means'' to arrange
his burial here but if that failed, ``we will decide when the time
comes'' on alternatives.
   Mrs. Aquino had refused to let Marcos attend the funeral of his
mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who died May 4, 1988, or the burial
of his sister, Elizabeth Keon, who died in December 1986.
   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos' body, which has been embalmed several
times, remains in Batac.
   In Manila, Vice President Salvador Laurel, leader of the
opposition Nacionalista Party and a leading Marcos opponent, urged
Mrs. Aquino to let Marcos be buried at home.
   ``The passing of former President Marcos should now close a
painful chapter in our history and put to rest all bitterness and
rancor that have divided our people,'' Laurel said.
   ``Let us now strive to bring about national reconciliation,
which we failed to achieve during his lifetime.''
   Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile also urged Mrs. Aquino to change her
mind. Enrile was Marcos' defense minister but then led the February
1986 military mutiny that triggered the uprising that swept Mrs.
Aquino to power. He was fired as defense minister Nov. 23, 1986,
after a failed coup against Mrs. Aquino by his followers.
   ``I am calling on the president to allow him to return. This
would allow people who believed in the former president to give his
due,'' Enrile said in a radio interview.
   But Senate President Jovito Salonga, a longtime Marcos opponent,
said he will support Mrs. Aquino's decision.
   In her statement, Mrs. Aquino said Marcos' ``rule changed our
country.''
   ``In what ways he changed it, I leave for now to others and
ultimately to history to describe,'' she said. ``For at this moment
of passage, we must allow such a loss to transcend _ for his family
_ politics and history, and the opinions of men and women.
   ``I personally condole deeply with the family he leaves behind
with all sincerity, for I and my children know the pain of such a
loss.''
   Mrs. Aquino's husband, former Sen. Benigno Aquino, was
assassinated in August 1983 moments after he arrived at Manila's
airport to challenge Marcos for leadership of the country. He had
been in self-imposed exile in the United States. Forty people,
mostly soldiers, are on trial for his murder.

<HEAD>With AM-Obit-Marcos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN GUERRERO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Despite a reputation as a tyrant and
an embezzler, friends recall Ferdinand Marcos as a brilliant,
charming man, jealous of things that were his but with a soft spot
for the welfare of his friends.
   The 72-year-old former president died Thursday in a Honolulu
hospital of cardiac arrest.
   ``I know he was a strongman,'' recalled Primitivo Lovina, an
associate of Marcos when the two served in the House of
Representatives. ``But his greatest weakness was he had a soft
heart for friends. I think that caused his downfall.''
   Conversations with former associates of Marcos reveal a complex
figure _ magnanimous and petty; heroic and shallow.
   ``Apo was very, very cordial and warm to us regardless of who
you are,'' recalled former Marcos bodyguard Romeo Amansec,
referring to the former president by a Filipino honorific for
distinguished man.
   Amansec said Marcos always told his employees that if they had
any problems, they were to go to his military chief of staff, Gen.
Fabian Ver.
   ``If he cannot help you, I will,'' Amansec quoted Marcos as
saying.
   Marcos was a study in contrast.
   He was a brilliant student who topped the national bar
examinations in 1939. But as president, he flouted and manipulated
the law to amass power and wealth.
   Marcos drafted grandiose plans for a ``New Society'' to propel
his impoverished nation into social justice and prosperity. But
under his ``New Society,'' his family and friends prospered at the
expense of millions of his countrymen whose living standards
plummeted.
   The man who would in 1972 impose martial law and imprison
thousands was also remembered as a passionate youth who courted
women with roses and poems.
   ``When it comes to women, he's a gentleman. He is like a Sir
Walter Raleigh. He uses poetic language.'' said Lovina.
   Marcos' charm was tempered with a passionate jealousy. After he
wooed and wed Imelda Romualdez in an 11-day courtship in 1954,
Lovina, a former Imelda suitor, ran into the newlyweds in a Manila
theater.
   ``I was with my girlfriend then and we said `congratulations and
best wishes,''' Lovina said. ``I told Meldy, `You didn't even tell
me were getting married. I just read it in the papers.' She said,
`I also didn't expect it.' Then you know what happened? Marcos
pulled Imelda's hand and dragged her away from us. We were really
surprised,'' Lovina said.
   Lovina, who knew Imelda before she met Marcos, never got in
touch with her again for fear of offending her husband. At a golf
course several weeks later, Lovina and Imelda stood beside each
other like strangers in front of Marcos. But after Marcos left for
the clubhouse, Imelda turned to Lovina and apologized.
   More than 30 years later, Lovina visited the Marcos family in
their Hawaiian exile. He joked about the chilly reception he
received during their meeting at the theater.
   According to Lovina, Marcos told him, ``You had a reputation of
being a playboy. I was very young then.''
   Friends recall Marcos as a master political tactician, who used
Imelda as one of his ``aces'' when all else failed. During
political campaigns, Imelda was always there to charm the crowds.
   ``Marcos always worked using three OPLANS (operations plans),''
said Jesus Quevenco, a Marcos look-alike who served as a
``stand-in'' for Marcos during the runup to his 1965 election as
president.
   ``Imelda was always the last resort,'' Quevenco said. ``And that
never fails.''
   In the final years of his presidency, Marcos faced several
assassination attempts, always _ according to former aides _ with
aplomb.
   Amansec, a former navy explosives expert, recalls disarming
several bombs, including one at the Manila Folk Arts Center in
1985, which he says could have leveled the building.
   Amansec, now a hotel security guard, said that when the
president was told of the attempt, Marcos replied calmly: ``Is that
so?''
   ``He got the brains, the personality, the leadership but I
believe that he did not use them really properly,'' Lovina said.
``Had he done it, we would have been the greatest nation in the
world.''

   Brooklyn Rivera, leader of Nicaragua's
Indian rebels, returned home from exile Thursday but said he does
not know if his 3,000 fighters will lay down their arms under a
Central American peace accord.
   ``I'm coming to contribute in a positive way, to advance an
internal peace process in the country,'' said Rivera, 37, who left
Nicaragua for Costa Rica in 1981 to lead an Indian armed struggle.
   The Miskito leader, head of the most populous tribe of
Nicaraguan Indians, now heads the YATAMA organization that groups
Miskito, Sumo and Rama Indians and three groups of blacks of West
Indian descent living on the Caribbean coast.
   At the airport, Rivera signed papers required of all returning
exiles saying he wants to join the civic process by accepting
amnesty.
   YATAMA maintains it is not covered by a peace agreement signed
by five Central American presidents on Aug. 7 that calls for
Nicaragua's other rebels, the U.S.-backed Contras, to disband and
relocate from Honduran camps.
   Rivera said 2,000 Indian combatants remain in the coast region
and another 1,000 in Honduras. The YATAMA coalition fought
alongside the Contras and, like them, used to received U.S.
military aid and still receives non-lethal aid.
   ``What will be done with those self-defense forces is still not
decided,'' said Rivera.
   He said he belongs to no political party because ``the
government in bad faith stopped me from returning to the country
last June,'' imposing what he called a ``series of absurd
conditions'' that included agreement not to form Indian political
parties in the coastal region.
   That condition, he said, was meant to delay or prevent creation
of a political organization to represent interests of Atlantic
coast ethnic groups. Miskitos account for 130,000 of the 275,000
members of six ethnic groups in the region.
   Rivera said they could take part in the electoral process either
by voting in their own regional authorities or through political
parties that would represent their land and autonomy interests.
   He is too late to register as the deadline for political parties
was Sept. 8 and candidates have to register by Friday.
   Residents of the thinly settled Caribbean coast have resisted
efforts to bring their communities under control of the central
government, both by the Sandinistas and the Somoza family rulers
the Sandinistas ousted in 1979.
   An autonomy plan approved by the government in 1988 does not
satisfy the community's needs, he said.

   A mortar shell exploded and killed two
Fort Stewart soldiers during a training exercise Thursday, a day
after three soldiers died in Oklahoma when an artillery shell
overshot its target.
   The Fort Stewart soldiers were killed while firing 4.2-inch
shells at the base's mortar range, said Lt. Colonel Herbert Blanks,
spokesman for the Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker, Ala., which
sent a team of investigators.
   Maj. Donald Keeling, spokesman at Fort Stewart, said the mortar
that exploded Thursday morning could have been faulty or one of the
victims might have made an error setting the timing fuse on the
device.
   ``At this point, we really don't know what happened, but they
were the ones handling the munitions,'' he said.
   Keeling said mortar rounds can be set to explode either in the
air or on impact. But it was not known yet whether the round
exploded in its tube or after being detonated at the base near
Savannah in southeastern Georgia.
   A 4.2-inch mortar is a short-barreled cannon which can be fired
from a position on the ground or from a vehicle like an open-back
armored personnel carrier.
   Authorities did not release the names of the victims pending
notification of relatives.
   At Fort Sill, Okla., Army investigators Thursday inspected a
crater where a stray round hit and exploded the day before, killing
three soldiers and injuring 23.
   The Fort Sill soldiers, in the seventh week of an eight-week
training course at the sprawling Field Artillery Center in
southwest Oklahoma, were lined up to leave a training site when the
artillery round hit about 5 p.m.
   ``We know it happened. Now we're going to find out why it
happened,'' said Brig. Gen. Lou Hennies, director of Army safety at
Fort Rucker, which also sent investigators to Fort Sill.
   Officials said the round from a howitzer, a type of big gun,
overshot a target area by about one-half mile and fell 10 to 15
feet behind the soldiers, who were in formation.
   Hennies said investigators hadn't determined which artillery was
involved in the accident. Post spokesman said 105mm, 155mm and
8-inch howitzers were being fired Wednesday.
   Blanks said the two accidents were not similar.
   ``This was an entirely different type of accident than the one
at Fort Sill. ... This was not the same type of equipment _ this
was an indirect firing weapon.''
   Blood-spattered camouflage fatigues, helmets, boots, jackets and
other military wear was strewn across about a 25-yard area at the
Fort Sill accident site. The crater measured about one yard across
and about a foot deep.
   ``They heard a whistle of incoming, a yellow blast and then they
were blown off their feet,'' Col. William Gonzales, commander at
Reynolds Army Hospital at Fort Sill, said some of the soldiers told
him. ``It's amazing what the power of a shell can do.''
   Jon Long, another post spokesman, said the accident site was
about four miles from the populated area of the post, which has
21,000 soldiers.
   Master Sgt. Michael Brown said Pvt. 1 Jimmy N. McCain, 21, of
Troy, Ala., and Spec. Thomas P. Boyle, 25, of Ventura, Calif., were
killed. The names of the third soldier killed at Fort Sill and the
two victims at Fort Stewart were withheld pending notification of
relatives.
   Six soldiers injured at Fort Sill underwent surgery Wednesday
night, Gonzales said. Two were in critical condition, and four were
serious. One soldier's leg was amputated.
   In all, 22 soldiers remained hospitalized Thursday. Fourteen of
them were in stable condition and two were in good condition.

   President Bush welcomed Colombian President
Virgilio Barco to the White House on Thursday evening with praise
for Barco's crackdown on drug traffickers and assurances of help to
improve trade to support Colombia's economy.
   However, there was no movement to help raise the price of coffee
_ Colombia's major legal export and the subject of dispute between
the two countries rising from U.S. attacks on international price
supports.
   At the meeting, which stretched from the originally scheduled
half-hour to about 1{ hours, Bush ``indicated his intention to work
closely with President Barco to expand bilateral trade and
investment opportunities in order to spur Colombia's economic
growth,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a
statement.
   Bush said he had asked U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills
``to lead an interagency effort to examine urgently what can be
done'' to improve trade benefits, according to Fitzwater.
   U.S. officials have said trade concessions are being considered
for some Colombian exports such as flowers and textiles. Another
possibility is providing inducements for U.S. private investment in
Colombia.
   But on coffee, Bush only reiterated that the United States is
prepared to resume talks with Colombia and others on renewal of the
International Coffee Agreement, Fitzwater said.
   Last week, Bush rejected a plea by Barco for a one-year
reinstatement of a coffee-export quota system that had helped
Colombian farmers.
   World coffee prices have fallen by about a third sharply since
the 74-nation cartel suspended export quotas after the United
States, backed by some Central American countries who wanted larger
quotas, blocked a new agreement in July.
   Colombian officials have suggested it will be difficult to keep
farmers from switching from coffee to coca. Most cocaine entering
the United States is grown in Peru and Bolivia and processed in
Colombia, where the major cocaine gangs are based.
   Another issue raised at the meeting was U.S. drug consumption,
which Barco has long criticized as the fuel supporting the violent
drug traffickers who plague his country.
   ``The two presidents talked about the domestic drug problem in
the United States and the administration's efforts to reduce
consumption,'' Fitzwater said.
   The Colombian president, making his first visit to Washington
since launching the crackdown on drug traffickers last month, told
reporters before the meeting that he was seeking no additional
financial help in his country's battle against traffickers.
   ``We have received ... help with our problem,'' Barco said,
referring to $65 million in emergency assistance from the United
States, during a photo session with Bush in the White House Rose
Garden.
   Bush expressed appreciation ``on the part of the American
people'' for Barco's efforts to combat drug traffickers, but he
declined to say during the photo session what help the United
States might provide on trade matters.
   Participants in the White House meeting included national drug
policy director William J. Bennett, Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft, White House
Chief of Staff John H. Sununu and Deputy Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger.
   Barco met earlier Thursday with Bennett under tight security at
the Colombian ambassador's home.
   At that meeting, Bennett said later, Barco raised various
issues, including trade matters such as coffee and cut flowers. But
Bennett declined to provide details of the help Barco wants,
saying, ``We were mainly there to listen.''
   During a meeting with members of the House, Barco raised the
issue of U.S. assault-style weapons being smuggled into his country
for use by drug traffickers, said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.,
chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse.
   Barco stressed not only the need for Americans to reduce their
consumption of cocaine, ``but also the manufacture of automatic
weapons that are being distributed in international markets that
are killing his people,'' Rangel said.
   Bennett said he and Barco had discussed this problem at an
earlier meeting, but the Colombian president did not raise it again
today.
   ``It's a matter I'm concerned about,'' Bennett said, adding that
he had spoken with Stephen Higgins, the director of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms who ``assured me there will be more
attention paid to this, more resources, more of his people are
going to be one this.''
   The Bush administration has banned the import of assault rifles,
but has not acted against domestic manufacture of such weapons.
   Among other subjects raised by Barco with the House members were
his concerns over the manufacture of chemicals used to process
cocaine, foreign mercenaries and laundering of drug money.
   ``He emphasized that while he didn't need troops, he needed a
lot of help in these other areas,'' Rangel said.
   Barco ordered emergency measures to crack down on the drug
traffickers after the Aug. 18 assassination of leading presidential
candidate Luis Carlos Galan, an outspoken foe of the drug trade.
   Those measures, including the resumption of extradition to the
United States of suspected drug traffickers, prompted the
traffickers to declare ``total war'' on the government. They have
set off bombs, killed several people at the Bogota airport and
vowed to kill 10 judges for every trafficker extradited.
   Since 1981, about 50 judges and 170 judicial employees have been
killed and judges this year have repeatedly walked off the job or
threatened to strike over a lack of security. Colombia's former
justice minister, Monica de Greiff, resigned last week after
receiving numerous death threats.
   Bennett said he stressed to Barco ``that American public opinion
was strongly behind what he is doing. Americans salute his courage,
his resolution, his bravery and the bravery and resoluteness of the
Colombian people.''

graf, ``My kids ..., spelling of hordes.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards said he
kicked his heroin addiction because his children were exposed to
repeated police raids.
   ``I was on the run all the time,'' Richards said about his
drug-taking in the 1970s when he lived with German actress Anita
Pallenberg and their two children.
   ``My kids were growing up getting used to letting in hordes of
policemen. There was a knock at the door: Is it room service or is
it the cops?'' he told British Broadcasting Corp. radio in a New
York interview to be broadcast here next month.
   The group is on a North American concert tour.
   Richards, 45, known as ``the wildest Rolling Stone,'' also
admitted he feared being sent to prison.
   ``The funny thing with that stuff is that you don't particularly
notice it until it comes to a huge head,'' Richards said. ``In
Canada, I guess I realized this could not go on any more. This had
to stop.''
   Richards was charged with heroin trafficking in Toronto in 1977
and escaped a heavy jail sentence by agreeing to a free concert for
the blind and treatment for his addiction.
   ``I can't even imagine it now, some of the things I used to go
through with that stuff,'' he said.

   An important opposition leader broke
away from a 14-party coalition Thursday, further weakening a
fractious bloc that seeks to unseat the ruling Sandinistas in next
year's elections.
   Mauricio Diaz, president of the People's Social Christian Party,
said he was leaving the National Opposition Union (UNO) because
leftist parties in the coalition had too much power.
   However, an official of UNO told The Associated Press that
high-ranking members of Diaz's party had denied there was a split
in ranks.
   ``UNO's political council is in session right now ... and the
executive commission of the People's Social Christian Party is in
the meeting,'' UNO spokesman Luis Sanchez said Thursday evening
after Diaz announced his decision at a news conference.
   ``They insist that the party as such will maintain itself within
UNO and that if Diaz is breaking away, he's doing so on his own,''
Sanchez added.
   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, publisher of the opposition
newspaper La Prensa, and Virgilio Godoy are the UNO presidential
and vice presidential candidates for the Feb. 25 elections.
   Mrs. Chamorro and Godoy are running against President Daniel
Ortega and Vice President Sergio Ramirez of the leftist Sandinista
National Liberation Front, which has been in power for a decade.
   Diaz told reporters his party would support Erick Ramirez, the
presidential candidate of the splinter Social Christian Party.
Diaz's party has six deputies in the National Assembly, the
third-largest opposition party in the country's single chamber
legislature.
   Apparently the split came when UNO was discussing how to
apportion candidacies among its 14 parties for the 90 seats in the
National Assembly.
   According to the Nicaraguan Constitution, the Assembly has 90
seats based on the last census estimate, but defeated presidential
candidates are guaranteed one seat each. Apart from UNO and the
Sandinista Front, at least six parties are running presidential
candidates.
   The current National Assembly has 96 deputies, as six parties
apart from the Sandinista Front ran presidential candidates in the
1984 elections.
   The deadline for registering candidates at all levels is Friday.
   Diaz said UNO offered his party two deputies' candidacies while
the Communist and Socialist parties were offered six seats each. He
said this was incongruent, because his party was the fourth largest
vote-getter in the 1984 elections, while the Communists were fifth
and the Socialists sixth.
   ``Leftist parties within UNO have too much influence and great
power,'' Diaz said at the news conference, sitting next to Ramirez.
   The choice of Godoy as the vice presidential candidate four
weeks ago created a crisis in UNO because some parties favored a
rightist businessman. The crisis was finally resolved and Godoy was
accepted, but not before some parties had threatened to break away.
   The leadership of Godoy's party, the Independent Liberal, also
has been having internal power struggles.
   UNO members _ 12 legally registered parties and two splinter
groups _ bickered for weeks over the procedure for apportioning the
deputies' slots, and were still discussing the matter less than 24
hours before the deadline for registering them.

   When frustrated stuntman Karel
Soucek became the first person in 23 years to take the plunge over
Niagara Falls in a barrel in 1984, he proclaimed himself ``the last
of the Niagara daredevils.''
   But the Czech-born Canadian Soucek was no prophet. On Wednesday,
Canadians Peter DeBernardi and Jeffrey Petkovich became the third
and fourth men to accomplish the stunt since Soucek's ride and the
first duo to ever go over the falls together.
   ``Perhaps Karel Soucek's success motivates them,'' Niagara Parks
Police Chief Wilfred J. Derbyshire said Thursday of the increase of
attempts during this decade.
   Overall, 12 adventurers have gone over the falls in a barrel.
Nine have survived the 176-foot plunge. Five men have gone over the
falls in the 1980s, a record for one decade.
   Derbyshire said the increase of successful attempts can be
partly attributed to the proximity of recent launches to the shore.
   With a short stretch of river before the infamous drop, the
barrels often stay clear of most rocks hidden under the cascading
water.
   The high-tech construction of the barrels, Derbyshire admitted,
is probably most responsible for the successful attempts.
   DeBernardi solicited $50,000 from local businesses to construct
the barrel, and had planned the stunt and the construction of the
barrel since the spring of 1988.
   The two survived the voyage with minor cuts and no serious
injuries.
   ``Were we scared?,'' Petkovich, 25, said, ``What for? There's no
doubt that I'd do it again. No sweat.''
   DeBernardi, 42, was more reserved. ``It's something I always
wanted to do. It's a challenge. It's the greatest stunt in the
world, and I'm glad to be alive.''
   The romanticized stunt has been performed for different reasons
since Annie Edson Taylor became the first to survive the plunge on
Oct. 24, 1901.
   Some did it for profit, like Red Hill, Jr., who died performing
the stunt in 1951 to raise money for a memorial to his father, a
famous riverman along the Niagara.
   Others, like Soucek and Steven Trotter, who went over in 1985,
did it in an attempt to bolster their careers as stuntmen.
   Petkovich and DeBernardi, however, said their motivation was to
show kids there is an alternative to drugs.
   ``If you can make that connection, you've got a better
imagination than me,'' retorted Dennis Schafer, general manager of
the Niagara Parks Commission.
   Petkovich and DeBernardi were charged with unlawfully performing
a stunt in the park, which carries a fine of $500. DeBernardi also
faces an additional $1,000 fine for trespassing after he was warned
18 months ago not to perform the stunt.
   Derbyshire and Schafer said the Parks Commission will be on the
lookout for attempts in the near future.
   ``It is not whether you fail or triumph,'' reads the inscription
on the grave of Soucek, who died six months after his falls stunt
during a barrel drop in the Houston Astrodome. ``It's that you keep
your word ... and at least try.''

   Former first lady Nancy Reagan will pinch-hit
for her husband in an appearance next week here that was to have
been Ronald Reagan's first since undergoing skull surgery, a
spokesman said Thursday.
   ``To be on the safe side, his physicians have recommended he not
travel away from Los Angeles until the second week in October,''
Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said in a statement.
   He said the former president's recuperation ``continues to go
well and his physicians are fully satisfied with his progress.''
   Reagan was working at home and was expected to return to his
office in about a week, he said.
   Reagan had been scheduled to speak Monday at the California
Grocers Association annual conference here.
   It would have been his first address since he underwent surgery
Sept. 8 at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., to drain fluid that
had accumulated on his brain after he was thrown from a horse July
4.
   Grocers Association Vicki Vance said Thursday's cancellation
came as a surprise.
   ``We were told his doctors didn't want him to fly, so we said we
could limo him up from Southern California,'' she said.
   ``Then they told us they didn't want him to travel at all. I
guess they just tried to hold off as long as they could.''

   John Bright, a co-founder of the
Screen Writers Guild whose stories led to such movies as ``The
Public Enemy'' and helped popularize the gangster film genre, has
died at 81.
   Bright's Sept. 14 death from a stroke was reported Wednesday.
   Bright, a onetime Chicago newspaper reporter, teamed with Kubic
Glasmon, another former journalist, for a series of stories that
became films, beginning with 1931's ``The Public Enemy,'' which
starred James Cagney.
   He also had screen credits on such films as ``I Walk Alone,''
``The Brave Bulls,'' ``The Kid From Cleveland'' and ``Close-up.''
   Bright moved to Mexico for several years rather than cooperate
with a McCarthy-era House UnAmerican Activities Committee
investigation of alleged communist influence in the film industry.
   Upon his return, he wrote magazine articles and plays.
   Survivors include his wife, Mildred, and two sons.

   Memory is playing tricks on Southern
Californians who think the current smog siege is any worse than
usual, experts said Thursday.
   The dirty, brown-tinted air that has prompted first-stage smog
alerts in some areas this week is a seasonal tradition, said
Claudia Keith of the South Coast Air Quality Management District.
   ``I think people kind of forgot what it's like here now,'' Ms.
Keith said. ``We had strange weather last week, foggy and rainy,
and they thought fall had started. We sort of got a resurgence of
summer this week.''
   A mild August with relatively cool, low-smog days also may have
lulled Southern Californians into a false sense of security, she
said. The smog season traditionally runs from May to October.
   Forecaster Bob Grebe of the National Weather Service concurred.
   ``September is hot and smoggy in Southern California,'' Grebe
said Thursday. Atmospheric conditions create an inversion layer
that works to trap pollutants, he said.
   Contributing to the burning eyes and breathing problems that
smog inflicts is a buildup of nitrogen dioxide that is common in
the fall, Ms. Keith said.
   The pollutant stems primarily from vehicle emissions and without
summer's strong sun to burn it off, it ``just sticks in the air,''
she said. Nitrogen dioxide is responsible for the brown-tinged look
of Southern California skies.
   ``It was very smoggy this week, there's no doubt about it,'' Ms.
Keith conceded. ``On top of that there was the nitrogen dioxide, so
it was a double whammy.''
   In 1989 overall, there were somewhat fewer smog alerts than in
years past, Ms. Keith said.
   ``Mostly that was because we had such a good August,'' with
nature lending a hand by providing favorable weather conditions,
she said.
   ``I'd love to say it was because no one was driving, but I
can't,' she added.
   Fifty-two first-stage smog alerts were declared this year after
the pollution index rose above 200 parts per million. There were no
second-stage alerts, which Ms. Keith said are rare in any year.
   The district advises children and the elderly to curtail
activities and remain indoors during a first-stage smog alert.

   The fund that has helped millions of Americans
buy homes with FHA mortgages is in the red for the first time in
history and will need up to $5 billion from Congress over the next
few years, government auditors say.
   Most of the shortfall stemmed from homeowners in economically
strapped areas of the country being unable to make their house
payments, the head of the General Accounting Office told a Senate
panel Wednesday.
   GAO chief Charles A. Bowsher said the much-publicized problems
of waste and mismanagement at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, which oversees FHA, also are partly to blame.
   Bowsher was scheduled to review the report again today for the
House Budget Committee.

   A former top housing official was the key
figure to see for developers seeking federal grants _ even after he
left the Department of Housing and Urban Development _ former
regional housing officials say.
   The official, Lance H. Wilson, became the fourth former top HUD
official to refuse to testify when he appeared Wednesday before a
House subcommittee probing alleged influence-peddling and
mismanagement at the agency.
   As former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce did a day earlier, Wilson
asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
Wilson said he had been labeled a ``prime candidate for a criminal
investigation'' and said he was convinced ``the subcommittee had
already prejudged me.''
   Also on Wednesday, a former HUD staffer told of investigating a
project on behalf of a contributor to President Bush's 1980
campaign for the vice presidency.

   Marines on bulldozers cleared the path
for volunteers as they began driving carloads of baby food, canned
goods and clothing into rural areas cut off by Hurricane Hugo.
   ``We're trying to get it to people,'' Gloria Pipkin, director of
a relief station in Jamestown on the edge of the Francis Marion
National Forest, said Wednesday. ``We found today a family that did
not have food for three days.''
   The devastating hurricane struck South Carolina a week ago today.
   President Bush, who has declared parts of the Carolinas disaster
areas but has been criticized by some local officials for not
responding faster, was expected to fly to South Carolina on Friday
to inspect the damage. A White House survey team was en route to
Charleston late Wednesday to review sites where Bush might visit.

   Parliament early today indicted former
Premier Andreas Papandreou on bribery charges in a $210 million
bank embezzlement scandal that helped topple his nearly decade-old
socialist administration.
   The 300-member unicameral legislature voted 166 to 121 that
Papandreou and four of his senior Cabinet ministers should stand
trial before a special court in connection with the Bank of Crete
scandal.
   It was the first time in Greece's history that a civilian
political leader was ordered to stand trial for alleged wrongdoing
in office.
   The governing coalition of conservatives and Communists, formed
after June elections that removed Papandreou from power, controls
173 seats in Parliament so Papandreou's indictment had seemed a
certainty when debate began.

   Democratic Party officials, voicing a
determination to ``start taking on George Bush,'' are airing
campaign-style themes and encouraging their congressional majority
to step up the challenge to the Republican president.
   In addition to the rhetoric, a major order of business today for
the nearly 400 members of the Democratic National Committee was to
roll back part of a party rules compromise reached at Atlanta in
1988. The DNC members also were set to vote themselves a voice when
any such deals are cut in the future.
   Party chairman Ronald H. Brown told state party leaders
Wednesday that everywhere he travels Democrats ask him, ``When are
you going to take off the gloves, when are you going to start
taking on George Bush?''
   ``We ought to be willing to stand up as Democrats and articulate
those differences,'' said Brown, to ``give the American people a
choice.''

   The nation's biggest geothermal
complex is literally running out of steam, casting doubts on a
clean technology that had been the very symbol of alternative
energy.
   During the past year, The Geysers, a 30-square-mile region in
the isolated mountains 90 miles north of San Francisco, has seen
steam pressure drop at a rate much faster than expected.
   The decline is so dramatic it eventually could halve electricity
production at the 28-plant site, which is owned by several
utilities, according to state Energy Commission Chairman Charles
Imbrecht.
   That could cost the companies hundreds of millions of dollars,
Imbrecht said. California taxpayers also stand to lose millions
because the state collects royalties that are tied to electricity
or steam production.
   Worldwide, there are 67 geothermal fields producing electricity
or under development to make power. The rest of the industry is
keeping a close eye on how companies cope with the problems at The
Geysers because of the field's size and nearly 30-year operating
history, said John Mock of the U.S. Energy Department.

   The basement room is sparsely furnished, just a
battered dresser, two chairs, a couch that converts to a bed, and a
faded yellow carpet covering a concrete floor.
   But the humble trappings of Leszek's room belie his status as a
future member of the economic elite in his native Poland.
   ``I want to build a house in Poland, so here I have to work to
make the money,'' said Leszek, who, like other Poles interviewed,
spoke on condition that his surname not be used.
   Leszek (pronounced LESH-ek) is one of thousands of Poles who
have fled the deteriorating economic situation in their homeland,
where even staples such as bread and milk are often missing from
shops.
   In 1988, of the 63,500 Poles who entered the United States as
tourists, about 14,000 stayed longer than their visas permitted,
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service figures show. Tourist
visas usually are valid from three to nine months.
   A higher percentage of Poles illegally overstay their visas than
residents of any other major country, said INS researcher Robert
Warren.
   That number has fallen from 22,000 since 1986, the year a new
immigration law mandating penalties for employers who hire illegal
aliens went into effect.
   But the number of Poles illegally working here is still
considerable, said INS spokesman Carl Henderson in Chicago, where
the majority of such Poles end up. Polish restaurants and shops
abound in this city, and Poles can get by with learning a minimum
of English.
   At Poland's consulate in Chicago, Vice-consul Robert Michniewicz
acknowledged, ``With the economic situation in Poland, people are
all wanting to get out and earn easy money.''
   But he added, ``Most of them want to come here just to make some
dollars and then go back.''
   Wages at even menial jobs here far outstrip earnings in Poland,
where monthly salaries average about $15 at the legal black market
exchange rate.
   ``What I make here in a week, it would take me a year to earn in
Poland,'' said Jadwiga, who earns $275 weekly for taking care of an
ailing woman here.
   Even so, the 48-year-old research chemist noted, ``It would
never come into my head to leave Poland forever. Life in Poland is
very hard, but I don't want to be a foreigner all my life.''
   And with dollars or West German marks in hand, a Pole can afford
what many of his or her countrymen can only dream about _ luxuries
such as a telephone, a car, even an apartment.
   For other Poles, working abroad is simply a matter of survival.
   ``I had to come here,'' said Marta, a high school teacher in
Poland who has taken care of an elderly man in a Chicago suburb
since the fall of 1987.
   Marta, 40, entered the United States on a tourist visa, leaving
her 14-year-old daughter at home with the girl's grandparents.
   She said she plans to return with some $15,000, which she says
she will put in an interest-bearing dollar account in a Polish bank
to supplement her salary so she can put food on the table.
   ``I've paid a certain psychological price, but there's a
positive side to it, too,'' Marta said. ``My daughter says she
misses me, but she understands we need the money.''
   For many immigrants the price of American wages can be high.
   ``They do the hardest and dirtiest jobs,'' said Michniewicz, the
vice consul.
   ``People are living six to a basement and working two or three
jobs.''
   Although Leszek, as a miner in Poland, could earn three times
the average salary, that sum is still paltry when compared with the
$5 an hour he can earn doing odd jobs at construction sites in
Chicago.
   In his quest for a better life, Leszek, who is 37 but looks
older, left behind his wife and two daughters.
   He plans on staying in the United States for about 18 months.
Working a year in Germany previously allowed him to pay the $2,300
cost of his trip here and to buy a car.
   In his basement room, Leszek looks out the window at the tires
of passing cars, then shows off pictures of his wife and children
in their Polish home.
   ``Here it's such a wild life _ everybody's running after
money,'' he said. ``At home we have time to go to the sea or to the
mountains. Here they're working from morning to night.''

   On East Berlin's busy Leipziger Strasse is a
poster showing an attractive young woman in a Communist youth
uniform waving joyously in celebration of East Germany's 40th
anniversary.
   But the cheery poster, plastered up at key points throughout the
city, comes nowhere near reflecting the mood of the country as it
observes its founding on Oct. 7, 1949.
   East Germany today is beset by widespread discontent and people
have been fleeing by the tens of thousands, even though its economy
is the envy of the rest of the East bloc.
   ``We need a pluralistic, socialist democracy, and we need it
now,'' said the Rev. Friedrich Schorlemmer, a Lutheran Church
pastor in Wittenberg who calls often for democratic reforms. His
comment is more in line with the mood of a growing number of
today's East Germans.
   Challenged by a determined democracy movement, reeling from the
exodus to the West and facing apparent disunity within its own
ranks, the governing Communist Party will be hard put to give the
world a show of success on its 40th anniversary.
   East Germany's problems have drawn attention to the government's
vulnerability as an opponent of a democracy mood that has swept
across other parts of Eastern Europe.
   Hard-line Communists have firmly rejected the kind of democratic
reforms under way in the Soviet Union, Hungary and Poland.
   ``East Germany does not need reform just for the sake of reform.
We solve our own problems through the achievements of our
workers,'' said Otto Reinhold, head of the state-run Academy for
Social Sciences in East Germany.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union plans to be
in East Berlin for the anniversary celebrations. But even this
gesture of camaraderie could serve to remind the East German
leadership of its troubles.
   Gorbachev is well-liked by many East Germans who see his reforms
at home as a good example to follow and his presence could nudge
East Germany's leader, the 77-year-old Erich Honecker, into seeing
the necessity for democratic reforms.
   Honecker himself has become a source of speculation,
particularly since he underwent a gall bladder operation and took
six weeks to recover. The illness raised the questions of how much
longer he would remain in power and who his successor would be.
   East German activists say they fear violent demonstrations could
erupt across East Germany if the country's aging, hardline
leadership does not give some hope for change to a people growing
increasingly restless.
   The most dramatic manifestation of discontent so far has been
the exodus of more than 20,000 East German refugees to the West
since Sept. 11, when Hungary opened its borders for them, bringing
the total for the year so far to at least 100,000.
   The vast majority said they left in search of democratic
freedoms and better living conditions.
   That, too, is a sentiment among many of the East Germans who
have stayed behind and signed up with new democracy-movement groups.
   The most prominent of these groups, the recently banned Neues
Forum (New Forum), says it signed up more than 4,000 supporters in
about two weeks.
   On Sept. 25, about 8,000 people marched through Leipzig
demanding more democracy and singing ``We Shall Overcome.'' Police
arrested about a dozen of them.
   The wave of democracy sentiment has produced apparent fissures
within the Communist Party itself.
   Hans Modrow, Communist Party chief for Dresden, indicated he
sees a need for change when he said during a recent visit to
Stuttgart in West Germany that the government in East Berlin should
think about the causes of the East German exodus.
   But the country's leaders have given no sign of abandoning their
anti-reforms stance.
   As the 40th anniversary approached, state-run publications ran
articles emphasizing East Germany's ideological links with
Communist allies from Moscow to Beijing as well as its business
ties with the West.
   As for the exodus, the East German leadership has charged that
West Germany lured people away.
   The state-run publications also have been portraying East
Germany as a land of hard workers devoted to communism.
   The Communist Party Ostsee-Zeitung newspaper recently quoted the
supervisor of a collective farm, Manfred Steller, as saying: ``When
I look around, then I start to think how much things have changed
in the past 20 years. Back then we were hauling sacks out of wagons
by hand. But now we have a huge fleet of transport vehicles. There
have been some problems along the way, but we've mastered them
all.''
   Indeed, East Germany has achieved a standard of living that is
the envy of many of its East bloc neighbors. But it remains far
below West Germany, which sends financial aid, and it still has
enormous problems with air and water pollution, struggles with
frequent shortages of fresh fruits and vegetables and faces a
serious lack of building materials and construction labor.
   East Germany was officially founded 40 years ago with Soviet
backing. Like West Germany, it was created from the wartime rubble
of Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany.
   It quickly became a focal point of the Cold War and in 1961 its
leaders built the Berlin Wall, creating one of the world's starkest
_ and deadliest _ symbols of the divisions between East and West.
   The wall still stands starkly 40 years after the birth of East
Germany but maybe less deadly.
   Honecker said earlier this year border guards had been told not
to shoot at escapees anymore _ except in self-defense or to stop
desertions.

<HEAD>Bulgarian Turks Caught Between Assimilation at Home, Hardship in
Turkey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND PRINZ</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of ethnic Turks line up daily
at the Turkish Embassy in Sofia, besieging officials for visas to
enter Turkey. But about 20,000 who got visas in past months have
come back, unable to find good jobs or housing in Turkey.
   The Turks have been fleeing a sometimes-violent campaign by
Bulgarian authorities, going back to 1984, to force them to use
Bulgarian names, curtail their Moslem religious rites and stop
speaking Turkish in public.
   Diplomats in Sofia say many of the Turks who have returned face
prosecution, although they have no details of such cases. They also
say the Turks often are forbidden to return to their previous jobs
and homes, partly due to an acute labor shortage in some areas that
has prompted authorities to shift manual labor to crucial
construction projects and industries.
   The official Bulgarian news agency, BTA, has reported the return
rate at 500 to 1,000 a day.
   A Turkish diplomat in Sofia said, however, that ethnic Turks
``still want to leave Bulgaria as vigorously as before.''
   ``You can see for yourself. There are some 2,000 people waiting
around our consulate every day,'' he said.
   About 320,000 of Bulgaria's 1.5 million ethnic Turks began in
mid-year to leave for Turkey. Bulgaria deported some of them.
Others emigrated under new liberalized passport regulations. Many
had their possessions seized before leaving, and their arrival
strained Turkish abilities to absorb them.
   On Aug. 22, Premier Turgut Ozal of Turkey closed the border to
the ethnic Turks, requiring them to obtain regular visas. His move,
part of an attempt to persuade Bulgaria to safeguard the property
of those seeking to settle in Turkey, was widely seen as a
diplomatic victory for Bulgaria's Communist government over Turkey,
which had asserted at one point that it would welcome any Bulgarian
Turk facing persecution.
   Now that Turkey is no longer absorbing large new groups of
ethnic Turks, the situation of people wanting to emigrate has
become even more precarious. About 25,000 would-be emigrants are
stranded in Bulgaria. Most have sold their houses and other
belongings.
   A Turkish diplomat said his mission now is to issue visas only
for family reunification and other urgent cases.
   ``In all, we are interviewing about 800 people a day,'' he said.
Only a handful, perhaps a dozen or so, receive visas each day.
   ``With the numbers we have given out for visa applicants, we are
already in the mid-1990s,'' he said of a waiting list for
interviews.
   Long lines reportedly also have formed outside the Turkish
consulates in Varna on the Black Sea and the southern industrial
town of Plovdiv.
   Several diplomats in Sofia asserted that 500,000 more ethnic
Turks may want to emigrate to Turkey.
   But Bulgaria continues to balk at a new emigration accord with
Turkey that would set out in detail such things as property rights
and social security claims.
   ``Such a new immigration agreement would limit the free movement
of our people under the Helsinki accords'' on human rights, said
Chavdar Mladenov of the Foreign Ministry. Bulgaria has come under
heavy Western criticism over the issue.
   Officially, Bulgaria has stopped referring to a Turkish minority
in the country. Officials and newspapers now invariably speak of
``Bulgarian Moslems.''
   Maldenov asserted flatly that there are no Turks in Bulgaria.
   Turks indeed have left some of the villages in the Razgrad area,
270 miles northeast of Sofia.
   ``Of 400 families, 300 left'' for Turkey, said one of the
handful of farmers in one village.
   In Mortagonovo, another predominantly Turkish village, a frail
man in his late 70s sat on a bench, his prayer beads gliding
through his fingers.
   He was asked if he planned to leave.
   ``I was waiting in a camp down south for 15 days. Then they
closed the border,'' he said in halting Bulgarian. ``I sold my
house before I left. Now I'm staying with my son.''

<HEAD>Carter's Profile, Image Rising in Role as International Mediator</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   He negotiates on behalf of exiled Miskito
Indians in Nicaragua. He storms out of a tabulation center to
denounce election fraud in Panama.
   He sits down with warring Ethiopian factions in Atlanta to
arrange peace talks. He meets with President Bush in the Oval
Office to report his hopes for a fair Nicaraguan election.
   Eight years after he left the White House in humiliating defeat,
Jimmy Carter, who brought Arab and Jew together in the historic
negotiations at Camp David, is back in business as a mediator.
   Not since Herbert Hoover's globe-girdling activities in famine
relief and his recommendations on streamlining the government has
an ex-president taken so active and visible a role in public
affairs.
   Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, also take tools in hand to work
on projects for Habitat for Humanity, a Georgia-based organization
in which volunteers build homes for the needy from New York's Lower
East Side to Uganda.
   All of this activity comes at a time of renewed interest in
former presidents, with four of them on the scene at once for the
first time since early in the Lincoln administration and a
conference on the subject scheduled for Oct. 18-19 at the Hoover
Library in West Branch, Iowa.
   ``I do think that our ex-presidents are supposed to do more than
play golf,'' Hoover biographer Vaughn Davis Bornet said in an
interview. ``They are supposed to have been so interested in public
affairs at one time that they are not supposed to give up that
interest.''
   Carter has certainly not given it up.
   He has traveled frequently and been host to current and former
world leaders at the Carter Presidential Center, his Atlanta public
policy facility and think tank.
   After nine days of preliminary talks at the center, he announced
last month that the Ethiopian government and Eritrean rebels had
agreed to begin formal negotiations in Nairobi on a settlement of
their 28-year-long conflict. Carter will serve as co-chairman,
playing much the same role he did in the talks between Israel's
Menachem Begin and Egypt's Anwar Sadat in 1978 at Camp David, the
presidential retreat in the Catoctins.
   Also last month, on a trip to Nicaragua as head of a delegation
that will monitor elections there in February, he successfully
negotiated with the leftist Sandinista government for the return of
rebel Miskito Indian leader Brooklyn Rivera after years of exile in
Costa Rica.
   Carter went to Panama in May as an election observer from the
unofficial Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government. At a
tabulation center, he said he found officials tabulating
counterfeit tally sheets, so he stalked out and denounced the
country's election as rigged for the hand-picked candidate of Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Why all this activity?
   ``Carter, I think, is making every effort to erase an impression
that he thinks people have of him,'' said Bornet, a professor
emeritus of history at Southern Oregon College ``And in that he is
absolutely at one with Herbert Hoover. Hoover really worked at
that.''
   Robert Strauss, the former Democratic national chairman who
managed Carter's unsucessful re-election campaign, disagreed about
the former president's motives.
   ``I suspect that Jimmy Carter is oblivious to what people like
me are very sensitive to, and that is the fact that the public is
beginning to re-examine him a bit,'' Strauss said. ``I have a
feeling of great confidence that Jimmy Carter as a person is going
to be viewed better and better. I don't think it's a re-examination
of his presidency. I think it's taking another look at Jimmy
Carter.''
   John Milton Cooper, a professor of history at the University of
Wisconsin who described himself as ``a good Democrat,'' said,
however, ``We remember all those old Hoover Commission reports and
things, but in terms of its translating much to the public, it
didn't do that with Hoover, and I don't think it's doing that much
with Carter either.''
   Whatever the motives, scholars generally gave Carter, 64, better
marks than the other three former presidents _ Richard Nixon and
Gerald Ford, both 76, and and Ronald Reagan, 78.
   ``I am inclined by what I know not to say that Mr. Ford has done
the best he can with what he's got. I don't think he's been a major
figure,'' said Bornet.
   The Hoover scholars also said that Reagan, who has spent much of
his time since Jan. 20 on highly paid speaking tours, ``has made a
few missteps.'' Gould said, ``It's a little hard to see what
Reagan's post-presidency is going to be.''
   Bornet said he thought Nixon, with his articles and books on
foreign policy, ``has done more than could possibly be expected''
after being driven from office by the Watergate scandal.
   However, Donald McCoy, a University of Kansas historian, said
that while people now ``pay attention'' to Nixon, ``I just don't
think people are going to forget and forgive the circumstances of
his departure.''
   Carter and Hoover are the only presidents in this century to be
defeated for re-election. Both were engineers more noted for their
grasp of detail than their power to sway audiences. Both were
vanquished by slick political operators _ Hoover by Franklin D.
Roosevelt and Carter by Ronald Reagan.
   When Hoover left office in 1933, the country was in the grips of
deepening economic depression. Carter relinquished the White House
in 1981 bedeviled by the hostage crisis in Iran, a sagging economy
and people's memories of waiting in long lines for gasoline.
   Roosevelt ignored Hoover, but President Harry Truman named him
chairman of the Famine Emergency Commission after World War II and
he headed commissions on government reorganization under both
Truman and President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   Neither Reagan nor President Bush is known to have called on
Carter for any substantive governmental missions, but Carter has
acted on his own.
   He said in May, ``I think if I had an official role to play, it
might hamper my freedom and limit greatly what influence or access
I do have.''
   ``He has outlived his high negatives,'' Louis Gould, a professor
of history at the University of Texas and student of the
presidency, said in an interview.
   ``It took Herbert Hoover a long time. Carter has been doing it
more quickly,'' said McCoy, who will join Gould and Cooper at the
West Branch conference, co-sponsored by the Hoover and Ford
presidential libraries.
   ``What makes Carter unique is the sense that he has really
improved his national standing with the conduct of his
post-presidency, and that is to some degree I think making
historical perceptions of his presidency a little more favorable,''
said Gould.

   Laurie Anderson became America's best-known
performance artist in the early 1980s. And, unlike some avant-garde
artists, with whom the mainstream catches up, she's still
avant-garde.
   She opens the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival on
Tuesday with a piece called ``Empty Places,'' which she premiered
this year at the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C.
   ``Empty Places'' has Anderson on stage singing without a band.
Screens on two 20-foot towers show computer-controlled slides and
film. Images range from grim homelessness to bluebirds of happiness.
   ``I love the way pictures and music can be made to work
together,'' Anderson said.
   ``It's never one of my goals to be a cutting-edge artist. I
think of myself working in the world's oldest art form _
storytelling. There's nothing new about that. The trick is, how do
you tell a good story?
   ``I suppose my goal in `Empty Places' is to describe how much
the world seems to me to have changed in the last few years. It
tries to describe suffering and people's ideas of utopia,'' she
said.
   ``This is going to look very different than things I've done
before. I have absolutely no interest in whether they're
avant-garde or not. Of course artists don't want to bore people and
it's important to invent things. I love things that are surprising
and shocking; I actually consider it a kind of responsibility to do
things not in a usual way.''
   A new Laurie Anderson record, ``Strange Angels,'' which she
worked on for two years, will be released by Warner Bros. on Oct.
24. Seven of its songs are in ``Empty Places.'' Anderson will tour
the show, starting in December in Canada, returning to the United
States in February.
   She has changed the show since Spoleto.
   ``There were a few `head-scratchers' in there,'' she said. ``I
love things that are puzzling in good ways. I had to take out a
couple that were just plain puzzling. I kind of ripped the whole
show apart.''
   Then she got sick and spent time visiting doctors. ``I went to
Rio to do a concert; there were eight people in my group. From
eating fish, quite a few of us got one of these strange new poison
ocean diseases that nobody knows very much about and can't fix very
easily. I got the version of being completely dizzy. We're all a
lot better than we were.
   ``I'm putting the show back together. It is becoming a lot more
political than it was before. The more I look around and also try
to understand what this particular piece is about, the angrier I
get, mostly with things that not too many people seem to be really
talking about.
   ``Everybody in New York knows what it's like to walk out and see
six people lying in their little sidewalk dormitory. It was just so
odd that nobody talked about that in a coherent way in the last
elections. You look around at the eight years that Reagan created
and it is so horrifying to see the results of this rampant `gimme,
gimme' economy,'' she said.
   ``I'm really trying to look at that from a few different angles.
I'm in the midst of redefining the introduction. It is places that
I've shot pictures of, mostly in downtown New York. They're not
exactly ruins but they look like it.
   ``That has been one of the nicest things about working on this
piece,'' Anderson said. ``I go out at night a lot, real late, and
shoot a lot of places. I've shot thousands of things for this
piece, slides, moving images and films that were sent through a
visual digital computer and look very grainy. It's a beautiful look.
   ``Stories work so much better at night and these aren't exactly
bedtime stories. I find some of them kind of horrifying. People
have drifted into the shots. It's a whole different world from
midnight on out there. It's making me feel at home in New York in a
way I never have before.''
   The show also has some cheery animation. ``I was trying to make
a real cartoon with all these screens. I thought, `I need some
Disney-type bluebirds.' Bluebirds make me happy. I drew them on the
computer, with picket fences and roses. There are songs about
Utopia.''
   Are they ironic?
   ``Some of them are; some aren't,'' she replied. ``Irony is a
really tricky thing. I try to use irony sparingly. I'm doing a lot
more singing in this show. I find I can say ironic things but I
can't sing ironic things.
   ``The other big difference in this show is that I've been taking
singing lessons three years. This is the first performance where
I'm trying to use that. To my shock I discovered I was a soprano. I
thought I'd be a low alto. When you sing high, it's a very
vulnerable feeling and you really have to believe what you're
singing. That's not to say some of these songs aren't silly and
preposterous.
   ``There are fewer computerized filters changing my voice. I'm
trying very hard to be truthful. Sometimes that's not very clever
and I don't mind that it's not. These things don't have triple and
quadruple meanings. They have one meaning.''
   Anderson performed her six-hour ``United States Parts I _ IV''
at the 1983 Next Wave Festival. Her last big performing tour was in
1986.

<HEAD>Sarah Brightman and ``The Songs That Got Away''</HEAD>

   Some good theater songs just disappear. They
vanish because they are in flop musicals or are overshadowed in hit
shows by more persistent melodies.
   Now there's an attempt to resurrect a dozen or so mostly
forgotten treasures in a new PolyGram release by Sarah Brightman
called ``The Songs That Got Away,'' produced by her husband, Andrew
Lloyd Webber.
   It was one of Lloyd Webber's own unknown efforts, ``Half a
Moment,'' that led to the recording, says Brightman. The song,
which has lyrics by British playwright Alan Ayckbourn, is from
``Jeeves,'' a rare Lloyd Webber failure that ran for only 48
performances in London's West End in 1975.
   Brightman, who starred in the London and New York productions of
``The Phantom of the Opera,'' sang the song as an encore during a
concert she gave in England in 1987.
   ``The audience went mad about it, and then it happened twice
again during two more concerts,'' she recalled during an interview.
``I thought `There must be a lot of lost songs like this one.'''
   So did Lloyd Webber and Thomas Z. Shepard, a veteran New York
record producer who has made many of the best original cast albums,
from ``Company'' to ``La Cage aux folles.'' To find the songs, the
two men culled their extensive record collections of theater music
and started sorting out songs with Brightman.
   ``We kept writing down different lists and from there narrowed
it down to about 100 songs and finally to 14,'' she said.
   The recording was made after Brightman completed her run on
Broadway in ``Phantom,'' an engagement she got through with grace
and good humor after Actors' Equity made noises about not letting
her appear in her husband's show because they thought the role
should go to an American.
   ``I didn't feel part of it in a funny sort of way,'' she said.
``I just got on with my role as well as I could. After all, I'm a
working artist and the public came and paid their money to see me
do my thing.''
   The final selections for the recording include little-known
works of such well-known composers as Richard Rodgers, Leonard
Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim and Marvin Hamlisch.
   Bernstein's calyso-tinged ``Lud's Wedding'' from ``1600
Pennsylvania Avenue,'' a seven-performance flop about the occupants
of the White House, suggests the show's failure was due to its
lugubrious book rather than Berstein's eclectic music that had
lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner.
   Rodgers is represented by two works, ``I Am Going to Like It
Here,'' an affecting lesson in confidence-building from ``Flower
Drum Song,'' and ``Away From You,'' a soaring love song with lyrics
by Sheldon Harnick from their 1976 collaboration about Henry VIII
called ``Rex.''
   When Brightman recorded ``Mister Monotony,'' it was a cult
Irving Berlin song cut first from his ``Miss Liberty'' and then
from ``Call Me Madam.'' Since then, it has found a home _ and a
wide audience _ in ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway.''
   The most unusual selection is Frank Loesser's ``Three Cornered
Tune,'' which was an early version of his famous ``Fugue for
Tinhorns'' from ``Guys and Dolls.''
   Now, instead of extolling the joys of betting on the horses,
Brightman, in three-voice harmony, trills a sweet number about ``a
tender sound, this little tune I found.''
   Most of the recording was done in London and Vienna with several
different orchestrators, although ``Dreamers,'' a song from Marvin
Hamlisch's short-lived musical ``Jean Seberg,'' was done in New
York.
   ``Marvin wanted to use his own musicians and to conduct it
himself. He did it beautifully, giving the song sort of a baroque
quality,'' Brightman said.
   Much of her fall will be occupied with ``The Music of Andrew
Lloyd Webber,'' a concert tour featuring her husband's music done
by soloists and a symphony orchestra. Brightman won't appear in all
the cities on the tour but will sing in some of the major stops
like Los Angeles.
   She also is working on a television project _ tentative title:
``Shooting Star'' _ about the life of Jessie Matthews, the British
musical comedy star known in the United States primarily for her
recording of a Rodgers and Hart classic, ``Dancing on the Ceiling.''
   ``She was a wonderful performer,'' Brightman said. ``She nearly
got the first Ginger Rogers role with Fred Astaire but lost it
because she was contracted to do a musical on Broadway and they
wouldn't let her out of it.
   ``Her whole life was like that. For America, there always was
something that nearly came up and was taken away from her. So she
was only a very big star in Britain and Australia. Now I have a
chance to make her better known.''

   At last count a woman had 187 belts crammed into
closets and stuffed into drawers, most of them never worn and
hardly even looked at.
   A man thinks only the most expensive exercise bicycle will help
enhance his physique, never mind that he already owns a battery of
body-building equipment that he doesn't use.
   Such people are compulsive spending addicts, and therapists at a
New York psychiatric treatment center take the affliction as
seriously as the problems of alcoholics and drug abusers.
   ``They think that owning things makes them feel better,'' says
Dr. Francesca Kress, director of psychological assessment at the
Hapworth Centers, located an easy browsing distance from the city's
Fifth Avenue shopping mecca.
   ``As their lives become more and more of a disaster, they will
treat themselves to something they can't afford,'' says Kress,
adding that maybe at the back of a buying fanatic's mind is the
thought ``Mommy and Daddy gave me presents and it made me feel
better.''
   Not everyone who occasionally splurges suffers from the
addiction, but people who use shopping to salve troubled minds
might need help.
   ``When material objects are used as a way to assuage feelings of
discomfort, there's a problem,'' according to Kress, who treats
addicts at Hapworth's compulsive spending addiction program.
   From bargain hunters who scour discount outlets to well-heeled
patrons of chic boutiques who think it is beneath them to buy
anything on sale, compulsive spending addiction takes many forms.
   A person might develop the syndrome for any number of reasons.
   There is the case of a patient who, as a child, was given gifts
when being told of divorce plans. The parents planted the mistaken
notion that presents make difficulties go away or at least make
distress easier to bear, which might have caused abnormal spending
desires when the child grew up, Kress suggests.
   ``Rather than deal with a problem they think that they can go
out and buy something to make themselves feel better,'' she says.
   The phenomenon of people living beyond their means or being
obsessed with possessions probably has been around as long as
people have. Cultures that revere wealth have turned the
acquisition habit into an accepted measure of self-worth and
personal success.
   In modern times, explosive growth in credit card ownership has
made it easier for people to indulge their spending passions.
   The powerful pull of plastic has cast credit-card-carrying
consumers adrift in a sea of debt. Groups like New York-based
Budget &amp; Credit Counseling Services Inc. have sprung up to help
consumers get their heads back above water and keep them there.
   The New York budget-counseling office is one of more than 400
offices nationwide affiliated with the non-profit Maryland-based
National Foundation for Consumer Credit.
   The need for such services probably has intensified in recent
years, due to the legacy of the self-indulgent 1970s Me Decade. In
the 1980s, a period of prolonged economic growth has put money into
people's pockets while the you-can-have-it-all yuppie attitude has
meant money did not burn many holes there.
   ``In our societies w're terribly materialistic _ especially in
America,'' Kress says. ``We believe there's a God-given right to
acquire, to be capitalistic. It's almost a holy thing.''
   Hapworth's compulsive spending treatment program is one of
several that the medical and psychiatric facility provides. It also
runs specialized programs for people addicted to alcohol, drugs and
tobacco and people with eating disorders. In addition to addicts,
it treats patients seeking help with sexual dysfunctions, stress,
depression and other problems.
   A 90-minute behavior evaluation costs $150 and Hapworth charges
$90 for a private behavior therapy session and $50 for group
therapy. The center says most insurance companies cover its
compulsive spending addiction program.
   Besides helping patients stick to a budget and break the
credit-card habit, Hapworth seeks to get to the root of their
problems. Sometimes the sense of loss associated with giving up
another habit, such as smoking, drinking or drug use, leads
troubled people to seek solace in shopping.
   In simple terms, a woman fixated on belts might be
subconsciously seeking to restrain herself. A man who cannot do
without the latest high-tech sports gadgetry might be trying to buy
youth or a good body in compensation for some perceived failing.
   Typically, compulsive spending addicts plan sprees with great
longing and go into almost hypnotic trances or feel out of control
while shopping, Kress says.
   To control spending while being treated for the addiction,
Hapworth has numerous do's and don't's for patients such as:
   _Never shop alone.
   _Never use credit cards.
   _Always use cash if possible.
   _Stick to shopping lists.
   _Don't keep purchases a secret.
   _Return or give to charity any duplicate items you own.
   The addiction affects rich and poor, but wealthy people do not
wind up in financial difficulty unless they really go overboard.
   Both women and men suffer from uncontrollable spending urges
contrary to the TV sitcom stereotype of the dizzy female going
ga-ga over sales.
   ``We're trying to point out that this is not something
frivolous. It's a serious problem that no one takes seriously,''
Kress says.
   But not everyone should automatically feel guilty about shopping.
   ``I'm not anti-materialism; it's fine to like beautiful
things,'' Kress says. ``When you use it to avoid your feelings
that's when it becomes a problem.''

   School reform, the subject of President Bush's
just competed summit with the governors, is following a unique
pattern in America's third largest school system. As one Chicago
educator put it, ``The nation has never had a plan like this.''
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parents will wield unprecedented power to shape
public education in Chicago following elections this month that
culminate sweeping reforms in the school system often labeled the
nation's worst.
   On Oct. 11-12, voters will elect members to 540 local councils,
which will oversee the city's 603 schools.
   The councils _ each composed of six parents and five other
members, including teachers, principals and local residents without
schoolchildren _ will have authority to hire and fire principals,
develop school improvement plans and spend money.
   ``It's the worst system in the country. Parents can't do any
worse than the current system,'' said Norman Hodgson, a father of
two and candidate for a council that will serve his kindergarten
daughter's Northwest Side elementary school.
   The councils are a key element of a new reform package aimed at
decentralizing the Board of Education's powers and eliminating
deep-seated problems that have given Chicago's public schools a
reputation as the nation's worst.
   And nearly everyone who has a stake in the city _ from Hispanic
lawmakers and black community activists to white corporate
executives _ is participating in a mobilization effort to get
parents and others involved.
   Critics say the decentralization goes too far, putting too much
power in the hands of those unequipped to deal with it. They say
schools can't be expected to cure ills that stem from broken
families.
   But reformers argue that by getting parents involved, the plan
will help break a vicious cycle of problems that may begin in
poverty-stricken homes, but has spilled over into schools and
created generations of apathetic educators too willing to accept
the status quo.
   ``One of the changes we hope will happen is teachers and
principals will stop blaming the families and start thinking about
what they can do to make a difference,'' said Donald Moore,
executive director of Designs for Change, an education research and
advisory council that helped shape the reform package.
   ``Who knows more about educating their children than parents,
along with educators? We've got to work together,'' Hodgson said.
   That is the battle cry of the numerous corporations, community
and civic organizations all trying to make sure the reform plan _
passed last year by the state legislature _ gets off on the right
foot.
   Grass-roots organizing efforts by groups like Designs for Change
have sent volunteers into the city's housing projects, going
door-to-door to recruit candidates for the two-year council
positions. School officials sought 10,000 candidates, but passed
the mark by Thursday with nearly 14,650, although some
neighborhoods still lack full slates.
   Corporations have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars and
clergymen have devoted sermons to urging their congregations to get
involved and vote for the sake of the schools' 410,000 children.
   ``Everyone's talking about it,'' said Lucy Moore, a 58-year-old
grandmother running in an poor black neighborhood on the South Side.
   ``So far everyone that I talk to in the neighborhood says they
are interested,'' she said. ``They say they will vote. They say our
children are at stake. They are our future.''
   Each council will include six parents, two teachers and two
community residents without schoolchildren. School staffs will
elect the teacher members. The 11th member of each council will be
the principal of the school the council oversees. (In some cases,
councils will oversee more than one school.)
   Council powers will include signing principals to four-year
performance contracts and deciding whether to renew what
essentially were lifetime jobs before reform.
   Principals will have authority to hire teachers and dismiss them
after 45 days probation, regardless of seniority. Before, teachers
deemed unsatisfactory had a year to improve. Politics and seniority
often made principals hire teachers they didnt' want.
   ``Before, the central board had to approve every little thing
that the school did. Now their role is much more to be a monitor to
enforce minimum standards,'' said Donald Moore of Designs for
Change.
   The Chicago Teachers Union, which represents 28,000 district
employees, including nearly 21,800 teachers, did not return
telephone calls seeking comment.
   Reform also means shifting more money to schools that serve the
most low-income students and eliminating supefluous administrative
jobs; 500 already have been cut. For example, the school system
trimmed some positions when it stopped testing teacher applicants
to prove their state certification.
   Chicago's school budget this year is $2.26 billion, up about
$200 million over last year. While reform does not call for more
state money, it involves shifting budget money to give a larger
share to educating low income students, Moore said.
   And $40 million that resulted from eliminating board jobs is
being pumped into the reform effort, he added.
   ``What this law does it to put a mechanism in place so that
principals and teachers will be held accountable for their schools
by the people who have the most at stake ... that is primarily by
parents,'' Moore said.
   Chicago's woes gained nationwide scrutiny in 1987, when William
Bennett, then President Reagan's education secretary, labeled the
city's schools the worst in the nation. The reform effort has put
the system in the national spotlight again.
   Chicago's school reform is ``the most fundamental reorganization
of a big city school system since the early part of the 20th
century,'' said David Cohen, professor of education and social
policy at Michigan State University.
   ``I think a lot of people thought the Chicago system was about
as poor as any system in the country,'' said Norm Fruchter, senior
consultant for the Academy of Educational Development, a New
York-based group that analyzes urban school systems.
   Fruchter cited such problems as a double-digit dropout rate a
low-income student population approaching 70 percent.
   No other system with local school councils puts the kind of
control in parents' hands that the Chicago reforms do, Fruchter
said.
   Most observers agree that despite the snags, the reform plan is
a unique effort to restore quality, values and promise to the
city's schools.
   ``Chicago has never had a plan like this. The nation has never
had a plan like this,'' said Sylvia Peters, principal of a South
Side elementary school.
   ``If we begin to visualize success,'' she said, ``and go about
actually putting success in place, we'll succeed.''

<HEAD>Cow's Blood May Become Substitute for Transfusions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sometime in the next decade, nurses preparing
patients for routine surgery may draw out a few pints of blood and
replace it with something the laws of nature would seem to forbid:
cow's blood.
   Cow's blood _ actually just the oxygen-carrying part of it _ is
one of several substances under development by biotechnology firms
seeking a safe, clean and maybe even superior substitute for what
flows through human veins.
   Doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital hope to begin
experiments this fall on healthy human volunteers to see if bovine
blood transfusions are safe. Extensive human testing will be
necessary to overcome skepticism about mixing blood between the
species.
   ``Everybody says you can't give cow's blood to a human, just
like you can't give some people's blood to other people,'' said
Carl Rausch, head of Biopure, a Boston-based company working on
this approach. ``But we are talking about just the oxygen transport
medium, which is hemoglobin.''
   Ordinarily, blood, organs and hormones cannot be swapped between
cats and mice or people and elephants because they are rejected as
foreign substances. But there are exceptions. For instance,
diabetics take cow insulin, and pig valves are used as replacements
in human hearts.
   Biopure has more than people in mind for its product. Tufts
University's veterinary school plans to test the same cow blood
intended for humans to treat sick dogs. Besides opening up a big
market among veterinarians _ it envisions a $60 million a year
business in transfusions for dogs and cats alone _ Biopure hopes
that by showing Bossie's blood works fine for Tabby and Rover,
people will begin to accept the idea that it's good for Aunt
Gertrude, as well.
   ``People are nervous about this because it's bovine-derived,''
said Rausch. ``If you can get a substitute to work in a wide range
of species, then the nay-sayers will have to say, `It might work.'
''
   It should work, he and others believe, because many creatures,
people included, produce similar hemoglobin. In three years of
tests, animals showed no adverse reaction to cow hemoglobin, even
when it replaced 95 percent of their own blood.
   Blood fulfills many vital jobs, transporting nourishment,
hormones and disease-fighting armaments. The substitutes envisioned
by Biopure and others would take the place of just one of these
components _ the red cells.
   Red cells are packed with hemoglobin, a molecule that picks up
oxygen in the lungs and delivers it throughout the body. Putting
back hemoglobin, usually in the form of red cell transfusions, is
often essential for offsetting the blood loss of accident victims
and surgical patients.
   ``There have been attempts to make red cell substitutes for a
quarter of a century,'' said Dr. Harvey G. Klein, chief of
transfusion medicine at the National Institutes of Health in
Bethesda, Md.
   Northfield Labs in Northfield, Ill., and Baxter Travenol in
Fairfield, N.J., among others, are developing red cell substitutes
from expired human blood. Green Cross in Japan has made a
fluorocarbon-based synthetic molecule that can carry oxygen, while
Somatagen in Broomfield, Colo., is attempting to make human
hemoglobin through gene splicing.
   ``The great enthusiasm recently is because of the perceived
increased risk of infection being transmitted by transfusions,
primarily AIDS,'' Klein said. ``Red cell substitutes could be
purified to such an extent that viral contamination wouldn't be an
issue. Red cells can't be right now.''
   Despite screening, a tiny risk remains of getting AIDS from a
transfusion. Other viruses can also be passed along _ including
hepatitis and herpes _ as well as a variety of foreign proteins.
   ``Every time you take blood, it's like putting a quarter in the
slot machine,'' said Dr. Charles Huggins, head of Massachusetts
General's blood bank. ``If you are unlucky and come up with three
lemons, you can get hepatitis or something else.''
   Rausch said bovine hemoglobin is purified to be 99.999999999
percent free of viruses. Even if a microbe slips through, it will
be a cow germ, unlikely to cause a human disease.
   Among other advantages, the substitutes could be given to anyone
without matching the blood type. And unlike real blood, which must
be thrown away after about three weeks, the fake varieties would
last six months and perhaps longer.
   Huggins, who will be participating in the human testing of cow
blood, said, ``I am making every effort to put myself out of
business.''
   However, Dr. Leon Hoyer, vice president of research and
development at the American Red Cross, doubts this will happen.
Blood is becoming safer as tests are developed for more viruses, he
said, and doubts will linger about the safety of routinely using
bovine blood and other substitutes.
   ``It's going to take a significant number of clinical trials to
show that they have no toxicity at all. It's one thing to use them
when you have no alternative. It's another to use them electively.
I'm not sure that they will have an advantage over standard blood
that is subject to better testing and viral inactivation procedures
that will get rid of those issues.''
   Even if the substitutes don't replace real red cells, experts
say there are several situations where they might be routinely used:
   _Before such operations as hip replacements, which involve the
loss of large quantities of blood, patients might put several pints
of their own blood in storage and replace it with a hemoglobin
substitute. After the operation, their own blood would be put back.
   _Ambulances might carry blood substitutes so transfusions could
begin immediately for accident victims rather than after they
arrive at the hospital where their blood type can be matched.
   _The military would like to develop a freeze-dried blood
substitute that could be mixed with sterile water on the
battlefield so combat victims could be stabilized until they are
evacuated to hospitals.
   _They could be used to treat victims of heart attacks and
strokes. Because the substitutes are thinner than blood, they might
ooze around clots and carry oxygen to starving tissue, preventing
permanent damage until clots dissolve.
   _They could be used to keep organs alive until they are
transplanted.
   _By boosting oxygen levels, they might improve the killing power
of radiation therapy in treating cancer.
   _Since hemoglobin is a rich source of iron, it might increase
the body's natural production of new red cells, especially when
combined with a growth-stimulating hormone.
   One clear advantage of cow blood is the supply of raw material.
Rausch estimates 70 million cows are slaughtered in the United
States each year, and each contains five to seven gallons of blood.
Most of it goes to waste.
   While plasma is salvaged for fish food, the red cells are a
goopy mass that must be dried and taken to a landfill. Rausch said
he can buy it for 50 cents a gallon. By 1994 _ when, if all goes
well, his product is approved for routine human use _ Rausch
expects to be able to sell the highly purified substitute for $150
to $200 a pint, the price he believes real blood will cost then.

<HEAD>Did Goats Eat Early Man Out of House and Home?</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EIN GHAZAL, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mysterious, seemingly peaceful force
drove people from villages like this throughout the region nearly
8,000 years ago, foiling one of mankind's first drives toward
civilization.
   In chips of charcoal, slivers of plaster and trash heaps of
bones, archaelogists say they have found a major suspect _ the
domesticated goat.
   ``Goats are referred to as the black plague of the desert,''
said Gary Rollefson of San Diego State University. Archaeologists
suggest that voracious, newly domesticated animals destroyed the
soil and ate the fuel around some of humanity's earliest
settlements, helping to push people into becoming nomads.
   The villages here rose about the same time as those in ancient
Mesopotamia, what is now Iraq, which later evolved into
civilization.
   ``Mesopotamia never had this abandoned period,'' Rollefson said.
``One of the reasons was they didn't have goats.''
   He has spent six digging seasons at Ein Ghazal on the edge of
Amman, together with co-directors Zaidan Kafafi from the University
of Jordan and Alan Simmons of the University of Nevada's Desert
Research Institute in Reno.
   Their work, completed this summer, uncovered one of the Middle
East's more important archaeological sites, a village roughly three
to four times the size of ancient Jericho, that traded with other
peoples hundreds of miles away.
   ``It was one of the largest population centers of its time,''
Rollefson said, estimating that at its peak, as many as 3,000
people might have been crowded into its 35 acres.
   Jericho, about 30 miles to the west, and other early settlements
in the region were abandoned about 6,500 B.C., Rollefson said. But
Ein Ghazal hung on for another 1,500 years near the edge of the
great Arabian deserts.
   Ein Ghazal's survival, despite a drier location, argues against
the more common theory that villagers abandoned the early
settlements when the climate warmed, making farming and food
gathering too difficult, he said.
   But goats were first domesticated about 7,000 B.C. and rapidly
became a major source of food in the region.
   Villages like Ein Ghazal depended on a good source of water and
on nearby trees for fuel to produce plaster or cook food and for
pillars in their homes, as well as to protect against soil erosion.
``Trees are a renewable resource. But goats eat anything that grows
and trees don't move very fast ... So you don't get any regrowth of
the forest,'' Rollefson said.
   ``The soil was completely eroded, washed away,'' when the
village was abandoned about 5,000 B.C., he added.
   The excavations showed progressive evidence of environmental
deterioration as the village matured: chunks of charcoal became
smaller, roof beams thinner, animal bones less varied. ``That's an
indication they'd been destroying the habitat for all these wild
animals,'' Rollefson said.
   Ein Ghazal was discovered in the early 1980s when road builders
bulldozed through the site. The most spectacular discovery came
during the first digging season in 1983, when archaeologists
unearthed 25 clay human figures dated to the 68th century B.C.
which may have been used in a cult of ancestor worship.
   When the first was found, Rollefson said, ``the hair on the back
of my neck literally stood up. I was looking at a face looking back
up at me undisturbed for about 9,000 years.''

<HEAD>Greyhound Research Lab Seeks To Get Injured Dogs Back On Track</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON WORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quarter-mile oval track nestled among
the towering oaks will let researchers study the stresses of racing
and the peak performance of a breed of highly trained athletes _
racing greyhounds.
   The $300,000, year-old track is ``the only one of its kind at an
academic institution built purely for research,'' said Dr. Mark
Bloomberg, director of the University of Florida's Center for
Veterinary Sports Medicine.
   The track, financed by the Florida Division of the American
Greyhound Track Operators, also lets veterinarians treat dogs that
are injured or have problems racing, he said. ``The idea is to get
them back winning. Some of these dogs are very valuable. It will be
an environment for diagnosis and prognosis.''
   Projects by students and 20 faculty members include research
into the incidence and characteristics of injuries, hypothyroidism,
changes in fluid in the joints, and exercise-induced bleeding. The
injury study involves a survey of racing greyhound injuries that
occur in training and on commercial tracks.
   With the dogs hitting 40 mph in sprints, leg injuries are
common, Bloomberg said, and the track will be used ``to evaluate
dogs with orthopedic injuries. We want to really get into is the
bio-mechanics of the race track itself.''
   Composition of the track surface, banking and other factors will
be examined, he said. ``We want to provide a safe running surface
that decreases the rate of injuries and prolong racing careers,''
he said.
   Most tracks use a mixture of sand and clay, though others have
been tried.
   Researchers also are examining greyhound reproduction. Racing
females are are given male hormones to disturb their fertility
cycle. When their careers end, it can take 18 months or more before
they return to full fertility.
   Another study examines whether racing dogs have the same
problems as race horses that bleed into their lungs, and whether
this affects performance.
   The spread of infectious disease through a kennel is another
concern of the industry, Bloomberg said.
   Greyhound pups begin training when they are 16 months to 2 years
old and most run until they are about 5. Some kennels, with
excellent breeding stock, may race 90 percent of their dogs, while
others have only 25 percent to 50 percent of their dogs heading for
the track.
   Greyhounds run instinctively, he said, and the training ``is
designed to teach them to chase the lure.'' The training also gets
the dog into shape and ``good training even helps the average dog.''
   Racing dogs are, in many ways, like human athletes, he said, and
some will perform when injured, while others won't. ``The ones with
the most heart may beat the best athletes.''
   Bloomberg hopes the track will draw more researchers as more
states legalize racing. Texas and Kansas are each building three
tracks and Wisconsin is building five. Greyhound racing also is
popular in England, Ireland, France, Spain, Mexico, Australia and
the Scandinavian countries.
   In addition to the track operators, money comes from the
greyhound industry, private companies financing research and the
university's Division of Sponsored Research. Since its founding in
the 1940s, the greyhound industry in Florida has blossomed into the
largest in the country.
   In fiscal 1987, ``racing at Florida's 18 tracks raised $80
million in tax revenues for the state, compared to about $29
million for jai-alai, $12 million for thoroughbred horse racing and
$1.5 million for harness racing,'' said George Johnson, executive
director of the Florida group.

<HEAD>Women, Whites at Greater Risk of Thyroid Disease</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women and whites are at greater risk of
thyroid disease than other groups, according to a study that found
nearly 9 percent of people over 55 suffer from some thyroid gland
dysfunction.
   In the Wayne State University study of 488 whites and 480
blacks, 8.9 percent suffered some thyroid dysfunction, said Dr.
Nanda Bagchi, a professor of medicine at the school. Two percent of
the total suffered hyperthoidism, or excessive thyroid function,
and 6.9 percent had hypothyroidism, too little.
   The thyroid, located in front and to each side of the trachea,
secretes thyroxine to regulate growth and metabolism.
Hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss, nervousness, rapid pulse and
muscle weakness. Hypothyroidism can cause sluggishness, puffiness,
constipation, depression, weight gain and hair loss.
   About half the cases of hypothyroidism were caused by underlying
autoimmune thyroid disease, a condition that causes the body to
react to the thyroid and diminishes its function, Bagchi said.
Two-thirds of the hyperthyroidism cases were attributable to too
much thyroid hormone prescribed by doctors, he said.
   Treatment of hyperthyroidism is particularly important among
older people because it can aggravate heart disease, he said.
Thyroid disease strikeds about 15 percent of people aged 75 and
over, about twice as often as those 55-64.
   The study, reported last month at a meeting of the American
Thyroid Association, also found that 12.7 percent of whites had
dysfunction, compared with 6.9 percent of blacks; and 11.2 percent
of women vs. 6.2 percent of men.

<HEAD>Study Finds Drug-Exposed Children Face Learning Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toddlers exposed to cocaine in the womb are
shorter, have smaller heads and are more likely to have learning
handicaps than children who have not been exposed, according to a
study on drugs and pregancy.
   ``We foresee that many of these children will end up in special
education, or classes for the learning disabled,'' said Dr. Ira
Chasnoff, the director of the Chicago-based study of 277 children,
including 228 exposed to drugs. Two-thirds of the mothers used
other drugs in addition to cocaine, he said.
   The problems include a lack of concentration and inability to
accomplish tasks easily performed by other children, concluded the
study released to the National Association for Perinatal Addiction
Research and Education.
   The association estimates that 375,000 babies are born each year
in the United States to mothers who used drugs during their
pregnancy.
   A Boston University study earlier this year found similar
results on stature and head size. Chasnoff said, `This has a lot of
implications for long-term development'' since head circumference
is an indication of brain growth.
   ``These children, on the whole, are not mentally retarded.
Overall, these babies cognitively and functioning normally,'' he
said. The tendency to become distracted and troubled by
unstructured tasks holds back the exposed children.
   On tests calling for blocks to be put in appropriate-shaped
holes, drug-exposed children were more likely to become confused
and overwhelmed.
   ``What I hear teachers telling me are the same things I'm
telling you right here,'' Chasnoff said at an association
conference last month. ``The teachers are calling this to the
attention of the school systems, but the school systems are not
ready to deal with it.''

<HEAD>Accord on Loan to Argentina</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentina has reached agreement with the
International Monetary Fund for a $1.4 billion loan to help the
government cope with the country's financial troubles, President
Carlos Menem and the IMF said.
   Argentina owes nearly $4.5 billion in unpaid interest on $60
billion worth of foreign debt. It has been paying little for the
last year and a half. The country is the Third World's third
largest debtor, after Brazil and Mexico.
   Menem, speaking Wednesday at the National Press Club, did not
divulge details of the agreement reached during the annual meeting
of the IMF and its sister group, the World Bank.
   He said Argentina wants to honor its debt commitments but added
that the country's creditors should take into account Argentina's
needs, including its struggle to achieve economic growth.
   Argentina, he said, is facing ``the most dangerous economic
crisis in our history'' because of recession, hyperinflation,
disinvestment and debt.
   Menem's predecessor, Raul Alfonsin, was unable to make the
promises that the fund requires in return for help _ cuts in
government spending and other austerity measures that could have
led to serious disturbances.
   Last February in Venezuela an estimated 300 people were killed
in rioting when a new government took measures in agreement with
the fund that raised prices for gasoline, bus fares and other vital
products.
   It takes several weeks or months before money from an IMF loan
is actually disbursed. It was widely expected that soon after an
agreement was reached between the fund and Argentina, a bridge loan
from the United States and other countries would be granted to help
tide Argentina over.
   Argentine negotiators met Wednesday with Richard Erb, the fund's
deputy managing director, and representatives of leading countries
among the 152 in the fund. The United States is the largest
contributor.
   Last October, Argentina got $1.25 billion in loans from the
World Bank. The bank suspended much of its disbursement when
Argentina failed to meet its conditions.
   Officials estimated that Argentina only received about $300
million of the money.

   Pepsico Inc.'s foreign beverage operations are
being realigned into six new units carved out along geographic
lines in an attempt to expand Pepsi's international soft drink
business, the company said.
   Roger Enrico, president and chief executive of the company's
Pepsico Worldwide Beverages division, on Wednesday named presidents
of each of the six units, which he said would be self-sufficient
with broad local authority in areas such as marketing, sales and
technical operations.
   Christopher A. Sinclair, a veteran Pepsico executive who most
recently had headed the central division of Pepsi-Cola USA with
responsibility for 11 Midwest states, was named president of
Pepsi-Cola International.
   Previously, the foreign operations were divided into 15 regions
that reported to four middle-managers based in Somers, N.Y. Under
the new foreign alignment, the regional presidents report directly
to Sinclair in Somers.
   Enrico had headed Pepsi-Cola International as well as handling
his worldwide posts since February, when Robert Beeby left to head
Pepsico's Frito-Lay Inc. snack food subsidiary.
   Beverage industry analysts said the realignment reflects the
importance Pepsi is placing on the international beverage
marketplace where it long has trailed Coca-Cola Co. by a wide
margin.
   Many industry observers say soft drink makers view the
international market as offering the most promising opportunity for
growth.
   Industry analysts said Pepsi derives slightly less than 50
percent of its soft-drink volume from international sales, or about
2 billion of its 4.2 billion cases sold worldwide annually. But
international sales account for only about 20 percent of the
company's $5 billion in worldwide revenue.
   Jesse Meyers, publisher of the industry journal Beverage Digest,
said foreign markets are appealing to soft drink makers because
average per capita consumption of soft drinks is only a fraction of
what it is in the United States, affording greater growth
opportunities.
   Pepsi-Cola International said the realignment will place some of
its ``most seasoned international executives on the front lines of
the international soft drink market.''
   The six foreign regions, the presidents and base of operations
are: Western Europe, Frederick Meils, London; Latin America, Luis
Suarez, Rio de Janeiro; Middle East-Africa, David Jones, Nicosia,
Cyprus; Asia Pacific, Richard Blossom, Singapore; China-India-West
Asia-Eastern Europe, Les Ham, Hong Kong; and Canada, Wayne
Mailloux, Toronto.

Stanley C. Pace as chairman and chief executive of the defense
contractor.
   Anders is senior executive vice president of operations and a
director of Textron, which has interests in aerospace technology,
commercial products, including automotive components, and financial
services.
   He will join General Dynamics on Jan. 1 as vice chairman and
will become chairman and chief executive when Pace retires Jan. 1,
1991, the St. Louis-based company said Wednesday.
   Pace has been chief executive since 1986.
   Anders, 55, is a former executive secretary of the National
Aeronautics and Space Council, commissioner of the Atomic Energy
Commission and chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Prior
to joining Textron in 1984, he was with General Electric Co.
   Anders also is a former astronaut with NASA's manned spacecraft
program. He was one of three crew members aboard the 1968 Apollo 8
lunar mission and served as a backup pilot for Apollo 11, the first
lunar landing.
   Pace, who had previously announced his intention to retire at

   Sony Corp.'s agreement to pay $3.4 billion for
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. will give Columbia's biggest
shareholder, Coca-Cola Co., a chance to get $1.45 billion in gross
revenue for its stock.
   Analysts said Wednesday Coca-Cola was likely to use it for soft
drink operations and to buy back its own stock.
   Coca-Cola owns 53.8 million shares or 49 percent of Columbia's
stock. The soft-drink maker signed an option agreement to sell its
stake to Sony for $27 a share, subject to ratification by the
Coca-Cola board which is to meet Monday.
   Coca-Cola spokesman Randy Donaldson declined to say what Coke
will do with the cash.
   But some analysts suggested the money would be used to
accelerate Coke's stock buy-back program or invest the cash in its
overseas bottling operations.
   ``I don't think they're going to get into any other business in
a material way,'' said George E. Thompson, a soft-drink industry
analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   John Maxwell Jr., who follows Coca-Cola for Wheat First
Securities in Richmond, Va., said he expects Coke will complete the
final portion of an ongoing 40 million share buyback program and
possibly start another one.
   He said Coca-Cola will probably also invest in its soft drink
business overseas.
   Coca-Cola got into the movie business in 1982 when it bought a
predecessor of Columbia Pictures. Coca-Cola subsequently launched a
new studio called Tri-Star Pictures in a joint venture with CBS
Inc. and Home Box Office Inc.
   In late 1987, Coca-Cola merged its entertainment business with
Tri-Star and wound up with 80 percent of the company that was
called Columbia Pictures Entertainmment. It then distributed part
of its interest in Columbia to Coca-Cola shareholders and retained
49 percent in Columbia.
   But Thompson said Coca-Cola was disappointed by its return on
motion pictures even though the television business was promising.
   In the current movie season, 28 movies from Columbia and its
sister company Tri-Star have accounted for only 14 percent of all
admissions sold.
   ``Before the ink was even dry on the (1982 Columbia)
acquisition, they realized they were in a business much more
volatile than they were used to,'' Thompson said.

<HEAD>Sony Purchase Should Stabilize Columbia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Betting lines on the effects of Sony Corp.'s
$3.4 billion buyout of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. emerged
quickly, with the deal evaluated as:
   _Bearish for present Columbia management, with Chief Executive
Victor Kaufman probably to be replaced by producer Peter Guber
(``Batman,'' ``Rain Man,'' ``Flashdance''), and studio chief Dawn
Steel's future uncertain.
   _Bullish for struggling Columbia, with Sony likely to bring
stability to a studio beset by shifting management strategies and
persistent rumors that controlling shareholder Coca-Cola Co. was
shopping for a buyer.
   _Bearish for the U.S. economy, as profits from yet another
all-American business go abroad.
   _But bullish for producers of movies, TV shows and recordings,
who sell to the entertainment giants that feed the world's
insatiable appetite for U.S. entertainment.
   Many in Hollywood were uneasy about Sony's purchase, the latest
and largest in a string of foreign investments in show business.
   ``The Japanese are buying up a vital American institution,
something that no one else in the world can do as well as we can,''
said an independent movie producer who insisted on anonymity
because he hopes to do business with the Columbia and Tri-Star
studios, both owned by Columbia Pictures.
   ``There just aren't that many people that know the music
business and the movie business, and you have to count on them to
run things.
   ``They're characters. They're flakes. And they're essential to
the business. ... I'm sure there must be a kind of culture shock to
the Japanese,'' the producer said.
   However, Alex Ben Block, editor in chief of Show Biz News, said
foreign investment, or at least ownership by internationally
oriented businesses, is inevitable. Only ``global mega-studios''
with multiple businesses can take full advantage of the booming
worldwide demand for U.S. entertainment, he said.
   Added Dale Pollock, vice president in charge of production at
A&amp;M Films, ``We're entering a new era of communications.
   ``It's global and it's not just studios,'' said Pollock, noting
that his company's parent, A&amp;M Records, is being bought by
Dutch-owned Polygram for $500 million.
   Another key example of the internationalizing of Hollywood:
media baron Rupert Murdoch, whose Australia-based News Corp. owns
20th Century Fox Film Corp.
   Murdoch's Fox TV network here and fledgling four-channel British
satellite TV network needs programming. He was outbid this month
for MGM-UA _ which like Columbia has a huge library of movies and
TV shows _ by another Australian outfit, Qintex Group.
   In researching a book on Fox, Block talked to Murdoch, who
``made it clear that strong, American-made programming opens doors
all over the world,'' Block said.
   ``It leads to advertising, joint ventures, a multitude of ways
to do business, and it all comes back to the American creative
force.''
   The big Hollywood outfits need legions of small companies to
feed them movies, television shows and recordings _ a boon for
Hollywood's creative forces.
   The deals bode well for moviegoers, Block said.
   ``It's going to stabilize these big companies, they're going to
make more movies and there will be that much more to choose from,''
Block said.
   But, he added, ``It's distressing to see this industry, one of
the last of the big purely American industries, be so bought up.''
   Block said he expected Sony to follow Japanese business practice
by asking trusted executives at CBS Records, which Sony bought two
years ago, and perhaps at SVS Films, a small movie company Sony
recently started, to help manage Columbia.
   The Columbia studio has swung from one end of the movie-making
spectrum to the other in recent years.
   High-toned British producer David Puttnam (``Chariots of Fire,''
``The Killing Fields'') ran it for 18 months but alienated such
Hollywood stalwarts as producer Ray Stark. Puttnam was replaced two
years ago by Dawn Steel, regarded as much more in the Hollywood
mainstream. But the studio's recent movies have had a mixed
showing, although its production of TV shows for the networks has
been very strong.
   Regardless of the makeup of Sony's management team for Columbia,
most observers believed that once set, it will remain in place for
a long time.
   Sony bought prestigious CBS Records in late 1987 for about $2
billion, and since has taken a hands-off approach, letting Walter
Yetnikoff run the nation's second-largest record company his way.
   CBS' artists, who include Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen,
don't seem to have minded Sony's ownership.
   ``I haven't really seen any major changes since the whole Sony
thing,'' said record producer Narada Walden, speaking in a
telephone interview from Kalamazoo, Mich. Walden has produced
records for Whitney Houston, Barbra Streisand and comedian Eddie
Murphy. ``They're very trusting.''

<HEAD>Sony Will Control All Aspects of Movie Business</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unlike any company before, Sony Corp. will
control every aspect of the motion-picture business with its
purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.
   Sony will own or produce the movie, the movie theater, the snack
bar, the soundtrack album, the television series adaptation, and
the VCR and stereo system on which the videocassette and album can
be played.
   In addition to yielding this fully integrated entertainment
power, Wednesday's Sony-Columbia deal will give the Japanese
electronics giant a repository of films and television programs to
show the world over.
   While not in the same league as the $14 billion Time-Warner
merger earlier this year, the $3.4 billion Sony-Columbia pact does
share the same motivation: survival in the booming international
entertainment emporium.
   ``We're entering a new era of communications,'' said Dale
Pollock, vice president in charge of production at A&amp;M Films.
   ``It's global and it's not just studios,'' said Pollock, noting
that his company's parent firm, A&amp;M Records, is being bought by
Dutch-owned Polygram for $500 million.
   Sony's new multinational enterprise follows a yearlong effort to
establish a Hollywood foothold.
   It will wed Sony's dominance in stereo, television set and tape
player manufacturing with Columbia's proficiency in movie and TV
production and motion-picture distribution and exhibition.
   More important, Sony will have the supply to meet international
demand. Entertainment is the United States' second-leading export,
accounting for a net trade surplus of about $5 billion. In the past
four years, overseas revenues from U.S. films have risen to $1.13
billion from $800 million.
   ``Fatal Attraction,'' for instance, recovered all of its
production costs in Japanese theaters alone. French channel TF1
recently paid $11 million for 200 episodes of ``Knots Landing.''
   With the coming deregulation of most of European television and
increasing sales of prerecorded videocassettes overseas, the
equation should continue to shift in favor of U.S. products.
   Columbia has a library of 2,770 feature films and 23,000
episodes of 260 television series.
   Movies in Columbia's collection include ``The Last Emperor,''
``Gandhi,'' ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' and ``The Natural.'' Sony also
will take over Loews Theater Management Corp., with more than 820
screens in 220 locations and a national theater snack bar operation.
   The marriage between Sony and Columbia resembles Sony's
acquisition of CBS Records. Sony purchased CBS Records _ home label
to Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen _ for about $2 billion in
late 1987, and let label head Walter Yetnikoff continue to run the
company the way he wanted. The label continues to be dominant.
   Early speculation, though, holds that Columbia studio chief Dawn
Steel will not remain at the helm.
   For Coca-Cola Co., Columbia's controlling stockholder for the
last seven years, the studio never proved to be the revenue center
the soft-drink giant hoped it would be. In the current movie
season, 28 movies from Columbia and its sister company, Tri-Star,
have accounted for only 14 percent of all admissions sold.
   Paramount Pictures, on the other hand, claimed 14.6 percent of
the box-office gate with just 10 titles.
   Tri-Star's ``Lock Up,'' Sylvester Stallone's new prison movie,
was a dud, grossing only $20.7 million in its first 52 days of
release. Columbia's ``The Karate Kid Part III'' made only $38.8
million, far less than its two predecessors.
   ``Casualties of War,'' Columbia's Vietnam film featuring Michael
J. Fox and Sean Penn, probably won't cover its $25 million cost at
the nation's theaters. The romantic comedy ``When Harry Met Sally
... '' was perhaps Columbia's most profitable title this year,
grossing more than $78 million through Tuesday.
   But as weakly as Columbia performed under Steel's leadership,
its fortunes have improved sharply from David Puttnam's reign of
error.
   Puttnam, the producer of such acclaimed films as ``Chariots of
Fire'' and ``The Killing Fields,'' was appointed president of
Columbia Pictures in the fall of 1986. His film slate was marked by
ambitious yet ultimately unpopular fare such as ``The Adventures of
Baron Munchausen,'' ``Housekeeping'' and ``Punchline.''
   In acquiring Columbia, Sony is following a path taken by other
overseas companies in recent months.
   MGM-UA, maker of last year's Oscar-winning ``Rain Man,'' is
being sold to a subsidiary of Australian entertainment company
Qintex Group for $15 billion. Australian-based News Corp. already
owns 20th Century Fox.
   Just weeks ago, Japanese hardware mammoth JVC teamed with
producer Larry Gordon (``Die Hard,'' ``Field of Dreams'') in a $100
million movie production joint venture.

<HEAD>Comex To Test Hand-Held Computer Terminals for Traders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commodity Exchange says it will test
hand-held, tamper-proof computer terminals for traders by early
next year, getting a jump on the Chicago futures exchanges.
   Floor traders in the pits will enter orders on the terminals
instead of on paper cards, making it all but impossible to change a
recorded transaction to conceal fraud, Comex said Wednesday.
   Federal investigations of allegations of fraud have resulted in
indictments on the Chicago exchanges. A separate probe is on
commodity exchange trading floors in both Chicago and New York. The
fraud supposedly involved brokers changing the size or time of a
trade on their cards to disguise wrongdoing.
   Chicago's two big exchanges, the Chicago Board of Trade and
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, are ``still in the talking stage'' on
their hand-held terminals, CBOT spokesman Mark Prout said.
   ``We'll be very interested to see what the Comex comes up with
and how it works,'' Prout said.
   The Commodity Exchange said it began planning the computer
system four years ago, well before the recent fraud allegations.
Spokesman Robert McGrath said he could not say when the system
would go into operation because it would depend on how the testing
goes.
   ``Hopefully the results of this project will be an important
step toward helping Comex to fully meet the proposed, new
regulatory mandates of the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading
Commission) and the U.S. Congress,'' Commodity Exchange Chairman
Robert Fink said in a statement.
   The Commodity Exchange, which trades gold, silver, copper and
aluminum futures contracts, is one of five futures exchanges that
share space in the World Trade Center in New York.
   McGrath said the other exchanges have not committed to adopting
the system, but added, ``There is some excitement about cooperating
and looking into the technology.''
   The other exchanges are the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange,
the New York Cotton Exchange, the New York Futures Exchange and the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The computer terminals, costing $2,000 to $3,000 each, will
weigh less than a pound and will be supplied by AGS Information
Services Inc., a unit of NYNEX Corp.
   At first trades will be recorded on tiny disks that will be
collected periodically by runners. Eventually the terminals
probably will be equipped with radio transmitters, AGS official Don
Rosen said.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower, Share Prices Bounce Back</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates with morning Nikkei, comments.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar remained lower against the Japanese
yen Thursday morning, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange bounced back from the previous day's losses.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average regained 192.72 points, or
0.54 percent, ending morning trading at 35,563.29, the highest
morning closing ever. It had lost 74.25 points Wednesday.
   The dollar ended the morning session at 140.83 yen. It opened at
140.70 yen, down 0.65 yen from Wednesday's 141.35-yen close, and
moved in the range of 140.65 to 141.00 yen.
   The dollar's lower opening followed its overnight decline on
overseas markets, triggered by central bank intervention for the
third consecutive day to push the U.S. currency down, traders said.
   Toru Kanai, foreign currency analyst with New Japan Securities
Co. Ltd., said the dollar-yen rate was moving closely around 140.70
yen in Tokyo as market players were discouraged by the Bank of
Japan's dollar-selling intervention.
   Following the Group of Seven industrial nations' agreement on
coordinated intervention last weekend in Washington to halt the
dollar's rise, the Japanese central bank has intermittently
conducted dollar-selling operations since Monday, he said.
   The Bank of Japan sold the dollar Thursday immediately after the
dollar exceeded 140.80 yen, and again sold more dollars when it
almost touched 141.00 yen, Kanai said.
   The amount of selling was unknown. The central bank does not
comment on its monetary actions.
   ``The only thing that keeps the dollar lower now is the closely
coordinated central bank intervention after the G-7 meeting,'' he
said.
   When the central banks loosen their intervention, the dollar
might rise back, but not as high as the level before the G-7
agreement, he said.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said the index rebounded as
market players were reassured by the stability in the dollar-yen
rate.
   Investment trust companies, which had been reluctant to make
major moves while the dollar's fluctuations were uncertain, started
buying, encouraging other market players' to increase their own
purchasing, they said.

<HEAD>Ex-Singer Chairman Gets Longest Term in Fraud Crackdown</HEAD>

   Former corporate raider Paul A. Bilzerian
received the stiffest sentence yet in the government's three-year
corruption probe but a federal judge said it won't necessarily
deter other financial crimes.
   ``I have been around the criminal justice system for 40 years,''
U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward said Wednesday before sentencing
Bilzerian to four years in jail and a $1.5 million fine.
   ``When I began my experience there were wheeler-dealers,'' he
said. ``As I sit here today I am fairly certain there is
wheeler-dealering going on within five miles of this building.''
   Bilzerian, a high-school dropout and Vietnam veteran who capped
a meteoric business career with the $1.06 billion takeover of
Singer Co., was convicted June 9 on nine counts of securities
fraud, conspiracy to commit tax fraud and making false statements
to the government.
   He also was sentenced to two years probation and 250 hours of
community service for a pattern of lawbreaking in three failed
takeovers and another stock deal in 1985 and 1986 that netted him
more than $12 million.
   Bilzerian had faced a maximum 45 years in prison and $2.25
million in fines. Still, his sentence was the longest to date in
cases derived from the confessions of jailed stock speculator Ivan
Boesky, who is serving a three-year term.
   ``The lure of money has caused him _ an intelligent young man _
to lose what I perceive to be proper perspective,'' Ward said. ``In
short, he lies.''
   The charges involved raids on apparel maker Cluett, Peabody &amp;
Co., building supplies maker H.H. Robertson &amp; Co. and Hammermill
Paper Co., and another transaction of Armco Inc. stock.
   Bilzerian plans to appeal, said his attorney, Arthur F. Mathews.
   ``My trial and conviction has publicly humiliated me and I am
sorry for any sorrow and shame I have caused my family and
friends,'' Bilzerian stated in a pre-sentencing letter to Ward. ``I
wish I could turn back the clock of time and correct whatever
mistakes I may have made.''
   Bilzerian was freed on bail pending appeal but Ward ordered
Bilzerian, who in July reported a net worth of $81.4 million, to
pay the fines within 30 days.
   None of the charges against Bilzerian involved his 1988 takeover
of Singer, the sewing-machine maker turned defense contractor.
   The Bilzerian conviction was the first jury verdict in the
government's continuing white-collar corruption probe, which began
with the May 1986 arrest of former trader Dennis Levine, who led
investigators to Boesky.
   Bilzerian was convicted of submitting false documents to the
Securities and Exchange Commission, filing false tax returns and
rigging transactions to skirt federal tax and disclosure laws in
tandem with Los Angeles stockbroker Boyd L. Jefferies, who
testified against Bilzerian.
   Jefferies, who testified against Bilzerian, recently received a
suspended sentence. Sentencing is pending for others, including six
former Princeton-Newport Partners LP defendants found guilty of
fraud and racketeering and former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
managing director Martin A. Siegel.
   Bilzerian, who resigned as Singer chairman in June, still faces
civil securities charges filed by the SEC seeking $31.3 million in
alleged illegal profits.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Brodsky cited Bilzerian's alleged
``arrogance and utter disregard for the law,'' said Bilzerian
committed perjury during the trial and said a lengthy prison term
would deter similar behavior on Wall Street.
   The case was the first criminal trial of illegal stock
``parking,'' in which securities ownership is disguised to dodge
federal tax or disclosure laws.
   ``Over an 18-month period Bilzerian committed serious securities
crimes over and over again,'' Brodsky said.
   Mathews sought a suspended sentence on the grounds that
Bilzerian was a first-time offender, that his prosecution was a
``novelty,'' that his crimes had no identifiable victims and that
deterrence had been achieved.

   The newest doorman at the Hyatt Regency Chicago
hotel appeared impressed with his job as he emptied a wad of
rumpled dollar bills from his uniform pocket.
   ``See, they even tip me,'' said the doorman, Darryl
Hartley-Leonard, president of Hyatt Hotel Corp.
   After his stint Wednesday at the front door, Hartley-Leonard was
headed to the check-in desk for a few hours, then an evening shift
as a bartender. It was all part of a program called ``Hyatt
in-Touch Day,'' under which 400 of the hotel chain's executives and
managers took service-level jobs for a day.
   Even Hyatt Corp. Chairman Thomas J. Pritzker, of the Chicago
family that owns the chain, did his bit, serving as a bellhop at
the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Washington, D.C.
   ``It's an attempt to stay in touch with the customers and the
line employees,'' said Hartley-Leonard, who intends to make the job
switch a yearly event.
   Wednesday was chosen because it was the 32nd anniversary of the
company's founding, he said.
   ``I started working for Hyatt 26 years ago as a desk clerk in
one of the California hotels, and I worked on the `line' until 11
years ago, when I had a chance to take a management job,'' said
Hartley-Leonard, 45. ``I only realized recently that of the 426
executives and employees in our corporate headquarters, 340 had
never actually worked in a hotel.
   ``By doing service jobs for a day, maybe they'll understand a
bit more what service means,'' he said.
   The experiment meant sending computer experts out as
chambermaids and business analysts as busboys.
   At the Hyatt Regency Chicago, General Manager Rod Young was busy
just keeping track of where each of his new employees was.
   One of them, Jim Evans, senior vice president for sales, was
assisting Roosevelt Moncure, a convention services floor manager,
who was teaching him how to ``turn'' a banquet room.
   ``This is one of more than 60 banquet rooms in this hotel, and
they're all booked full this week,'' Moncure said. ``We just had it
set `theater-style' for 150 people, and now we're cleaning it out
and setting it `conference style' for 20 people. We've got to have
it ready by 6:30 p.m., and if the guests tell us they're bringing
in 10 more people, we've got to be ready for them.''
   ``I'm learning how to set up tables,'' said Evans. ``I haven't
done this sort of work for 19 years, and then it was for another
chain. Normally, I'd be selling this space to convention groups and
just conferring with Moncure and his people once a week to discuss
the schedule.''
   Despite any slowdowns the managers-in-training may have caused
in the line jobs, the ``Hyatt in-Touch'' day appeared to be good
for customer relations. Outside the hotel, Hartley-Leonard grinned
as he told of one early-morning encounter with a guest.
   ``She looked at my name tag and said, `No, you're not,' but I
told her, `Oh, yes I am,''' he said. ``Another lady, who knew what
was going on, told her friend, `See what a good company does? My
boss would never do this.'''

<TEXT>
   Producer Peter Guber, whose productions have
included such megahits as ``Batman'' and ``Rain Man,'' is
reportedly considering running Columbia Pictures Entertainment for
new owner Sony Corp.
   Victor Kaufman, Columbia's president and chief executive, has
said he intends to resign when Sony completes its $3.4 billion
buyout of the company.
   Guber, who was in New York, where Columbia is headquartered, was
unavailable for comment. Andrea Jaffe, a spokeswoman representing
the Guber-Peters Entertainment Co., declined comment on the rumor.
   In a development early today, Guber-Peters announced that it had
accepted a proposal from Sony USA Inc. to acquire the movie company
for $17.50 a share, or about $200 million.
   The deal is expected to be completed before the end of 1989, the
company said in a statement. Under terms of the agreement, Sony
will begin a tender offer next week for all Guber-Peters shares,
which will be followed by a cash merger.
   Guber and his partner, former hairdresser Jon Peters, produced
the summer blockbuster, ``Batman,'' and were executive producers of
the Academy Award-winning ``Rain Man.''
   Guber has received high marks within the industry. ``He was very
smart about how to handle the movie,'' said Mark Johnson, the
producer of ``Rain Man.''
   Independent producer John Davis noted that ``the expertise to
run a studio is so specialized that they (Sony) pretty much have to
pick an insider and let go of the reins.''
   Guber, 47, attended New York University Law School and spent
seven years working for Columbia, including a two-year stint as
vice president of worldwide production.
   He left the company in 1976, joining record producer Neal Bogart
to form Casablanca Records and Filmworks. In 1980, Guber teamed up
with Peters to form PolyGram Pictures. PolyGram was sold in 1983,
the same year Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. was launched.
   Guber-Peters merged with Barris Industries, home of television's
``The Gong Show,'' two years ago.
   In the fiscal year ended May 31, Guber-Peters lost $19.2 million
on revenues of $23.7 million. The company has yet to realize any
profits from either ``Rain Man'' or ``Batman.''
   In addition to their reputation as topflight producers, Guber
and Peters also own the television shows ``The Dating Game,'' ``The
Gong Show'' and ``The Newlywed Game.''
   They are best known, however, for their smash ``Batman.'' So far
the Warner Bros. film, starring Michael Keaton in the title role
and Jack Nicholson as The Joker, has collected $244.7 million,
making it the fifth most successful film in Hollywood history.
Including all ancillary markets and merchandise, ``Batman's'' total
take could exceed $1 billion.
   The producing team also succeeded in delivering last year's best
picture winner ``Rain Man,'' starring Dustin Hoffman as an autistic
adult on the road with his scheming brother, Tom Cruise. The film
won four Oscars in all.
   Guber and Peters also produced ``Gorillas in the Mist,''
``Flashdance,'' ``The Color Purple,'' ``Missing,'' ``Midnight
Express,'' ``The Witches of Eastwick,'' ``Innerspace'' and
``Caddyshack II.''
   The producers' rumored move to Columbia could be complicated
severely by the team's recent renewal of a five-year deal with
Warner Bros.
   The pair had a number of films in development with Warner Bros.,
including a ``Batman'' sequel due in 1991, the film adaptation of
the books ``Bonfire of the Vanities'' and ``A Bright Shining Lie''
and the movies ``Contact'' and ``Damien.''

   U.S. Ambassador Michael Armacost called today for
further reform of Japan's import and distribution systems and
chided the press for using phrases denoting confrontation to
describe U.S.-Japan trade relations.
   ``You need to take bolder steps to ensure that where there are
barriers to imported products, they be removed,'' Armacost said in
a speech to the Japan National Press Club.
   ``Impatience with those barriers grows with your economic
success,'' he said. ``The answer is not regulated trade, but for
you to deregulate areas of the economy in which, if you'll allow me
as a foreigner to say, your citizens enjoy the fruits of your labor
in your own market.''
   He singled out Japan's complex distribution system as a barrier
to international trade that should be addressed.
   Armacost, 52, took up his duties as U.S. envoy in Tokyo in May.
He was previously undersecretary of state for political affairs and
before that ambassador to the Philippines.
   He said that press reports, to some extent American but
primarily Japanese, perpetuate trade problems with provocative
language.
   ``One rarely sees U.S.-Japan trade described without the
emphasis being placed almost exclusively upon `masatsu'
(friction),'' he said. ``We're always hearing about the `cherry
war,' the `beef and oranges war,' the `landing of foreign
capital.'''
   ``One gets the impression from the press that Japan is an armed
fort. Trade is not like war, not a zero-sum game. Trade benefits
both sides,'' he said.
   He also said Japanese media promulgate the myth of Japanese
uniqueness _ that Japan is so different from other countries it
should be treated differently.
   ``Japanese uniqueness is overstated and used selectively,'' he
said. ``Acknowledgment of differences is fair, but not a defense
against making any adjustments to the new realities.''
   He urged the Japanese press not to portray the U.S. economy as
in decline.
   ``Don't worry about us, don't patronize us,'' he said, calling
the American economy ``robust.'' He said U.S. workers are
increasing product quality, productivity and export consciousness.
   A spate of recent talks between Tokyo and Washington, from
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and President Bush down to
working-level officials, show that Japan and the United States
``are necessary partners and natural competitors,'' Armacost said.

   Many of the planned closings will involve smaller or older
plants where production will be consolidated into larger, more
modern ones.
   Twenty of the closings will involve dairy plants and branches to
be sold or closed in non-growth areas.
   Ventres says Borden will remain committed to dairy markets where
it has been doing well.
   ``We're very committed to Elsie,'' he said. ``You may say
Elsie's gone on a little diet here ... but she'll be with us,''
Ventres said referring to the cow that has symbolized Borden's
dairy business.
   Borden, which has claimed to be the biggest dairy in the world,
hasn't been losing money in dairy, Ventres said, adding ``We're
just not making the money we want.'' It wasn't immediately known
whether Borden will lose its No.1 ranking.
   Borden's program will reduce its worldwide employment by about
7,000 from the present 46,000.
   Ventres said the goal of the consolidation in dairy and its
other planned moves is to make Borden a lowest-cost producer in
each of its six main businesses by 1992.

   Ventres characterized Borden's plans as a continuation of the
five-year growth strategy the company has been pursuing since 1986.
   In the first phase, Borden boosted its sales by about 60 percent
and doubled its snacks business and tripled its pasta business
through 77 acquisitions around the world, mostly in food and
consumer products. The acquisitions added $3.1 billion to annual
sales.
   The plan outlined today was two-fold.
   First, Borden plans cost reductions aimed at increasing profit
margins in the areas of business in which the company has been
growing rapidly since the mid-1980s.
   Borden, which has six main lines of business, says it is the
world's leading producer in pasta, dairy, wallcoverings and forest
products adhesives. It claims to be No.2 in salty snacks.
   Some of Borden's best-known brands include Wise snacks, such as
Cheez Doodles, Eagle Brand dairy products and Classico tomato
sauce. It also makes Elmer's Glue and various paints and varnishes.
   The second part of Borden's plan involves the restructuring of
the dairy operations. The business will shrink by about one-third,
or by $700 million to $750 million, so Borden can shift its
concentration to its strongest markets.
   The exit from as yet unspecified dairy markets primarily will
involve fluid milk and cultured products.
   The $404 million after-tax reserve, which will be taken against
third-quarter earnings, is expected to improve pre-tax earnings by
more than $340 million through 1993, Borden said.
   The company projected global sales will increase to about $7.6
billion in 1989, up from 1988 sales of $7.2 billion.

   Merck &amp; Co., the nation's leading drug
company, and E.I Du Pont de Nemours and Co. are joining forces to
develop a new class of heart disease medicine under a research and
marketing pact, the companies said today.
   As part of the collaboration, Merck will turn over to
Wilmington, Del.-based Du Pont the rights to sell two of its drugs
in exchange for a percentage of the proceeds.
   In an unusual arrangement, Merck said it was allowing Du Pont to
market Sinemet, a major treatment for Parkinson's disease, and
Vaseretic, a hyper-tension drug, so it could focus on marketing
other products.
   Sinemet accounted for $100 million of Merck's $5.94 billion in
sales last year. Spokesman John Doorley said Vaseretic's revenues
were less, but he didn't know the precise figure.
   The other half of the collaboration gives Du Pont, a chemical,
energy and specialty products giant, access to Merck's highly
proficient research staff and expertise at bringing products to
market in developing a new class of heart disease medicine.
   The class, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, was developed by
Du Pont, a leader in the area. Angiotensin II, or AII, is a major
hormone and factor in high blood pressure.
   The companies said the treatment is particularly safe because it
acts on a very specific part of a person's body chemistry.
   Merck's researchers will work on the AII compounds, which are
now in human trials. The companies hope to bring it to market in
the mid-1990s, Doorley said.
   Medical products accounted for $1.3 billion of Du Pont's $32.9
billion in revenues last year. Pharmaceutical sales totaled $350
million.

   Swissair and Scandinavian Airlines
System today agreed to to acquire up to 10 percent of each other
and unify some traffic routes and travel services.
   The cooperation agreement focuses on the airlies' service to
Europe, Africa and the Middle East, and is similar to a joint pact
between Swissair and Delta Air Lines signed earlier this year.
   The airlines said in a statement released in Zurich that the
they will complete acquisition of between 5 percent and 10 percent
of each other during 1990. In addition, the airlines said may
exchange seats on their boards of directors.
   Zurich-based Swissair and Stockholm, Sweden-based SAS said the
deal was undertaken to strengthen the airlines' European market
base and provide more efficient intercontinental services for the
1990s.
   The SAS-Swissair agreement also will cover travel products,
hotels, inflight catering and restaurant operations, aircraft
maintenance, fleet planning and other services, the statement said.
   ``We share the same customer-oriented marketing philosophy, and
both attach great importance to a quality product,'' Swissair
President Otto Loepfe said in the statement.
   Atlanta-based Delta, fearing it could be a takeover target,
agreed in July to sell a 5 percent share to Swissair as a defensive
move. Delta also took a 5 percent stake in the Swiss carrier. The
two also have a marketing agreement, signed earlier.
   SAS and Swissair said they will feed traffic into each other's
routes to and from the Middle East, Africa and the Indian
subcontinent. They also said they will increase service between
Switzerland and Scandinavia.
   SAS, the first foreign airline to buy a stake in a major U.S.
carrier, signed a $50 million cooperation agreement with Texas Air
Corp. last October and holds 9.9 percent of the Houston-based
company. SAS recently was in talks to buy a stake in struggling
Continental Airlines, one of Texas Air's main subsidiaries, but
later said it had no immediate interest.
   European airlines have been seeking ways of positioning
themselves to exploit the Common Market deregulation set to begin
in 1992.
   Air France and Lufthansa German Airlines signed an accord on
Sept. 15 calling for cooperation in marketing, maintenance,
scheduling and cargo. Lufthansa also has disclosed that it has held
talks with AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, about a possible
stake in American's Sabre computer reservations system.

<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures were slightly higher,
reflecting signs of stronger foreign demand, while wheat futures
slipped a bit early in today's session on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Support for the markets stemmed from talk of possible new export
business with Pakistan, Mexico and the Soviet Union after several
weeks of slow export activity.
   Especially supportive were rumors that the Soviet Union was
looking to buy up to 3 million metric tons of U.S. corn or sorghum,
and signs that the Soviets recently purchased grain from Canada and
soybean meal from South America.
   The Soviets had indicated earlier this month they would import
no more grain this year.
   ``What this is telling the market is that all the rhetoric about
them not buying is just purely rhetoric, that they are in to buy
and it's just a matter of terms,'' said William Biedermann,
director of research with Allendale Inc., a futures brokerage in
Crystal Lake, Ill.
   Early losses in the wheat market may have reflected
position-evening by traders ahead of this afternoon's quarterly
Agriculture Department report on U.S. grain stocks.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent to 1} cents lower
with the contract for delivery in December at $3.97\ a bushel; corn

oats were } cent to 1{ cents higher with December at $1.45\ a

with September at 83 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent lower
to .05 cent higher with October at 43.25 cents a pound; frozen pork

<TEXT>
   Until this week, ``Who's the Boss?'' simply
identified one of the more popular television shows from Columbia
Pictures Entertainment Inc.
   But in the wake of Columbia's agreement to a $3.4 billion cash
buyout by Sony Corp., it is a valid question for one of Hollywood's
biggest film and television production companies.
   Columbia said Wednesday that its president and chief executive,
Victor A. Kaufman, and its chief operating officer, Lew Korman,
intend to resign on completion of the buyout, which the company
expects will be in November.
   Sony executives privately confirmed they were courting movie
producer Peter Guber for a major role at the company.
   Early today, Guber's production company, Guber-Peters
Entertainment Co., announced it agreed to be acquired by Sony USA
for $17.50 a share, or about $200 million.
   Published reports said Guber was being recruited to replace
Kaufman. Guber, who co-produced ``Batman,'' ``Rain Man,'' and
``Flashdance,'' is considered one of Hollywood's top producers.
   But spokesmen for Sony and Columbia each declined comment on
whether Sony's agreement to buy the company meant Guber would take
Kaufman's place.
   Sony issued a statement saying, ``We will not comment on the
terms of the merger agreement which will be made a matter of public
record in due course.''
   Once the management issues are resolved, Sony said, it intends
to place day-to-day operation of Columbia Pictures in the hands of
U.S. management just as it has done with its previous big U.S.
entertainment acquisition, CBS Records.
   The deal for Columbia comes nearly two years after the huge
Japanese video and audio equipment maker bought CBS Records for $2
billion.
   It marks the biggest step of Sony's push into the ``software''
side of the entertainment business that will provide products such
as movies and records to complement its stereos, televisions and
videocassette recorders.
   Christopher Dixon, entertainment industry analyst for the
investment firm Kidder Peabody &amp; Co., called it ``an opportunistic
purchase'' for Sony that will likely look even better a few years
from now.
   He said Sony learned from its experience with CBS Records that
owning a company that produces software can help insure the
popularity of new technological gadgets, such as compact disk
players.
   Owning a film and television production company could come in
handy as Sony introduces new types of playback devices, Dixon said.
It also could give Sony its own sounding board in the professional
community that could help in its development of equipment needed to
produce shows for high-definition TV sets.
   Dixon said the company's experience with CBS Records also may
have taught Sony about the potential of the video market outside
the United States.
   And finally, he said, Sony recognizes that the number of
companies with film and TV libraries the size Columbia's are
shrinking.
   Companies with Hollywood studios, including Warner
Communications Inc., MGM-UA Entertainment Co. and 20th Century Fox,
have been acquired recently.
   Columbia owns more than 2,700 movies, including classics such as
``Lawrence of Arabia'' and ``The Bridge on the River Kwai,'' as
well as the more recent ``Ghostbusters'' and ``The Karate Kid.''
   Its 23,000 TV episodes include the prime-time shows ``Designing
Women'' and ``Married ... With Children,'' the syndicated ``Barney
Miller'' and the classic ``Father Knows Best.''
   Sony plans to launch a tender offer of $27 a share for all of
Columbia's stock Tuesday, but already has option agreements for
more than half of Columbia's shares at that price, including the 49
percent held by Coca-Cola Co. and about 3 percent held by the
investment firm Allen &amp; Co. Inc.
   Coca-Cola stands to collect $1.45 billion in gross proceeds from
selling its nearly 54 million Columbia shares to Sony, subject to
approval by Coca-Cola's board. The board meets Monday.
   The Atlanta-based company declined to comment on what it intends
to do with the cash, but analysts speculated that it would invest
in its soft-drink operations overseas and possibly repurchase some
of its stock.
   In trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Columbia
rose 25 cents a share to closet at $26.50, while Coca-Cola rose 50
cents a share to $64.62{.
   Stephen A. Schwarzman, president and chief executive of The
Blackstone Group, which advised Sony, said Sony had been looking at
various Hollywood companies for more than a year.
   Michael Schulhof, vice chairman of Sony Corp. of America, said
talks with Columbia became serious only in the past week. He said
Sony decided to make a proposal over last weekend and presented it
to Columbia's board Monday.
   Columbia began as a tiny studio in 1920 and grew into a major
Hollywood force, placing fourth with 14 percent of 1989 domestic
box-office revenues through Sept. 4, according to the trade journal
Variety.
   Its owns two film studios, Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star
Pictures, the television production companies Columbia Pictures
Television and Merv Griffin Enterprises, and operates 820 motion
picture screens in 220 locations.

   The European Community must drop possible
restrictions against nonmember financial institutions as it plans
for economic and monetary union by 1992 or risk provoking
retaliation from the United States, a U.S. official said today.
   ``We still see dangers in the EC concept of reciprocity''
despite European assurances and improvements in the proposed
reciprocity provisions, Treasury Undersecretary David C. Mulford
said in testimony prepared for a House Banking financial
institutions subcommittee.
   The 12-nation European Economic Community hopes by 1992 to
remove internal trade barriers and interlock economic policies and
goals. The United States and other non-European nations are
concerned that the program could create a protectionist ``Fortress
Europe'' against nonmember goods and services.
   ``EC proposals for reciprocity in financial services continue to
concern us,'' Mulford said, `` ... because access to the EC market
will still be conditional on the treatment of EC firms in
third-country markets.''
   ``Despite the softening of reciprocity, the implied threat
remains a potentially powerful instrument, which makes us uneasy,''
he said.
   ``Moreover, once this `club in the closet' is on the books,
there will be a temptation to use it, especially given the EC's
desire to promote changes in the U.S. financial system,'' Mulford
testified.
   ``If actually used _ or rather `misused' _ this would run the
risk of provoking a retaliation action from U.S. authorities ... If
U.S. firms are discriminated against in the EC, there would likely
be consequences for EC national institutions.''
   Mulford expressed confidence that U.S.-European differences can
be worked out.
   But, he said, ``officials come and go, and there are always
risks of misunderstandings. I ask the Europeans: Wouldn't it be
better to lay these reciprocity weapons aside?''

   General Motors Corp. on Thursday modified its
incentive program for some 1989 Chevrolet cars and trucks and GMC
trucks.
   The company said in a news release that it was taking the action
to ``clean up past model-year inventory.''
   Rebates ranging from $400 to $1,250 or financing with interest
rates as low as 6.9 percent will be offered indefinitely to buyers
of certain vehicles, the company said.

<HEAD>Cigna Takes Charge To Cover Hugo Losses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cigna Corp. said Thursday it will take a $90
million after-tax charge in the third-quarter to cover losses from
Hurricaine Hugo in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the
southeastern United States.
   Gavin R. Arton, Cigna vice president of financial relations,
said the insurance giang identified 75 percent of the losses as
commercial property _ including hotels, offices, shops and
industrial sites _ devastated by the tropical storm. The remaining
25 percent is damage to personal property, he said.
   The $90 million also includes an estimated $30 million for
reinsurance reinstatement charges, Arton said.
   ``We buy reinsurance in order to protect ourselves against this
happening again,'' he said.
   Cigna plans to report its results for the third quarter on Nov.
2.
   Officials have estimated the hurricane, which killed 28 people
on the U.S. mainland and 33 in the Caribbean, left as much as $3
billion in damage.
   Arton said Cigna agents conducted a week-long investigation at
the sites where the hurricance hit to assess the company's losses.
   ``There are parts of the Virgin Island that we haven't been able
to get to,'' he said.

<HEAD>Japanese Turning Cold Shoulder To Globex: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese government is pressuring Japanese
financial firms not to participate in an automated international
futures trading network being developed by the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, according to a published report.
   Japan's Ministry of Finance is afraid that when the Merc system,
called Globex, goes on line later this year, Japanese firms will
forsake Tokyo's fledgling futures markets to trade financial
futures on Globex, the Chicago Tribune reported in today's editions.
   ``It's another example of the mighty hammer of Japanese
bureaucracy crashing down on the concept of free trade,'' said a
Tokyo-based U.S trade official who was not identified in the
Tribune story.
   Globex, designed to facilitate global, 24-hour futures trading,
would be weakened without the participation of the Japanese, who
opened their own futures markets in June. The Merc has been wooing
Japanese business.
   Nick Ronalds, deputy managing director of the Merc's Tokyo
office, said the Merc had heard nothing official from the Japanese
regarding Globex.
   ``As far as we're concerned, the Japanese are still studying the
matter,'' Ronalds told the Tribune. ``We've provided them with all
the information and we are still waiting for their response.''

   Stock prices staged a mild rally today in buying
encouraged by the market's recent resilience in the face of
negative news.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.84 to 2,679.90 by
noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 697 up, 542 down and
529 unchanged.
   In Wednesday's trading the market was confronted with a drop in
the dollar, higher interest rates, and word from International
Business Machines that its third-quarter earnings would fall well
short of analysts' estimates.
   But stocks bounced back from an early decline to finish mixed,
impressing many observers.
   If that combination of events failed to send prices lower,
traders reasoned, the market might be ready for a rally.
   Meanwhile, interest rates levelled off in the credit markets,
showing little change in today's trading.
   IBM shares, down 6 on Wednesday, dropped another 2{ to 109 as
the most active Big Board issue today.
   AVX jumped 8\ to 29~. The company agreed to be acquired by
Japan's Kyocera Corp. through an exchange of stock. Kyocera's
American depositary shares rose [ to 80|.
   L.A. Gear dropped 1~ to 43\. The company reported sharply higher
profits for its latest fiscal quarter, but some traders evidently
took profits on that widely anticipated news.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.52 to 192.34. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.94 at 384.98.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 73.67 million shares at

   Continued slow sales of Chevrolet pickup
trucks will add another week's layoff to the two-week shutdown at
the General Motors Corp. Moraine assembly plant.
   A company spokesman said Wednesday the previously announced
layoff of 2,500 workers will be extended until Oct. 23. The plant
makes Chevrolet S-10 and S-15 pickup trucks.
   ``It is strictly an inventory adjustent. In looking at the sales

sales,'' said GM spokesman Tom Klipstine.
   In addition to the Moraine plant, GM's other two light-truck
assembly plants in Pontiac, Mich., and Shreveport, La., will close
for three weeks because of slow sales, he said.
   Through Sept. 20, sales of S-10 pickups were down 4.8 percent to

<HEAD>Union Official: Top Northwest Executives Have Resigned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top executives at Northwest Airlines _
probably including Chairman Steven Rothmeier _ have resigned, the
leader of the carrier's largest union said today.
   Guy Cook, chairman of the International Association of
Machinists District Lodge 143, said he was informed of the
resignations this morning by new owner Alfred Checchi. He said
Checchi did not name the executives who have resigned.
   ``Checchi told me there have been some resignations at the upper
level,'' Cook said. ``I assume that Rothmeier is one of them. He
(Checchi) emphasized that he did not push anyone out.''
   Checchi led an investment group that purchased NWA in June for
$3.65 billion. The group includes Washington, D.C., merchant banker
Fred Malek, who was a finalist in 1987 for the top job at United
Airlines, a position that went to Stephen Wolf.
   Analysts speculated at the time of the buyout by Checchi's group
that Malek would replace Rothmeier as chief executive. However,
Checchi repeatedly said he wanted Rothmeier to continue to lead the
airline.
   Rothmeier's secretary said he was at the company's Eagan
headquarters today but was not available for an interview. She said
she was under instructions not to comment on whether he had
resigned. Checchi could not be reached for comment. Cook, who leads
the largest union at Northwest, said Checchi called him from the
company's headquarters.
   Northwest spokesmen would not confirm nor deny the report.
Others reported to have resigned include John Horn, president and
chief operating officer, Benjamin G. Griggs Jr., executive vice
president of NWA Companies, Allan Pray, executive vice
president-international, and William Sitter, executive vice
president-administration and chief information officer.
   Sitter has been hired by Allstate Insurance Co. of Northbrook,
Ill. as chief information officer and a member of the company's
board of directors, a spokesman for the insurance company told the
Associated Press today.
   Rothmeier oversaw the 1986 acquisition of Republic Airlines and
led management's fight against a hostile takeover bid of Northwest
early this year by oil billionaire Marvin Davis. The battle ended
in June, when Checchi's group completed its all-cash buyout of the
carrier for $121 a share.
   Checchi repeatedly had said he wanted Rothmeier to continue to
run the carrier, the nation's fourth largest.
   In March, NWA's board approved a severance package that would
pay Rothmeier more than $2 million if he were to leave the airline.
   Rothmeier, 42, joined Northwest in 1973 and held a number of
executive posts before being named president and chief operating
officers in 1983. He became chief executive officer and chairman in
1986.
   Rothmeier's term as chairman was marked by long contract battles
with the airline's three principal unions, but he leaves with all
three groups under long-term pacts.

   Curt Carlson was a salesman in 1938. In 1988 he
sat atop an almost fully owned, personally assembled empire with
sales of more than $5.3 billion a year, one of the biggest
companies in America.
   Today in Minnetonka, Minn., he steps away from day-to-day
operations of Carlson Companies Inc., employer of 55,000 people
worldwide, and operator of more than 200 hotels and 400 restaurants
in just one of its smaller divisions.
   It was built from within, by shrewd and intensive management,
and from without by equally shrewd purchases and considerable
franchising, and by setting what appeared to be impossible goals
that were always achieved.
   In the early years Carlson sometimes doubled his company's size
in a year. Between 1938 and 1978, the first billion-dollar year,
growth averaged about 33 percent a year. Since then, the goal has
been to double every five years.
   In the first year of the latest five-year plan the goal, growth
of about 15 percent a year, was exceeded. This year, the company is
right on target. No reason, says Carlson, not to expect sales of
$9.2 billion in 1992.
   He admits to pinching himself. ``We (he and wife Arleen)
appreciate how lucky we are. Time and again, some little thing
happened that was lucky for us. Sometimes I think it was divine
intervention. I wonder.''
   But he also thinks that entrepreneurial opportunities are even
greater today, because banks are easier to deal with, there are tax
advantages and franchising greatly reduces the risk of starting a
business.
   Carlson's saga began in the Great Depression, when he founded
Gold Bond Trading Stamps, sold the idea to a grocery store, put up
his pennants and promotional paraphernalia and invited Arleen, his
fiance, to view the scene.
   ``We went down there the night before in the darkness with a
flashlight,'' he said, ``and I told her that if it worked I could
sell them all,'' meaning every grocery store. Gold Bond became one
of America's largest stamp companies.
   As stamps saturated the retail market, Carlson spotted other
growth areas, structured the company into marketing, hospitality
and travel groups and, using internally generated profits and
borrowings, penetrated those areas.
   The marketing operation is now the largest provider of corporate
incentive training programs. The hospitality group runs 223
Radisson hotels and resorts, 260 Country Kitchens and 152 TGI
Friday's outlets. The travel group is North America's largest
travel agent, with 1,000 offices under names such Ask Mr. Foster,
P. Lawson Travel and Neiman Marcus Travel.
   The three are mutually supportive, synergistic groups.
   After today, all this becomes the domain of chief executive
officer Edwin ``Skip'' Gage, a 20-year veteran of the marketing
group, which now provides two-thirds of volume and profit. He is
Carlson's son-in-law.
   ``I know that some people, because he is my son-in-law, have
said things,'' Carlson said this week. But Gage, he says, has
earned the job _ been tested under fire and performed well.
Carlson, 75, isn't likely to err at this point.
   Confident in his choice, he dismisses notions that his decision
isn't good business. ``I think of President Kennedy's remark when
he named brother Robert attorney general, that nepotism isn't bad
if you keep it in the family.''
   Is it possible to turn over the reins of so personal a package?
The answer, of course, lies in the action taken _ and while that
action does indeed remove Carlson from management, it still leaves
him as the money man. Money is power.
   Carlson will remain chairman of a newly created holding company,
Carlson Holdings, Inc., ``but I've made it crystal clear that my
job is governance, not management.''
   Governance, as he describes it, does indeed take him out of many
decisions. But it elevates rather than removes. The holding company
is above all the various Carlson elements. He will distance himself
but remain aware.
   He is determined to avoid interfering, ``because I know that if
I'm bold enough to stick my nose into something then I have to stay
with it.'' At this stage of life, he says, that isn't what he seeks.
   ``I want to be free to do what I want, to vacation and read
something other than the business magazines and the Wall Street
Journal.
   ``I've had a boat since 1962, and only two times have I been on
it for two weeks. And, I've never taken the boat with Arleen alone;
there's always been business people aboard.''
   He sounded determined, but could he keep his distance if the
company shows signs of deserting its culture and experimenting?
   ``I'm not going to interfere if we break from tradition a bit,''
he said. ``But we cannot deviate and fail to hit the figures. I'll
go along for two or three years, and then we'll compromise.''
   He said he was removing himself. ``I've got good intentions,''
and lots of other things to do, he said.

   Volume was a light 403.5 million shares, down from 428.9 million

   Dealers said shares declined throughout the session on investor
worries that British interest rates would need to be pushed higher
soon to shore up the sagging pound.
   The pound has been weak since Tuesday when the government
reported Britain's third-worst trade deficit for a single month.

   More than $4 billion in FHA mortgage insurance
losses last year _ half to fraud and mismanagement _ have trippled
the cost of the still unfolding scandals at the Department of
Housing and Urban Development, officials said today.
   The chairman of a special house panel examining all of the
government's insurance programs and HUD's inspector general agreed
that the cost to taxpayers of wrongdoing and mismanagement at HUD
has swelled to $6.9 billion from the $2.2 billion previously
believed.
   In a long-awaited audit, the General Accounting Office estimated
Wednesday that the Federal Housing Administration lost $4.2 billion
in fiscal 1988 in defaults on home mortgages that it insured.
   But Comptroller General Charles Bowsher, head of the
congressional watchdog agency, said that estimate could be as much
as $1 billion too low because of the poor books kept by FHA and HUD
and budgetary accounting practices in use throughout the government.
   Including expected losses this year and interest on covering the
past losses, Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., chairman of a House
Budget Committee tax force examining urgent fiscal issues for the
government, said the price of fraud and mismanagement at HUD has
jumped to $6.9 billion.
   ``That sounds like a reasonable estimate to me,'' said Paul
Adams, HUD's inspector general whose report last spring on
mismanagment in the department's housing rehabilitation program
touched off a series of investigations by Congress and the Justice
Department into other HUD programs.
   ``It seems like there's a new volcano erupting every month over
at HUD,'' said Rep. Marcy Kaptor, D-Ohio. ``I fully put the blame
at the feet of Ronald Reagan and the people who were supposed to be
running the government the past decade.''
   Government auditors said the FHA fund that has helped millions
of Americans buy homes is in the red for the first time in history
and will need up to $5 billion from Congress over the next few
years.
   Some of the shortfall stemmed from homeowners in economically
strapped areas of the country being unable to make their house
payments, Bowsher said.
   But he said at least half of it is due to mismanagment at HUD
and fraud by private mortgage insurers who were allowed to write
FHA mortgages under changes made by the Reagan administration in
1983 to privatize part of the program.
   ``You have to monitor what's happening in the private sector
when you delegate to the private sector,'' Bowsher said today,
likening the FHA abuses to those that occurred in the savings and
loan industry under the 1980s climate of deregulation.
   Bowsher on Wednesday told the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban
Affairs housing subcommittee there were a record 203,000 FHA-backed
mortgage foreclosures last year _ concentrated in what he called
the ``oil patch'' states of Alaska, Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana
and a few other areas suffering severe economic downturns.
   That rash of personal financial failures, combined with the
bankruptcy of three big private companies that help insure the
Federal Housing Administration's multi-family and hospital
construction programs, account for most of a $4.2 billion one-year
loss in the consolidated FHA insurance fund, the report said.
   Subtracted from a surplus entering the year, the loss resulted
in the $2.9 billion deficit at the end of the year.
   Moreover, the GAO chief said a record number of new FHA loans
issued in 1985-86 will mean more red ink ahead _ no matter what new
Housing Secretary Jack Kemp does _ as those new mortgages work
through the traditionally rocky third and fourth years when
strapped homeowners tend to sink or swim.
   Bowsher predicted Congress will need to appropriate as much as
$5 billion over the next several years to keep the insurance fund
solvent.
   An estimated 9 million American families have purchased homes
with FHA-backed loans since the program was set up in 1934, and
about 900,000 do so each year.
   The home loan program was self-supporting until 1988, with
insurance fees paid by all borrowers more than offsetting losses
resulting from defaulted loans.
   The GAO said the 1988 ``losses are directly attributable to
rising defaults in economically stressed regions, losses from sales
of foreclosed properties and the failure of several large (private)
coinsurers.
   ``The extent of losses attributable to program fraud and abuse
is not yet known,'' the report continued. ``There are, however, a
number of serious problems in the financial management of FHA which
contribute to its losses.''
   The report noted that the ``accounting and financial management
problems have been longstanding and well documented'' in prior
reports to Congress going back to the early 1980s. Bowsher said
Congress must bear some of the blame for inadequate oversight.
   At the same time, he agreed with committee members and HUD
officials who emphasized that the FHA financial problems are
nowhere near the scope of those involved in the savings and loan
insurance fund.
   He noted that he has met with Kemp and other new HUD officials
and received their full cooperation in assessing the FHA problems
and placing last year's losses at $4.2 billion rather than the $858
million reported earlier by the Reagan administration. Bowsher said
he found the Kemp team ``anxious to do the right thing.''
   HUD Assistant Secretary C. Austin Fitts, brought in by Kemp to
oversee the FHA, appeared with Bowsher at the subcommittee hearing.
   ``We acknowledge that FHA has incurred substantial losses,'' she
said. ``The bad news is out on the table. We believe the problems
are manageable and fixable.''
   She said most of the past problems could have been avoided by
being more careful ``who you let in'' to various FHA programs.

   The House today voted to support President
Bush's capital gains tax cut, rejecting Democratic cries that it
was a giveaway to the rich.
   Culminating weeks of political struggle, the House defeated by a
vote of 239 to 190 a Democratic attempt to replace Bush's tax cut
with a plan to raise tax rates for the wealthy and restore
deductions for Individual Retirement Accounts.
   The vote left intact a proposal supported by the president which
would cut by 40 percent the maximum tax rate for earnings from
stocks, bonds, real estate, timber and other assets. A final vote
on the overall bill, which contains many other unrelated budget
provisions and issues, isn't expected until next week.
   The capital gains reduction was supported by 175 Republicans and
64 Democrats and opposed by 189 Democrats and one Republican, Doug
Bereuter of Nebraska.
   Republicans and conservative Democrats who sided with the
president said the tax cut would be a tonic for the economy, and
they called the Democratic alternative a sign of a tax-and-spend
philosophy.
   ``I am very pleased by the bipartisan House vote which
represents a step forward for economic growth, new jobs and
American competitiveness,'' Bush said in a statement after the vote.
   ``A lower capital gains rate will reduce the cost of capital and
create incentives for investment in the long-term productive
capacity of American industry,'' the president said.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the minority whip, said the vote
showed the ``waning influence of the liberals in the Democratic
Party'' and predicted Bush would continue winning with the help of
Democratic conservatives.
   But House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he was ``proud
we took this position'' and said the Democratic schism on capital
gains was not something that extended to other issues.
   ``The Democratic leadership believes in redistributing the
wealth. The bipartisan coalition believes in creating wealth,''
said House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill. He decried the
``rancid rhetoric of class warfare'' being used against a proposal
which he said would mean ``more growth, more jobs, and help us all
be more competitive in an increasingly competitive world.''
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt argued that supporting
the Bush plan meant, ``You'll be voting to give $25,000 a year on
the average to ... the wealthiest families in America'' at a time
when the federal deficit was eroding the U.S. position in
international markets.
   The vote wasn't as close as both sides were predicting up until
the end. Although Republicans were confident they took steps to
make sure _ Rep. James Courter, R-N.J., was called by the White
House 8-10 times late Wednesday to make sure he took a break from
his gubernatorial campaign to vote.
   In advance of the vote, each side was accusing the other of
unseemly arm-twisting.
   ``We know there's just been unmerciful kind of pressure brought
to bear on the Democratic side against their members'' who were
inclined to side with Bush, Michel said.
   ``I suspect it (Michel's comment) is a suggestion made to
cover'' Republican tactics of that sort, countered Foley.
``Obviously, the president is using every means at his disposal,
including ... inducements to members of various unstated kinds.''
   With the president's blessing, the House Ways and Means
Committee put into the huge, 2,000-page budget bill a provision
cutting the maximum capital gains tax rate from 33 percent to 19.6
percent for the next 27 months. After that, the rate would go to 28
percent but profits attributed to inflation would not be taxed.
   Foley and the House Democratic leadership took a stand against
the tax break, citing statistics which show the overwhelming
majority of the benefits would go to people earning over $100,000 a
year.
   Their proposal included a tax increase for the wealthy,
increasing their marginal tax rates from 28 percent to 33 percent
so it would be the same as for upper-middle-class taxpayers. The
revenue would be used to cut the deficit and restore universal tax
deductions for Individual Retirement Accounts.
   The Democrats also included a small cut in the top capital gains
rate, from 33 percent to 28 percent.
   Although the tax increase would apply only to the 600,000
wealthiest taxpayers in the nation _ mostly people earning more
than $150,000 a year _ Bush threatened a veto and Republicans
gleefully attacked the Democratic plan.
   ``Tax, tax, tax, tax, tax, tax, tax, tax, tax, tax, tax, tax,
tax, tax, tax, tax... '' said Rep. Paul Henry, R-Mich., repeated
for a minute in a speech before the House on Wednesday.
   Foley said a Democratic loss in the House would not put Bush on
a sure track toward victory.
   ``The Senate leadership feels as strongly as our leadership
does, that this capital gains proposal is a detriment to the budget
process, unfair, and an inequitable proposal. Bad tax policy,''
Foley said.
   ``If we had more time, there's no question in my mind we'd be
winning big,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., who helped Foley
lobby for the package.
   The capital gains provision is just one of many controversies on
the budget bill, and the House is expected to vote next week on
federally subsidized child care and the catastrophic illness
insurance plan.
   On the catastrophic illness issue, the House will choose between
restructuring the tax program which has drawn ire from the elderly,
sharply scaling back the program in order to repeal the income
surtax, or to kill the program entirely.
   On Wednesday, the House voted pro-business on a pair of issues
generating controversy in that community.
   By a vote of 250-173, it killed a provision in the bill which
would have given workers representation on the boards of
company-financed pension plans.
   Then, by a 390-36 margin, it voted to repeal a 1986 provision
that prohibits employers from claiming tax deductions for health
plans that discriminate against lower-paid workers.

<HEAD>Gillette Agrees to Pull Cancer-Causing Ingredient</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The makers of Liquid Paper agreed
today to remove a cancer-causing ingredient and pay $300,000 in
penalties and costs to settle a legal action brought by
environmentalists.
   The settlement, filed in Superior Court, was prompted by
complaints that Gillette Co. was exposing users to a cancer-causing
chemical in the typewriter correction fluid without the warning
required by Proposition 65.
   That measure, passed by voters in 1986, requires products
containing chemicals known to cause cancer or reproductive harm to
carry warnings.
   Under the settlement, Liquid Paper products will contain no
trichloroethylene, or TCE, within four months.
   The company agreed to pay a $275,000 penalty and $25,000 in fees
and costs. The penalty will rise to $1 million if the deadline is
not met.
   The company will run advertisements about the chemicals and
non-toxic alternatives, such as Liquid Paper Mistake Out and Liquid
Paper Just for Copies. The ads will also tell consumers they can
exchange their Liquid Paper for the non-toxic alternatives.
   TCE makes Liquid Paper dry faster.
   David Roe of the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the authors
of Proposition 65, praised Gillette for acting ``very quickly and
responsibly in finding a new way to make these products that avoids
Proposition 65 chemicals.''

<HEAD>Corn Futures Gain On Talk Of Soviet Interest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices gained Thursday
on the Chicago Board of Trade, led by a late surge in the corn
market amid rumors the Soviet Union was seeking to buy as much as 3
million metric tons of U.S. corn or sorghum.
   Analysts also cited talk that the Soviets recently purchased
grain from Canada and soybean meal from South America after
indicating earlier this month that they would import no more grain
this year.
   The markets found further support in other grain-export news,
including a sale of 400,000 metric tons of U.S. corn to Mexico and
a Chinese bid for 400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices.
   The sudden wave of foreign demand is a sharp contrast to the
slow export activity of recent weeks.
   ``Compared to last week, this is a mega-increase,'' said William
Biedermann, director of research with Allendale Inc., a futures
brokerage in Crystal Lake, Ill.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent to } cent higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $3.99\ a bushel; corn was
1} cents to 5{ cents higher with December at $2.34 a bushel; oats
were 1\ cents to 2 cents higher with December at $1.45} a bushel;
soybeans were 3 cents to 6\ cents higher with November at $5.70{ a

<HEAD>OPEC Takes First Step Toward Solving Tough Quota Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC ministers failed to end a nasty fight over
how to divide up oil-market shares, but made some headway in laying
the groundwork for the cartel's scheduled meeting in November,
analysts said Thursday.
   ``It was a very important meeting,'' said Joseph Stanislaw,
managing director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris.
``Questions they didn't want to face at least got put on the table
for consideration.''
   One eleventh-hour proposal by Iran to revamp existing quotas,
for example, was viewed by many as having sufficient merit to
warrant further discussion at the upcoming meeting, scheduled for
Nov. 25 in Vienna.
   ``It opened a possible avenue for solving the quota problem,''
said OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister.
   Bahman Karbassioun, an oil consultant based in Vienna, called
the plan a first step.
   ``They have a much better chance of getting somewhere in
November,'' he said.
   The ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries ended five days of sometimes acrimonious
discussions Wednesday by agreeing to increase their supply ceiling
a modest amount in the fourth quarter.
   In the absence of a consensus on how to carve up OPEC's
production share to please all the countries, a plan was announced
to simply bump up the supply ceiling from 19.5 million barrels a
day to 20.5 million barrels in the October-December period.
   Analysts said the decision, aimed at lifting prices of OPEC
crude about a dollar to their target of $18 a barrel, simply
legitimized part of the 22.5 million barrels a day the cartel is
believed to be producing already. It also more accurately reflects
the rising world demand for OPEC oil.
   However, the meeting was sufficiently divisive that a final
statement, normally given at the close of OPEC meetings, was not
issued.
   ``They didn't release a communique because not all of the
ministers would sign one,'' said Rick Donovan, head of global
energy for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   More importantly, the ministers held serious discussions about
ways to divvy up their oil production shares to everyone's
satisfaction, according to some analysts.
   ``It was a surprise the ministers actually got into a lot of
issues they did,'' said Stanislaw.
   Iran unveiled its proposal on Tuesday, four days after the
meeting began and ministers extended their stay in Geneva to
examine it. The plan would raise OPEC's output cap to 21.5 million
barrels a day to meet the demands primarily of Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates for bigger production shares.
   The two countries have been openly ignoring their assigned
quotas in an effort to press their demands for a redistribution of
their individual supply quotas. Kuwait's quota is 1.09 million
barrels and the U.A.E.'s is 1.04 million but both are believed to
be producing about twice their allotment.
   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh, speaking to reporters
through a translator, said his plan ``would be a basis to solve the
problems of OPEC _ hopefully for good.''
   ``Everyone was taken with it,'' said John Lichtblau of the
Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. ``There's a lot
of momentum behind it.''
   Aqazadeh said his plan was designed to meet the dual requests of
big producers in the Persian Gulf to produce more and those of
smaller ones for higher prices.
   ``The large producing countries ... could guarantee some sort of
price for the others,'' he said.
   In exchange, the smaller producers, who complain that
overproduction hurts prices, would give up some of their output
shares to the bigger ones.
   Specifically, the plan called for a marked increase in the
production slices of Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Gabon and
Ecuador. The shares of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Libya would stay the
same.
   Iran and Iraq would lose a bit, and Algeria, Nigeria, Indonesia
and Venezuela would lose more.
   Libya opposed the plan because it wants the same share as Kuwait.
   Analysts predict oil prices will hold relatively steady or
weaken slightly in the next few months. Gasoline prices at the pump
could slip, depending on the cartel's production pattern, but the
new ceiling is not likely to affect actual output, they said.
   The November meeting is designed to plot production strategy for
1990.
   ``Our hope is that in the meantime nobody does anything silly to
upset the good atmosphere which we have now,'' said Lukman.
   If tempers don't flare, he said, ``we'll be in a good mood to
finalize it.''

<HEAD>Braniff Passengers Seek Alternate Flights; Employees Ponder Fate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY JORDEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GRAPEVINE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shocked Braniff passengers scrambled
Thursday for alternate flights while airline employees worried
about their future following the company's second filing for
bankruptcy protection in seven years.
   Only one flight was scheduled Thursday evening between Braniff
Inc.'s major Kansas City, Mo., hub and Dallas after the company
sought protection from creditors to allow it to reorganize under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   ``I have flown them so often before and my daughter sent me
these tickets,'' said Marcia Mack of New York City. ``I was so
shocked. I have always enjoyed flying Braniff.''
   She was among dozens of worried passengers who waited at
Braniff's ticket counters when its concourse at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport opened at 6 a.m. CDT.
   In Kansas City, city convention planners were struggling to
arrange transportation for delegates from two conventions in town,
and for about 1,200 delegates expected next week for a convention
of the Society of Broadcast Engineers.
   The city may have trouble attracting future conventions if
convenient air travel is not available. Officials of other airlines
said it was too early to tell if they would increase their flights
from Kansas City International Airport.
   Meanwhile, some employees were confident that Braniff, which
laid off 2,700 workers, could rebuild as a smaller carrier.
   Braniff filed for bankruptcy protection at 2 a.m. EDT in
Orlando, its home base, only hours after it canceled flights
through Orlando and the Kansas City hub. Rumors of a bankruptcy
filing drove the airline's stock price down earlier on Wednesday.
   ``We knew there was some financial trouble. But we didn't
realize the severity of it,'' said Chuck Skinner, a Braniff agent
who went through the airline's first Chapter 11 proceeding in 1982.
``The (latest filing) really surprised us.''
   However, he predicted Braniff would return, probably as a much
smaller carrier.
   ``I am sure we will end up flying out of this one,'' said
Skinner.
   Braniff will schedule three daily flights out of Dallas
beginning Monday, ``presumably'' to Kansas City, said Al Van Klies,
one of five Braniff agents processing tickets at Dallas-Fort Worth
Airport.
   Employees hadn't yet been told about staffing at the airport.
   ``I think the older people here will still have a job,'' Van
Klies said.
   The agent, who worked at Braniff during its first
reorganization, expected that the second would be similar.
   ``Today, we're just booking people on different flights,'' he
said as he scheduled a passenger on Dallas-based American Airlines.
   Cliff Baker of Plainfield, N.J., whose ticket was honored by
American, said he and his wife Ann were returning from a three-week
vacation when Braniff unexpectedly filed for bankruptcy protection.
   ``We heard about it last night on the news. One guy at our hotel
was trying all night to get Braniff and finally did about 3 a.m.
They told us to come out and get rescheduled and we did,'' he said.
   Baker said he has been a loyal Braniff customer since 1958, when
he rode the carrier out of San Antonio, Texas, during tours at
Lackland and Brooks Air Force bases.
   ``They are a great airline,'' Baker, 49, said. ``I hope they
come back.''
   Lou Antabades of Grand Prairie, Texas, another passenger, said
he had a premonition as he bought a special Braniff ticket to watch
the fall leaves turn colors in the Rocky Mountains.
   ``When they offered the $149 round-trip fair to Denver, my first
images were the TV screens at the airport showing all flights had
been canceled, like they had during the first bankruptcy
reorganization,'' said Antabades. ``But I said, no, that won't
happen again.''

   Stock prices rallied today in buying encouraged
by the market's recent resilience in the face of negative news.
   In Wednesday's trading the market was confronted with a drop in
the dollar, higher interest rates, and word from International
Business Machines that its third-quarter earnings would fall well
short of analysts' estimates.
   But stocks bounced back from an early decline to finish mixed,
impressing many observers.
   If that combination of events failed to send prices lower,
traders reasoned, the market might be ready for a rally.
   Meanwhile, interest rates levelled off in the credit markets,
showing little change in today's trading.

<HEAD>Former Braniff Chief: Management Changes Triggered Latest Chapter
11</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Braniff, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former head of Braniff Inc., who piloted
the airline through bankruptcy court seven years ago, on Thursday
blamed changes by subsequent management for landing the company
back in Chapter 11.
   ``You could see it coming,'' Howard D. Putnam, Braniff's former
chief executive, said in an interview.
   ``They took on a lot of debt,'' he said. ``They began a gigantic
expansion in Kansas City, and they began to lose money. They had
been known as a low-fare airline and became a high-fare airline.
They got out of their niche.''
   Putnam said he tried to remake Braniff in the style of Southwest
Airlines Co., a Dallas airline he led as president. Southwest
stressed high employee productivity, high utilization of planes,
low fares and high quality service.
   Chicago businessman and hotelier Jay Pritzker bought Braniff in
1983 as it was emerging from bankruptcy court and altered that
strategy, Putnam said. Pritzker sold the Orlando, Fla.-based
airline in 1988 to investors led by Jeffrey Chodorow of
Philadelphia.
   ``They in turn brought in new senior management,'' Putnam said.
``Some of the management were from Piedmont (Airlines), which is in
a different part of the country with little competition and higher
rates.
   ``They had first class, and it seems logical, I'm assuming, to
management that since it worked back there it should work for
Braniff,'' he said.
   But Braniff early Thursday filed for protection from creditors
under federal brankruptcy laws, off 2,700 employees and sharply
reduced its flying schedule.
   The airline said that while it believes assets have
``substantial value,'' it was suffering a liquidity problem because
of delays in completing recently announced financing and a dropoff
in airline traffic in recent months.
   Putnam, who was in town to address University of Pittsburgh
graduate business students on ethics, said Braniff now must
``restructure their way out of it.''
   ``The saddest part about Braniff is the employees,'' Putnam
said. ``When we reorganized, the employees took wage cuts of 40 to
50 percent for five years in order for the company to come back.
They've done their part.''
   Upon filing under Chapter 11 in May 1982, Braniff suspended
operations, laying off about 10,000 employees and leaving only 225
on the job, he said. Within two weeks, the company also laid off 22
vice presidents and eliminated two levels of management.
   A bankruptcy judge gave the company permission to dissolve its
labor contracts and seek concessions from workers. Putnam said the
pay cuts were easier to achieve because the employees were laid off.
   ``I had no problems with that ethically ... because we were
already in (Chapter) 11 and the only way we could come out is if we
had some more productive labor rates,'' he said.
   ``I got them to understand that I was their last hope,'' Putnam
added. ``I didn't tell them I was going to cut their salaries any
more. I just said we needed more productivity.''

<HEAD>Du Pont, Merck Form Partnership in Drug Development</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drugmaker Merck &amp; Co. will let Du Pont Co.
market two of its drugs in exchange for a chance to help Du Pont
develop and sell a new class of potential high blood pressure
medicines.
   The unusual arrangement announced by both companies on Thursday
grants Merck access to Du Pont's new development, while giving Du
Pont the expertise Merck has in research and shepherding drugs to
market. The pact also fills a void in E.I. Du Pont de Nemours and
Co.'s drug pipeline.
   ``It's trading current products for future products,'' said
David Bartash, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The pairing off comes during a time of increasing global
consolidation in the pharmaceutical world as drug makers merge or
join forces to sell products.
   Du Pont is seeking to expand in pharmaceuticals, and Bartash
said it may have entered into the pact to speed up the process.
   ``They've been spending money for a long time (on drug
development) and they haven't got a whole lot to show for it,'' he
said.
   Pharmaceutical revenue last year accounted for about 1 percent
of the revenue of Wilmington, Del.-based Du Pont, or $350 million
out of its $32.9 billion in sales.
   The agreement calls for Merck to take the lead in developing one
of Du Pont's most promising drug discoveries, blockers that
interfere with a hormone that induces high blood pressure.
   The companies will share revenues from such a drug, which Merck
spokesman John Doorley said could be introduced in the mid-1990s.
   In the deal's other aspect, Merck said it would turn over
exclusive North American marketing rights to Du Pont for Sinemet, a
major treatment for Parkinson's disease. Sales of the drug,
introduced last year, exceeded $100 million.
   Rahway-based Merck's total revenues for the year were $5.94
billion, leading to earnings of $1.2 billion.
   Du Pont will also assume marketing of Vaseretic, called
Co-Renitec in some European countries, a high-blood pressure
medicine that Merck introduced in 1987. Vaseretic is a combination
of Merck's popular Vasotec and its diuretic HydroDiuril.
   Merck said the arrangement will allow it to focus marketing
energies on other products.
   Marketing collaborations between drug makers are frequent, but
more usually involve one company helping sell another's drug,
rather than turning over the entire marketing task, said Du Pont
spokesman Roger Morris.
   ``You're trying to leverage new projects with as many sales
people as you can,'' said Louis C. Webb, an analyst with Advest
Inc. of Hartford, Conn.
   The exchange of existing drugs for access to research is also
unusual, analysts said.
   Merck will receive an undisclosed percentage of the proceeds
from Vaseretic and Sinemet.
   Morris said Du Pont wanted Sinemet because it already had
experience selling a Parkinson's drug, and liked Vaseretic because
the company was interested in expanding its cardiology line. Both
are generating rising sales, falling between a number of ``mature''
Du Pont drugs with expired patents and others far from hitting the
market, said Morris.
   Together, the companies will work on a new class of high blood
pressure drugs called angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
   Angiotensin II, or AII, is a blood pressure hormone that binds
to ``receptor sites'' on blood cells and tissue. The antagonists
reach the sites first, blocking the hormone and keeping blood
pressure down.
   The companies said the treatment is particularly safe because it
acts on a very specific part of body chemistry. The compounds are
in human test trials, said the companies.
   Morris said that with Merck's participation, a drug could be on
the market about two years sooner.
   Merck, known for its strong research department, also gains.
   ``They're smart enough to know they can't discover everything,''
said Bartash. But he said a previous similar arrangement with the
British Imperial Chemical Industries has yet to produce fruit.
   Merck in 1986 allowed ICI to share marketing of a high blood
pressure drug in exchange for co-development of a compound to treat
diabetes side effects. Merck spokesman Don Burkat said the drug was
still in development.

<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 468 money market mutual
funds rose by $191.6 million in the latest week to a new all-time
high of $349.23 billion, the Investment Company Institute said
Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday, followed a
revised $1.36 billion increase in the funds' assets the previous
week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade group.
   The previous record high was the revised $349.04 billion in the
week ended Sept. 20. The latest week's total represents the 13th
consecutive week that a new high has been reached.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 231 general purpose funds rose $199.1 million to $113.40
billion, assets of 96 broker-dealer funds rose $446.1 million to
$152.07 billion, and assets of 141 institutional funds fell $453.6
million to $83.76 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds in the
week ended Tuesday was 8.26 percent, unchanged from the previous
week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield also was unchanged at 8.26 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
37 days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
6.43 percent as of Wednesday from 6.44 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.10 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.26
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.24 percent
the previous week. Yields were 8.31 percent on 1-year CDs, up from
8.29 percent; 8.24 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.21 percent;
and 8.23 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.21 percent.

   The stock market chalked up its best gain in
five weeks Thursday in an advance led by environmental,
pharmaceutical and other ``growth'' issues.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 21.85 to
2,694.91, for its best showing since it jumped 56.53 points on Aug.
24.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
918 up, 536 down and 503 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 164.24 million
shares, against 158.40 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 196.73 million shares.
   In Wednesday's trading the market was confronted with a drop in
the dollar, higher interest rates, and word from International
Business Machines that its third-quarter earnings would fall well
short of analysts' estimates.
   But stocks bounced back from an early decline to finish mixed,
impressing many observers.
   If that combination of events failed to send prices lower,
traders evidently reasoned, the market might be ready for a rally.
   The advance was ``very selective,'' however, said Larry Wachtel,
analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. ``The theme for the day was
`out of earnings uncertainty and into earnings certainty.'''
   That meant, he said, a flow of money from technology stocks and
other sectors that have lately produced earnings disappointments,
to groups like the drug and pollution-control stocks regarded as
holding out the promise of steady growth.
   IBM shares, down 6 on Wednesday, dropped another 2{ to 109 as
the most active Big Board issue. Digital Equipment lost 1} to 91~
and Hewlett-Packard was down ~ at 50].
   In the pollution-control sector, by contrast, Waste Management,
up 2| at 65}; Wheelabrator Technologies, up 2{ at 41], and
Browning-Ferris, up 1] at 41], all hit new highs.
   Gainers among the pharmaceuticals included Abbott Laboratories,
up 1~ at 64, and Pfizer, up 1 at 68]. Investors also bid up
consumer growth issues such as Philip Morris, up 4{ at 165, and
Procter &amp; Gamble, up 3{ at 120}.
   AVX jumped 8 to 29|. The company agreed to be acquired by
Japan's Kyocera Corp. through an exchange of stock. Kyocera's
American depositary shares rose [ to 80|.
   L.A. Gear dropped 1~ to 43\. The company reported sharply higher
profits for its latest fiscal quarter, but some traders evidently
took profits on that widely anticipated news.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $29.61 billion, or
0.87 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.73 to 193.55.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.93 to 397.81, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 3.50 at 348.60.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
3.37 to 471.14. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 385.75, up 2.71.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. corn stockpile on Sept. 1 was about
1.93 billion bushels, less than half of what it was a year earlier,
according to a quarterly report released Thursday by the
Agriculture Department.
   But the Sept. 1 corn stockpile, which represented ``old crop''
grain harvested in previous years, was about 75 million bushels
more than had been forecast in USDA supply-and-demand figures
issued earlier this month.
   The old-crop soybean supply carried over on Sept. 1 into the new
marketing year and was estimated at 182 million bushels, about 27
million bushels more than forecast earlier. Even so, the Sept. 1
inventory was down 40 percent from a year earlier, the report read.
   Old crop sorghum was estimated at 438 million bushels as of
Sept. 1, about in line with the 425 million bushels forecast on
Sept. 12 but down 34 percent from inventories of a year ago.
   The marketing years for corn, soybeans and sorghum begin Sept. 1
and run through the following Aug. 31. Wheat and barley marketing
years commence on June 1.
   Wheat inventories as of Sept. 1 totaled 1.91 billion bushels,
down 15 percent from a year earlier, and barley stocks at 418
million bushels were down 7 percent.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Surge On Rumored Soviet Interest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn futures prices rose sharply Thursday on the Chicago Board
of Trade, leading other grain and soybean futures higher on
speculation that the Soviet Union was shopping for up to 3 million
metric tons of U.S. corn.
   On other commodity markets, energy futures rose, precious metals
advanced slightly, and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Corn settled 1} cents to 5{ cents higher with the contract for
delivery in December at $2.33} a bushel. Wheat futures were \ cent
to 1 cent higher with December at $3.99{ a bushel; oats were 1\
cents to 1{ cents higher with December at $1.45} a bushel; and
soybeans were 3 cents to 6 cents higher with November at $5.70{ a
bushel.
   The rumors of buying interest conflicted with recent Soviet
statements that the Soviets would not import any more grain in
1989. But market analysts said those statements probably were a
ruse to drive prices lower.
   ``They know how to play the game,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain
analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   ``Ask the Soviets if they're going to buy corn, they'll say no,
the price goes down 2 cents and then they'll buy it.''
   Supporting the rumors were indications the Soviets recently
purchased grain from Canada and soybean meal from South America.
   The markets also were boosted by other grain-export news,
including confirmed sales of 106,000 metric tons of U.S. corn to
Mexico and 215,000 metric tons of U.S. corn to Japan, plus a
Chinese bid for 400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices.
   The sudden wave of foreign demand is a sharp contrast to the
slow export activity of recent weeks.
   ``Compared to last week, this is a mega-increase,'' said William
Biedermann, director of research with Allendale Inc., a futures
brokerage in Crystal Lake, Ill.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department released its
quarterly grain-stocks report, which indicated corn and soybean
supplies were larger and wheat supplies smaller than the market had
expected.
   The USDA estimated soybean stocks as of Sept. 1 at 182 million
bushels, compared to trade estimates averaging 159 million and
year-ago stocks of 302 million.
   Corn stocks as of Sept. 1 were estimated at 1.93 billion bushels
compared to trade estimates averaging 1.89 billion and year-ago
stocks of 4.26 billion.
   The USDA projected wheat stocks for June 1, 1990, at 1.91
billion bushels, essentially unchanged from a year ago, compared to
trade estimates averaging 1.99 billion.
   Energy futures prices rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
paced by sharp gains in the October gasoline contract linked to
position-squaring ahead of the contract's expiration on Friday.
   Some of the buying also came in reaction to OPEC's agreement to
raise its fourth-quarter crude oil production ceiling to 20.5
million barrels from 19.5 million.
   ``It seems to me that those writing OPEC off yesterday
recognized today they made a fair amount of progress in recognizing
what their objectives ought to be,'' said Robert Baker, energy
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 27 cents
higher with November at $19.86 a barrel; heating oil was .38 cent
lower to .40 cent higher with October at 58.86 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .20 cent to 2.19 cents higher with October at
60.93 cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures edged higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange in lackluster trading.
   Gold settled 20 cents to 70 cents higher with October at $368.10
a troy ounce; silver was 1 cent to 1.5 cents higher with October at
$5.265 a troy ounce.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle futures settled
.05 cent lower to .35 cent higher with October at 72.05 cents a
pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower to .20 cent higher with
September at 83.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent lower to
.25 cent higher with October at 43.42 cents a pound; and frozen
pork bellies were unchanged to .75 cent higher with February at
48.90 cents a pound.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the broadest measures of the nation's
money supply rose and another fell in the week ended Sept. 18, the
Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,158.2 billion from an adjusted $3,154.3 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,017.8 billion from $4,018.3 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $780.8 billion from $782.6 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 3.9 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.7 percent, within the Fed's
target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not set a
target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,127.8 billion, a 6.4
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,004.8 billion, up 4.6 percent, while M1
fell 0.1 percent to an average of $777.1 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $647 million in
the week ended Sept. 20.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $794 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$725 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged a revised
$333 million in the two weeks ended Sept. 20, down from a revised
$464 million in the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $293.5 billion in the two-week period ended
Sept. 20, up from $289.8 billion two weeks earlier.

   The dollar moved mostly higher Thursday although
central banks again put pressure on the currency, acting on a
belief that the dollar's advance this year could have unpleasant
economic consequences.
   Gold bullion prices finished with minor changes in the United
States after moving lower overseas. The Republic National Bank of
New York quoted a bid of $366.90 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m.
EDT, up 70 cents from Wednesday's late bid.
   John McCarthy, chief currency dealer at the New York office of
the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank, said trading volume was moderate and
punctuated by rounds of central bank intervention.
   Activity has slackened in recent days with dealers unwinding
positions as the month ends. Trading maneuvers tied to the close of
Japan's fiscal year on Sept. 30 also has reduced liquidity in the
currency markets, he said.
   ``The central banks intervened three or four times,'' said
McCarthy. ``It did have the desired effect _ the dollar is closing
lower than where it opened in New York'' but above Wednesday's late
levels.
   Finance leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries have
resolved to keep a tight leash on the dollar.
   They agreed at a weekend meeting in Washington that the dollar's
rise this year threatened to bungle the delicate balance of
economic growth among major trading partners. The G-7 countries are
the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and
Italy.
   In earlier European trading, the dollar rose against most major
currencies despite persistent dollar selling by the monetary
authorities.

   Energy futures prices rose in moderate trading
Thursday, reflecting general optimism that OPEC's latest accord
would not mean higher oil production or weaker prices.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries concluded a
five-day meeting on Wednesday by increasing its stated production
ceiling to 20.5 million barrels a day from 19.5 million.
   Analysts said the higher quota more accurately reflects the
demand for OPEC oil and should help maintain relatively stable
prices through the fourth quarter without raising actual production.
   ``Although there is disappointment in the outcome, people
realize that demand is still running at a high level,'' said Tom
Bentz, director of futures trading at United Energy Inc.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, rose 27
cents to finish at $19.86 a 42-gallon barrel. The contract gained 6
cents in Wednesday's session.
   Among refined products, unleaded gasoline for October delivery
jumped 2.19 cents to close at 60.93 cents a gallon. Analysts said
last-minute buying the day before trading on the contract expires
helped boost prices. The November contract rose 1.05 cents to 57.96
cents a gallon and other contracts posted much smaller gains.
   Heating oil for October delivery rose 0.40 cent to settle at
58.86 cents a gallon, and the contract for November delivery gained
0.30 cent to 59.20 cents.
   ``The feeling in the market right now is that OPEC made strides
in trying to hammer out something. It sets a good groundwork for
the Nov. 21 meeting,'' said Linda Simard, energy broker at Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   ``Crude prices should hold fairly steady between now and the
meeting,'' she said.
   OPEC is scheduled to meet in Vienna in November to map out
strategy for 1990. Observers say the oil group may be in a better
position after the current session to deal with the quota issue.
   Although OPEC raised its official ceiling, it remains under the
cartel's actual production, estimated by various industry sources
at about 22.5 million barrels a day. Analysts said they expect the
cartel to raise the figure to a more realistic level at the
November conference.

<DATELINE>RANDOLPH, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dunkin' Donuts officials say they are
looking more closely at a merger offer from a Canadian partnership
after rejecting a bid by the same group earlier this month.
   The international doughnut chain is also considering other
alternatives, including a leveraged buyout or selling the company
to a third party.
   In a letter sent Monday to the chain's 1,108 franchisees, Robert
M. Rosenberg, chairman and chief executive officer, wrote that
Dunkin' Donuts management met Sept. 19 with representatives of DD
Acquisition Corp., which had made a bid for the company in August.
   DD Acquisition Corp. is a partnership between Cara Operations
Ltd., a restaurant franchise company, and Kingsbridge Capital
group, the merchant banking arm of Toronto investor George Mann's
Unicorp Canada Corp.
   The letter said DD's increased cash offer of $45 a share, or
$308 million, along with its willingness to drop most conditions
previously imposed in the deal, had prompted the meeting.
   DD Acquisition raised its offer late last month from $43, but
Dunkin' Donuts announced two weeks ago that it would reject the
higher offer.
   DD had filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court challenging a
serious of tough anti-takeover defenses Dunkin' Donuts had
implemented. Rosenberg's letter said that DD had agreed to drop its
suit and its challenge of all measures except a ``poison-pill''
plan Dunkin' Donuts had implemented.
   The poison pill increases the number of shares in the event of a
takeover, making a merger prohibitively expensive.
   The letter said DD Acquisition had extended its tender offer to
Nov. 1.
   Rosenberg also wrote that Dunkin' Donuts was meeting with other
possible buyers, and also might consider a leveraged buyout plan.
In a leveraged buyout, the asset value of a company is used to
finance most or all of the debt.
   ``Whether or not an LBO might be pursued and might be in the
best interests of the stockholders has not yet been determined,''
the letter read. ``But the possibility of financial support from
franchise owners is likely to play an important role in our
evaluation of the LBO alternative.''
   Company officials would not comment on the letter.
   Dunkin' Donuts reported a 34 percent drop in third-quarter
earnings, much of which it attributed to costs associated with
battling the hostile takeover.

<HEAD>Big HMO To Raise Rates 17 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kaiser Permanente of Southern
California, a health maintenance organization with 2 million
members, said Thursday it will raise rates by about 17{ percent
next year.
   The monthly cost of the average individual premium will rise
from $89.90 a month to $104.99 a month, spokeswoman Janice Seib
said. Family plans with two members are twice that amount, or
$209.98; for three or more, $297.33 per month.
   Ms. Seib said tyhe increase was the largest in the last five
years. She blamed rising medical costs, the need to add doctors and
staff, big increases in membership that have strained the company,
and the fact that ``our membership is aging.''
   HMOs offer members medical care for a prepaid, fixed price,
rather than on a pay-per-visit basis.
   On Tuesday, Kaiser Permanente of Northern California said it
would hike rates 19.6 percent next year.
   Kaiser, a non-profit medical institute, is the nation's largest
HMO. It operates nine medical centers and a mental health center in
Southern California.
   James Doherty, president of the Group Health Association of
America, a Washington D.C.-based trade group for HMOs, said many of
the groups have lost money in recent years as premium increases
have failed to keep pace with the rising costs of providing service.
   A recent national survey of 650 HMOs by Group Health showed
individual premiums rose 11.8 percent and family premiums rose 11.6
percent from 1987 to 1988.
   The survey found the monthly national average for a family
contract was $226.89 in 1988 and $90.07 for an individual contract.

<HEAD>Gillette Removing Carcinogen From White-Out Fluids</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER KERR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The maker of Liquid Paper correction
fluid agreed Thursday to remove a cancer-causing ingredient and pay
$300,000 to settle a legal action brought by environmentalists.
   Under the agreement filed in San Francisco Superior Court,
Gillette Co. can continue to sell Liquid Paper containing the
carcinogen until March 1, 1990, but must allow customers to
exchange bottles for non-toxic alternatives.
   The settlement was prompted by complaints that Gillette was
exposing users to a cancer-causing chemical in the typewriter
correction fluid without the warning required by state law
Proposition 65.
   ``This is the way Proposition 65 was intended to work _ not
through endless legal battles, but by providing manufacturers with
a strong incentive to stop using toxic chemicals in their
products,'' California Attorney General John Van de Kamp said.
   Proposition 65, passed by voters in November 1986, requires
warnings on products that contain chemicals known to cause cancer
or reproductive harm.
   Van de Kamp said the case is the first in which a manufacturer
had changed its product to avoid being subject to a Proposition 65
enforcement action.
   Under the agreement, Boston-based Gillette does not admit any
violation and is reformulating some of its products ``to avoid
prolonged litigation and to eliminate further confusion and
controversy,'' said a statement issued by a public relations firm
representing the firm.
   ``The manufacturers of Liquid Paper are confident its products
pose no health risks to consumers and meet all federal government
safety standards,'' the statement said.
   Environmental groups earlier this month contended that Liquid
Paper, a ``white-out'' fluid used for correcting typing mistakes,
was not warning customers that some products contain
trichloroethylene, or TCE, and lead. TCE is on the state's
Proposition 65 list as a carcinogen and lead as a reproductive
toxin.
   The groups noted that not only don't Liquid Paper bottles
contain a warning, but they also say, ``Non-Hazardous When Used as
Directed.''
   The firm was relying on a toll-free 800-number posted in stores
that consumers could call to get information on the product.
   Van de Kamp said only two persons received the Liquid Paper
warning message by making calls in the first year of the 800
number. A Sacramento County Superior Court judge last month ruled
the 800 number was an inadequate warning system, but an industry
group is appealing the decision.
   The agreement pertains to the following Liquid Paper correction
fluids: Bond White, Stock Colors, Thinner, Pen and Ink, Special
Match and Paper Mate Office Products.
   Gillette said it would place newspaper advertisements around
California informing consumers the products contain the chemical
and they can exchange bottles for some non-toxic alternative
products. The water-based substitutes are Liquid Paper Just for
Copies Opaquing Fluid and Liquid Paper Mistake Out.
   Gillette also will pay the state $275,000 in civil penalties and
$25,000 in attorneys' fees and costs, which go to the
environmentalist groups that brought the complaint.
   If the company manufactures the carcinogen-containing product
after next Feb. 1 or sells it after March 1 it will have to pay an
additional $50,000 a month in penalties, to a maximum of $1 million.
   David Roe of Environmental Defense Fund praised Gillette for
acting ``very quickly and responsibly in finding a new way to make
these products that avoids Proposition 65 chemicals.''
   ``This sets a precedent for getting casual carcinogens out of
our daily lives,'' Roe said.

<HEAD>Agreement Allows TVA to Refinance Old Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tennessee Valley Authority received
assurances Thursday it could implement plans to save $100 million
in annual interest costs by refinancing old, long-term debts
without jeopardizing access to short-term federal loans.
   The U.S. Treasury agreed to give the giant utility a two-year,
$2 billion line of credit from the Federal Financing Bank while it
attempts to refinance $6.7 billion in high-interest FFB loans
through the public markets.
   The deal permits TVA ``to go after the very large savings that
we've been trying to achieve the past four months through our
refinancing,'' said William Malec, TVA's chief financial officer.
   U.S. Rep. Don Sundquist, R-Tenn., said the agreement was reached
Thursday after discussions between federal regulators in Washington
and TVA Chairman Marvin Runyon.
   Malec said TVA planned to go to market with its first debt
refinancing issue _ at least $1 billion of the $6.7 billion _ in
the second week of October and expected to have the remainder
refinanced over the next six months.
   TVA's objective is to cut its annual operating expenses by
reducing the interest costs on its long-term debt. The average
interest rate on the $6.7 billion TVA wants to refinance is 12.25
percent. TVA believes it can secure rates of around 9 percent from
public credit markets.
   Debt interest represents TVA's single largest annual expense _
currently $1.8 billion a year or 34 cents for every dollar needed
to operate the power system.
   By refinancing the $6.7 billion in old debt at lower interest
rates, the TVA expects to save $100 million a year.
   Treasury officials suggested in May that TVA go to Wall Street
to refinance its old FFB loans, but last month said if the utility
proceeded with the plan it would prohibit TVA from seeking
long-term loans from the FFB in the future.
   The TVA did not want to lose this access, having borrowed $17.3
billion from the FFB since 1974.
   Malec said Thursday's agreement does not address new long-term
FFB borrowing, but does allow TVA to go to the FFB for up to $2
billion in short-term borrowing to meet operating obligations over
the next two years.
   TVA will lump any long-term financing needs into other public
bond issues through 1991, he said. At the end of the two-year
period, Treasury will review the agreement and decide whether it
again will offer long-term financing.

<HEAD>Trimming Dairy Business, Other Consolidations Planned</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 16th graf pvs, Borden stock... to UPDATE with closing stock

<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Borden Inc. Thursday announced a double-pronged
program that will cut its work force by about 15 percent and
substantially shrink its dairy business, symbolized for decades by
Elsie the cow.
   The program, which will mean the cutting of 7,000 jobs, comes
after several years of acquisitions, which added $3.1 billion to
Borden's annual sales.
   Under the plan announced at a New York news conference, Borden
will take a $571 million pre-tax charge against its third-quarter
income, resulting in a quarterly loss of $300 million to $305
million and a loss of $47 million to $58 million for the full year.
   The one-time charge, amounting to about $404 million after
taxes, will be used to consolidate Borden's six business lines. The
goal is to cut costs and boost pre-tax profit by some $340 million
through 1993.
   Borden _ which also is a leader in the pasta, wall coverings and
glue businesses _ also intends to pull out of overcrowded dairy
markets and concentrate on those where it has been doing well.
Borden says it will retain its ranking as the world's biggest dairy
business even after it reduces its operations by a third, or by
$700 million to $750 in annual sales.
   Romeo J. Ventres, Borden's chairman and chief executive officer,
said 65 of the company's 265 plants worldwide will be closed or
sold over the next two to three years.
   Ventres said the plants to be closed and the dairy markets to be
exited will be identified later. Borden's weaker markets generally
are in the East and Southeast and the stronger ones are in the
South and West, Ventres said.
   He said Borden would make every effort to sell the plants as
going concerns and local management will be given the first crack
at buying them.
   Borden's program will reduce its worldwide employment by about
7,000 from the present 46,000. Employees will be notified in
advance of closings and job retraining will be offered to anyone
wanting it, the company said.
   Twenty of the closings will involve dairy plants and branches to
be sold or closed in non-growth areas.
   Ventres said Borden will remain committed to dairy markets where
it enjoys strong growth.
   ``We're very committed to Elsie,'' he said. ``You may say
Elsie's gone on a little diet here ... but she'll be with us,''
Ventres said referring to the cow that has been a symbol for Borden
since she was introduced at the 1939 World's Fair in New York.
   Borden's exhibit depicted a dairy of the future featuring Elsie
in a barnyard boudoir. Her mate, Elmer the bull, made his debut at
the following year's fair and filled the job of ``spokesman'' for
Borden's adhesives.
   Outside of dairy, many of the planned closings will involve
smaller or older plants where production will be shifted to larger,
more modern ones.
   Securities analysts were unsurprised by Borden's restructuring
plans, given that the company had been on an ambitious acquisition
campaign. Borden has acquired 77 businesses since 1986, mostly in
the food and consumer products area, that added $3.1 billion to
annual sales.
   Borden stock rose $2.25 to $36.75 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Some analysts regard Borden as a hodgepodge of businesses that
might do better disengaged. In retrospect, a few analysts said,
Borden should have set aside money for consolidations while it was
on its buying spree.
   A typical Wall Street comment came from William Leach of
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Inc. He said: ``It's
definitely a good thing,'' but he added, ``I'm not jumping up and
down.''
   Ventres said the goal of the consolidation in dairy and its
other planned moves is to make Borden a low-cost producer in each
of its six main businesses by 1992.
   Borden says it is the world's leading producer in pasta, dairy,
wallcoverings and forest products adhesives. It claims to be No.2
in salty snacks.
   Some of Borden's best-known brands include Wise chips and
snacks, such as Cheez Doodles, Eagle Brand dairy products, Catelli
pasta and Classico tomato sauce. It also makes Elmer's Glue and
various paints and varnishes.

   Eastman Kodak Co. said Thursday it will
reorganize its health and information units in an effort to cut
costs and streamline operations.
   Officials said four Kodak units, including Sterling Drug, will
be brought together into a new health group. Other Kodak units in
the group will be Health Sciences, Clinical Products and Lehn &amp;
Fink Products.
   Two other new groups, Imaging Information Systems and Commercial

customer bases, Kodak President Kay R. Whitmore said.
   The reorganization ``is expected to produce some savings,''
Kodak spokesman Ron Roberts said, but did not elaborate.
   He said the reorganization did not involve any job cuts.
   Last month, Kodak announced it would reduce its workforce by
4,500 jobs worldwide, divest some businesses and change the way
workers and managers are paid. The announcement followed a 60
percent drop in profits in Kodak's second quarter.

<HEAD>Japanese Turning Cold Shoulder To Globex: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's government is trying to keep Japanese
companies from participating in a global futures trading network
being developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, according to
published reports.
   The Ministry of Finance fears that when the Merc's system,
called Globex, begins operating later this year, Japanese firms
will forsake Tokyo's fledgling futures markets to trade financial
futures on Globex, the Chicago Tribune reported Thursday.
   The Japanese news service Nikkei Telecom reported last week that
the ministry had persuaded Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking Co. to withdraw
its application to install Globex terminals.
   An employee at Mitsui's New York branch said no one was
available Thursday to comment on the reports.
   Chicago Merc spokeswoman Julie Jacobs said the exchange's
position had not changed since Friday, when spokesman Andrew Yemma
had denied any knowledge of the finance ministry's discouraging
Globex participation.
   ``Indeed, all our information is quite to the contrary,'' Yemma
said. ``It sounds like pure speculation.''
   Nick Ronalds, deputy managing director of the Merc's Tokyo
office, said the Merc had heard nothing official from the finance
ministry, which has been studying Globex for more than a year.
   ``We've provided them with all the information and we are still
waiting for their response,'' he said.
   Globex, designed to facilitate global, 24-hour futures trading,
would be weakened without the participation of the Japanese, who
opened their own futures markets in June.
   One of those markets, the Tokyo International Financial Futures
Exchange, offers Eurodollar futures, which are widely used by
institutional investors for hedging international investments.
   Eurodollar futures are the Merc's most popular product, and they
will likely be offered for trading on Globex.
   The Tribune quoted an unidentified Tokyo-based U.S. trade
official as saying the finance ministry's intervention represented
``another example of the mighty hammer of Japanese bureaucracy
crashing down on the concept of free trade.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government agency said Thursday that the
manufacturer of a popular over-the-counter diet aid used
``deceptive and unsubstantiated claims'' in advertisements
promoting the product's effectiveness.
   The makers of ``Fibre Trim'' tablets have no reasonable basis
for advertising claims that it is ``a proven, natural way to lose
weight,'' said the complaint filed by the Federal Trade Commission.
   The commission also challenged claims that the product offers
``all of fiber's wonderful health benefits'' and provides 2.35
grams of fiber in one serving.
   The panel voted 4-0 to issue the complaint, with chairwoman
Janet Steiger not voting. The FTC has set a Nov. 28 hearing date.
   Schering Corp., a subsidiary of Schering-Plough Corp., a major
national pharmaceutical manufacturer, is the U.S. distributor of
Fibre Trim.
   Fibre Trim, sold as a diet pill and fruit tablets to be
dissolved in water, is manufactured in Denmark.
   ``We believe the advertising for Fibre Trim was completely
truthful and properly substantiated,'' said Steve Galpin, a
Schering spokesman.
   Six strictly controlled studies in which some patients were
given placebos ``demonstrate the effectiveness of Fibre Trim,''
Galpin said.
   He also said there was ``an extensive body of scientific
literature showing that fiber can be used to help people lose
weight.''
   Schering ranked fifth among pharmaceutical companies with $2.1
billion in 1987 sales. Fibre Trim sales captured 12.9 percent of
the diet aids and meal replacements market in 1988, according to
Schering.
   The company also produces Maybelline cosmetics, Coppertone sun
care products and Dr. Scholl's foot care products.
   Galpin said the company will continue to promote, advertise and
sell Fibre Trim.

R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co., was elected chairman of the printing
company Thursday.
   Walter, 42, becomes one of the youngest chairmen of a Fortune
500 company. He has been with Donnelley, one of the nation's
largest printers, for 20 years.
   Walter succeeds John B. Schwemm, 55, who is retiring Nov. 1
after six years as chairman. Schwemm said in a statement the
succession was planned. He will continue to serve on the boards of
several Chicago-based companies.
   Donnelley is North America's largest printer of catalogs,
newspaper advertising inserts, magazines, books, directories,
computer documentation and financial documents.
   The company prints Business Week magazine and received national
attention earlier this year when eight of its employees resigned or
were fired in the wake of an insider-trading scandal.
   The employees were accused of supplying advance copies of the
magazine to stockbrokers and others, who then traded on companies
reported favorably in the ``Inside Wall Street'' column. Donnelley
was not charged with any wrongdoing.

   NWA Inc. said Thursday that chairman Steven
Rothmeier and four top executives have resigned, clearing the way
for Los Angeles investor Alfred Checchi to become chairman of the
parent of Northwest Airlines.
   Frederic Malek, a Washington, D.C. investment banker who helped
Checchi in the $3.65 billion buyout of the nation's fourth largest
carrier, will become president of Northwest, the airline said in a
statement.
   ``I suspect that Mr. Checchi was surprised by the resignations
but ... they were private discussions,'' NWA spokesman Alan
Muncaster told a news conference at the airline's headquarters. ``I
was surprised.''
   Muncaster said Checchi was informed Wednesday of the
resignations, which take effect Oct. 15. He said Checchi and Malek
will share the duties of chief executive officer, a post Rothmeier
had held alone.
   ``I don't know how long they've been thinking'' about resigning,
Muncaster said of Rothmeier and the other officers. ``I don't know
what their thought process was. I don't know if they really got
together and said `All right, we're all going to do this on the
same day.'''
   Muncaster said there were no indications Checchi's chairmanship
would be temporary. While conceding that Checchi and Malek have
never run an airline, Muncaster said they have extensive experience
in consumer, service-oriented businesses.
   Neither Checchi nor Rothmeier appeared at the news conference
and neither immediately could be reached for comment Thursday.
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, who is considering
approval of the buyout, had no advance warning of the resignations,
Muncaster said. He said it was too early to tell whether the
changes would affect approval.
   Checchi led a Los Angeles-based investment group that purchased
Northwest in June, topping several other reported bidders.
   Speculation at the time was that Malek, who was a finalist in
December 1987 for the top job at United Airlines, would replace
Rothmeier as chief executive. But Checchi repeatedly said he wanted
Rothmeier to continue to lead the airline.
   Rothmeier oversaw the 1986 acquisition of Republic Airlines and
led management's fight against a hostile takeover bid of Northwest
launched early this year by oil billionaire Marvin Davis.
   The takeover battled ended in June when Checchi's group
completed its all-cash buyout of the carrier for $121 a share.
Rothmeier said at the time that he considered Checchi's group to be
friendly.
   In March, NWA's board of directors approved a severance package
that would pay Rothmeier more than $2 million if he were to leave
the airline. His term as chairman was marked by long contract
battles with the airline's three principal unions, but all three
groups now are under long-term pacts.
   Also resigning were John Horn, president and chief operating
officer; Benjamin G. Griggs Jr., executive vice president of NWA
Companies; Allan Pray, executive vice president-international; and
William Sitter, executive vice president-administration and chief
information officer.
   Sitter has been hired by Allstate Insurance Co. of Northbrook,
Ill., as chief information officer and a member of the company's
board of directors, a spokesman for the insurance company said
Thursday.
   James Cronin, former president and chief executive officer of
Tiger International, was named executive vice president and
chairman of NWA Companies, including the Northwest Aerospace
Training Corp., MLT Vacations and Northwest Aircraft Inc.
   Rothmeier, 42, joined Northwest in 1973 and held a number of
executive posts before being named president and chief operating
officer in 1983. He became chief executive officer and chairman in
1986.
   Checchi, 41, previously was a principal with Bass Brothers
Enterprises and an adviser to the Walt Disney Company. From
1975-82, he held various positions in Marriott Corp., completing
his tenure as vice president of corporate development and treasurer.
   Malek, 52, was Marriott's executive vice president 1978-88 and
president and chief executive of Marriott Hotels from 1981-88.

<HEAD>Hertz Drops Scali, Picks Wells Rich Greene as Ad Agency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hertz Corp. said Thursday it has selected
Wells Rich Greene for its estimated $25 million advertising
assignment, severing its decade-long association with the agency
Scali McCabe Sloves.
   The car rental giant and its new agency provided no indication
of Hertz's plans for its long-running campaign that has featured
former pro football star O.J. Simpson and golfing great Arnold
Palmer.
   Hertz, based in Park Ridge, N.J., announced in late June that it
was reviewing its advertising assignment and said Scali would be
among four ad agencies invited to try to win the job.
   At the time, Hertz marketing and sales executive Brian Kennedy
said the Scali partnership with Hertz had produced some the best
advertising of the decade.
   But he noted that Hertz had been adding new services over the
past year and decided ``the time has come ... to re-examine how we
position the company and our services as we move forward.''
   Hertz offered no explanation Thursday for its decision to change
agencies.
   Marvin Sloves, chairman and chief executive of Scali McCabe
Sloves, said it was ``a great disappointment to lose an old
friend,'' but that the agency would look for other ways to put its
experience in the travel business to work.
   The agency's billings total about $300 million a year.
   Sloves said 30 to 40 of the agency's 400 employees worked on the
account, but that he had not yet considered whether there would be
layoffs.
   ``We are pitching two new accounts this week,'' he said, but
declined to identify them. Any wins could offset the potential
impact of the loss of Hertz.
   New York-based Scali is a unit of WPP Group PLC of London.
   Wells Rich Greene, also New York-based, has billings of about
$800 million. Its clients include International Business Machines
Corp.

   Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. announced Thursday it
had agreed to pay $1.1 billion for the four Sea World parks around
the country plus two other theme parks from Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich Inc.
   The deal will make Anheuser-Busch the second largest theme park
operator in America, behind Walt Disney Co., and will help Harcourt
pay off the massive debt it accumulated in thwarting a hostile
takeover two years ago.
   ``We think this acquisition is a very logical move for
Anheuser-Busch,'' said August A. Busch III, chairman and president
of the company. ``We have been involved in the family entertainment
industry for the last 30 years and it is a business we know well.''
   The purchase was expected to be completed in November.
   Anheuser-Busch, the world's leading brewery, operates Busch
Gardens in Tampa, Fla., one of the biggest four zoos in the
country; a 17th century European-style park in Williamsburg, Va.; a
water park in Tampa and a futuristic children's park near
Philadelphia.
   The company also is planning a major theme park and resort along
the Spanish Mediterranean coast just south of Barcelona, according
to Vicki Pearlman, a spokeswoman for Anheuser-Busch. The park is
scheduled to open in 1992 or 1993.
   Family entertainment is one of Anheuser-Busch's four core
businesses along with beer, food and container manufacturing.
   The popular Sea World parks, which feature performing killer
whales such as the famous Shamu, trained dolphins and other sea
creatures, are located in San Diego; Orlando, Fla.; San Antonio,
Texas; and Aurora, Ohio.
   The other parks involved in the deal are Boardwalk and Baseball
in Orlando and Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven, Fla. The purchase
also includes land surrounding the three Florida parks and Sea
World of Texas.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday, Anheuser-Busch
stock closed up 62{ cents at $42.25, while Harcourt Brace rose 62{
cents to close at $16.25.
   Analysts say Orlando-based Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, a leading
book publisher, is selling the parks in an effort to pay off a
nearly $2.9 billion debt it accumulated in fending off a 1987
hostile takeover attempt by British communications mogul Robert
Maxwell.
   ``They (Harcourt Brace) didn't have a whole lot of choice,''
said Robert Dunlap Jr., analyst for Brown Brothers Harriman in New
York.
   But in giving up the theme park business, Harcourt Brace also is
relieving itself of the chronic management problems and falling
attendance at the six parks.
   Attendance at the six parks dropped nearly 5 percent last year,
due in part to bad weather, but the decline has continued this
year, a company spokesman said.
   In 1988, sales at the parks were $388 million and pre-tax
earnings were $62 million, Anheuser-Busch said.. This year pre-tax
earnings were projected to rise to $90 million, analysts said.
   Although published reports earlier this month identified
Anheuser-Busch as the likely buyer of the parks, only two bidders
for the park actually went public with their plans. One was a group
of former Harcourt Brace and Sea World executives led by Sea World
founder George Millay. The other was from Florida Leisure
Acquisition Corp., which owns the Silver Springs attraction in
Ocala.
   Harcourt Brace has been in the theme park business for 13 years.
   The purchase price of $1.1 billion includes $975 million for the
theme parks and the rest for the Harcourt Brace's land holdings.
The agreement also calls for Harcourt Brace to receive half of the
profits over $100 million from any sale of the undeveloped land
included in the deal.

   Emerson Electric Co. and Robert Bosch GmbH of
West Germany have agreed to buy toolmaker Vermont American Corp. of
Louisville for about $440 million, the companies announced Thursday.
   The purchase will be made by a new, as yet unnamed, corporation
that will be formed by the two companies. After the purchase, the

tools, power tool accessories, hand tools and lawn and garden
products for consumer and industrial use.
   Emerson and Bosch are major producers of power tools in the
United States and Europe. Sears, Roebuck and Co. will be a minority
investor.
   Emerson, based in St. Louis, manufactures a broad range of
electronic, electrical and other products for consumer, commercial,
industrial and government and defense markets.
   Bosch, based in Stuttgart, West Germany, manufactures electronic
automotive equipment, communications technology, consumer goods and

<HEAD>Dissident Datapoint Shareholder Files Countersuit Against Edelman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shareholder trying to gain control
of Datapoint Corp.'s board of directors claimed Thursday that
Chairman Asher B. Edelman illegally bought stock in the computer
company to thwart the takeover attempt.
   The lawsuit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, claims
Datapoint's Edelman-controlled board illegally changed the record
date of a solicitation order in order to give Edelman and
associates time to buy enough stock to block Martin S. Ackerman's
effort to oust the board.
   Edelman, a takeover specialist, increased his holdings in
Datapoint to more than 40 percent through stock purchases during a
two-day period shortly after Ackerman announced his plan to replace
the board.
   Ackerman claims the change in the corporate bylaw resulted in a
``breach of their corporate duties as directors, (and restricted)
stockholders from taking action by written consent for the primary
purpose of entrenching Edelman and other directors in the
management of Datapoint.''
   The suit is a response to a lawsuit filed earlier this month by
Edelman.
   Ackerman began the takeover attempt earlier this month, saying
Edelman was responsible for more than $126 million in stock
declines and losses at San Antonio-based Datapoint, which has about
$330 million in annual sales and employs about 2,600 people.
   Edelman took control of Datapoint in March 1985 and has used
some of the company's liquid capital for his other investments.
   Datapoint officials were not immediately available Thursday to
comment on the latest action.

<HEAD>Struggling Savings Bank Announces Shareholder's Equity Eliminated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Empire of America Savings Bank, which has
struggled with recent operating losses, announced Thursday it has a
negative net worth and is anticipating a huge third-quarter loss.
   The savings bank said it will continue to operate normally and
that the projected losses will have no effect on the bank's
customers, employees or vendors.
   President and Chief Executive Officer Kent Dixon, while
conceding that the elimination of shareholders' equity through a
negative net worth was of ``great concern,'' said the bank would
``continue to provide the high quality of service which our
customers have come to expect.''
   In July, when the bank announced a second-quarter loss of $54.2
million, Dixon predicted that continuing losses would eat up its
common shareholders' equity by the end of this year. But in a news
release Thursday, Empire said the equity had been depleted as of
Aug. 31.
   Dixon said the bank, one of the nation's 20 largest thrifts, is
anticipating a third-quarter loss of about $150 million.
   Empire operates 142 offices in New York, Texas, California and
Michigan. It has total assets of $11 billion.
   In recent months, Empire has agreed to sell its $650 million
credit card portfolio and also said it plans to sell nearly $1
billion in auto loans it wrote though car dealers.
   In November 1986, when the bank first sold stock publicly, its
shares fetched $5.62. The stock closed Thursday at 36 cents a share.
   ``The basic definition of stockholders' equity would be the
assets of the corporation minus its liabilities,'' said analyst
Bill Ripple. ``If the liabilities exceed the assets, there is
really no stockholders equity. There's no more net worth in the
corporation. Therefore, the value of the stock is zero.''
   The bank is operating under an agreement with federal regulators
to get out of several risky lending businesses and to emphasize its
traditional home mortgage lending.
   An analyst for the First Albany Corp., Donald Kauth, estimated
this summer in a research report that Empire needed to raise $890
million by 1994 to meet federal capital requirements.

   One of three suspects set for trial in
an alleged $10 million extortion attempt of the Du Pont Co. pleaded
innocent Thursday.
   Bruno Skerianz, charged with attempted extortion and conspiracy,
entered the plea during his arraignment before U.S. Magistrate Sue
Robinson.
   Skerianz and two other suspects, who have been held at
undisclosed locations since their arrests in February, will be
tried simultaneously in federal court in early December.
   All face the same charges and if convicted, could be sentenced
to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Skerianz's attorney, however, plans to file for a change of
venue because he contends Skerianz cannot receive a fair trial in
Wilmington, headquarters of Du Pont.
   The federal government plans to drop charges against a fourth
suspect, Maria I. Lorenzo de Bianchini, who has agreed to testify
for the government.
   A fifth suspect, Jose Maria Petrosino, is fighting extradition
from Geneva, Switzerland.
   Skerianz and the other suspects, all Argentinian nationals, had
worked at the Du Pont plant in Mercedes, Argentina, one of several
plants that make Lycra, the company's trade name for spandex fiber.
   All of the suspects, except for Petrosino, were arrested in
February in Geneva after an aborted meeting at which Du Pont was to
pay $10 million in exchange for documents that contained trade
secrets about Lycra.
   Spandex is used primarily in clothing such as swimming suits,
leotards and pantyhose.

<TEXT>
   An investment group that includes former
Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth has extended its tender offer
for the shares of the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines.
   Numerous unresolved issues remain in negotiations with the
airline's unions, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing Wednesday by HAL Acqusition Inc., which has agreed to buy
HAL Inc.
   The filing was required to extend the offer, due to expire
Tuesday, and the wording did not mean that negotiations with the
unions had hit snags, said J. Thomas Talbot, who with Ueberroth
heads the acquisition group.
   HAL Acquisition and the unions have agreed not to make any
public statements on progress of the negotiations until they are
completed, Talbot said.
   However, the acquisition company is ``delighted'' with the
progress of the buyout bid as a whole, he said.
   HAL Acquisition has extended its $22-a-share tender offer until
after the Oct. 19 meeting of the airline's shareholders, Talbot
said.
   The buyout agreement was announced Aug. 20.
   Hawaiian Air has been plagued by losses in recent years.

   Two of the leading makers of ceramics used in
high-technology applications, Kyocera Corp. of Japan and AVX Corp.,
announced Thursday they have agreed to merge in a deal worth about
$531 million.
   Under the deal, all outstanding common shares of AVX will be
swapped for American depository shares of Kyocera. Each Kyocera ADS
represents two shares of the company's stock.
   The deal is believed to be the first stock-swap merger between a
U.S. and a Japanese company, The New York Tiees reported.
   Kyocera, based in Kyoto, makes ceramics for semiconductors and
other electronics applications. The company also owns 26.5 percent
of Japan's largest independent communications company, Daini-Denden.
   AVX, based on New York's Long Island, makes ceramic and glass
components used in electronics.
   The deal is subject to approval by Japanese and U.S. regulators.
   Kyocera already has a major market in this country, officials
said.
   ``There isn't a major semiconductor company in the United States
which doesn't buy from Kyocera,'' Marshall D. Butler, chairman of
AVX, told the Times.
   After the merger announcement, AVX shares closed at $29.625, up
$8, on the New York Stock Exchange. Kyocera's ADS's closed at
$80.625, up 12.5 cents.
   Officials of both companies said they hoped to expand their
markets in the United States, Japan and Europe.

<HEAD>Japanese Computer Maker to Pay for Tandy Patents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese maker of portable computers
has agreed to pay Tandy Corp. for several patents, including those
for a 4.5-pound unit that uses handwriting recognition in place of
a traditional keyboard, officials said Thursday.
   Officials at Tandy's Fort Worth headquarters said Toshiba Corp.
reached a licensing agreement with Tandy's Grid System Corp.
subsidiary on its fundamental patents for portable laptop computers.
   The most notable of the patents are those for Tandy's new
GridPad, which is the first PC designed to address applications
such as utility meter reading, census taking and inventory order
taking where data must be gathered or forms filled out while
standing or walking.
   The person using the computer enters information into it by
writing on the computer's clipboard-size screen with an electronic
pen.
   The unit operates for up to eight hours on a set of nicad or
AA-size alkaline batteries. It will carry a base price of $2,370.
   Another patent for which Toshiba will make payments covers a
feature of portable computer design that allows the computer screen
to fold over the keyboard.
   Tandy, which recorded $4.2 billion in sales in its most recent
fiscal year, did not specify the size of the payments or the terms
of the licensing agreement. However, industry analysts said the
Toshiba payments could represent millions of dollars.
   Tandy officials said the company is actively negotiating deals
with other makers of portable computers.
   At a presentation to analysts and members of the media at a
computer manufacturing plant in Fort Worth, Tandy also announced:
   _A $999 laptop computer that weighs 6.5 pounds and can operate
for five hours without recharging its battery. The Tandy 1100 FD
should be available by December. The new laptop was jointly
developed with Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan, which
began reselling Tandy desktop computers under its Panasonic brand
last year.
   The Tandy 1100 FD will compete with the popular Toshiba T1000
laptop computer. That machine has a list price of $999, but sells
for as low as $649 at discount.
   _A $350 circuit card that turns desktop personal computers into
facsimile machines. The Tandy FaxMate board permits the computers
to create, send and receive facsimile documents.
