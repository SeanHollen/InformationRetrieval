   Five Central American presidents announced
agreement Monday on a plan to end the war in Nicaragua within 120
days by demobilizing 11,000 U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels based in
the mountains of Honduras.
   ``We desire and hope that the Contras (rebels) will return to
live in peace in Nicaragua,'' President Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala
told a news conference after signing the accord designed to end the
9-year-old conflict.
   The agreement _ signed by presidents Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua,
Jose Azcona of Honduras, Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador, Oscar
Arias of Costa Rica and Cerezo _ also calls for a cease-fire in El
Salvador.
   It sets no timetable, however, for an end to the Salvadoran
fighting between the government and leftist guerrillas of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   ``The accord asks the international community for support,''
said Azcona, reading a communique at the end of the three-day
summit.
   In Mexico City, where he met with Mexican officials, U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said he could not comment
because he had not seen a text of the pact.
   The agreement calls for the United Nations and the Organization
of American States to set up a verification commission within 30
days to plan and monitor the demobilization and help avoid any
border incidents.
   The plan then sets a 90-day timetable for the demobilization and
resettlement in Nicaragua of the Contras, who would surrender their
arms to a force made up of Spanish, West German and Canadian
troops, Azcona said.
   The 120-day period begins Monday and would be up Dec. 5. The
presidents agreed to meet again after Dec. 5 to review progress.
   Central American agreements on deadlines have a history of
slippage. When the presidents met in February, they set a 90-day
deadline to make final the plans for the Contras' removal. The
deadline was hardly noticed when it expired in May.
   Plans now call for resettling elsewhere the 11,000 Contras and
12,000 dependents living in Honduras along the Nicaraguan border.
The Contras have been fighting the leftist Sandinistas since 1981,
saying they betrayed the goals of the revolution that ousted
President Anastasio Somoza in July 1979.
   Fighting has been reduced to sporadic clashes since last year,
when the United States cut off military aid. The Nicaraguan
government says 50,000 people have been killed the conflict.
   If Central American nations stick to their plan to dismantle the
Contras, the rebels would face huge obstacles in remaining a
significant force. Most of their supplies come from the United
States, the bulk entering by truck over a single dirt road that
winds 60 rough miles from the nearest paved highway.
   ``This is a very difficult situation for the Nicaraguan people.
We have been fighting for ten years to achieve peace and democracy
for our country and now we feel abandoned,'' Contra advisor Azucena
Ferrey said in Miami.
   Ortega's government has set elections for next February. The
domestic opposition has agreed to a call for disbanding the Contras
in return for democratic reforms.
   The summit communique asked the Nicaraguan Resistance to accept
the plan, although Adolfo Calero, a leader of the Resistance's
political directorate, said Monday the Contras would not disarm
until free elections were held in Nicaragua _ a position the United
States has supported.
   ``We're ready to exchange arms for democracy, but not for
promises,'' said Calero in a speech in Madison, Ala., shortly
before the accord was signed.
   `I expect the United States government to give total support to
this agreement,'' said Ortega after the signing. He said U.S. funds
now being spent on aid to the Contras should help pay for the
demobilization.
   Baker noted that the Esquipulas agreement, a Central American
accord signed two years ago, says any demobilization of the
Nicaraguan Resistance must be carried out under conditions of
safety and democracy in Nicaragua and must be voluntary.
   ``I don't think the Central American democracies would do
anything to change the terms of the agreement that they have put
forth,'' Baker said.
   Nicaragua and Honduras promised as part of the accord to prevent
their territories from being used to launch attacks on other
states. And Nicaragua agreed to drop a suit against Honduras in the
International Court of Justice. The suit accuses Honduras of
allowing the Contras to operate on Honduran soil.
   The Sandinista government repeated its promise to implement more
democracy in Nicaragua. It also promised to negotiate directly with
the Nicaraguan Resistance on how the Contras can be voluntarily
repatriated and reintegrated in the political process.
   Contras who do not want to return to Nicaragua can settle
elsewhere, and Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala all promised
they would accept refugees.
   The United States was not mentioned, although presumably some
Contras would want to settle there.
   Earlier Monday, Nicaragua had accused the United States of
trying to scuttle an agreement.
   ``The United States is exerting great pressure so no agreement
is reached,'' Ortega told reporters. ``They are in direct contact
with all the delegations except Nicaragua.''
   Cristiani denied being pressured by the United States.
   The presidents agreed in February to dismantle the Nicaraguan
rebels, but delayed a decision on the mechanics and timetable until
this meeting.
   Ortega gave the other presidents a letter from the Salvadoran
rebels asking their cooperation in negotiating an end to the war.
   Cristiani said his government was willing to negotiate with the
rebels on condition that ``once the talks begin that they not look
for excuses to break them.''
   The U.S. government had four observers at the meeting but they
were meeting delegates outside the talks, not attending the
sessions.

<HEAD>Choice for New Prime Minister of New Zealand Is An Academic</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-New Zealand, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Geoffrey Palmer, selected as New
Zealand's new prime minister, has a reputation as an academic. He
also is a fan of country and Western music and a man who knows the
United States from up close.
   Palmer, 47, took office as head of the governing Labor Party on
Tuesday following the surprise resignation of Laborite David Lange
as prime minister the previous day. Party leadership assures
Palmer's election in Parliament as prime minister.
   Palmer, with frizzled silver hair, thunderous voice and
earnestness, is known within the Labor Party as Moses.
   He will take over as prime minister 10 years after entering
Parliament in a special election.
   A former law professor, he is from the center-right of the party
and has been the driving force behind the government's legal
initiatives, including a proposed Bill of Rights.
   Palmer is not a socialist, despite having reached the top of a
party that is proud of its socialist traditions. Palmer says he is
a middle-of-the-roader on economic issues, neither a free marketeer
nor a centralist.
   Colleagues say he has self-confidence and loves arguing. Former
students remember him as a demanding teacher.
   He collects Royal Albert bone china as a hobby and plays the
trumpet.
   Palmer is not expected to strive for the limelight on the world
stage in the same manner as Lange.
   He rarely shows his boisterous element of humor in public, but
friends say it's there. He was once in a group of university
pranksters taken to a police station for breaking into a women's
hostel.
   Long periods of living overseas helped mold the political
Palmer. At his first news conference Tuesday after his election as
party leader he said he was ``very fond'' of the United States,
having spent so much time there.
   When he and his wife, Margaret, went to Chicago in the 1960s
they expressed shock at the violence and squalor. They lived with
their baby son on the south side, slept on a mattress on the floor,
and drove a $50 car that was not insured because they could not
foot the bill.
   They returned to the United States in 1969 when Palmer was
appointed professor of law at Iowa University. He later moved to
another professorship at Virginia.
   Palmer has said he came to love the United States for its human
diversity and lively intellectual culture.
   At his news conference, Palmer said the government's course
would be solid and dependable, but perhaps not exciting. He said
there would be no change in economic policy and that Finance
Minister David Caygill would remain in his job, even though his
predecessor, Roger Douglas, was back in the Cabinet.
   He also declared himself a staunch supporter of New Zealand's
stand against visits by nuclear ships, and said there would
definitely be no change in the policy.

<HEAD>Former Army General Gets Probation In Fraud Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired Army brigadier general was
given two years probation Monday on his conviction for conspiracy
to defraud the federal government.
   George H. Young Jr., 68, of Leavenworth, Kan., pleaded guilty in
June to the count stemming from an investigation of him and his
defense consulting company, the Milton Corp.
   Young retired from the Army in 1971 after being censured for
failure to adequately investigate the massacre of South Vietnamese
civilians by American troops at My Lai in 1968.
   The indictment, returned in Michigan, accused Young and the
company of sending periodic monthly payments between 1984 and 1986
to Army Capt. James McDowell of the Army Tank Automotive Command in
Warren, Mich., ``in return for procurement information regarding
government defense contracts.''
   McDowell told his superiors about contacts with Young and
cooperated with federal investigators.
   Ottawa Truck, a company from Ottawa, Kan., that was working on
development of an all-terrain supply vehicle, was a client of
Young's company. Ottawa Truck was not charged in the case, but was
named an unindicted co-conspirator.
   Under a plea agreement with the U.S. attorney's office in
Detroit, which prosecuted the case, a bribery charge to which Young
pleaded innocent was dismissed at sentencing.
   U.S. District Judge Earl O'Connor ordered a three-year prison
term for Young, but suspended the sentence and placed him on two
years probation. A condition of probation requires Young to do up
to 300 hours of community service work.
   The case had been transferred to Kansas for the plea and
sentencing because of Young's ailing health.

   After the Sunday night performance of ``Oh!
Calcutta!'' cast members put on their clothes and went home.
   Billed as ``the world's longest running erotic stage musical,''
``Oh! Calcutta!'' may tour nationally and in Latin America, but its
Broadway run is over. Executive producer Maria Di Dia says it
played 5,959 performances.
   The revue opened June 17, 1969, at off-Broadway's Eden Theater,
newly named to emphasize the nudity in the show. There were ten in
the cast then. The final performance had eight in the opening
number, ``Taking Off the Robe,'' and 11 in the finale as a few cast
alumni returned for a final scamper in white robes and birthday
suits.
   ``Oh! Calcutta!'' moved to Broadway's Belasco Theater in 1971
and closed in 1972. The production just ended opened Sept. 24,
1976, at the Edison Theater.
   In 1969, nudity was burgeoning in off-Broadway shows, a trend
that has since receded. To an audience member who had not seen
``Oh! Calcutta!'' since its original opening, there seemed to be
less nudity _ but more vulgar words _ than remembered.
   The show got its start when English critic Kenneth Tynan asked
friends and acquaintances to write skits for a revue about ``the
pursuit of happiness through sex.'' Contributors included himself,
Jules Feiffer, Dan Greenburg, John Lennon, Leonard Melfi, Sam
Shepard and Sherman Yellen.
   The results showed startlingly little cleverness. The program
didn't reveal who wrote what, saving author embarrassment.

   It took 10 years for Gregg Francis
Braun to change from a stocky, popular high school football player
into a frail, erratic man suspected of shooting five people to
death in four states.
   His friends in this booming southwest Kansas cattle town say
drugs, alcohol and a frightening temper were the signposts along
that downhill road.
   Braun, 28, is charged with three killings of convenience store
clerks in Kansas and New Mexico and is the primary suspect in two
other slayings in Texas and Oklahoma.
   Although another man was briefly charged with two of the crimes,
authorities later dropped the charges and said it was a case of
mistaken identity. The other man, they said, looked enough like
Braun to be his twin.
   Braun's real brother, Glenn Braun, a prosecutor in Hays, makes
no effort to defend Braun.
   ``If the news reports are accurate, and I assume they are, then
it would be unproductive to try to look at this all as some big
mistake,'' he said.
   Eddie Partin, who has known Gregg Braun since junior high
school, said his friend was well-liked in school. Classmates and
teachers said Braun, the youngest son of Lelyn J. Braun, a
successful lawyer, was quiet and didn't particularly stand out.
   But signs of trouble surfaced early.
   Expelled from a Catholic prep school as a freshman, Braun
started having serious problems with drugs and alcohol while at
Garden City High School.
   A report from a substance abuse treatment center at St. John's
Hospital in Salina states that Braun first got drunk at age 13 and
first smoked marijuana at 15.
   ``His loss of control over his chemical usage was as a junior in
high school, approximately 16 years old,'' the report said. ``He
would smoke before going to high school and also take amphetamines
before going to work.''
   Braun spent a month at the Salina center, in central Kansas,
after being arrested for drunken driving following his freshman
year at the University of Kansas. Braun got a bachelor's degree in
administration of justice from Wichita State University in July
1988 after attending classes there six years.
   He spent time in various odd jobs, quitting a feedlot the day
after the Garden City killings.
   In Wichita, he was charged with aggravated assault in January
after threatening a woman with a .25-caliber pistol. Braun also had
convictions in Wichita for drunken driving, soliciting a prostitute
and careless driving.
   Partin remembers seeing Braun in January for the first time in
several years. He didn't recognize his old classmate at first.
``He'd probably lost 50 pounds,'' Partin said. ``He didn't look
healthy.''
   Twice during the next few months, Partin, a Hilton Inn night
manager, had to order Braun to leave the hotel after he fell asleep
on a couch outside the lounge.
   Braun threw a coffee cup through a TV screen in the bar after he
was refused a drink on May 30, according to Partin, who said he
confronted Braun as he stormed out. ``He was beyond any control. He
had lost reality completely.'' A month later Braun was barred from
another Garden City nightspot, the Grain Bin Saloon, and charged
with disorderly conduct after a confrontation with another customer.
   The first killings took place July 19 in Garden City. Two
convenience store clerks were abducted from separate stores and
shot to death, their bodies dumped three miles apart outside the
city.
   On July 20, the owner of a Pampa, Texas, photo processing shop
was killed. On July 21, a flower shop employee in Ardmore, Okla.,
was killed and two co-workers were wounded. On July 23, a
convenience store clerk in Springer, N.M., was slain.
   All were women except the Texas shop owner. And all were shot
once in the head with a .25-caliber semiautomatic pistol,
authorities said.
   Braun is charged with double counts of murder, aggravated
kidnapping and aggravated robbery in the Kansas case, and with
murder in the New Mexico case. He is the prime suspect in the Texas
and Oklahoma killings.
   What motive could Braun have had for killing five people he
apparently never knew?
   ``There isn't any explanation,'' Glenn Braun said. ``It's futile
to look for that answer. And in its own way it's maddening.''
   The prosecutor said his brother has not contacted his family for
help. He added that he has tried to reassure his parents that they
are not to blame for his brother's troubles.
   ``Nobody can raise a child to commit these kinds of heinous
acts,'' he said. ``I don't think anyone can raise a child to
prevent them either.
   ``My folks are good people. They're not responsible for what my
brother did. There are some people who want to blame them, but it's
not their fault. He, on his own, for whatever sick, bizarre reason,
did what he did.''

<HEAD>Mitchell: Moderation by Iranian President May Weaken Influence Over
Terrorists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell says a
shift away from ``Islamic fanaticism'' by the new president of Iran
is welcome, but it may also weaken his influence over terrorists
holding Americans hostage in Lebanon.
   Mitchell also said Sunday that, ``Ultimately, the hosage crisis
will not be solved until the Lebanon crisis is solved.''
   The Maine Democrat, interviewed on ABC's ``This Week with David
Brinkley,'' called for pressuring Syria to stop letting terrorists
operate with impunity in Lebanon.
   The White House offered no comment Sunday on the reported offer
by captors of American Joseph Cicippio to free him in exchange for
a Shiite Moslem cleric and several hundred Shiite and Palestinian
prisoners held by the Israelis.
   Bill Harlow, a White House spokesman, said, ``We wouldn't
comment on it in any way ... We try not to react to each individual
rumor or report. It's a very fluid situation and that doesn't do
any good.''
   ``The diplomatic efforts continue,'' said Harlow.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in Mexico City for a
conference of U.S. and Mexican Cabinet members, was asked about the
demands for Cicippio's release and said, ``our well-established
policy is not to negotiate with terrorists.
   ``If the United States were to get into that game, we'd simply
see a lot more Americans taken hostage around the world,'' Baker
said.
   Mitchell said that with the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
and the election of Hashemi Rafsanjani as Iran's new president,
``there is a movement within Iran away from Islamic fanaticism and
more an attempt toward moderation.''
   ``That's a welcome development from our standpoint,'' Mitchell
said. But it may also reduce ``their direct control over these
groups ... No one can say for sure that each and every order by
Rafsanjani will be followed precisely by the Hezbollah.''
   Moshe Arens, the foreign minister of Israel, predicted on ABC
that if Israel and United States keep talking and acting tough to
terrorists and the states that back them, ``we may not see many
more abductions in the Middle East.''
   Hussein Mousawi, a leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, told
reporters Sunday in Lebanon that his group may kill an Israeli
prisoner unless Israel returns Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid.
   Israel has offered to swap Obeid and 150 Shiite prisoners for
all Western hostages and three Israeli soldiers held in Lebanon.
Israeli commandos abducted Obeid on July 28; three days later a
group called the Organization for the Oppressed on Earth claimed to
have executed Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins in revenge.
   Arens said Obeid was ``of some importance amongst those band of
criminals ... We seem to be holding an important card which may
make it possible ... to release all of the hostages.'' But he
cautioned against expecting an early release.
   Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's defense minister, said on CBS' ``Face
the Nation'' that ``we will not separate anything'' in the proposed
exchange of hostages, but the Israeli soldiers are ``our first
priority.''
   Rabin said he felt more responsibility for his three captured
soldiers than Cicippio, ``an American that converted to Islam and
decided to stay in Lebanon.''
   Sen. William S. Cohen, R-Maine, a key member of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that Bush
was ``doing the correct thing ... pursuing every conceivable
diplomatic initiative.''
   However, Cohen said, ``Patience in the face of prolonged
savagery really is not patience at all, but it's a policy of
appeasement.'' He urged the West to form a united front against
states that back the terrorists.
   Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said on ABC that,
``We have to devalue the hostages'' and convince the terrorists
``that the United States will not let itself get jerked around
every year or every six months by threats of murder.''

<HEAD>Violent Crimes Reach New High in 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A record 20,675 Americans were murdered in
1988 for an increase of 2.9 percent over the previous year, the FBI
says, while the number of aggravated assaults rose by 6.4 percent
to 910,000.
   The Uniform Crime Reports for 1988, released Sunday, said the
number of all violent crimes _ including rape and robbery _
increased 5.5 percent to a new high of 1.56 million. The previous
high for violent crimes was 1.48 million in 1987.
   Property crimes _ burglary, larceny-theft and motor vehicle
theft _ rose 2.8 percent to 12.36 million, for a combined total of
13.9 million.
   When the population increase was taken into account, the rate of
crimes per 100,000 people in 1988 rose 2.1 percent, the FBI said,
with the violent crime rate going up 4.5 percent and the property
crime rate increasing 1.8 percent.
   The greater increase in violent crimes could be attributed to
the aging of the nation's population, said criminologist Alfred
Blumstein, dean of the School of Urban and Public Affairs at
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
   ``When you look at the age profile of offenders, what you see
is, in the property crimes, a very sharp peak between say 14 and
20,'' he said. ``That's the age at which the population size is now
shrinking, whereas violent crimes have a much broader peak,
extending well into the 30s.''
   Blumstein said battles among drug dealers may provide another
reason for the growth in violent crime.
   The reports from law enforcement agencies nationwide, combined
in a publication called, ``Crime in the United States,'' do not
reveal the impact of drug-related violence, notes FBI Director
William S. Sessions.
   ``At all levels of government, from the White House to the
smallest townships, the ongoing `war on crime' includes daily
battles involving illegal drugs and drug-related crime,'' Sessions
said in the report.
   ``While violent crime known to law enforcement reached an
unprecedented high in 1988, there is currently no way to measure
accurately drug involvement in these unwelcome statistics,'' he
said.
   The slayings took place primarily in the nation's cities, which
experienced a 4 percent increase in the number of murders, while
suburban and rural areas saw a 2 percent reduction in the number of
killings, the report says.
   The murder counts increased 10 percent in the Northeast, 4
percent in the South and 1 percent in the West while the Midwest
had a 3 percent decline in the number of slayings.
   Among the 18,269 murder victims for which details were
available, 13,632 were male, 4,611 were female and the sex of 26
was unknown. Some 49.3 percent were white, 48.1 percent were black,
1.6 were other races and the race of 1 percent was unknown.
   More than half the victims were related to or acquainted with
their assailants, 12 percent were slain by strangers, and the
relationship was unknown for 33 percent.
   The nation's overall murder rate was 8.4 per 100,000, but the
major city with the highest rate, Washington D.C., suffered a rate
more than seven times as high, 59.5. The FBI report said 369 people
were killed in the nation's capital last year, while city police
have reported 372 were slain.
   In second place among cities with populations of 400,000 or more
was Detroit with 57.9 killed per 100,000. Atlanta was third at
48.8, according to calculations based on information in the report.
   Among the 34 cities with at least 400,000 residents, the lowest
murder rate was in Honolulu, with 28 slayings for a rate of 3.3 per
100,000 people. The second lowest was San Jose, Calif., with 37
homicides for a rate of 5.1 per 100,000.
   In overall crime rates, Atlanta led the list with 176.2 crimes
per 1,000 residents, followed by Fort Worth, Texas, at 172.4, and
Dallas, 168.8. At the bottom of the big cities' list was San Jose,
with 52.9 crimes per 1,000 people, and Honolulu, 59.4.
   As for metropolitan statistical areas _ which include
surrounding suburbs and, in some cases, substantial cities _ the
area with the highest murder rate was Albany, Ga., with 24.1 per
100,000 people, followed by New York with 22.7. At the bottom of
that list was Duluth, Minn., which includes St. Louis County,
Minn., and Douglas County, Wis., with a murder rate of 0.4 per

<HEAD>Congressional Democrats Seeking Political Agenda</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Democratic-controlled Congress is on
summer vacation, having calmed its internal strife but still
searching for a political agenda to steal thunder from a popular
president.
   With the scandal and resignation of House Speaker Jim Wright two
months behind them, Democrats feel ``very positive. I think we're
back on top. We feel we're in control,'' said Rep. Mike Synar,
D-Okla.
   Democrats cite a rush of spending bills and other routine
legislation in the past few weeks as evidence of effective
leadership from Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
and especially Speaker Thomas S. Foley, who took over when Wright
resigned.
   ``I must say that since Tom Foley came on, things have fallen
into place around here in a remarkable sort of way,'' concedes Rep.
Robert Michel of Illinois, the Republican leader.
   But the Democrats haven't found victory on the kinds of issues
they hoped would help define their party and chip away at the GOP
lock on the White House. The president has proved to be an elusive
target.
   ``I think the real difficulty is drawing a line or delineating
the difference between this administration and the Democratic
Congress,'' said Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee.
   In the Senate, Democrats beat Bush's nomination of John Tower
for Secretary of Defense, and more recently the nomination of
William Lucas to head the Justice Department's civil rights
division. But those were hardly the ideological battles of the
former President Reagan's era.
   On minimum wage, Democrats could not override Bush's veto. They
then failed to paint him as being mean-spirited on the issue,
because unlike Reagan, Bush's position wasn't extreme opposition
but simply supporting a smaller increase than the Democrats
preferred.
   The House Democratic leadership attempted to make a class issue
of Bush's support of a capital gains tax cut, but conservatives in
their own party have sided with the White House.
   Politically murkier still for the leadership was Bush's threat
last week to veto his huge savings and loan bailout plan if it
contained a Democratic plan for financing the scheme. Bush won
concessions, as Democrats couldn't muster veto-override strength.
   The House has shredded Bush's defense budget and voted to ease
abortion spending rules for the District of Columbia. But new veto
threats could reverse those outcomes.
   Michael Robinson, a professor of government at Georgetown
University, said Bush is adept at handling Congress but also ``the
most acquiescent toward Congress since Eisenhower or even before,''
he said.
   ``I like to call him the `Mr. Rogers' president,'' Robinson
said, referring to the children's television program. Congress is a
neighborhood where he is comfortable, and he doesn't want to tackle
issues that make enemies.
   ``We're going to work on the margins for the next several years
... environment, campaign reform, welfare policy. It's going to be
a time of tinkering,'' Robinson said. ``The press is going to find
this particularly boring to the point of loathsome.''
   Democrats who control the two chambers of Congress personally
like Bush, and although wary of some of the political operatives
Bush employs, they talk about an era of bipartisan cooperation on
legislation on clean air and child care.
   ``If the country does well, I think the Democrats will do
well,'' says Majority Leader Mitchell, citing progress on his
Senate legislative agenda.
   But some Democrats hope to find a popular message, a theme, for
the party to campaign on nationally.
   ``There's a lot of soul-searching going on, and a lot of deep
thinking as to just what should be the honed-down Democratic
agenda,'' Sasser said.

<HEAD>S&amp;L Bailout Will Mean Fewer Thrifts, Lower Deposit Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Landmark savings and loan legislation awaiting
President Bush's signature will touch the lives of everyone who
pays taxes, owns real estate or deposits their money in a thrift
institution or bank, analysts say.
   The 1,000-page bill, adopted by Congress early Saturday, is the
most significant financial law adopted since the Depression. As the
largest government bailout ever, it will cost each taxpayer about
$1,000 over 30 years to close or merge hundreds of insolvent thrift
institutions hemorrhaging losses at the rate of $20 million a day.
   It provides the most sweeping reorganization of the regulatory
bureaucracy in 50 years. Beyond that, it means fewer thrift
institutions, lower deposit rates for savers and reduced property
values in some regions.
   ``No doubt it will take years, if not decades, to determine what
good and ... what evil this legislation has wrought,'' said Kenneth
A. Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers
Association of America. ``It is of historic scope.''
   The first and most visible result likely will be noticed by
depositors in failed institutions that will soon come under new
ownership. The thrifts now must offer high-yielding certificates of
deposit just to keep enough cash coming in to stay afloat.
   When regulators finally get the money to close or infuse cash in
the institutions, they will have less need for deposits and will be
able to let deposit rates slip. More importantly, that will give
their healthy competitors, both banks and S&amp;Ls, room to lower their
rates as well.
   ``From a depositor's viewpoint it's the last chance to catch the
high-yielding CD (certificate of deposit) train,'' said Alex
Sheshunoff, a financial institutions consultant in Austin, Texas.
   ``If somebody wants to get on it, they better get on it within
the next month. The government is going to move as quickly as
possible against those thrifts that are paying exorbitantly high
rates,'' he said.
   That, in turn, may allow savings and loans and banks to charge
borrowers slightly lower rates, he said.
   Another provision that could potentially hurt depositors nearly
doubles the insurance premiums charged banks and boosts the already
higher rates charged to thrifts by 10 percent.
   Bert Ely, an analyst based in Alexandria, Va., said institutions
will be loath to pass on the fees to big depositors who move their
money in and out of accounts in chunks of $100,000 or more.
   Small depositors and checking account customers more likely will
feel the pinch, he said.
   As many as two-thirds of the nation's nearly 3,000 S&amp;Ls will be
bought out or closed, Ely said, predicting ``massive consolidations
all over the country.''
   The first round will come through government action against
failed thrifts, but the second round will come as commercial banks
begin buying weakened but still-solvent thrift associations, he
said.
   The bill, for the first time since the scheme of the U.S.
financial system was set in the 1930s, permits banks to buy solvent
S&amp;Ls.
   ``I'm amazed at how many banks, even small banks, are interested
in buying a thrift,'' said Guenther, whose organization represents
small banks.
   By restricting thrifts more closely to home mortgage lending,
and discouraging diversification into areas considered more risky,
but also potentially more lucrative, the bill makes it more
difficult for thrifts that do not become part of a larger banking
organization to remain profitable, Guenther said.
   The legislation not only shakes up the financial industry, it
will rattle the real estate business, unsettling markets _
particularly in depressed oil-producing areas of the Southwest _
but also providing unprecedented opportunity for real estate
investors and consultants to make a killing.
   Texas, Louisiana, Colorado, Oklahoma and Arizona are among the
states most vulnerable if regulators embark on a real estate fire
sale.
   ``That is one of the major hidden impacts of the bill,''
Sheshunoff said. ``To the extent that the government disposes of
real estate unwisely it's going to drive down prices in some
areas.''

<HEAD>House Democrats on Verge of Losing Capital Gains Tax Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats, seemingly invulnerable with
an 80-vote majority, are on the verge of seeing a handful of
dissident party members seal a major tax victory for President Bush.
   It's not a new position for the majority Democrats; they watched
helplessly eight years ago as conservative members of their party
provided the victory margin for President Reagan's across-the-board
tax cut _ an act many Democrats blame for today's budget woes.
   Now the issue is cutting taxes on capital gains. And just as
Democratic leaders engaged in a ``bidding war'' in 1980 in an
effort to block Reagan's tax cut, they have been forced to propose
their own capital gains reduction.
   With Congress in recess for a month, there is time for House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, to turn the
momentum and defeat the Bush-backed plan. That ``victory'' still
would leave Democrats solidly behind a cut in capital gains taxes _
just as Bush called for in last year's campaign.
   In a Sept. 30 debate with Michael S. Dukakis, Bush declared:
``When you cut capital gains ... it's not going to cost the
government money, it's going to increase revenues to the federal
government and it's going to create jobs.''
   The plan, which would cut the 33 percent top tax rate on capital
gains to 15 percent, was assailed by Dukakis as ``a tax cut for the
wealthiest 1 percent of the people in this country _ an average of
$30,000 that we're going to give to people making $200,000 a year.''
   When Bush forwarded his bill to Congress, it was widely endorsed
by Republicans but drew little support among Democrats.
Rostenkowski said there was no way he would allow Chicago
stockbrokers to pay a lower tax rate on their investments than
blue-collar workers pay on their wages _ and it appeared the bill
was dead.
   But an unusual public change of heart by Rostenkowski revived
the proposal. Finding it increasingly difficult to put together a
deficit-reduction plan because of Bush's opposition to a tax
increase, Rostenkowski announced on June 7 that he would consider a
capital gains cut if Bush would get behind some unspecified
Democratic tax initiatives.
   There was no evidence that Bush budged an inch. But backers of a
capital gains cut took the opening, and by the time the panel began
its work, the 13 Ways and Means Republicans and six of the 23
Democrats united behind a new proposal.
   Unlike Bush's bill, the new plan sponsored chiefly by Rep. Ed
Jenkins, D-Ga., would benefit investors in commercial buildings and
timber. It would reduce the top capital gains rate to 19.6 percent
for two years and then raise it to 28 percent and ``index'' certain
assets so that artificial gains created by inflation would not be
taxed.
   Facing certain defeat, Rostenkowski refused to bring capital
gains to a vote. Foley, calling a cut ``unwise, inequitable and
ill-timed,'' weighed in with a warning to Bush: drop the push for a
capital gains reduction or face the prospect of deadlocked
negotiations on 1991 deficit reductions.
   A closed caucus of all House Democrats last week confirmed that
although well over half the party members opposed a cut, there were
enough dissenters to ensure, with a solid bloc of Republicans, a
victory for Bush.
   Foley, while opposing a cut in the capital gains tax rate,
emphasized that he could consider some sort of ``indexing'' to
ensure that profits generated solely by inflation would not be
taxed.
   Rostenkowski quickly came up with an alternative built around
indexing. It would go further, allowing investors, in times of low
inflation, to avoid tax on 25 percent of the price for which they
sell stocks, buildings, timber or other assets held for more than
five years.
   The proposal failed to attract immediately any of the six
dissident Democrats or the 13 Ways and Means Republicans, and there
is no assurance that the other Ways and Means Democrats will go
along when they return to work next month. No matter how the
proposal is worded, it still would reduce the tax bite on capital
gains.
   Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, a Ways and Means member who wants a
capital gains cut, noted that dozens of other issues are facing the
committee: aiding the poor, child care, health care and the like.
   ``I'm hoping we don't continue to call this a party issue,''
Pickle said. ``The money (from a capital-gains reduction) will be
used to finance programs the Democratic party needs and endorses.''

<HEAD>Seafood in the Continental Manner _ A Gourmet Treat for Cows?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's cows may be in for a treat _
European-style seafood dinners that scientists say could prove the
secret to a substantial increase in milk production.
   ``Fish meal is a super cocktail of amino acids for cows,''
boasts Kelsey Short, marketing manager for a Louisiana-based
ocean-fishing company gearing up for sales to the dairy industry.
   Cows need hefty doses of protein to produce the amino acid
building blocks required to make milk protein.
   Those who favor fish meal say cows can make better use of the
protein it contains than the proteins in the solvent soybean meal
supplement often on the menu at the nation's dairy farms.
   The complex, four-part digestive tract of the cow finds it
easier to transform fish meal into amino acids.
   European cows have been getting the fish meal supplement for
some time and results of a recent study of 20 Holstein cows at the
Agriculture Department's U.S. Dairy Forage Center in Madison, Wis.,
were favorable.
   Cows produced an additional 3 pounds, or 1.4 quarts, of milk
daily when fed with high-quality alfalfa silage mixed with one
pound per day of fish meal protein supplement, according to Glen A.
Broderick, a dairy scientist with USDA's Agricultural Research
Service.
   The cows themselves seemed contented enough with the new diet,
the department said. It said fish meal is acceptable to the animals
when mixed into their regular feed ration.
   And dairy farmers may be contented, too, when they see the price
tag.
   Fish meal does cost 11 cents more per day than solvent soybean
meal. But tests showed the cows were producing an additional 36
cents worth of milk a day a current prices, according to Broderick.
   He said the 25-cent difference would amount to $12 a day for the
average Wisconsin farm with 48 cows. Cows fed on fish meal in the
study also gave milk with 4 percent more protein, meaning it would
yield slightly more cheese, the main use for dairy production in
the upper Midwest.
   As for consumers, marketing manager Short scoffs at the notion
that they would notice any difference.
   ``The two most common myths about feeding cows fish meal are
that the cows won't eat it and that the milk will taste fishy,'' he
said. ``Both of these myths have been thoroughly researched and
found to be untrue.''
   Meanwhile, Broderick plans future studies to compare fish meal
with other high-protein feeds, such as expeller, or heated, soybean
meal and roasted soybeans.

   Farmers are disgusted at what they see as
slack regulation of commodity futures trading markets by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, says National Farmers Union
President Leland Swenson.
   ``Too often decisions are made that smack of collusion at worst
and a good-old-boy network at best,'' Swenson said in a letter to
members of Congress following Wednesday's indictment of 46 traders
in Chicago in the aftermath of an FBI sting operation.
   Fraud, racketeering and filing false tax returns were among the
charges against the traders.
   The National Farmers Union is an 18-state organization that
claims more than 30,000 farm families among its members.
   ``Farmers are disgusted and frustrated with a futures system
that they have little control over and that virtually dictates the
price they receive for commodities produced,'' Swenson said.
   Swenson also wrote to other farm and commodity groups to suggest
they join forces in seeking major changes in commodity futures
regulation.
   ``If they exchanges are ever to gain the confidence of
producers, then producers must have a role in the oversight of
their operations,'' he said. ``... These latest revelations
exacerbate the mistrust that producers have of the futures markets
being a credible price-setting mechanism.''

   Foreign countries are gaining access to U.S.
government technology that could help them develop atomic weapons,
says a congressional report that blames the situation on
conflicting laws and erratic enforcement.
   Despite laws limiting the release of such data, ``sensitive
countries ... have obtained information dealing with detonators,
explosives and firing sets that could assist or enhance nuclear
weapons development,'' said the report by the General Accounting
Office, Congress' investigative arm.
   ``Sensitive'' countries were defined as communist-ruled or those
suspected of clandestine nuclear weapons programs. Of these, Iraq,
Israel, Pakistan, India, Argentina, South Africa, South Korea,
Taiwan, Bulgaria and China were named as buying sensitive
nuclear-related data from the U.S. Energy Department through
routine orders or subscriptions, along with nine other countries
including major allies.
   ``Many experts believe that the United States indirectly
assisted India through the liberal publication of unclassified
(fuel) reprocessing information,'' to stage its ``explosion of a
peaceful nuclear device in 1974,'' the report noted.
   The GAO cited no concrete example of U.S. information enabling a
country to make atomic bombs, but it said it has found that
``weaknesses exist ... that raise questions about the Department of
Energy's ability to effectively protect national security and meet
this country's nonproliferation policies.''
   The study was sent to Congress in June and, under GAO
regulations, made public 30 days later.
   The GAO and Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, who requested the report,
said the problem centers on the flow of information considered
sensitive but not formally classified as secret or restricted.
   ``The Department of Energy must stop dragging its feet on
issuing guidance to its (atomic) weapons laboratories on
identifying and limiting dissemination of unclassified, controlled
nuclear information,'' Glenn said in a statement.
   He said his governmental affairs committee plans hearings later
this year on the issue as well as other ``serious security
weaknesses at the DOE weapons labs.''
   The GAO study said the Energy Department's failure to issue
guidelines on unclassified material is ``resulting in the release
of sensitive information to proliferation-risk countries useful for
the design, manufacture or use of nuclear weapons,'' Glenn said.
   Energy Department spokeswoman Janie Shaheen said the department
received the report July 27 and planned no comment during the 60
days allowed for reviewing it.
   The DOE faces a dilemma, the GAO said, because under different
laws it is expected both to control and disseminate non-classified
nuclear information.
   The 1978 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act and other laws require
information controls, but ``various technology transfer legislation
requires DOE and the weapons laboratories to collaborate with the
private sector to disseminate unclassified research results,'' the
GAO said.
   ``Further, the Freedom of Information Act requires DOE to make
most unclassified information available to anyone _ domestic or
foreign _ who requests it,'' it added.
   DOE weapons laboratories produced 39,000 research reports in
1986-87 of which more than 60 percent were available by sale or
subscription, the GAO said.
   It found that 68 percent of 30 nuclear-related studies it traced
went to overseas recipients _ and that Iraq, Israel and Pakistan
requested six copies each while the largest total number of copies,
71, went to China.
   One of the reports sold abroad discussed methods to improve a
detonator used in most U.S. nuclear bombs; another described
methods to shape the explosives in such weapons, the GAO said.
   DOE scientists also respond directly to ``dear colleague''
requests for published information from foreign nationals,
including those from ``sensitive countries,'' the GAO said. ``When
the request is `routine,' DOE allows the laboratories to send the
information without prior approval,'' even though routine requests
are not officially defined.
   ``Several examples demonstrate ... confusion,'' the GAO said,
describing disagreements among scientists whether specific reports
merely summarized well-known techniques or provided new material
specifically useful for developing atomic weapons.

   The General Accounting Office, watchdog of
Congress, in a study of the flow of U.S. technology abroad, traces
foreign sales of 30 government research documents considered
sensitive.
   It found that between January 1987 and April 1988, the National
Technical Information Service sent 360 copies to addresses in 20
foreign countries and 132 to U.S. addresses. The GAO reported
varying opinions among Department of Energy scientists whether the
reports could help recipient countries develop nuclear weapons.
   The 30 research reports dealt with six subjects:
   _Modifying high explosives.
   _Improving ultrafast cameras used to study the effects of a
nuclear detonation.
   _Improving a detonator that is used in most U.S. nuclear weapons.
   _Improving understanding of high explosives.
   _Shaping and machining high explosives.
   _Setting off high explosives, information that the GAO noted
``could also be useful to saboteurs.''

   Richard M. Nixon quit as president 15 years
ago this week and the presidency hasn't been the same since, in the
view of historians and political observers.
   They say Nixon's departure was a painful event which ultimately
strengthened the republic by establishing that no president is
above the law.
   ``What was good for the republic was that it showed the capacity
of a constitutional system to severely punish the top dog who
appears to have violated the rules of the game,'' says Thomas E.
Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution.
   Even if the presidency suffered in the short term, says
historian Richard S. Kirkendall of the University of Washington,
``It would have left us with more serious problems if Nixon had
been able to get away with it.''
   Nixon resigned Aug. 9, 1974, a few days after surrendering the
``smoking gun'' Watergate tape recording. It showed that he had
discussed ways to cover up the 1972 break-in of Democratic
headquarters at the Watergate within a week of its occurrence.
   Once he made that evidence public, a previously divided House
Judiciary Committee unanimously agreed to recommend his
impeachment. Republican support withered and Nixon's removal from
office appeared a certainty.
   ``I think the initial effect was to make presidents much more
sensitive to the concerns of the public,'' said Washington lawyer
Philip Buchen, who served as an adviser to Gerald R. Ford, Nixon's
successor. ``That was true of Ford and (Jimmy) Carter. It began to
slip at the end of the Reagan administration or we wouldn't have
had the Iran-Contra affair.''
   Even during the Iran-Contra affair, Reagan's advisers were
cognizant of the possibility of impeachment, says Mann. He says the
record shows that privately they weighed that possibility.
   ``Even a strong president like Reagan found himself
substantially constrained by an active Congress and a whole new set
of statutes restricting presidential power,'' Mann added.
   Laws dealing with freedom of information, limits on a
president's war powers, campaign finances and presidential
impoundment of funds grew out of the Watergate experience.
   Colin Campbell, author of ``Managing the Presidency,'' says the
experience left Nixon's successors ``pretty skittish for a while.''
He thinks Carter, for one, was overly cautious.
   Political scientist Jim Reichley of the Brookings Institution
says Nixon's resignation strengthened congressional willpower and
Congress ``has been intruding on executive functions'' ever since.
   Bob Hartmann, who served as Ford's White House counselor,
considers the near-impeachment of Nixon an unfortunate event.
   ``There are other political remedies which are more routine and
which can make presidents toe the mark and put the fear of God in
them if they're over-reaching,'' Hartmann contends. If a president
oversteps the line, ``Congress can so fix his clock that he can't
do anything,'' he says.
   Buchen, however, says Nixon's continued tenure ``was having an
adverse effect on the morale of the country and its status around
the world. It could have led to a threatening international
incident. We did not have a president who was actively governing.''
   Austin Ranney, chairman of political science at the University
of California at Berkeley, said while it is never good to have a
law-breaking president, ``It was a wonderful thing that our system
of justice and separation of powers worked to remove a president
without an assassination or violence of any kind.''
   But Campbell, a Georgetown University political scientist, says
the lesson of Watergate didn't last long. He says he finds it
``almost alarming that it came to the point that we almost had to
do the same thing with Ronald Reagan.''
   Only Reagan's age, his popularity and his nearness to finishing
his term saved him from an impeachment attempt, Campbell says, and
he finds Reagan's escape worrisome, ``very seriously damaging to
the fiber of the republic.''
   Ranney says the difference between Watergate and Iran-Contra is
that Nixon knew what was happening while Reagan ``always denied
that he knew what was going on.''
   Kirkendall said President Bush's conduct in office shows that
Bush has learned Watergate's lesson. He noted Bush consults
conspicuously with congressional leaders and allies before making
major moves. ``He makes a big thing of it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Prostitutes Threaten to Strip in Front of Government Offices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHIHUAHUA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of prostitutes are threatening
to strip in front of the Government Palace unless authorities allow
the red-light district to re-open, according to news reports.
   ``We don't have anything to lose,'' said Magdalena Aguirre, a
spokeswoman for the newly formed Chihuahua Prostitutes Union.
   ``If they put us in jail, it will be nude,'' she was quoted as
saying in the Sunday edition of the Mexico City daily La Jornada.
   Chihuahua, a northern provincial capital, is about 250 miles
south of the Texas border city of El Paso.
   The government closed down Chihuahua's red-light district and
its more than 30 bordellos last week, saying the area gave the city
a bad image.
   Union leaders say thousands of people depended on the district
for their livelihood.
   Sergio Granados Pineda, a state government spokesman, told the
Mexico City daily Uno Mas Uno that the decision to shutter the
district was ``irreversible.''
   Ms. Aguirre scoffed at Gov. Fernando Baeza's suggestion that
prostitutes seek factory jobs.
   Factories ``only pay 60,000 pesos ($23) a week,'' she said. ``We
make that much or more in two hours.''

   Tompkins Square Park has the features of any of
the small patches of green in New York's dense inner city: Children
laugh on swings, old men play cards, couples snuggle on benches.
   But recently it has become less an oasis than the front line in
an ugly battle over one of the city's most diverse neighborhoods.
   A year ago, on the night of Aug. 6-7, the park in the heart of
the East Village was bloodied by a four-hour clash between
demonstrators and police that left 52 people injured and led to the
filing of more than 110 claims of police brutality.
   Police on Sunday arrested six people on disorderly conduct
charges at the end of a rally by about 100 people observing the
riot's first anniversary.
   The park remains a war zone, although the nature of the conflict
is in dispute. Is it a struggle by the homeless for a place to
live? Or a neighborhood's battle for control of its park?
   The melee last year began when police decided to enforce a 1
a.m. curfew in the park, which some residents said had become a
noisy center for drug use.
   Although no one disputes that drugs are used in Tompkins Square
and other parks, activists _ many of them self-proclaimed
anarchists _ saw the police action as part of a wider move to
sanitize the neighborhood, making it safe for yuppies and too
expensive for many others.
   As many as 250 people sleep in the park on any given night, most
of them homeless. But a few are activists with the political agenda
of demonstrating the inadequacies of the city's housing policies.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch has said he wants to rehabilitate thousands
of abandoned apartments in the neighborhood, half at subsidized
rates for poor people and half at market prices to pay for the
subsidy.
   ``We don't want to keep an area in permanent poverty, which is,
I think, what the anarchists would like,'' he said last year.
   Many longtime residents are opposed to the actions of the more
radical activists, including the construction of a tent city in the
park and the holding of frequent marches and rallies.
   ``I have never seen such a mess like this,'' said A. ``Ziggy''
Skrnyk, a longtime resident. ``Today this is a jungle, a real
jungle.''
   The East Village, part of lower Manhattan called the Lower East
Side, has seen wave upon wave of immigrants and is currently home
to Hispanics and Eastern Europeans, as well as drug dealers and
users, artists, and punks, among others.
   Many abandoned buildings have been illegally occupied _ some by
addicts who squat in the bare premises to use drugs, others by
urban pioneers willing to make major repairs to escape high rents
elsewhere in the city.
   Over the years, the grubby chic of the area has attracted
wealthier tenants, leading to rent hikes. Activists feel the
police, responding to the complaints of these tenants, are the
enforcement arm of a city administration bent on transforming the
neighborhood by removing undesirables.
   Police have been careful since last year's riot, rarely
enforcing curfew in the park and avoiding violence when they remove
tents or make arrests. More than 11,000 city police officers have
been retrained in crowd control.
   On July 5, police tore down a tent city and evicted more than
130 people. They were greeted by a volley of bottles, eggs and
sticks, but did not retaliate. Last week, police removed eight
tents, over the protests of more than 70 people. Three were
arrested.
   ``You won't see excessive violence on the part of police
officers,'' said Deputy Inspector Michael Julian, commanding
officer of the Ninth Precinct.
   The Rev. Frank Scanlan of St. Brigid's Catholic Church agreed
that police had become ``very sensitive,'' but said they were prone
to massive displays of manpower.
   When the city evicted squatters from two abandoned buildings
last spring, police blocked access to several blocks around the
park, including doorways and his church's parking lot.
   ``I, a priest, had to ask permission to go into my parking
lot,'' Scanlan said.
   Many residents believe anarchists and Marxists could help ease
tensions by leaving.
   ``I think that some people in the park would want nothing more
than another big confrontation,'' said Kate Walter, a founder of
the St. Marks Place Block Association. ``Some of them are white,
middle-class people with homes who come here to rabble-rouse while
the homeless sit around with a bottle.''

   These are among the developments in campaign finance reform
around the nation this year:
   ALASKA: Gov. Steve Cowper introduced a bill to prohibit direct
donations to candidates by corporations, unions and political
action committees. They currently are limited to contributions of
$1,000; under Cowper's bill, which remains in a legislative
committee, they could contribute to political parties only.
   CALIFORNIA: A court battle will determine the validity of two
campaign finance reform measures passed by voters last year.
Proposition 68 limited campaign spending and created public
financing of campaigns; Proposition 73, which received more votes
and therefore superceded Proposition 68, set limits on
contributions and banned public financing.
   FLORIDA: Legislators passed a bill to regulate ``slush funds''
managed by the House speaker and Senate president.
   ILLINOIS: The General Assembly approved legislation that would
allow insurance companies and horse racing organization licensees
to contribute to political campaigns in the state. In the past,
Gov. James R. Thompson has vetoed similar legislation.
   IOWA: A task force named by Gov. Terry Branstad released
tentative campaign reform recommendations that include a ban on
campaign contributions while the Legislature is in session and
limits on PAC contributions. The Legislature is also studying the
issue.
   KANSAS: The 1989 Legislature passed a sweeping overhaul of the
state's Campaign Finance Act. The legislation lowered the limit on
contributions by one-third and applied the limits to PACs or
corporations and their subsidiaries together. It also limited
national party organizations from giving state parties more than
$25,000 a year and more than $1,500 to candidates in an election
cycle, and required the filing of annual campaign spending reports,
rather than just before and after elections.
   MAINE: Legislators tinkered with reporting requirements, but the
major development will be a statewide referendum Nov. 7 on a Common
Cause plan to establish public financing for gubernatorial
candidates willing to accept spending curbs.
   MASSACHUSETTS: Two bills are pending to give more power to the
campaign and political finance office and place caps on PAC
contributions.
   MICHIGAN: A new law will raise from $2.4 million to $3.6 million
the amount that gubernatorial candidates may spend for both a
primary and general election, if they accept public funding.
   MONTANA: Legislature ordered campaign reports to be filed
quarterly in the year preceding an election year. Previously, the
law required the financial reports to be filed beginning in the
election year.
   NEVADA: A new law requires separate accounts so that campaign
funds aren't comingled with a candidate's personal funds.
   NEW MEXICO: A new law requires off-year campaign contributions
and expenditures to be reported.
   NEW YORK: New York City is holding its first publicly financed
elections this fall.
   TENNESSEE: The General Assembly created a seven-member Registry
of Election Finance that will enforce campaign disclosure, conflict
of interest and lobbyist laws. A new law also requires lawmakers to
report campaign contributions in non-election years in addition to
campaign years.
   VIRGINIA: A legislative commission is studying campaign
spending. This year's race for governor already has passed the $13
million mark and could reach $20 million by Nov. 7.

<HEAD>Attorneys Debate Marcos Civil Suits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An obscure law nearly 200 years old will be
pivotal in deciding civil lawsuits accusing former Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos of instituting a reign of terror in his
homeland, lawyers for both sides say.
   The attorneys debated Sunday whether deposed dictators should be
held responsible in American courts for human rights abuses
allegedly committed in their homelands. The discussion was part of
the American Bar Association's convention here.
   Last month, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated
damage suits accusing Marcos of ordering the imprisonment and
torture of numerous Philippine citizens during his 20-year rule.
   The suits had been dismissed by U.S. District Courts in Hawaii
and California on the grounds that Marcos' alleged actions were
``acts of state'' immune from lawsuit under a doctrine that courts
in one nation cannot judge the sovreign acts of another.
   ``We feel these (suits) are the only way the victims ... will be
able to obtain justice,'' said Sherry Broder, a Honolulu attorney
representing the alleged victims.
   ``Obviously, the victims couldn't seek justice in the
Philippines during Marcos' rule, and now that he's here, this is
the proper place to file,'' she said.
   Richard Hibey, a Washington-based Marcos attorney, said the
Circuit Court ruling would be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
He contends the United States has no jurisdiction in the case and
that Marcos still holds immunity as a head of state despite his
ouster in February 1986 during a civilian-military revolt.
   ``These cases do not belong here. They are not the judicial
business of the United States,'' said Hibey. ``What you have here
is aliens suing aliens ... not one of the acts was alleged to have
occurred in the United States.''
   However, Jon Van Dyke, a law professor at the University of
Hawaii and Broder's co-counsel, said international law holds that
``government officials cannot mistreat their people, and if they
do, they can be sued wherever they can be found.''
   Van Dyke and Broder said an alien tort statute enacted in 1790
set the precedent for one foreigner to sue another in the United
States and would be used to prove Marcos was liable.
   However, Hibey said the statute was based on an altercation
between two Frenchmen in the United States and, therefore, was
irrelevant in the Marcos' case, in which the alleged abuse occurred
in the Philippines. He said the law would help him prove that the
cases against Marcos should be heard in the Philippines.
   Hibey said the U.S. Solicitor General's Office had filed an
amicus brief agreeing that Marcos should not be sued in the United
States for civil cases. He called that significant ``because there
is virtually nothing the United States and I agree on in respect to
these Marcos cases.''
   Last October, the U.S. government indicted the 71-year-old
Marcos and his wife, Imelda, on criminal racketeering charges
accusing him of stealing more than $100 million from the Philippine
treasury and stashing it in the United States.
   Marcos has been separated from the case because of respiratory,
heart and kidney problems that have kept him hospitalized since
Jan. 15. He remained in critical condition Sunday at St. Francis
Medical Center, where he remains on life-support equipment, a
hospital spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>House Abortion Vote Indicates New Pressure on Lawmakers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last week's surprise House vote against
restrictions on abortion funding doesn't mean the chamber now backs
abortion rights, but lawmakers say it does signal an awareness that
voters are watching.
   There is widespread agreement that following the Supreme Court's
July decision granting states more muscle to block abortions, the
issue has become extremely high-profile _ and fraught with
political consequences.
   ``People will be watching these votes very closely,'' said Rep.
Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., who voted with the majority Wednesday to reject
a ban on public financing of all abortions in the District of
Columbia.
   ``It makes people wonder, `How will this be used in a 10-second
or 30-second commercial against me,''' Kolbe said.
   The House's 219-206 vote against the financing ban was a
surprise to both sides. It was a reversal of last year's 222-186
vote approving similar restrictions, and marked the first time
since 1980 that the House rejected an effort to restrict abortion.
   Twenty-three lawmakers switched from an anti-abortion vote in
1988 to a vote backing abortion rights vote last week, and several
gave varying reasons.
   The way the measure was crafted did not help. The proposal,
introduced by Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif., allowed no exceptions
to a ban on public aid for abortions, even if the mother's life
were endangered.
   Dornan said the exception for the mother's life was omitted only
for procedural reasons, and conceded after the vote that the
omission cost him votes and was a tactical mistake. Not only did
Dornan lose, but those who supported him left themselves vulnerable
to opponents next year.
   ``They've got some of their colleagues hung out on a record vote
to deny money for abortions even when the life of the mother is at
risk,'' said Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., one of the House's prime
pro-choice advocates. ``If they don't think the Democratic Party or
pro-choice groups will run political commercials on that, they're
living in dreamland.''
   AuCoin's prediction reflects a change in momentum on the
abortion issue, attributable to the Supreme Court decision, Webster
vs. Reproductive Health Services. Advocates of abortion rights say
their supporters have been galvanized by that ruling, and their
opponents concede that things are different _ for now.
   ``Some members, particularly some Democrats, have been hearing
quite a lot of noise from the other side recently and went to the
floor a little more disposed to listen to the other side,'' Douglas
Johnson, lobbyist for the National Right to Life Committee, said
last week.
   ``I don't think it means in most cases that they're permanently
shifting to the other column,'' he said. ``It does mean we need to
sit down with them again.''
   Even most lawmakers who back abortion rights agree that most
House members will continue to support abortion restrictions.
   ``We don't suddenly have a surprise pro-choice majority here,''
AuCoin conceded.
   Anti-abortion legislators said they faced another problem during
the Wednesday vote: dishonest lobbying by the abortion rights bloc.
Dornan and his supporters accused AuCoin and his allies of
misleading lawmakers by telling them Dornan's proposal would have
ended public aid in the district for contraceptives, which they say
is not true.
   Of several lawmakers who changed their votes from anti-abortion
in 1988 to the pro-choice side last week, the explanations varied.
   Kolbe describes himself as backing the right to abortion but an
opponent of using federal money for abortions. He said he ``fell
off the wagon'' last year, but now believes Congress should not
impose its will on the district government.
   Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan., said he was swayed by Dornan's
failure to exempt abortions involving endangered mothers, and a
fear that contraceptive aid would end.
   ``I couldn't vote against providing money for all abortions,''
he said.

<HEAD>States Search for Truce in Campaign Spending Wars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   While President Bush talks about it and Congress fights over it,
some state legislatures have actually begun to do something about
the high cost of running for office.
   Faced with a campaign spending ``arms race'' that has pushed the
cost of elective office to heights that couldn't have been imagined
a decade ago, legislators around the country are gingerly calling a
truce.
   At least a half-dozen states have passed some form of campaign
finance reform so far this year, and reform proposals are alive in
many others.
   ``I think there's more of a recognition, at least at the state
level, that the problem of the cost of campaigns is a very serious
one,'' said Ronald Michaelson, executive director of the Illinois
State Board of Elections, who studies campaign finance developments
nationally.
   The problem varies widely from state to state, but is raising
concern almost everywhere.
   What seems expensive in Kansas, where the average campaign for
the state House of Representatives cost $18,000 last year, may be
pocket change in California, where legislative seats cost an
average of $600,000. But the trend is similar: Campaign costs have
doubled in Kansas and nearly tripled in California in the past 10
years.
   Experts cite several reasons. Politicians have become more
reliant on expensive forms of campaigning such as direct mail and
television. Competition has escalated. And political action
committees are pumping more money into the political process.
   So long as the PAC money is available, politicians will take it.
Listen to Ross Johnson, a Republican who is minority floor leader
of the California Assembly and an advocate of contribution limits:
``Why do you climb the mountain? Because it's there. Why do you
spend the money? Because it's there.''
   And how do you keep the mountain from rising? The usual answers
fall into three categories: disclosure, contribution limits and
public financing.
   So far this year, at least four states _ Kansas, Maine, Montana
and New Mexico _ have strengthened their rules for campaign finance
disclosure. Such rules presume that the public should at least know
who foots the bills for their public servants.
   This year's changes generally require more frequent reporting.
   Contribution limits also are being tightened. Kansas lowered its
ceiling for political contributions in statewide races from $3,000
to $2,000, and changed the rules so that a PAC or corporation with,
say, three subsidiaries can only donate $2,000 once, not four times.
   Contribution limits are under consideration in several other
states, most notably Alaska, where Gov. Steve Cowper has proposed
prohibiting direct donations to candidates by corporations, unions
and PACs.
   Such donations often are given by lobbyists. ``If money is the
mother's milk of politics,'' said Cowper, ``the people of Alaska
will not tolerate lobbyists owning the dairy.''
   Contribution limits are designed to turn down the spending
spigot, or at least ensure that no single donor controls it. But
critics question whether it lowers the spigot or just forces
candidates to find more wells.
   ``If you just cut the size of the contributions ... you just
make the candidate run harder for the money,'' said Walter Zelman,
director of the California chapter of Common Cause, the public
interest lobbying group. ``They become more obsessed than ever.''
   One cure for the obsession is a limit on actual campaign
spending. But the Supreme Court has ruled that states can do this
only if they also provide public financing to the candidates. This
is the solution preferred by many reformers.
   So far, 22 states have some form of public campaign funding,
according to Herbert Alexander, a political science professor at
the University of Southern California. Maine voters will decide in
November whether to add their state to the list.
   Several cities have enacted public financing, including New York
City, which is in the midst of its first taxpayer-financed
campaign. If nothing else, it has proven that there is nothing
sterile or dull about publicly financed campaigns _ and that they
aren't necessarily cheap.
   Under the New York law, publicly financed candidates for mayor
can spend $6 million in the primary and general elections combined.
They can get up to half that money in public funds if they take the
rest in small amounts from individual voters.
   ``This law helps ensure that it is the breadth of a candidate's
support, not the depth of their pocketbook, that makes a viable
campaign,'' said City Councilwoman Ruth Messinger, who has received
$281,000 in public funds so far in her race for Manhattan borough
president.
   Even with public funding, it's clear that money and politics
have formed a lasting partnership. That worries many people, but
USC's Alexander is not among them.
   ``I'm in favor of public funding, but I'm not concerned about
the high cost of politics,'' he said. ``Politics is pretty cheap
compared to other things we do in this country. You know, we spend
more on chewing gum than we spend on politics.''

   At the seaside resort of Swakopmund, descendants of German
settlers converse in their mother tongue over wiener schnitzel and

   In the dusty town of Rehoboth, virtually all 20,000 residents
are of mixed-race and insist on being called ``Bastards.''
   Namibia's vast, rugged landscape has only 1.3 million people,
but they make up an anthropological laboratory of 11 ethnic groups
who often put tribe before country and are linked not by culture
nor tradition.
   With independence from South Africa expected early next year,
Namibians still are searching for a sense of nationhood to bond
people who share little but common boundaries.
   Witchcraft cases are tried under a Western legal system.
Mercedes-Benzes and donkey-drawn carts kick up dust along the same
rural roads. Black women with a week's worth of groceries perched
on their heads shop alongside white women in fur coats in this
modern capital.
   At political rallies arranged by the South-West Africa People's
Organization, the faction favored to win November's
pre-independence elections, speeches are delivered in English, then
translated into four African languages.
   ``Namibia is not a nation at this point,'' said Hans Diergaardt,
leader of the Rehoboth Basters. ``There are too many different
groups that have been kept apart for too long.''
   Diergaardt and his fellow Basters, the Afrikaans-language word
for ``bastards,'' epitomize the stubborn independence that
permeates Namibia's multi-tribal society.
   The product of liaisons between whites and blacks in South
Africa's Cape Province, the Basters left that region in search of
farmland and independence in 1868 and settled the deserted
missionary village of Rehoboth, about 60 miles south of Windhoek.
   They identify with neither whites nor blacks and have
steadfastly refused to recognize the authority of the German
colonialists or their South African successors.
   They now oppose Namibia's planned one-person, one-vote elections.
   ``A unitary state in Namibia is not going to work,'' said
Diergaardt, a husky farmer whose weathered face speaks of years
spent in the African sun.
   Diergaardt has threatened to unilaterally declare Rehoboth an
independent state if the Basters are dissatisfied with Namibia's
elected government.
   For the past several years the Basters have prepared for such a
move by purchasing land that separates their territory from
Atlantic port of Walvis Bay, about 180 miles away. They've bought
250,000 acres and need about $5 million to secure enough land for a
corridor to the sea, Diergaardt said.
   Like the Basters, the diminutive Bushmen have found little in
common with other Namibians.
   Entirely self-sufficient, the Bushmen thrive in the seemingly
inhospitable Kalahari with extraordinary hunting and gathering
skills.
   They are among the most primitive people on earth, rarely
building fixed settlements or making regular contact with other
groups.
   Most of Namibia's 30,000 Bushmen have begun to join the modern
world, including hundreds employed by the South African-led
security forces as trackers in the 23-year-old bush war against
SWAPO guerrillas.
   Equally untouched by Western culture are the Himbas of Namibia's
barren northwest corner, who wear minimal clothing and smear their
bodies with a rancid mixture of butter and ochre that gives them a
distinctive orange tint.
   The Himbas have repeatedly rejected Western missionaries, while
their cousins, the Hereros, accepted them to such an extent that
the women still dress in brightly colored 19th-century Victorian
dresses that seem incongruous in Namibia's scorching climate.
   Most of the original missionaries and settlers were Germans,
whose influence remains strong.
   The Atlantic town of Swakopmund features turn-of-the-century
German architecture set against the alien terrain of the Namib
Desert. Visitors are more likely to be greeted in German than the
official languages of English and Afrikaans.
   German descendents, who account for about 20,000 of Namibia's
75,000 whites, are prominent in business throughout the territory,
but generally stay out of Namibia's tangled politics, which until
recently included 47 parties.
   Far from Swakopmund's European charm, the Kavango people of
northeastern Namibia remain wedded to tribal customs.
   In one case, a suspected Kavango arsonist received the
traditional punishment from his tribal elders _ he was ordered to
dig his own grave then lie in it, where he was buried alive,
according to court records.
   Three tribal elders were convicted of the killing, but received
only suspended sentences.
   Suspected witches have been thrown into rivers with stones tied
around their necks. If they drown, it is considered proof they were
witches; if they survive, then they were falsely accused, according
to tradition.
   Namibia abandoned most of its segregation laws in the late
1970's and early 1980's, and the racial climate is more relaxed
than in neighboring South Africa.
   But under South Africa rule, Namibia's tribal differences were
formalized with the creation of 11 separate ethnic governments that
had considerable autonomy.
   Namibia's first independent government will face the difficult
task of establishing itself as a national authority that remains
sensitive to local customs.

<HEAD>Park Service Historian To Recommend Landmark Status For Massacre
Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRESTON, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Park Service's chief
historian says the site of one of the worst Indian massacres
deserves national landmark status.
   Edwin C. Bearss also said he supports renaming the event, now
known as the Battle of Bear River, as the Bear River Massacre.
   More than 400 Indian men, women and children were slaughtered
during the little known fight between the Northwest Shoshoni Tribe
and U.S. Army California volunteers on Jan. 27, 1863.
   The attack took place after white settlers complained of cattle
thefts and the abduction of a boy, who later was retrieved and
returned to his family.
   The soldiers struck before dawn as the Indians slept, going from
tepee to tepee and shooting the victims. Fourteen soldiers were
killed.
   Bearss told some 50 residents on Saturday that he would
recommend landmark status for the site to the Secretary of the
Interior, and undertake a study for the Park Service at the request
of Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho.
   Legislatures in Utah and Idaho have passed resolutions
supporting national landmark status for the area in the northern
end of the Cache Valley, which lies across the state line.
   Bearss said the only thing that would stop him from pursuing
landmark designation would be major opposition from the owners of
the 600 to 800 acres of land in the vicinity.
   During the meeting, several property owners asked about
management of the property if it is designated a landmark.
   Bearss said people who live and farm in the area ``can go on
with their current activities, and future development directly
related to farming would not be prohibited by the designation.''
   Although landmark status is prestigious, the Park Service gives
only a certificate and plaque once it has been granted, he said.
   ``There is no federal funding for development, which would only
occur if your congressional delegation can get legislation passed
supporting National Monument status,'' Bearss said.
   Allie Hansen, president of the Bear River-Battle Creek Monument
Association, formed last year to work for recognition of the
massacre, said, ``All members of our committee feel it is important
that the study tells the Indian side of the story.''

<DATELINE>MADISON, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contra leader Adolfo Calero said he won't
ask the guerrilla group to disband before the February elections in
Nicaragua, which he said he did not expect to be free despite a
pledge by the Sandinistas.
   ``We are ready to exchange our weapons for democracy,'' said
Calero, a leader of the Contra directorate, ``but we are not ready
to exchange weapons for promises.''
   Calero spoke Saturday to the annual convention of the Civilian
Materiel Assistance, a group based in Decatur, Ala., that has
furnished supplies to the Contras since 1983.
   Five Central American presidents at a summit meeting Sunday
failed to agree on a timetable for their earlier agreement that the
Nicaraguan rebels be dismantled.
   Calero said he is prepared to return to Nicaragua to be a
candidate in the elections, but said the Contras will ``remain in
the hills'' regardless of what President Daniel Ortega or the U.S.
government decide.
   The Bush administration has said it wants to have the Contras,
most of whom are based in Honduras, remain intact until the
elections.
   Civilian Materiel Assistance's chairman, Tom Posey, was indicted
with five other men for violating the U.S. Neutrality Act in 1984
and 1985. The charges were dismissed July 13 by a Miami judge who
noted that the U.S. government was waging an illegal war, organized
by national security official Oliver North, at the time.
   Calero said Posey's group ``made a great difference'' because it
provided American support at times when Congress refused to provide
aid.
   ``The CMA people believe freedom just doesn't happen,'' said
Calero.

<HEAD>Former Suspect Says Sheppard Involved in Wife's Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Samuel H. Sheppard was involved in the 1954
murder of his wife, contrary to his acquittal in the widely
publicized case, according to a one-time suspect who is awaiting
sentencing for an unrelated murder.
   Sheppard, a prominent osteopath in the Cleveland suburb of Bay
Village, was convicted of murder in the bludgeoning of his pregnant
wife, Marilyn. He served nine years in prison before the U.S.
Supreme Court in 1966 reversed the conviction because of
sensational pretrial publicity.
   Sheppard was acquitted after a second trial. The case remains
unsolved. Sheppard died in 1970 at ago 46.
   ``Dr. Sam is guilty of the act being done, but he didn't do
it,'' Richard C. Eberling was quoted as saying in an interview
published Sunday in The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer.
   Asked whether that meant Sheppard hired a killer, Eberling said:
``I am not going to tell you. But I know the circumstances
surrounding her death.''
   Eberling, 59, and Oscar B. Henderson, 60, were convicted July 6
of aggravated murder in the 1984 beating death of Ethel May Durkin,
90, of Lakewood.
   Prosecutors said Eberling and Henderson created a false will
that left them the bulk of Durkin's $1.5 million estate. A judge
has ordered the return of $650,000.
   ``I am not guilty of her death,'' Eberling said, ``nor the death
of Marilyn Sheppard. I am going to be a suspect in every unsolved
murder of elderly women in these parts.''
   Sheppard's older brother, Stephen, a San Diego psychiatrist,
contends that Eberling should still be a suspect in Marilyn
Sheppard's death. Sheppard's son, Samuel R. Sheppard, told The
Plain Dealer that his father was innocent.
   Eberling worked for the Sheppards as a window washer and was
questioned about Mrs. Sheppard's death. Spatters of his blood were
found in the house, but Eberling said he cut himself while working
two days before the killing.
   Eberling and Henderson are scheduled to be sentenced for the
Durkin slaying Aug. 15. Both said they did not receive a fair trial
because of media hype and planned to appeal.

<HEAD>Central American Presidents Stymied by Contra Timetable</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TELA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stymied by repeated attempts to reach
agreement on a timetable to disband the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan
rebels, five Central American presidents meet today to conclude
their three-day summit.
   ``There is no accord about a timetable, but there is agreement
on mechanisms,'' the president of Honduras, Jose Azcona, said
Sunday night in this beach resort.
   Azcona and the presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala
and Costa Rica agreed in February to engineer the demobilization of
the U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, but they put off coming
up with a specific plan until this meeting.
   The U.S. government was not invited to participate in the talks
but sent four observers.
   About 11,000 Contra fighters and their families are in camps in
Honduras near the Nicaraguan border.
   Azcona said the talks had three main points: a timetable on the
Contras, El Salvador's 9-year-old civil war and Nicaragua's case
against Honduras, which has let the Contras operate from its
territory for years, at the World Court in The Hague.
   Azcona did not provide details about the talks nor did foreign
ministers questioned by reporters Sunday during breaks in the talks
at the Hotel Telamar, a collection of weatherbeaten wood-frame
bungalows 200 miles north of Tegucigalpa, the capital.
   ``There are two plans,'' for demobilization, Azcona said. ``We
need to finalize them and create one.''
   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace
prize for initiating regional peace talks, said Nicaragua's leftist
government must open talks with the Contras because ``it's not
possible to achieve a voluntary demobilization without a dialogue.''
   He added that, ``The world is expecting much from us,
principally the 28 million Central Americans who don't want war.
Not to advance would be to betray those hopes.''
   Nicaragua came to the summit armed with an accord with its
internal opposition parties calling for Contra demobilization. The
accord also calls for the Sandinista government to free elections
next February.
   Ortega has said he expects a ``gradual'' resettlement of the
Contras.
   El Salvador's new rightist president, Alfredo Cristiani, came to
the talks hoping to link Contra demobilization to the civil war
with leftist rebels in his country. El Salvador accuses Nicaragua
of arming the rebels.
   Ortega presented his counterparts with a letter from the
Salvadoran rebels asking for help in negotiating their conflict.
   The Bush administration lobbied Central American governments to
keep the Contras intact until the Feb. 25, 1990, elections in
Nicaragua.
   Meanwhile, Contra leader Adolfo Calero said he won't ask the
guerrilla group to disband before the February elections, which he
said he did not expect to be free despite a pledge by the
Sandinistas.
   ``We are ready to exchange our weapons for democracy,'' said
Calero, ``but we are not ready to exchange weapons for promises.''
   Calero spoke Saturday in Madison, Ala., to the annual convention
of the Civilian Materiel Assistance, an Alabama group that has
furnished supplies to the Contras since 1983.
   Azcona said the U.S. government had supplied documents to the
leaders, but had not tried to influence events despite the presence
of the U.S. observers.
   ``There was no pressure,'' he said.
   Paul Reichler, an American who advises the Nicaraguan
government, said demobilizing the Contras would be good for the
United States.
   ``If this plan works ... it will solve a major problem for the
United States'' on what do do with the stranded Contras.
   A shaky cease-fire has been in effect between the Sandinistas
and the Contras since last spring when U.S. military aid ended.
Humanitarian aid continues.
   The Contras have been fighting the leftist Sandinistas since
1981, alleging the government betrayed the goals of the 1979
revolution that ousted dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979.
   El Salvador's civil war has left 70,000 dead, while 50,000
people have been killed in Nicaragua's conflict.

<HEAD>Death Sentence for Six in Maldives Coup Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six Sri Lankans convicted of
participating in an attempted coup in the Maldives last year have
been sentenced to death, a Maldivian official said today.
   Mohammed Ahmed, a Maldivian Foreign Ministry official, said the
sentences were ordered Sunday by the high court in Male, capital of
the Maldives.
   Sources in Male who spoke on condition of anonymity said Chief
Justice Moosa Fathy read the sentences at a public hearing after
nearly two months of trial. No dates were set for the executions,
they said.
   Ahmed said there was no higher court of appeal and that only
President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom could commute the sentences.
   The last death sentence carried out in the Maldives was in 1953,
he said when contacted by telephone from New Delhi.
   The Maldives, a string of coral islands in the Indian Ocean, are
about 500 miles southwest of Sri Lanka and roughly the same
distance south of India.
   Eight other Sri Lankans were sentenced to jail terms, Ahmed
said. He said he did not know the exact terms.
   A total of 68 Sri Lankans and seven Maldivians were arrested
after the Nov. 3 coup attempt, which was crushed by Indian
paratroopers responding to a call for help from Gayoom. At least 17
people, mosty local residents, were killed in the fighting.
   The Maldivian government has said the Sri Lankans were
mercenaries and belonged to a Sri Lankan guerrilla group, the
People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam, which participated
in a Tamil separatist war against Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority.
   Ahmed said the others accused were to appear in court later this
week for verdicts and sentencing.
   The coup was led by Abdullah Luthufi, a Sri Lanka-based
Maldivian. Ahmed said Luthufi has appeared in court but that no
decision has been made in his case.

<HEAD>Investigator: Torn Seam May Have Killed Balloonist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hot air balloon that collapsed and
plunged 2,000 feet, killing its pilot, had one torn seam and others
``virtually coming apart,'' a National Transportation Safety Board
investigator said.
   Robert Mock, 52, of Paonia, Colo., died shortly after Saturday
night's competition began at the National Hot Air Balloon
Championships. His wife said Mock would have wanted the matches to
go on through Aug. 13 as scheduled at the State Fairgrounds in
Baton Rouge.
   ``He would not have wanted this to end the competition,'' said
Charlene Mock.
   Some of roughly 100 competing balloonists said they were eager
to resume the matches, but not quite so venturesome.
   ``We're like sand fiddler crabs. We'll be out in the morning. We
may not fly as high, though,'' said Johnny Kreger, a balloonist
from High Point, N.C.
   On Sunday, NTSB investigator Armond Edwards displayed a rip in
Mock's balloon, named Chariot of Fire Too.
   ``That started to open up on its own,'' Edwards said in an
interview with WBRZ-TV.
   He said the rip might have stemmed from the age of Mock's
balloon _ 12 years, compared with a normal life span of 10 for such
craft _ and maneuvering that can put excessive stress on a balloon.
   ``We've been told that people who have observed him that
basically, during a terminal descent and stopping a descent by
burning a lot of hot air ... you can damage the balloon. And
eventually, it becomes very weak,'' Edwards said.
   Investigators also found ``other seams where it's virtually
coming apart right now,'' he said.
   Edwards said the balloon was being shipped today to Dallas for
testing.
   Mock radioed before the 5:55 p.m. crash to say a flap near the
top of the balloon wasn't sealing properly and to warn spectators
away, Mrs. Mock said.
   ``He said, `It doesn't look good.' And I didn't bother him,''
she said.
   A short time later, she related, ``he said, `Clear the people
out from underneath.'''
   Mock's balloon crashed on a strip of grass between traffic lined
up near the fairgrounds' entrance. He died 30 minutes later at Our
Lady of the Lake Medical Center of what a hospital spokeswoman
called massive trauma.
   As many as 10,000 spectators may have seen the crash, said Capt.
Robert Shortess of the East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Department.
   One witness, Southern University professor Moriba A. Karamoko,
said Mock continued to work the balloon's butane burner controls in
an apparent effort to reinflate the craft as it fell.
   ``He was a lot more in control than I would have been,''
Karamoko said.
   Mock apparently shut down his burners about 75 feet above the
ground to prevent the gas cylinders from exploding on impact, said
Jim Birk, the meet's director from Defiance, Ohio.
   Mrs. Mock said her husband took up ballooning less than two
years ago after a 20-year career as a cropduster. His
brother-in-law, Bill Lemon, said Mock had more than 8,000 hours of
fixed-wing flying and about 200 hours of ballooning.
   On his biography sheet for the Baton Rouge meet, Mock listed
only one noteworthy achievement: ``32 years with the same wife.''

   The U.S. dollar rose sharply Monday against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange lost ground.
   The dollar closed at 139.78 yen, up 1.73 yen from last Friday's
closing of 138.05 yen. It opened the week's trading at 139.55 yen
and ranged between 139.10 and 139.80 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 111.61
points, or 0.32 percent, to end trading at 34,630.38. The index
declined 37.82 points on Friday.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's jump to its upswing in
New York last Friday following an unexpected drop in the U.S.
jobless rate for July.
   ``There was some active buying of the dollar by players who are
relieved of the anxiety that the Fed will relax its interest rates
further,'' said a dealer at a major commercial bank, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Washington last Friday announced the nation's unemployment rate
for July was 5.2 percent, down 0.1 percentage point from an earlier
month, reassuring market players that the U.S. economy was still
growing moderately.
   But the dollar is unlikely to keep rising ``because market
players tend to sell the U.S. currency for profit-taking whenever
it approaches the 140-yen mark,'' said a dealer at the Bank of
Japan, requesting anonymity.
   Securities dealers said the yen's weakness and political
uncertainties are depressing stock prices.
   ``Until the new government under a fresh prime minister gets
going, I don't expect a summer rally,'' said a dealer at Nikko
Securities Co., speaking anonymously.
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party is expected to chose a
new leader who will replace Prime Minister Sousuke Uno as Japan's
prime minister.

   The bride wore white but the theme was

Norsworthy.
   ``It might. I've never even seen the place,'' she said.

   A transplanted Dane is trying to
introduce Americans to a wide variety of mustards more typical of
his native Europe.
   Johan Bech uses mustard seed from the plains of Montana and
Saskatchewan in his Classic Sharp, Sweet 'n' Tangy and ``Gee John''
mustards, sold in markets in the Great Lakes region and through the
mail.
   ``The standard salad-type mustard doesn't offer much in taste,''
he said. ``As soon as we've had people taste ours, they are genuine
followers. It's like an addiction almost.''
   Bech, 51, and six employees use a water-cooled, Swiss-built
milling system that grinds the whole mustard seeds into the final
product. Using the whole seed makes a difference in taste and
consistency, Bech said.
   ``Our mustard shows that it has fantastic holding power in the
oven or on the grill,'' he said. ``You can take a basic mustard and
do many things with it.''
   He will introduce a new variety this fall that isn't for the
timid.
   The cherry nut honey mustard is ``hotter than hell _ I tell you,
it scared me,'' he said.
   Born in Randers, Denmark, Bech moved to Canada in 1961 to get
into the furniture business. He began his quest for ``the perfect
mustard'' years ago while in Canada, where he noticed a gap in the
North American mustard market.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister David Lange made a
rapid rise from a backstreet lawyer championing the rights of poor
clients to a controversial leader of international standing.
   Lange, who announced his resignation today amid a crisis within
his Labor Party, had incurred the wrath of both the United States
and France over his outspoken anti-nuclear views.
   Born in Auckland in August 1942, Lange celebrated his 47th
birthday last Friday.
   He became New Zealand's youngest prime minister this century and
the second youngest ever when he won the snap election called by
his National Party predecessor Robert Muldoon in July 1984.
   Known for his oratorial skill, Lange governed through a time of
dramatic change for the South Pacific nation of 3.3 million.
   Lange's Labor government put New Zealand on the map when it
refused to bow to two of the world's five nuclear powers.
   During his government he proclaimed New Zealand nuclear-free,
lost the support of the United States and took on France over the
bombing of the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior in Auckland Harbor.
   He also rattled France with continued criticism of French
nuclear testing in the region.
   Lange's political rise began in 1977 when he won the safe Labor
seat of the northern town of Mangere outside Auckland during a
by-election. Two years later he became the deputy leader of the
Labor Party under leader Bill Rowling.
   In 1983 he was elected Labor leader and 16 months later led his
traditionally left-leaning party to victory.
   During Labor's first term Lange's finance minister, Roger
Douglas, proceeded with measures previously unseen in New Zealand.
Farm and export subsidies were removed, the dollar floated, tariffs
reduced or phased out and six of the government's biggest trading
departments turned into corporations, causing the loss of thousands
of jobs.
   Lange's government was re-elected in 1977 and immediately cracks
began to appear in the Lange-Douglas relationship.
   In December 1987 Douglas announced plans for a flat rate of
income tax, a guaranteed minimum family income scheme and proposals
to make the well-off pay for health and education services.
   Lange denounced the proposals, setting off a cold war between he
and the Douglas camp.
   Douglas resigned his post late last year but was re-appointed to
the Cabinet last week, a decision that angered Lange.
   Despite the ongoing rift and the re-emergence of Douglas, which
political observers are citing as the true reason for Lange's
resignation, the former finance minister offered praise for Lange
today.
   In a statement issued in Wellington, Douglas said Lange led New
Zealand with ``extraordinary distinction through the most difficult
period of its post-war history.''
   ``No Labor government since World War II has accomplished more
than this Labor government under his leadership,'' said Douglas.
   A Methodist lay-preacher and teetotaler, Lange spurned the
trappings of official life by not moving into the official
Wellington residence of Vogel House.
   Instead, he rented a small apartment across the road while his
English-born wife Naomi and their three children maintained a
modest home in Auckland.
   Citing poor health as one of the reasons for his decision to
resign, Lange was treated in hospital last year for a heart
condition and in 1983 underwent a stomach stapling operation in a
successful attempt to lose weight.

<HEAD>Pilot Bails Out Over Everglades, Plane Flies on to Crash in Gulf</HEAD>

   A suspected drug smuggler eluded federal agents by
bailing out over the dark interior of the Everglades during a night
chase and allowing his single-engine plane to fly out over the Gulf
of Mexico and crash offshore.
   Authorities came across the pilot's parachute and some of his
clothing during a subsequent ground search, but the suspected drug
smuggler apparently escaped, said Petty Officer Joe Adams, a
spokesman for the Coast Guard in Miami.
   ``The guy was never found,'' Adams said today. ``We found the
chute, but unfortunately we didn't find the jumper.''
   Petty Officer Luis Diaz said the parachute was found shortly
after dawn Sunday near the border of Everglades National Park and
about one mile south of the Tamiami Trail, the southernmost
east-west route across Florida.
   Diaz said the small plane was first picked up by U.S. Customs
radar as it skimmed low across the Gulf of Mexico, heading for
southwest Florida. By the time it crossed the coast between the
Naples and Fort Myers, several pursuit aircraft from Customs and
the Coast Guard were on its tail, Diaz said.
   ``After he got over the Everglades, the plane began gaining
altitude and began turning,'' Diaz said. He said an infared video
camera then taped ``a big object'' jumping out of the side of the
aircraft at 4:20 a.m. EST.
   As a Coast Guard helicopter zoomed in on the drop area, U.S.
Customs aircraft followed the plane as it flew back toward the Gulf.
   ``After the suspected pilot left the aircraft, we closed in to
take a close look and we couldn't see anyone aboard,'' said Robbie
Viator, a group supervisor with the Customs air wing stationed at
Homestead Air Force Base southwest of Miami.
   He said Customs broke off from the aircraft about 70 miles
offshore. The plane later crashed about 80 miles east of Marco
Island, south of Naples, he said.
   The empty parachute was later spotted, Diaz said.
   The chase was similar to one in April in which a parachuting
pilot was later captured and charged with smuggling marijuana by
aircraft. In that daytime case, federal aircraft chased the plane
until it crashed.
   Sunday's jump site was about 30 miles southwest of where a
cocaine-laden plane crashed early Saturday, killing the pilot.
   The wreckage of the single-engine Cessna 210 plane, which
contained 972 pounds of cocaine, was spotted in the Everglades
several hours after a small plane was spotted on radar traveling in
from the Gulf, said Cliff Stallings, Customs spokesman in Miami.
   The pilot apparently was trying to land in a clearing, he said.

<TEXT>
   Hurricane Dean, packing winds of more
than 100 mph, ripped down power lines, damaged homes and sank
pleasure boats on this Atlantic resort island before rolling
farther north.
   No injuries were immediately reported, but electrical service to
many of the island's 65,000 residents was cut off when the
hurricane hit Sunday.
   The National Hurricane Center at Coral Gables, Fla., early today
discontinued a hurricane warning for Bermuda but warned small craft
to remain in port because of high winds and seas.
   A police spokesmen, Inspector Roger Sherrett, said commercial
flights were to resume their normal schedules today after most
flights were canceled Sunday.
   Forecasters said the storm was expected to stay out of range of
the continental United States but could cause problems for shippers.
   Police Sgt. John Instone of Bermuda's emergency services said
one coastal road was blocked and large parts of the island were
without power.
   About 20 boats, most of them moored in the Hamilton harbor, were
reported sunk or adrift. About 15 homes were damaged from flooding
and winds that tore apart roofs and knocked down walls.
   ``I think everyone was far better prepared for Dean than they
were for Hurricane Emily in 1987,'' Sherrett said.
   No one was killed in that storm, but there was $35 million in
damage, officials have said.
   The winds reached their peak over Bermuda at about 2 p.m. EDT
Sunday, gusting up to 113 mph, said Lt. Caron Ruppe at Bermuda's
U.S. Naval Air Station.
   She said the center of the hurricane came within 15 miles of
Bermuda.
   The hurricane center in Florida said the storm dumped three to
five inches of rain.
   The center said that at midnight Sunday the center of the
hurricane was near latitude 35.0 north and longitude 64.8 west or
185 miles north of Bermuda. It reported the storm was moving north
at about 17 mph and would gradually turn toward the northeast and
weaken somewhat today.
   Dean, the second hurricane of the Atlantic season, became a
tropical storm Monday night, passed the hurricane threshold of 74
mph winds Tuesday and threatened the northern Caribbean before
shifting north.

<HEAD>Six Indicted in `Particularly Vicious' Medicaid Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men who posed as physicians may have treated
as many as 45,000 patients before authorities indicted them along
with four others in Medicaid fraud schemes.
   Two doctors, two pharmacists and two other men who posed as
physicians were involved in defrauding the state of more than
$500,000, Attorney General Neil F. Hartigan said Sunday.
   Four clinics and pharmacies in Chicago, Chicago Heights, Robbins
and Midlothian were also implicated in the schemes.
   The six men were indicted on felony charges of vendor fraud and
theft by deception.
   Two of the men also were charged with practicing medicine
without a license. Oscar Hosenilla, 48, and Babu Rao Surapaneni,
47, performed examinations, prescribed medications and ordered lab
tests and X-rays at health care clinics, Hartigan said.
   Surapaneni practiced at two clinics in south suburban Robbins
and Midlothian from January 1986 to December 1988 with Dr. Chowdary
Adusumilli, 50, who also was indicted. They are charged with
billing the state for more than $40,000 in fraudulent claims,
Hartigan said.
   Hosenilla worked for Dr. Henry Pimental, 52, at the Reymar
Clinic and Englewood Clinical Laboratory in Chicago from July 1985
to April 1988. The clinic was contracted through the Chicago Health
Maintenance Organization to provide care to HMO members. The two
are charged with billing the state for more than $150,000 in false
claims.
   The indictments were returned by a Cook County grand jury late
Friday, Hartigan's office said.
   ``These defendants have not only put people's lives in danger,
but robbed the state of vital funds to provide health services to
people who are most needy,'' Hartigan said.
   George Smith, head of the state's Medicaid Fraud Division, said
the phony doctors treated an average of 30 patients a day over a
two- and three-year period. He knew of no reported injuries or
malpractice as a result of the fraudulent care.
   ``I consider this scandalous,'' Hartigan said. ``People who sign
up rely on (the HMO's) good faith to provide quality medical
service.''
   He said his office was investigating Chicago HMO to determine
whether criminal negligence was involved and whether HMO officials
should have known a phony doctor was practicing in a clinic
sanctioned by them.
   If found guilty, the defendants would have to return the money
they billed the state, and could be sentenced to 14 years in prison
and be fined $10,000 for each offense.
   In another case, Dr. Nathan Potkin, 74, the pharmacist for the
Rivera Nursing Home in suburban Chicago Heights, billed the state
for high-priced medications which were never ordered by the
patients' physicians and never given to patients, Hartigan said,
adding that Potkin's fraudulent claims amounted to more than
$250,000.
   In addition, pharmacist Larry White, 54, submitted fraudulent
vouchers for more than $61,000 for drugs that were never prescribed
at the Larr Pharmacy in Chicago, the attorney general said.
   Attempts Sunday night to reach those named in the indictments
were unsuccesful. Messages left with answering services for Potkin
and Pimental were not immediately returned and phone numbers could
not be found in the Chicago area for the other men.

   Demands for freeing jailed terrorists in a
prisoner-hostage swap has angered many in Israel, where 20 months
of violence in the Palestinian uprising has hardened attitudes
toward Arabs.
   The anger, however, is tempered by Israel's tradition of gaining
freedom for its captured soldiers at almost any price.
   The pro-Iranian Hezbollah, believed to be an umbrella for groups
holding hostages, has demanded that Israel free kidnapped Shiite
clergyman Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid and 450 Arab prisoners.
   The prisoners include two Palestinians charged with slayings
that caused highly emotional public outcry:
   _ Nidal Zaloum, 28, stabbed two elderly Israelis to death at a
Jerusalem bus stop on May 3.
   _ Abdel Hadi Salman Rassem Ghanem, 23, forced an Israeli bus
into a ravine on July 6, killing 16 people.
   Israeli newspapers ran editorials and columns urging the
government to bargain toughly and avoid a lopsided deal like the
one in 1985 in which 1,050 Palestinians were freed from jails in
exchange for three Israeli soldiers.
   ``Israel shall have to hold fast to its position and consider
the price so as not to repeat the mistake'' of four years ago, the
liberal Haaretz daily wrote.
   The right-wing Tehiya party called for a special session of
Parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee to set rules for
prisoner swaps that would block such an exchange.
   Ariel Merari, an expert on terrorism at Tel Aviv University,
noted in an interview that many of the Palestinians set free in
1985 became leaders of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation, which began in December 1987. It has claimed the lives
of 529 Arabs and 38 Israelis.
   ``I think the government made a terrible mistake in 1985. This
was a trauma for Israel,'' Merari said. ``Israel paid dearly and
proved a very unable negotiator.''
   A similar swap this time would cause a public uproar, he said.
   Some Israelis interviewed Sunday at the site where Zaloum staged
his attack opposed a swap.
   ``I am very much against it,'' said Theresa Terry, an immigrant
from London, as she waited at the bus stop where Zaloum's victims
had sat.
   ``They are criminals and murderers who shouldn't be free. It's
ridiculous to even consider it. We should swap more moderate
people,'' Mrs. Terry said.
   Some analysts said that even though opinion polls show Israelis
favor a harder line toward Arabs because of the uprising, many
would ultimately support government efforts to win freedom for
Israeli soldiers captured in Lebanon.
   ``People will be torn apart, but they will do it. They'll see
the families on television reuniting with their loved ones and that
will do it. It will be accepted,'' said Eugene Weiner, a
sociologist at Haifa University.
   Israel has a long record of freeing large numbers of Arab
prisoners for small groups of soldiers. This stems from a tradition
of keeping morale high in the army by making extraordinary efforts
to rescue soldiers from the battlefields or enemy jails.
   Since November 1983, during the Lebanon war, the government has
released 6,024 Arab prisoners for only 15 Israelis.
   The servicemen whose return is now sought are Rahamim Alsheikh
and Yossi Fink, captured near the south Lebanese village of Bint
Jbeil in February 1986, and Ron Arad, an air force navigator whose
plane went down near Sidon in October 1986.
   Aryeh Naor, a former aide to retired right-wing Prime Minister
Menachem Begin, predicted protracted negotiations but said the
war-weary public would be willing to pay the price.
   ``People are sick of everything and want to see some quiet.
After the 1985 deal, people get used to things,'' Naor said.
   One of the Israelis who waited at the bus stop concurred. ``I am
willing to make this trade, with a heavy heart. But the most
important thing is for our boys to come back home,'' said Yaffa
Peleg, 42.

   The U.S. dollar rose sharply today against the
Japanese yen while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell in
slow trading, dealers said.
   The dollar closed at 139.78, up 1.73 yen from last Friday's
close of 138.05 yen. It opened the week's trading at 139.55 yen and
ranged between 139.10 yen and 139.80 yen.
   The dollar now has climbed 3.58 yen in the last three trading
days.
   A dealer at the Bank of Tokyo, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, attributed the dollar's jump today to its rise in New
York last Friday following an unexpected drop in the U.S. jobless
rate for July.
   The U.S. government announced last Friday that the nation's
unemployment rate for July was 5.2 percent, down 0.1 percentage
point from the previous month, reassuring market players that the
U.S. economy was still growing moderately, the dealer said.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the market's
main barometer, fell by 111.61 points, or 0.32 percent, closing at
34,630.38. It had lost 37.82 points last Friday.
   Volume traded on the first session totaled 300 million shares,
compared with 350 million shares last Friday.
   An official at Nomura Securities Co., who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the market was quiet as investors watched Japan's
political situation. The governing Liberal Democratic Party will
chose a new leader Tuesday to succeed Prime Minister Sousuke Uno.
The new leader is to be elected prime minister Wednesday by
Parliament.

   A senior Hezbollah leader says his
pro-Iranian group has influence over kidnappers of Western hostages
in Lebanon.
   The admission Sunday by Hussein Mousawi was the first time
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has acknowledged its relations with
groups holding the 16 captives.
   ``If America is able to help itself and help its hostages by
stopping its support for Israel and by not participating in
anything that hurts Moslems in Lebanon ... this could encourage
Hezbollah to think of a way to help resolve the hostage issue,''
Mousawi said.
   He also said Hezbollah might kill a captured Israeli soldier
unless Israel frees an abducted Shiite Moslem cleric.
   Mousawi spoke at a meeting with foreign reporters arranged by
Hezbollah in the ancient town of Baalbek, 50 miles northeast of
Beirut.
   Reporters asked what would happen to two Israeli soldiers the
group holds if Israel does not free Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a
Hezbollah-affiliated cleric.
   ``If we find out that the interests of Islam and Moslems and the
interests of the oppressed dictates that one of the Israeli
soldiers be killed, so will it be,'' Mousawi responded.
   Israel refused comment on his statement.
   Mousawi said some members of pro-Iranian organizations holding
the 16 Western hostages in Lebanon are ``known to us and we hold
consultations with them from time to time.''
   ``There are telephone calls, hello's between us,'' he added.
   Hezbollah consistently has denied it has anything to do with the
abductions, but the party generally is believed to be the umbrella
for Shiite Moslem extremists holding most Western hostages.
   The kidnappers ``may listen to us more than they would to
Algeria because our voice is closer to them and we're living
together'' in the same areas, Mousawi said.
   Algeria's ambassador to Lebanon, Khaled Hasnawi, has said his
country is undertaking a new initiative to free all the Western
hostages.
   Mousawi denied there have been any negotiations on an Israeli
offer to trade Obeid and Shiite prisoners for three Israeli
servicemen and all the Western hostages.
   ``Let them (the Israelis) kidnap 250 more clerics, there will be
no negotiations. Let them kidnap two-thirds of Hezbollah if they
could, there will be no negotiations,'' he said.
   Israeli commandos on July 28 abducted Obeid, 33, with two
companions from his house in southern Lebanon.
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, another pro-Iranian
group, said it killed U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins on
July 31 because Israel refused to free Obeid.
   Higgins, 44, helped command U.N. peacekeepers in south Lebanon
until he was kidnapped on Feb. 17, 1988. A U.N. envoy, Marrack
Goulding, has been in Lebanon trying to find Higgins' body and
determine the circumstances of his death.

   Spending for food is taking a smaller bite
from the household budget, continuing a general trend of recent
years, according to an Agriculture Department study.
   According to the department's food cost review, Americans
overall spent $411 billion on food in 1988 _ 11.8 percent of their
total disposable personal income. That's down from 13 percent five
years earlier and 13.5 percent in 1978.
   Citing a 1986 survey by the U.S. Department of Labor, the
Agriculture Department noted that the percentage of income spent on
food varies by size and income of family.
   After-tax income spent for food varied from 12.7 percent for
households with incomes of $30,000-$39,000, to 27.4 percent for
families with incomes of $5,000-$9,999.
   Although much has been said about the growing number of meals
taken at restaurants and fast-food establishments, the share of
disposable income on food eaten away from home has risen only
gradually: from 3.2 percent in 1929 to 4.5 percent in 1988.
Expense-account meals are excluded.

   National Urban League President John E. Jacob
has lashed out against the Supreme Court, saying the institution
that blacks once hoped would protect their interests has now become
``a threat to our rights.''
   Opening the league's annual conference Sunday, Jacob implored
the Congress and the Bush administration to lessen the impact of
recent high court rulings that he said were anti-civil rights.
   Unless these decisions are rolled back, Jacob said, women and
minorities ``won't be allowed to play catchup. They'll be stuck
with the effects of past discrimination.''
   Jacob cited recent court rulings: against contracts set aside
for minority businesses, preventing women and minorities from
challenging standing seniority systems, limiting the use of
statistics in proving patterns of discrimination and putting
greater burdens of proof on victims of discrimination.
   ``We call on the president and the Congress to carefully review
the court's anti-civil rights decisions and to frame corrective
legislation,'' he said in the keynote address.

   Airlines are hiring record numbers of pilots,
according to figures supplied by the Air Line Pilots Association, a
labor union. The organization said that large and small carriers
have hired 12,000 pilots so far this year, compared to 9,800 for
all of last year.
   But not all of the new hires are new pilots. Many are moving up
an informal ladder to flying the most sophisticated commercial
jets, resulting in an exodus among military pilots and turnover of
up to 120 percent a year for small carriers. Flight schools also
are seeing more trainers leave to enter the cockpit, according to
the union, known by the acronym ALPA.
   ``The military and the regional airlines together continue to
supply a large share of the major airline pilot workforce, but they
cannot meet the present or future demand,'' said Henry A. Duffy,
president of the 41,000-member pilots union.
   Airline industry analysts estimate that between 40,000 and
60,000 new pilots will be needed over the next decade.

<TEXT>
   The captain of a Norwegian hovercraft
that sails daily between Cyprus and Lebanon said Syrian gunners
tried to sink the vessel when they fired dozens of rockets into the
sea off the Lebanese Christian port of Jounieh.
   Two Lebanese sisters, aged 15 months and 2 years, drowned when a
boat ferrying 16 passengers out to the hovercraft capsized in the
waves churned up by the barrage before dawn Sunday.
   ``I believe we were the target. Firing 40 rockets isn't to scare
you. It's to hit you,'' Capt. Sundsford Asbjorn said in an
interview in the port of Larnaca.
   There was no immediate comment from Syrian forces, who have
besieged the enclave where 1 million Christians live for five
months. They shell the coastline daily to prevent supplies of
weapons, fuel and food from getting through.
   The siege started in March in retaliation for Gen. Michel Aoun's
blockade of illegal ports operated by Syrian-backed Moslem militias
south of Beirut. He was hoping to recover an estimated $100 million
lost annually in customs dues.
   The hovercraft service began in May after regular passenger
ferries decided it was too dangerous to continue sailing to
Jounieh. Under normal conditions it takes 3{ hours to make the
100-mile voyage.
   The blue-and-white hovercraft usually whirs into the dock at
Jounieh under cover of darkness.
   But when the Syrians started shelling it moved offshore and the
passengers were ferried out in small craft.
   At 2 a.m. Sunday the 320-seat Santa Maria headed out to sea to
avoid the shelling but turned back when the boat flipped over about
300 yards offshore.
   ``No matter what risks are involved, you must save people, so I
turned back and put on the lights ... and gave the crew permission
to jump into the sea,'' the bearded skipper said.
   Navigation officer Cesar Abi Aql, 25, swam back and forth to the
raft pulling people to safety but said he couldn't manage to save
the baby girls, 15-month-old Maya Azar and her sister Roba.
   ``I saw the baby girls but I had another passenger clinging to
me,'' he said. ``When I went back they'd disappeared.''
   The girls were later found and pronounced dead on arrival at the
hospital in Jounieh.
   Lebanese passenger Jack Nassar, 50, and his wife, Jumana, who
suffered a broken leg, said they struggled in choppy waters for 20
minutes. Their 10-year-old daughter Miryam and son Maroun, 7, were
among those taken back to Jounieh.
   ``I could hardly talk because I had swallowed a lot of water and
my leg was broken. ... My husband was weeping and screaming because
he thought they were dead,'' Mrs. Nassar said at Larnaca General
Hospital.
   The passengers' suitcases were left floating in the sea.

   Here is a chronology of the latest
hostage crisis:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   JULY 28 _ Israeli commandos seize Lebanese Shiite Moslem cleric
Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid from his home in the southern Lebanon
village of Jibchit.
   JULY 30 _ The Organization of Oppressed on Earth, a pro-Iranian
Lebanese group of extremist Lebanese Shiite Moslems, says it will
hang U.S. hostage Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins in 24 hours if
Obeid is not freed. Higgins, serving with a U.N. peacekeeping group
in southern Lebanon, was kidnapped Feb. 17, 1988.
   JULY 31 _ Israel offers to trade Obeid and other Lebanese Shiite
prisoners in Israel for release of all Western hostages in Lebanon
and three Israeli soldiers believed held by Lebanese Shiite groups.
   JULY 31 _ Oppressed on Earth releases videotape purported to
show Higgins hanged in retaliation for Obeid's kidnapping. Israeli
and U.N. sources express doubts about the date of the videotape,
saying they believe Higgins died much earlier, either because of
maltreatment by his kidnappers or while trying to escape.
   JULY 31 _ Another pro-Iranian group of extremist Lebanese Shiite
Moslems, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, threatens to kill
U.S. hostage Joseph James Cicippio if Obeid is not freed by the
next evening.
   AUG. 1 _ Revolutionary Justice postpones death threat for 48
hours following a plea by Cicippio's wife, Elham.
   AUG. 3 _ The group delays the death threat for four hours, then
``suspends'' it pending outcome of an ``initiative'' in which
Revolutionary Justice demands release of Obeid and Lebanese and
Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.
   AUG. 4 _ Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani says there are
ways to resolve the hostage crisis and that he is willing to help
the United States free the hostages. President Bush says he will
``explore to the fullest'' Rafsanjani's offer.
   AUG. 4 _ Algeria takes a mediating role through its ambassador
in Beirut and Algiers Radio says ``progress in this mediation has
been made.''
   AUG. 5 _ Hezbollah, believed to be an umbrella organization for
the hostage talking groups, denies any connection with
hostage-taking but names five Lebanese and Palestinian detainees in
Israel as among those it wants released along with Obeid. Iran says
it earlier refused a note from the United States asking Iran to
prevent harm to hostages in Lebanon on the grounds ``the content
had nothing to do with Iran.''
   AUG. 6 _ Revolutionary Justice offers to trade Cicippio for
Obeid and 150 Lebanese Shiites plus 300 Palestinians. Israel has no
immediate official comment but officials reiterate that any deal
must include the release of Israeli soldiers.
   AUG. 6 _ A senior Hezbollah leader says an Israeli soldier held
by the group could be killed if Obeid is not released.

<HEAD>Irregularities Reported In Oaxaca Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Violence and allegations of voting
irregularities marked the elections for a new state legislature and
570 mayors in the southern state of Oaxaca.
   Clashes in six towns Sunday between opposition party supporters
and members of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI, injured at least 25 people and prompted officials to suspend
the voting.
   In Juchitan, a leftist stronghold on the Pacific coast, several
parties filed a petition to annul the elections because of massive
irregularities.
   The president of the PRI-dominated state election commission
acknowledged a few ``little incidents'' in the poor and rural
southern state noted for the intensity of its political passions.
But the official described the incidents as minor.
   Polls were to open statewide at 8 a.m. but opened as late as
midday in some areas, Notimex said. The results will not be
released for a week.
   Authorities in the capital said the voting was suspended because
of irregularities and violent clashes in the towns of Huatulco,
Puerto Escondido, Ocotlan, Suychilquitongo, Tamazulapan and
Comitancillo. At least 25 people were reported injured.
   Early returns indicted a low turnout among Oaxaca's 1.4 million
registered voters.
   Spokesmen for four opposition parties said the election-day
problems made a mockery of Gov. Heladio Ramirez Lopez's promise of
greater democracy.
   The Oaxaca elections came just a month after state and local
elections in Baja California and Michoacan that were seen as a test
of the democratic promises of Mexico's new president, Carlos
Salinas de Gortari.
   The PRI accepted defeat in Baja California, which on Nov. 1 will
become the first state in the governing party's 60-year history
with an opposition governor.
   The Michoacan elections, where the PRI says it won a majority of
the legislative seats, are still clouded by allegations of fraud.
Radio stations statewide simultaneously broadcast a statement
Saturday calling for respect for the vote and reciting a string of
allegations of fraud favoring the PRI.
   In Oaxaca, opposition parties on Sunday reported incidents
ranging from missing or altered voter registration lists to
outright theft or burning of ballot boxes. They said the PRI had
removed their supporters from voter registration lists or refused
to let them vote.
   The PRI ran candidates in all 570 municipalities. One small
leftist party ran candidates in 71 of the towns; the largest
leftist party, the Democratic Revolutionary Party, in 68, and three
other opposition parties in even fewer towns.
   The PRI issued a statement late Sunday saying the voting took
place in ``absolute social tranquility'' except for a few isolated
incidents when people without credentials tried to vote.
   The government news agency Notimex said a member of the PRI in
Juchitan took the electoral documents home instead of setting up a
polling place. He finally agreed to set up a poll next to his front
door after arguing with leftist representatives, Notimex said.

<HEAD>Britain and Argentina to Hold Talks, Says Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain is to hold talks with Argentina within the
next two weeks, raising the prospect of renewed diplomatic
relations severed over the 1982 Falkland Islands war, a newspaper
reported today.
   The Times of London, without citing its sources, said Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher gave the go-ahead for talks in New York
after Argentina's new president, Carlos Menem, agreed the
discussions could begin without the issue of the islands'
sovereignty.
   After two months of negotiations between the nations, Britain's
ambassador to the United Nations, Sir Crispin Tickell, will meet
his Argentine counterpart, Marcelo Delpech, the Times said.
   Crispin met Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo in December
in one of the few direct talks between the nations since the war.
They primarily discussed U.N. matters but also touched on the
Falklands issue, British aides said.
   Britain fought a 74-day war to regain the South Atlantic
archipelago from Argentine forces who occupied them in 1982, and
London has pledged not to surrender sovereignty of the islands.
   Argentina, however, has refused to move on normalization of
relations unless there are talks about who ultimately owns the
islands.
   The Foreign Office said today that ``any exchanges with the
Argentinians are confidential.''
   ``When we have an announcement to make, we will make it,'' said
a spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.

<HEAD>Weather Creates New Problems For Western Firefighters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Red warning flags went out for threatened ``dry lightning''
storms in Idaho, and winds whipped flames around a brush fire in
Utah as dozens of fires burned in seven western states.
   More than 900 lightning strikes were reported Sunday in eastern
Oregon, where firefighters had earlier managed to contain the worst
of a half-dozen major forest fires. Crews were sent to investigate
one new fire on the Ochoco National Forest as forecasters called
for more thunderstorms today.
   About 23,000 firefighters were battling blazes on 173,000 acres
in Idaho, California, Oregon, Utah, Nebraska, Montana and New
Mexico, according to the Boise Interagency Fire Center, the federal
wildfire command post.
   More than 220,000 acres have been scorched in a bout of
wildfires that began 1{ weeks ago.
   The worst fires were in Idaho, where 9,000 firefighters and army
troops battled 28 major fires and gathering thunderstorms
threatened to bring new blazes.
   Officials blame dry lightning storms that jolted the state a
little more than a week ago for sparking most of the fires.
Sunday's forecast was for a return of the same.
   ``We have a `red flag' warning on,'' said Laurel Simosam,
spokeswoman for the Boise center. ``Our forecast is for dry
thunderstorms and high winds.''
   Crews in the Payette National Forest were attacking fires that
had blackened 18,000 acres near the mining town of Warren, which
was not threatened for the moment.
   Forest supervisors were sending 400 firefighters to establish
lines on a 11,657-acre blaze close to fish habitat in the scenic
South Fork of the Salmon River.
   More than 120,000 acres of Idaho timber and rangeland have
burned in the recent fires; 31,800 acres were involved in
uncontrolled blazes Sunday, casting a pall over Boise, where the
mercury soared to 100.
   Before the lightning strikes, eastern Oregon firefighters had
consolidated gains made during cool weather last week and were
predicting that many of the 100 forest fires that have burned
82,000 acres would be contained by mid-week. A 10,900-acre blaze
raged next to the Hells Canyon Wilderness on the Oregon-Idaho
border, where rugged terrain slowed the work of cutting containment
lines, said Forest Service spokeswoman Dody Yaccarino.
   California firefighters gained ground Sunday against a stubborn
15,100-acre wildfire in Cleveland National Forest and a 7,000-acre
blaze in the Sierra Nevada foothills.
   In Utah, erratic winds pushed flames past control lines around a
1,700-acre brush fire consuming sagebrush, grass and pine trees in
steep terrain about 30 miles east of Salt Lake City.
   The winds helped the Chalk Creek fire grow 500 acres on Sunday,
but authorities said it did not pose a threat to oil fields in the
area.
   A firefighter was critically injured when a tree feel on him
during a successful battle by 500 crew members to contain the
3,000-acre Pryor Gap blaze on the Crow Indian Reservation.
   In Nebraska, a fire that blackened 3,000 acres of brush and
timber in canyon country near Belmont in the state's northwest
corner was largely contained Sunday, but control wasn't expected
for two to three days.
   Civil defense coordinator Tom Brown said the fire may have been
started by sparks from a passing train.
   More than 100 firefighters were engaged battling a single
800-acre fire in New Mexico, according to the Boise fire center.

<HEAD>China's Culture Minister Reported to Have Lost Party Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese Culture Minister Wang Meng, a popular
novelist who advocated increased artistic freedom, has been removed
as Communist Party head in his ministry, said a report appearing
today.
   The report by the Hong Kong China News Service did not explain
the move, but loss of the party position would indicate that Wang
may be dismissed soon as minister. The Culture Ministry in Beijing
said today it could not comment immediately on the report.
   There has been speculation that Wang has been in political
trouble since the crackdown on dissent began.
   He did not appear with other ministers to extend greetings to
martial law troops after they shot their way into Beijing June 3-4
to put down pro-democracy demonstrations, and he has not been seen
in public since.
   Wang, 54, was hospitalized in early June and did not attend the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee meeting later that month
in which moderate party head Zhao Ziyang was stripped of his post,
the news agency said.
   The minister was convalescing in the eastern province of
Shandong, it added.
   Wang, who has described himself as a ``bridge'' between writers
and the party, has urged more freedom for artistic criticism and
has said the government should gradually loosen direct controls
over cultural activities.
   His appointment as culture minister three years ago was praised
as a sign of more liberal policies toward Chinese artists and
writers.
   Wang was persecuted in the 1950s for ``rightist'' writings and
barred from publishing for two decades, during which he did hard
labor in internal exile in far northwestern Xinjiang province. He
was rehabilitated in 1979.
   The news agency said the Culture Ministry's new party head was
poet He Jingzhi, a deputy head of the party Propaganda Department.
It said Wang's removal was announced by Vice Minister Gao Zhanxiang.
   The Hong Kong China News Service is based in the British colony
and covers events in China.

<HEAD>New Women's Political Caucus Leader: Group Represents Real Pro-Family
Agenda</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People drawn to the National Women's
Political Caucus by the abortion issue should realize the group is
working on a range of women's and family issues, the organization's
new leader said..
   ``We are the real pro-family agenda in this country,'' Sharon
Rodine of Reston, Va., said Sunday, shortly after being sworn in as
the new chairwoman of the 77,000-member caucus.
   In addition to launching a campaign to support candidates who
favor abortion rights, Rodine said the group would push for pay
equity for women and greater availability of child care.
   On Saturday, caucus leaders announced their ``Empower America''
campaign, which will field pro-choice women candidates for
legislative seats in 10 key states: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware,
Maryland, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota and
Wisconsin.
   Irene Natividad, Rodine's predecessor, said target states have
legislatures that could swing in the pro-choice direction depending
on the outcome of a small number of races.
   The U.S. Supreme Court's July 3 ruling in the Webster vs. Health
Reproductive Services Inc., which broadened states' powers in
limiting abortion, has spurred many people to action, Rodine said.
   ``It's the hot issue. People are seeing it's relevant in their
lives,'' she said. ``The timing is right to mobilize people.
There's no question about it.''
   Rodine, 40, ran unopposed for caucus chair and was elected
unanimously on the final day of a four-day convention. She has
served as executive director of the National Organization on
Adolescent Pregnancy and Parenting for the last five years, and was
a founding member of the Tarrant County Women's Political Caucus,
in Fort Worth, Texas.
   About 30 anti-abortion protesters picketed the convention site
for about two hours Saturday.
   ``We believe the majority of women around the country are not
pro-choice,'' said Georgeann McGarry of New Brighton, one of the
protesters. ``They are pro-life and we are here to represent them.''
   Inside, actress Cybill Shepherd told members they should work to
ensure access to abortion for poor women.
   ``It will be a test of our commitment and political will whether
the same rights will be available to an unemployed women in a New
Orleans housing project, the 16-year-old daughter of a coal miner
in the hills of Kentucky or a native American woman living in the
far reaches of Utah,'' she said. ``Their plight must be our fight.''
   Former Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro
told the group she expects abortion to affect political races
around the country.
   ``The choice has to be left to women and it has to be a safe
procedure,'' she said. ``I think that what this issue will do is
mobilize people who care about human rights and civil rights.''

   The U.S. dollar firmed in early European trading
today, following through on Friday's sharp gains. Gold prices fell.
   Foreign currency dealers said the market was thin, but that the
continuing uncertainty over the fate of western hostages in Lebanon
was giving the dollar some support.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 1.73 yen to a closing 139.78. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 140.25 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.9143 West German marks, up from 1.8975
   _1.6520 Swiss francs, up from 1.6353
   _6.4800 French francs, up from 6.4260
   _2.1573 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1300
   _1,377.50 Italian lire, up from 1,366.00
   _1.1770 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1775
   The dollar gained against the pound in London. It cost $1.5980
to buy one pound, compared with $1.6150 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at $367.75 a troy ounce, compared with
late Friday's $370.75. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $367.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $367.30, down from $370.50 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 86 cents to close at $368.46.
   Silver was quoted in London at $5.16 a troy ounce, down from
Friday's $5.23.

<HEAD>Much of Nation Begins to Cool Off</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Much of the eastern two-thirds of the nation began to cool off
today following a heat wave that toppled temperature records in at
least five states.
   The summer break was most apparent for residents in the
north-central United States, where temperatures early today were
generally in the 50s and upper 40s.
   In the hours after midnight, several record lows already had
fallen for the date, including at Kansas City, Mo., 55 degrees;
Lincoln, Neb., 50; Marquette, Mich., 41; and Ottumwa, Iowa, 52.
   Strong thunderstorms developed Sunday evening in east-central
New Mexico, Texas, northwestern Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   Hail the size of dimes fell near Woodward, Okla., along with
wind gusts to 60 mph. Thunderstorm winds also reached 60 mph north
of Crawford, while winds west of Tulia produced gusts to 70 mph.
   In Memphis, Texas, nearly 2 inches of rain fell in 45 minutes.
   Early today, the thunderstorms and showers extended from New
Mexico into Louisiana, with the strongest storms in Texas.
   Storms brought thunder and rain also to the central high Plains
region early today. Wind gusts reached 58 mph in southeastern
Wyoming late Sunday, and heavy rain resulted in flash flooding
along the North Fork of the Shoshone River west of Cody. A house
and garage were flooded.
   Isolated showers lingered from the Carolinas to New England.
   Fair weather prevailed across the rest of the nation early today
with clear skies over most of the northcentral part of the nation.
   The high for the nation on Sunday was 114 degrees at Bullhead
City, Ariz., and Laughlin, Nev.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered
from the southern Rockies across much of Texas, the Gulf Coast
region and Florida, as well as across much of the Atlantic Coast
region. Sunny skies were expected over most of the rest of the
nation.
   Predicted highs: in the 60s across much of the Great Lakes
region; in the 70s from the northern and central Plains across the
upper and middle Mississippi Valley, much of the Ohio Valley and
central Appalachians into northern New England; into the 90s across
the southern Atlantic Coast states and the Gulf Coast region, and
from the southern half of Texas to much of the Intermountain
region; and above 100 degrees over the Southwestern deserts and
inland valleys of California. The remainder of the nation will
generally have high temperatures in the 80s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 41
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 92 degrees at Phoenix.

   About 400,000 people fled to rooftops
and makeshift bamboo shelters today in northern Bangladesh as new
floods killed nine people, Relief Ministry officials and news
reports said.
   The death toll for the past two weeks of flooding stood at 164,
according to newspaper reports. The government's body count stood
at 30, but officials usually are slow in releasing death figures
because of lengthy bureaucratic procedures.
   The worst affected area was Sylhet district, where tens of
thousands of mud and straw houses were destroyed, according to the
Relief Ministry officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   New floods hit 30 villages in the area on Sunday, killing six
men and three children, and marooning 100,000 others. The annual
deluge had already stranded about 300,000 people across a
400-square-mile area.
   ``Lack of transportation is hampering relief work,'' said one
Relief Ministry official. Two helipads that had been built in the
area for relief operations were under 2 feet of water, and roads
and telecommunications were cut, he said.
   Officials said the most severely hit region was the tea-growing
Zakiganj area in Sylhet district, 120 miles northeast of Dhaka.
   They said at least 10 people had died of diarrhea in Zakiganj
during the last five days. At least 1,000 others were affected by
the illness, which is caused by impure drinking water.
   Last summer more than 1,400 people died in floods that submerged
three-fourths of this country of 110 million people.

   Prime Minister David Lange, whose
opposition to nuclear weapons resulted in the banning of U.S.
warships from his country, today announced his resignation.
   The surprise announcement came one day before a meeting of his
left-leaning Labor Party, which last week elected his chief rival,
former Finance Minister Roger Douglas, to the Cabinet.
   Citing poor health, the 47-year-old prime minister said he will
step down Tuesday. Lange, hospitalized last year for a heart
condition, said he is looking forward to a healthy future.
   ``It will not, however, be as prime minister,'' Lange told the
news conference in the capital of this former British colony in the
South Pacific with a population of 3.3 million.
   He said he had ``stopped the juggernaut of the New Right,'' a
barb at Douglas, who was dismissed by Lange last year following a
public row over the direction of economic policy.
   ``It was good to walk out of there (the Cabinet) while they
still clapped me,'' said Lange, who stepped into the limelight in
1984 by declaring nuclear warships unwelcome and stepped down when
disputes over internal economic policies refused to go away.
   Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke said that despite some
policy differences, ``We cooperated very closely and effectively in
bilateral and South Pacific issues.''
   Papua New Guinea's prime minister, Rabbie Namaliu, said from
Port Moresby that Lange ``brought commonsense to Western politics
insofar as it affected the Pacific region.
   ``Even though his tough stand on issues such as nuclear
disarmament and the environment made him unpopular with most
Western leaders, he pursued his policies in the interests of the
Pacific region and its people,'' Namaliu said.
   While political observers said Douglas' re-emergence was the
true reason for Lange's resignation, the ex-finance minister
sounded conciliatory in a statement today.
   Douglas said Lange led New Zealand with ``extraordinary
distinction through the most difficult period of its post-war
history'' and that ``no Labor government since World War II has
accomplished more than this Labor government under his leadership.''
   Lange said his successor would be chosen at the party meeting.
   The New Zealand Press Association said Lange had been expected
to announce today a new job for Douglas, a conservative who was
elected to the Cabinet last week. Lange and Douglas have publicly
feuded since Douglas resigned late last year.
   Lange allowed Douglas to deregulate industries, remove subsidies
and privatize government departments. Lange, however, opposed
Douglas' proposed flat tax for hitting the poor hardest while
Douglas alleged the prime minister was governing in a presidential
style and making unilateral decisions.
   Political observers in New Zealand say Douglas was voted back
into the Cabinet more because of his skills as a hard-nosed,
tenacious politician than his political leanings.
   Lange made it clear today that while he will stay on in
Parliament representing Mangere, an Auckland suburb, he would not
be talked out of his decision to resign and would not accept a
Cabinet post.
   The New Zealand Press Association, citing unidentified sources,
reported that two centrists _ third-ranking Cabinet Minister Mike
Moore and Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer _ were the
front-runners to succeed Lange. Douglas also was seen as a
contender.
   Lange survived two leadership challenges the past year, both led
by supporters of Douglas. In December, Douglas ran against Lange
and was defeated 35-15. Commerce Minister David Butcher moved a
vote of no confidence in June and Lange survived the challenge by a
margin of less than 10 votes.
   Lange, a lawyer, entered Parliament in 1977 and six years later
became Labor Party leader.
   At 41, he became New Zealand's youngest prime minister of the
century and the second youngest ever after he led the Labor Party
to a landslide 1984 election victory over the National Party.
   In 1987, he became the first Labor Party leader in 49 years to
win a second straight three-year term and was expected to dominate
the Pacific nation's politics beyond the 1990 election.
   As prime minister, Lange gained international publicity over his
firm anti-nuclear stance, which effectively put an end to the
berthing of US warships in New Zealand ports.
   Lange announced that his government would not allow nuclear
ships to visit New Zealand ports, despite U.S. objections. His
action amounted to a fundamental shift in U.S.-New Zealand policy,
and New Zealand was excluded from council meetings of the
Australian-New Zealand-U.S. defense alliance, known as ANZUS.
   However, that country has not formally withdrawn from the
ministerial council, despite a threat in April by Lange.
   In domestic issues, Lange's government eliminated farm price
supports and turned government-owned enterprises such as railroads,
coal mines, electricity, the post office and telecommunications
into profit-making corporations.

   Tropical Storm Mac swept across northern Japan
during the night, triggering floods and landslides that killed
eight people and left seven others missing, police said today.
   The storm hit Fukushima Prefecture on Sunday. Today, an
earthquake measuring 5.6 on the Richter scale hit Hokkaido, but
there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
   The earthquake was centered in the ocean near Kushiro, in the
eastern part of Hokkaido island about 530 miles northeast of Tokyo,
according to the Central Meteorological Agency. It said there was
no danger of a tsunami, the dangerous wave sometimes caused by
earthquakes.
   Six people died Sunday when a 98-foot-long bridge collapsed in a
flooded river and three cars carrying a total of 11 people plunged
into the muddy stream, said an official with the Fukushima
Prefectural police who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said the other five still were missing.
   ``Water is all over the place, and we can no longer tell where
the river used to flow,'' said another police official.
   A 23-year-old man died when he fell into a flood-swollen river
elsewhere in Fukushima and a 53-year-old housewife was buried by a
landslide, the first official added.
   He said a 52-year-old man disappeared while helping firefighters
repair the banks of a river in Fukushima, and a seventh person was
missing in Miyagi prefecture just north of Fukushima.
   The storm also left 15 people injured, including 11 in
Fukushima, about 150 miles northeast of Tokyo, he said.
   He said 12 houses were destroyed, 4,042 houses were flooded,
roads were destroyed at 88 places, bridges were damaged at 21 and
landslides occurred at 108 places.
   The storm, listed as typhoon No. 13 as it approached Japan, had
weakened to a tropical storm by the time it hit Choshi, in Chiba,
with winds of 68 mph Sunday afternoon.
   The storm was off Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido
tonight, the Meteorological Agency said.

   President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran
today denied a British newspaper report that he sent a letter to
President Bush on the hostage crisis in Lebanon.
   The Sunday Times of London reported Rafsanjani sent the letter
last week and described its tone as conciliatory.
   Rafsanjani's office today issued a statement calling the Times
report ``a bundle of lies.''
   ``Mr. Rafsanjani's stand is the same as what he mentioned in his
Friday prayer sermon in Tehran,'' the statement said.
   It was reported by the official Islamic Republic News Agency,
monitored in Cyprus.
   In his sermon Rafsanjani said the United States must pressure
Israel to release Shiek Abdul-Karim Obeid, kidnapped July 28 by
Israeli commandos in southern Lebanon.
   But he also said, ``I tell the White House, the problem of
Lebanon has solutions, the freeing of hostages has solutions,
reasonable, prudent solutions ... come let us approach the problem
reasonably. We too will help solve the problem...''
   Rafsanjani also told the United States not to resort to
``bullying and tyranny.''

<HEAD>Founder of Le Monde Dead at 87</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hubert Beuve-Mery, who founded Le Monde in 1944 and
made it France's leading daily, has died at age 87, the newspaper
announced today.
   Beuve-Mery died Sunday night in Fontainebleau, where he had been
hospitalized for the past week after a serious fall, Le Monde said.
   ``He was a great leader,'' Jacques Fauvet, Beuve-Mery's
successor as editor-in-chief and publisher of Le Monde, said on
French radio. ``He had great independence of spirit and moral
authority at the same time.''
   The austere tabloid, its grey expanses only rarely broken by
photographs, became known for its authoritative and complete
coverage of foreign and domestic affairs, complete with footnotes
in tiny print.
   ``Only a constant emulation between those who read a newspaper
and those who edit it can permit the pursuit, with some chance of
success, of this quest for truth which is our principal reason for
being,'' Beuve-Mery wrote on his retirement in 1969.
   It has always been left-of-center, but marked by an independence
from political parties that was unusual in French journalism.
   A complicated distribution of stock guarantees that the Le Monde
staff has control of the newspaper. The staff members also elect
the newspaper's director, who serves as editor-in-chief and
publisher.
   Beuve-Mery was born Jan. 5, 1902, in Paris, where his father was
a jeweler-watchmaker. He was correspondent for the Paris daily Le
Temps in Prague from 1934-38, when he resigned in protest over the
paper's approval of the German invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   When France was liberated in 1944, Le Temps and other prewar
newspapers tainted by the occupation were not allowed to resume
publication. Beuve-Mery was asked to start a new newspaper in the
old Le Temps building on the Boulevard des Italiens near the Paris
Opera.
   He guided Le Monde's fortunes for the next quarter-century,
writing occasional editorials under the pseudonym ``Sirius.''
   Still required reading for the influential throughout the
French-speaking world, Le Monde now has a circulation of about
360,000, down from a peak of about 450,000 in 1979.
   It survived a financial crisis in 1985 by selling about a 12
percent share in the newspaper to its readers. The offer was
oversubscribed.
   Beuve-Mery is survived by three sons, Jean-Jacques, Andre and
Pierre.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian and Christian forces fought
nightlong duels with artillery and tank fire across the capital's
dividing Green Line, and five people were killed, police said today.
   Two of the overnight fatalities were in Christian east Beirut
and three in the Moslem west side, said a police spokesman who
cannot be named under standing rules. He said 16 people were
wounded.
   It was the 12th straight night of random bombardment that has
forced more than one million of Beirut's 1.5 million inhabitants to
flee to safer areas in Lebanon or abroad.
   The latest casualties raised the overall total to 547 killed and
1,300 wounded since the latest round in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil
war erupted March 8.
   The captain of a Norwegian hovercraft that sails daily from
Cyprus to Lebanon said Syrian gunners Sunday tried to sink his
vessel by firing 40 rockets into the sea off the Christian port of
Jounieh.
   Two Lebanese sisters, aged 15 months and 2 years, drowned when a
boat ferrying 16 passengers to the hovercraft capsized in waves
churned up by the Syrian barrage.
   Syrian gunners bombard the enclave's coastline daily in order to
prevent supplies of weapons and fuel reaching the Christians.
   The latest round in Lebanon's 14-year civil war erupted in
March, when Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun blockaded
illegal ports operated by Syrian-backed Moslem militias south of
Beirut that deny the state treasury of aorund $100 million a year
in lost customs dues.
   The Syrians joined their militia allies in shelling the
Christian enclave and also blocked its land exits.
   Police said the Syrian army on Saturday brought dozens of T-62
tanks and BM-21 multi-rocket launchers that can fire 40 rockets a
minute into west Beirut and the hills overlooking the capital.
   The reinforcements arrived amid rumors that Aoun's 20,000 troops
might storm west Beirut to seize Lebanon's central bank, where most
of the nation's hard currency and gold reserves are stored.
   Around 40,000 Syrian troops have been stationed in Lebanon since
1976 under a peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League.
   But Aoun charges the Syrians lost their credibility as
peacekeepers by siding with the Moslems in their fight for an equal
share of power with the traditionally dominant Christians.
   The 54-year-old Maronite Catholic general has vowed a ``war of
liberation'' to drive the Syrians out.
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, King Hassan II of Morocco and
Algerian President Chedli Bendjedid agreed at an Arab summit
conference at Casablanca, Morocco in May to mediate for a
settlement of the civil war.
   Their foreign ministers shuttled between Beirut and Damascus for
two months with a mandate to arrange a peace settlement by
November, but announced two weeks ago that the peacemaking efforts
had reached a ``dead end.''

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years after gleaming silver trains started
rolling along the South's first rapid-transit system, a 1,582-mile
network of 150 bus routes and two rail lines with 29 stations
carries a quarter-million passengers a day.
   The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority has been hailed
for its safety and cleanliness. MARTA celebrated its trains' 10th
birthday with a free-ride day on July 4 that drew a record 435,000
passengers. A revitalized Underground Atlanta draws up to 100,000
extra passengers a week, many of them first-time riders.
   But MARTA has a problem: It increasingly goes where much of
Atlanta isn't.
   When MARTA was launched in 1971, the three suburban counties
that refused it _ Cobb to the northwest, Gwinnett to the northeast
and Clayton to the south _ were largely rural, and it was hard to
imagine subway cars rolling past farms and forests. Those three
counties now hold nearly 900,000 people, three-fourths the number
in the two central counties, Fulton and DeKalb, where MARTA runs.
   Despite suburban traffic that is getting worse and suburban jobs
that go begging because car-less workers can't reach them,
opposition to expanding the system remains. Joining would almost
surely mean higher taxes, and suburban politicians have been loath
to submit to decision-makers in Atlanta.
   But the chief reason given by many opponents is the fear MARTA
will bring crime to their tranquil neighborhoods. That feeling is
widely seen as racism. MARTA's passengers reflect central Atlanta,
which is predominantly black.
   Atlantans may not like to discuss it, but few haven't heard the
acronym explained as: ``Moving Africans Rapidly Through Atlanta.''
   ``The people you hear opposing MARTA in Cobb and Gwinnett ...
they've been pretty open about it. They don't want black people
coming into their areas,'' said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, a civil
rights leader and a member of MARTA's board since 1975. ``It's
blind prejudice and fear.''
   ``We feel its in everyone's interest to have a regional transit
agency providing all the service,'' said General Manager Kenneth M.
Gregor. ``It makes sense, it's much more cost-effective,
unencumbered by the problems of numerous political jurisdictions. I
think that position ultimately will prevail.''
   ``I think MARTA's future is contingent on that,'' said Lowery.
``Its maximum potential will never be realized until we go north to
Cobb and Gwinnett and south to Clayton. ... We at least need five
counties.''
   End-of-the-line stops on MARTA's cross-shaped rail system do a
booming business as thousands of Cobb and Gwinnett residents drive
across the county line and hop on the train. Some luxury hotels in
Cobb have even sent vans to ferry workers across the Chattahoochee
River, which marks the county line.
   But MARTA trains and buses aren't going to cross that bridge
anytime soon.
   ``They're pretty much against it, at least in my end of the
county,'' said Gwinnett County Commissioner Curtis McGill. ``A
number of the people who have moved into the south end are
transplants from DeKalb County, and a lot of them feel like MARTA
ran them out of town.''
   ``Without being obvious, people say that ease of transportation
would bring in `the undesirables' and crime,'' said Gwinnett County
Commission Chairman Lillian Webb, who has advocated at least a
trial run of MARTA buses.
   Even talking about MARTA can be tricky in the suburbs. A
discussion group with Cobb County leaders in 1980 had a ``code name
so folks wouldn't know about it,'' Gregor said.
   But more and more, suburban Atlanta may be coming to the
conclusion that something must be done. A one-mile trip down a
major thoroughfare in Cobb or Gwinnett can take more than a
half-hour, and residents of those counties named traffic as their
No. 1 problem in a recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll.
   The poll found between 54 percent and 60 percent of Cobb,
Gwinnett and Clayton county residents favored MARTA trains in their
communities, although only in Cobb County were a majority willing
to pay the 1 percent sales tax that Fulton and DeKalb County
residents pay for MARTA.
   Meanwhile, Cobb County last month launched its own five-route
bus system. Ten thousand people used it the first week, more than
twice the volume expected for the first three weeks, forcing
officials to drop a radio advertising campaign for fear they
wouldn't be able to meet the demand.
   The busiest Cobb Community Transit route is one dropping
commuters at a midtown Atlanta MARTA subway station. Ultimately,
the service plans 10 routes, including three more Atlanta express
runs. Riders get free transfers to MARTA under a deal that allows
MARTA riders to hop on Cobb County's buses.
   The system, costing the county an estimated $2 million a year,
makes more sense than giving MARTA an estimated $65 million a year
in local sales taxes, said Craig Aronoff, chairman of the CCT
Advisory Board. ``It doesn't look like it would make sense to
provide more than we provide. ... MARTA's the best system in the
country, but it doesn't have all the answers.''
   ``In my judgment, they're fooling themselves,'' Gregor said.
``Ten bus routes aren't going to even dent, aren't going to put an
infinitesimal impact, on their traffic congestion. And starting a
bus system that brings four routes in the city of Atlanta ain't
going to do it.''
   Clayton County has no public transportation. Gwinnett, which has
none either, will vote next year on some sort of mass transit
referendum. Mrs. Webb hopes it will once and for all answer
questions like what the county wants and will pay for.
   ``I hope they'll use reason and understanding, rather than ...
illogical rationale,'' she said, pointing out that the county's
330,000 population will more than double in the next 20 years.
``The sheer mathematics of it says we have got to come up with some
method of handling all those people.
   ``It's inevitable. It's time to fish or cut bait.''

<TEXT>
   Black lay Catholics attending a three-day meeting
took no stand on whether to endorse a separate African-American
rite within the church.
   Leaders of the National Office for Black Catholics and the
National Black Lay Caucus said Sunday they would study written
comments collected at the conference before issuing a statement on
the rite.
   Members of the National Black Catholic Clergy Caucus,
representing priests and monks, endorsed at a meeting July 27 in
Milwaukee the study of such a rite, which would have its own
liturgy and its own hierarchy of priests and bishops.
   Black Catholics' questioning of their role in the American
church intensified last month when the Rev. George A. Stallings, a
Washington, D.C., priest, was suspended for forming a separate
black congregation over the objections of his archbishop, Cardinal
James A. Hickey.
   The executive director of the Office for Black Catholics, Walter
Hubbard, said he expects the tone of the statement to be
conciliatory.
   ``There must be some reconciliation,'' Hubbard said. ``There
must be some healing. I think Cardinal Hickey has been an
outstanding shepherd for his flock. But there's also a deep respect
for Father Stallings. We want to extend our hands to both of them.''
   Hubbard said black lay leaders have plans for an institute to
train lay members. He said a faculty and curriculum are being
formed but no site has been chosen.
   The need for greater lay involvement in the church was echoed
throughout the Atlanta conference, whose theme was ``Creating a
Spirit of African-American Leadership.''
   Plans for a National Day of Prayer for African-Americans on the
first Sunday in February were announced by the Rev. James Goode,
pastor of St. Paul of the Shipwreck Church in San Francisco.

<TEXT>
   Reserve Bank Governor
Gerhardus de Kock, credited with bringing a market-oriented
approach to the country's monetary policy, died today of colon
cancer at the age of 63.
   De Kock headed a commission of inquiry into the monetary system
from 1977-82 which resulted in major changes, but not elimination,
of the practice of government intervention in the monetary system.
   In his last public address, in Durban early last month, De Kock
emphasized the need for the Reserve bank to have the freedom to
control monetary policy without any political interference. He said
there had been progress in the past year, but further steps were
required.
   He was due to have a farewell dinner on Friday after having
announced his plans to retire in October following eight years as
governor. His retirement was announced in June, but no mention was
made of his cancer.
   De Kock is to be succeeded by Chris Stals, special economics
adviser to the minister of finance and a former director-general of
the Department of Finance, but it was not announced whether he will
take over immediately or wait until November as planned.
   De Kock joined the Reserve Bank in 1956, becoming head of its
Economic Department in 1963.
   From 1968-71 he was an alternate director of the International
Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C., representing South Africa,
Australia, New Zealand, Lesotho and Swaziland. He returned to South
Africa when he was appointed one of three deputy governors of the
Reserve Bank.
   From 1977-82, De Kock chaired a commission of inquiry into South
Africa's monetary policy. The commission's recommendations on
changes in exchange rates, savings institutions, financial markets
and monetary policy were implemented by the government.

   Israeli officials, speaking after radical
Shiites in Lebanon proposed to swap a U.S. hostage for 450 Arabs
held by Israel, said today there would be no exchange unless three
Israeli servicemen were freed.
   ``If we won't get the Israelis, there won't be a deal,'' said
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Alon Liel.
   There were also right-wing calls for retaliation if any Israeli
captives were harmed. Rafael Eytan, an ex-chief of staff, said that
if pro-Iranian guerrillas carried out a threat to kill a captured
Israeli soldier, Israel should retalitate by executing ``10 of
theirs.''
   Israel officials said those remarks carried no authority and did
not represent the views of the government.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, speaking on the CBS ``Face the
Nation'' program Sunday, said Israel would not accept dealing only
for the 16 Western hostages.
   Avi Pazner, a top aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said:
``It is obvious we will not agree to a partial exchange.''
   An Israeli source who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Israel would not even start negotiations unless Israeli prisoners
were part of the deal.
   Israeli officials said, however, that while diplomatic contacts
were being made, no official negotiations had begun and Israel had
not yet been delivered any demands through the International
Committee of the Red Cross.
   Asked about the threat made by a Shiite leader, Hussein Mousawi,
to kill an Israeli soldier, Liel said Israeli policy was to hold
Iran and Syria responsible for the safety of the prisoners.
   ``We see Hezbollah and countries that are its patrons as
responsible for the fate and safety of the hostages,'' said Liel.
   Officials said Iran provides money and guidance to Hezbollah,
the umbrella for Shiite groups believed to be holding hostages in
Lebanon. Syria, they noted, controlled the territory on which
hostages were held and could put military pressure on the groups.
   Ehud Olmert, the Cabinet minister responsible for Arab affairs,
said there would be a ``reaction'' if Israeli POWs were harmed but
he declined to give details, saying that could be harmful to
negotiations.
   In addition to the 150 Lebanese and 300 Palestinian prisoners,
Hezbollah wants Israel to free Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Lebanese
Shiite clergyman with ties to Hezbollah who was kidnapped from
southern Lebanon by Israeli troops on July 28.
   Olmert reiterated that Israel would not free Obeid unless
Israeli prisoners were part of an exchange.
   Israeli spokesmen said their comments were statements of policy
and not in response to Hezbollah's offer to free U.S. hostage
Joseph Cicippio for Obeid and the Arab prisoners.
   ``I don't think we should relate to each and every statement the
Hezbollah is making,'' Pazner said when asked about the offer.
   Another official said of the various messages from Lebanon: ``We
don't know how authorized those statements are.''
   Eytan, who commanded Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon,
suggested Israel should kidnap additional Shiite leaders if more
bargaining chips were needed for a prisoner swap.
   ``We have one good bargaining card,'' Eytan said on Israel
radio, referring to Obeid. ``If one card is not enough, we have to
go in one night and bring back a few more cards, and again the next
night. If they threaten, we'll threaten back. Lebanon is a box full
of cards.''
   ``If they God forbid execute one of our people, we have to kill
10 of theirs,'' Eytan added.
   Israel army radio quoted Geula Cohen, a legislator of the
right-wing Tehiya party, as calling on Rabin to put Obeid on trial
and demand the death penalty if any Israeli soldiers are harmed.
   Cohen also criticized the government for proposing to release
all the Shiite prisoners held by Israel. She said a lopsided swap
in 1985 in which 1,050 Arabs were released for three Israeli POWs
planted the seeds for the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   According to unofficial estimates, Israel holds about 400
Shiites. More than 8,000 Palestinians are in Israeli jails in
connection with the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   Army spokesman declined comment on a CBS report that Israeli
troops were on alert along the northern border following a threat
to Israeli captives. the situation.''

   Hajieh Mirdamadi, the mother of Iran's
new leader Ali Khamenei, died the day her son was confirmed as
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's successor, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported today. She was 76.
   Ms. Mirdamadi, who lived in the provincial capital of Mashad,
died Sunday of heart failure, IRNA said.

   Stacey Toran, a starting strong safety with
the Los Angeles Raiders football team, was killed late Saturday
when his car went off a road near his home and overturned. He was
27.
   Born and raised in Indianapolis, Toran played at wide receiver
and defensive back at Broad Ripple High. In college, he starred at
Notre Dame as a cornerback and was defensive co-captain his senior
year.
   Toran was expected to be a major part of the Raiders' defense
this season. The 6-3, 200-pound Toran, a sixth-round draft choice
in 1984, was sidelined for most of last season after suffering a
sprained ankle and broken fibula. In 1987, he was considered one of
the team's best players.

   Hubert Beuve-Mery, who founded Le Monde in 1944 and
made it France's leading daily, died Sunday at age 87.
   Beuve-Mery died in Fontainebleau, where he had been hospitalized
for the past week after a serious fall, Le Monde said.
   Beuve-Mery was correspondent for the Paris daily Le Temps in
Prague from 1934 to 1938, when he resigned in protest over the
paper's approval of the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   When France was liberated in 1944, Le Temps and other prewar
newspapers tainted by the occupation were not allowed to resume
publication. Beuve-Mery started a new paper, and guided Le Monde
for a quarter-century, writing occasional editorials under the
pseudonym Sirius. He retired as editor in chief and publisher in
1969.
   The austere tabloid, its gray expanses only rarely broken by
photographs, became known for authoritative and thorough coverage
of foreign and domestic affairs. Required reading for the
influential throughout the French-speaking world, Le Monde has a
circulation of about 360,000.

   Reserve Bank Governor
Gerhardus de Kock, credited with bringing a market-oriented
approach to the country's monetary policy, died today of colon
cancer at age 63.
   De Kock headed a commission of inquiry into the monetary system
from 1977-82 that resulted in major changes in the practice of
government intervention in the monetary system.
   He had planned to retire in October after eight years as
governor.
   De Kock joined the Reserve Bank in 1956, becoming head of its
Economic Department in 1963.
   From 1968 to 1971 he was an alternate director of the
International Monetary Fund in Washington, representing South
Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Lesotho and Swaziland.

   A flag carried by teacher-astronaut
Christa McAuliffe aboard the Challenger will tour the United States
in her memory.
   It was one of 50 identical flags she carried aboard the space
shuttle, which blew up after takeoff on Jan. 28, 1986, killing
McAuliffe and the six other astronauts aboard.
   None of the other flags was salvaged from the wreckage.
   McAuliffe had planned to present the flags to the 50 states as
symbols of learning and liberty, said Board of Education spokesman
Carolyn Spangler. Instead, the display of the salvaged flag will
later tour the other 49 states.
   The 5-by-4 inch flag with a wave-like red, white and blue

Charleston Civic Center. It was mounted on a seven-foot granite
display topped by a bronze sculpture of the hands of three children

   U.S. and Soviet negotiators today ended the first
talks on cutting long-range nuclear forces since President Bush
took office, and a Soviet representative said they failed to bridge
major disagreements.
   Soviet chief envoy Yuri Nazarkin said the seven-week session
made progress on some technical points. However, he added,
``Whatever progress has been made does not involve, to my regret,
solutions to major outstanding issues.''
   Responding to a Bush administration proposal, Nazarkin said
testing anti-cheating measures before a treaty is complete ``could
be helpful.'' He said Moscow is reviewing the proposal.
   The 4{-year-old negotiations, which include space-based missile
defenses, will resume Sept. 25 after a Sept. 19-20 meeting between
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze in the United States. They are expected to
discuss arms control.
   Both sides have acknowledged that full agreement on a strategic
arms reduction treaty is not in sight.
   A major dispute from the beginning has centered on U.S. plans
for space-based missile defenses, known as the Strategic Defense
Initiative or Star Wars. Moscow links a treaty to what Washington
considers crippling restrictions on such a system.
   Disagreement also persists on long-range nuclear crise missiles
based at sea. Moscow wants to include them under the treaty's
limits. Washington refuses, saying their presence cannot be
monitored reliably. Progress was reported on monitoring provisions
for mobile missiles, but the sides still disagree on whether they
should be allowed at all. The United States wants to ban the
weapons, which it does not have. The Soviets, who have such
missiles, reject a ban.
   However, many details of an agreement have already been worked
out, including mutual limits of 6,000 nuclear warheads.
   The draft treaty covers nuclear forces with ranges above 3,400
miles, including intercontinental missiles and heavy bombers.

   The weather outlook improved greatly
today as a blacked-out countdown advanced toward a Tuesday launch
of space shuttle Columbia on a mission to put a spy satellite into
orbit.
   The mission will be Columbia's first flight in 3{ years, during
which NASA's oldest shuttle was used for spare parts.
   Forecasters said there was only a 5 percent chance of
unfavorable weather interfering with the launch. That was down from
Sunday's prediction of 20 percent to 40 percent, based on the
possibility of clouds lingering in the area.
   ``It's looking very good,'' said Capt. Ken Warren, an Air Force
spokesman.
   The five astronauts received briefings on launch preparations as
sources reported the countdown today entered a planned 17-hour
hold, a period reserved for catching up on any lagging work. The
sources reported there was little catchup to do.
   Because the mission is classified, the Pentagon will permit NASA
to say only that liftoff will occur between 7:30 a.m. and 11:30
a.m. Tuesday.
   The space agency will make the countdown public just nine
minutes before launch and will provide only three brief
announcements during the five-day mission on the spacecraft's
condition and on the landing time at Edwards Air Force Base in
California.
   ``The Defense Department has determined that the longer we can
keep the launch time and the type of payload under wraps, the less
chance anyone has of tracking it and learning what it is,'' Warren
said.
   Published reports and sources who requested anonymity have said
the astronauts will put into orbit a sophisticated satellite to
gather intelligence over the Soviet Union, China, the Middle East
and other areas of military interest.
   Commanding the crew is Air Force Col. Brewster Shaw, a veteran
of two earlier shuttle flights, including a 1983 trip on Columbia.
The other crew members are Navy Cmdr. Richard Richards, Navy Cmdr.
David Leestma, Army Lt. Col. James Adamson and Air Force Maj. Mark
Brown.
   Columbia, the oldest shuttle, will be making its eighth flight
but its first since it was launched just 16 days before the
Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts on Jan. 28, 1986.
Following the accident, NASA concentrated first on making safety
modifications to sister ships Discovery and Atlantis, and each has
made two space trips since flights resumed last September.
   Returning the veteran Columbia to flight status will give NASA
three orbiters to handle an increasing flight rate. Three more
missions are planned this year and nine in 1990.
   Asked by reporters Saturday if he had confidence in riding in a
shuttle that had been grounded so long, commander Shaw replied:
``Absolutely, you bet I do. I wouldn't fly it if I didn't. ... I
flew Columbia a long time ago. It's a great machine and it will be
great again.''

<TEXT>
   A senior U.N. official said today after
meeting with Moslem leaders in Lebanon that ``circumstances might
be more conducive'' now to resolve the problem of Western hostages
held there.
   But U.N. Undersecretary-General Marrack Goulding said that could
be brought about only ``through a long process of quiet and patient
diplomacy'' in which many governments and organizations would have
to take part.
   Officials in Israel, which last week captured a Moslem cleric,
Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, reiterated today there would be no
exchange of captives unless three Israeli servicemen were part of
the swap.
   ``If we won't get the Israelis, there won't be a deal,'' said
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel in Jerusalem.
Right-wing legislators also called for retaliation if any Israelis
were harmed.
   Kidnappers holding U.S. hostage Joseph Cicippio on Sunday
offered to release him immediately if Israel frees Obeid and 450
Arab prisoners and allows 55 Palestinian deportees to return home.
   Goulding spoke after two meetings he held in west Beirut with
acting Moslem Prime Minister Salim Hoss and Sheik Mohammed Hussein
Fadlallah, spiritual guide of Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The Shiite Moslem fundamentalist party is believed to be the
umbrella of pro-Iranian extremist factions holding most of the
Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Hezbollah leader Hussein Mousawi said an Israeli soldier his
group holds could be killed if Obeid, kidnapped by Israeli
commandos July 28, is not released.
   Goulding, who heads U.N. peacekeeping operations, said he has
completed his five-day mission in the Middle East to determine
whether U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins has been killed by
his pro-Iranian captors.
   The U.N. envoy said he did not obtain any solid evidence that
Higgins is dead or alive. Higgins' captors last Monday said they
killed Higgins and released a videotape purportedly showing him
hanging from a scaffold, but no body has been released.
   Goulding said he would fly back to New York ``fairly soon'' to
report to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   ``I would say without claiming to be optimistic, this is
something that many people have said to me, that there are certain
tendencies, certain trends in the international climate which
suggest that circumstances may be more conducive to a settlement to
the hostages problem now than they have been sometime in the
past,'' he said without elaborating.
   Algerian Ambassador Khaled Hasnawi, who also has been trying to
win the release of Western hostages, met with Hoss and later with
Sheik Sobhi Tofaili, a senior Hezbollah leader, but declined to say
if any progress was made.
   Cicippio's Lebanese wife, Elham Ghandour, a secretary at the
U.S. embassy in Beirut, said she felt encouraged by Sunday's offer
from her husband's kidnappers, the Revolutionary Justice
Organization.
   However, one of Cicippio's brothers, Thomas, said from
Norristown, Pa., that he was not happy with the offer because it
did not mention freedom for the other foreigners held hostage in
Lebanon.
   A poll released Sunday indicated that most Americans believe the
United States should negotiate to free the hostages and should
refrain from bombing terrorist hideouts in Lebanon.
   Of the 500 people surveyed in the Time magazine-Cable News
Network poll, 58 percent support negotiations, while 39 percent
oppose such talks. Asked whether they support bombing terrorist
hideouts if innocent people might be killed, 60 percent said no,
and 33 percent said yes.
   Bush reportedly asked Algeria to intercede to stop Cicippio's
captors from killing him. But the United States has refused to
negotiate with what it considers terrorists. It takes no position
on Israel's policy of offering to negotiate with hostage-takers for
the release of captives in Lebanon.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in Mexico City for a
conference of U.S. and Mexican cabinet members, reiterated the
policy Sunday when asked about the demands for Cicippio's release.
   ``If the United States were to get into that game, we'd simply
see a lot more Americans taken hostage around the world,'' he said.
   The proposal by Revolutionary Justice was contained in a
handwritten statement in Arabic and delivered to the independent
Beirut newspaper An-Nahar. The statement was accompanied by an
instant photograph of American hostage Edward Tracy, whom the group
also holds.
   It was the first time Revolutionary Justice has said it would
free Cicippio, 58, a hostage since Sept. 12, 1986.
   The group threatened last week to kill Cicippio if Obeid was not
freed. Israel says Obeid instigated attacks on the Jewish state.
   Less than an hour before the deadline set for Cicippio's death,
Revolutionary Justice said it was ``freezing'' the order and
substituting it with an ``initiative'' calling for Obeid's release
and freedom for Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas held by Israel.
   Mousawi told reporters that if the United States ``is able to
help itself and help its hostages by stopping its support for
Israel and by not participating in anything that hurts Moslems in
Lebanon ... this could encourage Hezbollah to think of a way to
help resolve the hostage issue.''
   He also said some members of pro-Iranian organizations holding
hostages are ``known to us, and we hold consultations with them
from time to time.''
   It was the first time Hezbollah has publicly acknowledged it has
contacts with such groups.
   Of the 16 foreigners held in Lebanon, eight are Americans. Held
longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani today denied a British
newspaper report he sent a letter to President Bush on the hostage
crisis in Lebanon. The Sunday Times of London said Rafsanjani sent
the letter last week and described its tone as conciliatory.

   A rocket barrage pounded northwest
Kabul for the second day today, sending frightened residents
running for cover, damaging the city's only luxury hotel and
injuring several people.
   Officials at Avicina and Alibad hospitals said they treated four
victims, including a 10-year-old boy who lost both legs. The Red
Cross hospital also reported several injuries.
   In less than an hour, about 15 rockets struck within a mile of
the hilltop Continental Hotel. One hit the hotel, carving a
two-foot-wide hole, crashing into the fifth-floor presidential
suite and setting it ablaze before plunging through to the fourth
floor. The rooms were unoccupied and no one was injured.
   Later in the afternoon, several more rockets fell, one setting
off a blaze after apparently igniting some fuel in a business and
residential area beneath the Afghan TV broadcasting tower, perched
on one of the hills surrounding this mile-high capital.
   On Sunday, more than 20 rockets struck within a mile of the
240-room Continental Hotel.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said U.S.-backed guerrillas trying
to oust the Soviet-supported government apparently were targeting
the Continental because they thought Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze stayed there when he visited the Afghan capital
Sunday.
   Shevardnadze arrived Sunday morning and left that evening, the
Soviet Embassy said. He met twice with President Najib but there
was no immediate word on the outcome of the talks.
   Bakhtar, the Afghan News Agency, said 38 rockets hit Kabul
Sunday, killing nine people and injuring 38. Four major hospitals
reported 52 injured.
   The Continental, once owned by the Intercontinental chain, shook
several times as the rockets, with their distinctive whistle and
booms, struck in rapid succession. The lobby was filled with smoke
and dozens of windows were shattered.
   Several rockets also apparently were aimed at Kabul's main grain
silo, where several hundred trucks were lined up waiting to be
unloaded. One appeared to hit close to the silo's perimeter and
another several blocks away in a residential area.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani has accused the
guerrillas of targeting the silo to try to starve the capital's
2.25 million residents.
   Several other rockets fell in the Karte Parwan district, not far
from the British High Commission, which was evacuated early this
year.
   The government has extended the summer holiday because of the
intensified rocketing.
   No group has claimed responsibility for the latest rocketing but
the guerrillas _ who call themselves mujahedeen, or Islamic holy
warriors _ have said they carried out previous attacks.
   The insurgents say they aim at military targets and have accused
the government of firing rockets at civilian targets, a charge the
government denies.
   Kabul has been subjected to almost daily rocketing since late
June. According to U.N. sources, 281 people were killed and 745
injured between June 25 and Aug. 1 by rockets and in a car bombing
in the capital.

   Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole urged civil
rights leaders today to join in an effort to assure blacks of the
education and skills needed to compete in the present-day world.
   ``I firmly believe that we will not totally eliminate
discrimination from our society until we have stamped it out of our
economy,'' Mrs. Dole said in a speech to the annual conference of
the National Urban League.
   ``And we will not stamp it out of our economy until every black
American has the chance to gain the education, the skills, and the
training required to compete and succeed in today's complex global
market.''
   Mrs. Dole spoke a day after John E. Jacob, president of the
Urban League, accused the Supreme Court of ``playing dice with the
lives of America's minorities,'' and said the league will look to
President Bush and Congress for progress in civil rights.
   ``We have disagreed with the new Bush administration on a number
of important policy issues,'' Jacob said in his keynote address
Sunday at the opening of the league's annual conference.
   ``But we welcome the fresh winds of openness it has brought to
our government,'' Jacob said.
   Mrs. Dole noted that on July 25 she announced 14 planning grants
to 12 cities and two rural areas to be used to develop blueprints
for getting ``at-risk youth'' into the economic mainstream.
   ``This is just the type of mobilization that you in the Urban
League have been doing so well for so long,'' she said. ``With all
you have accomplished, however, today I ask you to do more.''
   ``There is an Urban League affiliate in each of the 12 major
cities that received a grant,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``I am requesting
that these affiliates contact civic leaders to become involved in
the planning process.''
   The cities receiving the grants are Chicago, Washington,
Baltimore, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Miami, Columbus,
Cleveland, Detroit, Los Angeles and San Diego.
   Jacob implored Congress and the Bush administration to lessen
the impact of recent high court rulings that he said were
anti-civil rights.
   Unless these decisions are rolled back, Jacob said, women and
minorities ``won't be allowed to play catch-up. They'll be stuck
with the effects of past discrimination.''
   He cited recent court rulings: against contracts set aside for
minority businesses, preventing women and minorities from
challenging standing seniority systems, limiting the use of
statistics in proving patterns of discrimination and putting
greater burdens of proof on victims of discrimination.
   ``The court is playing dice with the lives of America's
minorities, and it's loading the dice against them,'' Jacob said.
   ``We call on the president and the Congress to carefully review
the court's anti-civil rights decisions and to frame corrective
legislation,'' he said.
   The Urbaan League president also called for a war against drugs,
adding that ``it doesn't mean a `Just Say No' campaign, although we
will teach our children to say no.''
   He said the league will press Congress for ``real action to stop
drugs from coming into the country'' and for ``resources for
treatment centers so that anyone on drugs can get off them.''

   A fire in a huge pile of rubbish caused an
elevated section of Interstate 78 to buckle this morning, closing
the highway indefinitely and hobbling commuter traffic into New
York City.
   No injuries were reported and apparently no cars were on the
segment of highway when it dropped about 3 feet, said State Police
Lt. Barry Roberson.
   The fire burned out of control this morning, fueled by a
400-square-yard pile of contruction debris at the Hub Recycling
Co., said Larry Krieger, a Fire Department spokesman. Thick smoke
drifted over the city and Newark International Airport, but airport
operations were not affected, police said.
   The road is ``going to be shut down for a while,'' said Bob
Micai, regional director of the state Department of Transportation.
``The fire was so intense it caused steel beams to buckle.''
   John Hagerty, spokesman for the state Department of
Environmental Protection, said the state had taken Hub to court in
an attempt to make it clean up its property.
   A man who came to the Hub Recycling gate refused to comment.
   The closing of the road caused major traffic tie-ups. The
highway carries commuter traffic from New Jersey bedroom
communities to New York City.
   The fire began at about 1:30 a.m. in a warehouse district.
Krieger said firefighters were having difficulty reaching the blaze
because of a lack of hydrants, poor roads and a web of railroad
tracks in the area.
   Firefighters strung miles of hose to bring water to the fire.

   The front-runner in Japan's race for prime minister
said today the nation should play a greater role in the world,
including helping Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform
efforts.
   A second candidate suggested a ``Global New Deal'' policy using
Japan's wealth to benefit other nations.
   All three candidates agreed Japan's governing party is in need
of rescue following money and sex scandals which contributed to its
losing its majority in Parliament's upper house. Voters also were
angered by a new 3 percent sales tax.
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno announced his resignation to take
responsibility for his Liberal Democratic Party's July 23 election
defeat.
   On Tuesday, the party votes for a new leader who will become
prime minister because of the governing party's majority in the
more powerful lower house.
   The candidates presented their positions today in speeches to
party members that were nationally televised.
   Toshiki Kaifu, 58, seen as most likely to win because of backing
by major party factions, said, ``It is not enough for Japan to
simply maintain the security treaty with the United States and not
to play a more responsible role now that Japan has grown so
powerful and economically affluent.''
   ``We are responsible for fulfilling the world's expectations of
Japan,'' said Kaifu, a former education minister.
   Aside from the Soviet Union's restructuring plan, Kaifu
suggested Japan could contribute to the opening of East European
countries.
   He stressed his determination to rescue the governing party,
adding, ``I believe the LDP's resurrection is the only way for
Japan to maintain freedom, democracy, peace and affluence.''
   Kaifu is running against Shintaro Ishihara, 56, a former
transport minister from the party's nationalist wing, and former
Welfare Minister Yoshiro Hayashi, 62. None of the three has a
strong personal power base in the party, but most senior party
leaders have been tainted by an influence-peddling scandal.
   Parliament is expected to confirm the new party leader as prime
minister on Wednesday. He will be Japan's third prime minister in
slightly more than two months. Noboru Takeshita stepped down on
June 2 because of the influence-buying scandal.
   Hayashi proposed the ``Global New Deal'' to aid other nations,
but gave no details.
   He also stressed the need to clean up the party image.
   ``Public anger toward the party has not calmed down even after
our election defeat,'' he said. ``There seems to be persistent
distrust and anger among the people.''
   Ishihara, a best-selling novelist, declared, ``The party's
leadership still lacks a sense of crisis. It seems as though the
prime concern for many party members is no more than
self-protection. I think the LDP's decline has come to the point
where it can't fall any further.''
   Ishihara is co-author of a recently published book, ``The Japan
That Can Say No,'' and he repeated that theme of independence today.
   ``I am never an anti-American, but we have to get up and say
what we have to say. We should cooperate when we can cooperate and
we have to say no when unreasonable demands are made,'' he said.

   Hundreds of anti-nuclear activists marched on the Tennessee
plant where the atom bomb was born to mark the 44th anniversary of
the Hiroshima bombing while thousands demonstrated at some of the
nation's troubled nuclear weapons plants.
   Recent disclosures about safety and environmental problems at
many nuclear weapons facilities charged the atmosphere at many of
Sunday's protests.
   ``I think it's great that people had the courage and conviction
to come out to this contaminated site and say, `No more,''' said
Carter Ellison, a spokeswoman for Colorado Freeze Voters.
   She was among about 4,500 people who gathered peacefully at
Rocky Flats, the site 16 miles northwest of Denver where plutonium
triggers for nuclear weapons are made. FBI and Environmental
Protection Agency officials raided Rocky Flats on June 6 to
investigate allegations of illegal dumping of hazardous materials,
and a federal grand jury began probing the plant on Tuesday.
   Organizers had hoped to circle the plant but they fell about
13,000 people short of the number needed to cover the 17-mile
perimeter. John Hay, a teen-ager from Denver, released a large
white balloon with a message warning that it may carry toxic
plutonium particles from the plant as his older brother, Steve,
played ``Taps.''
   At the Nevada Test Site near Mercury, authorities arrested 52
demonstrators on trespass charges, said Department of Energy
spokesman Darwin Morgan. Another 28 protesters were arrested for
trespassing at the government's nuclear facility at Oak Ridge, Tenn.
   Demonstrations also were held at the Colorado Capitol in Denver
and at the Savannah River Site in Aiken, S.C.
   In Livermore, Calif., home of a nuclear weapons research center,
a petition drive to make surrounding Alameda County nuclear free
was launched.
   At the Ohio State Fair in Columbus, more than 150 arms control
advocates demonstrated at the Peace Pavillion. Earlier, Gov.
Richard Celeste and his wife, Dagmar, attended a Japanese tea
ceremony there.
   Meanwhile, Paul Tibbetts Jr., the man who flew that plane that
dropped the bomb on Hiroshima, said he had no qualms about the
mission that killed about 140,000 people.
   ``I thought then that if I am successful, I can bring this war
to a quick end,'' said Tibbetts Jr., now 74, and living in Columbus.
   And in Andersonville, Ga., nine American prisoners of war who
died in the Aug. 6, 1945, attack were honored Saturday with a
21-gun salute, the playing of ``Taps'' and the unveiling of a
bronze plaque.
   Police estimated at least 300 protesters marched one mile to the
Y-12 Nuclear Plant in Oak Ridge, where atom bomb technology was
developed as part of the Manhattan Project.
   ``There was a good spirit,'' said Judith Hallock, one of the
founders of the Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance. ``The crowd
was celebrating life.''
   About 300 people demonstrated outside the Savannah River Site,
the nation's sole source of tritium for nuclear weapons which has
been shut for a year because of safety and environmental concerns.
   Ed Arnold and 15 members from Physicians for Social
Responsibility in Atlanta said they were most concerned about the
lack of health information concerning the 600,000 people who work
in the nation's nuclear plants.
   Rita Fellers, with a group called the Savannah River Project,
attacked the weapons themselves as ``more dangerous than they are
supportive to national security.''
   Elsewhere, about 50 people set off on a 60-mile march from
Kansas City, Mo., to Whiteman Air Force Base to show their
commitment to world peace. They plan to take four days to complete
the walk, which symbolize the distance that would be needed to
place side by side the bodies of those killed at Hiroshima and at
Nagasaki, said Maril Crabtree, president of the Interfaith Peace
Alliance.
   ``I just came out here to be here and to think peaceful things
and look for a little serenity,'' said Bob Ellis, 48.
   Sunday also saw about 20 conservatives rally in Greenville,
S.C., to urge early deployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative,
the envisioned Star Wars defensive shield. ``Deploy SDI by '95; No
American Hiroshimas,'' read some posters at the rally.
   ``We believe that development of the SDI research programs will
help ensure peace and security for future generations,'' said Lilly
Lenderman, state chairwoman for Concerned Women for America, a
conservative activist group.

   He's getting older and he trains on
cookies for breakfast and hamburgers for lunch, by Mike Bender is
still the toughest cop alive.
   That's the title he brought back from the World Police and Fire
Games, a week-long competition last week in Vancouver, British
Columbia. Bender has won the title every time since the biennial
games began in 1985.
   ``It was a killer,'' he said. ``But it was worth it because this
shows that cops from a small town can beat the entire Los Angeles
Police Department.''
   Bender is a detective with the Simi Valley Police Department in
this suburb of about 100,000 residents 35 miles from downtown Los
Angeles.
   Although he's 34, Bender asked to enter the category for men 29
and under _ considered the competition's toughest. He then climbed
a 20-foot rope faster, heaved a shot put farther, ran faster and
did more pullups _ 38 _ than any of his competitors. There were 166
competitors from U.S. police departments big and small.
   Bender said this year's competition may be his last. ``I've had
my fill of competing,'' he said. ``I look forward to helping judge
the contest in 1991.''
   Sgt. Tony Harper, Bender's former supervisor, is skeptical,
noting the detective has said the same thing before.
   ``One thing about police work is that we keep getting older, but
the crooks are always about 19 or 20,'' Harper said. ``It's nice to
have someone fit like Mike around.''

   The Town Council president says there's
been no sign of her dog since the animal disappeared a week ago and
a caller demanded she resign to get her pet back.
   Police in this town of 6,700 said they have no firm evidence
Sandra Johanson's 7-year-old golden retriever Kelly was dognapped
but that there's a good chance the call was genuine.
   Johanson said her two dogs went for a romp outdoors a week ago
today, and Kelly failed to return. Shortly afterward, she said, an
unidentified male caller told her, ``Get off the council and you'll
have your dog.''
   ``All I can say is that my husband and I and the kids have been
out (searching) constantly and have turned up nothing,'' said
Johanson, whose love for her dogs is well known in the town.
   The council president, a Republican serving her third two-year
term, has waged political battles with a former manager of the town
dump and a former member of the Conservation Commission, but she
said she didn't think the dog's disappearance was related.
   Police Chief George H. Weeden said there haven't been many leads
to follow. Weeden said the call was probably genuine because
Johanson received it before it was widely known that the dog was
missing.
   The dognapper could face charges of theft and extortion, Weeden
said.

<TEXT>
   India withdrew 875 more soldiers from
Sri Lanka as President Ranasinghe Premadasa called a special
Cabinet meeting to discuss negotiations to pull out all 45,000
Indian peackeepers on the islands.
   An Indian High Commission spokesman confirmed the troops, from
the Mahar regiment, left for home from the northern seaport of
Kankesanthurai on Sunday. The spokesman, who can not be named under
standing regulations, described their withdrawal as a gesture of
sincerity.
   The two countries have been at loggerheads since Premadasa
demanded India withdraw troops dispatched two years ago to enforce
an Indian-brokered peace accord to end a six-year insurgency by
separatist Tamils fighting in northeast Sri Lanka.
   The accord was rejected by the biggest Tamil group, the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
   Sinhalese extremists from the People's Liberation Front, angered
by government concessions to Tamils and an Indian troop presence
they say compromises Sri Lanka's independence, launched a violent
campaign against Premadasa's Sinhalese-dominated government.
   Premadasa sent his Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne and a
six-member delegation to New Delhi on July 29 to discuss a time
frame for the pullout of the rest of the troops.
   The president today called a special meeting of his Cabinet to
discuss Wijeratne's talks with Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and
other Indian officials.
   Sinhalese radicals killed 20 people in the past 24 hours,
military officials said today.
   The victims included four policemen killed when their vehicle
was blown up by remote-controlled explosives near Ratnapura, 45
miles southeast of Colombo, and a government supporter in the
Colombo suburb of Bandaragama.
   Government troops killed a suspected radical in north central
Polonnaruwa district, the officials said.
   At least 4,000 people, mainly government officials and
supporters, have been killed in the two-year Sinhalese rebellion.
The Tamil insurgency has claimed 11,000 lives since 1983.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
accuse the majority Sinhalese of discriminating against them.
   Premadasa two months ago demanded India withdraw all its troops
by July 29, the second anniversary of the peace accord.
   India made a token withdrawal of 620 soldiers by the deadline,
averting a possible showdown between the neighbors.
   India has linked the troop withdrawal to more powers for the
Tamil-dominated provincial administration in the northeast.
   After the New Delhi talks ended Friday, India made a conditional
offer to withdraw 1,500 troops a week, Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry
officials said earlier.

   King Hussein conferred with a U.S. envoy
today on Palestinian rights, the Lebanese civil war and the hostage
problem, the official news agency reported.
   The Petra agency said John Kelly, U.S. assistant secretary of
state for Near Eastern affairs, delivered a letter to Hussein from
President Bush during today's two-hour meeting. It did not
elaborate.
   The agency gave no details of the talks on Lebanon and the
hostage situation.
   Kelly is on his first regional tour since his appointment by the
Bush administation earlier this year. He visited Israel and Egypt
last week. Petra said Kelly also briefed the king on his meetings
with Israeli leaders.
   ``King Hussein affirmed to the U.S. official Jordan's stable
policy for reaching a just and comprehensive settlement to the
Palestinian issue based on international legality,'' Petra said.
   Palestinians declared a state last year in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, territories occupied by Israel.
   The news agency said Hussein reaffirmed the Palestinian people's
right to self-determination ``on their national soil.''
   It also said the king reiterated that no settlement could be
reached without the Palestine Liberation Organization, which Israel
considers a terrorist group.

   The guillotine and piano were scheduled to be auctioned on Sept.
15. They were insured for $52,000 each, police said in a statement.
   Police said the thieves, operating over the weekend, used the
forklift to carry the two items to a truck.
   Hitler received the piano as a gift for his 50th birthday from
the German town of Warnsdorf.

   Clovis Maksoud, the Arab League observer at
the United Nations, expressed optimism today that intense
diplomatic efforts will lead to the freeing of all hostages in
Lebanon.
   ``I think the prospects of success are much more preponderant
than at any time before,'' Maksoud told a news conference at the
National Press Club here.
   ``The negotiations have been intensified,'' he said. ``There is
a better chance to return all hostages.''
   Maksoud credited what he said is an improved diplomatic
environment, ``new developments in Iran'' and the involvement of
Algeria, Syria and the International Red Cross.
   He contended that the abduction by Israeli commandos of Shiek
Abdul Karim Obeid, a militant Moslem cleric, is not a factor in the
potential release of hostages.
   ``If there is to be a release of all the hostages, it is not
because Israel did the kidnapping'' (of Obeid), he said.
   ``The release of the hostages would be the result of mediation
efforts,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   An estranged couple's battle over the
fate of seven fertilized human eggs went to trial today, with the
woman's lawyer contending the embryos are ``pre-born children''
with rights of their own.
   ``The question of how we classify these embryos is vital,'' Jay
Christenberry said in his opening statement at the unprecedented
divorce trial. ``While the couple's rights are important, there are
other rights we must consider.''
   He is attorney for Mary Sue Davis, 28, of Maryville. Her husband
of 10 years, Junior Lewis Davis, filed for divorce in February.
   He is seeking to block her from attempting to become pregnant
with any of the eggs fertilized when the couple took part in an
in-vitro fertilization program six years ago in an unsuccessful
effort to have a child. Davis says that now that they are
divorcing, he does not want to have a child with her.
   ``The position of Junior Lewis Davis is that no disposition of
the pre-embryos should be made until he and Mary Davis agree that
their rights in this very unique material are joint and equal,''
said Charles Clifford, Davis' attorney.
   Before the trial opened, Circuit Judge W. Dale Young said he was
``troubled by the fact that I don't have any guidance to help me
ferret out the right decision in this case.''
   ``But that'll come along, and I'm comfortable that it'll be done
in a professional manner,'' he told CBS.
   In his opening statement, Christenberry said that a central
question in the case ``is where life begins.'' He said the frozen
eggs ``should be labeled pre-born children.''
   Shortly after the divorce case was filed, Mrs. Davis said that
the eggs are the result of years of surgery, tests and injections
and are her best chance at having a child.
   ``I consider them life,'' she said. She also said she would
consider raising the child by herself and not asking for child
support.
   Davis countered at the time that it would be unsettling ``to
know that ... 10 years from now I could be walking down the street
and bump into my child and not know it.''
   Mrs. Davis says she had five tubal pregnancies after the couple
were married in 1979, one resulting in a ruptured fallopian tube.
Surgery was done to tie the other tube before the Davises entered
the test-tube baby program administered by Dr. I. Ray King.
   There originally were nine fertilized eggs; two were
unsuccessfully implanted before the couple's marriage broke down.
   King is recommending the other eggs remain in his control, later
to be donated anonymously to an infertile couple.
   The Davises did not sign a contract saying what should be done
with the embryos in the event of divorce or the death of one or
both partners. King says that was an oversight but that such an
agreement probably could be contested in court anyway.
   The lack of such a contract, and the absence of precedents,
leaves Young with little guidance.
   Attorneys said the case is the first of its kind in the country.
   Apparently the only state with a law on the rights of embryos is
Louisiana, which says they are entitled to the full protection of
the law and cannot be owned or destroyed.

<TEXT>
   Blacks are now swimming in what had been a
whites-only pool, and some said the opening of the waters was long
overdue.
   ``It's about time,'' said Bernard Daniel, 34, who stopped on his
way to a wedding Saturday to witness the end of the Saluda Swim and
Tennis Club's segregation policy.
   A few black families bought memberships, which were sold for
half price because the summer is half over. About five blacks swam,
as did about the same number of whites. The parking lot was filled,
though, with people who stopped for a glimpse.
   Janet Sibert brought her two children and purchased a membership
Saturday. ``I'm happy the kids will be able to swim,'' said Mrs.
Sibert, who works in Saluda but lives in Greenwood, about 28 miles
away.
   ``I want my children to feel good about themselves and know they
can swim where they want to,'' she said.
   The pool in this town 45 miles south of Columbia was closed July
26 following publicity about the club's refusal July 13 to admit
three black youths who were part of a church group that had
arranged to use the pool.
   The land on which the club stands was deeded to the town in 1933
with the stipulation that it was for the use by the ``white
children'' of the county and town of Saluda. The stipulation
remained when the town sold the land to the Saluda Jaycees for $5
in 1955.
   The club rents the land from the Jaycees and enforced the rule.
After the church group complained, the Jaycees ordered the pool
closed until it was desegregated.
   Daniel said that when he and a friend tried to obtain a pool
membership three years ago, they were refused.
   ``I was told it was for white men,'' recalled Daniel, who is
black. Nothing was done at the time, although there were ``people
here who knew it was wrong,'' he said.
   Robert Booth, president of the pool's seven-member board of
directors, said he was pleased that the pool opened under the
desegregation policy.
   ``It's going well,'' he said. ``I feel like (blacks) will start
coming to the pool.''
   Jamie Willis, 17, who is white, said they probably wouldn't.
   ``They think they're not wanted there,'' said Miss Willis, who
was watching and said she was not a club member.
   She also said that the $80 seasonal membership fee might be too
expensive for many people in the mostly rural town of about 3,000
people.

<HEAD>Eds: Inserts new 4th graf, Con men, with news conference quote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Con artists, claiming God is their
co-investor, bilked thousands of Americans out of more than $450
million in the last five years, according to a study released today
by state securities regulators.
   ``Beware of the growing number of investment con artists who are
out to fleece the flocks of the faithful,'' John C. Baldwin,
president of the North American Securities Administrators
Association, said in a statement.
   ``Religiously oriented swindles are one of today's hottest
tickets for investment con artists,'' said Baldwin, who also is
director of the Utah Division of Securities.
   Con men ``will go to any length, including the exploitation of
the person, the church or their deeply held religious beliefs, if
they think it will work,'' James H. McIlhenny, president of the
Council of Better Business Bureaus, told a news conference. ``They
will do anything they can to take their 30 pieces of silver.''
   The national survey, a joint effort of the securities
association and the Council of Better Business Bureaus, detailed
investigations into investment schemes with religious overtones in
15 states.
   The survey said the increase in ``false prophets of investment
has resulted in a surge of state-level complaints from consumers
about fraud and abuse by self-proclaimed `born again' financial
planners, con artists claiming to be endorsed by local and national
church officials, and givers of `divinely inspired' investment
advice about coins, precious metals, real estate and oil and gas
well programs.''
   The alleged scams outlined by the report, ``Preying on the
Faithful: The False Prophets of the Investment World,'' included:
   _A former preacher and Sunday school teacher, now serving four
years in prison, who conned more than 600 investors in 20 states
``who believed they were dealing with a man blessed by God with
extraordinary business abilities.''
   _The former treasurer of a large Alabama church, also now
imprisoned, who took an estimated $18 million from investors who
were promised a return of up to 30 percent a month.
   _Swindlers who bilked 10,000 investors in Utah out of $215
million by falsely claiming connections to the Mormon hierarchy.
   _An oil and gas drilling company ordered by Massachusetts and
Missouri authorities to stop selling stock to investors who were
told the firm would use Old Testament prophecy to decide where to
drill in Israel.
   Some scam artists cite Biblical predictions of disaster or
social chaos to woo investors for phony gold or rare coin schemes,
the report said.
   The growth of religious-oriented magazines, radio stations and
cable television programs has provided schemers with a ready-made
audience for phony advertising claims, the survey said.
   In addition, it said con artists are often able to escape or
delay prosecution by taking advantage of their victims' fear of
embarrassing their church or faith if they report an investment
scam.
   Officials said the survey's results reflect only part of the
problem because it considered only scams where investor losses
exceeded $500,000.
   The survey detailed major investment scams and state
investigations involving 15,000 victims in Alabama, Arizona,
California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Missouri,
New York, Oklahoma, North Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and
Washington.
   Officials said no religious group appears to be more or less
susceptible to con artists.

that the Mexican government has shown a much greater interest in
fighting drug trafficking since the administration of President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office.
   Brady also praised the Salinas administration's economic program
and said a recently negotiated debt-reduction agreement may have
been so successful that a $2 billion U.S. ``bridge loan'' may be
``less necessary.''
   ``I take my hat off to the Salinas administration,'' Brady told
a news conference in discussing the Mexican government's economic
policies.
   Brady was joining Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
three other Cabinet members in talks today with Mexican officials.
Like Baker, he expressed optimism that U.S.-Mexican relations are
on solid footing after a long period of cross-border friction.
   Before the meeting of the U.S.-Mexico Binational Commission,
Brady and other U.S. officials gave high marks to Salinas'
eight-month-old administration for its handling of economic policy
and for cracking down on drug smugglers.
   ``We have seen an enormous increase in the interest of the
Mexican government in fighting the drug problem,'' said Brady.
   Areas where the United States will be seeking cooperation
include increased requirements for reporting transactions, stronger
forfeiture and seizure laws, the criminilization of money
laundering and the idea of making money laundering an extraditable
offense.
   Discussing the two-week-old agreement to reduce Mexico's $54
billion debt to commercial banks, Brady said he thought the pact
would succeed in its major goal of giving Mexico $3 billion a year
for capital investment.
   He said the agreement would save Mexico $10 billion over
previous debt agreements, which involved rescheduling payments and
increased loans but did not provide for any actual debt reduction.
   He said a reduction in domestic interest rates brought about by
the debt agreement will by itself save the Mexican government
another $10 billion a year, and noted that the agreement had
already brought about a heavy influx of capital from abroad.
   He said the United States was prepared to provide a $2 billion
short-term bridge loan to help Mexico while the debt agreement is
finalized, but said `'the capital flow may make it less necessary.''
   He said discussions have been held on debt reduction with the
Philippines, Costa Rica, Venezuela and Morocco, but that two of the
largest debtors, Argentina and Brazil, have not put in the kind of
economic program that would qualify them for an agreement.
   ``They have to bite the bullet and make the tough choices,''
said Brady.
   He praised the Salinas administration for its continuing efforts
to open up the Mexican economy to competition, both foreign and
domestic, noting that recent deregulation of the trucking industry
had reduced rates by 20 percent.
   He said the negotiations between Mexico and commercial banks had
almost broken down several times, ``points in time where people
said, `well, this is just too hard.'''
   ``But the compelling nature of the idea _ the drive to reality _
made it clear that this was an idea whose time had come,'' Brady
said.
   The drug and economic issues were among many that Baker and the
40 other members of the U.S. delegation were taking up during their
day-long discussions with Mexican officials. U.S. officials said
they could not recall a larger or higher-ranking delegation ever
turning up for a meeting in a foreign capital.
   Other Cabinet officials in the group are Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills.
   Also on the agenda for the talks were immigration, law
enforcement, the environment, border cooperation and fisheries,
trade and investment and cultural relations.
   The Binational Commission was established eight years ago and
serves as a forum for regular meetings among officials from the two
countries.
   The Bush administration views Salinas' team as generally more
pragmatic and less ideological than the administration of former
President Miguel de la Madrid, who was succeeded by Salinas in
December.

   A U.N. team arrived in Cambodia today
to investigate the feasibility of forming an international body for
monitoring a pullout of Vietnamese troops, Cambodia's official news
agency said.
   The fact-finding team was sent by an international conference on
Cambodia that opened July 30 in Paris. It is to report back late
this month to the conference, which is trying to end the nearly
11-year Cambodia war.
   The 15-member U.N. team arrived in the Cambodian capital, Phnom
Penh, from Bangkok, Thailand, said the SPK report, which was
monitored in Bangkok.
   The unarmed team seeks to gather information helpful in forming
an international body to monitor the withdrawal. Vietnam, whose
invasion began the war, says it will withdraw all its 26,000 troops
by late September.
   However, without a settlement, the pullout would leave
Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed government fighting a coalition of
three guerrilla groups led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   The U.N. team's leader, Lt. Gen. Martin O. Vadset of Norway,
said Sunday he expects his group to have no difficulties.
   ``All factions and neighboring countries have been very
forthcoming in giving support and have been very helpful to the
delegation,'' he said.
   He said the delegation would spend eight days in Cambodia, then
return for talks with Thai authorities and visit the Thai-Cambodian
border. The frontier area is base for the guerrilla coalition and
guerrilla-controlled camps housing 300,000 refugees.

   The State Department on Monday warned
Americans to avoid unnecessary travel in Sri Lanka because of
political tension and the widespread potential for violence in that
island nation.
   The travel advisory, which expands on an earlier warning, came
the day after The New York Times published a story about a
30-year-old American tourist who disappeared traveling alone in Sri
Lanka on March 28.
   The parents of the woman, Sandra Valentine of New York, have
tried to learn her whereabouts.
   ``There's no area of the country that we would indicate people
should go to without taking appropriate precautions,'' said Richard
Boucher, the department spokesman.
   The earlier advisory listed some areas as safer than others in
the country where ethnic Tamil rebels are waging civil war.
   Boucher said the case of Ms. Valentine is a ``symptom of the
kind of things that can occur in the unsettled conditions, and the
unsettled conditions are the reason that we're putting out the
travel advisory.''

<TEXT>
   The University of Utah's cold fusion
program cleared a major hurdle Monday when a state panel voted to
release $4.5 million for research into the phenomenon and its
potential as a new energy source.
   The 7-1 vote, with one abstention, reflected the objections of
the only two scientists on the panel. The vote allows the
university to fund a National Cold Fusion Institute for research
into fusion and its practical application.
   ``There's going to be lots of hard work to be done,'' said Chase
Peterson, university president. ``It's like being pleased to be
asked to plow 100 acres of sugar beets. But I'm pleased.''
   James Brophy, vice president for research, also announced that
General Electric had signed an agreement providing for
``substantial financial participation,'' but he declined to
elaborate.
   University officials had hoped for months that the Fusion-Energy
Advisory Council, charged with confirming the feasibility of cold
fusion and disbursing a $5 million legislative appropriation for
research, would unanimously approve release of the remaining $4.5
million.
   However, the panel voted 7-1 for approval, with Wilford Hansen,
a Utah State University physicist, abstaining. The lone dissenter
was university provost Karen Morse, a chemist who said she would
have preferred more of the money being spent on science instead of
facilities and administration.
   Of cold fusion, Morse said, ``We can only have verification when
a full understanding of the science is in. I have concerns about
putting money into things other than research.''
   Morse, saying she did not object to the funding per se, moved
unsuccessfully for a line-item review of the proposed budget by the
full council. The council's four-member executive committee already
had screened the budget and recommended passage to the full body.
   Hansen echoed Morse's concern about confirming the research of
University of Utah chemist B. Stanley Pons and his British
colleague, Martin Fleischmann, who claim to have produced a
sustained nuclear fusion reaction in a laboratory beaker.
   Hansen recalled the scientific community's general skepticism
about the experiment and said it would have to be generally
duplicated in order to erase the doubts.
   ``As soon as we have the science, it will send a shock wave
around the world,'' Hansen said. ``You don't need hyperbolic public
promotion.''
   The two chemists announced in March that they had sustained a
fusion reaction by running an electrical current between platinum
and palladium electrodes immersed in heavy water. They later said
the table-top, room temperature experiments generated up to about
100 times the current charging them.
   Fusion involves the combining of atoms and should be safer than
fission, atom-splitting used to produce nuclear power.
   But at subsequent scientific gatherings, Pons and Fleischmann
were accused of shoddy research and criticized for not publishing
enough information to enable others to duplicate their results.
   Council Chairman Raymond Hixson acknowledged the criticism, but
said reports that several universities already had duplicated the
work was impetus for releasing the money.

<HEAD>Crime Rate Statistics Add Twist To Albany Mayoral Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELLIOTT MINOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An FBI report listing the Albany metropolitan
area as the nation's most murderous came just two days before the
mayor faces a re-election challenge.
   Mayor Larry Bays told voters in the southern Georgia city that
the FBI murder statistics issued Sunday were misleading and that
challenger Tommy Coleman hurt the city's image by capitalizing on
the murder rate.
   Whoever wins Tuesday's Democratic primary will have a lock on
the mayor's office _ no Republican is running in the Nov. 7 general
election.
   The latest FBI Uniform Crime Report shows the Albany area had
24.1 murders per 100,000 residents in 1988. The New York area was
second with 22.7. The New York region reported 3,577 murders to 29
in the Albany area, but the relatively tiny Albany metro population
_ 120,560 in relation to New York's 8.6 million _ gave it the
higher rate.
   Assistant Police Chief Bob Boren said 70 percent of Albany's
murders could be attributed to the drug trade. Police say crack
cocaine has become pervasive in the city's poor neighborhoods.
   Coleman, a bank executive, originally reacted to the report by
saying, ``People are living in fear. They have deadbolt locks,
security bars on their windows and chain link fences around their
front yards.''
   Bays said there was no fair way to compare Albany and New York,
and by Monday, he was trying to turn the issue in his favor.
   In an interview with The Albany Herald, he blasted Coleman for
``this mishandling of the FBI's release of its crime report and the
irresponsible statements that he made about that.''
   Coleman said he regretted that too much had been made of the
murder statistics.
   ``Albany is no different than any other city in the nation,'' he
told the newspaper. ``They all have problems with drugs, crime and
they all have certain depressed areas where people have been living
there for a long time and are afraid.''
   Boren noted his officers had solved all the city's murders in
1987 and 1988. ``They might commit the crimes, but they're not
walking around after they commit them,'' he said.
   In other major crimes, the FBI said, Albany had 92 forcible
rapes, 433 robberies, 429 aggravated assaults, 4,493 larcenies and
354 motor vehicle thefts.
   To combat crime, the police formed a major crime squad to focus
on violent offenses, and the city and surrounding Dougherty County
organized a consolidated drug squad.
   In addition, officers have cracked down on loitering in
high-crime areas and are enforcing an ordinance aimed at
eliminating fortified buildings that could be used for drug dealing.
   ``We're certainly not satisfied,'' Bays said of the city's crime
prevention efforts. ``That's why we have the major crimes task
force.''
   Coleman said he favors hiring more police officers, opening
precinct stations and putting more cops on the street where they
can develop a better rapport with neighborhood residents.
   ``I'm committed to a safer Albany,'' he said. ``We've got to do
a better job with our people by providing more jobs. We've got very
high unemployment. Unemployment breeds despair and despair breeds
violence.''
   Albany suffered a serious economic setback a few years ago when
two major manufacturing plants shut down, eliminating 2,000 jobs.

<TEXT>
   City workers who are part of an unmarried couple
will be recognized as ``domestic partners'' and entitled to the
same bereavement leave now provided to those who are married, Mayor
Edward I. Koch declared Monday.
   Koch issued an executive order recognizing ``domestic partners''
as two ``close and committed'' unmarried adults who have lived
together at least a year. Homosexual, heterosexual and non-sexual
relationships are included.
   City employees in such relationships must register to be
eligible for the bereavement leave, which is provided after the
death of a partner's parent or child or of a relative living in the
household.
   ``Over time society changes. So must the government which serves
it,'' Koch said in a statement. He said his order ``recognizes
something that has come to be an accepted and acceptable fact of
life and living in our age.''
   Koch had promised the order last month.
   A similar bereavement law passed by San Francisco's Board of
Supervisors was suspended last month after a petition drive
gathered enough signatures to put the measure on the November
ballot.

<TEXT>
   President Bush exhorted thousands of
Boy Scouts on Monday to steer their peers away from ``this scourge
called drugs.''
   Bush, becoming the first president since Lyndon B. Johnson to
attend a Boy Scout Jamboree, told more than 30,000 scouts and
leaders encamped at Fort A.P. Hill that keeping drugs out of
America's schools was ``perhaps the greatest challenge of our
times.''
   As Bush's Marine One helicopter landed, loudspeakers blared the
theme music from Indiana Jones from a giant stage, drawing cheers
from the huge crowd clad in green and olive. Bush described it as
an ``unbelievable gathering.''
   Bush called drugs ``a form of pollution, a poisoning of the
mind, a corruption of the very soul of young America.''
   Bush said the Boy Scouts have helped out ``through times of
disaster, from fires to flash floods'' and during wartime.
   Now, he said, the organization has already ``taken on a new
struggle to defeat what you call the five `unacceptables' _
illiteracy, unemployment, child abuse, drug abuse and hunger.''
   The president cited recent statistics showing an overall drop of
40 percent in the number of Americans using drugs, but added, ``we
cannot yet claim victory.
   ``The number of people addicted to cocaine and crack has almost
doubled. We must work harder,'' he said. ``I am especially looking
to you to encourage friends to refuse drugs _ any illegal drugs.''
   He cited a first-person account last week in The Wall Street
Journal by reporter Ronald Shafer about how drugs and alcohol led
to the death of his son Ryan at age 16.
   ``There are thousands of Ryans across America, thousands of
young men and women who are in danger of losing their future, their
very lives to this scourge called drugs,'' said Bush.
   ``Ask yourself if you know someone like Ryan Shafer. And if so,
have you done everything you can to help him or her?'' he said.
   Bush, an avid fisherman, told the youths of the pleasure he has
found in the outdoors.
   ``Whatever you love to do _ whether it's hiking, hunting or
kayaking _ hang on to it. ... '' Bush advised the scouts. ``If you
stay true to the hobbies of your youth, you will find a source of
relaxation and replenishment that will never fail you.''
   Bush brought three Eagle Scouts with him from his top staff _
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and White House aides
Andrew Card and Robert Gates _ and said it was ``no coincidence
that half of all astronauts were once scouts.''
   He put in a pitch for his recently enuciated goals of
reinvigorating the space program, including seeking ``to establish
an outpost on the moon and explore the mysteries of Mars'' in the
next century.
   ``You are privileged to be the generation that will witness the
first large movement of men and women into space,'' he said.
   The scouts, from across the United States and abroad, end their
seven-day 12th National Jamboree on Tuesday.

   The last Coast Guard lighthouse
keeper in Maine lowered his flag Monday and an old boat sounded its
horn three times in salute as a lighthouse commissioned by George
Washington became automated.
   ``I can think of nothing more noble,'' said Rear Adm. Richard C.
Rybacki, commander of the 1st Coast Guard District in Boston, as
the Portland Head Light became the last Coast Guard lighthouse in
Maine to be automated. ``The lighthouse symbolizes all that is good
in mankind. We are not here to celebrate an ending. We are here to
immortalize a tradition.''
   It was the bicentennial of the day that Washington signed a bill
letting the federal government start building lighthouses. The
Portland Head Light, a white stone tower, was first lit in 1791,
guiding ships past the jagged rocks that flank the best channel
into Portland Harbor.
   On Monday, light keeper Davis Simpson lowered the flag for the
last time, and the machinery that will turn on the lights and sound
the foghorns automatically were officially in control.
   According to the Lighthouse Preservation Society, the nation has
about 800 lighthouses, but only about a half-dozen still have
keepers.
   The Coast Guard band played and several Coast Guard cutters
gathered nearby in Casco Bay.
   A restored light ship, the Nantucket, sounded its horn three
times and the lighthouse answered three times to honor those who
have operated the tower, which after several remodelings stands 101
feet above sea level.
   Lighthouse lovers were saddened to see the Portland Head Light
go unmanned, yet happy to see its grounds being turned over to the
town of Cape Elizabeth, which wants to make the place a museum.
   Rybacki said the automation was necessary to better protect
ships and to cost taxpayers less money.
   ``We don't row surfboats out to make rescues, and we don't get
our mail from the Pony Express,'' Rybacki told hundreds of people
who gathered for the ceremony.
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, two years
ago wrote legislation that set up the Bicentennial Lighthouse Fund,
which provides grants for preserving and restoring lighthouses.
   ``Standing at land's end through two centuries, they have
symbolized safety, security, heroism and faithfulness,'' Mitchell
said.
   Lighthouse historian F. Ross Holland Jr. said the beacons have
evolved considerably from the days when they began as elevated
bonfires to the 1980s, when some lighthouses are operated by
solar-powered batteries.
   Now, he said, ``The major issue that will face lighthouses in
the future, and probably not too far off, is erosion.''
   Global warming, rising water and shifting shorelines may
eventually take their toll on the towers that guided generations of
sailors, he said.

   The battleship Iowa fired some of its powerful
16-inch guns last week for the first time since 47 sailors were
killed in an April explosion aboard the ship, the Navy said Monday.
   Guns from two of the ship's three turrets were used in the
exercise, conducted Friday in the Mediterranean Sea, said Navy
spokesman Lt. Greg Smith.
   ``The test was successful and without incident,'' Smith said. He
added that the No. 2 turret, the one involved in the April
explosion, was not used.
   ``The No. 2 is still down,'' he said.
   The Iowa, one of the Navy's most heavily armed warships, has
been steaming across the Mediterranean as part of a calculated U.S.
show of military force in response to the current hostage crisis.
   The battleship had not been allowed to use its 16-inch guns
pending the outcome of a Navy inquiry into the April 19 explosion.
   But that decision was modified in June to allow for ``live-fire
training ... to prepare for contingency operations as directed by
fleet commanders,'' Smith said.
   The April accident amounted to one of the worst naval disasters
since the Vietnam War.
   Smith refused to discuss the number of guns used in the exercise
or the amount of explosives used to pack them.
   There are three guns on each of the Iowa's gun turrets.
   Each gun can fire projectiles weighing up to 2,700 pounds at a
maximum range of 23 miles. The battleship also has 12 5-inch guns.
   The battleship is also equipped with a variety of weapons,
including Tomahawk and Harpoon cruise missiles, that could be used
if President Bush orders a military strike in the ongoing hostage
crisis.
   The Iowa was in the Mediterranean to make a port call in
Marseilles, France, but cut short its visit to head closer to
Lebanon, Pentagon sources said last week.
   The commander for the 6th fleet in the Mediterranean, Vice Adm.
James D. Williams, authorized the gun fire training, Smith said.
   Williams, aboard the guided missile cruiser USS Belknap,
canceled a four-day call at the Soviet port of Sevastapol last week
in to oversee the U.S. Navy movements in the area.
   The only U.S. aircraft carrier in the 6th Fleet, the USS Coral
Sea, also is in the area.

   The United States on Monday condemned Cuba's
arrest of four human rights activists, calling the action a
``flagrant human rights violation.''
   Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said Elizardo
Sanchez, head of the Cuban Commission of Human Rights and National
Conciliation, was arrested along with three colleagues.
   Representatives of Sanchez' organization said he was taken into
custody by state security police in a pre-dawn raid on his house.
Sanchez had recently complained about human rights in Cuba to
American reporters.
   ``These arrests come as yet another flagrant human rights
violation in the Cuban government's renewed crackdown against human
rights activists,'' Boucher said.
   ``We hope concerned members of the international community,
including the United Nations, will join us in condemning not only
Sanchez' arrest, but also the continued imprisonment of other
prominent human rights leaders,'' Boucher said.
   In his meetings with American reporters, Sanchez characterized
the executions of four Cuban officials convicted of drug
trafficking last month as ``assassinations.''
   He also claimed that the regime of Cuban leader Fidel Castro has
waged an intensified campaign against that country's human rights
organizations.

   A United Nations team arrived in
Cambodia Monday to study the feasibility of forming an
international body to monitor the Vietnamese military withdrawal,
the official Cambodian news agency SPK said.
   The 15-member team went to the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh,
from Bangkok, Thailand.
   It was sent by the international conference on Cambodia that
opened July 30 in Paris. It is to report back later this month to
the conference, which is seeking an end to the war that began with
Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia nearly 11 years ago.
   The information gathered by the team is to be used to establish
a group to monitor what Vietnam says will be the pullout of its
26,000 military personnel by late September.
   If the Paris conference fails to achieve a settlement to the war
the withdrawal would leave Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed
government fighting a coalition of three guerrilla groups.
   The report by SPK quoted Prime Minister Hun Sen as saying his
government would facilitate the U.N. team's work.
   ``The mission will also examine the state of roads, airports and
communications in Cambodia,'' the report said. ``The officers and
the civilian members of the team are to wear blue berets and U.N.
insignia but they are not armed.''
   Lt. Gen. Martin O. Vadset of Norway, the leader of the mission,
said, ``All factions and neighboring countries have been very
forthcoming in giving support and have been very helpful to the
delegation, so we have no doubt we will be able to do whatever we
like.''
   Vadset, 58, is chief of staff of the U.N. Truce Supervision
Organization in the Middle East.
   He said his team is to spend about eight days in Cambodia, then
return to hold talks with Thai authorities and visit the
Thai-Cambodian border.
   Most of Cambodia is controlled by the Phnom Penh government.
Rebel-controlled refugee camps, which house about 300,000
civilians, are strung along the Thai-Cambodian border.
   Fighting the Phnom Penh government and Vietnamese are guerrillas
of the radical Khmer Rouge, an anti-communist force and those loyal
to Prince Norodom Sihanouk.

   A senior U.N. envoy expressed optimism
Monday about chances of freeing Western hostages in Lebanon, but
predicted ``a long process of quiet and patient diplomacy.''
   Algeria's ambassador, who has acted as an intermediary, said
getting the hostages released might take a year or more.
   Israel on Monday rejected a new demand for release of a
kidnapped Lebanese Shiite cleric and urged Shiite radicals to use
the Red Cross to arrange a hostage-prisoner swap. Israeli officials
said the government would only accept a deal if three Israeli
soldiers were included.
   President Bush was described by White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater as ``cautiously optimistic'' about the American
hostages in Lebanon. However, Fitzwater said, ``He knows that it's
probably going to be a longer period of time rather than shorter''
before the matter is resolved.
   ``Certain tendencies, certain trends in the international
climate ... suggest that circumstances may be more conducive to a
settlement to the hostages problem now than they have been sometime
in the past,'' said Marrack Goulding, U.N. undersecretary-general
for peacekeeping operations.
   ``Many governments and organizations will have to take part. It
will be a cooperative effort.''
   ``It's a very difficult and very complicated problem in which
there are a large number of elements and a large number of players
involved,'' Goulding said in Beirut after five days of meetings in
Lebanon and Syria.
   Goulding met Monday in west Beirut with Salim Hoss, premier of a
Moslem Cabinet that vies for power with a Christian government, and
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual adviser of the
fundamentalist Shiite Moslem group Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for pro-Iranian
kidnappers holding most of the 16 Western hostages in Lebanon,
eight of whom are Americans.
   Khaled Hasnawi, the Algerian ambassador, also met with Hoss and
later with Sheik Sobhi Tofaili, a senior Hezbollah leader.
   Tofaili and Hasnawi told reporters they focused on ways of
getting Israel to free Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a cleric affiliated
with Hezbollah. Israeli commandos abducted Obeid on July 28 from
his home in south Lebanon.
   Israel has offered to trade Obeid and other Lebanese Shiites it
holds for the Western hostages and three Israeli soldiers held in
Lebanon.
   Hasnawi sounded optimistic about a swap when he began his
mediation last week on orders of Chadli Bendjedid, president of
Algeria.
   Asked on Monday about his views, the ambassador said: ``I
haven't set a deadline in any of my previous statements. It might
take one, two or even three years.''
   Goulding said he unable to determine whether Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins was killed by his pro-Iranian captors.
   ``I have not been able to ascertain whether Colonel Higgins was
still alive,'' he said. ``I hope that he is but I haven't been able
to confirm that he is. Equally, I haven't been able to confirm that
he is dead. The question remains an open one.''
   A group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on
Earth said it hanged the U.S. Marine officer July 31 in retaliation
for Israel's abduction of Obeid three days earlier.
   Higgins, 44, commanded U.N. truce observers when he was
kidnapped Feb. 17, 1988, in south Lebanon. His captors released a
poor-quality videotape July 31 purporting to show him dangling from
a make-shift scaffold.
   The FBI said in Washington its forensic experts believed the
videotape showed Higgins, but offered no conclusion on when or how
the death occurred.
   In Fort Myer, Va., Bush paid tribute to Higgins on Monday as
``the symbol of the courage that burns in the breast of every
American in uniform.''
   Goulding said he would fly back to New York ``fairly soon'' to
report to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar ``on what I
have been told and what my conclusions are. There we will consider
what to do next.''
   His aides said he had scheduled meetings Tuesday in Jerusalem
with Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's defense minister, and Deputy Foreign
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
   On Sunday, kidnappers holding American hostage Joseph Cicippio,
58, offered to free him if Israel released 450 Arab prisoners and
allowed the return of 55 Palestinian deported from the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israel said Monday there would be no exchange without its three
soldiers.
   ``It is obvious we will not agree to a partial exchange, said
Avi Pazner, chief spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   Rabin, interviewed by ABC News, said Israel had received no
``real proposal'' for an exchange. If the Shiite groups want a
solution, he said, ``they have to turn to the right, proper
channels of the International Red Cross, and then we'll start
negotiations.''
   Hussein Mousawi, a senior Hezbollah leader, said Sunday one of
the soldiers might be killed unless Israel released Obeid.
   Alon Liel, Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Monday the Israelis
would hold Syria and Iran responsible for the safety of the
soldiers.
   Cicippio's Lebanese wife, Elham Ghandour, a secretary at the
U.S. Embassy in Beirut, said she felt encouraged by Sunday's offer
from the Revolutionary Justice Organization, the name his captors
use. Her husband was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986.
   ``I believe everybody is on the right track, which is
encouraging. I'm optimistic,'' Mrs. Cicippio told The Associated
Press. She would not elaborate.
   The Western hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, 41, the
AP's chief Middle East correspondent, kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   Columbia, earthbound for 3{ years
and cannibalized for parts to keep other space shuttles flying, was
pronounced troublefree Monday and ready for a Tuesday morning
launch to put a high-powered spy satellite in orbit.
   ``Everything is on schedule, there are no constraints to
launch,'' said Lisa Malone, a NASA spokeswoman at the Kennedy Space
Center.
   The five-man crew was told that the weather appeared to be no
problem for launch. Their ship, the oldest in the fleet, has had
258 modifications to bring it up to par with the others and in the
process gained 2,500 pounds.
   Everything about the mission, except the names of the all-male,
all-military crew, was secret _ including time of liftoff, length
of mission and the cargo in the shuttle's 60-foot-long hold.
   NASA said only that the liftoff would be between 7:30 a.m. and
11:30 a.m. EDT. The most likely time was a few minutes before 8.
Military missions in the past have lasted only four days, but this
one is expected to remain aloft a day longer to test the shuttle's
control systems, unused for 3{ years.
   NASA conducted its countdown in secret. The clocks scattered
around the Kennedy Space Center were to be lit up just nine minutes
before launch. NASA will provide only minimal announcements during
the flight, including the time of landing at Edwards Air Force Base
in California.
   Sources said the astronauts will launch a 20,600-pound
satellite, capable of gathering photographic and electronic images
of the Soviet Union, China, the Middle East and other areas of
military interest.
   The satellite, traveling over much of the inhabited world, is
able to take highly detailed photographs of troop movements,
military installations and the like, according to the sources.
   The sources also said the shuttle's cargo bay holds a package of
scientific experiments for military research, built by NASA at its
Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland and the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in California.
   Columbia is the grand old man of space shuttles. It was the
first of the flying orbiters and completed five missions in 1981
and 1982 before the second ship, Challenger, joined the fleet.
Columbia flew once in 1983 and once in 1986, completing its 7th and
last mission 10 days before the Challenger explosion.
   But Columbia became outdated as the newer ships came along. And
when the fleet got its complete overhaul during the 2{-year
post-Challenger hiatus, Discovery and Atlantis got preferred
treatment. Columbia was used as a parts source until modernizing
began last November.
   ``We will have a certain sense of deja vu when Columbia lifts
off,'' said Dick Young, a NASA spokesman. ``Columbia is the first
of a kind and we're glad to see it back in flight. A lot of us
remember back in 1981 when Columbia did its first mission.''
   Columbia will return to space with two borrowed engines and one
reclaimed from an earlier flight. Engine No. 1 last was used on
Atlantis on two missions in 1985 and before that by Columbia in
1983; Nos. 2 and 3 were on Discovery last September and again in
March.
   The crew commander is Air Force Col. Brewster Shaw, a veteran of
two earlier shuttle flights, including a 1983 trip on Columbia. The
other crew members are Navy Cmdr. Richard Richards, Navy Cmdr.
David Leestma, Army Lt. Col. James Adamson and Air Force Maj. Mark
Brown.
   The mission, designated STS-28, is the fourth dedicated to
military purposes and operating under the Pentagon's strict secrecy
rules.
   Two military flights preceded the 1986 Challenger accident and
one other has been completed under a post-Challenger agreement that
called for nine flights through 1993.
   The Pentagon had planned 13 more military launches from the
shuttle in the rest of the 1990s, but has decided instead to use
expendable rockets to get the cargo into orbit.

<HEAD>Arab Thought To Be Collaborator Dies of Wounds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Palestinian thought to be a pro-Israeli
collaborator died Monday of stab wounds, bringing to 90 the number
of such killings by fellow Palestinians since the uprising began 20
months ago, Arab journalists said.
   In other developments Monday:
   _The Jerusalem district court postponed for the third time the
manslaughter trial of Rabbi Moshe Levinger, a spiritual leader of
Jewish settlers in Hebron on the occupied West Bank. Levinger is
charged in the death last September of Kayed Salah, 42, a Hebron
merchant. Witnesses said Levinger fired shots after his car was
stoned, killing Salah and wounding another Palestinian. Levinger
denies the allegations.
   _In the West Bank town of Bethlehem residents said a man in
civilian clothes fired from a passing car, seriously wounding
13-year-old Mohammed Jamil Kamel who was hit in the head.
   _The army command said that in the occupied Gaza Strip a soldier
accidentally opened fire during ``army activity'' in Khan Yunis,
wounding another soldier. It gave no details.
   Naji Juma Abu Afi, 27, died at Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis of
knife wounds suffered Sunday in nearby Bani Suhaila village,
hospital officials said.
   Palestinian reporters in Gaza said Abu Afi was suspected of
collaborating with Israeli authorities. The military command
confirmed Abu Afi was brought to the hospital on Sunday and said it
was checking further.
   At least 90 Arabs have been killed as suspected collaborators
during the uprising against Israeli rule in lands captured by
Israel from Jordan and Egypt in 1967.
   At least 529 Palestinians have died in clashes with the army and
other Israelis since the uprising began in December 1987.
Thirty-eight Israelis have been killed.

<HEAD>Paper Reports Second Transfer in Bloch Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French and U.S. agents watched a
suspected KGB operative transfer a travel case he had received from
Felix Bloch to another KGB agent, a newspaper reported Monday.
   Also on Monday, Bloch, a former U.S. diplomat, was quoted in a
magazine interview as avoiding a direct question about whether he
had spied.
   Bloch, 54, worked from 1980 to 1987 at the U.S. Embassy in
Vienna and served as its No. 2 official. He was suspended by the
State Department on June 22 but no charges have been filed.
   The French magazine Paris-Match and the U.S. television network
ABC reported last week that a suspected Soviet agent picked up
Bloch's travel bag after the two men dined together at a restaurant
in Paris.
   Paris-Match reported the suspected Soviet agent was a man using
the name Reino Gikman on a Finnish passport.
   The Austrian daily Der Standard reported that Gikman later
passed the bag to another suspected KGB agent.
   According to the Paris-Match report, the first transaction took
place last May 14 and was filmed and photographed by French agents.
   Der Standard, attributing its report to ``secret agent
circles,'' said that the next day Gikman gave the bag to a man
identified by the French counterespionage agency as a KGB agent. It
said that agent took it out of the country.
   The paper said the transfer was observed by French and U.S.
agents as well as KGB agents.
   The reports did not say what was in the travel bag.
   In a telephone interview reported in Monday's Austrian news
magazine Profil Bloch avoided a direct answer to a question.
   Profil said journalist Josef Votzi asked Bloch, ``If you are
really innocent, a one-sentence comment would suffice: I am accused
unjustly of espionage, I was not and am not a spy.''
   The magazine reported Bloch replied, ``There are accusations;
there are no proofs. One has to prove my guilt.''

<HEAD>Mosbacher Proposes 105-Minute Trawls</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, told by a
judge to protect endangered sea turtles, told shrimp fishermen
Monday they must inspect their nets every 105 minutes for trapped
turtles.
   Environmentalists said that interval was too long and promised
to oppose Mosbacher in court.
   The Commerce Department said the trawling time limitations,
which take effect Tuesday and will be in place at least through
Sept. 7, will protect the Kemp's ridley turtle better than turtle
excluder devices, which shrimp fishermen loathe.
   The department says the turtles can survive submerged for 90
minutes. Environmentalists say the department's own studies show
that one in four sea turtles will drown during a tow time of 105
minutes.
   The new regulation established a 105-minute cycle for shrimpers
_ 7{ minutes to get their nets in the water, 90 minutes to trawl
and 7{ minutes to retreive the nets.
   ``We don't think the secretary's proposed regulations comply
with the law and we're going to challenge it in court,'' said
National Wildlife Federation spokesman Charlie Miller.
   The department predicted compliance with the trawling time
limitations would be far better than with the excluder devices.
   ``Because there is so much opposition to the (excluder)
regulations, compliance has been very low in some areas,'' the
department said in a document filed in federal court here. ``It is,
therefore, likely that many turtles are dying in the nets of those
trawlers who are refusing to use'' the devices.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Hogan, who last week ordered
Mosbacher to begin protecting sea turtles from drowning in
shrimpers' nets by Monday _ after the secretary suspended
enforcement of the excluder device law July 24 following massive
shrimper protests _ had not ruled on the Commerce plan by late in
the day.
   Conservationists said the judge was not expected to rule before
midweek.
   Officials will take public comment on the rules through Aug. 21
to determine whether the trawling time restrictions should be
continued or modified ``in light of conservation needs of sea
turtle populations and the economics of the shrimp fishing
industry.''
   Tom Miller, a spokesman for the Center for Marine Conservation,
said the restrictions are unenforceable and that the Kemp's ridley
must surface frequently to ventilate its lungs.
   ``We believe the tow-time restrictions condemn the sea turtles
to extinction,'' Miller said. ``Tow times are not the answer.''
   Judge Hogan issued his ruling in a suit filed by the National
Wildlife Federation, which wants the excluder regulations enforced.
   Mosbacher suspended the regulations after shrimpers protested
their use by blockading Texas Gulf Coast shipping channels.

<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS date of kidnapping in 9th graf, Higgins, head</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The FBI said Monday it believes the videotape
released last week in Beirut shows the body of American hostage
William Higgins hanging from a rope, but the agency offered no
conclusion as to the cause or timing of death.
   President Bush, who praised Marine Lt. Col. Higgins publicly
during the day as a ``symbol of courage,'' telephoned Mrs. Higgins
to offer private condolences and tell her the United States is
still seeking full details on her husband.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Gen. Al Gray, the
commandant of the Marine Corps, had informed Higgins' wife of the
results of the FBI analysis of the videotape ``purported to be of
Lt. Col. Higgins.''
   ``Presidet Bush called Mrs. Higgins at about 2 p.m. to offer his
support and encouragement. The president said the U.S. government
will continue to do all it can to obtain a full accounting of what
happened to her husband,'' Fitzwater said.
   The FBI said its forensic experts have concluded ``within a
reasonable degree of medical certainty that the person depicted in
the videotape is dead.''
   ``Although a positive identification could not be made, numerous
observable characteristics were noted indicating that the person
depicted in the videotape is Lt. Col. Higgins,'' the FBI said.
   A law enforcement source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said FBI experts were unable to determine the time of Higgins'
death from their examination of the videotape.
   The tape showed a man, bound and gagged, hanging by a rope from
his neck.
   Higgins, head of a 75-member United Nations peacekeeping team,
was kidnapped in south Lebanon on Feb. 17, 1988.
   The president paid tribute to Higgins at a ceremony at Ft. Myer
in nearby Arlington, Va., marking the 200th anniversary of the
Department of War, forerunner to the Pentagon.
   Bush used the occasion to press for his defense priorities,
including mobile nuclear missiles, the B-2 bomber and the Strategic
Defense Initiative, all threatened with budget cuts on Capitol Hill.
   With the Defense Department's top civilian and military brass
seated behind him, Bush offered a salute to ``every brave American
who ever served'' in peace and wartime.
   Then, in a voice that broke, he added:
   ``We cannot leave here today without pausing to salute one who
stands as the symbol of the courage that burns in the breast of
every American in uniform, one Marine who has been very much in our
thoughts, Lt. Col. Higgins, William Richard Higgins.''
   Higgins' captors said they hanged him last Monday in retaliation
for the Israeli kidnapping of a Moslem cleric, Sheik Abdul Karim
Obeid. The terrorists had made previous death threats against
Higgins, calling him a spy.
   Israeli government officials said their sources indicated
Higgins had been killed some time ago.
   Fitzwater said now is a time of ``monitoring and watching'' at
the White House as the Bush administration pursues diplomatic
efforts to free hostages in Lebanon. Eight additional Americans are
being held, and a half-dozen other Westerners.
   Fitzwater said Bush was ``cautiously optimistic,'' but expects
it will take ``a longer period of time rather than shorter.''
   ``There are a lot of ideas being floated, a lot of exchanges
being made. ... We see ideas coming out from Iran, from Syria,
Algeria, Israel, the United States, everybody,'' said Fitzwater.
   The pro-Iranian Revolutionary Justice Organization said Sunday
it would release another American hostage, Joseph Cicippio, if
Israel frees the Moslem cleric and hundreds of other Lebanese and
Palestinian prisoners.
   Fitzwater said of the White House refusal to comment on that
offer: ``We have to be very careful of what we say. ... Often you
can cut off those kinds of channels and communications if you
comment prematurely in public.''
   There is no change in the U.S. policy of refusing to negotiate
with terrorists, said Fitzwater.
   ``We have always said our policy is to talk to anyone who has
information about our hostages, to discuss any possibility of
release, to pursue every avenue of knowledge and information that
might lead to their release and that's what we're doing,'' he said.
   Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said the U.S.
role ``remains one of active diplomacy.'' He added, ``We're
continuing to be in contact with various parties in the region and
with international organizations.''

<HEAD>Fatah Hardliners Call for Military Action</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hard-line factions within Fatah, the main
unit of the Palestine Liberation Organization, on Monday renewed a
call for military action against Israel outside the
Israeli-occupied territories, PLO sources said.
   It was part of a draft resolution to be submitted for a vote
before about 1,000 Fatah members attending a five-day congress in
the Tunisian capital.
   The move conflicts with attempts by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat
to adopt a more moderate approach to solving the issue of
Palestinian sovereignty.
   The Palestine National Congress, the PLO's parliament, declared
Palestinian independence last November. Arafat then declared that
the PLO would restrict armed actions to Israeli-occupied
territories, although the exact meaning of ``occupied territories''
was vague.
   Arafat's stand led to talks with the United States and weakened
Israel's refusal to deal with the PLO on grounds the PLO is a
terrorist organization.
   PLO sources at the congress, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Monday's call to arms was included in the draft resolution
over the objections of more moderate Fatah members.
   They said the draft also rejects Israel's proposal for elections
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip but supports
Arafat's acceptance of elections after Israeli troops withdraw
under United Nations supervision.
   The meeting, the first Fatah congress in nine years, opened
Friday and was closed to journalists after opening remarks by
Arafat and Tunisian President Zine Abidine Ben Ali.
   In Amman, the capital of Jordan, a senior PLO official said
Monday his organization will transfer a fund headquarters to Amman
from Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates to help boost Jordan's
troubled economy, .
   The official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Arafat would visit Jordan next week to inaugurate the Palestine
National Fund's new headquarters.
   The official Jordan news agency Petra reported Monday that
Jordan agreed to the PLO decision.
   The fund functions as Fatah's treasury. It was moved from Amman
in 1986 after relations between the PLO and Jordan soured.
Relations improved after King Hussein's decision in July 1988 to
renounce sovereignty over the West bank in favor of the PLO. Israel
captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 war.

   A small band of anti-government

   In Taegu, several hundred students hurled rocks and shattered
windows at guardposts at the U.S. Cultural Center Sunday night and
clashed with riot police, according to the Yonhap news agency.
   The attack on the U.S. facility followed a rally at Kyongbuk
University to protest what some students said is government
suppression of a new teachers' union. Six students were arrested,
but no injuries were reported.
   On Monday ten students hurled firebombs into the compound of the
Agency for National Security Planning in eastern Seoul, Yonhap
reported.
   ``Disband NSP'' the students shouted, according to the news
agency. It said the students painted slogans on the compound walls
before fleeing.
   Police reported two demonstrators were arrested..
   Kim Dae-jung, leader of the opposition Party for Peace and
Democracy, said Monday that ``anti-democratic forces within the
ruling party are threatening democracy.''
   He said a crackdown on dissidents, the investigation of three
people for making visits to communist North Korea and his detention
by the national security agency has given ``an anti-democratic
faction within the ruling camp'' more power.
   ``Politics by the security agency'' threatens to stem the
nation's move toward democracy, he said, and the ``faction that
favored reforms has become weak.''
   Kim was detained by the intelligence agency for 22 hours last
week for questioning in connection with an illegal trip to North
Korea by a lawmaker in his party.
   Kim said his party, as the leading opposition party, had been
singled out for harrassment by intelligence agents.
   President Roh Tae-woo, in a nationwide radio address Monday,
urged radical students, a small but active minority on university
campuses, to end violent protests. The radical students have little
popular support because of their violent tactics.
   Roh said ``the reckless acts of a small number of radical
leftists are deepening distrust and confrontation and obstructing
reunification with the north.''

<HEAD>Forty Percent of Future Recruits Surveyed Say They Hate Arabs</HEAD>

   A survey of 5,300 future Israeli army recruits
showed that 40 percent ``hate most or all Arabs'' and 90 percent
would volunteer if they were not drafted, Israel army radio said
Monday.
   It also indicated most high school students believe there will
be another Arab-Israeli war, the radio said, but did not give a
percentage figures.
   The survey, the first of its kind since the Palestinian uprising
against Israeli occupatio of West Bank and Gaza Strip began 20
months ago, was conducted last year by a private research company
for the Education Ministry.
   It said 42 percent identified themselves as representing the
political right and 34 percent as leftists.
   ``I think if we asked the general population the same questions,
we would get similar answers,'' said Avraham Amir, director-general
of the Education Ministry.
   He said the army and government try to educate soldiers not to
hate Arabs, despite the continuing conflict.
   Reuven Gel of the private Israel Institute for Military Studies,
which conducted the survey, said researchers interviewed 5,300
students aged 16 to 18 from high schools across the country.
   Israeli men are drafted at 18 for a three-year tour of duty and
continue doing reserve service of up to 45 days a year until age
55. Women serve for two years and are not required to serve in the
reserves.

<HEAD>Cheney Meets Egyptian Counterpart</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney met for the
first time on Monday with Egyptian Defense Minister Youssef Sabry
Abu-Taleb and reported afterward they had established ``a sound
working relationship.''
   Cheney, who took over the Pentagon earlier this spring, pledged
to meet regularly and to work closely with his counterpart, who was
named to his post in April.
   The Pentagon chief added that he intends to visit Egypt early
next year.
   ``I believe we've established a sound working relationship as
well as a close personal friendship,'' Cheney said in remarks
before reporters.
   ``It is well known that Egypt has long been an influential voice
for moderation in the Middle East and an advocate for a just and
lasting peace in the region. A militarily strong, politically
stable Egypt is critical to our efforts in the search for this
elusive peace,'' Cheney said.
   In a move that caught many off guard, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak named Abu-Taleb defense minister and commander-in-chief of
the armed forces last April, replacing Field Marshal Abdel-Halim
Abu-Ghazala, who had been in office for more than eight years.
   The main purpose of Abu-Taleb's visit to the United States, the
first since he was appointed defense minister, was to get
acquainted with key Bush administration officials.
   Abu-Taleb said the talks were conducted ``in a spirit of
cooperation and commitment. It has reassured me that we are both
dedicated to keeping our relationship strong and thriving.''
   The Egyptian official, asked about the talks, said they touched
on the coproduction of the Abrams M-1A1 tank, among other matters.

   The New York-based Guardian Angels scouted the
Paris Metro in their red berets and white T-shirts Monday to see
whether they should begin anti-crime subway patrols despite
official opposition.
   Lisa Sliwa, co-leader of the group with her husband Curtis, told
reporters she and three Guardian Angels from London would spend the
week traveling the Paris subways ``to see if we're needed.''
   ``The situation is not as bad in Paris as in New York. Here it's
possible to take preventive action to keep things from getting
worse,'' Mrs. Sliwa said, speaking in French at a news conference
at the busy Chatelet Metro stop in the heart of the city.
   She said she was disappointed that officials in Mayor Jacques
Chirac's office and in the Paris transit authority did not respond
to her requests for meetings.
   ``I want at least a chance to explain what we're doing,'' she
said. ``Afterwards, they can be against it. But if Parisians want
us to be here, we'll stay.''
   The transit authority later issued a statement saying, ``We are
completely opposed to those who act as a militia or other police
force.''
   It noted, however, that any citizen has the right ``to intervene
... when there is danger.'' The statement noted that, under a plan
announced in June, subway security was reinforced and a controller
named to coordinate police efforts in the metro.
   The Guardian Angeles, created in New York in 1979, have
patrolled the London Underground since May.

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 150 of the hundreds of East Germans
who have fled their communist homeland through Hungary to Austria
left Monday for West Germany and a new life.
   The East Germans, most in their early 20s and carrying papers
provided by the West German Embassy in Vienna, boarded one of the
trains that leave each night with refugees bound for West Germany.
   Embassy spokesmen will not say how many East Germans have passed
through Vienna since May, when Hungary's communist regime began
dismantling barbed wire fences and fortifications along its border
with Austria.
   Officials in Budapest, Hungary, caused a stir last week in the
Soviet bloc by saying they might offer asylum to East Germans who
can prove political persecution. A Budapest official said Monday
border police had stopped putting special stamps on the passports
of East Germans caught trying to cross the border.
   Austrian authorities said they had registered at least 400 East
German refugees before West Germany asked them last Friday to stop
making the figures public. They said the true figure could be at
least six times that because many of the East Germans do not report
to police.
   In Bonn, Ottfried Hennig, parliamentary state secretary for the
Ministry of Inter-German Relations, said West Germany feared East
Germany might impose new travel restrictions to stop the refugees.
   Western news reports say say about 200 East Germans are inside
the West German embassy in Budapest. The official East German news
agency ADN said Monday letting the refugees stay there was ``gross
interference'' in East Germany's internal affairs.
   About 100,000 East Germans are expected to make their way West
this year because of the lack of reform at home.
   Three groups of young East Berliners who recently followed
different routes across the border sat in Vienna's Westbahnhof
railroad station Monday and told escape stories ranging from
harrowing to casual.
   All cited the lack of personal freedom as the main reason for
leaving home. They also said their parents knew of their decision
and supported them.
   ``You can have a pile of money, but if you want to buy something
decent, you can't spend it,'' said one young man who had worked in
a restaurant. ``You run around the shops looking for a T-shirt,
just a T-shirt, and you run out with tears in your eyes. We want to
breathe.''
   Like many other East Germans who spoke with reporters, he asked
not to be identified, fearing his comments might cause trouble for
relatives and friends.
   Joerg, 21, made it across from Hungary on the second try, with a
friend, ``but I wouldn't recommend our route to anyone.'' He showed
scars left on his arm by barbed wire and thorns.
   Hungary says it has dismantled fortifications along about half
the 160-mile frontier with Austria. On their escape Thursday night,
Joerg said he and his friend got caught in the part still standing.
   ``We ran for about two hours, then we must have hit a trip wire,
which set off two flares shooting into the air,'' he said.
   After that they thought they heard warning shots. They bumped
into barbed wire, stayed low because of dogs, vehicles and voices,
and then ran several miles, Joerg said.
   Some who made it to safety only on the second or third try
praised the Hungarians.
   ``The first time, we were standing in a wood and the border
guard saw us,'' Joerg said. ``He was so nice, about my age. I gave
him a cigarette, a tissue because he had a cold. ... He was like my
brother.''
   But the Hungarian reported the incident and the two East Germans
were taken to a barracks where men in plainclothes threatened to
stamp their passports and ordered them out of the border zone.
   Joerg said, however, that ``one of the soldiers virtually told
me where to try again.''

<TEXT>
   Five Central American presidents announced
agreement Monday on a plan for demobilizing 11,000 Nicaraguan
rebels based in the mountains of Honduras.
   President Jose Azcona of Honduras said the plan calls for the
rebels, known as Contras, to surrender their arms to a force of
Spanish, West German and Canadian soldiers. He said the agreement
sets a 90-day timetable for demobilization and repatriation of the
Contras.
   ``The accord asks the international community for support,''
said Azcona, who read the text of a communique.
   The agreement also calls for negotiations to achieve a peace
accord in El Salvadoor between the government and leftist
guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   The accord was signed at the end of a three-day summit attended
by the presidents of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica
and Guatemala.
   Earlier in the day, President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua told
reporters: ``The United States is exerting great pressure so no
agreement is reached. They are in direct contact with all the
delegations except Nicaragua.''
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani denied that. ``We have
not received any pressure,'' he said.
   The presidents had said they would announce a timetable Monday
on resettling the Contras. Monday was the third day of their meting.
   Talks had appeared deadlocked earlier in the day and President
Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala said the leaders were wrestling with
tough issues.
   ``We're discussing the most difficult points so far. There has
been an attitude of goodwill, flexibility and a disposition to
resolve things,'' he said.
   Oscar Arias, president of Costa Rica, also denied pressure from
Washington.
   Arias, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for writing a peace
agreement and promoting dialogue, said, ``I'm very content. I'm
very optimistic.''
   Copies of a bilateral agreement between Honduras and Nicaragua
calling for withdrawal of the Contras from Honduras by Dec. 6 were
distributed to reporters earlier Monday. Jose Leon Talavera,
Nicaragua's deputy foreign minister, said it would be part of the
final accord.
   In exchange, Nicaragua is to drop its case against Honduras at
the World Court in the Hague. Nicaragua accuses Honduras of
allowing the Contras to operate from that country.
   ``There are some sticking points with respect to all the
issues,'' said Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras.
``So we'll have to see if we can get a fresh review of them.''
   The presidents agreed at a February meeting in El Salvador to
dismantle the Nicaraguan rebels, but delayed a decision on the
mechanics and timetable until this meeting.
   Ortega gave the other presidents a letter from the Salvadoran
rebels asking their cooperation in negotiating an end to the
9-year-old civil war.
   Cristiani said his government was willing to negotiate with the
rebels, on condition that ``once the talks begin that they not look
for excuses to break them.''
   The Bush administration has been lobbying Central American
governments to keep the U.S.-backed Contras active until February's
scheduled elections in Nicaragua.
   The U.S. government had four observers at the meeting but they
were meeting delegates outside the talks, not attending the
sessions.
   Ortega signed an agreement Friday with the domestic political
opposition, which calls for demobilizing the Contras in Honduran
camps. In exchange, he has pledged democratic reforms.
   The bilateral plan calls for resettling the 11,000 Contras and
12,000 dependents, who are living in Honduras along the Nicaraguan
border.
   Fighting has been reduced to sporadic clashes since last year,
when the United States cut off military aid and the two sides
reached a temporary truce. Since then, both sides have said they
would not carry out offensive operations.
   The Contras have been fighting the leftist Sandinistas since
1981, alleging the government betrayed the goals of the 1979
revolution that ousted dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979.
   El Salvador's civil war has left 70,000 dead, while 50,000
people have been killed in Nicaragua's conflict.

   The U.S.-backed Contra rebels
fighting Nicaragua's Sandinista government on Monday reiterated
their defiance of the opposition arrayed against them in Central
America.
   ``We will not lay down our arms and our fight will continue in
the mountains of Nicaragua,'' said Boanerges Mathus of the Contra
general staff.
   As he spoke, the five Central American presidents were meeting
in Tela, Honduras about the rebels' future, with the goal of
disbanding the Contras.
   Adolfo Calero, a Contra political leader, said he would not ask
the men to lay down their arms until after the Nicaraguan elections
in February. The United Statrs has said it wants the rebel force to
remain intact until then.
   ``We're ready to exchange arms for democracy, but not for
promises,'' Calero said in a speech Monday in Madison, Ala.
   The Contras have been fighting the Sandinistas since 1981 and
about 50,000 people have been killed. They say the leftist
Sandinista government betrayed the 1979 revolution that ousted
dictator Anastasio Somoza.
   Fighting has declined sharply since February 1988, when the
United States cut off military aid to the Contras, limiting
assistance to humanitarian aid.
   At a February summit, the presidents agreed the Contras would be
resettled in exchange for free elections in Nicaragua. President
Daniel Ortega's government has scheduled the vote but the matter of
disbanding the Contras has not been settled.
   Although the Sandinistas and the Contras agreed March 21 to
suspend offensive operations, talks aimed at a permanent end to the
7-year-old war are at an impasse and the rebels continue to launch
sporadic attacks.
   U.S. officials say the resistance has ``frayed somewhat around
the edges'' since the cease-fire, but that the Contras have
maintained high morale.
   ``If the presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras,
Nicaragua and Costa Rica agree to bury us, we will abandon Honduran
territory and fight from the mountains of Nicaragua,'' said Mathus.
``We will seek economic and military support from other Western
nations if the United States suspends aid.''
   Although the leadership is a cultured elite based in Miami and
includes former leaders of Somoza's hated National Guard, most
Contras are former sharecroppers or rural businessmen.
   About 11,000 Contra fighters and 12,000 dependents have moved
from Nicaragua into Honduran border camps.
   Many fled Nicaragua because the Sandinista government was
forcing them to sell crops at low prices and join rural
co-operatives. Others fled the draft, not wanting to fight for the
Sandinistas, and ended up fighting against them.
   Many have begun to farm or to work on coffee plantations in
Honduras, but the Hondurans have made it difficult for most Contras
to get work permits.

   Seventy-two members of the leading
opposition party began a two-day fast in Burma's capital on Monday
in remembrance of pro-democracy demonstrators killed in an army
crackdown a year ago, a Western diplomat said.
   On Aug. 8, 1988, tens of thousands of Burmese in Rangoon joined
a protest against 25 years of authoritarian rule in Burma. The next
day, soldiers shot dead hundreds of demonstrators.
   Nationwide unrest continued but was crushed after Gen. Saw Maung
seized power on Sept. 18. His troops killed hundreds more and
imposed martial law.
   The diplomat, reached by telephone from Bangkok, said the 72
members of the National League for Democracy were fasting in the
party's office in Rangoon.
   They also were demanding the release of political prisoners, he
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He described the protest as ``feeble'' compared to those held
before July 20, when authorities arrested two party leaders and
began hauling in hundreds of party members.
   Party Secretary-General Aung San Suu Kyi has been reported on a
hunger strike but no details have emerged.
   ``I don't doubt that she started it (the hunger strike), but I
am rather doubtful that she is still on it,'' the diplomat said.

   A commercial DC-9 aircraft had to
abort a landing at Timehri international airport and then circle
the field because a dog was sunning itself on the main runway, a
newspaper reported.
   The government weekly Sunday Chronicle said the British West
Indies Airways jet was approaching for a landing Friday when the
pilot saw the dog in the center of the runway.
   The pilot scrubbed the landing and regained altitude.
   Civil Aviation Department officials scrambled aboard vehicles
and tried to shoo the dog away, but he was basking in the warmth of
the recently relaid 7,400-foot runway and balked at leaving, the
paper said.
   It took security men five minutes to scare the dog away.
Relatives and embarrassed airport staff watched as the plane
circled the airport 25 miles south of the capital.
   The plane landed safely as the dog looked for another place in
the sun.

<HEAD>Abortion Issue Plays Key Role In California Assembly Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ESCONDIDO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An obscure California legislative
district has become a political battleground in which the U.S.
Supreme Court's recent decision on abortion is playing a crucial
role.
   Voters go to the polls Tuesday in a race both pro-choice and
anti-abortion activists say marks the first legislative election in
the nation since the high court's July 3 ruling gave states more
authority to restrict abortions.
   Voters will choose a representative for the 76th Assembly
District from among eight candidates. The winner will succeed GOP
Assemblyman Bill Bradley, who died June 1.
   The special election would normally excite little outside
interest. But the abortion issue has made a difference.
   ``It's not the sole reason I'm going to choose someone, but it
will definitely be a consideration,'' said Escondido resident Troy
Gagielo, who said he was ``definitely looking for a pro-choice
candidate.''
   Six Republicans and two Democrats are stumping the sweltering
streets and rural ranches, and the campaigning has been lively,
despite the difficulties of summer apathy, the short time period
and a huge district.
   The mushroom-shaped 76th Assembly District has 65,439 voters and
is overwhelmingly Republican _ 54.2 percent to 32.7 percent
Democrat.
   Only one of the six Republicans, the president of the state
Board of Registered Nursing, is openly pro-choice and supports
state funding of abortions for poor women.
   ``Health care is the issue to me,'' said Tricia Hunter, 36, of
Bonita, a registered nurse who is also director of surgical
services at Chula Vista Community Hospital. ``You cannot restrict
health care because of individual beliefs.''
   Hunter says the abortion issue is going to play a big part in
the election. ``It has definitely spurred interest in the race
throughout the state,'' she said.
   Both Democrats are also pro-choice. Three of the Republicans are
strongly opposed to abortion.
   The two other Republican candidates, Deputy Mayor Linda Brannon,
42, of Poway and Dennis Koolhaas, 34, of Escondido, say only that
they oppose state funding of abortion. But abortion should not be a
major issue in the race, they insist.
   ``This is not a campaign that should be a one-issue race,'' said
Koolhaas.
   All the candidates see crime, education and
growth-transportation as among the biggest issues in the district.
   The special election process is an odd one. All candidates will
be on the ballot together, regardless of party. Voters will get one
ballot and can vote for whomever they choose. If one candidate gets
more than 50 percent of the vote _ unlikely in such a split field _
he or she is elected to the office. If that does not happen, the
top Republican and the top Democrat will face each other in a
runoff election on Oct. 3.

   Alabama securities investigators leaving the
home of church deacon Steven Streit after interviewing him about
possible fraud found on his doorstep a $35,000 check from a
would-be investor.
   ``These people were begging to invest with him,'' said Robert
Rash, director of the Alabama Securities Commission.
   Streit is now serving a 10-year prison sentence for fraud for
running a con game that bilked nearly 200 people out of an
estimated $18 million.
   Streit's investment scam was among several cited by state
securities regulators Monday at a news conference announcing a
15-state survey of religious-oriented investment schemes that have
cost 15,000 investors some $450 million since 1985.
   U.S. Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., was among the investors
taken in by Streit, the former treasurer of one of the largest
Baptist churches in Alabama.
   ``He never invested any of the money,'' said Rash.
   Streit, who kept a stock market ticker running in his office and
maintained three satellite dishes at his $400,000 house, told
investors he had a direct link to every major exchange in the
world, said Rash.
   Although Streit promised an exhorbitant return of 30 percent to
35 percent per month, his investors didn't question him. One victim
stated, ``It was sort of comforting to see the Bible verse printed
at the end of the monthly statements.''
   Streit traded on his role as a deacon of the church as well as a
former accountant and bank trust officer to bilk ``virtually every
prominent businessman in the Huntsville area,'' said Rash.
   ``Everybody thought he had divine guidance, he played his role
real well,'' Rash said in an interview.
   Dickinson was out of the country and was unavailable for comment.

<HEAD>Chihuahua Prostitutes Demand a Red Light District</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A spokesman for the Chihuahua state
government said Monday it is willing to discuss with prostitutes
and bar owners the opening of a ``tolerance zone'' in which
prostitution would be allowed.
   But spokesman Alfonso Sanchez Gallo said: ``First they would
have to find an appropriate place and then they would have to get
the funds. The bar owners themselves would have to pay for it.''
   Sanchez said prostitutes were meeting with government officials
to discuss the opening of a red light district.
   Last week authorities in Chihuahua City, the state capital,
closed about 31 downtown bars and restaurants they said had become
fronts for prostitution.
   They said the businesses will stay shut despite prostitutes'
threats to strip in protest in front of the capitol building.
   About 1,500 prostitutes threatened to march on the capitol
Monday and undress publicly to press for creation of a red light
district in the city.
   ``There was no march and nobody took off their clothes,''
Sanchez said in a telephone interview.
   He quoted Chihuahua Gov. Fernando Baeza as saying that any bar
or restaurant catering to prostitution would have its license
revoked.
   The Mexico City newspaper Excelsior on Sunday quoted Magdalena
Aguirre, a spokewoman for the prostitutes, as saying she and the
other prostitutes would exhibit themselves ``completely naked'' at
the capitol if their demands were not met.
   Ms. Aguirre ridiculed Baeza's suggestion that prostitutes seek
factory jobs, according to the Sunday edition of the Mexico City
daily La Jornada.
   She was quoted as saying that factories ``only pay 60,000 pesos
($23) a week. We make that much or more in two hours.''
   Sanchez said Baeza had warned the women that it would be illegal
for them to disrobe in public.
   ``The state government has to put the brakes on prostitution. It
isn't legal here,'' the spokesman added.
   Sanchez then mentioned a possible ``tolerance zone.''
   Although prostitution is illegal in Mexico, many city and state
governments have allowed red light districts to operate.

<TEXT>
   President Bush promised to deal with the
problems of poverty and racial intolerence in his presidency and
his aides claim progress in six months in office, but civil rights
advocates gathered here say his record so far has been spotty.
   Bush's choice of William Lucas to be the Justice Department's
top civil rights enforcer, his refusal to speak out on recent
Supreme Court rulings limiting affirmative action programs and the
dispute with Congress over a new minimum wage are cited most
frequently by his critics.
   Administration aides defend Bush's civil rights commitment,
claiming it is a strong one that dates back to his support of open
housing legislation as a first-term House member in 1968 _ in a
dramatic break with the rest of the Texas delegation.
   And Fred McClure, the highest-ranking black member of the White
House staff, said most of the agenda of the civil rights movement
is ``George Bush's agenda.''
   The president on Tuesday will address the 79th annual Urban
League Conference, whose theme this year is ``Total parity by the
year 2000.''
   Urban League President John E. Jacob is challenging Bush to use
the speech ``to present bold new initiatives that help America's
poor people and put us back on the path of racial progress.''
   White House aides said they do not expect the speech to break
any new ground, despite Jacob' appeal.
   Bush, according to deputy press secretary Stephen Hart, will use
the speech to ``say that we've come a long way but we've got a long
way to go'' on ending discrimination.
   ``It focuses on education as the key to equality. It talks about
education and about drugs,'' said Hart.
   However, the president for some time reportedly has been
considering making a trip to Africa this fall, according to White
House officials. Tuesday's speech might present a good forum for
Bush to announce such a trip.
   Bush himself, in a Monday evening telephone address to a town
meeting sponsored by the Urban League and the NAACP at the Mt.
Olive Baptist Church in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said he would offer
a ``message of challenge and hope'' in his speech to the Urban
League.
   In his phone talk, he focused on the war against drugs, citing
statistics showing the number of Americans who are frequent cocaine
users was up sharply. ``We're talking addiction,'' Bush said.
``This is an issue we should fight every day.''
   Civil rights leaders appear willing to give Bush some benefit of
doubt on his agenda, partly because he has reached out toward them
from the early days of his presidency. But they suggest his words
don't live up to his deeds.
   ``The civil rights community would give the president high marks
for accessibility and symbolism and rhetoric but low marks on
substantive civil rights policy,'' said Ralph Neas, executive
director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
   ``So far, the Bush administration has compiled a disappointing
record on civil rights,'' Neas said in an interview.
   Civil rights advocates list these developments as the major
irritants:
   _The Senate debacle over Lucas, a black Detroit lawyer Bush
nominated to head the civil rights division at Justice. Lucas was
widely criticized by black leaders for lacking experience in
discrimination cases and was rejected by the Senate Judiciary
Committee on a 7-7 tie vote.
   Still, the administration continues to stand by the nomination,
including a behind-the-scenes effort by Bush last Friday to get the
full Senate to ignore the committee vote and bring the nomination
to the floor.
   _The administration's refusal to speak out against _ or support
legislation to sidestep _ a series of Supreme Court rulings last
spring that sharply restricted affirmative action and made it more
difficult to prove discrimination in the workplace.
   _Bush's veto of a new minimum wage bill.
   _The president's support of a holdover nomination by former
President Reagan of Vaughn Walker, a San Francisco attorney, to a
federal judgeship in California. Walker came under fire for his
membership in a club that excludes women.
   _The Justice Department's decision to undo existing school
desegregation orders in Georgia, and its filing of a lawsuit
challenging a Prince George's County, Md., desegration plan.
   McClure, the Bush White House liaison with members of Congress,
defends Bush's civil rights policy as a continued effort ``to break
down barriers.''
   At the same time, McClure said, ``You haven't had issues like
civil rights acts, the voting rights act, traditional types of
civil rights measures'' thus far in Bush's adminstration.
   However, McClure said the bipartisan agreement reached last week
with the White House on legislation to extend equal opportunity
protection to Americans with disabilities should be viewed as a key
civil-rights move on Bush's part.
   Civil rights leaders agreed, giving Bush high marks for his role
in crafting the legislation.
   Jacob, the Urban League president, says that despite major
differences with the administration on some civil rights issues, he
remains hopeful that remaining problems can be worked out ``with
honesty and candor.''
   And Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, appearing at the Urban
League conference Monday, touted administration planning grants to
12 cities and rural areas for getting ``at-risk youths'' into the
economic mainstream.
   She said stamping discrimination ``out of our economy'' remains
a high priority of the administration.
   And Bush, addressing a ceremony honoring the 25th anniversary of
the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, told a White House
audience last month he would be satisfied ``with nothing less than
equality of opportunity for all Americans.''
   ``The hard lesson of the passing years is that it has not been
enough to wage a war against the old forms of bigotry and
inequality,'' Bush added.
   But Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., majority whip of the House,
scoffed on Monday at Bush's notion of a ``kinder and gentler
nation.''
   He told the Urban League forum: ``It does none of us any good to
talk about the benefits of economic growth and opportunity and yet
not acknowledge that there has been stagnation and a worsening of
conditions for some Americans, and especially African-Americans.''

<HEAD>More Lightning Strikes Across Northwest Forests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER PETTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms with lightning but no rain raised a threat of more
fires Monday across the dry forests of northern California and
moved toward western and central Idaho, where flames have already
charred 105,000 acres.
   ``That's a bad sign if it's coming this way,'' said George
Bukenhofer of the Payette National Forest in Idaho. ``We don't need
any more of this. We have lots of active fire already.''
   The Boise Interagency Fire Center, the national fire
coordination center, said 23,000 firefighters were battling the
worst of the fires on 182,000 acres, primarily in Idaho, Oregon and
California. The center said the war has already cost over $27
million.
   More than 220,000 acres have been charred in a bout of mostly
lightning-caused fires that began July 26.
   More than 3,000 lightning strikes were reported overnight in
Oregon, Washington, Nevada, California and Idaho.
   ``A lot of these strikes will hit a tree or the ground,'' said
Forest Service spokesman Mike Ferris in Oregon. ``They're what we
call a sleeper. They'll smolder (for days) and a little wind will
come behind them and all of a sudden they'll burn.''
   Before the lightning strikes, eastern Oregon firefighters had
consolidated gains made during cool weather last week and predicted
that many of the 100 fires that had burned 82,000 acres would be
contained by midweek.
   Airplanes sent over national forests Monday in Washington to
look for telltale smoke found dozens of lightning-caused spot
fires, most of which were quickly contained by ground crews.
   Hardest hit were the Wenatchee and Okanogan national forests,
where crews fought 16 lightning-caused spot fires, none of which
grew to more than one-half acre, said Sheela McLean, an Okanogan
Forest spokeswoman.
   Hundreds of Army soldiers moved through the Interagency Fire
Center for training and eventual deployment to the firelines as
land managers pressed for more manpower.
   ``In past years, we've used the military for mop-up, but that's
not happening this time,`` said Boise National Forest spokeswoman
Pat Irwin in Idaho. ``They're being used as mop-up for a few days,
but that's just their training. The incident commanders believe
they can be as good as class-one hot-shot crews because they're
disciplined, used to working together and they're physically fit.''
   In hardest-hit Idaho, more than 9,000 people were committed to
the major fires, like the 42,000-acre Lowman Complex of fires that
destroyed a small resort town 70 miles northeast of Boise.
   Major gains were made during cooler weather that persisted into
the weekend, but the mercury rose again Monday and humidity was
declining.
   Firefighters in southern and central California reported
progress Monday on two blazes that have blackened thousands of
acres of forest and wilderness.
   The 7,550-acre Balch Camp Fire in the Sierra foothills east of
Fresno was 95 percent surrounded, officials said.
   The Vail Fire in the Cleveland National Forest east of San
Diego, which was ignited by a target shooter's bullet nine days
ago, was 90 percent contained, said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman
Jean Magarrell. The fire had torched a house and trailer and
threatened the historic Mount Palomar Observatory and the Eagle
Crag nature sanctuary earlier in the week.
   Near Coalville, Utah, about 45 miles east of Salt Lake City,
firefighters were close to containing the 1,700-acre Chalk Creek
blaze.
   In northwestern Nebraska, a fire that blackened 3,000 acres of
brush and timber in canyon country near Belmont was largely
contained but control wasn't expected for two to three days.

   Two men convicted of killing a teen-ager
they mistakenly believed had given the hand signal of a rival
street gang were each sentenced Monday to 41 years in prison.
   The sentences for Gregory T. Smith, 18, and Darrell J. Massey,
19, exceeded both the state sentencing guidelines of 26 to 34 years
and the prosecutor's recommendations.
   ``Their crime is unique in its enormity,'' said Pierce County
Superior Court Judge D. Gary Steiner.
   Smith and Massey were convicted July 5 of first-degree murder in
the shooting death of Brenda J. Harris, 17. They also were
convicted of two counts each of attempted murder of the other
occupants of the car in which the girl was riding. The other
occupants were not injured.
   Ms. Harris, who had no known gang ties, and her friends were
riding through east Tacoma on March 24 when she waved at someone
she thought she recognized.
   Police said Smith, Massey and two other men associated with the
Crips street gang then pursued the vehicle and opened fire on it.
Ms. Harris was struck in the head by a rifle bullet.
   The other men in the car with Massey and Smith testified against
them and pleaded guilty to lesser charges.
   Nancy Harris, Ms. Harris' mother, held a photograph of her
daughter and wept throughout the sentencing. The prison terms
weren't long enough, she said, adding, ``It's not going to bring my
daughter back.''

<HEAD>Mystery Woman Identified as a Mental Patient from Oregon</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to ADD quotes, detail; no pickup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young woman who was found
abandoned at a church a month ago was identified Monday as a mental
patient missing from Portland, Ore.
   The woman, who was known only as Christina, was identified
Monday as Rochelle Scholl and she has a severe mental disorder,
said Ed Hallett, a spokesman for Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells.
Doctors had thought she was a severely handicapped 14-year-old with
a life-threatening muscle disease.
   Hallet said Ms. Scholl, about 19, was identified by Portland
psychologist Susan Beattie, who arrived in St. John's on Monday.
Ms. Scholl has been hospitalized in St. John's for treatment.
   ``Any information I have is privileged,'' Beattie said.``Of
course I'm surprised she turned up in St. John's. That's awfully
far away from Portland, Oregon.''
   The brown-haired woman was found on the steps of an Anglican
cathedral in St. John's on July 7, five days after she was last
seen in Portland.
   She was covered by a blanket and apparently unable to speak.
   An intense investigation followed involving Canadian police,
social and medical workers, customs officials, Scotland Yard and
Interpol.
   Len Power of the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary said her true
identity was learned when a police department in a U.S. city he
wouldn't identify suggested checking with Portland authorities.
   They contacted Ms. Scholl's father, who reported her missing on
July 16. He identified her pictures on Saturday, said Power. The
father said Ms. Scholl hadn't been seen since July 2, when she left
home, telling a neighbor she was heading for California or Arizona
with $1,000 in her pocket.
   But it wasn't the first time Ms. Scholl made others believe she
was unable to talk.
   News reports from January 1988 said she turned up at an airport
in Des Moines, Iowa, clutching a baby bottle and a handwritten
letter authorities originally believed was written by her mother,
Power said.
   Three months earlier she was found in an airport bathroom in
Springfield, Mo., with a baby bottle and a similar letter that
quoted from the Bible and blamed her apparent disabilities on
falling short of the ``Lord's blessing.''
   Although seemingingly mute and handicapped, Ms. Scholl was later
found to be able-bodied and able to speak.
   John Efford, Newfoundland's social services minister, said,
``There's a lot of questions going to have to be answered. Hopefuly
now that she has been identified all the rest of the information
will piece together very quickly.''
   The discovery ends a month-long search for information about the
girl who social workers said used sign language to spin a tale
about sailing to Newfoundland from England on a white yacht,
accompanied by her mother, three men and a nanny.
   Officials said she appeared to understand English, German and
Slovene, a Yugoslavian dialect.
   Power said police are still trying to find out how Ms. Scholl
got to Newfoundland and are checking with airlines and buses that
travel to the province.

<TEXT>
   NBC has been joined by some of the nation's top
news organizations in appealing the network's multimillion-dollar
libel loss to entertainer Wayne Newton.
   A federal jury in Las Vegas awarded Newton $19.3 million in
damages over allegations that NBC libeled Newton by linking him to
mob figures.
   A federal judge later reduced the award to $5.3 million.
   NBC has appealed the verdict to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, saying the award to Newton was ``excessive and
insupportable.''
   Other networks, national newspaper groups and journalism
associations have joined NBC in the appeal, filing ``friends of the
court'' briefs last month.
   Among them were CBS, Capital Cities@ABC and Fox Broadcasting,
whose lawyers argued that viewers' impressions should not open a
media organization to liability.
   Also filing briefs were the Gannett Co., The New York Times
Company, Dow Jones &amp; Co., Copley Press and Chronicle Publishing,
according to Monday's editions of the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
   Newton's attorney, Morton Galane, said he consented to the other
media supporting NBC so the appeals court could be ``presented with
all possible arguments.''
   Newton sued NBC after the network broadcast a series of stories
entitled ``Wayne Newton and the Law'' beginning in 1980.
   Galane argued in the trial that the NBC reports left the false
impression that Newton's purchase of the Aladdin Hotel was linked
to the mob.

   Walter Ballard, who piloted the plane
that carried the nation's first load of transcontinental airmail in
1932, died at home after a lengthy illness. He was 93.
   Ballard was a pilot for American Airways, now American Airlines,
when he flew the first hop from San Diego's Lindbergh Field to
Phoenix, Ariz., on the transcontinental mail flight, according to
Edwin McKellar, executive director of the San Diego Aerospace
Museum.
   Ballard, who died Sunday, learned to fly during World War I and
was a test pilot during World War II, leaving the Navy with the
rank of lieutenant commander, McKellar said.
   He also engaged in cross-country racing, precision aerobatics,
dogfighting and test piloting. He logged more than three million
air miles and 20,000 flying hours in 25 different types of planes.
   ``Walter was a slice of early aviation history,'' said McKellar.
``He will be greatly missed at the museum, where he spent many
hours and years helping to restore planes in our collection.''
   Ballard was a volunteer at the San Diego Aerospace Museum until
a few months before his death.
   Among the planes he helped restore was a 1917 Curtiss JN4-D
``Jenny,'' in which Ballard learned to fly during World War I. The
war ended just as he finished training.
   ``We put in 10 hours a day ... learning almost everything there
was to know about airplanes,'' he said a few years ago. ``It didn't
seem right to let all that training go to waste.''
   He is survived by his wife, Susan.

   A plane carrying Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas,
congressional aides and several other people failed to arrive as
expected at a refugee camp near the Ethiopian-Sudanese border
Monday, the State Department said.
   ``We are concerned about the welfare of Mr. Leland and his
group,'' department spokesman Adam Shub said in a statement. Leland
aides suggested the group simply got behind schedule and was
staying overnight in another camp.
   In Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, John Guerra, a political
and economics office at the U.S. Embassy, said in a telephone
interview with The Associated Press in Nairobi: ``We don't know
anything for sure yet. We are hoping they got into problems with
the weather and diverted somewhere.''
   There were conflicting accounts of who was aboard the plane.
   A Leland spokeswoman said the congressman was accompanied by two
aides and three officials from relief organizations. A source on
Capitol Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the party
included three congressional staffers, a friend of Leland's, three
officials from the U.S. Embassy, one embassy spouse, an Ethiopian
employee of the embassy and two Ethiopian government officials. Two
of the Americans worked for the Agency for International
Development, he said.
   That would make 12 people in the party. Guerra said the plane
was carrying 14 people. It was not clear whether that included the
Ethipoian pilot and co-pilot.
   The plane is owned by Ethiopia's Relief and Rehabilitation
Commission, the government's welfare agency.
   Shub said the plane left Addis Ababa, at 10:40 a.m. local time,
headed for the refugee camp, Fugnido, about 300 miles to the
southwest. The plane did not arrive at the camp, and it did not
return to Addis Ababa as expected at 5 p.m. local time, 10 a.m. EDT
Monday in the United States, he said.
   Greta Morris, a department spokeswoman, said she did not expect
that search planes would be dispatched from Addis Ababa until
daybreak. ``We're working closely with the Ethiopians,'' she said.
   Leland is chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger. He
has taken a keen interest in Africa's refugees, and visited the
same area in March, officials said.
   The camp the group had been headed for is run by the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees. It is home to about thousands
of refugees who have fled civil war in neighboring Sudan.
   The plane's takeoff Monday morning was delayed about two hours
because of bad weather, officials said.
   Planes must fly over rugged terrain to reach the refugee camp,
but the aircraft would not pass over the area where rebels are
battling Ethiopia's government. Ethiopia's separatist movements are
based in the northern part of the country in the Horn of Africa.
   ``We think it's very premature to be concerned at this point,''
said Timmie Jensen, a spokeswoman for the House Select Committee on
Hunger, which Leland heads.
   ``This kind of thing comes up when you're in the bush,'' she
said.
   Alma Newsom, another Leland spokeswoman, said, ``For all
practical purposes, they're cut off. They're going to be overdue
all night. They're going to be overnight in the camp.''
   ``My guess is once en route, the camp that was the original
destination was too far and they opted to go to a different camp,''
Ms. Newsom said. ``Even at that, once they got on the ground and
began their tour, they simply ran out of time to end their tour and
get back.''
   She said pilots were very strict about adhering to a 5 p.m.
curfew to return to Addis Ababa.

   State spending on prisons and health care
continued to climb and eat into education budgets in 1989, but most
states are financially healthy, according to a report released
Monday at a national meeting of legislators.
   The report by the fiscal staff of National Conference of State
Legislatures showed that education, though considered the No. 1
issue across the country, did not fare much better in spending than
other areas in most states.
   More than 5,000 people, mainly legislators and state officials
and staff, are expected to attend the weeklong convention.
   The overall increase in spending in state budgets was 7.2
percent _ up from 6.6 percent a year ago.
   Spending on corrections _ principally for prison capital needs
and operations _ rose by 14.1 percent among the states as a whole,
while the increase in Medicaid costs was 10.4 percent.
   Elementary-secondary education spending rose by 7.8 percent, and
funding for colleges and universities jumped 7.3 percent.
   Education makes up more than 50 percent of state budgets across
the country.
   West Virginia, which had to pour money into teacher retirement
and health insurance, had the largest increase in education funding
with 25.7 percent.
   Next were Illinois with a 17.7 percent increase, Nevada and New
Hampshire with 16.8 percent, Ohio with 15.2 percent and Georgia
with 14.7 percent.
   The report, however, showed that states have an estimated $10.9
billion in reserves _ or 4.4 percent of states' general funds.
That's the highest amount of reserve fund balances in nine years.
   Steven Gold, director of fiscal affairs for the NCSL, said most
states are ``comfortable'' from a financial standpoint. But, Gold
said, ``the margin that is protecting them from being uncomfortable
is not so large.''
   Louisiana Senate President Pro Tempore Samuel Nunez Jr., NCSL
president, said experience has shown that financial conditions
among states can change rapidly and often are tied to the national
economy.
   ``The greatest concentration of fiscal problems this year was in
the New England states and in New York and New Jersey, places that
just two years ago were faring better than most states.''
   Nunez also pointed out that 1989 was ``an active year for state
tax policy,'' with tax increases totaling $3.5 billion in 30 states.
   In 1980, states had reserve fund balances totaling $11.8
million. Lee Daniels, NCSL president-elect and minority leader of
the Illinois House, noted that two years later ``many states were
in severe difficulty as they felt the effects of a national
recession.''
   ``The current fiscal health is certainly not a cause for
complacency,'' Daniels said.
   Increased spending on prisons comes at a time of declining crime
in many areas. Gold tied the cause to court-ordered prison
improvements and tougher sentencing guidelines.
   Nunez said the economic future of states is clouded by large
trade and federal budget deficits and about what will happen to
federal aid and federal mandates on various programs.
   He said unfunded federal mandates have added billions of dollars
in new responsibilities to the states in recent years.
   Federal initiatives in welfare reform, catastrophic health care
and nursing home legislation will raise state costs by more than $2
billion per year, Nunez said.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Monday that Mexico, after years of stagnation, has become an
economic model for other debtor nations because of the ``bold,
far-sighted policies'' of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   He also said that Mexico's record over the past six months in
cracking down on drug trafficking has made clear the government's
commitment that ``it wants to tear the roots of the opium poppy and
marijuana plant from its soil.''
   Baker spoke at the ceremonial opening of daylong talks that
featured the presence of an unusually large array of senior Bush
administration officials. With Baker were 40 other officials,
including four Cabinet members.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady set the tone for the
discussions, telling a morning news conference that ``great
progress has been made in economic and financial fields that are
important to our two countries.''
   Brady hailed the debt agreement Mexico reached with commercial
banks two weeks ago that provides for, among other things, a
reduction in Mexico's debt servicing obligations. Payments on the
country's $107 billion foreign debt have contributed to a sharp
decline in living standards over the past seven years.
   Brady said that Mexico has taken steps to make the business
climate here more favorable for foreign investment and to lower
barriers to trade. Tax reform and deregulation also will help
stimulate economic growth, he said.
   Later, Baker, standing before the assembled delegations at a
Foreign Ministry conference room for the opening ceremony, said:
``The United States has no more important relationship than with
its neighbor and friend, the Republic of Mexico. These are not mere
words _ they represent the solemn commitment of the United States.''
   Expanding on Brady's comments about Mexico's economic policies,
Baker said Mexico's ``bold, far-sighted'' approach has convinced
the private banks and international lending institutions that
``Mexico is worthy of credit and trust.''
   ``We believe that Mexico can once again set an example that
other nations can follow,'' Baker said. At his news conference,
Brady expressed hope that similar debt reduction agreements can be
reached with the Philippines, Venezuela, Costa Rica and Morocco.
   Afterwards, Baker praised the talks as ``very productive and
highly successful.''
   Mexico's Foreign Affairs Minister Fernando Solana was far more
restrained in his remarks. After the meeting, he said the
discussions were carried out ``in an atmosphere of mutual respect''
and were marked by ``intelligent analyses'' of the problems of the
two nations.
   At the opening ceremony, he praised the ``high level of maturity
and cordiality'' between the two countries, but said Mexico will
never surrender its Latin American identity despite its
geographical proximity to the United States.
   ``We want to be evermore good friends of the United States but
never at the cost of affecting the values which determine our
essence and which shape us as a nation,'' he said.
   He said that U.S. foreign investment in Mexico is far less than
what it should be and that the improvement in East-West relations
should lead to an increase in the resources the United States makes
available for development and well-being.
   But based on the remarks of Baker and Brady, U.S. relations with
Mexico have come a long way since the period during the Reagan
administration of mutual recriminations over drug trafficking and
Central America policy.
   Mexico's perceived role as one of the staunchest supporters in
the hemisphere of Nicaragua's leftist government and the rebel
movement in El Salvador embittered officials of the Reagan
administration.
   With the almost simultaneous advent of the Bush and Salinas
admininistrations, Central America has faded as an issue and there
is a sense in Washington that Mexico is far more serious now about
confronting drug smugglers.
   Baker acknowledged that the United States bears part of the
blame for the drug problem because of the ``senseless demand'' for
drugs, a statement that reflects a long-held Mexican view.
   Mexico has been a principal source of heroin and marijuana and a
transit point for U.S.-bound cocaine shipments. Mexican officials
believe a reduction in U.S. demand is the most effective means of
combating the problem.
   Nonetheless, Baker said Salinas has taken decisive action on the
drug issue. ``Mexico's success over the past six months in
capturing and prosecuting drug traffickers has seized the world's
attention.''
   The other Cabinet members who joined Baker and Brady for the
talks, held under the auspices of the U.S.-Mexico Binational
Commission, were Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher and U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills.
   Also on the agenda were issues relating to the U.S.-Mexican
border, the environment, fisheries, trade and investment and
cultural ties.

<HEAD>Government Agreement With Rebels Approved By National Assembly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Assembly on Monday
approved a cease-fire in Suriname's 3-year-old guerrilla war that
was signed by the government and rebels in late July.
   The 51-member assembly deliberated eight hours before voting
44-2 for the cease-fire.
   Prime Minister Henk Arron said disputes with the army over the
terms of the accord had been overcome. He said the truce will be
implemented within the next weeks after the final wording is put
together.
   The Surinamese military, which ruled the country until 1987, had
protested provisions of the agreement that allow the rebels to keep
their weapons and eventually join the South American nation's
police force.
   The government and rebels agreed in principle to the accord on
July 22 at a meeting in French Guiana.
   It was to end the fighting in eastern Suriname between
government forces and the rebels, led by Ronnie Brunswijk, 27, a
former bodyguard to Lt. Col. Desi Bouterse who ruled Suriname from
1980-1987.
   Bouterse was replaced by a civilian government in 1987
elections, but the army still has influence in Surinamese politics
under a state of emergency in large parts of the nation.
   The truce also calls for an end to the state of emergency and
for an aid program for eastern Suriname, where Brunswijk has his
power base.
   The three-year strife, which is seen as a personal feud between
Brunswijk and Bouterse, has cost hundreds of lives.
   Suriname, a nation of 400,000, gained independence from Holland
in 1975.

   About 600 pro-choice and anti-abortion
demonstrators held competing rallies Monday to gain the attention
of lawmakers attending the National Conference of State
Legislatures.
   Nearly 5,000 delegates are attending the non-partisan group's
six-day annual meeting. Busloads of delegates were confronted by
opposing demonstrations Monday evening.
   The U.S. Supreme Court last month upheld a Missouri law that
placed restrictions on abortions, giving back to states the right
to restrict access to abortions.
   ``We just want to be sure they understand there are a lot of
people in the pro-life majority,'' said Clayton Lewis, director of
the Biblical Action League.
   Across the street, Lesa Kubik, spokeswoman for the Tulsa
Pro-Choice organization, said her group wanted to send a message to
legislators: ``My Lord, if this is happening in Oklahoma, what's
happening in my state?
   ``We're in Oklahoma. We're in the Bible Belt. We're in one of
the most conservative areas of the United States. These are people
who are angry that (the Supreme Court decision) has happened,'' Ms.
Kubik said.
   Observers estimated the groups at 300 people apiece.
   Jerald Larry, a Texas state representative from Dallas, watched
the demonstrations and said it reminded him of the ``lively
debate'' over the issue in Texas last session.
   Bob Price, a state assemblyman from Las Vegas, Nev., watched the
crowd with a smile.
   ``I really like the fact that in America, both sides can point
out their thoughts. It's just wonderful,'' he said.
   ``I'm not looking forward to this when we take it up,'' he
added. ``It's going to be the most contentious issue we've had in a
long time.''
   The lawmakers are to disuss abortion at a session on Wednesday.

   The government said Monday it was
ready to begin talks on extending U.S. military bases beyond 1991
and would speed up studies on alternative uses of the facilities if
they are closed.
   National Security Council adviser, Rafael Ileto told reporters,
``We are ready for talks now.'' He said the United States should
propose a date for the beginning of negotiations.
   ``The council examined the security arrangements between the two
countries, particularly the U.S. Military Bases Agreement, which
expires in September 1991,'' Ileto said.
   ``It noted the need for the early resolution of the bases issue
and decided to speed up the completion of plans for the alternative
uses of the U.S. military facilities.''
   The United States maintains six bases in the Philippines,
including Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay Naval Base. They are
among the largest U.S. military garrisons outside the continental
United States.
   Under the Philippine constitution any extension of the bases
must come under a bilateral treaty subject to approval by
two-thirds of the 23-member Senate, where opposition to the
installations is strong.
   President Corazon Aquino has refused to say whether she supports
an extension. In October the United States and the Philippines
reached an agreement allowing the bases to remain until 1991 in
return for $962 million in U.S. military and economic aid over two
years.
   The two countries are expected to begin preliminary talks on a
new treaty later this year. Mrs. Aquino is expected to discuss the
issue when she visits Washington, probably in November.
   About 40,000 American troops, civilian workers and military
dependents are stationed at the facilities.
   Opponents of the bases have suggested the facilities could be
used for commercial ship repair, export processing zones and
industrial parks to soften the economic effects of any U.S. troop
withdrawal.
   On Friday, Singapore's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs,
George Yeo, told parliament that the island nation wanted the
United States to maintain its military presence in the region and
had offered to host some facilities.
   Yeo's statement was seen as an attempt by Singapore to make it
easier for the Manila government to extend the bases agreement. The
Philippines has complained that other non-communist Southeast Asian
nations were unwilling to share the political burden of hosting the
bases.

   U.S. financial support, direct or through
proxies, has kept the Nicaraguan resistance movement _ the Contras
_ going since 1981, but at the price of almost endless controversy
between administrations eager to block the consolidation of a
second Marxist-Leninist government in the region and congressional
opponents of intervention.
   Currently, the Bush administration and its Democratic opponents
in Congress are operating under an agreement to provide the Contras
with $49.8 million for food, clothing and other supplies, but no
arms or ammunition, through Feb. 28, 1990, at the rate of $4.5
million a month. The money can be used for resettlement.
   Separately, the Contra leadership in Miami has been receiving a
reported $400,000 a month but that was cut in half in the spring.
Last month the Contra leadership there said it was told to expect
further cuts.
   The agreement between Congress and the administration provides
that the money will stop as of Nov. 30 if Democratic congressional
leaders are not satisfied with the administration's efforts to
support peace.
   The Bush administration had been hoping to keep the Contras
together as a force until after the Nicaraguan elections next
February. Congressional critics have said this effort could be a
violation of their aid agreement with the president.
   The entire Iran-Contra affair revolved around attempts by
elements of the Reagan administration, led by Lt. Col. Oliver North
of the National Security Council staff and CIA Director William
Casey, to divert profits from the secret sale of arms to Iran to
the Contras during a period when Congress had forbidden the use of
U.S. funds.
   As part of that effort, other nations were solicited and some
were ranted aid.
   The House first voted to cut off aid to the Contras in 1983,
after two annual secret appropriations of $19 million each. A later
compromise made $24 million in open aid available to the rebels
that year.
   Another vote to cut off aid came in 1984 after reports that the
CIA had mined Nicaraguan harbors.
   Late in 1984 Congress set aside $14 million but did not release
it, and banned support for paramilitary operations in Nicaragua
without congressional approval.
   An adverse House vote early in 1985 kept the $14 million from
being released although the Senate voted in favor.
   During the summer of 1985 Congress approved $27 million in
``humanitarian'' aid and barred the CIA and the military from any
role in distribution of the funds.
   In the fall of 1986, Congress approved $100 million, a large
part of it for military aid, and lifted restrictions on the CIA.
   Early in 1987, the House tried to hold up the final $40 million
of the $100 million approved the previous year, but the Senate
refused to go along.
   When the 1988 fiscal year began on Sept. 30, 1987, a series of
temporary aid measures began that eventually provided $30 million.
   Early in 1988, Congress killed President Reagan's request for
$36 million in aid, and in March of that year the Contras made a
truce with the Sandinista government. Congress that voted to
provide $48 million, but rejected a request for $47 million in the
summer.
   After he took office, President Bush decided he had no chance of
winning military aid and negotiated his deal with his congressional
critics. A key Bush aide, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray,
suggested in a bizarre episode that the agreement could amount to
an unconstitutional abrogation of the president's powers.

   An 87-year-old patient at a boarding
home was mistaken for dead and turned over to a funeral home, where
she startled a mortician preparing to embalm her.
   Carrie Stringfellow was listed in fair condition Monday night at
Mercy Medical Center, said spokeswoman Vicky Forrest.
   Dennis L. Porter, director of the Dennis L. Porter Funeral Home,
said he was called to a nearby boarding home Saturday evening to
pick up a body.
   When he returned, Porter said, he started to take the woman off
the ``death cot'' and move her onto the embalming table when ``she
made a noise _ uttered something.''
   ``That drew my attention,'' Porter said. ``It was quite
shocking.''
   The mortician said he then discovered that woman's eyes were
fluttering and she had a faint pulse. He called an an emergency
squad, which took the woman to the hospital.
   Ms. Forrest said Ms. Stringfellow was not lucid Monday and could
not receive visitors or answer questions. She said Ms. Stringfellow
was unaware of what had happened.
   The hospital has asked the state ombudsman's office to
investigate the circumstances that preceded the woman's admission
to the hospital, Ms. Forrest said.
   Porter said Ms. Stringfellow had not been examined by doctor
before she was turned over to him. Doctors are not required to make
such examinations if death appears to be from natural causes, he
said.
   ``Doctors don't go around examining a body every time a person
dies,'' Porter said. ``She did appear to be dead. This appeared to
be from natural causes. ... If I thought there had been foul play,
I would have called the coroner.''
   The operator of the boarding home, Robbie Caldwell, refused to
comment Monday.

   Stymied by repeated attempts to reach
agreement on a timetable to disband the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan
rebels, five Central American presidents meet today to conclude
their three-day summit.
   ``There is no accord about a timetable, but there is agreement
on mechanisms,'' the president of Honduras, Jose Azcona, said
Sunday night in this beach resort.
   Azcona and the presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala
and Costa Rica agreed in February to engineer the demobilization of
the U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, but they put off coming
up with a specific plan until this meeting.
   The U.S. government was not invited to participate in the talks
but sent four observers. About 11,000 Contra fighters and their
families are in camps in Honduras near the Nicaraguan border.
   Azcona said the talks had three main points: a timetable on the
Contras, El Salvador's 9-year-old civil war and Nicaragua's case
against Honduras, which has let the Contras operate from its
territory for years, at the World Court in The Hague.

   Thirty states raised taxes in the
post-election year legislative sessions of 1989, including six
states that enacted broad increases in personal income taxes, a
survey of the states shows.
   Net tax cuts were set for the coming year in another 11 states,
although in most cases the cuts were small.
   Passed despite intense political opposition to federal tax
increases voiced by President Bush and others, the state actions
are expected to produce a net increase in revenue amounting to $3.5
billion in fiscal 1990.
   That is only a fraction of the $280 billion in revenue of all
the 50 states, but compares to a small net tax decrease of the
previous year, according to the survey conducted by the National

   Foreign countries are gaining access to U.S.
government technology that could help them develop atomic weapons,
says a congressional report that blames the situation on
conflicting laws and erratic enforcement.
   Despite laws limiting the release of such data, ``sensitive
countries ... have obtained information dealing with detonators,
explosives and firing sets that could assist or enhance nuclear
weapons development,'' said the report by the General Accounting
Office, Congress' investigative arm.
   ``Sensitive'' countries were defined as communist-ruled or those
suspected of clandestine nuclear weapons programs. Of these, Iraq,
Israel, Pakistan, India, Argentina, South Africa, South Korea,
Taiwan, Bulgaria and China were named as buying sensitive
nuclear-related data from the U.S. Energy Department through
routine orders or subscriptions, along with nine other countries
including major allies.
   ``Many experts believe that the United States indirectly
assisted India through the liberal publication of unclassified
(fuel) reprocessing information,'' to stage its ``explosion of a
peaceful nuclear device in 1974,'' the report noted.

   No religious group appears to be more or less susceptible to

   A Central American summit bogged down on
Monday _ its final day _ with Nicaragua accusing the United States
of pressuring the region's governments to scuttle the peace process.
   ``The United States is exerting great pressure so no agreement
is reached,'' Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega told reporters.
``They are in direct contact with all the delegations except

<HEAD>The Changing Face of London Hit Shows</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrew Lloyd Webber's latest musical ``Aspects of
Love'' is sporting a revised ending and a new song in the second
act even though it only opened in April.
   Peter Shaffer took a fresh look at his comedy hit, ``Lettice and
Lovage,'' and changed endings and the cast changed last fall.
   Increasingly, London shows are evolving during their runs in
ways distinct from both the usual recasting and adjustments that
occur when a show moves to New York or has a long run.
   Directors and writers are having a second look at their work on
home turf. If need be, changes are being made.
   ``The first ending is history,'' Shaffer, the Tony-winning
author of ``Equus'' and ``Amadeus,'' said of ``Lettice and Lovage.''
   The comedy's October 1987 Globe Theater debut finished with the
two stars, Maggie Smith and Margaret Tyzack, plotting to destroy
London's worst buildings with a medieval bronze weapon.
   ``Version one got lots of pleasurable laughs,'' Shaffer, 63,
said in an interview. ``But I suspected once the public got in
their cars, they may have thought, `A pity it went silly in the
end.'''
   Now, instead of two dotty architectural terrorists, the women
imagine themselves tour guides for the ``Eyesore Negation
Detachment,'' leading intrepid visitors around the 50 ugliest
buildings in London.
   ``It gives them a job; it employs what they're good at,'' said
Shaffer. He put in the new ending when Geraldine McEwan and Sara
Kestelman took over the roles last October.
   The play's Broadway bow with the original stars next March will
use the new ending. ``I think it's right now,'' said Shaffer.
``It's better than the original.''
   Shaffer said he would never implement a rewrite until there is a
change of cast or _ as on Broadway _ a fresh staging.
   The creators of ``Aspects'' had no such qualms. No sooner had
the long-awaited musical opened April 17 at the Prince of Wales
Theater than revisions were being discussed. On June 16, in they
went.
   ``You rehearse it in front of Frank Rich, basically,'' said
actress Kathleen Rowe McAllen, referring to The New York Times
critic who saw the show at the June 17 matinee.
   ``It's a matter of fine tuning and honing,'' co-lyricist Don
Black said. ``There were certain things we wanted to do (before the
opening), and there wasn't really time.''
   The changes in ``Aspects'' focus on McAllen's character,
Giulietta, an Italian sculptress who has affairs with both an aging
English aristocrat (Kevin Colson), and his younger wife, a French
actress (Ann Crumb).
   A new song in the second act, ``There's More to Love Than Making
Love,'' replaces the initial ``With Other Men'' to make Giulietta
more than just a ``promiscuous Italian,'' said McAllen.
   Originally, the show ended where it began _ at a train station
in Pau in southwest France, as the romantic lead (Michael Ball)
prepared to leave with Giulietta possibly in tow.
   Now, it ends in the aristocrat's garden with the romantic leads
in a clear romantic clinch. Of all the musical's permutations, here
at last is one that may endure, and the new ending is meant to
satisfy audiences who may have felt confused or let down by the
original finale.
   ``It finishes on a high,'' said Black, who went on to quote his
American colleague, composer-lyricist Stephen Sondheim: ``Stephen
says, `Musicals aren't written, they're rewritten,' and this is
very much the case.
   ``It's not like the old days on the road where you sling a song
out or write a new scene. You have to live with a score and let it
settle to see if it sits properly with the audience.''
   In London, too, preview periods are much briefer than on
Broadway, so that adjustments are more easily made after the
opening.
   Black said ``Aspects'' was now frozen for London but would no
doubt change further when it opens on Broadway next April. ``The
tinkering isn't done.''
   Echoed critic Mark Steyn in The Independent newspaper, ``While
the show has been sharpened ... `Aspects' still has much to be
fixed.''
   ``Follies,'' ``Les Miserables'' and ``Chess'' are other recent
shows that changed during their London engagements.
   But the phenomenon is not limited to blockbuster musicals of the
1980s.
   Oscar Wilde's 1895 masterpiece ``The Importance of Being
Earnest'' was originally in four acts. The version now being
performed has three.
   Tennessee Williams wrote two separate third acts for his 1955
``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'' More recently, producer Joseph Papp shut
down rehearsals of Albert Innaurato's ``Coming of Age in Soho''
off-Broadway to allow the playwright to overhaul his play.

<HEAD>Tension Over Vietnamese Boat People Coming to a Head in Hong Kong</HEAD>
<HEAD>By DAN BIERS</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Hong Kong's muggy summer moves relentlessly
on, long-simmering tension over the skyrocketing population of
Vietnamese boat people in the British colony is coming to a boil.
   Hong Kong residents are increasingly bitter about the 52,000
Vietnamese now in camps after sailing in rickety wooden boats from
their communist homeland in search of a better life.
   And the boat people could become increasingly difficult to
control if Britain and Vietnam agree on a program that would
forcible send most of them back.
   ``I think the Hong Kong people in general are fed up with the
problem,'' said Allen Lee, the senior member of the Legislative
Council, which approves Hong Kong's laws. ``The reason for this is
the continuing influx.''
   More than 23,000 boat people sailed into Hong Kong from May to
July, an 84 percent jump from the corresponding period a year
earlier.
   Resettlement of the Vietnamese asylum-seekers in third countries
has lagged far behind, creating a crisis of accommodation for the
new arrivals.
   Existing detention centers are overcrowded. Riots broke out in
two camps late in July, one after guards tried to prevent boat
people from escaping through holes cut in the fence and another
after a squabble between Vietnamese women from rival groups.
   ``When large numbers of people are kept cooped up in camps,
particularly in hot weather, there is bound to be a great deal of
discomfort and frustration,'' Secretary of Security Geoffrey Barnes
said after the first disturbance.
   Meanwhile, government plans to build makeshift camps to house
the flood of newcomers have met resistance from Hong Kong
residents. In the most recent example, scores of villagers pitched
tents on a construction site to stop work on a new detention center
in rural Sai Kung.
   Reports of boat people escaping, of severe staff shortages at
the detention centers and alleged police brutality toward the
Vietnamese have added to the crisis atmosphere.
   Raymond Chung, an official who represents a Hong Kong district
that has a detention center, said his constituents now are more
concerned about the boat people than the violent crackdown on
dissent in Beijing, which has horrified this territory that returns
to Chinese sovereignty in eight years.
   Ironically, the hardline stance against accepting the Vietnamese
comes as Hong Kong residents are demanding that Britain offer them
refuge because of the Chinese communist crackdown on the mainland.
   ``I think the situation is completely different,'' Chung said.
``We are claiming our rights'' as British subjects.
   In an effort to end the flood of boat people, Britain decided
that all Vietnamese arriving after June 1988, would have to prove
they fled their homeland in fear of persecution or face
repatriation.
   Negotiations with the Vietnamese government to set up a system
of forcible repatriation of Vietnamese who fail to qualify as
political refugees are under way. A Hong Kong government screening
system has determined that roughly four of every five arrivals will
be sent back.
   The United States is among those criticizing forcible
repatriation and this has irritated some Hong Kong people. They say
the U.S. position, which they believe stems from a sense of moral
responsibility for its role in the Vietnam War, should be backed by
promises to resettle more boat people in the United States.
   What affect the U.S. opposition will have on the program is not
clear, but many Hong Kong people clearly hope repatriation begins
soon despite concerns of increased tension in the detention centers.
   Boat people already have staged hunger strikes to protest plans
for forcible repatriation and hundreds of makeshift weapons have
been found during searches of the camps. The U.S. Consulate in Hong
Kong received a letter from one Vietnamese who wrote in blood:
``Save my soul.''
   While the number of boat people who have volunteered to return
to Vietnam has increased in recent weeks, they still account for
only a tiny fraction of the total population.
   Chris Bale, the director of the relief agency Oxfam Hong Kong,
sees a ``potentially explosive situation'' in the camps once
mandatory repatriation begins.
   But he believes efforts should continue on a repatriation
program so long as safeguards are in place to ensure that political
refugees do not have to return home and that people sent back will
not face persecution.

<HEAD>Solomon Islander Keeps Memeory of Guadalcanal Battle Alive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER O'LOUGHLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GUADALCANAL, Solomon Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fred Kona has been waiting
20 years for an invitation to Washington to present his shell money
and war club to American veterans of the Battle of Guadalcanal 47
years ago in World War II.
   Japanese veterans of the battle took him to Japan in 1985 and
he's hoping the Americans ask him to the United States. He gave the
Japanese shell money, highly prized by Solomon Islanders and
usually used to buy brides.
   ``But I got no money to go Washington,'' Kona said.
   The 50-year-old Solomon Islander says he regards himself as a
peace envoy.
   He is well known to veterans of both sides who have returned to
the site of one the Pacific war's greatest battles.
   Among the coconut palms and jungle of his 214-acre plantation,
he has assembled a collection of World War II memorabilia.
   ``Look, this Japanese gun was designed by British, this one by
German,'' he said in pidgin English. ``This plane is Grumman
Wildcat. Fly very high to dive on Japanese ships.''
   His collection is virtually the only reminder of the great naval
and land battle that began Aug. 7, 1942, and ended the following
February. The Americans lost 1,600 men killed and 4,200 wounded in
taking the island. Japanese casualties were estimated at 15,000
killed or missing.
   Kona has the wreckage of a twin-tailed P-38 Lockheed Lightning
that was shot down by the Japanese and salvaged from the sea.
   He paid $400 for it.
   When he first began collecting wrecked planes from the jungle in
1969, he cut them into pieces so he could carry them.
   ``I misunderstanding, so I cut them,'' he said, adding he
learned later it would have been better to have kept the planes
intact.
   ``There plenty of good planes all over until the 1960s, but
people sold them for scrap.''
   Hauling fragments of wreckage from the jungles over the years,
he built up a collection of planes, guns, shells and helmets that
many Japanese and American veterans come to look at when they
return to Guadalcanal each year, particularly in August. Many of
them weep when they see them.
   In recognition of his efforts, the U.S. government presented
Kona with an American flag that had flown over the White House in
Washington.
   Australian veterans, to commerate the sinking of the flagship
HMAS Canberra in a famous engagement alongside the USS Houston
against the Japanese in the Battle of Savo Island, put up a plaque
in his garden.
   Next to it is a marble stone memorial from the ``Guadalcanal
Combined Veterans (USA).''
   And it stands next to another simple stone memorial with this
inscription in English:
   ``The Repose of Souls _ Tens of thousands of young men who fell
in battle sleep here. May the tragic events that occurred on this
island in World War II (1942-43) be forever inscribed on our
memories. War brings all sides nothing but grief and distress. It
must never happen again. To the souls of these departed youth our
only words of tribute are the renunciation of war.
   ``People of the world, let us take this pledge and may the blue
sea, the great expanse of sky and this green island be a
testimonial of eternal peace.
   ``Sleep peacefully, fallen friends.
   ``This monument was erected in memory of deceased friends by a
former Japanese soldier, August 1983.''

<DATELINE>NAMIBE, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This tranquil, prosperous south Atlantic
port is an example of what Angola could be like if peace takes hold
and a 14-year-old civil war comes to an end.
   With its neat pink houses and joggers running along the
oceanfront boulevard at dusk, Namibe looks like Angola's past when
Portugal ran it and its future under independent black rule.
   But even Namibe, sandwiched between the ocean and the Namibian
desert, suffers from the devastating effects of the war and the
rapid pullout of the Portuguese after they granted independence in
1975.
   The city, known as Mocamedes during Portuguese colonial years,
is now a focal point of a $500-million reconstuction plan of the
United Nations Development Program to rebuild infrastructure and
attract foreign investment in southern Angola.
   ``Namibe has not suffered much from the war. ... It's enormously
rich,'' said Otto Essien, the U.N. program's representative in
Luanda, Angola's capital.
   Once peace takes hold, he added, Angola will be among the most
attractive countries in Africa for foreign investors.
   But peace is only the first step in rebuilding Angola's
unwieldy, centralized socialist economy. According to a report by
the World Bank and the U.N., economic mismanagement and inadequate
policies, along with the war and mass exodus of skilled Portuguese
labor after independence, are the main reasons for Angola's poor
economic performance.
   Angola is a vast, fertile country, twice the size of France,
whose wealth of oil and more than 30 types of minerals, including
uranium, diamonds and iron ore, could easily make its estimated 9
million people among the richest in Africa.
   Peace is edging slowly closer as the Marxist governmen and
U.S.-backed rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola pursue sporadic talks in neighboring Zaire.
   ``Over the last six months, we've seen more interest in foreign
investment and we're happy about that,'' said Francois Moulinier,
economic counsellor with the European Economic Community's
delegation in Angola.
   The diamond giant de Beers, the French bankers Paribas, the
Dutch brewer Heineken and several U.S. and European oil companies
are likely to be joined by other foreign firms eager to do business
in Angola.
   In Namibe, a fishing port on Angola's 1,000-mile seaboard,
Italian and Spanish flags flutter on the sterns of rows of
hard-worked fishing boats.
   Portuguese construction companies are building on the sandy
outskirts, and the Italians plan a joint venture to mine the area's
marble quarries.
   Annual economic growth averaged less than 1 percent over the
first 10 years after independence, according to World Bank and U.N.
data. Oil, pumped by U.S. and French firms, kept the official war
effort afloat, but production of once major exports like diamonds,
coffee and sugar has slumped by as much as 90 percent from pre-1975
levels.
   In addition, the war consumes as much as 40 percent of the
government's annual budget and has wrecked rail and road networks,
disrupting distribution of food and goods.
   Tens of thousands of Angolans have been killed in the fighting
and many more left crippled by land mines. The International Red
Cross estimates the war has made more than 600,000 people homeless.
   The Marxist-Leninist government, keen to attract more Western
capital, acknowledged as early as December, 1985, that it needed
free-market reforms.
   In August, 1987, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos announced an
ambitious economic and financial restructuring program. It called
for slashing state spending, closing or selling unprofitable state
enterprises and revitalizing the banking system.
   A new foreign investment law permits the establishment of mixed
state-private companies and guarantees foreigners' rights to send
profits and capital back home.
   Angola also is becoming a member of the International Monetary
Fund, which is expected to clear the way for a rescheduling of a
$4-billion foreign debt.
   ``The government has been quite open about economic reform. The
orientation's good, but the problem is implementation. It's a
mammoth task,'' said the EEC's Mouilinier.
   IMF membership also is likely to bring about the long-awaited
devaluation of the kwanza, the national currency, from 30 to 60 to
the U.S. dollar and then to 120. A new, controlled issue of bank
notes could mean drastic belt-tightening for many Angolans.
   On the parallel market, kwanzas currently are exchanged at rates
of 2,500 to 3,000 to the dollar.
   Even in the relatively well-off Namibe, much remains to be
overcome. Outdoor restrauants do a snappy trade, but diners look
resigned when told there's no beer.
   ``It's Wednesday,'' sighs one. State-owned trucks deliver beer
to Namibe only on Thursdays and that supply is often gone after the
weekend.

   The day after his wife died, an 83-year-old
man sat in his dining room, surrounded by relatives, crying. ``Why
did she have to leave me?'' he moaned. Then he went into the
bedroom and killed himself.
   A former hard-driving insurance executive in his 60s, unable to
adjust to the slower pace of retirement and depressed because of
the loss of identity he derived from his work, took a job pumping
gas six months after settling in a retirement community. Three
months later, he committed suicide.
   An 82-year-old man with the debilitating and ultimately fatal
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis _ Lou Gehrig's disease _ was becoming
increasingly helpless. Not wishing to burden his wife, he slashed
his wrists and bled to death.
   The cases are typical of what experts say is a growing
phenomenon, but one that can go unrecognized because some deaths
aren't obviously suicide.
   ``I've known people who would just sit in their apartments and
eat nothing but 2 or 3 pieces of toast a day. Eventually they die
from malnutrition,'' said Dr. Marv Miller, a San Diego
gerontologist who wrote in 1979 that the elderly ``are deadly
serious about killing themselves.''
   As the older population grows in a youth-oriented society, the
problem is worsening, Miller said. ``In some societies older people
are venerated and respected, but not in this one.
   ``Once people are out of the work force and no longer
contributing to the productivity of society in an economic sense,
society no longer has any use for them. This is a shame because
after the Depression this country was built back by the people who
are now the elderly.''
   In 1986, the most recent figures available, the nation's suicide
rate was 12.8 per 100,000 people. For those 65 and over, the rate
was 21.6 per 100,000; within that group, the breakdown was 19.7 for
ages 65-74; 25.2 for those 75-84; and 20.8 for those 85 and older.
Ten years previously, those rates were 17.8, 20.8 and 17.9,
respectively.
   The National Center for Health Statistics, which compiles data
from death certificates, reported 2,146 suicides among people 19
and younger in 1986, and 6,275 in the 65-and-over group. Miller
said the actual number could exceed 10,000 because of the
under-reporting of elderly suicides.
   ``The figures are appalling,'' said Dr. Robert N. Butler, author
of the 1976 Pulitzer Prize-winning book ``Why Survive? Being Old in
America.''
   Cuts in social programs and changing attitudes may be partly to
blame for the 25 percent rise in late-life suicide since 1981, said
Dr. Nancy J. Osgood, a Medical College of Virginia gerontologist.
``In the last five or six years there has been a growing feeling
that suicide is an acceptable solution to deal with life's
problems, especially if you're old.''
   The problem is worse among men, particularly white men. In 1986,
the suicide rate among men aged 65-74 was 35.5, compared to 7.2 for
women. In the 75-84 group, the rates were 54.8 and 7.5; for 85 and
older, 61.6 and 4.7.
   ``Many men feel that when they are no longer working they have
no value. They have merged their work with their identity, which
precipitates an identity crisis upon retirement. They are
traumatized by so much free time,'' said Miller, author of
``Suicide After Sixty. The Final Alternative.''
   Today's elderly women, on the other hand, ``were wife and
mother, and maintain their same roles throughout life,'' he said.
They also can ask for help without it being interpreted as a sign
of weakness.
   ``Men can't do that,'' he said. ``Men can't even cry.''
   In addition to the loss of self-worth brought by retirement,
other major reasons for suicide among the elderly are loss of a
loved one, physical illness and, to a lesser extent, a motivation
to defy or control death, which Miller said is becoming more common
for people who are terminally ill.
   While shooting is the primary method among all suicides, the
elderly sometimes use covert techniques like starvation, refusal to
take medicine and overdosing on prescribed drugs. Such covert
suicide, combined with the stigma of taking one's life, leads to
under-reporting, Miller said.
   ``Someday, someone very close to a president will commit
suicide, and then there will be a hue and cry raised across the
country. We need the president to enunciate a clear policy to lower
the number of suicides by a certain time.''
   Reporting would be improved if doctors were taught to recognize
the signs of suicide, and outreach programs should be set up to
identify and treat potentially suicidal older people, experts say.
   The warning signs include behavior like stockpiling medicine,
changing wills and buying a gun. Other indications are extreme mood
and behavior swings, expressed feelings of hopelessness and
worthlessness, and major changes in weight, eating and sleeping
patterns.
   Only California, Delaware, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Rhode
Island have state-operated suicide prevention and intervention
programs aimed at older people, according to an October 1988 survey
for the American Association of Retired Persons. Virginia is
planning a statewide education effort.
   Nevada has the nation's highest rate of geriatric suicide at
32.2 per 100,000 people, followed by Arizona, California, Colorado,
Vermont, New Mexico, Idaho, Oregon, Virginia and Florida, said Dr.
John L. McIntosh, a psychologist at Indiana University who
specializes in the elderly. Massachusetts, with a rate of 9.9 per
100,000 people, was the nation's lowest.
   ``No one knows for sure'' why rates are high in some states,
said McIntosh, who wrote ``Suicide and the Elderly'' with Ms.
Osgood in 1986. The reason could lie in geographic isolation and
easy availability of firearms in rural areas.
   The suicide rate could be reduced by a national program that
encouraged the elderly to remain productive, said Butler, director
of geriatrics at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. He
suggested creating a National Senior Service Corps to take
advantage of the vast, untapped talent pool.
   There are any number of such programs for the young but none for
older people, he said. ``Once again as a society we're missing the
boat. We should create opportunities for the elderly to contribute
to society. It's a shame not to make use of such talent.''
   Miller suggested putting day care centers in nursing homes
``where elderly people, who have an affinity for children, would
care for them and even be paid for it.'' Corporate America also
could play a significant role by providing pre-and post-retirement
counseling and letting workers put in fewer hours three or four
years before they retire, cushioning the shock of leaving.
   ``Anyone without sensitivity to the problem is really
short-sighted,'' he said. ``We're all going to be elderly one day.''

   Fewer thrift institutions, lower deposit rates
for savers and reduced property values in some regions will result
from the landmark savings and loan legislation passed by Congress,
analysts say.
   The 1,000-page bill, adopted early Saturday, is the most
significant financial law adopted since the Depression. As the
largest government bailout ever, it will cost each taxpayer about
$1,000 over 30 years to close or merge hundreds of insolvent thrift
institutions hemorrhaging losses at the rate of $20 million a day.
   The measure provides the most sweeping reorganization of the
regulatory bureaucracy in 50 years. Beyond that, in highly visible
and more subtle ways, it touches anyone who pays taxes, deposits
money with a bank or S&amp;L, or owns real estate.

   Civilian unemployment dipped by 0.1 percentage

<HEAD>Thirty States Raising Taxes by $3.5 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty states raised taxes in the
post-election year legislative sessions of 1989, including six
states that enacted broad increases in personal income taxes, a
survey of the states shows.
   Net tax cuts were set for the coming year in another 11 states,
although in most cases the cuts were small.
   Passed despite intense political opposition to federal tax
increases voiced by President Bush and others, the state actions
are expected to produce a net increase in revenue amounting to $3.5
billion in fiscal 1990.
   That is only a fraction of the $280 billion in revenue of all
the 50 states, but compares to a small net tax decrease of the
previous year, according to the survey conducted by the National
Conference of State Legislatures.
   ``The high level of activity this year is typical of a
post-election year, since states tend to avoid tax increases when
an election is looming immediately ahead,'' said Steven Gold,
director of fiscal studies for the conference.
   The survey was part of a broader report being released today at
the Conference of State Legislatures' annual meeting in Tulsa, Okla.
   Some states approved packages raising several taxes, such as
Illinois, where the total was projected at more than $1 billion and
nearly 10 percent of state revenue last year, and Connecticut,
where the increase topped $800 million, or 18 percent of state
revenue.
   ``In Illinois, when we think something is important, we're
willing to pay for it,'' Republican Gov. Jim Thompson said.
   The largest income tax increases came in Illinois,
Massachusetts, Connecticut, North Dakota, Vermont and Montana, the
survey said. In Connecticut, the tax applies only to dividends,
interest and capital gains, not earned income.
   The tax increase total would have been even larger but for New
York. Although the New York legislature passed a number of
increases in taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and corporations, New
York was counted in the survey as a net tax decrease because of a
$1.2 billion income tax reduction passed in 1987 and scheduled to
take effect in October, Gold said.
   Taxes were raised in all regions of the country. In New England,
where an economic slowdown has hit states that only a few years ago
were booming, five of six states raised taxes, and only Maine cut
them.
   ``To a considerable extent, the most serious state fiscal
difficulties were in the Northeast, including New England states,
New York and New Jersey,'' Gold said.
   ``Their budget problems follow a four-year period when they were
among the fiscally strongest states in the nation. Most of them
increased their budgets substantially and reduced taxes during that
period, setting them up for problems this year.''
   Hawaii, where a budget surplus was projected, passed permanent
income tax reductions plus a one-time rebate of $125 per person.
Kansas and Maine also cut income taxes, according to the survey.
   Hawaii was the only state where tax cuts totaled more than 5
percent of revenue. Wisconsin cut taxes 3 percent.
   Gasoline and ``sin'' taxes were the most popular targets for
increases, the survey found.
   Sixteen states increased their motor fuels taxes by at least one
cent per gallon; 13 states raised cigarette taxes and seven raised
taxes on alcoholic beverages. Corporate income taxes were increased
in five states.
   Sales taxes were increased in Georgia, Connecticut, North Dakota
and Kansas, and West Virginia extended it to cover food.
Connecticut also broadened the tax to cover services such as
architectural design, consulting, lobbying, public relations,
repairs and some advertising.
   Many other miscellaneous taxes were raised, including increases
in real estate transfer taxes in six states. States are
increasingly turning to taxes on real estate sales as a source of
revenue, Gold said.
   ``States want to raise money without interfering with the
economy,'' he said. ``When you're talking about hundreds of
thousands of dollars for selling property, and paying 6 percent or
more to an agent, the state taking 1 or 1 and a half percent more
doesn't seem to make that much difference to people.''
   According to the survey, the following states have passed net
tax increases amounting to 5 percent or more of state revenue,
taking effect in the next fiscal year: Alaska, Connecticut,
Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, North Dakota, Rhode Island and
West Virginia.
   Raising taxes by 3 percent to 5 percent were: Nevada, North
Carolina, Tennessee and Vermont.
   Raising taxes 1 percent to 3 percent were: Arizona, Colorado,
Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, Nebraska, Ohio, Oregon and
Wyoming.
   Raising taxes less than 1 percent were: Arkansas, Florida,
Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South
Carolina, Washington.
   States listed as lowering taxes more than 1 percent were:
Hawaii, Wisconsin, Louisiana, New York, Virginia and Texas. Taxes
were lowered less than 1 percent in Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Maryland
and South Dakota.

<HEAD>Reports Say As Many As 30 Traders to Plead Guilty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As many as 30 commodity traders indicted in a
federal probe of Chicago's futures exchanges eventually will plead
guilty, according to a published report.
   Attorneys for some of the 46 traders indicted last week said
guilty pleas could come as early as Wednesday, when 21 defendants
who traded in the Japanese yen pit at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange are scheduled to be arraigned, The Chicago Tribune
reported in today's editions.
   It was thought last week that 14 traders would plead guilty
rather than face trial. The Tribune said it raised its estimate
over the weekend after interviewing defense lawyers.
   The charges range from pre-arranged trading to racketeering
conspiracy and tax fraud. Most of the charges involve schemes in
which traders allegedly pocketed part of the profit from trades
they made for customers while passing on to customers their
personal losses.
   The defendants traded in the yen and Swiss franc pits at the
Merc and the soybean and U.S. Treasury bond pits at the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Attorneys said decisions to plead guilty by some traders were
based on three considerations: government evidence against the
traders; the potentially heavy prison sentences and fines for a
conviction on racketeering charges; and new federal sentencing
guidelines that remove much judicial discretion.

<HEAD>Owners of Galesburg Newspaper File Lawsuit Seeking to Void Sale Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALESBURG, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deadline for sale of the Galesburg
Register-Mail to Thomson Newspaper of Toronto has passed, so the
Illinois newspaper's owners hope to void the sale agreement.
   The Register-Mail's owners have filed a lawsuit in U.S. District
Court asking that the $14.7 million contract with Thomson be
declared null and void.
   The Peoria Journal Star has made two tender offers for the
Register-Mail and two weekly newspapers, the Wrova Reporter and the
Galva News. Those offers are to expire on Thursday.
   One offer, for $15 million, involves creation of an employee
stock ownership plan, which offers significant tax benefits. The
second offer is for $16 million for a direct purchase.
   The lawsuit filed Friday states that Thomson repeatedly said it
would call off the deal if its purchase of the Register-Mail was
not completed as scheduled on June 30.
   ``Thomson now claims that its contract with the signing
shareholders is valid and enforceable and that it will neither
permit a sale to the Peoria Journal Star nor an unrestricted public
auction,'' the complaint stated.
   About 91 percent of the Register-Mail's shares already had been
tendered to Thomson when Judge Michael Mihm issued an injunction
blocking the sale on June 30.
   Former Register-Mail publisher John Pritchard, who also is a
trustee of a trust that controls 54 percent of the newspaper's
stock, asked for the injunction on the grounds that the other two
trustees had breached their fiduciary responsibilities by not
adequately considering other offers. He also charged that the two _
his brother, Lester Pritchard, and their cousin, Sally Day _ agreed
to sell to Thomson because of payments that would have bypassed the
trust.
   All three trustees joined together in Friday's action to void
the Thomson deal.
   Thomson has appealed Mihm's injunction to the 7th Circuit Court
of Appeals in Chicago, but a hearing has not yet been scheduled.
   Along with the injunction, Mihm had voided the tendering of the
trust's shares to Thomson and ordered the appointment of an
investment banker to evaluate all offers.

   The stock market gained ground today, recovering
a good measure of Friday's losses.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.02 to 2,660.47 in
the first half hour.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 567 up, 339 down and
490 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.27 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Interest rates, which had been falling sharply and steadily,
suddenly jumped on Friday after the Labor Department issued an
unexpectedly strong report on employment for July.
   But although the upswing in rates was a negative for stocks,
analysts said traders also interpreted the employment data as a
reprieve from recent recession worries.
   Takeover speculation, meanwhile, was fueled anew by reports that
UAL Corp. had attracted a bidder. UAL, whose stock was delayed in
opening, confirmed that it had received what it called a highly
conditional proposal from investor Marvin Davis of Los Angeles.

   Strikes by 157,000 telephone workers in 15
states and the nation's capital entered their first work week
today, slowing operator and directory assistance and delaying some
repairs and installations.
   The three ``Baby Bell'' regional phone companies assigned
managers to replace strikers, but as call volume increased at the
start of the business day the impact of the strike was clearly
evident to consumers needing operator assistance.
   ``I'm sorry, due to a work stoppage we are unable to provide you
normal directory assistance,'' said a recorded message that greeted
callers seeking information in New York from NYNEX Corp., one of
the companies hit by strikes Sunday. Similar recordings were being
used by the others, Bell Atlantic and Pacific Telesis.
   With no new negotiations scheduled, the walkouts threatened to
disrupt service in many of the nation's major business hubs,
including New York, San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh
and Washington, D.C.
   Informal talks were expected today, and resumption of formal
bargaining with all three companies hinged on those discussions.
The strikes involve major differences between labor and management
over wages, health insurance and other benefits.
   On strike were operators, technicians, sales, clerical, factory
and other workers at NYNEX, Bell Atlantic and Pacific Telesis.
Spared phone strikes were nine states in the Southeast served by
BellSouth, which reached a tentative agreement with the
Communications Workers of America late Saturday.
   Consumers dialing direct should notice little difference in
their service but those needing operator assistance faced some
delays, and spokesmen for the companies said repairs and
installations also will be stalled as managers try to fill in for
strikers.
   ``We have more than 20,000 management people filling in but we
have 60,000 strikers,'' said NYNEX spokesman Bob O'Brien. ``But
obviously there are fewer resources. Certainly (delays) will
occur.''
   The unions, preparing for the possibility of lengthy strikes,
this week will ask the AFL-CIO to adopt a support plan that
includes a call on unions, their members and others who live in the
affected areas to withhold payment on their local phone bills.
   The proposal will be presented to the 14-million-member labor
federation's executive council, which is holding its summer meeting
this week in Chicago.
   Three more regional phone companies face Saturday strike
deadlines. Those companies, Ameritech, US West and Southwestern
Bell, have 131,000 union workers and provide service in 24 states.
   Of the strikes than began Sunday the situation at NYNEX appeared
the most contentious. Major disputes over wages and a company
proposal to shift health insurance costs to workers have prevented
formal talks since Friday.
   The company provides service in New York and the six New England
states. Like Pacific Telesis and Bell Atlantic, NYNEX has used
management personnel to replace strikers.
   NYNEX has 60,000 union workers, two-thirds of whom are
represented by CWA. The International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers represents the remaining 20,000 and for the first time this
year has bargained with its onetime rival union.
   NYNEX was hit by a nine-day strike in 1986, the last time it
bargained with the unions.
   In all three strike situations, the unions and companies
remained well apart on the issues of wages and health insurance,
and a number of local issues remained unresolved in each set of
negotiations. The debate over health insurance has been the major
obstacle, with the unions resisting companies' efforts to shift
some costs to workers.
   Some progress was reported Sunday in talks between the two
unions and Pacific Telesis, but the two sides sparred over the
scope of the company's offer on the table when the strike was
called at midnight Saturday.
   Pacific Telesis serves parts of California and all of Nevada and
employs 44,500 union workers, all but 2,500 of them CWA members.
   The strike deadline at Bell Atlantic was extended as
negotiations continued past midnight Saturday, but a walkout was
called just before 7 a.m. Sunday because of a lack of progress.
   Bell Atlantic serves Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
CWA represents 41,000 Bell Atlantic workers, IBEW 11,500.
   Instead of posting pickets, the 64,000 union workers at
BellSouth were preparing for a ratification vote on their new
contract.
   The BellSouth agreement provides an immediate 4 percent pay
increase and cost of living adjustments in 1990 and 1991, BellSouth
officials said. The pact also provides employees up to 12 months of
child care leave and six months of medical coverage while on leave.

   Striking Eastern Airlines pilots generally remain
opposed to returning to work following meetings in several of the
carrier's major cities, a pilots union spokesman said today.
   Air Line Pilots Association members in Atlanta, New York and
Miami met on Sunday to discuss whether to continue the
five-month-old walkout, said ALPA spokesman Ron Cole.
   ``All the feedback we've gotten says there is strong support for
remaining on strike,'' said Cole.
   ALPA officials say formal votes are scheduled for today in
Atlanta and Tuesday in Miami.
   ALPA members in Boston, Washington and Tampa, Fla., could listen
to the Miami meeting via an audio link, but Cole was not certain
whether pilots in those cities cast votes.
   During a closed-door meeting in Miami on Sunday, some pilots
booed and stormed out after a return-to-work option was presented
by Jack Bavis, the head of Eastern's pilots union, according to
published reports. One pilot pushed a television cameraman who was
outside the meeting room.
   Cole said only a few pilots at the meeting said they have
contemplated returning to work.
   Some pilots circulated petitions suggesting that ALPA's national
leadership was not giving full support to striking Eastern pilots
and advocated a nationwide pilot work stoppage on Labor Day.
   Karen Ceremsak, a spokeswoman for the Miami-based carrier, said
a few pilots called Sunday to indicate they wanted to return to
work.
   The 20-member pilots' Master Executive Council voted in favor of
continuing the strike on Saturday following a five-day meeting in
Washington.
   ``Your MEC voted unanimously to continue the picket line,'' the
union's taped telephone message said, adding that the union
leadership repeated its commitment to long-term pilots' security.
   ``Remember how important it is to hold the line while all these
dynamic forces affecting our situation and the alternatives are
played out,'' the message said.
   Among the options to be proposed at the Tuesday ALPA meeting in
Miami are:
   _Continuing the strike and support of the buyout effort by
Chicago options trader Joseph Ritchie.
   _Negotiating a settlement with Eastern management. The Air Line
Pilots Association's chief goals in negotiations have been job
security for its 3,600 Eastern members, ensuring Eastern's survival
and unionizing pilots at Continental Airlines, Eastern's sister
carrier under Texas Air Corp. ownership.
   _Returning to work unilaterally. The pilots are on sympathy
strike, and their contract remains in effect.
   The last scenario would raise legal questions about how many
pilots Eastern would have to take back at their existing salaries,
considerably higher than those of newly hired pilots.
   Eastern, which admitted its Machinists strike contingency plans
were crippled by the pilots' surprising solidarity, has been moving
along on a rebuilding plan without its unions.
   The airline filed March 9 for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization, five days after the Machinists went on strike and
were joined by the pilots and flight attendants. Eastern has filed
a plan for its creditors that envisions an airline two-thirds' its
pre-strike size, coming out of bankruptcy by year's end.
   Eastern says it will need 1,700 pilots. By week's end, Eastern
said 380 ALPA pilots had crossed the picket line, more than 300
newly hired pilots have completed training and 700 more are in
training.
   Eastern has indicated that most of the striking pilots no longer
have jobs to come back to. The pilots union would likely challenge
that.
   From the outset, Eastern management has said it doesn't need the
striking Machinists, whose 8,500 members include mechanics, baggage
handlers and other ground services workers. But the unions, with
some backing in Congress, have chaged that consumer safety could be
compromised by Eastern's heavy reliance on newly hired pilots.

   Investor Marvin Davis has made an unsolicited and
conditional offer to acquire UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines,
company officials announced today.
   The bid, reportedly worth $200 a share or $4.32 billion, sent
UAL stock soaring in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
By late morning, UAL was up $36.50 to $201 a share.
   The board of UAL is to consider the proposal at a Wednesday
meeting, the officials said.
   ``While the board of directors has not decided whether a sale of
the company is in the best interest of the company's shareholders
and other constituencies, in keeping with its fiduciary duty, the
board will give careful consideration to Mr. Davis' proposal,''
Stephen M. Wolf, UAL chairman and president, said in a news release.
   UAL spokesman Rob Doughty refused to comment beyond Wolf's
statement and would not say what Davis offered for Chicago-based
UAL.
   However, the Wall Street Journal reported in today's editions
that Davis, a former oil wildcatter, has offered $200 a share, or a
total of about $4.32 billion for the airline.
   UAL stock has risen sharply since Los Angeles investor Alfred
Checchi made a successful $3.65 billion bid in June for NWA Inc.,
the parent of Northwest Airlines.
   UAL stock rose from $117.50 in mid-June to $190 in late July.
The movement was fueled by speculation that investors such as
Robert Bass and Davis had purchased stakes in UAL.
   However, the price of the stock has settled in recent trading,
closing at $164.50 on Friday amid reports that the U.S.
Transportation Department would no longer look kindly on leveraged
takeovers of major U.S. airlines.
   The offer from Davis comes at a time when the airline is
experiencing some troubles. In July, United had its second fatal
accident in six months when a DC-10 crash-landed in Sioux City,
Iowa, killing 111 of the 296 passengers and crew aboard.
   In February, the cargo door of a Boeing 747 blew out over the
Pacific Ocean on a flight from Honolulu to Auckland, New Zealand,
killing nine.
   United, recently surpassed by American as the nation's largest
airline, lrofit from a year earlier.
   For the quarter ended June 30, the airline reported net income
of $141 million, or $6.52 per share on revenue of $2.5 billion. The
company had revenue of $8.98 billion in 1988.

   UAL Corp. soared 36{ to 201 on reports that investor Marvin
Davis of Los Angeles was readying a $200-a-share-plus bid for the

   Otherwise, analysts said a stronger-than-expected report on
employment for July and an upswing in interest rates that began
late last week were prompting a flow of money into shares of

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Prices Climb on Follow-Through Buying After Last Week's
Lows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts said the climb was expected, and resulted from
follow-through buying that began on Friday. Beans slid to a series
of contract lows last week because of wet weather, and weren't
helped by the low volume in mid-week as many traders stayed on the
sidelines because of sweeping fraud indictments announced by the
U.S. attorney's office.
   Volume could stay on the low side this week also as traders
await two important crop estimates, the first due tomorrow from
influential private forecaster Conrad Leslie, the second expected
Thursday from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   At the open, wheat was { cent lower to \ cent higher, with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.87} a bushel; corn was 2
cents to 3{ cents higher, with September at $2.23 a bushel; oats
were 1{ cents to 2 cents higher, with September at $1.42 a bushel;
and soybeans were unchanged to 5\ cents higher, August at $5.96 a
bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures prices were mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .22 cent lower to .28 cent higher, with August
at 73.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .20
cent higher, with August at 84.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .20
cent lower to .08 cent higher, with August at 46.60 cents a pound;
.12 cent lower to 1 cent higher, with August at 26.15 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Former Senator Eagleton Criticizes Merc Reform Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Sen. Thomas Eagleton on Monday
criticized reforms recently announced by the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and asked the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to
impose more stringent measures on the Merc.
   Eagleton, a public member of the exchange's board of governors
and a member of a special committee whose work led to the reforms,
said the changes announced Aug. 3 are a positive step but do not go
nearly far enough.
   The reforms, announced just one day after 46 traders were
indicted, call for tougher rules and penalties and increased
surveillance of the trading floor. One official said they are
designed ``to put the fear of God into the membership.''
   He said the public outcry system of ``grunts, groans and
gestures'' permits only limited accountability and limited ability
to trace transactions.
   Eagleton also called for more clout for floor inspectors and an
even tighter audit trail.
   ``The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has to awake from its
long slumber and realize that the people's multi-billion-dollar
business in Chicago has to be vigorously supervised by the people's
regulatory agency,'' the Missouri Democrat said.
   Leo Melamed, chairman of the Merc's executive committee, said
the reforms were first discussed in January by Merc officials who
appointed a blue-ribbon panel, including Eagleton, to review
procedures on the floor in response to public disclosure of a
2{-year undercover federal investigation at the Merc and the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   The Board of Trade announced similar measures late Wednesday,
within hours of the indictment.
   The most significant rule change approved by the Merc's Board of
Governors, however, requires membership approval.
   It would severely limit dual trading, in which a trader is
allowed to trade his own account as well as customers' accounts _ a
practice that appears to have made possible many of the frauds
alleged in the indictment.

   The dollar edged higher against most key
currencies in thin trading Monday, extending last week's rally,
which stemmed from speculation that interest rates aren't likely to
decline soon.
   Gold prices slipped. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
bullion for current delivery fell to $365.90 a troy ounce from
$367.25 Friday. Republic National Bank of New York said the late
bid for gold was $365.20 an ounce, off $2.30.
   Currency traders said the dollar continued to be buoyed by
Friday's better-than-expected employment figures, which showed
nonfarm payrolls rose by 169,000 in July. The jobless rate for last
month also fell to 5.2 percent from 5.3 percent in June.
   The news dampened expectations that the Federal Reserve would
further lower interest rates since it shows that the economy is
still growing, traders said.
   ``The Friday number was a watershed event in terms of short- and
intermediate-term thinking toward the dollar,'' said J. Thomas
Stanley, a vice president at Chemical New York Capital Markets
Group.
   Higher interest rates are seen as bullish for the dollar because
they make dollar-denominated securities, such as stocks and bonds,
more attractive to foreigners, thereby increasing the need to
convert their currencies into dollars.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed at 139.78 Japanese yen, up from 138.05.
The dollar closed lower in London at 139.47 yen, and higher in New
York at 140.05 yen, up from 139.85.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6075, cheaper for buyers
than Friday's $1.6150. Sterling fetched $1.5980 in New York, down
from $1.6060.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.9160 West German marks, up from 1.9070; 1.6475
Swiss francs, up from 1.6435; 1.17355 Canadian dollars, down from
1.17825; 6.4830 French francs, up from 6.4555; and 1,377.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,370.50.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday: 1.9055 West
German marks, up from 1.8975; 1.6380 Swiss francs, up from 1.6353;
6.4470 French francs, up from 6.4260; 2.1502 Dutch guilders, up
from 2.1300; 1.1745 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1775; and
1,373.50 Italian lire, up from 1,366.00.
   The late bid for gold was $365.75 an ounce in London, down from
$370.75 Friday. Gold fell in Zurich to $365.40 an ounce from
$370.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $367.65 an ounce, down
from $371.95.
   Silver prices also lost ground. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery slipped to $5.128 a troy ounce from
$5.168 Friday. Silver settled at $5.18 an ounce in London, down
from $5.23.

<HEAD>Agriculture Secretary Says Farmers Can Compete If Trade Barriers
Reduced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress faces a ``long, hard, bruising battle''
over the 1990 farm bill but could have the job done by next summer,
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Monday.
   Yeutter also said the United States will continue to push for
elimination of the barriers to fair agricultural trade around the
world.
   In a speech to the U.S. Feed Grains Council, Yeutter said he
expects ``heavy debate'' on new federal farm legislation in
February and March, as Congress tries to approve a farm bill before
the 1990 elections.
   Yeutter said he disagrees with those who want the United States
to limit farm production and sell less grain overseas. He said
there will be 6.2 billion people in the world by the year 2000.
   ``Somebody is going to feed those folks,'' said Yeutter. ``I
hope that somebody will include U.S. feed grain producers.'
   He also said he opposes international agreements in which
exporting countries try to divide up markets and regulate prices.
   ``I'd rather compete than negotiate market shares,'' he said.
   Yeutter said U.S. officials attending the next round of
international trade negotiations will work for reform of policies
that limit imports, subsidize exports and create high internal
price supports for farmers.
   Such practices distort free trade, he said.
   The European Community, for example, has reduced its imports of
coarse grains from 20 million metric tons a year to 4 million tons
a year in 10 years, while its exports of grain have increased from
5 million to 12 million tons, said Yeutter.
   ``That's an enormous turn-around thanks to these export
subsidies,'' he said. ``Let's phase out all the distortions ... and
let farmers compete.''
   One approach, said Yeutter, would be to persuade nations to
replace all import constraints _ quotas, for example _ with
tariffs, then work to gradually reduce them.
   Until trade reform is accomplished, however, Yeutter said the
United States will need to provide export subsidies to compete with
other producers like the European Community.
   Yeutter also said U.S. farmers will have to be more competitive
so that they can take advantage of foreign sales opportunities when
trade barriers are removed.
   ``We better be ready to get them when the markets exist,'' said
Yeutter.
   During the meeting, Yeutter also announced that the United
States and the Soviet Union will begin negotiations in December for
a new, long-term grain agreement.
   The current agreement provides that the Soviets will buy at
least 4 million metric tons each of U.S. wheat and corn annually,
and make additional purchases of at least 1 million tons of wheat,
corn, soybeans or soybean meal.
   It also allows the Soviets to buy up to 3 million metric tons of
additional wheat and corn without additional consultations.
   The U.S. Feed Grains Council, a private organization of farm and
agribusiness groups, was formed in 1960 to promote export markets
for U.S. corn, barley and sorghum.
   About 300 people are expected to attend the annual meeting,
which concludes Wednesday.

   The stock market rolled up a strong advance
Monday, extending its post-crash rally to new heights in buying

readying a $200-a-share-plus bid for the company.
   UAL confirmed that it had received what it called a highly

   The news prompted buying of other airline stocks. Delta Air

   The annual video convention stands alone as the
only place where Charlton Heston, near-naked adult-movie stars,
former Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin, child-slasher Freddy Krueger
and ``Wizard of Oz'' munchkins can coexist in one room.
   So prosperous is the home video business _ sales are estimated
at $10 billion this year _ that there's room for everybody at the
eighth annual Video Software Dealers Association convention, which
formally opened Monday.
   ``We think there's a great future,'' said Ron Castell, senior
vice president of Blockbuster Video, the nation's largest video
chain with more than 820 stores.
   ``This is not a hard business. All you do is rent movies.
Americans love movies,'' he said. ``And they have an insatiable
demand.''
   The demand is so profound, in fact, that a record 14,000 video
retailers, distributors, producers and tape manufacturers have come
to the show to check out everything from ``Who Framed Roger
Rabbit'' to ``Balloonacy,'' a how-to video complete with 50
balloons and tips to create more than 30 inflated animals.
   Although offbeat titles account for only a small percentage of
video sales, they do give the show its distinctive flavor.
   Lindsay Wagner hosts ``Psychocalisthenics,'' a holistic approach
to fitness that combines yoga, meditation and calisthenics. And
just when you thought it was safe to go back in the tent comes
``Memorial Valley Massacre,'' featuring a Cro-Magnon man with a bad
ax and a worse attitude.
   And don't overlook ``Play the Piano Overnight'' and
``Infantastic Lullabyes on Video,'' which ``opens new ways for
sharing quality time with baby.''
   ``We've been selling B titles for four years, and we haven't hit
any slowdown at all,'' said Doug Coleman, vice president of sales
and marketing for Mercury Films, distributors of ``Slave Girls From
Beyond Infinity'' and ``Assault of the Killer Bimbos,'' among other
features.
   When it comes to more conventional titles, the video industry is
confident that this summer's record-setting box office will spill
over into the fall, generating prolific holiday sales.
   In addition to ``Roger Rabbit,'' this Christmas'
most-anticipated titles include ``Bambi,'' ``The Land Before
Time,'' ``Rain Man,'' ``The Wizard of Oz'' and the just-announced
release of ``Ghostbusters II.''
   Warner Bros. has yet to say if its megahit ``Batman'' will be
released on video for this year's holiday buyers. But the studio
has sparked curiosity by parking the film's Batmobile at the Warner
Bros. booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center.
   Displays cover 210,000 square feet at this year's show, up from
173,300 last year and a testament to the medium's health. More than
400 video companies, from conglomerates to mom and pop operations,
are staffing exhibits on the floor, a rise from 1988's 373 booths.
   At the same time, though, the video industry is confronting a
number of potentially damaging developments.
   ``Rushing into the '90s brings us to a critical crossroads,''
said Andy Lasky, the convention's chairman.
   Video executives are concerned that a number of pending bills
aimed at containing violent programming will keep video retailers
from renting movies that children might be able to see on
television or in PG-13 rated motion pictures in theaters.
   There is also growing concern among video renters that tape
quality has deteriorated, conventioneers say. Who's to blame,
though, is unclear: It could be ``field-inflicted damage'' caused
by dirty VCRs and careless customers or it could be cost-cutting
manufacturing and duplication techniques that make tapes fall apart
after only several viewings.
   Shoplifting has become a concern, too, and convention-goers
investigated new security systems aimed at stopping theft. And
retailers are fighting to maintain rights to rent Nintendo video
games, a practice which Nintendo says hurts sales and should be
stopped.

<HEAD>Dallas Newspaper War Returns To Court In Comic Squabble</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dallas Times Herald filed suit Monday against
the owner of its crosstown rival, The Dallas Morning News, as one
of the nation's fiercest newspaper wars returned to court after a
yearlong absence.
   In a lawsuit filed in Houston, the smaller Times Herald asked a
Texas judge to prevent Morning News owner A.H. Belo Corp. from
acquiring exclusive Dallas-area rights to 26 comics, columns and
other features it currently publishes.
   The lawsuit claims Belo and Universal Press Syndicate will
``inexorably harm competition in the Dallas market'' if the rights
are granted.
   The Times Herald chose Houston seeking neutrality, President
L.L. ``Ike'' Massey said.
   Belo announced last week it had formed a joint venture with
Universal Press Syndicate to explore television programming
possibilities for some of the syndicate's features, which include
such comic strips as Doonesbury and The Far Side, advice column
Dear Abby, and columnists Erma Bombeck and James J. Kilpatrick.
   As part of that agreement, Belo _ which also owns Dallas' top
television station _ acquired the exclusive rights to the
syndicate's features in the market.
   ``The Belo company is attempting to unfairly increase its
influence in the Dallas market, where it already operates the
larger newspaper, the leading television station and seven
community newspapers,'' Massey said in a prepared statement. ``Now
it wants to manipulate a newspaper syndicate against us.''
   Besides blocking the transfer, the Times Herald is seeking
actual and punitive damages.
   Last week Belo President James P. Sheehan said the exclusivity
agreement ``really is secondary'' to the joint venture. However, he
said ``it wouldn't be appropriate for us to develop one of the
features to be running in a competitor's newspaper in our market.''
   Sheehan said Monday, ``We believe that their lawsuit is without
merit and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously.''
   Just last year, the two newspapers settled a dispute over
circulation figures as each dropped a lawsuit against the other in
an argument begun by the Times Herald.

   A conservative critic of Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady's plan for cutting Third World debt said on
Monday that Mexico needs to privatize more of its industry and cut
the number of bureaucrats so that Mexicans will be encouraged to
bring home the billions they have sent to the United States and
other safe havens.
   He said that Mexico has more government employees than the
United States, which has three times Mexico's population.
   ``We haven't heard anything about debt-equity swaps _ cancelling
foreign debt in return for shares in Mexican industry,'' said
Edward L. Hudgins, director of the Center for International
Economic Growth. The center is part of the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative private study group.
   ``It's not inflationary as Mexican officials say. Some of those
shares are owned by the government. They can be turned over in
return for debt.''
   Earlier Monday Brady said that last month's agreement between
the Mexican government and creditor banks to reduce $54 billion
worth of Mexico's foreign debt has brought the country so much
investment from abroad that a $2 billion ``bridge loan'' he had
promised may be less necessary. Brady spoke at a news conference in
Mexico City.
   The Mexican agreement has aroused criticism as well as praise in
recent days.
   Sir Kit McMahon, chairman of Britain's Midland Bank, called it
ill-conceived and destabilizing, encouraging debtor countries to
slow down repayments. Netherlands Finance Minister H. Onno Ruding,
head of the International Monetary Fund's powerful Interim
Committee, said he would not ask his taxpayers to finance payments
to American banks.
   William R. Cline, a senior fellow at the Institute for
International Economics, reported that an estimated $2.5 billion
had been brought back to Mexico since the agreement. Some estimates
put the total of ``capital flight'' from Mexico as high as $80
billion. Mexico's foreign debt is calculated by the World Bank at
more than $107 billion.
   Cline agreed with Brady that the agreement had improved public
confidence so much in Mexico that domestic interest rates had come
down enough to save the Mexican government $10 billion a year.
Cline estimated that it will save Mexico another $1 billion to $1.5
billion a year of the interest it has been paying on foreign debt.
   The institute is a private research body with international
funding.
   Though he saw the plan as a good start, Cline said that about
$34 billion pledged to support it by the fund, the World Bank and
Japan would not be enough _ that at least $50 billion will be
needed.
   Third World debt is estimated at $1.3 trillion.

   Ames Department Stores Inc. on Monday
sold its G.C. Murphy Co. and Bargain World variety stores to E-II
Holdings Inc. of York, Pa., parent company of McCrory Corp., for
$80 million.
   G.C. Murphy, of McKeesport, Pa., near Pittsburgh, operates 130
variety stores and 25 Bargain World stores in 13 states.
   The stores had a combined revenue of $175 million in the year
ended Jan. 28 and employ about 3,500 people, mostly in
Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland and Virginia, according
to Ames spokesman Bill Roberts.
   Ames purchased G.C. Murphy, then with 383 stores, in 1985 for
about $196.5 million.
   Since the purchase, Ames has closed 128 G.C. Murphy and Murphy
Mart stores in 19 states and converted many Murphy Mart stores to
Ames outlets.
   E-II Holdings is a subsidiary of Riklis Family Corp. and
operates about 1,300 variety stores through McCrory Corp.,
officials said.
   Ames said its purchase of the Zayre chain of 388 department
stores last year doubled its size and made its Murphy stores a
small part of its operation.
   Ames said it will use the proceeds of the sale to reduce the
long-term bank debt incurred in the purchase of Zayre.
   The McCrory chain, with about 1,300 outlets the nation's largest
variety store chain, also includes Newberry, TG&amp;Y, H.L. Green,
McLellan and Kress stores.
   Fisher said the newly acquired stores will retain their current
names. He said no layoffs are planned.
   G.C. Murphy's headquarters and distribution center in McKeesport
will remain with Ames, according to Ewing.

   The changes, effective Sept. 11, were described as being part of
the periodic editorial transition at the magazines and as unrelated
to Time's recent acquisition of a controlling interest in Warner

<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. on Monday
accused its biggest competitor, MCI Corp., of offering large
business customers illegally low prices to win their long-distance
telephone business.
   AT&amp;T officials said they hope the complaint will lead to a
reversal of a Federal Communications Commission policy that exempts
AT&amp;T competitors from having to file tariffs with the FCC detailing
rates and other terms they offer customers.
   In its complaint to the FCC, AT&amp;T alleged that MCI has used
unlawful discriminatory discounts the past two years to win
contracts with the Pentagon, Merrill Lynch; Westin, Hilton and
Vista hotels; United Airlines, the University of Colorado and
Uniguard Security Insurance Co.
   ``The commission's regulatory reforms have not kept pace with
the fierce growth of interexchange competition,'' Francine J.
Perry, AT&amp;T's vice president for legal affairs, said in a letter to
the FCC accompanying the complaint.
   To promote competition in long-distance and data transmission
services with the then-impending breakup of the Bell System, the
FCC in 1983 granted ``forbearance'' to non-dominant carriers on
filing rate tariffs with the commission.
   AT&amp;T said it viewed that decision as a ``transitional, interim
step'' that would lead to ``eliminating ... unnecessary regulatory
restraints'' _ such as disclosing its rate offerings to business
customers _ for all long-distance carriers, including itself.
   Because AT&amp;T alone has to file tariffs with the FCC, ``MCI and
other competitors have gained unwarranted advantages in the
marketplace by selectively providing services on an off-tariff
basis,'' Berry said.
   MCI, which filed a similar complaint against AT&amp;T last year
after AT&amp;T won a contract for Holiday Inns' long-distance and
reservation system, called Monday's complaint a ``smokescreen.''
   ``AT&amp;T is merely trying to achieve its own deregulation through
the complaint process,'' said Pam Small, an MCI spokeswoman.
``They're essentially challenging the rules.''
   Ms. Small said MCI maintains that AT&amp;T should still be required
to detail its rates through tariff filings with the FCC because, as
the dominant carrier, it still holds 80 percent of the
long-distance and interstate data transmission market.
   Herb Linnen, spokesman for AT&amp;T, said FCC figures show the
company holds about 68 percent of the market, far less than the
almost-total control it once held.
   Generally, in telecomunications or other regulated industries,
companies must adhere to tariffs filed with regulators.

<HEAD>Judge Denies Injunction Against Dunkin' Donuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Delaware judge refused Monday to stop Dunkin'
Donuts Inc. from taking anti-takeover measures that put about 28
percent of the company's stock in friendly hands.
   Vice Chancellor William Chandler of Delaware Chancery Court
denied a request by a Canadian partnership for a preliminary
injunction against the doughnut company's $35 million employee
stock ownership plan and its $28 million sale of preferred stock to
General Electric Capital Corp.
   The Canadian partners, Unicorp Canada Corp.'s Kingsbridge
Capital Group and Cara Operations Limited, launched a $305 million
hostile tender for Dunkin' Donuts in June.
   The doughnut chain, based in Randolph, has franchised more than
1,700 doughnut shops worldwide. It reported a profit of $13.5
million on sales of $112.8 million last year.
   Kingsbridge and Cara argued in the lawsuit that Dunkin' Donuts
enacted the ESOP and sold the preferred stock to GE Capital to
frustrate a takeover under Delaware's business combination statute,
which effectively requires a hostile bidder to obtain 85 percent of
the target firm's outstanding common stock.
   The ESOP holds about 16 percent of Dunkin Donuts' outstanding
common shares, and GE Capital's preferred stock is convertible to
700,000 common shares, or roughly an 11 percent stake in the
company.
   Since top executives and directors also hold about 15 percent of
the shares, more than 40 percent of Dunkin' Donuts is considered by
securities analysts to be in friendly hands.
   Dunkin' Donuts attorney John D. Donovan Jr. said the judge
accepted the doughnut maker's contention that the ESOP and GE
Capital had caused ``no immediate and irreparable harm'' to the
Canadians.
   ``We argued that if the ESOP and GE Capital don't want to tender
their shares, it's because the bid is at a bargain basement price,
not because they don't have a right to do so,'' Donovan said.
   Gil Sparks, attorney for the Canadian partnership, was on
vacation Monday and could not be reached, according to a
receptionist at his office in Wilmington, Del. There was no answer
after business hours at Kingsbridge's Toronto headquarters, and
Kingsbridge spokesman Eric W. Evans did not return messages left at
his home.

<TEXT>
   First Interstate Bancorp said Monday it would
sell its Commercial Alliance Corp. subsidiary, one of the largest
U.S. providers of capital equipment financing, to a Japanese
leasing giant for $190 million.
   The sale to Tokyo-based Orix Corp., Japan's largest leasing
company, is expected to close by the end of September. Closing
conditions include approval by the Japanese Ministry of Finance,
the company said in announcing the definitive agreement.
   The sale is part of a nearly 2-year-old restructuring at First
Interstate that has included layoffs, other cost-cutting measures
and the sale of many non-core businesses as the company
concentrates on consumer and business banking.
   First Interstate, a vast banking enterprise with offices in 21
states and the District of Columbia, began the restructuring due
largely to losses at its Texas unit.
   Joseph J. Pinola, chairman and chief executive officer, has been
upbeat about company prospects in recent months after a string of
positive earnings reports, and share prices have risen.
   First Interstate said it agreed to provide some interim funding
for Commercial Alliance, a worldwide operation that has 23 offices
throughout the United States.
   As of June 30, Commercial Alliance had had total assets of $1.9
billion. Net income for the 12 months ended June 30 was $14.8
million.

   Food Barn Inc. has sued Safeway Stores
Inc. for breach of contract and misrepresentation in connection
with Food Barn's purchase last year of about 65 Kansas City-area
supermarkets.
   Food Barn seeks $14.3 million in a lawsuit filed Friday in
Jackson County Circuit Court.
   The company contends it paid $143 million for the stores on Feb.
8, 1988, based on false financial data supplied by Safeway.
   Food Barn alleges that Safeway overstated various assets, did
not mention certain liabilities and broke its contract by refusing
to refund $14.3 million in extra charges for the stores.
   Safeway, based in Oakland, Calif., was taken private in a 1986
leveraged buyout financed partly through the sale of some Safeway
divisions. A call to the supermarket chain's headquarters after
business hours Monday was not answered.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration on Monday
canceled a $79 million contract with Hazeltine Corp. to bring a new
generation of landing systems to the nation's airports.
   The FAA said in a statement that production delays have put the
program three years behind schedule, but the agency remains
committed to using the new microwave landing systems at major U.S.
airports in 1998 and at all airports around the year 2000.
   Hazeltine has delivered two of the 178 landing systems called
for in the contract since beginning work in 1984. One has been
installed at the Lebanon, N.H., airport.
   The agency said it would buy 26 systems from other sources, test
that equipment and a decision on how to move ahead ``will depend
upon successful completion of the evaluation program.'' The FAA
said it plans to award a new contract in 1991.
   A spokesman for Hazeltine's parent company, Emerson Electric
Corp., said the company plans to file suit contesting the decision.
The spokesman said problems, including payments and timing of
deliveries, were the result of changes the FAA made in the contract
after it was awarded.
   ``The contract changes required by the FAA over several years
are so numerous and substantial that they have fundementally
altered the nature and the cost of the contract,'' said the
spokesman, who asked that his name not be used.
   The system uses high-frequency microwaves to direct planes to
landings, allowing them to make curved and steeper approaches
outside the strict paths necessary under the current instrument
landing system. Virtually immune to weather, the system can
increase an airport's flight capacity and helps planes avoid
residential areas.
   Air carriers have been reluctant to support the microwave
system, saying it isn't much better than the current system.
   The FAA in June warned that Hazeltine's contract was in danger
of being canceled because of production problems. Hazeltine had
said the price of the contract was too low and ``entered an
unauthorized work slowdown last August,'' Dick Arnold, head of the
FAA's microwave landing system program, said in June.
   The company was given a delay in a decision on the contract in
July to see if it could find another firm to it over, but no such
contractor was found, according to the FAA.
   The agency had been planning on putting new microwave systems at
the Laconia and Manchester airports in New Hampshire, but FAA
spokesman John Leyden has said that because of the delays it may
put early systems at high-profile, high-volume airports such as
John F. Kennedy International in New York.
   The FAA plans to buy 750 of the new systems, if Congress
approves.

<HEAD>Two Las Vegas Newspapers File Joint Operating Agreement</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to CLARIFY that Sun is a morning paper now, but
will become an afternoon paper under terms of the JOA. Also moved on general
news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two longtime newspaper rivals, the Las
Vegas Review-Journal and the Las Vegas Sun, announced plans Monday
to merge their business, circulation and production operations in a
joint operating agreement.
   The venture must be approved by the U.S. Attorney General's
office. If accepted, Las Vegas will become the 20th city in the
country to have newspapers participating in a JOA.
   No change of ownership is involved and the agreement calls for
both newspapers to maintain independent and separate newsrooms, as
well as separate weekday editions. Under the terms of the JOA, the
Review-Journal would remain a morning paper and the Sun would
change from morning to afternoon publication.
   Combined morning editions, labeled the Las Vegas
Review-Journal@Sun, would be published on Saturdays, Sundays and
holidays.
   The Sun would receive 10 percent of the operating profits of the
two newspapers and the Review-Journal would receive 90 percent,
based on the R-J's stronger financial position, according to the
JOA agreement.
   The agreement makes financial sense for the Review-Journal and
is the last hope of the Sun to continue providing Las Vegas ``with
an outspoken, frequently divergent editorial voice,'' said the text
of the agreement.
   ``Without this move we believe the Sun is in probable danger of
financial failure,'' Sun President Brian Greenspun said in a
statement Monday. ``With this move, there will be no displacement
of Sun newsroom personnel and there will be the continuation of an
important newspaper.''
   The Review-Journal is the state's largest newspaper and is the
flagship for Donrey Media Group, which owns 59 U.S. daily
newspapers. The Sun is Nevada's third-largest newspaper.
   As of last year, the Review-Journal had a circulation of 121,321
daily and 142,923 on Sunday. The Sun had a circulation of 50,515
daily and 54,669 on Sunday.
   The plan would link the business and production functions of the
two newspapers for an initial period of 50 years.
   Under the agreement, the Sun will give Donrey Media Group 10
percent of the outstanding stock in Community Cable TV and an
option to purchase an additional 35 percent of the stock at a later
date.
   The value of 10 percent of Community Cable TV is estimated at
about $20 million.
   The agreement to enter into the JOA was signed June 12 and is to
be filed with the Justice Department Tuesday. Approval of such
agreements can take anywhere from a few months to several years.
   The Review-Journal@Sun filing asked that the agreement be
approved quickly and without a hearing because of the weak position
of the Sun in the marketplace.
   The document said the Sun is losing about $3 million a year on
annual revenues of $21 million. The newspaper last made a profit in
1981, earning $183,148.
   The Sun's total debt now exceeds $10.7 million, the application
said.
   The Greenspun family has borrowed money from banks and
family-affiliated businesses to keep the newspaper going, the
document said. Hank Greenspun, founder of the Sun, died July 22.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar slipped against the Japanese yen
Tuesday morning, while share prices rebounded slightly on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.
   The dollar opened at 139.55 yen and moved in a range of 139.10
to 139.65 yen. It stood at 139.23 yen, down 0.55 yen from Monday's
139.78-yen close, at midday.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 19.54
points, or 0.06 percent, to close the morning session at 34,649.92.
The index had lost 111.61 points the previous day.
   The dollar's bearishness in the Tokyo market followed its slight
loss in New York overnight mainly due to profit-taking by
speculative investors, traders said.
   ``The market was relatively quiet all morning,'' said a dealer
at the Bank of Japan, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Another trader at Chemical Bank's Tokyo office, Minori Takeuchi,
said, ``In the absence of fresh market-affecting news, early
dealings in Tokyo have been very technical.''
   Traders said the dollar has been weak due to prospects that U.S.
interest rates are unlikely to decline further, judging from the
lower-than-expected U.S. jobless rate in July that indicated
moderate economic growth is continuing.
   On Friday, Washington reported that the U.S. unemployment rate
for July fell by 0.1 percentage point to 5.2 percent.
   Securities dealers said trading was light because many investors
are on summer vacation.
