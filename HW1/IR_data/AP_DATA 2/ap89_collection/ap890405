   Senators came to bury Bullfrog County
not to praise it. They voted to remove from the books the desert
jurisdiction where no one lives and where the federal government
wants to dump nuclear waste.
   ``Not that I loved Bullfrog less, but that I loved Nevada
more,'' state Sen. Thomas Hickey said Tuesday, in a parody of
Shakespeare's speech that Marc Antony delivered after Julius Caesar
was slain by his closest confidant.
   Hickey was a key Senate sponsor of the 1987 bill that created
the 144-square-mile county with no roads and a government seat in
Carson City, 270 miles to the north. Residents included snakes,
lizards, coyotes and kangaroos rats but no humans.
   Bullfrog County was formed to encompass Yucca Mountain, the only
area in the nation the federal Department of Energy is studying as
the possible site for a high-level nuclear waste repository.
   The intent was to collect millions of dollars from the federal
government through a property tax rate of $5 per $100 of assessed
valuation, the highest allowed under the Nevada Constitution.
   A retired state Supreme Court justice ruled last year that
Bullfrog County was unconstitutional on more than two dozen
grounds, including the lack of a representative government because
no people lived at the desert site.
   Although Hickey mourned the county's death, starting his eulogy
with ``Oh, mighty Bullfrog,'' Senate Majority Leader Bill Raggio
led a group who said the county should stay on Nevada's law books
as a civics lesson.
   Raggio warned in the waning hours of the 1987 session that
Bullfrog County would falter in the courts. He said Tuesday that
historians should be reminded of the state's attempt to create
special legislation to squeeze money out of the federal government
and into state coffers.
   ``I don't think we should let this go without learning a
lesson,'' Raggio said.
   Raggio was one of the dissenters in Tuesday's 15-5 vote that
sent the measure to erase the Bullfrog proposal from the books to
the Assembly for further consideration.
   Hickey said a bill would likely be introduced in the Senate to
establish a special emergency district around Yucca Mountain so
local governments could collect grants instead of taxes for the
proposed dump project, as allowed by federal law.
   Nye County, from which Bullfrog was carved, filed the lawsuit
that sought to have Bullfrog County declared unconstitutional.
   Under current plans, the dump would house waste from nuclear
reactors for 10,000 years and would open early in the next century
if the Energy Department determines Yucca Mountain is stable enough.
   Gov. Bob Miller and most other state officials strongly oppose
locating the dump in the state, saying Yucca Mountain has a history
of volcanic and seismic activity.

<UNK>Captain Of Toxic Waste Ship Gets Suspended Sentence</UNK>
<DATELINE>GENOA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a case that caused a national uproar, a
court has given a two-month suspended sentence to the captain of a
Syrian ship whose toxic cargo originated in Italy and was rejected
on two continents.
   The Genoa court handed down the sentence Tuesday after
convicting the captain of the Zanoobia, Ahmed Tabalo of Syria, of
traveling without the proper permit.
   Tabalo said he took command of the ship after the 12,000 barrels
of toxic waste had been loaded and said he believed its manifest
was accurate in listing the goods as normal chemical products, the
Italian news agency ANSA reported.
   The vessel, dubbed the ``ship of poison'' by the Italian media,
docked in Genoa in northern Italy in May after crew members
reported being sickened by fumes from the cargo. The barrels were
examined and the ship was subsequently seized by Italian
authorities.
   The cargo's odyssey began in February 1987 when it left the
Italian port of Carrara on a Maltese freighter for Djibouti
carrying waste from Italian companies.
   Authorities in the African country refused the cargo and the
ship later unloaded it in Puerto Cabello, Venezuela.
   But the cargo began to leak and Venezuelan officials ordered it
out of the country. It was put on a Cypriot freighter, which was
refused entry by several ports until it reached Syria.
   Eventually the Syrians had the cargo reloaded onto the Zanoobia
and the ship went to Italy.
   The Zanoobia was one of three vessels that returned to Italy
bearing a total of 2,200 tons of unidentified waste from Italian
chemical companies that had been rejected in foreign ports.
   The return of the three ships at about the same time prompted
fear in many cities that they would be used as dumping grounds for
the refuse.

<HEAD>Protesting Nuns Enter Sixth Month Locked In Monastery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Carmelite nuns today entered
their sixth month barricaded in the infirmary of their monastery,
pledging to remain there until the Vatican's highest court hears
their appeal.
   The nuns began their protest Oct. 4, saying they were afraid of
being evicted because of their opposition to the liberalization of
the traditionally contemplative order through the introduction of
such things as candy and television.
   The Vatican court, the Apostolic Signatura, should consider the
appeal soon, said Tim Manning, spokesman for the Roman Catholic
Diocese of Paterson. The nuns would be allowed to remain in the
infirmary until the court rules, he said.
   He declined to say what action the diocese would take if the
court ruled against the nuns.
   The nuns have no plans to leave, said a close associate.
   ``They're not thinking of giving up because there's still that
appeal to be heard,'' said Betty Sutton, a spokeswoman for the nuns.
   The protest at the monastery of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of
Mount Carmel initially involved five of its 13 nuns.
   Last month, the Vatican said two of the nuns whose temporary
vows had expired were no longer Carmelites and should leave. Two
other nuns were told to find other monasteries, and the oldest,
72-year-old Mother Philomena, was allowed to stay.
   Although the five initially ignored the order, one former nun,
Nicole Prescott, later left the monastery citing health reasons.

   The peace proposals Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir was expected to outline for President Bush focus on
elections in the occupied territories to choose Palestinians who
would negotiate with Israel on limited self-government.
   Many prominent Palestinians welcome the idea of balloting but
argue that free elections cannot be held as long as Israeli troops
occupy the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   In interviews and through his aides, Shamir said he was willing
to have Palestinians choose mayors to speak for major population
centers or political figures to represent the whole region.
   The elected Palestinians would then meet with Israeli
negotiators to work out a temporary solution for the 1 million
residents of the West Bank and the 650,000 inhabitants of the Gaza
Strip.
   The most Palestinians could expect from this process would be
limited self-rule with Israeli troops still stationed in the
occupied lands. But Shamir has said troops could be pulled out of
population centers once an autonomy scheme was agreed upon.
   Under Shamir's proposals, the final status of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip would be the subject of further negotiations after
autonomy was implemented.
   Shamir's advisers also hint he is ready to release some
Palestinian prisoners and take other steps to reduce tension.
However, they link any change to a truce in the Palestinian
uprising _ intefadeh in Arabic _ in which 419 Palestinians and 18
Israelis have died since December 1987.
   ``The condition is that life in Judea and Samaria (West Bank)
must return to normal. The intefadeh must end,'' said Yossi
Ahimeir, a Shamir spokesman. The Shamir ideas closely parallel the
1978 U.S.-mediated Camp Davidgned by Egypt and Israel
but rejected by the Palestinians and Jordan. The major difference
is that Shamir proposes electing nefore autonomy is
implemented instead of members of an autonomous council after
self-government is defined in t ``I believe that this will be the one big
and important
contribution that Mr. Shamir is bringing to Washington,'' said an
Israeli official who described the proposal as a ``major change''
in the government's position.
   Shamir, however, rules out direct or indirect talks with the
PLO, which meanted representatis
intermediaries.
   He gives Palestinians little hope of seeing an end to occupation
because he has rejected Palestinian demands for statehood and
refused to endorse the idea of returning any captured land to Arab
sovereignty.
   In this, the right-wing prime minister takes a harder line than
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Finance Minister Shimon Peres,
the leaders of the left-of-center Labor Party which shares power in
the coalition government.
   Labor supports returning some of the captured land in exce
for peace agreements.
   Municipal electionld twice in the West Bank since
Israel captured the land from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War.
In the last balloting in 197 mayors _ nearly all
of them supporters of the PLO.
   Only six remain in office with most ofted or deposed by Israel for
nationalist activities.
   In theaza Strip, elections were last held in 1946, under
Egyptian rule.
   The main flaw in Shamir' unable to
find Palestinians willing to go along with the elections proposal.
But some Palestinians have met secretly with the prime minister or
openly with ilitary officials to discuss the
   Saeb Erakat, a political sthe An Najah
University in the West Bank city of Nablus, said that if, as the
PLO has proposed, Israeli troops withdraw and turn over the
occupied territory to U.N. peacekee``then we will consider
elections.''
   He said electing city officials would be meaningless if
occupation prsisted.
   ``Will elected mayors be able to prevent arrests, e
deportation of Palestinian leaders, halt the confiscation of sure of schools?
We would just wind up electing people
who have the authority to collect the garbage,'' said Erer the uprising
against Israeli occupation began, a
group of prominent Palestinians in Jerusalem in January 198ted a 14-point
list of demands that included a call for
elections.
   The idea was hotly debated among Palest until Bethlehem
Mayor Elias Frfire in the intefadeh, or
uprising, in exchange for elections and the release of thousands of
Palestinian pris  PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat responded by threatening to
shoot
anyone who propoed a truce and graffiti appeared on Bethlehem
walls threateninge. Support for the idea rapidly 
   Hanna Siniora, editor of tily Al Fajr and a
proponent of the 14-point list, said there was deep suspiciont
Shamir was meeting with Palesand talking about elections in
fort to perpetuate ``the illusion that there are alternatives
to the PLO.''
   ``So far, what we see from Shas an attempt to repackage
what efused earlier, autonomy under Camp David,'' said
Siniora, a leading moderate.

<HEAD>Scandal-Ridden Firm Reportedly Gave Takeshita More Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, whose
administration is under fire in a major bribery scandal, received
$228,000 from the firm at the center of the scandal through ticket
sales for a fund-raising party, news reports said Wednesday.
   An aide to Takeshita, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed that Recruit Co., the information services firm at the
heart of the scandal, had bought tickets to the fund-raising party
in May 1987, but said ``our office did not directly handle the
party, so we do not know the amount.''
   Takeshita refused comment on the reports.
   The news followed the Takeshita's disclosure on Friday that
Recruit spent $152,000 on another of Takeshita's fund-raising
parties in May 1987. At the time, Takeshita was secretary general
of the governing Liberal Democratic Party and the leading contender
to the premiership.
   Reports by the major daily Asahi Shimbun and other local media
Wednesday said Takeshita had received a total of at least $380,000
from Recruit.
   Japanese politicians customarily use fund-raising parties to
sidestep legal restrictions on political donations and solicit
funds from business leaders and other politicians and supporters.
   Large corporations often buy large blocks of party tickets, but
Recruit's ticket purchases were unusually large. Takeshita
aknowledged last week that the $152,000 worth of tickets Recruit
bought for his party was ``slightly exessive'' for one company.
   There is no legal limit on the amount of money politicians can
raise from such parties without violating the Political Donations
Restrictions Law. The parties are considered legal ``as long as the
price of each ticket is within the range of common sense and the
number of tickets purchased is within a reasonable limit of what a
company can possibly use,'' an official at the Home Affairs
Ministry said on condition of anonymity.
   Recruit spent an estimated $685,000 on tickets for fund-raising
parties for 14 politicians from 1986-1988, of which $380,000
reportedly went to Takeshita.
   Executives of the firm, under investigation for suspected
bribery, sold about 500,000 shares in its real estate subsidiary,
Recruit Cosmos Co., to 159 influential people at cut-rate prices
before the company's stocks began over-counter trading. Recruit
Cosmos' share price shot up after public trading began and buyers
netted handsome profits.
   Opposition parties have demanded that Takeshita resign to take
responsibility for his administration's links to Recruit.
   ``Without intent to ask for specific favors, why should Recruit
give so much money to Takeshita?'' said Shun Ohide, secretary
general of the Japan Socialist Party, the largest opposition body.
   On Tuesday night, Socialist Party chairwoman Takako Doi proposed
a coalition government to replace Takeshita's Cabinet.
   ``The Takeshita Cabinet is no longer entitled to run the
government,'' she told reporters. ``The only alternative left for
the government is to resign en masse and accept the people's
judgment.''
   Doi said she would meet with other opposition party leaders
Friday to discuss ways to force Takeshita to step down and to iron
out details on a possible coalition.
   The opposition has stalled legislative business but cannot
legally force Takeshita out. The Liberal Democrats command 297 out
of 512 seats in the Lower House of Parliament and 143 out of 252
seats in the Upper House.
   Recent opinion polls indicate public support for Takeshita,
however, has fallen to 9 percent, the lowest level for any prime
minister since World War II ended in 1945.
   Three Cabinet ministers have resigned because of their links to
the Recruit scandal and prosecutors have arrested 14 people,
including former senior public officials and corporate executives
on suspicion of bribery and violations of securities laws.
   At least 17 politicians, including Takeshita and former Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, have been implicated in the scandal,
although none has been arrested. Prosecutors reportedly have begun
questioning politicians and their aides.

   And the winner was ABC's coverage of the
Oscar awards, which got its highest TV ratings in five years. But
it wasn't enough to stop NBC from winning its 41th-consecutive week
in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings.
   The 61st Academy Awards ceremony was last week's No. 1 show,
earning a 29.8 rating and a 50 share. ABC estimated the Oscar's
U.S. audience at 75 million.
   The Oscar telecast rating was its biggest since 1984, but NBC
still won the week with a rating of 15.8, extending the network's
record.
   ABC was second with 14.4. CBS had 12.4.
   Season to date, NBC leads with 15.8, ABC has 12.9 and CBS 12.7.
Each ratings point represents 904,000 households with television.
The share is a percentage of sets in use.
   NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' finished second last week and ABC's
sitcom ``Roseanne'' was in third place. ``Roseanne'' had finished
ahead of ``Cosby'' the previous threeeks.
   The rest of the top 10: ``A Different World,'' NBC; `Cheers,''

   Mayor Vincent C. Schoemehl Jr. easily won
re-election Tuesday, becoming only the third of St. Louis' 42
mayors to earn a third term.
   With about 50 percent of the votes counted, the Democratic
incumbent had 29,896 votes to Republican challenger Bernard J.
Elking's 10,943 votes, election officials said.
   ``It's a great honor, it really is,'' Schoemehl said.
   However, he added, ``I think politicians get in trouble when
they see mandates in things. In campaigning I found that people
expect things to get better. I certainly don't intend to sit back
and take it easy.''
   The city has not had a Republican mayor since 1949. Schoemehl,
who got little competition from Elking, conducted a low-key
campaign, relying on appearances at a few small gatherings and on
upbeat television commercials.
   The real race came in last month's Democratic primary, when
Schoemehl handily defeated Michael V. Roberts, a former alderman.
   Schoemehl raised and spent $842,000 on the campaign as of last
week. Elking's total available was $11,185.
   A spokesman for the mayor said most of the expenses were tied to
campaigning before the March 7 primary. Some television ads,
however, were run again last weekend.

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham, impeached and removed
from office exactly a year ago, said Tuesday he'll run again in
1990.
   ``I committed no impeachable offense,'' the 64-year-old
Republican said at an evening rally at a hotel ballroom.
   The former auto dealer, elected in 1986 on his fifth try for
governor, convicted by the Senate on charges he misused funds and
obstructed justice, becoming the first governor impeached and
removed from office since 1929.
   However, lawyers are uncertain whether the impeachment vote
simply stripped Mecham of office or barred him from ever again
holding state office as well. And many moderate Republicans have
threatened to bolt if Mecham heads the ticket.
   ``I want to send word out to everyone in Arizona that I think we
can have a kinder and gentler Arizona,'' Mecham said. ``I think the
19 months between now and the general election of 1990 can be a
time of spirited debate on the issues but not name-calling and not
accusations without basis.''
   Mecham said he held no bitterness toward his critics but
considers himself to have been ``the object of more venemous
name-calling than anyone in our state and possibly in America.''
   Mecham has remained popular with a sizeable number of GOP voters
in a state where Republicans have an edge in registration.
   But former House Speaker Joe Lane, a Republican defeated in the
1988 primary after being targeted by Mecham supporters, said he was
``terribly distressed'' by Mecham's announcement. ``There'll be a
terrible primary. The Democrats will be organized and we'll have a
bloody primary, and I just hate to see that,'' Lane said.
   At the time of Mecham's removal, the the Senate stopped short of
explicitly approving a lifetime ban on his holding state office.
Attorney General Bob Corbin has been asked for an opinion on
whether Mecham can again hold office, but he noted that whatever he
comes up with can be challenged in court.
   Earlier Tuesday, Mecham said he had filed papers with the Senate
asking the Legislature to reconsider the votes by which it
impeached and ousted him.
   Legislative leaders said they doubted lawmakers would grant
Mecham a new impeachment trial and did not know how they could
consider the matter anyway because several incumbents had been
defeated in a post-impeachment election.
   The audience of about 400 Tuesday gave a standing ovation to
Mecham and his wife, Florence, when they arrived. Before Mecham
spoke, the crowd was entertained by tap dancers and a bluegrass
band and sang ``God Bless America.''
   The maverick conservative came under fire immediately after his
election for eliminating the state's Martin Luther King Jr.
holiday. Controversial appointments and statements that offended
blacks, Jews, Asians and others also ate away at his popularity
despite a no-tax stand that won support from many voters.
   He was impeached by the Republican-controlled House on charges
of misusing state money for his auto dealership, trying to thwart a
state investigation of a death threat and concealing a developer's
$365,000 campaign loan.
   The Republican-controlled Senate convicted him of misuse of
money and obstruction. It left the third charge to a Superior Court
jury, which acquitted Mecham.
   His removal put Rose Mofford, Arizona's Democratic secretary of
state, into the governor's office.
   During the evening rally, Mecham attorney Donald MacPherson said
that lawmakers failed to decide the issue ``according to the law
and evidence.'' He said he wasn't worried that the Senate might
refuse a new impeachment trial.
   ``If we don't get relief there, we have every intention of
taking it to the highest court in Arizona and, if need be, to the
U.S. Supreme Court,'' he said as the crowd rose to its feet and
applauded.
   In papers filed with the Senate, lawyers for Mecham claimed the
Legislature trampled on the rights of voters by ousting the
governor under rules of proceedure that were not as stringent as
those that apply in criminal trials.
   John Mawhinney, a Tucson Republican and Senate majority leader,
said he did not believe that ``there'd be any way in the world''
lawmakers would change their minds.
   ``We believe it was an appropriate, fair, constitutional
exercise of both the House of Representatives and the Senate,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Pit In Luxor Temple Yields 15 More Ancient Statues</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Excavators have uncovered another 15 statues
of ancient royalty and gods from a pit inside Luxor Temple that
yielded five magnificent statues earlier this year.
   The overall find is as significant as the discovery of the tomb
of Tutankhamun in 1922, which yielded enormous amounts of gold and
other precious objects, said Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization.
   ``The Tut tomb was wonderful but gave us information only about
the art of the day,'' Tawfik said Tuesday. ``This find will answer
many questions about many periods of history.''
   He said one of the new statues is unlike any ever found: a
42-inch-high white granite cobra, probably representing Mertsager,
the goddess of silence. Her job was to keep secret the location of
royal tombs in the bone-dry valleys of the kings and queens across
the Nile River opposite present-day Luxor 450 miles south of Cairo.
   Tawfik and other Egyptian officials said workers trying to take
the search deeper hit underground water at the 10-foot level that
makes digging more difficult.
   Water is more than 3 feet deep at the bottom of the pit,
endangering not only the excavation but a row of towering columns
nearby, Tawfik said.
   Many Egyptologists consider Luxor Temple, built more than 3,300
years ago, the most endangered monument in the antiquity-rich Luxor
area. It lies in a picturesque setting between the Nile and the
modern town of Luxor and suffers greatly from rising water and
other natural debilitations.
   The new statues, found in a sacred courtyard beneath the earlier
finds, cover a wide range of Egyptian history and include
depictions of some of Egypt's best-known rulers and a pantheon of
gods.
   Tawfik said the earliest appears to be an alabaster Sphinx
dating from the reign of Tutankhamun, the young pharaoh who died in
1323 B.C. after a 10-year reign. The latest is a whnite
cobra from the reign of Tao ruled for 26 years and died in
664 B.C. at a time when the pharaonic period was in its death
throes.
   He said some of theries are broken and lack the
artistic excellence of the original five.
   Most of the new stere found last month. Officials said
pieces of some statues were buried at diff
phenomenon they could not explain.
   On Jan.ound the first of the original five
beautifully preserved statues from the New Kingdom, a golden age of
wealth and power for Egyptian kings. The five dated from the reigns
of Amenhophis III, the builder of Luxor Temple who ruled from 1391
to 1353 B.C., to Haremhab, a powerful military commander who died
in 1307 B.C., 12 years after gaining the throne following
Tutankhamun's pnd the brief reign of the caretaker
Aya.
   Antiquities experts are debating why the statues ried,
when and by whom. The answers may never be found.
   ``We have to wait to find the answers, because evee
think we have the right information, we have to change our mim different
periods are found,'' Tawfik
said. ``Now we've even found Roman pottery'' in the exc  The Luxor Temple
cache doesn't appear to approach in number
those statues discovered early th

   Nutritionally speaking, Americans don't know
beans, a diet franchising company's survey showed.
   Among the wrong answers in a survey commissioned by Nutri-System
Inc. were:
   _41 percent said ketchup is a vegetable.
   _60 percent said the sweeteners honey, molasses and corn syrup
are complex carbohydrates.
   _40 percent don't know that the marbling in meat is fat.
   _42 percent think pretzels contain more fat than potato chips.
   _89 percent said mayonnaise is composed of saturated fat (when
it fact it is highly polyunsaturated).
   Overall, a national sample of 1,000 adults scored 61 percent, an
F, on a true-false nutrition test given by telephone. No margin of
error was given.
   Women and all middle-aged adults did somewhat better than people
older than age 60 and younger than 30, but in general all ``lack a
significant understanding of the most basic nutritional
information,'' according to the report released Tuesday.

   Seton Hall's appearance in the NCAA
basketball championship game was too good to pass up even for some
in the school's hometown who had vowed to turn off TVs for loftier
pursuits.
   School officials and librarians in South Orange and neighboring
Maplewood asked their communities this week to turn televisions off
and engage in more enriching activities.
   But that seemed next to impossible with Seton Hall in Monday
night's game, which it lost to Michigan by one point in overtime.
   ``This is a once in a very blue moon event,'' said Ruth
Greenwald, head of adult services at the Maplewood Library. ``On
the other hand, no one says I have to be glued to the television.
It's a minor infraction.''
   ``I'm watching the game, no question about it,'' said David
Javerbaum, 17, a senior at Columbia High School.
   During the campaign, families are supposed to keep a daily log
of their activities. To keep their minds off television, a puppet
show, a story telling festival for children and a celebrity read-in
were being held in the communities.

   Tom Hanks says he was a lanky manic kid in
school who had trouble getting a date.
   ``I was death with women _ absolutely the strike-out king,'' he
says in May's Good Housekeeping magazine.
   Despite his success in such movies as ``Big,'' and ``The
'Burbs,'' Hanks said he still has trouble figuring out his appeal.
   He describes himself as having ``funny-looking lips'' and says
``my butt's too big and my chest's too small.''
   He also remains ambivalent about his fame and fortune.
   ``I don't view myself as successful,'' he said. ``I think of

   Deaf actress Marlee Matlin bristles when
criticized for speaking on television, saying she refuses to be
``put in a box.''
   Matlin said in this week's TV Guide she expects to disturb some
deaf people when she speaks in the upcoming CBS movie ``Bridge to
Silence.''
   Matlin said she faced a lot of pressure because she speaks in
the movie instead of using only sign language.
   ``Just speaking in this picture, even if I speak perfectly, puts
pressure on me because some people don't think I should be speaking
at all,'' she said.
   Deaf representatives were dismayed last year when Matlin chose
to speak while making an Academy Award presentation. ABC did not
show the interpreter, who was using sign language for deaf viewers,
even though the interpreter stood only a few feet away from the
Oscar-winning actress.
   ``If I didn't begin speaking in public at the Oscars and proving
I can speak in films, then my career goes nowhere,'' Matlin said.
``If some people got infuriated with what I did, that's their
problem. I'm not going to get put in a box as the deaf actress.''

   Willie Nelson was singing a new tune in a
different place _ the Legislature.
   Though more at home in concert halls, the singer appeared before
a House committee Tuesday to testify in favor of his friend Jim
Hightower, the state's elected agriculture commissioner.
   Hightower, a two-term Democrat, has come under fire from the
chemical industry over strict pesticide regulations and from the
Farm Bureau over his efforts to sell hormone-free beef to Europe.
   Because the commissioner's job is the only statewide post
unprotected by the Texas Constitution, Republican Gov. Bill
Clements has the power to veto it out of existence.
   Nelson told the committee his concern about chemical use was
raised while rabbit hunting a few years ago with his cousin, who
blamed the lack of rabbits on pesticides. A friend recently blamed
pesticide use for the lack of horned toads, which eat ants, Nelson
said.
   ``So I'm here today to represent the rabbits and the horny
toads,'' he told laughing lawmakers and applauding spectators.

   Country music star Hank Williams Jr. has
been banned from the city's arena for cutting short a concert there.
   Williams sang for only 40 minutes Sunday night at Viking Hall to
a crowd of 5,000 that paid $17.50 each for tickets, and the angry
fans burned T-shirts and other souvenirs.
   Williams, 39, offered the audience no explanation when he
suddenly walked off stage, said Terrie Smith, director of the
city-owned hall.
   Fans screamed and booed for nearly an hour after Williams jumped
into a limousine for the airport. Members of the arena's board were
in the audience and decided to ban any future performances by
Williams.
   Kathy Gangwisch, Williams' publicist, said the performer was
sick with a cold or the flu. ``He wasn't feeling up to par, but he
thought he could do the show and wanted to go on rather than face a
postponement,'' she said.
   Ms. Smith didn't buy that explanation. ``He was obnoxious, but
he was definitely not sick,'' she said.

   It's been 44 years since Julie Harris made
her Broadway debut, and the actress who has won five Tony Awards
shows no signs of tiring of the stage.
   Among the changes she said she has seen in the theater are that
``there aren't that many plays being done in New York anymore. The
regional theaters have taken over and that's a big movement.''
   The 63-year-old actress particularly loves the role she's
playing now, a woman who ages from 72 to 97 in Alfred Uhry's 1988
Pulitzer Prize-winning play ``Driving Miss Daisy.''
   Miss Harris plays a Southern widow named Daisy who has a crusty
relationship with her black chauffeur, played by Brock Peters.
   ``Daisy, if you pull her apart and put her under a microscope,
has a lot of faults,'' Miss Harris said by telephone from Seattle,
where she was appearing in the show prior to its Los Angeles
opening on Friday.
   ``She's proud, she is prejudiced in her own way, and yet she's
an adorable, wonderful character because she's like all of us,
she's not perfect,'' Miss Harris said.

<HEAD>Oil Spill Shows Need to Tighten Fuel-Economy Standard, Senators Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators criticized the auto industry and its
regulators for failing to work for tighter fuel-economy standards
that would make it easier for the nation to cope with events such
as the Alaska oil spill that affect the fuel supply.
   ``The less the amount of gasoline consumed in this country, the
more able we are to respond to events,'' said Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and chairman of the Senate energy regulation
and conservation subcommittee, during a hearing Tuesday into the
fuel-economy standards adopted to reduce petroleum usage.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez last month ran aground in Alaska's
Prince William Sound, spilling more than 10 million gallons of oil.
The spill endangered wildlife in the area and prompted a sharp
increase in gasoline prices, especially in California.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration since August
has been considering where to set the corporate average fuel
economy standard, the gas mileage each automaker's fleet of cars
must attain, for the 1990 model year.
   NHTSA's managing director, Howard Smolkin, told the subcommittee
the present regulatory process required the agency to set the fue
economy standard at between 26.5 mpg and 27.5 mpg. The regulation
for 1989 required the mix ofmaker to average
26.5 mpg.
   The agency could require a significantly higher fuel-economy
standard only by beginning the rule-making process anew, Smolkin
said.
   Scrapping the present regulatory process in favor of a proposed
rulening ``would be one of the factors we
would cokin said.
   Legislation proposed by Metzenbaum would tighten the
fuel-economy standard to 34s per gallon by 2000.
   NHTSAesentatives of the Energy Department and
Environmental Protection Agency agreed agencies would support
greater fuel efficiencying refused to endorse
tighter fuel-economy standards.
   ``We seem to have an administration adrift on this issue, just
as the Exxon Valdez is adrift, and I hope we don't go up on the
sh,'' said Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo.
   Metzenbaum accused theakers of being too rigid in their
opposition toeconomy standards, saying the Big Three
``aren't working with us but are working against us.''
   The automakers have argued ning the fuel-economy
standards would cause theto reduce large-car production ider
to bring their mix of sales within the guidelines. The companies
contend the buying publicwants larger cars, and tightening the
standard would drive them into the showrooms of foreign makers to
buy the cars the U.S. makers could not provide.
   ``The source of our concern is not the desire to be adversarial.annot
go north and south at the same time,'' said Marine
Whitman, General Motors Corp. vice president.
   The fuel-economy law was adopted in 1975 to reduce gasoline
consumption at a time of rapidly rising oil prices.
   The law set a goal of 27.5 mpg beginning in 1985, but the Reagan
administration loosened the requirement to 26 mpg in 1986 at the
request of the automakers.

   The number of babies being born in the United
States is bounding back from the low levels of recent years,
according to a new report that shows the increase occurring despite
a decline in the number of women in the prime childbearing ages.
   Births totaled 3.9 million last year, up 2 percent from the year
before and the most in this country since 1964, the National Center
for Health Statistics reported Tuesday.
   At the same time, the Center said, the nation set an all-time
record for the number of deaths in a year, marriages declined
slightly and the number of divorces increased.
   The statistical center, a division of the Department of Health
and Human Services, said the 1988 birth rate was 15.9 per 1,000
people, up from 15.7 a year earlier.
   ``Within the childbearing ages the number of women 15-29
declined while the number of women 30-44 increased,'' reported the
Center. It noted that the ages 20 to 29 have traditionally been the
prime years for American women to have children.
   Thus, an increase in the overall number of births at the same
time the most productive segment of the population is shrinking
indicates a shift in the timing of births, a phenomenon population
experts have been expecting in recent years.
   Martin O'Connell, a fertility researcher at the Census Bureau,
commented increasing births among women in their 30s indicates
an adjustment pattern in tlife cycle of women.
   The nun in the 30 to 44 age group is increasing
simply because so many were born duri post World War II Baby
Boom, O explained in a telephone interview.
   But th ratio of births between the youlder women is
shifting, he said. That compensates for the declining number of
er women.
   Women in their 20 averaging about 110 births per
1,000 women annually, compared with about 70 for women in their0s, he said.
Twenty years ago, he said, the ratio was more thanin favor of the younger
group.
Age-specific birth rates for 1988 were not yet available.
   Bt federal reports show that in 17.8 per
1,000 women aged 20 to 24 and 145.1 for those aged 25 t. Women
aged 30 to 34 had a rate of 73.3 but by the ages of 35  39 it
fell to 31.7.
   By 19aged 20 to 24 was down to 115.1 and
it was 112.9 for those 25 to 29, a significant decline over the
years as women postponed marriage and childbearing in favor of
higher educations and beginning careers, O'Connell explained.
   For those aged 30 to 34 the rate was down also, falling to 61.9,
whileen aged 35 to 39 were having 19.8 babies per 1,000.
   Since 1e continued to see a decline,
with the rate falling to 108.2 for those under 25 and 109.2 at 25
to 29 by 1986, the most recent year for which tistics
were available.
   But between 1980 and 1986 the rates rebounded for the older
group, a situation that appears to be continuing. The0 to 34 and 24.3 at
ages 35 to 39.
   This delay is from a combination of factors, O'Connell said,
including delays in marriage that are resulting in a shift in the
timing of childbearing for women.
   The delay allows them to become more established in a career and
potentially financially more sren,
researchers pointed out at the meeting of the Population
Association of America last week.
   This allows women to decide to have children sooner after
marriage than they might if wed while younger and also gives them a
sense of security in casehe marriage should fail, researchers
said.
   Deaths in 1988 ord representing an
increase of 44,000 from the year before. The rising population and
its increasing average age has led to record numbers of deaths in
most recent years.
   The 1988 death rate was 8.8 per 1,000 people, up from 8.7 a year
earlier.
   ``Contributing to the increase in the death rate was the
increasing proportion of older persons in the population and the
influenza outbreak during the first four months of 1988,'' the
Center for Health Statistics reported.
   The Center's annual report also showed 2.4 million marriages in
1988, down 1 percent from the year before, and 1.2 million
divorces, a 2 percent increase.

   Seven Cuban human rights activists were arrested
shortly before they planned to rally in support of reforms similar
to those embraced by visiting Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, a dissident spokesman said.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
condemned the arrests, saying they underlined ``the need for
ongoing monitoring of the human rights situation in Cuba.''
   Among those arrested on Tuesday was Samuel Martinez Lara, leader
of the Pro-Human Rights Party of Cuba, said Elizardo Sanchez, a
dissident activist.
   Martinez Lara's party and two other human rights groups had
planned to gather at the Soviet Embassy on Tuesday evening to ask
Gorbachev to pressure President Fidel Castro to adopt Soviet-style
reforms.
   Gorbachev, who was to leave for London today, is popular among
some Cubans because of his greater tolerance for opposing views and
his introduction of some capitalistic innovations.
   Castro, on the other hand, has been strongly committed to
maintaining Marxist orthodoxy and has rejected the concept of open
debate.
   Sanchez said that among others taken into custody was Roberto
Bahamonde, who gained attention last month by seeking election to a
seat on a municipal assembly by running as a dissident.
   It is believed the first time a dissident has launched such a
challenge in 30 years.
   Bahamonde lost the election against a pro-establishment
candidate but complained that he was not allowed to campaign on his
platform, which calls for a restoration of private enterprise.
   The arrest of Martinez Lara was confirmed by a Cuban Foreign
Ministry spokesman, Hector Argiles, who said the dissident had been
engaged in unauthorized activities.
   Sanchez said the families of the detainees have not been
informed of their whereabouts. ``They are being hidden,'' he said.

   The number of refugees who have fled their
native lands rose by 1.1 million last year to 14.4 million, mostly
because of civil wars in East Africa and the war in Afghanistan,
the U.S. Committee for Refugees reported.
   And this year the number arriving in the United States is
expected to top 100,000 for the first time since 1982.
   Another 14 million to 20 million people are refugees within
their own countries.
   But the numbers are approximate, because in many places, no
careful figures are kept and there are many definitions of who is a
refugee.
   ``These are not numbers,'' said Roger P. Winter, director of the
committee, in a statement on its report. ``They are people. Each
one of these 14.4 million represents an individual human tragedy.''
   The committee is a private group financed by foundations,
churches and contributions from individuals.
   The biggest new groups described in its annual report, made
public this week, are:
   _335,000 who fled to Ethiopia when a long-simmering revolt
flared up last summer in Somalia, on the northeast tip of Africa.
About 600,000 people have been displaced within Somalia, a country
bigger than France and with a population of about 8 million.
   _Almost 250,000 Mozambicans who fled a 14-year-old revolt
against their Communist government by the Renamo guerrilla
movement, which has support in South Africa. The commitee says 1.15
million Mozambicans have now gone to other countries and 2 million
of the country's 15 million people have been violently uprooted
within its borders.
   _150,000 refugees from a civil war between non-Moslems and the
Islamic government of Sudan. They have moved eastward into
Ethiopia, one  world's poorest countries, bringing the total
Sudanese there to 350,000. About 2 million peopleported
to have lost their homes in Sudan. The y has 24 million
inhabitants and more than twice the area of Egypt, its northern
neighbor.
   The largest number of refugees comes from Afghion. Most are in Pakistan,
which shelters the world's
biggest refugee population. Another 2 mill within
their homeland.
   Palestinians _ 2.p the second largest group.
Ethiopia, to which 700,000 refugees have fled, has seen about 2.1
million of its own people flee abroad.
   Refugees differ widely. Most of the Afghans have fled in the
last eight or nine years. Many Palestinians left more than 40 years
ago when Israel became a state, ad their children and
grandchildtill considered refugees.
   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugeeserre
Hocke, praised countries which have taken in refugees as
safeguarding the unity of the family.
   U.S. tate James A. Baker III told Congress last
month that he is planning to ask for another $100 miear
for refugees, in addition to the $412 millie.
But for the following year the Bush administration has sought a cut
in spending.
   Bakerwill complete a review of its refugee
programs soon after May 1.
   Just before leaving office in January, President Reagan raised
to 25,000 the number of rgees from the Soviet Union and eastern
Europe titted into this country during the year that will
end Sept. 30. That will leave 7,000 fewer poss for people
from Vietnam, but almost 40,000 plwill still be available for
them.
   Hocke, writing in a specn of his agency's publication
`'' said the most natural solution for refugees is to
send them home when conditions change enough so that they are
welcome. He called attention to those repatriated last year to
Ethiopia, Uganda and El Salvador.
   The U.S. committee reported only about 280,000 voluntary
repatriati for the year, tto Uganda and
Burundi in southern Africa.

   Fred Gadomski wants to make
meteorology students as comfortable with television lights as they
are with computer forecasting.
   Gadomski teaches Penn State University's ``Introduction to
Television Meteorology,'' where seniors who who have weathered
courses in topics such as atmospheric dynamics and calculus learn
to mix show business with science.
   ``It's easier to make a meteorologist a good communicator than
it is to teach meteorology to a TV personality,'' said Gadomski, a
meteorologist on public television in Pennsylvania.
   Penn State has the largest meteorology department in the
country. It graudates one in four meteorologists and is one of only
a few schools to teach TV to would-be weather forecasters.
   Gadomski and Charles Gudeman, a senior producer at Penn State's
public television station, WPSX-TV, tell students in the course to
befriend the camera, speak in everyday terms and look as though
theyng the time of their life doing it.
   ``Television stations will always choose personality ov
expertise. People tune in to see people. They want information, but
they want it to come from a friend,'' Gudeman said.
   S-year-old course do the weather the way the
pros do: live, in a television studio, without a TelePrompTer and
with weather maps visible only on a monitor.
   They also must field off-the-wall questions from Gadomski, who
plays the anchorman in the mock broadcasts.
   In a recent class, these queries included wheer to open
windows during tornadoes and how hail can become golze.
   ``We figure they'll be able to handle a kindly anchor if they're
able to handle a malevolent one. And it's much more fun for me to
be malevolent,'' said Gadomski.
Students don't spend all their course time in front of the
camera. They also do writing exercises, talk with people in the
industry and learn about the equipment needed to set up a station's
meteorology department.
   Meteorologists, once a rarity on television, now account for
more than half the forecasters on TV, according to Sherlee Barish,
an agent for on-air news personnel.
   But Barbara Frye, director of talent placement for Frank N.
Magid andAssociates, a national consulting and research f
Marion, Iowa, said stations in recent years have been shying away
from meteorologists after a rush to hire from the late 1970s to
mid-1980s.
   ``It used to be the most important qualification a person could
have ... was being a meteorologist,'' Fryd. ``Now it's
personality. It's a person who can communicate. A lot of
meteorologists, quite frankly, can't.''
   Gadomski said meteorologists have an advantage over the TV
weathermen who rely on the Nat Weather Service forecasts.
Meteorologists can ickly analyze and report severe weather
conditiecifically for a television station's coverage area,
he said.

<HEAD>Vietnam To Withdraw From Cambodia In June, Report Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with news conferences scheduled,

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam will withdraw all of its troops stationed
in Cambodia by the end of June _ ending a 10-year occupation, a
Japanese news agency reported Wednesday.
   Kyodo News Service, in a report from Hanoi, quoted ``reliable
sources'' as saying Vietnam had decided on a complete and
unconditional withdrawal of all its troops from Cambodia by June 30.
   Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach was expected to
issue a statement on the decision later Wednesday, Kyodo said in
the report monitored in Tokyo.
   Simultaneous news conferences on the decision were scheduled
Wednesday in Hanoi and Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital.
   Vietnam previously has said it would withdraw its troops by
1990, but would move the pullout up to September if a political
settlement could be reached on the civil war. An estimated 70,000
Vietnamese troops are in Cambodia.
   The Vietnamese are fighting a coalition of three major
resistance groups: the communist Khmer Rouge of Khieu Samphan; the
non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front of former
Cambodian Prime Minister Son Sann; and followers of former
Cambodian head of state Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   Sihanouk, who was deposed in 1970, heads the resistance
coalition.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, drove out the radical
Khmer Rouge regime that had defeated the U.S.-backed government in
the spring of 1975, and installed another communist administration.
   During the Khmer Rouge regime, it is estimated that about 2
million of Cambodia's 8 million people died from Khmer Rouge
executions, famine and civil unrest.
   Their role in a post-occupation coalition government has been a
major hurdle to a peace accord because their have the strongest
fighting force in the resistance.
   Fears of the Khmer Rouge returning to power have grown recently
as Vietnam withdrew part of its troops from Cambodia. There have
been at least six partial withdrawals since 1981, although foreign
critics charged that in some cases, fresh troops replaced those
that withdrew.

<HEAD>Arias Supports Non-Military Aid for Contras</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, endorsing
the Bush administration's package of nearly $50 billion in
non-military aid for Nicaraguan Contra rebels, wants Cuba to follow
suit and halt military aid to leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   After meeting Tuesday with President Bush, Vice President Dan
Quayle and Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Arias said the
so-called humanitarian aid was essential for integrating the
Contras back into Nicaraguan society.
   ``You cannot persuade the Contras to go back to Nicaragua if you
have nothing to offer them,'' he said. ``There's no freedom,
there's no democracy, they cannot integrate into political life;
and economic conditions are not the best.''
   Arias, who won the Nobel Peace Prize two years ago for his
Central America peace plan calling for a halt of all outside
military support for rebel groups in the region, said Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev now has to persuade Cuban President
Fidel Castro to stop sending arms to Salvadoran leftists.
   ``Ifupports sincerely the Central American peace plan he
has to ... persuade Fidel Castro not to ke
guerrillas in El Salvador,'' Arias said of Gorbachev, who is
meeting with Castro in Havana this week.
   ``We have learned that we must change bullets by ballots and we
can only do this with the support of the Cubans and the Soviet
Union,'' Arias said.
   Gorbachev told the Cuban National AssembTuesday that the
Soviet Union opposes the ``export of revolutioterrevolution,'' referring
to both Cuban and U.S. policy in
Latin America.
   But he also said his country will continue supplying weaponry to
Nicaragua's leftist government as long as the United States
continues to arm other Central American countries.
   And he called the Bush administration's continued non-military
support for the Contras ``worrisome.''
   Developed with bipartisan support after eight years of bitter
battles between Congress and the former Reagan administration over
military aid for the Contras, the new package of humanitarian aid
is intended to support the rebels until the Nicaraguan elections
next February.
   ``Now people here can talk with one single voice,'' Arias said
of the United States.
   He contrasted what he called ``lip service'' from the former
Reagan administration for his peace plan with officials in the new
Bush administration who are ``quite sincere and ... are doing what
they are doing in good faith.''
   ``I breathe a new atmosphere, a new environment, because I have
no doubts Mr. Bush and the Bush administration are going to
sincerely support the Guatemala accord, the Arias plan,'' he said.
   Quayle said Arias' s Bush's plan puts the ball in
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's court to respond with
democratic reforms.
ayle said.
   Arias told Bush he still worries about how fair 
elections will be.
   He stressed the need to afford ample time for voter
registration, and said the Nicarans must allow establishment of
a TV station that is not controlled by the Sandinistas and as well
as assuring  access to the media by politicaes.
   ``Otherwise it will be very difficult to talk about free
elections,'' Arias said.
   An administration source said Arias told Bush that democratic
nations should closely scrutinize plans the Sandinistas are making
for the elctoral process.
   Arias said heso had told Castro that _ in vieush's
emphasis on non-military r the Contras _ ``It was time for
him ... if he supports our peace plan ... to stop supporting the
guerrillas in El Salvador.'   ``I told Fidel Castro ... that it was time
for him to step down
from the Sierra Maestra,'' ias said, referring to the mountain
range from where Castro orchestrated Cuba's revolution in 1959.

   Gourmet food doesn't have to be dripping in
calories and cholesterol to be sinfully delicious, according to
America's premier chefs, who are catering more and more to
health-conscious connoisseurs.
   ``There's a whole move toward freshness,'' said Lawrence
Forgione, chef proprietor of An American Place in New York. ``This
is what people want. They want to be informed. They want to know
what they're eating.''
   ``I see it becoming lighter, more natural,'' agreed Byron Bardy,
manager of national accounts research and development for Heinz
USA. ``You don't necessarily need a pound of butter to make a good
sauce.''
   Forgione and Bardy are among seven top chefs who have been
invited to dish out their best at a $1,500-a-person gourmet gala in
October for Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. The world's leading
pediatric liver transplant center will launch its 1990 centennial
celebration with the culinary extravaganza.
   Half the 100 dinner tickets already have been gobbled up, solely
through word of mouth. Interest is just as keen at other
fund-raising affairs that feature the creations of leading chefs.
   ``How can you participate in fund-raising and cook something
that the average person doesn't want to eat anymore?'' Bardy asked.
``I mean, we all have to move ahead.''
   ``They're getting bored with always eating meat and potatoes,''
said Jean Banchet, chef and owner of Le FrancaiWheeling, Ill.,
near Chicago.
   A preview luncheon Monday featured a consomme of wild mushrooms,
grilled manated quail and California garden greens, all examples
of low-c
   Not that the great chefs have gotten out all the fat. The
luncheon also featured Banchet's duck liver with artichoke, truffle
and toast brioche and a butter-laden dish f creamed crawfish in
bread boaed by Cajun cook Paul Prudhomme, owner of K-Paul's
Louisiana Kitchen in New Orleans.
   Also on the high-calorie side was an apple dessert with
kiln-dried c sauce and topped with a sugar dome.
   ``Butter and cream are not something that you do in abundance,
nor do I think anybody does,'' Forgione said.
   Forgione cooks with only free-ranging chickens, those that are
chemical-free and allowed to graze naturally, while Banchet has
begun putting sauces on the side rather than on the food.
   Another chef offering his services ospital,
Jean-Louis Palladin of Jean-Louis at Watergate in Washington,
removes as much fat as possible from his dishes.
   ``If they are too heavy on the ch (customers) will
never come baladin said.
   Chefs with a conscience are blending what people want to eat
with what they should eat, according to Ferdinand Metz, president
of The Culinary Institute of America.
   ``Inot just the responsibility of the chefs to wait and say,
`Well, let's wait to e if they become more sophistica' said
Metz, who is baking the rt for the gala.
   ``We have a responsibility to lead, and I'm actually somewhat
disappointed in the lack ofcorporate responsibility that I see on
the part of some of the fast-food people.''
   Education is the main ingredient to healthy eating, and the New
York institute's 22,000 graduates are busy spreading the word,
according to Metz.
   ``The message will get around,. ``It's an enormous
undertaking, but I think we're making progress.''

<HEAD>Key Lenders Vow Action on U.S. Debt Plan</HEAD>

   Spurred by concerns of social and political
turmoil in Third World countries, government-financed world lending
agencies hope to have a new U.S.-sponsored program in place by July
for reducing their foreign debt.
   ``We have an opportunity, if we seize it, to put the worst
aspects of the debt crisis behind us,'' World Bank President Barber
Conable said Tuesday at the close of the Bank's spring meeting with
the International Monetary Fund.
   The sister organizations ended their two-day conference with an
endorsement of the Bush administration's new debt initiative, which
for the first time asks private banks to voluntarily forgive part
of the Third World's $1.3 trillion debt.
   Elements of the plan could be put in practice by the time the
leaders of the world's economic democracies come together for their
mmit scheduled for July in Paris, officials said.
   A delay ``could be devastating in view ofated,'' Conable said.
   Throughout their meetings, officials ound the world spoke
repeatedly of social and political powder kegs that could be
ignited as living standards inue to stagnate or deteriorate in
debt-burdened developing countries.
   Riots in Venezuela in February that claimed 270 lives after the
government institung program to placate the
nation's creditors were an ``alarm signal,'' French Finance
Minister Pierre Beregovoy told reporters.
   B.T. Chidzero, Zimbabwe's finance minister and chairman of the
World Banelopment committee, said it was clear to the
finance officials ``that expectations have been raised. People
expect action. .... Expeditious action is required. ... Failure (tt) will
spell disaster.''
   Conable said the bank had created a task force that will start
work by the end of this week with the IMF on speeding
implementation of the new debt relief progon among the Bank, IMF, debtor
nations and commercial
banks is needed to ``flesh out ... a feasible plan,'' he said.
   A senior U.S. Treasury official, spea he not be
name likely be the first country to
qualify for debt relief. Mexico and Venezuela have also been
mentioned as earlfor assistance.
   IMF and World Bank approval of the so-called Brady plan named
after Treasury Secretary Nicrady was critical, since the
Bush administration is counting on most of the fincing for the
debt relief scheme to come from the two organizations.
   Basicaly, the plan seeks to entice banthey have made to Third World
countries in return for
assurances from the IMF and World Bank th paid.
   The administration projects cutting the debt of 39 major debtor
nations by 20 percent over the next three years with financing of
2 billion each from the IMF and the World Bank.
   IMF and World Bank officials refused to discuss specific dollar
amounts they would kick into the program, saying that depends on
how many countries adopt the economic reform programs required to
qualify for the debt relief.
   Micessus, the IMF's managing director, told reportenation organization
recognized the need to movepell out just how the debt relief will work
in order to
remove uncertainty in ongoing negotiations between debtor countries
and creditors.
   ``Nothing is worse than uncertainty,'' he said. ``The sooner we
can assemble  program and provide answers, the better the chance
for success
   In support of the plan, Japan has pledged to loan up to $4.5
billion to developing nations over the next several years, a
commitment that is viewed as critical since the flow of commercial
bank lending has been drying up.
   However, the meeting did not turn inctory for the
administration. Because of objections from the British in
particular, the steering committee refused to endorse a U.S.
proposal to use IMF and t
payments on the debt as well as the reduced amounts of princicountries
had objected that the more
costly intt-rate guarantees represented little more than a
bailout to comhe loans.
   The IMF promised only to ``examine'' the question of interest
rate subsidies.

<HEAD>Suffering, Disfigurement Found in Search for Beauty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patients seeking a fountain of youth through
an estimated 3 million cosmetic operations each year are sometimes
getting more than they bargained for _ suffering and disfigurement.
   A House panel investigating alleged unscrupulous practices by
unqualified physicians was told Tuesday by one woman that a tummy
tuck severely damaged her heart and left her scarred for life.
   Another testified that liposurgery to remove the ``saddlebags''
from her thighs disfigured her leg because too much fat was sucked
out and nearly drove her to suicide.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chairman of the House Small Business
subcommittee on regulation, said cosmetic surgery remains ``a
dangerously under-regulated medical field'' which physicians can
practice with no special licenses.
   The subcommittee earlier issued a six-month study which found
that 95 percent of cosmetic operations are performed in doctors'
offices where crucial emergency equipment is often lacking.
   Currently, any medical school graduate with a state license can
perform cosmetic surgery. While nearly every state requires drivers
to prove they have liability insurance, doctors can practice
cosmetic surgery without any insurance coverage.
   Various medical officials agreed Tuesday there is room for the
profession to toughen its own standards.
   But Richard T. Caleel, president of the American Academy of
Cosmetic Surgery, argued against any effort to narrow the practice
to any particular group of specialists, or to any particular
facilities.
   ``No ... group of health care providers has a monopoly on the
provision of these services, nor is any group completely free of
individuals who abuse them,'' he said.
   However, R. Barrett Noone, president of the American Board of
Plastic Surgery, said other physicians have no business performing
cosmetic surgery.
   ``The plastic surgeon stands alone as the medical specialist
best qualified to ensure the safety and satisfaction of patients,''
Noone declared.
   Joyce Palso, of Santa Ana, Calif., said post-operative
infections resulting from sloppy work of a cosmetic surgeon sent
her into heart failure five times within a year.
   ``But I want to tell you this,'' she said. ``The doctor who did
the tummy tuck on me did the same procedurgistered nurse two months after
he did me. She died from the same
complications and infections that I had. So I am the lucky one.''
   ``Please _ someone musrol of these unqualified
physicians who are calorts of `cosmetic
specialists,''' she pleaded to the subcommittee.
   Angela R. Brown of Bowi and exercised
regularly for 16 years before turning to a plastic surgeon to
remove the ``saddgs'' from her thighs via liposurgery.
   ``I was led to believe that liposurgery was simple ansful,'' she said.
``And since I had chosen a qualified,
board-certified plastic and reconstructive surgeon, I we
everything would be just fine.''
   Ms. Brown said that about three weeks after her operation, ``I
noticed my right leg was caving in. So I called the doctor and went
for a checkup. As soon as he saw it, he calmly said, `I took out
too much fat.'''
   The surgeon told her the condition eventually would correct
itself, but instead it got worse, she said. She went to several
other surgeons, including one who told her three more operations,
costing $25,000, would sther only a 50-50 chance of
recovery.
   ``There were days,'' she testified, ``when I thought about
getting in my car and saying `Goodbye, world.'''
   Ms.Brown said the leg is almost bac for which she still owes medical
bills. Unlike
Ms. Palso, she has yet to collect any legal damages from her
surgeon, who has rested on unrelated charges.

<HEAD>Democrats Pull Back on Eastern Airlines Strike Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic lawmakers say a measure they once
characterized as urgently needed to end the Eastern Airlines strike
is not necessary at all _ for now.
   Democrats pulled the legislation off the Senate floor on
Tuesday, arguing that the bill might impede efforts to purchase the
troubled carrier and hinder bankruptcy court attempts to find a
solution to the labor impasse.
   The action came the same day that The Associated Press learned
former Baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth would announce a
new deal to buy Eastern. An earlier offer collapsed after Jay A.
Pritzker, owner of the Hyatt Hotel chain, reportedly came in with a
higher offer.
   The airline's striking unions, which had originally sought
passage of the bill, asked senators to hold off action on the
measure to allow potential purchasers a chance to work out a deal,
said Senate Labor Committee Chairman Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and
Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., chairman of the Senate aviation
subcommittee.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, took to the
Senate floor to say that the measure was being withdrawn to give
efforts to end the stalemate ``an unimpeded chance to work.'' He
said the measure might be returned to the floor in the future.
   The bill would require President Bush to appoint an emergency
board that would recommend a solution to the month-old walkout.
   Bush and congressional Republicans have opposed the measure,
saying the carrier's management and unions should work out their
dispute privately. Bush had threatened to veto the bill.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., noted Democratic claims
made last month just before the Senate's two-week Easter recess
that the emergency board legislation was urgently needed.
   ``No one can reasonably claim that the strike at Eastern is a
national emergency under any standard,'' Dole said.
   One of the driving forces of the strike has been the antipathy
union members have for Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent
company, Texas Air Corp.
   On March 9 _ five days after the walkout began, _ Eastern filed
for protection from creditors under the federal bankruptcy code. A
sale of the airline would require the approval of New York-based
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland, who is handling the
reorganization, and by a court-appointed panel representing
creditors.
   The House passed the measure with overwhelming support from
majority Democrats last month.

<HEAD>AIDS Discrimination Law to be Considered</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush will propose legislation to bar
discrimination against people carrying the AIDS virus if an ongoing
review of state laws shows a federal statute is warranted, an
administration official says.
   James Allen, acting director of the Public Health Service's
National AIDS Program Office, told a House panel on Tuesday that a
study of the status and effectiveness of state laws is being
conducted by George Washington University under a federal contract.
   Allen said the survey will be completed in a few months.
   ``If it seems appropriate, the administration will propose
legislation,'' he said in response to a question from Rep. Henry A.
Waxman, D-Calif.
   Waxman is chairman of the Energy and Commerce health
subcommittee that called witnesses for the first overview of the
status of the AIDS epidemic conducted since Bush became president.
   Waxman had opened the hearing by complimenting Bush's wife
Barbara for symbolic gestures toward AIDS patients, but wondering
whether Bush would follow up on a campaign commitment to back
federal anti-discrimination legislation.
   ``The first lady has already moved us all with her visit to AIDS
patients and her hugs for both babies and adults who are ill,''
Waxman said. ``With one photo session she has probably done more to
alleviate fear and to create compassion than could be done with a
dozen studies or hearings.''
   He referred to a recent visit by Barbara Bush to an AIDS
facility in Washington where she was photographed holding an infant
with AIDS and also embracing an adult with AIDS.
   ``She should be congratulated and thanked for bringing us closer
together at this time when we need to be close,'' continued Waxman.
``But such feelings aren't enough. The president promised help and
protection, and we must begin to put that assistance together as
budgets and laws.''
   Allen said 88,096 cases had been reported to the Centers for
Disease Control through the end of February. There was a 45 percent
increase in the number of reported cases during the most recent
12-month period when compared to the previous 12-month period, he
said.
   The White House AIDS commission and the independent Institute of
Medicine have urged passage of a federal ban on discrimination
against AIDS patients, saying it is necessary to get people to be
tested for AIDS who otherwise would not do so out of fear they
would lose their jobs and be evicted from their homes if they test
positive.
   Opponents say writing laws to apply specifically to people with
AIDS would give them a protected status not extended to people with
other fatal diseases.

<HEAD>Officials Hope to Plant National Guard Troopers along Border</HEAD>

   Cactuses along the Texas-Mexico border may
actually be National Guard troops camouflaged to gather
drug-trafficking intelligence information for federal agencies,
congressional officials say.
   A spokesman for the National Guard in Texas says he knows
nothing about the proposed intelligence-gathering efforts under a
$2.9 million appropriation from the Pentagon.
   But Sen. Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, says the money will
indeed be spent for air and ground surveillance by guard troops
dispatched to the state's 1,000-mile border with Mexico.
   Gramm said the troops will attempt to infiltrate areas of
suspected drug smuggling along the border and relay their findings
to agencies including the Border Patrol, U.S. Customs Service and
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   Gramm said the Guard is not disclosing many details of the
planned patrols, which would be part of a drug-trafficking package
by Guard troops that also calls for aerial surveillance and helping
Customs with search and seizure of cargo crossing the border into
Texas.
   A congressional source said the Texas Guard troops would use
camouflage paint to ``look like a cactus bush'' and then infiltrate
the border ``under cover of darkness'' as the guardsmen attempt to
gather information on drug-trafficking patterns.
   The $2.9 million in spending was approved last week by Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney, who also authorized plans by guardsmen in 11
other states to attack drug smuggling.
   Gramm said the so-called ``long-range reconnaissance patrol''
program ``is a new program the National Guard is not talking
about.''
   However, he said Tuesday, it would help federal agencies in the
``running war with drug smugglers along our border.''
   ``The American people clearly want the military more involved in
our war on drugs,'' Gramm said in an interview. ``It is not a
substitute for law enforcement, but it is a good complement. It
makes law enforcement more effective.''
   But Lt. Col. Ed Komandosky, spokesman for the National Guard in
Texas, said he was not aware of any such foot or air patrols
``whatsoever'' under the $2.9 million effort.
   ``The only money we've been allocated by the Department of
Defense for drug interdiction is to run a cooperative program with
the Customs Service,'' Komandosky said.
   Under that plan, some 90 to 100 volunteer, part-time guardsmen
would be dispatched beginning Thursday to four border points of
entry and the Port of Houston to help Customs inspectors search for
illegal drug shipments.
   Komandosky said he was ``positive'' the money would not be
financing the air or ground patrols, unless Gramm ``knows something
I don't know and that's entirely possible (that) I'm not aware of
any such animal.''
   Gramm said the air surveillance is effective in locating
clandestine landing strips used by drug smugglers, and the search
and seizure assistance provided by the guardsmen frees up Customs
workers ``to engage in more arrests.''

<HEAD>1987 Law Allows AIDS Victims to be Refused Entry to United States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

   A Dutch AIDS victim refused entry to the
United States at the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport was kept out of
the country because of a 1987 law passed by Congress, officials say.
   For years, immigration laws have required people who want to
visit or move here to establish that they do not have any
dangerous, contagious diseases.
   Congress added acquired immune deficiency syndrome to that list
of diseases in August 1987, and regulations preventing AIDS
patients from entering the country became effective that December,
said Joseph D. Cuddihy, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's senior immigration examiner in the examinations branch in
Washington.
   ``It's not just the INS,'' said Greg Leo of the INS. ``This is
something that's been a congressional matter.''
   Cuddihy said Tuesday that, ``A person has to establish
eligibility at the time of application (for a visa) overseas and
each and every time he enters the United States.''
   Immigration officials detained Hans Paul Verhoef, 31, of
Rotterdam, the Netherlands, at the airport after U.S. Customs
officials discovered the drug AZT in his baggage Sunday.
   He then told immigration officials that he has AIDS, and he was
taken to the Scott County Jail outside the Twin Cities area where
he was being held.
   Verhoef, an AIDS prevenon worker in his country, was en route
to San Francisco to participate as a delegate to the International
Caucus of the 7th National AIDS Forum and the 11th National Gay and
Gay Health Conference that begins Wednesday.
   Ten to 15 othr AIDS victims previously have been turned away
from this country, and an unknown number have been denied visas
their native country because they have the disy said.
   Visa applications specifically ask those who want t to the
United States whether they have any of the prohibited diseases, he
said. Those applying for permanent visas must undercal
examinations, but ``unless there is any reason to believe tson is ill,''
those who want simply temporary viaminations, he said.
   Not all foreign visitors are asked about their health when they
arrive in this country.
   Cuddihy  assumed that Verhoef was questioned about it
only because he ts he planned to attend the AIDS
conference in San Francisco and the discovery of the container of
AZT.
   The information provided by Verhoef as well as thegage he
had with him ``led to these particular tions in this particular
case,'' Cuddihy said.
   ``Every person is not asked specifically about all of the 33
grounds of exclusion and seven excludible diseases,'' he said,
adding that the diseases include tuberculosis and several sexually
transmitt
   ``If we tried to cover all the issues withyou can imagine what that
would do to a place liK and LAX,''
he said, referring to the airports in New York City and Los
Angeles. ``One of the grounds of exclusion is illiteracy, but we
never tell them to write their names.''
   Cuddihy said he believrhoef ``did not indicate that he
had AIDS'' when he applied for the visa in June 1988 for another
visit.
   We are not sure that he may or may not have had the HIV
infectin at that time, or he may not have been aware of ... what
it implied,'' he said. The INS is not questioning whether Verhoef
lihe obtained the visa, he said.

   Israel is setting aside $5,000 a month for
convicted spy and former U.S. Navy intelligence expert Jonathan J.
Pollard as a nest egg for when he is released from prison,
according to a new book.
   ``The Israeli government feels a humanitarian or moral
responsibility to Pollard,'' author Wolf Blitzer said in an
interview Tuesday night on ABC's ``Nightline'' show. ``Israel
recognizes that it was forced to nail him in the panic'' that
ensued after Pollard's arrest in 1985.
   Pollard's father, biochemist Morris Pollard of South Bend, Ind.,
said he was surprised to hear of the Israeli payments. His son, who
has been isolated from contact with the outside world at the
federal penitentiary in Marion, Ill., also did not know about the
Israeli payments, Morris Pollard said.
   In an earlier interview with The Associated Press, Blitzer, a
correspondent for the Jerusalem Post, predicted that Pollard will
be deported to Israel if he is paroled at the end of 1995.
   Pollard, 34, is serving a life sentence for selling Israel
thousands of secrets and the prosecutor who handled the case has
said he doubts that Pollard ``will ever see the light of day.'' But
he is technically eligible for parole after 10 years.
   In his book, ``Terrorism of Lies,'' Blitzer sets out to show
that ``at least one or two'' of Israel's senior leaders ``probably
knew'' that a senior intelligence operative named Rafi Eitan ``was
running a spy in Washington.
   ``They are simply too experienced in these kinds of matters not
to have known or suspected,'' Blitzer wrote.
   Among those leaders were then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, both with broad intelligence
experience, and then Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who was once
a senior operative of the Mossad spy agency.
   A copy of the book was made available Tuesday on the eve of an
official visit by Shamir, now Israel's prime minister, to
Washington. The book is to be published next month by Harper &amp; Row.
   Pollard's arrest here in November 1985 put a strain on
U.S.-Israeli relations and Israel has maintained er since that
its use of him was an unauthorized rogue operation.
   ``But even if they suspected that a spy was in place in
Washington, they almost certainly did not know his name was Pollard
... or any other specific details of the operation,'' Blitzer wrote.
   Blitzer, who has been covering the case since the day Pollard
shthe Israeli Embassy with his wife asking for asylum,
said an Isnvestigator into the affair compared Eitan's
decision to keep his bosses in the dark to the Reagan
administrat's Iran-Contra affair.
   The book surmises that Eitan and other Pollard handlers
``apparently assumed, arroglessly, that they would
not get caught.''
   Blitzer said in an interview that the book is based on thousands
of documents, s with Pollard in jail, and
dozens of interviews with his family and friends.
   ``Some parts will anger Israel, others will probably anger t
United States, and some will probably anger Pollard,'' Blitzerto be fair.''
   In a chapter titled ``The Cover-Up: Code Name `Siren,'' Blitzer
writes that Israel's governmt scrambled to disavow knowledgehe espionage
and give the appearance of full cooperation with
American investigators without cooperating to the full extent.
   He cites a decision to keep from the Americannd role
of Israeli Air Force Col. Aviem Sella, who recruited Polard in
1984 and was subsequently indicted here. ``The high-level decision
to cover up Sella's role was understandable but stupid,'' Blitzer
.
   To make sure the Americanvestigation team that went to Israel
would not learn about Sella or ask to interview him, Israeli
authorities spirited him outuntry to West Germany,
Blitzer te. They falsely dated his passport several days earlier
to make it appear he lft before the te
Blitzer.
   ``West Germany was selected because its customs officials do not
routinely stamp entry dates into visiting Israeli passports,''
Blitzer said.
   The author also said that former U.S. Defense Secretary Casper had
told U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson in a
clasemo that Pollard had sold Israel
documents thatould fill a small room.
   Among them, Blitzer said, were U.S. satellite photographs of the
Palestine Liberat Organization's headquarters in  building in October 1985,
a month before Pollard's
arrest, killing 60 people.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index climbed
slightly to yet another record high, and the U.S. dollar edged up
against the Japanese yen Wednesday after a four-day decline.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose by 48.54
points, or 0.15 percent, closing at 33,360.79. The previous record
high was 33,312.25 on Tuesday.
   The dollar closed at 131.37 yen, up 0.32 yen from Tuesday's
close of 131.05 yen. It opened at 131.33 yen and ranged between
131.20 yen and 131.58 yen.
   The dollar had fallen a total of 2.20 yen in the previous four
trading days.
   Dealers said improved prospects for stable exchange rates, as
reaffirmed in the meeting of finance ministers from the seven major
industrial countries, encouraged investors' buying activities, and
most shares moved higher from the start of the day's trading.
   ``Market sentiment is traditionally bullish in April as it is
the beginning of the new fiscal year for most (Japanese)
companies,'' said a dealer at a major securities firm who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``The favorable news on currency rates
makes the market doubly bullish.''
   He said shares in electronics and heavy-industry companies were
particularly in demand due to the favorable climate for stable
exchange rates.

   Hours after an intense firefight, the
only clues that life around this northern border village had been
disturbed were the hundreds of expended rifle shells lying on a
sandy road, shining in the sun.
   Police and black nationalist guerrillas waged a fierce battle
for several hours Monday night and early Tuesday along parts of the
25-mile road that connects Ombalantu to Tsandi, police said.
   But in the daylight, local residents casually rode their
bicycles past the shells casings, carried on with herding their
goats and drank beer in the local shops.
   The residents say they have grown accustomed to the fighting
after 23 years of war between the South African-led security forces
and the guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization.
   Like many people in the region, the villagers are SWAPO
supporters. Their loyalties are undoubtedly strengthened by the
fact that SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma comes from a nearby village.
   The residents said they heard shooting and saw flares until 3
a.m. Tuesday, and were worried renewed battles could catch their
village in the crossfire.
   Ombalantu has a police base, a few shops, some small farms and
not much else. The harsh, hot land is flat and sandy, covered with
low scrub bushes.
he numerous shell casings, from rifles used by the territorial
police force, gave some hints as to the intensitof the fighting.
It showed that the police stayed on the road for several miles
firing into the bush at guerrillas.
   Police Capt. Jumbo de Villiers said his men, many of whom are
members of the Himba tribe, have spent the last four days tracking
guerrillas in the bush.
   ``SWAPO (guerrillas) he best track disguisers in the
world,'' said de Villiers. ``But Himba are the best trackers.''
   According to de Villiers, a six-month cease-fire was broken
Saturday morn when nine policemen, tracking suspected cattle
thieves, were ambushed by SWAPO guerrillas.
   The guerrillas, with small armand grenades, killed three of
the policemen, de More than a dozen SWAPO fighters
were killed, he added.
   Sen, the police have staged their own surprises, de
Villiers sai Police trackers on Monday came across 40 guerrillas
bathing nesmall dam, he said.
   He did not give details of the fighting, saying only that ``a
contact was made.''
   SWAPO leaders say security forces broke the cease-fire.

<HEAD>USDA Delays Final Decisions on Inspection Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department's decision to hold
public hearings this summer on a plan to reduce the number of
federal inspectors at plants that turn out chicken soup, hot dogs
and other meat and poultry products has qualified approval from
both industry and consumer groups.
   The proposal was announced last November to carry out a 1986 law
that would be tougher on inspections of the most troublesome
processing plants but ease up on those with good records.
   One of the goals is to take advantage of computers and other
technology that could replace day-by-day surveillance by federal
inspectors.
   Periodic reviews would be held at the plants with good records,
and these operations would be expected to maintain a high level of
self-policing in order to retain USDA approval.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said Tuesday the agency will
postpone final decisions on some of the most controversial parts of
its ``improved processing inspection'' plan until after the
hearings.
   But Crawford said a final decision on certain criteria or
standards for implementing the ``risk-based'' system will be made
in the near future.
   There are more than 7,000 meat and poultry plants in the United
States, including about 6,300 that turn out products such as hot
dogs, beef stew, chicken soup, luncheon meats and scores of other
items. Only the processing plants would be covered by the
streamlined inspection system. It would not apply to slaughter
plants, which would remain under continuous federal inspection.
   Officials have estimated that the number of USDA inspectors at
the processing plants would be reduced by half by retirements and
resignations. The program would rely increasingly on ``good''
plants policing themselves.
   Crawford said his agency, FSIS, will maintain the inspection
work force at its current strength for the time being.
   Manly Molpus, president of the industry-supported American Meat
Institute, said the decision was ``a step in the right direction''
but that his organization and FSIS ``are still far apart in our
views of how improved processing inspection should be implemented.''
   Molpus said the announcement ``did not provide a clear fix'' on
how the agency should proceed and that ``we assume everything is on
the table for discussion over the next several months.''
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of a House subcommittee on
human resources and intergovernmental relations, said that a
subcommittee hearing on the streamlined inspection program will
proceed as scheduled Tuesday.
   Weiss, in a statement, said the USDA's announcement recognized
that ``this proposal is seriously flawed'' and that the department
``cannot justify reducing the frequency of inspections at this
time.''
   Tom Devine, legal director for the Government Accountability
Project, which was joined by the Consumer Nutrition Institute in
opposing the USDA proposal, called the department's announcement
``a tentative victory for common sense.''
   Devine, in a telephone interview, added: ``It means we can begin
the real public debate on how to change the inspection program
without a fait accompli. Once they cut the numbers of inspectors in
half, most of the options are gone, except an honor system.''
   Devine said the USDA announcement also ``raises the stakes for
the Weiss hearing'' next week.
   ``It means we don't have to wait for FSIS to schedule hearings
this summer to begin the public debate,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dingell Threatens Push for Federal Regulation of Medigap Policies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a House committee is
threatening to push for federal regulation of the supplemental
health insurance industry on grounds the states are doing an
inadequate job of protecting the elderly from exploitation.
   ``Preliminary reports from the General Accounting Office
indicate that many of the largest commercial insurers continue to
bilk elderly citizens by offering unlawful and unconscionably low
returns on premium payments,'' Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., wrote
to the national Association of Insurance Commissioners on Tuesday.
   ``This finding suggests the need for immediate action and raises
serious doubts about the effectiveness of the present regulatory
structure,'' said Dingell, head of the Committee on Energy and
Commerce.
   So-called Medigap policies are sold by private insurance
companies to supplement the coverage 32 million Americans have
under Medicare, the federal health program for the elderly and
disabled. Like other insurance, it historically has been regulated
by the states.
   But Dingell's letter to David Gates, president of the
Washington-based National Association of Insurance Commissioners,
suggested that might not remain a permanent arrangement.
   Gates, the Nevada state insurance commissioner, was traveling
when the letter was made public _ in advance of being made
available to the association _ and could not be reached for comment.
   ``We will respond to Mr. Dingell's letter when we receive a
copy,'' said Kevin Cronin, the organization's Washington counsel.
   Dingell said the Energy and Commerce oversight and
investigations subcommittee, which he also chairs, has scheduled a
hearing April 26 ``to further explore these issues in some detail
and to reveal the complete findings of our investigation.''
   Dingell closed his letter by informing Gates that he intends to
introduce legislation ``aimed at strengthening federal standards to
assure that all (Medicap) policies are vigorously regulated
irrespective of how or where they are sold, to require that
insurers meet reasonable loss ratios or return windfalls to policy
holders, and to combat sales abuses by offering appropriate
deterrents to those who insist on selling duplicative policies.''
   He said the GAO survey found that ``the majority of companies,
many with tens of millions of dollars in premiums, were found to
return less than 60 percent of premiums collected.''
   ``These windfall profits earned at the expense of the elderly
are particularly harmful given the rising health care expenses that
so many elderly people face,'' Dingell wrote.
   The overhead cost of Medicare is about 3 percent, meaning 97
cents of every dollar handled by the program goes to actual patient
benefits.

<HEAD>Congress Looks at Further Testing for Corn-based Carcinogen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress will determine whether testing for
aflatoxin in corn should be expanded and technology for detecting
the naturally occuring carcinogen be improved, says a Kansas
congressman.
   At a hearing Tuesday chaired by Rep. Dan Glickman, witnesses
said corn that is being exported is checked for aflatoxin, but the
federal government does not test grain that stays in the United
States. Aflatoxin is produced by molds that proliferate during
drought.
   Federal Grain Inspection Service Administrator W. Kirk Miller
said 75 percent, or 9.1 million metric tons, of the corn exported
this year has been tested and none had more than the 20 parts per
billion considered safe for human consumption.
   As for the domestic market, Miller said commercial corn buyers
do their own testing.
   ``Our industry considers aflatoxin to be a serious matter, and
places a great deal of emphasis on keeping it out of the food and
feed supply,'' Lyle Kuhlmann, president of Byron Elevator Co., in
Byron, Minn., told the subcommittee.
   Kuhlmann said grain elevator operators risk having their entire
elevator seized and condemned by state and federal officials if
they mix corn containing aflatoxin at levels above legal limits
with uncontaminated corn.
   But Glickman said after the hearing that Congress would decide
whether regulations should be strengthened. He said he was
concerned about corn grown by farmers who feed it to their milk
cows or beef cattle without ever testing it for the carcinogen.
   Scientists testifying before the panel had differing views on
the dangers of aflatoxin.
   Leonard Stoloff, who retired from the Food and Drug
Administration in 1982 after researching the substance for 19
years, said he did not believe it caused cancer in humans, though
there was evidence that it could cause some liver damage.
   Steven Tannenbaum, chemistry professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, disagreed with Stoloff, but said consumers
would be in danger of getting cancer only through a lifetime of
exposure to corn contaminated with excessive amounts of aflatoxin.
   ``A single bad year will not have the effect of having people
drop in the streets,'' he said.
   Aflatoxin has been linked to liver cancer in laboratory rats. It
is produced by two types of mold that abound on corn when there is
a drought.
   It was discovered in 1962 and can be detected in corn through
relatively simple testing, but requires skilled technicians and
special equipment. The results of certain tests take several weeks.
   Since the drought of 1988, the worst in 50 years, aflatoxin has
been found in corn grown in isolated areas of Iowa and Illinois.
Miller told the subcommittee that other major corn producing states
like Minnesota, Nebraska and Ohio, plus other parts of Iowa and
Illinois, were free of the problem.

<TEXT>
   Teamsters leader William J. McCarthy says he
has never had dealings with organized crime figures and told
Congress he knew of no current members of the union's governing
board with mob ties.
   ``If I get the facts, if I know what's going on, I will move,''
McCarthy said Tuesday in promising to root out any corruption that
came to his attention. ``It's not anywhere that I know of,'' he
said when asked whether the current international union leadership
was under mob influence.
   McCarthy testified at a Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations hearing to review the recent settlement of a
racketeering suit against the Teamsters, part of a larger committee
look at government efforts to battle union corruption.
   The suit sought the ouster of the Teamsters' entire 18-member
governing board, alleging the leadership was rife with mob
corruption, but the settlement allowed all current members of the
board to keep their jobs.
   Benito Romano, U.S. attorney for Manhattan, defended the
settlement as the quickest way to reform the union, telling the
hearing the agreement included election reforms that would end a
``sick joke'' system under which Teamsters leaders are now chosen.
   McCarthy, under questioning, denied an account by his immediate
predecessor, Jackie Presser, who told the FBI that McCarthy said he
would have to get approval from Mafia leaders before seeking the
union's No. 2 post in 1984.
   ``That's not so,'' McCarthy said before lashing out at Presser
and another former Teamsters president, Roy Williams.
   ``Both were mixed up with La Cosa Nostra by their own
admissions. I didn't care for either one of them,'' he said.
   McCarthy said it was Presser who in 1984 suggested McCarthy
would have to meet with Raymond L.S. Patriarca, the reputed New
England crime boss, if he wanted to be appointed secretary
treasurer of the union.
   ``I said, `No way,''' McCarthy said. ``I didn't talk to him nor
would I.''
   Patriarca died in 1984 and, according to law enforcement
officials, was suceeded by his son, Raymond ``Junior'' Patriarca.
McCarthy said he never has met or spoken to the younger Patriarca
and gave the same answer when asked if he ever had met or spoken to
a number of other reputed mob figures.
   McCarthy said the only pervasive mob corruption he was aware of
was in the Teamsters Central States division _ from which both
Presser and Williams rose through the union's ranks.
   Asked about an account that quoted him calling Presser a ``stool
pigeon,'' McCarthy said: ``It could be, yes sir. ... I call him a
crooked stool pigeon. He lies. That's why I gave him that name.''
   As part of the settlement, the union agreed to hold open
elections by secret ballots and to appoint three monitors with
broad powers to oversee union elections and management.
   Although the settlement, reached last month, took effect
immediately the Teamsters agreed to submit pertinent portions of it
to their next convention for ratification, a step designed to
prevent future challenges to the legality of amending the union's
constitution through a court agreement.
   McCarthy denied assertions made by a dissident Teamsters group
that during regional meetings last week he boasted that the union
could escape terms of the agreement by having delegates to the
convention vote against the amendments.
   McCarthy and Teamsters general counsel James T. Grady said they
were responding to questions when they said it was possible for the
union's delegates to reject the amendments. Grady said McCarthy
made it clear that if that happened the government had vowed to
reopen the case or seek other legal recourse.
   ``I'm going to do everything in my power to support them,''
McCarthy said when asked whether he would urge passage of the
amendments. ``My word is my bond.''

<HEAD>Survey: One Third of Workers Get Maternity Leave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unpaid maternity leave was available last year
to 33 percent of workers at companies with at least 100 employees,
according to a government survey of benefits that also found
intensified efforts to control health care costs.
   Nine in 10 workers at the medium and large companies surveyed
were offered some form of medical coverage and more of them are
choosing to enroll in health maintenance organizations and other
non-traditional plans, the Labor Department said Tuesday.
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics' annual benefits survey found
that 63 percent of workers in the firms with at least 100 employees
were covered by defined benefit pension plans, most commonly plans
which peg pension payments to a percentage of a worker's earnings
in the last few years before retirement.
   Ninety-two percent were provided some form of life insurance, 96
percent paid holidays, 98 percent paid vacations, 69 percent some
form of sick leave, 85 percent funeral leave and 91 percent jury
leave, the survey said.
   In all, the survey provided representative data for 31 million
full-time employees in the private sector _ up from 21 million
workers covered in prior surveys _ and for the first time addressed
parental leave, a subject likely to face considerable debate in the
current Congress.
   Unpaid maternity leave was available in benefit plans covering
33 percent of the employees and unpaid paternity leave under plans
for 16 percent of the workers. When offered, four months was the
average maximum length of both maternity and paternity leave,
according to the survey.
   Just 2 percent of employees had benefit plans which allowed paid
maternity leave and 1 percent were eligible for paid paternity
leave, the survey found.
   The health care section of the survey found expanded efforts to
lower benefits costs through use of HMOs, pre-admission
certification, mandatory second opinions before some treatments and
expanded coverage for home health care and extended care facilities.
   Alcohol and drug treatment were available in benefits plans
covering 80 percent and 74 percent of the workers.
   The survey showed that participation in HMOs and other
non-traditional health care programs nearly doubled between 1986
and 1988, from 14 percent to 26 percent. Of those employees, 19
percent were enrolled in HMOs and 7 percent in Preferred Provider
Organizations, under which subscribers are provided services at a
lower cost if they are treated by designated health care providers.
   Two-fifths of the workers were required to contribute toward the
cost of their medical coverage and three fifths toward the cost of
family coverage, with the average monthly employee contribution for
individual coverage being $19 and the average employee contribution
for family coverage being $60 a month, the survey found.

   Hunger and starvation will increase in poor
countries as the cost of importing food increases by more than $5
billion, according to the chief United Nations food official.
   Edouard Saouma, the director of the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization, said an expected rise in world grain
production would not be enough to replenish stocks and meet demand.
   In a confidential report on food shortages, the organization
listed 15 countries that need ``exceptional or emergency
assistance,'' The New York Times reported today. They are Angola,
Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Haiti, Jamaica, Laos, Lebanon, Mozambique,
Nicaragua, Peru, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sri Lanka, the Sudan and
Vietnam.
   The decline in world production has meant a fall in grain stocks
to about 16 percent of annual consumption and a rise in prices of
40 percent to 50 percent, Saouma said.
   He said that poor countries would have to increase spending on
imported food to $17.6 billion this year, from $12.3 billion in
1988, just to maintain the same level of nutrition.
   Saouma made his remarks to the Committee on World Food Security,
which monitors world food supplies and is meeting in Rome this week.

<HEAD>Highest Level in 18 Months</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Conventional mortgage interest rates rose in
March to their highest level since just before the 1987 stock
market crash, the government says.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the regulator of savings
institutions, said Tuesday the national average for conventional,
single-family loans jumped to 11.36 percent in early March, up from
11.11 percent in early February.
   It was the highest rate since early October 1987, when the
average hit 11.42 percent just before the stock market crash.
Interest rates began falling after the crash as the Federal Reserve
Board pumped money into the economy to guard against a recession.
   The bank board said rates for the most popular type of one-year
adjustable-rate mortgages, those with caps on how high the rate can
increase, also rose last month to 9.75 percent, up from 9.6 percent
in early February.
   It was the highest ARM rate since March 1986, when the average
was 9.84 percent, the bank board said.
   The Fed for a year now has been tightening credit and pushing
interest rates upward in an effort to restrain economic growth to
hold down inflation. Those efforts intensified in February after
the government reported there were sharp price increases at both
the wholesale and retail levels during January.
   ``The increases in the early March rates reflected the general
tightening in credit markets during February,'' said James Barth,
chief economist for the bank board.
   The percentage of mortgages closed with adjustable rates
declined to 55 percent in early March, down from 57 percent in
February, the board reported.
   A separate weekly report released Friday by the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp., known as Freddie Mac, showed interest rates
remained high throughout March.
   It said fixed-rate home mortgages were averaging 11.19 percent
last week, down slightly from a rate of 11.22 percent during the
previous week. On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were
asking an average initial rate of 9.31 percent last week, up from
9.3 percent the previous week.
   The Freddie Mac averages are lower than the bank board's because
they do not include add-on fees, known as points, which are paid by
borrowers.

   The Soviets have sold Libya at least a dozen
and as many as 15 fighter-bombers that are capable of striking
long-range targets in the Middle East, Pentagon sources say.
   The planes SU-24 Fencers, which can travel within an 800-mile
radius without refueling, have been broken into pieces, crated in
large boxes and delivered to the Libyans aboard Soviet Antonov-22
transport planes, the sources told The Associated Press on Tuesday.
   The price was not known, said the sources, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   The deliveries are infrequent and at irregular intervals, the
sources said. They added that the Fencers are likely to be based in
eastern Libya, possibly at Bumbah.
   In addition, the sources said, the Libyans also are seeking to
purchase equipment that could convert some of their existing large
transport planes to be used for aerial refueling, the sources said.
   Last year, Libya tried to buy extra refueling tanks and other
refueling gear that could be used aboard aging Boeing 707s that it
already owns, the sources said.
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that the Soviets
have also agreed to refit a Libyan transport plane, the
Soviet-built Ilyushin-76, so that it can be used as an aerial
refueling plane.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Activists in Contempt of Court for Release of FBI Memo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two civil rights activists and a lawyer were
found in contempt for releasing an FBI memo discrediting a witness
before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1956.
   ``I really hate to do this, but it's such a clear case I cannot
ignore it,'' U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima said Monday.
   The ruling stems from the case of Frank Wilkinson, a civil
rights activist and one of the last Americans to go to prison for
contempt of Congress during the McCarthy era for refusing to answer
questions posed by the committee.
   In February, Wilkinson filed a petition in federal court in
Atlanta asking that his conviction be overturned. He cited the FBI
memo.
   By releasing the memo, Tashima ruled Wilkinson and two others
violated a 1984 court order that protected many of the 132,000
documents involved in Wilkinson's 30-year battle with the FBI.
   In addition to Wilkinson, Paul Hoffman, legal director of the
Southern California American Civil Liberties Union, and attorney
Douglas Mirell, were found in civil contempt of a court order.
   They were ordered to pay attorney fees to the Justice
Department, which sought the ruling, and must accept responsibility
if the subject of the FBI memo sues for invasion of privacy.
   The FBI memo stated that the 1956 testimony of Anita Edith
Schneider, who branded Wilkinson a communist, was unreliable
because she ``exhibited emotional instability'' the previous year.
   Wilkinson, director emeritus of the National Committee Against
Repressive Legislation, was convicted in 1958 of contempt of
Congress for refusing to testify before the committee and was
imprisoned for nine months.
   Hoffman said he misunderstood the 1984 order. He argued during
the contempt proceedings that Ms. Schneider was a public figure.
   In the 1940s and '50s the House Committee on Un-American
Activities sought to find communists in the government, military
and elsewhere but fell into disrepute amid rising questions of the
constitutionality of its methods.

<HEAD>New Zealand Premier To Snub Bush On U.S. Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister David Lange will
not meet with Bush administration officials during his U.S. visit
this month because of cool relations caused by New Zealand's
anti-nuclear stand, officials said today.
   A spokesman for Lange's office said no official meetings had
been sought for the six-day visit that begins April 21.
   Relations between the two countries have been strained since the
government's 1983 ban on visits by ships capable of carrying
nuclear weapons. The ban led to the collapse of the ANZUS military
alliance of Australia, New Zeland and the United States.
   Opposition National Party leader Jim Bolger said Washington was
a glaring omission from Lange's itinerary, indicating the extent of
damage caused by the anti-nuclear stance.
   Lange is to deliver a foreign policy speech at Yale University,
where he is to be the Hendon Fellow of Berkeley College for 1989,
his spokesman said.
   He also is to attend an ANZAC Day service in New York and
address a luncheon of the Asia Society and the United States-New
Zealand Council. ANZAC is an acronym for the Australia-New Zealand
Army Corps that fought the disastrous campaign at Gallipoli in 1915.
   Former veterans mark the 74th anniversary of the World War I
battle on April 25.
   The announcement of Lange's visit follows Vice President Dan
Quayle's decision not to travel to New Zealand after a visit to
Australia next month.
   Lange has said he believes New Zealand has resolved its position
with the United States and the relationship will continue.
   ``We are disposed to be cooperative with great powers and small
powers but we will not do so at the cost of our nuclear policy,''
he said.

Gorbachev's speech Tuesday in Cuba, as translated into English by
official Radio Moscow:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On Fidel Castro and Cuba's recent history:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In the Soviet Union we know why the Cuban people rose to make
their revolution, what enabled them to repulse the armed
intervention, survive the economic blockade, cope with the
persistent and exhausting pressure of their imperialist neighbor.
The island of freedom was able to stand its ground thanks to its
proud and courageous people determined to fight for their
independence, for their right to live as they see fit. They were
able to do so because the revolution brought to the country's helm
a party committed to achieving lofty socialist ideals, ideals of
serving the people. And finally they were able to do this because
history had placed at their head one of the outstanding
revolutionaries of the 20th century, the legendary Comrade Fidel
Castro.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On Soviet-Cuban relations:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Our solidarity is not subject to fluctuations caused by the
considerations of the moment.
   Life does not mark time, time presents us with new requirements
and this applies particularly to economic links. They must be made
more dynamic, more effective, they must do more for both our
countries, our peoples. As for today, it is absolutely essential
that there be more strictness, discipline, so that undertakings
assumed be carried out in good time, and with proper standards.
   Today only those can count on success who are marching in step
with the times, who are drawing the necessary conclusions from the
changes resulting from the fact that the world has entered the era
of high technology, of intellectual labor, of the decisive role of
science. We are convinced that the potentialities included in
socialism are enormous, but they are not realized of their own
accord.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On internal Soviet politics:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Why is it that in outer space we perform miracles and in
everyday life we are unable to meet the most pressing demands? Why
is it that our progress has grown slower, and how has it happened
that in our society there are phenomena alien to socialism, social
corrosion, apathy, selfishness?
   Even the present state of reform has shown what a positive
charge is inherent in these changes. This is most important of all.
... There is maximalism among some people, among valuable proposals
there are some that are controversial, some that are unacceptable.
This is understandable. It is due to our lack of experience,
poltical culture, but all that will come. We see how people are
straightening out their shoulders, how their social stature is
growing, how they are learning to solve problems in conditions of
democratization and glasnost.
   We do not regard our approaches and solutions as some universal
prescription for all. On the contrary, problems may be similar but
each party solves them in its own way, guided by its own notions
and the specific features of its country. From these diverse
unstereotyped approaches there emerges the international experience
of socialism which is helping us all to move forward more rapidly.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>On foreign policy:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   As in the past the Soviet Union and Cuba have a common approach
to the key problems of international affairs. We are united in our
desire for a stable peace to avert the nuclear threat, to assert
the unconditional right of the nations to choosing their destiny,
to changing on a fair basis international economic relations.
   Of course the assertion of new thinking in the minds of the
world public is a complicated matter. Too strong are the traditions
and stereotypes and habits of the past. We see how hard it is to
digest for some of the Western leaders who time and again slip from
recognition of security to recurrency of the policy of strength, to
attempts to force their will on others.
   The most immediate task now is to solve so-called regional
conflicts. Analyzing their causes, it is easy to come to the
conclusion that they often emerge due to interference from the
outside and the striving to force order on others, that is attempts
to interfere with other people in their attempt to make their own
choice. We are resolutely against any theories and doctrines
justifying the export of revolution or counterrevolution, and all
forms of foreign interference in the affairs of sovereign nations.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Afghanistan:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The United States, too, has been inclined to continue meddling
in Afghan affairs. True, those who believed that the Republic of
Afghanistan would be dismembered the next day after the Soviet
troops were withdrawn have begun to recognize that they failed to
take a realistic view of the strength and possibilities of the
Afghan regime.
   We in the Soviet Union believe that the Afghan conflict and the
way of settling it is a touchstone for all states, for the entire
world community. There are other regional conflicts, other regional
knots that have to be untangled and it's very important to diplay
responsibility and a constructive approach.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Angola:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   It is of basic importance that not only Angola's independence
has been defended, there also have appeared feasible prospects of
finding an end to the infamous legacy of the colonial period, the
enslavement of Namibia whose people will now be able to set up an
independent state of their own and join the equal family of African
nations. This is going to be a major victory for justic and common
sense in international affairs.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>The Middle East:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   That region ... has been turned into a storage place of much
inflammable material, but not only in the figurative sense.
   It would be unpardonable light-mindedness to assume that such a
state of affairs could exist indefinitely in the future. Getting
the Middle East knot untangled is in the direct interest not only
of direct parties in the conflict, the Arab nations and Israel, but
also Europe, the United States and of course the Soviet Union and
other socialist countries. That is why we believed and believe
still that it is necessary to step up efforts in the interests of a
Middle East settlement.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Nicaragua:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Of course the normalization of situation in that country should
in many respects depend on the positions of the United States and
other nations in Central America. We believe that Washington still
clings to its position of strength in tackling the situation in
Central America. We cannot agree with Washington's statements that
give a wrong picture of our relations with Cuba and Nicaragua. We
are for a central, regional settlement of the conflict in Nicaragua
on the basis of a dialogue of all parties concerned without any
outside interference and ensuring the rights of each of the peoples
to self-determination.
   We cannot agree with statement of Vice President Quayle which
tends to view the situation in Central America as in the backyard
of the United States.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Latin America:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Favoring greater cooperation with the countries of Latin
America, the Soviet Union is not looking for any political or
military and strategic benefits in the Western Hemisphere. We
believe that continent, like all others, should not be an arena for
conflict between East and West.
   The Soviet Union has no and does not intend to have naval, air
force or missile bases in Latin America, or deploy nuclear or other
weapons of mass destruction there.

<HEAD>Art Students Stage Noisy Protest Over Theater Switch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERICH SMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arts students angrily protested being made
to play second fiddle to tenor Luciano Pavarotti, who needed their
stage for an opera because of a structural problem that has closed
the Academy of Music.
   About 200 students held a noisy demonstration Tuesday because
the University of the Arts is allowing Pavarotti to use its
Schubert Theater on nights that had been reserved for two student
productions.
   Demonstrators said they weren't told about the switch.
   ``We've been rehearsing for months, and then I had to hear on
the news about being put out of the theater,'' complained senior
Sharon Nordlinger, who is in the cast of ``Hamlet Machine.''
   Pavarotti and the Opera Company of Philadelphia needed a new
theater for the April 9 and 13 productions of Verdi's ``Luisa
Miller'' when the 132-year-old Academy of Music was closed on
Friday because of a cracked ceiling beam.
   After about five hours of chanting and dancing in front of the
university administration building, the demonstration broke up when
school President Peter Sohmssen came out to announce a settlement
negotiated with faculty and student leaders.
   Under the terms, the student productions will be rescheduled.
``Hamlet Machine'' will be staged April 15 and 16, and the
university's spring dance concert will be May 9 and 10.
   Sohmssen expressed satisfaction that the demonstration had been
about an issue related to their work and study, said university
spokesman Kirby Smith.
   ``He said in an ideal world, the students should have been
consulted, but this happened over the weekend, and he had to move
quickly,'' Smith said.
   The University of the Arts was established in 1987, through the
consolidation of two 100-year-old institutions, the Philadelphia
College of Art and the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts.
More than 1,450 full- and part-time students are enrolled in its
undergraduate and graduate programs.

<HEAD>Mass. Sues to Stop Job Corps from Mandatory AIDS Testing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state is suing the U.S. Labor Department and
its Job Corps program, charging the federal agency with illegally
requiring AIDS tests for applicants.
   In a complaint filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, state
Attorney General James Shannon accused the agency of violating
federal law by requiring Job Corps applicants to be tested for AIDS
antibodies and using positive test results to keep young people out
of a residential Job Corps program.
   Shannon was joined in the lawsuit by a woman identified as
``Jane Doe,'' who was described as a Massachusetts resident who was
removed from a Job Corps program on the basis of a positive AIDS
antibody test. She is represented by the Disability Law Center and
by the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders.
   The federal government did not reply immediately in court to
Shannon's complaint. Paul Williams, a spokesman for the Labor
Department in Washington, said the agency would not comment on
pending litigation.
   The complaint alleges at least six Massachusetts residents have
been excluded from Job Corps residential programs. The state
charges that the Job Corps policy discriminates against people who
have or are perceived as having a disability, in violation of
federal laws protecting the handicapped from discrimination.
   Shannon also charged that the policy violates the Administrative
Procedure Act because it was adopted without public notice or
hearings and that it violates privacy rights.
   ``This policy has a devastating impact on the lives of many
youths who are trying to better themselves. It is tragic that the
Job Corps is abandoning the young people it is intended to help,''
Shannon said.
   The Job Corps, a nationwide program within the Labor Department,
provides education and training to youths between ages 16 and 24
who need special assistance in preparing for work because of
disruptive home lives or cultural deprivation.
   About 700 young men and women are enrolled in the two
residential Job Corps programs in Massachusetts, in North Grafton
and in Chicopee.
   According to the complaint, Jane Doe is a 20-year-old high
school dropout who replied to a Job Corps TV advertisement last
August. She applied to the Grafton center for training in
word-processing and was accepted.
   On Aug. 30, Doe enrolled in the program. The next day, she
underwent a medical exam that included a test for exposure to AIDS,
without any advance counseling about the test or its significance.
   On Sept. 12, she was summoned from class and told that she had
tested positive, Shannon said. She was immediately dismissed from
the program, with ``virtually no meaningful counseling or
support,'' he said.
   Aides to Shannon said the Job Corps made minor changes in its
AIDS testing policy after a similar lawsuit was filed last year in
federal court in Washington, D.C.
   Shortly after the Bush administration took office in January,
Shannon said, Job Corps officials used an internal memorandum to
revise the policy, still requiring testing but evaluating results
on a case-by-case basis.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained against the Japanese yen in Tokyo
today following four days of decline, and the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's main index rose to another record high.
   After opening higher at 131.33 yen, the dollar edged up in
moderate trading, closing at 131.37 yen, up 0.32 yen from Tuesday's
finish. The U.S. currency ranged between 131.20 and 131.58 yen,
with volume estimated at $7.4 billion.
   ``Although the dollar weakened temporarily following a series of
central bank interventions in recent days, demand for the U.S.
currency is still quite strong,'' said Mitsuhiko Kinugasa of Daiwa
Bank.
   ``Because nothing has really changed in the basic economic
fundamentals, market participants, especially speculators, are
inclined to buy the dollar because of higher interest rates in the
United States,'' he said. Higher U.S. interest rates make the
dollar more attractive to investors.
   Traders said news reports today that Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita had received an additional $230,000 in funds from Recruit
Co., the firm at the heart of a widening stock-trading scandal, had
discouraged yen purchases.
   Recruit, an information conglomerate, sold hundreds of thousands
of bargain-priced shares in its real estate subsidiary,
Recruit-Cosmos Co., to influential government and business
officials prior to public trading. The recipients reaped large
profits when the share price soared in value after being listed on
the over-the-counter market.
   Fourteen people have been arrested and three Cabinet members
have resigned because of the scandal.
   Concern over political instability due to the scandal has
prompted yen selling in overseas and local currency markets,
traders said.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues rose 48.54 points, or 0.15 percent, closing at 33,360.79,
another record high.
   The index initially declined because of profit-taking, but then
rose because of buy orders from institutional and individual
investors near the end of trading, dealers said.
   Trading was heavy, with volume on the exchange's first section
estimated at 1.8 billion shares, compared to Tuesday's 1.7 billion.
   Among the issues which attracted participants were chemicals and
machineries.

   One year after he was removed from office for
misusing funds and obstructing justice, former Gov. Evan Mecham
vowed to run again in 1990 and lead a ``kinder and gentler
Arizona.''
   Mecham predicted at a rally Tuesday night he would regain the
governor's office. On Monday, he filed papers asking the
Legislature to reconsider the votes by which it impeached and
ousted him.
   ``I committed no impeachable offense,'' the maverick Republican
told an enthusiastic crowd of about 400 supporters.
   Legislative leaders said they doubted lawmakers would grant
Mecham a new impeachment trial and did not know how they could even
consider it because several incumbents were defeated in November's
elections.
   The 64-year-old former auto dealer has remained popular with a
sizable number of GOP voters in a state, where Republicans have an
edge in registration. But he generated controversy in office even
before his impeachment.
   Mecham was elected in 1986 on his fifth try for governor and
immediately came under fire for eliminating the state's Martin
Luther King Jr. holiday. Controversial appointments and statements
that offended blacks, Jews, Asians and others also ate away at his
popularity.
   Several prominent Republicans have urged him not to run again.
   Former House Speaker Joe Lane, one of the pro-impeachment
lawmakers ousted in November's elections, said he was ``terribly
distressed'' by Mecham's announcement.
   ``There'll be a terrible primary,'' he said. ``Democrats will be
organized and we'll have a bloody primary, and I just hate to see
that.''
   Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, the former secretary of state who
took over after Mecham's ouster, said she wasn't surprised by his
promise to run.
   ``I will match my record with his any time,'' Mofford said. ``I
will not stand by and let him or anyone else turn the clock back
socially, culturally, economically or any other way.''
   Mecham was impeached by the House on Feb. 5, 1988, on charges
that he misused state money for his auto dealership, tried to
thwart a state attorney general's investigation of a death threat
and concealed a $365,000 campaign loan.
   On April 4, 1988, the Senate convicted him of misusing funds by
a vote of 21-9, and of obstruction by 26-4. The Senate deferred the
third charge to Superior Court, where he was acquitted.
   Both chambers of the Legislature were controlled by the GOP.
   Mecham and his wife, Florence, arrived to a standing ovation
from the crowd at the rally. He criticized Mrs. Mofford, saying she
had raised taxes and abandoned his anti-drug, anti-pornography and
cost-cutting efforts.
   ``I want to send word out to everyone in Arizona that I think we
can have a kinder and gentler Arizona,'' said Mecham, echoing
George Bush's presidential campaign cry.
   ``I think the 19 months between now and the general election of
1990 can be a time of spirited debate on the issues but not
name-calling and not accusations without basis.''
   Lawyers are uncertain whether the impeachment process simply
stripped Mecham of his office or also permanently barred him from
any state office. Republican state Attorney General Bob Corbin has
been asked for an advisory opinion but noted that whatever he says
can be challenged in court.
   If the Legislature doesn't review the impeachment, ``we have
every intention of taking it to the highest court in Arizona and,
if need be, to the U.S. Supreme Court,'' Mecham attorney Donald
MacPherson told the rally, bringing the crowd to its feet.

<TEXT>
   The eighth victim of a bridge collapse
was pulled from the rain-swollen Hatchie River after a specially
trained dog led searchers to a submerged station wagon.
   Authorities said they don't believe anyone else died but would
continue to search the waters where an 84-foot section of the
two-lane bridge collapsed Saturday night. Five vehicles, including
a tractor-trailer rig, toppled into the river.
   ``We have not had anymore missing person reports that have been
confirmed so we feel like that's all, but we want to be sure,''
said Fire Chief Jerry Craig.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner was to inspect the
bridge today, along with Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., and Rep. John
Tanner, D-Tenn.
   The cause of the bridge collapse has not been determined, but
officials said high water for the past couple of months may have
undercut one of the bridge supports. The 55-year-old bridge carries
the northbound lanes of U.S. Highway 51 over the Hatchie River,
about 50 miles north of Memphis.
   Seven bodies were recovered Saturday and Sunday, but the eighth
was not found until Tuesday when divers located the station wagon
partly buried in the riverbank under 15 feet of water. The spot had
been picked out on Monday by a dog trained to smell bodies buried
in rubble or under water.
   The latest victim was identified as Adrian Jones, 26, of nearby
Ripley. He was known to have been driving on the highway about the
time of the collapse, and his relatives had kept a riverside vigil
through much of the search.
   After the station wagon was hauled out, workers used a crane to
begin removing huge chunks of concrete lying on the other vehicles.
Three 28-foot sections of highway weighing 75 to 100 tons each
plunged into the river when the bridge gave way.
   The bridge passed a state inspection in 1987. A companion
two-lane southbound bridge was closed and inspected after the
collapse, and authorities said it would probably reopen as a
two-way bridge Thursday.

   A self-taught computer wizard is

assumes the answer is yes and moves on to the next person. If
there's no answer or the telephone is busy, the computer repeats
the call.
   But if there's no answer a second or third time, the computer
designed by Bruce Johnson sounds an alert to law enforcement
officials who dispatch a squad car to see if anyone is in danger.
   ``It's a good deal all the way through,'' said Clyde Ritter, 73,
of rural Osage, Iowa. ``They say it saved my life.''
   Ritter had gone into a diabetic coma one morning in August at
his home five miles northwest of Osage.
   The town's ``Are You O.K.?'' computer at police headquarters
alerted authorities that Ritter failed to answer a second call, and
a deputy sheriff was sent to the home. He found Ritter comatose and
summoned an ambulance.
   ``I guess I credit the system for saving at least one life,''
said Osage Police Officer Michael DeKruif. ``We've had tremendous
success with it.''
   Besides Ritter's rescue, the system has alerted Osage police to
an elderly man whose hands were caught in a window _ trapping him
inside his own home _ and to three elderly people who had fallen in
their homes and needed police to help them.
   ``I haven't seen anything like it,'' said Retha Jefferson, a
police department desk officer in Belhaven, N.C. ``It's just that
officers respond to calls all the time of neighbors not seeing
their neighbors for two or three days and then it's too late.''
   Jefferson, who manually calls about 45 elderly people each day
to check on them, said Belhaven is raising $7,000 to buy a system.
   The 41-year-old Johnson said he developed the program about a
year ago for Osage ``more or less as a public service'' while he
was living in nearby Austin, Minn. Johnson had video stores in
Austin and Osage and was considered a computer guru by friends.
   Members of the police department had heard of a computer dialing
system in Carthage, Mo., and they wanted Johnson to improve on it.
   ``I foolishly told the city, `I'll write it for you,''' Johnson
said. ``It took me 14 months.''
   Thanks to publicity in law enforcement journals, the project has
blossomed into a full-time business for Johnson, a former Army and
National Guard officer.
   Only Osage, Charles City, Iowa, and Sutherlin, Ore., are on line
with the system, but inquiries and purchase orders have been
pouring in from all over.
   ``We had a call from Scotland Yard on it,'' said Robert O'Keefe,
the only other officer in Johnson's home-based company, Northland
Innovations.
   ``The whole thing has caught me off guard,'' Johnson said.
``Maybe I'm achieving the American dream by accident, but that's
OK.''
   Johnson, a two-time University of Minnesota dropout who has
lived in Brazil, Germany and the Bronx, started to teach himself
about computers in 1982 when he was bedridden for six months with a
back injury.
   He said ``Are You O.K.?'' programs are flexible and easy to
operate. The service is free to the residents where a system is
based.
   Participation is voluntary, but police departments emphasize the
importance of avoiding false alarms. Participants are asked to be
in their homes and off the telephone at the same time each day to
answer the call. They are required to report in advance when they
will not be home so the information can be stored in the computer
in time to avert a call.
   ``My goal for `Are You O.K.?' is to see one in every city in the
U.S.,'' Johnson said.

<HEAD>Anti-Cancer Chemicals In Cheeseburgers No Excuse For Pigging Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>IRVINE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scientist found cancer-fighting fatty
chemicals in cheese and grilled ground beef, but says it's no
excuse for people to go stuff themselves on cheeseburgers.
   ``People should be reassured to know there are things in food
that prevent cancer,'' said microbiologist Michael Pariza, who
conducted the research as director of the University of Wisconsin's
food safety research institute.
   But saturated fats and cholesterol also found in beef and cheese
have been linked previously to heart disease and some cancers.
   So ``we're certainly not suggesting that people go out and chow
down on cheese and hamburgers,'' Pariza said Tuesday during the
American Cancer Society's science writers' seminar.
   He said fears of cancer-causing substances in food were
aggravated by recent reports of Alar in apples and aflatoxin in
grain, as well as a 1986 Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
study that found well-done fried and broiled hamburgers contain
chemicals that cause cancer and mutations in rodents.
   Pariza said his findings show that ``in many foods there are
good substances that may counteract the effect of bad substances.
That's why it's a good idea to eat a balanced diet.''
   His study found varying amounts of the cancer-inhibiting fatty
acids _ called CLA, or conjugated linoleic acids _ in hamburger and
natural and processed cheeses. Highest levels were in Cheese Whiz
sandwich spread, followed by grilled hamburger.
   Pariza, worried about public reaction to his study, said that
two men whose wives are dying of cancer called him and ``wanted to
know if their wives should eat more Cheese Whiz.'' He told them no.
   American Heart Association spokesman Howard Lewis also expressed
concern people might overinterpret the research by eating too much
cheese and meat.
   To prevent heart disease, the group recommends a balanced diet
of fresh fruit and vegetables and foods low in cholesterol and
saturated fat. Those include low-fat cheeses and lean meat trimmed
of excess fat, Lewis said by phone from Dallas.
   ``If you eat a high-fiber, low-fat diet, the health benefits far
outweigh the benefits of any CLA you can get through eating a lot
of beef and cheese,'' said Dr. Vincent DeVita Jr., former National
Cancer Institute director.
   Pariza said the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board paid about
one-third of his laboratory's costs, but only for the last two
years of the 10-year research effort. The cancer institute provided
most of the funds, he said.
   Dr. John Laszlo, the cancer society's senior vice president,
defended the quality of Pariza's research. He said it raises the
possibility that CLA someday might be given to people to help
prevent cancer. Pariza emphasized much more research is needed to
learn if that would work.
   Pariza's discovery that CLA in hamburger can inhibit cancer
``illustrates what an oversimplification it is to make
pronouncements about diet and cancer,'' Laszlo added.
   At the time of the 1986 report that hamburger contains chemicals
that cause cancer in mice, scientists said the risk to humans was
unknown. But as a precaution they recommended against cooking meat
well-done.
   Pariza's early studies also found carcinogens in cooked meat,
but a few years ago he found a crude extract from grilled hamburger
that was able to inhibit skin cancer in mice exposed to a potent
cancer-causing chemical.
   In his latest research, he purified and identified CLA in
extracts of cheeses and grilled hamburger.
   One group of mice was given CLA and a second group received none
of the substance. All the mice were later fed a strong doses of a
cancer-causing chemical.
   This was repeated weekly for four weeks, and the mice were
killed after 20 weeks. Mice that received CLA and the carcinogen
averaged two tumors in the forestomach, compared with five tumors
in mice that got only the carcinogen.
   CLA has been known for 50 years, and occurs naturally in human
blood and mother's milk and in most animal products, Pariza said,
adding that his research revealed its cancer-fighting properties.
   He theorizes CLA inhibits cancer by blocking damage to
chromosomes, or basic hereditary information in all cells, caused
by chemicals called oxygen free radicals.
   Previous research found cancer-inhibiting chemicals in carrots,
broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, beans, nuts and certain
other foods.

<HEAD>Big Shoes To Fill, But Daley Says He's His Own Man</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard M. Daley has legendary shoes to fill, but
says he will stride into City Hall on his own two feet.
   Flush with victory Tuesday and preparing to occupy the mayor's
office held 21 years by his father, the late Richard J. Daley, he
said, ``Throughout this campaign I've been asked about my father
and what I learned from him. He taught me to love this city.
   ``He taught me that public service is not just a job,'' he
continued. ``Public service is a high calling.''
   Throughout a political career that had its beginnings nearly 30
years ago, the Daley name made many of his achievements possible,
diminished others, and left him forever open to the charge that his
vision extends only as far as his father's shadow.
   ``Both my father and Mayor (Harold) Washington loved this city
and both were strong mayors,'' Daley said. But people running for
mayor ``should stand on their own two feet.''
   He lived at home until he was 30, and now, at age 46, still
lives only a few blocks from the bungalow where he grew up in the
working-class Bridgeport neighborhood. He looks, walks, talks, and
occasionally misspeaks in a way that makes it obvious he is an heir
of the last of the big-city bosses.
   And that is what scares his critics most. During the campaign,
black rival Timothy Evans labeled Daley a ``pharoah'' and said his
election would revive the once-vaunted political machine his father
built on patronage and used to control City Hall.
   ``We will likely return to plantation politics,'' said Lu
Palmer, a black activist and radio personality.
   Daley, who friends and colleagues say began to emerge from his
father's shadow after the elder Daley's death in 1976, is sensitive
to the charge.
   ``The people of Chicago want to move forward, not back,'' he
said, ``they want a government that is fair and open and
representative of every community and so do I.''
   But he does not entirely shy away from his legacy.
   ``I think the best lesson my father taught me had nothing to do
with politics or government,'' he said Tuesday night as supporters
roared. ``It had to do with my family. And I want to thank my
family for their support in bad times and in good times.''
   And Daley recalled that he and wife, Maggie, never needed
support more than when the family lost Kevin, the third of their
four children, to the crippling disease spina bifida at age 2.
   After he spoke, Daley hoisted his 5-year-old daughter,
Elizabeth, to his shoulder as his wife, daughter Nora, 15, and son,
Patrick, 13, beamed.
   The eldest of seven children, Richard M. Daley cut his political
teeth working as an 18-year-old page for the Illinois delegation to
the 1960 Democratic National Convention.
   He graduated law school in 1968 and his father rewarded him with
a job as an assistant city attorney after he passed the bar exam on
his third try. He handily won a seat in the 1969 Illinois
Constitutional Convention.
   In 1972, a machine Democrat was pulled from the Illinois Senate
to make room for young Daley.
   He was criticized by some colleagues early on as his father's
``eyes and ears,'' and he helped block reformist legislation.
   But he later forged cautious alliances with the same reformers
who often had opposed his father.
   As a result, when he ran for the first of his three terms as
Cook County state's attorney in 1980, Democrats slated Alderman
Edward Burke to run against him. The younger Daley clobbered Burke,
then twice won re-election.
   The combination of an old name and a new face proved a winner
again Tuesday.
   ``It shows Americans love sequels,'' said Eugene Kennedy, a
Loyola University professor and author of ``Himself,'' a biography
of the elder Daley.

   The U.S. dollar was firmer in early European
trading today, supported by plenty of commercial demand. Gold
prices fell.
   Foreign currency dealers said they think the currency has
entered a consolidation phase that is likely to last until Friday's
release of U.S. unemployment figures.
   Traders said they are optimistic about the dollar's strength,
but believe continued fear of central bank intervention and
lingering effects of statements made at last weekend's meeting of
the Group of Seven major industrialized nations would serve as an
effective cap on any sharp movement higher.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.32 yen to a closing 131.37. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 131.53 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.8741 West German marks, up from 1.8670
   _1.6435 Swiss francs, up from 1.6358
   _6.3260 French francs, up from 6.3100

   _1,374.50 Italian lire, up from 1,372.75
   _1.1895 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1875
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6987, cheaper for buyers
than $1.7043 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $384.90 a troy ounce,
down from $386.75 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $384.40.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $384.20, down from $386.50 bid late
Tuesday.
   All financial institutions in Hong Kong were closed today for
the Chinese Ching Ming grave-sweeping holiday.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.80 a troy
ounce, down from Tuesday's $5.84.

<HEAD>Daley Wins in Chicago; Dems Keep Alabama House Seat</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Chicago Mayoral, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard M. Daley captured the office his father held for 21
years, and Alabama Democrats held on to a House seat in a special
election that could signal a rough road for Republicans hoping for
big gains in the South in 1990.
   In other elections Tuesday, residents of Winnetka, Ill.,
approved a non-binding handgun ban prompted by a deadly shooting
spree at an elementary school there last May.
   Omaha's former mayor, Michael Boyle, ousted in a 1987 recall,
made a successful comeback bid in a primary; Joseph Sensenbrenner,
the three-term incumbent mayor of Madison, Wis., lost to Paul
Soglin, a former three-term mayor; St. Louis' Democratic Mayor
Vincent C. Schoemehl Jr. won easy re-election; and Wichita, Kan.,
elected its first mayor in 74 years.
   In Alabama's 3rd Congressional District, Secretary of State Glen
Browder, a Democrat, swept all 13 counties despite Republican John
Rice's attempt to brand him a liberal in a mostly conservative
region. Browder claims the seat left vacant by the death of
Democratic Rep. Bill Nichols in December.
   Browder had 47,229 votes, or 65 percent, to Rice's 25,008, or 35
percent.
   Browder, 46, adopted a get-tough strategy to counter Rice's
liberal-bashing. Rice, 37, a real estate developer, had labeled
Browder a liberal, a liar and a ``wimp.''
   The race was one of three special congressional elections this
spring. In Indiana last week, Democrat Jill Long defeated
Republican Dan Heath to fill a vacant seat whose previous two
occupants were Republicans, including Vice President Dan Quayle.
Voters in Wyoming will choose a successor to Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney on April 26.
   In Chicago, the 46-year-old son of the late Mayor Richard J.
Daley defeated Alderman Timothy Evans, a black who ran as an
independent and had claimed the mantle of the late Harold
Washington, the city's first black mayor.
   Former alderman Edward Vrydolyak, who won the Republican primary
as a write-in, lagged far behind.
   ``We were determined to prove to a doubting world that Chicago
has grown beyond the politics of division and name calling,'' Daley
said as supporters in a hotel ballroom roared their approval.
   The Democratic Cook County prosecutor captured overwhelming
white support in the Democratic primary in February to oust the
city's second black mayor, Eugene Sawyer.
   Race remained the underlying issue in Chicago, where elections
tend to divide voters by color more than party, but in his victory
speech, Daley reached out to blacks.
   ``The late Mayor Washington opened city government to many
citizens who felt excluded and ignored,'' he said. ``As long as I
am mayor, those doors will remain open to all citizens.''
   In other mayoral races, St. Louis' Schoemehl won a third
four-year term by defeating Republican challenger Bernard J. Elking.
   In Wichita, where residents decided last November to make the
post an elective position, longtime City Councilman Bob Knight
defeated businessman John Bell. In recent years, council members
had elected a largely ceremonial mayor from among themselves.
   In Omaha, where Boyle had been ousted after feuding with the
police chief, the former mayor was the top vote-getter in a
non-partisan primary that trimmed a field of seven candidates to
two for May 9's general election. He will face real estate manager
P.J. Morgan, who slipped by incumbent Mayor Walt Calinger to
capture the other runoff spot.
   In Topeka, Kan., incumbent Mayor Douglas S. Wright was defeated
by former Parks Commissioner Harry Felker III.
   In Northmoor, Mo., just outside Kansas City, one acknowledged
member of the Ku Klux Klan and two men identified as a Klan
sympathizers lost bids for seats on the Board of Aldermen and as
town marshal.
   And in Winnetka, Ill., voters approved the handgun ban in their
Chicago suburb where a woman carrying three guns shot to death a
young boy and wounded several others before killing herself last
May.

<HEAD>Court OKs Trial For DES Lawsuits Filed Under `Toxic Tort' Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL STASHENKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York's highest court has cleared the way
to try billions of dollars in lawsuits over the anti-miscarriage
drug DES, and a lawyer said a long legal fight was just beginning.
   ``We have a long ways to go,'' said New York City attorney Paul
Rheingold, who represents several women who claim they were harmed
by the drug in their mother's womb. ``But at least the way's been
cleared for the 500 women who've filed suits to have their day in
court.''
   The Court of Appeals on Tuesday unanimously upheld the state's
toxic tort law, under which the women filed their lawsuits. The
court also ruled that all companies that made DES for use by
pregnant women should be liable for a percentage of any damage
awards won by New Yorkers _ even companies that never marketed
their pills in the state.
   The ruling, written by Chief Judge Sol Wachtler, drew praise
from women who claim they were harmed by the DES their mothers took
between the late 1940s and early 1970s.
   But Jay Mayesh, a lawyer for Upjohn, one of the major drug
manufacturers involved in the suits, cautioned that the justices
addressed only procedural issues.
   ``They do not address the fundamental question of whether DES
caused any of the health problems the plaintiffs claim it did. That
issue remains very hotly contested,'' he said.
   Mayesh said drug company attorneys, from their experiences in
other state courts, have become very good at showing that DES may
not be responsible for the maladies blamed on it.
   The drug has been cited for allegedly causing a range of serious
health problems in the offspring of women who took it, including
cancer, miscarriages and sterility.
   In virtually every case, victims were barred from suing because
their health problems didn't appear until years after the statute
of limitations had expired.
   The toxic tort statute opened a one-year period for people to
file suits for damages they claim were caused by exposure to one of
five substances, including diethylstilbestrol, or DES. The other
substances named in the law are asbestos, tungsten-carbide,
chlordane and polyvinylchloride.
   More than 500 DES suits seeking some $3 billion in damages were
filed between July 1986 and July 1987 under the statute.
   In Wachtler's ruling, the Court of Appeals rejected contentions
made by drug companies that the toxic tort statute violated their
constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. The
companies had claimed the law unfairly singled out just five
substances.
   A stickier legal question for the court, apparently, was how to
determine which drug companies were responsible for damages and how
much they should pay.
   The court decided unanimously that a ``market share theory,''
similar to one first formulated by California's top court, would be
adopted in New York for apportioning damages from the DES
litigation.
   That means drug companies will be liable for the percentage of
damages in New York court cases corresponding to the percentage of
the national DES market they controlled while manufacturing the
drug.

   Thunderstorms continued to strike much of the Southeast today
after dropping dime-size hail in Mississippi and generated high
winds that downed power lines and damaged businesses in Alabama.
   The thunderstorms developing ahead of a slow moving cold front
brought heavy rains from the central Gulf Coast to Georgia and
South Carolina.
   Heavier rainfall for the six hours ended at 2 a.m. EDT included
nearly 2 inches at Montgomery, Ala., 1{ inches at Biloxi, Miss.,
and 1\ inches at Atlanta.
   Showers were scattered across the Great Lakes and the middle and
northern Atlantic Coast states. Showers also were scattered from
Washington state to western Montana.
   Fair skies prevailed in the Great Plains region and the
Southwest.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms across the
East Coast; rain over the Appalachians, the upper Ohio Valley and
the lower Great Lakes; snow over northern Michigan; rain likely
across Washington state and northern Oregon; and scattered showers
over North Dakota, the northern and central Rockies and Idaho.
   Highs were expected to be in the 30s in northern Michigan; in
the 40s from North Dakota across the upper Mississippi Valley and
the Great Lakes to portions of the Ohio Valley; in the 70s and 80s
over the southern Atlantic Coast states, along the Gulf Coast and
across much of Texas to the Southwest; in the 90s to around 100
from the southern Arizona desert to the Southern California coast;
and the 50s and 60s elsewhere.

   Police said they were getting ready to
pursue the fugitive captain of the oil tanker Exxon Valdez after
waiting in vain a second day for the skipper to surrender.
   The family of Joseph Hazelwood said he wanted to turn himself in
to face charges of operating the vessel while drunk but was
awaiting advice from his lawyer, said Lt. Thomas Fazio, commander
of the New York State Police on New York's Long Island.
   ``Right now if we see him on the streets, we will lock him up,''
Fazio said Tuesday. ``We are anxious to bring him into custody.''
   A lawyer representing Hazelwood had ``continued limited
discussions'' with Suffolk County District Attorney Patrick Henry
on Tuesday, said John Williams, a spokesman for Henry.
   Hazelwood faces three misdemeanor charges in Alaska stemming
from the March 24 grounding of the Valdez, which spilled more than
10 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound. Exxon fired
the 20-year veteran last week.
   A source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
42-year-old skipper left Anchorage, Alaska, March 28 on a flight
bound for New York. He lives in Huntington, on Long Island.
   The captain's parents, Joseph and Margaret Hazelwood also of
Huntington told police they do not know where their son is.
   ``We talked to his parents,'' Fazio said. ``They told us
something will probably be happening soon. But they said it was up
to the attorney to decide when and where.''
   If Hazelwood doesn't surrender within the next two days police
will actively pursue him, Fazio said.
   Hazelwood is charged with operating a ship while under the
influence of alcohol, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge
of oil. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 2\ years in prison
and a $10,000 fine.

<HEAD>U.S Accused of Siting Radar to Monitor Nicarauga Instead of Drug
Trafficking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Colombian government has accused the Defense
Department of using the fight against drugs as a ruse for
installing a radar system on an island to monitor activities in
Nicarauga, a newspaper reported today.
   The Defense Department's insistence on placing the radar on
Colombia's San Andres Island in the Caribbean rather that on its
southern border has hurt attempts to curtail drug operations in
that country, an aide to Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., told The
Boston Globe.
   Richard McCall, Kerry's foreign affairs aide, said Colombia
proposed putting the radar near its border with Brazil to monitor
flights coming into the country from Bolivia, Ecuador and Brazil _
major sources for the raw materials and chemicals used to process
cocaine in Colombia.
   Pentagon officials told the Colombian government they wanted the
radar on San Andres to monitor the export of the finished product.
The Colombians countered that radar there would be of little help
since planes could take many different routes from Colombia, the
newspaper said.
   ``The only utility for that radar was to monitor Nicaragua,''
McCall said.
   San Andres is 200 miles off the Nicaraugan coast, but some 500
miles from Colombia.
   The newspaper said a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee was
scheduled to take up the radar location issue today.
   The Globe reported that a Defense Department spokesman, Maj.
Michael Stepp, said Tuesday night that the Pentagon had signed an
agreement in February to place radar on San Andres and on
Colombia's northern coast.
   But the Colombian Embassy in Washington insisted no agreement
exists, and negotiations over the radar's placement is continuing.

<HEAD>Reports Say Stock Scandal Company Contributed Thousands To Takeshita</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The company at the center of a stock scandal that
has shaken the government to its core contributed more than
$380,000 to fund-raising parties for Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita, news reports said today.
   Takeshita had disclosed last Friday that Recruit Co. spent
$152,700 on a fund-raising party for him in May 1987, when he was a
leading contender for leadership of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party and the prime minister's post.
   The nationwide newspaper Asahi Shimbun and other newspapers
reported today that Takeshita received another $229,000 from
Recruit at another fund-raising party that month.
   Asked by reporters about the reports, Takeshita said: ``I can't
comment on the matter because I do not have detailed information.
It is difficult to confirm it quickly.''
   An aide to Takeshita, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed that Recruit had bought tickets to the second party, but
said ``our office did not directly handle the party, so we do not
know the amount.''
   Recruit, an information services conglomerate, sold
bargain-priced unlisted shares in a subsidiary to about 150
influential politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen, who profited
handsomely when public trading in the stocks began.
   So far, 14 bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested on
bribery or securities law violation charges in connection with the
deals. Three Cabinet ministers have resigned because of links to
the scandal.
   The leaders of four major opposition parties planned to meet
Friday in Kyoto, in western Japan, to discuss forming a coalition
government in hopes Takeshita could be forced to step down.
Meanwhile, lower-level opposition meetings were discussing strategy.
   ``The Takeshita Cabinet is no longer entitled to run the
government,'' Japan Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako Doi told
reporters Tuesday. ``The only alternative left for the government
is to resign en masse and accept the people's judgment.''
   Takeshita has refused to resign, despite public opinion polls
showing approval ratings as low as 9 percent for his government. He
has vowed instead to reform politics and regain public trust.
   Japanese politicians customarily use fund-raising parties to
sidestep legal restrictions on political donations and solicit
funds from business leaders and supporters.
   Large corporations often buy large blocks of party tickets, but
Takeshita acknowledged last week that the $152,700 purchase by
Recruit disclosed then was ``slightly excessive'' for one company.
   There is no legal limit on the amount of money politicians can
raise from such parties. The parties are considered legal ``as long
as the price of each ticket is within the range of common sense and
the number of tickets purchased is within a reasonable limit of
what a company can possibly use,'' said an official at the Home
Affairs Ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The opposition has stalled legislative business but cannot force
Takeshita out. The Liberal Democrats hold 297 of the 512 seats in
parliament's lower house, and 143 of the 252 in the upper house.
   At least 17 politicians, including Takeshita and former Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, have been implicated in the scandal,
although none has been arrested.
   Prosecutors reportedly have begun questioning politicians and
their aides.

   A reporter who helped break the story
that dashed Gary Hart's presidential hopes has found that just like
politics, the lecture circuit makes strange bedfellows.
   ``I never would have guessed that I would sleep in the same bed
that Gary Hart slept in,'' Jim McGee told an audience at West
Virginia University's Mountainlair student union Tuesday.
   The school invited the former Miami Herald reporter to speak.
Afterward, McGee was lodged in the same university suite where Hart
stayed when he spoke at the school in 1987, shortly after news of
his relationship with model Donna Rice forced him to drop out of
the presidential race.
   McGee helped stake out Hart's Washington townhouse after the
former Colorado senator denied rumors he was having an extramarital
affair.
   ``For us, it was always a story about telling the truth. It
didn't start out as a story about private lives or sex lives or
anything like that,'' said McGee, who now works for The Washington
Post.

<TEXT>
   Basque separatists have ended a
three-month truce and will renew their campaign of violence, a
Basque newspaper said.
   The Basque group ETA ceased its attacks Jan. 8 in return for
talks with the government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez. The group is seeking greater autonomy for the
three-province Basque region in northern Spain.
   On Tuesday, the radical Basque daily Egin said it received an
announcement from ETA blaming the government for forcing it to call
off its ``unilateral cease-fire.'' ETA said the government had
``not maintained its commitments'' to agreements reached during
talks held in Algiers on March 22.
   ETA maintains these agreements include the start of new talks
and the inclusion in the talks of three jailed ETA members and
Basque sympathizers.
   But the group repeated its willingness to resume negotiations if
the government respects agreements already reached, the newspaper
reported.
   For the first time since 1968, when ETA began its campaign of
violence, there have been no deaths from attacks this year. More
than 600 people have been slain during the 21-year-old insurgency.

<TEXT>
   A woman charged with breaking into the
home of talk show host David Letterman was sent from prison to a
state hospital by a judge who found her incompetent to stand trial.
   Margaret Ray, who claims to be Letterman's wife, understands the
charges against her but is not capable of assisting in her defense,
Superior Court Judge Harold H. Dean ruled Tuesday.
   Interrupting testimony, Ray said, ``I wanted to plead guilty,
but I wasn't given any credibility for that stance.''
   Ray, 36, was transferred from a prison where she has been held
on $5,000 bond since her arrest in February to state-run Fairfield
Hills Hospital in Newtown.
   The judge ordered the hospital staff to report on Ray's
condition every 90 days. If she is not found competent to stand
trial within 18 months she could be committed to a psychiatric
hospital, Assistant State's Attorney Robert G. Hall Jr. said.
   Ray was charged with break-ins at Letterman's New Canaan home on
Feb. 24 and 28. A psychiatrist found her competent to stand trial,
but her attorney requested review by a three-member panel, whose
report led to Tuesday's ruling.
   A judge previously found Ray incompetent to stand trial last
June after authorities found her driving Letterman's Porsche.
   Mark W. Ford, Letterman's attorney, attended the hearing
Tuesday, but would not comment afterward. He has said that
Letterman does not know Ray.

<TEXT>
   A surgeon was arrested in
connection with an attack on his ex-wife, Aissa Wayne, the daughter
of the late John Wayne, police said today.
   Thomas A. Gionis, 35, of Pomona was arrested late Tuesday night
in the Oct. 3, 1988, attack on Ms. Wayne and her then-boyfriend,
Roger Luby, police Sgt. Trent Harris said.
   Gionis, who was jailed without bail for investigation of
conspiracy to commit assault with a deadly weapon, was the third
person arrested in the attack at Luby's Newport Beach estate.
   Police in March arrested two employees of a Los Angeles private
detective firm retained by Gionis in a dispute in which Ms. Wayne
is trying to gain custody of their now 2-year-old daughter,
Anastasia. A judge in January granted custody to Gionis.
   An arrest warrant also has been issued for the firm's owner, O.
Daniel Gal, who authorities believe fled to Europe after
questioning.
   Ms. Wayne could not be reached for comment late Tuesday, but her
mother, Pilar Wayne, said Gionis' arrest was ``marvelous.''
   ``I'm speechless. Oh my God, I'm absolutely speechless. This
thing has kept me up night after night after night worrying about
it. I didn't expect anything like this,'' Mrs. Wayne said.
   Ms. Wayne, 32, was bloodied in an attack by two men, while Luby,
52, was beaten and had his Achilles tendon slashed. As the men
left, one of them said, ``You're messing with the wrong guy. Next
time, we kill you,'' police have said.
   The couple separated in 1987 after one year of marriage, and
their divorce became final last year.

<HEAD>Prosecutors To Charge Suspect In Palme Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors said today they will file
charges against a man who was arrested in December and questioned
about the 1986 slaying of Prime Minister Olof Palme.
   After four months of investigation, the prosecutors said they
believe they have compiled enough circumstantial evidence to
convict Christer Pettersson, 42, in the shooting of Palme in
downtown Stockholm. However, they did not say what charges would be
filed against Pettersson.
   Assistant prosecutor Axel Morath asked the Stockholm district
court for 14 more days to prepare the charges. It was not clear
when the trial would begin.
   Palme was gunned down on Feb. 28, 1986, and his wife Lisbet was
grazed by a second bullet. The assailant escaped down a dark alley.
   Palme was a controversial four-term prime minister and champion
of Third World liberation movements and an international
disarmament activist.
   The prosecutors said in a statement today that ``the evidence
against the suspect has been strengthened during the time he has
been detained.'' The communique said ``the evidence is judged to be
so strong that the prosecutors have decided charges should be filed
and the case should be tested in court.''
   ``More time is needed to conclude the investigation,'' the
statement said.
   Swedish newspapers say Pettersson has a long criminal record and
a history of violent behavior, accompanied by drug and alcohol
abuse. Investigators reportedly believe he acted alone but have not
disclosed any motive.

   A high school senior who mouthed

   Conestoga Valley High School principal Harry Wirth said Tuesday

   ``In this situation, he didn't know how to act,'' Wirth said.

<HEAD>Government Begins Contempt Proceedings Against Newspapers Over Excerpts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has begun contempt of court
proceedings against three newspapers for printing excerpts of
``Spycatcher,'' the best-selling book by former British
intelligence officer Peter Wright.
   In hearings that began Tuesday in the High Court, government
attorney John Laws described the 74-year-old Wright as ``a
disgraced and discredited former member of the British security
services'' who owed Britain a lifelong ``duty of confidentiality.''
   Wright, now retired, lives in Australia.
   Laws accused The Independent, The Sunday Times and the
now-defunct News on Sunday of committing a ``grave contempt of
court'' for publishing the excerpts in 1987.
   Temporary injunctions, granted by the High Court at the request
of the government in 1987, had banned British newspapers from
publishing excerpts from the book but no longer are enforced.
   If found to have been in contempt of court, the newspapers can
be fined, or, at worst, their editors jailed. The extent of the
fine or jail term is at the discretion of the judge.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government has failed to
suppress the book in three years of court fights in London,
Australia, Hong Kong and elsewhere.
   The government unsuccessfully argued that Wright, once a senior
officer with Britain's counterespionage agency MI5, violated a
pledge by British intelligence officers never to reveal details of
their secret work.
   ``Spycatcher,'' published in 40 countries including the United
States, became a best seller despite government attempts to quash
its publication.
   British authorities made no attempt to stop the book being
brought into Britain, but temporary injunctions banned British news
media from publishing extracts readily available in newspapers
abroad.
   After several court hearings, the Law Lords, Britain's highest
court, last October rejected the government's request to make the
interim injunctions permanent.
   The Law Lords charged Wright with violating his secrecy oath but
lifted the temporary injunctions, saying any damage to British
security already had been caused by the book's publication abroad.
Nevertheless, ``Spycatcher'' effectively has been banned in Britain
as publishers will not publish it for fear of being prosecuted
under the Official Secrets Act.
   In a statement Tuesday, The Independent editor Andreas Whittam
Smith said he decided it was in the public interest to publish
Wright's allegations of treason in MI5.
   ``Spycatcher'' alleges the late MI5 chief Sir Roger Hollis was a
Soviet agent, a claim the government says never was substantiated.
The book also claims MI5 officers eavesdropped on foreign
embassies, bungled operations, stole documents, plotted to
assassinate Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser and plotted to
destabilize Harold Wilson's Labor Party government.

<TEXT>
   Attorneys are seeking the release of a
man whom state officials now agree didn't get a fair trial when he
was convicted in the poisoning deaths of his seven children.
   James J. Richardson, 53, was sentenced to die in the electric
chair after his 1968 trial. His sentence was commuted to life in
prison after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty
in 1972.
   Last fall, newspaper reports claimed that prosecutors withheld
evidence from defense attorneys. Richardson's advocates say
prosecutors framed him and suggest DeSoto County officials
protected a more likely suspect, the children's babysitter.
   After months of investigation this year, a special prosecutor
appointed by Gov. Bob Martinez confirmed evidence was withheld and
Attorney General Bob Butterworth concluded Richardson received an
unfair trial.
   Chief Justice Raymond Ehrlich of the Florida Supreme Court said
he intends to appoint a special judge to reconsider Richardson's
conviction.
   In the meantime, Richardson's attorney, Ellis Rubin, said
Tuesday that he has asked that Richardson be released from prison,
and he predicted Richardson could be out this week.
   A clemency hearing had been scheduled for Thursday, but the
governor postponed it after his special prosecutor concluded
evidence was withheld.
   ``He (Butterworth) thinks there's an injustice. He's going to
want to see that guy out yesterday,'' said Jim York, the attorney
general's chief deputy. ``The Constitution doesn't require that
every trial be perfect, but it sure requires that it be fair.''
   Richardson is serving his sentence at the Tomoka Correctional
Institution near Daytona Beach. He is eligible for parole in 1993.
   Once an illiterate and indigent migrant worker, Richardson
educated himself while behind bars and earned the respect of
corrections officials by compiling an immaculate disciplinary
record.
   He was convicted of only one count of first-degree murder for
the death of his eldest child, 8-year-old stepdaughter Betty Jean
Bryant. She and her six siblings, the youngest 2 years old, died
Oct. 25-26, 1967.
   On Oct. 25, they had eaten a lunch of rice, beans, hogshead
cheese and grits that was laced with the pesticide parathion.
   The food had been prepared ahead of time and served at noontime
by their neighbor, Betsy Reese, while Richardson and his wife,
Annie Mae Richardson, were miles away picking oranges.
   Among questions now raised about the prosecution was the
contention that Richardson had purchased life insurance policies
covering the children.
   Jurors weren't told that although Richardson intended to buy the
policies, he hadn't made the first premium payment and the policies
hadn't taken effect when the children were killed.
   In 1970, attorney Mark Lane published a book called ``Arcadia''
in which he concluded Richardson had been railroaded, but nothing
came of it. The family lived in a Arcadia, about 35 miles east of
Sarasota.
   Then, last fall, Rubin and Lane contended the now-senile baby
sitter confessed to the killings.
   A spokesman for Frank Schaub, who prosecuted Richardson,
contends there was no wrongdoing and that if retried today,
Richardson would be convicted.
   ``I don't agree that any evidence was withheld from the
defense,'' said the spokesman, Sarasota attorney Larry Byrd.
   Schaub has filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Rubin and
Lane, charging that they defamed him by suggesting last fall that
he should be tried on an attempted murder charge because Richardson
once faced death in the electric chair.

<TEXT>
   Thunderous blasts echoed across Beirut
and the surrounding mountains today as Syrian and Christian gunners
fought with howitzers and rocket launchers for a fifth straight day.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman denied a radio report that the
residence of U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy in the Christian suburb
of Yarze was on fire after taking a direct hit.
   ``The house of the ambassador has been hit repeatedly during the
last week, and recently some shells fell near the compound, but not
in the compound. There was no fire,'' said the spokesman, speaking
without using his name.
   Police said seven people have been killed and 30 wounded in the
exchanges since midnight Tuesday.
   The latest casualties raised to 162 killed and 536 wounded the
overall toll from the 29-day confrontation between Gen. Michel
Aoun's Christian troops and an alliance of Syrian and Druse forces.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross called on the
combatants to spare the civilian population.
   ``Once again, we call on all parties to respect the basic
humanitarian principles...and respect the civilian population which
is suffering more casualties every day,'' Red Cross chief delegate
Michel Dufour told a news conference at the mission's headquarters
in Moslem west Beirut.
   Dufour said the Red Cross mission in Lebanon had enough supplies
to ``cover emergency needs in Lebanon for the next two or three
months.''
   Pope John Paul II also today appealed for an end to the
``terrible bombardments'' in Lebanon today, saying the fighting
threatened the very existence of the country.
   Shells fell randomly into Christian and Moslem residential areas
despite a call from the Arab League for a cease-fire.
   The appeal was stressed Tuesday by Kuwaiti Foreign Minister
Sheik Sabah Ahmad Sabah upon his arrival in Damascus, Syria. Sabah
was to meet with leftist Lebanese leaders on ways of settling a
six-month political crisis that threatens to cement the nation's de
facto partition.
   ``In the name of the Arab World, in the name of humanity, I
appeal to all to cease firing immediately ... Once the cease-fire
is in force, all solutions are possible,'' said Sabah, who heads a
six-man Arab League panel on Lebanon.
   The Lebanese Front alliance of right-wing Christian factions, in
a statement published today, said it will not take part in talks
with Sabah.
   Aoun's command said in a communique its gunners ``scored direct
hits'' on two Syrian tanks around the mountain resort of Aley,
southeast of Beirut, and a Syrian howitzer emplacement in the
seaside Khaldeh junction, south of Beirut.
   The report could not be verified with the Syrian command.
   However, Syrian army checkpoints in Khaldeh were deserted early
in the day and helmeted soldiers were seen taking cover in foxholes
along the sand coast, an indication the area was under shelling.
   Smoke billowed from the wooded hills of Aramoun where the
Syrians maintain artillery and rocket batteries south of Khaldeh.
   Witnesses said Syrian gunners also opened fire at the
310-square-mile Christian enclave from several rocket launchers
mounted on trucks and driving across several Moslem residential
neighborhoods in west and south Beirut.
   A police spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said Christian
militiamen of the right-wing Lebanese forces alliance opened fire
at Moslem west Beirut from twin-barrelled, anti-aircraft guns.
   He said the rounds from both the mobile launchers and fixed
emplacements in east Beirut are ``exploding in most streets of west
Beirut.''
   A mortar round slammed into a narrow street off west Beirut's
Hamra commercial thoroughfare, seriously wounding two pedestrians,
witnesses said.
   A witness said the mortar round explosion ``chopped off the legs
of a male pedestrian near a stationery shop.
   The current crisis began Sept. 22 when President Amin Gemayel's
six-year term expired with parliament failing to elect a successor.
   Gemayel appointed Aoun head of an interim military cabinet to
rule pending the election of a new president.
   Syrian-backed Moslems rejected Aoun's appointment because it
violated a 45-year-old tradition of having a Sunni Moslem premier,
a Christian president and a Shiite Moslem parliament speaker. They
pledged allegiance to acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni who
governed under Gemayel.

   ``We welcome President Gorbachev's arrival in Britain,'' said
the full-page advertisement, which appeared the same day as the
Soviet leader's arrival from Cuba. ``We also welcome the concluding
statement of the Vienna Conference and the Soviet government's
renewed commitments to improving human rights conditions in the
Soviet Union which are contained in it.
   ``We note the British government's conditions for attending the
Moscow human rights conference in 1991 and we would measure Soviet
performance of their commitments against the following checklist:
   ``Freedom to emigrate; freedom of religious and cultural
expression; freedom from discrimination; freedom of all prisoners
of conscience; freedom of speech; freedom to monitor these basic
human rights.
   ``These basic human rights, guaranteed by international law,
continue to be abused in the Soviet Union. We look forward to the
Soviet Union fulfilling its undertakings. At that time we would
feel able to give our warm support to the British government's
attendance at the Moscow human rights conference.''
   The ad was placed by the Parliamentary Committee for the Release
of Soviet Jewry and was signed by 212 of the 650 members of the
House of Commons.
   No ministers in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative
government were among the signatories.
   Mrs. Thatcher in January listed the release of all religious and
political prisoners in the Soviet Union as among Britain's
conditions for attending a 1991 human rights conference in Moscow.
   The human rights group Amnesty International said on Friday that
despite improvements in the Soviet Union, at least 100 dissidents
remained imprisoned there, including 25 in psychiatric hospitals.
   Gorbachev will spend three days in Britain.
   He will have lunch Friday with Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor
Castle and deliver a speech in London's ancient Guildhall, seat of
city government for 1,000 years.
   Mrs. Thatcher and Gorbachev are to sign agreements on visas and
mutual trade promotion and for Britain to rebuild an Armenian
school destroyed in the December earthquake.

   Vietnam announced today it will
withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by Sept. 30, ending a 10-year
occupation and conflict with resistance forces.
   Vietnam previously had said it would withdraw its troops,
estimated at 70,000, by 1990 and would be out by September only if
a political settlement were reached.
   Today's announcement, made simultaneously at news conferences in
Phnom Penh, Hanoi, and Laos, gave no indication conditions were
attached to the September pullout.
   It appeared aimed at removing a major obstacle to peace talks.
It could also enhance Vietnam's efforts to improve relations with
its non-communist neighbors in Southeast Asia, who have been
involved in a major effort to remove Vietnamese forces from
Cambodia and restore peace to the country.
   However, Cambodia would reserve the right to ask for foreign
assistance if anti-government guerrillas threatened the
Vietnamese-backed administration.
   ``Vietnam will withdraw from Kampuchea (Cambodia) all of her
forces by the end of September 1989,'' said a statement read to
reporters by Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen.
   He gave no timetable for the pullout.
   ``From now until September, time is very short,'' he said.
``Therefore, the problem of withdrawal by phase or territory is not
of any importance now. What is important is that there will be no
more Vietnamese troops.''
   ``The total withdrawal of Vietnamese forces and the cessation of
all foreign interference and all military aid will put an end to
the civil war and stimulate the Kampuchean parties to settle the
internal aspects of the Kampuchean question before September 1989
on the basis of national reconciliation,'' Hun Sen said.
   He said he would meet with Prince Norodom Sihanouk, leader of
the three-member Cambodian resistance alliance, in Jakarta,
Indonesia, on May 2 in a new effort ``to resolve the problem of
Kampuchea.''
   But he rejected the prince's demand the Vietnamese-backed
government be dissolved prior to a general election. ``Only the
Kampuchean people have the right to dismantle,'' he said. ``The
other side has nothing and they want everything.''
   In a statement released by Sihanouk's Bangkok office, the prince
said the withdrawal should be monitored by the United Nations ``and
not be controlled by countries chosen unilaterally by Vietnam.''
   He said China would end its support for the resistance ``when
the United Nations has verified the reality of this withdrawal,
which has been barely credible so far.''
   Hun Sen's statement said Canada, Poland, Indonesia and India
were invited to jointly monitor the pullout in coordination with a
representative of U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service reported that Foreign Minister Nguyen
Co Thach of Vietnam confirmed the pullout during a Hanoi news
conference.
   In Bangkok, Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savestila told
reporters he was informed of the Vietnamese decision today during a
meeting with Hanoi's ambassador in Thailand, Le Mai.
   Siddhi said the Vietnamese envoy urged all other countries to
refrain from supporting resistance groups seeking to topple the Hun
Sen government.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and ousted the
government of the communist Khmer Rouge, under which an estimated
one-fourth of the country's 8 million people died from famine and
execution.
   As of August, Vietnamese had about 140,000 troops in Cambodia,
but Vietnam began withdrawing troops last year and an estimated
70,000 remain.
   Siddhi said the Vietnamese ambassador told him there were 50,000
troops left in Cambodia.
   Fear that the Khmer Rouge _ the strongest force in a resistance
coalition _ might return to power has been a major hurdle in
negotiations on a post-occupation coalition government for Cambodia.
   The resistance is led by Prince Sihanouk, the former Cambodian
ruler. It includes the non-communist Khmer People's National
Liberation Front.
   Officials of the Vietnamese-installed Cambodian government had
urged an earlier withdrawal target provided neighboring Thailand
denied the guerrillas sanctuary and other countries stopped arming
the resistance groups.
   Thailand denies providing sanctuary to the guerrillas, but armed
groups move in and out of Cambodia from refugee camps along the
border. China arms the guerrillas while the Soviets support
Vietnamese forces.

<HEAD>Bush Judicial Nominee Comes Under Fire From Cranston</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs graf 5, Walker was, to include what court Walker nominated

   One of President Bush's first nominees for the
judicial bench is coming under heavy fire on Capitol Hill, with
Sen. Alan Cranston urging his defeat over membership in a San
Francisco club that excludes women.
   ``I urge that the nomination of Vaughn Walker not be approved,''
Cranston said Tuesday in a letter to Senate Judiciary Chairman
Joseph Biden, D-Del.
   Cranston's action represented a sharp setback for Walker, a San
Francisco attorney, since negative recommendations from home-state
senators have in some cases proven fatal to candidates for the
federal judiciary.
   There was no certainty, however, that Cranston's recommendation
would wreck the chances of Walker, a Reagan judicial pick whose
nomination was still pending when Congress adjourned last fall.
   Walker was among five Reagan judicial nominees who were stranded
when lawmakers adjourned and whose names have now been resubmitted
to the Senate by Bush for confirmation. He was nominated to U.S.
District Court in San Francisco.
   Cranston took aim at Walker's membership in San Francisco's
Olympic Club, which until recently barred blacks from membership
and still excludes women. One of its best known members was Supreme
Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, but he resigned a month before his
1987 confirmation hearings.
   Cranston said Kennedy's stand stood in ``stark contrast'' to
Walker's attitude toward the club. Walker, himself, was not reached
for comment. His office said he was busy in court.
   ``I have reached the conclusion that his actions with respect to
his membership in a discriminatory club are disqualifying,''
Cranston said.
   Learning of Cranston's action, an aide to California's other
senator, Pete Wilson, R-Calif., long a champion of Walker's cause,
said the attorney had resigned from the club a month ago.
   ``He said he wanted to enact reforms internally and if he were
unsuccessful in gaining the changes he wanted, then he would resign
from the club,'' press secretary Bill Livingston said.
   Cranston press secretary Murray Flander retorted that ``nobody
on the Judiciary Committee has been told that, and even if true it
wouldn't change Alan's mind because he was just too slow.''
   In his letter, Cranston said Walker's ``persistent refusal to
terminate his membership in this club and his testimony regarding
this issue ... demonstrate an attitude and an insensitivity which
is unacceptable for a member of the federal judiciary.''
   He cited Canon 2 of the American Bar Association Code of
Judicial Conduct, which holds that ``it is inappropriate for a
judge to hold membership in any organization that practices
invidious discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion or
national origin.''
   The senator quoted Walker testimony June 13 before the Judiciary
Committee that ``in the past, there had been no formal exclusion of
blacks or, indeed, any other racial minorities.''
   He said this was contradicted by an Aug. 8 letter to the
Judiciary Committee in which George Riley, a special assistant to
the San Francisco city attorney, said the club's bylaws
``restricted membership to `only white male citizens of the United
States of good moral character, integrity and reputation.''' The
policy was challenged in 1967 by community groups, and the club
dropped the ban against minorities a year later.
   Cranston said Walker told the panel the club had made
``substantial'' change in regard to this policy when, according to
Riley, the club had ``announced that it had admitted two black men
into its membership of more than 4,700 members.''
   The Judiciary Committee received a June 30 press release issued
by the club describing certain procedures as designed to avoid
coverage under a San Francisco ordinance barring discrimination,
Cranston said.
   He quoted the press release as saying the club acted to ``defend
the fundamental rights of its members against the strong arm of
political oppression.''
   Such action, Cranston said, was ``wholly inconsistent with Mr.
Walker's characterization of an organization voluntarily moving
toward compliance with basic civil rights principles.'' The senator
also criticized a statement that a vote to drop a bar against women
members was ``very close'' when in fact it was 1,540 to 2,082.

   An Eastern Airlines shuttle with one passenger
aboard blew two tires while landing in heavy fog, blocking a runway
that caused Logan International Airport to close to incoming
traffic for two hours.
   There were no injuries reported on the Tuesday shuttle, Flight
138 from Washington's National Airport, said airport spokesman Phil
Orlandella.
   The disabled plane, with two blown tires on its right side,
blocked the runway used for instrument-guided landings during fog
for two hours, but departures were not affected, Orlandella said.
   Reports said the tires blew after an antiskidding mechanism on
the right landing gear locked during the landing, he said.

<TEXT>
   The Armed Forces radio restricted broadcasts of
a newly released Israeli pop song about the Palestinian uprising,
saying the subject is sensitive, an army official said today.
   The song, ``The Flood Is Behind Us,'' written and sung by Nurit
Galron, implies that Israelis in coastal Tel Aviv show indifference
toward Arab suffering in the 16-month rebellion in the occupied
territories.
   The military station played the song several times before
station commander Nahman Shai ordered that it be played only with
his consent, two Israeli dailies, Hadashot and Maariv, said.
   ``It is an unusual step, but we are a military framework and
some consider this sensitive because it discusses the uprising,''
said an official in Shai's office, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Hadashot said Shai criticized the song as ``a glorification of
the subject, with lines that are hard to accept.''
   Part of the song's lyrics, are:
   ``There is a country of stones and firebombs,
   And there is a Tel Aviv on fire with nightclubs and lewdness.
   There is a country of rebels where the wounded are being
bandaged,
   And there is a Tel Aviv that makes merry with food and drink.
   No, don't tell me about a little girl who lost an eye,
   It only makes me feel bad.
   I don't feel like hearing about people oppressed or tortured,
   I don't care what is happening in the territories ....
   We will make love and live our lives. Tel Aviv is life.''
   Last year, Israeli radio stations restricted broadcast of
another protest song about Israel's handling of the uprising called
``Shooting and Crying,'' by rock star Cy Hyman.
   The uprising, which began Dec. 8, 1987, has claimed the lives of
419 Palestinians in the territories as well as 18 Israelis.

   About 250 students at China's top university
defied a school prohibition today and met to discuss democracy and
political change.
   Li Shuxian, wife of China's most famous dissident, Fang Lizhi,
urged the students to pursue democratic change.
   Student activists called on classmates to persuade Beijing
University to allow the ``Democratic Salon'' to continue. But some
said they are afraid they will be denied good jobs if they support
the movement. Others said calls for freedom of speech and
association are hopeless in China.
   Students said the crowd contained numerous plainclothes
policeman. Men hovered on its outskirts, taking photographs.
   The open-air gathering came two days after a wall poster urged
Beijing University authorities to stop interfering in the
``Democratic Salon.''
   More than 60 students signed the poster, which said democratic
change in China ``is not simply a matter of saying a few empty
words.''
   School spokesman Yan Huajiang said the university permits
student activities ``as long as they are healthy and good for the
students.'' But if it feels the activities are ``unhealthy,'' it
takes steps to stop them, he said.
   Today, Wang Dan, a history major and an author of the poster,
said the group wants to ``enliven thought.'' He said, ``We're just
trying to create an atmosphere where people can discover things.''
   He said the school prohibited the group from meeting several
weeks ago. Already, the group has met 13 times. Most recently, city
government officials stopped a professor from another school from
addressing the salon March 29.
   ``They told him we were holding an illegal meeting,'' Wang said.
   During the two-hour meeting, Li, who like her dissident husband
is a physicist, acknowledged she was taking a chance. ``This time,
I come before you, courageously,'' she said. But, she added, she
was prepared for the worst.
   ``Go ahead and tap my phone!'' she cried. ``For me, democracy is
not something that can be divided into East or West, it is a
fundamental principle.'' Li asked students for ideas on social
change.
   The crowd was mostly silent. Some smiled nervously. Then a
bespectacled young man in a worn Mao suit stood up.
   ``We want to speak out, but we are afraid of all the people here
listening,'' he said. ``Graduation day is coming fast and jobs will
follow.''
   ``It's not so much fear that I feel, it's just hopelessness,''
said another student. ``Our leaders don't listen to the people.
They never will.''
   The meeting came a day after the closing session of the National
People's Congress, China's legislature, which put political reform
on hold and labeled human rights ``an abstract concept.''

   President Bush is weighing the possibility of
asking Congress to approve a 25 percent pay raise for federal
judges, a senior administration official said today.
   This official, discussing Bush's options on grounds he not be
named publicly, also said, however, that ``no final decision memo''
has reached the president's desk.
   Bush had said last week that he intends to make ``very specific
proposals'' on pay increases for top federal officials, even though
Congress two months ago rejected a proposal that would have given
lawmakers a 50 percent pay raise. This proposal, advanced by the
Commission on Legislative, Executive and Judicial Salaries, also
would have included substantial hikes for the judiciary and
approximately 7,000 top executives.
   The Bush administration official said today that among other
options still under consideration at the White House is a series of
pay hikes for certain categories of federal officials, rather than
a single, across-the-board raise for these officials.
   The Washington Post initially reported in its Wednesday editions
that Bush would propose a 25 per pay hike for the judges. Most
federal judges now make $89,500 per year, the same salary as
members of Congress and top federal officials.
   One administration source said that Bush had not yet settled on
a figure. But another official noted that a commission studying
public service jobs in the federal government had recommended a 25
percent pay raise, and that that figure was the one being focused
on by the White House. The commission, headed by former Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, made its report public late last
month.
   Bush's plan is expected to be announced next week, White House
officials have said, and presidential advisers were said today to
be discussing which federal officials to peg for raises in addition
to the federal judges.
   The president also is preparing a package of ethics legislation,
and the administration hasn't decided whether to tie the two issues
together.
   The 50 percent hike was voted down by Congress in February after
a rising tide of public opposition to the pay hike.

<TEXT>
   A black police officer has filed a lawsuit
against three fellow officers and the city of Oakland, saying the
officers hit him with their car and beat him before recognizing him
as an undercover colleague.
   Derrick Norfleet, then 25 and a police officer for two years,
said he had just finished making an undercover drug purchase in
July when he was chased, hit by a patrol car, and kicked and beaten
while he lay face down. The beating stopped only after he rolled
over and the officers saw his face, he said.
   ``Mr. Norfleet appears to have been assaulted for no other
reason than that he appeared to be just another black person who
may or may not have committed some criminal offense,'' said his
lawyer, John Burris.
   He said the officers who attacked his client were two whites and
an Asian.
   Police Chief George Hart and city lawyers did not return
telephone calls about the case. The city denied Norfleet's
administrative claim for damages in December.
   The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, seeks at
least $500,000 in damages against the city for emotional distress,
and another $1 million in punitive damages against the three
officers. It comes a day after criminal charges were filed against
two Long Beach police officers in an incident in which a black
police officer posing as a motorist was shoved through a window.
   Norfleet's lawsuit said he was on an assignment to buy drugs
undercover and provide information to uniformed officers who would
arrest the sellers. He said he had made his purchase at a home and
was walking through a park when he realized he was being pursued by
a car occupied by the uniformed officers.
   Thinking a ``simulated arrest'' was about to take place,
Norfleet first started to run away, but then stopped and stood with
his hands in the air and his back to the car, the lawsuit said.
   He said the car sped up and hit him from behind, sending him
over the hood and onto the ground. As he lay face down, he said,
three officers got out and struck him with their fists, feet and a
flashlight. He then rolled over and the three, on the same
narcotics assignment as Norfleet, recognized him, the lawsuit said.
   ``Even if he had been a criminal, no conduct that he engaged in
was provocative or aggressive,'' Burris said.
   Burris said Norfleet suffered mainly bumps and bruises and was
on disability leave for a short period before returning to the
police force, where he still works. The most serious effects were
psychological, the lawyer said, the result of ``a horrible
nightmarish experience which he has relived often.''
   The suit accuses the three officers of ``a racially motivated
misuse of government power.'' It says the city and its Police
Department had ``an informal custom or policy of condoning and
encouraging the use of excessive force and the infliction of
summary corporal punishment against black citizens.''

<HEAD>Report Says Flawed Inquest Into Killings Failed to Get Truth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer who observed the inquest into the
shooting of three unarmed IRA members in Gibraltar last year says
the inquiry was flawed, fell short of international legal standards
and raised doubt about the legality of the killings.
   The inquest raised ``serious doubt as to whether U.K. law on the
use of force meets international standards,'' Hilary Kitchin wrote
in her report released today. It urged another inquiry into the
March 6, 1988, deaths of Mairead Farrell, Daniel McCann and Sean
Savage, who were shot in Gibraltar by British anti-terrorist
operatives.
   The government alleged they were plotting a car bombing in the
British colony on the southern tip of Spain, and the Irish
Republican Army acknowledged the three were on an ``active
service'' mission.
   It was later revealed, contrary to initial government accounts,
that the three were unarmed and that no car bomb was found.
   Amnesty International and other human rights groups then called
for an independent inquiry into whether lethal force was necessary.
   The 19-day inquest in September ruled 9-2 the killings were
lawful.
   Ms. Kitchin, sent to the inquest as an observer by Britain's
National Council for Civil Liberties and the New York-based
International League for Human Rights, said the hearing left some
questions unanswered. She called for a judicial inquiry with wider
powers than the Gibraltar coroner's.
   The government had no comment on Ms. Kitchin's report,
reiterating that it stood by the initial verdict.
   Ms. Kitchen said Coroner Felix Pizzarello should have questioned
witnesses more fully and that the government lawyer, responsible
for representing the public interest, was in fact ``representing
parties with a definite interest in the outcome.''
   It noted there were contradictory reports of Spanish-British
cooperation in tracking the trio's movements before they entered
Gibraltar.
   British authorities told the inquest there was no such
surveillance.
   ``It is a matter of serious concern that the contradictory
Spanish accounts ... were excluded from consideration at the
inquest,'' Ms. Kitchin wrote.
   She said no testimony was taken from witnesses who might have
shed light on a controversial description of a man shooting Savage
and then pumping bullets into him as he lay on the ground.
   Kenneth Asquez, a Gibraltar bank clerk, gave that account to a
television crew but retracted it at the inquest with an
``unsatisfactory'' explanation, the report said.
   ``Normal police procedures were forgotten at the scene of the
shootings,'' Ms. Kitchin wrote. Spent cartridges weren't marked,
the bodies weren't photographed where they lay, and the
post-mortems were flawed, her report said.
   The coroner failed to use his power to disqualify jurors who
might be biased through being employed by or related to members of
the armed forces, the lawyer wrote.
   The coroner also misdirected the jury into thinking its only
choice was between ruling the killings lawful or unlawful, she
said, and the jury ``may have felt under pressure'' to reach a
speedy verdict when it was told, less than six hours after
retiring, that time was running out.

<TEXT>
   A nurse who thought she was a millionaire for
five seconds before the California Lottery reduced her fortune to
$10,000 has won her $3 million back and then some.
   A Superior Court jury ruled Tuesday that Doris Barnett was
entitled to the larger payoff plus $400,000 in damages.
   Deputy Attorney General Norman Peek, representing the State
Lottery, said the verdict probably would be appealed.
   Ms. Barnett won the right to appear on California Lottery's Big
Spin on Dec. 30, 1985. In the contest, players spin a wheel, watch
a ball bounce around and fall into a slot labeled with a sum of
money. The lowest amount that can be won is $10,000.
   When Ms. Barnett spun the wheel, the ball fell into the $3
million hole and show host Geoff Edwards proclaimed her a
multimillion-dollar winner.
   Then the ball slipped out of the hole and into a $10,000 slot.
The lottery awarded Ms. Barnett the lesser amount, contending the
ball failed to stay in the $3 million slot for five seconds as
required under lottery law.
   In closing arguments last week, Ms. Barnett's attorney, Lawrence
Sperber, argued that the five-second rule was superseded when
Edwards declared her a winner.
   ``If they're not going to wait five seconds, then they can't
come into this courtroom today and say to you that she had to wait
five seconds,'' he asked.
   Peek argued that Edwards was mistaken when he made the early
announcement. He said Ms. Barnett was aware of the five-second rule.
   ``She agreed when she bought her ticket to abide by the rules _
all of them,'' he said. ``I think Ms. Barnett is asking for you to
make an exception for her.''
   ``It feels so wonderful,'' Ms. Barnett, 54, said after the
verdict was announced. ``I'm going to take care of my mother and
take care of my children. I want to send my kids to school to get
them some of the opportunities I didn't have.''

wouldn't arrive in time to stop a would-be robber blocked the man's
escape and persuaded him to return the money he had taken.
   ``I wanted him to be apprehended, so I followed him,'' Robert
Smith, president of Derry Bank and Trust, said after the robbery
Tuesday.
   William Abrams, 29, of Derry, was arrested shortly after the
robbery and was held on $10,000 bond on a robbery charge.
   Smith said tellers called his attention to a suspicious-looking
man as the person entered the bank.
   ``When I saw the guy on our video (monitor), I said, `I think we
are going to get it.'''
   The man approached a teller, pulled out a knife and yelled,
``This is a robbery.'' At that point, Smith told another teller to
call police.
   The robber took an undetermined amount of money and headed for
the door, but was blocked by Smith.
   ``I said, `Leave the money and I'll let you go,''' Smith said.
``But he didn't want to do that.''
   The man headed for another door and again was stopped by Smith,
who told the man he had called police and persuaded him to return
the money. But when Smith suggested that he sit down and wait for
officers to arrive, the man fled.
   Smith said he chased the suspect because, if the stolen cash had
left the building, ``then the FBI would have been down here messing
around for three days. Things go a lot easier if you can get the
guy, rather than let him go.''

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, responding to
longstanding U.S. concerns about Moscow's intentions in Latin
America, says the Kremlin will refrain from putting military bases
or nuclear weapons in the region.
   With President Fidel Castro sitting nearby, the Soviet leader
said in a speech to the National Assembly on Tuesday that Moscow
supports the creation of a ``zone of peace'' in Latin America and
an end to all outside military aid to the region.
   Gorbachev's comments were made during his first diplomatic trip
to Latin America and seemed directed largely at Washington, whose
hemispheric policy for years has been based on concerns about
Soviet influence in the region.
   Tens of thousands of Cubans lined the streets this morning to
bid farewell to Gorbachev as he headed for the airport for a trip
to London.
   About 700 buses were mobilized for the occasion and many people
waited more than three hours for a final glimpse of the Soviet
leader. Workers were given time off to take part in the departure
activities.
   Gorbachev left at mid-morning following a hectic day Tuesday
highlighted by his late afternoon speech.
   It was a day for sightseeing by Gorbachev at local points of
interest and also a day in which dissident sources reported the
arrest of seven people who had planned to lead a pro-Gorbachev
demonstration at the Soviet Embassy.
   The planned demonstration, canceled after the arrests, intended
to seek Gorbachev's support for liberalizing moves in Cuba similar
to the ones he is carrying out in the Soviet Union.
   Castro introduced Gorbachev to the National Assembly, delivering
a fiery 50-minute address in which he blasted U.S. policies across
the board, particularly Washington's support for anti-communist
insurgencies.
   He criticized Western reporters for saying Gorbachev's reforms
have produced a rift between the two.
   Castro pointed out that the two countries have immense cultural,
economic and historical differences, and it is only natural that
they would follow different ideological paths.
   Still, Castro has indicated in the past that he was troubled
that Gorbachev would embrace some aspects of capitalism as part of
his sweeping policy shifts.
   At a news conference after his speech, Gorbachev also dismissed
as ``inventions'' Western media portrayals of him and Castro
``almost as enemies.''
   As proof of the durability of the Soviet-Cuban alliance,
Gorbachev and Castro signed a 25-year Treaty of Friendship and
Cooperation on Tuesday.
   Gorbachev did lend credence in his speech to widely reported
Soviet unhappiness with Cuban use of Soviet economic aid, estimated
at $5 billion annually. Economic ties between the countries, he
said, ``should be made more dynamic, more efficient and mutually
productive.''
   He called for ``stricter accountablity and more discipline to
ensure timely and proper compliance with obligations mutually
assumed.'' The remarks were interpreted as Soviet displeasure over
protracted delays in development projects to which Moscow has
contributed.
   On hemispheric issues, Gorbachev insisted that his country has
limited ambitions. The Soviet Union, he said, ``does not seek for
itself political, strategic or military advantage in the Western
Hemisphere.''
   ``We consider that this hemisphere and all others must not be an
arena for East-West confrontation.''
   He said the Soviet Union favors strengthening the existing
non-nuclear status of Latin America and proposed establishing a
``zone of peace'' in the region.
   Gorbachev said his country ``does not have any intention of
having in Latin America naval, air or missile bases or to place
there nuclear or other weapons of mass extermination'' _ a clear
allusion to the Kremlin's placing of nuclear missiles in Cuba in
1962 that were withdrawn under U.S. pressure.
   The Soviet leader said both his country and Cuba oppose ``the
export of revolution or counterrevolution, and all forms of foreign
interference in the affairs of sovereign nations.''
   But he said Soviet military aid to Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government would continue as long as U.S. military
assistance to other Central American countries continues.
   According to U.S. estimates, the Soviets shipped more than $500
million in military equipment last year to the Sandinistas.
   The Bush and Reagan administrations have shown no interest in
Gorbachev's appeal for a ban on all military aid to Central
America, calling it unbalanced.
   For its part, Washington has sent about $3.5 billion in aid this
decade to El Salvador's government, which is fighting a leftist
insurgency, as well as supported the Contra rebels in their fight
against the Sandinstas.
   Gorbachev's criticism of the United States was far more muted
than Castro's.
   When an American reporter invited Gorbachev to attack the Bush
administration's military spending policies as indicating a lack of
interest in arms control, Gorbachev ticked off the long list of
disarmament negotiations under way, leaving the impression that he
had faith in American goodwill.
   Castro, in contrast, assailed U.S. policies on Third World debt,
Afghanistan and Cuba itself, among other issues.

<HEAD>Pakistan Dismisses Afghanistan's Call For Emergency UN Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today dismissed as
propaganda Afghanistan's request that the U.N. Security Council
hold an emergency meeting to discuss the Afghan war.
   In a letter requesting the meeting, Afghanistan alleged that
Pakistani support for Moslem guerrillas threatened to create a
``serious regional conflict.''
   A Pakistan Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said, ``The effort is being made to externalize the
problem and we don't appreciate that. It is a propaganda move to
involve the Security Council.''
   Pakistan has been the conduit for millions of dollars in
military hardware supplied to the insurgents by their backers,
particularly the United States. Pakistan denies persistent Afghan
government allegations that it has troops fighting alongside the
guerrillas.
   Moslem guerrillas, also backed by several Arab states, have
waged a decade-long war against the communist government, which for
nine years received military backing from the Soviet Union. On Feb.
15, the Soviet army completed its withdrawal from Afghanistan in
accordance with a U.N.-mediated agreement.
   The Pakistani spokesman said Afghanistan's ruling Marxists are
trying to draw the 15-nation Security Council into what is now an
internal conflict.
   Pakistan's official news agency, APP, said Pakistan's U.N.
ambassador, S. Shah Nawaz, told Security Council chief Aleksander
Belongov of the Soviet Union the situation does not warrant a
council meeting because it poses no threat to regional peace and
security. It is an internal matter for the Afghans to settle
themselves, he was quoted as saying.
   Also today, Afghanistan announced it was putting two Pakistani
nationals on trial for allegedly spying. Official Afghan media said
the two were captured inside Afghanistan more than three weeks ago.
   An Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mohammad Nabi Amani, told
reporters in Kabul both men confessed. An espionage conviction
carries a prison sentence of 10 to 20 years. The Pakistani Foreign
Ministry spokesman said there was no proof the two are Pakistani
nationals.

<HEAD>Wildcat Strike Cuts London Subway Service By Half</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 24-hour wildcat strike by train drivers on
London's subway halted half the 254-mile network today, London
Regional Transport reported.
   The pay strike, coinciding with a snowstorm, upset travel plans
for many of the 3 million people who use London's underground train
system each day.
   ``Clearly it's a large proportion of the Underground,'' said a
spokesman for London Regional Transport, the government-appointed
board that runs the 126-year-old system. Only three of the 10
subway lines were operating fully after 256 of 476 drivers on the
morning shift stayed away.
   Subway cars grew crowded on these and another three lines that
offered a fraction of their normal services. Four lines were halted
completely, the spokesman said.
   To cut costs, the board wants to phase out conductors
responsible for opening and closing train doors. Drivers have
demanded more cash for operating trains without conductors. The
board has refused their demand.
   The transport spokesman said he did not know how many of drivers
would show up in the afternoon. The subway employs 2,400 drivers.

<HEAD>33 People Injured In Riot At Rio Train Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commuters rioted at Rio's main
train station after drivers announced an impromptu wage strike, and
33 people were injured when police shot and clubbed the protesters,
witnesses and doctors said.
   Riot police took control of Rio's Central station at about 6:00
p.m. Tuesday after drivers, demanding better pay and shorter
shifts, refused to move packed commuter trains, Sandra da Silva, a
station employee, said.
   The angry crowd shouted and threw stones at police, who opened
fire when protesters began attacking incoming city buses, da Silva
said.
   Television footage showed screaming mobs shattering bus
windshields, police beating protesters with rubber truncheons and
gunshot victims being carried to ambulances. Dr. Marcos
Albuquerque, head of Rio's Souza Aguiar Hospital emergency ward,
said eight people were shot and 25 seriously hurt in the clash.
   Train drivers are demanding a cut in their work shift from eight
to six hours, wage increases and improved safety conditions, Ertha
Murcia Buys, director of the Railworkers Union said.
   The average wage for drivers is $40 for a 48-hour work week.
   ``The trains are run with the minimum of safety standards,''
said Buys.
   The trains carry about 1 million commuters a day, mostly from
Rio's slum suburbs. Most commuters work in Rio as manual laborers
or maids.

<UNK>Settlement Reached In Molestation By Priest</UNK>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic archdiocese has agreed to pay
$358,000 to the families of three former altar boys who allegedly
were sexually molested by a British priest.
   The church authorities returned the Rev. Anton Mowat to England
for treatment instead of reporting him to police, according to a
report published Tuesday in the Atlanta Constitution.
   Mowat fled a treatment center there and currently is a fugitive.
   Mowat, who spent two years as associate pastor of Corpus Christi
Catholic Church in suburban Stone Mountain, was charged last year
with molesting four boys, ages 12 to 14, during the 12-month period
ending in October 1987.
   The out-of-court civil settlement involves three of the four
boys.
   The archdiocese agreed to pay $30,000 each to the three parents
or guardians, with a total of about $107,000 in other compensation
plus $161,000 in attorneys fees going to two of the guardians,
according to court documents.
   The church also agreed to undisclosed ``deferred payments'' to
two of the victims after they reach the age of 18.
   Parents reported the molestations to the archdiocese, assuming
the church would contact authorities.
   Sent back to England, Mowat vanished from a Catholic center
where priests are treated for various psychological or behavioral
problems. Church officials in England reportedly were unaware of
the indictment.
   Robert R. Richardson, attorney for the victims, declined to
comment on the settlement.

   A man who was charged with harassment for
scribbling an obscenity on a parking ticket and sending it with
payment to the city has won an apology and $7,380 to cover his
legal fees.
   Last August Rochester dismissed the second-degree harassment
charge against George Morgenstern, who then filed a $1.8 million
lawsuit in federal court claiming his right to free speech had been
violated by the leveling of the charge against him.
   The lawsuit was settled out of court Tuesday.
   Morgenstern, 41, wrote the obscenity on the back of a $12
parking ticket he received June 4.
   Parking Violations Bureau supervisor Lester Roden Jr., who filed
the charge against Morgenstern, signed the letter of apology, said
Municipal Lawyer Patrick Naylon.

<HEAD>Ethics Committee Investigates Benefits Wright Received from Partner</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Tops with 7 grafs, deliberations resume, confirmation some charges
dropped</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee resumed
deliberations today in the case of Speaker Jim Wright,
concentrating on whether Wright improperly accepted gifts from a
business partner and whether he evaded limits on outside income
through sales of a book he published, according to sources.
   The committee is considering whether benefits Wright received
from Fort Worth developer George Mallick, roughly valued in the
range of $100,000, amount to unreported gifts intended to buy
influence over legislation affecting the savings and loan industry.
   A key to that question, as the panel resumed closed-door
discussions after a two-week Easter break, was whether Mallick had
a direct interest in legislation dealing with S&amp;Ls when he paid the
benefits to Wright and his wife, Betty.
   Committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said he expected the
panel could reach some conclusion on the Wright case next week.
``We're making progress, and I'm satisfied with our progress,''
Dixon said.
   A Democratic House source confirmed today that the panel already
has decided to drop three of the six counts against Wright brought
last June when the investigation began.
   Those include Wright's intervention with federal banking
regulators on behalf of troubled savings and loans; his
intercession with government officials on behalf of a Texas oil and
gas company; and his use of a government-paid staff aide to compile
parts of a book.
   Remaining before the panel are charges that Wright used bulk
sales of the book, ``Reflections of a Public Man,'' to evade limits
on outside income from speaking fees, and the issues arising out of
Wright's dealings with Mallick.
   Mallick, Wright and their wives were partners in a small
investment corporation, Mallightco, from 1979 until last year.
During that time, Mallick gave Wright the use of a Fort Worth
condominium for only a nominal fee, the use of a 1979 Cadillac and
until 1984 paid Wright's wife, Betty, $18,000 a year in salary for
part-time investment advice.
   Sources familiar with the investigation have said the panel's
outside counsel, Richard Phelan, has been highly skeptical of the
benefits that went from Mallick to Wright and doubted whether Mrs.
Wright had done any substantial work in return for her salary.
   It was unclear whether the ethics committee _ six Democrats and
six Republicans _ agrees with Phelan's assessment.
   ``The standard that is to be applied (to the Wright-Mallick
relationship) is obviously one that has to be discussed,'' Dixon
said.
   Further complicating the situation is a $2.2 million loan made
in 1985 to Mallick's sons, Stephen and Michael, and co-signed by
their father, to develop a small shopping center.
   The loan, first reported on Tuesday by the Wall Street Journal,
has since been foreclosed and the Mallicks are being sued for $1
million in losses suffered by the lender, Interwest Savings
Association, which later was taken over by regulators. Mallick
testified in a deposition in the case last May that he knew the
loan was going bad early in 1986, and blamed the problem in part on
pressure on S&amp;Ls by federal regulators.
   ``Many of the institutions were under the supervision of the
regulators,'' Mallick said in the deposition. ``They weren't able
to be flexible with their borrowers in order to maneuver and work
things out.''
   Mallick organized a meeting later in 1986 at which area
developers and lenders complained to Wright about the
heavy-handedness of regulators, and he prepared a report on the
subject at Wright's request.
   At the time, Wright was lobbying savings industry regulators on
behalf of some Texas institutions, and later approached House
colleagues to argue for requiring that regulators be more lenient
with troubled S&amp;Ls.
   Wright has maintained he is innocent of the charges against him
since the probe was opened last June, and strongly denied on
Tuesday that Mallick has ever asked him for favors.
   ``He has never asked me for any official assistance in any way,
shape or form,'' Wright said. He said that many other Texas
lawmakers of both parties had favored the same legislation because
of their state's depressed economy.
   But in recent weeks Wright has made his denials less
categorical, admitting he may have made mistakes in judgment. And
on Tuesday, Wright spokesman Mark Johnson added a new refinement,
saying if there were any rules violations, they were ``technical''
and ``unintentional.''
   On Tuesday, some ethics committee members took new depositions
from Mallick and from Richard Swann, chairman of the Pioneer
Savings Bank in Orlando, Fla. Questioning in those sessions focused
on an investment Mallick and Wright made in ``Winderwood,'' a
housing development undertaken by Swann and others beginning in
1985. Wright made roughly $50,000 on the deal.
   ``We're fine-tuning what we already knew,'' said committee
member John T. Myers, R-Ind.
   The ethics committee has been investigating Wright's finances
since last June and has spent some $1 million on Phelan's work.

   A big stink closed the Kanawha County

   As lawyers, clerks and judges arrived for work Monday, they were

cleared from the building.
   Chief Judge Herman Canady later ordered the Judicial Annex
closed for the day.
   Judge Paul Zakaib Jr. decided to hold court in the annex parking
lot. Attorneys who had scheduled hearings in his courtroom agreed

   In a dispute over a rental property, Zakaib leaned against a car

<HEAD>88 Percent of Deputies Elected to Soviet Parliament Party Members</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite the striking election defeat of many top
communists, Soviet voters chose party members for 88 percent of the
parliament seats that have been filled so far, the Communist Party
daily Pravda reported today.
   About 80 percent of candidates running in the Soviet Union's
first multicandidate elections in seven decades were Communist
Party members. They were running for the country's new 2,250-member
Congress of Peoples Deputies.
   Pravda, citing official results released Tuesday, said voters in
one out of every eight Soviet parliamentary districts on March 26
refused to elect anyone even though they had a choice of only one
or two candidates.
   That means that in 195 of the 1,500 geographical districts
across the country, and in three others in which less than 50
percent of the electorate voted, new campaigns will start for a
second election to be held May 14.
   The official news agency Tass said runoff elections will be held
in 76 other districts on Sunday for seats in which the vote was so
split among three or more candidates that no one received a
majority.
   Party officials and party-dominated bodies selected the
remaining 750 members to the new congress, which will choose a new
Supreme Soviet, the policy-making body.
   Across the country 89.8 percent of the voters took part in the
election, Orlov told Tass, adding:
   ``That high degree of activity gladdens us more than the
notorious 99.9 percent participation which we were proud of
earlier. In this election there was no race for percentage of
participation, the previous mandatory measures practiced previously
were fully excluded.''
   The Soviet Union in the past proclaimed an almost total
participation in elections as proof of citizens' satisfaction, even
though voters were not offered a choice.

<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Danish trawler was pulled backward
and almost dragged under the water when an unidentified submarine
got caught in its net, the navy said today.
   Skipper Michael Hansen and his helper, Kjeld Dideriksen, were
fishing Tuesday in the Baltic Sea, 20 miles southeast of the Danish
island of Bornholm.
   Suddenly the trawler, Christina-Michelle, stopped dead in the
water, and then began to run backward. The trawler was towed
partially under water.
   Hansen let go of his nets when he realized what was happening.
   The sub did not surface, the navy said.
   The Danish navy spotted what was believed to be the sub when it
surfaced several hours later and identified it as a Soviet-built
vessel, said Commander Senior Grade Ole Bratting of the Bornholm
district marine command.
   Bratting said the sub flew no flag and had no markings, which is
typical of Soviet vessels operating in the Baltic.
   The sub apparently was taking part in an anti-submarine warfare
exercise held by the East German navy in the western Baltic at the
time of the trawler episode, Bratting said.
   The navy said the incident was a common occurrence in Baltic Sea
waters.

<TEXT>
   A twister sent legislators scrambling for cover in the Alabama
Statehouse and North Dakota communities braced for more flooding.
Southern Californians had another weather woe: record heat that
sent tens of thousands to the beach.
   The Southern California heat wave, with temperatures reaching
three digits, was expected to continue today, combined with thick
smog.
   A severe storm that blew across northern Georgia on Tuesday was
blamed for two deaths, doubling the death toll from bad weather
this week.
   In the Northern Plains, water from the Red River filled the
streets of Wahpeton, N.D., and neighboring Breckenridge, Minn.,
seriously damaging 40 homes and causing minor damage to hundreds of
others, authorities said.
   North Dakota Gov. George Sinner, who declared a state of
emergency for the valley on Monday, intended to tour flooded
regions of Wahpeton and Fargo today.
   ``Based on information I've received from the National Weather
Service and state and local emergency management officials, serious
flooding is expected to threaten life and property along the Red
River and its tributaries for the next several weeks,'' Sinner said.
   A surge of severe thunderstorms and several tornadoes caused
damage but no injuries in South Carolina. In Georgia and Alabama,
storms left at least 150,000 homes without electricity.
   Storms caused flight delays of more than 1{ hours at Hartsfield
Atlanta International Airport, said Roger Myers, a Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman.
   The worst of the Georgia storms struck along a line just south
of the Blue Ridge Mountains and ripped off part of the roof of the
house where Donna Weems and her 2-year-old son had taken shelter.
``It sounded like everything in God's creation had hit that
house,'' the Lindale woman said.
   Trees blown down by the storms killed a 27-year-old Cleveland,
Ga., woman and a 25-year-old Cumming man.
   In Alabama, tornadoes and thunderstorms damaged dozens of homes
and businesses and knocked out electricity to more than 100,000
customers.
   The Legislature recessed shortly after 3:30 p.m. Tuesday when a
funnel-shaped cloud was spotted. Legislators and others evacuated
the top floors of the Montgomery building for shelter in the two
bottom floors until the weather cleared.
   South Carolina authorities reported damage to houses and mobile
homes and said some power lines had been downed.
   But Spartanburg County Sheriff's Department spokesman Mark Kruea
said: ``We were very lucky. It was not nearly as bad as it could
have been. Since there were no injuries, we all feel better.''
   In Indiana, the parents of a 16-month-old toddler swept out of
his mother's arms after the family car stalled on a flooded gravel
road kept a silent vigil Tuesday as divers searched two swollen
creeks for the body.
   The search followed a night of torrential rain and was
complicated by rising backwaters.
   ``We hope we find him but we just don't know,'' said Indiana
Conservation Officer Duane Englert, who supervised the search.
   Monday night's storm also led to the apparent electrocution of
an Indiana woman.
   In California, the temperature at the downtown Los Angeles Civic
Center soared to 100 degrees Tuesday, breaking the 18-year-old mark
by seven degrees, according to the weather service. It also tied
the all-time high for April, set on April 23, 1910. Los Angeles
International Airport's 99 degrees also hit an all-time high for
the month.
   Culver City, Montebello and Ontario also reached 100 degrees;
Long Beach, San Gabriel and Monrovia recorded temperatures of 101
and the desert community of Thermal peaked at 102.
   Los Angeles County lifeguards from Zuma Beach to the South Bay
telephoned reserves for extra help, adding dozens of lifeguards to
monitor the 100,000 beachgoers.
   At Hermosa Beach, lifeguard Ted Clair saw crowds swell to 50,000.
   ``The crowd is continuing to build,'' he said. ``It's
springtime. People are tired of skiing and want to get into their
beach mode.''
   More record-breaking heat was expected today, along with
first-stage smog alerts in the San Gabriel-Pomona area and
metropolitan Los Angeles. Hot, dry Santa Ana winds will cook
Southern California at least until the weekend, and the only relief
will be felt Thursday along the coast when the sea breeze picks up,
forecasters said.

<HEAD>Anti-Fascist Memorial Stone Put Up In Front Of Hitler's Birthplace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRAUNAU, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials today put up an
anti-fascist memorial in front of the house where Adolf Hitler was
born. The installation came just two weeks before the 100th
anniversary of his birth.
   Mayor Gerhard Skiba ordered the block, made from granite
quarried at a former Nazi death camp, to be put on public property
outside the house, which is now a school for retarded children.
   City spokesman Johann Dax said the memorial ``is to help to
express the opinion of the city of Braunau as a rebuttal to the
often one-sided sensational reporting'' on this city.
   He said it was put up without ceremony or incidents.
   Dax said he has no knowledge of Nazi demonstrations planned for
April 20 _ Hitler's 100th birthday _ but police were said to be
taking every possible precaution to avoid disturbances.
   They approved an April 20 anti-fascist demonstration by
university students, but all other rallies are banned.
   Occasional clashes between neo-Nazi activists and police have
broken out near the Hitler house, and the idea to place a plaque
was prompted by officials' desire to improve the city's image.
   City officials have long been worried by the flow of tourists
getting photographed in front of the house.
   The memorial is made of granite from the quarry of the
Mauthausen concentration camp, where tens of thousands of Jews,
gypsies and others died under the Nazi dictator. It measures 46 by
41 by 28 inches.
   An inscription says, ``For Peace, Freedom and Democracy. Never
Again Fascism. Millions of Dead Warn.''

<HEAD>Soviet Official Blames Father for Young Chess Player's Defection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 14-year-old Soviet chess whiz who defected last
week in New York is the victim of exploitation by his money-hungry
father, a Soviet chess official was quoted today as saying.
   Gata Kamsky ``is destined to become a robot for earning dollars,
and his father has consciously agreed to that,'' Alexander Roshal,
editor of the Soviet chess journal 64-Chess Review, told the
newspaper Sovietsky Sport.
   A friend of the Kamsky family, chess champion Lev Alburt, said
in New York last week that the boy defected with his father because
he wanted the freedom to make choices about his chess career and
his personal future. Alburt is a Soviet grand master who defected
10 years ago.
   Roshal maintained that the Kamsky family had been very well
treated by the Soviet chess establishment, and it called their
defection a case of ``the blackest ingratitude.''
   Roshal told Sovietsky Sport that Kamsky had played in five
masters tournaments over the last year, placing average or lower in
all of them. He defected during the New York Open tournament, at
which he was the youngest member of the Soviet delegation.
   Roshal accused Kamsky's father, Rustem, of pressuring his son so
heavily that the boy's performance suffered.
   ``Acting as coach and manager of his son, he demanded results
from Gata whatever the cost, without stopping short of beating him,
according to many accounts,'' Roshal was quoted as saying.
   Asked if he thought Kamsky had turned from a ``caring daddy''
into a ``greedy exploiter,'' Roshal said, ``It looks that way.''
   Gata Kamsky has been called the Soviet Union's leading young
chess player. World champion Garry Kasparov and other experts have
predicted Kamsky will reach the highest echelons of chess play.
   Other top Soviet chess players who defected include former world
championship finalist Victor Korchnoi, who now plays for
Switzerland, and International Master Igor Ivanov, now Canada's
second-ranked player.

   Carlsbad (N.M.) Current-Argus on the Alaska oil spill:
   With 10 million gallons of crude oil threatening wildlife and
fouling the pristine beauty of Alaska's Prince William Sound, the
oil industry's repeated assurances that it can protect the
environment assume a particularly hollow ring. ...
   In Washington, the repercussions of the oil spill will be felt
for months ... as environmentalists fight to keep oil developers
out of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
   President ... Bush favors exploratory drilling in the refuge if
it can be done without harming the environment.
   It is estimated that the coastal strip could produce as much as
3.2 billion barrels of oil and keep the Alaska pipeline working at
full spate long after the North Slope oilfields have been exhausted.
   If Congress is to approve such development, however, the oil
industry must demonstrate renewed dedication to legitimate
environmental concerns. ...
   One Prince William Sound disaster is one too many.

   El Paso (Texas) Herald-Post on drug testing for transportation
personnel:
   The Coast Guard says that Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, skipper of the
ill-fated Exxon Valdez (which spilled some 262,000 barrels of oil
into Alaska's Prince William Sound), had a blood test morethan 10
hours after his supertanker ran aground and showed a blood-alcohol
level far higher than allowed for ship operators.
   That fact alone should silence American Civil Liberties Union
zealots and organized labor leaders who vociferously oppose random
drug testing of personnel engaged in transportation.
   The way to weed out drug and alcohol abusers from sensitive
airline, shipping, rail, bus and trucking jobs is to test them
before, and not only after, they cause terrible accidents.

   Syracuse (N.Y.) Herald-Journal on a bank account for a spy:
   It is galling to think that an American who betrayed his country
is having a nest egg built for him while he awaits his release from
prison. But the United States ... can make sure Jonathan Pollard
never collects a dime.
   The former U.S. intelligence analyst was convicted two years ago
of providing American secrets to the Israelis. According to a
report in this week's Newsweek magazine, Israel is putting $5,000 a
month in an Israeli bank account for Pollard, who is serving a life
sentence in an Illinois federal prison. The scenario is that
Pollard eventually will be deported to Israel, where the money will
be waiting for him.
   This would be an outrage if the solution weren't so obvious:
Don't let Pollard go. He has been sentenced to life. Make him serve
every day of his sentence.

   St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times on bank deposit insurance:
   Large American banks are getting a free ride on some $350
billion in deposits at their foreign branches.
   Because the funds are nominally uninsured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., they pay no insurance premiums.
   Should any of those banks fail, however, the government most
likely would be obliged to protect all the depositors.
   In that light, they ought to be assessed for premiums.

   McPherson (Kan.) Sentinel on the Bush administration's slow
start:
   In office less than three months, the Bush administration has
been criticized for getting off to a slow start.
   In part, of course, that may be attributed to the time required
for presidential appointments in the face of a Congress that seems
intent on casting aspersion on the administration by innuendo.
   Even without that, however, it appears the only person in charge
of any policy-making is Secretary of State James Baker.
   That leaves a huge void in matters relating to the domestic
economy, which is perhaps this country's most pressing need.
   The Reagan administration was successful because it had its
policies clearly defined.
   The Bush administration needs to do the same before all of the
bureaucrats have taken firm control. It should make its first
priority domestic policy.

   The Orange County (Calif.) Register on raising federal salaries:
   Read our lips: No pay raise for congressmen and government
bosses. So Americans resoundingly insisted last month.
   Radio talk shows lit up the airwaves with attacks on the
proposal, by a presidential commission, to raise ... pay 51
percent. ...
   Even though Congress had rigged the system so the raise would
become automatic, public rage forced the members to rescind it. ...
   But (last) week another panel, the National Commision on Public
Service, called for the same thing: a 50 percent pay raise for our
allegedly impoverished servants in Washington. ...
   Presumably one might pay the current bureaucrats more to attract
better people to the job in the future.
   But, as the failed nomination of John Tower as defense secretary
shows, people are willing to go to absurd lengths to get these
``low-paying'' jobs.

   The Duluth (Minn.) News-Tribune on raising federal salaries:
   It might have some sugar coating this time around, but the
``new'' pay proposal for members of Congress, U.S. judges and other
top federal officials has a strange familiarity to it. ...
   (Last) week the National Commission on Public Service, a private
body looking into federal pay, recommended to President Bush that
top officials, judges and Congress get a pay raise nearly as large
as the one Congress killed in February.
   This one would be spoon-fed _ to the public _ by giving the
Honorables 25 percent the first year and the rest in early 1991. ...
   It is better than the earlier version because, if adopted
intact, it would forbid senators and representatives from accepting
honoraria for speechifying _ a means many use to swell their
current income well into the six-figure category.
   President Bush is pondering the new recommendations. He should
ponder for a long time and then come up with a pay plan more in
line with prudent spending. How about a couple of 10 percent jumps
_ still greater than most Americans got last year _ and then
another look?

   The Daily Journal, Elizabeth, N.J., on polling places' closing
time:
   Broadcast networks relied on exit polling to project winners in
states where the polls were still open at the time of the broadcast.
   Such projections kept people away from polls because they were
being told how their candidate fared before they had a chance to
exercise their own voting franchise.
   Legislation ... would set the national poll closing time at 9
p.m. Eastern Standard Time.
   There is a competing bill ... that would mandate the closing of
polls at 7 p.m. on the West Coast, 8 p.m. in the Rockies, 9 p.m. in
the Central states, and 10 p.m. on the East Coast.
   With either measure, the impetus to establish a national closing
time for polls in presidental years now exists. It should be
pursued to completion because its the only way to ensure equality
in selecting our leaders.

   Whether it's a bargaining ploy or another publicity stunt, the
proposal presented via one of Marcos' attorneys looks like an
insult to American intelligence, if not to our hospitality. ...
   What we may have on the medical bills caper is a kind of

   As Gore admonishes, ``Unless we quickly and profoundly change
the course of our civilization, we face an immediate and grave
danger of destroying the worldwide ecological system that sustains
life as we know it.'' ...
   And now the president who told us he was an environmentalist has
given us an administration with a deeply divided personality when
it comes to matters of the environment. ...

anointed to run the Interior Department is that we humans are

   The News and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on Three Mile Island's
legacy:
   It seems almost incredible that 10 years have flown by since the
``accident'' at Three Mile Island.
   It seems incredible, too, that this one misfortune, bred more by
gross negligence on the part of the operators than by any inherent
design faults in the nuclear power plant there, should have stopped
an entire industry dead in its tracks. ...
   Historians one day will look back on the incident at Three Mile
Island and shake their heads in wonder at America's reaction to it.
   Perhaps then, if we are lucky, scientists will have harnessed a
new form of energy _ clean efficient and safe solar cells, nuclear
fusion, or things undreamed of today.
   If we are not lucky, those who survive may live in a dark and
desolate world, where the sea rolls 40 fathoms deep over
once-lovely coastal cities ..., and the sun, dull red, burns in a
yellow, birdless sky.

   The Intelligencer, Wheeling, W.Va., on curbing acid rain:
   During his campaign for the presidency, George Bush promised
acid rain legislation. The White House chief of staff, former New
Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, has fought for pollution reduction for
years. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, long has
pushed for passage of acid rain legislation.
   Given these political imperatives, it is obvious that this is
the year an acid rain bill is going to pass Congress, although coal
industry officials remain unconvinced that there is any real need
for such legislation. ...
   Proposed legislation which has aroused substantial support has
resulted from an unlikely coalition _ Rich Trumka, president of the
United Mine Workers, and Sen. Mitchell.
   Their bill calls for having electricity consumers pay a small
fee of about 75 cents a month to help defray industry's cost of
installing new scrubbers in order to meet a goal of reducing the
level of sulphur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons. ...
   The Mitchell-Trumka bill appears to be about as good a deal on
acid rain as the industry can expect.

   Good. The wonder is that, after years of terrorist activity
involving commercial aircraft, such an initiative is only now
getting under way.
   Aviation authorities here and abroad seem agreed on asserting
that all appropriate precautions were taken prior to the Pan AM 103
disaster at Lockerbie in December. These protestations do not
wholly jibe with the facts that have come to light. ...
   We are inclined to concur in the advice of Sen. Alfonse M.
D'Amato of New York in a letter to Skinner and Secreary of State
James A. Baker: ``The entire process of receiving and evaluating
security information must be reviewed from top to bottom.''

   The Natchez (Miss.) Democrat on private school tuition tax
credits:
   President Bush took the correct position when he came down on
the side of public education and said he does not support the idea
of tuition tax credits for parents of children in private schools.
   Bush's statement runs counter to the general position taken
during the Reagan administration.
   The president is correct in stating that people have the right
to choose to send their children to a private or parochial school.
   However, the public school system must be kept strong for the
good of the entire community. It must have the resources to do that
job.
   If those resources were diluted by tuition tax credits for
parents of private school students, it would make an uphill battle
even more difficult.

   Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Islamic fundamentalism:

Cultural Revolution in China initiated by Mao Zedong in 1966 to
``complete'' the Communist revolution of 1949.
   That devastating crusade against everything not totally Marxist
lasted until his death in 1976 _ a disquieting omen for any
suggestion of change in Iran's new course so long as (Ayatollah

<TEXT>
   An AIDS patient who sued his doctor for
negligence reached a six-figure settlement with him today shortly
before a jury returned with a verdict in favor of the physician.
   Robert Taylor, 36, of Norfolk, had sued Dr. Duane G. Wombolt, a
kidney specialist, alleging that the doctor failed to tell him that
he had tested positive for antibodies to the AIDS virus and had
given him medication that hastened the onset of the fatal disease.
   After a weeklong trial, a Circuit Court jury began deliberating
late Tuesday. Before jurors returned with a verdict this morning,
lawyers reached a settlement that both sides said was in six
figures.
   Judge John Winston told jurors that a settlement had been
reached and did not let them announce their verdict.
   ``We had decided for the defendant, Dr. Wombolt,'' said one
juror who asked not to be identified. ``All the facts in the case
pointed to the fact that he was absolutely reasonable in everything
he did.''
   ``I feel a little cheated, in a way,'' said John Heilig, an
attorney for Wombolt, on learning that the verdict would have been
in his client's favor.
   ``I'm elated,'' Taylor said, when asked about the settlement.
Taylor, who is thin and has facial lesions caused by AIDS, said he
plans to use the money to travel and for charitable causes,
including perhaps an AIDS hospice.
   Heilig said he and Wombolt agreed to settle because they were
concerned that the jury might be hung.
   Heilig said Wombolt admitted to no wrongdoing in his treatment
of Taylor.
   ``He did nothing wrong,'' Heilig said.
   Taylor, a former waiter, testified last week that he asked
Wombolt in December 1986 whether he might have AIDS and the doctor
told him he had no symptoms of the disease.
   Wombolt said a hospital that tested Taylor for AIDS never told
him what the test showed, so he assumed the test was negative.
   Taylor's physician, Dr. John F. Warner, testified that Taylor's
kidneys are functioning close to normal but he will probably die of
AIDS within a year.

   A Czechoslovak court today sentenced a
Charter 77 human rights activist to a 13-month suspended sentence
for inciting rebellion and trying to harm state interests, emigre
sources said.
   The sources, who demanded anonymity, said another court
acquitted an actress accused of interfering with a state
investigation of an activist.
   The activist, Tomas Hradilek, was convicted and sentenced to 13
months by a court in Moravia, but the sentence was suspended two
years, said the sources.
   The sources said another court in Moravia acquitted Eva
Vidlarova, who was charged with obstructing the execution of a
state decision. If convicted, she could have been jailed up to five
years.
   Ms. Vidlarova, a leading actress in Brno, Moravia, was detained
Dec.19 after she allegedly obstructed a legal investigation against
another independent cultural activist.
   Charges against Hradilek, a spokesman for the Charter 77 human
rights group, were based on two letters he wrote last month to
Communist Party leader Milos Jakes and President Gustav Husak
protesting police violence used to break up peaceful gatherings in
January.
   On Tuesday, a Prague municipal court upheld sentences against
seven activists charged in connection with the banned January
demonstrations.
   They included a second Charter spokesman, Alexander Vondra.
Another group spokesman, Dana Nemcova, is hospitalized, but also
faces charges of hooliganism connected to the January rallies.
   Also Tuesday, activist Jaroslav Popelka was sentenced to four
months' jail for disturbing public order by distributing leaflets
calling for genuine reform and environmental protection.

<HEAD>Assistant DA's Involved In Adams Case Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two prosecutors involved in the case of ``The Thin
Blue Line'' defendant Randall Dale Adams have resigned.
   The Dallas Morning News today quoted an unidentified source who
said the assistant district attorneys' resignations this week were
related to the office's handling of the case.
   ``It's just time to move on,'' John Creuzot, 31, told the
newspaper. Creuzot had been with the Dallas County district
attorney's office more than six years. The other prosecutor
resigning was Leslie McFarlane, 32.
   The district attorney's office had come under national scrutiny
for its handling of Adams' conviction and retrial attempts. Adams
was imprisoned for 12 years, during one period when he was
condemned to death, for the 1976 slaying of Dallas police officer
Robert Wood.
   Adams was freed March 22 and District Attorney John Vance
announced the next day 23 that his office would not retry Adams
because of a lack of evidence and witnesses.
   The case was featured in last year's film documentary ``The Thin
Blue Line,'' directed by Errol Morris, which questioned Adams'
conviction.
   Creuzot and Ms. McFarlane represented the district attorney's
office in the December hearing at which state District Judge Larry
Baraka recommended a new trial for Adams.
   The two filed a brief with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
saying the district attorney's office didn't object to a new trial.
   Ms. McFarlane also testified that former assistant district
attorney Doug Mulder, the original prosecutor, suppressed evidence
in the 1977 trial.
   Assistant District Attorney Winfield Scott, who was involved in
jury selection in the original trial and was responsible for the
case during retrial hearings, had criticized Ms. McFarlane for not
being more aggressive.
   Both resignations take effect this month. McFarlane and Creuzot
reportedly were starting private law practices.

   A former librarian who fired an assault
rifle into two crowded shopping centers, killing six people and
wounding 10, was convicted of murder today by a jury that rejected
his claim of insanity.
   William Bryan Cruse, 61, was convicted on all 32 counts related
to the April 23, 1987, shootings at two Palm Bay shopping centers,
including charges of first-degree murder, attempted murder and
kidnapping.
   Sentencing was set for April 17. The state is seeking the death
penalty. Cruse pleaded innocent by reason of temporary insanity.
   Prosecutors had contended Cruse acted out of anger over
delusions that people in the shopping centers considered him
homosexual.
   Final arguments depicted Cruse as a madman who should be
institutionalized or as a calculating killer who deserves to be
executed.
   After shooting at everything that moved outside a Publix
supermarket and later at the Winn-Dixie across the street, the
gunman shot up the front windows of the Winn-Dixie and stormed in,
shooting wildly as dozens of customers ran out the back.
   Cruse held a hostage seven hours before releasing her unharmed.
   Cruse later told police in a videotaped interview that he was
``drunk and crazy'' during the rampage.
   Cruse has a history of mental instability and bizarre actions
dating to the 1970s in his hometown of Lexington, Ky., according to
psychiatrists and defense witnesses. He came to Florida in 1985.
   Most of the experts agreed that he has a mental illness,
paranoid schizophrenia. But that by itself is not enough to
constitute legal insanity.

   President Bush, who has said he wants to be
remembered as the education president, today sent Congress a
package he said would make educational excellence ``a classroom
reality.''
   Bush unveilled his $422 million package of measures in a Rose
Garden Ceremony at which he honored teacher of the year Mary V.
Bicouvaris.
   Mrs. Bicouvaris, a Greek immigrant who teaches American
government and international relations at Bethel High School in
Hampton, Va., ``epitomizes excellence in education,'' Bush said.
   ``We're going to take action, action to make excellence in
education not just a rallying cry but a classroom reality,'' Bush
said.
   Bush's package would carry out many of his campaign promises on
education, including $250 million in merit grants to the nation's
best schools and a new $100 million magnet school program.
   Magnet schools are those that have a special curriculum, giving
parents an option on where to send their children.
   Bush's program, many details of which had been revealed in the
budget the president submitted on Feb. 9, would also:
   _Authorize $25 million for federal grants in 1990 to states to
improve their teacher certification programs.
   _Provide $7.6 million for a three-year program of $5,000 grants
to outstanding teachers.
   _Provide $5 million for a 1990 national science scholars program
of scholarships to graduating high school students who have
excelled in mathematics or science.
   _Provide $10 million in 1990, $20 million in 1991 and 1992 and
$10 million in 1993 in new grants to historically black college and
universities.
   _Authorize $25 million a year for a three-year program of grants
to urban schools that have the most serious drug problems.
   Bush said students cannot learn ``if there's drug dealing in the
corridors.''
   ``Let teachers and students get down to the business in an
environment where learning can take place,'' he added.
   At a ceremony also attended by Education Secretary Lauro F.
Cavazos and first lady Barbara Bush, the president said, ``There
are few tasks that demand more urgent attention than the education
of our kids.''
   The Rose Garden ceremony and the submission to Congress of
Bush's education legislation capped more than a week in which Bush
has focused on educational issues, including trips to high schools
in central Pennsylvia and suburban Virginia and talks to student
groups at the White House.
   ``What goes on in the schools is important to me, and I like to
get out of the office and talk to the kids whenever the chance
presents itself,'' Bush said.
   Bush presented a crystal apple to Mrs. Bicouvaris, who on
Tuesday was named National Teacher of the Year by the Council of
Chief State School Officers, Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc. and Good
Housekeeping magazine.
   Earlier, she told reporters she intended to thank Bush for his
leadership on education issues.
   However, she also said that if Bush sought her advice, she would
``ask him to follow with the action needed to make education truly
a priority.... I would like him to put the emphasis on education as
an investment and not as an expense.''
   Bush's education package already has drawn a mixed reaction on
Capitol Hill, since administration officials have repeatedly
declined to say whether they consider the money new spending or if
the new programs must be offset by other cuts.
   In addition, an administration document released earlier this
week recommended $185 million in cuts in the Education Department.
   Some lawmakers and lobbyists have complained that Bush's
proposals are frills that would be funded at the expense of proven,
fundamental programs that have not kept pace with inflation.
   The Bush bill's chief sponsors are Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.,
and Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa.

   The government today freed more than 430
Palestinian prisoners as a Moslem holiday gesture that also
coincided with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's talks with U.S.
leaders in Washington.
   According to army figures, 224 detainees were bused to the Gaza
Strip and 210 were sent to the West Bank.
   About two dozen of the detainees knelt on the ground and uttered
prayers of thanks before being embraced by friends and relatives, a
witness in Gaza City said. One detainee said he was 12 years old.
   Israeli authorities said the releases were a gesture on the eve
of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which starts Friday.
   ``We wanted by this gesture to deliver a message to the
Palestinians in the territories that we bear in mind your holy
days,'' Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told reporters. ``Hopefully
they understand that we would like to see tranquility restored and
we can do it on the one hand by force, on the other hand by
gestures.''
   Also today, soldiers shot and wounded two Palestinians in the
occupied lands, Arab reports said. The army confirmed one wounding
_ that of a 13-year-old in a stone-throwing clash near the Balata
refugee camp in the West Bank.
   Arab reports also said a 14-year-old in Gaza City was shot and
hospitalized in serious condition.
   Israeli news reports noted that the prisoner releases came as
Shamir headed to Washington, where he was expected to come under
pressure from American leaders to take steps that would ease
tensions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Haaretz newspaper said the decision for the gesture was
timed so that the prisoners would be freed before Shamir met
President Bush.
   The prisoners freed were among about 10,000 Palestinians
believed held in connection with the nearly 16-month uprising,
which has killed at least 419 Palestinians and 18 Israelis.
   Those released had either been charged with stone-throwing
assaults on Israelis or were detained without trial as alleged
inciters of disturbances.
   In addition to the releases, Gaza's military governor, Brig.
Gen. Arieh Ramot, announced Tuesday he had ordered the army to stay
away from schools and mosques ``because I know how sensitive
Ramadan is for Moslems, and we have no intention of killing or
wounding anyone in the strip.''
   Ramadan, the most important holiday for Moslems, marks the
period when the Prophet Mohammed began receiving the Koran, or
Moslem holy book, from God.
   More than 80 percent of the 1.7 million Palestinians in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip are Moslems.
   Other measures taken by the Israelis included lifting curfews
that confined tens of thousands of Palestinians to their homes in
villages and refugee camps.
   But five refugee camps in Gaza remained under curfew, among them
Jabaliya, whose more than 50,000 residents have been kept indoors
now for eight consecutive days. Jabaliya is the camp where the
uprising started.
   The army announced today, meanwhile, that an Israeli naval
patrol stopped two Lebanese boats on their way to Cyprus on Tuesday
and detained some Palestinian guerrillas who were on board,
bringing them to Israel.
   The crew and other passengers were allowed to continue their
trip, an army spokesman said. He declined to elaborate.

   Key events in Poland's ``round-table''
talks:
   Aug. 26, 1988 _ Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, faced
with a second severe wave of strikes, proposes negotiations with
the opposition, which is led by the independent Solidarity union
movement that has refused to fade seven years after being banned
under martial law.
   Sept. 3, 1988 _ Strikes end after 19 days when Solidarity leader
Lech Walesa appeals for time to talk with the government.
   Oct. 24, 1988 _ A round, pine table is set up at a government
palace but the date for the start of the talks remains in doubt as
both sides argue.
   Nov. 25, 1988 _ With prospects for talks dim, the table is
dismantled.
   Nov. 30, 1988 _ Walesa and Alfred Miodowicz, head of the union
alliance created by the government to replace Solidarity after
martial law, hold a live television debate, and Walesa's convincing
performance rekindles plans for the talks.

Solidarity can be legalized under certain conditions, meeting
Solidarity's prerequisite for the talks.
   Jan. 22, 1989 _ Solidarity leadership agrees to negotiate with

East bloc. They also agree to create the office of the presidency,
expected to be retained by the Communist Party and its allies,
which is guaranteed a majority in the existing sejm for the first
election.
   March 22, 1989 _ The Sejm begins considering the reforms even
before end of the talks.
   April 4, 1989 _ Kiszczak and Walesa end their final meeting but
snags remain and Walesa returns to Gdansk as aides struggle to

<HEAD>Baker Aides Suggest Retaining Part of U.S. Embassy in Moscow</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The two aides Secretary of State James A.
Baker III sent to Moscow to inspect the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet
capital have recommended that part of the chancery be salvaged, a
Bush administration official said Wednesday.
   Their recommendation is to dismantle the top floors, which are
believed to be riddled with eavesdropping devices, and to replace
them with bug-free floors or an adjoining annex, said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The inspection was conducted two weeks ago by Nicholas M. Salgo,
a former U.S. ambassador to Hungary, and Ivan Selin, who is to be
undersecretary of state for management.
   They told Baker on their return that refurbishing the building
or even constructing an annex would be cheaper than razing the
chancery and starting over. The estimated cost of tearing down and
rebuilding is $500 million.
   The official said Baker would take into consideration the views
of key members of Congress. Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa, chairman of a
House appropriations subcommittee, last month opposed spending the
$500 million. Others on Capitol Hill are inclined to agree with the
conclusion last year of a Washington area engineering firm that
starting over was the only way to make the chancery secure.
   A trade group headed by Dwayne O. Andreas, chairman of Archer
Daniels Midland Co., offered to buy the building for use as
business offices.
   Andreas is co-chairman of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic
Council, which promotes trade between the two superpowers. He made
the offer on behalf of a consortium of U.S. companies, which would
use the building as a Moscow headquarters.
   The Soviets would have to approve any sale because the building
was intended for use as a new embassy, built under a 1972 agreement
between the two countries.
   A study done for the Reagan administration by former Defense
Secretary James R. Schlesinger recommended last year that the top
three floors be dismantled and rebuilt while an annex also was put
up next to the chancery.
   In 1987, Anne Armstrong, who was head of then-President Reagan's
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, called for the use of existing
technology and development of new methods to clear the chancery of
eavesdropping devices.
   Reagan last October concluded the building should be razed and
rebuilt, but that decision is under review by the Bush
administration and Baker has not decided whether to approve the
recommendations of Salgo and Selin, the U.S. official said.

   Former Baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth
has made a new pitch for strike-bound Eastern Airlines that could
win the battle for the nation's seventh-largest carrier, airline
industry and baseball sources said.
   Ueberroth traveled from his California home to New York on
Tuesday night and expected an agreement would be announced today,
barring another last-minute curveball from Texas Air Corp. Chairman
Frank Lorenzo, the sources said.
   Mary Jane Barry, head of the Eastern flight attendants union in
Miami, said Ueberroth notified her by telephone today that ``there
would be a potential sale of the airline, possibly today.''
   Ron Cole, a spokesman in Miami for the Air Line Pilots
Association, said: ``We're still clearly optimistic that there will
be a solution to our problem.''
   Robin Matell, an Eastern spokesman in Miami, said Tuesday night,
``I wouldn't have any comment on a report like that.''
   Terms of the agreement weren't known, and sources familiar with
the deal said they were worried that Lorenzo might try to change
the terms at the last minute.
   The offer was believed to be less than the $464 million that
Ueberroth's group had offered and then withdrew last week. The deal
reportedly would not include Eastern's prized Northeast shuttle.
   ``As with anything that has happened here in the last three
years, it's not soup until it's served,'' said Capt. John Knudson,
another Pilots Union spokesman.
   Eastern has been largely grounded since its Machinists union
struck March 4 and pilots and flight attendants walked out in
support. The airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on
March 9 as its cash dwindled.
   Ueberroth began negotiations with Lorenzo about three weeks ago
and had been told to expect approval of a sale when the Texas Air
board met last week, sources said.
   But at the last minute, Lorenzo told the Ueberroth group there
was a higher offer. Sources said that offer came from Hyatt Hotel
chain owner Jay A. Pritzker and was worth about $500 million.
   Ueberroth withdrew, regarding Pritzker's entry as merely an
attempt by Lorenzo to raise the price, according to baseball
sources. The former commissioner's representatives returned to New
York on Tuesday and continued negotiations, sources said.
   Sources close to Ueberroth had said Monday he was preparing a
new, lower bid because Eastern agreed Friday to sell the shuttle to
New York developer Donald J. Trump for $365 million.
   Under Ueberroth's first offer, he and J. Thomas Talbot, a former
airline executive from California, would have owned 30 percent of
the airline. Eastern's unions would have received another 30
percent in exchange for wage and work-rule concessions. The
remaining 40 percent would have been held by new investors.
   Any sale of Eastern, acquired by Texas Air in 1986 for about
$600 million, would have to be approved by a committee representing
its unsecured creditors and by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland.
   The creditors committee, which includes representatives of
Eastern's Machinists and pilots unions and non-union employees, met
Tuesday in Manhattan to discuss Eastern's future.
   Also Tuesday, congressional Democrats pulled off the Senate
floor legislation that would force President Bush to appoint an
emergency board to recommend a solution to the walkout.
   The lawmakers attributed their reversal to a desire to give
potential buyers a chance to acquire Eastern and to allow the
bankruptcy court to find a way to end the walkout.

   Switzerland is proposing a giant tower of ice as
its pavilion for the 1992 World's Fair, ensuring visitors will keep
cool beneath Seville's blistering sun.
   The design for the 100-foot tower, submitted by architect
Vincent Mangeat, won first prize among 91 entries.
   If approved, the tower will be built by pouring water into a
mold and freezing it. It would be protected from direct sunlight by
a giant triangular shade. Summer temperatures in southern Spain
average more than 85 degrees.
   Mangeat sayd the energy required to keep the tower frozen during
the six-month fair is no more than the energy consumed by a
conventional pavilion.
   And the ice pavilion won't have to be dismantled. Once the fair
is over, organizers will simply pull the refrigeration system plug
and let the tower melt away.

   The world's biggest iceberg, a
chunk of ice the size of Hong Kong, is drifting about 1\ miles a
day in Antarctica's Ross Sea and has begun forming a ``winter
coat,'' a scientist said Wednesday.
   The iceberg, codenamed ``B-9,'' measures 95 miles in length _
the biggest iceberg ever reliably measured, said Conservation
Department official Harry Keys.
   Fresh ice was forming around it with the approach of winter in
the Southern Hemisphere, he said.
   The iceberg poses no danger to shipping and is located about 300
miles northeast of the U.S. McMurdo research station, where up to
700 people live during the Antarctic summer, he said. It broke off
from the Ross Ice Shelf 18 months ago and is drifting in a circle.
   ``Also, it is moving too slowly to affect shipping, and since it
is recorded on weather charts, mariners know exactly where it it,''
Keys said.
   Although slowly melting, it could take three years before the
massive slab of ice reaches the open sea and starts to
disintegrate, he said.
   ``Sooner or later it will get into a current and move toward the
open sea,'' Keys said. ``It's certainly not going to go away
tomorrow. We knew from the start it would be around for a while.''
   Keys said the dimensions of B-9 roughly correspond to the size
of Hong Kong, a British colony off the coast of China that is
inhabited by 5 million people.
   Keys said B-9 broke away from the Ice Ross Shelf in October 1987
and had drifted more than 680 miles since then, providing
scientists with information about Antarctic sea currents around the
frozen southern continent.

<HEAD>Filmmaker Andrzej Wajda Approved as Theater Director</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Poland, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reknowned filmmaker Andrzej Wajda, often
at odds with the government and at times forbidden to show his
works, has been approved as artistic director of a prestigious
official Warsaw theater.
   Wajda's nomination, put forth by the theater's actors, was
approved Tuesday by authorities as the economically pressed
government tries to build an atmosphere of reform.
   ``We now find ourselves in the most difficult situation since
1945,'' he said. ``Our audiences are so tired from everyday life
that they cannot think of art.''
   His films have chronicled resistance fighters during World War
II, the dehumanization of Stalinism and the birth of the
independent trade union Solidarity. Deeply rooted in Poland, Wajda
has continued to work here rather than leave, as have other
cultural figures seeking greater artistic freedom.
   Wajda said the government retains its influence in the arts by
its control over the economy.
   Wajda, who leads the culture commission of the Citizen's
Committee, an opposition shadow government formed by Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa, saw his award-winning film on the union, ``Man
of Iron,'' return to a Warsaw theater in February for the first
time since its premiere before the 1981 martial-law crackdown.
   Wajda's appointment at Teatr Powszechny _ he replaces the late
Zygmunt Hubner, who offered him the first opportunity to move from
film to theater in 1956 _ comes as other banned cultural and
political figures are allowed to surface in official settings.
   Wajda, who presided at a forum on independent culture last
weekend, emphasized that ``there is only good and bad art and it
can be independent or not. But we would not like to make
differences betweeen official culture and non-official culture.''
   Teatr Powszechny, established in 1944, was the first theater to
open in postwar Warsaw. Wajda directed the first play at the
theater in 1975 when it reopened after five years of renovations.
   The theater created a stir in February when it presented a play
by Vaclav Havel, the jailed Czechoslovak writer. Polish Prime
Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski attended the opening.
   ``It is our duty to support artists and their freedom as we are
part of this group of people who try to create art involved in
reality,'' Wajda said.
   Although best known for his movies, Wajda said ``film is an art
that exists today and can disappear tomorrow if there is a new
technique found ... Whereas theater will live eternally ... People
will always come to listen to others conversing in an intelligent
way.''
   Wajda said theater ``should be less dependent on the moment than
cinema. Theater is not here to give us immediate answers to
questions, it responds to more general problems.''
   The director said he is preparing a documentary on the massacre
of more than 4,000 Polish army officers _ including his father _ at
Katyn in the Soviet Union in 1940.
   Although official histories in Poland and the Soviet Union have
blamed the Nazis for the massacre, a Polish-Soviet review under way
could lead to the conclusion widely held in the West that Soviet
secret police actually committed the atrocity.
   The director said he started the documentary last year and may
visit Katyn with families of victims later this month.
   Wajda said he is concerned by the tendency to blame Katyn and
many other repressions on ``Stalinism.'' ``I do not see any
guarantee that this will not come back,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The woman known as ``Jane Roe'' in the landmark
Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion has gone into hiding
indefinitely after three shotgun blasts were fired at her home and
car, her roommate said.
   ``She's real emotional right now,'' Connie Gonzales, Norma
McCorvey's roommate, said Tuesday. ``She cries and cries. We just
want to stop her crying.''
   FBI agents and the Dallas Police Department were conducting
separate investigations into the 4:45 a.m. shootings Tuesday at Ms.
McCorvey's home.
   ``We've got no leads, no suspects,'' said Sgt. Ron Ellison.
``There were three shots fired from a .410-gauge shotgun.''
   The gunfire damaged windows in Ms. McCorvey's car and two
windows in her home, he said.
   ``It knocked the glass out of the back of the vehicle and I
believe it shattered one of the windows in the living room and
another in the front door,'' Ellison said.
   Ms. McCorvey was the plaintiff in Roe vs. Wade, which resulted
in the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision, and has been organizing a
pro-choice Jane Roe Foundation.
   She told police she believes the shots were intended for her
because she plans to attend a weekend march and rally in Washington
sponsored by the National Organization for Women to support
legalized abortion.
   Ms. Gonzales told The Dallas Morning News that Ms. McCorvey was
not available for comment and that the two were going into hiding
indefinitely while their house remained under surveillance.
   ``There are some sick people out there,'' Ms. Gonzales told the
newspaper.
   Bill Price, president of the Greater Dallas Right to Life
Commission, said he will be ``totally surprised'' if investigators
find a link between the shooting incident and Ms. McCorvey's stance
on abortion.
   ``Certainly I hope it didn't have anything to do with that,''
Price said. ``I don't know what else she may be involved in. But
this would be the worst possible way in which to try and protest
and stop abortion.''
   In recent years, Ms. McCorvey's home and car have been egged,
she has found baby clothes scattered in her yard and she has
received hate mail. But Ms. Gonzales said Ms. McCorvey never before
felt personally threatened and Ellison said she did not tell police
about any previous incidents.
   ``It's frightening for Norma that after all these years she is
now willing to come out and be public about her role in the
pro-choice movement and she has to now deal with this,'' said Janie
Bush, president of the Texas Abortion Rights Action League.

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa and a government minister
today concluded a historic pact to legalize the independent
Solidarity trade union after a seven-year ban and to hold Poland's
first free elections since World War II.
   The Solidarity leader, representing the opposition, and the
interior minister, Gen. Czeszlaw Kiszczak, endorsed hundreds of
pages of agreements hammered out during intensive talks on Poland's
political and economic reforms.
   They approved the pact as the 57 participants in the 2-month-old
negotiations, known as the round-table talks, gathered for one last
time at the Council of Ministers Palace.
   ``There is no freedom without Solidarity,'' Walesa said at the
beginning of a brief speech explaining why the opposition had
approved the agreements.
   ``I think that the round-table talks can become the beginning of
the road to democracy and a free Poland, and hence we look with
boldness and hope into the future,'' he said.
   When Walesa was asked earlier today when he thought Solidarity
would be legalized, he replied, ``I think immediately after
signing.''
   Kiszczak opened the meeting with a speech lauding the talks that
brought together all sides of the nation's splintered political
spectrum.
   ``This documentation is a social contract,'' he said. ``We
declare the will to fulfill honestly the agreement we symbolically
conclude today.''
   He called the debates a ``first, extremely significant step''
and said the talks can be ``a priceless element in the
accomplishment of our work.''
   The meeting was preceded by separate signings of agreements on
economic, political and trade union reforms by the opposition and
government officials.
   After the speeches by Walesa and Kiszczak, a break was called in
the meeting. The two men endorsed the agreements verbally. It was
not clear whether they would sign a general statement of agreement
as well.
   As early as this morning it was not clear if Solidarity intended
to sign the accords, especially after a dispute with the officially
backed OPZZ trade unions over the formula adopted for compensating
workers for inflation as part of the economic agreement.
   But Walesa told the National Executive Commission of Solidarity
during a closed-door, three-hour meeting that the union had
achieved its main goal in the talks _ legalization _ and it could
better fight for further economic and political reforms after it is
registered and organized.
   The Executive Commission authorized Walesa to sign the
agreements, clearing the final hurdle to the late-afternoon,
round-table meeting with Kiszcak.
   The government agreed in August to hold the talks in return for
an end to a series of crippling strikes.
   The negotiators agreed to amend the present trade union law to
allow legalization of Solidarity, registration of farmers' Rural
Solidarity and the reinstatement of workers fired for Solidarity
activities after the December 1981 crackdown that quashed the trade
union movement.
   On Tuesday, negotiators agreed to a plan that would bring the
opposition into the Sejm, the one-house parliament, as a minority
party. Under the plan, a freely elected Senate and a powerful
presidency would be established.
   Walesa said the union did not get everything it wanted in the
agreement but said other issues could be addressed later, ``when we
are a legal union.''
   Solidarity became the first legal, independent union movement in
the Soviet bloc when it was chartered in the fall of 1980 during
nationwide strikes. It was suspended in the 1981 military crackdown
and later outlawed.
   A parliamentary spokesman confirmed that the present one-house
parliament would meet Friday to enact the accords.
   Under the agreement, the opposition would join in elections in
June that would guarantee the Communist Party and its allies 65
percent of the Sejm's 460 seats. That ratio will apply only this
year; later elections will be more democratic.
   A presidency and a Senate of about 100 members would be created.
The Senate would be elected freely and probably would be controlled
by the opposition. The Senate would advise the Sejm and exercise
veto powers over its bills.
   The president would be elected this year by the Sejm and Senate
for a six-year term. The nation's leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski,
the Communist Party chief, would be expected to win the
presidential election.

   A boat carrying 152 Vietnamese

   The refugees were turned over to officials at Kuala Trengganu,
located 180 miles northeast of Kuala Lumpur, before they were sent
to camps, the agency said.
   Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries recently began a
new policy of not automatically considering Vietnamese who arrive
on their shores eligible for resettlement in Western nations. Under
the new policy, Vietnamese must prove they faced political
persecution in their homeland.
   There are about 16,500 Vietnamese refugees in Malaysia awaiting
resettlement, compared to the peak of 76,500 in June 1979.

   They were chosen by Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the new
Republican whip.
   Gingrich selected activist, philosophically different
congressmen. Walker, from the conservative wing, is known for
maneuvers on the House floor aimed at foiling Democratic
initiatives. Gunderson is a leader among more moderate Republicans
who have tried to push alternatives to Democratic legislation.
   The job of a whip organization is to develop and enforce party
positions.
   ``With this team, we hope we can manufacture the kind of votes

   A South Korean dissident clergyman said Wednesday
he believes his secret visit to North Korea for talks with
President Kim Il Sung on reunification was a success.
   The Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, an adviser to South Korea's main
dissident United National Democratic Movement, arrived in Tokyo on
Wednesday following an unauthorized, nine-day visit to North Korea
via Japan and China.
   He said he plans to go back to Seoul before April 14. South
Korea says the 71-year-old Princeton-educated Protestant minister
will be arrested for violating national security laws by serving
North Korean interests.
   ``I was not afraid of being arrested before. But I really hope
such an unfortunate development will not occur this time,'' Moon
said.
   He has been arrested and imprisoned several times since the
mid-1970s for anti-government activity.
   North Korea has warned that Moon's arrest would rupture an
ongoing dialogue between Seoul and the communist government in
Pyongyang.
   Moon said he had four meetings totaling nearly 10 hours with Kim
to exchange ``frank and a wide range of views.''
   ``I told him it would be a shame and tragedy if the division of
Korea is prolonged more than half a century, and he agreed that we
all should exert all-out efforts to reunify the country at least
before the 50th year of the territorial split,'' Moon said.
   Korea was divided at the end of World War II in 1945, and the
two nations fought a war 1950-53.
   The nations are involved in a variety of contacts ranging from a
possible non-aggression pact to trade, sports and cultural
exchanges. Some talks have stalled because North Korean protests
over recently concluded U.S.-South Korean military exercises.
   ``I would say it was a success in that I have just initiated a
move to discuss problems related to reunification on the peoples'
level,'' Moon said. However, he said he met only with communist
leaders and 18 of his relatives living in North Korea.
   He said he hoped Seoul would understand contacts between the
general public in the divided halves ``are as important as those
between government delegates.''
   Many South Koreans, who hold Kim responsible for the Korean War,
expressed anger at televised scenes of Moon hugging Kim.
   Moon was the first prominent South Korean dissident living in
South Korea to visit North Korea secretly and meet with Kim since
the war hardened enmity. A joint statement issued in Pyongyang
described Moon's visit as ``an inspiring dynamism for our nation''
that could help in ``clearing away the longstanding mistrust and
hostility between the North and the South.''

<HEAD>First Peace Corps Volunteers Coming to China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Peace Corps will dispatch its first
volunteers to China this summer, a group of 20 people to teach
English in southwestern China's Sichuan province.
   ``The Peace Corps is extremely excited about having people in
China,'' said Kathleen Corey, the American volunteer group's
training director for China. ``We're really happy to become a part
of opening the doors of China.''
   China will become the 65th nation and the first socialist
country with a Peace Corps program.
   Winston Lord, U.S. ambassador to China, and Ge Shouqin,
secretary general of the China Education Association for
International Exchanges, exchanged letters Wednesday on the Peace
Corps program.
   Ms. Corey said the first group will arrive in August following
an 11-week training program in Washington. They are to teach
English at three teacher training colleges, a medical college and
an animal husbandry college in the provincial capital of Chengdu,
Mianyang and two other Sichuan cities.
   She said the Chinese will decide after a year whether to
continue with the pilot program, but the volunteers are expected to
stay for the ordinary two-year term. ``Nobody thinks this isn't
going to work,'' she said.
   ``We definitely hope for expansion into other provinces and into
other technical fields,'' she said.
   Ms. Corey said many Americans, some who speak Chinese, have
applied for the China program, and they will be very selective in
choosing the first volunteers.
   She said one challenge will be for the volunteers to convince
their Chinese hosts that ``they don't want to be set apart as
guests. They don't want to be behind walls.''
   She said that during a recent three-week tour of Sichuan she
explained to the colleges receiving volunteers that one objective
of Peace Corps volunteers is to become part of the community they
are working in.
   Since opening to the outside world 10 years ago, China has
recruited what it calls ``foreign experts'' to help in its
modernization drive.
   Most of the estimated 20,000 foreigners in China, while
receiving salaries well below what they could earn in their own
countries, are provided with living quarters far better than those
of the average Chinese and tend to be isolated from their Chinese
colleagues.
   The Peace Corps, which has about 5,500 overseas volunteers, has
been sending American teachers, technicians, professionals and
community workers to foreign cities and villages since 1961.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Fairness Doctrine Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee on Wednesday approved a
bill that would write into law a Fairness Doctrine requiring
broadcasters to air opposing sides of controversial issues.
   The House Energy and Commerce telecommunications and finance
subcommittee, on a voice vote, sent the bill to the full Energy and
Commerce Committee, after amending the measure to assure
broadcasters that violation of the Fairness Doctrine would not be a
criminal act.
   In further attempt to respond to broadcaster concerns, the
amendment, as proposed by subcommittee chairman Edward J. Markey,
D-Mass., also said the Fairness Doctrine ``only requires more
speech'' and has ``no chilling effect on broadcasters.''
   Rep. Matthew Rinaldo of New Jersey, the subcommittee's ranking
Republican, said the Fairness Doctrine ``is not the unblinking eye
of government on broadcasters'' but is only a ``mild means'' of
assuring they provide adequate coverage of important issues.
   The bill, titled the Fairness in Broadcasting Act of 1989, was
introduced in January by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of
the full committee. Co-sponsors included Markey and a number of
Republicans and is widely expected to pass the House.
   Dingell's committee was expected to take up the bill quickly.
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senate Commerce,
Science and Transportation communications subcommittee, has
introduced a companion Fairness Doctrine bill in the Senate.
   The Federal Communications Commission repealed its 40-year-old
Fairness Doctrine in 1987. A federal appeals court in February
ruled that the FCC had the statutory authority to do so, but the
court did not rule on the issue of the doctrine's constitutionality.
   If Congress writes the doctrine into law, a Supreme Court test
is likely.
   President Bush said while campaigning last year that he would
veto any Fairness Doctrine bill, as President Reagan did in June
1987 after it was passed by Congress.
   The House passed a Fairness Doctrine bill again last year, but
it did not come to a vote in the Senate.
   The FCC in August 1987 struck down two parts of the doctrine.
The first part required broadcasters ``to provide coverage of
vitally important controversial issues of interest in the community
served by the licensees.'' The second said broadcasters must
``provide a reasonable opportunity for the presentation of
contrasting viewpoints on such issues.''
   The commission left intact a provision that broadcasters must
give coverage to ballot issues.
   In Wednesday's discussion of the amendment, Markey noted
testimony before the subcommittee earlier this year in which
Fairness Doctrine proponents said their survey of television
stations showed station managers often were not aware of the ballot
obligation.

<HEAD>Cigarette Smoking Boosts Metabolism, Burns 100 Calories a Day</HEAD>

   People who smoke while they work typically burn up
an extra 100 calories a day, a discovery that helps explain why
most put on weight when they give up cigarettes, researchers report.
   Experts long have suspected that smoking boosts the body's
metabolism. But the new research shows that this effect is
significantly greater if people smoke while they are busy, instead
of only when resting.
   The finding also helps explain while some people put on more
weight than others when they stop smoking.
   ``If people tend to smoke only while they are on coffee breaks
or while relaxing at home watching TV, they won't gain as much
weight'' when they quit, said Dr. Kenneth A. Perkins. ``Those who
smoke while active are likely to be thinner to begin with because
of their smoking,'' so they risk putting on more when they stop.
   Researchers long have wondered why people usually gain a few
pounds when they quit cigarettes. Studies have shown people often
eat more food, especially sugar, after quitting, but there also was
evidence that they burn fewer calories.
   The new research, based on measurements of the effects of
nicotine, suggests that the drug's effect on the body's metabolism
_ the rate at which it uses up calories _ is significantly more
important than experts had suspected.
   The research, conducted by Perkins and colleagues at the
University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, was published in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Nancy A. Rigotti of Harvard
said the team made ``an important contribution'' to understanding
the way smoking affects metabolism.
   ``Until our cultural obsession with slenderness abates,'' she
wrote, ``we must pay more attention to the way weight gain impedes
efforts to stop smoking if we are to continue the progress of the
past quarter century toward a smoke-free society.''
   Smokers on average weigh five to 10 pounds less than
non-smokers, and they usually put on this much weight after they
give up cigarettes.
   Studies by Perkins and others suggest that smokers are thinner
because nicotine somehow makes their bodies burn more calories.
Until now, this effect has been studied only when people are
completely inactive, and the impact of nicotine appeared to be
slight, raising the metabolism about 5 percent.
   However, Perkins noted that people often smoke while working,
walking and moving about. So he studied the effects of nicotine
during light exercise to more closely mirror real life.
   He found that nicotine during exercise boosted metabolism about
12 percent. He calculated that someone who smokes steadily through
the day will burn up an extra 100 calories, about two-thirds of
them while active and the remainder while resting.
   The loss of 100 calories a day could add up to about 10 pounds
of lost weight a year.
   However, Perkins said the news is not all bad for people
thinking about quitting, because they can make up for their slower
metabolic rates by getting some extra exercise.
   ``All you would need to do is walk about a mile extra a day to
counter that,'' he said. ``That's not as hard as it sounds.''
   He said people should also remember that gaining a few pounds
after giving up cigarettes is harmless, while continuing to smoke
is a major health hazard.

   An air force pilot from Taiwan who defected to
mainland China has been made a ranking officer in the communist air
force, the government said Wednesday.
   Lt. Col. Lin Xianshun was given the same rank he held in
Taiwan's air force. He was also appointed deputy chief of staff at
a Chinese military institute, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   Lin, 35, flew his F-5E fighter across the 110-mile wide Taiwan
Strait to southeastern China's Guangdong province on Feb. 11, the
news agency said.
   Lin said he defected because he wanted to visit his ancestral
home in Guangdong. Although Taiwan's government in 1987 lifted a
ban on visits to the mainland, military personnel and government
workers are not allowed to go.
   Chinese Nationalists set up a rival government on the island
province of Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war on the mainland
to the communists. They still claim to be the rightful rulers of
all China. More than a dozen Nationalist air force officers have
defected to the mainland since 1949.

<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Wednesday that
10 states will share in a $2 million program that will let
low-income families spend government coupons at farmers' markets, a
test project ordered by Congress.
   Participants must already be in the government's WIC program,
which provides special supplemental food for women, infants and
children.
   Assistant Secretary John W. Bode, who oversees department food
and consumer services, said the project ``will test a concept
intended to improve the diets of women and children while also
helping farmers'' boost sales of fresh produce.
   Participating states and the federal grants for 1989 are
Connecticut, $164,800; Iowa, $264,600; Maryland, $52,200;
Massachusetts, $235,000; Michigan, $115,800; New York, $509,600;
Pennsylvania, $167,400; Texas, $416,800; Vermont, $40,800; and
Washington, $51,000.
   The project, which will operate during the growing and
harvesting season, was included in the Hunger Prevention Act of
1988 and was authorized for three years. The $2 million currently
available for 1989 will provide approximately 88,000 participants
with a federal benefit of about $20 for the year.
   Bode said states may use their own matching funds to serve
additional people or increase the value of benefits. Additional
federal funding will depend on future appropriations.
   The law also directed USDA to report to Congress about the
project and how it worked.
   Nationally, the WIC program serves 3.6 million people a month
and costs $1.8 billion a year. Participants are given food vouchers
worth approximately $32 a month, which can be redeemed for specific
foods such as milk, eggs, cereals high in iron, and vitamin-rich
juices.

   The Oregon Court of Appeals on Wednesday
ruled that cowboy boots are dangerous weapons _ at least under some
circumstances.
   The decision upheld the first-degree robbery conviction of Todd
Bell in a case from Multnomah County.
   Bell knocked a woman to the ground and kicked her in the chest
while taking her purse, the court said. He was charged with
first-degree robbery on grounds the cowboy boots he wore were
dangerous weapons.
   ``Clearly, cowboy boots with pointed toes and three-inch heels
are capable of causing injuries that bare feet or, say, tennis
shoes are not,'' the appeals court said.
   And the court said the circumstances of an object's use, rather
than its design, make it a dangerous weapon.
   ``Although cowboy boots are not dangerous weapons per se,
defendant converted them into dangerous weapons ... when he used
them to kick a resisting robbery victim in the upper body while she
was lying on the ground,'' the court said.

<HEAD>Sweden to Prosecute Suspect in Palme Murder Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors said Wednesday they have
assembled enough evidence to try a suspect arrested in December in
the fatal shooting of Prime Minister Olof Palme in 1986.
   Discarding the conspiracy theories police pursued for years, the
prosecutors will press charges against Christer Pettersson.
   Pettersson, 42, has a previous manslaughter conviction, a long
record of petty crime, a history of mental disturbance and of drug
and alcohol abuse. He has denied he shot Palme.
   Assistant state prosecutor Axel Morath said he expected to file
charges within a month. He did not say exactly what the charge
would be.
   ``The evidence against the suspect has been strengthened during
the time he has been detained,'' Morath said. ``The evidence is
judged to be so strong that the prosecutors have decided charges
should be filed and the case should be tested in court.''
   Under Swedish jurisprudence, prosecutors should be virtually
certain of a conviction before trying a case.
   Palme was shot Feb. 28, 1986, while walking home from a movie
with his wife. He was a controversial figure at home and abroad, a
committed socialist and a champion of Third World liberation
movements.
   The killing stunned Sweden, where no political leader had been
slain for 200 years.
   Morath said he would ask the Stockholm district court to order
Pettersson's detention for another 14 days to complete the
investigation and then will turn the file over to the defense to
prepare its case.
   It was not clear when the trial would begin.
   Investigators reportedly believe Pettersson acted alone, but
they have not disclosed any motive.
   Authorities found no murder weapon, but Morath said the case
strengthened after several accounts from witnesses of the slaying.
   ``As far as we can tell, he (Pettersson) has no alibi,'' Morath
said.
   Pettersson had been questioned within weeks of the shooting but
was investigated again after police received a tip that he had lied
about his whereabouts on the night of the shooting.
   Pettersson's arrest on Dec. 14 came as a surprise after a
three-year manhunt that focused on theories of international
conspiracies.
   Pettersson was most recently arrested in August and fined by a
court for assault and the theft of $7 in beef. He was convicted of
1970 of stabbing a stranger after a street brawl just a few yards
from where Palme was shot 16 years later. He was released from
detention after seven months under psychiatric care.
   The strain of failure in solving the murder exposed Swedish
authorities to brutal criticism from the public and parliament.
   Justice Minister Anna Greta-Leijon was forced to resign in June
after disclosures that she supported a private probe of the killing.
   The secret investigation came to light when the group, led by
book publisher Ebbe Carlsson, tried to smuggle illegal wiretapping
equipment across the border.

   The extension is approved for a taxpayer who files a Form 4868
by the midnight April 17 deadline for filing tax returns. Because
of the Patriots Day holiday, the deadline is April 18 for residents
of New England and most areas of New York, who file returns to
Andover, Mass.
   However, getting an additional four months' time to file a
return does not delay the time for payment of taxes owed. Form 4868
must be accompanied by a check for taxes due; an underpayment will
lead to an interest charge and perhaps a penalty.
   There was a time when taxpayers could get an automatic two-month
extension of filing time simply by arranging to be out of the
United States or Puerto Rico on deadline day. Widespread abuse led
the IRS to end that provision.
   Now, the two-month delay is available only for taxpayers who
live and have their business location outside the United States or
Puerto Rico, and for military personnel outside those areas.
   The IRS said 58.1 million returns had been received through
March 31, compared with 58 million at the same time a year ago. The
IRS has processed almost 48.1 million, or 2.2 percent more than the
47 million during the period last year.
   Refunds totaling $30.5 billion have been certified for 37.3
million returns, up from the $29.8 billion and 36.2 million last
year. The average refund this year is $819, down from $825 a year
ago.
   About 109 million returns are expected to be filed this year.

<HEAD>White House Lauds Polish Accord; Raps Gorbachev</HEAD>

   The White House today hailed the accord
reached between the communist government of Poland and the
Solidarity movement, calling it ``a great day for the Polish people
and for freedom.''
   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told a news briefing that
President Bush, who visited Poland in September 1987 as vice
president, was ``very pleased by the accords that have started
Poland on this new path toward reconcilation.''
   Fitzwater said that Americans several years ago ``lit candles''
in hopes that ``darkness and oppression'' in the Warsaw Pact nation
would someday be lifted.
   ``This is a great day for the Polish people and for freedom,''
the spokesman said. ``The discussions have been long and arduous.
We welcome the round table accords and see them as a historic step
... which will take Poland far from totalitarianism.''
   Fitzwater said the Bush administration was following
developments in Poland closely, in consultation with U.S. allies
and with members of Congress.
   Fitzwater also said the United States was disappointed that
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev did not go further in a
speech he gave to the Cuban National Assembly Tuesday, in which the
Kremlin leader spoke out against the export of revolution.
   ``We listened carefully to what President Gorbachev had to
say,'' the spokesman said. ``While his words about not exporting
revolution are welcome, they are not matched by deeds which would
give his words credence.''
   ``Today we call on the Soviets to call off their
half-billion-dollar aid to Nicaragua,'' Fitzwater said.
   Responding to longstanding U.S. concerns about Moscow's
intentions in Latin America, Gorbachev said the Kremlin would
refrain from putting military bases or nuclear weapons in the
region.
   With President Fidel Castro sitting nearby, the Soviet leader
said Moscow supports the creation of a ``zone of peace'' in Latin
America and an end to all outside military aid to the region.
   Fitzwater said the U.S. bipartisan plan for humanitarian aid to
the Nicaraguan Contras ``has the support of the Central American
democracies. It is time for the Soviet Union to support us in this
plan.''
   He said the Soviets ``should demonstrate through their behavior
that they are adhering to this principle, and they should pressure
their client states and the revolutionary groups they support to do
the same.''
   ``We trust that the Soviets will follow these words with
concrete action,'' the press secretary said. But he also said that
Gorbachev ``could have proposed a cutoff of military supplies to
all irregular forces in the region. This would have suggested a new
thinking in Central America.''

<TEXT>
   Chinese troops turned out in force at Beijing's
central square on Wednesday and Chinese sources said one man was
taken away as he tried to commemorate the anniversary of an
important demonstration.
   About 250 students at China's foremost university, meanwhile,
defied a school prohibition and met to discuss political change.
   Chinese sources said hundreds of Chinese soldiers filled
Tiananmen Square early Wednesday morning to prevent against any
demonstrations to commemorate the April 5, 1976 protest that
signaled the end of the Cultural Revolution.
   Soldiers from the People's Liberation Army sealed off about
three-fourths of the huge square, including the Monument to
Revolutionary Martyrs and the mausoleum of Mao Tse-tung.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said troops
detained the man when he tried to enter the sealed-off area to
commemorate the 1976 demonstration, held just after the death of
Premier Zhou Enlai.
   Thousands of people took part in the demonstration, which marked
the end of the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution. The protest,
crushed by police, became a rallying cry for political activists.
   One source said the man was detained because he was handing out
pamphlets critical of the current regime. Another said he was
detained because he tried to walk in the restricted area.
   At Beijing University, about 250 students gathered to defy what
they said was a school prohibition on political meetings.
   Students said that in recent weeks, university and city
government authorities have been stopping the meetings of the
``Democracy Salon,'' a student group organized to discuss current
social issues.
   On Wednesday, Li Shuxian, wife of China's most famous dissident,
Fang Lizhi, addressed the students and urged them to pursue
democratic change.
   Student activists also called on classmates to convince the
school to allow the ``Democratic Salon'' to continue. The reaction,
although supportive, was tame.
   Some students said they were afraid they would be denied access
to good jobs if they supported the movement. Others said they
thought calls for freedom of speech and association were hopeless
in China.
   ``I feel a kind of formless pressure on me that keeps me from
speaking out,'' said one bespectacled student in a worn Mao suit.
``We all do. Many of us don't know what to do. We want to speak out
but we are afraid of all the people here listening.''
   Students said the crowd contained many plainclothes police.
Throughout the meeting, men hovered around taking photographs.
   The open-air meeting began near a statue of Miguel Cervantes,
author of ``Don Quixote.'' As the crowd swelled to about 250, it
moved to pavilion a few yards away.
   The meeting came two days after a wall-poster appeared at
Beijing University urging the university to stop interfering in the
salon. The poster, signed by more than 60 students, said democratic
change in China ``is not simply a matter of saying a few empty
words.''
   A school official said the university permitted students to take
part in activities ``as long as they were healthy and good for the
students.'' But school spokesman Yan Huajiang said if the
university believed the activities were ``unhealthy,'' the school
would stop them.
   History major Wang Dan, an author of the poster, said the
purpose of the group was to ``enliven thought.''
   The most recent interference occurred March 29 when city
officials stopped a professor from another school from addressing
the salon, he said.
   Li teaches physics at Beijing University. In 1987, she was
elected to the lowest-level People's Congress in the district that
contains the university.
   Fang, her 52-year-old husband, is popular among students and
intellectuals because of his view that China's efforts to develop
its economy won't succeed unless it becomes more democratic.
   An increasing number of Chinese intellectuals have been calling
for political change. Since January, intellectuals have written
four open letters calling for the release of political prisoners
and democratic change.
   But government officials have ruled out an amnesty and
softpedaled any talk of democratic change. China also maintains it
has no political prisoners.

   The publisher of TV Guide, Valerie B. Salembier,
has been named president of the New York Post, Post owner Peter S.
Kalikow said Wednesday.
   Peter Price quit as publisher to become a partner in an
international television and radio company, Kalikow said Monday.
Kalikow, who bought the money-losing paper a year ago from Rupert
Murdoch, noted that during Price's tenure the paper added a Sunday
edition.
   Ms. Salembier, a former senior vice president of advertising at
USA Today, will assume Price's responsibilities, said Emory
Edwards, a spokesman for the Post. She will supervise business,
advertising and circulation.
   Ms. Salembier takes over Kalikow's former title of president,
while Kalikow assumes the title of publisher and retains his
position as chairman of the board, Edwards said.
   Ms. Salembier, 43, became publisher of TV Guide in October when
the magazine was acquired by the News Corporation of America.
   ``I am thrilled with the opportunity to go back into the daily
newspaper business,'' Ms. Salembier said in a statement. ``The
potential for growth at the Post is terrific, and it's the perfect
vehicle for a great many new advertisers.''

   The State Department on Wednesday praised
Vietnam's announcement that it would pull out of Cambodia by Sept.
30, saying such a step would restore peace there.
   ``Although we have not yet seen complete details of the
Vietnamese statement, we do believe that if the withdrawal is
carried out, it would be a positive development,'' said Richard
Boucher, a department spokesman.
   ``The United States has long called for an expeditious
withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops as a key component of the
Cambodian settlement,'' he said.
   ``Clearly, a total and verifiable withdrawal of Vietnamese
troops from Cambodia would contribute to the process of returning
peace and stability to that war-torn nation,'' he said.
   Vietnam previously had said it would withdraw its troops,
estimated at 70,000, by 1990 and would be out by September only if
a political settlement has been reached.
   Wednesday's announcement gave no indication that any conditions
were attached to the September pullout.

   Rising prices are forcing young couples to
delay one part of the American dream _ owning their own home _ even
as the number of available houses is growing more than twice as
fast as the population, the Census Bureau said Wednesday.
   Over the decade that began in 1975, median prices for a first
home rose 125 percent, from $27,100 to $61,000 in 1985, while the
average income of married couples renting their home, and aged 25
to 29, rose only 80 percent, from $12,300 to $22,200, the bureau
reported.
   The result, Census housing analyst F. John Devaney said, is that
couples who used to move from renting to owning in their 20s are
now largely delaying the transition into their 30s or later because
they can no longer qualify for mortgages on the homes they want.
   In 1975 three-fourths of married couples aged 25 to 35 qualified
for an 80 percent mortgage, a figure that fell to less than half by
1985, the study found.
   Over the same period, the nation's housing stock grew by 26
percent, while the U.S. population rose by just 11 percent, the
Census Bureau reported in its new analysis, ``Housing in America,
1985-86.''
   Helping absorb the growing number of available homes are the
trend toward second-home ownership and a shrinkage in average
household size, from 2.94 in 1975 to 2.69 a decade later.
   Divorce and separation, up sharply in recent years, have turned
one household into two, Devaney observed. ``One in 10 homeowner
units is a woman living alone,'' he said.
   In addition, many elderly widows continue to maintain their
homes at the same time increasing numbers of young people are
postponing marriage.
   The Census Bureau report was released just a day after the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board reported that conventional mortgage
interest rates rose in March to their highest level since just
before the 1987 stock market crash.
   The board said the national average for conventional,
single-family loans jumped to 11.36 percent in early March, up from
11.11 percent in early February.
   While renters are facing steeper obstacles to owning their first
home, the report said that people who already own a house are more
able to buy a second home.
   The bureau reported that ``vacant'' housing rose from 2.5
million units in 1940 to 11.5 million in 1985 _ meaning the United
States has more unused housing than the entire housing stock of
Canada.
   But that category includes some 5.4 million homes that are
seasonal or recreational residences, the report said.
   ``This is an indication of general economic wellbeing, and we
support a tremendous amount of this housing. It is a big change in
recent years, especially looking back to the 1950s,'' Devaney
observed.
   While the report did not include figures for seasonal and
recreational housing in earlier years, the 5.4 million seasonal and
recreational homes counted among the vacant in 1985 is
significantly higher than the total of 3.2 million vacant houses in
1950.
   Other findings from the new analysis:
   _The median monthly housing costs for all Americans averaged
$355 in 1985, compared to $311 for blacks and $357 for Hispanics.
   _The proportions of income spent for housing were 28 percent for
renters, 21 percent for owners of mortgaged homes and 13 percent
for folks with homes that were not mortgaged.
   _The average size of new homes built in 1986 was 1,825 square
feet, up 300 square feet from 20 years earlier.
   _The median age of housing in 1985 was 23 years.

   Things are back on an even tenor at the
University of the Arts now that students have been assured their
productions won't be canceled so Luciano Pavarotti can use their
stage.
   About 200 students chanted and danced for five hours outside the
university's administration building Tuesday after learning that
their Schubert Theater stage had been handed over to Pavarotti and
the Opera Company of Philadelphia.
   A cracked ceiling beam at the 132-year-old Academy of Music had
forced the opera to look for a new home for its April 9 and 13
productions of Verdi's ``Luisa Miller.''
   Under a settlement negotiated by university President Peter
Sohmssen, two displaced student productions will be rescheduled.
   ``He said in an ideal world, the students should have been
consulted, but this happened over the weekend, and he had to move
quickly,'' said university spokesman Kirby Smith.

   Democratic National Chairman Ronald Brown, Roman
Catholic Archbishop Eugene A. Marino and Morris Dees, co-founder of
the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., have been
honored by a civil rights group.
   The Southern Christian Leadership Conference marked the
anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination by honoring
the three at its 10th annual ``Drum Major for Justice'' award
dinner Tuesday night.
   The awards are named after a phrase in a 1968 King speech in
which he said he wanted to be remembered as a ``drum major for
justice.'' King was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., on April 4,
1968.
   Brown was recognized for his efforts to bring blacks and
Hispanics into the Democratic Party and for lobbying for civil
rights. Marino, of Atlanta, is the first black Roman Catholic
archbishop in the United States. Dees has argued more than 50
federal civil rights cases, one of which resulted in a $7 million
verdict against the Klan.
   California Assemblywoman Maxine Waters also received an award
for efforts to divest state pension funds from businesses involved
with South Africa.

   ``They pulled over one car and signaled the Range Rover

   ``The car driver was questioned for several minutes and then the
officers passed to the vehicle behind. It was at that point they

   An off-duty paramedic who noticed a
bloodied woman in the seat of a car that sped past him rescued her
and helped capture her abductor, police said.
   ``I made direct eye contact with her and she mouthed `Help
me,''' Robert Hodorowicz said Tuesday. ``There was blood
everywhere. I knew she was in great danger.''
   Hodorowicz, 25, heard the car honking behind him as he sat in
his truck at a stop light on Saturday. He was shocked as the car
passed by to see a woman covered in blood kicking and screaming,
and set off in pursuit, he said.
   Jeffrey Harvey, 32, was charged with aggravated kidnapping,
armed robbery and aggravated battery. He was being held in lieu of
$350,000 bond.
   Ann Mate, 45, was released from a hospital Monday after
receiving 100 stitches to sew up gashes on her head. A hospital
spokeswoman said Mate also had numerous bruises on her head, arms,
legs and back.
   She was abducted as she was getting into her car in a shopping
center parking lot, said William Kujawa, deputy police chief in
Burbank, a southern suburb of Chicago. The assailant beat her with
a blackjack as he drove off in the hijacked vehicle, Kujawa said.
   Hodorowicz followed Mate's car for about a mile, at times
reaching speeds of 70 mph, until it smashed into a bridge on
Chicago's South Side and bounced into two other vehicles.
   Hodorowicz screamed at two men standing nearby to ``get that
guy,'' he said. Others at the scene held Harvey until police
arrived, while Hodorowicz bandaged Mate's wounds and reassured her.
   Harvey was released in February from the Joliet Correctional
Center, where he served four years on a drug charge, Kujawa said.
He earlier spent 10 years in a Tennessee prison for robbery.
   Kujawa credited Hodorowicz and other bystanders with saving the
victim's life.
   ``In my experience as a police officer, it's very difficult to
get citizens involved,'' he said. ``And they did it on their own.
All the credit goes to them.''

   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
presented today to Secretary of State James A. Baker III ``some
ways to solve'' problems in the Middle East and Baker said he was
encouraged.
   Although details were not immediately disclosed, Shamir had said
last week in Israel he would propose that Palestinian Arabs hold
elections to choose leaders for negotiations over the West Bank and
Gaza.
   ``I feel we have started a very serious discussion,'' Shamir
said after the two-hour meeting at the State Department.
   Baker called it ``a very productive, useful, friendly
discussion.'' He said Shamir had made some suggestions that `'were
very encouraging.''
   On his arrival, Shamir pledged to work with the United States in
a search for new peace openings. ``We are among friends,'' he said.
   In an arrival statement, Shamir said he hoped his visit would
open ``vistas'' to peace while he works with U.S. officials ``in
mutual understanding and respect.''
   His aim in the election proposal is to find leaders other than
from the Palestine Liberation Organization to negotiate some form
of self-rule for the 1.7 million Arabs in the territories.
   The 73-year-old prime minister steadfastly refuses to negotiate
with the Palestine Liberation Organization, and told a conference
of Jewish-American organization leaders that sitting with the PLO
``will bring disaster.''
   While Shamir has withheld many of the details until he sees
Secretary of State James A. Baker III today and President Bush on
Thursday, he apparently intends to hold the elections only after
the 15{-month uprising subsides.
   The Bush administration is seeking a more immediate change in
the situation. And yet, a U.S. official, briefing reporters Tuesday
at the White House on the visit, said, ``We want to listen to what
Prime Minister Shamir has to say how the peace process can be moved
forward, but I don't want to prejudge what, in fact, he is going to
tell the president.''
   Shamir follows close on the heels of Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, who said toward the end of his Washington visit on Tuesday
that he saw no way to stop the violence in the territories lost by
the Arabs in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The uprising has cost the lives of 418 Palestinian Arabs and 18
Israelis.
   ``If anybody could stop it, we would be very pleased,'' Mubarak
said. ``But how?''
   The Egyptian leader made no public demands on the United States
or Israel. He said he was simply ``trying to find out what's the
best way to achieve peace'' through negotiations.
   Mubarak, who has insisted that Israel deal with the PLO,
withheld judgment on Shamir's proposal. He said the criterion
should be whether an election would help advance the peace process.
   The Egyptian leader was warmly received by the Bush
administration. Bush took him to Baltimore on Monday to see the
Orioles and the Boston Red Sox play in the opening game of the
American League season.
   Shamir will be entertained with a series of luncheons and
dinners, but there was no event scheduled to match the friendly
spectacle of Mubarak and Bush sitting side-by-side at the ball game.
   The U.S. official who gave the briefing Tuesday praised Israel
as a staunch U.S. ally. But he also said there would be ``candid
give-and-take'' with Shamir, which is a diplomatic way of
suggesting disagreement.
   The U.S. official, who insisted on anonymity, called the
situation on the West Bank untenable but declined to say whether
the Bush administration held the PLO accountable.
   ``I am not going to get into the causes of the intifada and who
is in control,'' he said, using the Arabic word for the uprising.
   The Palestinian insurgency, which Shamir and other Israeli
officials say was inspired and is maintained by the PLO, began in
December 1987 and has had the effect of enhancing U.S. interest in
the situation on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Mubarak, in response to a question, told reporters: ``Neither
you nor anybody else would be able to stop the intifada. ... Let us
be realistic and practical. We all hope that we could reach peace
and avoid losing lives and spending money for killing and
bloodshed.''
   In a statement timed to Shamir's visit, 200 American Jews
challenged the prime minister and urged him to open negotiations
with the PLO.
   ``Many American Jews, loyal supporters of Israel, do not support
the suppression of the Palestinian people and the continued
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza,'' the statement said. ``You
do not have a blank check from American Jewry to continue these
policies.''
   The statement was released in Oakland, Calif., by Tikkun, a
bimonthly magazine that concentrates on political and cultural
issues of special interest to American Jews. The signers included
the comedian and writer Woody Allen, novelist Philip Roth,
playwright Arthur Miller and civil rights lawyer Joseph Rauh.
   ``Begin negotiations with the PLO,'' the statement said. ``Not
only has the U.S. begun to talk with them but recent polls indicate
that 58 percent of American Jews would support direct negotiations
with PLO leaders. If you are serious about seeking peace, you must
be prepared to talk directly with your enemies, and you cannot
expect to pick their representatives for them.''

<HEAD>Lenin's Body in No Danger of Withering Away</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 65 years of lying in state, the body of
Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin is in no immediate danger of
rotting away, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported
Wednesday.
   ``The preservation of Lenin's body is guaranteed for an extended
period of time,'' said Sergei S. Debov, head of the laboratory
overseeing the body.
   The body lies beneath glass in a special marble-and-granite
mausoleum on Red Square. Five days a week, visitors are hustled
past the body in a dimly lighted room where no photographs are
allowed.
   There has long been speculation that the technology did not
exist when Lenin died in 1924 to preserve him, and that the body is
a wax dummy.
   In the Pravda interview, Debov confirmed that at first, Soviet
scientists did not think they could preserve the body of the
revered leader.
   More than two months after Lenin died and had been temporarily
embalmed, a team of scientists descended into the then-wooden
mausoleum to figure out how to answer mass demand for long-term
preservation, Debov said.
   They considered a refrigeration system, but decided on
``anatomical-biochemical methods'' instead, Pravda said, without
elaboration.
   However, Debov did say the fight against decomposition was so
intense at first that scientists had to work around the clock ``in
a struggle to preserve literally every square millimeter of skin
against putrefaction.''
   The preservation process was further complicated when its head,
Boris Zbarsky, was arrested during Josef Stalin's repressions in
1952, Debov said. He was released after Stalin died the next year.
   The preservation process requires ``daily vigilant observation''
and is examined by a government commission every four or five
years, Debov said. The commission's report last year noted the body
was in good condition, he said, but ``nothing on our planet is
eternal.''
   Lenin's wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, was against having Lenin
embalmed, but she was overruled by the Communist Party leadership.

   A century-old clock in this
quintessential New England town has pitted old-timers fond of its
hourly chiming against a pair of newcomers who say the clamor is
taking a toll on their sleep.
   The couple sued to silence the town clock at night, and that is
the talk of the Main Street barbershop, just a stone's throw from
the First Congregational Church steeple that holds the clock, said
barber Giles Desmond.
   ``Any time anything happens that might undermine the town's
history, people get very _ how shall I say? _ hostile,'' said
Selectman George G. Zgrodnik Jr. ``What do you think people in
England would do if they turned off Big Ben?''
   This confrontation of yuppies vs. Yankees has caused the
greatest bustle in the pretty little town since an old school was
demolished a decade ago to make way for a modern one, said Zgrodnik.
   Feelings run deep in this 319-year-old farming community, where
settlers once battled Indians and asparagus has overtaken tobacco
as the chief cash crop. Zgrodnik said some of the 3,200 townspeople
still aren't talking to the official they suspect of arranging the
schoolhouse demolition.
   Richard and Pamela Carnall moved into this community of strong
traditions in August and unsuspectingly bought a 19th-century house
50 yards from the 1870 white clapboard church.
   The town clock was broken and silent until after they moved in.
   Mrs. Carnall said they endured the chimes when they first
resumed because they assumed the bell was tolling only for holidays.
   When the chiming continued, the couple offered to install a
timer to shut the bell off at night. Selectmen declined the offer,
saying the timer could jam the works of the delicate clock.
   The Carnalls say in their lawsuit that the bell has turned them
into crabby insomniacs, making them ``irritable, frustrated, angry,
humorless and combative.'' They claim it booms into their bedroom
at 75 decibels, louder than a vacuum cleaner.
   ``I told my husband when it started, `This is not normal, this
ringing around the clock,''' Mrs. Carnall, 29, a marketing
consultant, said Wednesday.
   She and her 34-year-old husband, a cable TV salesman, grew up in
nearby towns and were drawn to Hatfield for its traditional values
but were driven to sue out of desperation, she said.
   ``We just lost sleep night after night. We had no choice,'' she
said.
   She said she has received support from some townspeople,
including one particularly sympathetic note. ``It really meant a
lot, coming from an air traffic controller,'' she said.
   On the other side of the issue, a petition in Desmond's
Barbershop says the bell has ``been signaling farmers, children and
other residents of the hours longer than anyone remembers.''
   At least 200 signatures were gathered in the day before a March
24 hearing on a preliminary injunction that would have shut off the
bell at night until a trial could be held. A judge denied the
injunction, saying the Carnalls hadn't proved irreparable harm.
   Neighbors tell the Carnalls they will eventually get used to the
bell, as other families have in the 60 years since the house was
moved to the spot from a quarter-mile down the street.
   Other townsfolk say the selectmen have their backs up about the
recent influx of newcomers like the Carnalls and overreacted to the
request to quiet the bell at night.
   ``I'm surprised at the intensity of feeling a few people have
for that bell at one, two, three o'clock in the morning,'' said the
Carnalls' attorney, W. Michael Ryan, who also lives in town. ``The
general population of Hatfield thinks this is comical.''

   King Hussein on Wednesday inaugurated the
Martyr King Abdullah Mosque, the kingdom's largest Islamic
religious structure.
   ``What a happy day and what a glorious event for me to have the
honor to inaugurate one of God's houses just before the emergence
of the holy month of Ramadan,'' Hussein told a crowd of Moslem
worshipers.
   The $12 million mosque is named after the monarch's grandfather,
Jordan's first king.
   Hussein's Hashemite family is descended from Islam's Prophet
Mohammed. King Abdullah, who ruled Jordan from its creation in 1921
until his assassination in Jerusalem in 1950.
   The royal court chief, Field Marshal Zeid Bin Shaker, Prime
Minister Zaid Rifai and other senior aides and religious figures
joined the monarch at the ceremony, which included readings and
teachings of the Koran, the Islamic holy book.
   The blue Ottoman-style mosque can hold 3,500 worshipers in its
20,000 square yards of floor space.
   The building also holds a Koranic teaching school, conference
rooms, a library and housing for religious figures.

<HEAD>Administration Expands Ban on Importation of Semiautomatic Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said today it was
expanding a recently imposed ban on the importation of
semiautomatic assault weapons.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that President
Bush accepted a Treasury Department recommendation that the ban be
widened, effective immediately.
   The action expands the ban to cover all imports of the
high-powered, rapid-fire weapons, Fitzwater said.
   The previous ban, announced in early March, only covered about
80 percent of imports, he said.
   Fitzwater said the initial ban on such weapons, including the
AK-47 assault rifle, was aimed at fostering ``a climate in which
reasonable and well-intended people ... could work out a thoughtful
solution'' to the proliferation of such weapons.
   He said the department was imposing a ban on an additional 24
types of guns ``to review their suitability for sporting purposes.''
   Among other things, he said, the administration wants to make
sure that no foreign manufacturer suffered a needless weakening of
its competitive position in the export market, and so therefore the
ban was expanded.
   ``The president believes that, by working closely with law
enforcement groups, sportsmen, concerned citizen groups and
Congress, we can resolve these problems,'' Fitzwater said.
   Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms announced the
initial ban on March 14 on the import of the AK-47s and certain
similar weapons, but said the action could be ``reversible.''
   It said the move was necessary to head off an imminent flood of
the assault weapons into the United States.
   Bush earlier had asked federal drug coordinator William Bennett
to recommend what should be done about the increasing flow of the
weapons. Calls for such a ban had been prompted by scores of
drug-related shootings and the recent slaying of five California
schoolchildren.
   Fitzwater said the new action was not guided so much by growing
public opinion against such weapons as by a desire to make sure
that one company did not gain a competitive advantage over another
through the import ban.
   ``This is an effort to equalize that matter,'' he said.
   The spokesman conceded that today's action still would not
affect the production and distribution of domestically made assault
rifles.
   ``There is some unfairness in that those weapons are still being
produced. Unfortunately, it is not something we can do anything
about,'' he said.
   ``To do anything about domestically manufactured weapons would
require a change in the law,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said that the 90-day review of the entire subject ordered by
Bush on March 15 is progressing.

   The fired captain of the oil tanker Exxon
Valdez surrendered this morning to face charges of being drunk when
his vessel ran aground, and a judge set his bail 20 times higher
than prosecutors had sought.
   ``These misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been
equaled, at least in this country,'' Judge Kenneth Rohl said as
Joseph Hazelwood was arraigned as a fugitive.
   ``He's got to think about that. We have a manmade destruction
that has not been equaled, probably, since Hiroshima.''
   Rohl set the bail at $500,000 cash. District Attorney Patrick
Henry had said he would recommend bail of $25,000.
   ``We are treating this case like any other fugitive warrant
case,'' he said.
   Hazelwood, who had been sought since Sunday on a fugitive
warrant, turned himself in about 8:45 a.m.
   Hazelwood, who wore a tie and had shaven off his thick beard,
was accompanied by three attorneys, who had been negotiating with
authorities for two days to arrange the surrender.
   Hazelwood faces three misdemeanor charges in Alaska stemming
from the March 24 grounding of the Exxon Valdez, which spilled more
than 10.1 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound.
   Hazelwood, 42, a resident of the Long Island community of
Huntington, apparently flew to New York from Anchorage, Alaska,
last week.
   Prosecutors said Hazelwood would be asked if he wants to waive
extradition proceedings. If he agreed and bail was set, he would be
sent back to Alaska to face the charges there.
   Hazelwood is charged with operating a ship while under the
influence of alcohol, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge
of oil. The charges carry combined maximum penalties of 2\ years in
prison and a $10,000 fine.
   FBI officials in Washington say they also are investigating
whether Hazelwood could be charged with felony violations of the
Clean Water Act, which prohibits negligent discharge of pollutants
into navigable waters.
   Hazelwood was fired by Exxon last Thursday after the National
Transportation Safety Board said tests taken about nine hours after
the disaster showed he was under the influence of alcohol.
   Hazelwood had been arrested twice for drunken driving and had
his license suspended three times. His mother told The Associated
Press that her son had undergone rehabilitation and that Exxon was
aware of his drinking problem.
   Hazelwood was not on the bridge when the tanker ran aground. A
third mate who was not certified to pilot the vessel was in command.
   Exxon said it has changed its policy because of the spill and
now requires crews to be aboard ship, where drinking is prohibited,
four hours before sailing.

<TEXT>
   At least 14 lawsuits have been filed in
connection with the Alaskan oil spill, including a
multimillion-dollar one claiming the spill led to higher gas prices
for California drivers.
   The plaintiffs who have sued in federal and state courts are for
the most part area fishermen, fish processors and businessmen such
as tour boat operators seeking unspecified damages and
environmental restoration from Exxon USA and other defendants.
   A lawsuit filed by attorney Melvin Belli, however, goes beyond
actual damages and asks the court to assess at least $1 billion to
punish or make an example of the defendants. The San Francisco
attorney said he also has turned to the courts to tap a $100
million cleanup fund established as part of the federal
authorization for the trans-Alaska oil pipeline.
   Belli, known for his litigation of disasters, said Tuesday about
100 plaintiffs had joined in a class-action lawsuit and he expected
many more. ``We've been deluged,'' he said.
   Other lawsuits include a class-action complaint filed in federal
court in California, charging that the spill led to higher prices
at the gas pump for drivers in that state.
   Exxon Corp. has promised to accept liability for the disaster
and pay for the cleanup, lost income and all valid claims.
   The oil that spilled into Prince William Sound from the Exxon
Valdez on March 24 had flowed through the 800-mile pipeline from
Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. About 240,000 barrels of crude oil spilled
into the resource-rich sound, killing wildlife and bringing the
cancellation of at least three fish harvests.
   Claims in the lawsuits include negligence, stemming partly from
Capt. Joseph Hazelwood's absence from the vessel's bridge at the
time of the crash. Tests conducted about nine hours after the
accident showed Hazelwood was intoxicated.
   Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.'s response immediately after the
spill also is presented as a basis for damages. The company is a
consortium of oil companies.
   ``It's going to be fairly complex litigation,'' said John
McCarron, an Anchorage lawyer whose office has filed four lawsuits,
including one on behalf of Cordova District Fishermen United and
Prince William Sound Aquaculture Corp.
   ``It could last for quite awhile.''
   Exxon officials have said they do not know how many lawsuits
have been filed around the country, and they will not comment on
litigation.

<HEAD>Judge Denies North Bid to Use Poindexter's Congressional Testimony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in Oliver North's trial on Wednesday
blocked the former White House aide from using videotaped
congressional testimony from John Poindexter which North says would
show his boss authorized his actions.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said the three-hour
selection of tape North' lawyers want to show at his trial
``distorts the record'' of the 30 hours of testimony Poindexter
gave Congress in 1987.
   ``The case is winding down now and the motion just filed comes
too late,'' Gesell stated in a four-page order.
   The prosecution would have to examine all of Poindexter's
testimony in preparing a rebuttal, and Gesell said, ``The editing
of 30 hours of testimony cannot be evaluated in the short time
given to the independent counsel.''
   North's lawyers had argued that excluding the videotape would be
unconstitutional, but Gesell said, ``The constitutional claim is
misplaced.'' The judge said North seeks no material that ``if
excluded, would arguably deprive him of his due process rights.''
   It was the second setback for North in less than a week. Last
Friday, Gesell quashed North's subpoena for former President Reagan
to appear at the trial. The judge ruled the defense had failed to
supply any proof that Reagan had authorized North to engage in
illegal conduct.
   In his testimony to Congress, Poindexter said ``I did not
authorize'' North to make false statements in an August 1986
meeting with the House Intelligence Committee. But Poindexter added:
   ``Don't misunderstand me. I thought that Colonel North would
withhold information. There was no doubt about that in my mind.''
   North is accused of obstructing Congress in connection with the
Aug. 6, 1986, meeting. He is alleged to have said he had only
casual contact with his courier to the Contras, Robert Owen, and
hadn't seen another Contra supporter, Gen. John Singlaub, in 20
months. Owen testified earlier in the trial that he had nearly 100
meetings with North while Singlaub testified he met on several
occasions in 1986 with North.
   Asked during the congressional hearings whether he thought it
was proper for extensive document destruction to have taken place
on Nov. 21, 1986, as the attorney general launched a fact-finding
inquiry on the Iran initiative, Poindexter responded:
   ``I don't have any problem with it. ... These are working
documents in the staff offices.''
   North is accused of obstructing the attorney general's inquiry
by destroying, altering, concealing and smuggling documents out of
the National Security Council offices.
   Poindexter has asserted through his lawyer that if called to
testify, he would invoke his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination and refuse to answer questions.
   Poindexter, a co-defendant in the Iran-Contra affair, is to be
tried separately later this year. He is charged with conspiracy,
theft of government property, obstruction of Congress and making
false statements to a congressional committee.
   North said in a motion last Friday that portions of Poindexter's
prior testimony are ``critical to the defense, particularly on the
issue of official knowledge and authorization of Lt. Col. North's
activities.''
   However, Gesell said there ``can be no dispute that the
videotape is hearsay'' and that it may be admitted as evidence only
under a narrow exception ``given to former testimony.''
   Federal court rules say that the party against whom the
testimony is offered, in this instance the government, must have
had an opportunity to question the testimony.
   Gesell stated that ``the independent counsel is not the
Congress. ... Congressional examination was shaped in part by the
demands of television and electoral politics, rathby the
rules of evidence and the norms of a fair adversary proceeding.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Elliot Gould didn't get ``Fifty,'' so
he's going for $5.8 million.
   Gould on Tuesday filed a breach of contract lawsuit against
Tri-Star Pictures seeking $5.8 million in damages over a featured
role in ``Fifty.''
   The canceled film project was to have been the story of a
divorced sportswriter who tries to change his life when he reaches
the half-century mark.
   The complaint states that Gould had a ``pay or play'' contract
with Tri-Star in 1988, under which he was to get $350,000 for a
featured role in ``Fifty'' and $50,000 of the net profits.
   But two weeks before rehearsals were to begin in December,
Tri-Star abandoned the project, allegedly because actor Richard
Dreyfuss refused to appear in the film, the lawsuit says.
   Dreyfuss earlier denied that he left the film and sued Tri-Star
over the cancellation. The parties reached an out-of-court
settlement.
   Gould's lawsuit was filed in Superior Court by Todd T.
Alberstone. A message left with the lawyer's answering service was
not immediately returned.
   The lawsuit seeks $350,000 in wages, $500,000 in consequential
damages and $5 million in punitive damages.

<HEAD>Caribou Trucked to Wilderness To Recreate Maine Herd</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILLINOCKET, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Biologists trucked 13 caribou into the
wilderness to regenerate the native herd of the reindeer-like
animals that vanished from the woods of northern Maine 80 years ago.
   Five animals, doped up on tranquilizers, were driven in trucks
100 miles north of here Wednesday to a three-acre enclosure in a
state park where they will be kept several weeks before their final
release.
   Eight other caribou were taken to the park earlier in the week.
   The beasts were to have been accompanied by a 2-year-old stag
named E.U. Truckmore, whom scientists expect to become a dominant
male in the herd.
   But the tranquilizer did not have an effect on the big stag and
he was left behind out of concern he would disturb the other
caribou during the ride, said Margaret Nagle, a spokeswoman for the
University of Maine in Orono.
   She said biologists will decide later this week whether to
transfer the stag to Baxter State Park with the other caribou.
   Maine's native caribou herd disappeared by 1908. Officials tried
in 1963 to reintroduce a herd, but the venture was considered a
failure because the animals disappeared.
   The caribou being released in the latest attempt, which were
born to a herd rounded up in Newfoundland in 1986, are
non-migratory.

   The five astronauts who will fly the

days of training, including a practice countdown.
   Commander Dave Walker, pilot Ron Grabe and Norm Thagard flew in
from the Johnson Space Center in Houston, landing in a rainstorm,

to take part in a test that verified electrical and other
connections between the shuttle Atlantis and the Magellan-Venus
spacecraft in its cargo bay.
   NASA lists April 28 as the target for launching Atlantis, but
preparations have been running behind schedule because of minor
technical problems at the launch pad, and officials expect liftoff
will slip as much as four days.
   Shuttle managers are to meet here April 14 to set a launch date.
   Once in Earth orbit, the astronauts will dispatch the $378
million Magellan payload on the start of a 466-day outward journey
to Venus. The craft is to orbit the cloud-shrouded planet and map
its surface with high-resolution radar.
   On Thursday, the astronauts will rehearse launch pad emergency
procedures and on Friday they will board Atlantis for the final two
hours of a countdown rehearsal.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet-Cuban alliance seems reasonably intact
after the visit of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but the two
countries _ so different in so many ways _ still give the
impression of an international odd couple.
   For nations that were barely aware of each other's existence 30
years ago, the Soviet Union and Cuba have come a long way. No
overseas ally of the Soviets has been more durable than Cuba.
   They are improbable partners _ temperamentally and
geographically distant, sometimes seemingly from different planets
_ but a common ideology and shared hostility for the United States
cemented the relationship in ways few would have thought possible.
   To this day, Cuba soaks up more than half the Soviet foreign aid
program while lending itself to Soviet strategic purposes. As an
example, Cuba has routinely dispatched soldiers to bolster remote
but ideologically congenial regimes troubled by unrest.
   For almost two decades, even the most persistent analysts were
unable to detect more than minor chinks in the Moscow-Havana axis.
   With the ascendancy of Gorbachev, however, sharp differences
began to emerge and it was against this background that his
Ilyushin-62 jetliner touched down here Sunday night.
   In a variety of ways, Castro had indicated deep reservations
about Gorbachev's policies: his accommodating attitude toward the
United States, his less-than-resolute backing for pro-Soviet
regimes in such places as Afghanistan and Cambodia, his willingness
to borrow some capitalistic practices, his eagerness to allow
public debate on key issues.
   Castro made no secret of his disdain for some of those reforms,
but during Gorbachev's visit the Cuban leader sought to be the
perfect host, effusively praising the visitor while dismissing
Western accounts of a rift.
   Soviet-Cuban friendship and cooperation, Castro said in a speech
Tuesday, ``has, does and will exist and and will increase.''
   Gorbachev was less forthcoming on this point but told a news
conference Tuesday there was no truth to Western reports that, he
said, treated the two ``almost as enemies.''
   There was some hint of Gorbachev's widely advertised
dissatisfaction with the way Cuba has used Soviet aid.
   He told the Cuban National Assembly the ``immediate task'' is
``stricter accountability and more discipline'' on joint projects.
   That was an elegant way of saying, ``Look, Fidel, we've poured
hundreds of millions of pesos into extravagant projects begun over
a decade ago and the return on the investment thus far has been
non-existent.''
   Castro is not one to play the role of sycophant, even to a
patron as generous as Gorbachev. In contrast to the measured way
the Kremlin leader discussed Soviet relations with the United
States, Castro made a bitter attack on U.S. policies while
Gorbachev sat impassively nearby.
   In corrosive terms, he criticized U.S. support for
anti-communist insurgencies and the American refusal to give Third
World countries more of a break on their huge foreign debt.
   Polemical diatribes are part of Castro's repertoire, but not
Gorbachev's. While Castro sees himself as the guardian of socialist
purity, Gorbachev has emerged as a no-apologies defender of
pragamtism.
   It appears Castro has decided he can coexist with what Gorbachev
describes as the ``new thinking'' in Moscow, distasteful as the
Cuban may find it.
   He has backed away from criticizing Gorbachev's policies in
recent months, perhaps sensing that what unites the two countries
is far more powerful than what divides them.
   Cuba gets roughly $5 billion in aid from the Soviets annually
and the Kremlin remains Castro's best insurance against a U.S.
attempt to eradicate communism in Cuba. Moscow almost certainly
would extract a heavy price from the United States in such a case.
   Gorbachev benefits from his alliance with Castro, who is, after
all, a hero to the world's dispossessed and has given Moscow
irreplaceable facilities for electronic spy activities against U.S.
military and space installations along the East Coast.
   The two countries may not seem meant for each other, but to
Castro the relationship is more than an ephemeral infatuation.
   ``Our gratitude toward the Soviet leadership, led brilliantly by
comrade Gorbachev, will be eternal,'' he said Tuesday.

<HEAD>Democrats Cheer Win in Alabama, Victory Over Jackson's Candidate
in Chicago</HEAD>

   Democrats were celebrating two more election
victories Wednesday, but some of their heartiest cheers were
prompted by the party's clean triumph in its latest confrontation
with Jesse Jackson.
   Democrat Glen Browder was a landslide winner in the race for an
open House seat in Alabama Tuesday, his triumph coming exactly a
week after Jill Long upset Republican hopes of holding Dan Quayle's
old House seat in Indiana.
   Browder easily beat Republican John Rice who had labeled the
Democrat a liberal, a liar and a wimp. Browder will succeed the
late Democratic Rep. Bill Nichols.
   But the race that held the attention of Democrats was for mayor
of Chicago, where Richard M. Daley scored a solid victory over a
black independent backed by Jackson.
   That was a contest where all the winners and losers weren't on
the ballot.
   A clear winner was Ronald H. Brown, the new national Democratic
Party chairman.
   Also picking up some points for likely use in 1992 was Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee who risked involvement in the snake
pit of Chicago politics by campaigning for Daley.
   Jackson backed independent candidate Timothy Evans and shared
his loss.
   ``People are quick to say Jackson failed here in Chicago,'' the
two-time presidential candidate said. ``But it's not the winning or
losing.''
   But in politics it often is the winning or losing, or at least
how people deal with triumph or defeat.
   Jackson quickly shifted to talk of building bridges. But he left
the burden on Daley.
   For Democrats who've long been irritated by Jackson's free-lance
manner of operating, the Chicago race offered hope that his
influence was diminishing.
   James Ruvolo, Ohio Democratic Party chairman and head of the
Association of Democratic State Chairs, speculated that Jackson
could lose support within the party because of his support of Evans.
   That might prove wishful thinking. But other Democrats also were
assessing the impact of the mayoral race held on Jackson's home
turf.
   ``Jesse's traveling extensively without portfolio politically,''
said one Democrat who insisted on anonymity.
   Yolanda Caraway, who was a top aide to Jackson in his campaign
for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination, said he ``has
heard from quite a few people'' who are urging him to run for mayor
of Washington, D.C., a city troubled by a wave of drug-related
murders.
   ``I'm very much for it,'' said Ms. Caraway.
   The only office Jackson has ever sought is president and some of
his supporters believe he could strengthen his standing by winning
another office.
   Brown clearly gained strength from the Chicago contest and
accomplished it without appearing too eager to provoke a
confrontation with Jackson.
   A black lawyer, Brown was convention manager for Jackson when
the Democrats met last summer in Atlanta. His tie to Jackson was an
argument used against him when he sought the party chairmanship.
   When Daley defeated incumbent Mayor Eugene Sawyer for the
Democratic nomination, Brown quickly endorsed the nominee, a step
that brought an angry outcry from some blacks, including Rep. Gus
Savage who was backing Evans.
   Despite denunciations from Savage, Brown twice appeared in
Chicago to support Daley.
   Jackson made it easier for the chairman by not making an issue
of Brown's support for Daley.
   Both the party chairman and the mayor-elect were quick to issue
unity appeals.
   ``I pledge my help in bringing Democrats together,'' said Brown.
   Daley, whose father was Chicago's mayor for 21 years, succeeds a
black incumbent and he pledged to ``bring top professional people _
black and white and Hispanic and Asian'' into City Hall.
   The victories of Long and Browder in the two House races this
spring puts greater pressure on the Republicans to hold the seat
vacated by Dick Cheney of Wyoming when he became secretary of
defense.
   Cheney won the House seat in 1978 and it was considered solidly
Republican. But the GOP has no assurance of holding it in the
special election scheduled for April 26.
   Democrat John Vinich nearly upset Republican Sen. Malcolm Wallop
last November and is considered far better known than his GOP
opponent Craig Thomas.
   Asked about the Republican prospects in Wyoming, John Buckley,
spokesman for the House GOP campaign committee, said, ``They're
tough, they're tough.''

   At least 21 Cubans who support the reforms of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev have been arrested, a leading
dissident said Wednesday, the day the Soviet leader left Cuba.
   Most of those arrested had planned to take part in a
pro-Gorbachev demonstration at the Soviet Embassy on Tuesday night,
said Elizardo Sanchez, a local human rights activist.
   Government spokesman have confirmed that some arrests were
carried out starting Tuesday morning but have not given precise
figures.
   Among those arrested was Samuel Martinez Lara, leader of the
Pro-Human Rights Party. He was the principal organizer of the
demonstration, which was canceled.
   There was a heavy police presence Tuesday night outside the
embassy, where Gorbachev attended a reception.
   Several people who were monitoring developments in the area were
taken into custody, Sanchez and other witnesses said.
   The demonstration was to have been aimed at seeking Gorbachev's
support for a liberalizing reform program in Cuba similar to the
one Gorbachev has carried out in the Soviet Union.
   Sanchez, who heads the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and
National Reconciliation, said scores of others may also have been
arrested but he could confirm only 21.
   Sanchez, interviewed on ``CBS This Morning,'' said he was
doubtful Gorbachev's reforms had rubbed off on Cuban leader Fidel
Castro.
   ``I did not have a great deal of hope,'' he said. ``We never
expected miracles to result from this visit. We trust more in what
we Cubans can do for ourselves.''

   Patricia M. Kearney, who was a White House
aide in the Reagan administration, has been named by Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter as his chief of staff.
   Kearney, 34, is drawing $68,700 a year at her Agriculture
Department post, but a spokesman said her salary is ``subject to
change'' once all the paperwork is completed on the new appointment.
   As Yeutter's chief of staff, Kearney will oversee day-to-day
operations of the office of the secretary.
   Kearney was transition leader for USDA during the switch to the
Bush administration and was active in the presidential campaign as
deputy director of communications for the 1988 Republican
convention.
   Before that, Kearney was director of communications for private
sector initiatives in the Reagan White House and earlier was a USDA
aide to the assistant secretary for food and consumer services.

   Representatives of four major religions told a
forum on in vitro fertilization Wednesday they opposed test tube
babies when donated sperm or ovum were used, but would accept the
technique under some circumstances.
   Addressing a forum on ethical aspects of the technique, a Roman
Catholic delegate said the Vatican opposed in vitro fertilization.
Jewish, Moslem and Buddhist clerics said the practice could be
sanctioned within defined limits.
   All four religious groups, however, strongly opposed to carrying
out experiments on human embryos as well as using sperm, ovum or
embryos donated by third parties for implantation in infertile
women.
   ``The mere fact that parents and doctors can play around with an
embryo ... is very, very dangerous,'' Sheikh T. Tabari, a Moslem
cleric, told doctors from 42 countries at the conference. ``Why
approach even the boundaries of such dangers?''
   Dr. Joseph Schenker, chief gynecologist at Jerusalem's Hadassah
Hospital, said religious opposition to sperm donation was reflected
in its ban in 20 of the 59 countries practicing in vitro
fertilization.
   He said nations in the Moslem-dominated Arab world and Roman
Catholic-dominated South America were among those banning the
donations.
   Schenker said donation of female ovum was only practiced in 10
countries, among them the United States and Australia.
   Tohru Kotaki, a professor of Buddhism from Japan, said that
while his religion tolerated test tube fertilization, it opposed
sperm, ovum and embryo donation because they could lead to gene
manipulation, paid donorship and prejudice against any offspring
produced.
   ``We human beings don't have the wisdom to avoid these
pitfalls,'' Kotaki said. ``My standpoint is very conservative: stop
the donation of sperm and ovum.''
   Rabbi Shlomo Goren, a former Israeli chief rabbi, said Judaism
opposed sperm donation, but exceptions could be made if the
identity of the donor was made known.
   ``The donor will always remain the father of the child as far as
religious law is concerned,'' Goren said. He said that among the
reasons for Jewish opposition to donorship was that it raised
problems of identity, including the possibility of incest between
people who did not realize they were related.
   Dr. Rudolf Klimek, a Polish gynecologist who represented the
Roman Catholic point of view, stated the Vatican's opposition:
``The Vatican is against in vitro fertilization as a means of
reproduction, but accepts all babies born of the procedure.''
   Klimek said he was working toward a technique for fertilizing
eggs inside a woman's body. ``By taking the procedure from in vitro
to in vivo, we bring back the dignity,'' he said.
   Doctors at the conference called on the clerics to demonstrate
more tolerance toward couples faced with infertility.
   ``People who come to us want a baby. Most of them are very
religious,'' said Dr. Jean Cohen of Paris. ``Why don't you come to
our clinics, look at our research and make an effort to understand
us?''

<HEAD>Spending Expected to Continue Outpacing Revenues</HEAD>

   Overall spending by state governments will
exceed revenues in both fiscal 1989 and 1990 while emergency
reserves will decline next year to their lowest level since the
recession early in the decade, the National Governors' Association
reported Wednesday.
   Officials noted that the shift to deficit spending comes in the
face of a healthy economy and expressed concern that a new
downturn, coupled with recent requirements for more state spending
on health care, education and prisons, would make matters worse.
   For now, the majority of states remain on fair to good financial
footing, with much of the current stress centered in the Northeast
_ despite low unemployment and robust growth in personal income in
that region. Of 10 states forced to trim their original 1989
budgets, half were in the Northeast. New York and Massachusetts
together accounted for $815 million of the $1.15 billion in overall
cuts.
   The governors' association said 24 states are considering tax
increases for 1990, with about half of those looking at boosts in
personal income and business taxes. Increases in cigarette taxes,
ranging from 3.5 cents to 18 cents per pack, have been proposed in
10 states. Eleven governors are seeking to raise fuel taxes. Nine
states are considering alcohol tax increases.
   All states except Vermont are barred by their constitutions or
laws from deficit spending, but many are increasingly dipping into
past surpluses, their so-called ``rainy-day'' accounts, to make up
for revenue shortfalls.
   The governors' semiannual fiscal survey showed that, overall,
the states ended fiscal 1988 with $9.8 billion in reserve, but that
total will drop to $9 billion in 1989 and $8.1 billion in 1990.
More alarming, the amount available for fiscal emergencies will
fall to 3 percent of total budgeted spending next year as
expenditures continue to rise, well below the 5 percent benchmark
eyed required by Wall Street for superior bond ratings.
   The projected 1990 reserve figure would be the lowest since the
1.5 percent logged in the major recession year of 1983, and
compares with 4.2 percent for fiscal 1988 and 3.5 percent for 1989.
   The governors' report, compiled jointly with the National
Association of State Budget Officers, asked, ``If total reserves
decline when the national economy is strong, what will happen with
the national economy weakens?''
   Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the governors'
association, said federal spending constraints, coupled with new
laws requiring greater state spending on catastrophic health care
and nursing homes _ both components of the Medicaid program _ are
at the root of the squeeze. He also cited needs for more state
spending on education, and new corrections costs arising from
longer prison terms and prison overcrowding.
   He said the state governments are clearly ``at risk if there is
an economic slowdown.''
   The report said the states will spend a total of $255.3 billion
against revenues of $253.4 billion in 1989, with projections for
expenditures of $271.5 billion against revenues of $268.2 billion
in 1990. By contrast, the states ended fiscal 1988 with a $6.8
billion surplus.
   State spending increased 7 percent in 1988, went up 8 percent
this year, and will climb at a pace of 6.4 percent next year, the
report said. When measured against inflation, real state spending
increased 2.9 percent in 1988 and again this year, and will go up
at a slower 1.3 percent pace next year.

   Marilyn knew she was different: Most people hold
their noses and roll up their windows when they drive past a dead
skunk in the middle of the road.
   But she's always found something wonderful about that pungent,
musky, unmistakable scent. And now she knows she's not alone.
   Marilyn, who does not want her last name known because some
folks might not understand, turned up scores of people who do
understand with her classified ad in a national newspaper.
   ``If you like the smell, you really like the smell. It isn't
something you can take or leave,'' Marilyn says of the skunk's
scent, a spray designed by nature as the animal's first line of
defense.
   For most of her 50 years, the suburban woman has reveled in the
odor.
   ``Everybody else rolls up their windows,'' says one of her two
daughters. ``She rolls them down.''
   Marilyn began to wonder if there were others who shared her
passion, so she ran this ad in USA Today in January:
   ``Calling All Skunk Lovers.
   ``My family and friends think I am the only person in the world
that likes the skunk scent. I would like to prove them wrong, so if
you or anyone you know likes the scent, please reply.''
   Within five weeks, she got 71 replies.
   ``Sensuous,'' wrote one fellow skunk lover.
   ``Intriguingly delicate,'' wrote another.
   ``Has always reminded me of burnt toast,'' offered a third.
   Some said they had never shared their secret before. Others
wrote of being teased by relatives. A few confessed weaknesses for
other strong scents.
   ``I can think of no combination of things using the five senses
that can rival ... the feel of a warm summer breeze, the taste of a
cool drink, the sights of a beautiful garden, the sound of rushing
water, and the faint smell of skunk,'' said one letter from West
Virginia.
   Others suggested that Marilyn start a club, and a Missouri
sporting goods store owner offered T-shirts and other paraphernalia
to get it off to a good start.
   Marilyn and her husband travel about 30,000 miles a year in
their antique business, and she said she was hitting the road
Wednesday.
   Ah, springtime, with its warming breezes, budding trees and _
with a little luck _ maybe even the tang of skunk spray.

   The Soviet Union has sold Libya from 12 to 15
high-performance fighter-bombers capable of striking long-range
targets in the Middle East and posing a potential threat to Egypt
and possibly Israel, Bush administration officials said Wednesday.
   Without confirming the transaction, the State Department sharply
criticized Libya and, indirectly, the Soviet Union.
   ``The sale of any kind of sophisticated weaponry to Libya would
be a dangerous thing, given (Libyan leader Moammar) Gadhafi's past
behavor,'' spokesman Richard Boucher said.
   And, he said, if the Soviets made such a deal, ``we would be
concerned.''
   Because the transaction was uncovered through U.S. intelligence,
administration officials publicly would neither deny nor confirm
reports of it. But privately, officials speaking on the condition
of anonymity said the Soviets had begun delivery of the supersonic
SU-24 Fencers.
   One official found even more disturbing Soviet assistance to
Libya in lengthening the range of Soviet-build refueling planes. He
said that could pose a danger to Egypt, long at odds with Libya,
and possibly with Israel, whose existence is hotly challenged by
Gadhafi.
   ``We have long been concerned with Gadhafi's erratic and
dangerous behavior,'' Boucher said. ``Libya continues to act in an
unacceptable fashion, particularly in its support for terrorism and
international subversion.''
   He said the United States had talked to the Soviets about arms
sales in the region. With Soviet bombers ``Libya could threaten all
of its neighbors,'' Boucher said.
   The SU-24 Fencers, which can fly within an 800-mile radius
without refueling, were broken into pieces, crated in large boxes
and delivered to the Libyans aboard Soviet transport planes,
Pentagon sources said.
   The Fencers, whose cost was not known, are likely to be based in
eastern Libya. Egypt is directly east of the North African country.

<TEXT>
   People of northern Namibia say heavy
fighting between guerrillas and South African-led troops has left
them confused and disappointed with the United Nations, but they
remain loyal to the guerrillas.
   Many residents believed the U.N. forces would be activated April
1 and monitor a peaceful transition to independence for the
mineral-rich territory South Africa has ruled for 74 years.
   But at least 200 people have been killed since fighting erupted
Saturday, according to South African officials who say most
casualties belonged to the guerrilla South-West Africa People's
Organization. The guerrillas say about 50 of those killed were
civilians.
   ``We are disappointed in the situation, but we don't know who to
blame,'' said Gabriel Nekongo, 38, who teaches near Oshakati.
   South Africa says SWAPO sent 1,400 guerrillas into the territory
from bases in southern Angola in a deliberate attempt to sabotage
the peace process. A U.N. investigation found SWAPO fighters
launched a ``major incursion'' into northern Namibia, according to
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   SWAPO, which gets most of its military support from East bloc
nations, says the heavily armed guerrillas had been in the
territory some time and acted only in self-defense after South
African-led security forces attacked them.
   Residents are not sure what to believe. Most have little
education and rely largely on word of mouth. Newspapers are not
readily available and the territory's television and radio stations
are controlled by the South African government, which most
Namibians regard with suspicion.
   SWAPO draws most support from northern Namibians who comprise
about half the nation's 1.3 million people. Residents say they
still are loyal to the movement and doubt the organization
intentionally would disrupt the independence process.
   One rumor circulating is that the South Africans dressed up
prisoners and forced them to stage mock battles. Others say
security forces have crossed into Angola in pursuit of SWAPO
guerrillas.
   Residents also say they have been disillusioned by the inability
of the U.N. peacekeeping troops to control events. Although 4,650
soldiers have been authorized for the Namibia operation, less than
300 are in the northern war zone of this countr larger than the
state of New Mexico.
   ``They will have to prove their credibility before we can trust
them again,'' said Fobie Jacobs, who works at the Human Rights
Center in Oshakati. ``The U.N. should send more troops to the
north. They should never have implemented (independence) without at
least half of UNTAG here,'' he said of the U.N. Transition
Assistance Group.
   The few U.N. troops present are often seen in the company of the
security forces, further undermining their credibility in the minds
of many Namibians.
   A U.N. soldier stands watch at the gate to Oshakati's white
township, which includes military and police bases and a
residential area reserved for whites.
   A few U.N. peacekeepers have been seen driving around Oshakati,
but they maintain a low profile.
   ``They come to the bottle (liquor) store, then leave,'' said one
black businessman. ``I guess they cannot talk to us. I guess they
have to be impartial.''

   The Bush administration on Wednesday welcomed
the Polish accord recognizing the Solidarity trade union movement,
suggesting ``the historic step'' will warm relations between
Washington and Warsaw.
   ``This is a great day for the Polish people and for freedom,''
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   He said the United States was weighing a variety of economic
moves aimed at encouraging the movement toward freedom in Eastern
Europe.
   Fitzwater spoke soon after the communist government in Warsaw
signed a pact recognizing Lech Walesa's trade union movement and
clearing the way for the first free elections in post-war Poland.
   Fitzwater said the United States hopes the agreement ``will
eventually take Poland far from totalitarianism and towards a
better political and economic future.''
   Fitzwater said Bush administration officials are ``following the
developments in Poland closely and are consulting with Congress and
our friends and allies on this issue.''
   He noted that as vice president, Bush had traveled to Poland in
September 1987, visiting with both Walesa and Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski, the Communist party chief, and that Bush at the time
``urged dialogue and reconciliation to bring about economic growth
and political freedom.''
   ``The president today is very pleased by the accords that have
started Poland on this new path of reconciliation,'' Fitzwater said.
   A thaw in U.S.-Polish relations since early 1987 has led to the
lifting of some sanctions Washington imposed on the Warsaw
government after its military quashed the Solidarity free trade
union movement in December 1981.
   Asked whether the United States was willing to expand trade and
commerce with Poland in view of the latest accord, Fitzwater said,
``We feel very confident about the process that is under way in
Poland.''
   He said that Bush has talked of ``the American interest in
promoting economic change and reform in that country and in
fostering reconciliation. Now that we have these accords, we are
considering issues or moves that might be taken which would, in
various ways, foster economic development and help move that
process forward.''
   Asked what steps were under consideration, Fitzwater said, ``I
don't have a timetable . ... But we are looking at various actions
that could be taken and hopefully within the not-too-distant
future, we'll have something to announce.''

   More than 60 percent of the train drivers on
London's subway system staged a wildcat strike Wednesday, shutting
down service to wide areas of the capital.
   The results included one-hour delays on some city buses and
heavy traffic jams on the approaches to Heathrow airport.
   The Circle, Metropolitan, District, East London and Jubilee
lines were closed, and the Piccadilly line, which serves Heathrow,
closed after a few hours of service. Normal service was maintained
only on the Northern, Victoria and Central lines.
   London Underground reported that more than 1,500 of the system's
2,400 drivers took part in the action.
   Wednesday's action was taken by drivers seeking a pay raise of
$108 per week for operating trains without a second crew member,
known as a guard, who operates the doors.
   ``Now that most of our trains are one-person operated we need
quickly to talk through the impact on working arrangements and to
establish a new pay and conditions package,'' said Denis
Tunnicliffe, managing director of the Underground.

<HEAD>Twin Cities Move To Regulate Plastic Packaging</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA WILKINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A twin attack by Minnesota's Twin Cities
on plastic food packaging advanced Wednesday with St. Paul
embracing a tough prohibition that the industry is considered
likely to challenge in court.
   The City Council's Public Works Committee voted unanimously to
approve an ordinance identical to one enacted Friday across the
Mississippi River in Minneapolis. Since the committee is made up of
all seven council members, its vote left little doubt how the
council will vote on the issue on April 27.
   ``The real theme behind all of this is to send a message to the
industry that we can no longer continue to produce non-recyclable
food packaging,'' said Councilman Bob Long, who wrote the ordinance
and shared it with Minneapolis. ``We cannot afford it
environmentally, and we cannot afford it economically.''
   Advocates say plastics take up too much space and do not
decompose in landfills, and can't safely be incinerated either.
   But a plastics industry group whose 11 company members have
committed $1 million a year toward addressing those concerns says
the Twin Cities' ordinances are unnecessary.
   ``It's not like we need to receive a message,'' said Roger
Bernstein, whose Washington-based Council for Solid Waste Solutions
was formed in October 1988.
   ``I think (the Twin Cities) are looking at more of a quick fix
that gives them the appearance of having done something rather than
working with the industry for a solution.''
   In testimony before the council, Dave Locey of the Minnesota
Soft Drink Association said, ``You are giving no guidance to these
people who manufacture the packaging as to what is environmentally
safe.''
   He also argued that the ordinance is discriminatory in singling
out plastic food packaging to regulate.
   Philip Byrne, an assistant city attorney, responded that
legislation doesn't have to address all aspects of a problem to be
constitutional.
   ``I have been assuming right from day one that there will be
litigation on this ordinance,'' he said.
   The ordinances would prohibit grocery stores and restaurants _
primarily fast-food outlets _ from selling food wrapped in plastics
that can't be recycled, aren't biodegradable or aren't returnable.
   Among the items banned would be foam egg cartons and trays in
meat packages, plastic products shipped into the state such as
ketchup bottles and peanut butter jars, grocery bags, drinking
cups, serving trays and plates.
   The ordinances, which would take effect July 1, 1990, expand on
less stringent laws adopted in New York's Suffolk County, Berkeley,
Calif., and Portland, Ore., Long said.
   Suffolk County and Berkeley don't include plastics shipped in;
Portland only bans plastic foam, he said.
   In the Twin Cities, exceptions would be made for packages that
have no substitute, such as microwave dinner trays, and for plastic
soda bottles and milk jugs, provided the cities include them in
curbside recycling programs.
   The cities' health commissioners would be empowered to make
other exceptions, for example, if acceptable packaging would put a
company at a clear economic disadvantage.
   Industry officials said they were trying to determine which
products would be affected.
   ``We're still taking stock, literally,'' said Joel Hoiland,
president of the Minnesota Grocers Association.
   ``I would call it an administrative nightmare,'' said Raymond
Peterson of the Amoco Foam Products Co. in Chippewa Falls, Wis.
   The grocers' group is turning its attention to a recycling bill
pending in the state Senate that would pre-empt local ordinances,
Hoiland said.
   John Ruston of the non-profit Environmental Defense Fund in New
York said that the local ordinances are a largely symbolic way of
addressing a national environmental problem.
   Still, he said, ``I think it will cause some plastic packaging
companies to realize they can hold a marketing advantage if there
are products packaged in environmentally beneficial containers.''

<HEAD>Moscow Official Says He Felt Voters' Wrath</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Moscow official trounced in multiple-candidate
elections acknowledged he and other party and government officials
lost because voters are unhappy that economic reforms have not
improved their lives.
   Moscow party Second Secretary Yuri Prokofiev said in an
interview published Wednesday that he lost his bid for a seat in a
new parliament because voters blamed him for urban problems and the
failure of national economic reforms to improve their standard of
living.
   ``My rivals did not have to answer any questions about the
situation in the country, the city, the district. I got such
questions by the dozen,'' he told the weekly Moscow News.
   Prokofiev said he had been in his job for just a half-year and
that much of the criticism of the slow implementation of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of perestroika, or overhaul of
Soviet society, was unjustly leveled at him.
   ``Perestroika has been continuing already four years,'' the
Moscow official said. ``People want to see real changes. There are
some _ in thinking, in culture, in foreign policy and in that the
people awoke to active political life.
   ``But if you're speaking about economics, then no radical
changes have occurred yet. People, more than anything, react to
changes in their standard of living. So I can understand their
critical mood.''
   Gorbachev said last week that party and government leaders lost
in the March 26 elections because people were fed up with
mismanagement. He said the losers had been ``restructuring slowly
and not expanding ties with workers.''
   The elections brought humiliating rejection for many top party
officials in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev and elsewhere, including some
who were running unopposed. Candidates had to receive approval from
more than 50 percent of the voters to win.
   Prokofiev won just 13.5 percent of the vote in the elections to
the new 2,250-member Congress of Peoples Deputies. His opponent,
Alexander Kazamarov, a construction official, won 52.1 percent.
   In the interview, Prokofiev said government and party leaders
won't win popular support until their promises of better living
conditions are fulfilled.
   ``Until the situation in the city is changed, its leaders cannot
count on (election) success,'' Prokofiev said.
   Many reforms haven't reached the people, he said, because
bureaucrats are ``old and work in the old way.''
   Also Wednesday, the Communist Party daily Pravda reported voters
chose party members for 88 percent of the parliament seats that
have been filled so far.
   About 80 percent of candidates running in the first
multicandidate elections in 70 years were party members.
   Pravda said final results showed that voters declined to elect a
candidate in one out of every eight parliamentary districts, even
though they had a choice of only one or two candidates.
   That means that in 195 of the 1,500 geographical districts
nationwide, and in three others in which less than 50 percent of
the electorate voted, new campaigns will start for a second
election to be held May 14.
   Runoff elections will be held Sunday in 76 districts for seats
in which no candidate received a majority.
   Moscow News gave the results of nominations for representatives
of the Academy of Sciences in the new parliament. The academy,
other officially sanctioned organizations and the Communist Party
selected 750 seats.
   The newspaper said that of the nominees for the 12 unfilled
academy seats, human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov had
received the most support. Sakharov received support from 62
institutes under the academy's umbrella in Moscow and Leningrad; 59
were for space scientist Roald Sagdeyev; and 57 backed economist
Nikolai Shmelev.
   Those three had been rejected in January by the academy's
leadership, but its members pushed through their names last month,
rejecting 15 officially favored candidates.

<HEAD>West German Measures Aim to Cut Illegal Polish Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday announced
new measures to cut the number of Poles who enter West Germany on
tourist visas illegally to work or sell goods.
   They are also expected to reduce the number of Poles applying
for political asylum each year, said government spokesman Friedhelm
Ost.
   Under the measures, Polish citizens who apply for tourist visas
will be required to carry the equivalent of $27 for each day of
their visit. Those without the required money will be turned back
at the border, Ost said.
   He said West German authorities would be more stringent in
granting visa requests and would deny visas to Poles previously
involved in illegal activities in West Germany.
   He said the new measures were aimed at discouraging Poles from
visiting West Germany soley to earn hard currency.
   West Germany is the favored destination of thousands of Poles
who sell goods that they buy cheaply in Poland or offer their labor
at rates that undercut those of Germans.
   Some Poles say they earn in just three months in West Germany
what they would earn in a year in Poland.
   But the new restrictions were not meant to discourage Poles from
visiting or moving to West Germany, Ost said.
   Juergen Chrobog, spokesman for the West German Foreign Ministry,
said he did not know how many Poles worked illegally in West
Germany but estimated the number as ``tens of thousands.''
   According to government figures, in 1988, 29,000 Poles who
entered West Germany with a tourist visa later applied for
political asylum. Only 2.6 percent of those applications were
approved.

   First lady Barbara Bush, kicking off a
national campaign to end child abuse, said Wednesday that even
small things can make a difference in preventing abuse.
   ``Sometimes it's as simple as being a good neighbor, listening
to a young mother talk over a cup of coffee or, even better,
offering to take the children for an hour or two,'' she said.
   Addressing a news conference kicking off the sixth annual
National Child Abuse Prevention Month, the first lady said that
``it's not enough to just feel, and when we hear of a child who's
been seriously injured or even killed, to be sad. That's not
enough. Then it's too late.
   ``The time to get involved is before the blow lands.''
   She urged that, ``if we know of a problem, we should reach out
to the parent and suggest they get help; and, if we know of a child
who is at serious risk, we must not be afraid to get involved, even
if that means picking up the phone and calling the authorities.''
   Mrs. Bush led off a list of celebrity speakers, including Cheryl
Ladd, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Edward Woodward, Carol Lawrence, Norm
Crosby and Jack Scalia, who said he spoke as an ``adult survivor''
of abuse.
   Scalia said he suffered emotional and verbal abuse, but he said
it was just as devastating and carried some of the same
consequences as physical abuse, including drug and alcohol
addiction.
   Scalia, a former Montreal Expos baseball pitcher and
international model turned actor who is now a regular on
``Dallas,'' said he kicked both alcohol and drugs, but said the
scars of his abuse remain.
   ``My biggest phobia in life is what am I going to do if somebody
ever loves me ... and what am I going to do when I have to love
somebody else. How do I do that,'' Scalia, his eyes glistening with
tears, said to the hushed audience.
   Verbal assaults on children are the focus of a major new media
campaign being coordinated by the Advertising Council, a nonprofit
organization established by the advertising industry to create
public service ads addressing key issues.
   The theme of the campaign is ``words can hit a child as hard as
a fist,'' said Molly Hudson, senior vice president of Lintas: USA,
which is developing the print and video campaign.
   A nationwide survey by the National Committee for the Prevention
of Child Abuse estimated that more than 2.2 million child abuse
reports were filed in 1988, an increase of 3 percent over the
number reported in 1987. Also last year, more than 1,200 children
died as the result of maltreatment, about 5 percent more than the
previous year.
   Childhelp, a national nonprofit organization involved in the
treatment, prevention and research of child abuse, said its
nationwide hotline _ 1-800-4-A-CHILD _ received 175,000 calls last
year, up 18 percent from 1987.

<HEAD>Bill Encourages States to Set up Prenatal Care Centers to Combat
Infant Mortality</HEAD>

   States would be encouraged to send counselors
out into inner city neighborhoods and rural backwoods and set up
``one-stop shopping'' centers for poor pregnant women in search of
health care under federal legislation introduced Wednesday.
   The package is intended to complement recent expansions in
Medicaid eligibility which make free health care available for
pregnant women with incomes up to 85 percent above official poverty
lines.
   While that additional coverage should go a long way toward
raising the United States from 19th place among the world's
industrialized nations in infant mortality, Sen. Bill Bradley,
D-N.J., said the ``information barrier'' is another major hindrance.
   If women are not aware the benefits are available, or don't know
how to get them, he said, then the programs don't do much good.
   Japan led the world with an infant mortality rate of 5.2 deaths
per 1,000 births in 1986, the last year full figures were
available. The United States was 19th with 10.4 deaths per 1,000
births.
   Bradley was among several senators and House members present at
a news conference who serve double duty as members of the National
Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality.
   Former Sen. Lawton Chiles of Florida, chairman of the
commission, said the legislation envisions setting aside $100
million for distribution to states for starting outreach programs,
setting up telephone hot lines and generally trying to see that
every pregnant woman gets the prenatal care to which she is
entitled.
   The commission's ``Death Before Life'' report issued last August
said 40,000 infants die during the first year of life in the United
States each year who could be saved with proper care.
   While acknowledging the outreach programs would cost money,
Chiles cited an Institute of Medicine report last year what
concluded $3 is saved for every $1 spent on prenatal health care.
   ``It's not only the 40,000 babies who die each year, it's the
385,000 who live but have serious handicaps,'' said Lynda Robb, a
commission member.
   Bradley added that, while the financial benefits to investing in
prenatal care are real and documented, there are more important
considerations.
   ``Not only does this go to efficiency, but to who we are as a
people,'' said Bradley.

<HEAD>Khrushchev Speech Condemning Stalin to be Published in USSR</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviets soon will get their first chance to read
the ``secret speech'' that Nikita S. Khrushchev gave 33 years ago
condemning Josef Stalin's bloody years in power.
   Soviet TV, in its evening news broadcast ``Vremya,'' said a full
text of the speech is contained in the April edition of News of the
Communist Party Central Committee.
   For years, prominent Soviets have called for the publication of
Khrushchev's speech at the 20th Communist Party Congress on Feb.
25, 1956, three years after Stalin's death.
   The text was leaked almost immediately to the West and some
Soviets learned about it from summaries read at party meetings at
the time. But for the Soviet public at large, the details of the
speech have been a mystery.
   In the speech, ``On the cult of personality and its
consequences,'' Khrushchev accused Stalin of seriously damaging
Soviet society by purging the party. He said Stalin had used
torture, arrests and fabricated charges.
   He did not tell the whole story of Stalin's crimes, however,
omitting reference to Stalin's war against the peasants and
ignoring Khrushchev's own participation in the reign of terror.
   Khrushchev freed many people imprisoned under Stalin and pulled
back from other repressive measures, but the ``destalinization''
stopped after Khrushchev left office in 1964. President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has resumed it, and discussion of Stalin's repressions is
now widespread.
   The News of the Communist Party Central Committee is the same
publication that in February printed another famous secret speech,
that of former Moscow party boss Boris N. Yeltsin. In that speech,
delivered at a Central Committee meeting in October 1987, Yeltsin
said Gorbachev was being glorified and that the Soviet people had
gained virtually nothing from the Soviet leader's reforms.
   The monthly says it has a circulation of 650,000, but ``Vremya''
said subscriptions were being expanded.

with toxic PCBs upstream from the city's supply of drinking water.
   ``We still don't know how serious it is for the drinking water
in Trois Rivieres,'' said Yvon Gelinas, spokesman for the
provincial Environment Department.
   He said the oil leaked into the St. Maurice River on Tuesday
while it was being transfered at the Consolidated-Bathurst Inc.
pulp and paper plant. Trois Rivieres, a city of 53,000 people, is
midway between Montreal and the city of Quebec.
   ``We're trying to recover as much oil as we can from the river
and put together an evaluation of the impact on the environment,''
Gelinas said.
   PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, are used mainly as a coolant
in electrical transformers. Their production has been banned in
Canada.
   In August, a fire at a warehouse storing PCB-laced oil forced
the evacuation of 3,300 people from a Montreal suburb.

   A jury on Wednesday convicted a former
librarian of all charges that he shot and killed six people and
wounded 10 others in a rampage at two shopping centers in 1987.
   William Bryan Cruse Jr., 61, stood with bowed head and crossed
arms as Circuit Judge John Antoon read off the 32 guilty verdicts.
There was no reaction or comment from the frail, bearded defendant.
   The jury deliberated 10{ hours over two days before finding
Cruse guilty of six counts of first-degree murder, 22 counts of
attempted first-degree murder, two counts of attempted
second-degree murder, one count of kidnapping and one count of
false imprisonment.
   ``We're happy that the jury rejected the insanity defense and
found it was an act of cold-blooded murder,'' said State Attorney
Norm Wolfinger.
   The sentencing phase of the trial, in which jurors recommend a
non-binding verdict of death or a life sentence, begins April 17,
just a week before the second anniversary of the rampage at two
Palm Bay shopping centers.
   It would be up to Cruse to decide whether to appeal, said Public
Defender J.R. Russo, whose office represented the defendant.
   ``I've said all along I wanted him found guilty, that I wanted
him executed, and that I wanted to pull the switch,'' said Vi
Johnson, mother of Gerald Johnson, one of two police officers among
the six people killed.
   Her 27-year-old son lay wounded on the pavement next to his
patrol car in the Winn-Dixie supermarket parking lot when Cruse
approached with his high-powered rifle and fired three more bullets
into him.
   The prosecution argued this was only one example rebutting
defense contentions that the gunman was insane and didn't know what
he was doing.
   The defense argued that Cruse had been mentally ill for years
and was acting under delusions that everyone considered him
homosexual. Psychiatrists on both sides of the issue agreed on his
mental illness but disagreed sharply on the issue of legal insanity
under Florida law.
   In addition to mental illness, this requires a finding that the
defendant not know what he was doing or the consequences, and that
he did not know it was wrong.
   The shootout started when Cruse drove up to the Publix store
after an afternoon of drinking beer. He began firing from his car
and almost immediately killed Nobil Al-Hameli, 25, and Al-Tawakuly,
18, Kuwaitis attending a local college, as they emerged from a
store.
   Cruse then drove across the street into Sabal Palm Square, got
out of his car, shot Johnson and Officer Ronald Grogan, 28, and
fired dozens of other shots as motorists and pedestrians fled and
sought cover.
   He killed 67-year-old Ruth Green as she sat in her car. He shot
out the front windows of the Winn-Dixie Store, stormed in,
sporadically firing his semiautomatic Ruger Mini-14 and sending
dozens of shoppers fleeing out the back. The sixth victim, Lester
Watson, 51, was killed at that time.
   Cruse then found two store employees hiding in a restroom and
forced them out. He released one but held the other hostage for
about seven hours. At about 2 a.m., he released her and police
fired tear gas to force him out.
   Cruse has a history of mental instability and bizarre actions
daing to the 1970s in his hometown of Lexington, Ky., according to
psychiatrists and defense witnesses. He came to Florida in 1985.
   His main trial lawyer, Marlene Alva, called Cruse ``a madman, a
crazy person, someone who went berserk.''
   Wolfinger agreed Cruse was mentally ill. However, ``that's not
enough to find him legally insane,'' he said. ``We will seek the
death penalty.''

<TEXT>
   Kenyan legislators, taking their cue from
President Daniel arap Moi, are lambasting the Kennedy clan for
attacking this East African nation's human rights record.
   Moi kicked off a continuing orgy of vituperation Saturday by
rebuking the daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy for her
criticisms.
   Kenya ``does not need a foreigner to supervise us,'' Moi told a
fund-raising party where he again denied his government abuses
human rights.
   The next day, Moi's words were echoed by a district chairman of
Kenya's sole legal political party, who announced plans for a
massive anti-Kennedy rally. The rally was canceled, but criticism
of the Kennedys continues.
   On Tuesday, Parliament set aside two hours for Cabinet members
and legislators to join the fray.
   More than 15 politicians stood to cast abuse on Mary Kerry
Kennedy, daughter of the one-time attorney general; her mother,
Ethel Kennedy; and her uncle, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   Vice President Josephat Karanja accused the Kennedys of being
``part and parcel of a campaign to discredit Kenya.''
   ``Democracy in Kenya is not at risk. It is very safe. It is the
reputation of Kuria and the Kennedys which is at risk.''
   All three of Nairobi's English-language newspapers carried
extensive coverage of the session in Wednesday editions that
dwelled on politicians' descriptions of Ms. Kennedy, 29, as ``this
little girl,'' ``this particular calf'' and ``this baby.''
   The Kennedys found no defenders.
   Kerry and Ethel Kennedy visited Nairobi last week to present the
1988 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award to the country's leading
human rights lawyer, Gibson Kamau Kuria.
   The award was presented in Nairobi because the government
confiscated Kuria's passport, barring him from attending the
November ceremony at Georgetown University in Washington.
   Kuria was arrested in 1987 and detained as a security risk for
nine months without charge. He was arrested the day after he sued
the government for release of three political prisoners whom he
charged had been starved, confined in flooded cells and severely
beaten by their jailers.
   The award citation called Oxford-educated Kuria, 42, ``one of
the few lawyers in Kenya who defends political prisoners.'' It said
those who do ``fear government harassment, or worse.''
   Before departing Friday, Ms. Kennedy, executive director of the
Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights, said she is
concerned about a Kenyan law permitting unlimited detention of
prisoners without charge or trial and Parliament's removal of
guaranteed tenure for judges.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the
government and Union Carbide Corp. to disclose all the negotiations
that led to a $470 million settlement for victims of the Bhopal gas
leak.
   The Press Trust of India news agency said a five-judge panel
asked the government to file an affidavit within three weeks
disclosing all documents, negotiations, and people involved in the
negotiations.
   The panel, headed by Chief Justice R.S. Pathak, said it was
passing the order to ascertain whether the Feb. 14 settlement was
reasonable, PTI said.
   Several opposition politicians and newspapers have termed the
settlement inadequate. The government originally sued Union Carbide
for $3 billion in connection with the 1984 gas leak in Bhopal.
   More than 3,000 people died and at least 20,000 were injured
when deadly methyl isocynate gas leaked Dec. 3, 1984 from a
pesticide plant run by the Indian subsidiary of Union Carbide.
   Under a special law passed in Parliament, the government became
the sole representative of more than 500,000 people who claimed to
be Bhopal victims.
   The validity of the law has been challenged by at least two
petitions in the court.
   A five-judge panel of the court Wednesday heard arguments by
attorney Raj Kumar Garg on one of the petitions.
   ``This uncontrolled power appropriated by the government ...
would render the settlement void on the ground of impermissible and
excessive delegation of legislative function,'' PTI quoted Garg as
saying.

<HEAD>California Lawmakers Accuse Feds of Covering Up Spill Risks off West
Coast</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two lawmakers charged Wednesday that the
federal government hid the possibility of a major oil spill on the
West Coast, and they called on President Bush to cancel further oil
leasing off California.
   California Democrats Sen. Alan Cranston and Rep. Mel Levine
blamed the Reagan administration for what they called a cover-up
and asked Bush to review the oil leasing program.
   ``The federal government refused to plan for a worst-case spill
scenario in Alaska and the result is one of the nation's worst
environmental disasters,'' Levine said. ``Now we learn that
government tried to deliberately cover up information about spills
in California.''
   Levine released internal memoranda from officials of Reagan's
Interior Department about the proposed lease sale in northern
California in which warnings from the Fish and Wildlife Service
were dismissed by the Minerals Management Service. Both agencies
are under the jurisdiction of then Secretary Donald Hodel, a Reagan
appointee.
   ``The material released today demonstrates the serious risks of
spills, the ineffectiveness of clean-up technology and other
environmental damage from lease sale 91 (in California), and that
the Reagan administration tried to cover up that information,''
said Levine.
   A spokesman for Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, asked for
comment, said the new interior secretary has made it clear he would
not condone development unless it is ``environmentally prudent.''
   Lujan is chairing a task force appointed by President Bush to
review the three California lease sales, including lease sale 91,
scheduled for 1990. It will have its first meeting April 12. No
action will be taken on the lease sales until the task force makes
its report.
   ``The task force might find that the lease sales should be
stopped,'' said the spokesman, spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Levine said warnings from the Fish and Wildlife Service about
offshore drilling risks in California were deleted from the final
draft of a Minerals Management Service report last year.
   He released a memo from Steven Griles, then assistant interior
secretary in charge of offshore development, which said the fish
and wildlife comments ``could prove very damaging to this lease
sale.''
   Several California newspapers last spring published stories
about the disagreement between fish and wildlife and the minerals
management. At the time, the Interior Department said the comments
were being deleted because they were irrelevant and contained
comments or opinions not supported by facts.
   Among the deletions, Levine said, were warnings that tanker
traffic is at high risk operating in rough seas, current technology
cannot effectively clean up a spill, containment equipment is not
deployable in severe weather, and in calm weather it is only partly
effective.
   Levine also released a memo from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration and one from the San Francisco office of
the Environmental Protection Agency which said minerals management
was playing down the environmental risks of an oil spill.
   Richard Sanderson, director of the office of federal activities
for EPA in Washington, disputed Levine's contention that EPA
headquarters tried to water down environmental concerns about oil
leasing.
   He said that the EPA had strong environmental objections to
lease sale 91 and gave it a rating so poor that it was nearly a
veto.
   As for the relationship between the California lease sales and
what should have been known about the potential of a disaster in
Valdez, Sanderson said, ``That was 20 years ago.''
   He said more is known now about the effects of oil spills then
when the environmental impact statements were made giving the
go-ahead for oil transportation out of Prince William Sound.

   The government deployed troops and imposed a
curfew in the northern town of Anantnag on Wednesday to quell
violence by Moslem youths protesting the death of a leader in
police custody, a senior official said.
   Policemen were ordered to shoot rioters, who burned a Cabinet
minister's house, and hurled stones at police, said Moosa Raza, the
top administrator of Jammu-Kashmir, India's only Moslem majority
state.
   At least five people were injured when angry mobs in nearby
Srinagar clashed with police on the third consecutive day of a
Moslem strike to protest alleged police violence and the arrests of
Moslem youths, Raza said.
   Since the strike was called Monday, at least two people died and
39 others were injured, Raza said.
   On Wednesday, a bomb exploded in a suburb of Jammu, shattering
windows but causing no injuries, Raza said.
   Police in Anantnag, 75 miles north of Jammu, used tear gas to
disperse armed youths who stoned and set fire to the house of
Revenue Minister P.L. Handoo, a Hindu, Raza said. The town is
predominantly Moslem.
   Moslem mobs also attacked and burned a police station,
government buildings and the houses of several Hindus, Raza said. A
curfew was imposed and the army called in after police failed to
curb the violence, he said.
   The Moslems were protesting the death of Gulam Mohammed Shah,
who allegedly was beaten by police. According to Shah's son, Shabir
Ahmed, his father was dragged from his home and beaten by police,
allegedly for giving shelter to a pro-Pakistan Moslem militant.
   Police said the elder Shah died of natural causes when he was
called in for questioning.
   Jammu-Kashmir state is claimed by both India and Pakistan. The
neighbors have fought three wars since both became independent from
Britain in 1947. Troops from the United Nations patrol the state's
disputed borders.

   What the government and opposition gained
and lost in the ``round-table'' talks that concluded Wednesday:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>TRADE UNIONS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The government agreed to allow the formation of independent
unions, specifically giving legal status to the independent trade
union Solidarity, and to legalize under a separate law the farmers'
union Rural Solidarity.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said restoration of the
independent groups, banned since the imposition of martial law in
December 1981, was the minimum requirement from the talks.
   An early victory for Solidarity in the talks was the agreement
by authorities to amend the existing labor law so that Solidarity
could be registered nationwide in one step, and not need to
register separately its internal structures.
   At the end of the talks, authorities agreed to a Solidarity
demand that workers fired for union activities after martial law be
legally entitled to reinstatement.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>POLITICAL REFORMS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Elections _ Solidarity agreed to participate in parliamentary
elections, scheduled for June, in which the Communist Party and its
allies will be assured of a 65 percent majority in the 460-member
Sejm. Solidarity agreed to this essentially undemocratic
arrangement on condition it be for one time only. It poses the risk
Solidarity will be perceived as legitimizing communist rule.
   The government agreed to Solidarity's demand that subsequent
elections will either be fully or much more democratic.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Senate _ A 100-member senate would be created and become the
first fully democratically chosen legislative chamber in the East
bloc. Anyone who collected 3,000 signatures could get on the ballot.
   The Senate would advise the Sejm and exercise veto powers over
its bills. It would take a two-thirds Sejm majority to override a
Senate veto. The government wanted the Senate to be weaker, while
Solidarity wanted the Senate's veto power to be strong.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   President _ The post of president would be created to be elected
by the Sejm and the senate to a six-year term this year. The
Communist Party, with its majority in the larger Sejm, could be
expected to control the election of the first president, who would
likely be the current party leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski. The
president will be able to dissolve the National Assembly and call
new elections in cases of constitutional crisis, and be able to
veto Sejm acts the same way as the senate can.
   Solidarity originally had wanted either no presidency or a
weaker presidency, but agreed in exchange for the freely elected
senate.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Associations _ Various pro-Solidarity professional associations,
for groups like artists and journalists, and the Independent
Students Association banned after martial law would be legalized.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ISSUES</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Indexation _ Wages would be indexed to increases in prices to
reduce the impact of inflation, now running at about 60 pecent
annually. Solidarity and the government agreed that wages would be
compensated at the rate of 80 percent of the inflation rate, unless
the payments would bankrupt the employer.
   The government had originally opposed indexation, saying it
would fuel inflation. The official trade union OPZZ raised an
objection that the cost-of-living compensation should be 100
percent, not 80 percent, and paid in a lump sum to workers rather
than a percentage of their pay.
   Media access _ The opposition would get access to the media,
including a daily newspaper and two weeklies and at least one
program a week on national TV and radio, with a Solidarity
supporter who is also agreeable to the government serving as host.
Censorship would be eased.
   Solidarity failed to win its aim for the opposition to have
sovereign control of an allotted block of TV and radio time.

   Scandinavian airlines were put on a
security alert after Arab terrorists threatened to hijack a jet or
attack an airport in the region, an airline official said Wednesday.
   Scandinavian Airlines System, received the threat Tuesday
through Swedish security police, said SAS spokeswoman Carina
Sandefjord.
   ``It's apparently a general threat against planes and airports
in all Scandinavian countries,'' she said.
   SAS is owned by the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark,
but the threat also could apply to the several domestic airlines in
the region, she said.
   ``The threat was made by an Arab terrorist group,'' she said,
declining to say which group was involved.
   Ms. Sandefjord said SAS was not told whether the threat was
delivered directly to Swedish police or came from a foreign
intelligence service.
   Three months ago, SAS received bomb threats against planes,
subsidiary airlines and hotels that sparked a worldwide security
alert and delayed schedules for two weeks.
   Security was stepped up at all Scandinavian international
airports after the latest warning. ``But since we don't know when
or where the attack is supposed to take place it makes it very
difficult,'' Ms. Sandefjord said.
   On Tuesday, the U.S. government said it would force airlines to
take stricter anti-terrorism measures in the wake of the December
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. New security measures included the
installation of devices to detect plastic explosives and stricter
compliance with aviation and security warnings.

   A truck bombing killed a witness in a
3-year-old federal drug smuggling investigation and authorities
fear it was ordered by targets of the probe.
   James Collins Sr., 60, of Sebring, died of massive burns and
injuries Tuesday after plastic explosives detonated in the truck he
was driving, said Sam Jones, an agent with the Florida Department
of Law Enforcement. The explosives were hooked to the truck's
battery, he said.
   ``Mr. Collins, his sons and his son-in-law were all witnesses in
pending federal drug cases,'' Jones said. ``Those cases are
ongoing, and we've placed family members and other associates of
the victim in protective custody.''
   Philip Ramer, head of the law enforcement agency's Tampa office,
said he believed the explosion was connected to Collins'
cooperation with federal authorities.
   Collins was backing the truck along a driveway when the cab
exploded, witnesses said.
   Anthony Simonetti, sitting in his garage across the street, said
the blast knocked him back six feet.
   ``There was a lot of flame, and then I saw that poor old man
trying to squeeze through the window,'' he said.
   Debris was thrown up to 100 feet away.
   The drug investigation, dubbed Operation Overlook, is being
conducted by the Fort Myers office of the state law enforcement
agency in conjunction with U.S. Customs, the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration and other agencies, Jones said.

   Communist Vietnam's announcement Wednesday that it will withdraw
all troops from Cambodia by Sept. 30 appears to be a major first
step toward diplomatic relations with the United States after more
than 40 years of estrangement.
   But a historic exchange of ambassadors between Washington and
Hanoi still appears a way off.
   A verifiable withdrawal of the estimated 70,000 Vietnamese
troops in Cambodia and compliance with other U.S demands including
the restoration of peace and an elected government in a neutral,
non-aligned Cambodia, would remove major obstacles to U.S.
recognition.
   Diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam would
probably bring American aid, which Hanoi needs badly to catch up
economically and technically with the rest of the world.
   Diplomatic recognition could expedite humanitarian concerns.
These include a quicker accounting of as many as possible of the
2,383 Americans listed as missing in action and more rapid
immigration to the United States of 10,000 to 16,000 Amerasians,
children of American fathers and Vietnamese mothers born during the
war between 1963 and 1975.
   Ending the U.S. trade embargo could open the way for American
investment in Vietnam, including oil exploration, and improve
Vietnam's trade imbalance. The country now imports three times more
than what it exports.
   Realizing it cannot survive with 25 percent unemployment and
high inflation, Vietnam appears to be emerging as more open and
conciliatory. It is opening its doors and its harbors, even
courting capitalism, and welcoming American visitors back more than
ever before.
   Vietnamese officials seem to think that the withdrawal of their
troops from Cambodia after 10 years will accommodate the United
States and save Vietnam's failing economy. Vietnam has been
ostracized and isolated from Western aid because of its occupation
of Cambodia.
   ``As the U.S. has repeatedly said that they will normalize
relations with Vietnam after we withdraw all our forces from
Cambodia, we're now waiting to see if they keep their promise,''
said Ha Huy Thong, a spokesman for Vietnam's Permanent Mission to
the United Nations.
   ``That's not exactly what we said,'' declared Ken Bailes, a
spokesman for the State Department's Office of Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia Affairs.
   ``We do believe that if the withdrawal is carried out, it would
be a positive development,'' the State Department said in a
statement.
   The U.S. position is that it is prepared to move ahead with
normalization of relations with Vietnam once there is an acceptable
settlement in Cambodia, of which the withdrawal of Vietnamese
troops is only one component.
   ``We believe any agreement which fails to address Cambodia's
future in a comprehensive manner would not be sustainable,'' said
Bailes. ``Important differences remain, particularly on the
formation of an interim government pending elections.''
   As part of a comprehensive accord, the United States has
proposed safeguards against the return of the communist Khmer
Rouge, under whose reign an estimated 2 million Cambodians _
one-fourth of the country's population _ were executed or died of
famine.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, ousting the Khmer
Rouge and installing a government headed by Prime Minister Hun Sen.
   Vietnamese troops have kept Hun Sen in power by beating back a
coalition of Cambodian resistance forces led by Prince Norodom
Sihanouk. The coalition consists of two non-communist factions and
the Khmer Rouge.
   The Khmer Rouge, backed by China, is by far the strongest of the
three factions.
   The United States believes that in any acceptable settlement,
Sihanouk, a former Cambodian leader during the American war, must
head the interim government preceding elections. This is another
stumbling block in U.S.-Vietnamese relations.
   Hun Sen opposes the demand that his government be set aside in
favor of an interim government. He and Sihanouk are scheduled to
meet in Jakarta, Indonesia, on May 2 in efforts to reach an
agreement.

<HEAD>LaRouche Associate Convicted of Nine Counts of Securities Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEESBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rochelle Ascher, an associate of political
extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., was convicted Wednesday of nine
counts of securities violations stemming from LaRouche's
fund-raising activities.
   A Loudoun County Circuit Court jury convicted Ms. Ascher, 38, of
Towson, Md., on single counts of selling an unregistered security
with intent to defraud, sale of a security by an unregistered agent
with intent to defraud, conspiracy, and six counts of securities
fraud involving six sales to four individuals.
   The trial began Jan. 23, and the jury deliberated for more than
five days. The jury fixed the sentence at 86 years in prison.
Virginia Attorney General Mary Sue Terry said the length of the
prison term was ``extraordinary, for a crime in which violence was
not an element.''
   In a statement issued from prison, LaRouche accused both the
jury and Judge Carlton Penn of being ``crooked.''
   LaRouche is serving a 15-year federal prison term for scheming
to defraud federal tax collectors and conspiring to deliberately
default on $30 million in loans from political supporters. LaRouche
failed in presidential bids in 1976, 1980, 1984 and 1988.
   State officials said Ms. Ascher, 15 co-defendants and five
LaRouche organizations were part of a fund-raising operation that
allegedly bilked hundreds of people out of millions of dollars.
   State and federal officials raided LaRouche's Leesburg
headquarters in 1987 to cap an investigation by the Virginia
attorney general's office into allegations that LaRouche supporters
secured loans under false pretenses.
   The trial of other defendants has been moved to Roanoke,
officials said.
   Some of Ms. Ascher's fellow defendants and several former
members of the LaRouche organization testified for the prosecution,
describing the group's fund-raising methods. The money paid for
LaRouche publications, his Leesburg ``safe house'' and television
commercials during his presidential bids.
   During the trial, Ms. Ascher testified she was aware of ``some
problems with repaying loans.'' She said, however, there was never
a policy against repaying the loans.
   Ms. Ascher, who left a teaching position at the Medical College
of Virginia in Richmond in 1980 to join the LaRouche organization,
was a victim of poor record-keeping, her attorney contended during
the trial.

   Government purchases of pork for donation to
schools and other institutions will be stepped up to help bolster
sagging hog prices paid to farmers, Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter said Wednesday.
   The Agriculture Department ``not only has bought more pork this
year, but it also has bought a greater variety of pork items than
in prior years,'' Yeutter said.
   Frozen hams and canned pork are the main items bought by USDA
for distribution to schools and other domestic programs. In
addition, the department soon will begin buying canned luncheon
meat, including pork, he said.
   Farmers have marketed ``unusually high'' numbers of hogs in
recent months, which has helped depress market prices, Yeutter
said. Since July 1, the beginning of the current purchasing year,
USDA has spent more than $96 million for pork, compared with $30
million the previous year.

   Sheep producers soon will be getting checks
totaling about $40 million for wool shorn and marketed last year,
the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   The payments, scheduled to begin April 14, help make up the
difference between the market price of wool and the government's
support price.
   Officials said that the 1988 support price was $1.78 per pound
and that producers received a national average market price of
$1.38 per pound, or 40 cents less than the support.
   For mohair, payments will total about $50 million. The 1988
average market price was $1.89 per pound; the support was $4.69 per
pound.

<HEAD>Couple Who Believe Baby Was Swapped at Birth Petition Appelate Court
Anew</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAUCHULA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple want an appellate court to
reconsider a decision they say could keep them from getting to know
a girl they believe is their daughter lost in a hospital baby swap
a decade ago.
   Ernest and Regina Twigg of Langhorne, Pa., asked the 2nd
District Court of Appeal in Lakeland on Tuesday to reconsider a
ruling last month ordering them to suspend their quest unless they
prove it won't hurt the 10-year-old Sarasota girl they suspect is
their natural daughter.
   Before a judge orders genetic testing of Kimberly Mays, the girl
the Twiggs believe is their daughter, the Twiggs must be specific
about what kind of relationship they want with the girl and must
prove their search won't harm her, a three-judge panel said last
month.
   The ruling backed Robert Mays, a Sarasota roofing contractor who
said his daughter Kimberly might suffer emotional harm if forced to
undergo a genetic test that could threaten her sense of security.
   The Twiggs believe their newborn daughter was swapped 10 years
ago at a Wauchula hospital for the child of Mays and his late wife
Barbara.
   The child raised by the Twiggs, named Arlena, died of congenital
heart disease in 1988. Tests showed Arlena was not related to
either Ernest or Regina Twigg.
   The Twiggs later asked a Sarasota Circuit judge to determine
whether Kimberly is their child. Mays has resisted efforts to test
Kimberly, saying he will not jeopardize his custody of the daughter
he has raised and loved.
   John Blakely, the Twiggs' attorney, asked to make oral arguments
before the appellate court, for review by all 12 judges or for the
court to refer the key questions to the Florida Supreme Court.
   At the heart of the case is whose interests the court should
consider.
   The appellate judges said the child's welfare supersedes the
rights of the parents. Blakely disagrees, saying the ruling
overlooks the Twiggs' constitutional right to custody of a natural
child.
   After the Twiggs declare what sort of relationship they seek
with Kimberly, the appellate panel said a circuit judge would have
to determine if she would be hurt by such a relationship before
allowing a genetic test.
   Mays' attorney, Arthur Ginsburg, could not be reached Wednesday.
His assistant, Judy Lee, said he had not read the court documents
and wouldn't comment until he did.

<HEAD>Court Told Voice On Dramatic Recording Could Be Confessed Hijacker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court-appointed translator said
Wednesday one voice in a dramatic conversation recorded between a
hijacked TWA jetliner and Beirut Airport likely is that of
confessed air pirate Mohammed Ali Hamadi.
   The Frankfurt court also heard Wednesday that the Lebanese
Shiite Moslem terrorist was 21 years old at the time of the 1985
hijacking, and a document he produced claiming he is several years
younger is forged. The ruling will affect sentencing.
   Hamadi is charged with murder and piracy. U.S. Navy diver Robert
Stethem was murdered and 39 Americans were held hostage 17 days
during the ordeal.
   On Wednesday, the court played a tape recording made after the
hijacked airliner, which was flying from Athens to Rome, landed at
Beirut Airport on June 14, 1985.
   The tape recorded the crew's pleas to land at Beirut, with one
saying: ``He (a hijacker) has two hand grenades. We must land at
Beirut, no alternative.''
   It includes sounds of the crew being beaten, and a shout of
``Help!''
   Later, after the plane landed and the hijacker's demands for
fuel were not quickly met, a crewman shouts: ``They are threatening
to kill the passengers! They are beating the passengers! We want
the fuel now _ immediately!''
   At one point an excited voice tells the tower in Arabic: ``Our
grenade is armed! Our weapons are ready! If something doesn't
happen in 1{ minutes I will throw out the first corpse!''
   The following day, Stethem was shot and his body was thrown onto
the airport tarmac. Hamadi says Stethem was killed by his
accomplice, Hassan Ezzedine, who is a fugitive.
   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger asked translator Chesar Magdi
for her opinion of the Arabic voice on the tape, obtained from the
British Broadcasting Corp.
   Mrs. Magdi is considered an expert on Hamadi's speech pattern.
She told the court she felt Hamadi had not spoken on another tape
produced by the FBI.
   She described that voice as deeper than Hamadi's, and said the
Arabic dialect used for the word ``minute'' did not match Hamadi's.
   However, she said the hijacker's voice on the BBC tape ``is more
the lighter voice. The use of the word `minute' I mentioned earlier
also matches.'' The bearded Hamadi sat quietly, showing no reaction.
   Also Wednesday, Mueckenberger said Lebanese officials confirmed
that a verification document listing Hamadi's birthday as July 15,
1968, is forged. Hamadi is being tried by a juvenile court because
of conflicting claims, with court records showing he was born June
13, 1964. Under West German law, Hamadi's maturity at the time of
the hijacking could affect his sentence.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is seriously considering
proposing a 25 percent pay raise for federal judges, a senior
administration official said Wednesday.
   Discussing Bush's thinking on the condition he not be named
publicly, the official also said that the presidential pay raise
recommendation could come in conjunction with an ethics bill to be
sent to Capitol Hill next week.
   But this official also said that ``no final-decision memo'' has
yet reached Bush's desk for the president's consideration.
   Last week, Bush said he would make ``very specific proposals''
on pay increases for top federal officials, even though Congress
two months ago rejected a proposal that would have given lawmakers
a 50 percent pay raise.
   That proposal, advanced by the Commission on Legislative,
Executive and Judicial Salaries, would have included hikes for
federal judges and approximately 7,000 top executives.
   The Bush administration official said Wednesday that, among
other options still under consideration at the White House, was a
series of pay hikes for certain categories of federal officials
rather than an across-the-board raise.
   The Washington Post reported in its Wednesday editions that Bush
would propose a 25 per pay hike for the judges. Most federal judges
now make $89,500 per year, the same salary as members of Congress
and top federal officials.
   An administration source said that Bush had not yet settled on a
figure. But another official noted that a commission studying
federal jobs had recommended a 25 percent pay raise, and that that
figure was the one being focused on by the White House. The
commission, headed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker,
made its report public late last month.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, a former
federal judge himself, said Wednesday that it was ``premature to
speculate on what is not yet a recommendation.''
   Mitchell said ``no one had talked to him'' from the
administration about a pay raise for federal judges.
   As for separating Congress from the pay raises, Mitchell said,
``There appears to be a widespread feeling that de-linking salaries
would make it more difficult for members of Congress ever to get
increases in pay.''

<HEAD>Protesters Crash Rally Led By Former SS Soldier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 50 protesters shouting ``Nazis
Out'' crashed a rally led by a former Nazi SS soldier on Wednesday
night and were thrown out by participants.
   Witnesses said fistfights broke out between some demonstrators
and participants acting as security guards in the crowded community
center in the Bonn suburb of Bad Godesberg.
   About 1,200 members of the ultra-rightist Republican party and
their supporters gathered at the hall for the first national rally
held by the party.
   Outside, about 700 people protested in a driving rain.
Demonstrators threw eggs at helmeted riot police, and shoving
matches broke out between some protesters and Republican supporters.
   Several hundred police officers, some with attack dogs, manned
barricades in the area.
   Activists who say the Republican party harbors anti-Semitic and
neo-Nazi sentiments had vowed to disrupt the rally, and about 50
demonstrators sneaked in using phony invitations.
   When party leader Franz Schoenhuber began to deliver his speech,
the infiltrators began shouting ``Nazis Out.''
   Most of the protesters were thrown out, but some who were quiet
during the initial outbreak remained. Five of them leaped up and
blasted air horns when Schoenhuber began explaining his service as
a Nazi SS soldier during World War II.
   ``This is a neo-Fascist party and must be stopped,'' said Klaus
Drosten, one of those evicted from the hall. ``We find it
frightening that this party is becoming a rallying point for
nationalist zealots.''
   Schoenhuber, 66, told his supporters, ``I am not a Nazi, I am a
German patriot.''
   He also predicted that the Republicans would become a prominent
political party.
   ``Next year we will be thousands, and in three years we will be
hundreds of thousands. I promise you that in 1990 we Republicans
will be the third-strongest party in the federal republic,'' he
said.
   The party now has 13,000 members, 70 percent of them under 30
years old, Schoenhuber said.
   Left-wing organizations accuse the Republicans of being
neo-Fascist and hostile toward the millions of foreign workers and
immigrants living in West Germany.
   The party surprised many when it won 7.5 percent of the vote in
Berlin elections in January with a campaign that called for halting
the influx of foreigners seeking asylum. Some fear the foreigners
are taking jobs and housing from native West Germans.
   More than 200,000 immigrants of German descent arrived in West
Germany last year from the Soviet Union, Poland and other East
European nations. More than 50,000 other foreign workers won
political asylum.
   ``We are of the opinion that the country can no longer bear the
economic costs of allowing guest workers from Turkey to seek asylum
here,'' Schoenhuber said at the rally.
   He said his position was grounded in economics, not racism.
   He also disclosed he was earlier married to an American, and
that his 29-year-old daughter, Susanne Schoenhuber-Baer, lives and
works in Washington.
   Schoenhuber said he was never a member of the Nazi party and
dismissed his service as a SS soldier as the ``freely taken
decision of an 18-year-old attracted by uniforms and adventure.''

<HEAD>Opposition Plans Coalition To Take Over Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four political parties planned Wednesday to form a
coalition shadow government they hope will govern if a major
stock-profiteering scandal forces Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
to resign.
   Party leaders planned an opposition summit for Friday as
Takeshita suffered another blow _ news reports that the company at
the scandal's center contributed $381,700 to fund-raising parties
for him in May 1987.
   Despite public opinion polls showing his popularity as low as 9
percent, Takeshita refuses to resign. Instead, he vows to make
reforms and regain public trust.
   The proposed opposition coalition excludes the Japan Communist
Party, which has differences with most other parties. Prospective
coalition partners also differ over such issues as U.S.-Japan
security arrangements, the two Koreas and atomic power plants.
   Their leaders, however, propose setting those aside to work for
Takeshita's downfall.
   They plan to meet Friday in Kyoto, western Japan, to discuss
strategy against Takeshita's Liberal Democratic Party, which holds
297 of the 512 seats in the parliament's lower house, and 143 of
the 252 in the upper house.
   Takako Doi, chairman of the largest opposition Japan Socialist
Party, told reporters Tuesday, ``The only alternative left for the
government is to resign en masse and accept the people's judgment
(at elections).''
   Others in the proposed coalition are Komeito, or Clean
Government Party, the Democratic Socialist Party and the United
Social Democratic Party.
   Takeshita disclosed Friday that Recruit Co. spent $152,700 on a
fund-raising party for him in May 1987, when he was a leading
contender for prime minister.
   The nationwide newspaper Asahi Shimbun and others reported
Wednesday that Takeshita received another $229,000 from Recruit at
another fund-raising party that month.
   Takeshita refused to comment. ``I do not have detailed
information,'' he told reporters.
   But one of his aides, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed Recruit had bought tickets to the second party, though he
did not know how many.
   Recruit, an information services conglomerate, sold
bargain-priced unlisted shares in a subsidiary to about 150
influential politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen, who profited
handsomely when public trading began.
   So far, 14 bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested on
charges of bribery or violating securities laws in the deals. Three
Cabinet ministers linked to the scandal have resigned.
   Japanese politicians customarily use fund-raising parties to
sidestep legal restrictions on political donations. Large
corporations buy large blocks of party tickets, but Takeshita
acknowledged last week that Recruit's purchases were ``slightly
excessive.''
   Such parties are considered legal ``as long as the price of each
ticket is within the range of common sense and the number of
tickets purchased is within a reasonable limit of what a company
can possibly use,'' a Home Affairs official said on condition of
anonymity.
   ``With his ties with Recruit coming into light bit by bit,
Takeshita's already faltering leadership is deteriorating
rapidly,'' Asahi Shimbun said in a Wednesday editorial.
   At least 17 politicians, including former Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone, have been implicated in the scandal. None has
been arrested, but prosecutors still are questioning politicians
and their aides.

   One top-ranking government official was
arrested, one fled and another was missing after participating in a
weekend coup attempt against the government of President Hissene
Habre, diplomats said Wednesday.
   People trying to enter or leave the capital were stopped at
military roadblocks, according to sources who asked not to be
identified.
   Interior Minister Mahamat Itno was arrested after Saturday's
unsuccessful coup, while Army commander, Hassan Djamous fled
N'Djamena and the president's military adviser, Idriss Debi, was
missing, sources said.
   A Chadian nationalist group issued a statement in Brussels,
Belgium Wednesday, saying mass arrests were occurring in the
capital.
   Itno, Djamous and Debi reportedly staged the coup after Habre's
Anakaza tribe attempted to take key government administrative and
military posts. The officials hoped to maintain the Hadjarai and
Zakawa tribes in the government, sources said.
   In November 1987, Habre signed a peace pact in Baghdad, Iraq,
with former rebel leader Ibn Omar, who was appointed foreign
minister earlier this year.
   The pact led to the government's reconciliation with numerous
political opponents.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Wednesday he was encouraged by suggestions by Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir for settling the Arab-Israeli dispute and
hoped they would form a basis for advancing peace in the Middle
East.
   While U.S. and Israeli officials would not say what Baker and
Shamir had discussed, the prime minister said last week he would
propose holding elections among Palestinian Arabs under Isareli
control to select their leaders for talks with his government.
   Avi Pazner, the prime minister's media adviser, said Shamir and
Baker had decided ``not to say anything, not to reveal anything''
about Shamir's proposals. Pazner did say that a joint group of
Israeli and U.S. officials had beeb convened to discuss the
suggestions in advance of Shamir's meeting Thursday with President
Bush.
   Meanwhile, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, in an interview
with Cable News Network, said Shamir's proposal for elections
without the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
if carried through, ``will be a grave mistake, it will not solve
the problem.''
   Baker, after his two-hour meeting with Shamir, called their talk
``very productive, useful and very friendly.''
   For his part, Shamir said he had offered ``some ways to solve''
problems in the Mideast and remarked:
   ``I feel we have started a very serious discussion. Our
conversation was very friendly.''
   There were widespread expectations before Shamir's meeting with
Baker that the Bush administration would talk a tough stance toward
Israel. A senior U.S. official, briefing reporters at the White
House on Tuesday under rules of anonymity, prediced a ``candid''
discussion, the diplomatic way of predicting disagreements.
   But Pazner told reporters afterward, ``I didn't see any
hardening of position.''
   Shamir said last week he would propose elections among the 1.4
million Palestinian Arabs who live under Israeli control on the
West Bank and in Gaza, with the aim of picking leaders to negotiate
with Israel over the Palestinians' future.
   Israel has controlled the West Bank and Gaza since its lightning
victory over Egypt, Jordan and Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War. On
Monday, Bush called on Israel to end what he said was its
``occupation'' as part of an overall settlement with the Arabs.
   Since December 1987, when the Palestinians launched a concerted
campaign to challenge Israel, the territories have been shrouded by
violence in which 419 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have died.
   Shamir has ruled out negotiating with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which he holds responsible for that violence and for
an unceasing campaign of terrorism against Israel.
   He told a conference of Jewish-American organization leaders
that sitting with the PLO would ``bring disaster.''
   Instead, he has sought to revive the 1978 Camp David agreements'
promise of a transitional period of autonomy for the Palestinians
and then negotiations for an overall settlement.
   ``The prime minister has made some suggestions,'' Baker said.
``We are going to continue our discussion with the objective of
moving the peace process forward, if it's possible to do so. They
were very encouraging. Hopefully they will form the basis under
which we can move the peace process forward.''
   Shamir followed Mubarak to Washington. The Egyptian leader said
toward the end of his visit on Tuesday that he saw no way to stop
the violence in the territories.
   ``If anybody could stop it, we would be very pleased,'' Mubarak
said, asking, ``But how?''
   Baker suggested last month that Israel might have to talk to the
PLO, with which the United States opened its first talks in
December.
   Mubarak, in the CNN interview, said he would like Bush to
explain to Shamir that a Mideast peace conference would lead to
direct Arab-Israel peace talks.
   Such a conference would not have the power to dictate to either
the Israelis or the Arabs or veto their decisions, and ``Shamir
knows this,'' Mubarak said.
   ``Direct negotiations will be coming by hook or by crook through
this international conference,'' he said.
   Shamir is reluctant to enter a peace conference in which the
Soviet Union might play a prominent role. He is concerned the
Soviets would be inclined to favor the Arabs.

<HEAD>Bills Introduced to Restrict Ads on Children's TV Shows</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Legislation to stem the ``crass
commercialization'' of children's television was introduced in the
House and Senate on Wednesday to the applause of public groups
trying to reduce the amount of cereal, toy and candy advertising on
the programs.
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said he was co-sponsoring the
Senate measure on behalf of his six grandchildren and all the
nation's youngsters.
   He said broadcasters ``have failed to meet their obligations to
children'' and it was necessary, therefore, for Congress to
intervene since the Federal Communications Commission repealed ad
restrictions on children's television in 1984.
   ``The FCC's hands-off approach has created an environment where
broadcasters have focused not on children's developmental needs but
on crass commercialism ... cash, cash and more cash,'' Metzenbaum
said.
   The bill, sponsored by Metzenbaum and Sen. Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J., in the Senate, would limit ads on children's shows to 10{
minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays,
effective next year.
   It also would require the FCC to consider how well a broadcaster
has been committed to the educational and informational needs of
children in its overall programming.
   The House and Senate bills are virtually identical to
legislation passed by Congress last year but vetoed by
then-President Reagan.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said the bills were adopted in
cooperation with the three major television networks, the National
Association of Broadcasters and the Association of Independent
Television Stations.
   ``This legislation is needed to ensure that broadcasters treat
children as consumers of information and new ideas, not just
consumers of candy, cereal and toys,'' Markey said.
   Markey is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
telecommunications and finance subcommittee, which will hold
hearings on the bill Thursday.
   The bill was introduced in the House by Reps. John Bryant,
D-Texas; Matthew Rinaldo, R-N.J., and Terry Bruce, D-Ill., and had
14 co-sponsors.
   The legislation has wide support from psychiatric, health and
educational groups, and has been a 20-year aim of Peggy Charren of
Action for Children's Television in Boston.
   Charren, who introduced each lawmaker at the news conference,
said the bill would impose on broadcasters the ``three R's of
television: restriction, requirement and reporting.''
   She said it was a ``cost-effective way to provide information
and education to young audiences without raising taxes, without
raising the deficit.''

<HEAD>No Hospitals Will be Closed, Secretary Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veterans Affairs Department doesn't intend
to close any of its hospitals but may change some of their
assignments, the head of the newest Cabinet department said
Wednesday.
   All 172 veterans hospitals ``cannot be all-purpose entities,''
Secretary Edward Derwinski said in answering questions after a
luncheon speech at the National Press Club.
   ``Logically, there has to be a degree of specialization.''
   Veterans hospitals already have scores of agreements for using
military hospitals and vice versa, and Derwinski said he hopes to
expand those. He did not directly answer when asked what he thought
of merging the veterans and military hospital systems.
   ``We have, if anything, a shortage of facilities,'' Derwinski
said. He and other officials have said they expect that as the
nation's 27 million veterans age, many will retire to the Sunbelt,
putting pressure on veterans facilities in those states.
   ``We have no intention whatsoever of closing any veterans
medical facilities,'' Derwinski said. In addition to the hospitals,
the department operates 226 outpatient clinics and dozens of other
installations.
   Derwinski served 24 years in the House as a Republican from the
Chicago suburbs. He told his audience that he well recognized that
all members of Congress must try to protect the federal
installations in their districts, and ``We're going to cooperate
with them.''
   ``To demonstrate that this must not be a parochial issue, let me
cite the example of Chicago _ my own home base. There are four VA
medical centers in the Chicago area, three of them within 12 miles
of one another,'' he said in a passage in his prepared text that he
did not deliver.
   ``Our ability to provide quality care to veterans in the future,
with some degree of geographic equity, depends on a serious review
of the costs of duplication and other problems posed by overlapping
services,'' the text continued.
   On other subjects, Derwinski said:
   _He will appoint a ``totally balanced, objective group'' to try
to reach consensus and advise him within 90 days on what to do
about Agent Orange. The department's predecessor agency, the
Veterans Administration, maintained there was no evidence that
soldiers exposed to the herbicide in Vietnam suffered adverse
health effects; many veterans advocates say they did.
   _Reporters should ``investigate what we're doing. You help me
shake up the system and make it work better'' by reporting problems.
   _Veterans organizations ``are not really a powerful lobby,'' but
are among the rare lobbies that have no opposing lobbies: ``Nobody
in his right mind is against veterans.''

<TEXT>
   Australia's most wanted man, an
apparent fugitive from West Germany sought here for the theft of
$33 million in cash, was captured Wednesday after a two-week
manhunt that stretched across the Outback.
   John Friedrich was caught outside a gasoline station near Perth,
the capital of Western Australia state, after driving 1,850 miles
across the continent in a used station wagon purchased for $11,750
in cash.
   Police said Friedrich, who had shaved off his distinctive beard,
offered no resistance. There was no word about the missing millions.
   Friedrich became the target of a nationwide hunt after he
vanished from Melbourne on March 21, leaving the country's largest
civilian search and rescue company $180 million in debt and near
collapse.
   He became chief executive of the non-profit National Safety
Council of Australia in 1986 and transformed it from a one-aircraft
operation into a fleet reaching into the South Pacific.
   Employees described Friedrich as ``charismatic and a real
charmer,'' and newspapers said he duped financial institutions here
and abroad into lending him millions of dollars based on false
invoices for equipment that was supposed to serve as collateral.
   The case caused a sensation in Australia, with news media
alleging Friedrich had links the CIA or other foreign intelligence
organizations; flew espionage flights across the Outback and
dabbled in arms and drugs trafficking.
   Authorities caught up with him after a tip-off that his vehicle
was abandoned north of Perth on Monday.
   Police said they were not sure that Friedrich was even his real
name or whether he was an Australian citizen or an illegal
immigrant.
   A West German newspaper said Friedrich appeared to be a
Friedrich Hohenberger, who apparently faked his own death in 1974
after defrauding a West German construction firm of $200,000.
   Friedrich's wife Shirley had pleaded tearfully on national
television for her husband to ``come home to the children and clear
up this mess.''
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke called media claims of intelligence
involvement ``fanciful.'' Defense Minister Kim Beazley rejected
suggestions Friedrich used his operation to infiltrate sensitive,
intelligence-gathering bases jointly operated with the United
States, as well as Australian military installations.
   The National Safety Council of Australia, based in Victoria
state, had a fleet of about 32 aircraft and employed a staff of 450.
   Last year Friedrich was awarded the nation's highest honor, the
Order of Australia.

<HEAD>Congressman Says Collider Devoid of Support In Scientific Community</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The super collider is ``virtually devoid of
support'' in the scientific community, a Pennsylvania Republican
told Congress Wednesday during a hearing to review the selection
process that awarded the $4.6 billion particle accelerator to Texas.
   ``The real question is not how, it is now where, not when, it is
if'' it will be built, Rep. Don Ritter said after the House
committee hearing. ``The real issue is, are we going to commit $10
billion.''
   Ritter said he has found a ``decided lack of interest'' within
the engineering and scientific community and even ``hostility''
toward the proposed spending of what he estimates as $10 billion
over the next decade on the high-energy physics project.
   The Energy Department estimates construction costs at $4.6
billion.
   Ritter said scientists outside the high-energy physics community
were never involved in Congress' decision to pursue construction of
the collider, which backers hope will help science better
understand the fundamental nature of matter.
   ``This program is virtually devoid of support from the
scientific and engineering community,'' Ritter told the House
Science, Space and Technology Committee.
   Rep. Ralph Hall, a Texas Democrat and member of the committee,
said he agrees there is some opposition to the project in the
scientific community, as well as support.
   `It's hard for me to believe there's quote `no' support at any
level of science,'' Hall said. ``I think there is some support for
it, but it's correct to say there's some opposition.''
   The subcommittee on energy research and development was
scheduled to decide Thursday whether to authorize construction of
the project, but officials say the real battle in Congress will be
over the level of financing and what is essential to begin actually
building the 53-mile underground tunnel on farmland south of Dallas.

   Three Haitian officers who led a failed coup
attempt against their nation's military government arrived here
Wednesday and asked for political asylum, the local immigration
director said.
   The men, along with their families, flew in from the Dominican
Republic, said Perry Rivkind, district director of the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   ``At this point I'm holding them for a while,'' Rivkind said.
``I'm not going to make a final determination until I talk to the
Department of State.''
   He said a decision on whether to free the officers during asylum
proceedings could come as early as Thursday, however.
   The weekend coup attempt against the government of Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril was led by Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu, 38, head of the
crack Leopard Battalion, Col. Philippe Biamby, 36, of the palace
guard, and Col. Leonce Qualo, 35, head of the Interior Ministry's
intelligence department.
   Avril ordered the three expelled from Haiti on Tuesday.
   Rivkind said the officers arrived from the Dominican Republic
with valid Haitian passports and U.S. tourist visas allowing them
to stay in the country for six months.
   But by asking for asylum, they forfeited the tourist visas and
could legally be detained. Rivkind said he was intially inclined to
parole them, but after determining their high rank, decided to
consult with the State Department first.
   Meanwhile, the situation in Haiti was tense Wednesday after more
officers took to the the radio demanding Avril's ouster, and the
government declared a state of emergency and a news blackout.

<TEXT>
   Wet weather spread over much of the East on Wednesday, while
high wind blew across the central Rockies and southern California
had another unusually hot day with temperatures of 100 and more.
   Showers were scattered ahead of a cold front that stretched from
southern New England across the middle Atlantic Coast states to the
Florida Panhandle.
   Strong thunderstorms developed in warm, moist, unstable air over
the central Florida Peninsula.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
0.73 of an inch at Panama City, Fla.
   Very cold, unstable air over the Great Lakes contributed to the
development of showers across that region. Hail the size of peas
fell west of Springfield, Ill.
   High wind blew over the central Rockies. In western Wyoming,
wind gusted to near 70 mph at Crowheart.
   The wind created blowing-snow conditions across sections of the
Colorado Rockies, where as much as 6 feet of snow had fallen by
Wednesday from a storm that stalled for a week. Some ski resorts
considered extending their seasons.
   Light rain fell over the northern Rockies and along the coast of
Washington state.
   Also in the Northwest, warming weather was blamed for an
avalanche that covered all four lanes of U.S. 2 at Stevens Pass in
Washington's Cascade Mountains early Wednesday. There were no
injuries and one lane was reopened by midday.
   Sections of southern California and the desert Southwest had
readings in the 90s and above. By midday, downtown Los Angeles had
reached 96 degrees and Santa Ana sizzled at 100 degrees.
   On Tuesday, Los Angeles hit a record 100 degrees and Los Angeles
County lifeguards telephoned reserves for extra help, adding dozens
of lifeguards to monitor an estimated 100,000 beachgoers.
   The unseasonably warm weather was a result of an upper level
high pressure system off the southern California coast. But the
Santa Ana winds that began Sunday and ushered in the April
temperatures began diminishing Wednesday, allowing smog to invade
the region.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 33
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 104 at Ontario, Calif. Wednesday's
low in the Lower 48 states was 14 degrees at Alamosa, Colo.
   For Thursday, showers and some thunderstorms were forecast from
eastern sections of the middle Atlantic Coast states to New
England. Scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast over the
northern Plains and southern sections of the upper Mississippi
Valley. Rain also was forecast from coastal Washington state to
western Montana.
   Highs in the 30s were predicted from northeastern Minnesota to
Upper Michigan; in the 40s and 50s from the coast of Washington
state across the northern Rockies, the northern Plains and
Nebraska, much of the upper and middle Mississippi Valley, the
Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley and all of the Appalachians to New
England; in the 80s over the southern Florida Peninsula, and from
south-central and southwestern Texas across southern New Mexico and
western Nevada to the central Pacific Coast; in the 90s across
southern Arizona and southern California; above 100 across the
desert Southwest; and generally in the 60s and 70s over the
remainder of the nation.

   The former three-term mayor ousted the
incumbent three-term mayor in an mayoral election that observers
said Wednesday was dominated by image rather than substance.
   Paul Soglin, a former anti-war demonstrator who was mayor from
1973 to 1979, garnered almost 57 percent of Tuesday's vote in
defeating three-term incumbent Joseph Sensenbrenner.
   ``Joe carried a lot of image baggage of `Joe the bumbler,'''
City Council President Ron Trachtenberg, a Sensenbrenner supporter,
said Wednesday. ``In trying to form consensus quietly he was seen
as a wimp, which he shouldn't be seen as.''
   Soglin also brings political baggage to the mayor's office, said
local politician Rick Berg. ``It remains to be seen whether this is
the same old Paul Soglin or a new Paul Soglin,'' he said.
   Soglin, whose legacy as an anti-war protester in the 1960s
helped put him in the mayor's office during his previous three
terms, recaptured his old job by running as a fiscal conservative,
although he still describes himself as a political liberal.
   ``I think I got greater support among conservatives because they
felt I could handle budget issues better ... better than before and
better than Sensenbrenner,'' Soglin said.
   With all 66 wards counted in the college city of 175,000
residents, Soglin had won with 34,537 votes to 26,280 votes for
Sensenbrenner.
   Meanwhile, state elections officials said a recount was probable
after close results on a constitutional amendment regarding
property tax relief.
   The unofficial result was 404,758 against the referendum and
404,403 in favor of it.
   The amendment would change the state constitution to allow
selective property tax relief. Its complicated, long-winded wording
made the measure especially difficult for voters to understand.

<TEXT>
   A strike called by Sinhalese
extremists to commemorate a rebellion 18 years ago brought activity
to a halt nationwide Wednesday, and three people were killed, the
military said.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said the government planned to
offer a cease-fire to the extremists, who belong to the Marxist
People's Liberaton Front. He said the offer probably would be made
next Wednesday.
   Bombs exploded in Colombo and other towns, and an army officer
was killed when he tried to defuse a bomb in the town of
Ambalantota, 90 miles south of Colombo, said the military
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   They said the extremists shot two people in the central district
of Kandy but did not give further details.
   Three police officers were injured in a blast in the town of
Panadura, 10 miles south of the capital. Explosions also were
reported in a Colombo suburb.
   The leftist Sinhalese militants have been waging their latest
anti-government rebellion since 1987.
   They called the strike to commemorate the April 5, 1971,
uprising against the government. As many as 20,000 people were
believed to have died before the rebellion was crushed.
   The government then outlawed the People's Liberation Front, but
it regrouped in 1986.
   Wednesday's strike call was a virtual rejection of earlier peace
proposals by President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who has offered the
Sinhalese militants unconditional amnesty, seats in parliament and
money for their weapons if they end the fighting.
   Residents in southern Sri Lanka, the Sinhalese heartland, said
the strike had crippled daily life.
   ``There is heavy patrolling by troops and police but everything
is at a standstill,'' said a trader in Galle, 70 miles south of
Colombo. ``Shops, banks, offices and businesses never opened and
even the small tea kiosks put up shutters.''
   The trader, contacted by telephone, spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Most of the shops, businesses, and government offices in Colombo
were closed and heavily armed troops and police patrolled the
streets.
   An Associated Press photographer and two other cameramen were
detained by police when they tried to take pictures of soldiers
breaking into closed shops in the town of Kalutara, 25 miles south
of Colombo. They were released after two hours in custody.
   The militants began their current campaign against the
government to thwart a peace accord aimed at ending fighting by
Tamil rebels. The Sinhalese say the accord would give too many
concessions to the minority community.
   The predominantly Hindu Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people, but they are a majority in the Northern
Province. Sinhalese Buddhists make up 75 percent of the population
and control the government and the military.
   Tamil militants want an independent homeland in the island's
north and east. They began fighting in 1983, claiming the Sinhalese
have discriminated against them in jobs and education.
   Premadasa also has offered his peace proposals to the Tamil
rebels but they have not yet responded.
   More than 12,500 people in the island nation in the Indian Ocean
have been killed in the Tamil insurrection and the Sinhalese
backlash.

   Here are excerpts of remarks by Lech
Walesa, founder of Solidarity, and Interior Minister Czeslaw
Kiszczak at the conclusion Wednesday of negotiation between the
government and opposition, as translated by The Associated Press:
   WALESA: There is no freedom without Solidarity. This is truth
with which we came to the round table.
   In the speech that I delivered at the opening of the talks, I
said that our country was ruined and it was hard for working people
to live. I said it was not dwarfs who were to blame for it, but the
system which we did not choose for ourselves.
   At the round table we met with people of this system and we
became convinced that they are aware of that fact. By starting
talks with us, by allowing our uncensored remarks on television,
they gave proof of readiness for a radical change of the system.
   Nine weeks of talks about the most important problems of our
fatherland made us realize that, in the situation where we are now,
there cannot be any talk about trading between sides, but only
about the great concern that everybody who feels responsible for
Poland carries.
   As a nation, we are either able to build by peaceful means a
Poland independent, sovereign, safe through equal alliances, or we
will drown in the chaos of demagogy and, as a result, of a civil
war in which there will be no winners.
   This way, together, we discuss the repair of the Peoples'
Republic. But I also have to say that for those I am addressing
now, and on whose behalf I am speaking, freedom goes together with
bread.
   We are changing political structures in order to have my Gdansk
shipyard, and thousands of factories, steel works and mines with
it, live a life for the good of the country, that the worker, or
farmer, member of the intelligentsia or a pensioner can live in
dignity and without poverty, which humiliates through fear.
   We want a normal life and reforms have to serve this purpose.
   KISZCZAK: We came a long distance to the round table; we covered
a difficult road. Thus one should value the agreement achieved.
   A truly common work has been accomplished. Common is the
achievement and satisfaction resulting from it. It would be bad if
speculations appeared about who has won, and how much, and who has
lost and how much.
   There is only one winner: the nation, our fatherland. Even at
the most difficult moments of the debates, we were accompanied by
the hopes of Polish society.
   A part of the divergencies remained, but there is nothing
strange in that. Differences exist and they will appear in the
future; such is the nature of society.
   However, the feeling of joint responsibility for the course of
events should lead to moderating them. The essence is to create
effective instruments to overcome discrepancies, not keeping them
secret or remaining silent about them.
   The round table was the first extremely significant step toward
this. This is why the dialogue ... can turn out to be a priceless
element in the accomplishments of our work.

<TEXT>
   A suburban Virginia congressman, citing the
drug-related crime in the District of Columbia and the homicides
associated with it, introduced legislation Wednesday to give the
federal government control of the city's public safety system.
   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., said Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. and
other city officials have not found creative and effective ways of
dealing with the city's crime problem.
   ``What we are experiencing here is as much a crisis of
leadership and resources as it is a crisis of death and social
destruction,'' Parris said at a news conference. ``I think this is
the only approach to a situation that has literally resulted in a
criminal justice breakdown.''
   Parris' bill would authorize President Bush to appoint a
National Capital Public Safety Administrator, who would have
authority over the city's police and fire departments, its
emergency ambulance service, and its prison and court systems.
   The legislation comes amid a wave of crime and violence that has
thrust Washington's drug problem into the international limelight.
   Through Wednesday, 130 people had been killed in the city,
compared with 86 at the same time last year. In 1988, a record 372
persons were killed, and police blame drugs _ particularly crack
cocaine _ for more than 60 percent of those killings.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. said during a Senate
committee hearing on the District of Columbia that he is very
pleased with the city police department's efforts to close a crack
house located near the Catholic school where the senator's son
teaches.
   ``They are doing everything they possibly can to close down the
crack house,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Domenici. ``It's
to say that Sen. Domenici is very pleased with the police reaction,
and we're confident the matter will be resolved.''
   While the Parris bill does not call for more federal money for
the city's anti-drug efforts, it requests more federal personnel be
brought into the city's drug war.
   The bill directs Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to authorize
federal marshals in Maryland and Virginia to work on city anti-drug
efforts, and requests federal officials to appoint more judges to
the D.C. Superior Court in order to handle the flow of drug cases.
   The only authorization of federal money in the bill would be for
additional jail space, but only if the prison is constructed within
the city.

<HEAD>U.N. Agency Says 15 Countries Need Special Food Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization says 15
developing countries require ``exceptional or emergency
assistance'' to make up for serious food shortages.
   In a confidential report obtained by The Associated Press
Wednesday, the Rome-based agency listed the countries as Angola,
Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Haiti, Jamaica, Laos, Lebanon, Mozambique,
Nicaragua, Peru, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan and
Vietnam.
   It said these nations suffered an ``exceptional shortfall'' in
food supplies due to crop failures, natural disasters, interruption
of imports, disruption of distribution, or other factors.
   The report also listed 11 countries with unfavorable crop
prospects this year: Algeria, Angola, Argentina, Lesotho, Morocco,
Mozambique, Nicaragua, Peru, Sri Lanka, Tunisia and Zimbabwe.
   FAO Director-General Edouard Saouma said poor countries will be
hard hit this year by an overall increase of more than $5 billion
in the purchase price of food imports. The figure is projected to
reach $17.6 billion, up from $12.3 billion last year.
   ``The increases ... will further worsen the balance of payments
position of many of the low-income food deficit countries,'' Saouma
said in a speech Monday to the FAO's Committee on World Food
Security, which is meeting this week in Rome.
   He said many developing countries will also be hurt by a
significant decrease in food aid shipments, partly due to
inadequate contributions to the International Emergency Food
Reserve. Shipments this year are estimated at 9.7 million tons,
about one-fourth less than last year, he said.
   Saouma said world production of staple foods fell below
consumption in 1988 for the second straight year, mainly due to
drought in the United States and Canada.
   As a result, world grain stocks have dropped to 16 percent of
annual consumption requirements, the lowest ratio since the world
food crisis of the early 1970s.
   FAO had estimated that grain output in 1989 would need to
increase by 200 million tons, or 12 percent, to rebuild stocks to
the minimum level required for world food security. But Saouma
said, ``It now seems certain this outcome will not be achieved,
even if weather is favorable for the remainder of the season.''
   He said any adverse crop conditions in major producing regions
would have ``disastrously adverse effects.''

   It was the kind of love _ or obsessive
attraction to a woman _ that brooked no interference, not even from
police.
   Authorities said Michael Bailey escaped five times over three
days, finding time during his flight to make threatening phone
calls to the woman in question.
   By Wednesday the initial complaint of telephone harassment had
ballooned to felony charges of assault on a police officer and
escape, and the 26-year-old was still on the lam.
   Bailey's ramble began about 6:45 p.m. Saturday.
   A female employee told security officers at University Medical
Center that Bailey had made at least 10 phone calls threatening her
and her automobile, said Buddy Shavers, a medical center police
investigator.
   ``Her story is he is obsessed with her,'' Shavers said. ``The
man has been pursuing her for about a year, and she says she gave
him no encouragement.''
   Security officers increased patrols around the woman's car, but
between patrols the windshield and back window were broken.
   Bailey finally was spotted behind the back door of a nearby
restaurant. He struggled with medical center officer Charles
Tillman, police said.
   ``He threw a cup of water on the officer and struck him in the
chest area and then ran,'' Shavers said.
   Jackson police were called in and officers went to Bailey's
home, Shavers said.
   ``He came out and ran,'' police spokesman Sgt. Chip Pippen said.
   Bailey was spotted about 4 a.m. Sunday and fired a shotgun at
Sgt. Freddie Weeks, Pippen said.
   Bailey fled, was spotted, fled again.
   A SWAT team was brought in; Bailey was detained.
   During the chase, he continued to call the medical center.
   Monday morning, Bailey again fled _ this time from the basement
of the Jackson Police Department while being returned to the city
jail from a hearing at which he pleaded innocent to charges of
malicious mischief and making harassing phone calls. His handcuffs
had been removed for the court appearance.
   ``I never seen anybody run that fast,'' said Constable John
Brown, who was escorting Bailey.

<HEAD>Libya Says Reports of Reprisal Attacks Are `Lies'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libya's news agency JANA on Wednesday described as
``lies'' reports that Libya plans reprisal attacks on U.S. targets
timed to the April 15 anniversary of the U.S. bombing of Libya in
1986.
   It said in a dispatch monitored in London that the allegations
were made by the ``radio of the Zionist enemy'' _ a term it uses
for Israel _ and the CBS network in the United States.
   ``The Libyan people ... is well aware of the significance and
goal of such lies and allegations,'' JANA said.
   ``We are used to hearing such lies every time the American and
Western intelligence services as well as the Zionist Mossad start
to draw up a new plot aimed at carrying out a hostile attack ... to
divert the world's attention from their despicable intentions.
   ``We in the great Jamahiriyah (Libya) ... denounce terrorism in
every shape and form, from state-organized terrorism ... to the
hijacking of planes and the unjustified kidnapping and killing of
innocent people.''
   On April 15, 1986, U.S. warplanes bombed Tripoli and Benghazi in
what the Reagan administration described as a reprisal for Libya's
involvement in terrorist actions against Americans.
   The State Department said Tuesday that U.S. security personnel
worldwide were told to be on alert for anti-American terrorism
timed to the bombing anniversary but that it was not aware of any
specific threats.
   CBS, citing intelligence, said Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Gadhafi asked three groups to plan the reprisals.

   Only a third as many consumers are complaining
about the major airlines as a year ago, the Transportation
Department said Wednesday.
   The department, in its monthly air travel consumer report,
listed 970 complaints during March, compared to 2,651 for the same
month a year ago. The total complaints received for the first three
months of the year declined from 8,633 in 1988 to 3,207 this year,
the report said.
   The department, which keeps data on more than 20,000 flights,
gave no explanation for the decrease.
   In the same report, the 13 major carriers reported that 72.4
percent of their flights were on time during February, compared to
76.7 percent in January and 74.7 percent in February 1988.
   Worse winter weather conditions during the month accounted for
most of the increase, the department said. Delays caused by
mechanical problems are not counted.
   Mishandled baggage reports for February declined from 8.75 per
1,000 passengers a year ago to 7.36 this year. The January figure
was 7.86.

<TEXT>
   A settlement was reached during the trial of
a product liability lawsuit brought against G.D. Searle &amp; Co. by a
woman who claimed the company's CU-7 intrauterine contraceptive
device left her infertile.
   Terms of the settlement, reached Tuesday during the
two-month-long U.S. District Court trial, were not disclosed. Judge
Mariana Pfaelzer sealed the agreement with a confidentiality order,
Searle spokeswoman Kay Bruno said Wednesday in Chicago.
   Laura F. McCarthy, a former Los Angeles resident who lives in
Butte, Mont., was among about 800 women who have sued the
pharmaceutical firm over its CU-7 copper IUD. She claimed it made
her infertile.
   About 330 of the cases have been disposed in favor of Searle,
and some 420 cases are still active, Bruno said. The settlement in
McCarthy's case was reached before closing arguments were made to
the jury.
   Roger Brosnahan, McCarthy's attorney, said the confidentiality
order was made at Searle's request.
   ``As far as the case is concerned, we destroyed their foundation
of defense for this product. ... I think it's a clear turning point
in the litigation,'' said Brosnahan, whose firm is handling 150 to
200 lawsuits against Searle over the CU-7 device.
   He declined to directly characterize McCarthy's reaction to the
settlement.
   McCarthy's lawsuit first came to trial under senior U.S.
District Judge Irving Hill in January. But Hill declared a
mistrial, saying rough tactics and delaying measures by attorneys
on both sides were threatening his health.
   Although most of the cases thus far have favored Searle, the
company was ordered last year to pay a Minnesota woman $8.75
million in damages.
   Brosnahan said the next CU-7 case for his firm was scheduled for
May 15 in St. Paul, Minn.
   ``We're going to keep pounding on their doors and bringing them
before juries until everybody recognizes how bad this product is,
and how bad Searle's conduct was,'' he said.
   Searle said it stopped selling the CU-7 in the United States in
January 1986 because it could not get insurance due to the many
lawsuits. Approval of the device from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration remains in effect.

   Opponents of the partial merger of The Detroit
News and Detroit Free Press on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to
consider blocking the business combination.
   The advocacy groups Public Citizen and Michigan Citizens for an
Independent Press in their petition said the case raises legal
issues important to the survival of newspaper competition and
constitutional issues touching on relations between the executive
and judicial branches, and so merited review by the highest court.
The opponents had made their petition public last week.
   The court was unlikely to act on the petition before the middle
of May.
   The News, owned by Gannett Co. Inc., and the Free Press, owned
by Knight-Ridder Inc., applied for an antitrust exemption in 1986
under the Newspaper Preservation Act.
   The agreement would allow the newspapers to combine business,
production and circulation operations while retaining separate news
and editorial departments, with the owners splitting profits or
losses equally the last 95 years of the century-long joint
operating agreement.

<TEXT>
   The Liberal Party, which traditionally endorses
Democrats for New York state and city offices, is reportedly
backing Republican Rudolph Giuliani for mayor.
   Giuliani, the former U.S. attorney in Manhattan, needs the
Liberal endorsement if he is to run a successful campaign in a city
where Democrats outnumber Republicans about 5-to-1.
   Giuliani has not yet announced whether he will run, but is
generally expected to do so.
   City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, who had also sought the
Liberal nod in his quest to succeed Mayor Edward I. Koch, said
Tuesday that Liberal Party Vice Chairman Ray Harding had told him
of the party's planned endorsement of Giuliani.
   Harding and Russ Schriefer, Giuliani's campaign manager,
declined to confirm Goldin's information. Harding said the party
would announce its choice for mayor at a future date after a
meeting of its policy committee.
   Koch, a Democrat, has unofficially said he is seeking a fourth
term. The Liberal Party has never endorsed Koch in his previous
three runs for mayor.
   The last Republican to get the Liberal nod for mayor was John V.
Lindsay, who won reelection in 1969 on the Liberal Party line after
he lost the Republican primary.
   By endorsing Giuliani, the Liberal Party risks incurring the ire
of Gov. Mario Cuomo, who could get the small party knocked off the
ballot. A political party must receive 50,000 votes in a
gubernatorial election to guarantee a permanent slot on the ballot
for the next four years.
   If Cuomo, a Democrat, runs for a third term as governor and
decides he does not want to belong to a club that would endorse a
Republican, he could reject the Liberal endorsement.
   However, in response to Giuliani's reported endorsement, Cuomo's
spokesman Gary Fryer said: ``The governor is content to let the
people of New York City decide who the mayor should be.''

   Republican Gov. Guy Hunt denied on
Wednesday that a landslide loss by a GOP candidate for a vacant
Alabama congressional seat is a bad omen for Republicans seeking
gains in the South in 1990.
   But Alabama Democrats said the victory of Secretary of State
Glen Browder in the 3rd Congressional District race amounts to a
revival for state Democrats.
   ``The news of the death of the Democratic Party was premature in
Alabama,'' said U.S. Rep. Ronnie Flippo, a Democrat from Florence,
at a news conference in Washington.
   ``It shows the Republicans aren't taking over Alabama,'' said
U.S. Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., who joined Flippo at the news
conference.
   Browder, 46, a former political science professor at
Jacksonville State University, defeated Republican John Rice, 37, a
state senator from Opelika, by nearly a 2-1 margin.
   Complete, unofficial returns from Tuesday's election showed
Browder with 47,229 votes, or 65 percent, to Rice's 25,008, or 35
percent. Browder won all 13 counties, including Rice's home county
of Lee and hometown of Opelika.
   Just last November, President Bush got 60 percent of the vote in
the east Alabama district, carrying 11 of the 13 counties.
   The seat became vacant with the death in December of Rep. Bill
Nichols, a Democrat who held the district for 22 years. Without an
incumbent in the seat, which covers a rural and mostly white
conservative district, national Republican strategists looked for a
possible off-year gain to set the stage for a raid on Dixie in 1990.
   Browder, with more money and backing from organized labor,
battered Rice in television ads depicting the Republican a ``hand
grenade'' who favored cutting federal aid to the elderly in half.
Rice attempted to brand Browder as a tax-and-spend liberal out of
tune with the district.
   Rice, who called Browder ``a wimp'' and ``a liar'' during the
campaign, blamed the loss on a lack of money to counter the
television assault. Browder played down the campaign name-calling
after his victory, saying his goal is to ``bring people together''
to work for the district.
   Hunt, who campaigned for Rice, said each candidate is viewed
individually by voters and the loss Tuesday does not dim Republican
chances to make major gains in Alabama and elsewhere in 1990.
   Hunt, who in 1986 became the first Republican elected governor
of Alabama this century, also said he feels he remains popular in
the east Alabama district.
   Hunt also gained the advantage of being able to name a
Republican to succeed Browder as secretary of state. He said
Wednesday he has just begun to consider the matter.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa sealed a
historic deal with the government Wednesday to restore the
independent trade union after a seven-year ban and give Poland its
first democratic elections since World War II.
   Walesa, representing the opposition, and Gen. Czeszlaw Kiszczak,
the interior minister representing Poland's communist government,
approved the package that emerged from two months of negotiations
on political and economic reforms, as the 57 participants in the
talks gathered for a final time at the ``round table'' in the
Council of Ministers Palace.
   ``There is no freedom without Solidarity,'' Walesa said at the
beginning of a 10-minute address to the table in which he explained
why the opposition had approved the agreements.
   He credited authorities with having shown ``readiness for a
radical change of the system.''
   But he said that behind the ``nice words'' of communist
authorities for the past 45 years there was ``dishonesty and
violence,'' and Solidarity had aimed for ``substantial settlements
that could be implemented right away.''
   He declared the opposition had achieved the ``necessary
minimum'' by regaining the legal status lost after martial law was
imposed in December 1981.
   ``I think that the round-table talks can become the beginning of
the road to democracy and a free Poland, and hence we look with
boldness and hope into the future,'' he said.
   Kiszczak lauded the talks that brought together different sides
of Poland's political spectrum.
   In Washington, the White House called the accord ``a great day
for the Polish people and for freedom.'' Press Secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said President Bush was ``very pleased by the accords
that have started Poland on this new path toward reconcilation.''
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who banned Solidarity in
1981, argued strongly for its restoration at a Communist Party
plenum in January, saying it would be the culmination of his policy
of national reconciliation.
   The government, acknowledging it needed greater public support
to take the painful steps of reviving the economy, offered the
talks to Solidarity last year to help end a series of strikes.
   Jaruzelski did not participate directly in the talks or attend
the ceremony, but he has said he would not rule out a meeting with
Walesa.
   ``This comprehensive documentation is a social contract,''
Kiszczak said. ``We declare the will to fulfill honestly the
agreement that we symbolically conclude today.''
   He called the debates a ``first, extremely significant step.''
   ``Dialogue ... can turn out to be a priceless element in the
accomplishment of our work,'' he said.
   The meeting was preceded by separate signings of the three main
agreements _ on economic, political and trade union reforms _ by
the opposition and government heads of the working groups that
negotiated them.
   At the end of the formal meeting, a communique was issued in the
names of Walesa and Kiszczak that said, ``The participants of the
round table consider the mission of the round table finished.''
   It said participants agreed to the negotiating teams' decisions
and would cooperate to put them into practice. An Arbitration
Commission will be named to oversee the implementation and settle
any conflicts, the statement said.
   The government agreed to restore legal status to Solidarity, the
farmers' union Rural Solidarity and the Independent Students
Association. All had been banned in the martial-law crackdown.
   In exchange, the Solidarity-led opposition agreed to participate
in June elections to the 460-seat Sejm, or parliament, that
guarantee the Communist Party and its allies a 65 percent majority.
   But a new 100-member senate to be created would be the first
fully democratically chosen legislative chamber in the East bloc.
Anyone who collected 3,000 signatures could get on the ballot, and
all the seats would be openly contested.
   A presidency would also be created, to be elected by the Sejm
and the senate.
   The president would be elected this year for a six-year term by
the Sejm and the senate. The post is expected to go to Jaruzelski.
   A Sejm spokesman confirmed the parliament will meet Friday to
enact the agreements into law.
   After the speeches by Walesa and Kiszczak, a 15-minute break was
called in the meeting. But the break stretched to nearly three
hours in what a TV source said was an apparent dispute over whether
Alfred Miodowicz, the OPZZ official union chief, could speak out of
turn.
   State TV filled the time with chamber music videotapes until the
round table reconvened and a senior Solidarity negotiator announced
that Miodowicz could speak because the talks were too important to
be delayed by procedure.
   ``Those who claim a mandate for representing society ... are
surprised sometimes that we have a different opinion,'' said
Miodowicz.
   Solidarity has accused Miodowicz of threatening to break up the
talks with newly militant stands taken as OPZZ is faced with losing
its trade union monopoly and probably a large share of its
membership.
   As early as Wednesday morning it was not clear if Solidarity
intended to sign the accords, especially after a dispute with the
OPZZ over the formula adopted for compensating workers for
inflation as part of the economic agreement.
   The OPZZ claims the formula to index pay to inflation does not
do enough to protect workers from price rises.
   But Walesa told the National Executive Commission of Solidarity
the union had achieved its main goal _ legalization _ and it could
better fight for further reforms after it is registered and
organized.
   The commission then authorized Walesa to sign the agreements.
   Monday will see the beginning of Poland's first open,
competitive election campaign since communists consolidated power
after World War II.

   The Philadelphia Zoo will get a new occupant
April 29, and zoo visitors will vote on whether the creature is a
beauty or a beast.
   Big Pig, an African warthog, will appear through Labor Day.
During his stay visitors can fill out ballots to help decide
whether Big Pig is cute-ugly or just plain ugly.
   Zoo spokeswoman Arlene Kut said the zoo's Warthog Election
Central will tabulate votes, and a telephone line has been set up
to dispense the latest warthog news.
   Warthogs are a rarity in the United States; they were banned
because of quarantine restrictions until recently. Big Pig was born
at the Moscow Zoo in 1986 and was kept at the Los Angeles Zoo
before his trip to Philadelphia, Ms. Kut said. The Cincinnati and
Los Angeles Zoos also have warthogs.
   Big Pig weighs about 250 pounds, somewhat larger than average,
and is fed food pellets, carrots, apples, and grapes. He is also
fond of alfalfa. In the wild, warthogs eat short grasses, bark,
roots, and occasionally fruit, Ms. Kut said.
   Warthogs, members of the pig family, are native to sub-Saharan
Africa and inhabit savannah woodlands and grasslands. Although they
would rather run than fight, they do use their large upper tusks to
defend themselves against predators and can be dangerous when
cornered.
   Warthogs use their sense of smell to identify one another since
their eyesight is poor. Their hearing is acute. Their ``warts'' are
large bumps of skin that are prominent in males. These bumps may be
used to help deflect blows inflicted by the tusks of other male
warthogs during territorial battles.

   President Bush, who campaigned on a promise to
be ``the education president,'' on Wednesday sent Congress a $441
million education package designed to reward and promote school
improvements.
   ``We're going to take action _ action to make excellence in
education not just a rallying cry, but a classroom reality,'' Bush
said at a Rose Garden ceremony outside the White House.
   His ``Excellence in Education Act,'' based in part on campaign
pledges, would reward outstanding schools, teachers and science
scholars, encourage districts to create magnet schools with special
curriculums, push states to develop new ways to certify teachers,
help drug-ridden urban schools and bolster the endowments of
historically black colleges.
   ``These education initiatives don't constitute a cure-all, a
quick fix,'' Bush said. He added later that ``I don't have to tell
you about the current federal budget situation. Money is tight and
we wish that more funds were available to spend on all levels of
education.''
   Administration officials said Wednesday that the money they are
seeking for the initiatives would be in addition to the $21.9
billion in spending authority already proposed for the Education
Department.
   Previously there had been some question as to whether cuts would
be sought to offset the Bush proposals.
   But Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said at a briefing that
funds for the initiatives ``do not come from other programs in the
Department of Education.'' He said, ``I don't know where the money
will come from but that's another issue. These are new dollars.''
   Some educators and politicians expressed concern that even at
$22.3 billion for fiscal 1990, the departmental increase from 1989
will not match inflation and districts will have to cut back on
basic programs for students who are disadvantaged, handicapped, or
limited in their English proficiency.
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education
and Labor Committe, contended the Bush package ``has no future on
Capitol Hill, since the president is attempting to strip programs
long supported by Congress to pay for new initiatives of
questionable value.'' But other members of Congress said chances of
passage were much better.
   Cavazos said his department needs to encourage constructive
local activity, which he said the Bush plan is designed to do. ``I
see these proposals as part of a state reform movement overall,''
he said.
   The proposals were praised by Democrats as well as Republicans
who attended the announcement.
   Democratic Maryland Gov. Donald Schaefer said Bush is
highlighting some of the most important education issues _
drug-free schools, flexible programs and a pressing need for more
scientists. He said, ``To me, it's a new era as far as education is
concerned.''
   Republican New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean said the Bush plan avoids
the past mistake of pouring money into failing schools. ``We're
recognizing schools for excellence ... so they can do even better
as a shining light to schools that haven't done as well.''
   The bill's chief Senate sponsor, Republican Nancy Kassebaum of
Kansas, said prospects of passage are ``very good. ... It's a
package one could hardly be against.'' Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.,
chairman of the Senate education subcommittee, called the package
`` an excellent initiative'' and said its chances are ``pretty
good.''
   Ken Melley, chief lobbyist for the 1.9-million member National
Education Association, said the teacher union is disappointed in
the Bush proposal.
   ``The fact is, if the education budget were to just enjoy the
cost-of-living increase that they give the defense budget, we would
have had another $900 million,'' he said. ``We're half a billion
dollars short of what we've had, in terms of inflation. They
haven't taken any of the provedly successful programs and enhanced
them. There's very little commitment to existing programs.''
   Specifically, the Bush proposal for fiscal 1990 includes:
   _$250 million in merit grants to schools that cut dropout rates,
ease drug problems, raise test scores or show excellence in other
ways.
   _$100 million for ``magnet schools of excellence,'' designed to
encourage open enrollment and parental choice of schools. An
existing $114 million magnet school program to achieve
desegregation would remain separate.
   _$25 million for grants to urban schools that have the most
serious drug problems. ``The plain fact is kids can't suceed in the
classroom if there's drug dealing in the corridors,'' Bush said.
   _$25 million for federal grants to help states create alternate
ways to certify teachers and administrators, as a way of attracting
professionals from other fields into the schools. ``Not all people
who can teach are teachers by training,'' Bush said.
   _$10 million in matching grants to historically black colleges
and universities to help them enrich their endowments.
   _$7.6 million for grants to outstanding teachers.
   _$5 million for scholarships to graduating high school students
who have excelled in mathematics or science.
   _$18 million for three initiatives that do not require
legislative action _ $13 million to expand and evaluate local
education innovations, $2 million for the education of homeless
children and youth, and $3 million for a literacy program for
homeless adults.
   Bush announced his plan after presenting a crystal apple to Mary
Bicouvaris, the National Teacher of the Year. ``Her secret is using
the real world as her classroom,'' Bush said of the Bethel High
School government teacher from Hampton, Va. She ``epitomizes
excellence in education.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jailed terrorist claims he is the European
spokesman for Hezbollah, the umbrella group for factions holding
Western hostages in Lebanon, a news agency reported Wednesday.
   Anis Naccache issued a statement from his cell ``calling on all
Moslems in Europe to preserve their unity faced with plots aimed at
Islam and Moslems,'' Agence France-Presse reported.
   Naccache is serving a life sentence for the unsuccessful attempt
to assassinate former Iranian Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar in
1980. He signed the statement: ``Anis Naccache. Spokesman of the
Hezbollah in Europe.''
   His lawyer, Jacques Verger, confirmed that Naccache issued the
statement, AFP reported.
   Hezbollah, meaning Party of God, is made up of Iranian-backed
Lebanese Shiite Moslem extremists. It is believed to be the
umbrella group for various factions holding 15 foreigners,
including nine Americans, in Lebanon.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Naccache called on fellow Moslems to support Iranian Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's call for the death of Salman Rushdie, author of
``The Satanic Verses.''
   Many Moslems believe the book blasphemes Islam because its
characters include prostitutes who take the names of the prophet
Mohammed's wives. The novel also suggests that Mohammed wrote the
holy Koran rather than receiving it from Allah.
   Rushdie has been in hiding in Britain since Khomeini called for
his death on Feb. 14.

   ``Let's move,'' shouted historian Adam
Michnik, and a band of top Solidarity activists trooped out of the
hotel bar where they met Wednesday before heading to a government
palace to conclude an agreement to legalize the banned union
movement.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa led the animated group down a busy
street to the main palace gate, where police stopped them and told
them to join spectators standing across the street.
   Walesa simply laughed and strode right into the palace.
   Inside, the Solidarity representatives quickly sank into
burgundy-cushioned chairs around the large round table and waited
for the government delegation to appear.
   The government and Solidarity sides eyed each other warily until
the grim delegates of the official trade union OPZZ marched through
a maze of camera cables. They had delayed the opening by 10 minutes.
   The Solidarity side listened politely as Interior Minister Gen.
Czeslaw Kiszczak read his speech. There was no applause when he
finished.
   But Michnik and others smiled broadly when Walesa opened his
speech with the familiar saying: ``There is no freedom without
Solidarity.''
   Security was lax. A group of specially invited Solidarity
supporters chatted in the wings or pressed up against the backs of
security guards to get a glimpse of the proceedings.
   Several Western reporters were allowed to quietly watch some of
the proceedings from corner seats.
   Even before they returned to the ornate halls at the Council of
Ministers palace in central Warsaw where they had negotiated with
authorities for the past nine weeks, the Solidarity delegation
sensed victory.
   ``We have a chance. We will have to see if we can use it,'' said
Jacek Kuron, a leading political theorist who has fought communist
authorities for more than a quarter of a century.
   ``It's good. It's really good. What else can I say?'' said
Zbigniew Bujak, who managed to escape capture during the December
1981 martial-law crackdown and led underground Solidarity until his
arrest in 1986.
   Each of the delegates to the talks autographed a small cardboard
sign lettered with the familiar red-and-white Solidarity logo in
the bar of the Hotel Europejski, which had served as the union
press office during the talks.
   While some members of the Solidarity delegation drank wine and
ate hors d'oeuvres with authorities at a reception at a government
palace, Walesa quietly ordered dinner in the nearly empty dining
room of the nearby Europejski Hotel.
   ``I am exhausted and I don't like eating standing,'' he said as
he and Krzysztof Pusz, his longtime aide, dined on a platter of
cold cuts, sliced bread and tea with lemon.
   When asked why such a modest dinner on such an important night,
Walesa deadpanned: ``The country is in crisis.''
   He declined to make any substantive comment on the outcome of
the talks, but said he would be ready in the morning for a
scheduled news conference.
   Some Solidarity leaders seemed acutely aware that much remains
to be done before the political and economic reforms on which the
union has staked its reputation bear fruit.
   ``The fight has just begun,'' said Alojzy Pietrzyk, a Solidarity
leader from southern city of Jastrzebie, where a wave of strikes by
angry coal miners last August prompted authorities to propose the
round-table talks.
   ``I thought it would be a bigger success, even though we got
more than we hoped for,'' said Grzegorz Stawski, another Jastrzebie
miner. ``The battle has just begun.''
   ``But I sure would like my wife to have seen this,'' he said.

   The oil spill that has blackened
much of the rich ecosystem of Prince William Sound has drawn an
army of scientists who say a lethal combination of weather,
topography and chemistry have conspired against the environment.
   ``This spill is unique,'' said Jacqui Michel, a National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration scientist helping to
coordinate research efforts. ``It's in a restricted inland bay.
We've had this pool of oil sitting on top of the water for days.''
   In addition, the cold water and rough waves have trapped
chemicals that normally would evaporate from spilled crude oil.
   The microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton that form the
basis of the marine ecosystem are especially sensitive to such
toxins. And hydrocarbons even in tiny doses can kill salmon fry
starting to emerge from streams and hatcheries around the sound.
   ``Every day, it's getting a little worse,'' said otter rescue
specialist Chris Donohoe. ``You clean a beach up, the tide changes,
and the oil comes right back.''
   Nearly 400 scientists are sampling water, collecting dead
animals and monitoring beaches in an attempt to quantify what
happens when 10 million gallons of crude oil gushes into a pristine
marine environment.
   The placid sound, protected from the stormy Gulf of Alaska by
mountainous barrier islands, supports an abundance of wildlife.
   But islands that keep stormy seas out can also keep oil in. Some
tendrils of oil have been pushed by currents out into the gulf, but
much of the 2,600-square-mile slick has stayed in the sound.
   Birds soaked in oil lose their buoyancy and their insulation
against the chilly water. When they desperately preen themselves,
they ingest toxins.
   Whales, seals and sea lions have been seen swimming through the
oil and appear to be staying healthy.
   But while most marine mammals depend on a thick fat layer for
insulation, sea otters keep warm by trapping air in their dense,
soft fur and they must keep that fur clean to survive.
   At least 40 dead sea otters have been found and an additional 40
or so have been captured after coming ashore to try to warm up and
wash themselves.
   ``We see them up on the snow, rubbing snow on themselves, trying
to get the oil off,'' said rescuer Elwin Johnston. ``It's
pathetic.''
   Oily bird carcasses are tempting but toxic meals for scavenging
bald eagles, bears, mink and land otters.
   When the tide recedes, a glistening black sheen is left on the
intertidal zone, between high and low tide marks, suffocating kelp
and eel grass.
   Hardy intertidal creatures have adapted to survive long dry
spells, but they cannot handle prolonged exposure to oil. Mussels,
for example, close their shells tightly when they sense toxins in
the water.
   ``They can close down for four or five days, but then they have
to open. If the oil's still there, they die,''' said Steve
Zimmerman, a biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
   Field crews studying some of the 800 miles of shoreline fouled
so far have found many intertidal organisms in advanced stages of
distress. Some are losing their grip on the rocks and being washed
away.
   ``I don't think we'll see completely bare rocks. But a lot of
animals will die, and there will be less for other animals to feed
on,'' Zimmerman said.
   Perhaps the greatest ecological danger of the Prince William
Sound oil spill is the invisible toxins that dissolve into the
water, scientists said.
   Crude oil contains toxic and carcinogenic hydrocarbons such as
benzene, toluene and xylene. Usually these compounds evaporate
within 48 hours of an oil spill.
   But the cold water of Prince William Sound slowed evaporation.
And high wind three days after the accident whipped much of the
slick into a frothy mix of oil, water and air that may have helped
trap those volatiles.
   In addition, the Prudhoe Bay crude oil that spilled has
unusually high levels of heavier hydrocarbons such as naphthalene,
a more persistent toxin. Such hydrocarbons can stick around for
years, sinking into sediments.
   ``Eventually all the oil will go away,'' Michel said. ``But it
may be a long time.''

<HEAD>Wright Acknowledges Selling Books in Lieu of Accepting Speaking Fee</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 6th graf pvs, The panel, to UPDATE with

   House Speaker Jim Wright, under investigation
by a House ethics committee, acknowledged Wednesday that he sold
504 copies of his book, ``Reflections of a Public Man,'' to a Texas
university instead of accepting a $3,000 speaking fee that would
have violated the chamber's rules.
   Wright's income from the book sales _ about $1,600 _ would not
have been subject to House limitations, but the speaker defended
his actions to reporters as he commented publicly on the
arrangement for the first time.
   ``I don't think there's anything wrong with that,'' Wright said.
   At the time, in October 1984, Wright already was bumping against
the maximum amount he could accept in speaking fees for the year
under House rules. In addition, the fee offered by the school,
Southwest Texas State University, was $1,000 more than the rules
permit per speech.
   Wright's bulk sales of the book, and whether he used them to
evade House limits on outside income from speaking and writing
fees, have become a focus of attention by the House ethics
committee, which is looking into the speaker's finances.
   The panel resumed its closed-door deliberations Wednesday after
a two-week Easter break, and committee chairman Rep. Julian Dixon,
D-Calif., said he expected some conclusion would be reached in the
case next week.
   Dixon also said the committee was asking the House to add
$600,000 to its budget for this year, in part to cover growing
costs of the Wright probe. ``We're basically out of money,'' Dixon
said.
   Wright said he had been invited by Bob Hardesty, the university
president, to present the fall lecture in the school's Lyndon B.
Johnson lecture series.
   He said he had not asked for an honorarium for the speech and
was surprised when a check arrived at his office. When an aide
suggested that the speaker sell the school $3,000 worth of books,
he agreed to do so.
   ``I said, if he wants to buy some books, that'll be fine,''
Wright, D-Texas, told reporters at his daily news conference. ``I
don't think there's anything wrong with that.''
   Wright then sent 504 copies of the book to the school, said
university spokeswoman Pat Murdock. That would have yielded Wright
income of about $1,650, which he could then accept because book
royalties do not fall under the 30 percent-of-salary limit that
applies to speaking fees.
   Wright had neared that limit _ $24,630 for the majority leader's
job he then held _ in June of that year, according to his financial
disclosure form.
   In addition to the issue of evading income ceilings, the ethics
panel also was deliberating whether the speaker should have
reported as gifts a series of benefits he received from a business
partner, Fort Worth developer George Mallick; whether Mallick had
``a direct interest'' in legislation, which would have made any
gift over $100 improper; and whether in working for ``forbearance''
language in a bill dealing with savings and loan institutions,
Wright improperly used influence on behalf of a business partner.
   While acknowledging those areas of inquiry, ethics committee
members said there may be other potential rules violations, as
well, but declined to cite specific rules.
   As the committee went into the home stretch in its
deliberations, Wright's allies were preparing their defense. They
expressed relief that the ethics panel has set aside three of the
original six charges against the speaker.
   According to a source sympathetic to Wright, the three concern
Wright's intervention with federal banking regulators on behalf of
troubled savings and loans; his intercession with government
officials on behalf of a Texas oil and gas company; and his use of
a government-paid staff aide to compile parts of a book.
   But Wright's opponents said even if some charges are dropped,
the remaining issues are serious enough to cause the speaker severe
political damage.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The government declared a state of
emergency, put troops on maximum alert and censored the news media
Wednesday after soldiers revolted and demanded the ouster of
Haitian leader Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.
   It was the second mutiny within the 7,000-man army since Sunday,
when Avril narrowly escaped an attempt to overthrow his 6-month-old
government. But diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Avril remained in control.
   Under the state of emergency, an immediate curfew was put into
effect in Port-au-Prince and its suburbs between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m.
   No gunfire was heard, and there was no indication of
insurrection within the ranks of the navy, air force, police or
rural army commands.
   ``Our impresssion is that it is not an attempted coup,'' but
rather an internal army dispute, said one Western diplomat.
   ``It's a standoff,'' another diplomat said. ``I think they're
just staring each other down,'' he said, referring to the rebels
and loyalist troops.
   A government communique said the state of emergency was
necessary because ``certain politicians in Haiti and abroad are
trying in every way to divide the armed forces of Haiti and incite
disorder and violence.''
   Rumors have been circulating widely that the week's rebellion
was organized and funded by former henchmen of the ousted Duvalier
dictatorship exiled in the neighboring Dominican Republic.
   Avril's Presidential Guard stationed two anti-aircraft guns,
four armored personnel carriers and three wheeled cannons inside
the compound of the National Palace.
   Across the Champ-de-Mars Plaza, about 300 supporters gathered
outside the Dessalines Barracks, where the rebellion broke out.
Smoldering barricades temporarily blocked nearby streets.
   Radio reports said rebels seized control of several buildings,
including the telecommunications company, the state-run central
bank, the Ministry of Education and the State Bureau of Statistics.
   Shops in downtown Port-au-Prince closed early. Pedestrians and
motorists fled, leaving the capital's normally congested streets
nearly deserted at midday.
   Workers abandoned Haiti's international airport, forcing
airlines to cancel flights, which had resumed Tuesday for the first
time since the abortive coup.
   A statement by Army General Headquarters read over state-run
television Wednesday afternoon ordered all soldiers to report
immediately to their command posts.
   The government also issued a statement declaring a state of
emergency and telling television, radio and newspapers they could
only disseminate information ``authorized and signed by the
military government.''
   Local radio stations appeared to be ignoring the order,
continuing regular newscasts. The government made no immediate
effort to interfere with foreign news organizations.
   The government order was issued after dissident soldiers from
the feared Dessalines army unit went on the radio to demand Avril's
ouster, blaming the Haitian leader for the deaths of four rebel
soldiers.
   Their announcement over independent Radio Metropole created
confusion in the capital, which had been returning to normal after
the deportation of those accused of leading the uprising over the
weekend.
   Three noncommissioned officers and a captain from the Dessalines
Barracks, the most repressive unit in the army, appeared at Radio
Metropole to issue the statement. ``Avril is responsible for the
deaths of the Leopards. He must go,'' said an unidentified soldier.
   He was referring to the killing of four mutinous soldiers from
the Leopards Battallion during a skirmish Monday with soldiers of
the Presidential Guard.
   The protest came one day after Avril deported the Leopard's
commander, Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu, 38, and two other officers
identified by the government as leaders of the coup attempt, Col.
Philippe Biamby, 36, and Col. Leonce Qualo, 35. He also reportedly
fired six high-ranking officers.
   The three deported officers arrived in Miami with their families
Wednesday and applied for asylum, U.S. immigration officials said.
They were being held temporarily at immigration facilities in
Miami, the officials said.
   The Leopards, a crack, 400-man commando unit, had ended their
revolt Tuesday after their commander was deported. But Radio
Antilles, an independent station, quoted soldiers within the unit
as saying Wednesday they were prepared to join the Dessalines
rebels.
   It was not immediately known how many soldiers from the 700-man
Dessalines Barracks were involved in the protest.
   Wednesday afternoon, about 50 soldiers met reporters at the
barracks to clarify their demands, according to radio reports. They
demanded that Avril resign and hand over power to the president of
the Supreme Court of Appeals and that the government fully restore
the suspended 1987 constitution. Avril has partially restored the
constitution as part of his program of democratic reform.
   The rebels also demanded equal pay and rights afforded members
of Avril's 1,000-man Presidential Guard and legal protection
against arbritrary dismissals.
   Several officers have been discharged or transferred in a
crackdown by Avril on corruption and drug-trafficking within the
army. The United States has made the drug crackdown a condition for
the resumption of $70 million in annual U.S. aid that was suspended
after thugs killed 34 voters in November 1987, thwarting the
country's first free elections in more than three decades.
   Until Wednesday, the Dessalines soldiers had maintained a
neutral position in the aftermath of Sunday's attempt to overthrow
Avril's 6-month-old government.
   Avril, 50, was brought to power last Sept. 11 by noncommissioned
officers who wanted to end state-sponsored violence and ousted Lt.
Gen. Henri Namphy. Namphy took power in 1986 when dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to France, ending a 29-year dynasty.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Bounty Payments for Informants on Contract Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted Wednesday to authorize bounty
payments of up to $250,000 for informants who help prosecutors root
out multimillion dollar contracting fraud against the federal
government.
   The bill went to the House on a 82-16 vote, as senators rejected
an argument that the rewards would encourage Americans to spy on
each other and avoid their duty to report crimes solely out of
patriotism, without getting paid.
   The attorney general would have sole discretion to grant the
rewards from Justice Department funds, but he could seek
court-ordered reimbursement later from criminal fines levied
against convicted violators.
   Federal employees who furnish information in the performance of
official duties could not receive a reward, nor could those who
themselves violated the 1988 Major Fraud Act, which imposed stiff
penalties for contract fraud.
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, chief sponsor of the bill,
said $250,000 ``is not a large amount of money when you're talking
about multimillion dollar fraud.''
   ``We are dealing with a serious problem and have to do
everything we can ... before tax dollars are lost and people are
injured. With better information, we can nip contract fraud in the
bud,'' he said.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., in emotional arguments, said the bill
would encourage the type of neighbor-against-neighbor spying that
occurred in Nazi Germany and in communist countries. But his
amendment to wipe out the proposed rewards was tabled by a vote of
55-43.
   ``I find the provision so repugnant, so repulsive, so demeaning
that we're giving up on America'' by paying people to do their
civic duty, Bumpers argued before the vote.
   ``Are we caving in and saying, `There aren't enough patriots in
this country to do their job so we have to pay them ...?''' he
asked. ``How much do we have to bribe'' informants?
   To be eligible for the money, the informant must give his
information to his employer before contacting authorities, unless
there is a valid reason not to do so. The whistleblower also could
not collect if the information was previously disclosed, unless the
informant was the original source of the information.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Denounce US Military Presence In Honduras</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government claimed Wednesday the
United States is increasing its military presence in Honduras
despite what Nicaragua described as international support for
demilitarizing Central America.
   The accusation was made in a communique published on the front
page of Barricada, the official newspaper of the ruling Sandinista
party.
   Nicaraguan Indian leaders in neighboring Honduras said thousands
of Indian exiles would to return home to vote in Nicaragua's 1990
presidential election.
   Also on Barricada's front page was a dispatch from Havana
quoting Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev as reaffirming
solidarity with Nicaragua.
   It said Gorbachev, who ended a four-day visit Cuba on Wednesday,
soon might visit Nicaragua, which depends on the Soviet bloc for
economic and military aid.
   In the communique, the Sandinistas said it is ``worrisome and
abusive of international law that the United States government
insists on disarming Nicaragua'' and denying it ``necessary means
for its defense, while that same government continues
systematically placing its troops'' in the region.
   The Bush administration has said regional peace efforts would be
advanced it the Soviets cut their military ties with Nicaragua.
   Gorbachev said Tuesday the superpowers should renounce military
intervention in Latin America, but promised military aid to
Nicaragua as long as the United States arms other Central American
nations.
   President Daniel Ortega's government based its accusation about
U.S. military activity on proposed amendments to an agreement on
joint U.S.-Honduran military maneuvers.
   Honduran legislators are considering amendments that would
extend tax and customs privileges to U.S. military personnel on
maneuvers.
   The Sandinista communique described the amendments as a protocol
with ``grave'' implications for peace in Central America and a
``lamentable step ... irreconcilable with the efforts now
developing to reach a durable and just peace in the region.''
   Honduras also has served as a refuge, training ground and
staging base for Nicaraguan rebels supported by the United States.
U.S. and Honduran forces have conducted joint maneuvers for years.
   In Tegucigalpa, capital of Honduras, a spokesman for Indian
leaders Steadman Fagoth Muller and Brooklyn Rivera, told The
Associated Press up to 20,000 refugees might return to Nicaragua
before the presidential election scheduled for Feb. 25, 1990.
   Kendy Medina said Fagoth Muller and Rivera, former rebel
leaders, would join Nicaragua's political opposition.
   ``We plan to leave Honduras over the next nine months to take
advantage of the political opening in Nicaragua,'' Medina said.
``We are convinced we must fight in our own country and with our
own civilized arms.''
   Tens of thousands of Miskito, Rama and Sumo Indians began
leaving their tribal homelands along the Caribbean coast in 1981
after the Sandinistas tried to assert authority over the remote
area and said it would move the Indians to relocation camps.

<HEAD>Tugs, Tide Yank Tanker From Reef</HEAD>

   Six tugboats took up the
slack on tow lines Wednesday and slowly but surely hauled the
oil-spilling tanker Exxon Valdez from a reef that had held it solid
for 12 days.
   The tanker that had spewed more than 10 million gallons of crude
oil into Prince William Sound then had to evade thousands of
icebergs, some as big as houses, that dotted the sea.
   ``We're not going to move fast,'' said Gary Gorski, Exxon's
salvage coordinator. ``We're trying to work our way around these
little dorky bits out here.''
   Icebergs calving from the nearby Columbia Glacier often clog the
tanker lanes in spring and summer.
   The tanker was towed at 3 mph for a 10-hour trip to an already
oil-fouled bay on secluded Naked Island, where temporary repairs
will be made.
   Two skimmers and boats pulling two containment booms trailed the
tanker, mopping up a sheen of oil.
   ``We're just thrilled it appears to have been pulled off so
smoothly,'' said Exxon Shipping Co. spokesman Tom Cirigliano.
   The 987-foot tanker, the second-newest and one of the two
largest vessels in Exxon's 19-tanker fleet, ran aground March 24 on
Bligh Reef, a well-charted and marked navigational hazard 25 miles
south of Valdez, the port at the southern end of the trans Alaska
pipeline.
   The reef tore holes in eight of the tanker's 13 oil tanks and
two of its four ballast tanks.
   For 12 days while the ship was hard aground, water rose and fell
inside the ruptured tanks with the fluctuating tides.
   Tanker Capt. Bill Wallace gave the order Wednesday morning to
seal off vents in those tanks and an inert gas was pumped in under
pressure to force out some of the water. Inert gas, usually
nitrogen, is used to produce an oxygen-free environment and ensure
that petroleum fumes in the tanks can't ignite.

<TEXT>
   The firing of shotgun blasts at the home of a
woman known as Jane Roe in the landmark court case legalizing
abortion is emblematic of a dangerously intensifying battle on the
issue, activists on both sides say.
   Norma McCorvey, the plaintiff in Roe vs. Wade, plans to stay in
hiding until she leaves for a national pro-choice rally in
Washington on Sunday, said a spokeswoman for the Texas Abortion
Rights Action League in Austin.
   ``She's fine, everything's OK, but she doesn't want to talk to
anybody for the next 48 hours,'' Phyllis Dunham, the league's
executive director, said Wednesday. ``She says she's just as fired
up as ever about going to the rally. This has done nothing to shake
her enthusiasm for the effort.''
   Cindy Eby of the Dallas chapter of the National Organization for
Women said Ms. McCorvey will attend the march and possibly address
the crowd, which is expected to include more than 250,000
pro-choice activists.
   Ms. McCorvey's identity was shielded with a pseudonym in the
Dallas case that resulted in the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on
abortion. But she publicly acknowledged her role last year and has
been organizing a pro-choice Jane Roe Foundation.
   Police said windows in Ms. McCorvey's home and car were
shattered at about 4:45 a.m. Tuesday by a three blasts of a
.410-gauge shotgun.
   ``We've got no leads, no suspects,'' said police Sgt. Ron
Ellison.
   While police said they had no information to link the shooting
to Ms. McCorvey's pro-choice activism, people on both sides of the
abortion issue said they feared more violence at weekend rallies
held to support or protest NOW's March for Women's Equality-Women's
Lives in Washington.
   ``I think when you send shotgun blasts through someone's window
that just shows the kinds of desperate tactics and control tactics
that people who want to see abortion outlawed for all time will
stoop to,'' Ms. Dunham said. ``It is and always has been a
heavy-handed, oppressive movement.''
   Anti-abortion activists said they have no idea who was behind
the shooting and that they too fear such acts.
   ``It certainly raises concerns,'' said Bill Price, president of
the Greater Dallas Right to Life Commission. ``We've had things
happen _ windows shot out, obscene phone calls at home. Those kinds
of things increase after things like this. It just puts both sides
on edge.''
   ``I think people are kind of edgy about this court case
anyway,'' Price said, referring to the Supreme Court's decision to
hear a case that could alter the Roe vs. Wade decision. ``This kind
of adds fuel to the fire that isn't needed.''
   Violence by anti-abortion activists is increasing and ``comes
from their frustration to get any legislative or judicial
changes,'' said Patricia Ireland, NOW's executive vice president in
Washington.
   Karen Ashmore, president of NOW's North Dallas chapter, said a
pro-choice leader who works at an abortion clinic had her car
stolen there twice in the last two weeks.
   ``That's not coincidence; that's blatant,'' Ms. Ashmore said.
``We're going to take our white gloves off and start getting
angry.''

<TEXT>
   Mob boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo
and seven associates were convicted Wednesday on first-degree
murder charges in the 1985 slaying of another gangster and could
face the electric chair.
   Jurors deliberated about three hours before returning the
verdict on all counts in the slaying of Frank ``Frankie Flowers''
D'Alfonso in July 1985.
   The jury will begin consideration Thursday on whether the
defendants should face death in the electric chair. No other Mafia
member in the nation, organized crime investigators say, has ever
been sentenced to death.
   Scarfo, 60, is considered head of organized crime in the
Philadelphia-South Jersey area even though he's been in jail for
nearly two years serving a 14-year sentence in a $1 million
extortion. He also faces over 40 years more for a federal
racketeering conviction that included nine murders.
   The key to the prosecution case was the testimony of two
gangster informants who said Scarfo gave the order to kill
D'Alfonso late in the winter of 1985. D'Alfonso was shot to death
nearly six months later on a South Philadelphia street near his
home.
   Defense lawyers said the witnesses, Thomas DelGiorno and Eugene
Milano, were liars who had made deals to save their own lives. Both
had admitted participating in the D'Alfonso conspiracy.
   Assistant District Attorney Charles Grant called the defendants
``brigands of death'' and ``a pack of wolves'' and praised the
informants' courage.
   Milano, who had been one of the defendants in the case, decided
to plead guilty to third-degree murder, thus avoiding the
possibility of execution, and agreed to testify against the others,
including his younger brother, Nicholas, or ``Nicky Whip.''
   The defense, which put on no witnesses, argued prosecutors
failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.
   Scarfo's lawyer, Robert Simone, said in a plea for acquittal
that there were no fingerprints on the guns police found after the
shooting, no witnesses who could identify any of the defendants as
the killers.
   He blasted DelGiorno as a witness ``who violated almost every
commandment that Moses brought down from the mountain'' and Milano
for testifying against his own brother.
   ``This case is full of lies and imagination,'' Simone said.
   Grant, however, said the only way to convict mob members was to
use informants, and denounced the defense allegations that
DelGiorno and Milano were ``vicious vermin, ravenous wolves.''
   ``We have the pack of wolves and the leader of the pack in this
room for the cowardly kill of D'Alfonso,'' Grant said.
   Besides Scarfo and the younger Milano, the others convicted were
Joseph Ligambi, 48, and Philip Narducci, 26, identified as the
shooters; Frances ``Faffy'' Iannarella, 32, accused of supplying
the two murder guns; Salvatore ``Chucki'' Merlino, 47, and his
brother, Lawrence ``Yogi'' Merlino, 32, and Frank ``Windows''
Narducci Jr., 31.

<HEAD>Impeached Arizona Governor Says He'll Run Again</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mainstream Republicans were on the defensive
Wednesday after former Gov. Evan Mecham's announcement that he will
try for a second term as governor despite being impeached and
ousted part way through his first one.
   State Senate President Robert Usdane, meanwhile, rejected
Mecham's call for a new impeachment trial, clearing the way for
Mecham to take his case to court.
   One Republican, state Rep. Jim Hartdegen, wore a black armband
to the House floor Wednesday in mourning for the Republican Party.
   ``The death was last night,'' Hartdegen said. ``The burial will
be in November 1990.''
   Mecham told a cheering rally Tuesday night that he would win the
GOP primary in 1990 and would beat his replacement, Democratic Gov.
Rose Mofford, in the general election.
   ``I committed no impeachable offense,'' said Mecham, a former
auto dealer elected in 1986 on his fifth try for governor.
   ``We'll get about 60 percent in the general,'' he predicted.
   Mrs. Mofford, who automatically replaced Mecham because she had
been elected as secretary of state in 1986, said she wasn't
surprised at Mecham's announcement.
   ``I will match my record with his any time,'' she said. ``I will
not stand by and let him or anyone else turn the clock back
socially, culturally, economically or any other way.''
   Editorial writers and prominent Republicans had urged Mecham not
to run.
   ``There'll be a terrible primary,'' said former Republican House
Speaker Joe Lane, one of the pro-impeachment lawmakers ousted by
Mecham supporters in last fall's elections. ``Democrats will be
organized and we'll have a bloody primary, and I just hate to see
that.''
   Former U.S. Sen. Barry Goldwater predicted Mecham's defeat, and
The Arizona Republic, which has feuded with Mecham for years, said
in an editorial Wednesday that Mecham's strength among GOP party
workers would not translate into voter support.
   ``Taking over the Arizona Republican Party is one thing,'' the
newspaper said in reference to right-wing resolutions that Mecham
backers forced through at last January's state meeting. ``Winning
an election for governor after having been impeached is something
else again.''
   The Mesa Tribune, in an editorial titled ``He's Back,'' said the
GOP, ``already staggering, stumbling, straining for balance, has
been knocked on its tail'' and ``can be expected to tear itself
apart in the months to come.''
   Mecham insisted that there would be no bloodbath.
   ``I want to send word out to everyone in Arizona that I think we
can have a kinder and gentler Arizona,'' he told a crowd of more
than 400 at a hotel ballroom. ``I think the 19 months between now
and the general election of 1990 can be a time of spirited debate
on the issues but not name-calling and not accusations without
basis.''
   Mecham said he held no bitterness toward his critics, but added:
``I do believe that I've been the object of more venemous
name-calling than anyone in our state and possibly in America.''
   The maverick conservative, now 64, was impeached by the
Republican-controlled House on Feb. 5, 1988 and charged with
obstructing justice, misusing state money and concealing a campaign
loan.
   The Republican-controlled Senate convicted him on the
obstruction and money charges. It left the third allegation to a
Maricopa County Superior Court jury for consideration as a criminal
case, and jurors there acquitted Mecham.
   Mecham won election in 1986 with about 40 percent of the vote in
a three-way race.
   Controversial appointments, actions and statements that offended
blacks, Jews, Orientals and others ate away at his popularity
despite a no-tax stand that won him support from many voters.

<TEXT>
   Vietnam said Wednesday it will
withdraw from Cambodia by Sept. 30, nearly 11 years after an
invasion that ended the brutal Khmer Rouge regime and started a
civil war.
   Vietnam had said previously it would remove its remaining
soldiers, estimated at up to 70,000, by September only if a
political settlement was reached but would be out by 1990 in any
case.
   Wednesday's announcement, issued as a joint statement in Phnom
Penh, Hanoi and Vientiane, capital of Laos, did not indicate any
conditions were attached.
   Laos, with its pro-Vietnamese government, was included because
the statement was intended to show regional unity and solidarity.
   The statement said an international commission including Canada,
Poland, Indonesia and India was welcome to supervise the
withdrawal, and called for an end to outside military aid.
   ``Vietnam will withdraw from Kampuchea (Cambodia) all of her
forces by the end of September 1989,'' said the statement read to
reporters by Hun Sen, premier of the government Vietnam installed
in Phnom Penh after the invasion.
   Vietnamese withdrawal and the end of outside aid ``will put an
end to the civil war and stimulate the Kampuchean parties to settle
the internal aspects of the Kampuchean question before September
1989 on the basis of national reconciliation,'' said the statement,
also released by Vietnam's official news agency.
   If foreign countries continue aiding resistance groups, the
government in Phnom Penh reserves the right ``to call on other
countries to give assistance to the Kampuchean people to defend
themselves,'' the statement said.
   In the statement, the three Indochinese countries recommended
revival of an ``international controls and supervision commission''
established by the 1954 Geneva Agreement on Cambodia.
   They said the original commission members _ India, Poland and
Canada _ should be joined by Foreign Minister Ali Alatas of
Indonesia, who presided over recent Cambodian talks, and a
representative of the U.N. secretary-general.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
praised the announcement and said that ``if the withdrawal is
carried out it would be a positive development.''
   Ha Huy Thong, a spokesman for Vietnam's permanent mission to the
United Nations, said: ``As the U.S. has repeatedly said that they
will normalize relations with Vietnam after we withdraw all our
forces from Cambodia, we're now waiting to see if they keep their
promise.''
   Hun Sen said in Phnom Penh that he and Prince Norodom Sihanouk
would meet May 2 in Jakarta, Indonesia, on a political settlement,
but rejected Sihanouk's demand that his government be dissolved
before elections.
   Sihanouk once ruled Cambodia and now leads the alliance of three
guerrilla armies, which includes the communist Khmer Rouge.
   In Beijing, Sihanouk said the withdrawal must be supervised by
the United Nations ``and not by the countries chosen unilaterally''
by Vietnam.
   He said China would end its support of the resistance ``only on
the day when the United Nations will have seen the reality of the
withdrawal.''
   A spokeswoman in Paris for the Khmer People's National
Liberation Front, a member of Sihanouk's coalition, called the
Vietnamese announcement ``a farce.''
   Complete withdrawal from Cambodia would remove a major obstacle
to improvement of Vietnam's relations with non-communist nations of
Southeast Asia, with which it hopes to expand trade and political
cooperations.
   The way also would be eased for normalization of Chinese-Soviet
relations. China supports the resistance. The Soviet Union backs
Vietnam.
   Hun Sen dismissed suggestions from reporters that Vietnam was
moving up the withdrawal date because of Soviet pressure before the
visit to Beijing next month by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Vietnam invaded in December 1978 and ousted the Khmer Rouge,
under whose rule an estimated one-fourth of Cambodia's 8 million
people had died from famine and execution since the Indochina war
ended in 1975.
   Fear of a return to power by the Khmer Rouge, the strongest
force in the resistance coalition, has been a major problems in
negotiations.

   Immigration officials refused Wednesday
to free from prison a Dutch visitor who says he has AIDS, saying
that allowing him to attend a forum on the disease might endanger
the health of others.
   ``Parole is an extreme item that would be used only in extreme
circumstances,'' said Tom Schiltgen, district director of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, explaining his rejection of
the request from Hans Paul Verhoef.
   However, Schiltgen said a decision is likely Thursday on
Verhoef's request for a waiver from immigration laws denying United
States entry to individuals with dangerous contagious disease.
   Schiltgen said that to grant a waiver, the INS must verify that
Verhoef's disease does not pose a health threat and that the U.S.
government would not incur expenses for Verhoef's care.
   Verhoef wants to attend a conference on AIDS in San Francisco.
   Verhoef was taken into custody at Minneapolis-St. Paul
International Airport Sunday by Customs officials who discovered
the AIDS drug AZT in his baggage and then questioned him about the
disease. Verhoef, 31, of Rotterdam, an AIDS prevention worker in
his country, told immigration officials he has acquired immune
deficiency syndrome and was en route to the AIDS conference.
   ``You can't get AIDS from seeing me or giving me a hand or
something,'' Verhoef said. ``You have to do other things which I'm
not intending to do. So I don't think there's any danger of me
spreading the disease.''
   His detention prompted denunciations from AIDS activists. But
immigration officials said they were just following the law.
   ``We are holding Mr. Verhoef as an excludable alien because he
has a dangerous and contagious disease,'' Schiltgen said.
   Schiltgen said tests would be conducted to verify Verhoef has
the disease before authorities proceed with the case. The tests
should be completed within a few days, he said.
   For years, immigration laws have required people who want to
enter the United States to establish they have no dangerous,
contagious diseases. Congress added AIDS to that list of diseases
in 1987.
   Verhoef's incarceration provoked protests at the state Capitol
in St. Paul and criticism of the INS's handling of the case from
Sister Mary Madonna Ashton, the state health commissioner.
   ``There was no need to treat Mr. Verhoef in this fashion while
the legal issues surrounding his case were resolved,'' said Ashton.
``Having this disease is not a crime, and treating it has though it
were can serve no useful purpose.''

<TEXT>
   In the first prosecution under a 1986
anti-apartheid law, an aviation company and its chairman pleaded
guilty Wednesday to importing four jet engines that were owned by
South African Airways.
   Air Ground Equipment Sales Inc. of West Babylon, N.Y., and its
chairman, Robert Fessler, had been indicted Monday.
   Their guilty pleas were part of an agreement with federal
prosecutors, who said the case was the first prosecution under the
Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986.
   Fessler told U.S. District Judge Mark A. Costantino of Brooklyn
that he had been negotiating to buy the engines from South African
Airways before the law was enacted. The company went ahead with the
purchase and shipped the engines to Israel, where a deal to sell
them to an Israeli company fell through, he said.
   ``A business judgment was made to continue the deal after the
law was enacted,'' Fessler said. The engines were shipped to the
United States in August 1987.
   ``I realized at the time we were dealing with a subsidiary of
the South African government,'' he said after he pleaded guilty to
the charge.
   The 1986 law bans the importation of goods ``grown, produced,
manufactured by, marketed or otherwise imported'' by organizations
that are part of or controlled by the South African government.
Congress enacted the sanction in an effort to pressure South
Africa's white-minority government to modify its system of racial
separation.
   As part of the plea agreement, three other counts in the
indictment against Fessler are to be dismissed at sentencing June
9. Fessler faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   The company entered its plea through an attorney, Jerry Markham.
It pleaded guilty to the anti-apartheid law and customs fraud for
using falsified documents.
   Air Ground agreed to pay a $1 million fine and forfeit the
engines to the U.S. government. The engines, which are used in
Boeing 747 jumbo jets, are valued at $1 million apiece.
   The company buys, sells and leases airplane equipment.

<TEXT>
   A ring of about 2,000 thieves trained in
South America is operating in this country, traveling in teams
under false names and stealing more than $500 million a year,
authorities say.
   ``The whole thing is mind-boggling,'' said Walter Lamar, an FBI
agent in San Francisco. ``Like a horde of locusts, seemingly
everywhere and constantly on the move. The scale of the problem has
not yet been identified by law enforcement.''
   The thieves are primarily Colombian nationals based in Los
Angeles and New York, who steal diamonds, precious gems, rare
coins, travelers checks and expensive clothes, authorities say.
Ring members live under a strict code of silence and willingly jump
bail, officials say.
   ``It's impossible to surveille these guys,'' said San Francisco
police Detective Ray Kilroy. ``They're real pros. They know exactly
what they're doing.''
   This year, the ring for the first time will be included in the
California Department of Justice annual report to the Legislature
on organized crime.
   ``We're getting Teletypes from throughout the nation,'' about
the ring's thefts, said Ken Bowen, supervisor of the department's
organized crime and criminal intelligence bureau.
   Although the FBI in 1985 set up a central clearinghouse _
code-named Colgem for ``Colombian Gem'' _ to gather photographs,
fingerprints and rap sheets on ring members, the bureau has not
made a concerted push to go after the ring, said Robin Wright,
section chief in the FBI's criminal investigative division.
   In addition to Los Angeles, the Chicago, New York and Miami
police departments have at times operated gem ring task forces. The
Los Angeles task force, created a year ago at a meeting of 16
federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, was to have
disbanded in December, but is still operating.
   Police estimate Los Angeles has 300 to 1,000 ring members and
that 700 to 1,200 live in New York's borough of Queens.
   Gem dealers wonder when the situation will change, said Jack B.
White, president of the Jeweler's Security Alliance and a former
FBI agent. The thieves ``are smart. They are successful without a
gun, without weapons. They have tactics that work.''

   South Africa called Wednesday for black
nationalist guerrillas to surrender or face more attacks in the
5-day-old battle that has left at least 200 people dead.
   The leader of the South-West Africa People's Organization said
his guerrilla fighters had no intention of leaving the South
African-controlled territory, a newspaper reported.
   A confidential U.N. report obtained by The Associated Press
indicated that U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
approved of allowing the South African troops off their bases
before the fighting.
   The United States said it had offered an aircraft to the United
Nations to airlift a battalion of about 850 Finnish soldiers to
Namibia.
   ``The U.N. has accepted the offer. We are working out the
details with the U.N. and cannot say when the U.N. troops will
arrive,'' the State Department said in a statement. U.N. and
Finnish officials confirmed the statement but declined to elaborate.
   Angola's news agency reported from Luanda that SWAPO had
presented a peace plan to U.N. officials, but no details were
released.
   ``SWAPO must surrender, lay down their arms, hoist a white flag
_ then nothing will happen to them,'' Foreign Affairs Minister Pik
Botha said in a shortwave radio broadcast beamed throughout Namibia.
   If the guerrillas turn themselves in to police, ``then they will
be safely taken back'' to bases in Angola, Botha said on
government-run Radio South Africa.
   The fighting between South African-led police and SWAPO
guerrillas began Saturday, the day a U.N.-supervised independence
plan began in Namibia.
   The battles continued for a fifth straight day Wednesday, and
territorial authorities said 179 guerrillas, 21 members of the
security forces and an undetermined number of civilians have been
killed in the most intense combat of the 23-year war.
   South Africa claims that about 1,400 guerrillas have crossed
into Namibia since Saturday in violation of an agreement that calls
for combatants on both sides to be confined to bases.
   Under the U.N. plan, guerrillas were to remain at their bases in
Angola at least 100 miles north of Namibia's border until mid-May.
Some U.N. and other officials have suggested that SWAPO field
commanders mistakenly thought their units could return unmolested
to Namibia as of April 1 and set up bases there.
   The SWAPO leader, Sam Nujoma, claims the guerrillas have been in
Namibia for some time and that the security forces instigated the
fighting.
   The Star of Johannesburg, reporting from Harare, Zimbabwe,
quoted Nujoma as saying his forces would not withdraw to Angola.
   ``If you read the (U.N.) resolution carefully it does not say
guerrilla forces who were found in Namibia on April 1 should be
driven out ... to be confined in Angola,'' Nujoma was quoted as
saying.
   SWAPO Secretary-General Andimba Toivo, in an interview with the
AP at the United Nations in New York, said: ``Our forces are not
going to be withdrawn. They will remain in Namibia, which is our
country.''
   South Africa has threatened to scrap plans for granting
independence to the territory unless the United Nations takes
strong steps to resolve the crisis.
   Louis Pienaar, the South African-appointed administrator-general
of Namibia, said if the guerrillas did not surrender by Saturday,
police will pursue them ``with all the means at their disposal.''
   If guerrillas were seen heading north toward Angola they ``will
not be pursued aggressively,'' Pienaar added.
   Cedric Thornberry, a senior official of the U.N. peacekeeping
contingent in Namibia, said efforts to establish a truce ``are
being advanced with critical urgency, because we are now facing a
deteriorating situation in the north.''
   He said the United Nations was giving ``active consideration''
to advancing the arrival of the rest of its planned 4,650-member
military monitoring force. Only 921 members of the force are now in
Namibia. The remaining troops, including those from Finland, are to
arrive by the end of the month.
   The United Nations has declined to state publicly how and why
South African troops engaged the guerrillas and who gave the order.
U.N. officials say that is confidential information.
   Toivo said Perez de Cuellar denied in a meeting on Tuesday night
that U.N. officials had authorized the move.
   A copy of a confidential report Perez de Cuellar issued Monday
night in New York, however, cites reports of a mass incursion by
SWAPO and says:
   ``In all these circumstances and upon the urgent and joint
recommendation of my special representative and the (peacekeeping)
force commander, I authorized them (the U.N. officials) to accept a
strictly limited and temporary suspension of the requirement for
some units of the South African military to be confined to base.''
   SWAPO, which gets most of its military assistance from the East
bloc, has battled South African rule since 1966 and has been
favored to win the most votes in pre-independence elections planned
for November under the U.N. plan.
   However, Botha, in a letter to Perez de Cuellar, said Tuesday
that ``unless active and effective measures are taken within the
next few hours ... the whole peace process in Namibia is in danger
of collapse.''
   The way for Namibian independence was cleared in December when
South Africa, Angola and Cuba signed an accord calling for
withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban soldiers who have helped Marxist Angola
battle U.S.-backed rebels.
   Namibia, which has 1.3 million people, is roughly the size of
France and West Germany combined. The predominantly black
population includes about 75,000 whites.

<HEAD>Mubarak Says Shamir Is Closing Doors to Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said Wednesday
that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is ``closing all the
doors'' to peace in the Middle East by opposing an international
peace conference on the region and refusing to give up occupied
land.
   In a speech to a foreign policy group in Manhattan, however,
Mubarak sounded a more optimistic note about achieving an end to
the turmoil in the West Bank and Gaza than he did in statements
Tuesday in Washington.
   ``It has been suggested that the situation there is not ripe for
a solution. Nothing can be further from the truth,'' he told 400
guests at a luncheon held by the Foreign Policy Association at the
Waldorf-Astoria hotel.
   ``In the past few years, several factors converge in the favor
of prompt settlement of the conflict. The Palestinian movement has
raised the olive branch higher than ever and accepted all the
requirements for peace.''
   On Tuesday, he said of the violence in the occupied territories,
``If anybody could stop it, we would be very pleased. But how?''
   Mubarak stopped in New York on his way back to Cairo after
meeting with President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker
III in Washington. Bush said the two leaders agreed that Israel
should end its occupation of Arab lands and called for a ``properly
structured'' international Middle East peace conference.
   The Egyptian president complimented Bush at the luncheon,
calling him ``a very knowledgeable man. ... He knows the whole
story of the Middle East from beginning to end.''
   Shamir followed Mubarak to Washington, where he met with Baker
Wednesday and will have a session with Bush Thursday. The Israeli
prime minister has said an international conference would lead to
other countries ganging up on Israel and forcing it to yield land
which Shamir's right-wing Likud Bloc maintains is an inextricable
part of Israel.
   In response to a written question at the luncheon, Mubarak said
he thought it would be ill advised for him to consider a trip to
Israel after recent statements made by Shamir denouncing the idea
of an international conference or trading land for peace.
   ``Please tell me, after that, if you were in my shoes could
(you) go there, have coffee and turn back and tell the public
opinion of Egypt that Mr. Shamir loved me?'' Mubarak asked.

   Shells blasted street markets and a
hospital Wednesday, killing at least 22 people in another of the
fierce Christian-Moslem artillery duels that have kept residents in
bomb shelters for a month.
   The Arab League appealed for a cease-fire and the shooting
stopped at the appointed hour of midnight, at least temporarily,
although the Christian military commander had not agreed to the
truce.
   However, a Christian radio reported six shells falling in
different locations in the Christian area in the first hour after
midnight, and a pro-Syrian Moslem radio reported one shell hit the
Moslem area.
   Police gave the death toll and said 70 people were wounded. It
was the fifth day Moslem and Christian residential areas have been
bombarded without letup.
   At least 159 people have been killed and 576 wounded since the
battle began March 8 between Gen. Michel Aoun's Christian army
units and an alliance of Druse militiamen and Syrian troops.
   Nearly all the casualties have been civilians. It is the worst
fighting since 1985 in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   Sheik Sabah Ahmed Sabah, Kuwait's foreign minister and head of
an Arab League mediation team, called for the truce after meeting
in Damascus, Syria, with Lebanese Moslem leaders.
   ``We appeal to all the warring parties to observe a cease-fire
as of midnight,'' he said. Sabah urged belligerents to end attacks
on ports and airports, and to permit opening of crossing points
between Moslem west Beirut and the Christian eastern sector.
   Acting Premier Salim Hoss endorsed the cease-fire.
   ``I urge all sides to comply with the proposed truce out of
mercy for the battered population,'' said Hoss, who heads the
Moslem cabinet in what has been a dual government since a political
crisis arose in September.
   Jibran Kourieh, spokesman for Hafez Assad, did not say whether
the Syrian president endorsed the cease-fire but said he supported
the committee's work.
   ``President Assad stressed the necessity that all cooperate to
save Lebanon from the difficult circumstances it is going through
so (it) becomes united ... and cooperates with the Arab nation,''
Kourieh said.
   Aoun, who leads the Christian cabinet in addition to commanding
the 20,000 Christian army troopers, rejected any truce that does
not name the Syrian army as his main adversary.
   ``There is only one power on the other side that can cease or
unleash fire,'' he said in an interview broadcast on Christian
stations in Beirut. ``It is the Syrian army, and any Lebanese cover
for the Syrian army is unacceptable.''
   If Syria accepts a cease-fire, he said, ``Then I will accept.''
   He said he would negotiate whatever arrangements Syria needs to
``ensure its military and political security, but the Syrian army
must go. We shall settle for nothing less.''
   Assad has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping
mandate from the Arab League and has become the country's main
power broker. Aoun calls the Syrians an occupation army and has
vowed to drive them out.
   In an interview published earlier, the London-based newspaper
Mideast Mirror quoted Aoun as saying he was willing to lift a
blockade of illegal militia-run ports if the ports were not used
for narcotics or arms traffic.
   The fighting began March 8, two days after Aoun's forces closed
the ports, which deprive the government of an estimated $100
million of duties and other revenue.
   Syrian troops in turn blockaded the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave north and east of Beirut, where 1 million Christians live,
with the aid of Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib, who leads Lebanon's 22,000
Moslem soldiers. Khatib's men are poorly equipped and have stayed
out of the fighting.
   A police spokesman said most of the casualties Wednesday were in
Moslem west Beirut, where shells fired by Aoun's gunners hit three
vegetable markets and the Barbir hospital, one of the Moslem
sector's four major medical centers.
   He said the Murr tower, an unfinished 40-story skyscraper Syrian
troops use as a base for snipers and artillery spotters, took
several direct hits from 155mm howitzers.
   Syrian soldiers were seen evacuating casualties from the tower,
firing automatic rifles into the air to clear the way for emergency
vehicles. There was no word on casualties from headquarters of the
12,000 Syrian soldiers stationed in Beirut.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France, the ruling power in
Lebanon until independence in 1943, called Lebanon ``a community in
peril'' and said his government was sending two ships loaded with
food and medical supplies.
   Jean-Francois Deniau, vice president of the French National
Assembly's foreign affairs committee, arrived in Beirut for
meetings with leaders of both sides.
   More than 700 Lebanese who fled the fighting got off the ferry
Baroness on Wednesday in Larnaca, Cyprus. Capt. George Papadimatos
said the ferry waits outside the Lebanese Christian port of Jounieh
all day, then slips in without lights after dark to load passengers.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived
Wednesday night from Cuba for a 40-hour visit that will mix hard
talk on human rights with traditional British pageantry.
   Flying from the sweltering Caribbean into freezing British rain
at Heathrow Airport, Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, got a
red-carpet welcome with a royal military band. Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher welcomed them with a warm smile on the tarmac
after the plane touched down at 11 p.m.
   After the Soviet national anthem was played, Gorbachev and Mrs.
Thatcher walked briskly under a pink umbrella past the honor guard
of the Royal Air Force. ``Natural massage,'' Gorbachev joked of the
rain.
   Gorbachev and Mrs. Thatcher made no statement before driving
together to the Soviet Embassy residence in London to chat over
coffee. Mrs. Gorbachev rode with Mrs. Thatcher's husband, Denis.
   Thatcher aides said the two leaders, accompanied by their
foreign ministers, toasted each other at the Soviet ambassador's
residence. ``The atmosphere was very good. They were very pleased
to see each other,'' said the aide, who spoke on condition he was
not identified.
   But they also got down to business, discussing Afghanistan and
southern Africa, British officials said. On the Feb. 15 withdrawal
of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, Mrs. Thatcher told Gorbachev he
``had fulfilled his promise before the world to depart.''
   About 100 people campaigning for Jewish refuseniks demonstrated
peacefully at an entrance to Kensington Palace Gardens where the
Soviet Embassy is housed. Gorbachev and Mrs. Thatcher arrived at
another entrance.
   Gorbachev's visit, which includes a lunch with Queen Elizabeth
II at Windsor castle, is a major step in Gorbachev's overtures to
Western Europe. But while Britain is laying on the sort of lavish
reception it used to reserve for its special allies, there were
signs of official anxiety that the Gorbachev charm is working too
well.
   Thursday was set aside for 2{ hours of talks at Mrs. Thatcher's
10 Downing St. residence, followed by a wreath-laying ceremony at
Westminster Abbey, a visit to a high-tech factory outside London
and a Downing Street banquet.
   Officials say Anglo-Soviet relations have never been better
since World War II, and Mrs. Thatcher, interviewed on Soviet TV
Wednesday, had warm words for Gorbachev. She recalled a previous
meeting at which she felt as though Gorbachev was trying to point
``a giant searchlight into the future.''
   ``I had a deep instinct that it was the beginning of a quite new
relationship,'' she said. ``He had this great vision... it really
has far more in common with the system we have worked toward over
the years and which has given us our prosperity and our freedom.''
   But the Thatcher government is also issuing pointed reminders
about Soviet human rights abuses and military might, and charges
that KGB agents are still spying and the Kremlin is still too
secretive about its chemical weapons.
   A full-page advertisement signed by 212 of the 650 members of
the House of Commons appeared in Wednesday editions of The Times of
London, urging Britain to boycott a human rights conference in
Moscow in 1991 unless Gorbachev measures up to a ``checklist.''
   ``Freedom to emigrate; freedom of religious and cultural
expression; freedom from discrimination; freedom of all prisoners
of conscience; freedom of speech; freedom to monitor these basic
rights,'' said the list.
   Nevertheless, opinion polls in Europe suggest Gorbachev's charm
offensive is getting results.
   A Market Opinion and Research International poll in Wednesday's
Times showed that only 17 percent of Britons consider the Soviet
Union a threat, compared with 42 percent in 1981.
   Only 35 percent of the 2,025 people questioned believed the
Kremlin wants to extend its power over other countries, down from
70 percent in 1981.
   Mrs. Thatcher first met Gorbachev in 1984, when he was the No.
2, and declared, ``I like Mr. Gorbachev. We can do business
together.''
   Since then, Gorbachev appears to have forged a warm relationship
with the doctrinaire anti-communist once dubbed ``The Iron Lady''
by the Kremlin.
   She visited Moscow in 1987, and Gorbachev was to have come to
London in December, but canceled the trip because of the Armenian
earthquake.
   Soviet officials have been on British radio and TV all week
talking about Gorbachev's reforms and the dawn of a new era in
East-West relations.
   The Gorbachevs will have lunch Friday with the queen, arriving
at Windsor Castle in a procession of carriages and cavalry escorts.
The elite Coldstream Guards will serve as guard of honor.
   Beforehand Gorbachev will give a major speech in the splendid
setting of London's ancient Guildhall, seat of city government for
1,000 years.
   Mrs. Gorbachev will go sightseeing with Education Secretary
Kenneth Baker, taking in landmarks such as St. Paul's Cathedral and
Tower Bridge.

   Leftist guerrillas attacked
army and civilian targets in central and eastern El Salvador on
Wednesday and sabotaged power lines, leaving much of the capital
without power.
   Eight rebels were killed and seven wounded in two days of
combat, the army said.
   In the afternoon, the rebels also made an unsuccessful attack on
the Artillery Brigade in San Juan Opico, 16 miles northeast of the
capital, an army official said.
   The rebels' Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front threatened
last week to step up attacks and present President-elect Alfredo
Cristiani with ``an ungovernable country'' when he takes office on
June 1.
   Guerrillas destroyed seven power pylons and fired rifles at army
positions in Quezaltepeque, about 16 miles northwest of San
Salvador, the armed forces press office said. No casualties were
reported.
   It said that in Nueva Guadalupe, 74 miles east of San Salvador,
rebels early Wednesday destroyed a telecommunications office, the
town's judicial chambers and several vehicles owned by a
construction company, and slightly damaged the local civil defense
headquarters.
   Guerrillas dynamited a textile mill in Soyapango, four miles
east of San Salvador, in an attack National Police blamed on urban
commandos of the Farabundo Marti.
   Urban guerrillas exploded dynamite charges late Tuesday at 10
local bank offices and destroyed five electrical pylons in the
capital, creating panic in some neighborhoods and leaving most of
the city in darkness. One explosion slightly injured a child,
officials said.
   Troops exchanged gunfire with guerrillas in Jucuaran, 80 miles
east of San Salvador, killing one rebel and wounding two, the press
office said. It said no army casualties resulted.
   The armed forces said soldiers of the Belloso counterinsurgency
battalion killed seven rebels and wounded five Tuesday in an attack
on a guerrilla base camp in Suchitoto, 27 miles north of the
capital. Troops discovered mines, explosive charges and medicines
inside the camp, it said.
   Troops also dismantled two guerrilla camps in northern
Chalantenango province, a rebel stronghold.
   Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a member of the Farabundo Marti's
political directorate, warned last week of increased guerrilla
attacks before Cristiani takes office.
   Cristiani, of the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, won
the March 19 presidential elections.
   The Farabundo Marti has waged a 9-year-old civil war against the
U.S.-supported government. More than 70,000 Salvadorans, most of
them civilians, have been killed.

   A judge set bail on Wednesday at 20 times
the amount that prosecutors sought for the fired captain of the
Exxon Valdez, the ship that caused the nation's worst oil spill.
   A pale, shaken and sweating Joseph Hazelwood, whose lawyer had
sought $5,000 cash bail, was led from the courtroom in handcuffs
after Judge Kenneth Rohl set bail at $1 million bond or $500,000
cash.
   ``These misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been
equaled, at least in this country,'' Rohl said. ``He's got to think
about that. We have a man-made destruction that has not been
equaled, probably, since Hiroshima.''
   The U.S. atom bombing of Hiroshima in 1945 killed or injured
nearly 130,000 people and leveled 90 percent of the Japanese city.
   A judge in Alaska had set bail for Hazelwood at $50,000.
   The size of bail shocked both prosecutors and defense attorneys.
   ``We can't take out our wrath on one individual,'' said Suffolk
County District Attorney Patrick Henry. ``It's oversimplification
to settle on one individual.''
   Michael Chalos, an attorney for Hazelwood, said: ``It was tough
for our client to hear, especially after the district attorney had
recommended $25,000 bail. It was very harsh, we thought.''
   Hazelwood was arraigned in Suffolk County court on a fugitive
warrant and granted 30 days to prepare for a hearing on his
extradition to Alaska.
   Authorities there have charged him with three misdemeanors:
operating a ship while intoxicated, reckless endangerment, and
negligent discharge of oil. He faces 2\ years in prison.
   A $1 million bond can be secured with as little as 10 percent
collateral in cash, officials said.
   Rohl said that even though Hazelwood faces only misdemeanors,
``We are not talking about someone breaking someone's windshield.
We are talking about a global catastrophe.''
   Hazelwood allegedly admitted drinking before the tanker ran
aground and caused the 10.1 million-gallon oil spill. As such, he
is ``the architect of an American tragedy,'' prosecutor Philip
Castellano Jr. told the judge. He recommended bail be set at
$25,000.
   Another attorney for Hazelwood, Thomas Russo, had sought $5,000
bail on the grounds his client was not a fugitive and not a
criminal.
   It was unclear how quickly the captain might make bail.
   ``A million dollars is a lot of money,'' Chalos said.
   The Exxon Valdez hit a reef in Prince William Sound on March 24,
and Hazelwood apparently left Anchorage the next night on a flight
for New York. The 42-year-old seaman is a resident of the Long
Island community of Huntington.

   For the second time in a week, former baseball
commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth thought he had a deal to purchase
Eastern Airlines only to see the agreement with Texas Air Corp.
Chairman Frank Lorenzo hit snags at the last minute.
   A source familiar with the negotiations said the two sides
reached an accord Tuesday night and were set to make the
announcement Wednesday. The source said the deal began to unravel
on Wednesday morning, as Ueberroth believed Lorenzo was again
changing the terms of the agreement.
   ``Both sides thought they had a deal but there were some
sticking points that kept negotiations continuing instead of
concluding,'' the source said.
   Ueberroth, who returned to New York late Tuesday night from his
California home, began negotiations with Lorenzo at 7:30 a.m. EST
Wednesday and continued them until around 8 p.m. The source told
The Associated Press that negotiations would resume Thursday
morning.
   ``They don't have a deal,'' the source said. ``There's still
negotiations and sticking points. It's not done.''
   Sources close to Texas Air, however, said Ueberroth himself
raised minor sticking points that kept the deal from being
consummated.
   The deal appeared to be closed Wednesday afternoon, when a New
York public relations firm that works with Lorenzo was told to rent
a hotel room for a 7 p.m. news conference to announce it. At 6:35
p.m., the public relations firm was told there would be no
announcement.
   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent in Houston said the company
declined comment on the negotiations.
   The deal had appeared to be completed Wednesday afternoon, when
a New York public relations firm that works with Lorenzo was told
to rent a hotel room for a 7 p.m. news conference to announce it.
At 6:35 p.m., the public relations firm was told there would be no
announcement.
   Separately, the U.S. bankruptcy court appointed Washington
attorney David Shapiro as examiner in the Eastern bankruptcy
reorganization case.
   Shapiro, 60, a partner in the firm Dickstein Shapiro &amp; Morin,
was recommended by U.S. Trustee Harry Jones and appointed by U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland.
   Lifland recently ordered the appointment of an examiner, whose
unusually broad powers would include a mandate to mediate the
bitter labor dispute at Eastern and get the airline flying again.
   Union and airline sources had indicated late Tuesday night and
throughout Wednesday that a sale to the Ueberroth group was
virtually certain. Eastern booked a meeting room for 7 p.m.
Wednesday at a Manhattan hotel in anticipation of a possible deal,
but later told arriving reporters there was no announcement.
   Bruce Zirinsky, a bankruptcy attorney representing Eastern, said
an accord on the sale of the carrier was ``likely imminent.'' He
didn't name the suitor but sources have said it was the Ueberroth
group, which made and later withdrew a $464 million offer for
Eastern last week.
   Zirinsky told Lifland, who is overseeing Eastern's Chapter 11
reorganization and must approve any sale arrangement, that serious
negotiations on a sale of Eastern continued Wednesday.
   ``Eastern has been and continues to be involved in very serious
negotiations with a third party regarding the possible acquisition
of Eastern Airlines,'' Zirinsky told the judge at an afternoon
bankruptcy hearing.
   Asked when agreement was likely, he said it was ``a matter of
days, if not sooner.''
   Eastern and a 15-member committee representing unsecured
creditors of the airline on Tuesday requested postponement of an
examiner appointment for at least 24 hours. Lifland then ordered
Jones to explain in a Wednesday hearing why the appointment should
be deferred.
   Zirinsky declined to tell reporters after the hearing whether
Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. was negotiating with the Ueberroth
group.
   But Mary Jane Barry, head of the Eastern flight attendants union
in Miami, said Ueberroth notified her by telephone Wednesday that
``there would be a potential sale of the airline, possibly today.''
   Eastern has been virtually grounded since its Machinists union
struck March 4 and pilots and flight attendants walked out in
support. The airline filed for protection from creditors in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court March 9. Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo has been
trying to sell the carrier for weeks.
   In a separate court action, Lifland approved an agreement
between attorneys for Eastern and the Machinists union governing
areas where peaceful picketing would be allowed at New York's
LaGuardia Airport and at Logan International Airport in Boston.
Eastern had asked the judge to restrain union picketing on Eastern
property.
   Ueberroth's group made a $464 million offer for Eastern last
week and then withdrew the bid after being told by Texas Air that
it had been topped by another suitor, identified by sources close
to the situation as billionaire hotel executive Jay A. Pritzker.
   Under the terms of Ueberroth's first offer, he and Thomas
Talbot, a former airline executive from California, would have
owned 30 percent of the airline. Eastern's unions would have
received another 30 percent in exchange for wage and work-rule
concessions. The remaining 40 percent would have been held by new
investors.
   The offer called for $200 million to be paid in cash and the
rest in securities to be sold by the group's investment bankers,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Ardshiel Inc., a smaller New York
firm.

   President Bush, who campaigned on a promise to

million education package designed to reward and promote school
improvements.
   ``We're going to take action _ action to make excellence in
education not just a rallying cry, but a classroom reality,'' Bush
said at a Rose Garden ceremony outside the White House.
   His ``Excellence in Education Act,'' based in part on campaign
pledges, would reward outstanding schools, teachers and science
scholars, encourage districts to create magnet schools with special
curriculums, push states to develop new ways to certify teachers,
help drug-ridden urban schools and bolster the endowments of
historically black colleges.
   ``These education initiatives don't constitute a cure-all, a

we wish that more funds were available to spend on all levels of

   Slipping bits of religion into countries that
oppose it used to be high adventure but it has mellowed, says a
practitioner. Still, he adds, many barriers remain.
   The Rev. Robert K. Hawley, director of ``Open Doors, USA,'' says
that while some of the suspense and drama of its operations have
waned, the organization continues tackling the stiffest restraints
on faith.
   ``We go to the most restricted of restricted countries,''
seeking to bolster religious life, he said in an interview. ``We do
it officially if we can. If we can't, we do it unofficially.
   ``We always obey the government unless it's contrary to the
Gospel.''
   He heads the U.S. branch of an interdenominational,
international organization with an $11 million annual budget, a
staff of 250, headquarters in the Netherlands and operations in 30
countries.
   The U.S. branch, with offices in Santa Ana, Calif., has a staff
of 36, along with hundreds of volunteers spending time in aided
areas. Hawley, 40, is a Texas-born Baptist clergymen who previously
led California congregations.
   The organization was founded in 1955 by a Dutch Reformed
minister, Brother Andrews, its president, with the objective of
supplying Bibles and other religious materials in areas of
religious oppression.
   His widely sold book, ``God's Smuggler,'' put a picturesque
stamp on the organization _ the undercover activities, secret
missions and meetings, clandestine rendezvous _ and some of that
aura lingers, though tamer now.
   ``This kind of ministry has matured,'' he said. ``The world
generally has recognized religious restrictions as a human rights
issue.''
   However, code names still are given to various undertakings,
such as ``Project Philip,'' by which Western volunteers now are
providing theological training in homes in Soviet-bloc countries to
equip ministers.
   Hawley said 1,800 students now are involved, and 250 have become
pastors.
   He said circumventing regulations still is necessary in some
cases, even in the thawing communism of China. Although Bibles now
printed there go to registered church members, he said ``house''
Christians are left out.
   ``To buy a Bible, you usually have to show you are a member of a
registered church,'' he said. In this category are about nine
million Protestants and Catholics, but an estimated 50 million
others worship in homes.
   In trying to hand-carry Bibles to the ``house'' Christians last
year, he said a batch of 200 in his bags were confiscated by
customs agents, who cited a law forbidding entry of outside
religious material.
   ``When they say they're open now, it's only what they define as
open,'' he said. ``We have about 500 couriers going into China
every year. Many get caught. But many don't. We call it a miracle
of God.''
   He said Chinese contacts are alerted in advance, with meeting
places arranged to begin the distribution process. Rejecting
criticism by some church officials that such smuggling worsens
conditions for believers, he said:
   ``They encourage it, they encourage us,'' he said. ``We as a
ministry never take materials into a country unless specifically
requested by Christians there. Our job is not to jeopardize but
help them.''
   Nevertheless, he said, the situation has eased in most communist
areas, and much work that once was done covertly now is carried on
in the open, with official approval.
   He has just returned from a two-week trip to the Soviet Union,
and said he is ``cautiously optimistic'' about its expanding
religious vitality. ``There is more freedom,'' he said.
   His organization now has a government-approved project under way
to ship a million New Testaments, with Psalms, to Russian Orthodox
Christians this year, the first batch of 100,000 delivered while he
was there.
   He said various groups, including the United Bible Societies,
have shipped more than a million Bibles to the Soviet in the last
two years with official permission.
   More than 400 new churches opened there last year and l,000 more
are expected to be opened this year, bringing the total to more
than 15,000, he said. He said prospects are that two Russian
Orthodox prelates will be made members of the Supreme Soviet,
limited in the past to the Communist Party.
   He said that just as Stalin in 1942 eased anti-religious
measures in order to mobilize Christian support for the war with
Nazism, the present communist regime realizes church people are
essential to reviving the Soviet economy.
   ``The church is the Soviet's largest labor union for
revitalizing the economy,'' Hawley said, adding that church
membership there exceeds 70 million.
   He said that for the first time, ``the church has been
recognized by the government as a valuable and viable insitution
for the moral training and character of society.''
   However, he added, ``until there are Bibles in Soviet schools,
bookstores and the church, the society is not free.'' When it was
noted that U.S. public schools shun Bible courses because of
church-state separation, he said, ``That doesn't make it right.''

   There's a busy reception room at the Capitol
named for former Senate majority leader Mike Mansfield, but his own
visits are rare and by invitation only.
   ``I've seen too many retired senators go back too often,'' said
Mansfield, now 86, an elder statesman with two portfolios. He
served 16 years as the leader of the Senate Democratic majority,
then 11 as the U.S. ambassador to Japan. No one ever has served
longer in either role.
   Mansfield retired as ambassador at the end of last year,
returned to Washington, and went back to work. He now is a
consultant to the investment banking firm Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. on
matters involving Japan and other nations of east Asia.
   ``It involves no lobbying,'' said the former senator from
Montana, accentuating the negative. Mansfield said he provides
information and advice on political, economic and strategic matters
in the Far East, his specialty as historian, politician and
diplomat for more than 50 years.
   He says it is a perfect assignment because he is doing what he'd
be doing anyhow, maintaining his contacts and continuing his
research on the region that has been his specialty since he first
saw east Asia as a Marine in the 1920s.
   Looking at the Senate he left a dozen years ago, Mansfield sees
all too many lobbyists, too much pressure to raise funds for
increasingly costly campaigns, too many staff members. The number
of congressional staffers has nearly tripled since his leadership
days.
   Mansfield was elected to the House from Montana in 1942, and to
the Senate in 1952. He became majority leader in 1961 and retired
from the Senate in 1977.
   He said he left because a senator had to wear so many hats, deal
with so many issues and pressures. ``They're under far greater
pressure now,'' he said in an interview, ``and their privacy is a
fading memory.''
   He also sees the Senate of 1989 as a more contentious place,
recalling a time of greater comradeship transcending political
differences. ``It seems to have dissipated and that, I think, is
tragic,'' he said.
   The former majority leader said he seldom visits his old haunts
because the welcome mat is thin, and properly so. He said the first
time a retired senator comes back, his former colleagues are
delighted. The second time, they are polite. ``The third time they
wonder what the hell you're doing there.''
   Mansfield said one thing he liked about serving as ambassador
was that the issues were better defined than for a senator, and
fewer in number. He said the major ones on his agenda in Tokyo were
mutual defense and trade. Mansfield said defense relations are in
sound shape now, but trade remains a difficult issue.
   It's one on which he differs with some of his Democratic
successors in Congress. Mansfield warns at every opportunity
against protectionist trade measures, saying they would be
counterproductive in the long term.
   That message was constant during his time as ambassador, an era
when Japanese exports soared along with the U.S. trade deficit.
Mansfield insists that U.S. trade with Japan should be based upon
free enterprise tenets, and that the better competitor should get
the business.
   Mansfield advocates a free trade treaty with Japan, to open the
markets of each nation to the other. Neither Washington nor Tokyo
is moving for such an accord, but Mansfield keeps at it in his new
role.
   ``Bits and pieces trade policies can lead to retaliation if
carried too far,'' he said. ``Protectionism is not the answer.'' It
might mean more jobs in the short term, but in the long run it
would cost jobs, fuel inflation and risk trade retaliation,
Mansfield said.
   As ambassador, Mansfield sometimes was criticized on grounds he
was too accommodating toward the Japanese on trade questions. But
his warnings against protectionism were addressed to both sides. He
told the Japanese that they would heighten the risk of retaliatory,
protectionist measures unless they opened their own markets and
pulled down trade barriers.
   Mansfield says that Japan has moved in that direction.
   ``We're becoming more interlocked and integrated,'' he said.
``You've got a lot of American investment in Japan. You're going to
have a lot more.''

<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scathing portrait of the late Cary Grant has
hit bookstores under the title, ``The Lonely Heart.''
   The book's name is taken from one of the actor's 72 feature
films, ``None But the Lonely Heart,'' but another Grant movie might
provide a more appropriate title: ``The Awful Truth.''
   Written by Charles Higham, author of biographies on Marlon
Brando and Katharine Hepburn, and Roy Moseley, who has written
about Merle Oberon and Rex Harrison, ``The Lonely Heart'' talks
about the star's numerous homosexual affairs, stormy marraiges and
battles on film sets with directors and fellow actors.
   The book alleges that Grant, whose real name was Archibald
Leach, was born out of wedlock to a Jewish woman, secretly acted as
an agent for several Hollywood stars and worked for British
Intelligence during World War II. ``The Lonely Heart'' also repeats
the story of his admitted use of LSD.
   Even the book's index provides unflattering coverage. A quick
check under ``Grant, Cary'' lists headings for the following: ``as
liar,'' ``his nose,'' ``stinginess,'' ``showing his age'' and
``faked suicide attempt.'' Under the heading ``homosexuality,'' the
book urges readers to ``see also bisexuality of.''
   Grant, whose movies include ``His Girl Friday,'' ``To Catch a
Thief,'' ``North by Northwest'' and ``Gunga Din,'' died in 1986 at
the age of 82.
   Despite the trashing Grant receives, the authors do praise his
acting skills and present many fond reminiscences from old friends.
``Cary Grant, despite his many very human failings, did his best to
be a good and decent man,'' the authors conclude in a preface.
   ``It really is not a muckraking book,'' Higham said in an
interview. ``Nor is it a fan book. I try to balance everything. I
see my biographies of stars as a continuing social history told
through biography. I suppose people will look back on this age and
say, `What were they like? Who were these people?'''
   Moseley and Higham draw on interviews with several dozen people
for ``The Lonely Heart,'' including Hepburn, who co-starred with
Grant in four films, Marlene Dietrich and Virginia Cherrill, the
actor's first wife.
   Grant's life is shown beginning with his birth in Bristol,
England, in 1904, up to the very last hours before his fatal stroke.
   Higham, who met Grant on several occasions, says he was
fascinated by the differences between the star's public and private
behavior. ``I had been raised where people who were gracious and
polite, really were gracious and polite; they didn't have two
personalities,'' the London-born author said. ``I think the
contrast between the violence and tension in private, and the utter
charm with a reporter that made me realize many celebrities had
enormous conflicts, even schizophrenia.
   Grant's conflicts seem to have begun at birth. His father, Elias
Leach, was a suit presser who had several girlfriends. ``The Lonely
Heart'' reports that although both Elias Leach and his wife, Elsie,
were gentiles, they had the infant circumcised, a traditional
Jewish custom. Grant would later make generous donations to Israel
in honor of his ``dead Jewish mother.''
   The young Archibald Leach quickly displayed exceptional athletic
ability and was just in his mid-teens when he joined the Pender
Troupe, a traveling company of acrobats. In the early 1930s, Leach
headed for Hollywood, where he had a contract with Paramount
Pictures, and quickly was renamed ``Cary Grant.'' The first name
derived from Cary Lockwood, a character he played in a stage show.
The last name was chosen by studio publicists.
   Rumors of Grant's homosexual relationships surfaced quickly.
Higham recalled a conversation he had in the '60s with Dietrich,
who starred in ``Blonde Venus,'' one of Grant's first films:
   ``One night we were at dinner and I asked her about `Blonde
Venus' and whether she had had any off-screen relationship with
Cary Grant. She responded, `Oh no, that was out of the question
becuase he was homosexual.' It was simply a given, it was
understood to be the case.''
   In 1932, Grant met Cherrill, an actress who portrayed the blind
girl in Charlie Chaplin's classic ``City Lights,'' and married her
in 1934. By all accounts, they were an unhappy couple with Grant
given to furious temper tantrums and even physical violence. They
were divorced the following year. Grant would marry four more
times, and had one child, Jennifer, with the actress Dyan Cannon,
his fourth wife.
   By 1937, Grant's work in ``Topper'' and ``The Awful Truth'' had
made him one of Hollywood's most popular leading men. His good
looks, lilting English accent and quick wit were the perfect
ingredients for light, romantic comedies. Grant would go on to
appear opposite some of the world's most beautiful actresses,
including Grace Kelly, Ingrid Bergman and Sophia Loren. He was
still a major box-office draw when he retired in 1966.
   But while his screen image was carefree and charming, Higham and
Moseley write that he was privately tormented by conflicting sexual
desires and insecurity over his success.
   ``On the screen there is no one more relaxed, more dapper,
seeminginly more cool,'' Higham said. ``Yet this was achieved at
considerably more cost. It interests me that some people would
rather not know this.''
   According to Higham and Moseley, Grant secretly went into
business in the mid-'30s with an old friend, Frank Vincent. Along
with film agent Harry Edington, they operated a firm whose
clientele included Dietrich and Rita Hayworth.
   ``I think one of the most surprising things was that he was a
Hollywood agent,'' Higham said. ``He was picking up a percentage of
a percentage. Frank Vincent had become a very powerful agent. He
was running around, getting people deals.''
   Higham said curiosity was his main reason for doing the book.
   ``I got to know him on a very superficial social level,'' the
author said. ``I found him very interesting but very aloof. I hoped
the book would be a solution to a mystery. I saw him as a puzzling
mystery around whom many others flew.''

<HEAD>Study Disputes Psychiatric Assumption Linking Religion To Problems</HEAD>

   Psychiatrists rarely examine their patients'
religion objectively, tending to assume it only indicates problems,
a new study says. But it finds the negative assumptions don't hold
up when tested.
   ``Patients with major depresssion and anxiety disorders
contained the lowest percentage of believers in God,'' the study
says.``At the very least, we can say that depresssion is not
correlated with greater religiousness.''
   The researchers urge more even-handed studies in this area,
citing evidence of the importance of religion to most people, and
pointing out that psychiatry generally has not considered the
religious factor.
   ``That aspect has been largely ignored,'' says psychiatrist
Jerome Kroll of the University of Minnesota. ``But things are
beginning to change, not to a great degree, but slowly.''
   Kroll and an associate psychiatrist, William Sheehan, recently
completed a study pointing up the relative disregard of religion by
mental health specialists compared to patients and people generally.
   ``We've been overlooking an important factor,'' Kroll said in a
telephone interview. ``A lot of our patients believe in God and are
interested in the church, but they aren't even asked about it.
   ``It's often a source of strength and help to them.''
   In the American Journal of Psychiatry, Kroll and Sheehan cite
surveys finding that 95 percent of the general public profess
belief in God, compared to 55 percent of psychiatrists and 43
percent of psychologists.
   The two also cite a 1986 review that found only 59 or 2.5
percent of 2,348 psychiatric articles included religion in their
quantitative data about cases. The report adds:
   ``Belief in God and in the teachings of the Bible, the sense of
an afterlife, and social and personal involvement within a church
community are relevant dimensions of our patients lives that
certainly deserve more consideration than the psychiatric
profession has customarily provided.''
   Kroll said that while psychiatrists generally have ignored
religion as a relevant factor in their patients' condition, they
often have automatically blamed it for excessive guilt.
   In psychiatry, ``it has long been thought and believed that
religion brings out unhealthy aspects in people and contributed to
depression and other mental illness,'' he said. ``Our indications
is that this is not so.''
   He and Sheehan, in their study, examined religious beliefs,
practices and involvement of 52 psychiatric patients at the
University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinic.
   Their rate of belief in major tenets of faith was found to be
high, but ``patients with major depression and anxiety disorders
contained the lowest percentage of believers in God,'' the report
says.
   This is ``contrary to expectations'' that depressive patients
feel ``excessive guilt and blameworthiness'' and that ``anger and
guilt'' underlies depression, the report says.
   ``Our depressed patients, along with the patients with anxiety
disorder, were the least religiously oriented disagnostic group,''
the report says, while all those with disorders not associated with
guilt believed in God.
   Kroll, in the interview, noted the sampling was limited, but
added:
   `Often guilt is thought to be religiously inspired. This
indicates that is not so. Religion has been held to be the culprit
by some psychiatrists, but there is no evidence of it.
   ``We're saying it's not so.
   ``We're saying that the role of guilt in depression is
overemphasized and is not borne out by the facts. The thinking has
been that anger and guilt underlie depression. But when you look
for the guilt it's not there.''
   Kroll, 52, is Jewish, and while Sheehan, about 30, is Roman
Catholic. Kroll said that psychiatry developed its antagonism to
religion under the Freudian influences of the 1940's and l950's.
   ``Traditionally psychiatrists and psychologists have not paid
much attention to the religious part of life,'' he said. ``They
hardly ever mentioned it.''
   But he said attitudes began changing in the 1970's, not much on
the East Coast, but more so elsewhere, as indicated by increasing
pastoral counsellors in hospitals and the presence of clergy in
psychiatric wards.
   ``Clergy are being used more in psychiatry,'' he said. ``There's
a coming together of resources in a way that didn't used to be the
case. It's increasing.
   ``There's a greater awareness that science just doesn't answer
all of life's problems.''
   He said disagreement still exists in psychiatry about whether
religion is helpful or hurtful to mental health, with both sides
presenting evidence for their case. He added:.
   ``Most pscyhiatrists tend to take a neutral viewpoint, and not
to pay to much attention to it at all. That's why they've skipped
over it, and haven't appreciated how important it was.''

   Mennonites are seeking to develop 500 new
religious congregations by 1995. Officials say it is their first
effort to reach beyond their Dutch origins to people who are
``unchurched.''
   ``Our goal is to build a new identity as Mennonites, as being
more open, receptive, warm,'' said the Rev. Regan W. Savage.
   Mennonites are the descendants of the German-speaking religious
rebels who were among the first Pennsylvania settlers.
   ``Some children of Mennonite families have been going out the
back door while new people have been coming in the front door,''
said Luke Beidler, a Mennonite official. He says the church wants
``not only to invite new people in, but to close the back door.''
   The program, called Vision 95, was launched in 1985. According
to the Mennonite Board of Missions, based in Elkhart, Ind., 46 new
congregations have been added since 1985. There are now 1,296
congregations, with membership totalling about 100,000.

   Concluding a lengthy Vatican inquiry into
Roman Catholic religious orders in this country, Pope John Paul II
says they are mostly rendering ``outstanding service.''
   In a letter to U.S. bishops made public last week, the pope said
the evaluation of religious communities carried out between 1983 to
1986 had been largely positive. He wrote:
   ``Please thank them in my name and in your name, in the name of
Jesus Christ and the church.''
   The Vatican-named commission that carried out the inquiry was

   Its work has ``proved to be informative and beneficial both to

   A group of middle-class men, concerned that
friends were dying and nothing was being done, met in Greenwich
Village eight years ago.
   They called themselves Gay Men's Health Crisis. They had little
money and less clout; there was no name for the disease that
brought them together.
   Today, Gay Men's Health Crisis has a $10 million budget, its own
six-story Manhattan building and 2,000 volunteers, and the disease
has a name: acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   After years of hectoring politicians and public health officials
to address the problems of people with AIDS, GMHC and its cohorts
are themselves being challenged to cope with the changing face of
that population.
   Nationwide, more than 87,000 cases of AIDS have been reported,
about two-thirds of them among homosexual or bisexual men. But in
many cities, especially along the East Coast, someone diagnosed
with AIDS today is about as likely to have become infected by
shooting up with dirty needles as through sex.
   In New York City, intravenous drug abusers comprised an
estimated 45 percent of all newly reported AIDS cases last year.
``These projections bear out what we have long known, that the
spread of AIDS is fueled by drugs (and) that AIDS is accelerating
its onslaught upon poor, drug-ravaged neighborhoods and minority
communities,'' said city Health Commissioner Stephen Joseph.
   In New Jersey, IV drug abusers comprised 59 percent of new AIDS
cases.
   What this means to AIDS-service providers is only now being
addressed.
   San Francisco, with the most people with AIDS per capita of any
U.S. city, wins praise from all quarters for its response to the
epidemic.
   Its Shanti Project, a peer-counseling group for the terminally
ill, had one staffer in 1982 and was nearly defunct. Now it has a
$3 million budget and a paid staff of 70, directing counseling
groups and a housing program geared toward independent living for
people with AIDS.
   But Greg Day, Shanti's education director, notes that about 96
percent of AIDS cases in the city are among gay males ``who used to
lead relatively normal lives,'' were employed full time and have a
firmer footing in society.
   ``I think that because the impact of AIDS has been primarily,
overwhelmingly, on the gay community thus far, we have succeeded so
far in developing our resources along with the epidemic,'' he said.
``We don't have the answers yet on how to best serve the IV
drug-user population.''
   The situation is similar in Los Angeles, Seattle, Minneapolis,
and other cities where the number of IV drug users is relatively
small, experts say.
   In Chicago, things are more difficult.
   ``What we're dealing with here in Chicago, particularly when
we're dealing with the issue of homelessness and destitution, is
not the gay community, but blacks, minorities, IV drug users,
prostitutes and their families _ people of the streets basically,''
said Al Mascia of Travelers and Immigrants Aid, a private group
that helps house homeless people with AIDS.
   ``While we want to adopt some of the programs or utilize some of
the models that San Francisco has, we're talking about working with
a different population for the most part,'' Mascia said.
   Part of the problem is that an IV drug user does not
automatically kick the habit when diagnosed with AIDS. But most
AIDS organizations require infected drug abusers to enter treatment
before they are accepted as clients.
   ``It's fine for us to deal with you as someone with ARC
(AIDS-related condition) or AIDS,'' said Tim Sweeney, GMHC deputy
director for policy. ``But the truth is if you're just leaving our
front door and going out and sticking another needle in your arm,
we're really not doing you any big favor.
   ``You've got two illnesses to be dealt with.''
   Programs such as GMHC and the Shanti Project depend on
volunteers, but Sweeney said, ``We are finding now that ... the
volunteer model really doesn't work with them. They need much more
direct, intense case management, much more involvement, usually by
a professional staff person to help them set up the structure of
their life, so that they're independent.''
   The drug abuser also is more likely to be homeless, yet shelters
are no place for someone infected with AIDS. Several cities run
apartments for people with AIDS capable of independent living, but
demand far outstrips supply.
   People with AIDS who no longer need hospitalization but have no
place to go often are sent to single-room-occupancy hotels, where
they have no medical supervision and must contend with seedy
surroundings and crime.
   Many are ``discharged from the hospital and can sit on the bench
out front,'' said Larry Ellis of Lifelink, a Washington-based AIDS
organization.
   In New York, a lucky few find room in the highly praised,
privately run Bailey House, the city's only supervised AIDS
residence. It opened in 1986 with rooms for 44 people and hopes to
add nine more rooms by the summer of 1990.
   For Lawrence Conklin, 38, a 20-year heroin and cocaine addict
diagnosed with AIDS about two years ago, a clean, nicely furnished
room at Bailey House and a treatment program ``was the only thing
that saved me.''

   The publisher of TV Guide, Valerie B. Salembier,
has been named president of the New York Post, Post owner Peter S.
Kalikow said Wednesday.
   Peter Price quit as publisher to become a partner in an
international television and radio company, Kalikow said Monday.
Kalikow, who bought the money-losing paper a year ago from Rupert
Murdoch, noted that during Price's tenure the paper added a Sunday
edition.
   Ms. Salembier, a former senior vice president of advertising at
USA Today, will assume Price's responsibilities, said Emory
Edwards, a spokesman for the Post. She will supervise business,
advertising and circulation.
   Ms. Salembier takes over Kalikow's former title of president,
while Kalikow assumes the title of publisher and retains his
position as chairman of the board, Edwards said.
   Ms. Salembier, 43, became publisher of TV Guide in October when
the magazine was acquired by the News Corporation of America.
   ``I am thrilled with the opportunity to go back into the daily
newspaper business,'' Ms. Salembier said in a statement. ``The
potential for growth at the Post is terrific, and it's the perfect
vehicle for a great many new advertisers.''

<TEXT>
   The 1989 Cadillac Fleetwood Sedan offers a sedate way to travel
_ in a big way.
   Passengers can relax on tufted seats in a roomy interior. Any
jostles or bumps from the road are carefully cushioned. Even the
impressive, 4.5-liter V8 pours on the power without throwing you
abruptly back in the seats.
   Mostly, this car is huge. It's like having your whole living
room in the back seat.
   For 1989, General Motors Corp.'s Cadillac division added nine
inches to the length of the Fleetwood Sedan and its sister car, the
De Ville, and another three inches to the cars' wheelbase.
   The exterior styling also accentuates the large size. Subtle
tailfins make the Fleetwood look similar to the big Cadillacs of
earlier days. The new Fleetwood also has full rear-wheel fender
skirts.
   Why the change? Big is better with buyers.
   After the De Ville and Fleetwood were downsized in the 1984
model year, many buyers and critics blasted the new models and
sales suffered. With the new, bigger Fleetwood and De Villes out,
Cadillac reports model-year sales of the cars up more than 26
percent _ to more than 71,500 through early this year compared with
year-ago sales of more than 56,700.
   Cadlac projects full model-year sales to rise between 11
percent and 15 percent over 1988 model sales of 148,398. ite
the size, however, the 1989 Fleetwood Sedan
surprisingly easy to handle. I didn't have much
in its lane, even on windy roaonic Teves
anti-lock brakes helped slow this big auto down safely, even on
rain-slicked streets.
   The engine, coupled with four-speed automatic overdrive
transmission, performed well and provided a smooth ride. The
computer-controlled transaxle waspecially set so there would be
ting, Cadillac said.
   The company also notedat the car can go from 0 to 60 man 10 seconds.
But the engine sure swigged down the gasoline
in city driving. I of fuel, according to the
on-bmputer, making just a couple 6-m made more efficient use of fuel, as
expected, on the
highway and officially, t Fleetwood Sedan is
17 mpg in the city and 25 on the highway. If you're paying one of these
cars, the price of gasoline may not be a big
worry.
   Inside the Fleetwood Sedan, there were pleasant surprisestouches. Lighted
vanity mirrors popped out of the ceiling for
rear-seat passengers. Front-seat occupants had thn the back of the sun
visors. Floor mats were reversible
and machine washable _ the short nap on one side was for sloppy
winter weather, with  the other side ideal for
less-dirty times of the year.
   Thure brakes lights and blinkers worked
because of small monitor lights above the red
monitor lights would blink and light up in conjunction with the
brake lights and blinkers. Likewise, there were small light
monitors on the front hood that indicated ife on.
   The t also had some options that tookings
automatically: an automatic rear-view mirror that adjusted to
headlights (an $80 option), a six-way memory driver seat (a $235
option) and door locks that automatically locked when the car was
shifted out of park (a $185 option).
   Needless to say, there was plenty of legroom, hip room, and head
room in this car in the front seats and ininess is what
this car is all about. The trunk, with 18.4-cubicf space
compared with 16 cubic feet in last year's model, was mnctive in today's
market where smaller cars dominate.
   Cadillac says compet
is both wider and longer than the Fleetwood by a few inches and
starts at more than $25,500 _ and the Lincoln Continental, which is
about the same length andidth as the Fleetwood and starts at more
than $28,000.
   Cadspokesman Kyle Johnson said the company has only
demographics of early buyers. He said buyers range in age fromwith an average
income of $50,000.
   In the past, about 70 pe buyers have been men. Since
the 1989 Fleetwood is newly restyl no owner complaint
data at Consumer Reports. However, 1986-model front-drive
Fleetwoods ranked average in the magazine's trouble index, while
1987-model front-drive Fleetwoods ranked worse than average.

   Here are sales results for the eight major U.S.
automakers for the third period of March 1989.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were 10 selling days in the period this year and 10 selling
days last year.
   For the month, there were 27 selling days this year and 27
selling days last year, and for the year so far, 76 selling days
this year and 77 selling days last year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and appear in
this table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign. Some foreign automakers said
they would not report March sales figures until Wednesday.

<HEAD>GM Tops Latest Fortune 500 List, Ford Takes Over No. 2 Spot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrial America enjoyed a banner year in
terms of profits and sales during 1988 as the economy expanded for
the sixth consecutive year, Fortune magazine noted in its latest
ranking of the 500 largest U.S. manufacturing companies.
   ``Any way you cut it, last year was the most prosperous for the
500 since Fortune published the first 500 directory in 1955,''
Fortune said in its April 24 issue, released to the news media
Tuesday and available on newsstands today.
   ``Demand continued to surge and factories and refineries
operated near capacity.''
   The magazine said sales by the Fortune 500 last year topped $2
trillion for the first time, while total profits for the group
jumped 27 percent to a record $115 billion.
   The Big Three automakers had especially strong revenue last
year, with General Motors Corp. again topping the Fortune 500 and
Ford Motor Co. bumping Exxon Corp. from the No. 2 spot. Chrysler
Corp. jumped to No. 7 from No. 10.
   Companies involved in acquisitions also moved higher. Philip
Morris Cos. took the No. 10 spot, up from 12th last year, partly
due to its acquisition of Kraft Corp., ranked 31st in 1987. Eastman
Kodak Co. jumped to No. 18 from No. 25 with the acquisition of
Sterling Drug Inc., ranked 174 the previous year.
   The magazine ranks companies in terms of annual sales. It also
publishes a list later in the year of the top 500 U.S. service
companies.
   The top 10 after GM and Ford were: Exxon, International Business
Machines Corp., General Electric Co., Mobil Corp., Chrysler, Texaco
Inc., E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., and Philip Morris.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., ranked 8th in the 1987
listing, was bumped from the 1988 list because most of its revenue
was generated from the service sector. ITT Corp., ranked No. 45 in
1987, also fell into that category. The highest-ranking newcomer to
the 500 list was Unilever U.S., owned by the British-Dutch consumer
products giant Unilever, which debuted at No. 63,
   Coincidentally, all companies on the list this year had at least
$500 million in sales. The 500th company, Chemed Corp. of
Cincinnati, had sales of $500.6 million.
   But measured in constant, inflation-adjusted 1982 dollars,
Chemed's sales were about $100 million less than the 1974 sales of
Tyler Corp., the record holder as the largest 500th company ever.
   The magazine said nearly all of the 27 industrial categories
contained in its list had double-digit earnings growth in 1988, led
by metal companies, which showed a 100 percent jump, boosted by
soaring copper prices and the steel industry's successful
restructuring.
   Fortune said some of the profit increases were due to accounting
changes requiring companies to consolidate results of their
majority-owned subsidiaries.
   Large oil refiners posted a 63 percent increase in profits,
benefiting from what Fortune called ``a double-dose of luck; OPEC
squabbling drove crude oil prices down, lowering costs, while
demand strengthened, increasing prices.''
   No. 31 Phillips Petroleum Co. profited most by those
circumstances as earnings jumped 18-fold.
   Pennzoil Corp., ranked No. 201, was the biggest profit gainer
among the 500, with a 30-fold rise in earnings. But the company
owed most of that bounty to an extraordinary gain from its
celebrated $3 billion lawsuit settlement with Texaco.
   Hanna (M.A.) Co., a chemicals and energy concern, had the
biggest increase in sales, a 122 percent jump.
   The only two industry groups with declining profits in 1988 were
apparel companies, which suffered a 3 percent drop, and building
materials concerns, which lost 18 percent as housing starts
declined for the second straight year in 1988.
   No. 460 Maxus Energy Corp. had the biggest drop in sales,
suffering a 53 percent decline, due to a restructuring.
   Maxus, the renamed Diamond Shamrock Corp., spun off its oil
refining and marketing operations as Diamond Shamrock R&amp;M Inc.,
with Maxus retaining the exploration and production business.
   Geographically, New York is home to the greatest number of
Fortune 500 companies _ 48, down from 51 the previous year. Chicago
repeated as No. 2 with 22, down from 24 the year before, and Dallas
was No. 3 with 15, up from 12.
   The rest of the top 10 were: Houston, 13, up from 12;
Pittsburgh, 12, down from 15; Cleveland, 11, down from 12; Atlanta
and Minneapolis tied for seventh with 10 each, the same as last
year; and St. Louis and Stamford, Conn., tied for ninth with nine,
down from 10 last year.

<HEAD>Pepsi Drops Ads Featuring Madonna After Video Creates Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An uproar over the religious imagery in
Madonna's ``Like a Prayer'' music video has doomed the
entertainer's Pepsi commercials.
   Pepsi-Cola Co. confirmed Tuesday it is dropping the ads even
though the soft drink maker had no connection with the music video,
which some groups found sacrilegious.
   Pepsi's decision is similar to a recent series of incidents in
which corporations have bowed to pressure from consumers and
religious activists over corporate sponsorship of programs the
critics deem objectionable.
   Spokesman Tod MacKenzie said Pepsi heard from consumers who
complained about the music video because they thought it was
Pepsi's commercial. Both the commercial and the video featured the
same Madonna song, ``Like A Prayer.''
   ``It's an unfortunate situation,'' he said.
   Marty Blackman, head of a New York-based consulting firm that
advises businesses on the use of celebrities, said Pepsi should
have known Madonna would prove controversial.
   ``This was a personality controversial enough that you know you
have to do your homework, your research and it wasn't done,'' he
said.
   But Jesse Meyers, who publishes Beverage Digest in Greenwich,
Conn., said he found it sad that any group can ``dictate to a
consumer goods company what they can and can't do.''
   The Pepsi commercial featuring Madonna was run only twice in the
United States in early March.
   The ad, which featured the first public airing of her song
``Like a Prayer,'' made its debut March 2 in 40 countries. It ran a
second time in the U.S. on a late-night show March 3 and continues
to run overseas, where there have been no complaints of confusion
of the ad and the video, MacKenzie said.
   Pepsi had planned to cut the two-minute ad into shorter versions
for replay here after Madonna's song built a following.
   But in scrapping those plans, Pepsi joined several companies
that have altered advertising plans after consumers blamed
advertisers for the moral content of broadcasts.
   Ralston Purina Co., Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Tambrands Inc. and
others recently either have cancelled ads or instructed their ad
agencies not to buy more time on shows after consumers objected to
the programs' content. Two shows in particular that prompted
protests are NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' and Fox Broadcasting
Network's ``Married ... With Children.''
   The trend has alarmed some constitutional rights advocates, who
say advertisers are opening the door to even more activism by
self-styled moral advocates and to self-censorship by programmers
who may want to avoid a fight.
   But Pepsi's case is somewhat unique because it was blamed for
something it did not produce.
   The Pepsi ad featuring Madonna, titled ``Make a Wish,'' showed
the singer posing as a woman watching an old home movie of her
eighth birthday party.
   The woman and the child traded places in the commercial, with
Madonna singing ``Like a Prayer'' and dancing in school and in a
church while the youngster browsed through the woman's apartment.
   Pepsi said it created the ad without ever seeing the music video
that accompanied the release of the ``Like a Prayer'' single.
   The music video, released a day after the ad ran, showed a woman
assisting a man wrongly accused of a crime. Madonna kisses a statue
that comes to life, dances among burning crosses and is afflicted
with cuts on her hand resembling the wounds Christians believe
Jesus Christ suffered during crucifixion.
   A Mississippi-based religious group, the American Family
Association, and the bishop of Corpus Christi, Texas, separately
called for one-year boycotts of Pepsi products because of the
video's imagery.
   Both boycotts were called off last week after Pepsi officials
told the bishop and the AFA it planned to discontinue using the
singer in its ads.
   The Rev. Donald Wildmon of the AFA said Pepsi also planned to
withdraw its sponsorship of a Madonna concert tour, but Pepsi had
no comment on that. Pepsi reportedly paid Madonna about $5 million
under a one-year contract that included commercials and the tour.
   Liz Rosenberg, a publicist for Madonna at Warner Bros. Records,
said the singer had no comment on Pepsi's action.

   The ``Predators Ball'' begins
today, but the life of the party isn't around.
   Michael Milken, top junk bond trader for Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., can't be at the annual event the company calls the
Institutional Research Conference, which attracts a who's who of
corporate takeover artists.
   Milken, who was charged last week with 98 counts of securities
fraud and racketeering in connection with alleged trading
violations, is officially on leave from his job as Drexel's junk
bond guru.
   The Predators Ball, actually a 3{-day conference on high-yield
bond financing and finance in general, was scheduled to open early
today at the Beverly Hilton Hotel with a talk by Jaime Escalante,
the high-school math teacher whose success with underpriveleged
students was the basis of the movie ``Stand and Deliver.''
   John H. Kissick, Milken's successor as head of Drexel's
high-yield bond unit in Beverly Hills, planned a get-acquainted
talk at the early-morning session.
   Despite his absence, Milken's image looms large over the meeting.
   ``He was omnipresent,'' said Clark Johnson, chairman and chief
executive of Pier 1 Imports Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, a
participant. ``You saw him around and of course he was running the
show. He was having meetings. He was doing deals. He was being his
usual energetic, indefatigable self.''
   Even without its guiding light, the meeting is a unique
convention of American entrepreneurs who have built or bought
companies with junk bonds, Johnson said.
   ``You always come away re-energized, with a lot of new ideas,''
Johnson said in a telephone interview before the meeting. ``These
have been the growth companies, the companies that are doing
things, the companies that are rebuilding corporate America.''
   Drexel is downplaying Milken's absence from the conference, much
as it is working to assure investors the firm can remain a prime
mover in the high-yield bond market without him.
   The conference is the most heavily attended yet, said Drexel
spokesman Steve Anreder, who emphasized the varied schedule of
sessions on subjects ranging from Third World debt to employee
stock plans to the savings and loan industry.
   ``I think what that says is the high-yield market has been
validated and there's a lot of interest,'' the spokesman said.
   Milken is credited with building the multibillion-dollar market
in junk bonds, the high-risk, high-interest bonds used by
entrepreneurs and corporate takeover artists to raise cash.
   In addition to popularizing use of the bonds _ dubbed ``junk''
because they receive lower than investment-grade ratings from
bond-rating agencies _ Milken was at the center of a newtork of
traders who both sold bonds for their own projects and could be
tapped to invest in junk bonds sold by others.

<HEAD>Incentives Test Under Way As Car Sales Drop</HEAD>

   U.S. automakers' new incentive packages are
getting a big test in the midst of the traditional spring
car-buying season as sales continued lower than expected, down 18.3
percent in late March compared with last year.
   ``They (carmakers) have got to be a little bit nervous,''
analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York
said Tuesday after the sales figures were reported.
   Vehicles sold at an average daily rate of 42,451 in the March
21-31 period this year, compared with a 51,960 daily rate during
the same time last year. Car sales were off 18.1 percent and light
truck sales were 18.7 percent behind last year.
   ``There's no question that the consumers may be cinching up
their belts a little bit,'' Phillippi said. ``It could be a tough
go here in the month of April. April is absolutely critical.''
   In years past, car shoppers flocked to showrooms in March and
April to get ready for the summertime driving season. But the
figures reported Tuesday showed there was some hesitation.
   During March, cars and light trucks made in both North America
and overseas sold at an average daily rate of 47,848 vehicles, down
12.6 percent from the 54,756 daily rate during March 1988, when the
industry was establishing the second-best sales year in history.
   ``Normally, the month of March is a very critical month for
determining the kickoff of the spring selling season,'' Phillippi
said. ``We didn't have a kickoff.''
   Sales manager Ham Klosterman of Lamar Ferrell Chevrolet in
Decatur, Ga., outside Atlanta, said March sales were better than
February's. But that, he added, ``isn't saying a whole heck of a
lot.''
   ``If it hadn't been for the last five to seven days of March, it
would have been a disaster,'' Klosterman said, noting that
consumers were pushed toward showrooms by a 1 percentage point
increase in the Georgia sales tax effective April 1.
   Automakers themselves gave a good indication of their concern
during the past week by offering new incentive packages that
included more vehicles than previous programs, boosted some cash
rebates and slashed interest rates as low as zero percent at
Chrysler and 2.9 percent at Ford and GM on two-year loans.
   ``I guess the key is that everybody was still sort of getting
their incentive programs into place (in late March), and a lot of
buyers were hanging back to wait and see what would happen,''
Phillippi said.
   There was a question about how long car buyers would hold back,
especially those who have been hit by increased mortgage payments
and other higher monthly bills because of climbing interest rates.
   ``If the zeros and the 2.9s don't work, then we're in deep
trouble,'' Phillippi said.
   Chrysler's late March car sales fell to an average daily rate of
3,544, 26.4 percent lower than the 4,813 car-a-day rate during the
period last year. Chrysler said it sold 21.6 percent fewer cars
through March 31 this year compared with the same time last year.
   Chrysler's truck sales during late March were 19.8 percent
behind last year's rate, but for the year were up 0.7 percent.
   GM reported a 23.9 percent decline in late March car sales,
dropping to a daily rate of 12,159 during the period this year
compared with a rate of 15,973 cars during the same time last year.
For the first three months of 1989, GM's car sales were running
14.6 percent behind last year's pace during the same time.
   Sales of GM's light trucks fell 18.2 percent during the March
21-31 period this year, and were down 6.6 during January-March.
   Ford said its sales of North American-made cars averaged 8,077 a
day during late March, compared with a rate of 9,359 in late March
1988, a decline of 13.7 percent. For the year, Ford's car sales
were down 4.1 percent.
   Sales of light trucks made by Ford were off 23.8 percent in late
March this year, and down 5.8 percent for the first quarter,
compared with the same periods in 1988.

<HEAD>Protecting Computers From Hackers Crucial To Doing Business, Experts
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The legal system has failed to respond adequately
to the threat that computer hackers pose to the computer networks
that are crucial to corporate America, a computer expert says.
   Many computer hackers ``are given slaps on the wrist,'' Mark
Leary, a senior analyst with International Data Corp., said at a
Tuesday roundtable discussion.
   ``The justice system has to step up ... to the fact that these
people are malicious and are criminals and are robbing banks just
as much as if they walked up with a shotgun,'' he said.
   Other panelists complained that hackers, because of their
abilities at breaking into computer system, are even given jobs,
sometimes as security consultants.
   The experts spoke at a roundtable sponsored by Network World
magazine, a publication targeted at computer network users and
managers.
   Compr networks have become crucial to business, fromnd compiling information
to overseeing and running
manufacturing processes.
   The public alss increasingly exposed to networks through such
devices as automatic teller machines at banks, airline reservation
systems and company computers that store billing information.
   Companies became more willing to spend money on computer
security after last year's celebrated invasion of a nationwide
computer network by a computer virus allegedly unleashed by araduate student,
the experts said.
   ``The incident caused us to reassess the priorities with which
we look at certain threats,'' said Dennis Steinaur, manager of the
compcurity management group of the National InstitutTechnology.
   But computer security is not only a matter of gagainst
unauthorized entry, according to Max Hoe president
for information systems at American Airlines.
   Hopper said American has built ``a Cheyenne Moun
installation for its computer systems to guard against a varietf
problems, including electrical failure and natural disaster.g to the Defense
Department's underground nerve center
inside aColorado mountain, he said American's precautione a three-day supply
of food.
   ``We've done everything we caect the total
environment,'' Hopper said.
   Hopper and Steinaur said that despite the high-tech image of
computer terrorism, it remains an administrative problem that
should be approached as a routine management issue.
   But the experts agreed that the greatest danger to computer
networks does not come from outside hackers. Instead, they said,
the biggesthreat is from disgruntled employees or others whose
original access to systems was legitimate.
   While screening of potential employees is uSteinaur said,
it is more important to build within computer systems ways to track
unauthorized use and to publicize that hacking can be found out and
traced.
   But Steinaur said growing computer literay, plus the activities
of some non-malicious hackers, help security managers in some
respects.
   Expanded knowledge ``forces us as security managers not to be
dependent on ignorance,'' S
   ``Security needs to be a part of the system, rather than a
`nuisance addition,''' Steinaur said, ``and we probably have not
done a very good job of making management realize that security is
an integral part of the system.''
   IDC's Leary said the organization's surveys of Fortune 1000
companies surprisingly found a signiumber of companies were
doing little to protect their systems.
   The discussion, the first of three planned by Network World, was
held because computer sabotage ``is a real problem that p
aren't aware of,'' said editor John Gallant. Many business people
believe sabotage cases ``are glamorous incidents that happen to
sophisticated networks.''
   Also, it is a problem that many industry vendors are reluctant
to address, he said, because it raises questions about a company's
reliability.
   ``Data can be restored, but it takes years to rebuild public
confidence,'' he said.
   Gallant said the magazine had tried and failed to get computors on
the discussion panels.
   ``They don't  in the public eye,'' he said. He
declined to say who turned doinvitations.

<HEAD>Paccar Says Little About Simmons' Stock-Buying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paccar Inc. officials said little Tuesday about
Texas financier Harold C. Simmons' interest in their company, but
stock analysts said they doubted Simmons was looking to take over
the truck manufacturing company.
   Jack McRae, spokesman for Paccar in suburban Bellevue, said,
``We knew he was purchasing stock,'' but declined to comment
further about Simmons' stock acquisition.
   Simmons' investor group, Valhi Inc., has bought a 5.3 percent
interest in Lockheed Corp. He also said in an interview with the
Wall Street Journal, published Tuesday, that he has received or
sought clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to buy at least
$15 million in stock in Paccar and a like amount in Chrysler Corp.
and Phelps Dodge Corp.
   Simmons said Monday he did not intend to take over Lockheed. He
declined to tell the Journal whether he would make an offer for the
other companies, but said his purchases ``all start out as
investments.''
   Paccar stock closed at $48.75 per share Tuesday, up $1.25.
   Paccar makes Kenworth, Peterbilt and Foden trucks, and owns
truck financing and leasing companies, Grand Auto and Al's Auto
Supply stores, oil pump manufacturer Trico Industries Inc., and
Wagner Mining Equipment Co.
   In 1988, Paccar earned a record $175.8 million on sales of $3.1
billion. Earnings were up 56 percent over 1987, while sales rose 28
percent.
   Paccar ``has a strong cash flow, a high cash position and very
little debt, so certainly that would make it more attractive on the
surface,'' said analyst Steven Colbert at Prudential Bache
Securities in San Francisco.
   Colbert noted that the founding Pigott family still holds a
strong position in the company, which would make a hostile takeover
difficult, and that the company has never expressed any interest in
going private.
   Les Childress, lyst with Harper, Mclean &amp; Co. in Seattle,
agreed that ``a hostile deal would be extremely diffult to do.''
   Childress said Paccar has an ar plan in place. In
addition, Paccar is a well-managed company that has tried to please
its shareholders, he said.
   Simmons ``likes to invest in very fundattractive
companies,'' and his SEC filing concerning Paccar ``seems to
indicate this is for investment purposes,'' Childress said.

<HEAD>Blue Arrow's Berry Out As Chairman, Replaced By Fromstein</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blue Arrow PLC said Wednesday that its chief
executive, Mitchell Fromstein, was appointed to replace company
founder Antony Berry as chairman, culminating a months-long feud
between the two men which has rocked the British employment agency.
   The move had been expected following a boardroom shuffle in
January that left Fromstein as chief executive and relieved Berry
of his executive role at the company he founded.
   The company also said Michael Davies, a non-executive director
since 1987, was made deputy chairman, replacing David Atkins, a
former Blue Arrow executive and long-standing ally of Berry's who
has been on the board since 1984. In addition, Gilbert Palay,
executive vice president of Blue Arrow's U.S. subsidiary, Manpower
Inc., was named to the board.
   The changes consolidate Fromstein's hold on Blue Arrow and
completes a stunning comeback for the former head of Manpower who
resigned his position on the Blue Arrow board in December in the
midst of the feud with Berry.
   Blue Arrow gained control of Manpower in a $1.34 billion
takeover battle in 1987. The takeover of the Milwaukee-based
employment agency tripled Blue Arrow's size and left an uneasy
alliance between the two companies' strong-willed chairmen.
   The company's troubles have spawned takeover rumors, and
Fromstein confirmed Monday that offers for the company had been
made but weren't considered serious.
   On Tuesday, Blue Arrow said Harris Associates L.P., a
Chicago-based investment consultancy, built up a 6.18 percent stake
in the company.

   AT&amp;T and its unions opened the year's largest
round of collective bargaining today, talking optimistically of
avoiding a third strike this decade but sparring immediately over
the company's finances.
   ``During these negotiations, AT&amp;T's financial future should not
be an excuse for evading a reasonable economic package for our
members,'' Jack Barry, president of the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers, said at a brief meeting with reporters prior
to the first day of contract talks.
   The IBEW is for the first time this year negotiating jointly
with the Communication Workers of America, whose president also
said it was time AT&amp;T workers got a bigger share of the company's
success.
   ``It is our members who are the most skilled people in the world
at their jobs, who have made AT&amp;T the industry leader,'' CWA
President Morton Bahr said.
   Robert E. Allen, board chairman of American Telephone and
Telegraph, was also on hand for the session, the first time an AT&amp;T
chiarman has attended the opening of the talks.
   ``We are up against a group of competitors who are tough and
getting tougher,'' Allen said. ``And most of them are not union
represented. In this process that starts today one thing we can
demonstrate is that a company that has a large representative
group, represented by unions, can be sufficiently flexible and
compete effectively in the marketplace.''
   That was a reference to job flexibility changes being sought by
AT&amp;T, which along with wages and health benefits are the major
differences between the two sides heading into the negotiations for
a three-year contract to replace a pact that expires May 27.
   ``I don't know when we've had more positive relationships going
into bargaining,'' said Ray Williams, the company's chief
representative at the table when formal talks on a new three-year
contract open today.
   When the two unions bargained separately three years ago, CWA
leaders accused the Electrical Workers of undermining their 26-day
strike by signing a ``me too'' agreement that kept IBEW members
working in AT&amp;T's factories.
   With a promise to the Electrical Workers they would share
whatever additional benefits the CWA won through the strike, AT&amp;T
was able to keep half of its manufacturing plants operating.
   The unions also are looking for stronger job security guarantees
after losing thousands of jobs to management and AT&amp;T's shift of
some of its manufacturing overseas after the 1984 of the breakup of
the Bell System.
   But like the issue of who pays for escalating health care costs,
that demand appears to be on a collision course with what AT&amp;T says
it needs in job flexibility to keep up with changing technology and
greater competition.
   The newfound unity between the IBEW and CWA gives the unions
improved leverage in the talks ``because now if you have a strike
it will be a total shutdown,'' says Bahr.
   Through the AFL-CIO, the two unions have made arrangement to
call an immediate nationwide labor boycott of AT&amp;T products and
services if there is a strike, Bahr said.
   Williams, AT&amp;T's vice president for labor relations, doubts the
unions' claim that joint bargaining gives them more strength at the
table.
   ``If I thought it was to their advantage, I never would have
agreed to it,'' he said.
   As for pay, the last contract provided members of both unions an
8 percent raise over three years. Williams wouldn't reveal what
AT&amp;T will offer initially this time but said the company has no
plans to demand concessions.
   ``We nee to have some conservative settlements and let the
market move toward us,'' he said.
   Average annual wages at AT&amp;T range from $22,360 for operators to
$34,453 for skilled technicians, according to union figures.
   Both sides agree health care likely will be the major sticking
point.
   The unions want some improvements in their current plan.
Williams, without being specific, said the company ``needs some
help'' from workers to stem rising costs. AT&amp;T will spend $1
billion this year on health benefits for active and retired
workers, he said.
   ``If there's any single issue that can prevent a peaceful
settlement it's health care,'' Bahr said.
   AT&amp;T's request for job restructuring also is likely to run into
fervent opposition from the unions. The CWA and IBEW together have
lost more than 78,000 union jobs in the four years since the AT&amp;T
breakup while the company has added some 13,000 positions in
management and other non-union areas.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese auto parts maker in which U.S. corporate
takeover specialist T. Boone Pickens Jr. has taken a substantial
stake today said it was surprised by the move, which made Pickens
its largest shareholder.
   Pickens held 20.2 percent of the stock in Koito Manufacturing
Co. as of March 31. The second-largest stockholder, Toyota Motor
Corp., holds 19.1 percent.
   A Koito spokesman, Mikio Tsuruta, said the unusually large
investment by an American in a Japanese company took the
manufacturer of automobile lighting systems by surprise.
   Koito has contacted its lawyers and its major shareholders,
including Toyota and Nissan Motor Co., which owns 5.95 percent, he
said.
   ``We haven't done anything else yet, because this has been a
very sudden event for us,'' Tsuruta said.
   ``We have no idea why he bought our shares,'' he added.
   Asked if the Japanese company is worried about the 20.2 percent
purchase of its stock by a U.S. company, Tsuruta said, ``Of
course.''
   The company would not comment on speculation that the purchase
by Boone Co., a privately held merchant bank formed in 1986 and
controlled by Pickens, could involve a ``greenmail'' attempt.
   On Tuesday, Boone Co.'s vice president of finance, Sidney
Tassin, would not comment about the firm's intentions toward Koito
or its strategy involving the investment but said he doesn't regard
the stake as hostile in intent.
   ``We believe that the Japanese-American involvement and
relationship is of increasing importance and opportunity,'' said
Tassin.
   Keith Donaldson, an analyst at James Capel Pacific Ltd. in
Tokyo, said ``It looks like a case of greenmail to me. If you want
to do this sort of thing, the best target is Toyota because they've
got 2 trillion yen ($15 billion) in cash.''
   Greenmail is a term used for a method of reaping profits by a
hostile corporate suitor when his stock is purchased at a premium
by another shareholder friendly to the company.
   ``There's no way Boone Pickens is interested in a small car
parts manufacturer,'' said Donaldson. ``There's also no way he
would be able to take the company over because Toyota will come in
and buy him out.''
   Donaldson and other analysts in Tokyo said they believe a
Japanese luxury car importer, Azabu Motors, is behind Pickens'
acquisition of 32.4 million shares of Koito.
   The Azabu group, which reportedly has targeted other Japanese
companies for greenmail in the past, bought 48 million shares of
Koito in 1988. A large block of those shares was registered under
the name of T. Boone Pickens.
   ``Some believe Azabu is only using Boone's name to greenmail
Toyota. Others believe T. Boone is the actual owner,'' said Ben
Moyer, an automobile analyst at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo.
   The Koito purchase is the second major acquisition of stock in a
Toyota group company by a third party in the past two years. In
1987, Nippon Land successfully maneuvered Toyota into buying back a
large portion of shares in Toyoda Automatic Loom, Moyer said.
   Pickens has launched takeover attempts of oil companies
including Unocal, Diamond Shamrock and Phillips, but has never
succeeded in purchasing a company as a result of a hostile bid.
   He has, however, made huge profits on some deals after friendly
investors or the target company itself purchased his shares.
   Boone Co. is not connected with Pickens' Mesa Limited Partners
oil and gas company.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Wants Details On Carbide Negotiations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court asked the Indian
government and Union Carbide Corp. to disclose all details of
negotiations leading to a $470 million settlement in the Bhopal gas
leak, Press Trust of India reported Wednesday.
   The news agency said a five-judge panel asked the government to
file an affidavit within three weeks, disclosing all documents,
negotiations, and persons involved in the talks.
   The panel said it needed to ascertain whether the Feb. 14
settlement was reasonable, PTI said.
   Several opposition politicians and newspapers have termed the
settlement inadequate. The government originally sued Danbury,
Conn.-based Union Carbide for $3 billion.
   The court also said Union Carbide would have to indicate if it
had earlier agreed to a settlement higher than $470 million
dollars, PTI said.
   The government and Union Carbide reached a Supreme
Court-supervised settlement to pay $470 million as compesation to
the victims of the gas leak in the central Indian city of Bhopal.
   More than 3,000 people died and at least 20,000 were injured
when deadly methyl isocynate gas leaked out on Dec. 3, 1984 from a
pesticide plant run by the Indian subsidiary of Union Carbide.
   The government became the sole representatives of more than
500,000 people, who claimed to be victims, through a special law
passed in Parliament. The validity of that law has been challenged
by at least two petitions in the court.

   Grain futures prices were mostly higher in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts said soybeans were showing strength, bolstered by
commission house buying after opening lower.
   Ted Mao of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said traders believed
price movement among soy futures had been limited since Friday's
bearish supply report.
   Speculation of new export sales buoyed wheat prices, and corn
followed the momentum, Mao said.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 3} cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.05 a bushel; corn was { cent to
1} cents higher, with May at $2.63} a bushel; oats were unchanged
to { cents lower, with May at $1.88 a bushel; and soybeans were \
cent to 7{ cents higher, with May at $7.15 a bushel.
   Futures prices for livestock and meat were higher in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   In early trading, cattle were .32 cent to .57 cent higher, with
the contract for delivery in April at 77.87 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .25 cent to .40 cent higher, with April at 79.77 cents
a pound; live hogs were .05 cent to .15 cent higher, with April at

cent higher, with May at 35.00 cents a pound.
   On Tuesday, most livestock and meat prices were lower.

   A Massachusetts utility today offered
$2.35 billion for Public Service Company of New Hampshire if the
Seabrook nuclear power plant operates and $1.4 billion if the
troubled reactor doesn't.
   New England Electric System of Westboro made the offer
conditional on the future operation of the plant, which is
completed but lacks an operating license because of regulatory
challenges on its emergency evacuation plans.
   Public Service is the lead owner of Seabrook.
   The offer calls for running the utility under state rather than
federal regulation and a promise to buy $850 million worth of power
if Seabrook operates. It also includes an annual rate increase
ceiling of 7 percent for three years.
   Public Service, which is in bankruptcy reorganization, is banned
by state law from charging consumers for Seabrook before the plant
operates. It has courted Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
regulation to bypass the prohibition.
   New England Electric already has been spending money on a media
campaign aimed in part at letting Public Service's 360,000
customers know it has a long-standing presence in the state. It
owns Granite State Electric Co., which serves 60,000 customers.
   Northeast Utilities of Connecticut, New England's largest
electric company, in January proposed a buyout bid it valued at $2
billion. Public Service says about eight other companies also have
expressed interest in acquiring some or all of its assets.
   Public Service sought bankruptcy court protection more than a
year ago after becoming mired in Seabrook debt.

<HEAD>Minus Milken, Junk Bond Gathering Still Draws 3,000</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with nine grafs to UPDATE with conference opened by Milken
successor Kissick. Picks up 6th graf pvs, Despite his ...</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``Predators Ball'' began today
with a reserved tip of the hat to absent Michael Milken, founder of
the junk bond market it celebrates.
   Milken, top junk bond trader for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
can't be at the annual event the company calls the Institutional
Research Conference, which attracts a who's who of corporate
takeover artists.
   Milken was charged last week with 98 counts of securities fraud
and racketeering in connection with alleged trading violations and
is officially on leave from his job as Drexel's junk bond guru.
   Milken's successor, John H. Kissick, opened the 3{-day
conference with a reserved tribute to Milken and a promise that his
company would continue to forge ahead.
   ``After more than two years, the government has finally brought
charges against Michael Milken and others,'' Kissick told a
standing-room-only audience. ``Now that they have an opportunity to
exercise their right to due process, they have our honest wishes
for success.''
   Kissick sought to reassure investors that Drexel would continue
to battle for the preeminent spot in the high-yield bond market
despite the loss of the man credited with creating it.
   ``Drexel remains committed to maintaining the high quality of
this market as we move ahead,'' Kissick said.
   Kissick's talk to the Beverly Hilton Hotel conference was
followed by a pep talk on education from Jaime Escalante, the high
school math teacher whose success with underprivileged students was
the basis of the movie ``Stand and Deliver.''
   Except for the opening sessions each day, the conference is
closed to the news media. The schedule calls for presentations by
companies seeking to issue junk bonds, including RJR Nabisco Inc.,
and AMC Entertainment Inc., and sessions on such topics as
bankruptcy and the balance sheet.
   Despite his absence, Milken's image looms large over the meeting.
   ``He was omnipresent,'' said Clark Johnson, chairman and chief
executive of Pier 1 Imports Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, a
participant. ``You saw him around and of course he was running the
show. He was having meetings. He was doing deals. He was being his
usual energetic, indefatigable self.''
   Even without its guiding light, the meeting is a unique
convention of American entrepreneurs who have built or bought
companies with junk bonds, Johnson said.
   ``You always come away re-energized, with a lot of new ideas,''
Johnson said in a telephone interview before the meeting. ``These
have been the growth companies, the companies that are doing
things, the companies that are rebuilding corporate America.''
   Drexel is downplaying Milken's absence from the conference, much
as it is working to assure investors the firm can remain a prime
mover in the high-yield bond market without him.
   The conference is the most heavily attended yet, said Drexel
spokesman Steve Anreder, who emphasized the varied schedule of
sessions on subjects ranging from Third World debt to employee
stock plans to the savings and loan industry.
   ``I think what that says is the high-yield market has been
validated and there's a lot of interest,'' the spokesman said.
   Milken is credited with building the multibillion-dollar market
in junk bonds, the high-risk, high-interest bonds used by
entrepreneurs and corporate takeover artists to raise cash.
   In addition to popularizing use of the bonds _ dubbed ``junk''
because they receive lower than investment-grade ratings from
bond-rating agencies _ Milken was at the center of a newtork of
traders who both sold bonds for their own projects and could be
tapped to invest in junk bonds sold by others.

<HEAD>Leasing Employees Cuts Corporate Headaches</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   When Dale Voss bought Noel Ice Co. two years ago, the first
thing he did was fire all the employees.
   But the cube-making didn't melt down for a minute. Those same
employees were back at the freezers of the Nashville-based company
the next day, although another company was signing their paychecks.
   Noel joined the growing number of businesses leasing some or all
their employees, a strategy that can cut costs and eliminate
management headaches ranging from payroll deductions to
employer-sponsored health insurance.
   ``Every time I get a little piece of paper from the government
about my employees, I can just write 'em back and tell 'em Noel Ice
Co. has no employees,'' Voss says.
   Employee leasing is now used to staff entire departments, from
daycare centers to mail rooms to production lines. It has gained
the most popularity among small and medium-sized businesses. But
even large corporations are finding it attractive.
   At Chase Manhattan Bank, leased messengers deliver up to 1,000
documents a day. Insurance giant Cigna Corp. leases its daycare
facility.
   The National Planning Association, an economic consulting group
in Washington, reckons the number of employees under lease is at
least 165,000, but some other estimates range as high as 500,000.
   Joseph Honick, executive director of the National Staff Leasing
Association, says the number of leasees is swelling by about 30
percent a year, and by the end of the next decade, he projects
leased-employee population could exceed 3 million.
   Leasing frees companies from the monumental worries associated
with employees calling in sick, juggling vacation schedules,
providing costly benefits and making social security payments to
the government.
   ``It tightens the line between businesses and their customers,''
Honick said. ``If you're in the business to sell shoes, you're not
in business to run a payroll operation.''
   In turn, a generation of entrepreneurs who organize the legions
of leasees has been spawned _ an estimated 400 companies exist
solely to lease workers to other companies.
   The trend started because ``companies have gotten very hurt in
the process of downsizing and upsizing and downsizing and
upsizing,'' said Edith Weiner of the New York management consulting
firm of Weiner, Edrich, Brown Inc.
   ``Companies want to keep their constant overhead lower, and they
don't really want to have the problem of laying people off,'' she
said. ``Sometimes it costs more (to lease), but it gives you more
latitude.''
   Until the Tax Reform Act of 1986, employee leasing was
considered a questionable practice, partly because high-income
professionals such as doctors and lawyers used it so they could set
up tax-deferred pension plans for themselves while avoiding them
for their workers. Once those loopholes were closed, leasing's
credibility rose.
   Many employers praise the system. ``It saves me time,'' said Van
Stewart, president of Auto Rental Systems Inc., a car leasing
company with operations in Nashville, Memphis, Dallas and St.
Louis, that leases its 37 employees.
   ``I don't have to spend any time on payroll, I don't have to
file (social security) ... I'm writing two checks a month instead
of 50 or 60,'' said Stewart. He even gets his own check from the
leasing company.
   Besides handling payroll, leasing companies can pool groups of
employees for cheaper insurance. Noel's Voss said before he bought
the company, it had been spending $112 a month per employee to
cover health benefits. Now he's paying a leasing concern $87 a
month per employee for benefits he says are superior.
   While a full benefits package can run as much as 60 percent of
an employee's base salary, ``we can bring it in for about 30 to 35
percent,'' said Edward Katz, founder of New York-based Choice
Courier Inc.
   Katz's messenger service has evolved into a leasing operation
with 1,500 employees in nine East Coast cities. He's projecting 30
percent growth this year, to about $40 million in annual revenues.
   Like many other leasing concerns, Katz uses plenty of part-time
help and scales back benefits like vacation time to save more
money. He'll hire, fire, train and maintain a workforce for other
businesses.
   ``The savings for a company is non-calculable,'' said Katz.
``The people we're dealing with are on the bottom two rungs'' of
the employment ladder. ``We've got the new wave of immigrants, and
we have to train them.''
   With expertise in the mailroom, Katz says he can find savings
where companies forget to look. For example, his workers transmit
documents by facsimile machine to the West Coast after 6 p.m., when
phone costs are cheaper. They use lightweight envelopes to slash
postage.
   To ensure each job is always fully staffed, Katz has a dozen or
so workers waiting to be dispatched from a ``bullpen'' when other
employees call in sick.
   It's hard to find a critic of leasing. Although leased employees
don't necessarily have high-paying jobs with generous benefits,
they often have better security. If they're on one job and the
contract is canceled, their leasing company can shift them to
another worksite.
   When a leasing company moves in to run an already-functioning
operation, those same employees stay on the job, although Honick
rejects the characterization that they're fired first then rehired.
   ``They don't write resignation letters,'' he said. ``A leased
employee is a regular employee.''
   Some say larger corporations have been slow to embrace the
concept because they often are bound by strict union agreements.
But Honick says a deeper reason is there aren't enough
professional, qualified employee-leasing companies to go around.
   In the past, leased employees have been relegated to running the
company cafeteria or providing janitorial services. But the realm
of services leased workers provide continues to broaden.
   Cigna Corp. has contracted with the national child-care chain
Kinder-Care Inc. to provide a fully staffed daycare center housing
80 children at its headquarters in Bloomfield, Conn. The cost to
the company has been minimal, since employees pay for most of the
expense.
   ``If we were operating it ourselves, I don't know what it would
cost, but I imagine it would be more expensive,'' said Cigna's
director of employee services, Beth Fox. ``We have some operating
costs involved in grounds and indoor maintenance, but that's about
it. ... We don't need to get involved in any great way.''
   Because Cigna provided a building to Kinder-Care, the child-care
company was able to offer its services at a discount. An existing
space cuts Kinder-Care's capital investment by roughly 25 percent,
said Len Kuhn, senior vice president of development at the
Montgomery, Ala., company.
   Kinder-Care also can provide services cheaper than Cigna could,
partly because of economies of scale and Kinder-Care's
well-developed daycare structure.
   ``We have all the programs in place, all the policies and
procedures, an understanding of staffing needs, and because we have
an established track record and managed our liability very well, we
have a significant difference in (the cost of) insurance,'' Kuhn
said.

   The stock market was little changed today in an
atmosphere of uncertainty about the economic outlook.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 6.60 on Tuesday,
slipped another .55 to 2,297.65 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 626 up, 568 down and 583
unchanged.
   Analysts said it was difficult to discern how the market might
respond when the Labor Department issues its monthly report Friday
on the employment situation.
   Private forecasts generally call for a smaller gain in nonfarm
payroll employment than the 289,000 increase reported for February,
when the unemployment rate fell to a 15-year low.
   Not so long ago, that kind of news might have been interpreted
as a plus for stocks, indicating a slackening of upward pressure on
inflation and interest rates.
   But lately many traders have begun to worry that the battle to
restrain inflation might wind up producing a recession and an
accompanying slump in corporate profits.
   Auto stocks fell following the news on Tuesday of weak car sales
in the late-March selling period. General Motors dropped } to 40;
Ford Motor 1 to 47|, and Chrysler { to 24.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.19 to 166.14. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .65 at 329.84.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 85.11 million shares at
noontime, up from 58.20 million at the same point Tuesday.

<HEAD>Davis: Financing For Takeover Wouldn't Require Selling `Strategic
Assets'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buying Northwest Airlines for $2.62 billion
would not require selling the carrier's ``strategic assets'' to
finance the takeover debt, suitor Marvin Davis announced today.
   The investor made the statement in a letter to the board of
directors of NWA Inc., the parent of the nation's fourth largest
air carrier.
   Davis, a billionaire whose holdings include real estate and
entertainment properties, last week offered to pay $90 for each of
NWA's 29.1 million shares in a deal he insists is friendly.
   Northwest Chairman Steven Rothmeier has said the board of
directors will review the offer, but he has not said when the board
will meet.
   The airline also said it intends to remain independent and state
officials have rallied behind the carrier, introducing legislation
intended to thwart a hostile takeover.
   ``No divestitures of strategic assets are required to service
the debt that would be incurred to effect the acquisition,'' Davis
said in his letter, which was dated Tuesday and released to the
media today. ``With the equity we are prepared to commit and the
anticipated structure of the balance of the financing, the
company's projected cash flow is adequate to service the debt
involved.''
   Davis repeated in his letter an earlier statement that he
intends to expand the airline's domestic and international routes
and keep the headquarters in Minnesota, where Northwest is one of
the state's largest employers. He also said his plans call for ``no
employee layoffs, workforce reductions or alterations in seniority
schedules.''
   The letter said Northwest management would be retained in the
event of a takeover, but the letter also said, ``we intend to
effect only those management changes required to improve NWA's
performance.''
   ``Since we have no current airline operations, there are no
redundancies or overlaps that would require layoffs or similar
employee reductions,'' the letter said. ``We wish to buy NWA to
operate and expand it.''
   Analysts have said takeover debt could impair Northwest's fleet
modernization plans. But Davis said in his letter that the
acquisition plan ``in no way calls for the reduction of the
company's present capital investment program'' or
``maintenance-related matters.''
   Kevin Whalen, a Northwest spokesman, confirmed that the board of
directors received the letter. He said there would be no comment
from the company until the board reviews Davis' offer.
   The letter did not say that financing was in place for Davis'
proposal.
   In morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, NWA stock was
selling for $84.75 a share, up $1 from Tuesday's close.

wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former marketing executive for a
defense contractor testified today that he knew bribes were being
paid to a Navy engineer in exchange for inside information about a
lucrative contract.
   But Michael Savaides told the jury he never informed his
superiors at Teledyne Electronics in Newbury Park, Calif., about
the bribery scheme.
   Savaides, who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery
and is cooperating with federal investigators in the case, worked
in Washington as the marketing manager for the firm that was
seeking a $24 million contract for hand-held radar equipment in
1985.
   At that time the California company had already lost one or two
government contracts and had ``fears of losing another program,''
he said. Thus there was some pressure to win the Pentagon business.
   Testifying at the trial of three former executives of Teledyne
Electronics, Savaides said that at the same time he was employed by
the firm he had entered into a secret agreement with two private
consultants, William Parkin and Fred Lackner. Both men have pleaded
guilty in the case.
   In November 1985, Parkin reached a deal with Teledyne
Electronics to be paid $10,000 in exchange for trying to obtain the
contract. At the same time Parkin said Teledyne agreed that he
would be paid $150,000 if he was successful.
   ``If he was not successful, then there would be no fee paid,''
Savaides said.
   When he learned of Parkin's arrangement with Teledyne, Savaides
said, ``My reaction was pure amazement and shock....I didn't
believe Teledyne would enter into an agreement like this.''
   Savaides testified that after Parkin reached the deal with
Teledyne, he, Parkin, Lackner and Berlin were to split the money
equally. Savaides was given some of his portion.
   Savaides' testimony came on the third day of the trial, the
first in the long-running investigation of the defense procurement
case.
   On Tuesday, the prosecution played a tape of a telephone
conversation in which Lackner and Parkin joked about what would
happen if ordinary Americans discovered their bribery scheme.
   ``If the farmers in Indiana knew what you sons of bitches were
doing with their money, they would come up there and kill you with
their pitchforks,'' Lackner told Parkin on the tape.
   Lackner's comment, recorded by one of four FBI bugs placed on
Parkins' home and office telephones in 1987 and 1988, was on two
hours of tapes played for jurors at the trial.
   Lackner's remark drew hearty laughter from Parkin.
   The tapes included numerous conversations between Lackner and
Parkin, detailing their efforts to obtain confidential bid
information that would help Teledyne in its negotiations with the
Pentagon.
   They also provided evidence of repeated requests for such
information by Eugene R. Sullivan, one of the three Teledyne
executives on trial in U.S. District Court in this suburb of
Washington.
   During a conversation June 19, 1987, Lackner furnished Parkin
with details sought by Sullivan about how much the Army, Navy and
Air Force were prepared to spend to procure hand-held radar testing
devices.
   ``The deal is just a tad over $4.2 million,'' Lackner reported.
``Always helpful to know when you're negotiating,'' he said with a
laugh.
   After Teledyne negotiated the contract, Parkin pressured company
executive George H. Kaub, another defendant, to make good on
Teledyne's promise to pay Parkin a $150,000 consulting fee.
   During a conversation July 8, 1987, Parkin told Kaub that he had
helped eliminate Teledyne's competition so that the company would
qualify as a ``sole-source provider'' of the military equipment.
   ``Since it's sole source, you should have much more than enough
to take care of our little pets,'' Parkin told Kaub, referring to
his contacts in Washington who helped get information.
   Kaub said he wasn't sure the contract was that lucrative but
concluded by saying: ``I understand.''
   Complaining also to Sullivan that the money had not been paid,
Parkin threatened to use his influence to get the Defense
Department to cancel its options to buy additional equipment.
   ``The only thing we can do is cancel next year by making sure
it's not exercised,'' he told Sullivan.
   Parkin remarked that his friends, whom he never identified, were
``getting goosey'' about not getting paid.
   ``They have finessed this thing an awfully long way,'' he told
Sullivan.
   The defense contends that Sullivan, Kaub and Dale Schnittjer,
the third Teledyne executive on trial, did not know that Parkin was
engaged in illegal activity after he was retained by Teledyne to
help it get the contract.
   But conversations played on the tapes suggested that Sullivan
and Kaub understood that illegal influence was being exerted.
   In one conversation with Parkin, Sullivan praised his friend's
ability to get him information about the contract. ``I thought I'd
come to the magic swami and have him check it,'' Sullivan said.

<HEAD>Eight Disciplined At Chicago Merc</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange says it is using
its computerized trading system to crack down on broker groups that
team up to pool their business.
   Eight people have been disciplined for violating rules that
restrict trading between members of the same broker group, the Merc
announced Tuesday.
   The actions, which range from warnings to fines, included a
formal warning letter sent to Harry Lowrance, a prominent trader
and former Merc floor chairman, said Merc spokesman Andrew Yemma.
   Lowrance exceeded the exchange's 25 percent limit on
intra-association trading when filling customer orders during
January in Standard and Poor's 500 futures, Yemma said.
   Independent traders complain that their business suffers when
groups control large amounts of customer business.

   General Motors Corp. said Wednesday that it
will halt production of the Buick Skyhawk model cars and increase
output of Skylarks for the 1990 model year.
   The Skyhawk is manufactured in Janesville, Wis., and its
elimination will mean no loss of jobs there because of increased
production of the Chevrolet Cavalier, also made at the plant,
spokeswoman Corby Casler said.
   Starting in the 1990 model year, which officially begins Oct. 1,
Flint-based Buick will offer four Skylark models _ a standard,
custom, luxury edition and gran sport.
   The Skyhawk was introduced in 1982 as a coupe and a sedan. A
station wagon was added the following year and hatchback models
were introduced for the 1986 and 1987 model years.
   Through March of this year, Skyhawk sales were running 43.1
percent behind last year's pace. Skylark sales during the same
period were down 11.4 percent. Overall, GM's car sales for the year
were off 14.6 percent compared with the same time last year.

   When the first McDonald's restaurant opens in
Moscow, the Canadian executive who helped make it happen probably
will be remembering the Montreal Olympics and a fateful bus ride 13
years ago.
   George A. Cohon, a Chicago native who is president of McDonald's
of Canada, recalled that the company's corporate buses were lent to
Soviet organizers of the 1980 Moscow Olympics touring Montreal in
1976.
   Cohon, who still quotes McDonald's founder Ray Kroc with respect
and relish, went along for fun and made a stop at a Montreal
McDonald's part of the tour.
   ``That night we started talking about the possibility of getting
involved,'' he said.
   Cohon said the plan to have McDonald's at the 1980 Moscow
Olympics fell through before the U.S.-led boycott _ ``In a way it
was the best deal I never made'' _ but he kept thinking about ``280
million people, hungry _ this has got to be a great market.''
   ``I just went back at it,'' he said in an interview at company
headquarters in Toronto.
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policies allowing joint
ventures with foreigners has made the agreement possible.
McDonald's of Canada, a subsidiary of the U.S. fast-food giant
McDonald's Corp., holds a minority position in partnership with the
Moscow City Council's Food Service Administration.
   Cohon, just back from his latest trip to Moscow and planning
another trip in May, said the food distribution center for the
operation is under construction. After it's ready late this year or
in early 1990, the first two of 20 restaurants specified in the
agreement will open near Red Square.
   He said the additional restaurants will be opening slowly, as
the supply and distribution lines are established and the staff
trained.
   ``We're not in a race with anybody,'' he said. ``The Big Mac has
to taste the same in Moscow as it does in New York or London.''
   The 51-year-old executive came to Canada in the late 1960s as a
young lawyer representing a client who had wanted to open what
would be the first McDonald's franchise in eastern Canada. But the
client decided Canada was too cold, so Cohon grabbed the
opportunity to open the franchise himself.
   The first McDonald's in Canada opened in 1967 in British
Columbia. The first in Cohon's territory opened a year later in
London, Ontario, 118 miles west of Toronto. He still remembers the
date, Nov. 11.
   The eastern and western Canadian operations were consolidated in
1971 and Cohon was named president.
   The 500th McDonald's in Canada opened in 1986 and the 600th will
open this summer, a huge operation at Toronto's new Skydome stadium
where the American League's Blue Jays will play.
   Cohon, who became a Canadian citizen in 1975, is an enthusiastic
booster of the restaurants and the country that was the site of
McDonald's first expansion outside the United States.
   ``When we started here, I don't think we faced the competition
McDonald's had in the United States,'' he said. ``Also, Canadians
are very mobile. They travel a lot _ so there was an awareness
level of McDonald's that was really helpful to us.''
   Cohon said he decided to become a Canadian citizen so he could
vote. He has become a fixture on the local and national charity
circuits, perhaps best known for his efforts in saving the Toronto
Santa Claus parade that dates back almost to the turn of the
century.
   Cohon said he heard about the parade's financial troubles and
decided it was a children's favorite. ``I said, `it's an
institution. You can't let it die,''' he recalled.
   He musters the same enthusiasm to talk about the new Moscow
McDonald's operation, where the distribution center will have ``a
meat plant, a potato plant, a dairy and a bakery, all under one
roof.''
   ``I don't have horror stories,'' he said. ``In any new country
where McDonald's goes, it's hard. It was hard in Canada - but I
have no horror stories.''
   He predicted that the hardest part will be coping with the lines
and the volume that the first restaurants will generate. He also
insisted that the company's standards won't be compromised in the
effort to do business in the Soviet Union - ``and our partners
understand that.''
   Cohon said that at this point he's not even thinking about the
first 20 restaurants called for in the Moscow agreement. ``I'm
thinking about the first one,'' he said.
   But he said that he couldn't have imagined 600 restaurants in
Canada when he was at the same point here a little more than 20
years ago.
   ``The potential for the Soviet Union - once we get it going
properly -is 280 million people,'' he said.

   Chevron Corp. expects to begin
production near Point Arguello later this year as part of a project
designed to supply enough energy to fuel 2.9 million cars a day,
according to a company attorney.
   Chevron lawyer Doug Uchikura made the statement Tuesday night
when the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors voted that a
group of companies led by Chevron be allowed to start oil and
natural gas operations. The board voted 4 to 1 that the $2 billion
project meets county safety requirements.
   Uchikura said the company still needs board approval for using
tankers to move oil from Point Arguello to California refineries,
including Chevron's huge facility at Richmond. He said that once
approval for the tankers is received the company plans to start
operations in July or August.
   The other companies in the partnership include Texaco Inc.,
Phillips Petroleum Co., Pennzoil Co., Sun Co. and Union Pacific
Corp.
   The plan calls for three offshore drilling platforms and two
27-mile pipelines that transport crude oil and gas to separate
purifying plants in Gaviota.
   Chevron agreed to install an alarm system on the pipeline that
would detect a hydrogen sulfide leak. The county planning
commission earlier rejected th plan, saying the companies
underestimated by 65 percent the amount of hydrogen sulfide in the
field's natural gas.
   Chevron also agreed to lower pipeline pressure to reduce the
spread of a potential leak in an area that was hit by a 3 million
gallon oil spill by Union Oil Co. in 1969.
   Backers say that by the 1990s the field's production could hit
93,000 barrels of oil and 60 million cubic feet of gas a day, more
than the current output for the entire Santa Barbara Channel.

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon today refloated its still-leaking
oil tanker, whose fugitive captain surrendered a few hours earlier
to face charges of operating the vessel while drunk.
   A judge in Hauppauge, N.Y., set bail at $500,000 for the
captain, 20 times as much as prosecutors had recommended, saying
``we have a manmade destruction that has not been equaled,
probably, since Hiroshima.''
   With claims against Exxon for damages escalating into the
millions, U.S. Navy oil skimmers were pressed into service, and
Exxon accepted an offer of help from the Soviet Union.
   Salvage crews pumped compressed air into the $125 million ship
to float it off Bligh Reef, 25 miles from the port of Valdez. From
there, it began a 30-mile journey under the control of six tugs to
a remote cove off Naked Island for temporary repairs, picking its
way through scattered icebergs.
   The ship was refloated before tide reached its peak Wednesday.
``It was not just a stroke of good luck,'' said Gary Gorski,
Exxon's salvage coordinator. ``It took a lot of hard work.''
   Company officials turned to the Far East in search of a dry dock
willing to accept the crippled leviathan Exxon Valdez.
   As the oil off Alaska spread over 2,600 square miles, an area
larger than the state of Delaware, the fired captain of the tanker
turned himself in this morning to authorities in Hauppauge, N.Y.
   Joseph Hazelwood, who lives on New York's Long Island, appeared
with his attorney 12 days after his ship ran aground and nearly a
week after the National Transportation Safety Board said tests
showed he was under the influence of alcohol several hours after
the accident.
   He had been sought since Sunday on a fugitive warrant for three
misdemeanor charges that carry a penalty of up to 2\ years in jail.
Alaska authorities have said they will seek his extradition.
   Exxon said it has changed its policy because of the spill and
now requires crews to be aboard ship, where drinking is prohibited,
four hours before sailing.
   Oil as thick as mayonnaise has soiled 800 miles of beach,
thousands of animals are known dead, including at least 30 sea
otters.
   ``Dozens of otters are dying before rescuers can get to them,''
said fish and game spokesman Jon Lyman.
   The dead otters included a year-old pup, one of five that had
been sent to San Diego's Sea World for treatment.
   While the toll from the nation's worst oil spill mounted, its
impact on the flow of Alaskan crude was abating.
   The Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. said it would resume a normal
daily flow of 2.1 million barrels of oil through the trans-Alaska
pipeline today. The flow had been cut by 60 percent because of
restrictions on tanker traffic in Valdez harbor, but those
restrictions have eased.
   In the longer turn, though, the spill could slow petroleum
exploration in environmentally sensitive areas at least
temporarily, Environmental Protection Administrator William Reilly
told Congress.
   On Tuesday, crews finished transferring about 42 million gallons
of crude from the crippled tanker to other ships in preparation for
the refloating. The $125 million vessel, one of Exxon's newest, had
been sitting on Bligh Reef in since running aground March 24 and
spilling more than 10 million gallons of crude.
   After that, Exxon said its first choice for dry dock is
Portland, Ore., but officials there said they weren't sure if
they'd allow that, even though the $12 million repair bill would
provide about 200 jobs.
   ``A lot of questions that need to be answered,'' Oregon Gov.
Neil Goldschmidt said.
   Canadian authorities also asked Exxon for assurances that towing
the tanker to Oregon won't damage the British Columbia coast.
   Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi said the company has
had discussions with dry docks in South Korea, Japan and Singapore
about accepting the vessel. He said the ship won't trail any
pollution while it is towed.
   Iarossi said Exxon had not added up its costs so far.
``Millions, multiple millions. It's going to be big numbers,'' he
said.
   One hundred claims have been filed with the company for damages,
including 40 on Tuesday alone. The claims have come mostly from
fishermen. Exxon has settled only two so far.
   At least 14 lawsuits have been filed.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimated
the leading edge of the spill was 100 miles southwest of the tanker
off the Kenai Peninsula. The spill has been pushed away from Kenai
Fjords National Park and the area south of Seward by water flowing
out of Resurrection Bay.
   Fisheries within the sound remained threatened, and the slick
appeared to be oozing slowly toward other Alaskan ports.
   Exxon gave $1 million on Monday to Prince William Sound
Aquaculture Corp. to buy boom to defend hatcheries, said Susan
Ogle, a spokeswoman for the Cordova spill response office.
   Exxon said it has asked the State Department to notify Moscow
that it has accepted a Soviet offer of an oil skimmer. Five of the
U.S. Navy's 18 heavy-duty oil skimmers went into operation Monday,
and Exxon requested the remaining 13.
   The company also said that placing an oil-catching boom around
the ship immediately after the grounding could have touched off a
giant explosion of gases from the oil, although that was not the
reason it took 11 hours to set the first containment line.
   ``The worst thing we could have done early on was try to boom
the vessel. We would have lost the vessel,'' said Iarossi.
   Officials have said boom wasn't placed around the vessel
immediately because the equipment wasn't available in Valdez.

<HEAD>Bottom Of The Ninth Inning for Automakers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Production cuts and the first substantial layoffs
in the auto industry in several years are probable by late summer
if new incentives offered by U.S. automakers strike out with
potential car buyers, industry analysts said Wednesday.
   ``You've got the best team coming into the ninth inning,'' said
analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. of New York. ``We've got
to get some hits in here. If the weather turns bad and you get
rained out, you lose.''
   Brady, who has normally been bullish on the domestic auto
industry, and other analysts said ambitious production schedules
face certain cutting in the second half of the year if sales don't
recover from an uncharacteristic slump in March.
   Normally, March and April are strong sales months. In
anticipation of that, carmakers allowed their inventories to grow
as they do at the beginning of every year.
   But there are differences this year. Because of recent years of
healthy sales, the market has become increasingly saturated with
new cars.
   Automakers and industry watchers expected sales last month to be
lower than in March 1988 when the industry was beginning the
second-largest sales year in history.
   Cars and trucks assembled by the eight major U.S.-based
carmakers sold at a rate 11.6 percent lower in March than they did
during the same month last year. Through the first three months of
1989, sales were off 7.6 percent.
   There is some concern that the auto industry, which often serves
as a leading indicator of the U.S. economy's health, may be in for
a rocky time in the early 1990s.
   The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday quoted sources as saying
analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had drastically
cut his earnings projections for General Motors Corp., Ford Motor
Co. and Chrysler Corp. for 1990. Healy declined to discuss the
report.
   ``If these incentives don't work, I think everyone is going to
mark down their forecasts,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of the
Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta.
``A lot are riding on these incentives.''
   Each of the Big Three signaled their concern about sagging sales
within the last week by offering incentive packages including
financing as low as zero percent and increased cash rebates on many
cars and trucks.
   ``If these incentives don't move the sales rate up temporarily,
the companies will have to cut production,'' said Healy.
   ``We're getting into a better selling season,'' Brady said.
``We've got excellent rates out there in terms of the incentive
programs and very good selection.''
   However, he added, ``The third quarter is a question, depending
on how many we sell in April or May.'' Last year, sales during
those two months trended just above what proved to be the annual
rate.
   ``I think they might be able to lift the second-quarter selling
rate ...'' Healy said, ``but even then I think you'll have a fairly
skinny third quarter as far as production is concerned.''
   During March, some automakers briefly cut production, in what
they called inventory adjustments. Longer-term production cuts, and
more layoffs, may be on the horizon, Healy and Brady said.
   Those production cuts probably won't come until the third
quarter of the year, when factories usually shut down to retool for
the new model year. Second-quarter production is pretty well locked
in, they said, because automakers already have placed orders with
their suppliers.
   ``You've seen no pullback in the production schedules,'' Brady
said. ``So we've been coming to April with sales mediocre and
confidence levels among the domestic manufacturers remaining fairly
high.
   ``The fact of the matter is that production will probably come
down a little,'' he said. ``We've gotten to the point where we have
to produce now.''

<HEAD>Risk Had its Rewards and Losses, Mutual Fund Survey Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors in mutual funds that held stock in
certain small, fast-growing companies made a tidy profit in the
first quarter, but those involved in equally risky worldwide
fixed-income funds fared poorly, a survey of mutual fund
performance said.
   Alger Small Capital and the Kaufman Fund were the biggest
gainers among nearly 1,700 funds surveyed during the three months
ended March 31, with rates of return of 20 percent and 19 percent,
respectively, according to a tally released Thursday by Lipper
Analytical Services Inc.
   The strategy of both funds was to pick small companies that
showed potential for rapid growth.
   In terms of specific industries, Lipper said the top performing
funds had significant positions in broadcast, cellular and selected
telephone issues. Leading the pack were health and biotechnology
funds, which gained 11.04 percent on average and natural resource
funds, which gained 8.63 percent.
   Less successful were funds specializing in foreign bonds, which
lost on average 2.20 percent, thanks mainly to weakness in many
foreign currencies, Lipper said. Utilities funds had a 2.25 percent
gain, it said.
   Eight of the 10 biggest quarterly losers were funds in the world
income category, which are most sensitive to fluctuations in
currencies and interest rates. International Cash: Swiss Franc and
T. Rowe Price International Bond headed the list with losses of
8.98 percent and 6.08 percent, respectively.
   Lipper's tally assumes that investors reinvest all dividends and
capital gains distributions that the funds pay out.
   Overall, investors who put their money in stock funds fared
better than those choosing bonds, according to Lipper.
   The average general equity fund gained 6.57 percent, compared
with a 1.17 percent return for fixed-income funds.
   ``As the average fixed income returns were below the interest
rates earned on the portfolios, we believe it is reasonable to
assume that many fixed income funds had a modest loss in terms of
principal only performance,'' said A. Michael Lipper, the firm's
president.

traders anticipated more evidence soon that the economy was cooling
down.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.60 to 2,304.80,

<HEAD>Oil Prices Drop Sharply In Heavy Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Petroleum prices plunged Wednesday as traders
reacted to a range of negative news by unloading energy futures,
driving down the price of unleaded gasoline by more than 3 cents a
gallon.
   Trading was brisk on the New York Mercantile Exchange during a
sell-off that wiped away most of the gains achieved in the previous
session.
   The May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, settled 43 cents lower at $19.99 a barrel. The
contract had gone up 47 cents a barrel on Tuesday.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the May
contract for unleaded gasoline slid by 3.03 cents to 66.43 cents a
gallon. The contract had risen by 1.61 cents and 0.88 cent on
Tuesday and Monday, respectively.
   May wholesale home heating oil, which rose 0.89 cent Tuesday,
fell 2.01 cents to 51.63 cents a gallon.
   Jerry Samuels, an energy broker at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
said the selling came in response to reports stating that OPEC
lately has exceeded its crude production quota and that traffic and
output in Alaska have returned to normal following the disruptions
caused by one of the world's worst oil spills.
   ``It was a wild day. Several bearish elements sent the market
down,'' Samuels said.
   The price retreat occurred despite an industry report showing an
uncommonly large drop in crude oil stocks during the latest week.
The American Petroleum Institute said for the week ended March 31
domestic crude oil stocks fell 12.8 million barrels to 324.58
million.
   Crude inventories have been drawn down due to delays in
shipments from Alaska's oil fields while a cleanup operation takes
place.
   It was reported Wednesday that flow through the Alaskan pipeline
returned to its normal daily level of 2.1 million barrels.
   Oil flow from the North Slope had been cut by 60 percent because
the spill restricted tanker traffic in Valdez harbor, but traffic
has increased.
   Energy prices have rallied recently, responding to the temporary
supply squeeze in the aftermath of a massive oil spill by an Exxon
Corp. tanker at the Valdez, Alaska, port.
   There was no confirmation of reports concerning the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries' crude oil output levels.

   Polaroid Corp. exposed its first conventional
film to reporters Wednesday, billing it as a ``one-size-fits-all''
product that would work for more than 90 percent of the pictures
snapshooters take.
   Analysts said the film was fairly ordinary but could do well by
exploiting consumer confusion over film speeds.
   ``They've come up with a very clever marketing approach to a
me-too product,'' said Eugene Glazer, an analyst at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Polaroid said it hopes to get as much as 5 percent of the
conventional film market, which is about $7 billion worldwide at
retail prices. Glazer predicted the share would fall slightly short
of 5 percent but still benefit the instant photography kingpin.
   The announcement was widely expected, but Polaroid's stock price
rose 25 cents a share anyway to $37.62{.
   Polaroid, under pressure until recently from a $3.2 billion
takeover bid by investor Roy E. Disney, is hoping to improve its
financial results. The company lost $23 million last year after
special restructuring charges and expenses of $152 million.
   Instant photography, which Polaroid founder Edwin H. Land
created in the late 1940s, has had little or no growth in recent
years, while conventional film sales have grown 5 to 10 percent a
year.
   Polaroid is hoping its name recognition and ``no-decisions''
sales pitch will give it a piece of the business dominated by
Eastman Kodak Co. and Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd.
   Polaroid is stressing that OneFilm, which goes on sale Thursday,
relieves consumers of having to choose between different film
speeds, such as 100, 200, 400 and 1000.
   But competitors said OneFilm is nothing special. They said their
own films have wide exposure latitudes, allowing them to be used
under many different circumstances. And they said quality is bound
to suffer if a film is used in the wrong situations.
   ``It's not unusual to have a wide exposure latitude on a film.
All Fuji's color negative print films have wide exposure
latitude,'' said Paul Hudak, general manager of the photographic
products division of Fuji Photo Film USA Inc.
   Fuji's position was backed by Steven Rosenbaum, publisher and
editorial director of Modern Photography magazine. ``I don't
believe there would be any great technological difference in
exposure latitude,'' said Rosenbaum, who said he tried samples of
OneFilm about a month ago and liked it.
   OneFilm is not much of a gamble for Polaroid. Rather than build
huge new film factories, it is buying the film from Minnesota
Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co., or 3M, which is making it according to
Polaroid specifications.
   Name recognition counts for a lot, too. Polaroid has about 11
percent of the blank videocassette market, making it one of the
market leaders. It buys them from other sources, keeping profit
margins slim.
   Land, more visionary than businessman, long opposed getting
Polaroid into conventional film. Wednesday, the company said it was
extending, not abandoning, the instant-film business pioneered by
Land.
   ``We are achieving the contemporary vision of Polaroid as a
complete resource for imaging products _ including instant,
electronic, and now conventional media,'' Carl J. Yankowski, the
vice president of marketing, said at a news conference.
   I. MacAllister Booth, Polaroid's chief executive, announced the
intention to sell conventional film last July a few days before Roy
Disney, nephew of the late Walt Disney, announced his Shamrock
Holdings Inc. was bidding for the company.
   Polaroid also created an employee stock ownership plan,
repurchased shares and sold shares to a sympathetic third party in
an effort to fend off Shamrock. Shamrock recently said it was
selling back its nearly 5 million shares to the company.

<HEAD>Wang Trims Work Force By 880</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOWELL, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wang Laboratories Inc. has cut 880 people
from its worldwide work force and will continue to trim, a company
spokesman said Thursday.
   The Boston Globe reported Monday that the computer company is
also considering a write-down of some underperforming corporate
assets, but spokesman Joseph Roy would not comment.
   ``In November, we put in a hiring `frost,''' Roy said, pointing
out that the action was not a complete hiring freeze. ``As people
leave, we don't replace most people, except for crucial jobs.''
   Roy said Wang's payroll employees worldwide had dropped from
31,391 on Dec. 31 to approximately 30,700 at the end of February.
In addition, the company laid off 180 field-service engineers last
week, Roy said.
   ``We believe we can work the numbers down quite a bit without
terminations,'' Roy told the newspaper. ``Attrition has worked
well, but not well enough. We can't rule out further adjustments.''
   Analysts have been encouraging the company to cut costs. Jay P.
Stevens, who follows the company for Dean Witter Reynolds, said
Wang's general and administrative costs are ``outrageously high,
among the highest in the computer industry.''

   Copper futures prices soared Wednesday, recovering from five
consecutive declining sessions, and the stabilized U.S. dollar sent
gold prices lower on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   On other futures markets, prices for soybeans advanced, grains
were mixed, cattle were higher and pork declined.
   Although the trading volume was light, May copper shot up 190
points during the Comex session, then settled 90 points higher,
after falling 570 points on Monday. A point is one-hundredth of a
cent.
   Metals analyst George Anagnos of Thomson Mckinnon Securities
Inc. said the rally stemmed partly from the belief that the market
has been oversold. He also said prices rose because production has
declined and demand is rising.
   Gold and silver future prices slumped in response to what
strategists called a respectable performance by the U.S. dollar
against foreign currencies, Anagnos said.
   Precious metals usually move in the opposite direction of the
dollar.
   Copper settled .40 cents to 1.55 cents higher, with the contract
for delivery in April at $1.29.85 a pound; gold was $2.30 to $3.20
lower, with April at $383.80 a troy ounce; and silver was 1.5 cents
to 4.0 cents lower, with April at $5.80 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices tumbled on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Unleaded gasoline prices were down the 200-point limit in the
most active months, inciting a selling spree in crude oil futures
and heating oil.
   Analysts believe that last week's rally was overdone, and this
week's activity is a technical correction for the market.
   Crude oil settled 43 cents to 58 cents lower, with the contract
for delivery in May at $19.99 a barrel; heating oil was 1.47 cents
to 2.01 cents lower, with May at $1.63 a gallon; and unleaded
gasoline was 1.54 cents to 3.03 cents lower, with May at 66.43
cents a gallon.
   Soybean futures prices climbed higher while grains were mixed on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   After opening lower, soybeans strengthened, bolstered by large
buying orders, and finished up to 8 cents higher for the May 1990
contract.
   Ted Mao, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said traders
believed soy futures had been ovbersold during Monday's selloff, a
reaction to reports of excessive supplies.
   Rumors of new soy-oil export sales also spurred soybean buying,
traders said.
   Katharina Zimmer of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets said corn
prices were strengthened by recent Soviet purchases and wheat
prices rose because of dry-weather forecasts.
   Wheat settled 2 cents lower to 3 cents higher, with the contract
for delivery in May at $4.04\ a bushel; corn was } cent lower to 2
cents higher, with May at $2.64 a bushel; oats were 4\ cents to 5
cents lower, with May at $1.83 a bushel; and soybeans were \ cents
to 8 cents higher, with May at $7.17 a bushel.
   Most cattle futures prices were higher while most pork prices
fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Paul Hare of Linnco Futures Inc. said cattle's strong recovery
from four losing sessions was generally due to internal market
influences.
   Cattle settled .10 cent lower to .62 cent higher, with the
contract for delivery in April at 78.17 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .30 cent to .57 cent higher, with April at 79.87 cents
a pound; live hogs were .03 cent lower to .20 cent higher, with
April at 40.57 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .80 cent
lower to .15 cent higher, with May at 35.00 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Utility Bids $2.35 Billion For PSNH</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MOKRZYCKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Massachusetts utility Wednesday became
the second bidder for Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, making
an offer it says would be worth $2.35 billion if the Seabrook
nuclear power plant operates commercially.
   New England Electric System of Westboro, which already serves
60,000 New Hampshire customers through its Granite Electric Co.,
offered $1.4 billion if Seabrook never overcomes
evacuation-planning and financial obstacles to a commercial license.
   Public Service, the lead Seabrook owner with a 36 percent share
of the $5.9 billion project, sought protection under the bankruptcy
laws 14 months ago because of the plant's licensing delays.
   Public Service is exploring a sale of its assets as one possible
reorganization option. Whatever it decides to do will be subject to
bankruptcy court approval.
   In January, Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities, New England's
largest power company, announced a bid it said would be worth $2
billion if Seabrook runs and $1.2 billion if it doesn't.
   Both proposals would spin off Public Service's 36 percent
Seabrook share into a separate company from which the reorganized
utility would buy power if the reactor operates.
   At a news conference, New England Electric president John Rowe
said his company's bid would offer greater return for Public
Service investors and lower rates for its 360,000 customers than
Northeast's offer and Public Service's own reorganization proposal.
   Rowe called his proposal ``a kinder, gentler acquisition _
kinder to investors and gentler to customers.''
   Like the Northeast proposal, New England Electric would keep
Public Service under New Hampshire regulation. Public Service has
proposed seeking federal regulation to bypass a state law that bars
it from charging ratepayers for Seabrook before it operates
commercially. However, the company also is negotiating with its
creditors and the state on a rate plan that could leave the utility
independent and state-regulated.
   Rowe would not provide specifics on which creditors would get
what under his company's offer.
   ``Our interest is in making the largest pie for investors with
the smallest amount of cooking ingredients from the customers,''
Rowe said. ``How the pie is cut, we'll let the investors decide.''
   However, Rowe speculated that Public Service debenture holders
and stockholders likely would get most or all of the new Seabrook
company. Northeast has said unsecured creditors would get the
Seabrook share and stockholders would have to negotiate with them
for a piece of it.
   Jim Neidhart, chairman of the Public Service unsecured creditors
committee, called the New England Electric bid ``a substantial
improvement'' over Northeast's offer.
   However, Neidhart said by telephone from New York, ``We're
concerned about any deals that in effect orphans Seabrook'' and
gives debenture holders a return only if the plant operates.
   Richard Tilton, lawyer for Public Service's preferred and common
stockholders, said the new offer ``has many problems but is a good
starting point.'' He said it demonstrates that Northeast's bid was
not serious.
   While saying he is ``quite concerned'' about the Seabrook
spinoff proposal, Tilton said that ``NEES' attitude is more likely
to lead to a consensual plan than the NU approach of trying to wipe
out the shareholders.''
   But Bob Busch, Northeast's chief financial officer, said in a
telephone interview that ``Based on a very preliminary analysis we
feel quite comfortable with our (bidding) position with respect to
NEES's offer.''
   He would not say whether his company's bid is worth more than
New England Electric's, however.
   ``It's pretty difficult to determine how much real additional
value is there versus what just looks good,'' Busch said of the new
bid.
   Public Service President John Duffett said the new offer was
``another step toward recognizing proper value for PSNH.''
   But Duffett expected more offers would be made, and said, ``We
have an obligation to give those proposals due consideration before
we decide if the sale of the company is the best option for
emerging from bankruptcy.''
   Larry Smukler, senior assistant attorney general and the state's
lead negotiator in rate talks with Public Service, said New England
Electric and Northeast are qualified to take over the utility.
   ``Both of them are talking about rates that are higher than what
the state has been talking about, but ... if they make a deal and
want to negotiate with us, we'll negotiate with them,'' Smukler
said.

   The dollar moved moderately higher Wednesday
against major foreign currencies in what analysts called a
technical adjustment following its recent slump.
   Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid of $383.30 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from
$385.90 late Tuesday.
   Wednesday's modest gains at least temporarily ended the dollar's
decline, which began last week. At that time, the central banks of
several nations intervened in the foreign exchange markets to bring
the U.S. currency lower.
   But Ronald Holzer, chief foreign exchange dealer with Harris
Trust &amp; Savings Bank in Chicago, said the dollar's advance
Wednesday was a minor adjustment and that the currency's outlook
remained bearish, partly because the seven major industrial nations
have restated their desire for stable interest rates.
   The seven nations _ the United States, Britain, France, West
Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada _ believe the dollar has been too
strong recently.
   Holzer said the focus of trading Wednesday was the West German
mark, which enjoyed strong advances against most currencies.
   However, the dollar managed to rise against the West German
currency, closing in New York at 1.8695 marks, up from late
Tuesday's 1.86835 marks. In earlier Frankfurt trading, the dollar
rose to 1.8695 marks from 1.8670 marks.
   Overseas dealers said market activity was quiet as traders
awaited Friday's U.S. unemployment figures for March which could
give some fresh insight into the direction of the American economy.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7028 late Wednesday,
cheaper for buyers than Tuesday's late rate of $1.7043. In New
York, sterling fell to $1.7030 from late Tuesday's $1.7085.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's prices, included: 1.64125 Swiss francs, up from 1.63075;
6.3090 French francs, up from 6.3060; 1,371.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,370.375; and 1.19075 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18655.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with
Tuesday's late rates included: 1.6395 Swiss francs, up from 1.6358;
6.3150 French francs, up from 6.3100; 2.1125 Dutch guilders, up
from 2.1080; 1,372.50 Italian lire, down from 1,372.75, and 1.1895
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1875.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 131.37 Japanese yen, up
from 131.05 yen. In London, the dollar traded higher at 131.70 yen,
and it rose to 131.555 yen in New York from late Tuesday's 130.85
yen.
   Gold was bid at $383.50 a troy ounce in London, down from
$386.75 an ounce late Tuesday. The Zurich late bid price was
$383.35 an ounce, down from $386.50 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, gold traded unchanged in Hong Kong at a bid of $387.25
an ounce.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold for
current delivery fell to $383.80 from late Tuesday's $385.90.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid of $5.83 a troy
ounce, down from $5.84 late Tuesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange, silver for current deleivery closed
at $5.816 a troy ounce, up from $5.801 late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Davis Says He'd Put Equity Into Northwest Airlines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock of NWA Inc. rose sharply Wednesday
following an announcement by oil mogul Marvin Davis that his $2.62
billion proposal to buy the parent of Northwest Airlines would not
require selling the carriers' ``strategic assets.''
   ``We do not intend to `bust up' the company, and our planned
financing will not necessitate the sale of any of the company's
strategic assets,'' Davis said in a letter dated Tuesday to NWA's
board of directors.
   The Los Angeles-based billionaire, who owns about 3 percent of
NWA's 29.1 million shares, released the letter Wednesday to the
media. A spokesman for the nation's fourth largest air carrier
confirmed receipt of the letter, but said the company would not
comment.
   ``With the equity we are prepared to commit and the anticipated
structure of the balance of the financing, the company's projected
cash flow is adequate to service the debt involved,'' the letter
said.
   NWA stock rose $3.50 a share to an all-time high of $87.25 on
the New York Stock Exchange. More than 2.5 million shares traded
hands.
   Davis, whose holdings include real estate and entertainment
properties, offered to pay $90 a share for NWA stock in a letter
last week to company directors.
   In his second letter, Davis said his group is ``prepared to
increase the price of our offer in the context of a negotiated
transaction.''
   Northwest Chairman Steven Rothmeier has said the board of
directors will review the offer, but he has not said when the board
will meet.
   The airline also said it intends to remain independent and state
officials have rallied behind the carrier, introducing legislation
intended to thwart a hostile takeover.
   In Washington, Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich and Rep. James
Oberstar, D-Minn., met with Northwest representatives and spoke
later by telephone with Davis, and told reporters they still
opposed the billionaire's offer.
   Perpich, a Democrat, and Oberstar, chairman of the House
aviation subcommittee, said they were still worried that Davis
would have to sell parts of the airline to finance the deal. They
said that might result in layoffs and in Northwest moving its
service hub from Minneapolis' airport.
   ``I want to see his prospective balance sheet,'' Oberstar said.
   Said Perpich: ``How can you guarantee that what they say
verbally ... they'll follow through'' on.
   Guy Cook, chairman of International Association of Machinists
District Lodge 143, said he remains ``suspicious'' of Davis' offer
because Davis has not provided specifics about how he would finance
the takeover.
   ``I believe he has a history of buying and selling companies,''
said Cook, who heads the union representing two-thirds of
Northwest's 35,000 employees. ``He has ownership for a period of
time and then he sells it off.''
   Kurt Rivard, an analyst for Minneapolis-based Dain Bosworth
Inc., said the increase in the stock price Wednesday suggests
confidence on the part of investors that a higher bid is on its way.
   ``It could come from Davis, it could come from Northwest, it
could come from somewhere else,'' Rivard said.
   Before Davis made his offer to Northwest, the company disclosed
a separate group of investors was interested in buying NWA. The
identity of that group, which owns 4.9 percent of the stock, has
not been disclosed.
   Davis repeated in his letter an earlier statement that he
intends to expand the airline's domestic and international routes
and keep the headquarters in Minnesota. He also said his plans call
for ``no employee layoffs, workforce reductions or alterations in
seniority schedules.''
   The letter said Northwest management would be retained in the
event of a takeover, but the letter also said, ``we intend to
effect only those management changes required to improve NWA's
performance.''
   ``Since we have no current airline operations, there are no
redundancies or overlaps that would require layoffs or similar
employee reductions,'' the letter said. ``We wish to buy NWA to
operate and expand it.''
   Analysts have said takeover debt could impair Northwest's fleet
modernization plans because Davis would have to sell assets and cut
operating costs to service takeover debt. But Davis said in his
letter that the acquisition plan ``in no way calls for the
reduction of the company's present capital investment program'' or
``maintenance-related matters.''
   In other developments, contract talks continued Wednesday
between Northwest and its 5,000-member pilots' union.
   Northwest has discussed profit-sharing and stock ownership plans
with its unions for more than a year. Analysts have said an
employee stock ownership plan could help the carrier defend itself
against a takeover by putting more stock in friendly hands.
   Meanwhile, state Commerce Commissioner Michael Hatch told the
St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch that he is investigating the
possibility of stock manipulation in connection with takeover bids
for Northwest. But Hatch said the inquiry is not based on any
specific allegations.

<HEAD>Investor Simmons Reduces Lockheed Stake to 4.2 Pct</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>

   Dallas investor Harold Simmons revealed
Wednesday he cut his stake in Lockheed Corp. a day after the maker
of the stealth fighter plane buttressed its takeover defenses.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Simmons
said he had sold 200,000 shares of recently acquired Lockheed
stock, cutting his holdings in the aerospace company from 5.3
percent to 4.2 percent.
   Officials at Lockheed headquarters in this Los Angeles suburb
refused to comment on Simmons' announcement, which came one day
after the company created an employee stock ownership plan that
would have deterred a hostile takeover.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Lockheed fell $1.12{
a share to $46.62{.
   Analysts suggested Simmons had considered a buyout bid, but gave
up because of the new ESOP would put 17 percent of Lockheed stock
in employees' hands. That would effectively block a takeover
because in Delaware, where the company is incorporated, a buyout
must be approved by holders of 85 percent of the stock.
   ``Basically, Lockheed put him in a box,'' said analyst Harold
Rubel, who follows the company for Cyrus J. Lawrence in New York.
``Simmons was out-and-out attempting to put the company into play
and management did the right thing.''
   In the filing, Simmons said he sold the shares ``in light of the
performance of the shares in the market and current developments
involving the company, including the company's sale of shares to an
employee stock ownership plan.''
   The investor, who made the purchases through his Valhi Inc.,
said in the filing he would still consider future investments in
Lockheed.
   When he revealed his investment Monday, Simmons said he didn't
intend to try buying the whole company.
   Lockheed said in announcing the ESOP that it wasn't responding
to a possible takeover bid by Simmons. The plan was intended to
boost employee performance by building their stake in the company,
and was part of an overall restructuring by the new chairman and
chief executive, Daniel Tellep.
   Included in the restructuring was acceleration of previously
announced plans to move the top secret ``Skunk Works'' aircraft
plant and other manufacturing operations from buildings next to
Burbank Airport to Palmdale and Rye Valley, Calif., and Marietta,
Ga. The factories employ 7,000 people.
   The moves would free 225 acres of land at the airport for sale
in 1991 rather than in 1992 or 1993, as previously planned.
   Lockheed also said it would sell its computer operations over a
period of time. The operations, CADAM Inc. in Burbank, CalComp in
Anaheim, Metier Inc. in Houston and Lockheed DataPlan Inc. in Los
Gatos, employ 3,900.
   ``I'm assuming he wasn't too happy with what they did, so he
took his profit and took part of his money and left,'' said John
Simon, who follows Lockheed for Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in
Los Angeles.
   In addition to the radar-evading fighter plane, Lockheed makes
the Trident II missile, the C-5A military transport plane, and
works on NASA's space station, among other government and private
industry projects.

   Coal miners in two states struck The
Pittston Co. Wednesday after working 14 months without a contract.
   The strike affects 1,600 members of the United Mine Workers
union in Virginia and West Virginia. Other Pittston employees in
Kentucky remained on the job, the union said.
   ``There's a series of decisons being made about our miners in
Kentucky and a couple of different groups _ locals _ in Virginia,''
UMW spokesman Joe Corcoran said. ``The decision not to strike them
right now could be short-lived.''
   Jackie Stump, president of the UMW's Virginia district in
Castlewood, said he was not optimistic.
   ``We hope that it's settled early, but we have been telling
people they may be on strike for a year or two years _ whatever it
takes,'' Stump said.
   UMW President Richard Trumka announced the strike Wednesday
morning. In a news release from the union's Washington
headquarters, Trumka said, ``The UMW has gone the extra mile to
avoid a strike and to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with
the company both before and since the expiration of our contract
with Pittston.
   ``But Pittston's response _ an endless stream of labor law
violations and broken promises _ has been antagonistic from the
start.''
   Michael Odom, president of Pittston's coal operations, said in a
statement: ``It is unfortunate that the union has called a strike
againt the company which will undoubtedly cause much disruption and
hardship for our employees and the coalfield communities.''
   Odom also said the company will begin hiring replacement workers
where needed.
   Besides representing the strikers, the UMW represents
approximately 4,000 laid off Pittston employees and 1,500 Pittston
retirees.
   The union's contract with Pittston expired Feb. 1, 1988, after
the coal company refused to sign the national coal contract agreed
to by most major producers.
   Pittston is the nation's 15th largest coal producer and the
second largest exporter of coal.

<TEXT>
   His roots in the travel industry go deep, but Peter V. Ueberroth
_ leader of a group that wants to buy Eastern Airlines _ made his
reputation as the man who made the Olympics and major league
baseball profitable.
   Ueberroth, 51, already had founded a hugely successful travel
business by the time he rose to prominence as president of the Los
Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee, the group responsible for
staging what generally had been a money-losing enterprise.
   The 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, expected to lose money or at best
break even, made $230 million.
   Major league owners made him baseball commissioner in 1985,
following a season in which the 26 teams reported losing $40
million on revenue of $625 million, the industry's 11th consecutive
losing year.
   Ueberroth cut the losses to $6 million in his first year and
baseball made $12 million in 1986, according to financial reports
obtained by the Associated Press. In 1987, baseball made a record
$103 million and preliminary figures for 1988 show a $100 million
profit on record revenue of $977 million.
   He also acted aggressively in helping end umpires and players
strikes and negotiating a $1 billion television package for
baseball.
   Detractors say the golden image isn't totally warranted,
claiming Ueberroth made the Olympics profitable by using huge
numbers of volunteers who worked for free.
   They also point to deteriorating labor relations in baseball at
the time of his departure, which have raised the specter of a
strike next year, and the possibility of hundreds of millions of
dollars in judgments against owners, stemming from collusion in
closing the free-agent market.
   Regardless, business success was old hat for Ueberroth even
before the Olympics and baseball, which he officially left on April
1.
   He was vice president of Trans International Airlines for two
years when, in 1963, he founded a small travel agency in Southern
California. Eventually, he built First Travel Corp. into the
second-largest business of its kind in North America and sold it in
1979 for $10.6 million, earning $4.4 million personally.
   During his baseball tenure, Ueberroth stayed active in other
businesses. He is a director of several major corporations and, as
a director of E.F. Hutton Inc., helped engineer the investment
firm's sale to Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   His reputation as a man with a golden business touch has put him
in demand for other high-profile jobs.
   The National Republican Senatorial Committee wanted him in 1986
to run for office, but he said he wasn't a politician _ shaking
hands and kissing babies wasn't his style.
   Ueberroth also turned down recent offers for the chief executive
officer's posts at MGM Pictures Inc. and RJR Nabisco Inc.
   ``I didn't think I'd make enough of a difference,'' he said.
   Friends say the challenge of turning around Eastern, which has
been wracked by financial losses and labor unrest for years,
intrigues him.
   But Ueberroth's high-profile financial wizardry contrasts
somewhat with a low-profile personal style that some might even
call bland.
   He works in short-sleeve shirts, not suits, at his 17th-floor
office on Park Avenue. He walks carefully, not confidently, speaks
softly, and has employees who call him ``Peter'' not ``Mr.''
   ``I'm shy, but I think you can be shy and ruthless at the same
time,'' he once said.

<TEXT>
   Informal talks seeking a compromise accord on
liberalizing world trade in four key areas were mired Wednesday by
continuing disagreements over agricultural subsidies, trade
officials said.
   The talks held under the auspices of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, GATT, officially opened Wednesday morning but
were adjourned after one hour to allow more time for informal
discussions to reach a compromise on agriculture, intellectual
property, textiles and GATT escape clauses.
   It is recognized that agreement on agriculture is fundamental to
consensus being reached in Geneva on the other three outstanding
issues.
   ``We will have a final agreement on all four or none,'' said
Karl Falkenberg, a spokesman for the European Economic Community
delegation.
   In his opening speech at the morning plenary session GATT
Director-General Arthur Dunkel said that agreement on an
agricultural package was near.
   But eight hours of informal talks ended in disagreement between
the EEC, the United States and the so-called Cairns free-trade
group over short-term measures to freeze agricultural production
and subsidies.
   Differences between the EEC and the United States on farm policy
caused stalemate at GATT's ministerial talks in Montreal in
December.
   ``The problem appears to be the same as it was in Montreal,''
said Rubens Ricupero, head of the Brazilian delegation.
   Dunkel, who heads the 96-nation trade forum, was expected to
spend Wednesday night drafting a new set of compromise proposals to
present to GATT's plenary session Thursday morning, officials said.
   Negotiators refused to speculate on the consequences of failure
to reach agreement at the negotiations, scheduled to end Friday.

<HEAD>Former SEC Chairman Has Drexel Office, But No Job</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Predators Ball Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The former head of the Securities and Exchange
Commission has moved into an office at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
but hasn't yet formally accepted the chairman's job, the troubled
investment firm said Wednesday.
   John S.R. Shad, who ordered the government's huge securities
fraud investigation of Drexel in 1986, has been working out of an
executive suite at the Wall Street firm for several weeks, Drexel
spokesman Steven Anreder said.
   Drexel, seeking to repair its image after agreeing to a record
$650 million settlement with the government for a range of criminal
securities law violations, offered Shad the post in January.
   The nation's fifth-largest investment firm currently is
negotiating with the SEC to settle separate civil charges that
include insider trading.
   Shad, 65, resigned later in January as U.S. ambassador to the
Netherlands, where he served from June 1987. He ran the SEC, the
federal agency that regulates the nation's securities markerts,
from 1981 to 1987.
   Anreder said Shad would not decide whether to accept the Drexel
chairman's job permanently until after the SEC settlement is
completed. The deal has been expected for months but negotiations
recently deadlocked.
   Anreder would not say whether Shad was waiting for the SEC talks
to end to avoid a possible conflict of interest. The spokesman also
said he didn't know whether Shad was getting paid.
   ``He has indicated all along he would wait until the SEC
settlement is in place. He set that as one of his requirements,''
he said.
   If Shad accepts the job, it would mark an ironic twist in the
legal battle. He ordered the massive government probe of Drexel in
late 1986 after Drexel was implicated in widespread wrongdoing by
former speculator Ivan F. Boesky, who is now serving a three-year
jail term.
   In addition, Drexel's chief executive officer, Frederick Joseph
was once hired by Shad 20 years ago when Shad ran the now-defunct
investment firm E.F. Hutton &amp; Co.
   Shad was out of the office and unavailable for comment, a
secretary answering his telephone said.
   Anreder would not specify Shad's activities in the office, but
said he was ``familiarizing himself with the firm, people, doing
the things one does in that process.''
   ``He is not working for the firm,'' Anreder said. ``He's been
examining the firm, getting to know it, doing his own kind of
analysis.''

<HEAD>Eds: TOPS with 7 grafs saying Milken was invited to private dinner

representatives ...</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The ``Predators Ball'' opened
Wednesday with what amounted to an empty spot at the head table:
   Junk bond guru Michael Milken was missing from the official
agenda for the annual Drexel Burnham Lambert conference he founded
11 years ago, and was even forbidden to attend a dinner after
Wednesday's festivities.
   Milken, who was charged last week with 98 counts of securities
fraud and racketeering in connection with alleged trading
violations, is on a forced leave of absence from Drexel.
   A Drexel employee had him on the guest list for one of several
unofficial dinners that accompany the meeting, but canceled the
invitation Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the
situation, who commented on condition of anonymity.
   Drexel officials feared Milken's presence could threaten the
company's $650 million plea bargain to federal felony securities
fraud charges, the source said. Part of that deal, which has yet to
be signed, bar Drexel officials from business contacts with the
indicted trader.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder, asked to comment, said only:
``Originally he was supposed to speak at some kind of a meeting and
our lawyers advised against it because they thought it would be
inappropriate.''
   Milken was far from forgotten at the 3{-day series of meetings
and bond sales pitches at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. Drexel calls it
the 11th annual Institutional Research Conference; the name favored
by the media comes from corporate raiders who sell junk bonds to
raise funds for their exploits.
   Drexel representatives said the record attendance of 3,000
proved Milken wasn't really the main drawing card.
   But his evangelistic speeches and dynamic presence are missed by
many, said Ralph Rosenberg, chairman of Longview Capital Corp. of
Miami.
   ``I think a lot of people turned out as a tribute to Mike,''
Rosenberg said Wednesday.
   Milken's successor as head of Drexel's Beverly Hills-based,
high-yield bond department, John Kissick, paid homage to his
indicted predecessor, offering ``our honest wishes for success'' in
defending himself. But he emphasized the unspoken theme: Even
without the dynamic trader, Drexel intends to remain a powerhouse
in the junk bond market, which to date totals $183 billion.
   ``Drexel remains committed to maintaining the high quality of
this market as we move ahead,'' Kissick said in opening the
conference before a standing-room-only crowd.
   Junk bonds, so-called because the companies that issue them are
deemed among the less creditworthy by the agencies that rate
corporate bonds, pay their buyers more interest than the highly
rated bonds of blue-chip companies. Milken is credited with
popularizing the idea over the last decade or so that such bonds
are a good investment, thus making it possible to finance growing
businesses and fund corporate takeovers with the bonds.
   The Predators Ball may be more a meeting than a party, but it's
no bankers' convention. It begins each day at 6:50 a.m. _ regular
business hours for Wall Street-oriented West Coast residents like
the hard-charging Milken.
   The absent trader's stamp was evident elsewhere. He often speaks
of the importance of education, as did the morning's inspirational
speaker, Jaime Escalante, whose success teaching calculus to poor
East Los Angeles high-school students was the basis for the movie
``Stand and Deliver.''
   The business sessions, which are closed to the press, include
pitches by companies and investors selling high-yield bonds and
talks on such topics as bankruptcy and savings and loan investment
opportunities.
   Among the presenters are RJR Nabisco Inc., Braniff Inc., media
entrepreneur Ted Turner and Valhi Inc., the investment vehicle for
Dallas investor Harold Simmons.
   But more important, said many, is the chance to mingle with
fellow entrepreneurs, investors and potential business partners.
   Patrick Tillieux, who deals in mergers and acquisitions for
Bouygues SA, a French construction and entertainment company, came
to the conference to see how Americans handle leveraged buyouts _
and to soak up the high-powered atmosphere.
   ``We do not come for Michael Milken,'' Tillieux said. ``It's the
show.''
   As is typical of corporate ``roadshows'' for investors, some of
the presentations included such inducements as tote bags and
dancers dressed as Lifesavers candy.
   Not to be outdone in the gimmick department, Drexel erected a
10-foot-tall model of a space station in the hotel lobby. The
revolving model suggested an orbiting outpost of free enterprise,
bearing model buildings emblazoned with the logos of such junk-bond
issuers as Budget Rent-a-Car and AMC Theaters.
   Gray-suited conferees listened, apparently nonplussed, as a
repeating soundtrack on the space station intespersed pep talks on
the joys of junk bonds with altered versions of two pop-rock songs.
Stevie Winwood's ``Higher Love'' came out ``Life with a higher
yield'' and the Jefferson Starship hit ``We Built this City (on
Rock nd Roll)'' transformed into ``We built this city on high-yield
bonds.''

   Polaroid Corp. was looking through the wrong end
of the viewfinder Wednesday when it said it was the only
photographic company on a list of the 25 most respected brand names
in the world.
   Polaroid's Carl J. Yankowski cited a study on corporate names by
Landor Associates to back his contention that favorable name
recognition would help sales of its new OneFilm conventional film.
   But according to Landor Associates of San Francisco, there were
a few problems with Polaroid's interpretation of its findings:
   _Canon Inc., a photographic company, was in the top 25 at No.
23, one notch behind Polaroid.
   _Eastman Kodak Co. was not on the list only because it was not
included in the European portion of the 3,000-person survey. Kodak
finished ahead of Polaroid in both the United States and Japan.
   _Esteem was only half of what Landor counted in its rankings.
The other half was simple name recognition, or what Landor calls
``share of mind.''
   The mistakes appeared to be the result of oversimplification,
not deception. Polaroid spokeswoman Marcia Phillips said the
company simply wanted to make the point that it had a good image
worldwide.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Department of Transportation has
rejected requests from United and American airlines to establish
non-stop flights from Chicago to Tokyo, officials said Wednesday.
   But the agency left the airlines the option to re-apply for the
routes, and said in a statement that U.S. officials would discuss
the expansion of non-stop air service between the cities in trade
talks with Japan next month.
   The talks, in Tokyo, will discuss possible revisions of the
United States-Japan Air Transport Agreement of 1952, which, with
amendments, dictates what air routes are open, the Transportation
Department said in an order issued Tuesday.
   ``We remain sensitive ... to the issues raised by the
applications (from the airlines) and we are prepared to discuss
them with Japan during the next round of negotiations,'' said the
order issued in Washington.
   Currently, non-stop Chicago-to-Tokyo flights are provided only
by Minneapolis-based Northwest Airlines and Japan Air lines, said
Russell Mack, a spokesman for Chicago-based United.
   Mack said the ``principal focus'' of the talks beginning May 15
between the two governments will be the Chicago-to-Tokyo direct
routes, which is considered good news by the airline.
   ``The May 15 talks will be absolutely critical to U.S.
competitiveness,'' a United statement said. ``They are a priceless
opportunity for this administration to take concrete action on its
stated pledge to help redress the U.S. trade imbalance with Japan.''
   ``Air service between Chicago and Japan has not kept pace with
the growth in the U.S.-Japan market,'' Mack said.
   He said Asian routes are coveted because ``the Pacific is the
fastest-growing aviation market in the world.''
   United already has daily non-stop flights to Tokyo from New
York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alternative operator services for telephones
in the nation's airports, hotels, hospitals and other public places
are benefiting consumers by forcing American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co. to improve service, Congress was told Wednesday.
   Harvey M. Berg, a member of the board of directors of the
Operator Service Providers of America, also said the advent of such
companies has led to new services.
   Berg, in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce
telecommunications and finance subcommittee, acknowledged problems
in his industry, where customers have complained of charges two to
three times those of AT&amp;T and of call ``blocking'' that doesn't
allow customers to use the long-distance carriers of their choice
for credit card or operator assisted calls.
   His group ``does not condone consumer abuses but, rather, has
acted to correct them,'' Berg said. Since its formation in April
1988, he said, ``the rate of complaints to regulators has fallen''
and ``rates have receded substantially. ... The marketplace is
working.''
   The Federal Communications Commission has received more than
2,000 complaints about ``AOS'' services from customers who often
don't know whom they're dealing with or why they get high bills
from cities they've never visited.
   And some legislators fear the situation will get worse because
of a federal judge's ruling that required all owners of hotels,
restaurants and other public places to decide by April 1 who should
provide their long-distance pay phone service.
   The companies that own and operate the phones pay commissions to
the premise owners to use their services.
   The FCC last month ordered restrictions on AOS companies that
included notices of who the AOS provider is and how to find out
rates, a ban on call blocking and a requirement that the alternate
operator connect the caller with the long-distance carrier of his
choice.
   However, the FCC did not impose price restrictions on AOS
companies.
   The House subcommittee heard testimony from a number of
witnesses on a bill by Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., that would order
the FCC to impose restrictions on AOS companies, including a
guarantee that they charge ``just and reasonable'' rates.
   The Cooper bill says that if a customer uses the credit card of
a long-distance carrier, the charge from the AOS company may not
exceed the carrier's rates.
   Berg opposed the legislation, as did Gerald Hines of AT&amp;T, who
said the company favored the FCC's approach.
   Consumer group representatives favored the bill, and Steve
Hewlett, commissioner of the Tennessee Public Service Commission,
said price caps were needed.
   Dennis Thomas, a board member of the nation's largest AOS
company, International Telecharge, said legislation was not needed
in light of the FCC order, but if a bill were passed it should seek
to ``address the inequalities of cost and business opportunity that
today discriminate in favor of AT&amp;T and impair other competitors.''
   Gerald Brock, chief of the FCC's common carrier bureau, also
said many of the bill's provisions were contained in the FCC order
last month.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
200,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery this year under a
long-term supply agreement, the Agriculture Department said
Wednesday.
   More than 2.3 million tons have been purchased since the Soviets
resumed buying U.S. corn on March 28 after a layoff of almost three
months.
   The corn is scheduled for delivery by Sept. 30, the end of the
sixth year of a long-term grain supply agreement between the Soviet
Union and the United States.
   Officials said the latest sales brought total corn sold to the
Soviets for 1988-89 to more than 12.5 million tons. Additionally,
sales include 4 million tons of wheat, 450,000 tons of soybeans,
1.4 million tons of soybean meal, and 507,400 tons of grain sorghum.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 200,000 tons of
corn would be about 7.9 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.46 per bushel at the
farm level, according to the latest USDA five-day average, meaning
that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $20 million.

   Gerber Products Co., the world's largest
baby-food maker, said Wednesday that Alfred A. Piergallini, a
senior vice president at Carnation Co., will become its president
and chief operating officer.
   ``I expect him to provide strong operating leadership to our
growing Gerber business and also to serve as my long-range backup
to ensure continuity of Gerber management during the next decade
and beyond,'' said David W. Johnson, Gerber's board chairman and
chief executive officer.
   Johnson, 57, had held the title of president. Gerber had no
chief operating officer. The appointment is effective April 17.
   Piergallini, 42, began his business career as a marketing
trainee at Procter &amp; Gamble Co. in 1970.
   In 1976, he joined Beverage Management Inc. as marketing
planning manager, and in 1979 he joined Sara Lee Corp. as vice
president and general manager of the midwest region for Shasta
Beverages.
   He joined Carnation in 1986 as vice president and general
manager of the Friskies Pet Care division, and was promoted to
senior vice president in 1987.
   Gerber reported earnings of $21.2 million on sales of $943
million for its fiscal year ended March 31, 1988.

<HEAD>Shearson Plan For Recapitalization Perplexing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARNOLD STAPLETON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major Wall Street investment firm has submitted
a recapitalization plan for MCorp that would reassemble the giant
bank holding company, but federal regulators, who last week took
over 20 of the company's 25 banks, said Wednesday the plan is not
``in front of us.''
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which holds a sizable chunk of
MCorp's outstanding debt and has been leading a creditors' group,
submitted the plan Sunday, vice president Steve Faigen said
Wednesday.
   The plan, which was drawn up prior to the government seizure of
the insolvent MBanks, would combine the failed banks with the five
solvent institutions left under the bank holding company's control,
Faigen said.
   Alan Whitney, spokesman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
in Washington, said Shearson's recapitalization plan was viable
only if the government had not seized the insolvent banks last
week, forming the government-owned Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank.
   ``So, as far as we're concerned, we have no proposal in front of
us'' from the Shearson group, Whitney said in a telephone interview.
   Faigen declined to say if the proposal was an ``active bid'' for
the remaining banks. Asked about Whitney's statement, Faigen said,
``I don't want to be drawn into characterizing their actions.''
   ``All I can say is that the creditors group submitted for FDIC
review a recapitalization plan based on MCorp's situation prior to
the actions taken by the regulators last week,'' he said.
   The Shearson bid included another New York securities firm,
Kleinwort Benson Ltd., Faigen said.
   Whitney said federal regulators were considering several offers
for the bridge bank, but he would not say how many.
   ``I can simply say we've been contacted by several parties who
have a legitimate interest in talking with us about some kind of
transaction,'' he said.
   Whitney said federal regulators have not discussed any
transaction involving the remaining MBanks ``because they're not in
our hands. We couldn't put those five banks into a deal at this
point anyway, because we don't own them.''
   The seizure last week came after three minor bondholders sought
to force the giant holding company into involuntary bankruptcy
because they had not been paid since last fall.
   MCorp responded by filing for voluntary reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which would protect it from
creditors' lawsuits until it could develop a plan to put its
finances in order.
   Analysts have said it could take as much as $2 billion to
recapitalize MCorp, making it the third largest bank bailout in
history. Faigen would not disclose the amount of the Shearson bid.
   Shearson holds $117 million in MCorp preferred stock and holds
MCorp debt with a face value of $30 million.
   The FDIC has been looking for a buyer for MCorp since last fall
and originally had set an April 3 deadline for receiving bids.
   Groups who reportedly expressed interest in the banks prior to
the government seizure included First City Bancorporation of Texas,
San Francisco-based Wells Fargo &amp; Co., leverage buyout specialists
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and a group affiliated with Chicago's
wealthy Pritzker family, GKH Partners.
   MCorp, once the second-largest holding company in Texas, has
been hard hit by real-estate loan losses. Last year, its banks lost
$903 million.
   MCorp was formed when Dallas-based Mercantile Texas Corp. and
Southwest Bancshares Inc. of Houston merged in 1984.

<HEAD>Administration Expands Suspension of Imports of Semiautomatic Weapons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration expanded its temporary
ban on imported semiautomatic rifles Wednesday to include virtually
all foreign-made models, expressing regret that sales of similar
American-made weapons could not be suspended by executive action.
   The step, criticized by a group of Republican lawmakers who
oppose gun control, widened a three-week old import ban to cover 24
foreign-made models missed initially, said White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater called the action, which took effect immediately, a
``midcourse correction'' on the way to longer-range measures.
   He said the new step should completely dry up the flow of
foreign-made semiautomatic weapons while an administration review
continues.
   The original suspension of imports, declared March 14 by the
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who oversees the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, covered 80 percent of the imports.
Wednesday's action was designed to get at the remaining 20 percent,
Fitzwater said.
   ``We think we've got 99.9 percent'' of the foreign-made
semiautomatic rifles, said ATF Director Stephen Higgins.
   Higgins said the bureau would try to identify additional models
that are slight variations of the banned guns to make sure they too
are covered by the 90-day prohibition. But Higgins said he expected
only a small addition to the list.
   A prime reason for the expansion, Fitzwater said, was to fill
holes in the original order that had allowed foreign gun
manufacturers not covered by the ban to gain a competitive
advantage.
   Still, Fitzwater conceded ``there is some unfairness'' in the
fact that the expanded ban still has no impact on sales of
American-made high-powered rapid-fire rifles.
   ``Unfortunately, it is not something we can do anything about,''
Fitzwater said. ``To do anything about domestically manufactured
weapons would require a change in the law,'' Fitzwater said.
   Colt Industries Inc suspended sales March 15 of its popular
AR-15 rifle, the domestically made weapon most similar to the
foreign-made assault-style rifles banned the previous day.
   Fitzwater declined to say whether seeking such a law change
would be part of President Bush's eventual decision.
   Even so, Wednesday's action represented yet another step in the
administration's toughening attitude on such weapons. Bush
initially said he opposed any efforts to outlaw the guns.
   Calls for a ban on the weapons had been prompted by scores of
drug-related shootings and the Jan. 17 slaying of five
schoolchildren and wounding of 30 others in Stockton, Calif., when
gunman Patrick Purdy opened fire on a playground.
   According to an ATF study of the guns it traces for law
enforcement agencies nationwide, the number of semiautomatic
weapons used in crimes increased 57 percent between 1986 and 1987.
   ``With respect to some of the weapons, they are turning up in
percentages which are far disproportionate to the numbers that are
in this country,'' Higgins said.
   Higgins revealed that Bush had asked him to study a proposal to
require registration of semiautomatic assault rifles. Buyers of
machine guns and other military-style weapons currently must pay a
registration fee and submit to a background check and
fingerprinting.
   CBS News reported Wednesday night that national drug control
director William J. Bennett, whom Bush had asked to recommend what
should be done about the weapons, told Bush a week ago that
``Rambo-looking rifles with a large clip'' should be treated the
same as the machine guns.
   However, Larry Cirignano, a Bennett spokesman, said, ``We never
talk about what we recommend to the president,'' but added that the
network report was ``not an accurate depiction'' of Bennett's views.
   A group of Republican lawmakers who oppose gun control protested
the action during a meeting with White House chief of staff John
Sununu.
   ``Most of us felt the action today solves no problems,'' said
Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho. ``Administratively, it's a nightmare.
Practically, it solves nothing.''
   Craig said that the action was ``a confirmation of the fact that
he (Bush) is parting company'' with gun control opponents.
   The initial ban covered five general categories of weapons and
25 specific models, including the well-known semiautomatic versions
of the AK-47 assault rifle and the Uzi carbine.
   Among the weapons added to the ban Wednesday were the Beretta
AR70 and BM59, the Australian Automatic Arms SAR.
   Higgins said foreign models account for 20 to 25 percent of the
semiautomatic rifles sold in this country. ATF estimates there are
3 million semiautomatic rifles in circulation.
   The temporary ban announced last month covered permits to import
up to 400,000 assault-style rifles and the latest announcement
involved up to 250,000 weapons, Higgins said.
   Fitzwater said that Treasury was imposing a ban on the
additional 24 weapons ``to review their suitability for sporting
purposes.''
   Under the Gun Control Act of 1968, the Treasury Department may
ban firearms imports that are not ``particularly suitable for, or
readily adaptable to, sporting purposes.''
   Meanwhile, Stockton Mayor Barbara Foss pleaded with lawmakers
Wednesday to get military-style assault weapons off America's
streets.
   ``We are asking for the same protection for our children and our
communities that you have here,'' the mayor told the House
Judiciary crime subcommittee, which is considering new restrictions
on assault weapons.
   She pointed to security screening procedures designed to detect
hidden weapons carried by visitors to the Capitol and nearby
buildings.
   The mayor told of her horror at pulling up in front of the
Cleveland school on the day of the incident and seeing ``the front
lawn of this normally quiet, neighborhood school strewn with
bodies.''
   Repercussions of the shooting are still shaking the community,
she said.
   ``I think of the mother who holds her hand over her heart to
ease the pain,'' she said. ``I think of the little boy whose sister
was killed and who implores her to return whenever the news is
replayed and he sees her on television. ... Every unknown person on
the playgrounds is now a threat. A car backfiring sends students
under their desks.''
   Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J., the subcommittee chairman, said
the lawmakers will have a tough job in striking a balance between
imposing new safeguards and maintaining the rights of legitimate
firearms owners.
   ``America has a love affair with cars and guns, and anytime we
deal with guns we generally generate more heat than light,'' Hughes
said.
   Fitzwater said, ``we want to keep our options open'' on what
next step the administration should take.
   ``There has been an educational process here, in which all of us
have learned more about these weapons _ how they are being used and
their danger,'' Fitzwater said. ``There has indeed been an
education and a heightened awareness of this issue.''
   Fitzwater said that the 90-day review of the entire subject
ordered by Bush on March 14 is moving along quickly.
   Other firearms listed by the Treasury Department as added to the
ban by Wednesday's action include: Algimec AGM-1, AR-180, CIS
SR-88, HK-91, HK-93, HK-94, AK-22, AP-74, Galil-22, G3-SA, K-1,
K-2, AR-100, M-14S, MAS-223, SIG 550SP, SIG 551SP, SKS with
detachable magazine, M16-33, Unique F-11 and Erma EM1.22.

<HEAD>Tapes Show Consultant Hounding Company in Pentagon Contract Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Government rests, inserting 1 graf after 5th graf, `He is ...'.
Also moved on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

   A consultant who had bribed a Navy
engineer for information on a big Pentagon contract hounded
executives of a defense firm for money once the company was awarded
the job, according to tape recordings played in federal court
Wednesday.
   Private consultant William Parkin also testified in person for
the prosecution against three former executives of Teledyne
Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif. _ Eugene Sullivan, George Kaub
and Dale Schnittjer _ in the trial in U.S. District Court.
   He said that he himself accepted about $50,000 in bribes in a
10-year period during the 17 years he worked for the Navy before
1983.
   Parkin, the former director of acquisition for the Navy's joint
missile project, has pleaded guilty to bribing a government
official and to other charges in the government's investigation of
Pentagon fraud and kickbacks in the $150-billion-a-year purchasing
system.
   He is cooperating with the government in the current trial of
the three former executives, who are accused of bribery, conspiracy
and making false statements.
   The government rested its case at the end of the day, opening
the way for the defense to begin calling witnesses on Thursday.
   Parkin has admitted that he indirectly paid Stuart Berlin, a
Navy engineer who also has pleaded guilty, for confidential data
about a $24 million contract that Teledyne Electronics was awarded
in July 1987. The contract called for making hand-held radar
equipment.
   Prosecutors say Parkin's arrangement with Teledyne Electronics
called for him to be paid $10,000 in November 1985 and $150,000
once the contract came through.
   In the wiretapped telephone conversations, Parkin, who worked
with private consultant Fred Lackner, who also has pleaded guilty
in the case, complained to the executives that he hadn't been paid
his $150,000 even though the firm got the contract.
   In November 1987, Parkin told Schnittjer that his associates
were upset they hadn't been paid.
   ``They feel they've done their job and they are entitled to
their just reward,'' Parkin said.
   Schnittjer replied, ``I can understand....I've been delinquent.''
   In a conversation with Sullivan, who was Schnittjer's
predecessor, Parkin complained, ``Every day I get strung along.''
   Sullivan told Parkin, ``I don't think they're giving you credit
for this.'' He added, ``As far as I know, Dale was working to take
care of this.''
   Again Parkin reiterated his situation. ``My guys keep calling
me. They want their money.''
   The government contends that the three defendants knew about a
deal that Parkin and Lackner had to pay Berlin for information. The
private consultants were working with Michael Savaides, the former
Washington marketing manager for Teledyne, according to testimony.
Savaides also has pleaded guilty to charges in the case.
   Teledyne Electronics ultimately paid the first installment,
$6,250, of the $150,000 to Parkin in March 1988. Payments ceased
shortly afterward when the federal probe known as Operation Ill
Wind was made public in June.
   Defense attorneys say their clients were in the dark about the
illegal activities.
   Under cross-examination, Parkin said that over 10 years he
collected ``about $50,000 in that period'' in bribes. He did not
elaborate on the nature of the bribes or what he did for them.
   In a soft-spoken voice, Parkin recounted persuading Teledyne
Electronics executives they needed his services to win the $24
million contract.
   Parkin acknowledged that the company ``stood a very good chance
of winning the contract'' even without his help. He also said ``it
wasn't going to be a lot'' of work that he planned to do on it.
   Detailing his work as a private consultant, Parkin said he often
bluffed in his conversations with people. ``I embellished both
ways,'' he said.

<HEAD>New Eastern Examiner Has Practiced Civil Liberties, Antitrust Law</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Eastern, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David I. Shapiro, who was appointed bankruptcy
examiner Wednesday for strikebound Eastern Airlines, is a
Washington attorney who has practiced civil liberties and antitrust
law.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland has ruled that the examiner
in the Eastern case should have unusually broad powers, including a
mandate to mediate the bitter labor dispute at the airline and get
its planes flying again.
   Shapiro, 60, is a senior partner of Dickstein, Shapiro &amp; Morin,
a law firm based in Washington. His clients have included American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., U S West, First National Bank of
Chicago, labor unions and professional associations.
   He also served as the settlement master in the Agent Orange
chemical liability trial, in which Vietnam veterans successfully
sued seven makers of the defoliant. The veterans claimed Agent
Orange, which was used to kill vegetation in Vietnam, caused
cancer, birth defects and other disabilities.
   A native of Brooklyn, N.Y., Shapiro practiced mainly civil
liberties law in the 1950s and early 1960s and successfully argued
three such cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. In more recent
years he has devoted his practice to major antitrust cases, in
which he represented about 20 states and other government entities.
   He is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin, Brooklyn
College and Brooklyn Law School.
