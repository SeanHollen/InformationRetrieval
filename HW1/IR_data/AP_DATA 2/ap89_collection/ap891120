   Congress on Monday rejected attempts to
restrict U.S. military aid to war-torn El Salvador, heeding
President Bush's admonition not to further weaken the country's
``freely, democratically elected government.''
   Amid bitter and at times personal debate, the House voted
215-194 on a procedural move that effectively kept the restrictions
from being added to a $14.6 billion foreign aid bill. The measure
includes $533 million for Poland and Hungary, and military and
economic support for U.S. friends and allies around the world.
   The House then voted 310-107 to approve the foreign aid measure
and sent it to the Senate, where a similar amendment was rejected
on a vote of 58-39. The Senate then approved the bill on a voice
vote and sent it to Bush.
   ``This is a terrible amendment,'' said Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan. ``If we pass it, we reward the communist terrorists ... and
punish the democratically elected government.''
   But the past week's violence in El Salvador appeared to have
created a shift of roughly 20 votes in the Senate since the body
voted 82-18 Sept. 20 for military aid with no conditions.
   Later, underscoring congressional outrage over last week's
murders of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter,
the House approved a non-binding resolution asserting that bringing
the killers to justice would ``be instrumental in determining
continued U.S. support'' for El Salvador. The vote was 409-3.
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said lawmakers were coming under
heavy pressure from Christian groups to take action against El
Salvador, including heavy lobbying and demonstrations at some
members' district offices.
   In Washington, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops
expressed support for proposals ``to withhold substantial portions
of military aid while the performance of the Salvadoran government
and military is tested.''
   Opponents of U.S. aid heckled Bush during an appearance in
Chicago. Others, in Washington, repeatedly interrupted Senate floor
proceedings, and Capitol police forcibly ejected several protesters
from the chamber.
   House action came just a few hours after Bush said a cutoff of
U.S. military aid to the new government of rightist President
Alfredo Cristiani would be ``absolutely unacceptable.'' A pitched
weeklong battle against the leftist FMLN guerrillas was winding
down Monday as the rebels withdrew from San Salvador into the
countryside.
   ``There is a freely elected government doing their very best
trying to get protection from these Marxist-led guerrillas coming
into the center of the city, and we support President Cristiani in
his effort to restore order,'' Bush told reporters as he boarded
Air Force One for a day of campaigning for GOP candidates.
   ``This is not the time to undermine a fragile democracy that is
under attack ... It's totally unacceptable, and the day of these
Marxist attacks should end right now,'' Bush said.
   ``My pitch is this: that we must not pull away from a freely,
democratically elected government that had certification of the
freedom of those elections,'' he said.
   Debate on aid to El Salvador demonstrated clearly that the new
violence in that Central American country, including the the six
Jesuits and two apparent witnesses to the murders last week, had
reawakened long-dormant congressional tensions.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., had proposed to add language that would
have held back 30 percent of this fiscal year's military money
until after April 1 of next year. The stated intent was to keep
pressure on the Salvadoran government to solve the Jesuit murders,
which some believe are a result of the resurgence of right-wing
death squads. The bill includes a cap of $85 million on military
aid for the year.
   In the Senate, another version of the amendment was proposed by
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. It would have withheld 30 percent of the
military aid until the killers of the priests were apprehended and
brought to trial.
   ``To rush into this breech with this kind of amendment is
suicide, gentlemen, for that country,'' argued Rep. Gerald Solomon,
R-N.Y. ``This amendment is a selective response to a great
tragedy.''
   ``This is not a debate over who are the good guys and who are
the bad guys,'' countered Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., ``This is a
debate over whether the United States has an obligation to assure
that taxpayer dollars are going to a government that protects human
rights.''
   Bush said he had personally told Cristiani ``how strongly we
feel about the killings.''
   ``And I told him that they must get to the bottom of it. I am
convinced they will. The people who did this, whether they come
from the extreme left or the extreme right, pay the penalty,'' Bush
said.
   Bush had vetoed another version of the bill a day earlier
because he objectd to two sections _ a family planning provision
opposed by anti-abortion forces and a ban on use of foreign aid
money to persuade allies to do things that the United States cannot
legally do itself.
   On the latter issue, Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., worked out a
compromise that would ban any ``quid pro quo'' with a foreign
country in which U.S. aid money is traded for policy moves that are
against the law in the United States. The compromise was more
narrowly drawn than an earlier version which the administration
contended would have had a chilling effect on conduct by U.S.
officials and diplomats.
   Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., said that change was inadequate for
the administration, but that a second veto of the bill could be
avoided by attaching a legislative ``fix'' to another bill, perhaps
the must-pass deficit-cutting measure expected to come up on
Tuesday.
   On the abortion matter, a group of abortion-rights House
supporters blasted the veto, with Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.,
contending Bush acted because of a ``blind promise to the right
wing of the Republican Party, which is against family planning.''
She said the rejected bill had included language that would have
prevented any of the disputed money from going to abortions.

   President Bush on Monday vetoed the
annual bill appropriating money for the District of Columbia
because it would allow funds from local taxes to be spent on
abortion.
   It was Bush's second abortion-related veto in two days. With
Congress eager to adjourn before Thanksgiving and no chance for an
override, the House by voice vote immediately passed a new bill
without the objectionable provision and sent it to the Senate,
which followed suit just before midnight.
   On Sunday Bush vetoed the $14.6 billion foreign aid bill because
it contained $15 million for a United Nations population control
agency that operates in China. Bush said aid to the U.N. agency
would make the United States a party to coerced abortions resulting
from China's one-child-per-family policy.
   ``Are there no limits to how far this president will go to show
poor women who's boss in this country?'' complained Rep. Les
AuCoin, D-Ore. ``Now we see the president trying to be the mayor of
the District of Columbia.''
   But the veto was hailed by an anti-abortion organization. ``God
bless President Bush for refusing to sign a death warrant for 3,000
unborn babies,'' Susan A. Smith, spokeswoman for the National Right
to Life Committee, said in a statement.
   It was the second time Bush vetoed the D.C. appropriations bill
over the abortion issue. His earlier veto was in October.
   The president, who was returning to Washington from a campaign
trip on behalf of two pro-choice Republican candidates, sent a
message to the House saying the bill was ``unacceptable.''
   Bush said the bill ``would permit congressionally appropriated
local funds to be used for abortion on demand with no restriction
whatsoever. As a matter of law the use of local funds in the
District of Columbia must be approved by the Congress and the
president.''
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu spoke with House Speaker
Thomas Foley, D-Wash., earlier Monday, and Foley asked for quick
action on the bill so Congress would have a chance to act again
before leaving for the holidays, according to presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The bill would have restricted use of Medicaid funds for
abortions only to save the life of the mother. But Bush objected to
what he called ``abortion on demand'' paid for with other funds
derived from local taxes but also appropriated by Congress.

   The remains of five Air Force Officers lost over
North Vietnam more than 20 years ago have been identified, the
Pacific Command said Monday.
   The remains were among those turned over to U.S. officials by
the Vietnamese government earlier this year.
   The remains were identified at the U.S. Army Central
Identification Laboratory as those of Col. Floyd W. Richardson of
Anchorage, Alaska; Col. Charles D. Roby of Iowa Park, Texas.; Col.
James C. Hartney of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Lt. Col. Gordon B.
Blackwood of Palo Verde, Calif.; and Capt. Daniel Carrier of San
Diego.
   The remains of Richardson, Hartney, Blackwood and Carrier are to
be flown from Hickam Air Force Base to Travis Air Force Base,
Calif., Tuesday following a military honor ceremony.
   Roby's remains will be returned at a later date at the request
of his family, according to the Pacific Command.

   The House Banking Committee girded Monday for
an appearance by the central figure in the collapse of a major
savings and loan and later accusations of influence peddling,
unsure whether Charles H. Keating Jr. would testify or remain
silent.
   ``Until he sits down'' on Tuesday, ``we don't know what he's
going to do,'' Joseph Lewis, a spokeman for the panel, said of
Keating, a Phoenix, Ariz., billionaire and owner of the now
collapsed Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.
   Keating contributed $1.3 million to the political causes of five
U.S. senators whose intervention with federal regulators in early
1987 on behalf of Lincoln is now being investigated by the Senate
ethics committee.
   He was subpoenaed last month to be the final witness at the
House panel's hearing into why top regulators waited until April to
seize Lincoln _ two years after government examiners first
recommended its takeover.
   As the target of a federal grand jury probe in Los Angeles,
Keating was being advised by attorneys to invoke a constitutional
right not to testify, according to one of his associates and
congressional sources, all of whom spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   ``He has every intention of appearing,'' said Bradley Boland,
Keating's son-in-law and executive vice president of his American
Continental Corp. of Phoenix, Lincoln's holding company. ``What
he's going to say when he gets there, I don't know.''
   Also in Los Angeles, investors in $200 million in bonds sold by
American Continental asked a federal court Monday to freeze more
than $100 million they said was illegally transferred to banks
overseas. U.S. District Judge Steve Wilson scheduled a hearing Dec.
4 on the request.
   The committee also was scheduled to hear Tuesday from M. Dannny
Wall, who as chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board removed
jurisdiction over Lincoln from the agency's San Francicso office
after regulators there recommended closing it down.
   The House panel's chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
repeatedly has blamed Wall for allowing Lincoln to remain open as
its losses mounted and has asked President Bush to fire Wall. The
estimated cost of the federal rescue of Lincoln is $2 billion.
   Wall, in turn, has repeatedly accused Gonzalez of conducting the
Lincoln hearings unfairly in refusing to allow him to testify until
Tuesday.
   Other witnesses Tuesday include Rosemary Stewart and Darrel
Dochow, Wall's top aides at the bank board and the agency that
replaced it last summer, the Office of Thrift Supervision, as part
of a $150 billion-plus taxpayer bailout of the S&amp;L industry.
   Dochow assumed responsibility for regulating Lincoln after Wall
stripped the agency's San Franciso office of that role. Ms. Stewart
is the author of a 1988 side letter to a memorandum of
understanding between the bank board and Lincoln assuring the
thrift that no information about its activites would be referred to
criminal authorities.
   ``We have both ends of the string here: the regulator and the
owner of the institution,'' said Lewis. ``If both parties are
forthcoming, we should walk out of there with all the mysteries
pretty much unraveled.''
   According to congressional sources, Keating's attorneys last
week asked the committee if he could invoke his Fifth Amendment
right to not answer questions without having to appear before the
panel.
   Lewis confirmed there had been several phone conversations in
the past week between the committee's lawyers and attorneys for
Keating but would not discuss their content. Keating's primary
attorney in the case, John Quinn of Los Angeles, did not return
phone calls to his office Monday.
   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden
told the House panel last week that his agency has turned over
information to a criminal grand jury investigating Keating.
   Breeden also said that the SEC's own investigation of Keating
and his companies rivals in size its probe of convicted stock
trader Ivan Boesky and other inside dealings on Wall Street and
that he is willing to further double the resources devoted to it if
necessary.
   Lincoln was seized by the bank board one day after its holding
company, American Continental, filed for bankruptcy reorganization.
Regulators have complained that the bankruptcy move has prevented
them from obtaining records to determine the extent of Lincoln's
losses.
   But they have filed a suit against Keating and his associates
alleging that fraud, racketeering and a variety of other illegal
acts were directly responsible for losses of $1.1 billion.
   The Senate ethics committee, meanwhile, last week hired an
outside private counsel to investigate the role of the five
senators who received a total of $1.3 million from Keating.
   The senators _ Alan Cranston, D-Calif,; Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and
John Glenn, D-Ohio _ have all denied any wrongdoing.

   Despite a history as a sexual predator, Westley
Allen Dodd never served more than 10 months in prison and
eventually went back to the streets after each conviction. Now he
stands accused of killing three young boys.
   His arrest last week was the latest in a spate of sex offender
cases that has shocked the Northwest and added impetus to
Washington state's effort to crack down on violent sex criminals.
   While he might have been forced to move on, the 28-year-old Dodd
was never forced to quit.
   Prison and jail sentences were reduced to months and days.
Ordered to treatment, Dodd went as long as was required and then
promptly quit.
   After a 1987 conviction, a psychologist recommended that Dodd be
confined, although he acknowledged that the law might not offer
officials that option. Kenneth L. Von Cleve said he found in Dodd
the most extensive sexual predator history he had ever seen in a
man that young. Dodd was 26 and had detailed dozens of molestations
involving young boys in Idaho and Washington.
   The Governor's Task Force on Community Protection has come up
with a model law that could provide help for law enforcement
officials faced with controlling sexual deviants.
   ``That's the kind of person our recommendations are making a
catch-net for,'' said task force member Helen Harlow of Tacoma said
of Dodd.
   Harlow was named to the task force after her 7-year-old son was
sexually mutilated in May. A sex offender who had been released
from jail was accused of raping the boy and cutting off his penis.
The man awaits trial.
   The 24-member task force is due to report to Gov. Booth Gardner
on Nov. 28 its recommendations for handling sexual predators:
people who stalk victims they don't know, isolate them and move in
for their attack.
   The issue is expected to be at the top of the list when the
Legislature convenes in January. Lawmakers are expected to approve
$100 million for community protection and stronger laws.
   The task force's recommendations include longer prison
sentences; registering sex offenders and carrying juvenile offenses
into adult records; more responsiveness toward victims; and,
perhaps most important, providing civil commitment for persons
judged to be a danger to the community.
   ``When we're dealing with sexually predatory behavior, we can
get a hold on them prior to committing some outrageous, horrible
crime,'' King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng said of civil
commitment.
   Only Minnesota has laws providing for civil action to deal with
``future dangerousness and preventive detention.''
   The recommendations did not give specifics on how such action
might be taken.
   Dodd is charged with two counts of aggravated first-degree
murder in the Labor Day stabbing deaths of William Neer, 10, and
his 11-year-old brother, Cole, whose bodies were found in a park a
few blocks from Dodd's apartment in Vancouver.
   He is also charged with aggravated first-degree murder in the
strangling of 4-year-old Lee Joseph Iseli of Portland, Ore., whose
body was found Nov. 1 near Vancouver, across the Columbia River.
   Dodd, who is being held without bond, faces arraignment Nov. 28.
Conviction on any of the aggravated murder charges would bring a
sentence of death or life in prison without parole. Arraignment was
set for Nov. 28.
   Dodd was arrested after authorities said he tried to abduct a
6-year-old boy from a movie theater in Camas, 15 miles east of
Vancouver. He is charged with first-degree attempted kidnapping and
first-degree attempted murder in that case.
   ``It just points out the need that there are some people we have
to put away forever,'' said Ida Ballasiotes, another task force
member.
   She was appointed to the group after her daughter, Diane
Ballasiotes, was abducted in Seattle and killed a year ago by a
work-release inmate who had been adjudged a sexual psychopath.
   Gardner created the task force last spring amid a public outcry
over the Ballasiotes death and the attack on Ms. Harlow's son.
   Dodd's history of sexual deviancy dates to age 13, when he
exposed himself to other children from a window of his Richland,
Wash., home, according to court records.
   Over the past 15 years, his activities increased, but he avoided
lengthy punishment or incarceration, even though prosecutors said
they tried him as strictly as the evidence allowed.
   Dodd served 118 days in jail after a 1987 Seattle conviction for
attempted unlawful imprisonment, a gross misdemeanor. He attempted
to lure an 8-year-old Seattle boy into a vacant building.
   In a Lewiston, Idaho, case in 1984, Dodd ended up serving 10
months, but only after violating parole terms of a 10-year sentence
for maintaining contact with a victim who was a minor.
   A six-month sentence on a morals charge was suspended in
Richland in 1982 on condition he get treatment, though Dodd served
23 days after failing to meet the treatment requirement.
   Von Cleve, whose Bellevue practice deals with a wide variety of
sex offenders, believes the solution lies in lengthy probations so
that courts retain for many years a kind of control over offenders.
   ``They violate probation and they'd be right back before the
judge,'' Von Cleve said.

   There are increasing signs the
government's pledge to end racial segregation of beaches and public
amenities could lead to conflict as well as reconciliation.
   A right-wing politician says the move will fuel a ``spirit of
rebellion'' among whites opposed to integration.
   And liberals are questioning the government's sincerity
following a Cabinet minister's comment that ``sensitive''
facilities such as health clinics, swimming pools and campgrounds
might remain segregated.
   The initial reaction to President F.W. de Klerk's announcement
Thursday was generally positive, with the predictable exception of
the far-right Conservative Party.
   However, de Klerk's pledge that the Separate Amenities Act would
be scrapped as soon as possible was undercut the next day, when
Provincial Affairs Minister Hernus Kriel said the repeal might not
occur in the upcoming parliamentary session.
   Kriel said there was uncertainty in the Cabinet about how to
deal with ``sensitive areas'' and suggested that some facilities,
including swimming pools, might be reserved solely for the use of
local residents.
   Since residential areas are racially segregated, this would
effectively maintain the whites-only status of swimming pools in
white areas, even if the Separate Amenities Act were repealed.
   Tian van der Merwe, chairman of the anti-apartheid Democratic
Party, said Kriel's remarks suggested de Klerk's announcement may
have been little more than a publicity stunt.
   ``The government is showing it is sensitive to racial obsession
and that it is unable to do away with apartheid,'' he said. ``It is
contemptible.''
   Kriel said the governing National Party did not want to move so
fast that racial conflict resulted.
   ``This is a transitional phase,'' he said. ``If something goes
wrong during this phase, it could seriously retard the reform
process.''
   However, right-wing whites already have signaled they are ready
for confrontation. They include Johann Oosthuisen, mayor of the
Conservative Party-controlled town of Mossel Bay, who wants to keep
the local beach off limits to blacks.
   ``I want to warn the government that there is beginning a spirit
of rebellion amongst the whites throughout Soth Africa,''
Oosthuisen said in a defiant statement after de Klerk called for
immediate opening of all beaches.
   Oosthuisen complained that the government was threatening court
action against white officials who resisted beach integration while
taking no action when banners of the outlawed South African
Communist Party were displayed at recent black opposition rallies.
   ``The Conservative Party is ready, as always, to protect the
rights of whites, come what may,'' the mayor said. He suggested
that National Party members were, for the first time, ``grasping
the full implications of the government's reform program'' and
might decide to defect.
   The Conservative Party leader, Andries Treurnicht, said the
opening of public amenities amounted to a ``theft'' from the white
communities which had paid for them.
   Such angry rhetoric has prompted widespread fears of a white
backlash.
   The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, said in an editorial:
``The danger is that the more the Conservative Party is frustrated,
the greater chance of right-wing extremists turning to violence
which, if not stamped out, could result in a race conflict that
could destroy this country.''
   Anti-apartheid leaders, meanwhile, called for repeal of
politically repressive laws and depicted de Klerk's announcement as
a victory for a nationwide defiance campaign waged since August.
The campaign has included protests at which blacks sought to use
whites-only pools, beaches, hospitals, libraries and parks.
   The proposed repeal of the Separate Amenities Act is ``a
vindication of the view that it is the people themselves, through
mass united action, who can bring down the institutions and the
legacy of apartheid,'' said New Nation, a militant, black-edited
newspaper.
   ``The needs of the people are urgent and will not be tied down
to the sluggish agenda of the regime,'' New Nation said. ``It is
for this reason that the government will continuously follow at the
heels of the masses _ formalizing into law what ordinary people are
already practicing.''

   Ja, Virginia, es gibt einen Nikolaus _ there
is a Santa Claus.
   Traditionally, the jolly old bagman with the braumeister's belly
doesn't make the German scene until Dec. 6, the feast of St.
Nicholas, but Christmas is pouring through the holes in the Berlin
Wall weeks ahead of schedule.
   Like old Fezziwig in Charles Dickens' ``A Christmas Carol,'' the
whole city, East and West, is ``one vast substantial smile.''
   Instead of growing furious at the 2 million poor relations
thronging the chic downtown streets, and at the clouds of exhaust
rising from the endless influx of snorting two-cylinder East German
cars, the ``Wessis'' welcome the ``Ossis'' with smiles, flowers,
champagne, and a government welcome gift of $54 spending money.
   For the children, arriving wide-eyed with wonder, these weekend
shopping sprees are like being invited into Santa's workshop for
advance consultation on their wish list.
   But it is the old people, who remember Berlin before the war and
especially before the wall and thought they would never see it
again, who now really believe in Santa Claus.
   ``Ein traum wird wirklichkeit'' _ a dream come true _ murmured a
middle-aged matron trying on a pair of $215 Charles Jourdan red
satin evening pumps Saturday in the ground-floor designer boutique
at West Berlin's sprawling KaDeWe department store.
   ``Of course she will never buy them,'' whispered sales clerk
Jacqueline Brenz. ``But for once her life, let her walk up and down
on the carpet and dream she is Princess Diana.''
   A few aisles away, a team of beauticians from Paris demonstrated
a new line of Guerlain cosmetics called Samsara.
   They coaxed a frumpy East Berlin woman onto the model's tall
stool, tweaked and blackened her eyelashes, applied a magenta
lipstick, removed the shadow of a mustache with brush strokes of
peach pancake makeup and fluffed out the steely gray hair that had
been primly pinned up in a bun.
   ``Maurice Chevalier said there is no such thing as an old
woman,'' the fashion coordinator intoned in German into his hand
microphone. ``Only a more mature, more experienced woman.''
   The audience of East Germans blocking the aisle laughed
uproariously at the blushing grossmutter, who liked what she saw in
the mirror.
   It was already 20 minutes past closing time, but Santa's elves
in the third-floor toy department patiently demonstrated a
computerized ``chess tutor'' and the ``hi-tech talking robot'' to
an enthralled knot of East Berlin youngsters.
   ``You can tell Easties by the way they dress,'' toy salesman
Peter Rabinsky said. ``They come bundled up in those bulky winter
jackets with a woolen scarf wrapped around six times and a ski cap
down over the ears, which the parents never remove in the hot
store. They wear those bulky boots and all are carrying those
plastic East Berlin shopping bags.''
   He was interrupted by 11-year-old Dieter Drager, eager to plunk
down $16 for the model kit of ``Lockheed's U2-R Spy Plane.''
   Coming from Potsdam, the Drager family had crossed the border
over the famous spy-swapping Glienicke Bridge, where on another
Saturday 27 years ago American U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers was
traded for Russian master spy Rudolf Abel.
   Eric's father, a dairy equipment mechanic, had never heard of
that classic Cold War barter, but as if to redress the balance of
power, Hans, his 9-year-old, invested $14.50 in a MiG-31 Foxhound.
   ``They love model planes, autos and boats. Unfortunately they
cannot use our model railroad kits, because like the East German
tram cars their toy trains run on a wider gauge track,'' Rabinsky
said.
   In the sprawling sixth-floor food hall, the visitors from across
the Spree River marveled at ``45 kinds of bologna'' in the
refrigerated showcase.
   They stocked up for the holidays on ``Guatemala Real Kaffee,''
Sir Winston Tea by the kilo, as well as chestnuts for roasting by a
steam radiator in a state apartment block. A sales girl in a
Bavarian costume doling out hot samples of tinned klopse _
dumplings _ found herself operating a sizeable soup kitchen as word
spread.
   Along the broad Kurfuerstendamm shopping boulevard, mobbed like
Cologne at carnival or Leipzig during a Monday demonstration,
street hawkers singled out East German toddlers for the gift of a
balloon twice their size. A benevolent food vendor offered ``DDR
Burgers'' for one East German mark, with a value of maybe five
cents and falling.
   A teen-ager in a green apron at the Burger King cash register
pretended not to notice when a frail old man leaning on a cane paid
for his ``Doppel Whopper'' with a five-mark note drawn on ``Der
Deutschen Demokratischen Republik,'' the official name of East
Germany. She made up the difference from her purse.

   Here you are in the age of AIDS, preparing
for surgery that may require a transfusion. Is the blood available
from the local blood bank safe? Should you have some of your own
set aside?
   Yes, and yes, doctors say.
   What if you just want some of your blood on hand in case you're
hit by a truck or need an emergency operation _ is that worthwhile?
   Probably not, say the American Red Cross and tradtional blood
banks.
   Yes, say those who freeze and store blood for a fee.
   ``A blood transfusion is the most intimate contact you can have
with another human being. It is more intimate than sex,'' said Dr.
Joseph Feldschuh of New York, who founded an independent frozen
blood lab in 1985. The Food and Drug Administration says 18 such
companies are licensed in the United States.
   Freezing blood for long-term storage is nothing new. The Red
Cross has been doing it without charge since 1964 for people with
rare blood, and has 10,000 pints in frozen storage at 56 centers.
Non-donors may use it in emergencies.
   Companies began getting into freezing four or five years ago
because of AIDS anxiety but ``there has been a low level of such
activity,'' said Dr. Toby Simon, president of the American
Association of Blood Banks.
   The Pentagon kicked off the world's largest frozen blood program
in October, a five-year project to draw 45,000 pints a year toward
stockpiling 225,000 pints domestically and abroad for use during
combat or disasters.
   Medical authorities, including the American Medical Association,
agree that whether the concern is disease or simply the best match,
the safest blood you can receive is your own. But freezing blood on
speculation is another matter.
   Liquid blood has a shelf life of 42 days, while frozen blood can
be kept 20 years or more. But dealing with frozen blood, which must
be thawed and cleaned of chemicals added during freezing, is
expensive and there is no guarantee it will be available where and
when it is needed, Simon said.
   Most U.S. transfusions are for surgery and there is generally
time for a patient to have blood drawn a few weeks beforehand, he
said.
   In an emergency, the chance of contracting disease through a
transfusion pales beside the risk of dying without it, said Dr.
Arthur Kellermann, director of emergency services at the Regional
Medical Center at Memphis and a professor of emergency medicine at
the University of Tennessee, Memphis.
   But James W. Jarvis, who runs a Miami-based blood storage
company, said setting aside a permanent supply ``can provide a
layer of protection for your family and yourself that is not
otherwise there.'' His Personal Blood Storage of America Inc.
recently opened an office near the Federal Express air shipment hub
in Memphis, guaranteeing delivery anywhere in the country in six
hours.
   Six hours can be too long in an emergency, Kellermann said. ``We
literally may need to give a patient blood within five or 10
minutes of coming in the door.'' Emergency rooms often lack time
even to cross-match a patient's blood and must simply give type-O,
the so-called universal donor, he said.
   The Red Cross and military frozen blood programs have nothing to
do with fear of disease, said Dr. Gerald Sandler, the Red Cross'
medical director. The risk of getting AIDS through a transfusion is
about one in 100,000 _ ``better than the odds of getting through
your operation,'' he said.
   A greater statistical risk is hepatitis, with the chances of
infection at two to four in 100 per pint of blood. A new screening
test to be used starting next year is expected to reduce that to
one in a hundred or less.
   Those risks are enough, Feldschuh said, for concern. His Idant
Laboratories will store a pint of blood for $12.50 a month, plus
$85 in drawing and testing fees and about $45 for processing when
it's time to use the blood.
   At Personal Blood Storage, it costs $295 to store a pint for
four years, and $4 a month after that. Additional charges totaling
$125 are likely when the blood is used, plus any shipping, said
spokeswoman Laura Hardy.
   On average, a person getting a transfusion gets four pints, says
the Red Cross, which collects half of the 12 million pints of blood
drawn annually in the United States. It puts the average cost of a
pint of blood at $52. Hospital fees may add $50 to that, said Bob
Rigney of the blood bank association.
   Most medical insurance does not pay for storing blood on
speculation but generally covers all costs when it's time to use
the blood, said Jarvis, whose company has freezers in Florida and
South Carolina as well as Memphis.
   He wouldn't say how many customers he has or how much blood is
in the freezers. Idant, a subsidiary of Daxor Corp., which runs
what it bills as the world's largest frozen sperm bank, also
wouldn't release those figures.
   ``It's not a business where anybody is going to make money for
quite a while. ... I feel this is the wave of the future,''
Feldschuh said.
   The issue of frozen storage aside, the Red Cross and American
Association of Blood Banks are trying to convince people to set
aside their own blood prior to surgery, for what is called
autologous transfusions. Besides being safer for the patients,
autologous donations reduce the demand on blood banks.
   ``There was a dramatic increase for several years for autologous
donations but it's kind of leveled off,'' Simon said. ``We're not
certain whether it's being optimally utilized everywhere or not.''
   In 1987, member hospitals, blood banks and doctors drew 283,000
autologous pints, ``a 55 percent increase over 1986 figures, and
1986 was a 50 percent jump over 1985,'' said spokesman Rigney. He
did not have later figures.
   The Red Cross last year drew 116,400 autologous pints, compared
with 5,500 in 1985, and hospitals with active surgical departments
have encouraged it.
   For autologous blood drawn prior to surgery, it is reasonable,
Sandler said, for many patients to give blood two or three times a
week in building up a stock of five or six pints. Two years ago, he
said, the Red Cross checked on 3,000 people who had their own blood
in frozen storage because of rare types, and found that 20 of them
had actually needed transfusions.
   ``Of the 20 out of the 3,000, every one of them could have done
it in a much, much less expensive way of waiting to have blood
drawn until they knew they needed surgery,'' said Sandler, who
worries that companies' sales pitches will weaken public confidence
in traditional blood banks. ``You can't market to the public the
concept of freezing your own blood without marketing fear of the
blood that most people in the community have to use.''
   ``We are not playing on anybody's fears,'' Jarvis said. ``We are
taking the entrepreneurial spirit that has built this country and
applying it to science and medicine.''

   If all goes according to plan _ and there's
every likelihood that it won't _ a space shuttle will leave its
Florida launch pad in March 1995 carrying the first pieces of
America's space station into orbit.
   Ten flights and 28 months later, by the same shaky timetable,
the parts flown up piece by piece will have been assembled into a
place where men and women can live and work for months at a time,
looking down at the Earth as they silently drift across the sky 250
miles high.
   By August 1999, seven years late but just in time for the 21st
Century, the space station will be finished, serving as a basic
research laboratory for medicine, astronomy, space physics, and as
a staging area for manned flights to the moon and beyond.
   Mostly what stands in the way of this rosy scenario is money.
   Space Station Freedom, as it is named, began as an $8 billion,
10-year project when President Reagan announced it in 1984. It has
grown into a 15-year marathon likely to cost $19 billion or well
over $30 billion, depending on whose figures you use.
   From the start, the space station has had problems with money as
well as with identity and purpose. Former Sen. William Proxmire of
Wisconsin summed up the feelings of many in Congress when he called
the space station ``a project in search of a mission.''
   NASA administrator Richard Truly, a former astronaut, considers
the space station ``the cornerstone to our future in space,'' but
admits the program has had a sputtering past.
   ``In the last five years, Space Station Freedom has undergone 11
major reviews, has faced nearly continual readjustments of its
budget, has had a great deal of management turnover and has
experienced several configuration and schedule changes,'' he says.
   The management turnover reached its peak in May and June of this
year when three top space station executives left NASA.
   The budgeting process for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 _
the year in which the design phase ends and cutting of metal begins
_ illustrates the station's travails.
   President Bush proposed that NASA get $2.05 billion for the
space station, but the House Appropriations Committee in July
decided to chop off $400 million. With that prospect, the space
agency made plans for a 20 percent reduction only to readjust when
actual appropriations ended as $1.85 billion.
   ``The thing that's really tough is the funding instability in
the program,'' says William T. Lenoir, the NASA associate
administrator and former astronaut who reversed a trend and
returned to the agency from private life this year to take charge
of the space flight and space station programs.
   ``In June of every year we don't know what the hell we are going
to get in October,'' he says. ``This year, beginning in June, we
slowed the progress of the space station down because if we had
continued to build on schedule there was a real danger that we'd
get to October and be firing contractors and laying off civil
service (employees).''
   The House Committee on Science and Technology authorized
three-year funding for NASA to give space programs some stability.
However, congressional appropriations committees who vote the
actual money have not gone along.
   So NASA has to live with the uncertainty.
   ``We are very much prejudiced to starting to construct the space
station in March 1995,'' Lenoir says. The choices then boil down,
he says, to ``can we start either less of a station in March 1995,
or can we start in 1995 and let it take longer (to complete)? And
last on our list is, `Okay, we can't start in 1995.''
   The station is America's big project for the next decade. Even
President Bush's space goal for returning Americans to the moon and
then pushing on to Mars requires that a space station be in place
first.
   When Reagan, in his 1984 State of the Union message, directed
NASA to build the station within a decade, there were giddy plans
for having it up and running in 1992 to celebrate the 500-year
anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America.
   To cut down on the spiraling cost, NASA a few years ago divided
the station building program into two phases, intending to finish
one before starting the other. Now nobody talks about the second
block.
   The latest plan envisions limiting crew size to four until the
station is able to support a permanent crew of eight, planned for
July 1997. There will be only 37.5 kilowatts of power available
until that time, when it will be doubled. The smaller the amount of
power, the fewer the experiments that can be run.
   NASA had planned to develop a new high-pressure space suit at a
cost of some $200 million. Instead, the existing shuttle space suit
will be used for the space walks that will be required to assemble
the station. NASA says it wants to reduce the need for space walks
anyway.
   One plan under consideration to save both money and time is to
develop a so-called ``Shuttle-C'' that would substitute a cargo
container for the shuttle orbiter and provide more than double the
cargo-carrying capacity. Such a method could cut out up to seven of
the 16 shuttle trips now planned to bring station parts into orbit.
   What will the station look like? In the present configuration
there would be a truss 508.5 feet long, constructed from long tubes
made of a composite material with a protective coating and joined
like a child's Tinker Toy set.
   Two U.S. modules _ the laboratory and the living quarters _
would be attached to the truss. Each is 14.5 feet wide and 44 feet
long. The Japanese and European modules are of similar size.
   On each end of the truss would be attached two huge photovoltaic
arrays, looking like giant windmill paddles, to gather power from
the sun. Two smaller structures would radiate heat out of the
modules. Another structure will be a telerobotic servicer, a
sophisticated crane capable of performing precise manipulations in
space.
   The habitation module, divided into a quiet zone, a buffer zone
and an active zone, is where the crew meets, eats, sleeps,
exercises, has recreation and receives medical attention if needed.
   Truly says that without the space station, ``the future we dream
of will never become the present we experience.''
   The working quarters of the space station will be five times the
size of its Soviet counterpart, Mir. It will produce 10 times as
much electrical power as skylab, allowing experiments never before
possible.
   ``An evolved space station,'' he says, ``is the first essential
step toward moving again beyond Earth orbit into the solar
system.'' And from that will spring the return to the moon and
journey to Mars.
   ``Each time we go to the frontier and beyond,'' says Truly, ``we
bring back more than we hoped for. This time we have the chance to
bring back more than we can imagine.''

   Walter Mondale, new Coke, Michael Dukakis,
home banking, miniskirts and the Knoxville World's Fair were among
the worst marketing mishaps of the 1980s, a business magazine
reports.
   ``During a decade when knowing the customer became increasingly
important, many companies _ and even whole industries _ failed to
understand their markets,'' American Demographics magazine says in
its December edition.
   The staff of the magazine, published by Dow Jones &amp; Co.,
combined to select the ``10 blunders of the 1980s,'' ranging from
``New'' Coke to the decade's Democratic presidential contenders.
   ``We weren't interested in poor products, but rather in missing
the market. Most of these were really quality products, but the
industry didn't understand its consumers,'' explained Judith
Waldrop, research editor for the magazine, which concentrates on
business-related population studies.
   Waldrop said she started the project a couple of years ago after
hearing a discussion about the influence of marketing research
versus business instincts in product decisions.
   ``Coke was the first thing that came to mind,'' she said of the
1985 decision by the Coca-Cola Co. to abandon its traditional soft
drink in favor of a new formula.
   ``But Coke forgot about the giant generation that controls much
of American business _ the baby boom,'' the magazine reported.
   The millions of Americans in that post-World War II generation
grew up with traditional Coke and reacted angrily to the change,
eventually forcing the company to bring back the original product
as Coke Classic.
   Today, American Demographics reports, Classic has 20.1 percent
of the soft drink market while the costly campaign to sell new Coke
resulted in only a 1.4 percent share for that brand.
   Another blunder was the 1987 effort by designers to sell
miniskirts to women.
   ``I thought this was ridiculous,'' said Waldrop, ``I just don't
want to look like this in the job situation.''
   Miniskirts were fun 20 years ago, she explained, but most women
no longer find that hemline appropriate. Now, explained the
analysis, they have ``career expectations, family responsibilities
and extra pounds.''
   The decades' Democratic presidential contenders, meanwhile,
``based their campaigns on the traditional New Deal coalition of
blacks, organized labor and middle-class liberals,'' the magazine
commented.
   During the decade, the report pointed out, blacks remained a
small share of the voting population, union membership fell
significantly and Ronald Reagan skillfully attacked the traditional
liberal faith in big government.
   While Democrats like Jimmy Carter, Mondale and Dukakis continued
to appeal to the coalitions of the past, Republicans styled
themselves as the party of opportunity and won election after
election, the report observed.
   Some products were close calls but did not make the disaster
list, said Waldrop, including wine coolers, smokeless cigarettes
and non-alcoholic beverages in general.
   In addition to the Democrats, new Coke and miniskirts, other
business bungles on the list included:
   _Motown sticking with its traditional soul and blues artists and
missing the rapid growth of rap music, which has rocketed into a
multimillion-dollar enterprise for other record labels.
   ``Motown missed the rap market because it got old with its
original audience,'' the magazine reported.
   _The Knoxville World's Fair. A century ago world's fairs drew
millions by showing off products and cultures that were unavailable
elsewhere. Today Americans can watch dozens of cable television
channels, leaving little to awe them, and most who really want to
see a foreign culture can travel there relatively quickly and
easily. ``Without awe, World's Fairs are doomed to go the way of
small town circuses,'' said the magazine.
   _Sears, Roebuck and Co. lost a major segment of its market share
to K mart and Wal-Mart during the decade by ignoring demographic
changes.
   Sears concentrated on middle-class America, the magazine said,
while the middle-class family was declining. After the economic
problems of the decade middle-income consumers are trained to look
for bargains and discount stores are meeting the need.
   In recent months Sears introduced ``everyday low pricing'' and
added a variety of brands in an effort to turn this around. The
jury is still out on this, the magazine reports.
   _Coleco Industries made millions on the popular Cabbage Patch
dolls in the middle of the decade, but got stuck on that product.
In 1985 the dolls accounted for 85 percent of the company's sales,
so when the market became saturated income for Coleco plummeted.
   _Home banking was an idea that was ready technologically, but
not in consumers' minds, despite the presence of computers in
millions of homes. Many banks tried to offer home banking services
but abandoned the effort in the face of consumer disinterest.
   _Grandparents magazine, a quality product that failed when its
marketers were unable to obtain mailing lists to target the sales
to the correct audience.
   _Burger King's ``Herb the Nerd'' campaign in which Herb was
supposed to represent an unsophisticated consumer who had never
been to Burger King. Instead, consumers got the idea that only
nerds went to the restaurant.

   This is one town that takes Christmas
seriously, stringing up 230 miles of lights, erecting an
8-by-10-foot gingerbread house and inviting the world to help
celebrate.
   The third annual Wonderland of Lights Festival twinkles with 2.5
million bulbs _ 100 for every child, woman and man in town of
25,000 residents.
   In addition to the oversized house of real gingerbread,
attractions include a 786-square-foot Christmas card featuring the
works of local artists and bearing the goodwill wishes of 12,000
signers.
   Boosters hope to attract 500,000 visitors to the east Texas town
this holiday season, said Patti Harris, manager of the Chamber of
Commerce.
   ``We wanted to present the ultimate Christmas dream to our
visitors,'' said Ms. Harris, adding that 150 tours already have
been booked for the holiday season.
   Guided tours are provided and after seeing the sights, tourists
are invited to listen to the ``Orchestra of Angels,'' and talk with
Santa Claus.
   The event started with a suggestion by the Marshall News
Messenger and took off with a big private donation and lots of
volunteer help.
   Residents like to point out that they put up more lights than
Rockefeller Center in New York, with 11 miles of strands; the
Country Club Plaza in Kansas City, Mo., with 9 miles; or the
Festival of Lights in Natchitoches, La., with 18 miles.
   ``There is nothing the volunteers won't do,'' Ms. Harris said.
``Except maybe climb the courthouse dome and put lights on the top.
We have to pay someone to do that.''

   Katrina's Postmarque of Katra didn't have to
sit, heel, or even hold still to win top honors at the nation's
biggest pedigreed cat show.
   The grand champion, a black male Persian, won $1,000 for its
owner, Carolyn Henry of Springfield, Ill., at the Cat Fanciers'
Invitational Cat Show on Sunday.
   The show, a ``Who's Who'' of cats, featured 730 felines
representing 31 breeds from 45 states, Japan and Canada. Organizers
said it was the largest show for pedigreed cats in North America.
   And all the contestants have to do is look pretty, said Joan
Pocica, director of the Cat Fanciers' Association.
   ``They can even hiss and meow and they aren't penalized,''
Pocica said.
   Another big winner was Keijik's Ten on the Richter, a
sable-colored Burmese owned by Charlene Gould of Portola Valley,
Calif., which won $500 in the Premiership category for neutered
cats.
   Best Kitten was Sherecon's Fold on a Minute, a silver-and-white
Scottish fold owned by Mandy Hemphill, Maureen Gordon and Terry
Warren of Idyllwild, Calif. That award also was worth $500. The
Scottish fold breed has folded ears.
   ``These cats are kept in satins and velvets and laces,'' Pocica
said. ``They have drapes on their cages. They're show cats and they
know it,'' she said.

   A 1975 bus brought $1,900 and a 1948-vintage
subway car sold for $3,000 when the Transit Authority cleaned out
its closets and parking lots with an auction.
   A turnstile sold for $375, even though there weren't any tokens
inside, Transit Authority spokeswoman Caren Gardner said after
Sunday's auction, which drew 1,500 people.
   Also for sale were many fixed-price items.
   The most popular were $10 ``roller curtains,'' the signs on the
side of subway trains that identify a train and the beginning and
end of the line, Gardner said.
   Also popular were straphangers' delight _ stainless steel subway
``straps,'' which sold for $5 each _ and neighborhood maps for the
same price.
   Giveaway bins contained such unidentified items as subway car
parts and maintenance equipment, Gardner said.
   ``If you could identify it, you could have it,'' she said.
   The second annual sale raised $35,000 for the agency's general

<TEXT>
   A Communist Party newspaper, exercising the
new openness, described for East Germans how top party officials
came to acquire luxury home furnishings from abroad while their
countrymen had to do without.
   ``Canadian lumber, Italian floor mosaics, West German bathroom
tiles ... in grand one-family houses with immense floor space,''
was how the Berliner Zeitung described the officials'
well-appointed homes.
   Party officials who over four decades of unchallenged one-party
rule took advantage of their high positions to enrich themselves
are widely resented.
   There is a desperate shortage of construction materials in East
Germany, and many people live in cramped apartments with relatives.
   Nonetheless, the newspaper said a state-owned Potsdam firm _ VEB
Spezialbau Potsdam _ has in years past been responsible for
arranging for the import of expensive furnishings for the homes of
high-ranking party officials.
   The firm's normal task is maintenance of buildings housing
Soviet troops in East Germany, the newspaper said in the article
Sunday.
   ``We got simply everything, from wherever,'' it quoted one
former employee as saying.
   Many top party officials live in an exclusive community north of
Berlin called Wandlitz.
   Egon Krenz, the country's new Communist leader, said in an
interview with East German television Sunday night that the
situation was changing.
   Krenz said that he had, since becoming party chief on Oct. 18,
moved into a concrete building in East Berlin's Pankow district.
The home appeared comfortable but modest.
   ``I feel like a Berliner now,'' Krenz said in the interview.

<HEAD>Elderly Blacks Moving Both North and South</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Elderly blacks, many of whom head home to the
South when they retire, later move back north in significant
numbers, say researchers who express surprise at the finding.
   A stream of elderly blacks heading from states like New York to
Florida was expected, but the counter-flow was ``something nobody
had even imagined before,'' said sociologist Charles F. Longino of
the University of Miami.
   ``We don't know if they are going back home to be with their
kids, or what,'' said Longino in a telephone interview.
   Longino, a specialist in the elderly, and Kenneth J. Smith
reported their findings in a paper ``Roots: Black Return Migration
to the South,'' presented this weekend at a gerontological meeting
in Minneapolis.
   Their finding of a large flow of elderly blacks from North to
South duplicates earlier studies for the population in general.
However, since blacks and whites have different rates of
relocation, the researchers did not compare the races.
   Comparing people's residence as reported in the 1980 census with
their homes five years earlier and their place of birth, Longino
and Smith found that major retirement streams flow in the reverse
of historical black labor routes.
   In other words, many southern blacks left home for jobs in the
North in their youth, but returned home to friends, family and
lower costs of living when they retired. Later, however, many
reversed that move.
   The study was based on the movements of about 75,600 elderly
blacks over five years.
   Of those people, the South saw 43,520 move in and 30,720 leave.
The West gained 10,120 and lost 6,000. The Northeast received 9,160
and lost 21,880. And 12,800 arrived in the Midwest, while 17,000
departed.
   ``The older migrants entering the southern region tend to be
younger, more often married, and living independently while those
leaving the South are older, more often widowed and much more
likely to be living dependently at their destination,'' said
Longino and Smith.
   For example, the average age of elderly blacks moving to the
South was 68.5, 45 percent of them were married and 19.5 percent
were disabled. For those moving back north the average age was
72.9, only 21 percent were still married and 29.8 percent were
disabled. Some 72.4 percent of those moving south lived
independently, while only 47 percent going back north maintained
their own household.
   One possibility, Longino suggested, is that older blacks who are
widowed and become dependent may head back north to be with their
children. Another guess, the researchers suggested, is that they
may retire and move south to care for their own elderly parents,
later returning north after those parents die.
   ``To construct a likely scenario from these few population
characteristics is like making an archeological reconstruction from
only a few artifacts,'' they said.
   Overall, the researchers found that the largest numbers of older
persons, which the researchers defined as aged 60 and over, moved
from New York to Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and
Virginia. In addition, a significant retirement stream was reported
from Illinois to Mississippi.
   California was the leading attractor for black elderly people,
however, a finding that the researchers termed ``contrary to our
research expectations.'' Many of those heading for California came
from Texas and New York.
   Looking at people moving into states, the study found nine
states in which more than half of the older blacks moving in had
been born in that state _ Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas and
Louisiana.

<HEAD>US Rice Producers Face Competition in World Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the many problems confronting Congress
as it develops new farm legislation for 1990 is rice and how U.S.
producers will fare in the growing competition for world trade.
   According to Agriculture Department forecasts, the U.S. rice
inventory will drop by next Aug. 1 _ the end of the 1989-90
marketing year _ to 23.7 million hundredweight from a seasonal
carryover of 26.7 million this Aug. 1 and 31.4 million on Aug. 1,
1988.
   Total U.S. production this year dropped to 156.4 million
hundredweight, based on November surveys, from 159.4 million in
1988. However, from a historical standpoint, this year's harvest is
one of the largest.
   But for the fourth straight year, according to USDA record
keepers, U.S. rice production is falling below total use. Thus, the
decline in year-end rice inventories.
   The U.S. rice supply is produced in half a dozen states, led by
Arkansas, which accounted for more than 63.8 million hundredweight
this year, or about 41 percent of the estimated 1989 harvest.
   Others include California, with 32.4 million hundredweight this
year; Louisiana, 22.2 million; Mississippi, 13.5 million; Missouri,
4.25 million; and Texas, 20.2 million.
   ``Government policy plays a pivotal role in the U.S. rice
sector, affecting virtually every rice producer and every rice
sale, whether for domestic or export use,'' says the department's
Economic Research Service. ``Participation (by growers) in the
annual rice price support and production adjustment program
currently exceeds 90 percent.''
   And government programs figure mightily in U.S. rice trade, with
more than 40 percent of U.S. rice exports shipped as food aid or
with government-backed credit.
   Moreover, the agency said in its report, when world supplies are
large and prices drop sharply, a ``marketing loan'' arrangement
allows rice producers to repay USDA price support loans at rates
based on world market prices, instead of the face value of the
loans.
   In that way, rice can be sold at market-clearing levels instead
of being locked up in storage as part of the surplus inventory held
by USDA's Commodity Credit Corp.
   Taxpayer costs of rice marketing loans exceeded $400 million in
1986-87 when world prices were well below the U.S. loan rate. But
rising world prices have narrowed the gap and in 1988-89 the
marketing loan costs were lowered to about $60 million, the report
said.
   Agency economists Janet Livezey, C. Edwin Young and Nathan W.
Childs noted in their report that rice, one of the world's major
food grains, is generally consumed within the country that produces
it. Less than 5 percent enters world trade.
   Because of the uncertainty of monsoons in Asia and the
concentration of trade among a few key countries _ Thailand is the
largest exporter, the United States is second _ the global rice
market ``has earned the description of being thin, volatile and
risky,'' the report said.
   Yet, world rice trade has virtually doubled since the early
1960s and has risen more than 50 percent since 1970. And countries
outside of Asia have accounted for an increasing share of the
market.
   ``Middle Eastern markets more than tripled between 1970 and 1981
because of the region's economic growth and development, increased
revenues from oil sales, and large U.S. credit guarantees,'' the
report said. ``African imports rose in response to income growth
related to increased oil sales and to increases in food aid and
credit assistance.''
   World rice trade leveled off in the mid-1980s, in part because
of declining Asian imports, the report said. Also, successful
adoption of high-yielding rice seed and improved methods allowed
Asia ``to approach self-sufficiency in rice.''
   The analysts said the United States ``will continue to face
intense competition'' in the world rice market. Although
fluctuations in world rice output will continue to influence rice
trade, these impacts will diminish as consumption outside of Asia
increases.
   ``The United States faces the challenge of designing and
maintaining policies regarding U.S. competitiveness in the world
rice market, while constraining taxpayer outlays,'' the report said.
   Several issues were raised by the analysts:
   _The need to balance export growth and maintenance of farm
income against the costs of payments to farmers and the marketing
loan program.
   _Rice production's ``degree of dependence'' on government
programs such as marketing loans and export subsidies.
   _Competition of the United States in higher quality, higher
priced world rice markets.
   _Policies concerning rice stockpiles, and the need to continue
with annual acreage-reduction programs.
   _Environmental damage involved in rice production, and the
``proper allocation'' of available water supplies.

   A sheriff's unpublished book about the men
who preceded him has a little bit of everything: gruesome murders,
love triangles and other lurid crimes of passion.
   But it is the unsolved 1935 shooting death of Newport Town
Marshal George Conniff that has most consumed Sheriff Tony Bamonte
and led to an accusation that a retired police detective killed
Conniff.
   A rusted pistol reclaimed from a river is the only piece of
evidence Bamonte has in the 54-year-old case.
   ``If the only thing I've done is bring the sunshine into this
crime, then justice is starting to be served,'' said Bamonte about
his book, which is to be published next summer. Bamonte, sheriff in
northwestern Washington's Pend Oreille County for the past 10
years, would not say who is publishing his work.
   Conniff was shot four times and killed after apparently
confronting two men during the burglary of a creamery Sept. 15,
1935. The original investigation was closed and the slaying went
unsolved.
   That investigation and a witness' pleas for another probe in the
1950s also produced no arrests because, Bamonte contends, police
officers involved in the inquiry covered up the crime.
   With the help of the Spokane Police Department, Bamonte this
year reopened the investigation after his research convinced him
that Conniff was slain by a fellow policeman involved in
Depression-era black market thefts of dairy products.
   He is certain the killer is a 90-year-old former Spokane
detective. The man has not been charged and has refused to talk to
authorities.
   According to Bamonte, NBC-TV's ``Unsolved Mysteries'' is
scheduled to broadcast a segment on Conniff's slaying in January.
He said he hopes it will offer evidence he needs to bring charges.
   ``If one person is alive that he has bragged to about the
killing, then as far as I'm concerned, that's enough to ask for
charges,'' Bamonte said last week. ``He's 90 years old now and some
people might look at him with sympathy. But I've got to look past
that.
   ``There's also an ethical question: Because time lapses, does
that forgive a crime like this? That's why society has put murder
beyond the statute of limitations,'' he said.
   Because many of the potential witnesses are dead and there is
little physical evidence, chances of bringing Conniff's killer to
trial are slim, Bamonte admits.
   But he will still try.
   ``A decent police officer was gunned down, then shot once more
when he was down,'' Bamonte said. ``Justice shouldn't escape
something like this. I'm obligated to do what I'm doing.''
   The key piece of evidence, the corroded .32-caliber pistol found
in August under a downtown Spokane River bridge, is the probable
murder weapon, Bamonte said.
   The former detective who Bamonte suspects reported that his
.32-caliber off-duty revolver had been stolen shortly after
Conniff's slaying.
   Bamonte has taped statements from two former Spokane police
officers that a superior told them another officer was in trouble
and instructed to throw a package off a bridge. One of the men
recently died.
   Bamonte believes the package contained the pistol he found below
the bridge after a utility company stopped the Spokane River's flow
over a nearby dam in August.
   The county prosecutor's office has been given regular reports on
Bamonte's investigation but has not decided to reopen the case.
   Other evidence, such as the retired detective's personnel file
that could contain a confidential report implicating him in the
Conniff slaying, is missing, said police Lt. Gary Johnson, who was
assigned to help Bamonte's investigation.
   None of the personnel files of other men employed by the
department have been removed, he said.
   Johnson said he would neither confirm nor deny Bamonte's claims,
but ``it very well could have been a Spokane police officer
involved. The things Bamonte has turned up points that way.''

<DATELINE>CANOVANAS, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For two months, Evelyn Sanchez,
her husband and four children have slept on three mattresses spread
on the tile floor of an elementary school.
   ``We're so tired of it,'' said Ms. Sanchez.
   The family lost their home and possessions when Hurricane Hugo
slammed into Puerto Rico on Sept. 18.
   Taking clothes, a TV set and a tape player, Ms. Sanchez said the
family rode out the storm at Luiz Munoz Marin School, a hurricane
shelter on the outskirts of the coastal town of Canovanas, 35 miles
northeast of San Juan.
   ``But God, we never expected to be here this long,'' said her
common-law husband, Jose Ramos Rodriguez, a garbage collector.
   They are among more than 500 people waiting for federal aid and
temporary housing in Canovanas, the town with the largest number of
homeless hurricane victims in Puerto Rico.
   Throughout the island last week, more than 4,000 homeless people
were being housed in 118 shelters, still waiting for assistance. A
day after the hurricane, the number of homeless reached 12,243.
   Despite the efforts of thousands of emergency workers and local
volunteers, just 10 percent of nearly 160,000 people who applied
for aid with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, have
received assistance. Some 80,000 people have sought help with the
Red Cross.
   Relief workers say the delays are due to the large numbers of
people and homes affected by the devastatiing hurricane.
   ``This is by far the biggest disaster we have ever dealt with,''
said Red Cross spokesman Steve Grumbacher. ``It is the most
expensive and complicated too because the area is so large and
because of the language situation. It's a monster.''
   Puerto Rico is a U.S. commonwealth, but Spanish is the main
language of its 3.3 million inhabitants and only an estimated 58
percent speak English.
   ``It's also been a lousy year for disasters,'' said Grumbacher.
``There was Hugo in the Caribbean and then it hit Carolina. Then
came the San Francisco quake.''
   FEMA spokesman John Schad said that compared with the number of
hurricane victims along the Carolina coast, the number of
applicants for aid in Puerto Rico ``is three times as high.''
   ``We are asking people to please be patient,'' said Schad.
``Obviously with the high numbers of applications, it's going to
take some time.''
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon has accused FEMA inspectors of being
``arbitrary.''
   ``There is a big difference between my estimates and FEMA's,''
the governor said recently, referring to the number of people the
agency determined had lost everything.
   FEMA estimates 8,000 people suffered total losses, while
Hernandez Colon said the figure is about 28,000. About 50,000 homes
were affected by the hurricane.
   Schad said that by Tuesday, the deadline, FEMA expected to have
200,000 or more applications to process. He said 70 to 80 percent
of those applying would be eligible for assistance.
   So far, the agency has issued more than 15,000 checks providing
some $32 million in housing relief, as well as small business
loans, Schad said.
   It's not just assistance which is slow in coming.
   Some 20 to 30 percent of the houses in 17 towns still lack
electricity and running water.
   In stark contrast to San Juan, where only traces of the
hurricane's wrath remain, slabs of wood and tin roofs litter roads
around Canovanas. In the adjacent towns of Loiza Aldea and Rio
Grande, hundreds of fallen palm trees lie on sandy beaches.
   The government had built 883 pre-fabricated units, or modules,
as temporary housing for hurricane victims in 22 towns.
   But that still left many out and they have been waiting in
impersonal shelters.
   ``At first I was hopeful,'' said Jorge Bonano, a 23-year-old
electrician living in a Canovanas shelter with his wife Wanda, who
is five months pregnant. ``They told us the houses would be ready
the 15th of October. Then they said the 31st. Now, I don't know ...
''
   Many of the homeless, impatient for either aid or homes, were
squatting on government land or vacant lots and building their own
makeshift shacks out of whatever material they could find.
   ``It's what a lot of people are doing are doing in
desperation,'' said Evelyn Sanchez. ``It's what we are thinking of
doing.''

<HEAD>She Wrote `My Turn' _ Now Critics Take Their Turn</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nancy Reagan wrote her memoirs, ``My Turn'' to
get revenge, but what she got was panned.
   Critics, who always get the last word, have been knocking her
book as shallow and mean-spirited, describing it as revealing more
about the author than she might have wanted revealed.
   A few have been friendlier, finding an unexpected side of the
former first lady _ humor.
   In the Chicago Tribune, Dorothy Collin called the book as much
fun as ``a long gossipy lunch.''
   And Florence King, writing in the San Jose (Calif.)
Mercury-News, saluted Mrs. Reagan's deftness in dismissing daughter
Patti's excuse for skipping the 1985 inaugural _ her husband had to
work.
   In a line Ms. King liked a lot, Mrs. Reagan wrote: ``It seemed
to me that if you were taking a couple of days off because your
father-in-law was being sworn in as president of the United States,
most people would understand.''
   But for the most part, the reviewers said Mrs. Reagan has
produced what Barbara Ehrenreich in the New Republic calls a
``whining'' book.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer's reviewer, Susan Page, suggested that
``My Turn'' should have been titled ``Take That.''
   David Lauter of the Los Angeles Times found the book ``a
relentless settling of scores,'' displaying ``cattiness.''
   Concluded Lauter: ``The result is to reinforce virtually every
aspect of the image she would like to shed.''
   ``Nancy Reagan has written a book she shouldn't have,'' agreed
Richard Dyer in the Boston Globe. ``Instead of changing a
hoity-toity image she is unhappy with, she has reinforced it. If
you thought she cared too much about clothes and furniture and
china and decoration and every form of appearance, this book proves
you are right.''
   ``Smugness infects these memoirs,'' said R. W. Apple Jr. in The
New York Times. ``Mrs. Reagan's self-satisfaction and
self-righteousness shine out from page after page.''
   Historian Lewis Gould of the University of Texas, who
specializes in first ladies, says he suspects Mrs. Reagan comes
across as more bitter than she intended. That happens, he says,
when people dictate memoirs into a tape recorder, allowing a
ghostwriter to polish their words.
   By not having to put pen to paper, the author does not have to
think about what he is saying and the result, Gould says, can be
``like a heated letter you read the next morning and throw away.''
   Mrs. Reagan, he said, ``sent out the heated letter.''
   The former first lady, of course, gets the last laugh _ the one
that is laughed en route to the bank. Her book is selling well.
   ``My Turn'' jumped to first-place on most best seller lists. It
took the No. 2 spot on the widely-watched New York Times best
seller list for Nov. 19 and, says her agent, Mort Janklow, it will
reign as No. 1 in the list the Times will print Nov. 26.
   Mrs. Reagan was widely reported to have been paid $2 million in
advance royalties. Random House, her publisher, disputes that
figure but won't disclose the actual amount. Industry scuttlebutt
is that it may have been more.
   Random House publicist Carol Schneider said the first wave of
reviews were ``political.''
   ``People seem to be reviewing Nancy Reagan rather than the
book,'' she said.
   Agent Janklow says the reviews have been negative because people
expect a first lady to write a sweet and innocent memoir, something
Mrs. Reagan's isn't.
   ``She unburdens herself of her pent-up anger and I think that's
what makes it a wonderful book,'' says Janklow.
   Many critics comment on the book's anger. Washington Post
reviewer Sally Quinn said she turned back the corners of pages on
which Mrs. Reagan mentioned being angry, furious, outraged,
irritated or annoyed and counted 42 turned corners in 370 pages.
   One of the targets of Mrs. Reagan's anger was Ms. Quinn herself
for ``a very negative article about me''; another was Ms. Quinn's
husband, Post executive editor Benjamin C. Bradlee.

<HEAD>Cheney Plans Defense Spending Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney says he is
ordering the military services to plan spending cuts next year
because the rapid pace of Soviet bloc reform reduces the threat of
war to a 45-year low.
   ``It's clear that the likelihood of all-out conflict between the
U.S. and the Soviet Union, between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, is
probably lower now than it's been at just about any time since the
end of World War II,'' Cheney said Sunday on the ABC-TV program,
``This Week With David Brinkley.''
   Cheney said the Soviets appear to be cutting military spending,
and that further U.S. defense reductions are acceptable _ a shift
in his position.
   ``You can't watch the events unfold in Eastern Europe, the
development of governments headed by non-communists, the
possibilities of free elections, of opposition parties, and not
believe that that will have some long-term impact upon the security
situation in Europe,'' Cheney said.
   ``Given the changes that we see today in Eastern Europe, I think
it's possible to contemplate the possibility over the next few
years that we may, indeed, be able to reduce the level of our
deployments in Western Europe,'' Cheney said.
   Two former White House national security advisers also said
Soviet bloc reforms enable America to reduce its troops in Europe.
   ``The pattern of postwar politics as it has developed for the
last 40 years is now at an end,'' Henry Kissinger, the former
national security adviser and secretary of state from the Nixon and
Ford administrations, said on ABC.
   Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's security adviser, urged
that billions of dollars be shifted from defense to help East
European nations move from communism to democracy and a free-market
economy.
   Brzezinski, appearing on the NBC-TV program ``Meet the Press,''
called for creation of a fund for Central Europe modeled on the
Marshall Plan that promoted the economic recovery of Western Europe
after World War II.
   ``We spend about $150 billion on the defense of Europe, about
half of our defense budget,'' Brzezinski said. ``If we can reduce
the level of the confrontation in Central Europe, we will gain
flexibility in dealing with Central Europe economically,
financially, that we haven't had until now.''
   Cheney did not specify how great a reduction he anticipated, but
senior Pentagon officials have said he plans to cut $180 billion
over three years beginning with 1992. Congress is now completing
action on a $286 billion defense budget for the 1990 fiscal year
that began Oct. 1.
   In an interview with The Washington Post published Sunday,
Cheney said the spending cuts for 1991-97 would center on such high
technology hardware as the B-2 stealth bomber. The New York Times
reported that the Air Force has proposed closing 15 bases and
reducing deliveries of F-16 fighters to achieve overall cuts of $34
billion, about $10 billion short of the reduction Cheney has
requested over three years.
   The Soviets have reduced their spending on conventional arms,
Cheney said, but continue to modernize their strategic nuclear
force and have ``a long way to go to clean up their act in the
Third World.''
   He said the Soviet Union was in part to blame for the guerrilla
offensive in El Salvador because Moscow supports Cuba and
Nicaragua, two nations the Bush administration has accused of
aiding the Salvadoran rebels.
   Cheney said he would forward his recommendations on the defense
budget to President Bush in early December, about the time the
president is to hold his first summit with Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev. The budget package will be sent to Capitol Hill in
January, said Cheney.
   The decision to plan for the cuts was driven in part by the
perception that the Soviet threat was diminishing and in part by
the U.S. budget crunch. Cheney has maintained that Soviet military
spending has risen by 3 percent annually from 1985 to 1988, and
that Pentagon spending has fallen 11 percent.

   The embattled program of catastrophic medical
insurance for retirees, which last week seemed doomed, has at least
a spark of life remaining.
   The Senate on Sunday rejected a bill to repeal the program _
following the advice of the very negotiators who approved the bill
a day earlier. That means Senate and House conferees will make a
final effort to find an acceptable way of fixing the program
without repeal.
   ``We ought to take another shot at it,'' said Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas. He said he had reason to believe the House
negotiators were preparing to make another offer _ one that would
kill the unpopular income surtax that finances the program but
retain at least some coverage for catastrophic hospital expenses.
   However, some House members who have worked most closely on the
issue _ including Reps. Brian Donnelly, D-Mass., and Bill Archer,
R-Texas, who favor repeal, and Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who opposes
repeal _ said they knew of no new offer.
   ``While I personally have sought to achieve some reasonable
compromise ... I am now of the opinion that no such compromise
position exists,'' Archer told the House on Sunday night.
   On a 349-57 vote, the House repeated its insistence that the
program be repealed. But the Senate, under a prearranged procedure,
rejected the agreement by voice vote and called for new
negotiations.
   The House and its negotiators have backed repeal for weeks. With
Congress preparing to wrap up its 1989 session, Senate negotiators
threw in the towel early Saturday and agreed reluctantly to support
repeal.
   But on Sunday, Bentsen said that Senate concession had served as
a ``shock treatment'' for some House members and set in motion what
he concluded was a new movement toward compromise.
   Repeal of the law, which was enacted with strong bipartisan
support last year, would leave most of the nation's 32 million
retirees with little or no protection against being wiped out
financially by a serious illness.
   The first major part of the Medicare-based program, covering all
but the first $560 of this year's hospital bills, went into effect
Jan. 1. Protection for all but the first $1,370 of doctors' bills
is due to take effect next Jan. 1, 1990. Coverage for prescription
drugs would follow in 1991.
   Congress is having second thoughts about the program because of
loud complaints from retirees who already have some kind of
catastrophic insurance and from some of those with higher incomes,
who are having to pay an income surtax of up to $800 a year. Only
about 40 percent of retirees pay any surtax and about 6 percent
were required to pay the maximum $800 this year.

   Rex Harrison said when he steps onstage tonight
for the Broadway opening of ``The Circle,'' the Somerset Maugham
comedy of manners, he expects to have butterflies in his stomach.
   The 81-year-old Sir Rex said he still suffers from stage fright.
   ``Every night,'' he said in an interview published Sunday in The
New York Times. ``I suppose if you don't have stage fright you go
on like a flat pancake.''
   In his first stage appearance 63 years ago, when he played an
anguished young father in a Liverpool Repertory Company production,
he fumbled his only line: ```It's a doctor,''' he recalled. ``
`Fetch a baby.'''
   ``The Circle'' also stars Glynis Johns and Stewart Granger at
the Ambassador Theater. Harrison, who was knighted by Queen
Elizabeth II earlier this year in recognition of his contribution
to the arts, said it may be his final play.
   ``I'd like to have more time to myself, more time to paint,'' he
said. ``I want to potter a bit.''

   Dick Beardsley was once among the country's
top marathon runners. But following surgery on his left leg, which
was mangled in a farm accident, doctors and friends are hoping that
he'll walk again.
   ``The goal right now is to get Dick to be able to walk again and
hopefully be able to work on the farm. The prospects for Dick to
ever run even recreationally are not being discussed,'' said
Beardsley's coach, Bill Wenmark.
   Beardsley finished second in the 1982 Boston Marathon, and his
time of two hours, eight minutes and 53 seconds remains one of the
fastest ever by a U.S. runner. He retired from marathons last year.
   Beardsley, 33, was transferring corn to a crib on Nov. 13 when
his coveralls got caught in a drive shaft used to power farm
equipment. He suffered cuts on his calf muscles in his left leg and
severe ligament damage to the left knee.
   ``He's really a very lucky man to be alive,'' Wenmark said.
Beardsley's prognosis was fair following Saturday's surgery.
   Wenmark said he believes Beardsley will cope well with the
injury. ``I don't think the love of his life, which is running, is
as important as his life,'' he said.
   A fund has been set up to help Beardsley, who had no health
insurance at the time of the accident. Donations are being accepted
for the Dick Beardsley Fund at the Lake Area Security Bank in
Lindstrom.

   The spring of 1986 should have been the best
time in Quincy Jones' life. He had just won three Grammy Awards for
producing, ``We Are the World,'' the decade's biggest-selling
single.
   He was ready to record with Michael Jackson a follow-up to
``Thriller,'' the best-selling album of all time. And film studios
were calling after Jones scored and co-produced ``The Color
Purple.''
   But his 12-year marriage to actress Peggy Lipton was crumbling,
his mother-in-law was dying of cancer, and he was suffering from
exhaustion and overwork.
   ``At one point I was experiencing about seven of the Top 10
stress factors,'' he said in an interview published in Sunday's Los
Angeles Times.
   Now, at 56, Jones said he is on the rebound and is celebrating
his return with a new album, ``Back on the Block.''
   The album, to be released Tuesday, features hot young rappers,
be-bop legends, and such guests as Ella Fitzgerald. It also draws
from Jones' broad career.
   ``I feel like the luckiest man in music, to have come along in
the swing era and then seen modern jazz, rock 'n roll, doo-wop,
folk and everything else happen,'' he said. ``I've seen a lot of
beats go by in 40 years.''

   Thomas Walter Anderson, a rap singer
known as Walter D, was being held without bond on charges of
conspiracy to sell cocaine, authorities said.
   His manager and producer also were being held on the charges.
   Anderson, 27, has been trying to establish a solo career in Los
Angeles. His single, ``9mm (Millimeter)'' appears on the Power Rap
all-star album.
   A bond hearing was scheduled today for Anderson; his manager,
Reginald Lamont Jones, 27, of Nashville; his producer, Victor Roy
Wingo, 25, of Los Angeles; and Eric Dwayne Bratton, 25, a Los
Angeles musician. They were each charged with the one conspiracy
count after a raid Saturday.
   Police confiscated a kilogram of cocaine, a .44-caliber Magnum
pistol and about $53,000 in cash in two rooms at separate hotels,
said Sgt. J.D. Jones. Police said the group has been under
investigation for about a month. The cocaine has an estimated
wholesale value of $30,000, police said.

   Art Fletcher, a longtime adviser to
Republican presidents who may soon have a job in the Bush
administration, has been discharged from a hospital more than two
weeks after suffering a heart attack.
   Fletcher, 64, was taken to St. Elizabeth Medical Center
following the heart attack Nov. 3. He was discharged Sunday,
according to a hospital spokeswoman.
   Fletcher, a diabetic who suffered a heart attack in 1983,
underwent triple-bypass heart surgery last week.
   He has said that he expects to be Bush's choice to head the
Civil Rights Commission when a vacancy occurs later this year. No
nomination has been made.
   Fletcher, who is from Washington state, was assistant secretary
of labor under President Nixon, deputy assistant for urban affairs
under President Ford and an adviser to President Reagan.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Capt. Rolf Mueller, an East German border
guard for 15 years, glanced at a woman's passport and cheerfully
waved her on. Behind him, dozens of East and West Berliners
streamed past unchecked.
   ``I used to be in charge of strict security. Now I'm a, well, a
sort of document checker .... It's a funny feeling,'' he said.
   As one of Mueller's colleagues put it, ``I've become a tourist
attraction.''
   For years, the guards kept people inside East Germany, manned
lookout posts, asked questions, and scrutinized the papers of
anyone showing up at a checkpoint.
   Their icy-cold stares were legendary. They hauled off to jail
East Germans caught trying to flee. They sometimes killed would-be
escapees with gunfire.
   Now, tourists take their photographs and spectators crowd round
them. Their main problem is keeping the lines of cars and
pedestrians moving through the Berlin Wall and other frontier
points.
   The guards are not visibly armed. One said they were issued
pistols instead of automatic rifles after the borders to the West
were opened on Nov. 9.
   Mueller, 39, looked happy and relaxed in his new role. ``I like
this job,'' he added. ``It's very good to see the people of my
country come and go freely _and they still respect me.''
   But others are tight-lipped and many of the guards appear a
shade uneasy standing at an open door.
   Except for Mueller, guards approached at six crossing points
asked not to be identified by name. Some refused to talk or gave
stilted responses.
   According to the London-based International Institute of
Strategic Studies, the Berlin Guard Regiment has 7,000 members and
another 47,000 Defense Ministry troops are assigned to guard East
Germany's other borders.
   Since the abrupt decision by the embattled Communist leaders of
East Germany to let the country's 16.5 million citizens travel
freely, more than 6 million have visited West Germany.
   At the wall next to Potsdamer Platz, a guard looked embarrassed
as a giggling teen-age girl shoved a red carnation into his hand.
   ``I've become a tourist attraction,'' he declared. ``There's no
order here any more.''
   Mueller was among about a dozen East German guards posted at the
Glienicke Bridge on the outskirts of Berlin last week. It was the
scene of East-West spy swaps in the days of the Cold War.
   Previously, only diplomats were allowed to cross the Glienicke
Bridge.
   ``We had perhaps 10 people on a busy day,'' said the officer in
charge, recalling the earlier days. ``In one hour this morning, we
had about 10,000. How many by now _ who knows?
   ``We're getting as many people through with as few problems as
possible _ that's my job now.''
   Officers at a customs post set up since the bridge opened stood
by while people walked past, some toting bulging plastic bags or
stereos.
   A gray-haired customs officer shrugged. He predicted a surge in
smuggling of currency and antiques but said no one had been
searched.
   ``It's impossible to control anything now,'' he said. ``Perhaps
when things settle down a bit.''
   Nearby, a corporal said he used to read a lot during his
eight-hour shifts at the bridge.
   ``Hardly anyone ever came here,'' he said. ``To me, what has
happened now is unbelievable. I've got to adapt. But this is still
a border, and it should remain one, an economic and political one.
East Germans must not lose pride in their country.''
   The corporal, like other guards questioned, said he hadn't
crossed the border for a visit himself and had no plans to quit the
military or leave East Germany.
   ``I'm a Communist, and this is my country,'' he said.
   Since the 99-mile Berlin Wall was built in 1961, at least 80
people have died trying to escape, including 61 shot by East German
guards, and about 3,300 were arrested, according to West Berlin
police estimates.
   The last person shot while fleeing was a 20-year-old waiter
killed Feb. 5. A month later, East Germany announced it had ordered
guards not to shoot to kill.

<HEAD>Judges Dismissing More Discrimination Claims After Supreme Court
Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court ruling narrowing a civil
rights law's application is sowing confusion among lawyers and
discouraging new litigation, according to a new report.
   The decision ``has had very serious and regrettable consequences
for the men and women who live with the intractable realities of
racial discrimination,'' the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational
Fund Inc. said Sunday.
   The group's survey of lower federal court decisions showed that
judges dismissed at least 96 discrimination claims since the
Supreme Court's June 15 ruling.
   The court decided that employees could not sue under the Civil
Rights Act of 1866 to press claims of racial harassment on the job.
   The report said the ruling has led to confusion among judges and
lawyers, discouraged new litigation and hampered efforts to settle
pending cases out of court.
   The 5-4 ruling by the Supreme Court said the 1866 law was
enacted by Congress to allow newly freed slaves to negotiate and
enforce contracts.
   The high court held that it prohibited discrimination in hiring
but not racial harassment once a person was employed.
   The Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of a suit filed under the
law by Brenda Patterson, a credit-union teller who claimed she was
subjected to racial slurs and denied wage increases by her white
employers because she is black.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said Sunday the NAACP survey
``demonstrates that serious loopholes exist in our civil rights
laws. Legislation to repair the damage caused by the Supreme
Court's decisions in 1989 must be one of the top priorities of
Congress in 1990.''
   Only 22 of the claims dismissed between June 15 and Nov. 1
involved racial or ethnic harassment but they ``illustrate the
egregious nature of the forms of harassment'' no longer covered by
the law, the report said.
   In one case, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals summarily
dismissed a racial harassment suit involving a black woman who
claimed her supervisor made repeated sexual and racial remarks,
showing her pictures of interracial couples performing sexual acts.
   Courts dismissed claims of racial discrimination in 31 firings
and 16 other cases over failure to grant promotions or transfers
because of race. In addition, eight claims of employer retaliation
and six discriminatory demotion complaints were dismissed.
   Seven complaints that did not involve employment discrimination
were dismissed along with six miscellaneous complaints involving
the workplace.
   The dismissal orders were entered in 50 cases, some of which may
also raise claims of other civil rights violations. But the study
identified seven cases that will be abandoned altogether because of
the rulings.
   ``The decision in Patterson leaves clear only two things about
the scope of section 1981: a racially motivated refusal to hire
violates an employee's rights ... and a practice of racial
harassment adopted after an employee was hired, does not,'' the
report said.
   ``The Supreme Court's decision leaves in an entirely confused
state the application of section 1981 to other discriminatory
employment practices,'' said the report, written by Eric Schnapper,
an attorney for the New York-based defense group.
   The report noted that on successive days last August, two
federal judges in Chicago gave opposite rulings on whether the law
prohibited firings in retaliation for complaints about racial
discrimination.
   Congress is drafting legislation to overturn the effect of four
Supreme Court decisions involving civil rights last spring,
including the Patterson case. A bill is expected to be introduced
early next year.
   The Bush administration said it opposes such legislation without
determining the impact of the four decisions on civil rights
litigation.
   So far, the Justice Department has not found any evidence to
suggest that such legislation is needed but officials are
continuing to review the effect of those decisions, said spokesman
David Runkel.
   Runkel said he had not seen the NAACP Inc. Fund study but
suggested the ``results could be misleading'' because the decision
will force a shift of cases filed under the 1866 law to use of
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

<TEXT>
   When Mother Teresa visited the United States,
it was Charles H. Keating Jr. who lent his helicopter to her to
visit remote Indian reservations in the Southwest.
   Now this former Olympic swimmer and fighter pilot _ a benefactor
of charities and politicians, a battler of pornographers and
bureaucrats _ is the lead character in the costliest savings and
loan failure in the nation's history and a Capitol Hill drama
threatening the political lives of five senators.
   Whether bestowing his largess on church, charities, civic
causes, business associates or politicians whose help he might want
some day, ``Charlie Keating'' has always done it with a touch of
flash.
   Typifying his desire for the spotlight, Keating insisted on
being the final witness in the final episode of six weeks of House
Banking Committee hearings into the growth and collapse of his
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.
   He got his wish and is scheduled to testify Tuesday.
   Originally orchestrated as a forum for building a case to oust
M. Danny Wall as the nation's top thrift regulator, the hearings
instead have evolved into a near-inquisition for the senators, to
whom Keating and his associates gave $1.3 million in his highly
public war with Lincoln's regulators.
   Although he was formally subpoenaed by the committee, Keating's
associates say he welcomes an opportunity to tell his side of the
Lincoln story: that it was regulators who created the S&amp;L
nightmare, not him.
   But just how forthcoming the Phoenix millionaire will be before
congressional inquisitors was unclear as of late last week. The
target of a criminal grand jury in Los Angeles, various
racketeering and fraud suits and ongoing investigations by three
federal agencies, Keating is being advised by some to keep his
silence.
   For Keating, that's a tall order. From his initial entry onto
the public stage as an anti-smut crusader, he has been anything but
silent.
   When the Home Loan Bank Board seized Lincoln last April _ two
years after the federal agency's examiners recommended _ Keating
bluntly asserted to reporters the purpose of his largess to elected
officeholders.
   ``One question, among the many raised in recent weeks, had to do
with whether my financial support in any way influenced several
political figures to take up my cause,'' he said. ``I want to say
in the most forceful way I can: I certainly hope so.''
   Four of five Keating says he meant to influence _ John Glenn,
D-Ohio; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Donald Riegle, D-Mich.; and Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz. _ have told the Senate Ethics Committee in
formal responses that they did no wrong. The fifth, John McCain,
R-Ariz., will submit his response to the formal committee inquiry
before Congress adjourns for Thanksgiving, according to a spokesman.
   But regulators have told the House panel they never had seen
such bold political interference as Keating engineered.
   ``We've never experienced a guy who had so much juice,'' said
William Crawford, California's savings and loan commissioner.
   Altogether, regulators expect Lincoln's failure will cost
taxpayers up to $2 billion. They contend in a suit against Keating
that the losses stemmed from fraud, insider abuse and racketeering.
   ``If our recommendations had been followed, the taxpayers would
have suffered dramatically smaller losses,'' said William Black,
one of the four Bank Board officials summoned to meet with the five
senators.
   Born into a prominent Cincinnati family with strong Republican
connections, Keating, now 65, began a three-decade-long crusade
against pornography in the late 1950s.
   In 1970, he won an appointment from President Nixon to the
Federal Commission on Obscenity and Pornography as a self-described
``book burner.'' He promptly sued the commission to block
publication of its report until he could write a dissent to its
conclusion that pornography posed no threat.
   A lawyer by training, Keating turns to suits frequently in
waging his campaigns. He's filed several against the government
since buying Lincoln for $51 million in 1984 and converting it from
a traditional home mortgage lender into what critics say was the
epitome of the kind of highflier thrifts that were at the root of
industry problems that required a $157 billion taxpayer bailout.
   Other tactics include hiring away at large salaries the state
and federal regulators and private auditors charged with overseeing
his empire on behalf of the public.
   The Phoenix managing partner of Lincoln's auditor, the Big Eight
accounting firm of Arthur Young &amp; Co., helped set up the meetings
between the regulators and the senators with a report affirming
Lincoln's soundness. A year later, he joined Keating's payroll with
an annual salary of $950,000.
   Glenn, who accepted $200,000 in campaign donations from Keating,
recalled feeling ``livid'' when he learned that.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' he said. ``Absolutely I felt I was
led down the primrose path.'' Nonetheless, Glenn said he has no
intention of returning the $200,000 contribution.
   Those Keating didn't hire, he retained, such as Alan Greenspan,
formerly the president's chief economic adviser and now chairman of
the Federal Reserve Board. Then working as a private consultant,
Greenspan wrote a study in 1986 defending Keating's practices.
   Keating's business instincts and proclivity to spend whatever is
necessary to get what he wants were developed at the knee of Carl
H. Lindner, a reclusive Cincinnati billionaire who through
takeovers built American Financial Corp. into a banking, insurance,
real estate and meatpacking empire.
   It was as a vice president and director there that Keating had
his first run-in with financial regulators. After a three-year
investigation, the SEC accused the two of fraudulently diverting
company assets for their personal use.
   They eventually signed a consent decree in 1979 admitting no
wrong but promising never to do it again. Keating later said
signing the decree was a mistake, claiming it cost him an
appointment from President Reagan to be U.S. ambassador to the
Bahamas.
   About the time the SEC was launching its first investigation of
Keating, he moved to Phoenix to head Continental Homes Inc., a
troubled home-building subsidiary of American Financial.
   Two years later, in 1978, Keating bought out Continental Homes
and changed its name to American Continental Corp. and began doling
out large contributions to candidates for every office from city
council to the presidency.
   In 1980 he was the West Coast finance chairman in now-bankrupt
former Texas Gov. John B. Connally's short-lived campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination.
   There he met Lee Henkel Jr., an Atlanta tax lawyer and former
chief counsel at the IRS during part of the Nixon administration,
who was carrying out the same task for Connally on the East Coast.
   Six years later when Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Edwin Gray
and his staff began reining in the way some thrifts were operating,
Keating helped win Reagan's appointment of Henkel to the bank board.
   Henkel resigned from the board four months later after it was
disclosed he had loans or shared in partnerships with loans from
Lincoln totaling $60 million. But first he proposed changing the
board's regulations to exempt much of Lincoln's investments from
the newly imposed restrictions. The changes were rejected by the
board's other members.
   ``I have taken every action appropriate to rectify the
unwarranted bureaucratic assault ... waged against me and my
company,'' Keating said last April. ``In the contract between the
voter and the politician, we have the right to seek their help when
needed and demand it when justified. This I have done.''

<HEAD>$286 Billion Bill Sent to White House for Signature</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is expected to sign the
compromise $286 billion military spending bill, which cuts his
spending request for the Strategic Defense Initiative as well as
funds for the Trident 2 missile.
   The House gave the measure final congressional approval by a
voice vote on Sunday. It cuts $1.1 billion from Bush's $4.9 billion
fiscal 1990 proposal for SDI, the first budget reduction in the
Star Wars program in six years.
   Among other provisions is a cut of $400 million from the
administration's $1.8 billion request for procurement of the
Trident 2 missile and $11 million from Bush's proposal of $216
million for testing the problem-plagued missile.
   In August, the Trident 2 had its second successive failure in
undersea test firings, exploding seconds after being launched from
a nuclear submarine off the coast of Florida.
   Concerned about the troubled weapon, Congress agreed to prohibit
spending more than $250 million on the program until three
successful test flights have occurred.
   The legislation provides $4.3 billion for two B-2 stealth
bombers, $430 million and one plane less than the administration
sought in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The money also will be
used for some advance procurement costs for five planes to be
purchased in fiscal 1991, and for spare parts.
   Approximately $1.1 billion is included for the multiple-warhead,
rail-based MX and the single-warhead, truck-based Midgetman nuclear
missiles. The amount is about $150 million less than the
administration requested for the two weapons and includes House
language imposing a 50-missile cap on the MX.
   The legislation provides for the Navy's F-14D Tomcat jet fighter
and the Army Helicopter Improvement Program _ for one more year _
and postpones a decision on the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey and the
Phoenix missile.

   After eight days of consecutive gains, the key
index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell Monday, while the dollar
edged up against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 70.16
points, or 0.20 percent, ending at 35,893.58. It had gained 87.40
points for a record closing of 35,963.74 Friday.
   The dollar ended at 144.67 yen, 0.69 yen higher than Friday's
close of 143.98 yen. The currency opened at 144.58 yen and moved
between 144.50 yen and 144.75 yen.
   The index reversed its upward trend after its consecutive gains
for the eight trading days, as market players started to sell
issues for profit-taking, mainly due to a reluctance to raise share
prices further, dealers said.
   Nomura Securities' analyst said the yen's weakness also largely
discouraged investors' buying incentive.
   ``Amid uncertainties over the foreign exchange and interest
rates, many market players stepped off to the sidelines,'' the
analyst said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In currency dealings, the dollar, which opened higher in Tokyo
following gains in New York Friday, remained strong as market
players demanded the dollar for account settlements, traders said.
   A Bank of Tokyo trader said, ``There will be strong demand for
dollars'' during the next three days because of higher standards of
account settlement by Japanese firms this week than in a usual
week's level.
   Other traders said foreign banks were inclined to buy the U.S.
currency since they are expecting a cut by the U.S. government in
the nation's defense budget.
   The Bank of Tokyo trader added the dollar will remain strong
until exchange markets observe a holiday Thursday.

<DATELINE>GALENA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quaint brass plate above the front door of
Jim Holman's century-old home in this historic town hints that his
attitude isn't quite in step with preservationists: ``On This Site
in 1897, Nothing Happened.''
   The sentiment is Holman's way of thumbing his nose at his town's
love affair with the past and with the tourists who swarm to the
``Most Picturesque Community in the Midwest.''
   Galena, whose regular population of 3,800 sometimes triples with
weekend visitors, has spent years sticking with its careful zoning
laws and strict adherence to federal historic preservation
guidelines.
   But Holman and some fellow residents are fed up with having to
maintain what they fear is becoming a living museum of antiquated
small-town life.
   ``We feel confined,'' Holman said recently at a gathering in his
home with several members of the newly formed Citizens Against
Excessive Zoning.
   ``We're not at ease even in our own homes. We feel like the
concerns of lifelong and long-term Galenans take a backseat to
weekend Galenans.''
   City officials, including zoning administrator Rik Fjelde, have
a different view.
   ``If you own a house in the historic district, you have a
certain obligation to maintain it, and that's the preference of the
majority of citizens or it wouldn't be that way,'' Fjelde said.
   Almost every resident of Galena lives in the historic district,
whose pleasing orderliness, tucked perfectly into the hills near
the northwest corner of the state, recalls a Currier and Ives print.
   Mayor Terry Cole, elected in May, has made it a priority to
enforce zoning and preservation ordinances. For property owners,
that means only Federalist-style doors on Federalist-style houses.
   The attention to historical detail can be expensive. A few
months ago, Holman bought $200 worth of wooden railroad ties to
complete a fence around his yard. No sooner had he gotten it up
than Fjelde told him he would have to take it down and replace the
ties with more historically correct stone.
   ``The lowest bid I could get for stone to make a wall was
$3,600,'' he said.
   That's when Holman, who works in the maintenance department of a
chemical company in East Dubuque, wrote a letter to a newspaper
seeking responses from others frustrated with the regulations.
   Holman said he was deluged with calls, leading to his committee.
The group has started petition drives aimed at securing elected
rather than appointed members of the zoning-appeals board and the
historic-district advisory board, as well as the removal of Fjelde.
   City attorney John Cox, however, said both boards are advisory
and under Illinois statute, local voters can't make them elective
bodies.
   ``He's probably right,'' said Charlie Petitgout, vice chairman
of the committee and owner of an electrical shop. ``But the main
reason we did this was to get the city to pay attention to our
problems.''

<HEAD>Death of Buck Helm a Grim Reminder of Quake</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The death of Buck Helm, who amazed
rescuers by surviving four days beneath tons of concrete in a
collapsed freeway, was a grim reminder of the destruction wrought
by the Northern California earthquake.
   Just 20 hours earlier, residents cheered the reopening of the
San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge as a symbol of recovery from the
Oct. 17 quake, which toppled a 50-foot section of the span, killed
67 people and caused $7 billion in damage.
   ``I'm sure this will hit a lot of people hard,'' said Steve
Whipple, the state Department of Transportation engineer who found
Helm in the early hours of Oct. 21.
   ``I was under the impression that he was going to make it,''
Whipple said. ``It was just going to take a long while.''
   Helm, who turned 58 on Nov. 10, died of respiratory failure at
Kaiser Permanente Medical Center on Saturday evening, 28 days after
his rescue.
   The rescue of the burly longshoreman's clerk buoyed spirits of
rescuers depressed by the rising death toll in the collapse of
Interstate 880 in Oakland _ and cheered people across the country
who watched the drama on television.
   ``I'm still glad we found him and gave him a better fighting
chance than he would have had otherwise,'' Whipple added. ``It
picked our spirits up and made all our work worth it.''
   Other rescuers said they have grown accustomed to deaths from
the quake.
   ``It's a shame that (Helm) couldn't have made it, but I guess
that's the way life goes _ you don't have any promises,'' said
Alfred Anderson, a construction worker who was clearing rubble from
the collapsed 1.25-mile section of freeway when Helm was found,
alive and trapped in his compact car.
   ``To many, Buck had become a symbol of survival and hope,''
Helm's family said in a statement.
   ``For the Helms, the thousands of cards and letters from all
corners of the world gave Buck and the family strength and
encouragement, and for that they are forever grateful,'' said the
release issued by Gary Frischer, a Beverly Hills spokesman hired by
the family after Helm was rescued.
   ``He represented more than just a person. I think to many people
he very much represented the event of the earthquake,'' said Ron
Treleven, a Kaiser Permanente spokesman.
   The 220-pound, 5-foot-10 Helm suffered a fractured skull,
fractured neck, three broken ribs, nerve damage to his leg and
kidney problems caused by dehydration. He also had diabetes and
high blood pressure.
   Others were rescued from the freeway immediately after the
quake, but Helm was the only survivor to be pulled from the
wreckage after crews began gingerly searching through rubble
remaining on the teetering structure.
   Helm worked on the docks in Oakland and commuted 250 miles to
the small town of Weaverville on weekends to be with his family and
friends.
   His former wife, Lorrie Helm, said he acknowledged hearing his
family read the cards and letters sent to him by well-wishers,
although he couldn't speak or otherwise communicate.

   A sniper shot a police officer in the chest and
back, but his bulletproof vest saved him from serious injury,
authorities said.
   Officer Michael Lisi, 33, had just finished writing a traffic
ticket Sunday evening when he heard a shot from a wooded area along
the Staten Island road, said Sgt. Edward Burns, a police spokesman.
   Lisi ran into the woods to investigate and felt something hit
him in the chest, Burns said. He turned and another shot hit him on
the back, the spokesman said.
   ``His protective vest stopped both bullets,'' said Burns.
   Lisi was taken to Staten Island Hospital for a minor injury,
Burns said.
   Police did not believe the shooting was connected to the traffic
ticket.
   No arrests were made and the weapon was not recovered.

<HEAD>Stocks Fall, Dollar Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index fell today
after advancing in eight consecutive trading days, while the dollar
edged higher against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 144.67 yen, up 0.69 yen from Friday's
143.98-yen finish. The currency opened at 144.58 yen and moved
narrowly between 144.50 yen and 144.75 yen.
   Japanese investors, among them trading houses and investment
trusts, bought the dollar on rumours the U.S. defense budget will
be cut, said Toru Nomura, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan
Securities, Co.
   When the dollar hit its high of 144.75 yen in morning trading,
market players stopped buying on concern over dollar-selling
intervention by the Bank of Japan, he said.
   The Bank of Japan sold an estimated $200 million when the dollar
topped 144.60 during the morning session, he said. Japan's central
bank does not comment on its monetary activities.
   Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita said today it is
necessary for the central bank ``to maintain close coordination
with other countries to keep currencies stable,'' and ``to take
appropriate measures.''
   Denying speculation that the central bank may raise the discount
rate again soon, Sumita said the central bank is studying the
effectiveness of previous base rate increases.
   The bank has raised its official key rate twice this year, to
the current 3.75 percent, to prevent the yen from sliding further
and to ward off inflation.
   ``His comments on the discount rate discouraged Japanese
investors' yen-buying incentives and the strengthened dollar rose
back afterwards,'' Kanai said, predicting little movement in
currency markets ahead of Thursday's Labor Thanksgiving holiday in
Japan, when Japan's financial markets will be closed.
   On the stock exchange, the market's key index reversed its
uptrend after its earlier gains, as market players started to sell
issues for profit-taking, dealers said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 70.16 points, or 0.20
percent, ending at 35,893.58. It gained 87.40 points for a record
closing of 35,963.74 on Friday.
   Nomura Securities analyst Yoshiro Inoue said the yen's weakness
against the dollar dampened buying incentives.
   Trading houses, however, posted gains due to expectations of
expanding business opportunities with the Soviet Union following a
recent visit by Alexander Yakovlev, a top advisor to Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   An estimated 700 million shares changed hands on the first
section in sluggish trading, down from last Friday's 900 million.

<HEAD>Two Months After Hugo, Even Counselors Are Receiving Counseling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM STRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every time a breeze stirs, Jackie
Puckett's mind races back to that horrible September night when
Hurricane Hugo smashed into Charleston and devastated the state.
   ``It's hard for me to hear the wind blow and not to think of 135
mph winds,'' said Puckett, who coordinates a 24-hour mobile crisis
unit in Charleston that offers help for the mentally ill and
hurricane victims.
   ``I'll probably always remember that sound, and I'll probably
never be able to be in high winds without having a twinge.''
   Puckett is among those coping with that reminder of the Sept. 21
storm, which killed 29 in South Carolina and caused an estimated $4
billion in damage, while helping hurricane victims confront
psychological trauma.
   Two months after the storm, even counselors are receiving
counseling.
   ``I think what was unusual about Hugo was that it traumatized
half of our state directly,'' said Nancy Carter, one of the state
mental health department's two emergency response coodinators,
``while the other half of the state has been traumatized responding
and helping our victims.'' Twenty-four of the state's 46 counties
have been declared disaster areas.
   The state mental health department conservatively estimates that
60,000 people will need counseling. The agency arrived at the
figure by using a formula recommended by the National Institute of
Mental Health that takes into consideration deaths and homes
damaged or destroyed.
   Mental health officials said they do not know how many hurricane
victims have come into regional mental health centers or been
visited by counselors going door to door, which account for about
80 percent of the therapy. Nor do the officials know how many
counselors are helping victims.
   Puckett's crisis unit, a team of six counselors, has seen 250
people on an emergency basis so far in November, compared with
about 75 in a normal month. The symptoms run the gamut:
disorientation, agitation, grief, bewilderment, hopelessness,
depression, suicidal tendencies, hostility, survival guilt and
sleep disorders.
   The hurricane traumatized the mentally and emotionally ill
already undergoing treatment. But it also deeply affected many who
had never before sought counseling.
   ``We've had calls on people we've never seen before, people who
are affluent, who have resources ... who've never been in a
position of calling for help. They're used to ... pretty much
getting along,'' Puckett said.
   Many relate their experiences to a dream: They hope to awake
soon and find their lives back to normal.
   Counselors help victims accept the situation ``and then try to
rebuild their world,'' Puckett said. ``We try to make an
environment for them to feel safe and secure.''
   Counselors also try to calm fears that another natural disaster
will strike.
   ``We can't predict another one won't hit. But what we can do is
take what we know to be true and work with that,'' he said,
alluding to Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance,
victims' survival and the historical data about the infrequency of
hurricanes striking Charleston.
   Helped by federal aid, the state has added counselors and
administrative staff. Last month, the state received a $300,000
FEMA grant covering the first 60 days of relief; the state hired
about 25 counselors on a temporary basis with the money.
   Today, the state planned to apply for a $1.5 million grant that
would extend through the next nine months.
   ``It seems like there's never enough (counselors),'' Puckett
said.
   That's creating problems for the care-givers, many of whom are
suffering from emotional and physical exhaustion, officials said.
   As a result, counselors are helping counselors.
   The South Carolina Baptist Convention, for instance, is offering
counseling to church ministers and others who have given advice to
hurricane victims.
   ``We've seen a lot of ministers and a lot of lay people who hit
the wall emotionally and had a lot of emotional questions, a lot of
spiritual questions,'' said George W. Bullard Jr., a church
spokesman.

<HEAD>Eds: Chillicothe is pronounced Chil-li-CAH-thee.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSH LEMIEUX</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHILLICOTHE, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People in Livingston County say it's a
friendly place. Folks trust each other, and nobody ever imagined it
as a site for a series of slayings.
   But three bodies were pulled from hidden graves in a barn Oct.
16. A week later, a body was found in another barn, shot in the
head like the others. And up to nine men are missing.
   Last week, an elderly farm couple in the northwestern Missouri
county was charged in three killings, and people here say they're
shaken by one of the largest and strangest murder investigations in
the state.
   Prosecutors say Ray Copeland, 75, and his 68-year-old wife,
Faye, hired drifters to buy cattle with bad checks, conspiring to
keep the proceeds when the animals were resold and killing the
transients to keep them from talking.
   The Copelands were charged in the three deaths in which the
victims have been identified. They could face the death penalty if
convicted. Their lawyers say they will plead innocent at a hearing
set for later this month, and accuse prosecutors of running a
``media circus'' against their clients.
   Dale Johnson of Chillicothe made his first-ever visit to the
county courthouse a week ago to watch the Copelands arrive for
their arraignment. Like others in this town of 10,000, he's shaken
by the case.
   ``It's a friendly community. Everybody respects everybody,'' he
said. Usually, news about gruesome killings comes from big cities,
Johnson said, but ``it's close to home this time.''
   ``We're just normal people,'' said Johnson, one of the few
people here who would allow his name to be published. ``People come
and go. We don't mind other people's business, just take care of
our own.''
   Authorities acting on a tip arrested the Copelands on Oct. 9 and
charged them with conspiracy in connection with a bad check. That
day, officers began digging on the 40-acre farm where the Copelands
have lived for 24 years.
   Officers found no bodies at the site near Moresville, about 10
miles west of here. But in the following two weeks, four bodies
were found at two farms where Copeland had done odd jobs. The
investigation into the fourth death is continuing, as is the effort
to find the missing men. Sheriff Leland O'Dell said 100 sites in
the county have already been searched.
   The victims whose names are known _ Paul J. Cowart, 21, of
Dardanelle, Ark.; John W. Freeman, 27, of Tulsa, Okla.; and Jimmie
Dale Harvey, 27, of Springfield, _ are described as transients who
worked for the Copelands.
   All had stayed at a mission in Springfield, 180 miles to the
south, where Copeland recruited his workers. Prosecutors believe
they all died during the past two years. The names of the nine
others have not been made public. But they are also believed to
have worked for the Copelands during the past three or four years,
authorities said.
   The Copelands remain jailed on $500,000 bond apiece. And the man
whose tip led to the investigation remains jailed.
   Jack McCormick is being held in neighboring Sullivan County,
unable to make bond as he awaits a December trial in a bad check
case.
   McCormick, 57, said he began working for Copelands on July 26
and was recruited from the same mission where the dead men had
stayed. He left Aug. 10, shortly after writing the checks that led
to the charge against him.
   In a telephone interview from jail, McCormick said Copeland told
him ``I'd get a chance to gain some respect. That's how he got me
interested.'' Copeland offered $50 per day plus room and board, and
set up a checking account for McCormick to buy cattle. McCormick
said he didn't know two checks he passed were bad.
   Ten days after leaving the Copelands', McCormick reported what
he knew to a crime hotline, and that started the investigation that
led to the couple's arrest and the search for the bodies.
Meanwhile, though, bad-check charges were lodged against McCormick,
and he was eventually arrested in Oregon.
   McCormick won't describe exactly what made him flee the Copeland
farm, but said ``I did come close to getting killed.'' Police said
he told them he had found a human skull and leg bone.
   He got a $500 reward for the tip, but the check charges have not
been dropped. Kenny Hulshof, an assistant state attorney general
assigned to the Copeland case, said that as far as his office is
concerned, ``there are not going to be any deals made. Certainly
we're glad he called, but he did what any citizen should have
done.''
   McCormick said Copeland asked him whether he was close to his
family.
   ``He was quite surprised to hear that I did have relatives''
around Springfield, McCormick said.
   ``He said, `Well, I guess you're not too close to them,'''
McCormick recalled. ``He went on to add that working for him, I
wouldn't have time to talk to relatives.''

   Nearby residents said the
Church of San Roque of war refugees after soldiers raided it again,
pounding the walls with rifle butts and scanning books in search of
``subversive'' literature.
   Two American nuns said it was the second time in five days that
soldiers came to the San Salvador church, terrifying families who
had taken refuge there from fighting between troops and leftist
rebels.
   ``They kept accusing us of hiding weapons,'' said Sister
Catherine Arata, 48, of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, a
teaching order based in Maryland. ``They were shouting at us: `Why
are you here? Why don't you go back to the United States?'''
   The nuns said the first raid Wednesday on the church made them
realize it was not a safe sanctuary.
   On Thursday, six Jesuit priests were killed in a dormitory at a
university. Right-wing death squads, involving men in military
uniforms, have been accused of that massacre.
   After Wednesday's raid, the nuns began trying to move the
refugees out, but there were still 30 in the church when the
soldiers came back Sunday.
   After that, the nuns were afraid of spending another night in
the church. But Sister Elena Jaramillo, 45, of the Sisters of St.
Joseph in Orange County, Calif., said ``We don't want to leave
until the last refugee is out.''
   She said she was frightened that the dawn-to-dusk curfew would
trap them in the church and she feared for her life.
   An Associated Press correspondent went by the church just before
curfew Sunday, and it was locked and shuttered. Nearby residents
said the people inside had been taken away by Red Cross vehicles.
   Both nuns are suffering from hepatitis and came to San Salvador
from the provinces for medical treatment. They were caught in the
city when the rebels launched their biggest offensive of the
10-year-old war on Nov. 11.
   Luis Cruz, coordinator of refugee services at the San Jacinto
parish church, said security forces also have made raids there,
searching people and demanding lists of refugees' names. He said
that police on Thursday took away two young men who had sought
sanctuary in the church.
   Some military officers and members of the right-wing governing
party have publicly accused Roman Catholic priests, Protestant
ministers and church workers helping El Salvador's poor of aiding
the guerrillas.
   More than a dozen Lutheran church workers were deported last
week after being picked up by security forces.
   Sister Catherine said soldiers spent more than four hours in the
Church of San Roque on Sunday. She said they pounded on the floors
and walls, apparently looking for hiding places, searched the
clinic and small library, and confiscated a children's book and
several publications.
   She reported one soldier told her, ``You people are trying to
teach class divisions. Don't you know there is only one class
here?''
   Sister Elena said another soldier demanded to know where the
clinic's medicine came from.
   ``I said, `It comes from the same place your uniforms come
from,''' the gray-haired nun said. The United States has provided
about $3.5 billion in aid to El Salvador in the past decade.

   The director of the National Cancer Institute
says a newspaper's almost book-length account of the discovery of
the cause of AIDS is offensive and is ``impugning two of the
leading figures in AIDS research.''
   The 50,000-word story that filled 16 pages in the Chicago
Tribune Sunday tells a story of ``commitment and dedication to
mankind'' and of ``cutthroat competition and bare-knuckled
politics, of individual ego and national pride,'' the paper said.
   The story described in great detail but did not resolve
allegations made several years ago that Robert Gallo, the American
scientist credited as co-discoverer of the AIDS virus, accidentally
or deliberately claimed the first sample of the virus _ isolated in
France _ as his own.
   ``What happened in Robert Gallo's lab during the winter of
1983-84 is a mystery that may never be entirely solved,'' the story
says.
   The Tribune's story includes information obtained through the
Freedom of Information Act and in more than 150 interviews
conducted over 20 months, the paper says.
   The discovery of the AIDS virus, which was crucial to the
development of tests for AIDS and drugs to fight it, is now
credited to Gallo and Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in
Paris.
   Dr. Samuel Broder, the director of the National Cancer
Institute, said in a telephone interview Saturday: ``I know both
Drs. Gallo and Montagnier. Their motivation is to alleviate death
and suffering. It is a grievous insult to impugn or attach any
other motive.''
   The Tribune article, he said, ``is impugning the two leading
figures in AIDS research. For what purpose? Gallo and Montagnier
are excellent scientists and don't deserve this.''
   Gallo, who directs AIDS virus research at the National Cancer
Institute in Bethesda, Md., said it is possible that he
accidentally confused the French virus sample with his own samples.
``We'll never know,'' he said. But he denied that he was guilty of
any wrongdoing.
   He said it was a ``moot point, because there are many other
isolates'' of the virus he had discovered himself. Gallo made his
remarks in a telephone interview Saturday. He had not seen the
Chicago Tribune story.

   Snow ushered in Thanksgiving week in New England today, while
parts of the Midwest and the mid-Atlantic states enjoyed
unseasonably mild weather.
   Skies were clear over much of the nation early today, but snow
fell in Portland, Maine; Albany, N.Y.; and Boston. Up to 4 inches
of snow was predicted today across northern Vermont and New
Hampshire, and lesser amounts were expected in upstate New York and
Massachusetts.
   Snow also was expected in northern Wisconsin and perhaps
elsewhere in the Great Lakes region.
   Unseasonably warm weather in Iowa and surrounding states over
the weekend was expected to linger into this morning, but fade away
as winds shifted to the north, bringing more seasonable
temperatures.
   Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia were expected to
get a respite from fall, with high temperatures climbing into the
60s. But a cold front was expected to move in tonight.
   Temperatures a much as 25 degrees above normal for mid-November
were recorded in the upper Plains states and upper Mississippi
Valley over the weekend, and Denver had its warmest November day in
117 years Sunday.
   Denver's 79-degree reading eclipsed by 2 degrees a standard that
has stood since 1897.
   Other record highs Sunday included Oakland, Calif., 75;
Dickinson, N.D., 61; Goodland, Kan., 77; and Grand Island, Neb., 72.
   The day's high was 96 at Camp Pendleton, Calif.

   Hundreds of Tamils and Moslems fled
today from an eastern district after fierce fighting between an
outlawed Tamil militia and the Sri Lankan army, which was moving in
more reinforcements, residents said.
   In southern and central Sri Lanka, at least 40 people were
reported killed in the struggle that continues between the
government and the extremist People's Liberation Front despite last
week's capture and killing of the front's top three leaders.
   A government official said the widow of the front's supreme
leader has been placed under guard in a Colombo luxury hotel and is
seeking permission to leave the country with her five children.
   The ultra-nationalist front, comprised of members of the
country's Sinhalese majority, accuses the government of granting
minority Tamil separatists too many concessions.
   The fighting in the eastern Ampara district erupted in the power
vacuum left by Indian peacekeeping troops who pulled out last month
as part of the phased withdrawal that is to be completed by Dec. 31.
   At least 100 people were killed Thursday and Friday when Tamil
militiamen attacked a half dozen police stations, then battled
government soldiers and police commandos, according to government
accounts.
   A military spokesman in Colombo said a battle raged for 2{ hours
Sunday after 200 members of the so-called Tamil National Army
attacked an army camp at Kalmunai 125 miles east of the capital.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with government
regulations, he said 10 soldiers, all Sinhalese, were critically
wounded but the attack was repulsed. He gave no further casualty
figures.
   Residents in Batticaloa, 20 miles north of Kalmunai, said
hundreds of Moslem and Tamil civilians were fleeing Ampara and
Kalmunai and seeking refuge in Hindu temples, Christian churches
and schools.
   The residents, who were contacted by telephone and spoke on
condition of anonymity, quoted the refugees as saying the Sri
Lankan army was continuing to move in armor and reinforcements, as
well as helicopter gunships.
   Government statements blamed the outbreak of violence on the
Tamil National Army, which it says was illegally formed. Army
troops earlier were empowered to shoot members of the militia on
sight.
   The Tamil revolt started in 1983 when militants sought to create
a separate homeland from their ethnic minority in northeastern Sri
Lanka. More than 11,000 people have been killed in fighting and
massacres since then.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese majority, which
controls the government and military.
   Tamils are mostly Hindus. Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of
the population, are mostly Buddhists. Both ethnic groups also
include Christians. Moslems, who claim descent from Arab traders,
make up 7 percent.

   The dollar was up slightly against other major
currencies in quiet European trading today.
   Bullion prices were up sharply in moderate trading.
   European foreign exchange dealers said they expected trading to
stay quiet in the absence of any important U.S. economic indicators
due out this week.
   A national holiday in West Germany on Wednesday coupled with the
Thanksgiving holiday in the United States on Thursday have robbed
the market of enthusiasm, dealers said.
   ``There's no interest,'' said one Frankfurt trader. ``No one
wants to do anything. It's very quiet and will stay quiet all
week.''
   Roger Lever, a senior dealer at Arab Banking Corp. in London,
said U.S. defense cuts confirmed Sunday by U.S. Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney will not have much impact on the dollar, especially
since any favorable effects on the U.S. budget deficit will take
some time to emerge, he said.
   In earlier trading in Japan investors bought dollars on rumors
that the U.S. defense budget was being cut. Dealers said the Bank
of Japan intervened selling dollars to keep the yen from falling
too far.
   Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita said it is necessary for
central banks ``to maintain close coordination with other countries
to keep currencies stable'' and ``to take appropriate measures.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.69 yen to a closing 144.67 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 144.70 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.8439 West German marks, up from 1.8410
   _1.6325 Swiss francs, up from 1.6315
   _6.2700 French francs, up from 6.2590
   _2.0832 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0770
   _1,354.00 Italian lire, up from 1,353.50
   _1.1705 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1697
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5560 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5705 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $396.90 a troy ounce,
compared with late Friday's $392.25. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $396.05.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $395.90 compared with $391.50 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 21 cents to close at a bid
$396.40.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.74 a troy
ounce, up from Friday's $5.61.

<TEXT>
   Speakers told a rally the day after the
largest pro-democracy protest ever held in Communist Bulgaria that
their new leader deserves praise for allowing such unprecedented
freedom of speech.
   But they also expressed fears that the new Communist Party
chief, Petar Mladenov, would would show a limited tolerance for
dissent and not grant Bulgarians the freedoms they demand.
   About 2,000 people rallied Sunday to demand more democracy,
condemn the ruling Communists and praise the ouster earlier this
month of longtime hard-line leader Todor Zhivkov.
   The protest, organized by independent human rights and ecology
groups, at was held in South Park in Sofia, the capital. Such a
protest would certainly have been suppressed by police only weeks
ago.
   ``There will be no democracy in Bulgaria unless we introduce
free elections with candidates from different groups and not only
from the Communist Party,'' said one speaker.
   On Saturday, more than 50,000 people gathered on the Alexander
Nevski Square in downtown Sofia to demand more democracy, free
elections, respect of human rights and an end to the 45 years of
police repression that began after Soviet tanks rolled in.
   Police did not intervene in either protest, despite
unprecedented harsh criticism of Bulgarian official policy voiced
by many speakers. Parliament on Friday scrapped a law against
dissent.
   The latest protests follow the political downfall Nov. 10 of
Zhivkov. His successor, Petar Mladenov, who is considered more
moderate.
   ``For years we have been promised radical changes in our
society, but it always turned out to be a ... carnival in which
only masks were changed but the policy remained the same,'' Radoi
Ralin, a leading Bulgarian dissident writer, said in an interview.
   ``That is why we should not be too enthusiastic about the latest
changes. We have to see what the new leaders have to offer us
soon,'' Ralin added.
   Protesters signed petitions written by the independent
Ecoglasnost group that criticized criminal prosecution of
dissidents, demanded the release of political prisoners, and called
for closing Bulgaria's only nuclear power station.

   A strong earthquake jolted southeastern
Iran early today, killing at least three people and injuring 45 as
it toppled homes, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
   The agency said the quake measured 6 on the Richter Scale and
shook the entire province of Kerman, home to more than 1 million
people.
   IRNA quoted officials in Kerman as saying that casualty reports
were still being assessed. Hardest hit were the cities of Golbaf
and Shahdad, east of the provincial capital, Kerman, IRNA said.
   An earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter Scale devastated a
number of villages in the same region in July 1981, killing 1,200
persons and injuring 1,400.
   Kerman, and neigboring Fars province to the west, are frequently
hit by earthquakes. Seven villages were severely damaged and four
people hurt in an earthquake that shook Fars in May.
   Some 300 earthquakes, measuring upto 4.6 on the Richter scale,
were registered in a month in Fars earlier this year.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released
by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means the ground motion
is 10 times greater.
   A quake registering 6 on the scale can cause severe damage.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Government Expanding Investigation of IBM Equipment Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators are looking into a
possible second instance of the government's paying for new
International Business Machines Corp. equipment only to receive
used goods, according to a published report.
   The Sun reported today that IBM acknowledged last week it had
inadvertantly sold the government used equipment mislabeled as new
in 1984 and 1985.
   IBM said it voluntarily alerted the government to the error as
soon as it was discovered in February 1987 and has been cooperating
in a General Services Administration investigation. The company
attributed the mix-up to administrative error.
   The Sun said a second case involving used IBM equipment is also
now under review, this one in connection with a $544 million Navy
contract awarded to Electronic Data Systems Corp., a major supplier
of IBM equipment, in August 1987. EDS specializes in designing
sophisticated computer systems.
   The contract under review called for EDS to supply computer
software, hardware and services to the Navy.
   Under the EDS bid, IBM hardware and software accounted for about
$134 million of the total $544 million award.
   According to unnamed sources quoted by the Sun, Navy personnel
contacted the FBI after discovering the IBM equipment were used and
not new as required by the contract.
   The newspaper said the FBI is investigating to determine whether
the mix-up was intentional and whether blame belongs to EDS, IBM or
the Navy.
   For the past nine months, the House Government Operations
Committee has been examining allegations the Navy has improperly
favored IBM over other computer makers. Committee hearings are
expected to conclude later this week.

   Striking New England Telephone Co. workers began
returning to their jobs today, 15 weeks after contract talks broke
down in August.
   Members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
voted to ratify a new contract Sunday with the NYNEX Corp., parent
to New England Telephone.
   Peter Cronin, spokesman for the company, said late Sunday, ``We
are very pleased that our employees have ratified the contract.''
   About 18,000 IBEW workers went on strike on Aug. 6. The walkout
caused long delays in directory assistance, repairs and
installation services.
   About 40,000 NYNEX workers in New York also have been on strike,
but talks broke off over the weekend between the phone company and
the CWA, which represents the New York employees.
   NYNEX had resolved the larger, regional issues with the unions
last week, covering wages and benefits. Then late Friday night,
IBEW and company negotiators completed a tentative agreement on
local issues.
   Striking IBEW members voted 7-1 in favor of both the regional
and local packages, said George Nadeau, chairman of the T6 Council
in Maine, the administrative branch of the 10 regional locals where
the results were tallied.
   ``Both have been accepted on a comfortable margin,'' Nadeau said
following the final tally Sunday night.
   The vote in New England was held at union locals across the
region. But the contract did not win favor by IBEW members in
Boston.
   Dennis Banks, a business agent for the Boston IBEW, said a sore
point with the union was NET's use of outside contractors to
perform certain jobs. As part of the local negotiations, union
officials wanted the company to end this practice, ``or at least
put a cap on it,'' Banks said.

<BYLINE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with Romanian leader rejecting change, NATO
ambassadors boycotting party congress. ^By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To the adulation of his faithful,
President Nicolae Ceausescu today rejected the democratic reforms
sweeping most of the rest of the East bloc in a five-hour speech to
a congress of the ruling Communist Party.
   ``The ruling out of the capitalist system ... is the leading
requirement for the creation of a just society,'' the orthodox
leader told more than 3,000 delegates packing downtown Palace Hall.
   Many Western ambassadors boycotted the gathering to protest
human rights violations under Ceausescu.
   The Romanian leader has also become increasingly isolated in the
East bloc as one-party rule unravels in one Warsaw Pact country
after another under the pressure of popular unrest. He showed no
sign Monday of changing course.
   He urged the 3.8 million party members _ about 15 percent of
Romania's population _ to maintain the principles of ``scientific
socialism,'' instituted in 1965, the year he took over.
   Delegates, in a clearly rehearsed show of affection, rose
frequently to clap and chant ``Romania-Communism'' and
``Ceausescu-Heroism.''
   They were silenced after about 30 seconds by a peremptory wave
from Ceausescu, who peered out from a huge dais decorated with the
Communist hammer and sickle.
   Organizers said 115 delegations from 82 countries were expected
but all NATO countries except Turkey stayed away. Reform-minded
Communist or Socialist parties from Hungary, Italy and Finland also
refused to attend in protest over the country's poor human rights
record.
   ``Attendance of any of the parties' activities would be
inconsistent with the depth of U.S. concerns over the human rights
situation in Romania, for which the Romanian Communist Party bears
responsibility,'' the U.S. Embassy said in a statement.
   Canadian Ambassador Sol Gray said in an interview that heads of
diplomatic missions from NATO countries had attended the last
congress in 1984, but ``the human rights record was such that it
was inappropriate to attend this affair.''
   Romania has been a regular target of Western human rights
organizations as well as international conferences for its
suppression of dissent and restrictions on religious freedom.
   Under Romanian law, all meetings with foreigners must be
reported and all typewriters must be registered to permit the
tracing of letters and leaflets.
   The domestic media have not reported the gradual collapse of the
Berlin Wall _ an indication of the tight lid on information.
   Gray said the situation in Romania had not necessarily worsened
in recent years but ``it's a comparative thing with the rest of the
Soviet bloc where democratic change has affected most other
countries.''
   ``They've been very consistent, it's the rest of the world
that's changing,'' Gray said.
   The strict limits on free speech and other violations of human
rights have added to the despair in a country with chronic
shortages of food and other necessities.
   The government justified its policy of exporting much of
domestic production by saying Romania needed to pay off its foreign
debt. Ceausescu said last spring that the country had paid its
debts, but store shelves remain bare and apartments without heat.
   Margarine, eggs, meat and other staples are rationed. Although
residents said stores had been stocked in Bucharest to impress
foreigners attending the congress, shoppers today were still
presenting ration books for poor cuts of deep-frozen meat at a
packed butcher's store near Palace Hall.
   Ceausescu has encouraged the creation of a personality cult
unmatched anywhere in the Soviet bloc.
   Delegates leapt to their feet every few minutes today during the
speech. They clapped rhythmically and chanted slogans such as
``Ceausescu and the People,'' or ``Ceausescu-the Romanian Communist
Party.''
   Ceausescu's wife Elena and their son Nicu, who are ranking party
officials along with several of their relatives, gazed impassively
from the stage.
   The main entrance was draped with a banner proclaiming ``Long
Live the Romanian Communist Party headed by its Secretary-General,
Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu.''
   Security was high, with rifle-toting soldiers and police in blue
greatcoats cordoning off the congress center and standing along
nearby streets. The government severely restricted travel to and
from Romania and turned back several foreign correspondents
planning to cover the meeting.
   The delegates to the congress can theoretically vote to replace
Ceausescu and his allies in the 41-member Executive Political
Committee and the 431-member Central Committee _ the party's senior
bodies.
   They also are empowered to reject a five-year plan endorsed by
Ceausescu that emphasizes central control of the economy. The plan
is in sharp contrast to the efforts by other Soviet bloc nations to
introduce more of a free market.
   But any divergence from Ceausescu's line is highly unlikely,
since the 40 counties sending representatives to the congress
overwhelmingly voted for Ceausescu proteges.

<TEXT>
   About 5,000 guerrillas today
launched major attacks in the northwest to consolidate gains made
over the past two months, guerrilla and other sources said.
   Beginning early today, hundreds of artillery shells could be
heard falling inside Cambodia. The shelling, which continued into
midday, shook houses in the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet.
   Thai military and guerrilla sources said the shelling came from
government positions in response to the guerrilla attacks.
   The guerrillas' main objectives were the town of Svay Chek and
government-held positions around the village of Nimit, said a
senior official of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front in
Aranyaprathet. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Western and Thai military observers on the border confirmed that
a major attack had begun.
   At the Liberation Front's base of Boueng Trakuan, about two
miles inside Cambodia, guerrillas showed off large quantities of
captured weapons, including four 122mm artillery pieces, mortars,
heavy machine guns, assault rifles and ammunition.
   Soviet-built trucks captured from government forces were seen
carrying weapons to forward guerrilla positions at Svay Chek about
12 miles to the southeast.
   More than 1,000 guerrillas attacked Svay Chek, which was
defended by about 600 government troops, said the guerrilla source
in Aranyaprathet.
   The Liberation Front coordinated the attacks with the
non-Communist guerrilla group loyal to opposition leader Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, the source said. The Sihanoukists attacked
government positions at Kok Mon close to the town of Banteay Chamar
in the far northwest, he said.
   The guerrillas failed to take Svay Chek during their biggest
offensive in 11 years beginning in late September. They did,
however, seize the towns of Banteay Chamar, Thmar Puok and Kandoul
as well as many villages and other military positions.
   Thai military sources, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
said today's attacks were intended to secure those gains in advance
of an anticipated government counteroffensive.
   Large concentrations of Communist Khmer Rouge fighters also
operate in northwestern Cambodia. However, it was unclear how much
of a role they played in the latest attacks.
   The Khmer Rouge is the most powerful group in a three-party
coalition fighting the government in Phnom Penh.
   The Communist group took over Cambodia in April 1975 and killed
or starved hundreds of thousands of people before it was ousted by
a Vietnamese invasion 11 years ago. The Vietnamese installed the
current Cambodian government.
   Vietnam said it withdrew the last of its combat troops in late
September.

<TEXT>
   South Africa's last 1,500 troops in
this territory are withdrawing as part of its transition to
independence, but many are going to a disputed South African
enclave along the coast.
   The area, Walvis Bay, is more than 400 miles from South Africa's
northern border. It is the only deep-water port along Namibia's
coastline.
   The South African soldiers began departing Friday and are to
complete their withdrawal by this Friday. They are leaving military
bases in the northern towns of Grootfontein and Oshivelo.
   The Grootfontein contingent is headed for the South African city
of Upington, and the Oshivelo mechanized division will be based in
Walvis Bay.
   The South-West Africa People's Organization, which won 57
percent of the vote in the territory's independence elections
earlier this month, says it considers Walvis Bay part of Namibia.
   The elected Constituent Assembly will hold its first meeting
Tuesday and begin work on a constitution paving the way for
independence. South Africa has controlled the territory for 74
years.
   South Africa has army, navy and air force bases in Walvis Bay, a
480-square mile patch of land bordered by Namibia on three sides
and the Atlantic Ocean.
   The South Africans claim Walvis Bay under a 19th century
agreement with Britain that made the port separate from the German
colony of South-West Africa that South Africa seized at the end of
World War I.
   South Africa said it will negotiate with Namibia's independence
government over Namibian use of the port.
   Walvis Bay has a population of 26,000, including 9,000 whites.

<HEAD>Record Number of Barges Backed Up at Mississippi River Town</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barges were backed up for more than 40 miles
today waiting to pass through a lock at this Mississippi River
town. Workers said the 1,000-barge backup was a record.
   The congestion began when workers shut down Alton's Lock and Dam
26 on Wednesday and Thursday to repair a worn gate, said Ken
Kruchowski, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
   The lock has since reopened, but the backup has still become
particularly bad because river traffic is heavy this time of year
as barges carry grain shipments to New Orleans for export,
officials said.
   ``We've got 113 tows waiting to lock and 1,000 barges down
here,'' said Jim Perry, shift leader at the Alton lock. ``For every
one or two we send we get two or three coming in.''
   Although the new gate was in place by Friday, boats that arrived
Wednesday evening didn't make it through the lock until late
Sunday, Perry said.
   Traffic was proceeding through the lock at the normal rate of
about 1{ hours for a typical load of 15 barges and one towboat,
Perry said. ``We're getting them through here pretty good. We're
back to normal operation. The only abnormal thing is we've got a
hell of a lot of boats.''
   Barges arriving this morning will probably wait six days to pass
through the lock, said Billie Sanna, a Corps of Engineers worker at
Alton.
   Both Perry and Sanna said the jam was a record. As many as 70
towboats pushing 800 barges have been backed up at Alton
previously, Sanna said.
   The wait is eating into barge companies' profits, said Tommy
Seals, marine superintendent and port captain for American
Commercial Barge Lines in St. Louis.
   The delay is especially costly for smaller barge lines, which
may have their entire 40- to 50-barge shipment waiting to go
through the lock, Seals said. He would not estimate how much his
company would lose.
   ``We're all being hurt,'' he said.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six works by turn-of-the-century western artist
Frederic Remington that had been languishing in an attic for
decades were snapped up at auction for more than $1.2 million.
   The centerpiece of Sunday's auction at the DuMouchelle Art
Gallery was Remington's No. 2 bronze casting of ``Cheyenne'' _ a
horse and rider piece that was expected to sell for $100,000 to
$200,000. New York art collector Charles Wood paid $605,000.
   The works originally were bought by Michigan industrialist
William Mountain, a collector of American art. When he died in
1936, his artworks were divided between two daughters. Two
generations passed before the Remington pieces were discovered in
an attic in Lansing this fall.
   The $1.2 million price tag includes the gallery's 10 percent
commission. The other pieces sold were paintings titled ``$5000
Reward, Dead or Alive!'' for $165,000, ``Down Go Horses and Men''
for $275,000, and an untitled oil on canvas for $105,000; a sketch
of an Indian for $45,000; and a sketch of a rider on horseback for
$40,000.
   Remington died in 1909.

   A methane gas explosion today
rocked a mine where 92 miners lost their lives in a fire, injuring
one person, the Tanjug news agency reported.
   The fire at the Aleksinacki Rudnici coal mine in eastern
Yugoslavia broke out Friday, trapping the 92 miners in a 700-yard
deep shaft. Officials say there is no chance any survived due to
the buildup of toxic fumes.
   Rescuers were still trying to reach the bodies of the miners
today when the explosion occurred at the mine 125 miles south of
Belgrade, in the republic of Serbia.
   Four people working on the mine's conveyor equipment, where the
fire started Friday, have been arrested, officials reported.
   Friday's accident was Seria's worst mine disaster. A rescue
coordinator said the mine was ``the most inflammable in Yugoslavia
due to high concentrations of methane gas.''
   Five years ago experts recommended the mine be closed down after
a string of fatal accidents culminated in the death of 38 miners in
June 1983. In 1965, 128 people died in a coal mine expolsion in the
central region of Bosnia.

   Socialist Luis Inacio da Silva's lead
widened today in returns that set him up for an ideologically
heated runoff for the presidency with the conservative front-runner.
   With 99.3 percent of the ballots counted, da Silva, of the
radical left Workers Party, had locked up second place with 16.1
percent of the vote. He had a 400,000-vote lead over the
third-place candidate, Leonel Brizola of the center-left Democratic
Labor Party.
   Fernando Collor de Mello, of the rightist National
Reconstruction Party, won the most votes in Wednesday's elections,
gaining 28 percent. Strongly backed by businessmen and the rural
oligarchs that dominate the countryside, he ha a wide margin from
the beginning.
   Brizola had 15.5 percent of the vote in this country of 150
million people. There are 82 million registered voters.
   Jose Francisco Rezek, president of the Superior Electoral Court,
said the remaining votes would not change the outcome because they
are from da Silva strongholds.
   The rest of the vote in Brazil's first direct presidential
elections since 1960 was split among several other candidates.
   With no one receiving a majority, Collor de Mello and da Silva
will meet in a Dec. 17 runoff. The winner takes office in March for
a five-year term.
   Brizola called a news conference Sunday to announce he was not
ready to concede defeat. He said he might ask the Electoral Court
to recheck vote tallies in some regions.
   Referring to possible support for da Silva's candidacy, he said,
``The Workers Party will have to facilitate any accord with the
Democratic Labor Party. They'll have to consider some of our policy
proposals.''
   He did not elaborate.
   Da Silva, a former union leader and now a congressman, ran well
in urban industrial regions. He also surprised many observers by
picking up strong support among poor rural peasants in the north
and northeast, who traditionally vote under the guidance of
conservative landowners.
   Da Silva didn't talk to reporters Sunday, but party leaders held
a news conference in Sao Paulo.
   Party president Luis Gushiken, a federal representative, said
the runoff would be ``polarized between right and left.''
   ``Collor de Mello represents the right-wing elite and is closely
linked to bankers, large landholders and big businessman. Da Silva
represents the people,'' he said.
   The two candidates have sharp differences over key policy
questions.
   Da Silva, known by his nickname of ``Lula,'' has called for an
immediate moratorium of interst payments on the country's $110
billion foreign debt, the Third World's largest. He also proposes a
large-scale agrarian reform program and a huge transfer of wealth
from rich to poor.
   Collor de Mello has been vague on policy, with a platform based
largely on combating Brazil's corrupt state bureaucracy.
   On Sunday, Collor de Mello told reporters da Silva's policy
proposals were so extreme it would ``be impossible for the Workers
Party to broaden their base of support.''
   The runoff will choose a successor to President Jose Sarney, who
by law could not run for re-election. Sarney is a civilian, but he
gained office in 1985 through an electoral college vote coordinated
by the military.

   Former leader Deng Xiaoping said he retired
because he might say crazy things as he ages, a pro-Beijing
newspaper reported today.
   In speech to senior officials, Deng said his retirement was
designed to end the practice of lifetime tenure among top officials.
   ``My last function is to take the lead to abolish lifetime
employment,'' the Chinese-language Wen Wei Po paraphrased Deng as
saying.
   ``When a man grows old, he tends to become stubborn and lose
energy, this cannot be changed by subjective will. I am old now, my
brain still works but I may say crazy things in the future.''
   The speech was made Sept. 4, two months before Deng, 85,
officially resigned from his last Communist Party post, chairman of
the Central Military Commission. He was replaced by his handpicked
heir, party chief Jiang Zemin.
   Deng, the party patriarch, is still believed to be the key force
in Chinese politics because of his prestige and connections.
   Deng also was quoted as saying many foreigners have urged him to
write his memoirs but he does not think it is necessary.

   President Hosni Mubarak today for the first
time publicly advised the Palestine Liberation Organization to
accept a U.S. plan for an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.
   Mubarak told reporters he had not yet received the PLO's reply
to the plan, set forth last month by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III.
   ``President Mubarak expressed his hope that the reply will not
be negative,'' the Middle East News Agency said, without giving the
president's exact words.
   ``We do not put pressure on anyone, but we must help to push the
process forward,'' Mubarak was quoted as saying.
   The comments marked a change in Egypt's stance. Previously,
Mubarak had said Egypt consults regularly with the PLO on peace
moves and ``adopts'' whatever decisions the group makes.
   Baker proposed the dialogue between Israel and a Palestinian
delegation to prepare the ground for Israeli-proposed elections in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The plan elaborates on
Israel's own election plan.
   The elections would choose Palestinian delegates for talks with
Israel on interim autonomy in the two territories. Negotiations on
a final settlement would be held later.
   Israel has told the United States it would accept the Baker
proposal if the Americans provided some assurances _ mainly, that
the PLO would be excluded from negotiations.
   The PLO recently requested clarifications of the Baker plan and
got a reply through Egypt. PLO leaders were reported meeting in the
Tunisian capital last week to formulate a final answer to the
proposal.
   Mubarak denied reports today that the PLO had already sent its
reply to Cairo for relay to Washington.
   But a PLO emissary arrived this afternoon from the Tunisian
capital, and the Middle East News Agency said his mission was to
convey the Palestinian position.
   It quoted Palestinian sources in Tunis as saying the PLO is
holding to its insistence that it alone choose delegates to the
dialogue, and that the dialogue's agenda be open and unconditional.
Both demands run counter to the Israeli position.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who announced the
election proposal last May, has insisted there is no possibility of
Israel's relinquishing the West Bank and Gaza in any settlement. He
considers the territories part of the land of Israel.
   Mubarak noted today that the United States opposes Israel's
retaining the territories it has occupied since the 1967 Middle
East war.
   ``Shamir can say what he wants,'' Mubarak said. ``The United
States has said and is saying (it supports trading)
land-for-peace.''

<HEAD>Politicians: Mrs. Aquino Loser, Rebels Winner in Autonomy Vote</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto MLA1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Partial returns showed most
southern voters rejecting a regional autonomy plan, and some
politicians said today the results would boost Moslem rebels
demanding an independent Islamic state.
   President Corazon Aquino proposed the plan to satisfy demands
for self-rule by 4 million Filipino Moslems and to end their nearly
20-year secessionist rebellion. However, she never openly
campaigned for the autonomy proposal.
   Moslem rebels and many Christian leaders opposed the plan,
saying it was inadequate. Critics feared an autonomous government
would not be economically viable if it were limited to impoverished
and geographically separated regions.
   Unofficial, partial returns from Sunday's referendum showed
voters in only three of 13 participating provinces and nine cities
wanted to join the autonomous government.
   The Supreme Court has ruled that any province or city where a
majority of the voters approve the plan will join the regional
government.
   ``The people of the proposed autonomous region ... have
spoken,'' Mrs. Aquino told reporters in Manila. ``It is now the
duty of government to carry out what the peole have decided.''
   Complete returns were not expected before Friday. But election
commissioner Haydee Yorac said ``yes'' votes were leading in only
the largely Moslem provinces of Tawi-Tawi, Sulu and Lanao del Sur.
   In predominately Christian areas, voters were rejecting the plan
by margins of up to 30-to-1, according to the returns. In eight of
the nine cities, about 80 percent of the voters rejected autonomy.
   Moslems form the majority in only five of the 13 provinces.
   Some politicians said the rejection by a majority of the voters
would strengthen the position of Moslem rebel Moro National
Liberation Front.
   Zamboanga Mayor Vitalyano Agan, who supported autonomy, said the
outcome was a personal victory for Nur Misuari, exiled chieftain of
the 24,000-member rebel group.
   ``In my assessment, this rejection is a promotion of Misuari as
the people's leader, indirectly, and a rejection of Mrs. Aquino,''
he said. ``We expect more problems in the future because the moral
side of the (Front) will be strengthened.''
   Misuari, who lives in Saudi Arabia, vowed to escalate the nearly
20-year Moslem insurgency regardless of the outcome of the vote.
   Southern Christian politicians and some Roman Catholic Church
leaders also rejected the proposal.
   Despite the Front's opposition, there were no reports of serious
violence. Moslem insurgents raided 10 villages in Maguindanao
province, but no deaths were reported.
   Mrs. Aquino forged a cease-fire with the Moslem rebels in 1986.
Peace talks collapsed in May 1987, but the cease-fire generally has
held. At least 50,000 people have been killed in the insurgency.

<HEAD>China Attacks U.S. Sanction Bill, Hints at Restrictions in Hong Kong</HEAD>

   Beijing kept up its attacks on the United States
today, accusing Congress of a ``disgusting performance of power
politics'' in approving economic sanctions against China.
   In another development, an official was quoted as saying China
is considering measures to restrict political activity in Hong Kong
after the territory reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
   China said the U.S. bill, drawn up to protest China's bloody
quelling of the pro-democracy movement last spring, ``maliciously
vilifies and attacks the Chinese government.''
   The bill has been sent to President Bush, who could veto it. It
calls for two years of trade sanctions including a freeze on
exports of satellites, helicopters and certain nuclear material,
and a halt to risk insurance for American firms in China.
   The latest attack came from the National People's Congress,
China's largely ceremonial legislature.
   ``We hereby express our strong condemnation and lodge a strong
protest against this hegemonic behavior of the U.S. Congress which
grossly interferes in China's internal affairs, willfully trampling
on the basic norms governing international relations,'' the
statement said.
   ``Such a disgusting performance of power politics only serves to
reveal its own arrogance and prejudice, and help people see clearly
the stubborn position of hostility to China and its people on the
part of certain forces in the U.S. Congress,'' said the statement,
read on state-run television and carried by the official Xinhua
News Agency.
   The call for sanctions comes in the wake of the Chinese army's
bloody crackdown in early June against unarmed protesters seeking
democratic reforms.
   The bill says the ``unprovoked, brutal and indiscriminate
assault'' left 700 dead. China has said some 300 people died, but
western intelligence estimates put the number as high as 3,000.
   The Chinese government maintains the demonstrations were aimed
at overthrowing the Communist leadership.
   In Hong Kong, Li Hou, a top Chinese official in Hong Kong
affairs, was quoted as saying China is considering prohibiting
contacts with overseas political groups and limiting or banning
foreign nationals from the territory's legislature.
   Li, speaking to reporters in the Chinese city of Canton, said
the measures were being considered as part of Hong Kong's
post-colonial constitution to prevent attempts to
``internationalize'' the territory.
   China is ``worried that Hong Kong will become a base for
subversive activities against the Chinese central government and
the socialist systems on the mainland,'' Li was quoted as saying by
the English-language South China Morning Post.

<HEAD>Japan Reportedly Plans $180 Million in Aid for Poland, Hungary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese government will provide about $180
million in aid to Poland and Hungary, a newspaper said today.
   The aid will be announced at an international meeting on the
subject to be held in Brussels Friday, the mass-circulation
Mainichi Shimbun reported.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified government sources, said
Japan's aid to Poland is part of a Western support package totaling
$1 billion.
   A Foreign Ministry official confirmed Japan would provide aid to
the two countries but said the government has not yet decided how
much to provide.
   Mainichi Shimbun said Japan would provide about $100 million in
a low-interest loan to Poland, to be used as a fund to help
stabilize the country's battered economy and combat inflation. It
also will grant about $40 million in a emergency food aid, the
paper said.
   Another $40 million will finance projects in both Poland and
Hungary to promote a market economy and improve the environment in
both countries, it said.
   Poland has asked Western countries to support its efforts to
control the country's inflation, running at an annual rate of 800
percent, and to stabilize its currency following a price reform
program begun in August.
   Until recently, Japan has said Eastern European countries, with
the exception of Yugoslavia, did not meet its economic criteria for
foreign aid.
   In May, Japan loaned about $60 million to Hungary _ its first
loan to an Eastern European country _ through the government-backed
Export-Import Bank, though this was not incorporated in the
government's aid budget.

   Two powerful earthquakes struck the southwestern
province of Sichuan today, killing three people, injuring five and
destroying several homes.
   The quakes measured 5.2 and 5.4 on the Richter scale of ground
motion, said the official Xinhua News Agency. The worst-hit area
was in Jiangbei County near Chongqing in eastern Sichuan.
   Local seismologists had predicted a strong quake for the coming
year and the area was rocked by several weaker quakes in September,
the report said.
   Sichuan is one of China's most quake-prone regions. Fifty-four
were injured and more than 4,000 homes destroyed in a central
Sichuan quake in September, and a series of five quakes measuring
up to 6.7 on the Richter scale killed 11 in western Sichuan in June
and July.
   A series of heavy temblors registering up to 6.1 on the Richter
scale rocked northern China's Shanxi province in October, killing
29 and leaving some 50,000 homeless.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. A quake measuring 6.0 can cause severe damage in a
populated area.

   Lech Walesa wound up his whirlwind U.S.
tour today after stops in the birthplace of American independence
and at the home of an heiress who has pledged millions to help save
the site where Solidarity was born.
   The Nobel Peace Prize laureate also made a visit to St. Hedwig's
Roman Catholic Church in Trenton, where he laid a wreath Sunday
night at a shrine for the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, the activist
priest slain five years ago by Polish secret police.
   Walesa left Teterboro Airport this morning for Caracas,
Venezuela, aboard a private jet.
   At Teterboro, Walesa said he was happy with his weeklong visit
and optimistic that President Bush and Congress would work to help
Poland, and he emphasized that he was not just looking for a
handout.
   ``I came to gain expertise and advice from captains of industry
in this country,'' he said. ``(But) money is an issue.''
   The Solidarity leader's message of hope was cheered at every
stop on his tour. The reception was particularly enthusiastic at
St. Hedwig's, the center of Trenton's Polish community.
   Admirers stood on pews to see him. Many shed tears as they sang
the Polish national anthem.
   ``The whole world is looking at the United States as the leading
force in the contemporary world,'' Walesa said.
   ``I am an example of the small person who can do great things,''
he said. ``I am proof of the adage that faith can move mountains. I
believe in freedom and liberty and in democracy and I didn't have
an army.''
   Before visiting the church, Walesa was a guest at a private
dinner at Jasna Polana, the Princeton estate of Barbara Piasecka
Johnson. The Polish-born Mrs. Johnson, 52, inherited much of the
Johnson &amp; Johnson pharmaceutical fortune after the death of her
husband, Seward Johnson.
   In June, she announced that she would spend up to $100 million
for a 55 percent interest in the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, where
the Solidarity movement was first kindled by Walesa in 1980. The
shipyard employs more than 10,000 workers, but Poland's communist
government had planned on shutting it down because it was
unprofitable.
   Mrs. Johnson, who came to the United States in 1968, has been
hailed as a hero in Poland.
   Earlier Sunday, Walesa paused from his tour to pray at the
National Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa in the Philadelphia
suburb of Doylestown. An estimated 10,000 people joined him at the
shrine, which is modeled after an icon of the Virgin Mary in the
Polish town of Czestochowa, shouting ``Welcome!'' in Polish.
   In Philadelphia, Walesa drew cheers when he held aloft the
city's Freedom Award, which martial law had prevented him from
getting in 1981, and declared, ``We are free now.''
   He also touched the Liberty Bell and attended a private
reception in Independence Hall.
   Walesa flew into Philadelphia from Chicago on Saturday night.
Chicago, said to have the largest number of people of Polish
descent of any city except Warsaw, gave Walesa a rousing welcome
despite freezing temperatures.
   ``It's probably one of the most emotional moments of my life,''
said Frances Alongi, who saw him in Chicago. Her parents and
grandparents were born in Poland.
   ``I just sort of feel like if they were here today to see
this,'' she said, choking back tears.
   Walesa arrived in Washington on Nov. 13. His visit included a
meeting with President Bush, an address to a joint session of
Congress and numerous meetings with business and industry leaders.
One of his goals was to find investors in the troubled economy of
Poland, whose government is now lead by a Solidarity activist.
   He succeeded in a breakfast stop in Philadelphia sponsored by
The Copernicus Society, a Polish-American philanthropic group. The
group pledged a $400,000 fund to support young Polish writers.
Author James Michener, who lives in the Philadelphia suburb of New
Hope and has written the novel called ``Poland,'' made the
announcement.
   ``I cannot tell you how excited someone like me is ... to see
the collapse of a false idea that could rule the people but not
feed them,'' Michener said. ``That is a revolution of a magnitude
that staggers me.''

   A prime suspect in the slaying of Costabile
``Gus'' Farace, the alleged killer of a federal drug agent, is a
reputed mobster whom the agent had been investigating, published
reports said.
   Police sources said the reputed mobster, Gerald Chilli, 55, had
been overheard to say he would like to kill Farace, New York
Newsday and the Daily News said in today's editions.
   ``Chilli had been mouthing off that if he got ahold of Farace he
would kill him himself,'' the News quoted a police source as saying.
   The FBI has said Farace's slaying probably was ordered by
high-ranked mobsters angry about the scrutiny that the agent's
murder brought them.
   Farace, 29, was shot Friday night as he sat in the front
passenger seat of a car in Brooklyn. He had been the object of a
nationwide manhunt led by about 100 federal agents investigating
the death Feb. 28 of Drug Enforcement Administration agent Everett
Hatcher.
   At the time of his death, Hatcher was trying to infiltrate a
cocaine ring run by the mob and had made cocaine buys from Farace
in an effort to develop a cocaine conspiracy case against Chilli,
Newsday said.
   Chilli and Farace had served prison terms at the same time at
Staten Island's Arthur Kill Correctional Facility, and Chilli
helped foster Farace's mob career, the newspaper said.
   Authorities were hoping a friend of Farace's who was with him
when he was slain, Joseph Sclafani, would provide information to
police. Sclafani was also shot by Farace's killer, but survived and
was in critical condition Sunday at Coney Island Hospital.
   Farace may have been lured to the shooting site thinking he
would be handed letters from his family, according to the News.
Sources said Chilli was the most likely person to have lured him,
Newsday said.
   On Farace's body, authorities found letters from his wife and
mother and photos of his infant son, whom he never had seen, the
New York Post said in today's editions.
   The letters urged him to keep running from authorities.

   Johnny Haymer, who played Sgt. Zale on the
comedy-drama ``M-A-S-H,'' has died of cancer. He was 69.
   The actor, whose career spanned more than 40 years, died
Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, a family spokesman said.
   Sgt. Zale was a character in the long-running show for only
about two seasons, 1977-79, according to the reference book ``Total

would get into arguments with Cpl. Klinger.
   The St. Louis native also played Pinkerton on the television
comedy show ``Madame's Place.'' Haymer appeared in more than 100
commercials and won a Clio award for work on a cereal advertisement.
   Haymer played nightclubs and did theater before working in
films. The actor had roles in ``Annie Hall,'' ``And Justice For
All,'' ``Real Life'' and ``Logan's Run.''
   He is survived by his wife, Helyn; daughter, Susan; two sons,
James and Robert; a brother; and two grandchildren.
   Services were scheduled for Tuesday.

<HEAD>President to Address Nation on Summit, East Bloc Changes</HEAD>

   President Bush will make a nationally
broadcast address Wednesday evening on events in Eastern Europe and
next month's summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, it
was announced today.
   The speech, at 9 p.m. EST, will be broadcast from the
presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland's Catoctin
Mountains, where Bush will be spending the Thanksgiving holidays.
   It will be only the second time in his presidency that Bush has
made a prime-time, televised address. The first was Sept. 5 when he
announced details of an anti-drug program.
   The White House also confirmed that the president will stop in
Brussels, Belgium, after the superpower summit to brief the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization allies on the talks.
   Bush and Gorbachev are to meet Dec. 2 and 3 on U.S. and Soviet
warships in the Mediterranean off the coast of Malta. The opening
of the Berlin Wall and the spread of democratic reforms in Eastern
Europe are expected to dominate the meeting.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, announcing Bush's
speech, said, ``He will be talking about the summit, events in
Eastern Europe, but mostly about Thanksgiving.''
   On another subject, Fitzwater said the White House is
considering Cartagena, Colombia, as the site for a multi-nation
summit on the drug problem.
   He said advance teams have been sent to Colombia to consider it
as a possible location, but that no agreement has been reached with
the other countries that would attend.
   Colombia has been wracked by drug-related violence, and the
government there is under siege from cocaine barons who are trying
to force an end to a crackdown against drugs.
   Asked why Bush would go there, given the security problems,
Fitzwater said, ``These are the countries involved in the drug war.
It makes sense to go there.''
   Fitzwater commented in response to a report in today's editions
of The Washington Times that Bush had approved Colombia as the
summit site despite the security concerns.

<TEXT>
   Army troops raided the city's
Episcopal Church today as fighting in the fiercest rebel offensive
of the 10-year-old civil war dwindled to scattered combat.
   The country's Roman Catholic leader predicted a backlash of
``revenge, repression and witch-hunting,'' and was himself
threatened with assassination.
   National Guard troops raided the Episcopal church just after
dawn and arrested several foreigners, said a guard officer who
refused to give his name. A church worker said nine people,
including an American and Spanish, French and West German citizens,
were picked up. He did not elaborate.
   The church, in one of the most affluent neighborhoods of the
capital, is harboring about 200 refugees from the combat.
   Churches, especially those that work with the poor, have always
been suspect in the eyes of Salvadoran rightists. Authorities
believe they harbor or aid guerrillas.
   Troops from the elite Belloso battalion today fought guerrillas
in the working-class neighborhood of Soyapango on the east side of
the capital. But guerrillas had pulled out of most of the territory
they seized during the offensive that began Nov. 11, and returned
to mountain strongholds.
   There also were reports of scattered combat in the provinces.
Telephones were out in San Miguel, a city 86 miles east of the
capital where there was heavy combat Sunday night.
   On Sunday, army patrols moved through streets strewn with the
rubble of fighting. On some vehicles, several burned bodies could
be seen.
   People began returning to their homes, or what was left of them,
but thousands remained in shelters. The warfare had forced about
40,000 of the capital's 1 million people to evacuate homes in
now-ravaged neighborhoods.
   About 800 mourners attended the funeral of six Jesuit priests,
their cook and her teen-age daughter, who were slain and mutilated
early Thursday in an attack widely blamed on right-wing death
squads.
   The United States has pressed rightist President Alfredo
Cristiani for a full investigation. In Washington, Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., warned Sunday that U.S. aid could be curtailed if
Cristiani cannot stop such killings.
   But today President Bush said he disagreed with the idea of
cutting aid.
   ``There is a freely elected government doing their very best
trying to get protection from these Marxist-led guerrillas,'' Bush
said in Washington. ``This is not the time to pull away from
President Christiani.''
   The rebels said they launched the offensive in response to a
resurgence of death squad activity and many people think Cristiani
has lost control over the military and extremists in his party, the
Republican Nationalist Alliance.
   Many opposition politicians, labor leaders, religious and human
rights activists are now in hiding or have left the country because
of threats or arrests followed by deportation orders.
   Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas, the Catholic leader, warned in
his homily Sunday that ``a dreadful wave of revenge, repression and
witch hunting may follow'' the guerrilla withdrawal.
   Rivera Damas said before Sunday's funeral that ``there exists
the vehement presumption'' that the six Jesuits were killed by
``members of the armed forces or people in intimate connivance with
them.''
   The archbishop, whose predecessor Oscar Romero was slain in 1980
by a right-wing death squad, has been urged to leave the country by
Attorney General Mauricio Colorado.
   Colorado told a news conference Sunday that the unnamed ``church
dignitaries'' he asked Pope John Paul II to withdraw were Rivera
Damas and Auxiliary Bishop Gregorio Rosa Chavez, whom he accused of
fomenting leftist violence.
   He claimed he had information that both have been targeted for
assassination.
   In attendance at Sunday's funeral were U.S. Ambassador William
Walker and Cristiani, who is struggling to maintain the appearance
of control.
   The political polarization has raised questions about the
success of a U.S. policy that made this nation of 5.2 million the
biggest recipient of Washington's aid in the hemisphere.
   Despite the billions, human rights abuses are again on the rise
and a rebel force of 7,000 regulars and perhaps twice as many
irregulars was able to bring the decade-old war to the capital for
the first time.
   They took about a third of the capital in the first assault and
held onto extensive areas for most of a week, also engaging in
heavy combat in the provinces. On Sunday evening, there were still
isolated pockets of fighting in the capital.
   The military said nearly 1,000 soldiers and guerrillas were
killed and more than 1,150 wounded in the nationwide rebel
offensive. About 71,000 people have died overall in the war, most
of them civilians.
   Radio Venceremos, the rebels' clandestine radio station, claimed
827 soldiers were killed or wounded but gave no breakdown.
   Neither side gave an estimate of casualties among civilians, who
suffered heavily in the block-by-block fighting. The Red Cross said
an estimate was difficult because many bodies are still in the
streets.

<HEAD>Bush Says Aid Cutoff to El Salvador Would Be Unacceptable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, declaring he cannot abandon
``a fragile democracy,'' said today that any congressional aid
cutoff to El Salvador would be an unacceptable response to the
murders of six Roman Catholic priests.
   Bush, speaking to reporters at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., as
he left for Chicago, also said he had spoken with Salvadoran
President Alfredo Cristiani over the weekend and ``offered him
technical help in investigating and bringing to justice the people
who did the killing.''
   Bush's comments came as Congress was considering a $14.6 billion
foreign aid bill that includes money for El Salvador. The U.S.
government pumps about $1.5 million a day in economic and military
aid into the small Central American nation, which has been fighting
a leftist insurgency since 1979.
   House Democratic leaders overrode the objections of some
Republicans and cleared the way Sunday night for Rep. George
Miller, D-Calif., to offer an amendment restricting aid to
Cristiani's 5-month-old government.
   The move is in reaction to the killing last week of six Jesuit
priests, which many take as a sign that El Salvador's right-wing
``death squads'' have renewed their activities. Conservatives,
however, want to increase aid to El Salvador to help the government
combat a new offensive by leftist rebels.
   ``We strongly condemn the killing ... and it must stop,'' Bush
said.
   ``This concept of the Congress, of some members, ... on cutting
off aid to El Salvador is absolutely unacceptable to me as
president,'' he said.
   Bush said Cristiani assured him the government was not involved
in the murders.
   ``I believe it,'' the president said. ``And if some renegade
forces were involved, they should be brought to justice. But
absolutely Cristiani would not lie to me on a matter of this
nature.''
   In the past, Congress has restricted aid to El Salvador because
of human rights abuses. Cristiani's ARENA political party has been
linked to death squad acivity in the early 1980s.
   ``This is not the time to undermine a fragile democracy that is
under attack where we've seen the most brutal use of a civilian
population to further a political end on the part of the FMLN,''
Bush said, referring to the leftist insurgency by its Spanish
initials. ``It's totally unacceptable and the day of these Marxist
attacks should end right now.''

   Robert Mays sat quietly after hearing
proof that he and his wife left a hospital 10 years ago with
someone else's baby, leaving behind their real daughter, who later
died from a heart defect.
   Moments after receiving the news, he asked where his biological
daughter was buried, according to his attorney.
   ``I think it depressed him he had a child he never met that
died,'' said Mays' lawyer Arthur Ginsburg after genetic test
results made public Sunday proved Kimberly Michelle Mays is the
daughter of another couple.
   The 10-year-old girl has been the focus of a custody battle
between Mays _ a Sarasota roofing contractor whose wife, Barbara,
died in 1981 _ and Ernest and Regina Twigg, who claim they lost
their newborn in a baby swap at a rural central Florida hospital in
December 1978.
   John Blakely, the Twiggs' attorney, said the tests give a 99.9
percent certainty that Kimberly is the Twiggs' daughter and a 98
percent chance that the girl who died last year of a congenital
heart defect, Arlena, was Mays'. The tests left no doubt about
parentage, lawyers for both sides said.
   Arlena, raised by the Twiggs as one of their own, was buried in
Pennsylvania. Just before her death in August 1988, the Twiggs
learned through genetic testing that she wasn't related to them.
   In the search for their biological daughter, they discovered
that Kimberly and Arlena were born three days apart at Hardee
Memorial Hospital in Wauchula.
   During a subsequent court battle, Mays resisted the Twiggs'
efforts to subject Kimberly to genetic testing. The impasse was
broken last month, when the Twiggs promised not to seek custody
regardless of the outcome. But they kept the option to seek visits
with the hazel-eyed fifth-grader.
   ``After we consulted with some psychologists, we determined that
it would most likely be in Kimberly's best interest to stay with
Mr. Mays,'' Blakely said today in an appearance with the Twiggs on
``CBS This Morning.''
   ``We're trying to work it out so Kimberly can be a real winner
in this matter,'' he said. ``She can maintain her loving
relationship with the man who she has thought to be her father
while simultaneously she can get two new loving parents, additional
parents. She's been an only child up to now.''
   Mays, who was in seclusion Sunday, planned to take his only
daughter away to break the news privately and to reassure her that
she would never have to leave him, Ginsburg said.
   ``I think the thing he's going to emphasize is `just don't worry
about anything. ... I'm going to stay your daddy and we're going to
stay together for the rest of our lives,''' the attorney said.
   The Twiggs have sued Hardee officials in U.S. District Court in
Tampa, claiming employees switched their baby shortly after birth.
They also persuaded the FBI to investigate the hospital and its
employees, but the agency failed to find sufficient evidence that
federal law had been violated.
   Hospital administrator Harrell Connelly refused to comment on
the matter today. On Sunday officals referred questions to attorney
Janet Adams. Her office said she was unavailable for comment this
morning.
   Attorneys for both families believe a switch occurred at the
hospital, but said they don't know how.
   The Twiggs and their seven other children, ages 6 through 21,
attended a news conference with Blakely in Clearwater to announce
results of the tests by Johns Hopkins University. They talked about
the long ordeal and said they were overwhelmed and anxious to meet
Kimberly.
   Both sides will have psychologists talk with Kimberly and draw
up a visitation schedule to be approved by a Sarasota Circuit judge.
   Mrs. Twigg, a substitute elementary teacher, said when she meets
Kimberly she plans ``to take things very slow and chat with her
about what she likes to do.''
   Mrs. Twigg said she and her husband, a railroad ticket agent,
feel cheated. ``All of us have suffered enormously. There is anger
and outrage,'' she said.
   The Twiggs are still coping with their loss of Arlena and trying
to resolve the years they lost with Kimberly, she said.
   The Twiggs recently moved to the central Florida community of
Sebring from Langhorne, Pa., where they spent the last two years,
in part because of Arlena's health.
   They want to take Kimberly to Pennsylvania to meet grandparents,
and 15 aunts and uncles.
   ``I'm relieved we found out she is my sister,'' said Irisa
Plouse, the Twiggs' oldest daughter, who recently married. ``We've
been waiting a long time for this.''

   An American Airlines flight carrying 165 people
returned to Logan Airport for an emergency landing this morning
when smoke was detected in a rear cargo bin, airport officials said.
   Passengers and crew used emergency ramps to flee the aircraft
after it returned without incident about five minutes after takeoff
on a flight bound for Los Angeles, said spokesman Maynard
Scarborough of Massport, which operates the airport.
   Four people suffered minor injuries during the evacuation and
were taken to hospitals, said Scarborough. The 156 passengers
included four infants; nine crew members were also aboard, he said.
   The indication of smoke was detected just after the plane left
Logan, and it immediately returned, landing at 9:23 a.m.
   Mary O'Neill, a spokeswoman for the airline, said she didn't
know what might have gone wrong after the Airbus A-300 plane took
off. ``This is a very reliable aircraft ... and is less than two
years old,'' she said.

   Tammy Faye Bakker says although she is
afraid of flying she will take a plane to Minnesota to spend
Thanksgiving with her jailed husband.
   In a Sunday sermon to some 50 supporters, she also blasted a
weekly tabloid that said she would divorce Jim Bakker, the former
televangelist convicted last month of fraud.
   ``There's no truth whatsoever to it,'' she said, adding that
readers of such ``rag magazines'' are ``like dogs chasing garbage
trucks _ yuck!''
   Without providing details, Mrs. Bakker said a promising deal for
a new Orlando home for Jim and Tammy Ministries fell through last
week.
   ``Satan is trying to stop us from holding services in Florida,''
she said. She told supporters she continues to believe that ``God
has a place in Orlando for us somewhere.''
   The owner of the Shoppers World mall that houses the Bakkers'
storefront church has ordered them out by the end of the month,
saying he hasn't been paid.
   Bakker is serving a 45-year sentence in a federal prison in
Rochester, Minn., for defrauding followers of the former PTL Club
of $3.7 million.
   Mrs. Bakker said she is afraid of flying but will make the trip
Thursday because she is eager to see her husband. She sobbed as she
told how Bakker must make collect telephone calls, calling it
``very embarrassing for a man who paid all his bills for so many
people for so many years and gave, gave, gave.''

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is shackling itself to
1930s-era economic policies to fight overseas competition in the
advanced communications and computer marketplaces, a private study
says.
   The Economic Policy Institute said the United States stands to
lose 2 million jobs and suffer a $225 billion trade deficit by 2010
if the government fails to help American industry compete in
high-definition television, semiconductors, computers and digital
communications.
   The study released today, written by Robert B. Cohen and Kenneth
Donow, concludes that _ unlike Japan and the European Community _
the United States has failed to develop a system to achieve and
maintain competitiveness in leading-edge communications
technologies.
   ``U.S. policies currently emphasize customer and convenience
services to the near-exclusion of developing domestically produced
equipment and improving infrastructure,'' the report said.
``Without revising the antiquated policy framework that is a
product of the 1930s, the United States cannot meet the challenges
even now emerging.''
   The institute cited recent news reports that the Bush
administration has ``reversed or undermined Cabinet-level support
for aiding advanced imaging systems, semiconductors and other
high-technology industries.''
   The institute also cited reports that the Defense Department,
which has earmarked $30 million for research into advanced TV
display technology, now is considering buying such equipment from
Japan and withdrawing its support of U.S.-based HDTV-related work.
   The institute also said the administration, among other things,
was considering reduced funding for Sematech, the
government-industry consortium that is developing new semiconductor
process technologies.
   ``With these steps, the Bush administration will curtail the
main technology initiatives that have been supported by industry
and military leaders,'' the institute said. ``The result of taking
such steps could be a major deterioration in the U.S.'s ability to
compete in world markets.''
   Endorsing the study's findings, House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., said; ``Over the last several months, this
administration has knocked down the building blocks of a policy
that could help re-establish America's high-technology base ... We
can't afford for high-technology to go the way of steel, autos and
services.''
   Congressional sources have said the White House is gun-shy about
promoting policies that smack of the ``industrial policy'' tenets
espoused by Bush's 1988 campaign opponent, Michael Dukakis.
   The White House, the sources said, doesn't want to be in a
position of picking winners and losers in any competition for
government assistance.
   Commerce Department officials have said the administration no
longer plans to focus on HDTV as it tries to adopt a cohesive
telecommunications policy, and that advanced television will be
only a part of a broader consideration of a range of technological
initiatives.
   HDTV, which promises crystal-clear images for a wide range of
military, educational, medical and entertainment applications, will
rely heavily on sophisticated computer chips, and proponents argue
it will be a ``technology driver'' to revitalize the U.S.
electronics industry.
   Bush has proposed that new technology be spurred by a reduction
in the capital gains tax, a permanent research and development tax
credit, and changes in antitrust laws to encourage joint research
and development and production ventures.
   The Economic Policy Institute describes itself as a nonpartisan
Washington think tank supported by labor, business and individuals.
   The institute said Cohen is a former consultant to the Commerce
Department and the congressional Office of Technology Assessment.
Donow, a former professor at Colgate University, Cornell University
and the University of Virginia, is a telecommunications consultant,
the institute said.

<TEXT>
   Former Black Panther leader Bobby Seale pleaded
guilty to reduced charges today over a bad-check case involving
more than $7,500 in ribs he bought for a cook-off last year.
   Seale, 52, of Philadelphia, pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor
counts of attempting to pass bad checks. Each count carries a
possible penalty of six months.
   Judge William Aurelius set sentencing for Dec. 19.
   Seale's attorney, Terry Gilbert, said he has paid back all the
money for the ribs he bought at a local store and from a stay at a
local hotel, expenses he incurred for his participation in
Cleveland's National Rib Cook-Off from May 23-30, 1988.
   ``I need to get this (case) out of my hair,'' Seale said outside
the courtroom before making his plea.
   In February, he was indicted on charges of passing back checks
totaling $7,767.13 to buy ribs from Seaway Food Service in
Cleveland. The ribs were for his sales booth at the cook-off.
   In May, Seale was indicted again on three counts of passing bad
checks and one count of theft in connection with checks for $3,000
in lodging and other expenses incurred during the visit.
   All the original counts were fourth-degree felonies and together
carried a possible sentence of five years.
   With today's plea, the theft charge was dropped and the charges
of passing bad checks were reduced to misdemeanor charges of
attempting to pass bad checks.
   Seale said cook-off promoters had asked him to lend his name to
the event, assuming his presence would boost sales. Instead, he
said, sales were poor and expenses were high.
   Since leaving the radical Black Panthers group, Seale has
pursued various book projects, including writing a cookbook on how
to fix ribs. He also works as a community liaison for
African-American studies at Temple University.

   The House today rejected an attempt to slap
restrictions on U.S. aid to El Salvador, heeding the warnings of
conservatives who said such a move would be an overreaction to the
murders last week of six Jesuit priests and two others.
   On a 215 to 194 procedural vote, the lawmakers effectively
precluded the restrictions from being added to a $14.6 billion
foreign aid bill that also includes $533 million to aid Poland and
Hungary, and money for other U.S. allies around the globe.
   The El Salvador issue reopened old wounds in the House, where
the recent resurgence of violence brought to the surface harsh
differences about what U.S. policy there should be.
   ``To rush into this breech with this kind of amendment is
suicide, gentlemen, for that country,'' said Rep. Gerald Solomon,
R-N.Y.
   But Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., asserted that ``The Salvadoran
military remains above the law, and this Congress and this
administration have responded only with words. Words are simply not
enough.''
   The vote came just a few hours after President Bush told
reporters that it was important to continue support to the elected
government of rightist President Alfredo Cristiani.
   ``There is a freely elected government doing their very best
trying to get protection from these Marxist-led guerrillas coming
into the center of the city, and we support President Cristiani in
his effort to restore order,'' Bush said as he boarded Air Force
One for a day of campaigning for GOP candidates. ``This is not the
time to pull away from President Cristiani.''
   Bush had vetoed a version of the bill a day earlier over the
inclusion of money for a United Nations family planning agency, and
the House was expected to vote later on a version that would leave
out both the $15 million for the U.D. Population Fund and the
Salvador restrictions.
   The U.N. agency operates in China, which has a
one-child-per-family policy that anti-abortion activists say
results in forced abortions and sterilizations.
   Renewing assistance to the agency after a five-year hiatus would
have placed the United States ``in the position of supporting a
program that in turn supports coercive abortions, a program that is
inconsistent with American values,'' Bush said in his veto message.
   The new bill also would contain a compromise on a provision in
the original bill, stemming from the Iran-Contra scandal, which
would have prohibited the administration from using foreign aid
money as leverage to get other countries to do things it is barred
from doing.
   That kind of restriction ``would interfere with my
constitutional authority to conduct the foreign relations of the
United States,'' Bush said.
   But the veto also opened the door for Congress to make other
changes, and House liberals moved quickly to take advantage by
proposing restrictions on assistance to El Salvador.
   House Democratic leaders had overridden the objections of some
Republicans and cleared the way Sunday night for Rep. George
Miller, D-Calif., to offer an amendment restricting aid to
Christiani's five-month-old government.
   The move came largely in reaction to the killing last week of
six Jesuit priests, which many take as a sign that El Salvador's
right-wing ``death squads'' have renewed their activities.
   Conservatives, however, wanted to boost aid to El Salvador to
help the government combat a new offensive by leftist rebels.
   The veto marked the third time Bush has cited abortion
provisions in vetoing a bill. It brought criticism from Werner
Fornos, president of the Population Institute, a Washington-based
organization that says it seeks to bring population resources and
the environment into balance.
   ``He's selling out poor women throughout the world for his
domestic political advantage, a dubious political advantage,'' said
Fornos. ``Certainly the rest of America is not marching with him in
this insensitive, callous action.''
   Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to
Life Committee, said Bush's veto sent a message to population
control agencies that ``if you trample on human rights by
supporting compulsory abortion programs, you'll get no help from
the U.S. government.''

<TEXT>
   Communist leader Egon Krenz today met with an
envoy from Bonn in talks expected to focus on a West German offer
to bail out its Communist neighbor's economy in return for moves
toward a free market system.
   A Communist daily said extremists have urged their countrymen to
sabotage East Germany's electrical system as a form of protest. And
a West German poll found that if free elections were held now, the
Communists would be in third place.
   East Germany has told the European Community that it wants a
broad trade and economic cooperation accord and wants to start
talks on European security matters. But it rejected talk of a
German reunification.
   The letter, a copy of which was obtained today by The Associated
Press, was written by Prime Minister Hans Modrow to the 12 EC
governments.
   Rudolf Seiters, chief of staff to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, came
to East Berlin and met with Modrow to prepare next month's summit
between Kohl and Krenz, which will be the first ever between
leaders of the two states to take place in East Germany.
   Seiters met later with Krenz, and it was not immediately
revealed what the two discussed. East German television said a main
question from the East German standpoint would be whether Bonn is
ready for bilateral ties ``on a measurably higher level without
unacceptable conditions.''
   East German officials have rejected what they see as West German
attempts to lure the state from its socialist principles by linking
aid to the introduction of a free market economy.
   Krenz also canceled a trip to Prague scheduled for Tuesday, the
state ADN news agency said without giving a reason. The
Czechoslovak capital has been rocked by pro-democracy
demonstrations similar to those which have taken place all over
East Germany. Today, about 100,00 people demonstrated.
   The demonstrations here continued Sunday, despite the latest bid
for support by Communist leader Egon Krenz. Another big rally was
expected tonight in Leipzig, which has been a hub of protest.
   In an unprecedented open exchange with East German television
from his modest new home, Krenz said: ``There will be no going back
to the old conditions. The opening of the borders was the best
proof of our sincerity about reforms.''
   But many of the estimated 100,000 people who rallied in several
cities on Sunday to maintain pressure for free elections and other
democratic reforms insisted on new leaders and an end to Communist
dominance of the government.
   A poll commissioned by West Germany's Stern magazine showed the
opposition group New Forum the strongest contender, favored by 22
percent of those questioned.
   The Communists, with 14 percent of the vote, trailed both New
Forum and the Liberal Democratic Party, which has been among those
leading calls for change although until recently it was closely
aligned with the Communists.
   Krenz has promised free elections, but has not proposed a date.
   Stern said the survey was conducted by the independent West
German polling firm Forsa. It said 2,180 East Germans were
questioned but it did not provide a margin of error.
   At an East Berlin demonstration Sunday, most signs denounced
Communist rule and expressed popular distrust of Krenz, the party's
chief of security before being elevated to general secretary on
Oct. 18.
   The party's daily Berliner Zeitung, which reported on the call
for sabotage on its front page today, told citizens to ignore the
appeals.
   The newspaper confirmed earlier reports that leaflets had been
distributed in East Berlin calling for simultaneous overloading of
electrical circuits to cause a breakdown of the system.
   ``Whoever is producing such leaflets seeks neither
democratization of society nor economic reform,'' the newspaper
said. ``He wants only a breakdown.''
   Authorities opened East Germany's borders to the West on Nov. 9
in a bid to gain the trust of a populace demanding demand
democratic change and to try to end an exodus that was sapping the
country of young skilled workers.
   ADN said 50,000 protesters turned out in Dresden on Sunday to
denounce the country's leadership. They declared, ``We won't let
ourselves be blinded by the open borders.''
   On the second weekend of free travel, nearly 3 million East
Germans crossed into West Berlin and West Germany between Friday
and Sunday, West German border police said. The vast majority have
been returning to their homeland.
   Ferry service across the Elbe River, which forms part of the
border, resumed Sunday at Hitzacker, about 80 miles southeast of
Hamburg, for the first time since 1945.
   ADN reported pro-democracy rallies Sunday by 20,000 people in
Erfurt, 10,000 in Meiningen, 10,000 in Frankfurt-on-the-Oder, 3,000
in Schwedt and 2,000 in Neustrelitz. It said thousands protested in
Karl-Marx-Stadt, but did not give a precise crowd estimate for the
march there or in East Berlin.
   The agency said about 30,000 Communist Party backers
demonstrated in Potsdam to show support for the government's
announced reforms.
   In his television broadcast, Krenz said he favors a new voting
law to meet public demands for competitive elections.
   He also shrugged off a suggestion he could be ousted at a party
congress to be held Dec. 16-17 and at which more leadership changes
are expected.
   The television showed Krenz's new brown concrete home with a
small garden in East Berlin's the Pankow district.
   Krenz said he had moved to the ``quiet East Berlin street''
after assuming the party leadership. He said other members of the
party's ruling Politburo were also moving out of the exclusive
Wandlitz complex.

   Scientists say they've spotted the
farthest and oldest object ever seen, a quasar that gives a peek of
the universe near the beginning of time and challenges a popular
theory of how stars developed.
   The star-like body, about 14 billion light years from Earth,
possibly has illuminated like a flashlight in the fog the matter
that spawned everything from galaxies to life itself, according to
scientists.
   ``Astronomers have looked for more than 20 years for this
primordial stuff of which galaxies, stars and then us were
formed,'' said astrophysicist John Bahcall of the Institute for
Advanced Study. ``One possible interpretation is that it's been
found.''
   The object was seen through the 200-inch Hale Telescope at
Palomar Observatory, northeast of San Diego. The quasar is in the
constellation Ursa Major just below the Big Dipper's bowl.
   ``We've found the most distant object on record,'' said
astronomer Maarten Schmidt of the California Institute of
Technology. ``We are now seeing an object as it was a little over 1
billion years after the beginning of the universe.''
   Schmidt and astronomers James Gunn of Princeton University and
Donald Schneider of the Institute for Advanced Study, an
independent research center in Princeton, N.J., report the
discovery in December's Astronomical Journal. The find was to be
formally announced today.
   Quasars, as large as our solar system, are the brightest objects
in the universe. The brightest emits more light than 1,000 galaxies
of 100 billion stars each.
   Astronomers believe quasars form near black holes in the centers
of galaxies. Black holes are so massive their gravity sucks in even
light. But as matter is pulled in, intense bursts of light also are
emitted.
   Scientists say a gigantic explosion, the ``Big Bang,'' created
the universe 10 billion to 20 billion years ago. They usually cite
15 billion years as the universe's age.
   On that scale, the newly discovered quasar formed at least 14
billion years ago, meaning its distance from Earth is 14 billion
light years, or 82 trillion billion miles. One light year equals
5.88 trillion miles, the distance light travels in one year.
   If the universe is 20 billion years old, Schmidt said the quasar
would be about 18.5 billion light years away, or 109 trillion
billion miles from Earth.
   The discovery is ``striking, unexpected and very significant''
because it suggests the first galaxies and stars developed much
faster than can be explained by what is known as the ``cold, dark
matter'' theory, said Bahcall.
   The theory says that ``cold, dark matter,'' or hydrogen gas,
clumped together because of gravity to form stars and galaxies over
several billion years, not merely 1 billion years, Bahcall said
during a phone interview.
   Schneider said advocates of the theory may ``have to come up
with (new) theories that make galaxies faster.''
   Alternatively, light from the quasar may be partially blocked by
clouds of gas, but not primordial gas, which was uniformly
distributed in the young universe, Bahcall said.
   Because the age of the universe is uncertain, scientists measure
a quasar's absolute age and distance using a property called ``red
shift.''
   Just as a train whistle seems to shift to a lower pitch as a
train moves away from a listener, light from distant quasars shifts
toward the color red as they move away from Earth while the
universe expands.
   The newly found quasar has a red shift of 4.73, making it 7
percent older and more distant than the previous record holder, a
quasar with a red shift of 4.43 whose discovery was announced in
December 1987 by scientists in Arizona and England.
   The quasar is so distant that its light is 400,000 times too
faint to be seen by eye.
   Schmidt devised the idea of using the Hale Telescope to search
for distant quasars. Gunn built an extremely sensitive electronic
camera that made the search possible, while Schneider designed a
computer program that recognized the distinguished quasars from
hundreds of thousands of other objects.
   ``It's a fantastic technical achievement, a tour de force,''
Bahcall said.

   East Coldenham Elementary School pupils
went to school today for a lesson in dealing with grief and dealing
with terror at the site where seven of their classmates were killed
during a tornado.
   No classes were held, but officials staffed the school with
counselors and encouraged parents and children to come in and talk,
or peer through a doorway into the cafeteria where a wall of
concrete and glass shattered during lunchtime last Thursday.
   ``We want people to see that we're trying to get back into
normal,'' said Horst Graefe, director of pupil personnel for the
Valley Central School District. ``We don't want it to be a fearful
thing. The response has been extremely positive. People have come
in, taken a look, gotten their questions answered and have had a
chance to say hello to their friends again.''
   About two dozen mental health workers were at the school to
speak to parents and children. Outside, dozens of flower
arrangements stood in a cold rain against the boarded-up cafeteria
wall. Classes were to resume Tuesday.
   On Sunday, Gov. Mario Cuomo told an estimated 3,000 people at a
memorial service that ``so great a grief cannot be borne without
being shared.''
   ``Today even amid our crushing, frightening pain we remember the
blessing of these children, who were gems to everyone their lives
touched,'' the governor said Sunday night at Valley Central High
School.
   Two funerals were held Saturday, four more this morning, and a
seventh was scheduled for this afternoon. Two children remained in
critical condition at hospitals in in Newburgh and Albany. Sixteen
others either have been treated or released or were listed in
conditions ranging from good to satisfactory at five hospitals.
   Charles Scotto Jr., 7, was buried today along with a stuffed
Garfield doll, a New York Jets pin, baseball cards and a toy
dinosaur.
   ``Try to keep a picture of our Lord Jesus embracing our little
children,'' the Rev. Dominic Leo told mourners as Charles was
buried at a New Windsor cemetery. ``Let that scene be a comfort to
you.''
   At a private service for Joanna Lichtler, also 7, an honor guard
attended from the Coldenham Fire Department, whose members were
among the first on the scene following Thursday's disaster.
   At Sunday night's service, townspeople sang hymns, heard prayers
and tried to make sense of the disaster.
   Sandy Griffin, who brought her three children to the memorial
service, said it was important to be there even if she could only
hear the words over a loudspeaker.
   ``It means a lot to know that everyone cares,'' Griffin said.
``Everyone in this community is sticking together. You have to come
out here because it could have been your kids. If it were my kids I
would want my friends and family around me.''
   Vera DiBitetto stroked the blond hair of her 5-year-old son,
Michael. ``Maybe it will make us all a little more thankful for
what we have right now,'' she said.
   Hundreds of people _ families of the dead, injured and those
lucky enough to survive _ have turned to psychologists and social
workers in the wake of the tornado.
   About 50 to 60 mental health workers were available for families
at the district's schools all weekend.
   Dozens made private pilgrimages to the school over the weekend,
placing flowers in the shadow in the wall, now rebuilt in wood.
``Pray for the children,'' was spray-painted on the wall.
   Hundreds of residents have come to view the scene of the
tragedy, said Nathalie Weeks, Orange County mental health
commissioner.
   `They've been fantastic,'' she said of Newburgh residents. ``I
think families have been so brave and brilliant about coming in and
taking advantage of the counseling.''
   School social worker Larraine Wernow said she asked an
8-year-old survivor to draw a picture to express his grief. The boy
drew a school with a roof, floor and walls.
   But, she said, he was afraid the walls would come tumbling down.
   ``I couldn't give him a full assurance, but I told him it was
very unlikely it would happen again,'' Wernow said. ``I don't like
to lie to children. You can't lie to children.''
   Not just children and their parents are in need of help. Gus
Quist, a Newburgh volunteer firefighter who helped pull children
from the wreckage, said he's still shaken. ``It helps to talk about
it,'' he said.
   Wernow said she spoke with a man who heard about the tornado and
rushed to the school. He couldn't find his child, only learning
after several agonizing minutes that his wife had taken the
youngster home.
   ``He must have lost many years off his life in just those few
short minutes,'' Wernow said.

   Nicolae Ceausescu, president and
Communist Party leader of Romania, has created a cult of
personality greater than any in Eastern Europe since Soviet
dictator Josef Stalin.
   And despite the democratic changes sweeping the East European
countries around Romania, Ceausescu has firmly rejected similar
reforms.
   During his 24 years as Communist Party leader, he has exercised
absolute power that enabled him to carry out a foreign policy
independent of the Soviet Union and to keep Romanians under
iron-fisted domestic control.
   The old-style Marxist leader invested billions of dollars in a
crash industrialization program that led to widespread food and
energy shortages, and despair for Romania's 23 million people.
   The longer the food lines and the more vocal the people's
complaints, the more harshly the regime cracked down on critics.
   About 30,000 coal miners went on strike in the Jiu Valley in
1977 and 10,000 workers demonstrated in the city of Brasov in 1987
demanding freedom, better living conditions and Ceausescu's ouster.
Police arrested hundreds of demonstrators and their leaders
disappeared in mysterious circumstances.
   At a mass meeting in Bucharest in 1989, Ceausescu said, ``The
triumph of the revolution requires unity, severe discipline and a
spirit of sacrifice. A firm organization is needed as well as a
tested political leader who knows how to unite and lead the
masses.''
   Ceausescu's ``firm organization'' was the Romanian Communist
Party which he turned into a personal instrument after taking it
over in 1965.
   He gradually pushed aside all leaders who opposed his policies
and installed loyalists on the ruling 23-member Politburo,
including his wife, Elena, a chemist.
   The personality cult he encouraged, particularly after he was
sworn in as Romania's first president, took on the trappings of
worship and pervaded nearly all aspects of public life. His
pictures lined the streets in Bucharest and other Romanian cities
and bookstores were full of works attributed to him.
   When he was elected president in March 1974, an official picture
showed him holding a silver scepter as the symbol of authority.
   During the Ceausescu era, Romania, once known as the breadbasket
of the Balkans, became one of the poorest countries in Europe.
   Billions of dollars were spent on industrial and public works
projects, and food was rationed as the government exported all it
could to pay off its foreign debts. The debt was eventually paid
off in the spring of 1989 but the shortages continued.
   A massive secret police kept strict control on religious and
political expression, and dissent was quickly crushed.
   In the new climate of reform encouraged by the Soviet Union,
Romania has became increasingly isolated in both East and West.
   In a speeches at party meetings in 1989 he said strivings for
reform in some Warsaw Pact countries represent an abandonment of
communism.
   The United States and other Western powers originally encouraged
Ceausescu's relatively independent foreign policy stand within the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. Two U.S. presidents visited Bucharest,
Richard M. Nixon in 1969 and Gerald R. Ford in 1975.
   Ceausescu, who took power as Communist Party leader on March 22,
1965, continued diplomatic relations with Israel even after other
Soviet bloc countries broke them in the 1967 Middle East War.
   In keeping with his maverick image, he denounced the Soviet-led
invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and afterward refused to allow
any foreign troops in Romania.
   Romania was the only East bloc country to send athletes to the
1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, breaking the Soviet-led boycott.
   Ceausescu placed members of his family in key posts. His wife
was a Politburo member and first vice premier, and by the mid-1980s
she had become the virtual second-in-command of national life and
shared the limelight with her husband.
   Western analysts and knowledegeable Romanians estimate 40
members of his family held top jobs in the party and state
hierarchy.
   Born Jan. 26, 1918, in Scornicesti, Ceausescu was the third son
of a large peasant family. An elementary school dropout, he was
apprenticed as a shoemaker, took a job in a factory and joined the
illegal Communist Party youth organization at age 15. He became a
party member three years later, in 1936.
   Before and during World War II, his communist activities landed
him in jail several times. He became a protege of communist leader
Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, rose quickly in the party, and succeeded
Gheorghiu-Dej after his death.
   He continued Gheorghiu-Dej's policy of one-man, traditional
Stalinist rule.
   ``I don't give orders,'' he once told U.S. Secretary of State
William Rogers. ``I make suggestions. But they had better be
carried out.''

   Schools are closed. Factories have shut
down. Church pews are empty. No, it's not another economic downturn
or natural disaster. It's deer hunting season in West Virginia.
   For the next two weeks, about 320,000 hunters dressed in
fluorescent orange and wielding rifles will be roaming the woods in
search of bucks, and there's not much the rest of the state can do
but wait until they come back.
   ``The whole week is a disaster,'' said Dave Wooddell, president
of Delwood Equipment Co. in Charleston, which sells machinery to
coal and chemical companies. ``As far as any type of business
transaction being done, it's practically nil. Even Christmas is
better.''
   ``It's been happening for 30 years,'' said Bruce Davis, vice
president of Kanawha Manufacturing Co. in Charleston, which makes
steel parts for power plants and heavy industry. Only 10 percent of
the company's work force is expected to show up for work Friday and
for weekend shifts.
   ``They either take a vacation or go AWOL,'' Davis said. ``It's
something we have to live with and work around.''
   It's almost pointless to open schools in most West Virginia
counties during deer hunting season, education officials say.
   ``These boys are all country boys who like to hunt,'' said Paul
Winters, a school principal in Lincoln County, which has given
students and teachers a weeklong vacation this week. ``We've been
in school three months now, and absentee rates are always high
during Thanksgiving week because of deer season, anyway, so it's
time for a break.''
   Schools in 27 of West Virginia's 55 counties close for a full
week, said Carolyn Spangler, a spokeswoman for the state Division
of Education. One county closes schools for four days, 13 counties
close for three days and 14 counties close for two days, Spangler
said.
   Attendance is down at church services, too.
   ``Most of our men are gone,'' said Janet Jett, church secretary
at Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Elkview. ``It was about half of
what it normally would be last night.''
   If the weather stays clear and dry, hunters will bag about
70,000 bucks before Dec. 1, about 55 percent of the total annual
harvest, say biologists for the state Division of Natural Resources.
   Rifle deer hunting season began Monday. Bow hunting season,
which began Oct. 14, continues through the end of the year. Doe
hunting season runs from Dec. 7 to Dec. 9, and a six-day
muzzle-loading season starts Dec. 18.

   Congressional leaders said today that they
were within striking distance of agreement on a bill reducing the
budget deficit, one of the major issues lawmakers must resolve
before adjourning for the year.
   Legislators meeting in private late Sunday and early today made
progress in resolving their dispute over the amount of savings in
the package, members of both parties said.
   Estimates of the deficit cuts it contained ranged between $13
billion and $17 billion, but lawmakers said they believed their
differences were bridgeable.
   ``Things have developed in the last few hours that give me
confidence that we'll reach agreement today,'' House Speaker Thomas
S. Foley, D-Wash., told reporters.
   ``We're getting down toward the end, I think,'' said Rep. Bill
Frenzel of Minnesota, ranking Republican on the House Budget
Committee.
   Before they can end their 1989 session _ which they hope to do
this week _ lawmakers will have to decide how far they will go in
eliminating Medicare benefits for long-term illnesses. Work on that
issue was continuing with no indications of progress.
   The House today approved 310-107 a new version of the $14.6
billion foreign aid bill that President Bush vetoed Sunday.
   Lawmakers removed money for a United Nations agency that Bush
claimed financed forced abortions in China. Liberals also came out
on the short end of a 215-194 vote that would have clamped
restrictions on U.S. aid to violence-torn El Salvador. The bill now
moves to the Senate.
   House-Senate bargainers renewed their effort to decide how to
roll back the 1988 catastrophic health care law. The legislation
provides coverage to elderly patients with long-term medical
problems that otherwise could lead to financial ruin.
   When enacted, the measure had bipartisan and popular support.
But well-organized lobbying by seniors objecting to the surtaxes
they must pay to finance the program _ reaching $800 this year for
the most well-to-do _ has convinced lawmakers to undo the program.
   The House wants to repeal the entire measure, but the Senate
wants only to eliminate the surtax and most benefits, leaving
coverage of hospital costs and other minor provisions intact.
   The two chambers agreed Saturday to terminate the program, but
that deal unraveled Sunday. Legislators remained determined to
reach a new compromise, rather than returning home to angry
constituents.
   ``We can't leave here without final disposition of this issue,''
said Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Negotiators trying to strike a deal on a separate bill reducing
this year's federal deficit also made scant progress as disputes
arose over the savings in the measure and some of its provisions.
   President Bush has threatened to veto any measure failing to
achieve at least $14 billion in legitimate savings. Congressional
experts project that the shortfall for fiscal 1990 _ which began
Oct. 1 _ will be about $141 billion.
   Bargainers from the House and Senate agreed to a budget-cutting
deal early Saturday. But talks resumed Sunday after many lawmakers
said the measure fell well short of the savings target, with Dole
saying he thought it was insufficient by $5 billion to $6 billion.
   There seemed no disputing certain aspects of the package: that
it contains about $5.3 billion in new tax revenues and billions in
concocted savings achieved by shifting various payments out of the
fiscal year.
   All sides agreed it also would have to be supplemented by
several billion dollars in savings by retaining until at least
January the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law's cuts in federal
programs. Those reductions began Oct. 1.
   Should Congress succeed in wrapping up its business by week's
end, it would be unusually early for a non-election year. Since
1967, they have left town as early as November in an off-year just
once, in 1983. Election-year sessions tend to end much earlier to
allow time for campaigning.
   According to congressional records, Sunday's session was only
the 13th time the Senate has met on a Sunday. The first occurred
March 3, 1861, when 20 votes were taken on the issue of slavery.
Incomplete records show the House has met on four other Sundays
since 1978.

<HEAD>Editor Fired Over Photos of Royal Children</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note contents of following.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The publisher of The People newspaper said Monday
he has fired its editor for publishing photographs of Princes
William and Harry that were deemed to be ``not acceptable.''
   Wendy Henry, who was appointed six months ago by publisher
Robert Maxwell to edit the Sunday tabloid newspaper, had no comment
on her dismissal.
   The front-page photos showed 7-year-old William in a pose
captioned: ``Willie's sly pee in park,'' and a series of pictures
of 5-year-old Harry in a tussle with schoolmates.
   Their parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, issued a
statement deploring them as an intrusion into the boys' privacy and
a security concern.
   The photos appeared to have been taken in a garden square at the
school they attend.
   Maxwell said another photo in The People that he found
unacceptable was a closeup of entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. appearing
ill with an uncovered wound on his throat that the caption
attributed to cancer treatment.
   On Sunday, Ms. Henry said of the photographs of William: ``It is
a charming picture taken in a public place.''
   The photos of Harry, headlined ``His Royal Cry-ness,'' carried a
caption that said ``Shyboy Harry hates his pals ragging him,'' and
were accompanied by a text saying he was ``mercilessly picked on by
schoolmates'' and burst into tears whenever playtime ``threatens to
get too rough.''
   Maxwell praised Ms. Henry's ``outstanding journalistic
abilities'' but said ``there have been several occasions on which
distressing photographs, which many people found deeply offensive,
myself included, have appeared in The People; and there have been
intrusions into privacy which are not acceptable to me.
   ``Both were exemplified by the photographs of Sammy Davis Jr.,
showing him with his appalling cancer of the throat, and of the
children of the Prince and Princess of Wales,'' he told BBC radio.
   He also cited a recent picture in The People of dead bodies from
an airliner crash.
   Charles, heir to the throne, and his wife called the pictures
``intrusive and irresponsible.'' Their statement said they have
``regularly asked editors to respect the privacy of Prince William
and Prince Harry at school as they want the two young children to
have as normal a school life as possible.''
   ``In addition, the attentions of paparazzi photographers have
obvious security implications,'' the statement said.

   Ethiopian rebels and government officials
met Monday for a second round of peace talks and accused each other
of impeding progress in ending Africa's oldest civil war.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, serving as a neutral observer at
the talks, said at an opening ceremony that both sides were
``sincere and dedicated'' in their efforts to achieve peace.
   But the delegations, in statements delivered after Carter's
comments, made it clear they were not satisfied with each other's
behavior outside the talks.
   The Ethiopian government delegation accused the rebels of
intensifying ``anti-peace propaganda,'' and the rebel Eritrean
People's Liberation Front said the government was conducting a
campaign of ``fallacious arguments, disinformation and at times
outright blackmail ... to impede the progress underway.''
   The preliminary talks, which began in September in Atlanta, are
aimed at laying the groundwork for substantive negotiations to end
the 28-year-old secessionist war in Eritrea, Ethiopia's
northernmost province.
   Three of 13 questions remain to be resolved during the
preliminary talks: the designation of a chairman and co-chairman
for further discussions, the naming of a seven-member observer team
and the role it is to play, and the selection and duties of a
secretariat.
   Carrie Harmon, Carter's spokeswoman, said Carter and the
seven-member delegations met for about four hours after the opening
ceremony.
   ``The talks went very well,'' said Ms. Harmon. ``They got right
down to work.''
   The closed-door talks are taking place at a house in the Nairobi
area. Carter's wife, Rosalynn, is participating in the negotiations
as she did in Atlanta.
   Ms. Harmon would not comment on whether the delegations made any
progress in resolving the outstanding issues, or whether the
combative tone of the opening statements were reflected during the
talks.
   During the opening ceremony, Ashagre Yigletu, head of the
Ethiopian government delegation, said it was his government's
``fervent desire'' to see the Nairobi talks successfully concluded
and for the main substantive talks to be started as soon as
possible.
   But he said a recent major offensive by Ethiopia's second most
powerful rebel group, which he described as a ``grave and
orchestrated challenge,'' was an ``obstacle to the success of the
current peace talks.''
   The rebel Tigre People's Liberation Front, which operates from
Eritrea's southern neighbor, has pushed steadily southward since
August and is seen as a growing threat to the government in Addis
Ababa.
   Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam has accused the
Tigrean rebels of trying to further the cause of Eritrean
separatism.
   The rebels accused Ethiopia's government of conducting a
``futile war effort'' in Eritrea ``to escalate its campaign of
dislocation and dispersion, to weaken the Eritrean struggle and
create a de facto divided Eritrea.''
   The statement also spoke of the severe drought in Eritrea that
could threaten nearly 2 million people with starvation, and urged
the international community to provide the resources needed to
stave off widespread famine.
   The Marxist rebels, who hold much of Eritrea, have remained
largely behind lines gained during a major offensive last year.
   The opening ceremony was attended by about 200 diplomats,
Cabinet ministers and journalists. Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
encouraged both sides to continue working together to settle the
fighting, which has killed an estimated 1 million people.

   President Bush, with an early eye on the 1990
elections, went campaigning today in Illinois and Rhode Island for
two Republican congresswomen who disagree with him on abortion.
   The trip came one day after Bush cast his third abortion-related
veto this fall, knocking back a $14.6 billion foreign operations
bill because it included $15 million in aid for a United Nations
population control agency that Bush blames for supporting forced
abortions in China.
   The president made no mention of abortion in remarks at a
fund-raising lunch here for Rep. Lynn Martin, who is challenging
incumbent Democratic Sen. Paul Simon in next year's elections.
   Instead, he made a pitch for cutting the capital gains tax and
passing his anti-crime and clean air initiatives _ all of which
have been held up in the Democratic-controlled Congress.
   As Bush spoke at the $250-a-person Republican fundraiser, he was
heckled by members of the audience who shouted criticism of U.S.
policy in El Salvador.
   When a woman accused the administration of killing priests, Bush
replied: ``We are not. You be quiet.''
   He then sought to explain why the U.S. was supporting El
Salvador. With that, a man jumped up and shouted, ``Stop the
repression in El Salvador.'' The two demonstrators and two other
women were led out by security forces and the crowd applauded.
   ``Now, who's next?'' the president joked. ``I'm here to talk
about Lynn. This is not a town meeting.''
   A Chicago district police chief, Richard Dwyer, said later the
four protesters were charged with disorderly conduct.
   Later, Bush was bound for Providence, R.I., to raise funds for
Rep. Claudine Schneider, expected to mount a challenge next year to
Sen. Claiborne Pell, a Democratic veteran of 29 years in the Senate.
   He also was helping raise money for Gov. Edward DiPrete, who is
seeking a fourth two-year term in 1990 as Rhode Island's chief
executive.
   Bush said Martin has been in his corner on the fight for a lower
tax on capital gains, which are the profits on the sale of
investments such as real estate or securities.
   ``The capital gains battle may be over for this year, but the
fact is this: we've seen the votes _ a majority in both the Senate
and the House are on record in favor of cutting the capital gains
rate,'' the president said.
   ``When Congress reconvenes in the new year, cutting capital
gains is going to be one of the top items on my agenda. ... It's a
fight we're going to win,'' he said.
   On another topic, Bush said next month's shipboard meeting with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev off Malta ``will occur
because America has been resolute in defense of liberty.''
   The president began his stop in Chicago by visiting the Pickard
Elementary School classroom of Ana Zamora, a fifth-grader who asked
his help in ridding her neighborhood of drugs.
   ``The pressure is still on out there, so you got to follow
through on what you learn in this school,'' said Bush, who was
accompanied by Illinois Gov. James Thompson, Mayor Richard Daley
and other politicians.
   ``How many of you have ever heard the story about the Little
Train that Could? ... Picard is the little school that could,'' he
said.
   ``All of you have said no to drugs and you've said yes to
education,'' the president said. ``You've refused to be defeated by
marijuana, crack and terrible gang violence.''
   Ana asked Bush ``about how much do you arrest the people'' who
use drugs.
   ``We're beginning to make the case that the user, the person who
uses drugs, has to pay the penalty,'' the president said, urging
the children that ``once you decide you're not going to do it, then
reach out and help somebody else.''
   Asked about the first family's pet dog Millie, the president
said: ``Fine,'' and then disclosed he had taken the dog into the
shower with him the night before.
   ``She rolled in something bad,'' the president told the children.
   After Bush's address to school children in September outlining a
national anti-drug strategy, teachers at Pickard had their pupils
write the president about how drugs affected their lives. A letter
from Ana caught Bush's eye.
   ``I never go outside because my mom gets scared that I'll get
hurt because of the gang fights,'' she wrote. ``President Bush,
I've heard that you're pushing for a war on drugs. Please help
remove drugs from our neighborhood. I will do my part by saying no
to drugs, and I hope you can do yours. I know this is hard, but you
can do it.''
   Martin, Schneider and two other pro-choice GOP congresswomen,
Olympia Snowe of Maine and Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, met with
Bush last Tuesday to urge him to modify his hard-line stance
against abortion funding.
   Bush last month vetoed a major spending bill that would have
allowed Medicaid funding of abortions for rape or incest victims.
   While Bush believes abortion should be legal in those
circumstances, he opposes public funding of abortions except to
save the woman's life.
   Abortion rights became a heated issue in this fall's off-year
elections, with Democrats capturing governorships in Virginia and
New Jersey against Republicans who opposed abortion. When Bush
campaigned in both states Nov. 3, he avoided any mention of his
abortion views.
   Bush said Friday, in an interview with Mutual Radio, ``I know
that our party is big enough to have people in it who differ on
this question.''
   Martin, 49, is a longtime Bush ally who was a national co-chair
of his 1988 campaign.
   She said in an interview she does not think Bush's anti-abortion
stand will hurt Republican candidates.
   ``This is ironic, because just a year and a half ago, people
were asking me, `How can George Bush keep you on as national
co-chair of his campaign when you're pro-choice?''' she said.
   Schneider, 42, is among the most liberal Republicans in
Congress. Pell, who turns 71 on Tuesday, announced last week he
will seek a sixth term.

   Groups that help refugees are bracing for what
they expect to be a new flood of immigrants from El Salvador
following the slayings of six Roman Catholic priests and the
escalation of that country's civil war.
   ``I have no doubt the ones who make it out will be coming this
way,'' said Vicky Stifler, an attorney for Proyecto Adelante,
Spanish for ``project forward,'' a legal service representing
Central American refugees.
   ``They travel by land, foot and bus so they won't be arriving
tomorrow. It'll be a few weeks before they start trickling in.''
   About 30 lawyers attended a training seminar on handling
political asylum litigation over the weekend at Southern Methodist
University.
   The seminar, sponsored by Proyecto Adelante, the State Bar of
Texas, Catholic Charities and the South Texas Pro Bono Asylum
Representation Project, was aimed at relieving what officials say
is a critical shortage of lawyers willing to assist political
refugees.
   ``I think this is probably the greatest area of need in this
country that is not being met,'' said Steve Anderson, a business
attorney in Dallas. ``I think a lot of the people would be facing a
death sentence if they had to go back.''
   Ms. Stifler is the only full-time worker for Proyecto Adelante,
where the majority of the clients are Salvadoran. She and a
volunteer handle about 1,300 cases a year.
   ``We haven't had to turn anyone away so far, but we're not going
to be able to continue if we don't get some help,'' Ms. Stifler
said.
   Thousands of immigrants still are being held in detention
centers in southern Texas and are in dire need of legal assistance,
said Karen Keltz Haring, director of Political Asylum Projects for
Southern Methodist University.
   Ms. Haring said detained refugees must be prepared so they can
effectively convince judges and immigration officials that their
lives would be in jeopardy if they were not allowed to stay in this
country.
   ``Many don't speak English, or understand the workings of the
court,'' Ms. Haring said. ``It's hard enough for someone with a
legal degree and who speaks English fluently to do it.''

   Victoria Principal prepared for her role as a
blind woman in an upcoming made-for-television movie by wearing a
blindfold for two weeks.
   ``I cooked dinner blindfolded, I baked, I made sandwiches, I
scrambled eggs, ate meals, and I even tended to business at my
office with my eyes covered,'' said the former star of CBS'
``Dallas'' in an interview in the Nov. 25 issue of TV Guide.
   In the ABC movie ``Blind Witness,'' Ms. Principal plays a
determined blind woman who avenges her husband's murder.
   The actress said she even slept with a blindfold during her film
preparation, and that the most frightening part was in the
mornings, ``because there's no way to prepare for waking up blind.''
   During filming in Utah, she wore special contact lenses that
distorted her vision and made her legally blind.
   ``I had to memorize all my locations before we shot a scene,''
said Ms. Principal, who was also executive producer for the movie.
``I would count every step and practice moving to my marks over and
over again, because I couldn't see my marks.''

   Koch will write a weekly column for the New York Post, the
paper's publisher, Peter Kalikow, announced in Monday's editions.
   ``I will be even less inhibited as a columnist than I was as
mayor,'' Koch promised. ``The world will be my oyster.''
   Koch, who will be succeeded by Democrat David Dinkins, has made
sure he won't be idle when he leaves office. The three-term mayor
has already agreed to teach at New York University and do regular
commentaries for local television and radio stations.
   ``Anyone who's ever covered Ed Koch would have been very

   Indianapolis Colt Harvey Armstrong and seven
teammates will debut an anti-drug rap song, ``Leave It Alone,'' for
10,000 schoolchildren at the Hoosier Dome on Tuesday.
   The morning rally is the brainchild of Colts assistant public
relations director Keith Newton and Karen Braeckel of Indianapolis
Newspapers Inc. Newton said it was his solution to the avalanche of
requests from schools that wanted Colts football players to speak
about drug abuse.
   ``I just could not accommodate all the requests,'' Newton said
Monday. ``We thought instead of having the Colts go out to the
kids, this would be bringing the kids to the Colts.''
   More than 200 buses will transport middle school students from
eight counties for the hourlong rally, whose highlight will be the
rap song by Armstrong, Clarence Verdin, Andre Rison, Bill Brooks,
John Brandes, Michael Ball, James Pruitt and Pat Davis.
   Armstrong, a seventh-year nose tackle, is the driving force
behind the team's participation, Newton said.
   ``They've been meeting for last couple months or so on a regular
basis, composing the words, coming up with the music for their
song,'' Newton said.

   Donald Regan got in his licks Monday in his
feud with Nancy Reagan, reviewing the book by his former boss'
wife, and declaring it to be ``a classic of inadvertent
confession.''
   In what may, or may not, be the last word in their
ink-splattered battle over which one of them hurt President Reagan
more, the former White House chief of staff said Mrs. Reagan
``seems incapable of understanding how her words and deeds might
seem selfish, hypocritical and, indeed, even frightening to those
on the outside.''
   She and her ghostwriter, William Novak, ``have produced a
classic of inadvertent confession,'' Regan wrote in a Washingtonian
magazine review of ``My Turn,'' Mrs. Reagan's memoirs.
   ``Very sadly, and most of all, this book gives aid and comfort
to those who still believe that Ronald Reagan never should have
been elected president in the first place,'' Regan said.
   The story so far:
   _In May 1988, Regan, having been fired 13 months earlier,
published his memoirs. They pictured Mrs. Reagan as a scheming,
``shadowy, distaff presidency'' and disclosed her use of astrologer
Joan Quigley.
   ``Virtually every major move and decision the Reagans made
during my time as White House chief of staff was cleared in advance
with a woman in San Francisco who drew up horoscopes,'' he wrote.
   _Last month, in ``My Turn,'' Mrs. Reagan got even. She wrote
that Regan had often ``acted as if he were president'' and deserved
to be fired because the Iran-Contra affair occurred ``on his
watch.''
   She also acknowledged turning to Ms. Quigley for advice, but
only for scheduling decisions, not policy or politics. She accused
Regan of having ``betrayed'' a confidential relationship with the
astrologer. She said she never guessed he would take that fact
``and twist it to seek his revenge on Ronnie and me.''
   Taking his turn, Regan said astrology played a bigger role than
Mrs. Reagan was willing to admit.
   ``I wrote about astrology because it was an essential truth
about the way the Reagans operated,'' Regan wrote.
   ``It was a daily, sometimes hourly, factor in every decision
affecting the president's schedule ... He _ or in this case she _
who controls the president's schedule controls the workings of the
presidency.''
   Regan also raised security questions, saying the nation owes Ms.
Quigley a vote of gratitude for not revealing to a potential
assassin ``intimidate details of presidential movements.''
   As for the larger question, Regan asserted that Mrs. Reagan _ in
acidly criticizing many of Ronald Reagan's closest advisers,
including Edwin Meese III, James Baker III, David Stockman,
Alexander M. Haig, William Clark and William Casey _ ``damages her
husband and his presidency,'' Regan said.
   ``After all,'' he wrote, ``these were Ronald Reagan's choices,
made after close consultation with his financial and political
supporters and friends in California; he must have thought that
they met his own standards.''

<TEXT>
   About 200,000 angry demonstrators
marched through downtown Prague today in the largest protest ever
against their hard-line Communist government.
   For the first time in decades major protests involving tens of
thousands of citizens also broke out in other cities, according to
state-run Czechoslovak television. The demonstrations were peaceful.
   The protesters met in central Wenceslas Square, then set out
across town for Hradcany Castle, the residence of President Gustav
Husak, in a noisy, triumphal procession for democracy.
   ``It's the end, Milos!'' and ``Jakes out!'' the protesters
cried, referring to Communist Party chief Milos Jakes. They also
called for free elections and loudly supported a general strike
called by students and artists for Nov. 27.
   The march was the fourth major protest in Prague in as many days
and indicated severe trouble for the Communist government, which
until recently faced only small demonstrations. Leaders have
rejected reforms that have swept through neighboring Communist
countries in recent weeks.
   Police did not stop the march, but they blocked bridges across
the Vltava river leading to the castle. Many demonstrators changed
course and continued on to a major plaza, Old Town Square, chanting
``We are the people.'' Later, they dispersed peacefully.
   The small police presence today contrasted sharply with last
Friday, when security forces severely beat demonstrators, prompting
widespread outrage.
   ``The bell tolls for you!'' the crowd chanted. Some carried
banners reading, ``Democracy for all'' and ``Red murderers to
court.''
   The marchers jeered as they passed the offices of the Communist
trade union daily, Prace, crying ``Are you Czechs?''
   ``Here it happened,'' they yelled, as they passed the site where
police beat demonstrators on Friday. Several candles marked the
spot.
   Trolley cars rang their bells as the protesters passed and
bystanders jingled their keys, adding to the noise.
   In an unusual move, the state-run news agency CTK reported the
demonstration quickly and in objective language. It noted the
protesters ``express strong disagreement at the action taken by
riot police'' on Friday. Czech television reported 200,000 people
along the path of the march.
   Also today, students began a sit-in strike at Prague
universities to protest police attacks on demonstrators, and a
Communist leader for the first time condemned the bloody crackdown
Friday.
   Banned playwright and prominent activist Vaclav Havel canceled a
trip to Sweden, where he was due to accept the Olof Palme award, to
protest the violence. In Sweden, it was announced that Foreign
Minister Sten Andersson will go to Prague to present the award to
Havel.
   East German Communist Party chief Egon Krenz postponed a visit
to Prague that had been scheduled for Tuesday. And Britain summoned
the Czechoslovak ambassador to protest the police beatings of two
British journalists. It called the weekend violence ``disgraceful
and gratuitous.''
   In Washington today, State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said of the events Friday: ``By attacking peaceful
demonstrators, Czechoslovakian authorities further damaged their
credibility at home and abroad.''
   In a statement, she urged the Czechoslovak government to ``end
this senseless violence against is own citizens.''
   According to unofficial reports, student strike committees were
negotiating with university authorities at the Technical University
in Prague and the downtown Film Faculty.
   At least three official Prague theaters went on a de facto
strike, refusing to put on shows and terminating cooperation with
official media, actors told The Associated Press by telephone. They
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A statement of the official Socialist Union of Youth called
Friday night's police crackdown on student demonstrators
``politically irresponsible.''
   The communique was endorsed by Vasil Mohorita, the union's
chairman and Communist Party central committee secretary. It was
the first time a Communist official publicly condemned such police
action.
   Many people were injured Friday in clashes with the police, who
used truncheons, tear gas and attack dogs to disperse the largest
demonstration in 20 years. Hospital officials said 100 people
required treatment.
   The march was to commemorate student Jan Opletal, killed by the
Nazis 50 years ago. It was the largest demonstration in
Czechoslvakia since August 1969, when some 50,000 people gathered
in downtown Prague a year after a Soviet-led invasion crushed a
reform movement.
   The socialist daily Svobodne Slovo joined in the condemnation of
the official handling of the demonstration. The paper gave full
coverage to the events, even quoting witnesses of bloody beatings.
   ``Such police action only creates tension in society and causes
natural resistance, especially of those who are the future of our
country _ the youth,'' the daily said.
   By contrast, the Communist Party daily Rude Pravo in an
editorial today called for ``resolute action against provocations.''
   On Sunday, authorities arrested 10 dissidents, including Petr
Uhl, a leading human rights activist. He was charged in connection
with the spreading of news about the purported death of a
mathematics student at police hands Friday. The government has
called reports of the student's death ``an unfounded rumor.'' If
convicted, Uhl could be sentenced to 3{ years in prison.
   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe:
   _The Romanian Communist Party opened a party congress, and
President Nicolae Ceausescu denounced the democratic reforms
sweeping much of the East bloc. Many Western ambassadors boycotted
the gathering to protest human rights violations.
   _In East Germany, a Communist Party daily said some extremists
urged their countrymen to sabotage the nation's electrical system
as a form of protest. One Sunday, more than 100,000 people
demonstrated in several cities to demand reforms.
   _About 2,000 Bulgarians took part in another pro-democracy
protest Sunday, a day after the largest rally staged by dissidents
in the country's Communist history. They signed petitions
criticizing the Communist leadership.
   At a news conference today, Havel said he would not travel to
Sweden to receive the Olof Palme award even if authorities issue
him a passport.
   ``I will not make use of that passport, and I will not leave the
country,'' Havel said.
   ``I do not wish to serve as a false visiting card of this regime
which wants to claim that a foremost dissident is traveling abroad
... while people are brutally beaten in the streets,'' he said.

<HEAD>Agreement Signed Selling The Anchorage Times to VECO International</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who has owned The Anchorage
Times for more than 50 years is selling it to a locally based
oilfield service company, the two sides announced today.
   An agreement wrapping up the transaction was signed by Bob
Atwood, publisher and owner since 1935, and William Allen, VECO
International board chairman.
   The purchase price was not disclosed. Under terms of the sales
agreement, the sale is to become final Dec. 14.
   VECO is buying the newspaper's assets but not The Anchorage
Times Publishing Co., which will stay in Atwood's hands, officials
said. That company puts out books on state history and other
non-newspaper publications.
   The evening newspaper will remain the only locally owned and
operated daily newspaper in Alaska's largest city, and Anchorage
will remain one of about a dozen cities nationwide supporting two
competitive daily newspapers, Allen said in a statement.
   ``It would have been a tragedy to have outside interests control
both newspapers in Anchorage,'' said Allen.
   His reference was to the Anchorage Daily News, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning newspaper owned by the California-based McClatchy
Newspapers group. The Times was once the dominant paper but is now
No. 2 in circulation behind the News.
   VECO will commit substantial but unspecified resources to the
newspaper in efforts to expand state and local coverage, Allen
said, and Atwood would serve as an adviser to the newspaper.
   The newspaper would maintain its present ``Alaska-oriented
editorial philosophy,'' he said, and news content will be left in
the hands of independent journalists.
   Atwood, 82, said he wanted a buyer ``who would continue the
operation, face up to the McClatchy competition and at the same
time be a sensitive and strong supporter of Anchorage and the state
of Alaska.''
   Atwood, and his late wife, Evangeline, bought the newspaper in
1935, when Anchorage's population was about 2,400 and the paper's
circulation was 650.
   VECO was founded in 1969 and has grown to be one of the state's
largest employers. The company has specialized in oil and mining
services. In addition to its Alaska operations, it has subsidiaries
in Washington, California and Colorado.

   President Bush on Monday defended Salvadoran
President Alfredo Cristiani and his own administration against
suggestions of complicity in the murders of six Jesuit priests in
El Salvador.
   First, Bush told reporters that Cristiani had assured him the
Salvadoran government was not involved in last week's murders.
Then, at a political fund-raiser, the president faced a heckler who
said his administration was killing priests.
   ``We are not. You be quiet,'' Bush shot back.
   His accuser and three other people who also voiced criticism of
U.S. actions regarding El Salvador were led out by security guards
as the crowd applauded.
   Bush went on to say, ``We must not pull our support away from a
freely elected government in Central America.''
   Before leaving for Illinois and Rhode Island on a political trip
for two Republican congresswomen seeking Senate seats, Bush
indicated he might well veto any congressional effort to cut off
aid to the ``fragile democracy.''
   House Democrats did try to put new restrictions on money for El
Salvador, but that effort failed in a 215-194 procedural vote
Monday as the House worked on a broad foreign aid bill Bush vetoed
for different reasons a day earlier.
   There was no effort to cut off aid entirely.
   Bush spoke to reporters as he prepared to board Air Force One at
Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, near Washington, for the flight
to Chicago.
   He said concerning El Salvador, ``This is no time to undermine a
fragile democracy that is under attack.''
   Bush on Sunday vetoed the foreign aid appropriations bill that
contained money for El Salvador, partly over a provision providing
$15 million for a United Nations agency that funds a Chinese
program that is said to promote abortion as a form of population
control.
   Democratic House leaders decided to open up the bill to a debate
on money for El Salvador, partly in response to speculation by
critics of the Salvadoran government that the murders of six Jesuit
priests were committed by government sympathizers.
   ``In the first place, there is no question, I hope, in the minds
of the American people that we strongly condemn the killings'' last
week of the Jesuit priests ``and apparently the killing of another
priest,'' Bush said.
   Later, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater cited a report ``still not
confirmed that a conservative priest was killed'' in addition to
the six last week.
   ``Here's a freely elected government doing their very best,
trying to protect their population from these Marxist-led
guerrillas coming into the center of the city,'' Bush said. ``And
we support President Cristiani and his effort to restore order.''
   ``This is no time to pull away from President Cristiani,'' Bush
said.
   In their telephone conversation, which he said had taken place
within the past 48 hours, Bush said, ``I told him how strongly we
feel about the killings. And I told him that they must get to the
bottom of it.''
   Bush said he had also offered Cristiani ``technical help in
investigating and bringing to justice'' the murderers.
   Fitzwater said this help would basically consist of
``forensics,'' such as help in fingerprint investigation.
   ``People who did this, whether they come from the extreme left
or the extreme right, (should be) paying the penalty,'' Bush
said.``We cannot condone killing.''
   ``My pitch is this: that we must not pull away from a freely
democratically elected government that had certification of the
freedom of those elections. And to continue to have a handful of
countries ... supporting the outdated concept of Marxist guerillas
is unacceptable to the United States and I must tell the Congress
of the United States that I will not accept as president a cutoff
of aid to El Salavador. That's it.''
   Asked if he believed Cristiani's assurances that his government
was not involved in the killings, Bush said, ``Absolutely. I
believe it. And if some renegade forces were involved on the left
or the right, they should be brought to justice.''
   ``Cristiani would not lie to me on a matter of this nature,''
Bush added.

   Hindu priests left their temple, doctors
stopped work at a leper clinic, children cut classes and motorists
left the dusty roads to see the man who may be the next prime
minister.
   Vishwanath Pratap Singh leads a loose-knit coalition of
opposition groups trying to oust Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and
his Congress Party in parliamentary elections being held Wednesday,
Friday and Sunday.
   Singh, 58, is running for a seat in Fatehpur, which means The
Place of Triumph in Urdu and is 375 miles east of New Delhi on the
holy Ganges River.
   His 25-vehicle caravan traveled 60 miles of poor roads to reach
voters in remote villages, stopping about every three miles so
Singh could speak to supporters.
   ``My winning is not an issue here,'' he said at one village.
``The issue is the defeat of the Congress Party, the eradication of
corruption.''
   Polls indicate the National Front coalition may oust Gandhi and
the Congress Party and make Singh, once Gandhi's most-trusted
minister, India's next leader.
   The opposition accuses the government of high-level corruption,
alleging the Swedish arms manufacturer Bofors paid as much as $50
million in kickbacks to get a $1.4 billion army artillery contract.
   Gandhi has denied the accusation, but his government's
popularity has suffered severaly.
   ``There is no doubt that we are going to win,'' Singh said,
waving to children who had left school to see him.
   Many people in Fatehpur see him as a crusader against corruption.
   ``He is the best man to become the prime minister,'' said Abdul
Jabbar, a 70-year-old priest.
   ``Fatehpur will have a prime minister now,'' said Rabhubir
Singh, a 55-year-old farmer not related to the candidate. ``He is
another avtar,'' incarnation of God.
   Many residents have begun calling Singh the ``pradhan mantri,''
or prime minister, and he does not discourage them.
   ``This is a people's wave,'' he said at a rally of about 1,000
people near a Hindu temple at Kurai. ``It is the people's wish that
corrupt politicians should go.''
   At the end of the day, a procession of supporters chanted in
unison, ``He is not king, but a saint!''
   Singh smiled, his hands outstretched.

   Jurors chosen to decide the fate of a man
accused in the bus crash deaths of 27 people viewed the charred
wreckage of the bus today in silence as the man's trial got under
way.
   Jury selection was completed in the murder trial of 36-year-old
Larry Mahoney of Worthville, who police said was drunk when his
pickup truck crashed into a bus on Interstate 71 near here in May
1988. The church-owned school bus was taking youngsters and adults
home from an outing.
   Shortly after the 12 jurors and four alternates were seated,
they were briefed by Carroll Circuit Judge Charles Satterwhite and
then taken in vans to a warehouse four blocks away where the
wreckage of the bus and Mahoney's truck is stored.
   Jurors also were taken to the crash site, and opening arguments
were scheduled for this afternoon.
   Mahoney is charged with 27 counts of murder, 42 counts of wanton
endangerment, 12 counts of assault and one count of drunken driving
in connection with the May 14, 1988, accident that occurred as
Mahoney was driving his pickup truck in the wrong lanes of the
highway.
   If convicted on all counts, Mahoney could face prison sentences
ranging from 20 years to life.
   As he has since jury selection began Nov. 8, Satterwhite took
extra steps today to ensure jurors remained anonymous. Each was
referred to by a number instead of by name.
   Under the ground rules established by the judge for the visit to
the warehouse, jurors were instructed not to talk to one another
and the prosecution and defense lawyers did not get to lecture them
on how to interpret what they were seeing. The judge told jurors it
would be their only visit to the site during the trial.
   Mahoney's lawyers have said that the construction of the bus,
which lacked safety features required on newer models, would be a
key factor in the defense. The victims died of smoke inhalation
after when fire from the ruptured gas tank engulfed the bus.
   Satterwhite said four jurors would serve as alternates instead
of the customary one or two because of the length of the trial,
which lawyers say could last at least six weeks.

<HEAD>Complaints About Judges Should be Open, Task Force Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The public should be given greater access to
complaints against federal judges, a task force appointed by a
private research organization said Monday.
   The group also recommended measures to protect people,
particularly lawyers, who file complaints against the judges.
   The task force of The Twentieth Century Fund said its proposals
are intended to strengthen a 1980 law authorizing the federal
judiciary to discipline its members for misconduct or disability.
   ``Because the 1980 procedures call for self-policing of the
judiciary, their legitimacy has been questioned by some critics,''
the task force said. ``The legitimacy of these reforms would be
enhanced if an auditing mechanism were put into place.''
   The group proposed creating a special committee appointed by the
U.S. Judicial Conference, the policy-making arm of the federal
judiciary, to oversee complaints against judges.
   The committee would include lawyers, scholars and members of the
general public and generally would be authorized to reveal
now-confidential complaints against judges as long as the charges
are not frivolous.
   The task force, headed by University of Pennsylvania law school
professor A. Leo Levin, also said it favors protecting anyone who
files a complaint against a judge by barring the judge from any
sanction against the individual.
   ``We were troubled by testimony we heard from practicing
attorneys who voiced reticence about filing a complaint out of
concern that doing so would jeopardize their clients or hinder
their careers,'' the task force said.
   The task force report was prompted in part by recent
congressional impeachment and removal from office of three federal
judges: Alcee L. Hastings of Florida, Harry E. Claiborne of Nevada
and Walter L. Nixon of Mississippi.
   Hastings was acquitted on charges of soliciting a bribe for a
favorable decision from the bench. Claiborne was convicted of
income tax evasion. Nixon was convicted of perjury.
   The task force said impeachment and removal should remain
difficult in order to guarantee judicial independence. But it urged
a congressional study to determine whether the impeachment process
should be changed to promote greater accountability for judges.
   The task force also said it frowns upon any ``conspiracy of
silence'' that allows infirm judges to remain on the bench when
they no longer are capable of doing the work.
   ``It is particularly important that the chief judge (of each
respective federal regional circuit) exercise the obligation to
prompt such a judge to step down before formal procedures are
invoked,'' the task force said.
   Besides Levin, the task force members are Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass.; Abner Mikva, a federal appeals court judge here; Nancy
Neuman, president of the League of Women Voters; University of
Southern California law school professor Judith Resnik; Dorothy
Ridings, publisher of The Bradenton (Fla.) Herald; U.S. District
Judge Jack Weinstein of New York; author and Northwestern
University professor Garry Wills, and Texas Tech University law
professor Thomas Baker.

   A federal prison inmate suffering from AIDS was on
his way to a private hospital Monday after a judge ruled the U.S.
Bureau of Prisons lacks adequate facilities to treat the disease.
   Lawyers in the case of Leonardo Botero Gomez, 43, said Monday
they are preparing a class-action lawsuit on behalf of all federal
prisoners with AIDS.
   ``This is a precedent-setting case putting the Bureau of Prisons
on trial for their callous disregard of prisoners' serious health
care needs,'' said attorney David Tucker, who represented Gomez.
   It is the first time a sentenced federal prisoner has been freed
on bond for medical treatment, said Tucker's associate, Benson
Weintraub.
   In Washington, Bureau of Prisons spokesmen Greg Bogdan said the
agency was conferring with its counsel and seeking more information
before responding publicly to the ruling. He initially said there
was not a large number of federal inmates with AIDS, but later said
the agency would not comment on that subject.
   Gomez, sentenced May 5 to a minimum 10 years for cocaine
trafficking, is in the most advanced stage of AIDS and has a life
expectancy of 24 months or less, Weintraub said.
   On Monday, the inmate was en route to an undisclosed hospital
for treatment, the lawyer said.
   U.S. District Judge Eugene Spellman ordered Gomez freed Friday
on $250,000 bond pending a full civil trial, scheduled for January.
The inmate was released later in the day after Spellman's order was
upheld by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
   Spellman heard testimony that Gomez, who is taking the anti-AIDS
drug AZT, was being treated at the infirmary of the federal
Metropolitan Correctional Center near Miami. About every four weeks
he was sent to the AIDS treatment center at Miami's public Jackson
Memorial Hospital.
   ``The treatment lacks the quality of continuity which is
considered necessary in treating an illness of this nature,''
Spellman wrote in his decision.
   The judge also said the prison lacks some of the drugs necessary
to prolong Gomez's life, and found that the prison doctor had seen
Gomez only twice in the previous two weeks.
   ``The care available to (Gomez) does not meet the requirements
of the law,'' Spellman ruled.
   The U.S. Attorney's office, which sought unsuccessfully to keep
Gomez in prison pending trial, refused comment on the case.
   The Bureau of Prisons runs an AIDS treatment center in
Springfield, Mo.

<TEXT>
   James Cason, turned away by the Senate for a
top environmental job in the Bush administration, asked the White
House on Monday to withdraw his nomination.
   The action effectively ends an eight-month battle between
President Bush and environmentalists over the controversial nominee
for assistant secretary of agriculture for natural resources and
the environment.
   ``Withdrawal of this nomination is a great disappointment,''
said Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who announced Cason's
request. ``The lobbying effort against him was both misguided and
unfair.''
   There was no immediate respones from the White House, which
never waivered in its support of Cason despite repeated requests
from individual senators to withdraw the nomination.
   Bush was in Chicago and Rhode Island on Monday, campaigning for
Republican candidates.
   Cason was opposed by the Sierra Club, National Wildlife
Federation, Wilderness Society, League of Conservation Voters and
National Audubon Society.
   The groups alleged that Cason's record in several top Interior
Department positions during the Reagan administration showed
favoritism toward private development of public lands, despite
environmental concerns.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, agreed with the environmentalists and worked to defeat
Cason after his committee sent the nomination to the floor on a
12-7 vote.
   The Senate, after weeks of behind-the-scenes persuasion by Leahy
others, including Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of the
Energy and Natural Resources, sent the nomination back to the White
House on Friday and asked that it not be resubmitted.
   Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas suggested the move after it
became clear that a floor vote would defeat Cason.
   It was the first rejection of a Bush nominee by the full Senate
since John Tower was voted down as defense secretary in March.
   ``Since I became chairman in January 1987, the Agriculture
Committee recommended to the Senate the confirmation of 22
nominees,'' Leahy said. ``In spite of the fact that I may not have
agreed with the president's choice in each case, I voted for their
confirmation on the Senate floor.
   ``I would have been unable to do so with Cason.''
   Leahy said that while Reagan was president, Cason was ``part of
a team that frequently overrode the long-term national consensus to
protect our environment, favoring instead short-term economic gain
of a few _ mostly timber, oil and gas interests.''

   The Magic Kingdom of Disneyland may be
more than white-knuckle rides and a cast of animated characters _
it also can be a modern religious pilgrimage, two scholars say.
   In addition to Fantasyland, Tomorrowland and Frontierland, the
Magic Kingdom could add Sanctuaryland to the visitor agenda,
Christopher and Dbra Parr said at a joint session of the American
Academy of Religion and the Society of Biblical Literature.
   The two Boston University doctoral candidates presented a paper
Sunday on the religious significance and spiritual pleasures of
Disneyland.
   The park, which evokes paradise and purity, is a sanctuary from
the hectic outside world, the Parrs said.
   The couple admitted they were introducing unaccustomed whimsy
into the annual meeting of religion scholars. Debra Parr teaches
American literature; her husband teaches in Boston University's
religion department.
   While Disneyland has no religious symbols on its grounds, the
Parrs say messages are there.
   It begins with the huge parking lot that has tall signs painted
with cartoon characters. Perhaps, the Parrs ask, ``Goofy, Pooh Bear
and Dumbo are the seraphim who will watch over your wheels while
you're within the shrine?''
   ``The park itself is secluded, walled off from the `profane,' an
island of harmony, order, peace,'' the Parrs say.
   The Magic Kingdom subtly assures people that this is America the
Beautiful with a shiny future: ``The distinctly religious message
... is that the future will bring happiness, as in the song `When
You Wish Upon a Star.'''
   Some recent churchgoing visitors to Disneyland were asked what
they thought of the Parrs' theory.
   One compared the park's ambiance to a friendly church
atmosphere. ``You see all the cultures here mixing together. God's
family on a holiday together,'' said Bert O'Connell, of West
Lafayette, Ind.
   However, Cindy Myers, of Orange County, said she saw a darker
side with ``overtures of the occult'' in the magical fantasies, the
Palm Reader booth and Crystal Shop on Main Street U.S.A.

<HEAD>Striking Newspaper Workers Lose Court Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspaper workers lost a court battle Monday in
their bid to restore their chief editor, who was fired after
publishing remarks by a controversial parliamentarian.
   A regional court declared illegal a strike by workers at the
Banner of Communism newspaper in Noginsk, a city east of Moscow.
The court said that if the workers don't return to their jobs
Tuesday, they will be fired or fined.
   The controversy began last month, when the newspaper published a
speech by Yuri N. Afanasyev to the Interregional Deputies Group, an
organization of opposition members of the Congress of People's
Deputies to which he and maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin belong.
   The contents of the speech were not known, but Afanasyev has
challenged the very underpinnings of the Soviet state, saying the
official ideology of Marxism-Leninism is outmoded.
   The newspaper's publishers, the city government and Communist
Party officials in Noginsk, Afanasyev's home district, fired the
editor-in-chief of Banner of Communism on Oct. 25. The officials
accused editor Vladimir Puchkov of being ``ideologically
irresponsible,'' the weekly Moscow News reported.
   A mass rally in defense of the newspaper was held three days
later, and its workers went on strike Nov. 3 to press for Puchkov's
reinstatement.
   The city took the strikers to court, and supporters packed the
Moscow courtroom for Monday's hearing, brandishing slogans such as
``Let's Defend the Freedom of the Press'' and ``Hands Off
Free-Thinking Editors.''
   Defense lawyer Andrei Makarov contended the strike was purely
political and legal, particularly because a parliamentary decree
says the press should give priority to publishing materials by its
local parliamentarians.
   Afanasyev testified the case was a ``symptom of the curbing of
glasnost, a symptom of opposition to the course defined by the
Communist Party.'' He said the court action stemmed from President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's criticism of him and other outspoken
practitioners of glasnost in a meeting with editors last month.
   Referring to the Interregional Deputies Group, the Soviet leader
reportedly accused Afanasyev and two economists of joining with
Yeltsin to form ``a fascist clique striving for power.'' Informed
Soviet sources said Gorbachev told the meeting Afanasyev should be
expelled from the Communist Party.
   Afanasyev, the 55-year-old head of the Moscow State Historical
Archives Institute, came under repeated attack in the state-run
press after Gorbachev's remarks.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda quoted Afanasyev as saying the
party has no authority and has led the country nowhere. Pravda said
Afanasyev, who appears frequently at rallies by unofficial
political groups and speaks in a booming baritone, never backs up
his charges with proof and has turned from historian to priest. In
another article, the newspaper quoted him as saying perestroika
marks the end of the last empire, the Soviet Union.
   He shot to fame in a nationally televised speech in May to the
Congress. With Gorbachev looking on, Afanasyev said the Soviet
leader had either listened to, or influenced an ``aggressively
obedient majority'' in the Congress to elect a
``Brezhnevist-Stalinist'' legislature.

   Here is President Bush's exchange with hecklers
Monday over U.S. support for El Salvador. The exchange took place
at a fund-raising luncheon for Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill.
   A woman in a broad-brimmed hat at the front of the crowd of
2,000 began shouting, ``Why are we supporting El Salvador?'' The
crowd began booing her.
   ``Just a minute. The lady asked a good question,'' Bush said.
``Let me repeat and I'll give her an answer if you promise to be
quiet after I answer. You promise? Word of honor? All right, good.
   ``The question is, `Why are we supporting El Salvador?'''
reiterated Bush.
   ``No, the question is why are we killing priests in El
Salvador?'' a second woman shouted.
   ``The answer is we're not and you be quiet and hear the answer
to your question,'' he said sternly.
   ``We are supporting El Salvador because it had certifiably free
elections. President Cristiani is trying to _ '' Bush said,
stopping as the women began shouting him down. Police led the two
women out of the room.
   A minute later, a young man began shouting at the front of the
crowd: ``End the war! Stop the repression in El Salvador!''
   Bush said, ``Look at this guy! Look at this guy! What's your
position?''
   As the man was hustled away, Bush said, ``Let me just say a word
about El Salvador and maybe it will help.
   ``It was the FMLN, the Marxist-Leninist FMLN, that shot its way
into the middle of El Salvador trying to disrupt Salvador's
democracy. And President Cristiani told me on the phone that they
will do everything they can to bring to justice _ whether they are
from the right or the left _ those who wantonly murdered those
priests.
   ``But we must not pull our support away from a freely elected
democratic government. Now, who's next? All I ask is equal time,''
said Bush.
   The crowd cheered.
   There were also protesters at the back of the hall and one of
them was ejected, too.

   Actress Dina Merrill married film executive
Ted Hartley over the weekend in a small San Francisco ceremony, her
publicist said.
   Esme Chandlee, who represents the couple in Los Angeles, said
the Saturday wedding at the Church of Saint Mary the Virgin was
attended by friends and family members. Former baseball
commissioner Peter Ueberroth was the best man, Chandlee said Monday.
   The socialite actress is the daughter of Edward F. Hutton,
founder of the Wall Street brokerage firm which was absorbed by
Shearson Lehman Hutton, and millionairess Marjorie Merriweather
Post of the Post cereals empire.
   Hartley, 59, is the chairman and chief executive officer of
RKO-Pavilion and Miss Merrill, 63, serves as creative director for
the film production company.
   It is the third marriage for Miss Merrill, whose second marriage
was to actor Cliff Robertson.
   Born Nedinia Hutton in New York City, she adopted a stage name
and began performing in film and television in the mid-1950s.
   She has appeared in the films ``Caddyshack II,'' ``Butterfield
8,'' ``Operation Petticoat,'' and the television mini-series
``Roots II.''
   Her latest motion picture, ``Fear,'' is set for release in a
couple of months, Chandlee said.

   Emergency medical services in many rural areas
are plagued by personnel shortages, inadequate training, out-dated
equipment and lack of financial and medical resources, according to
a report released Monday.
   The very nature of rural areas, where residents often live many
miles from a hospital, creates special problems that can delay
emergency services, which sometimes results in death or permanent
injury, the Office of Technology Assessment, a congressional
research office, said in its report.
   More federal money and better state planning could ease some of
the problems that affect the health care of the one-quarter of the
U.S. population that lives outside the nation's metropolitan areas,
the report said.
   The extent and quality of emergency medical services vary from
state to state. For example, Hawaii spent nearly $14 per capita on
such services in 1988, while Ohio spent 2 cents for each resident,
according to the report.
   Federal funds for emergency medical services reached about $30
million annually after passage of the 1973 EMS Systems Act, but
began to decline in 1981 when the money was folded into block grant
programs.
   In 1988, about $18 million in federal funds went to the states
for emergency medical services.
   The report argues for an increased federal role in providing
these services to rural areas, but doesn't say how much additional
funds would be necessary.
   Among the options the report lists are increased federal funds
for training and continuing education for emergency medical service
personnel and more federally funded research and demonstration
programs to address problems unique to rural areas.
   The report also suggests development of national guidelines or
standards for emergency medical service providers and specialized
facilities such as trauma centers.

   An Alabama man awaited extradition Monday
following his arrest hours after being added to the FBI's 10 Most
Wanted List for a 1986 shooting spree that killed a woman and
wounded two others.
   Lee Nell Carter, 34, was arrested Sunday night following several
telephone calls from viewers who said they recognized him from
descriptions given on the television show ``America's Most
Wanted,'' said FBI agent John Anthony.
   ``We had no idea Carter was in Detroit,'' Anthony said.
   FBI agents and Detroit police officers arrested Carter at a home
on the city's east side, where he shared an apartment with another
man. Anthony said Carter might have been in Michigan for the past
1{ years.
   Carter had been sought since a Nov. 15, 1986 shooting spree in
Mobile, Ala., that left Mesha Sneed dead and two others wounded.
The incident apparently was sparked by a broken romance, Anthony
said.
   Although Carter was indicted Dec. 11, 1986 on one count of
murder and two counts of attempted murder, police inadvertently
released him from custody eight days later, Anthony said.
   Carter was being held pending extradition to Alabama.
   Carter was convicted in 1979 of murdering his father, Anthony
said. But the suspect told police Sunday that he was on probation
for that offense.
   Carter became the 428th fugitive to be added to the FBI's most
wanted list since its establishment in 1950 and the 122nd fugitive
captured with civilian help. He might also have been the most
quickly apprehended, Anthony said.
   Carter's name was added to the list about 9 p.m. Sunday and
police arrested him about 11 p.m., but exact times were not
immediately available, Anthony said. The television show aired in
Detroit at 8 p.m.

<TEXT>
   The House has unanimously approved a bill that
would give students from China the opportunity to remain in the
United States rather than face possible political persecution back
home.
   The bill, a reaction to the oppression of students demonstrators
by the Beijing government, cleared the House 403-0 late Sunday and
was sent to the Senate, which has yet to act.
   President Bush is expected to sign the legislation.
   The legislation waives the requirement that holders of exchange
visitor visas, known as J visas, return home for at least two years
before applying to the U.S. government for a change in their visa
status.
   About four-fifths of the 40,000 Chinese students in the United
States hold that type of visa. They would be required to file for a
change in visa status within four years of enactment of the bill,
or return to China.
   The bill also requires the Justice Department to give special
consideration to Chinese nationals who seek asylum status in the
United States because of China's population control policy of only
allowing one child per family.

<HEAD>Carrie White Celebrates 115th Birthday; Guinness Calls Her Oldest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON WORD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PALATKA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No one complained when Carrie White napped
through Monday's celebration of her birthday _ at the age of 115,
the woman who may be the world's oldest person ought to be able to
do what she wants.
   Mrs. White finally awakened after the party to eat a piece of
birthday cake, while photographers snapped her picture.
   ``It's quite an honor to be associated with a spunky lady that
has made such an achievement,'' said Marjorie Allen, Mrs. White's
guardian for the past five years.
   For her age, Mrs. White is in good health. Doctors say her heart
is sound. She takes no medication and seems nearly immune to colds
and the flu.
   Asked if she thought Mrs. White would make it to 116, Mrs. Allen
replied, ``You betcha!''
   Mrs. White received a certificate Monday from the Guinness Book
of Records certifying her as the oldest living person.
   Not everyone readily accepts that. Jackson Pollard of
Milledgeville, Ga., says he's 122, born on Christmas Day, 1866.
   Pollard doesn't have a birth certificate or a family Bible to
prove his age. But he's gathered enough evidence that Guinness is
checking into his account. The legal counsel for Central State
Hospital, where Pollard lives, verified his birthdate as before
1870.
   Central State records indicate Pollard's mother lived to be 107
and his father to 99.
   Mrs. White leads a relatively active life for her age, attending
church and singing activities at the Putnam Memorial Nursing Home,
Mrs. Allen said.
   ``She lives to be dressed up. She loves her makeup and jewelry.
She likes to primp and she likes a lot of attention,'' she said.
   Mrs. Allen said Mrs. White's drowsiness during her party may
have been the result of two private parties in the past two days
which had interrupted her routine of sleeping from 6 p.m. to 10 a.m.
   Mrs. White, who likes to chew tobacco and eat Fig Newtons,
actually turned 115 Saturday. She began the day Monday with a trip
to the beauty shop.
   The party attended by about 600 people took place in a tent on
the ground of the nursing home, where Mrs. White has lived for the
past five years.
   Mayor Tim Smith proclaimed Monday ``Carrie White Day in
Palatka'' and she received telephone calls from U.S. Sens. Bob
Graham of Florida and David Pryor of Arkansas.
   A group of third-grade students from nearby Mellon Elementary
School had front-row seats for the party because they are regular
visitors to the nursing home.
   ``It's the chance of a lifetime to get to do this,'' said Paige
Johnson, a giggly 8-year-old, who said 50 is old and Mrs. White is
``twice-old.''
   The students are involved in an adopt-a-grandparent program at
the nursing home, said teacher Annie Brown.
   Mrs. White was born Carrie Joiner on Nov. 18, 1874, in Gadsden
County. She lived and worked near Tallahassee and married John
White, who was a blacksmith or farmer.
   In 1909, the day after her 35th birthday, her husband committed
her to the Florida State Hospital at Chattahoochee, a hospital for
the mentally ill.
   ``Carrie will not talk about the past. She realizes something
bad happened and she doesn't care to remember,'' Mrs. Allen said
Monday.
   At age 110, she was finally released from the hospital in 1984
as part of a program to move geriatric mental patients from state
institutions.
   Hospital records describe her problem as ``post-typhoid
psychosis,'' but doctors today don't recognize the term.
   Mrs. Allen's attempts to locate Mrs. White's close relatives
have failed, although some distant cousins may have been located in
Texas.

<TEXT>
   The House of Commons makes its television debut
Tuesday with lights, cameras but only some of the action.
   A strict code has been laid down to save the Mother of
Parliaments from making an unseemly spectacle of herself. But while
some Honorable Members dislike the whole idea, others say the
restrictions on what the cameras may show amount to censorship.
   Nonetheless, when Speaker Bernard Weatherill shows up on the
nation's TV sets, kicking off the day's debate in his black gown,
silk stockings and horsehair wig, it will herald a change which
most legislators are convinced will transform the character of
Parliament.
   Eight remote-control cameras have been installed in the ornate
chamber, and the air conditioning has been improved to cope with
the heat from the Chinese lantern-shaped TV lights.
   The parties have held training sessions to advise their members
how to dress and speak on television. MPs have studied their
performance on closed-circuit TV, and in a special concession,
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has been allowed to practice
privately in the House of Commons, using large-type notes so she
doesn't have to wear glasses.
   ``The front benches (the leading members of the government and
the opposition) have been given advice about where to lean and
where to look and to try to cover their bald patches,'' said Clare
Short of the opposition Labor Party.
   The first live pictures from the House of Commons on Tuesday,
the day of the ceremonial State Opening of Parliament, will show
Weatherill opening the day's business.
   Then, for the first time, viewers will be able see opposition
leader Neil Kinnock assessing queen's speech, and Mrs. Thatcher
responding.
   From then on, Britain's four national channels and the Sky
satellite network will be able to broadcast as much as they like of
the daily proceedings, live or recorded.
   C-SPAN, the U.S. cable-satellite public affairs network, plans
to offer portions of the debates to its subscribers.
   Cameras have been permitted in the U.S. House of Representatives
since 1979 and in the Senate since 1986.
   The House of Commons voted 318-264 in June to allow in the
cameras.
   The House of Lords, Britain's unelected upper chamber, has been
televised since 1985. Indeed, even before the Commons cameras
switch on, TV viewers will have seen Queen Elizabeth II giving her
regular annual address to the Lords.
   The Commons arrangement is on a trial basis until July, when the
650 lawmakers can decide whether to make the arrangement permanent.
   Mrs. Thatcher is among those opposing the idea, saying she fears
for the ``good reputation'' of the Commons.
   MPs have reason to be camera-shy. Orators frequently have to
shout over a din of boos and wisecracks while the Speaker howls for
order. MPs also like to sprawl out on the upholstered benches.
   So a parliamentary committee has drawn up strict rules based on
those used in Canada's House of Commons.
   To deter members from flaunting buttons or attention-getting
garb, cameras will be allowed to show only the head and shoulders
of the member who has the floor.
   On an ``occasion of grave disorder,'' the cameras must ignore
ruckus-makers and focus on the speaker.
   ``The eating of oranges, the reading of newspapers, and the buzz
of conversation will not be permitted to come between the MP and
the eager viewer,'' said Conservative lawmaker Julian Critchley.
``We shall appear as so many animated postage stamps.''
   Former Prime Minister Edward Heath, whose striking white hair
and rumbling voice mark him as one of the best TV performers, calls
the rules ``illogical and completely unjustified ... I hope the
television boys will soon sweep it all away.''
   Mike Broadbent, who runs the BBC's Commons coverage, said: ``We
would much prefer to be in the same position as a person in the
public galleries so we can see Parliament, warts and all.''
   The same rules have not stopped grandstanding in Canada.
Opposition members have flopped dead fish on the prime minister's
empty desk and flashed a Cabinet minister's home telephone number
to get viewers to deluge him with complaints.
   Most of the pressure will be on Kinnock and Mrs. Thatcher,
especially during the cut-and-thrust of twice-weekly ``Question
Time,'' when Mrs. Thatcher squares off for 15 minutes against all
comers.
   Until now, proceedings could be heard live on radio, which was
allowed into the Commons in 1978. TV networks could play the sound
but show only a file photo of the person speaking.

<HEAD>`Here Goes Nothin' Says Co-Pilot Before Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cockpit crew of Flight 5050 called out all
the proper flight checks but failed to fix a misaligned rudder
before their plane skidded off the end of a New York LaGuardia
Airport runway, flight recorder data indicated Monday.
   ``Oh, here goes nothin','' said inexperienced co-pilot
Constantine Kleissas as he started a takeoff that ended in the East
River with the jetliner in three pieces and two people dead.
   A transcript of cockpit and radio conversations along with
readings from a flight data recorder from the Sept. 20 crash,
however, do not show conclusively whether the crackup was caused by
human or mechanical error, National Transportation Safety Board
investigators said.
   Flight 5050, headed for Charlotte, N.C., carried 57 passengers
and a crew of six.
   The safety board released a preliminary report on the
recordings, which are undergoing further analysis. The two crew
members have heard the tape, and their comments are to be included
in a later report, the board said.
   The transcript showed that Kleissas and Capt. Michael W. Martin
had gone through a list of checks, including a check of the rudder.
   Investigators said earlier that a device that holds the rudder
steady during takeoff was wrongly set in the full left position,
which could account for the drift the pilot said led him to abort
the takeoff.
   The data recorder showed movement in controls that would
normally occur as the pilot checks the positions of wing and tail
surfaces that control takeoff and flight. But the data also showed
that the ``rudder position returned to 15.9 degrees left'' after
the maneuvers, when it should have been set at zero for takeoff.
   ``All the appropriate items on the before-engine start,
after-engine start, the taxi and the before-takeoff checklists were
verbalized,'' said safety board engineer James R. Cash in a
description of the flight recorder conversations.
   Cash did not indicate, however, whether all the actions taken
were at the correct time or whether all checks were actually made.
   He said the first abnormal sounds on the recording came 35
seconds before the crash when a ``bang'' was followed by a ``loud
rumble.'' He did not indicate the source of the sounds.
   The transcript highlights Kleissas' inexperience, as Martin
tells him what to do and corrects his callout of flight checks. It
was Kleissas' first operational takeoff of a 737 after completion
of flight training. He had flown 3,300 flight hours, mostly in
smaller passenger planes.
   A dialogue in the cockpit dramatizes earlier reports that
Kleissas accidentally hit a button that disconnected automatic
throttle advances, but the captain corrected the error by advancing
the throttle manually.
   ``I got the steering till you, ah ...'' Martin said.
   ``OK,'' said Kleissas.
   ``OK, that's the wrong button pushed,'' said Martin.
   ``Oh yeah, I knew that,'' said the co-pilot.
   ``It's the one underneath there,'' the captain said, adding
later, ``All right, I'll set your power.''
   A few seconds before the plane skidded off the end of the
runway, Martin took over the controls to abort the takeoff.
   ``Let's take it back,'' the captain said.
   This is followed, according to the transcript, by ``sounds
similar to throttles hitting the idle stops ... rumble sound
increases in amplitude ... sound of engine noise decreasing.''
   ``USAir 5050 aborting,'' Kleissas said into the radio.
   After 10 seconds without any human voices, the co-pilot said,
``We're goin' off, we're goin' off, we're goin' off.''
   This was followed by the sound of the crash and the end of the
recording.
   The safety board also released the results of drug tests on the
pilot and co-pilot taken 44 hours after the crash.
   The tests, based on urine samples, showed no trace of illegal
substances.
   The Federal Aviation Administration suspended the licenses of
both men two days after the crash, citing their failure to appear
immediately for drug and alcohol tests.
   The drug report also quoted two New York police divers as saying
they talked with the captain shortly after the crash and found no
signs of intoxication. Both policemen were described as expert
witnesses because of their experience with drug and alcohol abusers.
   One diver, Edward D'Alessandro, described Martin as ``absolutely
clear-eyed, calm and together,'' the report said.

   A Marxist and a conservative businessman
on Monday prepared strategies for a presidential runoff that offer
voters a clear choice between right and left.
   Fernando Collor de Mello, the top vote-getter in last
Wednesday's election, met with leaders of his center-right National
Reconstruction Party in Brasilia, the capital, to study tactics for
the second round on Dec. 17.
   Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, of the radical left Workers Party,
huddled with his advisers in Sao Paulo, Brazil's biggest city and
industrial center.
   With 99.3 percent of the ballots counted from last Wednesday's
vote, Collor de Mello led the 21-candidate field with 28.4 percent.
Da Silva was second with 16.1 percent.
   More than 82 million Brazilians were qualified to vote in
Brazil's first free election for president since 1960. Direct
presidential balloting was banned during the 1964-1985 military
regime, and current civilian President Jose Sarney was chosen by an
electoral college.
   The new president will face a nation on the brink of
hyperinflation, burdened with huge foreign and internal debts.
   The candidates admit the election will be a clear contest of
left vs. right. But both are maneuvering to obtain broader support,
not only for the runoff but for a future government that must deal
with an independent Congress with added powers under Brazil's new
1988 constitution.
   ``All our contacts have an important electoral aspect, but
mainly they are aimed at creating conditions to govern,'' said Rep.
Renan Calheiros of Collor de Mello's National Reconstruction Party.
   Collor de Mello, 40, a former governor from the poor
sugar-growing state of Alagoas, said he expects a major victory
over da Silva, whose policies he characterized as radical.
   ``His platform is sectarian, restricted and extremely radical.
That alienates sectors fundamental for the formation of a
government of national conciliation,'' Collor de Mello said at a
news conference.
   Collor de Mello, who has pledged to fight government corruption
and reduce state interference in the economy, said he would
capitalize on the Workers Party's lackluster record in big-city
mayorships.
   Da Silva, 44, a former lathe operator and union president, said
he would paint his adversary as an ally of the hated military
regime and a represenative of the conservative elite.
   ``Ideological polarization is inevitable,'' said Rep. Luiz
Gushiken, president of the Workers Party. ``We will try to show
that Collor de Mello is a rightist and doesn't have the moral
stature to represent the people.''
   He said the Workers Party expected to win the support of Social
Democrats and, especially the left-center Democratic Labor Party of
populist Leonel Brizola. Brizola came in third, a scant 400,000
votes behind da Silva.
   Brizola did not admit defeat and said his party was considering
requesting a recount. But aides said the candidate could throw his
support to da Silva.

   Here is the 215-194 roll call Monday by which
the House refused to permit the offering of an amendment to
restrict U.S. aid to El Salvador. The overall vote had the effect
of heading off the restrictions, but caution should be used in
interpreting any one member's vote, because other reasons also
could be present.
   A ``yes'' vote is a vote to allow the amendment to be offered.
   Voting yes were 187 Democrats and 7 Republicans.
   Voting no were 53 Democrats and 162 Republicans.
   X denotes those not voting.
   There is one vacancy in the 435-member House.

   The man in charge of the ball that drops in
Times Square on New Year's Eve said Monday there is no truth to
reports he was considering turning the shining sphere into a
sliding billboard.
   New York magazine, quoting an unidentified source, said a
soft-drink company was negotiating to put an advertisement on the
ball.
   Not true, said Steven Israel, owner of One Times Square, the
building millions stare at in the waning seconds of each year. Last
year he got rid of the tourism-touting ``Big Apple'' that was used
for several years, and brought back the classic ball.
   ``I think it's a great American tradition,'' Israel said. ``I
fought hard to keep that tradition by bringing back the old ball,
and I'll make sure it stays that way.''

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa arrived
Monday after a successful U.S. tour, pledging that Eastern Europe
and Latin America would work together in improving their
debt-ridden economies.
   Sporting a U.S. Congressional tie clasp and a medallion of
Poland's Black Madonna, Walesa was greeted by hundreds of labor
leaders and members of the Polish community as he landed at
Venezuela's Simon Bolivar International Airport on a private
chartered flight.
   Walesa was in Venezuela to attend a world labor summit called by
the World Confederation of Labor, a 50 million-member organization
to which his Solidarity trade union is affiliated.
   Enthusiastic reporters broke through a cordon as Walesa
descended on the tarmac and surrounded the jovial union man who
thrilled crowds on his U.S. tour.
   ``Do not fear. Walesa is here to be with you, to serve you and
not to govern you,'' Walesa said, speaking through an interpreter.
   Walesa said Poland and Latin America shared common interests in
fighting for solutions to their foreign debt burdens.
   ``The debt is like a man with swollen feet who cannot put his
shoes on. It is impossible to move forward,'' said Walesa.
   Poland owes foreign banks $38 billion, while Venezuela, the
fourth-largest Latin American debtor, owes $34 billion to banks,
mostly in the United States. The total Third World debt stands at
$1.3 trillion.
   Asked whether possible U.S. aid to troubled Eastern Europe would
mean less funds available for Latin America and Africa, Walesa
pledged international solidarity in solving the global crisis.
   ``It is a poor militant who cannot recognize the necessity in a
brother. Latin America has a moral imperative to receive aid
because of past exploitation,'' said Walesa.
   Walesa said solutions would come when developing nations, like
Eastern Europe, improved the efficiency of their economies.
   ``But not at the cost of the worker. The unions must fight for
all they can. They must be strong,'' Walesa said.
   ``But they must not strangle the system in which they operate,''
he added.
   Walesa said he had no political ambitions in Poland, where a
coalition he helped form three months ago ousted a hard-line
Communist regime.
   He compared himself to an ``anti-hero,'' saying he was willing
to serve, but did not expect any honors from it.
   Walesa was scheduled to stay in Venezuela for three days to
attend the labor summit and meet Venezuelan political leaders.

   Two families tried in separate ways Monday
to deal with the knowledge they raised each other's child, and a
legal battle loomed against a hospital their lawyers blame for
switching newborns.
   Relatives said Robert Mays was in seclusion with Kimberly, the
girl he's raised since birth more than 10 years ago and just
discovered isn't his real daughter.
   Kimberly Michelle Mays is really the child of Ernest and Regina
Twigg, according to the results of genetic blood tests made public
Sunday. Attorneys for both families say the tests also showed that
Arlena, the daughter the Twiggs reared, was born to Mays and his
late wife, Barbara, who died of cancer in 1981.
   Arlena died of heart disease last year.
   When Mays was told Sunday that his only biological child had
died, the first thing he asked was the site of her grave, said his
attorney, Arthur Ginsburg.
   Mays was expected to return to Sarasota on Tuesday and attend a
news conference Wednesday at his attorney's office, legal assistant
Judy Lee said.
   The parents say the girls were born just a few days apart in
late November and early December 1978 at Hardee Memorial Hospital
in Wauchula in rural central Florida.
   With results of the genetic tests, the Twiggs' lawyer, John
Blakely, said he will press the hospital harder for information
about how the babies were switched.
   ``The Hardee Memorial Hospital has been uncooperative in helping
us solve this tragedy,'' Blakely said. ``It's been a real tragedy
for the two families and hopefully we will find out how it
happened.''
   Blakely has filed a federal suit against Hardee Memorial
alleging employees switched the Twiggs' newborn for a sickly child
through negligence, medical malpractice or deliberate acts.
   Ginsburg said Mays also might sue.
   ``It was either a terribly negligent act or somebody's done
something deliberately that's hurt a lot of people,'' the lawyer
said. ``There isn't any fair amount of money to compensate them for
what they've gone through and what they're going to go through.''
   Harrell Connelly, administrator of Hardee Memorial, was
unavailable for comment Monday; the hospital switchboard would only
take messages and calls were not returned. Janet Adams of Orlando,
the hospital's lawyer, didn't immediately return calls.
   The battle over Kimberly was the outgrowth of the Arlena's fatal
heart condition. Blood tests revealed she wasn't related to either
of the Twiggs. After her death, the couple began a 14-month search
for the child they lost.
   So far, they have only seen pictures of the slender, hazel-eyed
Kimberly. The next step is for psychologists to interview the girl
and draw up plans for a first meeting and a schedule for visitation.
   To get Mays to agree to genetic testing, the Twiggs agreed not
to seek custody. They say they'll be satisfied with visitation
privileges.
   ``After we consulted with some psychologists, we determined that
it would most likely be in Kimberly's best interest to stay with
Mr. Mays,'' Blakely said Monday during an appearance with the
couple on ``CBS This Morning.''
   ``We're trying to work it out so Kimberly can be a real winner
in this matter. She can maintain her loving relationship with the
man who she has thought to be her father while simultaneously she
can get two new loving parents, additional parents,'' he said.
   Ginsburg said he hadn't talked to Mays since giving him the test
results, and didn't know how Kimberly reacted.
   ``Kimberly is our granddaughter. She is still our
granddaughter,'' Merle Coker, the man Kimberly calls Grandpa, said
Monday. ``We're doing fine. We'll survive. We'll play it by ear.''

<HEAD>Senators Call for Tighter Reins on Misleading Mailings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congress needs to put tighter reins on mass
mailings from private groups that raise millions of dollars by
raising questions about the future of Social Security and preying
on the fears of the elderly, a Senate panel was told Monday.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., said ``fright mail'' often
arrives in official-looking envelopes from groups with names
resembling those of government agencies, exhorting senior citizens
to send money to protect their benefits.
   He displayed a stack of mailings and solicitations received by
an 85-year-old New York man that Moynihan said was enough to
``chill your blood.''
   ``More and more, we receive letters from seniors expressing
concern about this pattern,'' said Moynihan, chairman of the
Finance subcommittee on Social Security and Family Policy. ``There
is a common element of fright.''
   Sen. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., said there is growing support in
Congress for legislation to rein in such mailings, adding that some
groups should ``be thrown in jail for the kinds of things that have
been perpetrated on senior citizens.''
   Postal Service officials told the subcommittee that misleading
mailings are a top priority for investigators, but many cannot be
stopped under current law because they do not constitute outright
fraud or false representation.
   ``Many mailings which may confuse some postal customers into
believing that they originated with or had the approval of the
Social Security Administration or some other agency of the United
States government cannot be successfully challenged,'' said Kenneth
M. Hearst, assistant chief postal inspector for criminal
investigations.
   The Postal Service suspects some groups use the mailings for
``padding very nice payrolls'' but the money is long gone by the
time a lengthy criminal investigation can be completed, said George
C. Davis, assistant general counsel for the Postal Service.
Clamping more restrictions on the mailings is tricky to do without
encroaching on free speech protections, he said.
   ``It's very difficult to pass legislation that outlaws sleaze,''
Davis said.
   The postal officials voiced support for legislation sponsored by
Sens. John Heinz, R-Pa., and David Pryor, D-Ark., that would
require groups using official-sounding names, seals and insignias
to include a conspicuous disclaimer of government affiliation.
   Heinz cited groups such as the Social Security Protection
Bureau, the Internal Review Service and the National Senior
Advisory Center as among those whose names imply a government
affiliation where none exists.
   ``We need a bigger stick to protect our constituents,'' Heinz
said. ``We have an obligation ... to stop these kinds of deceptive
activities.''
   Congressional concern about private mass mailings increased this
year after many groups used the mail to mobilize opposition to the
Medicare catastrophic health insurance program enacted last year.
Critics said many of the letters led senior citizens to believe the
program would cost them more than it did.
   Moynihan said several direct mail companies and private groups
that use mass mailings were invited to testify at Monday's hearing,
but only two agreed to appear and one didn't show up.
   The lone group to send a representative was the non-profit
National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, whose
president, Martha McSteen, defended the group's ``educational
mailings to senior citizens.''
   She said the group was founded in 1982 by James Roosevelt, a
former congressman and the eldest son of Franklin D. Roosevelt, to
be a grass-roots organization watching out for Social Security.
   Moynihan, however, questioned whether the idea for the group
originated with a direct-mail outfit that wanted a new source of
business and recruited Roosevelt to serve as a consultant.
   Heinz acknowledged that the group's mailings include a
disclaimer of government affiliation, but said it is difficult to
read the ``fly speck'' print.

   A bus crowded with vacationers
returning from a popular beach resort veered off a road before dawn
and tumbled down a ravine, killing 23 people and injuring at least
23 others, authorities said Monday.
   Among those killed in the accident near Guatire, just outside
Caracas, were two children, two women and an army corporal, the
official news agency Venpres said.
   It was unclear how many people were on the Unconay company bus,
which was en route from the resort of Puerto La Cruz, about 130
miles east of this capital, to Caracas when the accident occurred
shortly after midnight.
   According to officials at the site, the driver may have fallen
asleep at the wheel.
   Firefighters and Civil Defense volunteers labored for hours to
rescue the injured and free bodies from the twisted wreckage at the
bottom of a deep ravine. Most of the injured were transferred by
ambulance or helicopter to Caracas.
   The Transport and Communications Ministry ordered an immediate
investigation into the accident.

   Romania has closed its border with
Yugoslavia and turned back all travelers, the Tanjug news agency
reported Monday.
   Yugoslav companies that have offices in Bucharest, Romania's
capital, were officially informed their staff would not be allowed
to enter Romania during the Communist Party congress that opened
Monday, Tanjug said.
   Sunday's move came without warning, Tanjug said.
   All tourists arriving at the border from Yugoslavia were turned
back without any explanation, the news agency reported.
   On Sunday, the Romanian foreign ministry barred Dragoslav
Markovic, a Tanjug correspondent who specialized in Romanian
affairs, from traveling to Bucharest to report on the congress.
Other journalists were held up for several hours at the border by
Romanian police.
   Hungarian state radio reported Friday that Romania severely
curbed border-crossing traffic but restrictions were reportedly
relaxed somewhat by Sunday.

spokeswoman said Monday.
   The Rev. John G. McGreevy, vice president for institutional

   But Ann Manchester-Molak of Providence College said McGreevy met
Walesa only briefly and did not get a chance to present him the

   ```He did get to meet him, but he was taken away so quickly he
didn't get a chance to do it,'' said Manchester.
   Walesa flew to Venezuela on Monday after a weeklong visit in the

<HEAD>Panel Will Subpoena Records of White House Deliberations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A House panel, seeking to determine whether
political pressure scuttled a major Agent Orange study, voted
Monday to subpoena records of White House deliberations on the
issue during the Reagan administration.
   Members of the human resources and intergovernmental relations
subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee voted
unanimously to authorize the subpoena.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., the chairman of the panel, said he would
not seek to serve the subpoena before next week while the panel
negotiates with the White House counsel's office for the release of
the documents.
   The panel is seeking minutes of meetings of the White House
Domestic Policy Council Working Group on Agent Orange for the eight
years of the Reagan administration.
   The committee is investigating why a federal Centers for Disease
Control scientific study of Agent Orange exposure among veterans of
the Vietnam War was cancelled. Weiss said the study was ``either
botched or rigged.'' He said he wants to see if the records reveal
whether White House policymakers had the study halted.
   At a hearing before the panel in July, Dr. Vernon N. Houk of the
CDC denied there was any political interverence. Houk was chairman
of a scientific panel of the working group.
   Houk said the study was abandoned in 1986 because the CDC
couldn't find the right data to develop a valid method to study the
health effects of the defoliant.
   But several other scientists, including a former CDC researcher,
Dr. Dennis M. Smith, testified that the needed information,
including details of troop movements, was available from the
Defense Department's Environmental Study Group.
   Many Vietnam veterans contend that they have developed cancer or
other ailments, and that their children have a high incidence of
birth defects, because of their exposure to Agent Orange, a toxic
chemical used to clear dense jungle during the war. There are
34,000 veterans seeking government benefits as a result of
disabilities they say were caused by Agent Orange.

<TEXT>
   Nicolae Ceausescu rejected the reform
sweeping Eastern Europe and said Monday the land he rules like a
feudal lord will stick to its rigid Marxist course. Thousands of
supporters cheered and applauded on cue.
   Romania's president and Communist party chief implied treason on
the part of radical reformers in the Soviet bloc. ``They used their
leadership position not for the people, but to change the system,''
he declared at the opening of the 14th Communist Party Congress,
his voice rising with emotion.
   Ceausescu used no names, but his remark seemed to be directed at
party leaders in Poland and Hungary, which have turned toward
democracy and free-market economies.
   It is said that he urged the Warsaw Pact to consider invading
Poland, but the reports have not been confirmed.
   The Romanian leader, a maverick who refused to follow the
Soviets in breaking relations with Israel in 1967, would not join
the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and has an independent
foreign policy, left no doubt Monday that he does not agree with
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's more liberal Kremlin.
   In Romania, he said, there will be ``still more powerful growth
of the party's leading role,'' and the state's already pervasive
presence ``will even grow in the organization and management'' of
the nation.
   ``The party cannot give up its revolutionary responsibility,''
he told more than 3,000 delegates in Palace Hall. ``It cannot
surrender its historical mission to another force.''
   His clear reference was to reform in the Soviet Union, radical
change in Poland and Hungary and the fall of orthodox Communist
regimes in East Germany and Bulgaria.
   Romania is a regular target at international human rights
meetings for suppressing dissent and restricting religious freedom.
Adding to the misery of the nation's 23 million people are years of
shortages that have led to poorly stocked grocery stores, cold
apartments and cars without gasoline.
   To protest Ceausescu's human rights record, ambassadors of all
NATO countries except Turkey stayed away from opening day of the
congress.
   The U.S. Embassy issued a statement saying it was not
represented because ``attendance of any of the activities would be
inconsistent with the depth of U.S. concern over the human rights
situation in Romania, for which the Romanian Communist Party bears
responsibility.''
   Also missing for the first time was a party delegation from
Hungary, which is at odds with Romania over alleged mistreatment of
this country's Hungarian minority.
   Ceausescu spoke for more than five hours, to orchestrated shows
of affection by the delegates.
   When their 71-year-old leader invoked Romania's determination to
defend its independence or praised the Communist Party, the
delegates rose as one to chant, ``Romania! Communism! Ceausescu!
Heroism!'' or ``Ceausescu, Romania and the Romanian Communist
Party!''
   Delegates clapped in unison during these outbursts, some of
which lasted nearly a minute. At a wave from Ceausescu, who has
been in power 24 years, they stopped abruptly and sat down.
   His wife, Elena, and son, Nicu, both senior party officials,
gazed stolidly from a stage full of ranking functionaries as
Ceausescu exhorted the party's 3.8 million members to build
communism.
   Despite criticizing the liberalization elsewhere in Eastern
Europe, Ceausescu said Romania would continue in the Warsaw Pact
and the Comecon economic alliance.
   Ceausescu appeared to indicate a change in past policy of
unilateral military cuts by saying Romania would give ``full heed
to the continuous strengthening of the country's defense
capability.''
   Delegates rose in protracted demonstrations of support when
Ceausescu mentioned Romania's intention to defend its
soverereignty, which he did at least 10 times.
   Hopes rose in Romania that food and fuel supplies would improve
after Ceausescu announced last spring that the multibillion-dollar
foreign debt had been paid off.
   Improvement has been slow, however, and Western diplomats said
an important reason was depleted stockpiles from years of producing
for export to pay the debt.

<TEXT>
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney told his
Soviet counterpart Monday the Kremlin can count on the cooperation
of its Arctic neighbor in carrying out its perestroika reform
program.
   Mulroney delivered that message to Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov on
the first day of the Canadian leader's six-day visit, said Soviet
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov.
   Gerasimov noted that 240 Canadian business representatives had
arrived in Moscow along with Mulroney, and that for the Soviets, it
was clear ``we can count on the cooperation of business circles of
Canada'' in carrying out perestroika, the overhaul of society
undertaken by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 4{ years ago.
   Mulroney, the first Canadian prime minister to make an official
visit to Moscow since 1971, signed a dozen agreements with Ryzhkov
after their talks. They include accords on preserving the
environment of the vast Arctic, protecting Canadian businesses'
capital investments in the Soviet Union, preventing marine
pollution in the Arctic, preventing drug abuse and trafficking and
promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy, Gerasimov said.
   Mulroney is scheduled to meet Tuesday with Gorbachev, whom he
has called a ``genuine reformer,'' and Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze.
   In addition, he will help inaugurate the Canada-U.S.S.R.
Business Council, whose members are hoping to conclude deals with
the Soviets during the visit.
   In an interview with Izvestia, Mulroney said the investments
planned by business leaders will total more than $850,000 and that
figure could increase.
   Gerasimov noted that so far, trade has been largely one-sided,
with the Soviet Union buying wheat from Canada and exporting very
little.
   ``Canada's approach to trade contacts with the Soviet Union,
unlike that of Italy and the Federal Republic of Germany, has been
politicized to such an extent that Ottawa at times turns out to be
rather overzealous in abiding by various kinds of trade
restrictions and often outperforms its southern neighbor (the
United States) in this respect,'' Tass said.
   ``The number of Canadian firms' offices in Moscow can be counted
on a pair of hands. The number of Soviet-Canadian joint ventures is
also small.''
   Mulroney arrived from Sweden, where he said Gorbachev is a
``genuine reformer ... and should be supported.''
   ``Clearly, this man has taken his part of the world down a brand
new path,'' he said.

   Agricultural reforms undertaken by Moscow are
not likely to affect the Soviet Union's grain import requirements
for at least the next few years, an Agriculture Department report
said Monday.
   The United States and the Soviet Union are scheduled to begin
talks in Moscow next month on a new long-term grain supply
agreement.
   ``With stocks of most U.S. grains down, markets are extremely
sensitive to speculation about Soviet purchases,'' the department's
Economic Research Service said in a new outlook report.
   For Moscow, the agency said, the grain discussions ``come at a
politically delicate time'' as Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
attempts to reform Soviet agriculture while striving to restructure
the government.
   ``While the success of the reforms remains to be seen, they
likely will not seriously affect the total amount of grain the
U.S.S.R. needs to purchase on international markets for the next
several years,'' the report said.
   The agency said U.S. retail food prices for 1989 are up nearly 6
percent from 1988, the largest rise since 1981. Last year's food
price increase was 4.1 percent, and the 6 percent rise for 1989 had
been forecast for some time.
   Looking to 1990, the report said normal crop production and a
slower growth in consumers' disposable income ``will mean slower
increases in food prices'' than in 1989.
   An official forecast of 1990 food prices will be released next
week at the department's annual outlook conference. Some USDA
economists think next year's prices may be held to a gain of 4
percent to 6 percent, given normal weather during the growing
season.

   The K mart Corp. is voluntarily recalling

   K mart last week recalled 15,000 Ceramic Potpourri Houses
because the tealight candle sold with them burns too hot and poses
a risk of fire, the agency said.
   There have been at least 12 incidents since June where the
houses caught fire, resulting in minor property damage. There have
been no reported injuries, the company said.
   Consumers should return the houses, numbered 32-67-47, to any K
mart store for a full refund or replacement of either the houses or
the candle.

   A 4-year-old Connecticut boy is just one
victim of a barrage of potentially dangerous toys that will bombard
parents looking for perfect toys as holiday gifts for children, a
consumer group said Monday.
   ``We think that it's a more dangerous situation this year than
we've remembered in our 18 years of toy surveying,'' Ann Brown,
chairwoman of the Consumer Affairs Committee of Americans for
Democratic Action, said in releasing the group's annual toy safety
and quality report.
   Brown was joined by Judy Lavoie and her son, Greg, of Bethel,
Conn.
   Greg had two operations after perforating his eardrum with a
packing stick included with the Pepsi-Cola-Coca-Cola Delivery
Truck, listed by the consumer group as one of its most potentially
dangerous toys.
   Mrs. Lavoie said the manufacturer, New Jersey-based Buddy L
Corp., told her that the package clearly states the stick is a part
of the packaging and not the toy, but she displayed an unopened
model of the toy she said she bought over the weekend that didn't
include that information.
   The manufacturer temporarily suspended shipment of the trucks
after Greg's August 1988 accident and printed larger stickers
warning parents that the packing rod should be discarded, said
George Fink, Buddy L senior vice president.
   ``We did not feel that after shipping 750,000 of these units,
with one complaint that we had a dangerous toy,'' said Fink,
explaining why the company didn't recall the trucks already on the
market to include the warning sticker.
   ``Toy safety has become a contradiction in terms,'' according to
the consumer group's 135-page report that surveyed 51 toys.
   Brown blamed the influx of more dangerous toys on the
``powerlessness'' of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   ``The Consumer Product Safety Commission which has jurisdiction
over toys used to be just be a toothless tiger,'' she said. ``I'm
afraid the tiger has now fallen over dead.''
   Brown criticized the panel's lack of a quorum of three
commissioners since January. Early Saturday, the Senate confirmed
Jacqueline Jones-Smith as the third commissioner and chairwoman of
the panel.
   ``We will look into every product on that list ... and make a
determination as to whether any action is necessary,'' said CPSC
spokesman Dan Rumelt.
   The report cites CPSC statistics that estimate there were
142,000 toy-related injuries in 1988, an increase of 11,000 over
1987. Nursery product-related injuries to children under 5 totaled
72,000 in 1988.
   The ADA report, which previously cited only toys, this year
includes infant and children's products.
   The group cites 13 toys, a baker's ``dirty dozen'' of the most
potentially dangerous toys. It also recommends from among this
year's most heavily advertised toys 10 products for the ``toy box''
and an equal number for the ``trash box.''
   Bob Jacobs, president of Aqua Sling, whose water balloon sling
shot is among the group's dirty dozen, said most of the problems
associated with the product were related to user responsibility.
   ``We haven't had anybody hurt by the product. Everybody that's
had any problems with it has been with misuse of the product,''
said Jacobs, who runs the business from his California garage.
   Brown recommended that product be taken off the market,
describing an incident in which one of the balloons ``hit a kid in
the chest and caused temporary heart failure.''
   Also cited among the worst toys for the 1989 holiday season are
five toys with Walt Disney and Sesame Street character names,
including a Mickey's Pillow Friend cuddling cushion that Brown set
afire to show its flammability.
   ``There are stringent requirement's for children's sleepwear.
Why shouldn't there be for children's toys?'' Brown asked.
   ``We use outside labs and internal labs to assure the safety of
the toys,'' said Martin Scheman, president of Illco Toy Co., whose
Disney Babies and Sesame Street Crib and Playpen Toys were cited
because they come apart easily, leaving sharp edges that pose a
hazard.
   The report outlined several categories of potentially dangerous
toys, including:
   _Items that explode to make loud noises, which can damage ears
or cause hearing loss.
   _Projectiles that use guns or rubber devices.
   _Toys that invite eating, which young children will do ``whether
edible or not.''
   _Inexpensive checkout counter toys that encourage impulse buying.
   _Novelty items that aren't toys but are sold in toy stores.
   _Toys with inadequate or misleading age labels. In some cases
manufacturers label toys ``not for children under 3'' when they are
intended to appeal to exactly that age group.
   _Items children take to bed with them that are flammable.
   _Poorly made licensed items with familiar childhood and cartoon
characters.

<HEAD>Soviet Lawmakers Give Preliminary OK to Emergency Economic Measure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The national legislature gave preliminary approval
Monday to an emergency economic package that imposes new price
controls and bans the export of scarce goods in a bid to stop the
slide in the Soviet standard of living.
   The official news agency Tass said the Supreme Soviet took the
action in an attempt to help retirees and other low-income groups
that are hard-pressed by price increases and the widespread
shortage of basic goods and supplies.
   The measure bans price increases for several commodities, as
well as clothes and shoes, and places a quota on the export of such
scarce items as fish products, fur and electric appliances.
   Tass said many Soviet businesses have been exporting these
items, rather than make them available to the domestic economy, in
order to obtain coveted foreign currency.
   The measure, which is to be presented to the 2,250-member
Congress of People's Deputies during next session, which begins
Dec. 12, also enables the state to order production of inexpensive
items for retirees and children that businesses have stopped
manufacturing because they are not profitable.
   Deputy Premier Leonid I. Abalkin, President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's chief economist, proposed the measures a week after a
conference of academics and economic managers recommended
longer-term fixes for the Soviet economy. The conference suggested
measured price increases, dumping unprofitable state businesses,
expanding forms of ownership and development of a stock market.

   NBC News, finding the use of news recreations in
its ``Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow'' specials too confusing to
viewers, said Monday it won't use the technique anymore. It won't
keep the show, either.
   No NBC News staff members will continue on the show, including
its anchor team of Mary Alice Williams, Maria Shriver and Chuck
Scarborough, said Tom Ross, a senior vice president at NBC News.
   Three YTT specials have aired, the first on Aug. 2. A fourth,
made by NBC News and with a news event re-enactment by actors, will
air on Nov. 28. After that, NBC said, the YTT concept will go to
NBC Entertainment for further development.
   Once considered a candidate to be NBC's only prime time news
series, YTT was the only NBC News show on which recreations were
used. CBS News' low-rated ``Saturday Night With Connie Chung''
series still uses them. No ABC News series does or will, ABC News
president Roone Arledge has said.
   NBC News president Michael Gartner, asked if the use of news
recreations in network news programs is on the way out, had a
prompt reply.
   ``It is at NBC,'' he said. ``It was an experiment. We're proud
of what we did. For reasons of clarity, however, we won't be doing
them any longer.''
   Those who use recreations on the CBS and NBC programs defend
them as accurate and well-sourced. But the technique, which dates
to network radio days, has been criticized in recent months by such
traditionalists as former CBS News president Richard Salant.
   They argue that news recreations, among other things, confuse
viewers about what is real and what is recreated with actors
playing actual people.
   The YTT recreations, while overseen by NBC News, were made in
Los Angeles by Cosgrove-Meurer Productions, which makes the NBC
entertainment series ``Unsolved Mysteries.''
   In a statement announcing the change, Gartner agreed with the
critics' contentions, saying that ``we have determined that the
practice can result in confusion to the viewers.''
   He also said YTT experimented with other new techniques that may
be incorporated in the new prime-time news series that Jane Pauley
will anchor next summer. Pauley is leaving as ``Today'' co-anchor
in January.
   In an interview, Gartner said that while all of YTT's
recreations were done responsibly, ``there still seemed to be some
confusion ... everytime you said `recreation,' it sort of set off a
little alarm in the viewer's mind.
   ``So I decided that the only way that NBC could deal with it is
to just say, `There are no recreations on NBC (News).' And that
removes all doubt and confusion.''
   ``Well, hooray ... this is good news,'' Salant said of Gartner's
decision.
   CBS News spokesman Tom Goodman said there was no truth to
reports Chung's CBS show would drop news recreations.
   ``We're doing a mix of features, interviews, and segments with
reconstructions,'' Goodman said. ``We'll continue to do them
(recreations) and other things as well.''
   Saturday's Chung show has no news recreations, he said. Of nine
shows broadcast to date, three had no recreations, four had
recreation segments, and two consisted entirely of a recreated news
story, he said.
   Everette Dennis, executive director of the Gannett Center for
Media Studies, has said he's not disturbed by responsible network
news recreations. He expressed reservations Monday about NBC's
decision to drop them.
   ``I would frankly rather have seen recreations develop and
mature as a legitimate news tool, rather than simply be relegated
back to the entertainment division,'' he said.

   An American physician who was arrested and
held overnight in connection with her work at a Lutheran Church
clinic in San Salvador said Monday her ordeal ``was nothing
compared to what the Salvadoran people have suffered.''
   Asked at a news conference whether she would return to El
Salvador after her experience in the country's capital last week,
Dr. Paula Brentlinger said, ``Until conditions exist that would
permit me to work as a physician, I am not sure what the point
would be.''
   ``If I were to go back now, I think I'd be in hiding with a lot
of other people because it was made very clear to me that I would
not be permitted ... to work,'' the family doctor from Seattle said.
   She was detained along with 11 foreign health professionals and
lay church workers and three Salvadorans last Thursday. They were
taken to Treasury Police headquarters, where they were questioned,
held overnight and then released.
   ``The sick and wounded still lie unattended in the battle zones
of the capital,'' she said. ``The Geneva Conventions _ despite the
pleas of the Red Cross, the churches, and even the guerrilla forces
_ are not being respected. What I went through was nothing compared
to what the Salvadoran people have suffered in the last ten years,
and ten days, of the war.''
   The doctor, who said she was raised as a congregationalist, has
worked periodically since 1986 as a volunteer physician with the
Lutheran Church of El Salvador. Since September, she has been
treating patients at several sites in San Salvador. Before that,
she was with the Pacific Medical Center in Seattle.
   Physicians for Human Rights, an organization of health
professionals that sponsored her press conference here, said she
was returning to Seattle to continue her practice of medicine.
   The doctor gave this account of her arrest:
   ``At around 4 p.m. on Nov. 16, as I was preparing to examine a
woman in labor, armed and uniformed members of the Salvadoran
National Guard came into the building in which we were working.
They demanded to see the passports of all the foreigners in the
building. After we handed over our documents, the guardsmen loaded
us into a pickup truck and took us to their headqaurters.''
   She said they were blindfolded and driven somewhere within the
police headquarters, where they were handcuffed.
   ``Treasury policemen shouted to each other that we were the
foreigners who had been providing medical attention to wounded
guerrilla combatants,'' she said. ``I was eventually taken from my
cell _ where I had been forced to stand, blindfolded and handcuffed
_ by a Treasury policeman who partly removed my blindfold and then
yelled in my ear that I should tell him how many guerrillas I had
taken care of at the Lutheran clinic.''
   The doctor, who told reporters that the clinic did not ask for
the political affiliation of patients and would treat the wounded
of either side, said she was attempting to answer this question
when another policeman entered the room, asked her name and told
her interrogator to remove the handcuffs.
   ``At this point the interrogation became fairly courteous, and
my blindfold and handcuffs were removed,'' she said. ``I spend most
of the night alone in a cell.''
   Late the next morning, the U.S. citizens in the group were
released to representatives of the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador.

   One million silver dollars would be minted to
commemorate 100 years of statehood for Idaho, Montana, Washington,
Wyoming and the Dakotas, under legislation approved Monday by the
House.
   A similar measure already passed the Senate. Differences between
the two bills will be worked out by a conference committee.
   ``In the minting of this coin, we are recognizing the importance
of silver to all the states involved, both historically and
economically,'' said Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., before the House
passed on voice vote the bill he co-sponsored.
   The six states entered the union in 1889 and 1890.
   Williams noted that one of the largest silver deposits ever
discovered was in Montana.
   ``The centennial coins and silver proof sets will also provide a
helpful boost to the regional mining recovery now under way,'' said
Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, who also co-sponsored the measure.
   The coins will contain 90 percent silver and 10 percent alloy.
Each coin will be sold for $20 to $25.
   The bill also authorizes production of a mint set that would be
more than 99 percent silver.
   The House's original bill called for the minting of 350,000
five-dollar palladium coins, but the scarcity of the precious metal
caused the body to drop that provision before passing the measure.
   Further study is being conducted, however, and Williams said the
conference committee might find a way to include the minting of
some palladium coins in the legislation.
   A five-dollar palladium coin would be sold for more than $300,
an aide to Williams estimated.
   The secretary of the treasury would decide on the design for the
coins after consultation with the Commission on Fine Arts,
according to the bill.
   Profits from selling the coins would help reduce the national
debt and to pay for a traveling exhibit of historic documents
relating to each state's course toward statehood.
   The coins would be sold by the Treasury Department at outlets,
mostly banks, throughout the country.

<HEAD>NASA Team Proposes Return To Moon And Man On Mars</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A NASA team has fleshed out President Bush's
visions of American outposts on the moon and Mars with a script
that would have four humans arriving on the red planet in 2011, and
returning for a 600-day stay in 2018.
   The study, delivered to the National Space Council, does not
contain any estimates of cost, but Director Richard Darman of the
Office of Management and Budget has put the price tag of going to
Mars in the $400 billion range.
   The report envisions space station Freedom, which is scheduled
to be completed in 1999, becoming ``a transportation node where
both lunar and Mars vehicles will be assembled, tested, launched
and refurbished to fly again.''
   The report was commissioned by NASA administrator Richard Truly
to provide a database for the National Space Council as it
considers approaches for meeting the president's goals.
   ``We will not stop at the moon,'' the report said, ``because the
imperative to explore will lead men and women to Mars. The planet
most like earth, Mars offers many unique scientific opportunities,
but perhaps the most intriguing question is whether life exeists or
has ever existed on Mars.''
   Life may exist on Mars today, the study said, ``in underground
habitats where volcanic heating melts ground ice, producing a warm,
wet environment protected from harsh surface conditions.''
   Five approaches for meeting Bush's goals are laid out.
   Approach A would establish a human presence on the moon in 2001,
permanently occupying it in 2002 and leveling off development of
the outpost in 2012 in order to finance start of a Mars expedition,
arriving in 2016.
   Approach B would delay some of the science activities on both
moon and Mars in order to advance the Martian arrival to 2011.
   Approaches C and D would alter the timelines somewhat, the
latter delaying milestones by 2 to 3 years.
   Under Approach E, activities on the moon would be cut back to
only one mission a year. Humans would return to the moon, one
flight a year beginning in 2004, for tours of duty ranging from 30
days to 6 months. In this scenario, the first crew of four would
arrive on Mars in 2016.
   Any such large-scale endeavors, the report says, requires launch
vehicles with much greater capacity to lift heavy payloads:
``approximately 60 metric tons (132,000 pounds) for the lunar
outpost, and about 140 metric tons (309,000 pounds) for the Mars
outpost.
   The shuttle's cargo capacity, ordered to be lowered as one
result of the Challenger accident, is 38,000 pounds.
   The report said its planning for human exploration of the solar
system has concentrated on use of high performance engines and a
technique called aerobraking where the atmosphere of planet is used
to decelerate a spacecraft and change its trajectory.
   The study recommends consideringh nuclear propulsion as a major
alternative.
   ``No significant United States program is investigating the
potential of nuclear thermal rocket propulsion for exploration
missions,'' the report said. ``Facilities for testing nuclear
thermal rocket systems is a major issue that must be resolved in
order to make development of this extremely effective technology
possible.''

<TEXT>
   The State Department on Monday canceled a
visit by a high-level official from Czechoslovakia and condemned
the use of force by police against peaceful demonstrators in Prague.
   ``We're disappointed,'' Richard Schifter, the head of the
department's human rights office, told Ambassador Miroslav
Houstecky, who was handed a 600-word statement of sharp U.S.
disapproval.
   Earlier, Margaret D. Tutwiler, the department's spokeswoman,
said the police actions were ``in sharp contrast to other East
European countries who are beginning to respond to the wishes of
their people.''
   She said authorities in Prague had damaged Czechoslovakia's
credibility at home and abroad.
   Ambassador Houstecky was simultanteously called to Schifter's
office to receive an official protest. While he probably assumed it
was coming, the envoy apparently was taken by surprise by the
cancellation of a planned visit by Jan Fojtik, the Czechoslovakian
Communist Party ideology chief.
   His visit later this month was to mark a general improvement in
U.S. relations with the communist government. Secretary of State
James A. Baker III met in September in New York with Foreign
Minister Jaromir Johanes. It was the first session at that high a
level in 11 years. Lower-level officials subsequently held other
meetings.
   Schifter reminded Houstecky that Czechoslovakia's poor human
rights record was the major barrier between the two countries and
that ``we were going to engage at high levels to overcome that
barrier,'' Nat Kingsley, a department press officer, said.
   ``Because of of recent violent attacks, we are canceling the
invitation,'' the U.S. human rights chief said. ``The
Czechoslovakian government has totally ignored the basic thrust of
the dialogue begun in a sincere atmosphere in New York.''
   The ambassador did not respond directly, although he was clearly
aware of what was going on in Prague, Kingsley said. ``He talked
about a need to move forward without chaos,'' the U.S. official
said.
   The protest statement said the Czechoslovakian government ``has
made a mockery'' of the dialogue begun in New York. ``We are even
more disappointed that the Czechoslovak government has demonstrated
so violently its unwillingness to address its citizens' hopes for
democracy,'' it said.
   Ending on a hopeful note, the statement said, ``For the sake of
the people of Czechoslovakia, who have known democracy and freedom
and who have suffered so obviously, the United States government
hopes the government of Czechoslovakia will promptly reconsider its
policies. ...'

   The vice chief of Naval Operations said Monday
that the recent series of Navy accidents that have claimed nine
lives since late October has affected recruiting.
   ``If I was a parent, I would be concerned by what I read in the
headlines in the papers,'' Adm. Leon A. Edney told a House Armed
Services subcommittee hearing on whether a connection exists among
the spate of deadly accidents.
   The rash of accidents prompted the Navy last week to order an
unprecedented stand-down from most routine training to allow a
review of basic safety and operating procedures.
   Edney said the stand-down, which requires ships, air squadrons
and shore installations to interrupt normal operations and conduct
the review for a 48-hour period, won't be completed until Wednesday.
   ``It will be some two to three weeks before we know what lessons
we've learned,'' Edney told two subcommittees _ military personnel
and compensation, and seapower and strategic and critical
materials. ``It's too early to have a report.''
   Since Oct. 29, nine people have been killed or lost at sea and
at least 45 people injured.
   The Navy counted 101 ``operation and training related''
fatalities between Jan. 1 and Nov. 1, including the explosion
aboard the USS Iowa April 19 that killed 47 sailors.
   Questioned by lawmakers as to whether the accidents have had an
impact on recruiting, Edney said, ``I think it all has an effect.''
   He provided no specifics.
   ``Certainly there's no question that when you've got a young man
or woman coming into the service, which is the most precious thing
that you own, you're concerned about those things,'' Edney said in
reference to a parent's response to the accidents.
   Complicating the situation would be if a parent has ``a
perception that an institution is not doing its job thoroughly
enough or takes a cavalier attitude or is a little bit complacent
on safety. It'll affect retention and recruiting and it should.
   ``That's why we're doing everything in our power. We're giving
it our best shot,'' Edney said.
   The admiral reiterated the Navy's contention that there is no
central thread to all the accidents. He said the quality of the
personnel remains excellent and disputed claims that the tempo
operations are too intense for most seamen.
   ``The tempo of operations has not increased in the last four to
five years,'' Edney said.
   Budget cuts have had some effect, but not on training for the
Navy.
   ``We don't reduce their training when the money gets short. We
reduce the number of people we put through,'' Edney said.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, spurred by
reforms in Eastern Europe and fiscal pressures at home, on Monday
analyzed ``worst-case scenario'' budget cuts that could include a
$20 billion slash in projected spending for the 1991 fiscal year,
sources said.
   Cheney, in more than four hours of conferences with the
Pentagon's civilian leadership, the chiefs of the Army, Navy and
Air Force, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Colin Powell, also
reviewed the military's suggestions for dealing with his orders to
cut spending by $180 billion between 1992-'94, other sources said.
   The long-range cutbacks are thought to be the most painful
considered by Pentagon leaders since the end of the Vietnam War.
   They envision possibly closing as many as 15 Air Force bases;
cutting back five Air Force fighter wings; stretching out the
purchase of the B-2 stealth bomber; mothballing the Navy's four
battleships and at least two carriers; and eliminating up to four
Army divisions, said one Pentagon official who spoke privately.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Cheney had not made any
decisions about the reported suggestions.
   ``This is a worst-case scenario,'' Williams said, adding that
the secretary wants the services to conduct the ``budget exercise''
to be ready to respond, given the changes occurring under Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev and the budget pressures of the nation's
deficit.
   ``In a dynamic era, you have to have a dynamic process and plan
accordingly,'' Williams said.
   ``There is real pain when you cut the defense budget,'' he said.
``The question is, how much pain can you take and still ensure the
nation's security?''
   Over the weekend, Congress approved a $286 billion defense
budget for the 1990 fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   Another senior Pentagon official, who spoke on condition he not
be identified by name, said Cheney is negotiating with Budget
Director Richard Darmen on plans for a possible spending cut for
the 1991 fiscal year, or about $20 billion in cuts from the
projected $317 billion _ a revised figured settled on earlier this
year that takes inflation into account.
   ``It could be that bad,'' the official said. ``It could be, that
we have to cut that much.''
   The Pentagon expects to have its 1991 spending projection
submitted to the Office of Management and Budget by Dec. 8, the
official said.
   Cheney ordered the armed services last week to come up with the
$180 billion in spending cuts, but didn't direct how the cuts
should be made.
   The service chiefs reported back to him Monday with details
about how they would function in the coming years if such cuts had
to be made, another Pentagon official said.
   ``These are very significant cuts that we are talking about _
and Congress is going to have to be made aware that there is a
price to be paid when we talk about a smaller defense budget. This
is going to affect the folks here and the folks out there'' in the
various states, the official said.
   In a rare confluence of budget planning discussions, Williams
said, Pentagon officials are juggling questions dealing with budget
uncertainties for the current fiscal year, demands to produce
budget plans for the upcoming fiscal year by early December and at
the same time produce long-term budget projections for up to 1994.
   Williams said it was clear to the Pentagon leadership that
President Bush's earlier projections for 1 percent spending
increases for fiscal 1991 and 1992, followed by 2 percent increases
in 1993 and 1994 aren't realistic anymore.
   ``We know we won't get $317 billion for 1991. But if we sat
here, dumb, fat and happpy, and didn't plan for the future, and
went along as if nothing had changed, Congress would be howling,
`Don't they see the deficit? Don't they see the world has changed?'
The message has gone out _ we are looking for realistic goals,''
Williams said.
   Cheney has ``no intention of going up to Capitol Hill and having
his budget thrown back in his face,'' Williams said. ``This is
going to be a very painful process for everyone.''
   Williams denied that if the Pentagon plans for budget cuts it
might weaken Bush's hand at the upcoming summit with Gorbachev.
   ``This is a planning process, and we have to take a long look
down the road,'' he said.
   ``We won't do anything unilaterally, and a whole lot `ifs' must
be answered. These things can happen _ if the conventional force
talks in Vienna are successful, if the strategic arms talks are
successful, if the Soviets stop their meddling in the Third World.''

<HEAD>DOE Says Project Still On Track Despite `Conceptual Flaw'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The superconducting super collider will still
meet its original standards and $5.9 billion price tag despite a
``conceptual flaw,'' a high-ranking Energy Department official told
members of Congress on Monday.
   Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore said DOE has no plans to
move the collider from Texas, contrary to a published report that
suggested a change in the design could result in a smaller, less
powerful collider that would be unsuitable for its chosen site at
Waxahachie.
   ``As far as we're concerned, nothing's changed,'' Moore said in
an interview. ``We have no official reports, requests, proposals
any different than we're going to build the super collider right
there in Texas for $5.9 billion.''
   The Washington Post on Sunday quoted unnamed U.S. officials and
private scientists who suggested that making extensive
modifications in the plans could reopen the battle for the particle
accelerator by allowing other states to argue that Waxahachie is no
longer the ideal site.
   Moore said information in the story was provided from people who
``are angry because we told them there aren't going to be any cost
overruns on this project.
   ``They're people who ... want to take a house we had designed to
build and add a swimming pool to it and add all kind of extras to
it, and thought they could get it through in the name of science,''
Moore said.
   The contractor is to provide the Energy Department by December
with recommendations for any technical modifications to the
collider's conceptual plan, Moore said, adding that he sees
``nothing new, nothing different, nothing holding anything up.''
   ``We've simply told them (scientists working on the SSC), (to)
make whatever changes you want to; it just can't cost over $5.9
billion. And it also has to achieve the standards set for it
originally.''
   Congress recently approved the first $225 million to build the
collider over an eight-year period. The site south of Dallas was
chosen in November 1988 after a lengthy selection process involving
many states.
   As planned, the collider would be a 53-mile underground oval
where atomic particles would be hurled at each other by
superconducting magnets. Scientists would force the particles to
collide in an attempt to break them down further to test theories
about the building blocks of the universe.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, met with Moore on Monday and said that
the problem is with the size of the mechanism that would inject
proton beams into the underground ring, and that it was initially
believed that the injector could be the same size as the one used
at the Fermilab outside Chicago.
   Because the super collider would be 10 times as powerful as the
Fermilab accelerator, however, scientists believe the injector
should be enlarged, Gramm said.
   ``With a 53-mile machine, you have got to have more power to
start the particle around the track,'' Gramm said.
   Gramm said DOE would come up with various options and its
preferred choice for dealing with the injector problem, which he
called a ``conceptual flaw,'' in early January.

   The House on Monday sent President Bush
restrictions on companies that provide pornographic telephone
services, restoring sanctions that the Supreme Court struck down in
June.
   The limitations on the $2 billion-a-year dial-a-porn industry
were included in a $156.7 billion measure for this year's health
and welfare programs that lawmakers dispatched to the White House
on a voice vote.
   The bill lacked a provision included in the original version of
the legislation making the first major expansion of federal
abortion rules in nine years. It would have permitted the use of
government revenues for abortions for poor women who are victims of
rape or incest.
   That language prompted a veto by Bush on Oct. 21, which the
House failed to override four days later. Abortion rights
supporters, realizing they lacked backing from two-thirds of
Congress to override another veto, gave up their fight last week.
   A 1988 law prohibited ``obscene or indecent'' telephone
communications for commercial reasons. Five months ago, the high
court ruled that obscene messages could be banned, but not indecent
ones.
   The legislation approved Monday prohibits obscene telephone
communications for commercial purposes. It also requires telephone
companies to block access to dial-a-porn services unless a customer
has asked for it.
   The overall spending bill also contains $4.7 billion for
employment and training programs, more than $1.5 billion for AIDS
research and treatment, and $5.4 billion to help elementary and
secondary school students from low-income families.
   The spending bill had bounced back and forth between the House
and Senate over the last week as the two chambers disputed various
provisions of the bill.
   The last disagreement was settled Monday when House members
agreed to a Senate provision blocking a $15 million reduction the
government wanted to make in reimbursements to rural hospitals.

<HEAD>After 10 Years of Study U.N. Adopts Child Rights Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children have the inalienable right to
grow up in a healthy environment free from abuse or exploitation,
the General Assembly declared Monday in unanimously adopting a
Convention on the Rights of the Child.
   Consideration of the convention, which combines scores of
international laws, began 10 years ago. Over the past decade U.N.
delegates debated such divisive issues as abortion, the age for
military recruits and adoption.
   ``For children, this is the Magna Carta,'' said James Grant,
executive director of the U.N. Children's Fund.
   With more than 100 children watching from the galleries,
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said it was ``the most
important step toward realizing our common purpose of promoting and
encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedom for
all.''
   The U.N. Children's Fund and many governments and private
agencies said the convention sets new standards that they can use
to fight child abuse, including neglect and sexual exploitation.
   ``It sets universally accepted standards to protect almost half
of the world's population,'' said Jan Martenson, the
undersecretary-general for human rights.
   The agreement is vague on some contentious issues.
   A clause on abortion, stated only in the non-binding preamble,
says children deserve special protection ``before as well as after
birth.''
   The convention sets the end of childhood at age 18, but does not
say whether childhood begins at birth or at some earlier time. The
United States supported the phrase dealing with the rights of the
unborn.
   There were strong arguments among the 159 U.N. members over the
provision that sets the minimum age for military recruitment at 15.
America accepted that section but most Western nations wanted the
legal draft age set at 17 or 18.
   It is estimated more than 95,000 child-soldiers lost their lives
in the Iran-Iraq war and 200,000 youngsters aged 15 to 17 are
serving in armed forces today.
   Norway, Sweden, France, West Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia,
Canada, Mexico and other nations wanted the draft age raised to at
least 17, and the Soviet Union was willing to agree with that
standard.
   The United States, however, supported the draft age of 15 on
grounds that the 1949 Geneva Conventions on warfare specify that
age and the new convention should conform to those agreements.
   Jordan and Algeria said they would not be bound by the clause
dealing with regulating adoptions because Islamic law already
guarantees the protection of children. Iran said it would not
comply with any provisions inconsistent with Islamic law.
   Adoption of the new convention came on the 30th anniversary of
the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, a statement of
principle that had no legally binding effect. The convention
combines more than 80 treaties and declarations drafted over the
last 60 years.
   When at least 20 nations ratify the convention it will become
binding on the ratifying nations.
   Last year the Soviet Union dropped its opposition to a provision
recognizing the right of children to free associaion, making
support for the convention unanimous among the 42 nations drafting
it.
   The convention guarantees a child the right to enjoy a family
life and extends international legal protection to adoption
procedures.
   It states that children cannot be separated from their parents,
except for the child's well-being, and declares children cannot be
sold into prostitution or slavery or exploited as bonded laborers
to pay off debts of the parents.
   But it allows the ratifying nations to set the minimum age for
child labor and regulate working conditions.
   Nations signing the convention will have to report periodically
to a new U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child.

   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, the chief
sponsor of a resolution commemorating the killing of hundreds of
thousands of Armenians early in this century, said Monday he was
putting off the issue until next year.
   But Dole said he would press early in 1990 for a vote on the
resolution and argued that it should not be as contentious a matter
as it has become. The resolution has become a flash point in U.S.
relations with Turkey, an important NATO ally and home to U.S.
military bases.
   The resolution ``shouldn't, and needn't, have any impact on
U.S.-Turkish relations,'' Dole said in a statement. ``The
resolution commemorates events long since past, perpetrated by
people long since dead, in an imperial state long since swept away
by history.''
   Publicly, President Bush has remained quiet on the issue, which
puts him in a politically uncomfortable position. As president, he
must maintain relations with Turkey, but as a candidate for
president, he recognized the claim of Armenian-Americans that their
people had been the victims of a systematic extermination by the
Ottoman Empire. Some 1.5 million Armenians were killed.
   Dole at one point had more than 60 co-sponsors for his
resolution, but a number of senators dropped their sponsorship
under pressure from the White House, leaving him with 47.

   James S. Benson, acting deputy commissioner of
the Food and Drug Administration, will serve as interim
commissioner when the agency's current chief leaves next month,
officials announced Monday.
   FDA Commissioner Frank Young is to leave the post Dec. 18 to
become a deputy assistant secretary for health in the Department of
Health and Human Services. FDA is also part of the department.
   HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan said Benson ``will assure
continuity and strong, professional leadership'' at FDA, which was
rocked earlier this year by a generic drug scandal that has led to
several bribery convictions and dozens of recalls.
   ``He will assure that the vigorous initiatives in progress under
Dr. Young will continue uninterrupted,'' while a search is
conducted for a permanent commissioner, Sullivan said.
   Benson, in a statement, said he was honored by the appointment,
adding, ``I shall do everything in my power to keep the FDA moving
forward.''
   Unlike Young and the commissioners before him who were appointed
by the department secretary, the next FDA chief will be appointed
by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The change was made
in a law passed by Congress last year.
   The FDA is the federal agency responsible for assuring the
safety of drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, radiological products
and most food products.

   More than 200,000 people chanting
``Freedom! Freedom!'' marched Monday night for free elections and
removal of the nation's Communist leaders.
   ADN, the official news agency, said 100,000 demonstrated in
Dresden, 50,000 each in Karl-Marx-Stadt and Halle; and 10,000 in
Schwerin.
   Activists backing New Forum and other opposition groups pressing
for more democratic change criticized what one speaker called the
``chaos'' wrought by 40 years of communism.
   Young and old braved freezing temperatures to attend the latest
of the now regular weekly rallies after prayer services in Leipzig,
the hotbed of protest in East Germany's recent turmoil.
   From a balcony at Leipzig's opera house, speakers denounced past
rigid practices and demanded justice from the leaders who
mishandled the economy.
   Hans-Joachim Schulz, who said he had no party affiliation, drew
cheers when he accused the ruling Communist Party of ``lying and
deceiving us'' and leading the country into catastrophe.
   ``It has lost the confidence of the people,'' Schulz said of the
party.
   He voiced skepticism about the Communists' new reformist image,
saying, ``a snake sheds its skin, but it doesn't change.''
   Another speaker criticized official corruption and the party's
steadfast refusal to bend to the reform wave until mass protests
and an exodus of East Germans to the West swelled to proportions
that could no longer be ignored.
   A speaker for New Forum called for a wholesale reform of
socialism and rejected calls for reunification with capitalist West
Germany.
   ``The fences and walls must fall, but we do not want to become
the poorhouse of greater Germany,'' said the speaker, who did not
give his name.
   The demonstrators observed a moment of silence in honor of the
Czechoslovak demonstrators brutally dispersed from pro-democracy
protests in Prague in recent days. About 100,000 again marched on
the Czechoslovak capital on Monday.
   East Germany's ADN news agency reported the Leipzig
demonstration and noted the calls for the Communists to step down.
   The agency also noted placards and banners calling on East
Germans to renounce black-market currency trades that further
damage the economy.
   One placard showed a Mercedes-Benz symbol with claws
figuratively reaching for East Germany, with the words ``No
thanks'' to the lure of the West.
   ``The whole world laughs at visas without money,'' declared
another.
   Heiko Brandt, a student, called for the resignation of the
government and said officials should be made to account for
mistakes ``with due severity.''

   The launch team was making up lost
hours Monday as a hush-hush countdown proceeded toward a
Thanksgiving Eve liftoff of space shuttle Discovery with five
astronauts and a secret spy satellite.
   Workers were several hours behind schedule when the countdown
started Sunday, but NASA reported Monday they were catching up,
doing the lagging work in parallel with other launch preparations.
   Following a three-hour launch readiness meeting Monday, shuttle
managers reported that while the schedule was tight, ``no major
issues are being worked'' and the launch remained on schedule.
   ``We're right on track for a Wednesday night launch; everything
is going fine,'' space agency spokeswoman Lisa Malone reported.
   She said shuttle officials expect all tasks to be on schedule by
late Tuesday.
   Workers had fallen behind in checking out systems and
reinstalling equipment and panels on the bottom sections of the two
solid fuel booster rockets. The panels were removed earlier in the
week so technicians could inspect computer boxes suspected of
having faulty wiring. One of the boxes was replaced.
   Because the mission is classified, NASA remained silent on the
exact status of the countdown. It has said only that liftoff is
scheduled between 7:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. and that it will make
the count public just nine minutes before the planned liftoff.
   There also will be a news blackout throughout the mission.
   It will be only the third after-dark launch in 32 shuttle
missions. The last one, in November 1985, was visible for several
hundred miles along the east coast, from Key West at the tip of the
Florida Keys to north Georgia.
   This is the fifth shuttle flight dedicated solely to the Defense
Department. Officials said the secrecy makes it more difficult for
Soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy ship sitting off Cape
Canaveral to track the shuttle.
   The astronauts assigned to the mission flew to Cape Canaveral on
Sunday from their training base in Houston. They slept during
daylight hours Monday to adjust their schedule to the hours they
will keep in space because of the nighttime launch.
   The commander is Air Force Col. Frederick C. Gregory, the first
black named to command a shuttle mission. The pilot is Air Force
Col. John Blaha, and the mission specialists are Navy Capt. Manley
L. Carter Jr., F. Story Musgrave and Kathryn C. Thornton.
   They are expected to stay in space for four days. Their main
task will be to deploy a satellite which sources close to the
project report will listen in on diplomatic and military
communications in the Soviet Union and other countries.

   A soldier in an elite infantry unit killed
himself after comrades beat him and put him through a mock trial in
his underwear, Israeli media reported Monday.
   An army psychologist blamed the death on failure to find a
political solution to the 23-month-old Palestinian uprising in the
occupied territories, which he said was increasing stress among
Israeli soldiers.
   In another suicide report, army sources said a female member of
a unit of settler soldiers tried to take her own life by shooting
herself in the stomach with a pistol in a Tel Aviv store.
   Hospital officials said the 19-year-old woman, whose name was
not released, was in fair condition. No further details were given.
   The suicide of 20-year-old Eli Shahar on Saturday was the second
in the Givati brigade recently. A Givati soldier assigned to the
occupied Gaza Strip shot himself to death two weeks ago.
   Suicides appear to be increasing in the army generally.
   On Monday, the military command said Monday 15 to 39 soldiers
have committed suicide in each of the last seven years, and 24
soldiers took their own lives from April through November 1989. It
did not give figures on suicide attempts.
   A report in the daily Yediot Ahronot said the army was
investigating a total of 45 reported suicides in 1989 and Israel
television put the number at more than 50.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, responding Monday to a question
in Parliament, denied suicide was on the rise in the military. He
said the army tries to prevent it by choosing draftees carefully
and training commanders to recognize signs of distress, Israel
radio reported.
   Dan Bar-On, a professor at Ben-Gurion University in Beersheba
who is a military psychologist in the reserves, said the army was
not equipped to deal with the stress of soldiers serving in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza.
   ``The army can deal with combat shock ... but I think it is not
prepared to see how the present state of stress is different from
the previous ones experienced by the Israeli soldiers,'' he said on
Israel television.
   ``Today, we have a situation of no exit ... and political
leaders who are supposed to offer an exit want to prolong this
situation, to put it mildly. Young people feel that nobody worries
about providing alternatives to the intefadeh,'' as the Palestinian
uprising is known.
   Col. Reuven Gal, formerly chief army psychologist, said
``exposure to events in the territories ... of course increases
pressure and maybe increases the tendency for violence and violent
reactions, but it does not necessarily lead to suicide.''
   An army spokesman confirmed the military was investigating the
case of Shahar, who newspapers said was having trouble with his
commanding officer.
   The daily Hamishmar said masked, older recruits awakened Shahar
on Saturday and carried him into a nearby tent, where they beat him
and threw soup in his face.
   Reports in Yediot and Maariv, two other newspapers, said a mock
trial followed at which Shahar was found guilty of disobedience and
sentenced to four hours of guard duty and a month of kitchen work.
   All three papers reported that Shahar said nothing during the
trial and trembled from fear or cold, dressed only in his underwear
and a helmet.
   Maariv said the unit commander watched the trial and did nothing
to stop it.
   Afterward, Shahar returned to his tent, stuck the barrel of his
assault rifle in his mouth and pulled the trigger, according to
newspaper and radio reports.
   Shahar's brother Avi, a junior officer in another army unit,
demanded the soldiers involved be punished.
   ``It was murder,'' Maariv quoted him as saying. ``He pulled the
trigger, but they brought him to that situation.''
   ``Masked soldiers were waiting. They made Eli turn his back to
them, put a helmet on his head, accused him of some offenses and
sentenced him to four hours of guard duty,'' Avi Shahar said on the
television. ``The platoon commander was there. He was watching.''
   Israel radio reported that in July, a Givati soldier committed
suicide and another shot himself in the foot to escape brutality
from comrades.
   In May, a military court convicted four Givati soldiers of abuse
and sentenced them to nine months in jail for beating a Gaza
Palestinian with a broomstick and rifle butts. The Arab later died
of beatings administered by other soldiers.
   Givati troopers often suppress Palestinian riots in the Gaza
Strip. They have become known for rough and sometimes brutal action.

   The man accused of driving drunk on the
wrong side of a highway and causing the deaths of 27 people in a
church bus went on trial Monday under the watchful eyes of many of
the victims' families.
   A man whose wife and two daughters died when Larry Mahoney's
pickup rammed the bus, causing an explosion, said the 36-year-old
factory worker deserved nothing less than ``life in prison
forever.''
   ``To me, (the trial) is a waste of time,'' said Army 1st Sgt.
Lee Williams. ``The man is guilty, in my opinion, and life in
prison is the minimum that he should get.''
   Jury selection was completed Monday for Mahoney's murder trial.
Jurors were then taken to see the wreckage of the bus and Mahoney's
pickup, locked in a warehouse as evidence in the case, then to the
crash site on Interstate 71, about five miles south of Carrollton.
   Police said Mahoney was driving north in the southbound lanes
when his pickup collided with the bus on May 14, 1988. Sixty-seven
members of the Radcliff First Assembly of God church's youth group
were returning from an outing at the King's Island amusement park,
north of Cincinnati.
   Radcliff is the post office town for Fort Knox, where Williams
was chief enlisted man of a medical company at Ireland Army
Hospital.
   ``Plain and simple, this is a murder case,'' Special Prosecutor
Paul Richwalsky said in his opening statement. ``It's about who was
involved and who was responsible. It's about the terrible cost of
drunken driving.''
   Richwalsky, an assistant state attorney general, read aloud each
count of the 82-count indictment, naming one of the crash victims
in each count.
   Many people in the audience, including victims' survivors, wiped
tears from their eyes or clenched their fists as Richwalsky read
the indictment.
   Richwalsky also laid out the prosecution's theory of events
leading up to the crash, what he described as Mahoney's a day of
drinking before he ended up on the interstate. ``Simple case,
tragic results,'' he said.
   Russell Baldani, Mahoney's lead defense laywer, took only 13
minutes to make his statement. He spoke of Mahoney's ``so-called
friends'' who plied him with beer before the crash.
   Baldani said Mahoney was extremely fatigued on the day of the
crash and therefore more sensitive to a small amount of alcohol.
``The truth will lead you to a very simple conclusion: Larry
Mahoney is not a murderer,'' he said.
   Sixty-nine people, representing 29 victims' families, jammed the
Carroll County Courthouse for the opening of Mahoney's trial on 82
criminal charges, including 27 counts of murder.
   ``Seeing Mr. Mahoney in person, I think it's going to be a
stressful event for all of us,'' said William Nichols, whose only
child, 17-year-old William Jr., died aboard the bus.
   ``Mr. Mahoney has his whole family'' at the courthouse, Nichols
said. ``My wife and I are representing my son.''
   Mahoney waived his right to be present on the jury's trip.
   At the warehouse, jurors milled around both wrecked vehicles,
some stopping to peer inside. Several seemed interested in the
space that held the bus' fuel tank, which exploded upon impact.
Federal investigators concluded that the tank was punctured by one
of the bus' leaf springs, causing the explosion.
   All the victims _ 24 children and teen-agers, and three adults _
died of smoke inhalation, not crash injuries. Forty others escaped
through windows or the bus' rear door, but many were severely
injured.
   Mahoney's lawyers plan to base his defense on the bus, which
they allege was inherently unsafe. The prosecution contends the bus
safety issue is incidental and that the collision was due solely to
Mahoney's drunken driving.
   ``This wasn't an accident,'' said Mickie Muller, whose daughter
Katrina survived with disfiguring burns. ``This was a man who chose
to drink, who chose to get into a car.''
   Bus safety ``has nothing to do with this issue,'' Williams said.
``Murder is the issue, drunk driving. We need to concentrate on
that.''

<HEAD>Sicilian Novelist Dead at 68</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALERMO, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leonardo Sciascia, a Sicilian novelist
who wrote of the Mafia, official corruption and Italy's political
class, died Monday at age 68, his family reported.
   Asked once whether he feared a Mafia reprisal, Sciascia replied:
``The Mafia doesn't read literature.''
   A family announcement said he died at his home in Palermo,
capital of Sicily, but did not give the cause of death. Sciascia
had suffered for some time from kidney problems.
   He was part of the Sicilian literary tradition of Luigi
Pirandello and Giuseppe di Lampedusa, who explored the character of
people whose lives were molded by the island's history.
   Among Sciascia's best-known works were ``The Day of the Owl,''
``The Sicilian Relatives'' and ``The Wine-Dark Sea,'' a collection
of short stories about Sicilians coping with authority figures.
   He used ``Candido'' _ Voltaire's ``Candide'' moved to Sicily _
to attack the Mafia and politicians.
   ``I have this image of Sciascia ... of a man who had his own
convictions, which he did not intend to abandon,'' said Giulio
Einaudi, Sciascia's publisher from 1958 to 1983. ``His great
strength was the way he could make news events poetical.''
   One of Sciascia's most controversial works, ``The Moro Affair,''
explored the 1978 kidnapping and murder of former Premier Aldo Moro
by the leftist Red Brigades.
   In the book, Sciascia saw the Christian Democratic politician as
left to his fate by a government of his own party that refused to
deal with his captors, ignoring pleas for help written from Moro's
``people's prison.''
   ``I was very interested in the `friends' of Aldo Moro who, from
`this moment on' (so they said), decided he was no longer
himself,'' the novelist told a newspaper interviewer.
   Sciascia lived in Palermo, but considered home to be a farmhouse
in central Sicily, near his birthplace of Racalmuto, where he did
not have a telephone or keep a car.
   The author had a brief fling with party politics in the 1970s,
winning a seat on the Palermo city council as an independent on the
Communist Party ticket.
   His goal was to help in an anti-Mafia cleanup of city politics.
He resigned because of Communist Party overtures to the Christian
Democrats.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete, and there was no list
immediately available of survivors.

<HEAD>Durban Council Votes to Open Beaches to All Races</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DURBAN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council, reversing a vote
taken two weeks ago, decided Monday to open all beaches to all
races in Durban, South Africa's foremost resort city.
   In another desegregation move, the provincial administrator of
Cape Town issued an order opening all beaches under his authority.
Beaches in Cape Town, also a major holiday city, were opened long
ago. But some municipalities in Cape Town province did not take
similar action or decided to defy the declaration by President F.W.
de Klerk last week that all the country's beaches should be
desegregated.
   Municipalities control most beaches, and only they have the
power to legally desegregate them despite de Klerk's announcement.
   The Durban City Council voted Nov. 6 on a proposal to open all
of Durban's beaches, with 16 members approving the measure and 14
opposing it. The proposal failed because a two-thirds majority was
required.
   Later the council agreed to remove signs declaring sections of
the beaches ``whites only',' but the segregation laws remained in
effect.
   On Monday the vote was 24-5 to open all the beaches that were
still reserved for whites. In coming weeks, thousands of
vacationers will arrive in the Indian Ocean city for the holiday
season.
   De Klerk also has called for repeal of the Separate Amenities
Act that allows the segregation of parks, libraries, swimming pools
and other public facilities.
   Parliament is expected to consider repeal when it reconvenes in
February.
   South Africa has a system of apartheid that by law and custom

   U.S. troops circled an American
military hospital with armored personnel carriers and barbed wire
Monday in an exercise Panama said violated the canal treaties.
   More than 200 Panamanians shouted anti-American slogans outside
Gorgas Hospital while military officials of the two countries
argued about the maneuver.
   Panamanian women pulled out sections of the coiled wire so some
vehicles could reach government installations in the area. Armored
personnel carriers partially blocked the entrance to Health
Ministry offices, across the street from the hospital.
   Maj. Manuel Rodriguez, a member of a joint U.S.-Panamanian
military board, told U.S. officials the maneuver violated the 1977
treaties, under which the canal is to be turned over to Panama at
the end of 1999, because it obstructed traffic and had not been
cleared with Panamanian officials.
   Sources at the U.S. Southern Command, American military
headquarters, said Panama had been told of the exercise in advance.
   Rodriguez claimed the purpose of the maneuver was ``to hide the
wounded who are coming from El Salvador,'' where hundreds of people
have been killed or wounded in 10 days of some of the heaviest
fighting in the country's decade-old civil war.
   The U.S. army holds regular military exercises, which it says
are necessary to train soldiers defending the Panama Canal.
   Relations between Panama and the United States have deteriorated
in the past two years because of U.S. efforts to have Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega removed as Panama's military commander, a position
from which he controls the government.
   Noriega has been indicted in Florida on federal charges of drug
trafficking and money laundering. He denies the accusations.

   An emissary from West Germany met with East
German leaders Monday and said the Communist Party may lose its
constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power as early as next year.
   Rudolf Seiters, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff, also
said he expects a law on free elections to be approved in 1990.
   Party chief Egon Krenz, standing beside Seiters, looked
impassive as the West German official predicted abolition of the
``leading role'' guarantee for the Communists.
   More than 400,000 people demonstrated in several cities for
rapid reform and free elections, the official news agency ADN
reported.
   It said 200,000 people marched in Leipzig, a southern city where
the largest pro-democracy demonstrations have been held; 100,000 in
Dresden; 50,000 each in Halle and Karl-Marx-Stadt; and 10,000 in
Schwerin.
   One speaker at the Leipzig rally, who was not identified, said
in an apparent comment about German reunification: ``We must not
suppress the will for unity. We are one people.''
   Krenz described his talks with Seiters as ``solid,'' but said no
specific date was set for a summit with Kohl in East Germany next
month.
   Kohl's visit, the first by a West German chancellor to East
Germany, is expected before Christmas but after the special
Communist Party congress Dec. 15-17.
   In a televised interview Sunday night, Krenz said the congress
might remove him as party leader.
   ``It is a decision of my party and I've always respected the
decisions of my party,'' he said. ``Naturally, I want to fight for
the changes we've managed so far, but if the party is of another
opinion, then they should find another general secretary.''
   Seiters was asked specifically whether Kohl would meet with
Krenz, and replied: ``Let's just say he will meet with East German
leadership.''
   Premier Hans Modrow, who took part in the talks, said he hoped
for a ``partnership'' between West German business and East
Germany's state-run industry.
   Seiters said he sounded out East German leaders on some changes
sought by opposition groups, including free elections and
constitutional reform.
   ``I have the impression that the constitutional change and the
new voting law will be approved next spring,'' he told the joint
news conference with Krenz and Modrow. ``I have the impression that
Article 1 of the constitution will be changed.''
   Article 1 contains the ``leading role'' for the party.
   Removing the guarantee and opening the way for free elections
are conditions of a financial aid program West Germany has offered.
   ADN said many placards and banners carried in Leipzig, where the
largest pro-democracy protests have been held, criticized East
Germans who take advantage of their new freedom to sell valuables
and currency on the black market.
   It quoted one as saying: ``No East German money in the West. We
are hurting ourselves.''
   Government sources in Bonn said West Germany was considering a
more favorable rate of exchange for East German visitors.
   Under the plan being studied, East Germans would be able to
exchange up to 300 marks at a rate of 4 non-convertible East German
mark for 1 West German. The black market rate is more than 20-1.
   Late Monday, ADN said Krenz had postponed a visit to
Czechoslovakia planned for Tuesday, but it did not give a reason.
Large pro-democracy demonstrations have been held in Prague.
   Seiters, who spoke of the ``dramatic weeks'' Germans had
experienced, carried with him details of Bonn's offer of economic
aid, made last week and also conditioned on East German efforts to
create a free-market economy.
   Modrow and others have have rejected what they see as an attempt
to lure East Germany away from Communist principles.
   In a speech to Parliament on Saturday, Modrow outlined a course
that mixes some capitalist elements with Communist planning and
embraces many themes of the reform program pursued in the Soviet
Union by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   State TV said the main question was whether Bonn was prepared
for relations ``on a measurably higher level without unacceptable
conditions.''
   A public opinion survey reported Monday by a West German
magazine indicated the Communist Party would run third, with only
14 percent of the vote, if elections were held now.
   New Forum, the largest opposition group, led with 22 percent and
the Liberal Democrats, a non-Communist party, was second in the
poll commissioned by Stern magazine.
   Krenz has promised free elections but has not set a date.
   Otto Lambsdorff, head of the centrist Free Democratic Party in
West Germany, proposed Monday that tighter controls on currency and
customs controls be established at the border to avoide smuggling
and a ``buyout'' of East German goods and valuables.
   Economists in both countries fear tourists will sell subsidized
goods in the West to earn hard currency and that some Westerners
may shop for food and clothing in cheaper East German stores.
   In the first disclosure of the extent of labor losses, ADN said
nearly 100,000 of East Germany's 16.5 million people had resettled
in West Germany since Nov. 1 and 275,000 so far this year.
   The figure for all of 1988 was under 40,000.

   Traffic flowed smoothly on Monday, the
first workday since the quake-battered Bay Bridge reopened, but
officials said Thanksgiving week could be the cause and suggested
the real crunch could come next week.
   The doctor who cared for Buck Helm, the longshoreman who
survived 3{ days in his car in a collapsed section of Interstate
880, said his death Saturday was partly due to a heart condition
they had been unaware of.
   However, Dr. Tom McDonald, chief of surgery at Kaiser Permanente
Medical Center, told a news conference in Oakland that Helm
suffered ``overwhelming'' injuries in the freeway collapse that
claimed 41 other lives.
   In all, the Oct. 17 quake killed 67 people, injured more than
2,800, left more than 14,000 homeless and inflicted an estimated $7
billion damage.
   The quake sent a 50-foot section of the San Francisco-Oakland
Bay Bridge's upper deck crashing onto the lower deck, cutting the
main link between San Francisco and Oakland. The 8.5-mile-long span
formally reopened Friday.
   Traffic Monday on the bridge was running 50 percent less than
Oct. 17, said Lt. Jim Simmons of the state Department of
Transportation, who is toll supervisor at the bridge. Before the
quake, an average of 260,000 cars used the bridge each day.
   ``Obviously, people are still taking mass transit and coming in
earlier,'' said Greg Bayol, a spokesman for the state Department of
Transportation. ``The test will come later, this being a holiday
week.''
   Traffic also was down on the Golden Gate Bridge, which handles
traffic southbound into the city. It is used along with the
Richmond-San Rafael Bridge by commuters from bedroom communities to
the east.
   From 6 a.m. to 8 a.m., 14,086 cars used the span, down from
17,634 for the same period a week ago, said Capt. Jackson Fong of
the Golden Gate Bridge District. The Golden Gate handles about
146,000 cars daily.
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit system, which set records almost
every day while the Bay Bridge was closed, carried about 20 percent
fewer passengers during the morning commute than a week ago. By
8:30 a.m., the system had transported 65,239 passengers, compared
to 78,003 the previous Monday, said BART spokesman Sy Mouber.
   However, Mouber pointed out that BART carried just 47,415
passengers on Oct. 5, making Monday's load 118 percent of that
before the quake.
   Asked if these figures meant people have permanently changed the
way they commute, Mouber said, ``I don't think we are seeing the
results yet. I think people are taking an early Thanksgiving
holiday.''
   ``Next week may look a little different,'' said Mike Mills, a
spokesman for the Alameda Contra Costa Counties Transit System,
which runs public buses.
   The number of passengers taking AC Transit buses across the
bridge on routes beginning in Oakland and Alameda appeared to be
down, Mills said.
   The number of people riding a ferry from Oakland and San
Francisco was also down, according to the Red &amp; White Fleet.
Between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m., there were 1,165 passengers, a drop of
472 from last Monday.
   According to the Alameda County Coroner's Office, Helm died of
blunt trauma to his head and body, respiratory failure due to
extensive chest injuries, kidney failure and abdominal infection.
   Before the quake, Helm, 58, had high blood pressure and diabetes.
   Doctors learned after Helm's death that he had an enlarged
ventricle, the chamber of the heart that pumps blood into the
arteries, McDonald told reporters. McDonald said it had not been
possible for doctors to know about the heart problem.
   The surgeon said he had been looking forward to taking Helm off
the respirator that kept the longshoreman breathing, and was as
shocked by anyone by his death. ``We had all been so encouraged,''
McDonald said.

   Students returning Monday to a school hit
by a tornado last week peered into a cafeteria where seven
classmates died, now bedecked with flowers and a spray-painted
epitaph: ``Pray for the Children.''
   Classes were not held at the East Coldenham Elementary School,
but more than 20 counselors were on hand to help children grieve
for the seven who died when the freak storm brought down the
cafeteria wall.
   Five funerals were held Monday for the 7- and 8-year-old
victims. Two youngsters were buried over the weekend.
   Dozens of parents brought their children to the school.
Officials urged them to look into the cafeteria, where the wall is
boarded up and the room cleaned out.
   ``A lot of people want to see when they first come in what it
looks like. When they see that it's pretty much back where it was,
I think a lot of people are relieved,'' said Horst Graefe, director
of pupil personnel for the Valley Central School District. ``I
think the kids are relieved. I haven't found anyone upset with the
notion that the doors are open.''
   Outside, dozens of floral arrangements were piled against the
boarded-up cafeteria wall beneath the spray-painted message.
   ``We're ready. It's been long enough,'' said Beth Lambert, who
brought her daughter, Megan, to the school.
   Sheryl Pressel, after bringing her 10-year-old son Billy back to
look at the school, said that living with the tornado has been
tougher on the parents than on the surviving children.
   ``What amazes me are some of the parents of the children that
died are in there today. I don't think I could handle that,'' she
said, her voice breaking. ``If I had a child that I lost in that
school, I wouldn't want to go back in there.''
   East Coldenham Principal Harvey Gregory said that long-term
healing has begun.
   ``A lot of the healing has gone on for the last two or three
days,'' he said. ``We've worked through our grief and we've all
come back to the realization that we have to be happy with what we
have now.''
   In addition to the social workers at the elementary school,
counselors also were on hand at the district's six other schools,
where classes resumed Monday, said Robert Schoonmaker, the school
district's assistant superintendent. Classes will begin Tuesday at
East Coldenham, 60 miles north of New York City.
   School Superintendent James Coonan said it will cost nearly
$400,000 to rebuild the cafeteria wall. He said he wants to make it
look as different as possible, with less glass.
   ``We'll do anything to make it comfortable for the kids,'' he
said. ``If we have to make like booths in McDonald's, we will.''
   Eleven of the 18 injured remain hospitalized Monday, two in
critical condition.
   Church bells pealed in Orange County on Monday as families
buried the five children. Two funerals were held Saturday.
   On Sunday night, about 3,000 residents crammed into a high
school to hear townspeople and Gov. Mario Cuomo eulogize the
victims.

   A storm packing winds up to 78 mph and snow howled over Upper
Michigan on Monday, as temperatures hit 71 degrees in other
sections of the Midwest.
   Snow showers also fell on northwest Minnesota and Maine.
Scattered rain fell along the northern Pacific Coast, the central
Texas coast and northeast New York.
   Much of Upper Michigan's Lake Superior shoreline was under a
winter storm warning that predicted up to a foot of new snow and
wind chills down to 20 degrees below. An advisory warning of snow
and blowing, drifting snow was in effect for northern Lower
Michigan, where up to 7 inches of snow was expected.
   Lakes Erie and Ontario were under storm warnings prompted by the
strong, gusty winds.
   The strongest gusts recorded in Upper Michigan were in Copper
Harbor, where they hit 78 mph. Winds gusting to 60 mph were clocked
in Pellston, Iron Mountain, Ironwood, Whitefish Point and Grand
Marais, and near 50 mph in Saulte Ste. Marie.
   High wind warnings were also issued for western New York state,
Minnesota, Wisconsin and northeast Iowa. Winds gusted over 40 mph
in northern Minnesota and to 51 mph in Dubuque, Iowa, late in the
morning.
   Temperatures were 10 to 20 degrees warmer than normal for the
third week this month. By noon, the mercury had climbed to 71
degrees as far north as Marion, Ill., and Garden City, Kan.
   The weather was also warm in Southern California and
unseasonably cool in New England. Temperatures across the rest of
the nation were generally near normal.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 22
degrees in Caribou, Maine, to 85 degrees in Burbank and Santa
Monica, Calif. The low temperature for the Lower 48 states was 4
degrees in Gunnison, Colo.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 200,000 people filled
the streets of Prague on Monday, demanding free elections and the
resignation of the hard-line leader in the largest protest ever in
this Communist nation.
   For the first time in decades, major protests involving tens of
thousands of citizens also broke out in other cities, state-run
Czechoslovak TV said.
   The protests posed the greatest threat to date to the rigid
model of Communist government that has prevailed here since a
Soviet-led invasion crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reform movement
in 1968.
   Czechoslovak TV said at least 200,000 people took part in the
march in the capital. It also reported 20,000 protesters in the
city of Brno, 10,000 in Bratislava and 5,000 in Liberec.
   ``Freedom!'' and ``End to one-party rule!'' cried the
demonstrators in Prague. Their protest began with a few hundred
people in downtown Wenceslas Square and turned into a triumphal
march for democracy, accompanied by the clanging of bells from
sympathetic trolley-car drivers. Bystanders jangled their keys in
solidarity.
   From Wenceslas Square, the protesters set out for Hradcany
Castle, a national symbol and the residence of President Gustav
Husak. They were blocked by police barriers and later dispersed
peacefully after a three-hour march.
   ``It's the end, Milos!'' the demonstrators shouted, referring to
Communist Party chief Milos Jakes. To fellow Czechoslovaks, they
chanted, ``Stop being afraid!''
   Jakes responded by warning the demonstrators not to go too far.
   ``Any attempts to disrupt social and political stability ... can
only seriously threaten the implementation of necessary change and
bring the society into a crisis with unforeseeable consequences,''
the 67-year-old leader said on television.
   In a sharp break with usual practice, the television devoted
extensive coverage to the demonstrations, and the official news
agency CTK and Czechoslovak radio reported the protesters' demands
for free elections.
   Some protesters carried banners reading ``Red murderers to
court'' _ a reference to the alleged death of mathematics student
Martin Smid. Dissidents say Smid was killed Friday by police, but
the government called reports of the death ``an unfounded rumor.''
   The demonstrators also supported a general strike called by
students and artists for Nov. 27.
   In Washington, the State Department canceled a planned visit by
Jan Fojtik, chief ideologist of the Czechoslovak Communist Party,
because of the use of force against protesters.
   Department spokeswoman said earlier the police actions were ``in
sharp contrast to other East European countries who are beginning
to respond to the wishes of their people.''
   Monday's demonstrations in Czechoslovakia were the latest signs
of political unrest sweeping Eastern Europe.
   More than 200,000 demonstrators took to the streets in the East
German city of Leipzig to press for free elections and an end to
the Communist monopoly on power. Communist Party chief Egon Krenz
met with an envoy from Bonn in talks expected to focus on financial
aid.
   In Romania, however, President Nicolae Ceausescu told a party
congress that he rejects reforms and proclaimed the perpetuation of
rigid Communist rule.
   Czechoslovakia's government also has rejected reforms, but
Monday's protest in Prague was the fourth in as many days and
indicated severe trouble for the leadership.
   Police did not stop the march, but they set up barriers across
bridges on the Vltava river leading to Hradcany Castle. Many
demonstrators changed course at that point and continued to a major
plaza, Old Town Square, chanting ``We are the people.''
   The small police presence contrasted sharply with the situation
Friday, when security forces severely beat demonstrators. The
violence prompted outrage at home and abroad. The State Department
called on the Czechoslovak government to ``end this senseless
violence against its own citizens.''
   ``By attacking peaceful demonstrators, Czechoslovakian
authorities further damaged their credibility at home and abroad,''
said spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   Also Monday, students began a sit-in strike at Prague
universities to protest the police attacks, and television reported
some high schools had gone on strike.
   Vaclav Havel, a prominent playwright and activist whose works
are banned in his homeland, canceled a trip to Sweden, where he was
due to accept the Olof Palme award, to protest the violence. In
Sweden, it was announced that Foreign Minister Sten Andersson will
go to Prague to present the award to Havel.
   Krenz postponed a Tuesday visit to Prague without giving a
reason. Britain summoned the Czechoslovak ambassador to protest the
police beatings of two British journalists. It called the weekend
violence ``disgraceful and gratuitous.''
   According to unofficial reports, student strike committees were
negotiating with university authorities at the Technical University
in Prague and the downtown Film Faculty.
   At least three official Prague theaters went on a de facto
strike, refusing to put on shows and terminating cooperation with
official media, actors said by telephone, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   A statement of the official Socialist Union of Youth called
Friday's crackdown on student demonstrators ``politically
irresponsible.''
   The communique was endorsed by Vasil Mohorita, the union's
chairman and Communist Party Central Committee secretary. It was
the first time a Communist official publicly condemned such police
action.
   The march Friday commemorated student Jan Opletal, killed by the
Nazis 50 years ago. It was the largest demonstration in
Czechoslvakia since August 1969, when about 50,000 people gathered
in Prague a year after a Soviet-led invasion crushed reform.

   President Bush campaigned Monday for two
Republican congresswomen whose election would help the GOP in the
Senate but whose views clash with his own veto-enforced opposition
to abortion.
   Flying back to Washington, the president vetoed, for the second
time this year, the annual bill appropriating funds for the
District of Columbia because it would allow the use of local funds
for abortions.
   Bush praised the two women for supporting him on a variety of
matters, saying of Lynn Martin, who is running for the Senate in
Illinois: ``Lynn's been right on issue after issue. ... She thinks
like I do, like you do.''
   He did not mention abortion in his remarks at a Chicago
fund-raising luncheon for Martin, emphasizing instead his reliance
on her on such issues as capital gains taxes and efforts to clean
up the environment.
   Bush later flew to Rhode Island to attend separate fund-raising
events for Senate contender Rep. Claudine Schneider and Gov. Edward
DiPrete, who is seeking a fourth two-year term as Rhode Island's
chief executive.
   Bush called Schneider, who has not declared her candidacy, ``an
independent, principled congresswoman with a proud record of
leadership on the environment, on education and in combating crime.
She's a great representative and I think she'd make a great
senator.''
   Again, Bush steered clear of the abortion issue.
   In remarks at the governor's mansion for DiPrete, Bush said he
was undaunted by this year's congressional defeat on winning a
lower capital gains tax rate.
   ``When Congress starts its new session next year, we're going to
make it absolutely clear that the fight for a capital gains cut is
far from over,'' Bush said.
   Bush also previewed his summit meeting with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev for the DiPrete supporters, saying ``this is
going to be a historic meeting'' but adding, ``I don't want to
overpromise.''
   He said the meeting presented a good opportunity to enhance
peace prospects. But, he added, ``I will be prudent and be cautious
and keep my eyes open.''
   On other issues during his trip:
   _Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would
go to Brussels immediately after the Dec. 2-3 summit with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to brief NATO leaders.
   _Bush said he hoped for ``meaningful dialogue'' in his
Mediterranean shipboard summit with Gorbachev. ``This meeting will
occur because America has been resolute in defense of liberty,''
Bush said. ``And it will occur amid the changes sweeping East and
Central Europe and bringing freedom to millions who share a common
heritage with so many in Illinois.''
   _Fitzwater said the president would make a 10-minute prime-time
address to the nation Wednesday night, talking about the upcoming
summit and about developments in Eastern Europe.
   As Bush spoke at the $250-a-person GOP fund-raiser in Chicago,
he was heckled by several members of the audience who shouted
criticism of U.S. policy in El Salvador.
   When a woman accused the administration of killing priests, Bush
said: ``We are not. You be quiet.''
   Bush then sought to explain why the U.S. was supporting the
government in El Salvador.
   Then, a second member of the audience, a man, jumped up and
shouted, ``Stop the repression in El Salvador.''
   Four demonstrators, three of them identified as Roman Catholic
nuns by a colleague, were led out and arrested by security forces
as the crowd applauded.
   ``Now, who's next,'' Bush joked. ``I'm here to talk about Lynn.
This is not a town meeting.
   ``We must not pull our support away from a freely elected
government in Central America,'' Bush said.
   In Rhode Island, Bush's motorcade whizzed by two groups of
demonstrators appearing on behalf of the homeless and AIDS patients.
   Before leaving on the trip, Bush cautioned Congress not to cut
off aid for El Salvador, saying it would be unacceptable to him as
president. About mid-day, the House voted on procedural grounds
against including Salvador-aid restrictions in a foreign aid bill.
   Two gubernatorial candidates Bush campaigned for earlier this
fall _ Marshall Coleman in Virginia and Rep. James Courter in New
Jersey _ lost Nov. 7. Both shared Bush's anti-abortion position,
and polls suggested their stands may have contributed to their
defeats.
   Martin, who along with Schneider visited Bush in the White House
last week to air their differences on the abortion issue, was
referred to by Bush as a ``close and dear friend.''
   Both women are seeking to oust incumbent Democratic senators
next year.
   Martin has announced she will try to unseat Sen. Paul Simon in
Illinois, while Schneider is considered the likely challenger to
Sen. Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island.
   While in Chicago, Bush visited Picard Elementary School on
Chicago's south side.
   After Bush's address to schoolchildren in September outlining a
national anti-drug strategy, Picard's teachers had their pupils
write the president about how drugs affected their lives. A letter
from fifth-grader Ana Zamora caught Bush's eye.
   ``I never go outside because my mom gets scared that I'll get
hurt because of the gang fights,'' she wrote.
   On Monday, she got the first question and asked Bush ``how much
do you arrest'' drug users.
   ``We're beginning to make the case that a person who uses drugs
has to pay the penalty,'' he responded.

<HEAD>Politburo Member Calls for Overhaul of Communist Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politburo member Marian Orzechowski called
Monday for a complete overhaul of the Communist Party, saying new
members were needed at all levels of the organization, the official
news agency PAP said.
   Orzechowski, who also leads the Communist Party caucus in
Parliament, made the appeal at a meeting of local party officials
in the Baltic port of Gdansk, the agency said.
   The party suffered a historic defeat when it became the first
East bloc party to lose control of the government with the election
of Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a former Solidarity trade union editor, as
prime minister on Aug. 24.
   Since then, the Polish United Workers' Party _ the Communist
Party in Poland but known by its Polish initials as the PUWP _ has
been struggling to find a new direction and has called a Congress
for Jan. 27 to map out a new political strategy.
   But party members are divided over whether to follow the
Hungarian model and form a new party or try to reform the current
organization.
   ``Poland, working people and socialism vitally need strong
socialist political formation. ... It should be a new party
compared to the PUWP, in all aspects of its activities,''
Orzechowski said.
   He told the meeting that ``from the point of view of cadres
there is a necessity for a general generation replacement of party
cadres on all levels. This is he elementary condition of regaining
credibility and getting social trust for the new party.''
   The party is already considering a name change and has decided
that the more than 1,500 delegates to the Congress should be
elected directly.
   Delegates to the Congress are to consider alternative proposals
for reform of the party that have already been presented to the
Central Committee.
   One proposal calls for the creation of a new party of leftist
forces, and the other calls for transformation of the current party
while retaining the present name.
   An internal party survey in September indicated that 72 percent
of the members favored a complete retooling of the party, starting
with its name.

<TEXT>
   Two masked gunmen entered a hotel Monday
and opened fire on a group of Basque politicians, killing one
elected legislator and wounding another, police reported.
   They identified the victims as Jon Muguruza, 31, and Inaki
Esnaola, 41, both elected to Parliament's lower house in the Oct.
29 balloting. Officials at Gregorio Maranon Hospital said Muguruza
was dead on arrival and Esnaola was in grave condition with two
bullet wounds in the head.
   Both were supporters of the militant Basque separatist
organization ETA.
   It was believed to be the first assassination of a Spanish
parliamentarian since before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War
in 1936.
   Muguruza and Esnaola were among four deputies and three senators
of the Basque party Herri Batasuna (Popular Union) who were to
swear allegiance to Spain Tuesday before being installed in
Parliament.
   Police said no group asserted responsibility for the attack that
occurred in the restaurant of the Hotel Alcala at 11 p.m.
   They said Muguruza and Esnaola were with the five other elected
Basque parliamentarians and three journalists seated around a table
when the gunmen attacked. The journalists are employees of the
Basque newspaper Egin.
   All members of the 350-seat lower house of Parliament (Cortes)
are to swear allegiance Tuesday to the constitution _ the first
step in the process of establishing a new Parliament that King Juan
Carlos is to open December 6.
   It is the first time since democracy was restored in 1977 that
Basque separatists elected to Parliament planned to swear
allegiance and take their seats. Other Basques politicians have
been elected to Parliament but refused to take the oath and were
not seated.
   Esnaola said in a recent interview that he and his colleagues
would swear allegiance under duress ``because I am forced to by
law.'' He said the Basque deputies and senators would serve in
Parliament so they could speak out for self-determination for the
Basque region in northern Spain and serve as mediators in
negotiations between the government and outlawed ETA.
   ETA is an acronym in the Basque language for Basque land and
liberty.
   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist Party won the October
elections.
   His government began exploratory peace talks with exiled ETA
leaders in Algiers earlier this year but canceled them April when
ETA terrorists renewed their attacks.
   The Basque legislators were shot on the 14th anniversary of the
death of Gen. Francisco Franco, who eliminated the historic
political rights of the Spanish Basques after his forces won the
Civil War in 1939.
   The Basque Popular Union is regarded as the political wing of
the ETA.
   Over the past 21 years, ETA has claimed responsibility for the
killings of more than 600 people, with most of the victims police
or military officers.
   Basque Populars Unity has won 10-15 percent of the vote in the
three Basque provinces, with a population of 2.1 million, since
1979.
   Muguruzu was an elected deputy from Vizcaya province and Esnaola
from Guipuzcoa province.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The survivors of two slain union activists went
into federal court Monday to try to prove that the 1981 murders
were ordered by the government of then-Philippines President
Ferdinand Marcos.
   Marcos maintained an ``intelligence network'' of agents in the
United States who attacked and intimidated opponents of his regime,
lawyer Jeff Robinson told a federal court in opening arguments of
the civil lawsuit.
   Gene Viernes and Silme Domingo, union activists and agitators
against the Marcos regime, were shot to death on June 1, 1981,
outside the offices of the Alaska Cannery Workers Union in Seattle.
   Three men were convicted of murder in the killings, which
prosecutors said resulted from an internal union dispute over
gambling and work assignments in Alaskan fish canneries.
   But friends and relatives of the dead men will try to prove that
Domingo and Viernes were really killed on orders from Manila
because of their anti-Marcos activities.
   A jury of eight and two alternates was seated Monday for the
trial, expected to last three to four weeks. The lawsuit names
Marcos and his wife, Imelda, as defendants.
   Other defendants include the convicted killers, the Philippines
government, which has chosen not to defend itself against the suit,
and others allegedly linked directly to the killings.
   The plaintiffs say their evidence will show not only that
Domingo and Viernes were marked for death by Marcos' government,
but that U.S. government agencies allowed Philippine intelligence
agents to operate in this country to keep track of anti-Marcos
activity.
   Jailing and killing dissidents or causing them to disappear were
weapons in Marcos' anti-opponent arsenal before his government was
toppled in 1986, Robinson said.
   ``All of these techniques were used by the Marcos regime as
business as usual to consolidate power and silence dissent,'' he
said.
   Evidence will show that Marcos established a network in this
country _ primarily in Seattle, San Francisco and Honolulu _ to
keep track of anti-Marcos activities.
   Intimidation techniques ranged from using imposing bodybuilders
to harass demonstrators at anti-Marcos protests, to pressuring
advertisers to drop ads in Filipino newspapers that weren't
sufficiently pro-Marcos, Robinson said.
   Robinson said evidence will show that the punishment was
sometimes death. He compared Domingo and Viernes with Benigno
Aquino, the anti-Marcos political leader who was killed upon his
return to Manila in 1982; and with Primitivo Mijares, who wrote the
book ``The Conjugal Dictatorship'' about Marcos and who vanished in
San Francisco after he was seen with a Marcos supporter.
   ``The common thread that will tie these people together is that
they were (watched) by the intelligence operation ... and they were
acted against by the intelligence operation,'' Robinson said.
   Defense opening arguments were scheduled for Tuesday.
   ``I think that people are going to learn that the Marcos
government was responsible for these murders and that for years the
Marcos government was harassing and violating U.S. citizens' civil
rights in this country,'' said Domingo's sister, Cindy, an
organizer of the Committee for Justice for Domingo and Viernes.
   One defense attorney in the case, however, called the
plaintiffs' case ``underwhelming.''
   ``It will become frightfully apparent how little evidence there
is,'' said Kate Alfieri, a San Francisco attorney representing Dr.
Leonilo Malabed, a Marcos friend who allegedly maintained a slush
fund used to pay for the murders.
   The lawsuit was filed in September 1982, seeking $30 million on
behalf of the Domingo and Viernes families. Some original
defendants, including U.S. intelligence agencies, have been
dropped, others have been added, and Marcos and his wife, Imelda,
were dismissed at one point and then reinstated.
   Although Marcos died Sept. 28, the lawsuit continues against his
estate. The Marcoses gave videotaped depositions in Hawaii after
they fled their homeland when their government collapsed in 1986.
Mrs. Marcos has not been subpoenaed to testify.
   Other defendants are the Philippines government, which chose not
to defend itself against the lawsuit, and members of the Tulisan
gang convicted of killing Domingo and Viernes.
   Among the witnesses scheduled to appear is Bonifacio Gillego, a
one-time military intelligence officer under Marcos and now a
congressman in the Philippines, said Sharon Maeda, spokeswoman for
the Committee for Justice for Domingo and Viernes. It was Gillego,
she said, who drew the plaintiffs' attention to a key document in
the case: an account sheet for the supposed slush fund maintained
by Malabed.
   The lawsuit theorizes that $15,000 to pay for the murders came
from that account of the Mabuhay Corp., a now-defunct company that
had been set up to purchase a radio station.
   The document, among papers seized from Marcos when he arrived in
Hawaii after his ouster, has a heading for ``special intelligence
projects'' and includes a listing for $15,000 with the date May 17,
1981, two weeks before the murders.
   The plaintiffs allege that Constantine Baruso, who was president
of the cannery workers union and whose gun was used in the
killings, was in San Francisco that day and picked up the money.
Baruso was never charged.
   Ms. Alfieri said ``there's no evidence that supports that
theory.''
   ``This is all cloak and dagger activity that's been alleged ...
but there's no evidence whatsoever that there was a slush fund,''
she said.
   Ms. Alfieri said she was confident she will be able to ask for a
directed verdict from the judge at the end of the plaintiffs' case,
and won't even have to present defense evidence for her client.
   Ms. Domingo replied: ``I think the problem is that the defense
has no defense, (except to say) that these murders were just over
union reform and gambling.''

<TEXT>
   Security forces arrested 16
social workers in a dawn raid Monday on the Episcopal church.
Combat in a guerrilla offensive was reported continuing in only a
few isolated areas.
   Security forces raided at least seven churches or church schools
Sunday and Monday in a backlash to the offensive that paralyzed the
capital for a week.
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker blamed the raids on ``overly
aggressive security forces'' and suggested President Alfredo
Cristiani was having ``management control problems'' with extremist
elements of his government.
   ``I really think President Cristiani is under a barrage from all
sides. I think some things are happening that he would prefer not
to happen,'' said Walker.
   Church workers and war refugees they sheltered were questioned
and the buildings were searched for arms, ammunition and medicine,
said church officials, workers and witnesses.
   Salvadoran churches, especially those that work with the poor,
are considered hotbeds of leftist subversion by the right and
authorities suspect them of aiding or harboring guerrillas.
   In Washington, President Bush said he opposed cutting off aid in
response to the slayings Thursday of six Jesuit priests, which
Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas of San Salvador said appeared to be
the work of the military.
   The House of Representatives rejected an attempt to restrict the
aid, voting 215-194 to keep the restriction from being added to a
foreign aid bill.
   Combat between guerrillas and the army was largely confined to
the working class neighborhood of Soyapango. There was heavy
fighting in Apopa, a town 12 miles to the north and about halfway
along the retreat route for rebels returning to their strongholds
on Guazapa mountain.
   Although thousands were homeless, the capital appeared to be
returning to normal. Stores, shops and other businesses were open
and service stations were selling gasoline for the first time since
last week.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front high command said
Monday the offensive had dealt the government serious blows.
   ``The fascist beast is defeated politically and militarily, it
is mortally wounded,'' the guerrillas said on their clandestine
radio, Venceremos.
   National Guard troops raided the Episcopal church just after the
dusk-to-dawn curfew ended, a guard officer said privately.
   The church, in one of San Salvador's most affluent
neighborhoods, has sheltered about 200 refugees.
   Nine Salvadorans and seven foreigners were arrested and taken to
Treasury Police headquarters, said a church worker who would not
let his name be used.
   The Treasury Police refused to confirm they had anyone from the
church in custody. Treasury Police used to investigate fiscal
crimes, but since the civil war began they have been in charge of
political cases.
   All those detained worked in the church's social services
program, the church worker said.
   He said the director of the program, his wife and a lay worker
were arrested Sunday in their homes.
   The foreigners included Josephine Beecher of Lopez Island,
Wash., a Canadian woman, a Colombian, a Guatemalan and three people
from Spain. The Canadian, Karen Ridd, 28, of Winnipeg, was released
late Monday with a Colombian collegue, a Canadian Embassy official
in Costa Rica said.
   The church worker said they probably would be deported. Other
foreign workers, including a dozen Lutheran missionaries, have been
arrested and expelled from the country in recent days.
   The Rev. Luis Serrano, the Episcopal pastor, went into hiding,
the church worker said.
   The office of the archbishop of San Salvador said there also
were raids on the Emmanuel Baptist Church and five Roman Catholic
churches or schools.
   The Lutheran Church was shuttered. Its bishop, Medardo Gomez, is
an outspoken member of the national coalition seeking peace talks
between the U.S.-backed government and the rebels.
   Like many clerics, including Rivera Damas and the slain Jesuits,
Gomez says nothing has been done to address the poverty, ignorance
and misery that led to the decade-old conflict in this
Massachusetts-sized nation of 5.2 million.
   Such opinions are deemed subversive by some on the right.
   Attorney General Mauricio Colorado blamed Rivera Damas and the
auxiliary bishop for fomenting leftist violence through their
``questionable ideology.''
   When asked if the raids, Colorado's statements and other
incidents indicated that Cristiani was having trouble maintaining
control over the more extreme elements of his government,
Ambassador Walker said:
   ``Management control problems exist in situations like this, and
it's not a management control problem that would lnd itself to a
Harvard Business school analysis. I mean, this is war. It's
fighting, it's death, it's events such as the killings of the
Jesuits that explode upon a president, and he's got to pay
attention.''
   Cristiani campaigned as the representative of a new, moderate
wing in a party long linked to El Salvador's infamous death squads.
   Rivera Damas' office said security forces had raided three other
Roman Catholic churches and two schools on Sunday. War refuees were
being sheltered at each of the sites.
   At San Franciso Church, five Salvadoran lay workers were taken
away by soldiers, the parish priest said, refusing to give his name.
   He said the soldiers accused the church of running a clandestine
clinic for wounded guerrillas. The clinic is in an area held by the
rebels.
   ``We don't make distinctions,'' he said. ``We were taking care
of everyone. Our work is humanitarian, Christian. We didn't ask who
people were. But none of them had weapons.''
   Monday evening, the National Police searched the hotel room of
Joseph Gannon, an American reporter who works for Canada's MacLean
magazine. Police left Gannon's room after 20 minutes, saying they
found nothing incriminating.
   Gannon was picked up Sunday in Soyapango and spent the day under
arrest. He was released on orders of Col. Heriberto Hernandez,
commander of the Treasury Police.
   El Salvador has been under a state-of-emergency since the
guerrillas launched an all-out attack Nov. 11. The emergency
suspends individual guarantees and allows police forces to search
premises without a warrant.

   A woman convicted of hiring a gang to murder her
millionaire husband three years ago should be sentenced to life in
prison, a jury recommended Monday.
   Jurors, who could have recommended the death penalty for Joyce
Cohen, reached their decision after deliberating about 40 minutes.
   Dade County Circuit Judge Fredricka Smith set sentencing for
Tuesday. She is not bound by the jury's recommendation.
   The same panel on Thursday found Mrs. Cohen, 39, guilty of
first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and using a
firearm in commission of the March 7, 1986, of Stanley Cohen.
   She was convicted of offering three hit men $100,000 to kill her
husband.
   Prosecutors said she supplied a map of their Coconut Grove home,
disconnected alarms, unlocked the door and gave them her husband's
gun.
   Prosecutors said the marriage had soured, and that the former
secretary feared a divorce would end her jet-set lifestyle.
   Defense attorneys said the killings were due to Cohen's drug
connections, but his relatives said that was a lie.
   In the penalty phase of the trial Monday, defense witnesses
testified Mrs. Cohen had been sexually molested during a miserable
childhood.
   ``Her mother, a prostitute, died when she was about 12 and she
virtually was never raised by a mother,'' said Dr. Lawrence Cohn, a
psychiatrist.
   A friend of the defendant, Claudia Smith, said she did not
believe Mrs. Cohen could harm anyone.
   ``I know you found her guilty,'' a sobbing Mrs. Smith told the
jury, ``but I and a lot of people have stood by her and I am still
and so are her other friends.''
   Prosecutor John Kastrenakes said Mrs. Cohen chose ``to plan and
to carry out ... a brutal, heinous murder of her husband while he
lay sleeping in his own bed.''

   Afghan rebels said Monday that Soviet
tanks crossed into Afghanistan's northwestern Faryab province and
shelled villages and guerrilla positions near the border.
   A statement issued by a coalition of seven rebel groups
headquartered in Pakistan did not mention any casualties or say
when the purported attack occurred.
   It said a Soviet tank unit shelled areas around Andkhoi, 16
miles from the Soviet border.
   The rebels frequently claim Soviet warplanes raid northern
Afghanistan.
   Meanwhile, Afghanistan's official Radio Kabul reported
government soldiers reopened the strategic Salang highway linking
the capital of Kabul to the Soviet Union.
   The broadcast, monitored in Islamabad, said more than 1,000
supply vehicles reached Kabul.
   Western diplomats have said that for the past several weeks
supply convoys were backed up along the Salang highway north of
Kabul because of rebel attacks and blockades.
   Radio Kabul declared, ``This highway is open forever.''
   The Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1979
to help the Marxist government battle the anti-communist
guerrillas. There were more than 100,000 Soviet military personnel
in Afgnaistan for years, but the Kremlin withdrew the last of its
combat forces in February under a U.N.-brokered agreement.
   Western diplomats have said more than 300 Soviet military
advisers remained in Kabul.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first nationwide election with a legal
opposition has produced Taiwan's spiciest campaign ever, featuring
a crop of candidates who are ignoring long-time political taboos in
their search for votes.
   One candidate, dancer Hsu Hsiao-dan, has ignored other taboos as
well, distributing posters of herself in a topless pose as she
campaigns on the Labor Party ticket for worker welfare, love and
political freedom.
   Legislative, mayoral and other local elections will be contested
this coming Saturday by 724 candidates in the first balloting since
the 1987 scrapping of martial law, which outlawed opposition
political groups.
   Fifteen political parties are fielding candidates against the
Nationalist Party, which has governed this island of 20 million
people since losing a civil war to Communist forces on the Chinese
mainland 40 years ago.
   The new political climate has brought forth several first-time
candidates who are attracting attention with daring political ideas
or provocative campaign tactics.
   Among those receiving the most serious notice is Yeh Chu-lan,
whose husband burned himself to death in April to avoid police
interrogation over his advocacy of an ``independent Taiwan.''
   In the local political lexicon, independence means rejection of
the Nationalist claim to be the legitimate government of mainland
China as well as Taiwan.
   Miss Yeh, 40, is among 32 of the 163 candidates from the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party openly campaigning for an
independent Taiwan despite Nationalist threats that they could face
arrest on sedition charges.
   Her alliance is advocating ``a new country, a new culture,'' a
slogan that no doubt is anathema to Nationalist elders.
   ``Taiwan has in fact been independent for the past four
decades,'' said Miss Yeh. ``We need to build a brand-new country
from this reality rather than making slow reforms within an
authoritarian system.''
   If reunification occurs, she argues, Taiwan will surrender its
economic prosperity under a Communist system directed by Beijing.
   But many Taiwanese are skeptical about her movement, largely
because Beijing has refused to rule out the use of force to bring
about reunification if Taiwan declares independence.
   Local newspapers, which long refused to publish anything but the
official Nationalist line, have provided extensive coverage of the
alliance and called for the protection of the candidates' freedom
of speech.
   Another candidate testing the new political climate is Wang
Chin-ping of the newly formed Workers' Party, who is seeking a seat
in the lawmaking Legislative Yuan as a socialist.
   Only a few years ago, anyone advocating anything close to
socialism would be considered a Communist, the ultimate evil in the
eyes of the Nationalists.
   But Wang has run an unfettered campaign as he calls for
``peaceful reforms'' to provide more social welfare benefits and to
prevent big business from using government connections to evade tax.
   Wang, 44, usually begins his campaign day at dawn by joining
city workers sweeping Taipei's streets and gathering garbage. He
remains on the streets throughout the day soliciting votes from
factory workers, taxi drivers and shop clerks.
   ``This country needs someone to speak for the oppressed,'' says
Wang. He says his campaign staff includes students and workers who
have been penalized or dismissed from jobs for organizing unions.
   Wang, who owns a small book store, was dismissed from the
prestigeous Tamkang University eight years ago for criticizing the
Nationalists' authoritarian rule.
   Perhaps the most controversial candidate is the dancer, Hsu
Hsiao-dan, 30. She appears topless in a campaign poster that also
shows her holding a bouquet of roses in one hand as she sets fire
to pieces of paper bearing the names of famous political prisoners
she says are victims of a Nationalist-controlled judicial system.
   Miss Hsu, wearing a floral band around her long hair,
distributes the poster, sings and lights up cigarettes for

<TEXT>
   Smack out here in the desert is an oasis of
another kind _ the Rest House and Modern Youth Saloon, where a
traveler can quench a thirst and get an earful of Mohammed Khoury's
tongue-in-cheek philosphy.
   ``Welcome in Jordan,'' he intones from the command post behind
his bar. ``Welcome in Maan. Welcome in my guest house. Dutch beer?
German beer? Tea? Pepsi? Welcome.''
   The place is his own museum of kitsch and memorabilia: clocks,
photographs, electronic gadgets, American cars, stamps, guns,
garden gnomes, visiting cards, foreign money.
   More than 100 clocks, most of them ticking, surround the bar and
lounge, which are flooded by dozens of red lights, including some
inside mushroom-shaped plastic stools.
   On the hour, a chorus of cuckoo clocks and electronic beeps
drowns conversation.
   Khoury, 66, opened the rest house in Maan 120 miles south of
Amman, the capital, in 1972.
   It was frequented mainly by long-distance truck drivers on their
way from Europe to Saudi Arabia. As many as 40 trucks a day stopped
by, but a new road has been built and nowadays customers are few.
   Maan is a town of 25,000 people, mainly traders, truckers and
farmers of Bedouin stock. The little oasis on the old Islamic
pilgrimage route to Mecca is surrounded by a flat, monotonous
desert.
   Khoury's brand of philosophy, and the accoutrements with which
he surrounds himself, echo psychedelic hangouts in places other
than a sun-baked outpost like this.
   He philosphizes: ``Life without a wife is like a kitchen without
a knife. Another beer?''
   Khoury must have one of the largest collections of portraits of
King Hussein, big even for Jordan, where portraits of the monarch
are everywhere.
   The king is seen in dress white military uniform, wearing a
traditional keffiyeh headdress, in a pilot's uniform, with each of
his four wives, with his children, as a young monarch.
   Hussein can be found dressed for soccer, cricket, riding,
driving, flying, and meeting dozens of Arab and other leaders,
including George Bush before he became president.
   Electronic detectors beep, crow, ring, or squeal whenever
someone enters the lounge or strides around the room.
   Western rock or Arabic music blares from one of the six stereos
behind the bar. Four television sets are in various states of
repair.
   Khoury pulls out his stamp collection. Dozens are from Germany's
era of hyperinflation in 1922. One 100-mark stamp is overprinted
``100 billion marks.''
   In a garage outside sit two Chrysler New Yorkers, a Plymouth
Volare and an Oldsmobile Toronado.
   Khoury just sold a Dodge camper and he mourns: ``Bed inside.
Fridge inside. I was crazy. Crazy to sell it.''
   Amid the red ceiling fans, red cushions, red chairs and red
carpets, Khoury recounts his childhood and shows a 1932 photo of
himself standing beside his father who wears a traditional white
headdress.
   Although his family is from Bethlehem, birthplace of Jesus in
what since 1967 has been the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Khoury
says he has spent much of his life in Maan.
   Hundreds of business cards and currency from all over the world
attest to his cosmopolitan clientele, but Khoury says the bar may
be in danger of being closed down.
   Moslem fundamentalists in Jordan are calling for a ban on
alcohol.
   ``They're trying to ban the rest house,'' he said. ``They're
waiting for me to make a problem, so they can close me down.''
   He opened a drawer under the bar to display a collection of
guns, picking them up one after the other, raising them above his
head.
   ``I'm ready for them,'' he said.

<HEAD>Memories of Spring Still Fresh as Beijing Settles in for Winter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only a handful of police remain where soldiers
and tanks filled Tiananmen Square in June, and in place of sandbags
on the streets are piles of cabbages.
   Hundreds of thousands of tons of cabbages have been dumped on
sidewalks throughout Beijing as people stock up for winter _ with
memories still fresh of a bloody spring.
   Some try to get rid of the memories.
   ``I don't think about it,'' a receptionist said. ``I just come,
do my job and go home. Nobody bothers me and I don't pay attention
to anyone.''
   In the spring, the young woman had stayed at her workplace, not
daring to go home for four days after the violent crackdown, which
left hundreds if not thousands dead. Thousands more were arrested
in nationwide sweeps that continue.
   Her neighbor, who was in his early 20s, was killed by a
soldier's bullet the night of June 3 after he went into the streets
to see what was happening.
   The youth's father was ordered to write an essay on how he had
failed to educate his son properly; there was no funeral.
   ``Are you kidding?`` the woman said sarcastically. ``He was a
`counterrevolutionary,' a `thug'.''
   A sullen mood prevails at Beijing's universities.
   In early November, investigators questioned students on the
campus of Beijing University, which was at the forefront of the
protests. All students were warned at rallies to cooperate with the
investigators or they could end up being questioned instead by the
police.
   ``People are still very nervous,'' said a student at the
university who took part in the protests of May and June. ``We
don't know what they will do to us next.''
   A student at Beijing Normal University, another of the activist
schools, declined to meet a foreign acquaintance.
   ``Things are still quite tense,'' she said. ``They're still
investigating people, you know.''
   She said she feared her chances of getting a passport to study
overseas would be in jeopardy.
   On Tiananmen Square, a few dozen People's Armed Police have
replaced army soldiers standing guard. People can enter the square
only with written permission from a work unit.
   The souvenir photo stands have returned, and families come to
have their pictures taken in front of the Gate of Heavenly Peace.
   For 30 fen (8 cents), they can see the Military History Museum's
special exhibit on putting down the demonstrations. Outside the
museum are several burned out tanks and army trucks that became
victims of the crowds when the army thundered in to seize Tiananmen.
   Inside are hundreds of photos of the students who occupied the
square for three weeks. Nearby are smashed loudspeakers,
confiscated Molotov cocktails and newspapers from overseas wrongly
declaring that senior leader Deng Xiaoping had died and that
Premier Li Peng had been shot.
   One section devoted to soldiers who were killed displays their
bloodied clothing, firearms and diaries. There is nothing about
civilian casualties.
   Attendance has also slackened off, from 40,000 visitors a day in
August to about 2,000 now.
   Meanwhile, government television has dropped its drumbeat of
attacks on the ``counterrevolutionary turmoil,'' but
government-produced films showing soldiers being beaten and burned
are still shown.
   One newspaper reported recently that soldier Tian Yuejun had
named his newborn son Pingbao _ ``Putting down the turmoil'' _ so
the child ``will always remember how his father took part in
serving the country and putting down the counterrevolutionary
turmoil.''
   Martial law, imposed on most of Beijing on May 20, remains in
effect, although military sentries were replaced by regular police
Nov. 1.
   ``Nobody feels good will toward the People's Liberation Army or
the People's Armed Police,'' a taxi driver sneered. ``But we're
more scared of the armed police. They've been trained in kung fu
and karate and will be much quicker to beat us up.''

<HEAD>Cyprus Becomes Key Mideast Listening Post for Major Powers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN MARRIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States, the Soviet Union and
China are building large new embassies in Nicosia, adding new
emphasis to Cyprus as a key Middle East listening post.
   The divided island in the eastern Mediterranean has more foreign
diplomats, intelligence agents, foreign soldiers and journalists
than larger Arab capitals.
   Its importance as an intelligence-gathering base grew as
Westerners fled war and terrorism in Beirut.
   ``Cyprus really is on the crossroads,'' said Vladimir A.
Chizkhov, first secretary at the Soviet Embassy.
   ``It's a small country but definitely its role is greater than
its size, because it's on the threshhold of the Middle East, and,
of course, it is also the location of the Cyprus problem.''
   Cyprus has been divided since the Turkish army invaded in July
1974, to keep the island, which has a Greek majority, from uniting
with Greece.
   The Turks seized the northern third of the island, which the
Turkish Cypriot minority declared a breakaway republic in 1983.
Only Turkey recognizes it.
   While Greek Cypriot newspapers have described the new Soviet
embassy as a ``palace,'' the U.S. Embassy under construction right
across the street is called a ``fortress.''
   The $30million American building is designed mainly to be secure
against attack. Some walls are nearly three feet thick. Set well
back from the street, the building is surrounded by a high concrete
wall and a double fence.
   Direct access is impossible. Visitors must enter through a gate
away from the main building, then make a sharp turn left and pass
through another gate.
   Metochiou Street, on which U.S. and Soviet embassies are
situated, has gained the nickname ``Microwave Alley'' because of
the potential for the two superpowers to spy on each other.
   The graceful, colonnaded entrance to the new Soviet chancery is
in sharp contrast to the American building; only minimal security
is in evidence.
   The new Chinese embassy is done in pagoda-like architecture.
   Nicosia also has an Israeli Embassy and a mission of the
Palestine Liberation Organization. Israeli Mossad secret service
operatives move about the island along with senior PLO figures, and
Libyan and Syrian agents.
   Iran opened an embassy recently. Canada set up an immigration
office to deal with the flood of Lebanese and Iranians seeking
visas.
   International news organizations, including The Associated
Press, have set up Middle East listening posts in Nicosia as well.
One of their tasks is to monitor Iran's television and radio
broadcasts.
   Cyprus has excellent telecommunications and airline links with
the region.
   Complicated shortwave antannae, large satellite dishes and other
electronic gear litter the roofs of many buildings in Nicosia,
while on the 6,000-foot summit of Mount Olympus, is ``the
golfball,'' a large white geodesic dome that conceals British
electronic surveillance antennae.
   Nearby Ayios Nicolaos is the base for Britain's 9th Signals
Regiment, which conducts electronic intelligence-gathering from the
forested mountains.
   U.S. U-2 reconnaissance planes fly out of the British Royal Air
Force base at Akrotiri on the south coast.

<HEAD>Changes in Eastern Europe Challenge Old Assumptions</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is not an insurmountable opportunity, as
one senator observed, but there is a challenge in the changes the
administration and Congress will face because of the peaceful
revolutions that are transforming Eastern Europe.
   Those changes are shaking assumptions and premises that have
been the conventional wisdom of U.S. policies and politics.
   Now, suddenly, nations that were part of the enemy camp have
their own miniature New Deal programs of U.S. aid, complete with
American acronyms. The Support for Eastern European Democracy Act,
SEED for short, will provide nearly $1 billion worth of aid over
three years, most of it for Poland, a small slice for Hungary.
   The Pentagon already is at work on preemptive pruning of defense
budgets, knowing that unless it starts cutting, Congress is likely
to start slashing.
   Political tenets that have stood for decades are going to be
changing. In national election campaigns, Republicans usually have
been in command of the national security issue, Democrats often
defensive about it. To dramatize his support for the military,
Michael Dukakis rode around in a tank and wound up looking silly,
in one of the memorable images of the 1988 campaign. Next time,
that trip may not be deemed necessary.
   The administration is concerned about wholesale cuts in defense,
and about pressures for swift withdrawal of American forces from
western Europe. That's where the big defense money is, more than
$150 billion a year, with some 305,000 U.S. troops stationed there.
That posture was built around the danger of conventional attack
from the East, a risk Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney says is now
very unlikely.
   The sudden change in the East makes that money an inviting
target in the era of deficit woes, and not only for Democrats. The
peace dividend could be the change that permits President Bush to
stand permanently on his campaign promise against new taxes.
   Nevertheless, the administration is firmly against rapid cuts in
manpower there, Vice President Dan Quayle saying that would be
precipitous and risky. Cheney said U.S. force reductions must be
negotiated, not unilateral. Bush proposed a reduction to 275,000
men on each side, and that is under negotiation now.
   ``What you want to do first of all is build down to parity,''
Cheney said in an NBC-TV interview, noting that the Soviet Union
still has about 380,000 troops in East Germany, Berlin Wall or no
wall.
   Those warnings may be difficult to enforce in a government beset
by budget deficits.
   ``Ultimately, if you're going to save money in the defense
budget, you're talking about a reduction in the combat forces
committed to Europe,'' Cheney said. ``It may be possible, long
term, for us to do that.''
   Short-term, the pressure are building, with suggestions that
both sides cut back quickly.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said the United States and NATO should be
thinking about a response should the Soviet Union offer to remove
all foreign troops from European nations within a few years.
   Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said any
such proposition should be handled with care. He said the
administration ought to be ready because Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev might produce that kind of dramatic peace move at the
seaborne summit Dec. 2 and 3.
   Donald Atwood, the deputy secretary of defense, said western
nations should work for economic well-being in the Warsaw Pact
nations lest instability jeopardize the movement toward freedom in
the old Soviet bloc.
   But Atwood's message also came with a caution signal: ``Now is
not the time for unilateral disarmament. Now is not the time for us
to talk about a lessening of the impact of NATO.''
   When Bush went to the NATO summit six months ago with his call
for negotiated cuts in conventional arms, the modernization of
short-range nuclear missiles in West Germany was a companion issue.
That was shelved until 1992, a concession to the Bonn government,
which faced widespread domestic opposition to the new nuclear
weapons.
   There is no prospect now that those aging U.S. weapons will be
upgraded, and the administration knows it, although no one is
saying so openly.
   At the same time, Cheney argues that the changing situation puts
an even greater premium on strategic weapons. He said the Soviet
Union is modernizing its arsenal. ``They are not giving up,'' he
said in the TV interview. ``Indeed, they are improving their
strategic nuclear capability.''
   Countering that in a shrinking defense budget is going to be
increasingly difficult. And there is concern in the administration
that Congress may try to deal with the new situation with old
habits _ by insisting that the reductions spare its political
favorites. Cutting the budget will mean shutting down bases, and
not just in West Germany. It also is going to cost defense
contracts, which means business and jobs.
   The changes are not going to be politically painless.
   ``Unlike the old comic strip character Pogo, we are not
confronted with insurmountable opportunities,'' Sen. Carl M. Levin,
D-Mich., said the other day. ``We are confronted by great western
value-affirming opportunity.''
   It does carry a price.

<HEAD>Former ABC Insider Tells Story Behind Network's Sale</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

   Huntington Williams' inside story of the
decline and sale of ABC is the kind of history that most people
don't want to be a part of.
   A high-ranking ABC executive heaved a sigh of relief after
reading the book. ``Thank God,'' he said, ``my name's not in it and
I'm not a source.''
   There are few heroes in ``Beyond Control: ABC and the Fate of
the Networks,'' written by Williams, a former speechwriter for ABC
founder Leonard Goldenson. Williams worked at ABC from 1981 to 1985.
   Goldenson and former ABC president Elton Rule are two of the
book's good guys, who led ABC to network leadership in the 1970s.
But in Williams' account, Rule's successors squandered their
inheritance and eventually forced the sale of the network to
Capital Cities.
   ``ABC was the most interesting of all the networks,'' Williams
said in an interview. ``The secret of ABC was that it gave all
these young kids a chance to cut their teeth developing programs.
Eventually the brilliant programmers left. That left Fred Pierce
and Tony Thomopoulos to run the network.''
   ``Beyond Control,'' published by Atheneum, is at times as
provocative as the movie ``Network.'' It tells of management
brilliance and management failures, of sexual peccadillos and such
goofiness as putting a psychic on the network payroll.
   Richard Connelly, an ABC public relations executive in New York,
said the company had no comment on the book.
   Goldenson held ABC together almost with spit and chewing gum in
the 1950s. He came out of the movie industry and brought Hollywood
and television together, first with Walt Disney, then with such
shows as ``Maverick,'' ``The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp,''
``Cheyenne'' and ``77 Sunset Strip.''
   In the 1960s ABC was something of a joke. ``Put the Vietnam War
on ABC and it'll be over in 13 weeks,'' one joke went.
   The turnaround began in 1968 when Rule moved into top
management. One top ABC executive, Barry Diller, developed the
``movie of the week'' concept. Another, Michael Eisner, developed
the series ``Happy Days.'' (Diller is now chief operating officer
of 20th Century Fox. Eisner is chairman of Disney.)
   Fred Silverman, lured from CBS, built a schedule that made ABC
first in the ratings. The one-time third network was now the
richest network and the biggest moneymaking advertising vehicle in
the country.
   After Silverman left for NBC, ABC coasted for a while, then fell
to third place.
   Williams tells how ABC lost producer-creator Stephen Cannell,
who took his next show, ``The A Team,'' to NBC where it became a
huge hit. The book tells how ABC lost ``The Cosby Show,'' which put
NBC in first place, after it had been offered by two former ABC
executives, Tom Werner and Marcy Carsey.
   The events that led to the sale of ABC to Capital Cities were
set in motion, according to Williams, by an overheard telephone
call.
   ``A secretary misinterpreted the call and thought her boss was
trying to sell the company,'' he said. ``That alerted Wall Street.
Then the Federal Communications Commission briefly considered
changes that would allow the networks to own their affiliate
stations. Since the bloom was off the oil industry, the networks
looked to Wall Street to be ripe for huge profits.
   ``Wall Street was just waiting for ABC to go into play. Then ABC
missed `The Cosby Show.' That was the drama that led seven months
later to ABC being sold. The fact that it could be done in a
friendly manner led to changeovers at the other networks. ABC was
the only network bought by broadcasters.''
   Williams resigned from ABC after the purchase but before it
became effective in January 1986. He immediately began work on the
book.
   ``Most of the information I got from interviews,'' he said. ``I
learned more about broadcasting than I ever wanted to know. I was
trying to make sense of what I had seen. It was the end of a
dynasty. At the time Goldenson didn't seem to be an imposing man.
But he was a giant.''

and ``L.A. Law,'' created ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' as his first show

   Jeanne Sharp, whose ancestors lived and
farmed in this rural New York community before the American
Revolution, is learning a hard lesson about rebellion: Governments
often fight back.
   Sharp and more than 300 other residents who filed a lawsuit
trying to block construction of a garbage incinerator are in turn
being sued, by lawmakers.
   ``I've been thinking a lot about Ethan Allen,'' said Sharp. ``I
have some idea of what my ancestors went through to get here.
   ``If they can put up with it, so can I.''
   Residents sued Washington County and adjoining Warren County
last year over the proposed incinerator, which is to be built in
Hudson Falls, about 40 miles north of Albany, to burn garbage for
both counties. They contend that local officials approved the plan
without a proper public hearing.
   The counties and their industrial development agency
countersued, seeking $1.5 million from 320 plaintiffs, most of them
Washington County residents. Washington County later dropped out,
but Warren County and the IDA remain.
   The residents, recognizable around the area by the bright orange
``PLAINTIFF'' bumper stickers affixed to their cars, say the
countersuit was filed to harass them into dropping their lawsuit.
   Environmentalists say it could have national implications for
other citizen action groups that turn to the courts to challenge
controversial projects. The environmental movement even has a name
for it _ a SLAPP suit, or Strategic Lawsuit Against Public
Participation.
   ``It's a strategy to hush people up and stop them from speaking
out,'' said Lois Gibbs, who led the fight over the Love Canal toxic
dump in Niagara Falls and now runs the Virginia-based Citizens
Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste.
   ``This case stands out as the only one of its kind that I know
of where government chooses to sue its own people,'' said Will
Collette, Citizens Clearinghouse's SLAPP suit expert.
   Other SLAPP suits, which Collete calls ``legal terrorism,'' have
been brought across the country by private companies involved in
projects. ``The idea is to squash the opposition.''
   People who bring SLAPP suits don't expect to win them, he said.
``They all get dropped. They never go to trial. Warren County has
no expectation of winning its case.''
   In Washington County, some supervisors told people they might
lose their homes or cars as a result of the countersuit, the
plaintiffs claim.
   ``They're trying to harass us and intimidate us down to a
handful of manageable troublemakers,'' said Melody Brown, who
admits to being one of the more vocal incinerator opponents being
sued.
   The countersuit contends the citizens' lawsuit was frivolous and
that actions by the incinerator opponents, during the sale of bonds
for the project, cost the counties $1.5 million.
   ``At the original closing date for the bond sale, there were
committed purchasers. As the result of the activities of the
citizens, those contracts were abrogated, it was necessary to enter
into new contracts, and passage of time and a change in the market
brought a $1.5 million loss,'' said Benjamin Pratt, a Glens Falls
lawyer for the counties and IDA. That loss increased the cost of
the project and with it the cost of burning garbage.
   Now the incinerator opponents want to add more litigation to the
fray _ a federal civil rights lawsuit in response to the lawsuit
against them. They've hired Atlanta-based civil rights lawyer
Robert Remar.
   ``The First Amendment to the Constitution gives all of us the
right to freedom of speech, freedom of association and the right to
petition government for redress of grievances,'' said Remar. ``When
a government seeks to basically punish the citizens for having
exercised those rights, that's a violation of the Constitution.''
   Pratt said the counterclaim doesn't violate anyone's civil
rights.
   ``They have the right to speak with respect to the proceedings
and actions being taken by the government. They have a right to sue
their government if they feel that something is done improperly.
But they don't have the right to ... perform in such a fashion that
they interfere with the contractual rights that the government has
with third parties and cause a $1.5 million loss.''
   Hammond Robertson, chairman of the Warren County Board of
Supervisors, said he supports the counterclaim, as has a majority
of that board every time someone moves to drop it.
   ``I have to recognize that people have some strong feelings on
this issue,'' said Robertson. ``But there are 110,000 people in
these two counties. We have some obligation to the other 100,000
people.''
   While the lawsuits go on over the $80 million incinerator _
resolution isn't expected until some time next year _ excavation is
nearing completion at the plant site next to the Hudson River.
   Meanwhile, the incinerator has hit a legal snag in yet another
lawsuit. A state judge ruled that the state should have required
more environmental assessments of the project before renewing its
latest permits. That suit was brought by the village of Hudson
Falls. Construction has stopped while the state considers whether
to appeal.
   The main point of the original lawsuit, whether there was a
public hearing on the project, is still in dispute. While Robertson
said a hearing wasn't required, Pratt said the two-county IDA held
one.
   Stephanie Wenk, another active incinerator opponent, said the
IDA hearing lasted just 45 minutes and that everyone wasn't allowed
to speak.
   ``The public hearing was a sham,'' said Wenk, who has been known
to tie a gag over her mouth at supervisors' meetings. ``They let 11
people speak out of 49 ... Then they just banged the gavel and that
was it.''

   The hut was little more than an
oversize, insulated packing crate, its lone window smashed, the
plywood door torn off its hinges, the roof caved in, and a slice of
its metal skin bent by a crowbar.
   Mariyam Khachaturian gazed at it gratefully.
   She saw a home.
   It would be her first home since the Armenian earthquake of Dec.
7, 1988, which killed at least 25,000 people, including her
husband, daughter, son-in-law and 2-year-old grandson. Since then,
she has traipsed from the cramped, makeshift home of one relative
to another.
   The forlorn, damaged one-room hut was one of dozens dumped at a
railyard on a plain beneath snow-capped mountains outside
Leninakan. Thousands of the one- and two-room shacks intended to
shelter Armenians left homeless by the quake were vandalized during
Azerbaijan's two-month blockade of Armenia.
   The blockade and the vandalism are part of an ethnic conflict
between Christian Armenians and Moslem Azerbaijanis in which more
than 120 people have been killed since February 1988.
   ``What kind of people can do this?'' asked Lida Gregoryan, a
Leninakan teacher, as she gazed at the destruction of the cubicles,
generously dubbed ``little houses'' in Russian.
   She gestured toward Mrs. Khachaturian. ``Their grief is not
enough? And now this?''
   The blockade halted transport within Armenia for lack of fuel
and forced factories to close for want of raw materials, official
media have reported.
   The homeless suffered most.
   ``Isn't the Earth big enough for us and them?'' asked Mrs.
Khachaturian's friend, Khohazh Melkonyan, referring to the
Azerbaijanis.
   Tensions between the neighboring Soviet republics in the
mountainous Caucasus date back centuries, but they now focus on
calls for the Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian area
within Azerbaijan, to be transferred to the jurisdiction of Armenia.
   The government in Moscow, struggling to preserve order in the
violence-torn republics, has assumed administrative control of the
disputed region in an attempt to neutralize it.
   Some Azerbaijanis have said the blockade was merely a side
effect of a general strike on the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. Others
say supply lines to Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh were cut to
pressure the Armenians into dropping their territorial claim.
   When the Azerbaijani popular front agreed to end the blockade
and Soviet troops moved in to protect the trains, Soviet television
showed Armenian rail workers flinging open boxcar doors to find
potatoes crawling with maggots. Weeks in the hot southern sun had
ruined all the fresh food.
   There was more. Looters had stolen boxcar loads of construction
supplies and stripped the little prefabricated shelters intended
for quake victims.
   ``It was like a second earthquake,'' said Meruzhan Garpetyan,
whose family is now living in a small stone house they built
themselves.
   Karlin Ambartsumyan, chairman of the Leninakan Communist Party,
said 90 percent of the cargo was unusable.
   Slabs of pre-formed concrete were smashed, and tankcars of
cement were diluted with sand, he said. Authorities have said
mixing too much sand in the concrete used for construction of
apartment buildings and schools was one of the reasons so many
buildings collapsed in the earthquake.
   Valera Hairiyan, a worker at the Masis cargo station outside
Yerevan, Armenia's capital, said cargo on trains from Azerbaijan
was still being vandalized or stolen, even though soldiers are on
the trains. He pointed to construction huts that had just arrived
with their exterior panels pried off.
   Inside one hut, a rolled-up manifest listed what had been inside
_ four beds, two small tables, a chair, a radio, a wardrobe, a
sink, water pump, lights and a heating system. The hut arrived with
a single bedspring, a pair of broken stools and a smashed radio.
   Despite the damage to the huts, Mrs. Khachaturian and others in
a crowd waiting at the Leninakan railyard said they would be happy
to find any shelter.
   ``Winter is coming. What are we going to do?'' asked Aida
Gasaryan, whose husband died in the quake, leaving her with three
children. Mrs. Gasaryan said she has been living in the streets or
with friends.
   The next man in the group said he and his wife have made their
car their home, and they fear they will still be there when the
temperature drops to 30 degrees below zero, as it usually does.
   The Armenians are furious with the Azerbaijanis for the hardship
inflicted upon them, but some also accuse President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and the government of letting the blockade continue for
two months without taking steps to stop it.
   ``Couldn't the government do anything?'' asked Mrs.
Khachaturian's friend Melkonyan. ``Are they so weak?''

Greenland, a former Danish colony 10 years into home rule, is a forbidding
land of immense ice packs, serious social problems and chronic unemployment.
It has the world's highest suicide rate. But now this bad luck island may
have received a pre-Christmas present no one expected: GOLD.    ___</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANK POWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NUUK, Greenland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just when things were looking bleakest in
this ice-bound island of 53,000 people and 1,800 oxen, nature came
to the rescue.
   Until a few months ago, this is how things looked:
   The U.S. Air Force was closing Greenland's only international
airport and the four radar stations it supplied.
   A Canadian-owned lead and zinc mine was closing, and off-shore
oil exploration so far has proved fruitless.
   There was chronic unemployment _ except when the fish are
running. Alcoholism and venereal disease were rampant and every
year 50 Greenlanders kill themselves. It's the world's highest
suicide rate, 129 per 100,000, more than double No. 2 Hungary's 45
per 100,000.
   All of those things still stand, but in November Danish and
Canadian geologists announced they had found gold, a
1.6-square-mile patch on the country's east coast, comparable in
size to South African gold reserves.
   A Danish newspaper, Jyllands-Posten, reported that mining could
begin in 5 years and could yield 12 tons of gold a year, which at
current prices comes to something like $150 million.
   That should come as good news to Denmark, which last year
provided semi-autonomous Greenland with $347 million, or 86 percent
of the island's budget.
   It would also pay the $30 million a year it takes to keep open
the Sondre Stromfjord airfield where a sign proclaims ``United
States Air Force Space Command.''
   There's nothing Space Age about the primeval-looking musk oxen
roaming the nearby arctic hinterland. But, provided by the
Americans, they are the only thing that flourishes around here.
   The oxen, today 1,800 strong, are the offspring of a few hundred
shaggy beasts flown here in U.S. transport planes four years ago
and set loose as a gesture of good will.
   The airfield, nestled between a jade-green fiord and the foot of
a glacier, is Greenland's only international airport, a hub of
civilian flights.
   This year the former Danish colony celebrates 10 years of
semi-independence under a home-rule system, with its own parliament
and two legislators sitting in the Danish parliament in Copenhagen.
   Some income is generated by 300 U.S. servicemen and about 2,000
Danish civilians, who pay income tax, working at the controversial
Thule radar base in the far north.
   The U.S. military has volunteered other aid besides running the
airport, which services Nuuk, Greenland's capital, 198 miles to the
south. Recently the Army Corps of Engineers offered to help with
public works projects in remote settlements.
   The gold find, which the Greenlanders will split 50-50 with
Denmark, will augment the few exploitable resources of the world's
largest island, notably fish and shrimp. There are other problems
just as formidable, such as the suicides.
   ``Alcohol is always involved, along with problems with the
girlfriend,'' says Rene Christensen, the chief physician for the
Nuuk district.
   Women had a total of 870 abortions last year, against 1,100
births.
   ``Venereal disease is 100 times higher than in Denmark,''
Christensen says.
   The economy is drained by the expensive social welfare programs
inherited from Denmark. The city of Nuuk, Greenland's largest with
13,000 people, pays $14 million a year for benefits such as
subsidized housing, kindergartens and day care centers and
unemployment. Free health service is provided by the Danes.
   The job situation, never good, was worsened by the international
campaign against seal and whale hunting, one of the main sources of
income for the Inuit people, whose life is centered on hunting and
fishing.
   ``It became shameful to be seen in a sealskin coat,'' complains
Adolf Jensen, a hunter from a small village 250 miles north of the
Arctic Circle.
   ``Today Greenlanders can't live by hunting alone, though hunter
families can supplement their incomes by using skins for clothing
and eating the meat.''
   The end of professional seal hunting has led to an uncontrolled
growth in seal herds, which has been blamed by some experts for the
sudden depletion of cod stocks several years ago.
   Greenland is a glacial land of primitive and permanent white
beauty, where dogsleds, coastal steamers and helicopters are the
main means of travel outside the towns.
   Ninety percent of Greenlanders live on the west coast of the
island, which is three-fourths the size of Australia.

<TEXT>
   Most of its 870,240 square miles is covered with ice 2{ miles
thick, but the ice-free area is still half the size of Texas.
   The southern coasts are snowless and verdant in summer, and it
was here that the Scandinavian Vikings landed 1,000 years ago and
gave the country its somewhat misleading name.
   Eric the Red, a hero of Icelandic sagas, established tiny
colonies that eked out a living for 500 years before mysteriously
dying out.
   Nuuk sits on a long strip of land between two fiords, with
mountains rising on either side like sentinels. Long rows of
publicly built five-story apartment blocks give the city an air of
drabness.
   Today four out of five inhabitants are native Inuits, who are
related by language and custom to the Eskimos of Alaska, Canada and
Siberia.
   But 60 percent of the country's administration is run by Danes.
   Jonathan Motzfeldt, who has been prime minister since autonomy
was granted, says the goal is for Greenlanders to take over
entirely. In its first autonomous decade, he says, ``Greenland
already has undergone a silent revolution,'' and he wants it to
become more self-reliant.
   Motzfeldt has announced deep cuts in social benefits, especially
to the unemployed. From now on, he says, welfare clients who refuse
a job offer in the summer will not be eligible for cash benefits.
   The Greenland government also has taken its first international
loan of about $166 million, in German marks and Japanese yen.
   Denmark's rule over Greenland dates to 1776, when it set up a
trade monopoly and established missionary stations along the coast.
   The Americans came during World War II, when Greenland was a
midway staging area and refueling stop for troop transports and
equipment on the way to the European theater.
   U.S. forces also supplied the Greenlanders with food and
essentials after the Nazis occupied Denmark, which old-timers still
remember.
   In the early 1950s the U.S. military built defense installations
across Canada, Greenland, Iceland and Scotland known as the Distant
Early Warning System, or DEW Line.
   The philosophy then was that the shortest distance between two
superpowers, as the bomber or ballistic missile flies, is over the
arctic. But the stations have become outdated and are coming down.
   The U.S. pullout from Sondre Stromfjord also is exacerbating
tensions with Greenland over the Thule radar base, an important
link for U.S. defenses in its ballistic missile warning system.
   Thule was once a tiny Inuit hunting and trapping village. Under
the U.S.-Danish Defense Agreement of 1951, the U.S. military
relocated the native people and built a big phased-array radar.
   It has been a bone of contention between the United States and
the Soviet Union, which claims the modernization of Thule in recent
years was a breach of the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty.
   Though it is a source of income for Greenland, it is a political
embarrassment for Motzfeldt, who is under pressure from leftists
who want to get rid of the base. Motzfeldt grumbles about Thule as
``that stupid radar.''
   Denmark, mindful of its commitments to NATO, supports the U.S.
position that Thule is ``non-offensive,'' and the Greenland
administration has little choice but to fall in line.
   Motzfeldt has intimated that the Americans won't be welcome in
Thule unless they agree to continue paying for Sondre Stromfjord's
civilian airport.
   ``We are not going to pay money to have the American bases
here,'' Motzfeldt says. ``On the contrary, we insist that civilian
people have the advantage of the Americans' presence.''
   Despite all of its problems, the latest news of the gold find
should help make the future brighter. For the first Christmas in a
long time, the world can truly say, ``Yes, Greenland, there is a
Santa Claus.''

<DATELINE>ILULISSAT, Greenland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A constant parade of Titanic-sized
icebergs slowly drifts with the currents of Disko Bay in sight of
this west coast fishing port.
   Spawned by the Northern Hemisphere's most productive glacier 25
miles to the south, these mountains of ice break off with a
thunderous roar and begin their silent arctic voyage.
   The barking of sled dogs, which outnumber the 4,000 people of
the town, mixes with the chugging of cutters and shrimp boats and
the hum of the fish factories in the tiny harbor.
   Against the darkened sky, the Northern Lights unfurl in wavy
sheets of red and green across the horizon.
   Ilulissat, which means icebergs in the native language, is
inhabited by Inuits who are culturally and linguistically related
to the Eskimos of Alaska and others in Canada and Siberia.
   Nearly everyone in the town, 180 miles north of the Arctic
Circle, make their living from the sea.
   Its economy is totally dependent on shrimp and halibut catches,
which the local fishermen deliver directly to the two big state-run
fish factories, employing 350 people in the peak season.
   Ilulissat, Greenland's third-largest town, also is known by its
Danish name, Jacobshavn. Denmark, which ruled Greenland for 200
years, made it an autonomous territory under the Danish crown 10
years ago.
   About 50 fishing boats, ranging from factory trawlers to one-man
cutters, operate during the summer from Ilulissat's natural harbor.
   In the winters of 24-hour darkness, many fishermen such as
Soeren Madsen go ``longlining'' on the Icefjord, a frozen fiord at
the foot of the glacier.
   ``We drive 35 miles overland across rough terrain in dogsleds to
the fishing grounds, and the temperature can fall to minus 22
degrees Fahrenheit out on the ice,'' Madsen says.
   Long lines strung with up to 100 hooks are sunk through holes
cut in the ice and then hauled up by hand from the depths.
   ``You have to return with a catch of at least 400 pounds to make
it pay,'' Madsen says.
   A typical fishing tour on the ice lasts 48 hours, during which
time the men live in low, conical tents with a Primus stove to keep
warm.
   The dog teams of 10 to 12 huskies sleep huddled together out in
the open. They are capable of running 12 hours non-stop.
   Some of the fishermen make a little extra money on the side
driving sleds for winter tourists who come to see the natural
wonders of the Disko Bay area.
   In Ilulissat, it's an unwritten law that dog sleds have the
right of way.
   Ilulissat municipality includes four small outlying settlements
of 80 to 100 inhabitants each. Beyond those tiny villages lie
nothing but the glacial ice pack, 2{ miles thick, of Greenland's
interior.
   No roads link the town with its satellite settlements. Travel is
by boat, sled or helicopter.
   The Greenlandic dog, a special breed protected by a ban on
imports of other races, is not tame, and visitors are advised not
to pet them.
   Practically every dwelling in the town has a dog team in the
yard where fish for their fodder is hung up in racks to dry.
   The dogs must be kept chained, their fangs cut. Stray dogs are
shot on orders from the authorities.
   Many hunters are embittered over an anti-sealing campaign waged
by conservationists that ruined the once-lucrative skin trade.
   In the early 1980s, environmental groups such as Greenpeace,
spurred on by French actress and self-styled animal friend Brigitte
Bardot, launched highly publicized protests against the Canadian
practice of bludgeoning seal pups to death for their prized white
pelts.
   Gruesome pictures of the Canadian seal hunt became associated in
the public mind with the Greenlanders' traditional hunt, which does
not include pups.
   Seal pups are born on the ice floes off northern Canada and are
rarely seen in Greenlandic waters.
   Prices for Greenlandic skins plunged in Europe, and the United
States, a major market, banned the import of seal skins.
   ``Greenpeace eventually apologized to Greenland, but they should
have admitted their mistake to the consumers as well,'' said Adolf
Jensen, a hunter who comes from a tiny settlement 62 miles north of
Ilulissat.

   Federal agencies sponsor more than 1,000
advisory committees a year and they exert enormous influence on the

   Quickly, now: If all the members of all the

the Capitol, would they reach (a) Annapolis, Md., or (b) a

   Fact is, you needn't bother the committees of Congress, the
judicial committees, or any of the myriad non-governmental panels
in town to build a human sidewalk to the Naval Academy. The
executive branch would do nicely for that 25-mile stretch.
   The committees of Congress make more day-to-day headlines, but
they are vastly outmanned, and some say outgunned, by those in the
administration.
   Don't believe it? According to the President's 17th And have tried,

   Among the cases recently brought to light:
   _Seven of the eight members of the scientific advisory panel
charged with reviewing pesticide issues for the Environmental
Protection Agency during the Ronald Reagan administration were
consultants for the chemical industry, including companies that
produce pesticides. In one instance, the panel persuaded the EPA to
hold off for years after the agency itself concluded that the
pesticide Alar, used on apples, should be banned because it is a
``probable'' cause of cancer in humans and a ``known'' cause of
cancer in laboratory animals. Alar's manufacturer, Uniroyal
Chemical Co., voluntarily took the compound off the domestic market
earlier this year. EPA now says it will formally announce a ban in
January.
   _Every one of the 10 non-governmental members of a particular
Agriculture Department committee created in 1987 to develop
regulatory policy on the contamination of food by microbiological
agents such as salmonella and botulism was an employee, contractor
or consultant of the food industry. Such contaminants cause more
than 7,000 deaths and 6 million illnesses each year. The
Agriculture Department argued in court that the one-sided
composition of the panel did not violate a federal law calling for
balanced representation, but in recent months has added several
members from outside the industry.
   _A motor vehicle safety panel established in 1987 by the
National Highway Traffic Safety administration to help ``formulate
the motor vehicle safety research agenda for the next decade'' was
stacked with employees and others with financial ties to the auto
industry, and not one representative of consumer groups was
appointed.
   In enacting the Federal Advisory Committee Act in 1972, Congress
recognized that such panels can be ``a useful and beneficial means
of furnishing expert advice, ideas, and diverse opinions to the
federal government.'' But then-Sen. Charles Percy, R-Ill., a
sponsor of that law, also summarized the dangers:
   ``Viewed in its worst light, the federal advisory committee can
be a convenient nesting place for special interests seeking to
change or preserve a policy for their own ends. Such committees,
stacked with giants in their respective fields, can overwhelm a
federal decision-maker, or at least make him wary of upsetting the
status quo.''
   The 1972 law requires that all federal advisory committees must
be ``fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and
the functions to be performed.'' However, never in the succeeding
17 years has a federal court altered the composition of an advisory
committee, despite many legal challenges. Though several judges
have harshly criticized panels dominated by special interests, they
have found the language of the law too vague to enforce.
   In the case involving the Agriculture Department's National
Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for foods,
government attorneys went so far as to argue that the panel met the
balanced representation requirement because the food industry
employees are also ``consumers of food.''
   An incredulous U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn interjected:
   ``But I'm sure you'll agree that the industry representatives
have a certain point of view ....''
   Government attorney Jeffrey Gutman: ``They perhaps have a
certain point of view, given their employment status.''
   Penn: ``They can't help but have, isn't that correct?''
   Gutman: ``I will permit the court to take judicial notice of any
predisposition that these individuals may have.''
   In spite of that concession by the government, Penn dismissed
Public Citizen's lawsuit, and joined other jurists in expressing
frustration with the law, which he said ``presents various
obstacles to appropriate judicial interpretation.''
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, has introduced legislation designed to
sharpen the statute's language. ``I am disturbed to find continued
litigation over basic questions'' regarding the balanced
representation requirement, he says.
   Ms. Goldman says Glenn's bill contains ``some very useful,
sensible changes,'' but she faults it for retaining a provision
that allows some federal agencies to appoint panels whose members
don't have to file even a simplified financial disclosure statement.
   A final version of Glenn's bill has yet to be drafted. That, of
course, will be done in a congressional committee.

   He's skilled with both scalpel and pen, a
surgeon with a love for words. After 32 years as a practicing
physician, Richard Selzer turned to writing full time. But it is
his intimate acquaintance with the art of medicine that make his
literary works so compelling.

   For more than a decade, Richard Selzer
lived a double life. He was a literary surgeon. He performed
delicate operations with cool detachment, then wrote about them
with a vivid intimacy.
   Eventually the balance tipped. The words took over. And Selzer
began to see things.
   ``Once you have gazed with  the artist, you see
things you would not have the third eye ofseen otherwise,'' Selzer was
saying the
other day. ``You see the details that illuminate human misery and
you are different.''
   Selzer had taken up writing at 40 in an attempt to recapture
what he felt was a lost intimacy between doctor and patient. He led
the double life for 15 years, laboring over his prose between
patients in his surgical practice at Yale-New Haven Hospital.
   During that time he wrote ``Mortal Lessons: Notes on the Art of
Surgery'' and two oth on the black market.
   ``No East German money in the West _ We are hurting ourselves,''
one placard warned, according to the official ADN news agency.
   In an unprecedented open exchange with East German television
from his modest new home on Sunday, Krenz said: ``There will be no
going back to the old conditions. The opening of the borders was
the best proof of our sincerity about reforms.''
   But many of the estimated 100,000 people who rallied in several
cities on Sunday to maintain pressure for free elections and other
democratic reforms insisted on new leaders and an end to Communist
dominance of the government.
   A poll commissioned by West Germany's Stern magazine showed the
opposition group New Forum the strongest contender, favored by 22
percent of those questioned.
   The Communists, with 14 percent of the vote, trailed both New
Forum and the Liberal Democratic Party, which has been among those
leading calls for change although until recently it was closely
aligned with the Communists.
   Krenz has promised free elections, but has not proposed a date.
   Stern said the survey was conducted by the independent West
German polling firm Forsa. It said 2,180 East Germans were
questioned but it did not provide a margin of error.
   At an East Berlin demonstration Sunday, most signs denounced
Communist rule and expressed popular distrust of Krenz, the party's
chief of security before being elevated to general secretary on
Oct. 18.
   The party's daily Berliner Zeitung reported today that some
extremists had urged countrymen to sabotage East Germany's
electrical system as a form of protest. The paper told citizens to
ignore the appeals.
   ``Whoever is producing such leaflets seeks neither
democratization of society nor economic reform,'' the newspaper
said. ``He wants only a breakdown.''
   Authorities opened East Germany's borders to the West on Nov. 9
in a bid to gain the trust of a populace demanding demand
democratic change and to try to end an exodus that was sapping the
country of young skilled workers.
   On the second weekend of free travel, nearly 3 million East
Germans crossed into West Berlin and West Germany between Friday
and Sunday, West German border police said. The vast majority have
been returning to their homeland.
   Ferry service across the Elbe River, which forms part of the
border, resumed Sunday at Hitzacker, about 80 miles southeast of
Hamburg, for the first time since 1945.
   The agency said about 30,000 Communist Party backers
demonstrated in Potsdam to show support for the government's
announced reforms.
   In his television broadcast, Krenz said he favors a new voting
law to meet public demands for competitive elections.
   He also shrugged off a suggestion he could be ousted at a party
congress to be held Dec. 16-17 and at which more leadership changes
are expected.
   The television showed Krenz's new brown concrete home with a
small garden in East Berlin's the Pankow district.
   Krenz said he had moved to the ``quiet East Berlin street''
after assuming the party leadership. He said other members of the
party's ruling Politburo were also moving out of the exclusive
Wandlitz complex.

   Alaska's top soldier was taken aback by the
openness of his host, a KGB colonel. The colonel, for his part,
seemed wryly amused at the questions from his guests. That's the
way it went when the Soviets invited a group of Americans to a
barren lookout post in the Bering Strait, a place once forbidden to
outsiders.

<DATELINE>BIG DIOMEDE ISLAND, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was an unusual open house
at this isolated Soviet outpost where 70 camouflage-clad Border
Patrol conscripts guard the back door to Europe.
   The treeless island is a rocky and gray domain in the middle of
the Bering Strait, a chokepoint for vessels operating in arctic
waters.
   Big Diomede is 25 miles from the Soviet mainland and just 2.7
miles from the U.S. island of Little Diomede and its 140 villagers.
   The border and international date line are midway between the
two islands.
   This fall, the small military garrison played host to a
four-hour visit by Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper, Adjutant General John
Schaeffer, a uniformed KGB colonel, a dozen government aides and
four U.S. journalists.
   From the advent of the Cold War in 1948 until an August 1987
crossing in 44-degree water by marathon swimmer Lynne Cox, Big
Diomede Island was strictly off-limits to Westerners.
   The Soviet Border Guards and a handful of Alaska Eskimo Scouts
warily eyed one another across the strait with binoculars,
gathering whatever intelligence they could.
   Then came glasnost and a rapid warm-up in relations between the
two nations.
   ``It was exciting to be able to do this after spending so many
years of my life looking at them from the other side,'' said
Schaeffer, who was traveling with Cowper on a 12-day, 6,700-mile
``trade and friendship'' mission through the Soviet Far East.
   Schaeffer is Alaska's ranking military officer. A major general,
he is a member of Cowper's Cabinet in peacetime and would answer to
the Pentagon in war. He commands the Alaska Army and Air National
Guard.
   ``I was impressed the most by their attitude,'' Schaeffer said.
``Things have changed and they were so open.
   ``We could have seen almost anything we wanted to if we had had
the time. We don't have that same openness in the military in the
United States yet.''
   After arriving in an orange Aeroflot helicopter, the group was
escorted through a headquarters building that includes a dormitory,
dining area, library, armory and briefing room with walls
displaying illustrations of British, French and U.S. missiles.
   A small museum has a sign over the door in Cyrillic proclaiming
it the ``room of international friendship.''
   It contains a number of souvenirs from the Bering Bridge
expedition, a group of Soviet and American adventurers who used
sled dogs, skis and skin boats last spring in a 1,200-mile
``friendship trek'' around the Soviet Far East and western Alaska.
   Bad weather in April forced the 12-member team to spend several
days on the island.
   Books, mostly paperbacks, are well-thumbed. A closed-circuit TV
set sat unused in a corner.
   Outside were fuel storage tanks for diesel generators, a
half-dozen tall radio antennae and a stairway leading up a rocky
finger to a concrete bunker overlooking the ocean.
   Lt. Col. Vladimir Starukov, a KGB Border Patrol officer assigned
to escort Schaeffer through the first week of the trip, seemed
wryly amused as he answered reporters' questions through an
interpreter.
   ``Morale is good here because conditions are so harsh and
soldiers band together,'' Starukov said. ``They're here to watch
the sea. But observation is just part of their duties, like getting
ready for battle.''
   Most of the draftees are in their teens, calendar-watchers who
slowly turn the pages on the days left in their two-year hitch.
   ``Soldiers get eight rubles a month for candy and cigarettes,''
the colonel said. ``Everything else they have. Food and shelter.
The trip home once a year is free.''
   Starukov agreed, however, that salaries are low.
   ``Mom helps out,'' he said about furlough expenses.
   Although there is occasional contact with Eskimo hunters and
fishermen from Alaska, there are no Siberian-Yup'ik or
Inupiat-speaking troops on the island.
   ``They have to take English at school, although not many speak
it,'' Starukov said.
   Slava Vasiliv is a 19-year-old sergeant from a small village on
the Volga River in the Soviet interior. He served a year near
Anadyr before arriving on the island and has another year remaining
before going home.
   ``It's not long here,'' Vasiliv said. ``Everyone has their own
interests. Their lives are full of work.
   ``It's considered a lonely place because it's on an island, but
in reality, we get a lot of guests. Correspondents. Entertainers.
People bringing in supplies.''
   Schaeffer, who was dressed in civilian clothes, joked with the
teen-age troops who clustered tightly around him when they learned
he was an Eskimo general.
   ``We both agree we'll continue looking at each other,''
Schaeffer said. ``We don't set the policy. We just do our jobs.
   ``But now they can reduce the size of the garrison because we're
such good friends. Just leave one guy to wave at us.''

   Nobody would have guessed, least of all
14-year-old Jamie White.
   But as it turned out, her keen eye for casual fashion has
brightened the lives of thousands of deprived American youngsters,
and will, apparently, for years to come.
   She was with her father and a church group on a trip to Antigua

and shorts fashioned from flour and sugar bags fluttering from a
clothesline. She liked them so much she bought them from the woman
who made them.
   ``On the plane back home, she began discussing making and
selling flour sack clothes,'' her father, Joe White, says. ``By the
time we got back home, we'd carved out a lot of ideas.''
   White and his wife, Debbie Jo, operate four Christian,
non-denominational sports camps in the scenic Ozark Mountains of
southwestern Missouri that each summer attract 5,000 children ages
8 to 18 from 44 states and 11 other countries.
   The family decided that any clothing profits would go toward
their dream of opening additional camps solely for inner city and
mentally handicapped children from across the nation.
   A non-profit foundation has purchased 150 acres on Table Rock
Lake for the new camps, which the Whites hope to open in 1991.
   Jamie, a sandy-haired 14-year-old with braces, has seen her
simple idea grow into a line of cotton T-shirts, tops, shorts,
sweat shirts, sweat pants and blue-jean vests. They are marketed
for girls 13 to 16 under the White Sands Clothing Co. label.
   White says the family-run business has sold about $200,000 worth
of clothing in its first year, mostly to Little Rock, Ark.-based
Dillard Department Stores. The Nordstrom's department store chain
also carries some White Sands garments, and Macy's has expressed an
interest in next year's lines, White says.
   Orders for next year are rolling in, and White expects business
to at least double in 1990.
   ``This is a Cinderella story, all the way. We're David competing
against the Goliaths, like Esprit and Guess,'' he says.
   A benefactor of the camps put the Whites, who had no previous
experience in the garment industry, in touch with Mike Dillard,
president of Dillard Department Stores.
   The chain liked Jamie's designs for a line of shorts and tops
like the Antigua flour and sugar bag garments and featured them in
last spring's line.
   Jamie also sold Dillard's on about 25 varieties of neon
T-shirts, shorts and tops for summer, along with knit jerseys and
jean vests adorned with dozens of costume jewelry pieces, buttons
and beads for fall.
   For Christmas, Dillard is carrying a line of White Sands sweat
shirts with holiday themes.
   ``We've just now gained the respect of stores and they're
saying, `Hey, these guys are a real company, they can really
produce clothes,''' White says.
   His soft-spoken daughter admits she doubted the business would
get off the ground.
   ``I thought it was going to be something we'd try to do but
wouldn't really get started,'' she says. ``It's really done well.''
   Jamie, the oldest of the Whites' four children, ``has an
incredible knack for seeing what will sell in department stores.
It's a sixth sense,'' her father says.
   Jamie does the designing but relies on Rick Mumford, one of
1,000 camp counselors and an art major at Southwest Missouri State
University, to actually put her ideas on fabric.
   ``The kids at camp also help me design and tell me what they
like and would buy,'' she says.
   The clothes are cut, sewn and screened at factories in Ozark,
Ava and Shell Knob, Mo. The fledgling company employs three people
full time and has about a dozen part-time workers, including a
saleswoman.
   Jamie attends trade shows in New York, where the new White Sands
lines are exhibited to buyers from major clothing companies.
   She says she gets a thrill every time she's in a department
store and sees the clothing she has designed for other teen-age
girls displayed next to big name lines.
   ``I'll see people looking through the racks and it's like, `Oh
my gosh, they're buying my clothes!''' she says.
   But that's not the greatest thrill.
   For the past 10 years, about 400 ghetto and mentally handicapped
children have spent a week each August at Kanakuk Kamps, which were
begun by White's father, Spike White, in 1954. Children can
participate in 30 sports, from baseball to horseback riding to
water skiing.
   ``It's just a joy to see those kids having so much fun doing
things they'd never get to do otherwise,'' Jamie says. ``And they
get a chance to know Christ and develop everlasting friendships.''
   What of the future for this clothes designing ingenue?
   ``I never had a dream to be a designer. I like to be outside
doing athletic things. I'd rather be a camp director.''

<TEXT>
   In 1963, Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev offered an olive
branch, releasing the leader of the Ukrainian Catholics,
Metropolitan Josef Slipyj, after 18 years in labor camps. Later
that year, John XXIII received Khrushchev's daughter, Rada, and her
husband, Alexis Adzhubei, the editor of the government newspaper
Izvestia.
   The thaw did not mean Khrushchev was softening up on religion at
home. Quite the contrary: in 1959-64, he closed about half the
churches in the Soviet Union. Religion, he predicted, would
disappear by 1980.
   Nonetheless, John XXIII saw an advantage in an opening to the
Soviet bloc. He felt the Communist governments had secured power
and little could be gained by fighting them. He also realized the
regimes themselves were seeking better relations.
   The Vatican's new policy toward the East bloc came into its own
under John's successor, Pope Paul VI. In the 1970s, the Vatican
established diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia and working
contacts with Poland.
   The pope met five times with the long-time Soviet foreign
minister, Andrei A. Gromyko, and received Nikolai Podgorny, the
Soviet president, who then had little power but bore symbolic
importance.
   Concessions from the Soviet bloc did not come easy, however. In
1971, to advance negotiations with Hungary, Paul VI asked Cardinal
Jozef Mindszenty, an outspoken anti-Communist, to leave the U.S.
legation in Budapest where he had taken refuge in 1956. Three years
later, the pope removed him as primate of Hungary.
   Paul VI was accused by critics of abandoning the ``silent
churches'' _ of which Mindszenty was a symbol _ but the strategy
bore results. In Hungary, the Vatican was allowed to name bishops
to fill vacant sees and expand religious instruction.
   The election in 1978 of Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Poland as Pope
John Paul II, another strong anti-Communist, initially marked a
slowdown in the Vatican-Soviet rapprochement.
   The Soviets criticized the pope in the early 1980s on grounds
that he encouraged the Solidarity labor movement in Poland and
condemned class struggle. For Pravda, John Paul was a ``Reaganite
and the most reactionary pope of the age.''
   On top of that came the attempt to assassinate John Paul in May
1981. Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turkish gunman, claimed he had Bulgarian
and Soviet assistance for his deed. While his allegations were
never proven, the attack further strained Vatican relations with
Moscow.
   But the rise of Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1985 marked another
dramatic turn in Vatican-Soviet affairs.
   Scores of religious prisoners were freed as Gorbachev
established ``glasnost,'' or greater freedom in public expression.
Arrests of activists plunged.
   In October 1988, the Soviet government told Lithuanians it would
return their cathedral in Vilnius, which had been turned into an
art gallery. More than 20,000 jubilant worshippers flocked to the
first Mass there in 30 years.
   The Vatican has taken advantage of what it calls the Soviets'
``new spirit.'' This year, the Holy See has succeeded in naming
bishops in Lithuania, Byelorussia and Czechoslovakia, forging
diplomatic ties with Poland and arranging a visit by John Paul to
Hungary.
   Big differences remain between the two sides, particularly over
the outlawed Ukrainian Catholic Church. But there have been hints
Moscow is prepared to soften its stance on the Ukrainians.
   ``Concrete signs of this new (Soviet) attitude exist regarding
religion: new churches are opening; they are fixing up those that
already exist,'' Cardinal Jozef Glemp of Poland said after a trip
to the Soviet Union last year.
   ``They are facts _ still sporadic, but real.''

   An invitation for the first papal trip to
the Soviet Union could be the crowning prize of Pope John Paul II's
meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The pope's long-expressed wish to visit his flock in the Ukraine
and other Soviet regions is one of the main issues expected to be
discussed during his official audience with the Soviet president
Friday.
   John Paul will want to press his case for religious freedom,
legalization of the Ukrainian Catholic Church and normalization of
the status of the church in the Baltic republics, whose annexation
by Moscow has never been recognized by the Vatican.
   But analysts say Gorbachev also will be looking for something
from the pope, such as a pledge to use his influence to stem the
nationalist movements that are threatening Gorbachev's reforms.
   Gorbachev and the first Polish-born pope do have some things in
common, including a vision of a united Europe, though with a
different emphasis. Gorbachev espouses a ``common European home,''
while John Paul sees Christianity as Europe's unifying force.
   Church and Soviet officials and John Paul himself have expressed
increased optimism that the meeting with Gorbachev will clear the
way for a pastoral visit to the Soviet Union, home to an estimated
8 million to 10 million Roman Catholics.
   The pope has ruled out a ``political visit'' limited to Moscow.
He has said he wants to travel throughout the country to visit
Roman Catholics in areas such as the Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia,
Byelorussia and Kazakhstan.
   A major roadblock remains the status of the Ukrainian church,
which was brutally suppressed in 1946 by the Stalin dictatorship
and forcibly merged with the Russian Orthodox Church.
   Ukrainian Catholics, who practice the Byzantine rite, have
emerged from the underground in the past two years to openly demand
official recognition by Moscow. By Western estimates, at least 4
million Ukrainians are Catholics.
   ``Our position is very simple,'' said the Vatican-based Cardinal
Myroslav Lubachivsky of the Ukraine. ``We want our church to be
legalized. We want to retain our Byzantine rite and we want to be
under the jurisdiction of the pope.''
   Church officials say Soviet authorities have adopted a more
tolerant attitude toward Ukrainian Catholics but point out that top
Russian Orthodox officials remain opposed to legalization. Among
other things, the Orthodox church would stand to lose hundreds of
churches it took over when the Ukrainian Catholics were persecuted.
   The pope also wants greater freedom for the church in
Byelorussia, for which he was recently able to appoint the first
bishop in more than 60 years, and for the Baltic republics of
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, areas where nationalist and
independence movements are strong. In Lithuania, an estimated 80
percent of the 3 million people are Roman Catholics.
   The Vatican is also concerned about the shortage of churches and
priests for the Catholics of German and Polish origin who live in
Kazakhstan, Tadzhikistan, Kirgizia and Soviet Georgia.
   One way the Vatican hopes to remedy the situation is by setting
up a permanent office of contact between the Holy See and the
Kremlin. This could be arranged during Gorbachev's visit and
possibly lead to the establishment of full diplomatic relations,
church officials say.

   Six months after the death of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, old taboos are breaking down in Iran. A heady
whiff of social and religious tolerance is in the air.
   But President Hashemi Rafsanjani, leader of the so-called
pragmatists, treads gingerly between preserving Khomeini's legacy
of Islamic values and opening up the country after a decade of
turmoil.
   Revolutionary radicals are already complaining that the strict
Islamic decrees imposed by Khomeini _ ``the Imam,'' or holy leader
_ are being shunted aside by Rafsanjani.
   The complaints multiply as revolutionary fervor cools amid a
palpable relaxation of the old shiboleths ranging from rejection of
the West, particularly the United States, to a puritanical
interpretation of Islamic tenets, including a strict dress code for
women.
   The creeping liberalization that followed Khomeini's death June
3 and Rafsanjani's election as president July 28 strikes visitors
as soon as they  days.

   ``Instead of worrying about hejab, the mullahs ought to concern
themselves more about high prices, food shortages, hoarding and
profiteering,'' said Farahnaz Emani, a middle-age housewife.
   She was standing in line with a couple of hundred other women in
hejab-required chadors outside a vegetable market to buy potatoes,
which overnight became scarce when retailers, seeking higher
prices, withdrew them from the market.
   ``My children are waiting at home to be fed and I've already
spent eight hours in this line,'' she complained. ``If it's not
potatoes, there's a shortage of sugar, or rice, all sorts of other
things that disappear overnight from the market.''
   The newspaper Ettelaat said the potato shortage had become ``a
test of strength between the government and the middlemen.''
   It suggested that Iran's security agencies should go after
hoarders and their secret warehouses instead of hunting foreign
spies.
   Basic foods and some other commodities are rationed and heavily
subsidized, ensuring that at least some necessities are available
at reasonable prices.
   Additional supplies can be had at vastly inflated prices on an
officially tolerated black market, but goods sold there are beyond
the reach of many Iranians.
   Shops are well stocked following the lifting of import
restrictions. The cost of some of goods has been reduced by as much
as one-third because of more liberal exchange controls.
   But the average wage comes to less than $200 a month and many
Iranians with families are forced to find second and third jobs.
   Inflation is officially pegged at 30 percent. But diplomats
estimate it is more than double that.
   In the Majlis, the 270-member parliament, deputy Abutaleb
Mahmoodi declared recently, ``The experience of the past 10 years
has made it clear that state control of the economy resulted in
nothing but considerable losses, hardship for the poor people and
rampant inflation.''
   ``One should not talk about the revolution being lost as soon as
there is discussion about using foreign resources for modernization
and investment,'' he said.
   Rafsanjani has said Iran's nationalized industries are running
at only 30 percent of capacity because of shortages of raw
materials and spare parts as well as a decade of inefficient
management.
   But another imperative is behind the drive to revive the economy.
   Iran's population is mushrooming. The birth rate is around 3.5
percent a year, one of the highest in the world.
   By the year 2010, its population will have doubled from the
present 140 million, and economic decisions must be made now to
avoid castastrophe 20 years hence.
   Despite the opposition of the radicals, Rafsanjani will have to
find solutions quickly.
   ``After 10 years of privation, the people are not prepared to
wait for long,'' said a prominent merchant sipping sweet tea with a
visitor in his office in Tehran's labyrinthine bazaar. ``The
general trend right now is in favor of Rafsanjani. If he fails to
deliver, there will be a change.''
   Failure to revive the economy within the next year or two, he
added, ``will be exploited to the fullest by the radicals.''
   Right now, the radicals have been eclipsed by Rafsanjani and his
ally, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who pushed through constitutional
reforms giving the presidency unprecedented power and opening the
door to a more secular regime.
   But the radicals are far from eliminated and Rafsanjani seems
unable to move too precipitately.
   In October, he hinted Iran might be willing to help free Western
hostages held by pro-Iranian Moslems in Lebanon.
   But he had to back off, publicly at least, a few days later
under pressure from the radicals who accused him of straying too
far from Khomeini's dictums.

<TEXT>
   A fear is growing among Colombians that
they may lose the war against drug traffickers, not through a lack
of determination, but because of a political system they see as
immature and in its worst crisis ever.
   ``Drug traffickers are not the cause of Colombia's problems;
they are the worst manifestations of a severe political malaise,''
said Clara Lopez, a former candidate for mayor of Bogota, the
nation's capital.
   Other Colombians agree with her view that the government cannot
defeat drug traffickers and their private armies through military
confrontation alone.
   Lopez said the government may be forced to rally more of the
population to its cause through political reform, staunchly
resisted in the past.
   If the government refuses reform, she added, it could face the
prospect of a society fatally wounded, not by the drug traffickers,
but by its own internal divisions.
   Lopez was one of the leaders of a splinter faction of the
Liberal Party in the early 1980s. It was headed by Luis Carlos
Galan, who later returned to the mainstream Liberal fold.
   A leading candidate for the presidential election set for next
May, Galan was assassinated by drug traffickers Aug. 18 _ a deed
that prompted President Virgilio Barco to declare all-out war on
the drug cartels.
   Lopez and other politicians of similar view maintain that while
Colombia's two main parties, the Liberals and the Conservatives,
are going after traffickers, they have failed to attack the roots
of the country's problems.
   Among these problems, they say, is a failure to encourage the
participation in the political process of many sectors of society.
   ``According to the tourist guides, Colombia is a democracy, but
the reality is quite different,'' Lopez said in an interview.
   She was referring to a small class of elites that has held power
for generations over a mass of politically and economically
dispossessed.
   In Bogota, officials in luxury automobiles, surrounded by
machinegun-toting outriders, make the daily trip into Bogota from
the wealthy northern neighborhoods, weaving around urban buses
packed with tired, perspiring people from the southern part of the
city.
   The scene in Bogota's traffic symbolizes what many see as the
alienation of the people from their government, not just in Bogota,
but in cities and rural sections across the country.
   ``In many cases people simply don't consider the possiblity that
that they have a right to determine the future of their
communities,'' said Kathy Gladden, a U.S. anthropologist who has
studied the organization of garment workers in Colombia.
   Lopez said the government, for example, has not given community
councils a say in how tax money should be spent.
   ``We have the power to change the names of public parks and
plazas, but that's about it,'' she said.
   The domination of the system by the two mainstream parties has
frustrated many Colombians and forced them to turn to political
violence, she said.
   The fate of the 4-year-old leftist Patriotic Union Party is
indicative of the perils of trying to work within the system.
Right-wing death squads have killed 737 of the party's members.
   Also threatening the country's stability, along with the drug
traffickers, are six leftist guerrilla groups.
   Javier Torres, a professor of political science at the Los Andes
University in Bogota, also contends a democratic opening is
necessary to prevent further fragmentation of Colombian society.
   He said each of the 13 presidential candidates, whose views
range from left to right, probably would carry on some sort of
reform program as president. But he added, the reforms may not be
enough or be the ones needed the most.
   Barco is to turn the presidency over to the winner on Aug. 7; he
is forbidden by the constitution from running for another four-year
term.
   Torres said that Colombian politicians, wary of destabilizing
the accepted order, have traditionally taken a cautious approach to
reforms and that the trend is likely to continue.
   He said the more conservative candidates like Hernando Duran
Dussan, a former Bogota mayor, would concentrate on improving the
country's industrial sector while moving very slowly to encourage
greater political participation.
   Duran Dussan, the epitome of the Liberal Party's old guard and
regarded as a hardliner, is one of the three front-runners in the
campaign.
   The other two, Cesar Gaviria and Ernesto Samper, are also
members of the Liberal Party, but they represent a younger
generation that is perhaps more open to reform.
   The Conservative Party, weakened by internal division, is given
little chance of winning in May.
   Torres said that while the Barco administration instituted some
important changes, such as the popular election of mayors, it has
not responded to demands for the election of governors or for other
reforms.
   Critics say the reforms needed most to keep the country from
exploding are a more efficient justice system, government financing
of presidential campaigns, the election of governors, a strict
accounting of government spending, land reform and more local
government autonomy.
   In the current judicial setup, judges lack the autonomy to
direct criminal investigations and prosecutions and must seek the
cooperation of political appointees.
   ``Investigations are often determined by political interests,
and it is in the government's interest to keep things that way,''
Torres said.
   Lopez, the former mayoral candidate, pointed to the scores of
judges slain in recent years as an indication societal tension has
risen to an intolerable point. Drastic reform is needed to prevent
an even bigger bloodbath, she said.
   ``Right now standing still in this country is the same as moving
backward,'' she said. ``If our next government is reactionary,
civil war will break out in Colombia.''
   It would not be the first time. The killing in 1948 of Jorge
Eliecer Gaitan, who was seen as a progressive leader, frustrated
Colombians' hopes for change and started a war called ``The
Violence.'' More than 250,000 people were killed from 1948 to 1953.
   According to Lopez, the government best equipped to avoid a
repetition of ``The Violence'' would be headed by someone who is
willing to change the system and is supported by a coalition of
reformists from both parties.
   At National University in Bogota, Professor Pilar Gaitan said
the election of a hardliner would ``result in a repressive
administration.'' But she added that a large segment of Colombian
society views an authoritarian approach as the only way to solve
the country's problems.
   ``Many people, faced with such a deep crisis, have moved to the
far right,'' she said.

   Blacks have been appearing in mainstream movies
ever since Erich von Stroheim first employed black actors in 1928
in ``The Wedding March.'' Until then, black characters were played
by whites in blackface.
   But the black characters Hollywood wrote into scripts were
always servants, buffoons or evil rapists who could barely speak
English.
   As a reaction to this racial discrimination, blacks from the
very earliest days of the motion picture were producers and
directors and owned their own film companies.
   Some treasures of early black cinema are now featured on a
one-hour cassette from VCI Home Video. The compilation of rare and
historic footage comes from the Black Cinema Collection of the
Southwest Film-Video Archieves in Tyler, Texas.
   The collection of 22 all-black movies from the 1930s and '40s
was discovered in a warehouse in 1983. The 35mm nitrate prints were
deteriorating in most cases, but were the last copies of the
movies, which depicted the reality of black life as opposed to the
Hollywood stereotypes.
   In the earliest days of the motion picture, black characters
were portrayed in Hollywood movies as emblems of depravity,
especially in terms of sexuality. With talkies, blacks became the
quintessence of song and dance, cast primarily as preachers,
servants or clowns. In more modern times _ and even today _ many
white filmmakers continue to see blacks in those ways.
   Independent black filmmakers emerged in the 1920s, and showed
features that reflected black life: the middle and upper-middle
class, black entrepreneurs, scientists, gangsters, entertainers,
educators, scholars, lawyers, beauty queens, cohesive families.
   More than 100 black film companies made low-budget, primarily
B-movies for black theaters. The most notable filmmakers of this
time included Noble and George Johnson, and Oscar Micheaux who made
Paul Robeson's first movie, ``Body and Soul,'' in 1924.
   Scenes from ``Body and Soul'' are featured on the video, as are
``Boogie Woogie Dream,'' Lena Horne's first movie short; ``Rufus
Jones for President,'' in which an 8-year-old Sammy Davis Jr.
dances; and ``St. Louis Blues,'' with Bessie Smith.
   ``That's Black Entertainment'' will be available on VHS for sale
or rental beginning Jan. 30. The suggested retail price is $29.95.

   ``How to Get Ahead in Advertising'' (Virgin Vision. VHS-Beta,
$89.95. Rated R)
   
   Imagine a pimple growing into a head. But not just any head _ a
replica of your own head. Only it has a mind of its own, and a lust
for power.
   Dennis Bagley (Richard E. Grant), one of the ad world's leading
stars, finally meets his waterloo when he's given a pimple cream
account. He just can't seem to master it _ he can't come up with an
idea or campaign. That's when his zit appears.
   Soon, it winks at him. Then it turns into a talking head. Bagley
blames the evil advertising world on his problem and resolves to
divest himself of all commercialism and tell the world about how
advertising dupes the public.
   The pimple, though, will have none of that do-goodism and
honesty; it wants to fill every home with products and items that
no one really needs or wants.
   The battle of the heads in ``How to Get Ahead in Advertising''
is curious, bizarre and at times distasteful. The plot becomes
almost existential, but the ending is a cop-out.
   Rachel Ward co-stars as Bagley's wife, Julia. The director is
Bruce Robinson (``Withnail and I''), who was nominated for an
Academy Award for his screenplay for ``The Killing Fields.''

   ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil'' (RCA-Columbia Home Video.
VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
   
   Two men witness a murder and are accused of doing it. One is
blind and one is deaf. Go figure.
   But the result is a riot of fun with Richard Pryor as the blind
guy and Gene Wilder as the deaf guy.
   ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil'' is a pure delight, and Pryor and
Wilder, who have paired together before in ``Silver Streak'' and
``Stir Crazy,'' are truly the Abbott and Costello of the 1980s. The
chemistry between the two comic manias is wonderful.
   In proving their innocence, the two handicapped lads have a
merry romp that includes a car chase (the blind Pryor drives),
posing as famous doctors and courting death with the real killers.
   Kirsten Childs is the perfect balance as Pryor's sister, and
Kevin Spacey is campy as one of the killers. Joan Severance, his
counterpart, doesn't hold up as well.
   ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil'' is the perfect prescription for a
gloomy day.

   Chamber music, by Francis Poulenc (London) _ Pascal Roge, piano;
Patrick Gallois, flute; Maurice Bourgue, oboe; Michel Portal,
clarinet; Amaury Wallez, bassoon; Andre Cazalet, horn.
   
   London straddles two worlds in its recent chamber music
releases, from the Slavicized Germanic tradition of Dohnanyi to
Poulenc's Gallic charm and incision. This compact disc exhibits the
bulk of the latter's chamber works for winds: the big-boned sextet;
sometimes similar sounding sonatas for clarinet, flute and oboe;
and the captivating trio for oboe, bassoon and piano.
   We hear an idiomatic interpretation of quintessential French
music, recorded in Paris. These players bring the expected high
level of wind-playing of Poulenc's country folk. Always smooth, and
never less than tasteful, they sometimes reach the level of
blandness in the sextet.
   Roge should be commended for his light, airy playuing and
attention to detail. Bourgue stands out among the winds,
particularly for his singing lines.

   ``Cindy Bullens'' (MCA) _ Cindy Bullens
   
   The guitar-based pop-rock of Cindy Bullens will sound familiar
to anyone who has heard the guitar-based pop-rock of Bryan Adams.
   But while ``Cindy Bullens'' loses points for lack of
originality, the album gets high marks as a collection of tough but
catchy songs with plenty of energy and fine singing. There's enough
variety to sustain interest, too, from the ballad ``Letters of
Fire'' to the thundering ``Cry for Love'' and the r&amp;b-styled
``Where Did I Hide My Heart?''
   Co-producer Bob Clearmountain, whose credits include Adams and
Tina Turner, comes up with a mix that's clean but still has plenty
of crunch, much of it contributed by guitarist David Mansfield.
Adams himself helps out by singing harmony on one cut.
   Bullens' closest brush with fame has been as a backup vocalist
for Elton John. She sings much of the time like Chrissie Hynde or
Pat Benatar, and it's clear she's still looking for a distinctive
sound. It's just as clear she has the talent to find it.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Actor Fiercely Dedicated to His Craft</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Do I ever shut up?'' Jack Lemmon muses.
``I'm good for 20 minutes on `hello.'''
   How true, how true. Lemmon in high gear can make Shelley Winters
seem like a wallflower. But through all the tumbling syntax comes
the picture of a man fiercely dedicated to his art yet modest about
calling it that.
   The thing to remember about Jack Lemmon is that he is a Harvard
man, born to Eastern wealth and raised with values that might seem
alien in anarchic Hollywood. He is driven in the search for
perfection, and on a number of occasions he has achieved it.
   Although opinion was divided on his latest movie, ``Dad,'' most
critics agreed Lemmon was perfect in the role of the doddering
oldster whose life is suddenly rejuvenated. The movie also stars
Ted Danson as the neglectful son and Olympia Dukakis as the
domineering wife.
   One sees a different Lemmon in ``Dad.'' He is bald, wrinkled,
frail and forgetful. He gives credit for much of his transformation
to makeup wizard Dick Smith, with whom Lemmon worked in the
prehistoric days of live television.
   After three hours in the makeup chair, Lemmon looked at himself
in the mirror and exclaimed, ``My God, I hope I live long enough to
look like this!''
   ``I thought I was 100 years old,'' recalled the actor in a
recent interview. ``I was thrilled. What it did, very rapidly
through rehearsals and through the early days of shooting, it gave
me a shell to kind of crawl into. Aside from being a great makeup
job that was convincing from the neck up, I found myself making the
rest of my body catch up to it, even unconsciously.
   ``The one thing as an actor you don't want to do is try to be
conscious while you're playing a scene as someone who's just
behaving. I don't want to be thinking about moving slowly, bending
over, shrinking, all of that. It should become second nature.
Because of the makeup and working with it during rehearsal, I was
able to do the role without thinking about it.''
   Lemmon's preparation also included studying the elderly. That's
a device that goes back to his early career.
   ``When I was a kid just out of college and couldn't even get
into a agent's office in New York, I'd put a nickle in the subway _
those were the days! _ and just spend my time riding the subway,
passing time looking at people,'' he recalled. ``I tried to guess
what they did, what their background was, watch their eyes, their
movements.
   ``Even back then I can remember noticing old people and seeing
the ones where the light had gone. It was just gone. I remember
thinking then: They're not living, they're existing. It was
something that really applied to this character (in `Dad'). In
parts of the film, when he has been so dominated, he is like a
bellboy. He even walks behind her.''
   Lemmon was still immersed in the portrayal when he reported for
a play in London. ``I was playing my own age (64), a volatile guy;
man, he's like a firecracker,'' he said. ``For the first week of
rehearsals, they were petrified. I'd say, `Let's go play tennis,'
and I sounded like I was 101. I was still walking all bent over,
and I didn't even know it.''
   The distant father-son relationship in ``Dad'' differed from his
own, Lemmon observed.
   ``I had a terrific relationship with my father, but I was well
into my 30s before I realized it was nowhere near as full as it
could be,'' he said. ``I was an only child, and I always thought we
were very close; I loved him and I knew he loved me.
   ``Once my career was really going well, I suddenly realized:
`You're much more relaxed with your dad, you seem to be having more
fun with him. I wonder why that is.' In retrospect, I thought back
and realized that I no longer had to prove myself. I had been, as
long as I could remember. It was not something he imposed. It was
something I automatically did.''
   The elder Lemmon was president of a baking company, and Jack
realizes his father would have liked his son to follow in the
business.
   ``But I got the acting bug when I was eight or nine, and I
started in summer stock in my late teens,'' Lemmon said. ``By the
time I finished college, I was ready to go down to New York and
save the American theater. I needed to borrow some money from my
father. I told him I wanted to borrow 300 bucks.
   ``He asked me, `Do you really love acting?' I said, `Yes, as
little as I've done, I know I love it.' He said, `Well, good.
Because the day that I don't find romance in a loaf of bread, I'll
quit.'''
   Lemmon starved a little in New York before finding work in
television. That led him to Hollywood, where his fourth film,
``Mister Roberts,'' won him an Academy Award for supporting actor
in 1955. The best actor award came with ``Save the Tiger'' in 1973.
Critics have predicted another nomination for ``Dad.''
   ``Once I got into live TV in my late 20s, there has never been a
serious drop when I'd have to make a comeback,'' he said. ``We all
make bad films; they misjudge, and you misjudge. That happens more
often than the hits.
   ``But I have been able to get films that have worked, not only
at the box office, but critically and with the public, often enough
so that I'm still around and I can still get some wonderful parts,
thank God. You can't get a better part than the one I just had in
`Dad.'''

   At the pull of a lever his head went down
and he began to scroll. He finished a slightly naughty little poem
in French, making sure to dot the ``i's'' and cross the ``t's,''
and looked up with an impish grin.
   He is an automaton, a sophisticated, nearly 200-year-old toy, on
display at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. He is a
curiosity in art and mechanics.
   Wearing a red satin hat and jacket with a white ruffled collar,
he kneels at a brass writing table, poised to entertain his guests.
His ``brain'' is in brass cams and clockwork motors in a large
chest underneath the table.
   The automaton writes poems in elegant, fluid script and
surrounds them with ornate borders. Translated from the French into
English, one of the four-line poems goes like this:
   ``A child by ladies adored,
   ``I am throughout all lands,
   ``in great good favor with women,
   ``and also with husbands.''
   The automaton knows three poems, two in French and one in
English. He also draws, adding intricate detail down to the needles
on fir trees outside a Chinese temple and the lines on a sailing
ship. Two other drawings are of Cupid and his love birds.
   The little mechanical boy is life-like in an eerie sort of way,
and his poems and drawings look too smooth to have been done by a
machine.
   Charles Penniman Jr. has been ``father'' to the automaton since
he began to work at the Franklin Institute 17 years ago. His pride
shows as he pulls the levers that put the little boy into action.
   ``He's naughty,'' said Penniman, an Episcopal priest and
secretary of the institute's Committee on Science and the Arts.
``He's a bad little boy and he's so damn clever.''
   Harry Bolick, a graduate student of architecture at the
University of Pennsylvania, came to the institute to see the
automaton and was fascinated by the machine's writing skills.
   ``I'm surprised by the fluidity,'' Bolick said. ``I expected it
to be digital, like a computer, but it's very, very refined. It's
Swiss engineering at its best.''
   The automaton was built in London around 1800 by Henri
Maillardet, a member of a Swiss family of clockmakers, Penniman
said. The device reflects the fascination with machines during the
Enlightenment, when clocks, music boxes and mechanical toys were
the rage.
   Maillardet made several other automatons but only one other that
could write. That one wrote in Chinese and was made for the Emperor
of China as a gift from King George III of England. It is now part
of a Beijing museum collection.
   Penniman said some automatons were made as toys for the rich and
the nobility. Others, like the Philadelphia automaton, were made
for what he called the ``gee whiz'' market and ended up in circus
or carnival exhibitions.
   The institute's automaton was among those exhibited around the
United States by a French showman named Maelzel. At some point it
was acquired by the family of John Penn Brock, a Philadelphia
lawyer, whose children gave the automaton to the institute in 1928.
At that time it was thought to have been built by Maelzel.
   The automaton had been damaged in a fire and was inoperable,
Penniman said. It was not until 1934 that an institute machinist,
Halsey T. Roberts, got the mechanical boy writing again.
   When the automaton was turned on for the first time, he revealed
the name of his creator. He wrote a poem in French and then signed:
Ecrit par L'Automate de Maillardet _ Written by the Automaton of
Maillardet.
   The automaton was first exhibited in 1936 dressed as a girl, but
Penniman's research showed the automaton originally had been a boy.
He designed new clothing for him based on a picture he found in an
English magazine published in 1826, and also carved new wooden feet
for him. The automaton has been exhibited as a boy since 1983.
   The automaton draws with a felt-tip pen. Penniman does not know
what was originally used, but said an encyclopedia article referred
to the automaton dipping a pen into an ink well.
   The toy also has the largest mechanical memory of any machine
ever constructed. Its memory is in cams, about 90 brass discs
visible through the glass in the chest under the writing table.
   The cams are turned by a clockwork motor, and three steel
fingers follow the irregular edges, translating the undulations
into movements of the automaton's writing hand.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Judging a Tears for Fears by the Cover</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You can always judge a Tears for Fears record by
its cover: the anguished child on the sleeve of ``The Hurting,''
the conventional headshot for the multi-platinum ``Songs From the
Big Chair'' and the psychedelic design on their new album, ``The
Seeds of Love.''
   ``We wanted it to be a photograph that looked like a painting,''
band member Curt Smith said of the record's colorful sleeve,
reminiscent of the Beatles' ``Sgt. Pepper'' and other covers from
the Summer of Love.
   ``We want listeners to wonder what's real and not real, what's
painted and what isn't. We also want to portray the fact that this
album was very different from the last one,'' he said.
   Smith and Roland Orzabel waited four years to release the
followup to ``Songs From the Big Chair,'' a potentially disastrous
move in an industry that can change completely in a matter of
months.
   They tried, recording songs not unlike the formula pop of their
No. 1 singles, ``Shout'' and ``Everybody Wants to Rule the World.''
But Smith and Orzabel quickly scrapped the material. Eventually,
fans stopped asking about a new record.
   ``People forgot about us, which was what we wanted,'' Smith
said. ``We could be left alone without any pressure to make music.
We wanted it to be new, fresh and we were basically bored with what
we had. The record company (PolyGram) was a bit edgy, but what were
they going to do, sue us?''
   American music _ jazz, rhythm 'n' blues, gospel _ influenced
Tears for Fears. So did the harmonies and orchestras of the
Beatles' psychedelic era. The title track of ``The Seeds of Love''
opens with the droning chords of ``I am the Walrus,'' contains a
message similar to ``All You Need Is Love'' and, in true Beatles
style, reached the Top 5 on the singles charts.
   ``We were tempted to ask George Martin, the Beatles' old
producer, to work on the record, but that was a bit too much,''
Smith said. ``Neither of us own Beatles records. We just picked the
parts we remember being on them _ cellos, highly compressed vocals
and orchestras.''
   No one would confuse these intense young pop stars with the
grinning mop tops of the Beatles' early days or the spaced out
acidheads of ``Sgt. Pepper.'' Consider ``Famous Last Words,'' a
couple's last night before a nuclear holocaust.
   ``It's about the acceptance of mortality, making the most of
what you have now. Make your life worth something now,'' Smith said.
   ``It's not just making a record, it's making a contribution to
the future. Even though we'll be gone, people will still be around.
We're not the kind of people that just accept what's going on in
the world.''
   Only in their late 20s and already they're pondering mortality.
Smith insists he and Orzabel have been that way most of their lives.
   ``We did get accused of being too advanced for our years:
`Shouldn't be talking about those subjects, they're far too serious
for people your age.' Your need is when your body tells you. The
realization of having problems is important. You can avoid allowing
them to mount up by getting rid of the other ones,'' he said.
   They met 15 years ago, joining a band when they were teen-agers.
Five years later, they chose music over school, putting out their
first record, ``The Hurting,'' in 1982. The title was appropriate.
For these two precise musicians, acts of immaturity are still
difficult to think about.
   ``I remember nothing but that being a painful experience,''
Smith said. ``The mistake of having two producers, which meant that
it was two against two. Me and Roland would fight with the
producers and get nowhere.
   ``We were ridiculously precious about the record. We wouldn't
use guitars: `We were a modern band.' The stupidity of working the
hours we did, four in the morning, five in the morning. The lack of
respect for our own bodies. All the things we went on to correct.''
   They wanted their next record to be better, and more commercial.
Something worked; ``Songs From the Big Chair'' sold more than 9
million copies.
   ``It was obvious,'' Smith said. ```Shout' and `Everybody,'
they're obvious songs. You can listen and go: `Yeah, it's a
commercial song. People are going to be singing this tomorrow.'
   ``It was much better than the first record. We tried to make a
commercial album, and that's what we did, consciously. We thought
we would use these obvious devices. We wanted to relax doing it, we
didn't want to be overly precious.''
   Control is the key _ when to have it, when to let it go. On
``The Seeds of Love,'' the voices of Smith and Orzabel are almost
lost under all those guitars, orchestras and backing harmonies.
Smith worried they were overdoing it, then reconsidered.
   ``There is a nagging in the back of your head, `Don't get
overindulgent.' But overindulgent is pretty much the way we are, in
whatever we do,'' he said.
   ``I do think we like to put a lot of care, time and attention
into doing it. It means something to us. We'd like our records to
be interesting, thought-provoking, different, experimental.''

<TEXT>
   Flann O'Brien was a comically anarchic
novelist. Myles na gCopaleen was the toast of literary Dublin for
his columns in The Irish Times. Brian O'Nolan, ex-civil servant,
was an embittered drunk.
   Each was an aspect of one man whose appearance, in the words of
biographer Anthony Cronin, combined ``elements of the priest, the
baby-faced Chicago gangster, the petty bourgeois malt drinker and
the Dublin literary gent.''
   In the recently published ``No Laughing Matter: The Life and
Times of Flann O'Brien,'' Cronin fleshes out a profile sketched 13
years ago in ``Dead as Doornails,'' a chronicle of literary Dublin
and the alcoholic corrosion of geniuses such as O'Nolan, Brendan
Behan and Patrick Kavanagh.
   Brian O'Nolan was the real name, but Cronin put Flann O'Brien in
the title because this was the internationally famous author of a
few dazzling books: ``At-Swim-Two-Birds,'' ``The Third Policeman,''
``The Hard Life'' and ``The Dalkey Archive.''
   To his drinking companions, O'Nolan was always Myles, the
columnist who spun elaborate set-ups to puns such as ``dogging a
fled horse,'' conversed with the Plain People of Ireland and
devised the Book Handling Service to provide lovingly thumbed
volumes for the pretentious illiterate.
   Taking on the thooleramawns, gawshkogues, pultogues, thullabawns
and turnip-snaggers he detected in the body politic, na gCopaleen
once devoted the best part of a year to berating the Lord Mayor for
the stopped clock above his shop, and attacked a tourism promotion
as a plot to litter Ireland with ``the scruff and sweepings of
Britain and America.''
   To Patrick Kavanagh, he was ``that poor little na gCopaleen,'' a
genius who had just missed brilliance. O'Nolan, who sneered at
penniless bohemians and was scrupulous about buying his round,
growled about Kavanagh as ``the Monaghan toucher.''
   The times of Flann O'Brien, in Cronin's view, were dreary years
in a newly independent nation governed by politicians still
mouthing the pieties of nationalism and revolution.
   ``It was also precisely because of the official hypocrisy and
the narrowness and awfulness of the official outlook there was a
good deal of anarchism in which one could luxuriate. ... We were
`agin' everything. But everything. And we were rightly `agin'
everything,'' said Cronin, now so respectable that Prime Minister
Charles Haughey attended the publication party.
   O'Nolan's father was a British civil servant but an Irish
nationalist who spoke only Gaelic at home. O'Nolan and his brothers
were educated at home until he was 11, when he was subjected to the
bruising discipline of a Christian Brothers school in Dublin _ an
encounter that Cronin believes left lasting scars.
   ``Though they were not by any means uniformly savage, the worst
of them were scarcely human at all,'' O'Nolan wrote of his teachers
years later.
   He became a published author at age 28 with
``At-Swim-Two-Birds,'' a novel within a novel in which the
characters attempt to murder the author.
   Perhaps 250 copies were sold before stocks were wiped out by
German bombs on publishers' row in London. O'Nolan's second novel,
``The Third Policeman,'' was rejected, and there were no more Flann
O'Brien books until ``The Hard Life'' in 1961.
   O'Nolan entertained wholly unwarranted hopes that ``The Hard
Life'' would be banned in Ireland _ ``the mere name of Father Kurt
Fahrt, S.J., will justify the thunderclap,'' he told a friend.
   In 1940, O'Nolan began writing the ``Cruiskeen Lawn'' column in
The Irish Times as Myles na gCopaleen (``the g before the capital C
being the eclipsis which the genitive case demands,'' Cronin
helpfully explains), later streamlined to na Gopaleen.
   The same pseudonym was used for his only book in Gaelic, ``An
Beal Bocht'' (``The Poor Mouth''), published in 1941.
   Cronin considers ``At-Swim-Two Birds'' O'Nolan's best book, but
everyone, even the author, saw the influence of James Joyce.
   ``Joyce was a hell of a problem to him,'' Cronin said, because
Joyce had used all of O'Nolan's life material, ``the very streets
through which he walked, the institutions he attended, the kind of
people he was brought up among, the Catholic religion.''
   O'Nolan was eager to have the great exile read
``At-Swim-Two-Birds'' but dismissive when told of Joyce's praise.
   In 1954, O'Nolan organized the first Bloomsday tour of all the
places mentioned in ``Ulysses.'' And on the same day, Myles na
gCopaleen attacked Joyce as an illiterate whose ``every foreign
language quotation was incorrect.''
   The republication of ``At-Swim-Two-Birds'' in 1960 brought
O'Nolan international acclaim, but by then he had lost his job, his
columns were increasingly bitter and he was customarily sozzled for
the day by 3 p.m.
   His life story was clouded with lies _ about the number of books
he had written, about a tragically brief marriage in Germany or a
trip to Paris to visit Joyce.
   ``I found him fascinating, but then I don't separate the man
from the work in that way that other people with less sense of the
work find themselves able to do,'' said Cronin.
   ``I wasn't able to separate that feeling from being in the
physical presence of the man.''
   On his only appearance on television, in 1963, O'Nolan brusquely
refused to talk about ``At Swim-Two-Birds,'' and began expounding
on his current obsession with the notion that St. Augustine might
have been black.
   ``He was not sober,'' Cronin said, ``but this might not have
mattered except that he had half a bottle of whiskey carelessly
stuffed into the pocket of his jacket and at a certain point the
neck of this began to protrude, so we were cut off rather
hurriedly.''
   O'Nolan died on April 1, 1966. A month earlier, he wrote in his
column that anyone who ``has the courage to raise his eyes and look
sanely at the awful human condition ... must realize finally that
tiny periods of temporary release from intolerable suffering is the
most that any individual has the right to expect.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: The Voice of Elvis</HEAD>

   After 10 years, singer Ronnie McDowell
has finally accepted his role as ``the voice of Elvis.''
   Until recently, the 39-year-old country music performer has
reluctantly used his voice as an Elvis Presley impersonation in
various TV shows and movies. But now he's set aside criticism that
he is just a Presley impersonator taking advantage of a dead
entertainer. These days he's embraced the part as Presley's
sound-alike and made it a main segment of his career.
   McDowell's singing voice will be used on the forthcoming TV
series ``Elvis Aron Presley,'' with Michael St. Gerard as Presley.
McDowell also was the singing voice of Presley in the 1988
miniseries ``Elvis and Me.''
   In 1979, he was Presley's voice on 36 songs in the Kurt Russell
TV movie ``Elvis.'' In 1984 he was Presley's singing voice for
another TV movie, ``Elvis and the Beauty Queen'' starring Don
Johnson as Presley.
   For the big screen, McDowell sang Presley songs for the movies
``Sweet Dreams'' starring Jessica Lange and ``Breathless'' starring
Richard Gere.
   McDowell's Presley connection began when he co-wrote and
recorded the song ``The King Is Dead'' the day Presley died in
1977. The song was a hit and McDowell became a quick celebrity
because of the record and because he sounded so much like Presley.
   But in the years following, he found that his Presley-like voice
hindered his own identity as a performer. He became known more for
sounding like Presley than for his own records.
   Now he's decided the Presley connection is a blessing.
   ``I guess because I'm getting older, I don't mind the
association,'' McDowell said in an interview. ``I think back to
when I was a kid, this was a guy (Presley) I really admired.
   ``I feel ... I should be more honored than disgruntled about it.
I've decided to embrace it and have fun with it, because I do my
own thing, too.''
   McDowell, who never met Presley, has had a steady career as a
country singer. He has released 18 albums and had No. 1 hits with
``Older Women'' and ``You're Gonna Ruin My Bad Reputation.''
   In October, he released country music's first animated music
video, ``American Music,'' which included cartoon characters much
like the movie ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit.''
   McDowell also does imitations of country stars Johnny Cash,
Marty Robbins and Ernest Tubb and jazz great Louis Armstrong.
   ``Elvis is the one the people want to hear,'' he said. ``I do
Marty Robbins or Johnny Cash equally as well. But it's always, `Do
Elvis!'
   ``When I was a little boy growing up in Portland (Tennessee),
I'd listen to the Grand Ole Opry on radio and I tried to emulate
everybody I heard. I got to the point I could sound like anybody.
And Elvis came easier to me for some reason.''
   McDowell was earning $237 a week as a lounge singer in Bowling
Green, Ky., when he recorded ``The King Is Gone,'' spending $2,800
of his own money to make the record. Within weeks, he was doing
concerts that grossed $40,000. But he actually made less than
expected off the record because of business failures by companies
associated with it. Media accounts have said the record sold 3
million, but McDowell believes it was closer to 5 million.
   The song will be revived on a ``Best of Ronnie McDowell'' album
due out soon.
   McDowell also has been told that some of his versions of Presley
songs will be included in a forthcoming album of music by ``the
king of rock 'n' roll.''
   ``This is probably the peak of anything I'll ever do. What a
thrill this is for me.''

<HEAD>Whittle Claims 1,050 Schools Have Signed Up for Channel One</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 schools have signed three-year
contracts to receive the commercially-sponsored Channel One daily
news show for the classroom that debuts in March, Whittle
Communications said.
   The 1,050 signups have already exceeded Whittle's startup target
of having 1,000 schools participating in the service by the launch
date.
   Channel One will provide daily 12-minute news programs geared
toward teens that are to be shown in classrooms during the school
day.
   The news shows also will include two minutes of paid advertising
for products such as candy bars and deodorant. The commercials have
triggered outcries from some national education groups and state
education officials in California and New York state who say it is
wrong to permit companies to pitch products to a captive audience
of students.
   Several cable networks have tailored commercial-free programs to
the school audience, notably Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc.'s
Cable News Network, which is airing a daily 15-minute news show
overnight to be taped for use in the classroom.
   But schools participating in Channel One receive free equipment
as well as programming. Each is given dozens of television
monitors, a satellite dish and videocassette recorders that Whittle
says would cost them $40,000 to $50,000 if they bought them on
their own.
   The shows are transmitted overnight to the schools for replay on
the monitors during the school day.
   Whittle Chairman Christopher Whittle said in a statement Sunday
the schools signed up to date are in 29 states, including seven of
the 10 largest, and have 739,000 students.
   He said his sales people have approached officials in 1,740
school districts, and that 440 have signed up while 221 have
rejected the service outright. Talks are continuing with the other
districts, and Whittle hopes to offer the service to schools in all
50 states.
   He said he is confident that the project will meet its goal of
having 7,000 to 8,000 schools with an enrollment of 6 million
students participating by the end of 1990.
   Whittle previously said that he has signed up advertisers who
have committed about $50 million for the first year of the service
and nearly $150 million for the first three years.
   His first-year ad revenue target is $90 million.

<HEAD>Great Northern Sets Special Meeting To Hear New Georgia-Pacific Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURAN NEERGAARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. has agreed to hold a
special meeting of its directors to discuss an offer by
Georgia-Pacific Corp. to increase its unwanted bid to buy the paper
company.
   Georgia-Pacific on Sunday raised its cash offer for Great
Northern's outstanding shares from $58 a share, or a total of about
$3.1 billion, to $63, or a total of $3.6 billion. Great Northern
has consistently rejected the takeover attempt.
   The new bid was contained in a letter from Georgia-Pacific
Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. that was delivered Sunday to Great
Northern Chairman William R. Laidig. The offer represents a 63
percent premium above Great Northern's share price prior to
Georgia-Pacific's original buyout offer of Oct. 31, Georgia-Pacific
said.
   Great Northern shares closed Friday at $61, down 12.5 cents in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Great Northern, a paper products company based in Norwalk,
Conn., had said the original offer was too low, possibly illegal
and held the potential for a disastrous debt load on the combined
company.
   Hahn also demanded a special meeting of Great Northern
shareholders and urged Laidig to meet with him personally to
discuss the proposal.
   ``We are prepared to consider an additional increase in price if
you come to the negotiating table early and demonstrate to our
satisfaction that greater value exists,'' he wrote in the letter,
which was disclosed by Georgia-Pacific.
   Great Northern officials issued a statement later Sunday saying
they would hold a special meeting of the company's directors
Tuesday to ``consider and review the terms of the revised
Georgia-Pacific offer.''
   Georgia-Pacific spokeswoman Gail Smith, reading from a
statement, said the giant, Atlanta-based forest products company
was ``pleased that they're acting so expeditiously. We are hopeful
they will exercise their fiduciary responsibility and respond
positively to our very attractive offer.''
   Also Sunday, Georgia-Pacific extended the Nov. 29 expiration
deadline for its offer to midnight Dec. 4.
   Hahn said in his letter that Great Northern's contention that
the takeover would subject the company to excessive debt was
groundless. He said the $3.8 billion in incremental debt required
to finance the offer could be handled by the combined company
without a restructuring or loss of jobs.
   ``In fact, the combined company will be stronger and better able
to meet the challenges of our industry, provide jobs and compete in
the global marketplace than our two companies continuing on a
stand-alone basis,'' he wrote.
   The move Sunday came after Great Northern, in an effort to
derail the takeover, asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
to force Georgia-Pacific to obtain FERC approval before it could
acquire any of Great Northern's hydroelectric project licenses in
Maine.
   Great Northern also asked FERC to intervene in Georgia-Pacific's
pending hydroelectric license proceeding for its mill in Gilman,
Vt., because the merger could affect the supply of power in the
northeast.
   Great Northern officials said they made the request so the
commission would recognize ``anti-competitive effects'' of the
proposed merger.
   The merger, if successful, would be among the largest in the
62-year history of Georgia Pacific.
   ``We intend to acquire Great Northern and to make the
combination work,'' Hahn wrote in his letter.
   Georgia-Pacific, which employs 44,000 people, had revenue of
$9.5 billion last year from sales of paper, other forest products
and building materials. Great Northern, with 20,000 workers and
1988 sales of $3.6 billion, makes paper, cardboard and envelopes.

   Turf battles over regulating new financial
products are hurting U.S. chances to compete in the global market,
says Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C.
Breeden, and if they don't stop, ``we had all better start learning
to speak Japanese.''
   While U.S. regulators squabble over hybrid financial instruments
that have elements of both securities and futures contracts,
foreign markets are copying them and trading them, Breeden told a
group of securities lawyers.
   The protracted turf battles may be good for lawyers, ``it may
not be quite so good for the United States in facing international
competition,'' Breeden said in a speech Friday night to the
American Bar Association's Committee on Federal Regulation of
Securities.
   Americans may find themselves ``competing against those who have
an established market share in a product we invented by the time we
get out of the courthouse,'' Breeden cautioned.
   The United States must ``develop the regulatory system that can
accommodate innovation efficiently,'' he said.
   ``And ladies and gentlemen, if we don't, then we all had better
start learning to speak Japanese,'' Breeden told the gathering.
   He called for a system of ``anything goes'' when a product has
elements of both securities and futures.
   ``If we license it on a securities exchange, so be it. We'll
regulate it. If the same product is licensed on a futures exchange,
so be it. Let it be traded there and regulated there and let's get
out of the courthouse and back into the business of competing,''
said Breeden.
   On another topic, Breeden said deregulation of the securities
industry should be a two-way street for banks and securities firms.
   He said if people want Congress to modify the 1933
Glass-Steagall Act, which bars banks from the securities business,
they also should expect Congress to modify the 1956 Bank Holding
Company Act, which keeps securities and insurance firms out of
banking.
   ``If we're going to be in the business of demolishing
barriers,'' said Breeden, who has said he favors eliminating those
barriers, ``we're going to need to demolish them in both directions
simultaneously and make sure we try and create equal competitive
opportunities _ both theoretically and practically _ for everybody
in the marketplace.''
   Breeden also repeated his call for more funding for the SEC and
higher pay for its staff.
   He said some of the money the SEC raises for the government
should be used to fund the SEC, where a starting lawyer makes only
$27,500 a year _ well below the private sector and even lower than
most other federal financial agencies.
   ``They charge fees and they use the fee income to support their
operations. We charge fees and our fees support dairy prices and
Medicaid programs,'' he joked, adding, ``Somewhere there is a
squadron of F-15s which have been purchased with the surplus fees
generated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.''
   It was one of his first public addresses since taking over the
SEC chairmanship last month.
   Breeden said an appeals court decision in Chicago this summer,
in which the SEC was on the losing side of a jurisdictional battle,
had ``most ominous implications.''
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the SEC
overstepped itself in authorizing three securities exchanges, in
New York, Philadelphia and Chicago, to trade in a hybrid instrument
known as a stock basket.
   Technically called an ``index participation,'' the product
resembles a basket of stocks because it allowed investors to buy or
sell something with a value tied to broad stock market indexes,
such as the Standard &amp; Poors 500.
   But the appeals court held that the new financial instruments
contained enough elements of a futures contract that they should be
regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   ``We're never going to get rid of jurisdictional overlap,'' said
Breeden. ``We're never going to get rid of all the litigation, but
do we want to be a nation of financial markets or do we want to be
a nation of financial lawyers in courthouses?''

<HEAD>Consumer Group Says Many Children's Toys Are Dangerous</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Shoppers in search of holiday gifts for little
ones should be on guard because potentially dangerous toys and
children's items are more readily available than ever, a consumer
group said today.
   There are so many hazardous products on the market for children
that ``toy safety has become a contradiction in terms,'' according
to the 18th annual toy quality and safety report of the Consumer
Affairs Committee of Americans for Democratic Action.
   The committee said it was ``inundated by potentially dangerous
toys'' and blamed ``the pitiful ineptitude of the Consumer Product
Safety Commission'' for the availability of dangerous toys.
   ``In past years the commission only played dead. This year it
was officially dead,'' said the report, citing the panel's lack of
a quorum since January which makes it unable to take official
actions.
   Additionally, ``bottom-line considerations have outdistanced
safety considerations'' by toy makers, said Ann Brown, committee
chairwoman.
   Dan Rumelt of the CPSC said agency officials were unable to
comment on the criticisms because they had not seen the report.
   The report, which previously focused on toys, this year includes
infant and children's products because ``they are inextricably
linked and it just became too dangerous to ignore,'' said Brown.
   The group recommends from among this year's heavily advertised
toys 10 products for the ``toy box'' and an equal number for the
``trash box.'' The committee also cites 13 toys, a baker's ``dirty
dozen,'' of the most potentially dangerous toys from the 51
surveyed.
   Bob Jacobs, president of Aqua Sling, whose water balloon
slingshot is among the group's ``dirty dozen,'' said most of the
problems associated with the product were related to user
responsibility.
   ``We haven't had anybody hurt by the product. Everybody that's
had any problems with it has been with misuse of the product,''
said the California businessman. The report said hundreds of people
had been injured after being struck by water balloons fired by the
slingshots.
   An executive at Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc., said the company was
unaware of any safety concerns with its Bouncin' Babies Cuddly Baby
doll that also was listed among 1989's worst toys. The ADA report
said the toy has a pacifier with a stick that could poke a child's
eye.
   ``It's a design that works and kids seem to enjoy it and it
meets all safety regulations,'' said Stan Clutton, vice president
for marketing at Lewis Galoob.
   The committee said categories of potentially dangerous toys
include:
   _Exploding items designed to make loud noises which can be
damaging to ears or cause hearing loss.
   _Projectiles, including a water balloon sling shot, that use
guns or rubber devices to throw items a distance with force.
   _Toys that invite eating because that's what young children will
do ``whether edible or not.''
   _Inexpensive toys with small parts hazardous to young children
that are offered near the checkout counter to encourage impulse
buying.
   _Novelty items such as spray-can party string sold in toy stores
``where unsuspecting kids and parents can buy them.'' Emergency
rooms have reported skin irritation from party string.
   _Toys with inadequate or misleading age labels. In some cases
manufacturers label toys ``not for children under 3'' when they are
intended to appeal to exactly that age group.
   _Flammable items, including a stuffed doll, cuddling cushion and
baby linen set that burns.
   _Poorly made licensed items with familiar childhood and cartoon
characters.
   The report cites CPSC statistics that estimated there were
142,000 toy-related injuries in 1988, an increase of 11,000
incidents over 1987. Nursery product-related injuries to children
under 5 totaled 72,000 in 1988, according to commission figures
quoted in the report.
   The ADA gives parents and child caregivers these safety tips for
buying toys:
   _Don't trust age recommendations on labeling and packaging.
   _Safe and non-toxic are advertising terms that may be
meaningless on toy packages.
   _Never leave a child alone near water.
   _Throw away infant pacifiers when the child outgrows them.
   _Avoid excessively noisy toys.
   _All toys with wheels require adult supervision.

   In granting themselves a $31,000-plus pay
raise, House members are agreeing to stop taking $2,000 a pop for
speeches before interest groups and pocketing their campaign
treasuries when they retire.
   But with the other perquisites around Capitol Hill, taxpayers
can be assured their representatives would not have suffered even
if they had given up the speeches and political money pots without
an offsetting raise.
   The current salary of $89,500 goes pretty far when your
haircuts, gymnasium, parking, travel, meals, mail, insurance,
retirement and telephone bills are subsidized by the Treasury.
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader _ who believes members of Congress
should be paid about the same as their constituents, instead of
being in the top 1 percent income bracket _ once portrayed the
system as ``imperial legislators with their self-contained court of
favors.''
   With the pay raise, the House members beginning in 1991 will
have to give up the most profitable of those favors, the speech
honoraria. Many senior lawmakers for years have been padding their
incomes by up to 30 percent that way.
   The Senate voted to give itself only a 10 percent pay raise, and
to keep taking the speech money for now. The result is that the
House and Senate incomes will remain roughly comparable, at more
than $120,000 by 1991.
   Like executives in the private sector, salary is just part of
the remuneration package.
   The National Taxpayers Union says the new pay package means that
more than half of the House will be ``pension millionaires.'' That
is, once the pay hikes take effect, they can be expected to collect
more than $1 million in benefits during their lives.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley could expect to receive a pension
of $99,199 a year.
   That's on top of whatever he may have put into the House 401K
plan, a tax-deferred retirement system that many companies make
available to employees in the private sector.
   Congress lets its members put away up to 10 percent of their
incomes, and taxpayers match the first 5 percent.
   Members get health insurance like other federal employees, plus
more personal and immediate attention if they so desire.
   The Attending Physician's office provides doctors, nurses and
technicians who can take x-rays, dispense drugs, give allergy and
immunization shots and perform other services.
   Staying in shape is convenient at the Senate Health Club and the
House gymnasium. The Senate has an indoor tennis court; the House
has a swimming pool, handball, volleyball and basketball court and
a steam room.
   Members pay half the cost of their $78,000 life insurance
policies.
   Lawmakers don't get Christmas bonuses, but they often take
government or privately financed ``fact-finding'' trips during the
holidays.
   Those inclined toward helping the disadvantaged have visited
desolate areas of Africa, sometimes with tragic results such as the
death earlier this year of Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, on an
airplane flight to a refugee camp.
   Others have been less inclined to rough it. The Paris Air Show
is one of the annual pilgrimages for many members of Congress.
   Everything around the Capitol is geared toward making lawmakers
feel like they own the place.
   The subsidized barber shops and beauty salons cater to their
needs at discount prices. There's a private movie theater, and gun
enthusiasts have access to the Capitol Police firing range.
   Works from the National Gallery of Art decorate their offices,
and the Library of Congress is at their beck and call.
   Separate elevators are reserved for members only, and although
most are automatic, they carry operators so members don't have to
push their own buttons.
   The restaurants have private dining rooms open to only members
and their guests. If they get tired of the food, which is rather
bland, they are allowed to take as many meals as they want from
lobbyists.
   There's talk that many senior House members will retire rather
than run again in 1992, because after that they will no longer be
allowed to keep for personal use the money in their campaign
chests. In some cases that's more than $1 million.
   But for the most part, members of Congress run for re-election
again and again, and would have kept doing so even if their
salaries didn't reach six figures any time soon.

<HEAD>Nation's Only Diamond Park to be Opened to Commercial Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HEBER SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's only public diamond mine
_ which yields about 1,400 gems a year to tourists _ will be opened
to test drilling by four private mining companies in a plan
criticized by environmentalists.
   The exploratory drilling at Crater of Diamonds State Park could
lead to commercial mining at the park, which presently allows
anyone with the $3-a-day price of admission to seek his fortune in
the soft blue-gray soil.
   The state Parks, Recreation and Travel Commission voted 12-0 in
favor of the plan Thursday. If commercially viable deposits are
found, the state could award mining rights to one of the four
companies cooperating in the test drilling.
   The Sierra Club and the Friends of the Crater of Diamonds oppose
the plan, and have threatened legal action to block the exploratory
work. They say businesses don't belong in state parks, and warn the
drilling could open the way to logging or gravel mining in the area.
   The decision to allow exploratory drilling came more than 2{
years after Gov. Bill Clinton's appointed a Diamond Mining Advisory
Task Force to study the prospect of commercial mining at the park
   An advisory team will meet by mid-January, said John Morgan, a
consulting engineer who advised the state. Drilling could begin as
early as April.
   The state got control of the 888-acre park in southwestern
Arkansas in 1972, after a private mining company went bankrupt.
Visitors are allowed to prospect in a 35-acre plowed field, and
it's said people have taken away diamonds as large as 40 carats.
   About 78,000 people try their luck at Crater of Diamonds each
year.
   An independent contractor selected under state bidding
procedures will conduct the tests, working for the state and the
four mining companies.
   The four companies are Kennecott Inc. of Salt Lake City;
Capricorn Diamonds of West Perth, Australia; Continental Diamonds,
which is controlled by a Canadian gold company called Galactic
Resources Ltd., and Arkansas Diamond Development Co., owned by
Texas and Arkansas business people.

<HEAD>U.S.-Japan Wood Trade Talks `Constructive,' But No Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan and the United States ended three days of
talks Monday on wood products trade without an agreement on
increasing U.S. lumber exports to Japan, officials said.
   Negotiators on both sides agreed the talks were ``constructive''
and said they had deepened their understanding of each other's
position, an official at Japan's Foreign Ministry and a U.S.
Embassy official said.
   However, no agreement was reached on U.S. claims that Japan is
keeping American U.S. wood products out of its markets, and
negotiators agreed to continue talks in December or early next
year, officials said.
   The United States claims Japan excludes U.S. wood products with
high duties, inscrutable product standards and an agricultural
grading system that requires testing to be carried out domestically
_ even after the products have undergone testing abroad.
   During the talks, U.S. negotiators asked Japan to reclassify
certain products to enable them to qualify for lower tariff ratings
and to simplify construction and product standardization
procedures, the U.S. embassy official said.
   No agreement was reached on tariff classifications. Japanese
officials argued that the standardization procedures were devised
to fit special Japanese conditions, a Foreign Ministry official
said.
   Japanese negotiators said Japan's densely crowded housing and
frequent earthquakes required special product and construction
standards, the official said.
   But he said, ``Given these conditions, the Japanese government
would like to make its product standardization procedures more
rational.'' He conceded that existing standards were ``quite
difficult to understand.''
   U.S. lumber exports have been increasing. Total exports from the
Pacific Northwest, for instance, rose 20 percent last year from
1987. But more than 70 percent of U.S. wood exports to Japan are in
the form of raw lumber.
   United States wants to increase its exports of higher
value-added products, but U.S. officials say Japan's intricate
tariff and non-tariff barriers are designed to encourage raw lumber
imports and to exclude finished products from the Japanese market.
   Both countries are trying to protect their struggling sawmill
industries, officials say privately.
   Trade in forest products is one of three priority issues singled
out by the U.S. ``Super 301'' clause of the U.S. Omnibus Trade Act,
which requires the U.S. government to retaliate against countries
which do not open their markets.
   Japan has until now refused to negotiate on any of the three
issues _ supercomputers, satellites and forest products _ while
under the threat of sanctions.

<HEAD>Central Bank Quietly Tightens Rules on Foreign Exchange</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's central bank has quietly tightened
regulations on foreign exchange, limiting purchases of foreign
currency and restricting its sale to those with airline tickets out
of the country.
   The new regulations, which come several months after the
government's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in the
nation's capital, stem the outflow of foreign capital. They suggest
the government could be considering a devaluation of the Chinese
currency, but economists in Beijing said they doubt that would
happen in the near future.
   Under the new restrictions, which apply to foreign visitors as
well as Chinese, holders of foreign currency certificates can only
repurchase 50 percent of the amount of foreign currency they
originally sold, a Bank of China official said.
   Anyone who has converted $1,000 to foreign exchange
certificates, or FECs, can only exchange half that amount back into
dollars, said the official of the bank's Bank Deposit Department,
who would not give his name.
   Customers must also present an airplane ticket proving that they
need the money because they are going overseas, the official said.
They may make deposits to Bank of China FEC accounts that already
exist.
   Customers may also withdraw from their FEC accounts in the form
of checks, which can be cashed into foreign currencies overseas,
the official said.
   The new regulations were not announced publicly but were put
into effect about a month ago, the official said.
   China has a dual currency system, with the yuan divided into
renminbi, for domestic use, and FECs for foreigners and Chinese who
change foreign currency into yuan.
   The Bank of China official would not say why the restrictions
were imposed but called them ``a reasonable measure.''
   ``If you change dollars into foreign exchange certificates, it's
natural that you should spend the money in China,'' he said. There
are no plans to abolish FECs, he said.
   ``It's a very serious thing,'' said an official of the Beijing
office of a European-based credit bank.
   ``It's a move to tighten the economy and more closely monitor
foreign exchange,'' said the banker, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``They've done this because many Chinese have FECs in their
hands which they change to U.S. dollars on the black market,'' he
said. ``It is primarily to restrict the cash going out. There are
less U.S. dollars in cash available and people have less to play
around with in the open market.''
   The double-currency system has spawned a lively black market in
FECs and convertible foreign currencies, primarily U.S. dollars.
Chinese generally need FECs to purchase imported items, and must
prove they have dollars or other foreign currencies in order to
travel or study abroad.
   One reason for the Bank of China's move could be to discourage
illegal foreign currency transactions.
   ``But the black market has fallen,'' the banker said. ``You get
less for dollars, and the black market centers have been clamped
down upon.''
   The black market price for the U.S. dollar has dropped from
about eight yuan a year ago to five or six yuan today, the banker
said. The official exchange rate for the yuan is 3.7 to the dollar.

   The Berlin Wall is tumbling down, and some of the
pieces are apparently landing overseas in the United States.
   More than 11 tons of debris reputed to be chunks from the wall
arrived Sunday at O'Hare International Airport aboard an American
Airlines flight from Hamburg, West Germany.
   Airline spokesman Tom Stack said the cargo, labeled ``Pieces of
the Berlin Wall,'' was destined for Concord Express, an Elk Grove
Village shipping firm, but he did not know the buyer.
   ``We guess it'll be sold as souvenirs,'' said airline supervisor
Konstantin Prause. ``Maybe as paperweights or key tags.''
   Calls to Concord Express went unanswered early Monday.
   Customs officials said the cargo was being kept at a customs
facility.
   Others already have taken advantage of the clamor over the wall.
   A firm called B&amp;P Imports in Munster, Ind., is using a toll-free
telephone number to take orders for wall chunks, even though it
already has sold all 100 pounds of debris it had.
   Paul Wells, a partner in the venture, said the company is taking
orders for golf-ball size chunks for $10, plus $2.50 to cover
shipping and handling.
   B&amp;P also sends along a copy of the customs certificate showing
the country of origin as West Germany.
   ``That's about all you can do to prove'' the debris is really
from the wall, Wells said.
   ``It's been pretty overwhelming,'' he said of the response. ``It
started with just an ad in the local newspapers here.''
   The idea grew when a friend in West Germany sent a chunk of the
wall to partner William Bell.
   ``We figured everybody in the country was having the same idea
as us, but we were just lucky enough to have a connection out
there,'' Wells said.
   Bell is in West Germany making arrangements to ship more of the
wall back to the United States, Wells said. Shipping costs are
about $4 per pound, he said.
   Wells predicted business would be brisk through Christmas.
   ``It should go pretty good ... a lot of people are buying it as
a stocking stuffer,'' he said.

   East Germany has told the European
Community it wants a broad trade and economic cooperation accord
with the EC and also hopes to start political consultations on
European security matters.
   But it made clear there can be no discussion of a German
reunification.
   In a letter, sent last Friday, to the 12 EC governments, East
German Prime Minister Hans Modrow, asked that ``negotiations for a
trade agreement, also taking into account the requirement for
economic cooperation, should start as soon as possible.''
   The letter, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated
Press, states East German wishes for a relationship going far
beyond that which the EC has forged with other emerging East
European democracies, notably Hungary and Poland.
   ``The German Democratic Republic would like to develop its
relations with the European Community speedily, cooperatively and
constructively,'' the letter states.
   Modrow said he wants cooperation in economic relations, trade,
science, technology, the environment, transport, fisheries, the
standardization of industrial norms, statistics ``as well as in the
humanitarian field, culture, education and information.''
   He also wrote:
   ``We are ready for a political dialogue about questions of
security and peace in Europe'' but made clear there can be no
discussion of changing the border between East and West Germany.
   EC officials had no immediate comment Monday on the letter.
   It was sent to the 12 EC capitals one day before the EC leaders
met in Paris on Saturday to assess the frantic changes now sweeping
Eastern Europe.
   At their summit, the leaders pledged to step up aid to Eastern
Europe if democracy firmly takes root there and agreed to study the
creation of a development bank for Eastern Europe.
   Polnd and Hungary _ two nations that are to benefit from $1.1
billion in long-term EC loans and $333 dollars in short-term aid _
already have signed trade and economic cooperation agreements with
the Community.
   Talks for a simple trade accord between the EC and East Germany
are in a preliminary stage. EC External Relations Commissioner
Frans Andriessen will go to East Berlin ``soon'' to speed up the
talks following the Nov. 9 opening of East German borders, an EC
official said Monday.

   Boeing machinists tonight will approve an
agreement to end a strike that has virtually shut down production
at the world's largest maker of commercial aircraft, a key union
leader predicted.
   A tentative contract, which affects more than 57,000 workers in
nine states and was expected to set a standard for other aircraft
manufacturers, was agreed upon early Sunday.
   The agreement culminated 14 hours of talks during which a
federal mediator took the unusual step of presenting his own
proposal. It was accepted by a 3-2 vote among negotiators for the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
   The 48-day strike _ longest against The Boeing Co. in 41 years _
has delayed deliveries of jets to airlines at a time of growing
passenger loads and rising concern over the nation's aging
commerical airline fleets.
   Tom Baker, president of Machinists District Lodge 751, praised
the three-year pact as a substantial improvement over two earlier
Boeing offers.
   ``I feel it will be ratified overwhelmingly,'' he said.
   But Justin Ostro, an international vice president who
coordinates aerospace industry negotiations for the Machinists, had
harsh words for the agreement and the way it was reached.
   ``There's a great deal of sacrifice on the part of these
members,'' Ostro said. ``They were entitled to a great deal more.''
   Union members meet at Seattle's Kingdome at 8 p.m. PST to vote
after hearing an explanation and arguments about the contract.
Meetings also are set for 5 p.m. CST in Wichita, Kan., and 8 p.m.
in Portland, Ore.
   Strikers picketing outside Boeing plants Sunday were happy to
hear about the agreement.
   Wichita striker Merle Barton said his co-workers would ratify
almost anything.
   ``I think people want to go back to work,'' Barton said. ``It's
a bad time for a working man to be out. Christmas is coming up.
Taxes are coming up.''
   ``I'm pretty sure everybody will go for it. We're tired of
standing around in the rain,'' said Elaine Campbell, who was doing
just that outside a Boeing jet plant in suburban Renton.
   Boeing chief negotiator Larry McKean said if the pact is
approved, strikers could return to work Wednesday. ``At this point
we're looking forward to a favorable vote on this contract and a
return to normal operations,'' he said.
   Analysts have said a settlement with the Boeing Machinists
traditionally sets the pattern for other aerospace companies,
especially Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas, as well as for other
unions at Boeing.
   Baker, whose lodge represents 43,300 of the 57,800 Boeing
workers covered by the pact, said the new offer provided
improvements in pay, medical coverage, overtime and the promotion
system. He gave few details.
   ``This proposal is very close to what people indicated (in union
membership polls) they would accept,'' he said.
   Ostro, however, said the settlement included about the same
annual wage gains _ 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent _ that
Boeing offered before the strike. Baker refused to reveal the new
figures.
   The company proposed productivity bonuses of 10 percent of gross
pay in the first year, 5 percent in the second and 4 percent in the
third, and a cost-of-living escalator would cover almost all
inflation, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported today.
   Before the strike, Boeing machinists earned $8.88 to $18.42 an
hour, without counting lump sum bonuses.
   Union and management negotiators had kind words for mediator
Doug Hammond's proposal. Hammond said it was only the second time
he had submitted his own proposed settlement in 15 years as a
mediator.
   ``We were kind of at loggerheads,'' McKean said. ``It was good
and professional for him to step in.''
   ``It was difficult for him to do,'' Baker said. ``Had both
parties not accepted, he would have been out as a mediator.''
   Besides the Seattle-area workers, the contract covers 12,000 in
Wichita, 1,700 in Portland, and a few hundred others in California,
Hawaii, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota and other states.
   During the strike, Boeing used supervisory and non-striking
workers to deliver 22 planes. But all were virtually complete
before the walkout.
   Boeing has continued to accumulate record orders, including a
deal last week with Delta Airlines for up to 100 jets potentially
worth $4 billion.
   That boosted Boeing's backlog of orders to 1,718 planes worth
$85 billion, both aerospace industry records.
   The last Boeing strike, in 1977, ended after 45 days. Its
longest walkout lasted 140 days in 1948.

   The latest hotel opening at Walt

   Together with Sheraton Corp.'s 1,509-room Dolphin, scheduled to

   The huge ``fantasy resort'' is being built on 150 acres in a
tropical setting that includes a 50-acre man-made lake and 200,000
square feet of meeting and banquet space. Covered walkways connect
the two hotels over a waterway which leads to Disney's theme parks.
   Sheraton and Westin have eased their competitive fervor enough
to get together to operate the properties as a joint enterprise
under the wing of the Walt Disney Co.
   ``We cooperate in some things and compete in others,'' said
Dolphin spokesman Bob Mervine. The companies will join forces when
seeking the business of groups large enough to use both hotels, and
will cooperate in some operational areas, he said.
   ``We aggressively compete for the leisure market, the family
vacationer, the travel trade and smaller meetings that can be held
in either hotel,'' Mervine added.
   The hotels are built and owned as a joint venture by Tishman
Realty &amp; Construction Co. Inc., Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and
Aoki Corp. of Japan.
   Finishing touches give the project an unmistakable Disney
imprint: Two 45-foot-tall swan statues outside one building and two
six-story dolphins outside the other.
   Disney also is in control of entertainment, coordinating events
such as appearances by Mickey and the gang and running the Main
Street Electrical Parade through the cavernous ballroom of the
convention pavilion.
   That's fitting since the complex is in the heart of an area
bordered by Epcot center and the new Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park.
   Sheraton Corp. bills the convention resort complex (a
combination of rooms and meeting space) as the third largest in the
country. The biggest is the Hilton in Las Vegas, followed by
Opryland in Nashville, Tenn., Sheraton says.
   The complex will bring the number of hotel rooms in the Orlando
area to 68,300. By comparison, the Los Angeles-Long Beach area,
which according to the Laventhol &amp; Horwath accounting firm leads
the nation in the number of hotel rooms, has 68,000.
   In addition to the Swan and Dolphin, four hotels are under
construction at Disney World. When all are finished, the area alone
will have 18 hotels with 15,297 rooms.

<HEAD>Rig Count Posts Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working U.S. oil and gas rigs
declined by five this week to total 1,040, after posting increases
10 times in the past 12 weeks.
   The total, however, showed 117 more working rigs than for the
same week a year ago, Baker Hughes Inc. reported Monday. Last week,
the count increased by three to total 1,045.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively
producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Oklahoma posted the largest
gain with five, followed by Louisiana and New Mexico, two each, and
Ohio, one.
   Those showing a decline in the number of operating rigs were
Wyoming, five; Kansas, four; California, Colorado, and
Pennsylvania, three each; Michigan, two; and North Dakota and
Texas, one each.

   Saudi Arabia, the world's
largest oil exporter, will not surrender its majority share of OPEC
production when ministers meet later this week, a report predicted
Monday.
   The respected Middle East Economic Survey reported that the
Saudis will insist its share of OPEC's output remain at the current
24.46 percent even if non-proportionate quota increases are granted
to other members of the cartel.
   Ian Seymour, editor of the Cyprus-based oil industry newsletter,
wrote after discussions with senior Saudi officials that ``there is
no way in which Saudi Arabia would be prepared to surrender even a
token part of its output share in order to facilitate agreement on
a new quota system'' in Vienna.
   Members of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, have been squabbling over quota allocations and several
nations have consistently produced beyond their established limits
in open defiance of the OPEC ceilings.
   OPEC is scheduled to meet Saturday in Vienna, Austria, to seek a
formula to satisfy demands by various members for higher production
limits while at the same time trying to avoid a major hike in the
overall quota that could hurt prices.
   World oil prices have remained relatively stable in recent
months, thanks to strong demand from developing nations.
   Oil ministers from Persian Gulf nations, including Saudi Arabia,
held a strategy session here Monday in preparation for the OPEC
meeting.
   An official, speaking on condition of anoynmity, said ministers
from the Gulf Cooperation Council ``discussed developments in the
world oil market and reviewed future oil strategy for the GCC
member states'' during a 90-minute session.
   The six GCC ministers met after a session of the 11-member
Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   In addition to Saudi Arabia, the GCC includes Qatar, Bahrain and
Oman as well as Kuwait and the U.A.E. OAPEC includes Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Qatar, Iraq, Algeria, Libya, the U.A.E., Egypt, Bahrain,
Syria and Tunisia.
   Algerian Oil Minister Sadiq Busina, after the OAPEC session,
called for a ``flexibile approach'' on the quota distribution. He
said that ``such an agreement must be reached fast.''
   Algeria, an OPEC hardliner who favors low output to bolster
prices, has been critical of OPEC's decision in September to raise
the overall quota by 1 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter
to 20.5 million barrels daily.
   Seymour also wrote: ``There is considerable scepticism in Saudi
oil circles as to whether the quota redistribution proposed in
Geneva would be either achievable or workable.''
   At the September meeting in Geneva Iran introduced a new plan
for sharing production, which got only preliminary consideration
because it was presented late in the session.
   The proposal, expected to be re-heard at Saturday's meeting,
called for raising the overall output cap to 21.5 million barrels a
day to meet the demands primarily of Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates. Gabon and Ecuador also would get higher ceilings, while
other member quotas would remain the same or be reduced.

<HEAD>Northeast Utilities Chosen to Take Over Public Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOINA CHIACU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After almost two years of wrangling and
uncertainty, New Hampshire's largest electric utility appears ready
to emerge from bankruptcy under new ownership that seems to have
state and industry support.
   Northeast Utilities of Hartford, Conn., came out of last-minute
negotiations between shareholders and creditors Saturday as the
winning bidder to take over Public Service Co. of New Hampshire and
its 36 percent share of the Seabrook nuclear plant that forced it
into bankruptcy.
   The tentative agreement on Northeast's $2.3 billion takeover
proposal was to be presented today to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James
Yacos. It calls for annual rate increases of 5.5 percent for seven
years.
   Shareholders and creditors of Public Service still must take a
formal vote on the Northeast plan and any others still on the
table. Then Yacos will hold confirmation hearings to make sure the
chosen plan will do what it says it will do.
   Public Service's investors stand to lose about $1.6 billion in
the utility's reorganization, with shareholders absorbing the brunt
of the loss, an attorney said.
   ``It's a pretty significant loss ... that is primarily being
suffered by shareholders,'' said Howard Berman, an attorney for the
shareholders.
   New Hampshire Gov. Judd Gregg, who announced the tentative
agreement, withheld official endorsement of the Northeast plan
until state negotiators can go over it once more.
   ``There still are many uncertainties to be resolved before this
case is concluded,'' Public Service spokesman Nicholas Ashooh said.
   Other New England utilities have raised the possibility of
antitrust action.
   Northeast is New England's largest electric utility, and Public
Service has almost 400,000 customers in New Hampshire.
   State legislators still must meet in a special session, expected
to be scheduled today, before Jan. 1 to vote on whether to modify a
state law that bans advance charges for Seabrook before it begins
commercial operation. Every takeover proposal relied on an
electricity rate plan that called for rate increases beginning Jan.
1, and those rates would include Seabrook costs.
   Several attempts in the past to repeal the law have failed.
   Senate Majority Leader Edward Dupont and House Speaker Douglas
Scamman said they thought chances are good that the law will be
modified.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean prices closed lower Monday on
the Chicago Board of Trade as selling to take profits weighed on
soybean futures.
   Soybean futures were on the defensive throughout the day because
of commercial fund selling, analyst Joel Karlin of Research
Department Inc. said.
   Karlin said the selling was technical in nature on the
perception that soybean futures were overbought. Futures also were
pressured by a lack of export business.
   Corn prices were lower due to a spillover effect from the
selloff in the soybean pits, although corn futures received support
from reports of Far East buying and news that Mexico may enter the
market this week.
   Wheat prices received a boost from concerns about dry weather
conditions in the winter wheat crop region, Karlin said. The latest
six- to 10-day forecast by the National Weather Service is calling
for continued dry conditions in the Central Plains.
   At the close, wheat was a { cent to 2\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.10{ a bushel; corn was a \

<HEAD>Five Denver Post Unions Approve Contracts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five unions representing Denver Post employees
have ratified contracts with the newspaper, including one local
that organized a 14-month circulation boycott campaign after taking
steep pay cuts.
   Unions representing mailers, typographical workers, paper
handlers, stereotypers and pressmen ratified contracts with the
newspaper Sunday.
   The Post had been locked in a dispute with Denver Mailers Union
Local 8, whose members load delivery trucks and operate machines
that insert supplements, since the paper cut mailroom employees'
wages by 42 percent to 52 percent in August 1988.
   ``We are gratified that The Denver Post and its employees have
entered into a renewed partnership for the future,'' Post Chairman
W. Dean Singleton said. ``With this cooperation between labor and
management, The Post is poised for excellent growth in the years
ahead.''
   The mailers' agreement establishes a three-year timetable for 55
journeymen mailers to draw within 11 percent of the wages they
received before the cuts were made in 1988.
   Another 22 less-experienced mailers will get smaller wage
increases than the journeymen. The mailers union also represents
about 100 part-time employees.
   ``We were not overwhelmingly pleased, but we were forced to
accept reality,'' mailers local president Ray Benoit said.
   During the boycott campaign, the union urged Post subscribers in
radio advertisements to cancel their subscriptions. Despite the
effort, the newspaper recently released circulation figures showing
an increase in subscribers.
   The agreements between the company and the other four unions
call for 160 union members to receive $500 bonuses in each of the
next two years and a 4 percent wage increase in the final, third
year of the contract.
   The paper handlers accepted a company offer to extend the
contract to five years. They are to receive a 4 percent wage
increase in the fourth year and a 5 percent increase in the fifth
year.
   Machinists and engravers unions considered but did not vote on
the company proposal and said they would seek to reopen talks.

   A commercial television station owned by
five newspaper publishers went on the air Monday, ending a state
monopoly and promising objectivity in news and variety in
entertainment programs.
   At least two more private channels are preparing to go on the
air soon, following a law passed in October allowing independent
television broadcasts.
   Nikos Skoulas, managing director of the new ``Mega Channel,''
said at the start of the first transmission that the independent
station was dedicated to improving the quality of television.
   The channel will present Greek, European and American movies,
television serials, sports and variety and game shows. It will
operate for 10 hours on weekdays and 11 hours on weekends.
   Employees of the state-run Hellenic Radio Television Corporation
(ERT) staged several work-stoppages in September protesting the
government proposal to allow independent television stations.
   Until Monday, ERT controlled the nation's only two television
stations.
   The state monopoly on radio and television broadcasts began to
crumble in 1987 when the Athens municipality set up a radio
station, prompting the socialist government at the time to legalize
independent radio stations.
   There are 42 municipal and commercial radio stations in the
greater Athens area, in addition to scores of others around the
country.

<BYLINE>Potentially Explosive Economic Problems Await Brazil's Next President
^By STAN LEHMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nation on the brink of
hyperinflation, burdened with huge foreign and internal debts, is
the potentially explosive economic scenario awaiting Brazil's next
president.
   But only painful recessionary economic policies can deactivate
the hyperinflation time bomb and the next chief-of-state may not
have the time or the support to implement such policies, say
economists and businessmen.
   ``If the next president does not act quickly to undertake real
economic adjustments then his political authority and credibility
will be greatly weakened,'' says U.S. economist Jeffrey Sachs.
   ``The real essence of Brazil's economic future will probably be
decided in the first few weeks of the new government,'' he said.
   The challenge will fall to either conservative Fernando Collor
de Mello or Marxist Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, who compete Dec. 17
in a presidential runoff election.
   Collor de Mello, of the center-right National Reconstruction
Party, led a field of 21 candidates in the Nov. 15 election,
Brazil's first free balloting for president in 29 years. The former
state governor had 28.4 percent of the votes, with 99.3 percent of
the ballots counted Monday.
   Da Silva, a former trade union president of the radical left
Workers Party, was second with 16.1 percent.
   Both candidates say restarting economic growth is the top
priority.
   The new president who takes office next Mar. 15 will confront an
annual inflation rate of more than 1,300 percent; a foreign debt of
about $110 billion, the largest in the Third World; an internal
government debt of $120 billion; and a public deficit equal to 6
percent of the country's $350 billion gross national product.
   ``The cure for high inflation is the sharp contraction of the
budget deficit which can be achieved by cutting public spending,
reducing subsidies and increasing taxes and public utility rates,''
Sachs said at a recent seminar in Sao Paulo.
   Government intervention in the economy was common under the
military regime that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. That policy
continued under President Jose Sarney, who took power in a 1985
election controlled by the outgoing generals.
   Sachs said his proposed economic stabilization measures would
provoke a recession that would last about one yer, after which he
predicted Brazil's economy would start recovering.
   Economist Joaquim Eloi Cirne de Toledo, of the University of Sao
Paulo, warned that the next president might not have the popular
and political support needed to adopt economic austerity measures.
   ``When the next president takes office, the monthly inflation
rate probably will be about 65 percent, which is not enough to
destabilize the economy,'' Toledo said.
   ``If the economy is not about to collapse, it will be difficult
to convince congress and the public of the urgent need for
austerity measures...'' Toledo said.
   By April, 1990, inflation will be about 70 percent a month,
Toledo said. He predicted the new government then would impose
price and wage controls that would bring inflation down to 6 or 7
percent.
   ``But inflation would soon start accelerating again and by the
end of the year it will be 80 percent a month,'' he said.
   ``At this stage hyperinflation will probably explode and only
then will the new president have the public support to restructure
the economy.''
   Toledo said the restructuring would a require a reduction of the
public deficit by renegotiating longer repayment periods and lower
interest rates on Brazil's internal debt.
   The internal debt is financed by government securities that pay
more than 1 percent daily interest rates.
   Brazil also must negotiate longer repayment terms and lower
interest rates on its foreign debt, on which it currently pays
$14.5 billion annually, said Toledo.
   John Mein, executive vice-president of the American Chamber of
Commerce, said in an interview that Brazil's next president may not
have enough time to adopt the measures needed to eliminate the
threat of hyperinflation.
   ``The presidential honeymoon with the people and Congress could
last between 45 days and six months; hardly enough time to set in
motion the structural changes in the economy needed to bring
inflation under control,'' Mein said.
   Mein said the new government must open up the economy to more
foreign investment, diminish its interference in the economy,
privatize badly managed and unprofitable state enterprises and
institute tax reforms to close loopholes that encourage widespread
tax evasion.
   The government also will have to devalue the new cruzado,
Brazil's currency, by at least 30 percent to make local goods more
competitive on the international market, Mein said.

<TEXT>
   The makers of Reynolds Wrap alumnimum foil
on Monday announced a joint venture to build a $200 million
aluminum foil production plant in the Soviet Union.
   The plant in the south-central Siberian town of Sayanogorsk is
slated to produce 47,000 tons of foil and converted products each
year and employ 650 people. Production is expected to begin in 1992.
   ``Reynolds Wrap is used around the world,'' said Robert L.
Shaffer, a spokesman for Richmond-based Reynolds Metals Co.
``Whether it will be seen in Russian stores remains to be seen.''
   Under the deal, a subsidiary of Reynolds Metals, six Soviet
organizations and two Italian companies will jointly own the
aluminum plant. A signing ceremony was held in Rome on Monday.
   The partners in the venture are Reynolds International Inc., the
Fata European Group of Turin, the San Paolo Bank of Italy and the
Soviet groups, which include producers of aluminum and research and
development organizations that report to the Ministry of Iron
Metallurgy.
   The Soviet organizations will own 70 percent of the facility.
Reynolds and Fata each will own 13{ percent and San Paolo will own
the remaining 3 percent.
   Reynolds said it would provide technology and technical
assistance for the plant's design, construction and operation.
   Reynolds has $6 billion in annual sales as a producer of
aluminum, packaging, consumer products and gold.
   The company has facilities in 18 countries including ones in
Europe, South America and Australia. The Siberian plant is
Reynolds' first venture in the Soviet Union, Shaffer said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, the Democratic
leader of the House, and Sen. John Heinz, a prominent Republican,
joined Monday in criticizing the Bush administration for cutting
back support for making the United States competitive in high
technology.
   Heinz, R-Pa., a member of the Senate Banking Committee,
emphasized concerns that cut across party lines.
   ``As a Republican, I feel very strongly that it would be a
mistake for my party and the Bush administration to discover that
our failure to comprehend reality had irreparably undermined ths
nation's national security and its ability to remain a world
leader,'' he told a news conference.
   Gephardt denounced what he called the ``high priests'' of free
trade and free markets.
   ``There are people who believe ... that other economies around
the world operate exactly like ours and that the free-market
ideology and the free-trade ideology reign in practice everywhere
in the world,'' he said.
   ``The problem with that belief is that, I think, it is out of
synchronization with reality,'' Gephardt said. ``So what America
has to do is to fashion a public-private cooperation so that we can
compete in the world as it is.''
   Both legislators noted a report issued Monday on U.S.
telecommunications policy by a private group, the Economic Policy
Institute. It predicted a loss of 2 million U.S. jobs by the year
2010 and an annual trade deficit $225 billion larger than it would
otherwise be unless the government helps U.S. industry compete
against Japan and Western Europe.
   The most critical areas, according to the report, are
television, computers, digital communications and semiconductors,
the electronic chips now at the heart of all telecommunications.
   The study concluded that, unlike its economic rivals, the United
States has failed to set up a system for staying competitive in
leading communications technologies.
   In a statement to the Senate on Sunday, Heinz cited another
report made public Monday, this one from the National Advisory
Committee on Semiconductors. That committee included government
officials as well as leaders in the industry.
   ``The U.S. merchant semiconductor industry has lost its dominant
world market share in the past 10 years,'' the panel's report said.
``Because technological leadership is cumulative, once
technological leadership is lost it is very difficult to regain.''

<HEAD>Thanksgiving Meal More Expensive This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The traditional Thanksgiving meal of
turkey, cranberries, stuffing and pie will cost more this year, a
Purdue University economist says.
   Food prices rose about 5 percent in 1989, compared with a 4
percent increase from 1987 to 1988, said agricultural economist
Joseph N. Uhl.
   ``And these price increases are likely to continue through 1989
and into 1990,'' Uhl said.
   The good news for Thanksgiving is that turkey prices are lower
this year because of increased supplies and more grocery specials.
Ham costs about the same as it did last year, Uhl said.
   Because of bad weather last winter and spring, the cranberry
crop is about 4 percent smaller than last year. Wheat prices also
are up, meaning breads and stuffing will be more expensive. The
size of the sweet potato crop has declined by 1 percent from 1988.
   Almonds, hazelnuts, pistachios and pecans will be in shorter
supply for holiday baking and snacking this year, although peanuts
and walnuts will be plentiful, the economist said.
   Vegetable prices, especially for potatoes, onions, tomatoes and
lettuce, will remain relatively high for the rest of the year, he
said.
   Prices for holiday baking supplies also are higher this year.
   ``The effects of the 1988 drought and this year's strong U.S.
and worldwide demand for food products has caused sugar, flour,
shortening, eggs and butter to rise,'' Uhl said.
   Even oatmeal cookies will be more expensive, due to the
increased demand for oats, and chocolate prices will be somewhat
higher as supplies decrease. However, pumpkins are plentiful for
holiday pies.
   Holiday beverages will cost more this year. Coffee prices are
down, but orange juice and soda are up. Milk and dairy prices are
substantially higher, and higher prices for eggs means more
expensive eggnog.
   Uhl blamed the drought, tighter food supplies and a strong
consumer demand for food for raising the price of eggs, milk, bread
and beef.
   ``Further price increases can be expected in coming months,'' he
said. ``Normally, for perishable products, it takes three months
for the full effects of a farm price increase to be reflected in
grocery store prices.''

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines is trying again to work out a deal
to sell its Latin American routes and other assets to rival
American Airlines, a spokesman said Monday.
   ``They approached us again. We've had some occasional
discussions concerning their Latin American network,'' said Jim
Brown, a spokesman for American at its headquarters in Dallas-Fort
Worth, Texas. ``We are receptive to assets purchases. No
announcement is imminent.''
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell declined comment on details of
the negotiations published by The Wall Street Journal.
   The Journal, quoting unidentified sources, said negotiations
began about 10 days ago and continued through this past weekend.
The sources said the talks included close telephone contact between
Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.,
and Chairman Robert Crandall of AMR Corp., parent of American.
   The Journal report said the Latin American routes, valued at
$365 million, are part of a $400 million to $500 million assets
package.
   Speculation that Eastern would renew efforts to sell the
lucrative routes was fueled earlier this month because some
creditors were concerned about cash shortfalls in Eastern's
rebuilding plan.
   Hit by a crippling strike March 4, Eastern filed five days later
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   Miami-based Eastern has been rebuilding as a smaller carrier
without the unions, after selling off a number of assets to pay its
debts.
   However, extended talks with American, keenly interested in the
Latin American routes as it builds up its Miami operations,
foundered about three months ago. At that time, Eastern said it
would keep the routes and planned to emerge from Chapter 11 early
next year at as much as 90 percent of its pre-strike size.
   But that meant Eastern had to overhaul its reorganization plan
for creditors. The carrier recently received a 60-day extension of
its filing deadline for the revised plan.
   The Journal said a major sticking point to be overcome in
negotiations was a lawsuit that Continental Airlines, Eastern's
sister carrier, has pending against American in a dispute over
computer reservations. Continental has been seeking as much as $1
billion in damages.
   That suit undercut the earlier talks between Eastern and
American, the nation's largest airline, according to the newspaper.
   A source said American wanted whatever amount it paid to settle
that suit to be included in the Latin American package in a way
that would show as little as possible. The package being negotiated
also includes some Continental routes and airport gates, the report
said.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in Monday's auction with rates on six-month bills
dropping to their lowest level since July.
   The Treasury Department sold $8.0 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.61 percent, down from 7.68 percent
last week. Another $8.0 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.40 percent, down from 7.51 percent last
week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.52
percent on Oct. 23 and six-month bills averaged 7.35 percent on
July 31.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.86 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,809.80 and 7.79 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,627.90.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the

for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 7.71
percent last week, down from 7.87 percent the previous week.

   A farm chemical trade association said Monday
that a total ban on the use of crop fungicides would boost consumer
food prices by 13 percent and reduce the supply of fruits,
vegetables and peanuts by 24 percent.
   Jay Vroom, president of the National Agricultural Chemicals
Association, said he wanted to call attention to the ``enormous
benefit and the very small risk'' that result from the use of
fungicides and other high-tech farming methods on food supplies.
   ``In my view, the debate regarding the safety of our food is
almost totally risk-dominated,'' Vroom said. ``There is precious
little mentioned about the benefit side of the equation.''
   An economic study showing the effects of a ban on fungicides _
chemicals applied to crops, particularly fruit and vegetable, to
prevent plant diseases _ was released by the association at a news
conference here.
   The study, paid for by the association, was done by GRC
Economics, a Washington, D.C., consulting subsidiary of Hill and
Knowlton Inc.
   The Environmenal Protection Agency's spokesman on pesticides, Al
Heier, said: ``We have always been concerned about fungicides, but
we're not going to cancel all of them.''
   Heier said federal law requires the agency to balance benefits
against risks when judging any pesticides, and said the agency
adheres to that mandate.
   John M. Urbanchuk, senior vice president and director of
economics for the consulting firm, said, ``If fungicides were
eliminated, you the consumer would pay more for lower-quality
produce. You would find that many fruits and vegetables no longer
look or taste the same as before, and they would cost much more.''
   For example, he said, crops hit hardest would include popular
salad bar crops such as carrots, which would rise 80 percent;
lettuce, 40 percent; tomatoes, 40 percent; and onions, 34 percent.
   Prices of other major crops also would go up sharply, he said.
Peanuts and peanut butter would rise 68 percent; peaches, 37
percent; and potatoes, 37 percent.
   Production of fruits would decline by 32 percent, vegetables by
21 percent, peanuts by 68 percent, and the major grains such as
corn and wheat by 6 percent, he said.
   Urbanchuck said in his statement that poorer families would
suffer the most by not being able to afford higher prices for
fruits and vegetables.
   Lisa Lefferts of the Center for Science in the Public Interest
said she had not studied the chemical industry's report and had no
way to dispute the study's figures.
   But, she said, the current way of growing food with large
amounts of fungicides and other chemicals ``isn't the only way to
do it.''
   In fact, she said, the National Academy of Sciences recently
reported on alternate ways of farming to reduce the contamination
of soil, water and air by cutting back on chemicals.
   ``We're confident, and so is the National Academy of Sciences,
that we can produce foods profitably and competitively using far
fewer fungicides and other pesticides,'' Lefferts said in a
telephone interview.
   ``The most telling statistic would be not how much reduced
fungicide use would cost consumers, but how much it would cost the
chemical industry,'' she said.
   Fungicides represent about $370 million or 7.4 percent of the $5
billion-a-year farm chemicals industry, association officials said.
   An advisory board for the study included representatives of the
association, the National Association of Wheat Growers, National
Food Processors Association, Fertilizer Institute, Resources for
the Future and the Agriculture Department.

   The stock market declined broadly Monday in
selling that hit defense contractors especially hard.

   Stock prices in London fell sharply Monday on
worries about the pound and a weak start on Wall Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 38.3
points, or 1.7 percent, at 2,183.1, also its session minimum. It
began the session off just 1.1 points at 2,220.3.
   Volume amounted to a modest 364.9 million shares, compared with
507.5 million shares Friday.
   Some dealers said the drop across the board came as players
began anticipating Thursday's release of British trade figures,
which analysts expect to show a further deterioration.
   But other dealers said they didn't see any wholesale dumping of
positions. Many said it was a typically sluggish Monday with little
substantive news to move share prices.
   After the market's recent sharp technical rally, some market
watchers contended that the move higher over the last month might
finally be coming to an end, as players begin to focus more
squarely on the condition of the British economy.

   The long-running battle for LIN Broadcasting
Corp. took another twist Monday as McCaw Cellular Communications
Inc. increased its cash tender offer for a controlling interest in
LIN by $625 million to $3.4 billion.
   McCaw also said that if its offer succeeded, it would have LIN
borrow $425 million to buy McCaw stock which then would be
distributed to remaining LIN shareholders.
   ``Our amended offer, which has a value more than $800 million
higher than our earlier offer, is clearly the superior alternative
for LIN's shareholders,'' said McCaw's chairman and chief
executive, Craig O. McCaw.
   McCaw challenged the New York-based cellular telephone and
broadcasting company to put its new offer to a vote at the
previously scheduled January meeting, at which LIN's shareholders
are being asked to accept a rival offer from BellSouth Corp., the
regional telephone company based in Atlanta.
   The Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw said that if LIN refuses, it
intends to ``take our case directly to the LIN stockholders'' by
mounting a proxy fight for control of the LIN board.
   LIN said its board would review the revised proposal ``on a
timely basis,'' but urged its shareholders against tendering to
McCaw until its board announced its recommendation. BellSouth said
it was studying the revised offer but that its first reading
indicated its own deal with LIN offered more ``strength and value''
to LIN shareholders.
   In trading in the over-the-counter market, LIN climbed $4.37{ a
share to $120.12{ while McCaw fell $1.25 to $35.75. BellSouth rose
50 cents a share to $51.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Analysts said they valued McCaw's new offer at $123 to $128 a
share, compared with $110 to $113 a share under McCaw's previous
offer and $117 to $124 a share under the BellSouth offer.
   BellSouth is expected to sweeten its offer.
   McCaw, the nation's largest cellular company, has been pursuing
LIN since early June. But LIN has resisted and agreed instead to
merge its cellular operations with those of BellSouth in a deal
that would create a cellular company larger than McCaw.
   Under its latest offer, McCaw said it pay $150 a share for 22.5
million LIN shares, or $3.4 billion. Its previous offer was $125
per share for 22 million shares, a total of $2.75 billion.
   McCaw already owns about 5.1 million LIN shares, and the revised
offer would give it 51.2 percent of LIN's 53.9 million shares,
fully diluted.
   In addition, McCaw said that as soon as possible after the
tender offer is completed McCaw would have LIN buy $425 million of
McCaw stock and distribute it to LIN shareholders, at a value of
$16.17 in stock for each LIN share held.
   The new offer expires at midnight EST Dec. 15, although it would
be extended until the LIN shareholder meeting if LIN puts the bid
to a vote.
   Under the deal with BellSouth, LIN shareholders would get a cash
dividend of $42 a share, stock in the new cellular company that
would be created by the merger of LIN and BellSouth cellular
interests and stock in a new company that would consist of LIN's
seven television stations.
   The participants in both deals have offered guarantees that LIN
shareholders who hold on to their stock in the cellular company
will get private market value for it several years down the road.
   The BellSouth-LIN deal is being submitted to a vote of LIN
shareholders on Jan. 12 and McCaw wants its proposal considered
then also.
   BellSouth and LIN said in announcing their merger deal in
October that they felt the deal could be closed in the first
quarter of 1990.
   But McCaw said regulatory approvals could delay the
BellSouth-LIN deal for up to a year. McCaw said its deal could be
closed much sooner and said it would demonstrate its confidence in
that by pledging to pay interest of 12 percent annually on its cash
tender offer if the offer closes after March 31, 1990.
   McCaw said last week it has received firm commitments totaling
$3 billion from a 22-bank syndicate, which, with about $1.2 billion
of its own cash and marketable securities, is enough to complete
the tender offer.

<HEAD>Fears Over Economy Send Copper Prices Lower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices were sharply lower Monday on New York's
Commodity Exchange as worries about the U.S. economy fueled a
selloff that began last week.
   On other markets, precious metals and energy futures were
higher, while grain, soybean, livestock and pork futures were lower.
   Copper settled .60 cent to 3 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in November at $1.062 cents a pound.
   News that copper stocks in London Metal Exchange-approved
warehouses increased by 12,000 metric tons weighed on the market.
Analysts said the increase in stocks indicates the economy is
weakening.
   ``Copper is an industrial metal, and an economic slowdown means
less building of homes (where copper is used in pipes) and less
industrial uses,'' said analyst Peter Cardillo of Josephthal &amp; Co.
in New York.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's remarks Sunday that there could
be major cuts in defense spending was also seen as a bad sign for
copper.
   Precious metal futures rallied on the Comex as prices on the New
York Stock Exchange fell and the U.S. Treasury bond market
retreated.
   Cardillo said gold prices also were influenced by the failure of
producers to sell at current prices. He said that gloom over
government figures indicating a slowing economy also were a boost
to prices.
   Gold was $3.50 to $3.70 higher with November at $398.20 a troy
ounce; silver was 1.6 cents to 2.9 cents higher with November at
$5.688 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean prices closed lower on the Chicago Board of
Trade as selling to take profits weighed on soybean futures.
   Analyst Joel Karlin of Research Department Inc. said the selling
was technical in nature on the perception that soybean futures were
overbought. Futures also were pressured by a lack of export
business.
   Corn prices were lower due to a spillover effect from the
selloff in the soybean pits, although corn futures received support
from reports of Far East buying and news that Mexico may enter the
market this week.
   Wheat prices received a boost from concerns about dry weather
conditions in the winter wheat crop region, Karlin said. The latest
six- to 10-day forecast by the National Weather Service is calling
for continued dry conditions in the Central Plains.
   Wheat was } cent to 2{ cents higher with December at $4.10} a
bushel; corn was { cent to 2} cents lower with December at $2.37\ a
bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2\ cents lower with December at
$1.45{ a bushel; soybeans were 8{ cents to 10} cents lower with
November at $5.75\ cents a bushel.
   Energy futures were higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
with the rally led by heating oil.
   A cold snap on the East Coast last week generated interest in
heating oil on expectation of increased consumer demand, said
analyst Jerry Samuels of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Also acting as a spur to prices is the coming meeting in Vienna
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ministers.
   ``You don't sell before OPEC meetings,'' Samuels said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 3 cents to 16 cents higher
with December at $20.07 a barrel; heating oil was .53 cent to .81
cent higher with December at 60.08 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .27 cent to .50 cent higher with December at 52.22
cents a gallon.
   Livestock and pork futures were lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   The drop in hog futures reflected lower cash market prices, said
analyst Mike Swinford of Balfour Maclaine Corp. in Chicago. Frozen
pork bellies were lower due to the rejection Friday by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture of offers for purchases of pork bellies
to ship to Poland.
   Cattle prices were mostly lower, but received some support from
higher cash prices, Swinford said.
   Live cattle were .30 cent lower to .35 cent higher with December
at 75.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .30 cent
lower with November at 83.10 cents a pound; hogs were .27 cent to
.50 cent lower with December at 49.47 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .98 cent to 1.30 cents lower with February at 62.90
cents a pound.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower; Gold Continues To Climb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against most major foreign
currencies Monday as traders were scared off by central bank
intervention and the possibility that U.S. interest rates might
decline.
   Gold prices continued to climb.
   Traders said the dollar fell after the central banks of several
countries, including the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan,
sold the U.S. currency in hopes of forcing it lower.
   The dollar also was hurt by signs of progress from Washington on
budget cuts, said Jack Barbanel, a foreign exchange analyst with
First Global Asset Management Inc.
   Congressional leaders said Monday they were close to agreement
on a bill reducing the federal budget deficit, while Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney was considering $180 billion in military
spending cuts over the next six years.
   Budget cuts might give the Federal Reserve Board some leeway to
allow interest rates to fall, Barbanel said. If rates decline in
the United States while remaining high overseas, the dollar would
be less attractive to foreign investors.
   In earlier trading abroad, the dollar was mixed. Dealers said
the dollar initially rose on reports of planned military spending
cuts, but the currency was unable to maintain its advance.
   Late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.8338 West German marks, down from 1.8410;
1.62975 Swiss francs, down from 1.6307; 6.2435 French francs, down
from 6.2630; 1,350.00 Italian lire, down from 1,355.00; and 1.7105
Canadian dollars, up from 1.6945.
   The British pound fell sharply against the dollar, prompting the
Bank of England to buy pounds for dollars. Dealers said there was
some nervousness about the October British trade figures due on
Thursday in view of increasing deficits in recent months.
   In London, one pound cost $1.5595, cheaper for buyers than late
Friday's $1.5705, and in New York, the pound fell to $1.5582 from
$1.5670 late Friday.
   Other rates for the dollar in Europe late Monday, compared with
Friday's late rates, included: 1.8360 West German marks, down from
1.8410; 1.6315 Swiss francs, unchanged; 6.2465 French francs, down
from 6.2590; 2.0760 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0770; 1,351.00
Italian lire, down from 1,353.50; and 1.1712 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1697.
   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar closed at 144.67 Japanese yen, up
from 143.98 yen. In London, the dollar closed lower at 144.50 yen,
but it rose in New York to 144.355 yen from late Friday's 144.25.
   Gold bullion prices continued the steady upward climb of the
past three weeks and dealers said they expected to see the $400
level tested soon.
   In New York, Republic National Bank quoted a late bid of $398
for a troy ounce of gold, up $3.75. On the Commodity Exchange of
New York, a troy ounce rose $3.60 to $398.20.
   In earlier London trading, gold closed at a bid $396.50 a troy
ounce, up from $392.25. The closing bid price in Zurich was
$396.65, up from $391.50.
   In Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid $396.40, up from $392.05.
   Silver rose 1.6 cents to $5.688 a troy ounce on the Commodity
Exchange. In earlier London trading, silver was quoted at $5.74 bid
a troy ounce, up from $5.61.

<HEAD>Tax Break for Ethanol Additive Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a boost to the nation's corn farmers, the
Treasury Department said Monday it plans to give a tax break to a
new ethanol-based fuel additive that President Bush brought to
public attention last summer.
   The change in Treasury Department policy would make ethyl
tertiary butyl ether, or ETBE, eligible for the same fuel-tax
examption now applied to ethanol that is blended directly into
gasoline _ 60 cents per gallon of additive.
   A public hearing on the plan is scheduled for Jan. 4, said Steve
Pyrek, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service.
   The tax break could make it economical for oil companies to make
the ether additive from ethanol rather than methanol, a product of
natural gas, supporters say. That would be a boon to the Farm Belt,
as it is estimated that ETBE manufacturing would consume 50 million
bushels of corn a year.
   ``The environmenal benefits are great. The benefits to
agriculture are great. This policy change on the part of the
administration is a tremendous victory for us all,'' said Sen. Tom
Daschle, D-S.D.
   Bush drove an ETBE-powered car during a trip this spring to
Nebraska to promote clean air legislation that proposed requiring
the sale of a million such clean-fuel automobiles in the nation's
most polluted cities.
   Cars running on ETBE-blended gasoline emit less carbon monoxide,
unburned hydrocarbons and toxics such as benzene, Daschle said.

<TEXT>
   The Maine Audubon Society asked lawmakers
Monday to protect vast land holdings at stake in the
Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s attempted takeover of Great Northern
Nekoosa Corp. from developers.
   The environmental concerns came one day after Atlanta-based
Georgia-Pacific upped its bid to $63 a share from $58 a share.
Great Northern's board planned to meet Tuesday to discuss the offer.
   Great Northern, incorporated in Maine but based in Norwalk,
Conn., has said it has no interest in being purchased. Great
Northern stock closed at $61.62{ in New York Stock Exchange trading
Monday, up 62{ cents.
   Georgia-Pacific has said it does not plan to sell any of the
lands to developers to pay for the takeover, some state officials
and environmentalists are worried that could happen.
   ``Control of the state's timberlands, so vital to the
prosperity, quality of life and Maine's people, rests in Wall
Street, not at home,'' Audubon Society Executive Director Thomas
Urquhart said in a letter to Gov. John R. McKernan and legislative
leaders.
   ``Here at home, the Georgia-Pacific and Great Northern Nekoosa
forest lands are real places with exceptional values to our
citizens for recreation, wildlife habitat and sustainable
employment,'' he wrote. ``They are not merely assets on a ledger.''
   Urquhart said the Audubon Society wants the timber companies to
agree that Great Northern's 2.1 million acres of Maine will remain
in use as forest lands with no change in public use.
   If they refuse, he said the state Legislature should pass a law
requiring companies to prevent forest lands from being developed.
   The Audubon Society said it had no specific proposals for
protecting the land. Urquhart suggested drafting an easement giving
forestry or conservation rights to the land.
   McKernan already has asked the two timber companies for stronger
assurances that certain woodlands would be protected. The Audubon
Society said it supported the governor's efforts but wanted further
guarantees.

<TEXT>
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. said Monday it had agreed
to buy mainframe computer software maker Management Science America
Inc. for $333 million in cash.
   New York-based Dun &amp; Bradstreet said the companies reached a
definitive merger agreement at a price of $18.50 a share after
unanimous approval by MSA's board of directors.
   MSA's stock rose $6 a share to $18.12{ a share in
over-the-counter trading, a gain of about 50 percent.
   The two companies are close and leading competitors in providing
mainframe software for general ledger accounting, accounts payable,
accounts receivable and inventory control.
   Although mainframe computers are perceived as dinosaurs by some,
the software segment the companies serve is growing a healthy 16
percent a year. The deal comes at a difficult time for Dun &amp;
Bradstreet, a $4.3 billion business information company which last
week announced an expensive overhaul of its credit-services
operation after widespread consumer complaints. The company said
per-share earnings would fall about 10 percent next year.
   Atlanta-based MSA recently returned to profitability. It earned
about $10 million in the first nine months of this year after
losses of $20 million in the same period a year earlier. It is less
than a tenth the size of Dun &amp; Bradstreet, with $196 million in
revenue through the first three quarters.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet said it would merge MSA with its own slightly
smaller McCormack &amp; Dodge software operation to create a new
organization with its own board of directors, Dun &amp; Bradstreet
Software Services.
   The company will focus on products for mainframe computers made
by International Business Machines Corp., but will also make
software for Digital Equipment Corp. computers and ``certain other
vendors,'' Dun &amp; Bradstreet said.
   MSA's chairman and chief executive, John P. Imlay Jr., will be
chairman and principal executive officer of the new unit. Frank H.
Dodge, president of McCormack &amp; Dodge, will be vice chairman.
   ``Given the constant changes in the very competitive software
and services industry, this merger is a tremendous opportunity for
both organizations,'' Imlay said in a statement.
   Completion of the deal depends on clearance by antitrust
authorities, which could take time because the businesses overlap
so closely. But Imlay said in an interview that the business is
``so big, with so many competitors,'' that he did not expect a
problem.
   The deal also depends on Dun &amp; Bradstreet being tendered a
majority of the outstanding shares by the current MSA shareholders.
Toward that goal, Dun &amp; Bradstreet said it already had commitments
from holders of 40 percent of MSA's shares.
   One of the MSA shareholders that agreed to tender its shares was
IBM, which bought a 5 percent stake earlier this year. In addition,
Imlay himself owns about 16 percent of the shares and is tendering
them.
   In an effort to reassure customers, Dun &amp; Bradstreet said the
products of both MSA and McCormack &amp; Dodge would be preserved and
enhanced. Sometimes companies try to save money by eliminating
overlapping products.
   Charles Federman, a partner in the investment banking firm of
Broadview Associates of Fort Lee, N.J., said some customers might
desert in spite of the assurances. ``Users have just had their
status un-quoed,'' he said.
   But Imlay, in an interview, denied there was anything to fear.
``Both of us has a history of great customer service and that's why
we're together, really,'' he said.

   A Connecticut utility said Monday it
would drop out of the bidding for Public Service Company of New
Hampshire if an endorsed offer by another Connecticut power company
holds up.
   United Illuminating of New Haven, Conn., made the decision after
an announcement Saturday that creditors and shareholders had
endorsed a bid by Northeast Utilities of Berlin, Conn.
   Public Service also has made a proposal to bring itself out of a
22-month-old bankruptcy reorganization. Public Service lawyer
Richard Levin said the utility has not decided whether to stay in
the competition. Levin said Public Service first wants to study the
Northeast proposal.
   Larry Smukler, the state's chief negotiator in the bankruptcy
negotiations, said the state would not comment on the plan until it
had studied it, ``although we anticipate agreement.''
   The comments came in the first U.S. Bankruptcy Court session
since Public Service creditors signed on to the $2.3 billion
Northeast buyout proposal.
   Bankruptcy Judge James Yacos gave Northeast until 5 p.m. next
Monday to submit its agreement to parties in the case, the first
bankruptcy of a major utility since the Great Depression.
   If shareholders, creditors and the state still agree on
Northeast Utilities' consensual plan, United Illumniating said it
would withdraw its proposal.
   Northeast also said it hoped to reach agreement with the state
on a rate plan by the end of the week.
   Despite the creditors' backing, shareholders and creditors still
must take a formal vote and the judge will make a final ruling on
the proposals.
   Also Monday, officials set a tentative Dec. 14 date for a
special legislative session to amend or repeal a state law that
bars charging ratepayers for power plants before they operate.
   The three plans for the utility call for rate increases
effective Jan. 1 to begin paying for the Seabrook nuclear plant,
making any change in the law necessary by that date.
   Completed in 1986, the plant remains idle for lack of a federal
operating license, but its owners expect it to begin operating
early next year.
   The Northeast plan calls for annual 5.5 percent rate increases
in each of the next seven years, but allows for additional hikes if
fuel costs skyrocket or Northeast is unable to earn a specified
return on its investment.

   Oil futures prices rose in moderate trading
Monday, boosted by colder weather and technical factors.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
rose 16 cents to finish at $20.07 a 42-gallon barrel. Analysts said
late buyers helped push the contract higher before its expiration
at the close of trading.
   The January crude contract also gained 16 cents to close at
$19.99 a barrel.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, No. 2 heating oil
for December delivery rose 0.81 cent to 60.08 cents a gallon. The
January contract gained 0.78 cent to 59.88 cents and February
increased 0.70 cent to 58.73 cents a gallon.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 0.27 cent to 52.22 cents a
gallon, while the January contract climbed 0.38 cent to 52.98 cents
a gallon.
   Analysts attributed Monday's gains partly to technical factors
after last week's technical losses.
   Cold weather in some parts of the nation also helped boost
heating oil prices, they said, while reports of possible supply
disruptions stemming from this weekend's fire at a Chevron refinery
gave gasoline futures a lift.
   A petroleum distillation unit was damaged during the blaze at
the El Segundo, Calif., plant, but no damage estimates were
released.
   Energy analysts said underlying optimism ahead of Saturday's
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is
helping support prices, although it is difficult to say how much of
a factor it is in actual buying and selling.
   ``We're starting to see the mentality get a little more
positive, but I wouldn't call it a bullish mentality,'' said Tom
Bentz, director of futures trading for United Energy Inc. in New
York.
   OPEC is scheduled to meet in Vienna, Austria, starting Saturday
to set strategy for 1990, including production allocations for each
of the 13 member countries.

<TEXT>
   Texas Instruments Inc. said Monday it plans to cut
up to 1,500 jobs, mainly in the United States, citing a slowdown in
demand for its computer memory chips.
   The cut would represent a reduction of slightly less than 3
percent of its U.S. work force if all the cuts came in the United
States. Accounting for some of the cuts is the closing of an
obsolete wafer fabrication plant in Dallas.
   Texas Instruments said it would take a pre-tax charge against
earnings of about $55 million in the fourth quarter. About $25
million covers the cost of cuts and upgrades in the semiconductor
business, while the rest is split evenly between cost reductions in
the information technology group and cost adjustments on
fixed-price defense contracts.
   The move came later on a day in which the company announced in
Japan that it will hire several hundred Japanese scientists and
engineers for a new research and development center in Tsukuba,
about 40 miles northeast of Tokyo.
   Texas Instruments spokeswoman Terri West said the company plans
to seek the job reduction as much as possible through voluntary
means, such as retirements, early retirements (at age 55),
voluntary terminations and ``bridged early retirements'' (for those
younger than 55).
   Two similar reduction efforts earlier this year resulted in
about 2,000 jobs being trimmed from the firm's corporate and
defense systems groups.
   The company has about 75,000 employees worldwide, with about
51,000 of those in the United States. About 80 percent of the U.S.
workforce is concentrated in Texas.
   Reductions will be sought within information technology group
operations in Hunt Valley, Md.; Johnson City, Tenn.; North Texas;
and the Texas cities of Austin Temple and Houston.
   Semiconductor group reductions will be asked in Dallas.
   Voluntary reductions will be sought among materials and control
groups personnel at Attlesboro, Mass., and Versaille, Ky.
   Specific targets at each facility are being withheld, Ms. West
said.
   The cutbacks in materials and controls group are necessary
because of a weakness in the appliance market and a slowness in the
automotive market, TI officials said in a statement explaining the
pre-tax charge.

   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said Monday it is
cutting stockbroker commissions for the first time in 15 years,
reflecting an industry-wide slowdown in brokerage activity by
individual investors.
   Shearson, the nation's second-largest retail brokerage, said the
portion of the commission that a broker gets for selling investment
products would be trimmed by 1 to 2 percentage points in 1990.
   Analysts said the reduction was the first direct commission
cutback by a brokerage house on Wall Street, where profits have
lagged partly part because of an exodus of individual investors
since the October 1987 stock market crash.
   In the past year, other firms have imposed a variety of customer
fees that go directly to the brokerage but do not affect the size
of brokers' commission.
   Such fees result in ``a slightly higher take for the company
than it does for the representative, but it's not as brutal as
this,'' said James P. Hanbury, a securities industry analyst with
Wertheim Schroeder Inc.
   ``You're trying to raise the revenue to the firm because the
overall business is not that robust,'' he said. ``Either the
business gets better or you're going to see'' other firms cutting
commissions.
   Shearson, which is 61 percent owned by American Express Co., has
been contemplating trimming the commission a broker gets _ known as
the payout rate _ by 4 to 5 percentage points over the next four to
five years, said Shearson spokesman Michael O'Neill.
   Shearson retail brokers brought in commissions averaging
$228,000 this year. Shearson paid 46.5 percent of the total back to
brokers and their supervisors in direct payments, employee benefits
and deferred payments.
   In 1986, when an average Shearson retail broker brought in
$265,000 in commissions, the payout rate was 43 percent.
   Shearson also has been stung by declining profits and a low
stock price. The firm earlier this month announced it was laying
off up to 800 employees and restructuring its senior management.
The management changes are expected to be announced after
Thanksgiving
   Shearson stock fell 37{ cents to close at $16.37{ in New York
Stock Exchange trading Monday.
   While not slashing commissions, virtually all Wall Street firms
have imposed ``handling'' fees on customer accounts to help enhance
revenue without boosting expenses.
   Earlier this month, for example, Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. imposed a
$2.50 handling charge on all individual investors' stock and bond
trades. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the nation's largest brokerage,
boosted its service charge last year to $2.35 for each trade from
$1.85.
   The Securities Industry Association expects third-quarter
industry pre-tax profits to be about half of the $1 billion in
pre-tax profits in the second quarter.
   The second-quarter profit marked a sharp jump from $200 million
in the previous quarter and was attributed to increased volume and
declining interest rates. The bulk of the recovery came from the 10
largest investment banks, many of which recovered from
first-quarter losses.
   But retail commissions accounted for just 17 percent of revenue
in the first half of the year, unchanged from 1988 but down 25
percent from 1987 and 35 percent from 1980.
   At Shearson, the reduction in the payout rate is intended to
increase revenue to avoid a credit rating downgrade of its
commercial paper by Moody's Investors Service Inc.
   Hardwick Simmons, a Shearson vice president and head of retail
brokerage operations, told Shearson brokers at a meeting in Beverly
Hills, Calif., last week that reducing the payout rate would help
placate Moody's.
   A lower commercial paper rating would squeeze Shearson's profit
margin on the difference between what it costs the firm to borrow
money and what it earns.
   Simmons said a downgrade of one notch in the commercial paper
rating could cost Shearson $20 million a year in higher interest
payments and a two-notch downgrade could cost double that amount.
Commercial paper is a short-term corporate IOU that companies sell
to raise money to run operations.
   ``Our payout rate is too high,'' Simmons said. ``The industry
can't take it.''

<HEAD>Japanese, Pemex Agree To 5-Year Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   -Japanese oil companies have agreed to buy 150,000
barrels a day of crude oil from Mexico for the next five years,
company officials said Tuesday.
   The contract, which begins in January, was agreed to last week
between Pemex, the Mexican state oil company, and a group of 20
Japanese oil refiners that have joined to form the Association of
Japanese Importers of Mexican Crude Oil.
   Prices for the shipments of Isthmus and Maya crude oils will be
set monthly.
   The total volume is down from the current 180,000 barrels that
Mexico has shipped to Japan since January 1980 under a 10-year
contract. The reduction is entirely in the Isthmus grade, which
Mexico said it needs to support growing domestic demand.

   Machinists who struck Boeing Co. for 48 days
voted Monday evening on a three-year contract offer that covers
57,800 workers in at least nine states and could become a standard
for the aerospace industry.
   Union members voted near Wichita, Kan., and were to gather in
Seattle and Portland, Ore., to vote on the agreement reached Sunday
with the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial jets. Results
were not expected until early Tuesday.
   Tom Baker, president of Seattle's District Lodge 751 of the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,
predicted earlier that the deal would be overwhelmingly approved.
Boeing chief negotiator Larry McKean said strikers could be back at
work Wednesday.
   The company's second-longest strike virtually halted production,
delaying deliveries to airlines at a time of growing passenger
loads and rising concern over aging jets.
   The Machinists union represents about 43,300 workers in Seattle,
12,000 in Wichita, 1,700 in Portland and a few hundred more in
scattered sites, including California, Hawaii, Utah, Wyoming,
Montana, North Dakota and other states.
   Reporters were barred from the meeting at the Kansas Coliseum
north of Wichita. Dozens of people stayed only long enough to pick
up a seven-page explanation of the offer.
   There was no clearcut sentiment among union members who left
early.
   ``I voted to go back to work,'' said Rodney Nobles of Wichita.
``I think it's a good contract. They gave us our lump-sum
improvements.''
   Galan Smith, 22, of Wichita, said he voted against the contract.
   ``We're wanting a larger wage increase in the general wage,'' he
said. ``We've been out long enough, we feel like they should make
up for some of what we've gone through.''
   Baker said the proposed contract substantially improves two
earlier Boeing offers, including boosting the total dollar value.
   Other union leaders were less satisfied. Justin Ostro, an
international union vice president who coordinates aerospace
industry negotiations for the Machinists, said Boeing workers were
entitled to ``a great deal more.''
   Boeing officials said they were pleased with the pact.
   According to a handout distributed at the Kansas Coliseum, the
offer included four major improvements from the Oct. 3 proposal
machinists overwhelmingly rejected before going on strike the next
day:
   _ Lump-sum bonuses of 10 percent of gross pay the first year, 5
percent the second and 4 percent the third.
   _ A 60-cent-per-hour cost-of-living increase immediately, with
quarterly increases thereafter.
   _ An increase in the cost-of-living adjustment base pay by 45
cents an hour to make up for a 1986 adjustment workers didn't get.
   _ A cut in mandatory overtime to two consecutive weekends and
144 hours per quarter, with double-time pay after 160 hours, down
from 200 mandatory hours of overtime per quarter and four
consecutive weekends in the previous contract.
   Machinists have said that after six years of accepting yearly
bonuses rather than wage increases, Boeing workers were entitled to
a healthy chunk of the company's prosperity.
   Boeing had record earnings in its most recent quarter and has a
backlog of orders for more than 1,700 jets worth about $85 billion,
with delivery dates stretching beyond the turn of the century.
   A settlement with Boeing machinists traditionally has set the
pattern for other aerospace companies, especially Lockheed Corp.
and McDonnell Douglas Corp., as well as for other unions at Boeing.
   The Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association,
which represents about 28,000 engineers and technical workers, has
agreed to extend its contract with Boeing, which expires Dec. 1.
   Boeing Helicopters in Philadelphia and United Auto Workers Local
1069, which represents about 3,000 production workers, extended
their pact beyond its Oct. 4 expiration.
   Union contracts between machinists at McDonnell Douglas in
Torrence, Calif. and Lockheed Corp. at Burbank, Calif., expired in
October, but negotiations have been extended. Those talks are
separate from the Boeing negotiations, and the outcome of the
Seattle talks had no direct effect.
   Don Nakamoto, spokesman for Machinists District Lodge 727 in
Burbank, acknowledged the Boeing developments have been closely
watched.
   ``I'm sure it will have some impact,'' Nakamoto said. ``It's
hard to say what it will be but I think both parties will be taking
a hard look to see what it means to our talks.''
   During the strike, Boeing, using supervisory and non-striking
workers, delivered 22 planes, but all were virtually complete and
out of the factories before the walkout.
   Boeing has said the strike will have a serious financial impact
during the last quarter of the year, but has not given specific
forecasts.
   The last Boeing strike, in 1977, lasted 45 days. There was a
19-day strike in 1965, and a 140-day walkout in 1948.
