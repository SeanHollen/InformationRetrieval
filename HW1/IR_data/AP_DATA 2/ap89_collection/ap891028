   A former funeral director was
sentenced Friday to 28 years and 11 months in prison for burying
the dead with trash in their coffins or without prepaid vaults.
   Robertson County Circuit Judge John Peay sentenced Bobby Wilks
less than three weeks after Wilks pleaded guilty to 48 counts of
burial fraud.
   Wilks, 53, entered the pleas to a 71-count indictment on Oct. 11
and opted for sentencing by a judge rather than face a jury trial,
prosecutors said.
   Relatives of the burial victims had called for a harsh sentence
for the Millsdale mortician.
   Exhumations last fall revealed more than 25 bodies buried by
Wilks' business had been buried improperly in Robertson and Sumner
counties, and Simpson County, Ky.

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trial of former Exxon Valdez
skipper Joseph Hazelwood will be held in Anchorage despite defense
claims that it will be hard to field an impartial jury in this port
city.
   ``If Oliver North can get a fair trial, I'm sure Capt. Hazelwood
can get a fair trial, too,'' Anchorage Superior Court Judge Karl
Johnstone said at a hearing Friday.
   Prosecutors had earlier agreed that Valdez, where the tanker
picked up its load before causing the nation's worst oil spill
March 24, was an inappropriate site for the trial.
   Hazelwood's lawyer, Dick Madson, of Fairbanks, argued that an
opinion poll showed that inland Fairbanks was the city most likely
to offer a fair trial. He said people in Anchorage, which lies on
the coast about 350 miles south of Fairbanks, were more likely to
be influenced by ties to maritime industries affected by the spill.
   Anchorage prosecutor Brent Cole pushed for his city, saying it
offered a much bigger pool of potential jurors. The city's
population of 250,000 is about five times the size of Fairbanks.
   Hazelwood faces misdemeanor and felony charges stemming from the
crash of the tanker in Prince William Sound. Exxon fired the
skipper soon after the ship struck a charted reef and spilled
nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil, polluting miles of
shoreline and killing wildlife.
   The trial on charges of recklessness, negligent discharge of oil
and operating a vessel while intoxicated is scheduled to open Jan.
22 and is likely to last at least three weeks.
   Hazelwood, who lives in Huntington, N.Y., listened to Friday's
hearing by telephone from a New York law office.

<HEAD>Batman, Bakkers Big Hits at Halloween</HEAD>

   Jim Bakker will be going places this
Halloween, even though he's in prison.
   Jim and Tammy Bakker costumes are among the most popular get-ups
for tricksters this Halloween, says the owner of a costume shop.
   ``We put Jim Bakker in a convict suit and everybody likes
that,'' said Lisa Marshall, owner of Balloon Express in Clarksburg,
which is 100 miles northeast of Charleston. ``Jim Bakker's rented
out for the rest of the week.''
   Elsewhere, Batman proved to be more than just a hit at the box
office, overwhelming some costumers who couldn't keep up with the
demand for Caped Crusader Halloween outfits.
   ``Batman _ he's the top dog,'' said Joel Gardner, assistant to
the general manager at Masters Tuxedo in Charleston.
   Wickham Costume Service in the northern West Virginia community
of Wheeling isn't renting Batman outfits and was even unable to
find any to sell, said Sandy Materkoski, a receptionist pressed
into duty as a saleswoman during the seasonal crunch.
   ``We had a couple of people who were willing to buy, but when we
called the supplier who would have sent them to us, they were out,
and that was in September,'' she said Friday.
   Masters Tuxedo found a licensed supplier in North Carolina, but
not even Gotham City's most famous do-gooder could defeat the
weather.
   ``Batman was delayed by Hurricane Hugo,'' Gardner said Friday.
``They were manufactured, and the hurricane knocked down their
computers, so they couldn't bill or ship.'' He still hoped for a
pre-Halloween shipment.
   Being the Caped Crusader costs an arm and a bat-leg. A Batman
costume rental goes for $85, and buying the cape and accessories
will (POW!) set you back (BAM!) $450, Gardner said.
   Other popular outfits include ``sexy types for women,'' Marshall
said, including belly dancers and Playboy bunnies.
   In Huntington, Magic Makers Costumes has turned off its
telephones until November because of the Halloween crunch, but a
taped answering machine message provides a glimpse of what's
popular there.
   The recording says the company has some masks of Batman and
Freddy Krueger, the razor-fingered star of the Nightmare on Elm
Street movies, but no more masks of two other popular slashers _
Michael Myers from the ``Halloween'' series and Jason from ``Friday
the 13th.''
   ``Freddy is still popular this year, but he's being overtaken by
Friday the 13th,'' Gardner said. ``In the adult rentals, it's
running about the same as last year, from the French maid for women
to Arab sheiks for men.''
   Batman may find fame fleeting. One year's most popular outfits
can become the next year's dust collectors.
   ``Alf was in last year,'' Marshall said. ``It's gone now.''

   Dozens of engine parts from the United

   Company investigators still are unsure if the parts recovered to

<HEAD>Shipments of Weapons Materials Again Suspended in Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department is suspending commercial
shipments of tritium for the second time in four months because of
another unexplained loss of the material used in nuclear warheads.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., lambasted the department Friday,
saying it had bungled the investigation at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tenn.
   ``You have to wonder what kind of Keystone Kops operation the
Department of Energy has down at Oak Ridge when they lose more than
22,000 curies of tritium in a test designed to find out why DOE
keeps on losing track of tritium,'' he said. A curie is the unit
used to measure radioactivity.
   The department usually sells about $5.6 million of tritium a
year to private companies that use it in research and the
manufacture of luminous lights and dials.
   Most tritium, however, is used as a vital component in nuclear
warheads.
   ``For now, we're on hold on making further shipments,'' said Oak
Ridge spokesman Jim Alexander.
   Murray Rosenthal, deputy director of the lab, said in a
telephone interview that investigators had not ruled out the
possibility the material was stolen. He said, however, that there
was no evidence of theft and that a more likely explanation was
that the equipment that handles the gas had developed an air leak.
   Rosenthal said shipments were suspended Oct. 5, shortly after it
was discovered that a small amount of tritium shipped to a
commercial customer in California was missing. No date has been set
for resuming shipments, Rosenthal said.
   Spokesmen at department headquarters in Washington said they had
no firm information about the situation at Oak Ridge. They said
questions about missing tritium and the Oak Ridge operation were
being reviewed by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins.
   Senior officials directly involved in the issue declined to
accept a reporter's phone calls.
   The department announced a halt in shipments from Oak Ridge in
July after an inconclusive search for about 5 grams of tritium that
lab records said had been shipped to commercial customers but that
buyers said never arrived. Shipments resumed in August, although
not all of the lost material had been recovered.
   An internal lab report on efforts last summer to account for the
missing material said theft was possible but unlikely.
   A copy of the confidential report and related Oak Ridge
documents were obtained by The Associated Press earlier this week
under a Freedom of Information Act request.
   Investigators for Martin Marietta Energy Systems Inc., which
runs Oak Ridge under an Energy Department contract, said in the
July report that a significant amount of tritium was lost during a
test shipment between lab buildings.
   Based on figures in the report, it appeared the loss amounted to
about 2 grams. That's about half the amount needed to make a single
atomic warhead, according to private analysts.
   The test shipment was arranged as part of a broader effort to
find reasons for the shipping discrepancies.
   Workers loaded tritium into a container, sent it across the lab
to another building, unloaded part of it for sampling, reloaded it,
sent it back to the original building and unloaded it again. For
reasons not yet publicly explained, three-quarters of the tritium
was lost in the round trip.
   Leakage from the containers and other procedural problems were
ruled out.

   The chairman of a House panel investigating
allegations of wrongdoing at HUD during the Reagan administration
says its inquiry is likely to end soon, but that the subcommittee
has shown there was a ``colossal scandal'' at the agency.
   ``I have high hopes the Justice Department will do its duty,''
subcommittee chairman Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said Friday after
former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. again refused to testify.
   Lantos excused Pierce from a subpoena requiring another
appearance next week and said the panel, faced with a refusal to
testify from three other former top HUD officials, would soon end
its inquiry.
   The subcommittee, Lantos said, had ``demonstrated a colossal
scandal'' existed at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development during the Reaga administration. The panel is
investigating allegations of fraud, influence-peddling and
mismanagement.
   Lantos said the subcommittee doesn't plan to offer immunity from
prosecution to Pierce or his former aides as a way of compelling
them to testify, though that remains an option.
   Pierce invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination for a second time Friday, and some lawmakers
called for a special prosecutor.
   ``Now it's clear that Sam Pierce is stonewalling,'' said Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``Our only choice now is to take the
process from the legislative arena and move it into the arena of an
independent counsel.''
   Pierce said he wants to tell his story but refused to answer any
questions, saying he had been made a target of the subcommittee's
investigation and ``unfairly accused of alleged lies and
dishonesty.''
   ``I look forward to the time when innuendoes and rumors to the
contrary are put to rest,'' he said. ``I look forward to the time
when I can tell my story, and I can assure you I do have a story to
tell.''
   Pierce testified voluntarily before the panel in May. But he
refused to testify last month when the panel subpoenaed him to
answer questions about what members say are inconsistencies and
contradictions between his and other witnesses' testimony.
   Lantos put a series of questions to Pierce, including one about
a former HUD official's contradiction of the former secretary's
testimony that he did not influence the selection of HUD subsidy
awards.
   Pierce called the question ``unfair'' and refused to answer.
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., said Pierce's earlier testimony
on that point ``could be perjury'' and told Pierce it was ``in your
best interest'' to answer.
   After Pierce's latest refusal, Schumer and Rep. Bruce Morrison,
D-Conn., both members of the House Judiciary Committee, said they
would seek a vote to formally ask the Justice Department to name a
special prosecutor to investigate Pierce.
   Only a majority of the members of either party on the Judiciary
Committee is required to initiate a formal process requiring a
review of the request and response by Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, Schumer said.
   ``I think it's clear from these hearings ... that there is
criminal activity at HUD in the area of defrauding of the federal
government, conspiracy to defraud the government, and we may well
have perjury,'' said Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn.
   Lantos, meanwhile, disclosed that Pierce had asked HUD to pay
his legal expenses stemming from the congressional probe. HUD
Secretary Jack Kemp rejected the request, Lantos said.

<HEAD>U.S. Names Noriega Agent of Cuba</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans doing business with Panama's Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega could face up to a 12-year prison sentence
under a Bush administration declaration naming him an agent of Cuba.
   Noriega, his wife Felicidad Sieiro de Noriega and 32 companies,
including several hotels and airport duty-free shops, are being
added to the list of 134 businesses and individuals already
identified as Cuban agents in Panama, the Treasury Department
announced Friday.
   ``This action is another step in the United States' efforts to
halt the channeling of funds to the illegal regime of Gen. Noriega
and to neutralize Cuban commercial activities in Panama that serve
to circumvent the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba,'' the
announcement said.
   Fourteen names, including Noriega associate Carlos Duque, were
added to the list Sept. 20.
   Under a World War I statute, the United States has banned trade
by Americans with Cuba since 1960. Violations of that embargo or
similar bans against trade with Cambodia, North Korea and Vietnam
can result in fines up to $500,000 against U.S. corporations and up
to $250,000 against individuals, who can also be imprisoned for a
maximum of 12 years.
   The latest action ``serves to underscore the administration's
resolve to undermine the extensive network of commercial and
financial collusion between the Noriega and Castro regimes.''
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity last week,
had revealed that the designation was imminent. The officials said
they had begun examining ways to bring new pressure to bear on
Noriega even before an abortive coup attempt Oct. 3.
   But the administration has been reluctant to use extreme
measures such as a trade embargo out of concern that hundreds of
American companies in Panama would go bankrupt.
   The new sanction is narrowly targeted at Noriega and his
business partners and is not expected to do major damage to
Panama's economy.
   It is not clear how extensive American business dealings are
with the companies linked to Noriega. Cuba has found these
companies useful to import high technology U.S.-made items which
otherwise would be beyond Cuba's reach because of the trade embargo.
   The companies also have served as conduits for illegal Cuban
exports to the United States.

<HEAD>Watkins Shakes Up Leadership of Nuclear Weapons Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turmoil appears to be growing at top levels of
the Energy Department, spurred in part by Secretary James D.
Watkins' frustration at ineffective leadership in the office
overseeing production of nuclear weapons.
   In an internal memorandum obtained by The Associated Press on
Friday, Watkins told the department's No. 3 official, John Tuck, to
assume temporarily the added title of head of defense programs,
which runs the nuclear weapons system.
   The defense programs office has been without a permanent
director for more than a year.
   ``The vital national security mission of the department can no
longer be carried out under the current management arrangement,''
Watkins wrote, adding that Tuck's assignment was designed to give
the office ``leadership and direction.''
   The central problem for Watkins is that his choice to be
permanent head of the weapons office, Victor Stello, has been
unable to gain Senate confirmation.
   Stello was nominated by the White House in July, but a
confirmation hearing by the Senate Armed Services Committee has not
been scheduled.
   Stello has been sharply criticized by environmentalists and some
members of Congress for being lax on nuclear safety, although he
calls the charge unfair.
   Watkins said he hoped the Stello nomination would be acted upon
soon, but one environmental group opposed to Stello said it
appeared Watkins was anticipating the possibility that Stello
either would be blocked by Congress or dropped by the White House.
   ``He's doomed,'' said Stephen Schwartz, a spokesman for
Greenpeace U.S.A.
   Also Friday, Watkins announced the resignation of Robert O.
Hunter Jr. as director of the office of energy research. Hunter had
drawn criticism in some scientific circles for his efforts to
restructure the department's fusion research program.
   No replacement was announced.
   In a related development, advisers told Watkins on Friday that
the department may be moving too quickly in its plans for
restarting the three idled Savannah River nuclear reactors that
produce a gas needed in nuclear warheads.
   In a letter to Watkins, members of the Advisory Committee on
Nuclear Facility Safety said that while prospects for a safe
resumption of production at Savannah River had improved in recent
months, a number of serious problems remained.
   The chief concern was that training of Westinghouse Corp.
workers who operate the reactors has not included ``reactor
fundamentals'' learned by operators of commercial nuclear reactors.
Westinghouse runs Savannah River under a government contract.
   The Savannah River reactors, built for the government in the
early 1950s, were closed down more 18 months ago because of
mechanical problems and safety concerns. Among the major issues in
planning a restart is whether the operators are adequately trained
and whether Westinghouse puts enough emphasis on safety.
   The advisers told Watkins that while restart planning was
generally good, the absence of operator training in reactor
fundamentals was a serious problem.
   ``That this omission will remain through restart may belie
Westinghouse's claim that safety is their primary concern and that
early restart of the reactors is not the driving factor in
training,'' the letter said.
   In addition, the committee members said Watkins may be biting
off more than he can chew in trying to get all three idled reactors
back in operation within a six-month period starting next summer or
fall.
   It might be wiser, they said, to focus all the best available
talent on restarting one reactor before focusing on another.

<HEAD>Exxon Resigns from National Wildlife Federation Board</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon is resigning from the National Wildlife
Federation's corporate advisory panel because it says the
conservation group has been unfairly critical of the Exxon Valdez
oil spill along the Alaskan coast.
   The federation said Friday that it regrets the resignation, but
issued a stinging response that called Exxon a ``corporate pariah''
that should keep an open dialogue with environmentalists.
   The federation, with 5.8 million members nationwide, has been
one of the sharpest critics of Exxon's handling of the 11 million
gallon tanker spill and has accused the company of repeatedly
ignoring requests to meet and discuss it.
   The March 24 oil spill soiled hundreds of miles of shoreline
along Alaska's southern coast and wreaked havoc with wildlife and
the fishing industry.
   Exxon USA was one of the charter members of the Corporate
Conservation Council, a panel of executives formed in 1982 by the
National Wildlife Federation to foster ``frank and open
discussions'' between industry and the federation's leaders.
   Among the 15 members on the panel are top executives of General
Motors Corp., Monsanto Co., Dow Chemical USA, Dupont, ARCO, Miller
Brewing Co. and Tenneco Inc.
   Raymond Campion, Exxon's environmental coordinator, said in a
letter to the federation that the conservation group had ``not met
our expectations'' in seeking solutions to the nation's
environmental problems.
   ``Recent public actions by you regarding the Valdez oil spill
have failed to demonstrate any sense of objectivity or fairness,''
Campion wrote federation president Jay Hair.
   The federation was among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in
August against Exxon seeking full payment of environmental recovery
costs from the spill.
   Hair returned from Alaska in September with a pile of
oil-stained rocks and distributed them to each member of Congress
to dramatize what a number of environmentalists feel are
shortcomings in Exxon's attempts to clean Alaska's beaches of oil.
   ``I regret we did not meet your `expectations,' but did you
really think your membership on our Corporate Conservation Council
would buy Exxon immunity from the National Wildlife Federation's
response to such a massive and poorly managed environmental
disaster?'' Hair wrote in a reply to Campion's letter.
   ``The fact that Exxon has been judged a corporate pariah in the
court of public opinion has little or nothing to do with the
National Wildlife Federation,'' he wrote. ``That distinction has
been clearly earned by Exxon's leadership.''
   The federation made public the exchange.
   Hair said in a statement that the resignation ``typifies the
insularity of Exxon management.''
   ``Instead of engaging in a constructive dialogue with the
environmental community over this tragedy, Exxon's leaders
apparently would rather complain about how unfairly we have treated
them.''
   Hair said the corporate council was established to promote
exchanges between environmentalists and corporate leaders ``in an
atmosphere of cooperation and respect.''
   ``In our view, Exxon desperately needs this forum now more than
ever,'' Hair said.

   Fans stood for a moment of silence, then
let out a whooping cheer Friday as the World Series resumed 10 days
after a devastating earthquake.
   Rescue workers threw out the first ball and the crowd joined in
singing the 1936 song ``San Francisco'' in opening ceremonies that
began with a moment of silence for those killed and injured in the
quake.
   ``We've had enough time for mourning. Now it's time to celebrate
life,'' said Jean Alvers, 62, who wore a yellow hard hat. ``This
series needs to be played. If they canceled it it would have been a
lot harder to do other things.''
   ``It was OK to be excited,'' said Donna Verhorst of Oakland.
   The Oakland Athletics defeated the San Francisco Giants 13-7,
giving the Athletics a 3-0 advantage in the best of seven series.
   The first cheer went up when the scoreboard lit up with,
``Welcome Back to Game 3'' _ and the stadium shook again, not from
the quake but the roar of the fans.
   Some less fortunate fans watched the game from Red Cross
shelters where televisions were set up for the thousands of people
left homeless.
   ``It takes your mind off the earthquake, and that's good for the
nerves,'' said Winston Presley, 54, as he sat with a cluster of A's
fans in the gymnasium of Oakland's Lowell Middle School.
   For many, the resumption of the Bay Bridge World Series, its
symbol now fractured by the quake, was a kind of therapy in the
wake of the deadly tremor.
   ``Time heals all wounds,'' said Ray Torres, another fan. He and
a friend, Alphonso Castaneda, had seats two rows from the top of
the stadium, and Castaneda had made a banner that read, ``Upper
deck parachute rental.''
   As fans filed in, the public address system periodically said,
``In the event of an aftershock, don't panic ...''
   ``I think it's my attempt to conquer my own fears,'' said Steven
Walch of his decision to attend the game. Having seen Candlestick
shudder and crack, he added, ``I want to be at the World Series,
and I don't think it's more unsafe ... than any other place. And I
want to get back to my normal life.''
   The organizers of the game tried to help. Throwing out the first
balls were 12 representatives of Bay area agencies who assisted in
relief efforts.
   They included workers from the San Francisco Fire Department,
Highland General Hospital in Oakland, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, San
Francisco Police Department, California Department of
Transportation, the California Conservation Corps, the Oakland Fire
Department, the Santa Cruz County Red Cross, Santa Cruz County
Salvation Army, Pacific Bell, San Francisco Sheriff's Department,
and the California Highway Patrol.
   ``We've realized we need all this. Baseball can be part of this
area's mental therapy,'' said Giants manager Roger Craig.
   ``Baseball is the most resilient of all American institutions,''
said Commissioner Fay Vincent, who announced a $1.4 million gift
from baseball to earthquake relief.
   Mail Vincent received from around the country after the quake
urged that the series be called off, he said Friday, adding that he
understood the feelings. ``But I don't think there is any
disrespect in going on with the World Series,'' he said.
   Dave Stewart, starting pitcher for the Oakland Athletics, said
the players have had difficulty preparing for the game.
   ``We've all been through a national tragedy. I'm sure I'm not
alone, but the earthquake had a deep psychological effect on me,''
Stewart said.
   San Francisco Giants outfielder Brett Butler said the game gave
62,000 fans ``a chance to let out all that frustration and hurt and
trauma. This is America's game. It's going to bring all of us in
this area back together again.''
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos agreed. ``We all need a respite,''
he said. ``We can enjoy the World Series and still remember those
we lost and those who are still affected by this tragedy.''
   Six people remained unaccounted for, authorities said, and the
death toll rose Friday to 64, including an 88-year-old San Mateo
woman who was pronounced dead of a heart attack shortly after the
quake but who had not previously been listed among the dead.
   Thirty-nine of those killed were in the collapse of
double-decked Interstate 880 in Oakland. As demolition there
continued, the search for more bodies was delayed because the road
was too shaky.
   In other quake developments:
   _ Dockworker Buck Helm, rescued after four days in the rubble of
I-880, remained in serious condition in Oakland's Highland General
Hospital. He was said to be conscious most of the time.
   _ Julio Berumen, the 6-year-old whose leg was amputated during
rescue from the I-880 rubble, was listed in good condition and
improving at Children's Hospital in Oakland. His sister Cathy, 8,
was in serious but stable condition following surgery Wednesday.
They lost their mother in the freeway collapse. About $48,000 has
been donated to a fund for them.
   _ On Friday, 150 relatives and friends gathered at an El Cerrito
cemetery for the funeral of a woman killed on the collapsing
portion of the Bay Bridge. Anamafi Filoli Moala was buried in a
ceremony typical of the Pacific island of Tonga, with dirges and
many of those present wearing palm grass skirts.
   _ In Santa Cruz on Friday, a wrecker's ball crashed into the
imposing Cooper House, a downtown landmark and centerpiece of the
heavily damaged Pacific Garden Mall. Some who watched the
demolition, which began Thursday, dabbed at tears. For 94 years the
huge brick building was a gathering point for the seaside tourist
town.
   ``We will come back, better than it was,'' said 86-year-old Bill
Davidson.
   _ Lawyer Melvin Belli on Friday filed $22 million worth of
claims against the state on behalf of 10 victims of the collapse of
I-880. If the claims _ $3 million for each of two wrongful deaths
and $2 million for each of eight injured survivors _ are rejected
by the state, civil lawsuits would be filed, Belli said.
   _ A convention of traumatic stress experts that coincidentally
came to San Francisco a few days after the earthquake held a
seminar on the disaster Friday, with experts saying everyone in the
area needed to talk about the experience and to use jokes to
relieve stress.
   ``The use of humor is good,'' said Dr. Tom Williams of Aurora,
Colo., of the Society for Traumatic Stress Studies. ``There's so
much irony.'' People in the area have swung through a gamut of
emotions including shock, excitement and euphoria at being alive,
he said.

<HEAD>Balancing of First Amendment, Privacy Rights Debated</HEAD>

   Journalists should do a better job of
balancing privacy and First Amendment rights, says a woman who
accused the media of badgering her family after her daughter was
murdered.
   However, reporters and editors who participated in the same free
speech seminar said most journalists are sensitive about how their
story might affect the private lives of people they write about.
   Reporters and editors in the past tended to ``go with it and
worry about the consequences tomorrow,'' said Bob McCord, senior
editor at the Arkansas Gazette. ``It doesn't seem to be like that
anymore.''
   About 60 journalists, media lawyers and others attended Friday's
seminar sponsored by the First Amendment Congress, an umbrella
organization for 16 national media and communications groups. The
organization tries to educate the public about First Amendment
issues.
   Patsy Day, who founded a victims' support group after her
14-year-old daughter was murdered in 1985, criticized the media for
publishing her address and camping outside her home with television
crews.
   She said she was badgered by a reporter who wanted to film her
daughter's bedroom and the media questioned whether she and her
husband had violated child labor laws by letting her daughter work
in the donut shop where she was abducted.
   ``One of the big gripes I have with the press is that they apply
the same standards to (crime) victims as to public officials who
are derelict in their duties,'' Mrs. Day said.
   The journalists said there were no clear guidelines for deciding
when privacy concerns outweighed the need to have a fact in the
story.
   ``For years and years, that collision of privacy needs and the
need to know has been occurring on every level and it comes down to
a judgment call,'' said Paul McMasters, deputy editorial director
of USA Today.
   McMasters said reporters have to be careful not to have a
nonchalant attitude about privacy rights.
   Steven McGonigle, a reporter for The Dallas Morning News, said
he seeks colleagues' opinions when he has qualms about invading
someone's privacy.
   ``It's foolish and arrogant of us to make decisions that affect
people's lives in a vacuum, and hopefully, most of us don't,''
McGonigle said.
   The group also discussed hurdles reporters face in trying to
gain access to government documents and potential changes to
Freedom of Information laws that are supposed to guarantee the
public's access to information.
   For instance, Arkansas' open meetings and records law was
recently changed to seal certain corporate tax documents and
another effort at a ``crippling amendment'' is under way, McCord
said.
   ``Powerful politicians are still out there and they're still our
enemy,'' he said.

   A fire in the largest department store
in southeastern Brazil sent thousands of panicked shoppers and
employees fleeing into rush-hour traffic and injured one fireman,
officials said.
   The fire Friday started on the 7th floor of the 13-story Mappin
Department Store, in the heart of Sao Paulo's business district,
when mattresses caught fire, said store security chief Luiz Matias
Silva.
   Silva said the fire spread to five floors before it was
extinguished two hours later by about 180 firemen. One fireman
suffered from smoke inhalation and was rushed to a nearby hospital,
he said.
   He said 4,000 employees were inside the building when the fire
broke out. Officials did not yet know why the mattresses caught
fire, he said.

   Deborah Norville, the successor to NBC's
``Today'' co-host Jane Pauley, says she's relieved the uproar over
the show appears to be ending, but she's also offended it started
in the first place.
   A skit on NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' last week compared the
situation at the show to ``All About Eve,'' the movie about a young
actress scheming to oust an aging theater star, played by Bette
Davis.
   ``It's sexism, pure and simple,'' said Norville, 31, who began
in TV news 11 years ago while attending the University of Georgia
and anchored at NBC-owned WMAQ-TV in Chicago before joining NBC
news in January 1987.
   ``As a woman and a reporter, I'm offended that the suggestion
would be made, that two capable, competent women can't work in a
collegial way on the same program. In 1989, that's nonsense.''
   Pauley, 39, told ``Today'' viewers Friday she will leave the
program at year's end, but her contract at NBC extends through
1992. Pauley has co-hosted the program for 13 years.
   She hugged Norville and gave her an alarm clock.

Annabeth Hartzog.
   The couple were wed Friday night at a church on fashionable St.

   A fleet of limousines, one of them containing TV series co-star
Roseanne Barr, queued up for the ceremony at St. Charles Avenue
Presbyterian Church.
   Goodman's publicist refused to discuss the wedding, but Ms.
Hartzog's family rented an entire floor of the Hotel

prepared for Friday night.
   Goodman, 37, and Miss Hartzog, 21, were introduced two years ago
when Goodman was in Louisiana filming the movie ``Everybody's

artistic director of the American Ballet Theatre, is beginning to
feel gravity's tug on his 41-year-old legs.
   ``I worry a lot about the future,'' Baryshnikov told Life for
the magazine's November issue. ``When will I dance my last ballet?
... Maybe I already did. I still can dance parts much better than a
lot of people, but I set a standard for myself. And once I stop
reaching that standard, I can't _ I won't _ allow myself to do it.''
   He remains fit. His orthopedic surgon, Dr. William Hamilton,

   But the dancer thinks a lot about his mortality.
   ``I catch myself watching old people now and then, and thinking,
`Well you know, Misha, this is how it is going to be.' It really

   Jamie Fiske, the 7-year-old girl whose liver
transplant helped spur a change in the nation's organ transplant
policy, will have a wish come true: She's going home for Halloween.
   The girl and her mother, Marilyn, are scheduled to go to their
home in East Bridgewater, Mass., this afternoon after Jamie showed
progress from spleen removal surgery at the University of Minnesota
Hospital, hospital spokeswoman Mary Stanik said Friday.
   Jamie was admitted to the hospital Oct. 5 after suffering three
bouts of internal bleeding within a month. Doctors removed Jamie's
spleen, which doctors said was seven or eight times the normal size
for a child her age.
   In 1982, Charles Fiske, Jamie's father, made an emotional and
successful appeal for a donor. Jamie's case raised questions about
the procedures for determining who should receive organ
transplants. One result was the National Transplant Act, which
created a national computer system that matches donors to
recipients.
   Charles Fiske said his daughter had been asking whether she
would be home in time for Halloween, her favorite holiday.
   Jamie plans to dress as the Queen of Hearts.

   The country music group Highway 101 is
denying reports of a breakup, saying concert dates for 1990 are
being set, including a tour of Europe in June.
   Published reports two weeks ago said the four were breaking up
because singer Paulette Carlson was planning a solo album.
   ``Her solo album is still in the talking stages and Paulette,
along with the rest of the group, is heavily committed to Highway
101 and their priorities for the coming year,'' Sarah McMullen, a
spokeswoman for the group, said Friday.
   The group's concert tour of Europe next summer will be their
first overseas. Other 1990 concert appearances are being arranged
with country stars Hank Williams Jr., Reba McEntire and the Judds,
McMullen said.
   Highway 101 has been voted group of the year for the past two
years by the Country Music Association. Their hit records include
``Cry, Cry, Cry'' and ``(Do You Love Me) Just Say Yes.''

<TEXT>
   Behind the fanfare surrounding the visit of former
President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, there is a clear
message: Tokyo values harmonious ties with the United States and
sees Reagan as the catalyst.
   The Reagans' hosts, the huge Fujisankei Communications Group and
the Japanese government, showered their guests with lavish praise
during their nine-day, $7 million visit, which ends Saturday.
Fujisankei reportedly paid Reagan $2 million.
   Reagan, in turn, glossed over serious trade disputes in his
speeches with expressions of affection for the Japanese people.
   However, in a speech scheduled to be delivered at the end of his
visit, Reagan said Americans did not think their products had fair
access to Japan and that trade barriers must be lowered to avoid
rising anger in the United States.
   ``As a friend, I tell you that Americans are not as patient as
the Japanese,'' Reagan said in his speech, according to the New
York Times.
   Officials here have welcomed the opportunity to emphasize
positive aspects of sometimes rocky U.S.-Japanese ties.
   ``President Reagan symbolizes U.S.-Japan friendship,'' said
Yukio Okamoto, director of the Foreign Ministry's North American
Division.
   As Emperor Akihito looked on, the government showed its
appreciation for Reagan's role in promoting good ties with Japan
and in fighting trade protectionism in office by awarding him one
of its highest honors, the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the
Chrysanthemum.
   The only other U.S. president to receive the award was Dwight
Eisenhower.
   Mrs. Reagan has been honored during the visit for her anti-drug
program and for her support for her husband.
   Reagan, 78, is the only former U.S. president to receive such
regal treatment, officials said, because unlike his predecessors
who either left office in disgrace or after losing elections,
Reagan served the two full terms and left office as a popular
leader.
   ``There is nothing controversial about inviting Reagan.
President Reagan still carries high prestige among the American
people,'' Okamoto said.
   The Reagans enjoy enormous prestige in Japan. Reagan's dignified
demeanor, coupled with the image of the two former movie stars
standing hand-in-hand, captures romantic imaginations in a country
that revels in the pomp of lavish wedding ceremonies and royalty.
   At concerts, banquets and other gatherings of Japan's rich and
powerful, the Reagans have received trumpet fanfares, standing
ovations and warm smiles. ``You'll never know, Ron, how much we
need you. Please come here with Nancy to stay,'' audience and
performers sang to the tune of ``You Are My Sunshine'' on Sunday at
a concert to benefit the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.
   A capacity crowd of 56,000 cheered as Reagan tossed the
ceremonial first pitch in a Japanese championship baseball game
Tuesday.
   Rather than criticizing Tokyo for trade barriers, which
Washington says contributed to Japan's $52 billion trade surplus
with the United States last year, Reagan spoke of a ``golden age
for Japan'' in his speeches.
   Trade issues, he said, were ``a few little itchy things here and
there that we still need working on from both sides.''
   Americans, as the world's largest foreign investors, should
welcome Japanese investments in the United States, Reagan said. He
said Sony Corp.'s takeover of Columbia Pictures could help ``bring
back decency and good taste to some of the pictures that are being
made.''
   A Newsweek survey following the takeover indicated that
Americans view Japan's economic power as a greater threat than
Soviet military might.
   While Reagan has occasionally reminded listeners here that
having retired, he no longer speaks for the U.S. government,
officials of the Japanese government have welcomed his words of
praise, his optimism and his playing down of economic disputes.
   ``We need a communicator of Reagan's prestige and ability,''
said Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe. ``We respect him
and we love him.''
   Reagan's conservative, pro-business ideology and his opposition
to protectionist trade policies have enormous appeal in Japan,
particularly with the couple's host, the Fujisankei Group, which is
known for the conservative, nationalist outlook of its chairman,
Nobutaka Shikanai, and of its media outlets.
   A Fujisankei official said Shikanai wanted to ``bring Reagan in
and give him a chance to talk to the Japanese people,'' in hopes
the visit would smooth over some problem areas.

   The Bush administration is trying to distance
itself from allegations made by a Salvadoran army defector that top
Salvadoran military leaders ordered death squad killings and U.S.
advisers ignored the activity.
   The White House said the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador is looking
into the charges made this week by Cesar Vielman Joya Martinez, 28,
who admits to taking part in eight death squad murders from April
to July.
   He claims to have seen reports from El Salvador's Joint Chiefs
of Staff ordering 72 executions during the same period.
   Joya Martinez also said two American advisers assigned to the
intelligence unit at the 1st Infantry Brigade in the capital of San
Salvador ``obviously had to know what was going on.''
   ``We're concerned about it,'' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Friday. ``Ambassador (William) Walker is looking
into it.''
   At the State Department, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
departed from normal procedure of not commenting on investigations
in progress. He strongly denied any U.S. complicity and said a
Salvadoran government probe into human rights abuses by its
military ``has not revealed any evidence substantiating (Joya
Martinez's) statements.''
   The Pentagon called the statements about U.S. military
involvement ``patently absurd.'' The CIA declined to comment,
saying: ``As a matter of policy we don't comment on intelligence
matters.''
   The U.S. armed forces have 55 military advisers assigned to El
Salvador. The CIA has an unknown number of agents in the Central
American nation.
   On Friday, Joya Martinez and his attorney, William Van Wyke,
walked from office to office on Capitol Hill, volunteering to
testify about the death squads.
   Among others, he spoke with staff members of Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif, an outspoken critic of death squad activity in El
Salvador. The staff members declined to comment pending a report to
the senator.
   The accusations could complicate upcoming congressional debate
on new aid to El Salvador, which so far this decade has received
more than $3 billion in U.S. economic and military assistance.
Lawmakers made earlier aid contingent on human rights improvements
by the Salvadoran military, which has been blamed by church groups
for murdering thousands of suspected leftists and leftist
sympathizers.
   The Salvadoran military denies Joya Martinez's claims and any
other involvement in the death squads.
   ``My work was to execute these people,'' Joya Martinez said,
adding that he was part of a seven-man group that operated out of
the Salvadoran army's 1st Infantry Brigade in the capital of San
Salvador.
   Joya Martinez, who is seeking asylum in the United States, said
he went public to stop the killing. The Salvadoran army says he is
wanted for two murders in July in El Salvador.
   In El Salvador, testimony obtained Friday said some of Joya
Martinez's comrades told a judge investigating the murders of two
civilians that the army deserter was the most zealous of torturers
who beat, drowned or suffocated prisoners.
   Marxist-led guerrillas have been fighting the U.S.-backed
government in El Salvador since 1979.

   A man walked into a government building
in Medellin Friday, whipped out a submachine gun and killed a
leftist leader of the Antioquia state assembly before being slain
by guards, police said.
   The victim, Gabriel Jaime Santamaria, was state leader of the
leftist Patriotic Union, whose ranks have been decimated the last
four years by death squads believed to be operated by drug
traffickers.
   The slaying came less than 24 hours after the Patriotic Union
refused to support a proposal by drug traffickers to negotiate an
end to the violence that has plagued Colombia since mid-August.
   The leftist party said it could never condone amnesty for
traffickers implicated in the murders of hundreds of its members,
including its president, Jaime Pardo Leal, in 1987.
   Earlier Friday, hundreds of policemen and soldiers with
automatic weapons had manned checkpoints in major cities after a
bomb killed five policemen and injured 16 others in the cocaine
center of Medellin.
   Also, a police officer died in a bomb explosion at a private
airport at a police air base six miles north of Bogota, the
national radio network Caracol reported.
   Unidentified terrorists fled after placing the dynamite bomb in
a bathroom of the Guaymaral airport terminal, Caracol said.
   Three other bombs exploded in Bogota late Thursday and early
Friday, injuring one person, and two bombs were deactivated in
Bogota and Barranquilla, the police said.
   Santamaria was sitting at his desk in the Apuajara government
building in the heart of Medellin when he was killed at 3:30 p.m.,
the Medellin police said in a telephone interview. Medellin, 150
miles north of this capital, is the hub of the most powerful
Colombian cocaine cartel.
   The government building includes the offices of the Antioquia
state governor, many of the state assembly members and the mayor of
Medellin, a city of 2 million residents.
   The gunman was killed in a hail of gunfire from guards who
belong to Colombia's secret police, a spokesman for the Medellin
police told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of not
being named.
   The assassin was about 20 years old, the police spokesman said.
   Three persons believed to be accompanying the gunman were
arrested, he said.
   Santamaria was the 737th member of the Patriotic Union to be
killed since the party was organized in 1975 as part of an attempt
by the federal government to reach a truce with leftist guerrillas.
   The traffickers are believed to have set up the death squads
after leftist guerrillas kidnapped the sister of three Medellin
cartel leaders and were paid $10 million for her return.
   A survey by a Colombian polling company showed that Colombians
heavily favor the government starting talks with drug traffickers
to end the violence. President Virgilio Barco has rejected such
talks.
   The bomb in Medellin exploded Thursday night as a police bus
carried patrolmen to their posts in Medellin.
   The driver and four other policemen were killed as chunks of
shrapnel tore through the bus, said the Medellin police chief, Col.
Humberto Camero.
   Afterward, the most rigid security measures seen since the
government declared war on drug traffickers Aug. 19 were put into
force in Colombia's five largest cities _ Bogota, Medellin, Cali,
Barranquilla and Cartagena.
   An AP reporter on his way to work Friday in Bogota was stopped
at three checkpoints by soldiers and police searching cars for
explosives and guns.
   Jeeps mounted with machine guns patrolled parts of the capital.
   Extra troops and policemen guarded police stations and army
bases.
   The bomb in Medellin, an estimated 65 pounds of dynamite, was
set off by remote control about 7:30 p.m. as the police bus passed
by, Camero said.
   With the driver fatally wounded, the bus careened out of control
and smashed into a taxi, the colonel said. No one in the car was
injured.
   No one claimed responsibility for the bombing, but suspicion
fell on drug traffickers.
   ``The traffickers are the only criminals with the means and the
desire to carry out an attack of this size,'' said a police
lieutenant in Medellin, speaking on condition he not be identified.
   Government security forces have assumed that the scores of bombs
that have exploded in Colombia in the last two months are part of
the drug traffickers' campaign to persuade the government to stop
extraditing trafficking suspects to the United States.
   The government has extradited four Colombians, and nine more are
awaiting extradition.
   In the last two months there have been 169 bombings, which have
killed 21 people and injured 219.
   In Bogota, a poll by the private National Consulting Center
indicated 61 percent of Colombians aged 18 to 60 want the
government to negotiate a truce with drug traffickers.

<HEAD>Treasury Skeptical About Deficit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration says in a pessimistic
assessment of trade prospects that the trade deficit may grow next
year.
   The current account deficit, the broadest measure of the U.S.
trade measuring investment flows as well as payments for goods and
services, narrowed sharply in 1988 to $126.6 billion, down from a
record $143.7 billion in 1987.
   But progress has stalled this year, with the gap running at only
a slightly better $122.8 billion annual rate from January through
June.
   The administration, in a report prepared by the Treasury
Department released Friday, warned that the current account deficit
may start widening again unless the Group of Seven industrial
nations _ the United States, Japan, West Germany, Great Britain,
France, Canada and Italy _ do a better job of coordinating economic
policies, including currency exchange rates.
   ``It would appear further improvement in the U.S. current
account position in 1990, if any is to occur at all, is likely at
best to be very modest,'' Treasury said in its semiannual ``Report
to the Congress on International Economic and Exchange Rate
Policy.''
   ``Furthermore, the possibility of deterioration in the current
account next year cannot be excluded.''
   A key element in the fight to reduce the U.S. trade deficit has
been Group of Seven efforts this year to check a rise in the value
of the dollar. A strong dollar can hurt the trade deficit by making
American goods more expensive overseas and foreign imports cheaper
on U.S. markets.
   The Treasury report acknowledged that skepticism among currency
traders is hindering the effort.
   The Group of Seven launched a new effort to contain the dollar
in mid-September, which included dollar selling and interest rate
increases in Japan and West Germany. However, the report noted that
it took the Oct. 13 stock sell-off in the United States to subdue
the dollar.
   The report was prepared under a provision of the Trade Act of
1988 that requires the administration to look for currency
manipulation by American competitors in world trade and to
negotiate to halt such practices.
   Under the law, the administration has singled out South Korea
and Taiwan. Friday's report expressed approval of Taiwan's effort
to boost its currency and lower its trade surplus, but sharply
criticized South Korea.
   The two countries have for many years used part of the money
earned through their trade surpluses to buy and sell currencies on
the open market to keep their own currencies weak in relation to
the dollar, making their products cheaper for Americans than they
would otherwise be.
   However, the Treasury report noted that the Taiwanese dollar has
appreciated 12 percent over the past year against the U.S. dollar.
It said Taiwan put in place a new exchange rate system in April and
took other significant steps to curb its trade surplus.
   ``We are encouraged by (these) significant steps,'' it said.
   Despite an appreciation of the South Korean currency won in
1988, the report rebuked South Korea for the 0.75 percent decline
in the value of that currency since April.

   Twice a week, Mike DeWitt greases
his 12-pound pig with hand lotion. It's the price of keeping a
Vietnamese potbellied pig named Ham from drying out.
   ``We have weird animals,'' admitted DeWitt's daughter, Kelli.
   Ham isn't exactly pretty. He shrieks. His back is swayed. His
belly scrapes the floor. His black-bristled snout looks smashed in.
But he is housebroken.
   DeWitt won't say how much he paid for Ham at an Ohio auction
last month. ``I just think all our friends would think we were
stupid if I told you,'' he said.
   Male Oriental pigs go for anywhere from $750 to $1,500 each,
said Betty Beeman, head of the Potbellied Pig Registry and
Organization in Lakeville, Ind.
   Ham doesn't sit up or fetch or play any of the other usual
domestic-pet games. But he does root. For family protection during
dinner, the DeWitts must lock Ham up in his pet carrier or he will
root at their ankles until they feed him.
   ``I guess that's why they call them pigs,'' Kelli DeWitt said.

   A group called Friends of Carhenge says it
has raised enough money to pave an approach road to the junk car
sculpture that spoofs England's prehistoric Stonehenge.
   Paul Phaneuf, a city councilman and Friends of Carhenge board
member said Friday the group had raised $2,400 for the road, one of
several improvements needed to bring the off-beat artwork up to cty
zoning standards. Work will begin early in November, Phaneuf said.
   Sculptor Jim Reinders of Texas built Carhenge two years ago

<TEXT>
   Calamity Jane was an ``uneducated,
uncultured woman,'' and some frontier heroes were shameless bigots,
according to an iconoclastic conference titled ``Speaking Ill of
the Dead: Jerks in Montana History.''
   Nearly every event in the life of the true Calamity Jane _
Martha Jane Canary _ is clouded by contradictory evidence, Dan
Gallacher told the annual Montana History Conference on Friday.
Even her birth date and parents' names are suspect.
   Much of the legend of Calamity Jane as a swashbuckling frontier
woman who rode with General Custer and captured Wild Bill Hickock's
killer was built by Canary herself, who fed lurid stories to
newspapers that didn't care if they were true, he said.
   Friday's panel on jerks in the state's history also featured the
``Golden Hatchet Award,'' which went to Lyndel Meikle, whose
research showed that many of Montana's founding fathers were racist
and sexist.
   The panel drew a crowd of nearly 200, and may become an annual
part of the conference.
   Conference organizer Jennifer Jeffries Thompson was pleased, but
also distressed that the scholarly work of the meeting would go
unnoticed.
   The same sort of thing happened in September, she said, when a
society program was upstaged by the Great Montana Centennial Cattle
Drive.
   ``This is the cattle drive of the history conference,'' Thompson
said.
   Gallacher, a historian with Historical Research Associates in
Missoula, said much of the legend of Calamity Jane can be flatly
disproved.
   Her claim to have been a Cavalry scout for George Armstrong
Custer in Arizona is easily debunked, he said, because Custer never
served in Arizona.
   And despite the many tales about her and Hickock _ including
that she was married to him _ the only verifiable fact is that both
were in Deadwood, S.D., when Hickock was shot to death in 1876.
   ``It was pure fantasy that she captured Hickock's killer, Jack
McCall,'' Gallacher said.
   Meikle, a ranger at the Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site
southwest of Helena, dug into official records that revealed the
prejudices of delegates to Montana's original constitutional
convention in 1889.
   C.J. Hartman, one of Montana's founding fathers, wanted a
requirement that anyone allowed to vote should be able to read
English. He saw that as a safeguard against ``the scum of foreign
nations'' who were being admitted to the United States, Meikle said.
   Delegate Charles S. Warren would have allowed only some
foreigners to vote, but not Italians.
   The official transcript, Meikle said, notes that delegates
laughed and applauded as Warren read an article that he said voiced
his feelings:
   ``It is somewhat uncomfortable to reflect that a citizen of
intelligence, property, good moral character and a keen sense of
responsibilities and dignities of his duties as an American citizen
may have his ballot offset by an Italian.''
   Warren's prejudice against Italians was not unusual, and similar
racism was aimed at the Chinese, Meikle said.
   Women faced different barriers, she said: ``They were not
considered people.''
   When a proposal to let women vote was introduced at the 1889
convention, a Mr. Collins of Cascade County requested that its
supporters first introduce a motion ``that a woman is a human being
or person in the language of the court.''
   ``To their credit,'' Meikle said, ``the delegates devoted a
tremendous portion of their time to the debate on woman's suffrage.
It is not to their credit, however, that they didn't grant it.''

<HEAD>Democrats Say Bush's Drive for Tax Cut Imperiling Credit Rating</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The long-running squabble on the proposed
capital gains tax cut that continues to stymie Senate action on
several bills has led Democrats to accuse the administration of
undermining the nation's credit rating abroad by doggedly pursuing
the issue.
   ``There apparently is no limit to what they'll do'' to get a
capital-gains cut, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,
D-Maine, told reporters Friday.
   White House Budget Director Richard G. Darman responded to the
criticism with a lecture about the need for statesmanship.
   ``We need people in Congress to get back to their better selves
in all of this,'' Darman said.
   The issue is blocking Senate action on bills to provide economic
assistance to Poland and Hungary and to raise the federal debt
limit so the government can continue to borrow money.
   It also is slowing work by Senate and House negotiators on a
compromise bill to reduce the budget deficit.
   The Treasury Department stepped in Friday with a plan to ensure
that Social Security checks will go out next week even if Congress
and the president are unable to agree on a higher debt limit. The
department announced it will borrow $17.6 billion on an emergency
basis Monday.
   Friday's announcement was considerably less dramatic than
Treasury's disclosure 24 hours earlier that it was taking the
unprecedented step of emergency borrowing. The earlier statement
had been read as indicating $17 billion in new borrowing would be
required Monday.
   In fact, Treasury will be raising its credit needs by only $2
billion Monday. The remaining $15.6 billion will be raised in the
usual Monday auctions of 3- and 6-month securities. The only
difference is that buyers will have to pay for those securities
Tuesday, rather than Thursday as usually would be the case.
   That money will be used to keep the government going after
Tuesday night, when federal credit authority drops from $2.87
trillion to $2.8 trillion. The extra $17.6 billion from securities
sales is expected to carry the government for another week, through
Nov. 7.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, described the emergency borrowing as an unprecedented
gamble.
   ``I don't see how such an action can fail to undermine
confidence in our financial operations,'' he said.
   He said there was no danger Congress would fail to raise the
debt ceiling or would do anything else to jeopardize government
checks for 38.9 million Social Security recipients.
   The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., asked Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady to
explain his actions in writing by Monday on the unusual borrowing
action.
   ``I view this as a serious matter,'' he said in a letter to
Brady.
   At Bush's urging, the House voted last month to tax capital
gains _ profits from the sale of stocks and other investments _ at
a lower rate than applies to wages and other income. The House
attached the cut to a bill designed chiefly to reduce the budget
deficit.
   Senate Republicans have developed, with Bush's backing, a new
plan for cutting capital-gains cuts. The chief sponsor, Sen. Bob
Packwood, R-Ore., says as many as 44 Republicans and 12 Democrats _
a majority of the Senate _ favor his bill, but he acknowledges he
does not have the 60 votes that would be required to end a
Democratic filibuster against it.

<HEAD>Earthquake Measuring 7.2 Hits Solomon Islands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROSE ANN ROBERTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major earthquake registering 7.2 on the
Richter scale shook the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific today,
the U.S. Geological Survey says.
   The preliminary reading of 7.2 is slightly stronger than the 7.1
magnitude earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay area Oct. 17.
   The earthquake struck the islands at 8:05 a.m. today, or 5:05
p.m. EDT Friday, said USGS spokesman Don Finley. It was the largest
earthquake in the Solomons since a 7.4 quake on Nov. 5, 1978.
   There were no immediate reports of injury or damage. Major
earthquakes in the Solomons usually don't cause much damage or many
casualties because the area is sparsely populated and not
extensively developed.
   The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu said no
Pacific-wide tsunami _ popularly called a tidal wave _ was
generated by the quake, but some areas might see small changes in
sea levels.
   Saturday's earthquake was the strongest in the world in five
months, Finley said. An 8.3 quake hit the Macquarie Islands south
of Australia on May 23.
   The survey's earthquake monitors in Golden, Colo., said early
seismograph readings placed the epicenter of Saturday's earthquake
about 200 miles southeast of Honiaria, which is on Guadacanal
Island and is the capital of the Solomons.
   That places the earthquake just east of San Cristobal, the
easternmost island in the Solomons chain and about 1,300 miles
northeast of Brisbane, Australia.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.

<TEXT>
   The White House says there were some
``technical difficulties'' getting a photo of President Bush
meeting with Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, but Ortega's aides
made one available _ for a price.
   The price was $150, but it didn't show Bush and Ortega shaking
hands.
   The White House said the two leaders shook hands briefly Friday
as they headed into the opening session of a two-day conference of
heads of government from North and South America, but declined to
release a photo of the event.
   ``If there were a picture, we would not release it,'' said White
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``It's not our story.''
   Besides, Fitzwater added with a grin, ``We had a lot of
technical difficulties.''
   Later, Fitzwater said White House photographer David Valdez had
inspected his film and determined that he didn't have a picture of
the handshake.
   The United States has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to
support the Nicaraguan Contras in their efforts to topple Ortega's
communist-backed government.
   Bush has made pointed efforts during the meeting here to embrace
Ortega's opponent in the Feb. 25 presidential elections, Violeta
Chamorro.
   ``Everybody knows we have a tense relationship so I don't want
to act like we're waltzing around there in great harmony (with
Ortega) because we're not,'' Bush said in advance of his trip.

<HEAD>Engineers Discovered Flaw on Other Double-Deckers Over Summer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Engineers last summer found a seismic
design flaw in three double-decker freeways in San Francisco and
planned to fix them, but overlooked the similar Interstate 880
viaduct, says a top state highway engineer.
   Interstate 880 in Oakland, the oldest of the double-decker
freeways in Northern California, was missed because ``nobody in the
Department'' of Transportation remembered until after last week's
earthquake that it, too, might have the flaw in its upper support
column hinges, Caltrans chief structural engineer Jim Roberts said
Friday.
   Two scientific teams from the University of California at
Berkeley and UC-San Diego have tentatively decided that the hinges,
or joints, sheared off during the quake allowed I-880's upper deck
to slam down, killing at least 39 motorists.
   Roberts was asked during a press briefing whether the repair
planned for San Francisco's double-deckers would have prevented the
I-880 collapse.
   ``The answer, I believe, is affirmative,'' he said. ``I think it
would have gone a long way.''
   But Roberts noted that even if I-880 had been on the list,
repairs would not have been done prior to Oct. 17.
   Hinge repairs on the three other double-deckers _ the
Embarcadero, China Basin, and Central freeways _ will be expedited,
officials said. The three highways were damaged in the quake and
are temporarily closed.
   Engineers discovered the hinge flaw in the Embarcadero freeway
during an August review by seismic experts on whether the structure
needed more earthquake-proofing of its horizontal decking, Roberts
said. He confirmed the contents of an Aug. 21 internal memorandum
brought to his attention Thursday.
   The memo, from one of his engineers to another, turned up in a
flood of departmental documents turned over to the news media this
week. Roberts earlier had denied its accuracy.
   The memo states that at Robert's request, the other two San
Francisco freeways would be added to the list because state
engineers recalled that they too contained the flaw.
   Asked how engineers could have forgotten the oldest of these
structures _ I-880, Roberts said, ``Maybe it was the lack of
foresight.''
   ``That's hindsight,'' he said later.
   Many of the state's 700 multicolumn structures need column
bolstering, but engineers are waiting to do so until technology in
the works at UC-Berkeley has been developed, Roberts said.
   Engineers plan to temporarily strengthen the three San Francisco
structures, however, by attaching to the flawed columns ``strong
backs,'' or ``splints,'' much as a physician stabilizes a leg,
Roberts said.
   He was asked why that could not be done with all 700 elevated
structures.
   The splints ``are not very good looking, and you're not going to
leave them up permanently,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Arab-American organization is planning
weekend demonstrations to protest a decision by a novelty company
to continue selling two Halloween masks the group finds offensive.
   The American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee said members
would demonstrate at Spencer Gifts Inc. outlets because the company
decided to put its ``Sheik'' and ``Arafat'' masks back on the
market.
   The Pleasantville, N.J.-based company had earlier this month
withdrawn the masks for sale at its 435 outlets after a three-day
protest and telephone campaign by the committee.
   On Friday, Spencer general counsel Ronald Mangel said in a
letter to AAADC spokesman Faris Bouhafa that the company decided to
put the masks back on sale but would not reorder them for next year.
   ``The essence of Halloween is exaggeration,'' Mangel said
earlier. ``It's not an ethnic mask, it's a character mask.''
   In its Halloween catalog, Spencer urged customers to ``put on
our Arafat mask and terrorize your friends.''
   The Arab group characterized the ad as ``an exhortation that
reinforces the negative and increasingly discredited stereotypical
image of Palestinians as terrorists.''

clinics.
   The organization alleges in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District
Court on Friday that members of Operation Rescue plan to illegally
harass and intimidate patients and employees at abortion clinic
demonstrations scheduled to begin Nov. 10 in the Washington, D.C.,

   Some House Democrats are asking their
colleagues to stand firm in negotiations with the Senate on a
significant cut in the Strategic Defense Initiative as Congress
moves toward completion of a $305 billion defense bill.
   In a two-page letter to Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee, 16 Democratic members of the House
said the spending level for Star Wars should be $3.28 billion, not
the $3.55 billion congressional negotiators are considering.
   The House in August approved $2.84 billion for the Pentagon's
share of the program in its authorization bill; the Senate adopted
a total of $4.3 billion in its authorization legislation.
   House and Senate conferees on the defense bill for the fiscal
year that began Oct. 1 are considering a compromise of $3.55
billion for the program.
   Signing the letter released Friday were Reps. Charles Bennett of
Florida; Patricia Schroeder of Colorado; Ronald Dellums, Vic Fazio
and Howard Berman of California; Lane Evans of Illinois; George
Hochbrueckner of New York; Joseph Brennan of Maine; Jim Olin of

   Leaders of the country's oldest and largest
Hispanic organization voted Friday to ``clean house'' after
learning that $88,000 had been funneled through an undisclosed
account, officials say.
   The national executive board of directors of the League of
United Latin American Citizens voted after a daylong closed meeting
Friday to create a new foundation and strip the old foundation of
its tax-exempt status, said Ruben Sandoval, special counsel to
LULAC President Jose Garcia De Lara.
   But the fight over the old foundation, managed by former
presidents of LULAC to receive corporate donations for the group's
charitable works, appears to have caused an angry rift among some
members of the San Antonio, Texas-based organization of 140,000.
   ``It's bitterly divided, very bitterly,'' said Nelda Ojeda
Savoy, president of a Washington, D.C., LULAC council. ``Texas has
always tried to manipulate and control LULAC.''
   De Lara initiated efforts to replace the foundation with a new
entity after discovering in March a previously undisclosed account
through which $88,000, most of it corporate donations, had been
funneled, said Sandoval.

   In just a few seconds on Oct. 17, untold
numbers of windows were shattered, trapping pedestrians in glass
storms and sending shards spitting through homes and businesses. I.
Magnin's department store alone lost 73 plate glass windows to the
earthquake.
   Some of the windows have been replaced, some boarded up and some
ignored. The amount of glass needed to help in the recovery exceeds
supplies on hand in most cases and that has strained the glass
pipeline.
   ``We are small but we lost all our stock,'' said H. Behrouz,
office manager for City Glass Express and Kaiser Glass, both of
which closed for four days to clean up the mess left by the quake.
   ``We had over $15,000 worth of stock on hand. ... When it shook,
all our glass and mirrors fell from the racks,'' he said. ``We
still haven't got the (replacement) glass we need.''
   ``The system is definitely strained,'' said Bob Hansen, manager
for National Glass.
   But four of the nation's big glass manufacturers are on the West
Coast, and replacements are on the way. No one has statistics on
just how many windows shattered.
   Libbey-Owens-Ford in Lathrop began increasing shipments the day
after the quake, although the company was also damaged, said Randy
Zatrock, manager of customer service. ``We almost doubled what we
would have shipped for the week.''
   Zatrock said the company lost about 250,000 square feet of
glass, the equivalent of 10,000 five-foot-square windows.
   The 7.1-magnitude quake, blamed for more than 60 deaths, more
than 3,000 injuries and damage that could exceed $7.1 billion, was
felt strongly at Lathrop, 90 miles south of the epicenter near
Santa Cruz.
   ``There was dust everywhere,'' Zatrock said.
   While distributors struggled to deliver glass through a network
of closed or damaged freeways, installers set up a system to handle
the the most dangerous breaks first and let cracks wait.
   In June 1906, after the great quake ravaged San Francisco,
Habenicht and Howlett opened for business to fill the demand for
glass that followed. The company is having little trouble getting
glass this time, although some sizes are in short supply, said
manager Don Post.
   ``There was definitely a lot of breakage. It seems like the
older buildings had most of the damage. The newer buildings have
thicker glass and different types of safety glass,'' Post said.
   In 1906, he said, ``none of the glass manufacturers were on the
West Coast and the availability of glass was not what it is today.
There was a lot more destruction in 1906.''

   Hours later, a bomb exploded at a police air base near Bogota,
killing a police officer.
   Gabriel Jaime Santamaria, vice president of the Antioquia state
assembly, was talking on the telephone in his office Friday when an
unidentified man walked in and shot him, killing him instantly,
police said.
   The office is on the second floor of Medellin's main government
building, which also houses the offices of the Antioquia state
governor and the city's mayor. The downtown building is patrolled
by scores of police officers, army troops and private security
guards.
   Medellin, a city of two million in northwest Colombia, is the
capital of Antioquia State and is considered the center of the
country's drug trade.
   Guards shot and killed the assassin in an exchange of gunfire
that left two officers wounded, a police spokesman said from the
region.
   Police arrested three men suspected of assisting in the attack,
he said on condition of anonymity.
   Santamaria also was state leader of the leftist Patriotic Union,
the ranks of which have been decimated in the last four years by
death squads believed operated by drug traffickers.
   ``It was carried out by the same narcofascists that have
murdered hundreds of our leaders,'' Patriotic Union president Diego
Montana said. ``The most suprising thing was that an assassin
carrying a submachine gun could walk into the most heavily guarded
government building in Medellin.''
   Hours after the slaying, a bomb exploded at a police air base
and private airport six miles north of Bogota, killing a police
officer, according to the national radio network Caracol.
   Unidentified terrorists fled after placing the dynamite bomb in
a bathroom of the Guaymaral airport terminal, Caracol said. It also
caused extensive damage to the building.
   Police are using the small, private airport to store many light
aircraft seized from suspected drug traffickers in a government
crackdown on narcotics that began in August.
   A Bogota police spokesman could not confirm the bombing because
communication with the airport was cut, he said.
   Earlier Friday, the government announced it would increase to
$600,000 the reward offered for information leading to the arrest
of Pablo Escobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, two leaders of the
Medellin cartel.
   In August the administration of President Virgilio Barco offered
$250,000 for information leading to the suspects' capture.
   U.S. officials say the Medellin cartel and a rival organization
in southern Cali are responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine sold
in the United States.
   The government declared a crackdown on drug traffickers on Aug.
19, a day after leading presidential candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos
Galan, was assassinated by drug barons. The government reinstated
an extradition treaty with the United States and began confiscating
property belonging to the drug lords.
   Traffickers responded with bombings and assassinations in an
effort to persuade the government led by President Virgilio Barco
to end its extradition of drug suspects.
   The administration has extradited four alleged traffickers to
the United States, where they will face trial. In Colombia, drug
lords have received relative impunity by paying off or intimidating
the nation's judges.
   On Thursday, five patrolmen died and 16 were injured when a bomb
attributed to traffickers exploded beside a bus carrying them to
their night posts in Medellin.
   Security was stepped up nationwide as a result of the bombing.
In Bogota on Friday, military checkpoints were increased and jeeps
mounted with machine guns patrolled the streets.

   The third game of the World Series played
to a captive audience in Red Cross shelters, where televisions were
set up for baseball fans left homeless by the earthquake.
   ``This is definitely not the place I'd like to watch the game,''
said William Johnson, 53, as he sat on a cot in the crowded
gymnasium of Oakland's Lowell Middle School.
   ``But due to the circumstances, it's not so bad,'' the A's fan
said. ``If it wasn't for this place, I wouldn't be watching at
all.''
   Sounds of an ebullient Candlestick Park crowd blasted out from
the TV, echoing to every corner of the cavernous gym, where 120
cots were lined up side by side.
   Some officials questioned the wisdom of resuming the World
Series while some people remain homeless in the San Francisco Bay
area. But in the shelters, baseball fans were happy to watch the
Oakland Athletics beat the San Francisco Giants 13-7, calling it a
welcome break from what they called depressing footage of
destruction.
   ``We love it; It takes your mind off the earthquake, and that's
good for the nerves,'' said Winston Presley, 54, as he sat with a
cluster of A's fans.
   When the earthquake hit last week, Presley was just about to
turn on the televised game in his room on the third floor of
Oakland's low-rent Woodrow Hotel.
   He'd have preferred to be there watching Friday's game. But his
quake-damaged building was condemned, Presley was forced into the
shelter, and his TV was stolen before he was allowed back to his
room to pick up his belongings.
   Not everyone in the shelter was glued to the television during
Friday's game. Many people milled around their cots; others escaped
the shelter's smelly, noisy confines to enjoy the crisp, clear
evening outside.
   Raymond Smith, 48, lay disconsolate on his cot, far from the
blaring set.
   ``I can't watch the game because of my heart,'' he said. Smith
complained that officials were giving him the run-around in finding
a more permanent place to stay and in supplying him with the
prescription drug he needs for his heart condition.
   The World Series held no magic for him: ``All I want is a place
to stay.''

<HEAD>Protesters Picket Over Offbeat Meats _ `Lion's Tongue is No Fun'</HEAD>

   The meat was offbeat, the diners chic, but
picketers outside the New Deal Restaurant were in a pique.
   It was the place to be Friday night. Where else in town could
you find sweet and sour ostrich, kangaroo yakitori and beaver
empanada on the menu, with animal rights activists chanting,
``Lion's tongue is no fun'' in the street?
   The restaurant's Eighth Annual Wildlife Game Festival attracted
customers who wanted to savor a rare taste treat. It also drew the
attention of an animal rights group that protested in front of the
restaurant, shouting slogans such as, ``Wild game is not a treat.''
   ``This is symbolic of the really decadent, disrespectful
attitude that, unfortunately, our society exhibits,'' said Steve
Siegel of Trans-Species Unlimited. ``Some of them are endangered
animals. They're making a game out of it, making a fun experience
out of the suffering of these animals.''
   The kangaroo meat served by New Deal is marinated in soy sauce
and grilled with scallions. The ``Drunken Diamondback Rattlesnake''
is pan-roasted with cilantro (coriander) and bell peppers and then
baked in tequila and lime.
   Barbara and Bill Hinton, regulars at the eatery in Manhattan's
SoHo area, were seated at the bar Friday night.
   ``We had zebra once, which was quite delicious,'' said Hinton.
``They have some things here that you can't get in other places in
the city and it's very tasty and very well prepared.''
   As the protestors continued their chanting , chef Jeffrey Nathan
and restaurant partner Harvey Riezenman lamented that the
demonstrators were misinformed.
   ``They think we're doing something illegal,'' said Riezenman.
``Everything is sanctioned by the government. No one drives up here
in a truck with three deer on the back of the truck and dumps it
out on the street.''
   Added Nathan: ``We too, are concerned with the protection of our
wildlife. We do not feature endangered species. ... Our exotic
meats come from preserves whose sole purpose is to raise these
animals for consumption.''
   But protester Sari Bailer was unimpressed.
   ``Those animals don't belong on a plate. They belong on the open
fields or the jungle,'' she said, as she took up a new chant,
``Beaver, moose and ostrich, too. New Deal Restaurant shame on
you.''
   Game will be on the menu until January and chef Nathan intends
to hold the festival again next year _ especially with the
popularity of high-protein, low-cholesterol food.
   ``It's a healthier product than the meat you get in most
restaurants,'' he said. ``In here, you're not eating animals that
are all pumped up with hormones or antibiotics.''
   But how can anyone eat kangaroo? a visitor asked.
   ``It's like filet mignon,'' Nathan said.
   But every taste bud has its limits.
   ``I particularly have a morbid fear of snakes and I've never
eaten it and I probably never will,'' Bill Hinton said.

<BYLINE>Doctor Sounds Alarm Over Homeless Pregnant Women ^By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Audrey Ellis is a 20-year-old mother with another
child due in February. She is also one of six pregnant homeless
women to enter Beth Israel Hospital in just 10 days.
   The distress of such women represents a surge so alarming it
prompted Dr. Benjamin Sachs, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at
Beth Israel, to call Friday for more attention to the needs of
homeless pregnant women.
   ``Now this may be a statistical quirk. But I'm just outraged.
What kind of a society is this?'' he said.
   ``I've never seen this number before. I hear about a case once
in a blue moon, perhaps once or twice a year,'' said Sachs, who has
worked in Boston hospitals for 11 years. ``In some ways it must be
coincidence. But it's highlighted by the times, when I read the
headlines, I have to make an outcry.''
   Sachs said that among the six pregnant homeless women, two have
already given birth. One of those two women left her child behind
at the hospital to be put in foster care.
   And there is Ms. Ellis, a diabetic who has a 3-year-old daughter
and has been homeless since July. The stress made her so ill she
checked into Beth Israel.
   ``It's a lot of pressure,'' Ms. Ellis said in an interview from
the hospital, where the staff is helping her obtain a state housing
subsidy _ a difficult feat at a time of budget cuts.
   ``I see mothers every day, put out every day from the shelters
and I see them prostituting to feed their children,'' she said.
   ``It's very scary because you don't know what's going to happen
the next day,'' she said. ``It's also, in a way, very painful. My
3-year-old wakes up crying wondering where she is.''
   The size of the problem is difficult to gauge. Many homeless
pregnant women might not disclose their predicament, for fear of
having their children placed in foster care, Sachs said.
   But in a report soon to be released by the National Coalition
for the Homeless, a survey of 26 communities, from New York City to
Fargo, N.D., to St. Louis and Los Angeles, found that more than 35
percent of the homeless were families with children, said Joan
Alker, a legislative analyst in Washington for the coalition.
   While no statistics were collected specifically on homeless
women giving birth, Alker said, ``The fastest growing segment of
the homeless population is families with children.

   Six former secretaries of state agreed
that rapid political changes in the Eastern Bloc pose tough foreign
policy questions for the West, but they couldn't say whether the
Cold War is dead.
   ``We shouldn't be incessantly euphoric about all the welcome
changes,'' Alexander Haig told the panel discussion. Haig, Henry
Kissinger and Dean Rusk said they did not believe the Cold War was
over, despite warmer ties between the United States and the Soviet
Union and displays of nationalism and changes in leadership in
Eastern Europe.
   Edmund Muskie said the Cold War was ``maybe'' over. William
Rogers said, ``I'm closer to a yes,'' while Cyrus Vance said,
``It's ending.''
   Vance, who served under former President Carter, said such
developments as the non-communist leadership in Poland and the
exodus from East Germany indicate a demise of the Cold War
mentality.
   ``In the Cold War, these could never have happened,'' Vance said.
   The former officials met Friday at Bates College for the seventh
annual Report of the Secretaries of State, presented by the
Atlanta-based Southern Center for International Studies.
   ``I would say it's ending, but we're not out of the Cold War,''
Vance said.
   The secretaries agreed that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's
reform efforts are welcome, but they were not sure what U.S.
leaders can or should do to assist.
   ``Nobody knows what perestroika is, including Gorbachev, so
nobody knows what we're supposed to be supporting,'' said
Kissinger, who served under former presidents Nixon and Ford.
   Trying to help Gorbachev could backfire by causing him political
problems at home, some of the speakers said.
   ``The best we can do is assist Mr. Gorbachev at the margins,''
Haig said.
   Muskie, the former Maine senator who also served as secretary of
state under Carter, suggested that the Soviets need to help
integrate themselves with the economies of the West by making the
ruble exchangeable with other currencies.
   Asked whether the Bush administration is responding quickly
enough to the changes in Eastern Europe, Vance said he would like
to see Bush speed up his reactions, while Haig encouraged a
cautious approach.
   In Hartford, Conn., Paul H. Nitze, a retired diplomat,
ambassador and arms control negotiator, Friday expressed a lack of
trust in Gorbachev, saying the Soviet leader is ``very good at
keeping people deceived as to what he's going to do next.''
   Nitze said Gorbachev has essentially become a ``one-man
dictator.''
   ``Nobody can stand up to him today,'' said Nitze, ``and I don't
approve of one-man dictatorships even if they might look as though
they're heading in a benevolent direction toward their own people.
You never can tell about dictators.
   ``We want to be sure that the things that he's suggesting do, in
fact, take place ... before we let down our guard,'' Nitze said
before a speech to the World Affairs Center, a group of businessmen
and civic leaders interested in foreign policy.
   The 82-year-old Nitze, who served as former President Reagan's
adviser on arms control, retired from the State Department on April
30 and now is diplomat in residence at the Paul H. Nitze School of
Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in
Washington.

<DATELINE>CAMP HILL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As firefighters doused smoldering
buildings, a caravan of buses ferried 960 inmates from the scorched
Camp Hill prison to other crowded facilities in the state today
after two nights of rioting.
   The siege left more than 100 people injured, numerous buildings
razed or damaged by fire and hundreds of inmates without cells.
Five hostages were released Friday morning after state police
stormed the prison and retook it building by building.
   ``It looks like a riot-torn city in there,'' said firefighter
George Smith.
   With large areas of the prison gutted or damaged, officials had
little choice but to begin shuttling busloads of inmates to other
state prisons _ all of which are already full beyond capacity.
   Prison officials said overcrowding at Camp Hill may have been a
cause for the riots.
   There were no deaths and no escapes during the uprising at the
prison in south-central Pennsylvania, about 100 miles west of
Philadelphia, officials said.
   The violence was sparked Wednesday by an inmate's assault on a
prison worker. That led to a seven-hour rampage during which eight
hostages were taken and 47 injured.
   Officials regained control of the prison and the hostages were
released, but by 7 p.m. Thursday the inmates managed to free
themselves from lockdown and began the second night of rioting.
   Ken Robinson, spokesman for the state Department of Corrections,
said officials are unsure how the inmates freed themselves. There
has been speculation inmates still had keys gained in the first
night of rioting or took advantage of locks damaged the first night.
   The siege's end came Friday morning, when state police, firing
guns, stormed a kitchen building, wounding at least one inmate as
they began taking control of the prison.
   Robinson announced about 9:30 a.m. that officials were ``again
in control of the institution,'' nearly 15 hours after the second
wave of rioting began.
   Fourteen of 31 buildings on the grounds were burned out,
including eight modular housing units, the education building,
greenhouse, laundry building and furniture factory, Robinson said.
   During their storming of the prison, state police in riot gear
and armed with shotguns pushed surrendering or captured prisoners
to the ground, holding them face-down in the grass of a prison
courtyard.
   Troopers who spoke on the condition of anonymity detailed
hand-to-hand scuffles and counterattacks by inmates.
   ``They were throwing Molotov cocktails at us and pieces of
blocks,'' said one trooper.
   Robinson said 76 people were injured Thursday, and 46 were taken
to hospitals. They included 34 prison employees, 32 inmates and 10
state police or firefighters.
   All five hostages taken Thursday night were injured. One was in
serious condition with a stab wound, three were in stable condition
with head injuries or, in one case, broken ribs, and one was in
good condition with a head injury, he said.
   An 18-year-old inmate was in critical condition, a 24-year-old
inmate was in serious condition and a third inmate of undetermined
age was in fair condition, all with gunshot wounds, area hospital
officials said.
   A 41-year-old guard was listed in serious condition at the
medical center after undergoing surgery for multiple stab wounds to
the back, Hershey Medical Center spokeswoman Marybeth Bruchwalski
said.
   Friday afternoon, the Corrections Department said 960 inmates
from Camp Hill would be moved to the Graterford, Mercer,
Pittsburgh, Smithfield and Waymart state prisons.
   Overcrowding and a shortage of guards may have contributed to
the disturbance, officials said. Camp Hill, with 2,600 inmates, was
about 45 percent over capacity and the entire state prison system
is about 48 percent over capacity.
   Robinson said both a prison administrative and a criminal
investigation have begun to determine what happened during the
outburst. The state's Senate Judiciary Committee plans a hearing
next week.
   State Department of Corrections Superintendent Robert M. Freeman
had said the first night's problems may have been linked to a
decision to prohibit families from bringing food to inmates during
extended visits. He also said inmates were upset by a change in the
way they received medical care.

   Candlestick Park shook again but it was the
roar of fans cheering the World Series _ not another earthquake _
and the only cracks came from bats as the Bay area took a break
from its woes to watch baseball.
   ``The city's back, just like the World Series,'' San Francisco
Mayor Art Agnos declared to the television audience before the
Oakland Athletics pounded his Giants 13-7 Friday night to take a
3-0 lead in the series.
   It was the loss of the TV signal shortly before Game 3 was to
begin 10 days earlier that gave the nation its first hint of the
powerful temblor that rocked northern California, killing scores
and causing widespread damage.
   ``We're well on the way to recovery although it's early yet
because there have been so many aftershocks,'' said Oakland Mayor
Lionel Wilson.
   The 62,000 fans stood silently to remember victims of the
7.1-magnitude quake that hit at 5:04 p.m. Oct. 17, then jubilantly
sang ``San Francisco'' before a dozen rescue workers were given the
honor of throwing out first balls.
   Not everyone thought the Bay Bridge World Series should resume
in the face of the enormity of the tragedy: 64 deaths, six people
unaccounted for, nearly 14,000 people homeless and an estimated
$7.1 billion in damage.
   But major-league baseball thought it was time to play ball, and
many fans agreed.
   ``We all feel bad for the people who got hurt, but this game
means it's OK to be yourself again,'' said Ray Torres, who with a
friend had seats near the top of the stadium and brought a banner
that read, ``Upper deck parachute rental.'' Many fans wore hard
hats to the game.
   ``I think enough time has passed so that we can put it behind
us,'' said lawyer Mike Franchetti at a tailgate party in the same
spot where he had been on Oct. 17. ``It's an escape from the
sadness and uncertainty.''
   Commissioner Fay Vincent, who announced a $1.4 million gift from
baseball to earthquake relief, said he received mail from around
the country urging that the Series be called off because of the
earthquake.
   Vincent said he understood those feelings. ``But I don't think
there is any disrespect in going on with the World Series,'' he
said.
   ``Baseball can be part of this area's mental therapy,'' said
Giants manager Roger Craig.
   The death toll rose to 64 on Friday with the addition of an
88-year-old San Mateo woman who died of a heart attack shortly
after the quake.
   Demolition continued at Interstate 880 in Oakland where 39
people were known to have been killed in the collapse of the
double-deck freeway. The search for more more bodies was delayed
because the road was too shaky.
   In other quake developments:
   _ Dockworker Buck Helm, 57, rescued after four days trapped in
the rubble of I-880, remained in serious condition in Oakland's
Highland General Hospital. Helm was making ``slow progress'' in
kidney and respiratory functions, nursing supervisor Grace Reece
said late Friday.
   _ Julio Berumen, 6, whose leg was amputated during a rescue from
I-880, was in good condition at Children's Hospital in Oakland. A
nursing supervisor said late Friday that he was to be moved from
intensive care to a regular ward. His sister Cathy, 8, was in
serious but stable condition. They lost their mother in the
collapse. About $48,000 has been donated to a fund for them.
   _ In Santa Cruz on Friday, a wrecking ball went to work on the
landmark Cooper House, centerpiece of the heavily damaged Pacific
Garden Mall. Some people watched with tears in their eyes.
   _ Lawyer Melvin Belli on Friday filed $22 million in claims
against the state on behalf of 10 victims of the I-880 collapse. If
the claims _ $3 million for each of two wrongful deaths and $2
million for each of eight injured survivors _ are rejected by the
state, lawsuits would be filed, Belli said.
   _ Seven students from Chuo University in Tokyo arrived in
Watsonville on Friday to help distribute relief supplies in the
hard-hit agricultural region. An additional 25 students will arrive
Wednesday.
   _ The state Public Utilities Commission warned tour operators
that earthquake disaster areas should not be considered tourist
attractions, and threatened punitive action against any operator
who toured there.
   _ A convention of traumatic stress experts who coincidentally
came to San Francisco after the earthquake held a seminar on the
disaster Friday. Experts said people should talk about the
experience and use jokes to relieve stress.

<TEXT>
   Iran has quietly stopped flooding part of
its cease-fire line with Iraq, ending a yearlong dispute between
Tehran and the United Nations over the truce violation.
   The flooding had sparked the deadliest shelling across the line
since the 1988 cease-fire that effectively ended the 8-year Persian
Gulf War. Under the truce, the two armies are not allowed to
strengthen their positions.
   The news came Friday as new mediation efforts began to break a
deadlock in peace talks between Iran and Iraq.
   The Security Council called on Iran and Iraq to ``work
constructively and in a spirit of good will'' with U.N. envoy Jan
Eliasson who Monday begins a three-week shuttle diplomacy mission
between Tehran and Baghdad.
   Diplomats said water levels along the 40-mile-long area
northeast of Basra dropped dramatically over the last two to three
weeks, and parts of the marsh are now dry.
   They said they were not sure why Tehran had stopped the
flooding, which began three weeks after the cease-fire to drive
Iraqi troops from positions they occupy in Iranian territory. Iran
has not commented on the move.
   In September 1988 Iran opened a large canal, turning the marshy
region into swampland beneath 4{ feet of water, making it
impassable for Iraqi tanks or armored vehicles, according to U.N.
military observers.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar called the flooding a
serious violation of the cease-fire agreement and tension over the
raised water levels provoked shelling in December 1988 that killed
two Iranians.
   Perez de Cuellar said U.N. envoy Eliasson ``is not taking
specific proposals, but will be listening to all parties concerned
who will be available to him.''
   The war between Iran and Iraq tentatively ended with a truce
effective Aug. 20, 1988. But peace talks in Geneva quickly bogged
down.
   An uneasy truce prevails along the 350-mile war front, and the
warring armies are separated by a U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer
Group.
   Baghdad says that since hostilities have ceased, all prisoners
of war should immediately be exchanged, according to the terms of
the Geneva Conventions of 1949 governing the treatment of POWS.
About 100,000 prisoners still languish in POW camps.
   But Tehran insists the next step in the peace process must be
the withdrawal of troops to the border. Iraq still occupies about
385 square miles of Iranian territory.

   Former colleagues of a
Salvadoran army deserter who told Washington officials about
death-squad assassinations testified the man was a zealous torturer
who initiated the killings.
   The testimony, obtained Friday, was given in recent weeks to
Judge Miguel Flores Figueroa of Quetzaltepeque, 12 miles north of
San Salvador.
   Cesar Vielman Joya Martinez, who deserted from the San
Salvador-based 1st Army Brigade in July, met in Washington Friday
with members of Congress.
   He has said he was part of a rightist death squad responsible
for killing 72 suspected leftists. The government and armed forces
deny the existence of military death squads.
   Joya fled El Salvador after being charged with the deaths of
suspected left-wing guerrillas Lucio Parada and Hector Miranda, who
were killed after being captured by Joya's army brigade.
   In the testimony Col. Francisco Elena Fuentes, 1st Brigade
commander, called Joya ``a deserter, a murderer and a liar.''
   Joya, 28, told reporters on Thursday, ``My work was only to
execute these people. My job was to kill or be killed ... I realize
I was manipulated.'' He said some of the people he killed ``were
almost dead from being beaten during interrogation.''
   But Joya's former army colleagues told the judge that Joya, an
army intelligence officer, was the most zealous of torturers who
beat, drowned or suffocated prisoners.
   Parada and Miranda were among eight guerrilla suspects captured
during an operation around the village of Tres Ceibas.
   Soldiers who took part in the operation testified that all eight
were beaten and several were almost drowned by Joya over two days
of interrogation, even though the battalion commander had said they
were not to be tortured.
   Lt. Herbert Soriano, commander of the Atlacatl Battalion company
operating north of the capital, reportedly warned Joya, who
replied, ``If I don't, they won't tell us anything.''
   Gomez and another soldier, Eugenio Mendez, said Soriano told
Joya after the deaths, ``You're in big trouble.''
   Soriano said a squad from his company accompanied Joya in making
the arrests at Tres Ceibas but their ``only mission was to give
security to the two 1st Brigade soldiers so they could perform
their intelligence-gathering duty.''
   An estimated 70,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed
in the 10-year-old war between leftist rebels and U.S.-backed
governments.
   Human rights groups have said rightist death squads _ allegedly
sponsored or tolerated by the military _ killed more than 20,000
suspected leftists in the early 1980s. The number of slayings
attributed to the squads declined between 1984 and 1987 but
increased again last year.

<HEAD>Battered Woman Who Hired Hit Man is Released from Prison</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman whose imprisonment for hiring a
gunman to kill her husband led to changes in state laws protecting
battered women was free today on a grant of clemency.
   Delia Alaniz blinked back tears as she walked through prison
gates Friday afternoon, saying her prayers for mercy and
understanding had been answered.
   ``The governor put trust in me and I'm not going to let him
down,'' she told reporters outside the Purdy Corrections Center for
Women.
   Alaniz had served about 22 months of a 10 year, three-month
sentence for hiring a hit man to kill her husband Roy.
   Gov. Booth Gardner, granting the first clemency order of his
five years in office, said Alaniz and her four children had
suffered enough and society wouldn't be threatened by her early
release.
   Skagit County Public Defender Robert Jones, who defended Alaniz,
called the clemency order ``an extraordinary act, done for an
extraordinary case... There is room in our law and room in our
hearts for forgiveness and understanding.''
   Gardner said he did not condone Alaniz's action but felt the
order would increase public awareness of the tragedy of spouse
abuse.
   ``My first thought was I'd be united with my children,'' Alaniz
told reporters outside the prison, 20 miles southwest of Seattle.
``We've been through a lot in the past. Due to our separation,
we've suffered a lot. When I got word I would be free I thought I
finally will be home with my kids... I had faith it was going to
happen.''
   Alaniz was met at the gates by her 16-year-old daughter Dominga.
The two left the prison together to join two of her other children
at Hickman House, a Seattle transition house for battered women.
   Her fourth child will join the family at a later date, said
Edith Maffeo, a spokeswoman at Hickman House.
   ``No one condones or approves the action taken to end years of
abuse,'' Jones said. ``This is not a pardon. This is not sending
the message you can take the law into in your own hands.''
   Alaniz's lawyers said Roy Alaniz beat and threatened his wife
and the children, caused a miscarriage, chopped off her hair, raped
her, put a gun to her head, threatened to drown her, and sexually,
physically and psychologically abused the children.
   Alaniz said her attempts to flee, to get police protection, or
to get any extensive help from shelters for battered women were
fruitless and she felt she had no alternative but to have her
husband killed.
   She admitted hiring Michael Earls, 22, to shoot her husband in
their family home in Sedro Woolley, north of Seattle, on March 31,
1987, while she and the children were upstairs. She agreed to give
Earls $200, a VCR that didn't work and an old Volkswagen that
didn't work.
   Earls is serving a 30-year prison term.
   Alaniz initially was charged with aggravated first-degree
murder, which carries the possibility of the death penalty.
   But after she detailed the years of abuse, the charge was
reduced to second-degree murder and she pleaded guilty.
   At the time Alaniz faced trial, evidence of a history of abuse
could be used as a defense only if the person killed the abuser in
self-defense during an actual or imminent attack.
   Prompted by her case, the Washington Legislature passed a
measure giving lighter sentences to abuse victims who strike back
at their tormenters.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Charles, the architecture critic who would
be king, has set up a summer school to promote his own ideas about
design.
   The first five-week Prince of Wales' Summer School in Civil
Architecture will be held next summer, according to an announcement
Friday from Essex University, which is administering the
postgraduate course.
   Architecture students from Britain, Europe and North America who
have completed at least their bachelor's degrees will be eligible
to apply for 24 places in the course, which will include three
weeks in Oxford and two weeks in Rome.
   Students will pay $1,600 for the course. All other costs will be
met by funds raised privately by the prince, who is expected to
visit the course and may attend some of the classes, according to
Jules Lubbock, the school's director.
   In the course prospectus, Prince Charles writes that
architecture students are not properly exposed to classical design.
   ``Those rare students courageous enough to pursue this approach
on their own are sometimes browbeaten by their tutors; luckier ones
are merely ridiculed as freaks,'' the prince wrote.
   The course will concentrate on four disciplines: civic design
and building codes; invention and design within codes; building
materials and craft; and life drawing.
   ``Learning to draw the subtleties of the human body is the
time-honored way of tutoring the hand in the delicate lines of
beauty and harmonic proportion,'' the prospectus said.
   Lubbock said Prince Charles decided to sponsor a school after he
spent two years working on a television documentary, ``A Vision of
Britain,'' in which the heir to Britain's throne toured the country
praising neoclassical design and pointing out architectural
``carbuncles.''
   An exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum and a book, both
titled ``A Vision of Britain,'' elaborated on the principles that
will be the basis for the summer school.
   Some prominent architects have taken sharp exception to Charles'
architectural enthusiasms, but ``A Vision of Britain'' is now on
the bestseller list.
   In the course prospectus, Charles writes that design students
need to realize the role their buildings will play within their
environments.
   ``The philosophy of designing buildings from the inside out has
had the effect of tearing apart the fabric of our cities in a
jostling scrum of buildings of outlandish shapes and materials and
all kinds of heights and sizes screeching for attention like a
classroom of unruly children,'' he wrote.
   Some of the money for the school is expected to come from the
1851 Exhibition Fund. The Great Exhibition was the brainchild of
Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's husband, and made a considerable
profit from the crowds who came to see wonders such as the Crystal
Palace.

   Utah has the healthiest population of the 50
states and Delaware the sickest, according to a nationwide study
that seems to show higher elevations and northern lattitudes are
better for the body.
   The compilation of statistics from public and private health
groups showed people who live in most Rocky Mountain and Upper
Midwest states are healthier than residents of the Southeast and
the East Coast.
   Utah residents live an average of 2{ years longer than residents
of Delaware, according to the study by the Northwestern National
Life Insurance Co.
   ``Many of the states that show up at the bottom of the list
aren't the ones most people would expect. Florida, for example, has
one of the highest life expectancies, but poor health habits bring
it down to 44th place,'' said Frederic Sattler, head of the
insuror's health care division.
   ``Michigan, in spite of its high median income, ranked 48th, due
to the highest level of disease in America,'' he said.
   The study released this week compiled data from the 1986
National Health Survey, along with information from the American
Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the National Center
for Health Statistics and the American Medical Association.
   The states were compared in terms of life expectancy, incidence
of major illnesses, lifestyle habits such as tobacco and alcohol
consumption, access to medical care, absence from work due to
illness, and mortality rates.
   After Utah, the healthiest states were North Dakota, Idaho,
Minnesota and Hawaii. The bottom five were South Carolina, Nevada,
Michigan, Mississippi and Delaware.
   ``You'll probably find a pretty good correlation between health
and genetics, education, a clean environment and even the cultural
background,'' Sattler said.
   ``There's less of a relation between health and income,'' he
said, adding that Montana, with a median income below the national
average, ranked as one of the 10 healthiest states.
   Among the study's findings:
   _Hawaii has the highest life expectancy, followed by Minnesota,
Iowa, Utah and North Dakota.
   _Utah has the lowest incidence of major illness, followed by
Idaho, Wyoming, North Dakota and Minnesota.
   _Utah, where the dominant Mormon religion forbids use of many
stimulants, had the best ranking in terms of lifestyle habits such
as exercise and low smoking and drinking. Next in line were Idaho,
Iowa and Nebraska, and Kansas.
   _Hawaii and Utah tied for the lowest mortality rate, followed by
Alaska, North Dakota and Colorado.

   Former President Richard Nixon arrived in China
today for his sixth visit to a nation that regards him as one of
its oldest friends.
   Nixon was greeted at the airport by Han Xu, former ambassador to
the United States, and Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu.
   Nixon is traveling as a private citizen, but his spokesman, John
H. Taylor, said in the United States that Nixon would report to
President Bush upon his return.
   Nixon is the most prominent American visitor since the June
military crackdown on pro-democracy dissent chilled relations
between China and the United States. He is expected to meet China's
most senior leaders, including top leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Deng recently named Nixon and former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger as examples of outstanding politicians who saw that good
relations with China were important regardless of internal events
here.
   Nixon renewed bilateral relations with China by visiting as
president in 1972, at a time when China was still wracked by the
leftist Cultural Revolution.

<HEAD>Reagan Ends Trip, Calls for Free Trade Zone</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OSAKA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Ronald Reagan, winding up a
nine-day visit to Japan, said today that Americans do not feel
their products have fair access to Japanese markets and called for
a Pacific free trade zone.
   Addressing 400 prominent businessmen in the western port of
Osaka, Reagan said Japan and the United States should ``put this
step-by-step bickering behind us and embrace a trade vision that is
encompassing.''
   ``We are the two greatest economic powers in the world,'' Reagan
said. ``Let us leap beyond our no-win squabbling by undertaking a
breathtaking plan ...a free trade zone between the U.S. and Japan.''
   In earlier appearances during his current visit, Reagan glossed
over trade disputes to emphasize positive aspects of bilateral
ties. Today, he took direct aim at Japanese policy.
   Americans admire Japan, he said, but ``Sixty-eight percent of
Americans find the economic threat from Japan to be a more serious
threat...than the military threat from the Soviet Union.''
   ``The notion is wrong,'' but Americans believe U.S. products do
not get fair access in Japan, he said.
   Japan enjoyed a $52 billion trade surplus with the United States
last year, according to U.S. figures.
   Reagan said the principle of fairness had been a ``very strong
strain'' among Americans, referring to the unfair treatment from
Britain that provoked the Boston Tea Party in 1773. ``We don't want
a Japanese tea party,'' he said.
   In another criticism of Tokyo's policies, the former president
warned Japan faced possible boycotts of its products over practices
of drift-net fishing and logging in tropical rain forests.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, who arrived in Japan Oct. 20, left
for the United States today aboard a Boeing 747 chartered by their
hosts, the Fujisankei Communications Group, Japan's largest media
conglomerate.
   They shared the jet with 230 family members of U.S. military
personnel stationed in Japan who hitched a free ride with them to
the Orient.
   The Reagans, in Japan at the invitation of the government and
Fujisankei, have not commented on reports Reagan will receive about
$2 million for his appearances on television and at charitable
events during his visit.
   Fujisankei reportedly spent $7 million on the entire visit,
which has been seen as an opportunity to improve Japan's ties with
the United States.

   A Panamanian ship with eight people on board sank
in North Korean waters and two sailors are missing, Japanese
officials said today.
   The Maritime Safety Agency in Kobe, western Japan, received an
emergency call late Friday night from Shin Daido Kaiun, the ship's
Japanese agent, that the vessel sank 94 miles off the North Korean
port of Chongjin Wednesday morning.
   Missing after the sinking of the 498-ton Magma No. 3 are Yasushi
Kurokawa, 53, of Japan, and a Filipino cook, according to the
safety agency, Japan's coast guard.
   An agency official said the ship's Japanese captain, Takeshi
Hirata, and five other Filipino sailors were believed to be in good
condition.
   The vessel was on its way to Osaka, western Japan, carrying
1,450 tons of steel coils from Chongjin.

<HEAD>Veterans Say They'll Burn Flag in Protest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   SEATTLE (AP _ A crowd of hundreds watched as radical Vietnam
veterans torched 1,000 American flags in a ``festival of defiance''
early today minutes after a federal law prohibiting desecration of
the flag went into effect.
   Alternately chanting ``Burn, baby, burn'' and singing the
national anthem, the crowd cheered as members of Vietnam Veterans
Against the War-Anti-Imperialist torched a pile of American flags
shortly after midnight.
   On Friday, four cloth flags were burned in a protest at
Berkeley, Calif., and a flag burning at Colorado State University
was halted when a passerby snuffed the flames with his bare hands.
   Kathleen Taylor, American Civil Liberties Union director in
Seattle, said the law encourages the very action it's intended to
discourage.
   ``There were no incidents of public flag burning in Seattle
until Congress enacted the prohibition,'' she said. ``Liberty needs
special protection, not its symbol, the flag.''
   The law took effect at 12:01 a.m.
   One thousand flags _ one large and most of the rest the size of
a large postage stamp _ were burned in the Seattle protest,
organizers said.
   The demonstration was held in front of a post office and the
flag hanging on a pole outside the building was lowered, doused
with lighter fluid and set afire.
   ``We're burning the flag to say we will not stand by to see
forced patriotism. Abridgement of the First Amendment right (of
free speech) is the first infringement,'' said Brian Chambers, who
served in Vietnam in 1970-71.
   No voices were raised in opposition to torching the flags.
   Flag-burnings were conducted in other cities Friday.
   In Berkeley, members of the Emergency Committee to Stop the Flag
Amendment and Laws burned cloth flags and handed out small paper
flags mounted on toothpicks and asked bystanders to set them ablaze.
   ``As we all know, the flag is just a symbol, a piece of cloth;
even the right-wing Supreme Court upheld that position,'' attorney
Linda Fullerton, vice president of the Bay Area chapter of the
National Lawyers Guild, said at the demonstration. Fullerton did
not burn any flags at the protest.
   In Fort Collins, Colo., Jeff Crank nearly got his hands singed
when he broke up a protest at Colorado State by rubbing out the
flames of a burning flag with his bare hands.
   ``My father served in World War II,'' Crank shouted after
grabbing the flag. ``I'm not going to let what he did go by the
wayside so that you can burn this flag.''
   Jamie Krutz, a freelance writer who organized the protest, said
he was pleased with the impromptu debate that the partial
flag-burning had generated.
   ``We weren't eager to burn a flag in the first place,'' he said.
``We have a high respect for the flag. We have a higher respect for
freedom.''
   Burning one flag is punishable by a $1,000 fine and up to a year
in jail.
   The new law was passed by both houses of Congress earlier this
month in response to a Supreme Court ruling that struck down a
Texas law making it illegal to burn the U.S. flag.
   The law is subject to judicial review. Opponents and supporters
have said that if the court overturns the law, there will be new
pressure to amend the Constitution to allow Congress and the states
to ban flag desecration.

<HEAD>New ACT Test Goes Into Use Today</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   They will still use No. 2 pencils to fill
in the oval blanks, but the ACT tests administered today to
aspiring college students have undergone their first overhaul since
the American College Testing Program began in 1959.
   ``There is more of an emphasis than ever on the ability of a
student to think and apply and problem-solve with the new test
rather than just to recall some fact or piece of information,'' ACT
President Richard Ferguson said Friday.
   Ferguson said ``well over'' 300,000 students are registered to
take the Enhanced ACT Assessment test nationwide today. Most
colleges in 28 U.S. states weigh the ACT test results in their
application procedures.
   The new ACT test includes 215 questions and takes 2 hours and 55
minutes to complete. The old test had 219 questions and took 2
hours and 40 minutes.
   Work on the new exam began seven or eight years ago and ACT
officials have studied, surveyed and tested it over the last three
or four years, Ferguson said.
   ``There won't be surprises for us,'' he said. ``We know how it
will work.''
   The new test will give more detailed information on students to
high schools and colleges, Ferguson said.
   The English section includes questions that measure a student's
awareness of decisions a person makes when writing, including style
and audience.
   The range of questions has increased in the math section to
include easier and more difficult questions and has been lengthened
by 10 questions and 10 minutes.
   The new reading section includes fiction and readings in the
humanities.
   The knowledge-of-facts items have been dropped from the Science
Reasoning section, which now focuses on the process of science. The
section still includes material from science areas covered in high
school.
   The enhanced test also includes subscores in English, math and
reading, which the old test did not compile.
   ACT officials expect higher scores but say it is not easier.
   ``On the average, the test will not be more difficult than it
was before. We are simply testing some different things,'' Ferguson
said.
   Overall scoring has changed so that a 15 composite score last
year might be comparable to an 18 composite this year, officials
said. The range is from 1 to 36.

   The hopes of striking Eastern Airlines workers have
been bolstered by congressional support of an investigation into
the carrier's labor dispute.
   ``I think it's a tremendous boost,'' said Skip Orr, spokesman
for Eastern pilots.
   Company officials expressed confidence Friday that the
congressional commission bill, which first must go before a
conference committee to resolve minor differences with a
House-passed version, will be vetoed by President Bush. The
administration has said it does not want to become involved in a
labor-management dispute.
   The Senate, on a 65-35 vote, Thursday approved its version of a
bill to create a commission to resolve the strike affecting about
30,000 machinists, flight attendants and pilots who have been off
the job since early March.
   Eastern, which plans to add 75 flights next week as it rebuilds
without its unions, has been investigated by the Federal Aviation
Administration and Department of Transportation, and the
congressional commission is unnecessary, spokesman Robin Matell
said.
   ``We've been throughly investigated, and we've always come
through with flying colors,'' Matell said.
   Charles E. Bryan, president of Machinists union District 100,
said he has more confidence in a congressional investigation than
the past probes, which he said were whitewashes.
   ``They've controlled the investigations before. I don't think
they feel quite as confident about this one,'' said Bryan, whose
union, representing mechanics, ramp agents and baggage handlers,
walked out March 4 and was joined by the pilots and flight
attendants unions at Eastern.
   Under the bill, a Democrat and Republican from each house of
Congress would be appointed by their respective leaders and over 45
days would investigate the Eastern situation. They would make
recommendations on how to resolve the strike, and also on how to
preserve competitiveness in the airline industry and how to protect
employees' rights during bankruptcy protection.
   Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days
after the strike began.
   The union struck after federal mediation failed to resolve their
contract dispute. President Bush was empowered to intervene then,
but refused.
   The dispute is over proposed wage cuts and work-rule changes,
but the unions charge that Texas Air, which bought Eastern in 1986,
planned all along to break Eastern's unions while siphoning off its
assets to the parent company.
   Eastern on Wednesday will increase its daily flights to 775 and
is aiming to fly 1,000 daily flights by midspring. Eastern had
nearly 1,100 daily flights when the strike began.

<HEAD>Three Firms Pull Out of Computerized Trading Strategy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Stock Exchange said it would
contact Wall Street brokerages about reforming computerized program
trading rules after three major firms dropped the strategy.
   Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., two of the
biggest users of program trading, said Friday they would stop using
a form of the strategy known as index arbitrage to trade for their
own accounts. PaineWebber Group Inc. also stopped using the
strategy.
   Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Co. of Hartford, Conn., which
manages more than $8.6 billion in assets, stopped doing business
with brokerages that conduct program trading _ becoming the third
large institution to do so this week.
   ``Certainly as a marketplace that has almost 47 million
individual investors we have got to be concerned about anything
that might be harmful to those constituent users,'' NYSE President
Richard Grasso said.
   Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. asked the NYSE to place new limits on index
arbitrage, while Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. _ which abandoned the
strategy earlier this year _ sent a sharply critical letter to more
than 2 million clients.
   The outcry follows a return of volatile market price swings in
recent weeks, including the 190-point drop in the Dow Jones
industrial average on Oct. 13 and an 85-point morning drop this
past Monday.
   Earlier this week, Kemper Financial Services Inc. and Keystone
Group Inc., two major institutional investors, said they would no
longer buy or sell stock through brokerages that conduct index
arbitrage. Phoenix Mutual followed suit Friday.
   Index arbitrage is a computerized trading strategy aimed at
profiting on brief and minute differences between prices of stocks
and stock-index futures, which are traded on Chicago futures
exchanges.
   The trading tactic, in which millions of shares can be bought or
sold in seconds, often is geared to make short-term gains in
excitable markets.

<BYLINE>Bacon Turns 80, Hailed as Britain's Greatest Living Artist ^By
GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Francis Bacon, acknowledged by his fellow painters
as Britain's greatest living artist, turns 80 today and told a
caller: ``I'm not celebrating it. I'm not going anywhere and I
don't want any presents.''
   Then he hung up.
   Bacon is known for being difficult. He prefers the company of a
very few friends, with whom he chats in bars and restaurants. He
suffers badly from asthma, which prevented him from visiting Moscow
last fall when he became the first living Western artist to be
honored with a retrospective exhibition there.
   On Thursday night, Bacon failed to attend the private viewing of
a loan exhibition of 15 of his works to mark his birthday at his
agents, Marlborough Fine Art in Albemarle street off Piccadilly.
But he did show up Friday morning.
   ``He looked very well _ he's still painting of course,'' said a
member of the staff.
   Bacon paints disquieting and disturbing pictures of people, dogs
and carcasses in rooms that look like torture chambers. His work
portrays the world in anguish.
   One of his favorite images is the 17th century Pope Innocent X
in a famous portrait by Diego Velazquez. Bacon took over the
Velazquez and on several canvases depicted the pope caged in plate
glass and screaming.
   ``I wanted to record the human cry, the whole coagulation of
pain and despair,'' he has said of his work.
   A Bacon painting titled ``Triptych May-June'' was auctioned in
New York in May for $6.27 million, a record for any living British
artist.
   ``He is one of the most inspirational of European artists,''
said Richard Francis, who selected the Bacon retrospective at
London's Tate Gallery in 1984.
   The curator said a current exhibition of new paintings by Bacon
at the Hirshorn Museum in Washington, D.C., ``shows no diminuition
of his qualities or abilities _ in fact they look stronger than in
some of his earlier work.''
   Bacon was born in Dublin, Ireland but is regarded as a British
painter because he has lived in London since he was 16. He
destroyed much of his early work and his surviving paintings of the
1930s show the influence of Pablo Picasso.
   ``Because of Bacon, the art world has taken British art
seriously,'' Francis said.

   Convicted murderer Willie Horton said his
portrayal during the 1988 presidential campaign was an example of
racist politics.
   President Bush's campaign fueled racial fears ``by implying that
if Governor (Michael) Dukakis were elected, he would unleash
monsters like myself on an unsuspecting public,'' Horton said in an
interview published in the December issue of Playboy.
   Horton defended the Massachusetts prison furlough program that
Bush criticized in his campaign, and said he was contacted during
the campaign by a Republican pollster who tried to pressure him to
declare support for Dukakis.
   Horton, who is black, escaped in 1986 while on his 10th furlough
from a life sentence for a 1974 murder. He was arrested in 1987 and
charged in the brutal assault of a Maryland couple.
   Horton must serve two life sentences plus 85 years in the
Maryland State Penitentiary before resuming his Massachusetts
sentence.

<TEXT>
   Colombia's former justice minister said the entire
international community must help her nation battle its drug
barons, and could start by helping to pay for reforms of the
Colombian justice system.
   Monica de Greiff, 32, served only 70 days as her nation's top
law enforcement official before resigning last month amid threats
from traffickers and fleeing with her family to the United States.
   Dozens of plainclothes U.S. marshals and Miami police officers
stood guard Friday as she addressed the Colombian American Chamber
of Commerce of Greater Miami, her first public speech since leaving
office.
   ``I am not in favor of a dialogue (with drug traffickers), and I
upheld that policy in the time I served as a minister,'' Ms. de
Greiff said. ``And I believe that continues to be the policy.''
   Instead, she said the international community must cease feuding
over whether the drug problem is one of producing or consuming
nations and form a united front against drugs.
   ``Our societies have been challenged by this invisible enemy, a
common enemy,'' said Ms. de Geiff. ``There is no historical
precedent for this kind of war.''
   Neither the Opium Wars in China during the last century nor the
U.S. experiment with Prohibition in the 1920s created problems of
the current magnitude, she said.
   ``Colombia cannot continue to fight alone with the United States
as its only partner,'' said Ms. de Greiff.
   She said one concrete step would be for the international
financial community to smooth the way for a $40 million loan to
modernize and protect Colombia's beleaguered judicial branch.
   Ms. de Greiff resigned at the height of drug-related violence
sparked by the Aug. 18 assassination of leading presidential
candidate Sen. Luis Carlos Galan.
   Her resignation was widely attributed to repeated death threats,
but she has said she quit because President Virgilio Barco wanted
to replace her.
   Since leaving office, Ms. de Greiff has been living in the U.S.
with her husband, Argentine public relations consultant Miguel
Paley, and their 3-year-old son. She said she has not been
threatened in the U.S. and plans to stay in this country for the
present.

<HEAD>Hometown Remembers Anderson on Fifth Birthday in Captivity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATAVIA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Terry Anderson was taken hostage in
Lebanon in 1985, his high school classmates were planning their
20th reunion.
   Now they're planning their 25th reunion and Anderson's release
seems no closer, said classmate Steve Hawley at ceremonies Friday
in the town where the hostage grew up.
   Friends and family unveiled a flag-draped statue of Anderson and
sang ``Amazing Grace'' to mark the hostage's 42nd birthday, his
fifth in captivity.
   ``It was a tearful moment,'' said Anne Zickl, the Batavia
coordinator for the Anderson family's efforts to free American
hostages in Lebanon.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was taken captive in Beirut March 16, 1985. He is believed
held by a fundamentalist Shiite Moslem group.
   The statue, created by sculptor Louis Dlugosz of the Buffalo
suburb of Lackawanna, includes chains binding Anderson's hands to
symbolize his captivity.
   The statue will be on display at the Genesee Country Mall in
Batavia until Anderson comes home. Then the chain will be removed
and the statue given to him, Zickl said.
   During an hour-long ceremony at the mall, several hundred people
gathered for the statue's unveiling, Zickl said.
   The crowd sang ``Amazing Grace'' as the flag was removed from
the statue and given to Penny Anderson, the hostage's
sister-in-law, who lives in Batavia, in western New York about 35
miles east of Buffalo.
   Those working for the release of Anderson and other hostages
fear their prolonged captivity may leave permanent psychological
scars, Zickl said.
   ``What condition will these men be in when they come home?'' she
said after the ceremony. ``They may be physically alive but we
don't know whether they will be able to be rehabilitated.''
   Anderson's birthday was declared ``National Hostage Awareness
Day'' by Congress. A commemorative service was also held for
Anderson at Georgetown University Chapel in Washington, D.C.
   Church bells throughout Batavia were rung at noon Friday in
Anderson's honor.

<HEAD>Escapee Sends Videotape Complaint On Jail Conditions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An escaped prisoner sent a videotape
back to his captors complaining about his treatment at the jail
where he was serving a 25-year term for kidnapping.
   Sammy Joe Michael Duncan, 18, complained in the videotape about
the length of his sentence for last year's abduction of former Bibb
County Sheriff Harry Johnson and Centreville Police Chief Mike
Nichols.
   ``That was just entirely too much time, considering my age,''
Duncan said. ``I've seen people who committed more violent crimes
than mine and got less time than I did.''
   Duncan, who escaped the jail earlier this month by slipping
through its bars, is seen shirtless on the videotape as he operates
the recording device.
   The 15-minute tape was found Tuesday night in a garbage can
behind a restaurant in Centreville, about 45 miles south of
Birmingham, by WBRC-TV cameraman Bill Castle, who said the station
was called by someone who said he was Duncan's friend.
   The Birmingham station shared the tape with Bibb County Sheriff
James Fondren, who reviewed it with deputies Thursday.
   ``He wants to portray himself as some sort of Robin Hood, a good
ol' boy who was mistreated, but nothing could be farther from the
truth,'' said Chief Deputy David McCrary. ``He committed a serious
felony.''
   Duncan complained on the videotape that his television set and
radio were taken away and family visitations were cut following
discovery of a sawed-off shotgun in his cell about a month ago.
   ``All this pressure they put on me ... when the pressure gets
too far and you can't take it no more, you just got to get away,''
Duncan said on the tape.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S.-backed rebels have blocked a key
highway for seven days, cutting flour and fuel shipments to the
capital, government soldiers said today.
   Soldiers said heavy fighting had broken out on the Salang
highway, just north of Kabul on the southern slope of the massive
Hindu Kush mountains. For the past three nights, government forces
have launched dozens of Soviet-made Katyusha rockets at the highway
from bases in Kabul.
   In Pakistan, the private news agency Afghan Press reported that
government planes had bombed a 40-mile stretch of the highway to
push through U.N. supplies headed for Kabul. The rebel alliance's
official news organ said, however, it could not confirm the attacks.
   The government troops said more than 1,500 trucks carrying food
and weapons were backed up on the highway. They said shipments of
fuel and food from Harytan, on the Soviet border, had stopped and
more than 18,000 metric tons of gasoline and oil are waiting at the
border town for shipment.
   A U.N. official said some of the supplies on the Salang road
were from a U.N. shipment of Finnish aid which entered Afghanistan
last week. But he said it took up only several trucks. Most of the
aid is going to poor families in northern Afghanistan.
   In the capital, government forces have been launching scores of
rockets north in the direction of the highway. On Friday night the
sky was streaked red with flames from the rocket boosters as they
sped north. Seconds later the sky would be bright orange, with
explosions lighting up the black hills.
   Government and private markets have been without flour, the main
grain of Afghanistan, since mid-week. The city, however, is not in
immediate danger. Silos holding 50,000 metric tons of grain are
reportedly full.
   The Salang road is the only land route through which a
substantial amount of commodities have passed recently. The road
east to Jalalabad is ``open one day, closed the next,'' said one
soldier. The road south to Logram is effectively closed to
government traffic as is the road west to Herat.
   Hundreds of Antonov-12 supply planes from the Soviet Union have
arrived at Kabul's international airport over the past few days.
But each plane can only carry about 30 tons each.
   Gasoline prices are skyrocketing in the city, going as high as
6,500 Afghanis ($13.25) a gallon. When asked where the flour is,
merchants at food markets put ther fingers to their lips and blow
imaginary dust from their nails.
   ``It's gone with the wind,'' said one trader, sitting on a bag
of rice in his converted ship container which he uses as a store.
   It could not be immediately determined which rebel group was
carrying out the attacks on the Salang road, which primarily is the
domain of mujahedeen commander ahmad shah masoud of the powerful
jamiat-i-islami rebel group.
   Masoud has pledged not to attack non-military traffic, but the
rival hezb-i-islami group of fundamentalist gulbaddin hekmatyar has
said it wants to cut all supplies to kabul, forcing people to flee.
Hezb guerrillas operate to a limited extent along the lower salang,
close to the capital.
   The fighting appeared to be part of a recent increase in rebel
assaults against the government.
   Fighting over the southeastern town of Khost has intensified
over the last month with reports of rebel gains. The guerrillas got
so close to the city in late September that the government was
forced to kill its own troops with Soviet-made SCUD missiles when
it wiped out rebel positions, a diplomat said.
   The diplomat, who comes from a socialist country with good
relations with Afghanistan, cited a government military source for
the information.
   Observers in Kabul said the current military activity appeared
to indicate the rebels were returning to the hit-and-run startegy
they used during the decade-long Soviet military intervention.
   Rebel attempts to adopt conventional military tactics and take
the eastern city of Jalalabad earlier this year failed.

<TEXT>
   Noah Robinson, the half brother of Jesse Jackson,
was charged with hiring members of a gang to kill a business
associate in a series of indictments involving 65 top leaders and
members of the El Rukn street gang.
   The gang members were charged in the murder of 20 people, the
attempted murder of seven people, racketeering, witness
intimidation, kidnapping and obstruction of justice, U.S. Attorney
Anton R. Valukas said at a news conference Friday.
   Officials say the indictments have dealt a ``death blow'' to the
notorious Chicago street gang, and they could put Robinson behind
bars for life.
   The El Rukns also were charged with controlling a major part of
Chicago's drug market over the last 24 years. The indictment also
charged five Robinson associates with fraud, racketeering and
conspiracy.
   ``We intend ... to bring an end to this scourge that has
debilitated the city of Chicago and suburbs throughout these
years,'' Valukas said. ``I expect if the prosecutions are
effective, yes, it will be a death blow'' to the El Rukn gang.
   The arrest of the gang members could help solve up to 50
unsolved slayings dating to the late 1960s, said Dot Koester,
spokeswoman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in
Washington.
   Robinson, 45, was arrested at his South Side home Friday,
Valukas said. If convicted, he could be sentenced to 249 years in
prison.
   Robinson and Jackson, a Democratic candidate for president in
1984 and 1988, have the same father, but Jackson has described
their relationship as strained.
   Robinson's associates face an average of 160 years in prison if
convicted. The indictment charged that Robinson sold heroin and
cocaine to a drug operation that controlled hundreds of markets in
Chicago and Milwaukee and had ties in New York, South Carolina,
Florida, Michigan, Texas, Wisconsin and Mississippi.
   The drug operation netted millions of dollars in profits,
Valukas said.
   Robinson also is charged with paying El Rukn leader Jeff Fort
$10,000 to kill business associate Robert Aulston in 1985. It also
alleges that Robinson offered $10,000 to kill Leroy ``Hambone''
Barber in Greenville, S.C.
   Barber was killed Jan. 3, 1986. Robinson was convicted and
sentenced earlier this year to 10 years in prison in connection
with the murder-for-hire of a witness to the Barber killing. He is
free on a $1.1 million bond pending an appeal.
   Fort was sentenced to 155 years in federal prison on a 1988
conviction for offering to commit terrorism for Libya. Four other
gang members also were convicted of conspiracy to commit terrorism
and conspiracy to violate federal firearms and explosives laws.
   Robinson and five associates also were charged with skimming
$650,000 from the profits of three Wendy's International Inc.
restaurants on Chicago's South Side through the management company
they controlled.
   Seventeen of the El Rukns and the five Robinson associates
charged were in custody. The remaining defendants were being sought
in Milwaukee, Minneapolis, South Carolina, Ohio and New York,
Valukas said.
   Chicago police seized the El Rukns' South Side headquarters in a
morning raid Friday. Police Superintendent LeRoy Martin said the
site would be turned into a playground.
   ``I think it's poetic justice for a group of people that brought
so much pain to our community,'' Martin said.
   The gang took on the name El Rukn after Fort, its leader, became
a Muslim. El Rukn is the cornerstone of the Kaaba, a sacred Moslem
shrine in Mecca.

   Abortion opponents say they will have
to wait until spring to have abortion restrictions considered again
by the General Assembly.
   Ralph Rivera, chairman of the Illinois Pro-Life Coalition, said
oppoents of legalized abortion have decided not to push the
legislation any more this year because the bill is one vote short
of getting through the House Rules Committee.
   ``We really don't want a media event on this,'' he said Friday.
   The decision likely postpones any action on abortion legislation
in Illinois until the spring session.
   The proposal, drafted to mirror Missouri abortion restrictions
upheld by the Supreme Court, would have required doctors to
determine the viability of any fetus believed to be 20 weeks old or
older before performing an abortion.
   It also required the presence of a second physician at the
abortion of any fetus determined to be viable, and barred public
employees and public facilities from involvement in the procedures.

<TEXT>
   John Beckman, who designed the sets for
``Casablanca'' and other classic films and for the hit TV sitcom
``Designing Women,'' has died at age 91.
   Beckman, who continued to work occasional 15-hour days on the
set of ``Designing Women'' well into his 91st year, died in his
sleep Wednesday at his suburban Sherman Oaks home.
   Beckman began his career in 1934 as art director of the film
``Nana.''
   His design credits extend from the murals and theater of Santa
Catalina Island's Avalon casino to the sets of ``Casablanca,''
``Lost Horizon'' and ``The Maltese Falcon.''
   Born in Oregon, he was raised in San Francisco and survived the

<HEAD>John David Brown Gets Life Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROLLA, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Bible-quoting judge sentenced John David
Brown to life in prison with no parole for murdering a church
caretaker.
   Brown, who had eluded hundreds of police officers in the longest
manhunt in Missouri history, showed no emotion as Judge Douglas
Long pronounced the sentence Friday.
   A jury convicted Brown on July 29 of murdering Claude C. Long
inside a church in nearby Doolittle in central Missouri on April 1,
1987.
   ``Two different individuals were taking refuge in that church
for different reasons,'' the judge said, adding a quote from the
Book of Amos in the Bible: ``As if a man were to flee from a lion
and be met by a bear.''
   ``Do you understand that?'' Long asked.
   After appearing bewildered for a moment, Brown slowly nodded his
head and said, ``Yes sir.''
   The victim, a retired soldier, was preparing the church for
evening services when he was shot.
   The judge, no relation to the victim, said the case lacked the
necessary aggravating circumstances to warrant the death penalty.
   County Prosecutor John Wiggins said he was not disappointed with
the life sentence.
   ``Our primary objective was conviction through a fair trial, and
that's what Mr. Brown received,'' he said.
   About 45 spectators attended the sentencing, including Brown's
father, grandmother and sister. They did not act surprised by the
verdict.
   ``I figured they'd do this,'' said Brown's grandmother, Lula
Brooks, 82. ``But I still don't think they truthfully proved he
killed that man.''
   Brown's court-appointed attorney, Brad Kessler, made an
impassioned plea to jurors to spare Brown's life for the sake of
his sickly father and elderly grandmother.
   He praised the judge's decision.
   ``I think he did a lot of soul searching and I think that he did
what was right for him,'' Kessler said. ``I think the punishment
fits the crime.''
   But Kessler said he would file an appeal within 10 days.
   Brown had frustrated police for weeks by hiding out in the Ozark
Mountains after the killing, inspiring songs and stories in nearby
towns.
   He was captured on May 28, 1987, by FBI agents in Ada, Okla. A
.357-caliber Magnum revolver found on Brown was identified by
several ballistics experts as the gun used to kill Long.
   Long, 56, a military retiree from Waynesville, was preparing the
New Apostolic Church west of Rolla when he was shot once in the
head. The prosecution contended that Brown shot Long and then stole
the victim's car.
   At the time, police were hunting Brown for allegedly wounding a
Rolla police officer two days earlier in a motel parking lot.
   Brown had been at large since escaping in 1984 from the Ozark
Correctional Center, where he was serving time for burglary and
possession of explosive weapons.

<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. and leaders of its biggest union
agreed to hold contract talks for just the second time since more
than 115,000 workers went on strike Oct. 4.
   Negotiators from the aircraft company and the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers will meet
separately with a mediator Sunday, and direct negotiations will be
held the next day, federal mediator Doug Hammond said Friday.
   Hammond said he would try to keep the two sides at the table
until agreement is reached, although negotiators for both sides
said Friday they wouldn't budge an inch from their current
positions.
   The strike has slowed production at a time orders for commercial
jetliners are piling up because of growth in air travel.
   The Machinists represent 57,800 Boeing workers nationwide,
including 43,300 in the district lodge; 12,000 in Wichita, Kan.,
1,700 in Portland, Ore., and a few hundred others at scattered
sites in California, Hawaii, Utah, Montana, Wyoming and other
states.
   In the only other negotiating attempt during the strike, Hammond
shuttled between the two sides for nearly four hours Oct. 18
without result.
   Since then, Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz has ruled out any
increase in the financial offer and Tom Baker, president of
Machinists District Lodge 751, has ruled out a return to work
without more money.
   ``We have not changed our position. We still want improvement,''
said Lodge 751 spokesman Jack Daniels on Friday.
   On Wednesday, strikers received their first strike pay of $100 a
week each from the union.
   Boeing said two more aircraft were delivered Friday, a 737-400
to Aer Lingus of Ireland and a 737-300 to United Airlines. They
followed Thursday deliveries of a 747-400 to Lufthansa and a
767-300ER to All Nippon Airways.
   Boeing has delivered 15 aircraft during the walkout, all of
which were nearly finished before the strike began.

   A woman who police originally said was a
teen-age kidnap victim turned out to to be a 27-year-old with a
history of mental problems, authorities said.
   The woman, initially known to police as Toby Cole and believed
at first to be about 15 years old, has been positively identified
as Margaret Louise Herget, according to a statement issued jointly
Friday by the FBI and Falmouth police.
   The woman _ who turned up, frightened and confused, at an
elementary school five weeks ago _ had been in protective custody
while the FBI tried to piece together her story and find any
relatives or friends.
   FBI Special Agent Paul Cavanagh in Boston had said the woman was
a deaf teen-ager believed to have been kidnapped about three years
ago in northern California, possibly by satanists.
   Falmouth Police Lt. Michael Bouchard told a news conference
Friday that Ms. Herget was identified through calls from a friend
in Metairie, La., where Ms. Herget moved in August, and from calls
from friends elsewhere.
   Bouchard said that Ms. Herget has used a half-dozen other names
at times, and was living with her parents in the Sandy, Ore., area
as recently as this past summer.
   Bouchard said the woman, whom he described as hearing-impaired
but not deaf, was last seen in Metairie just three days before she
turned up at William B. Jack Elementary School in Portland on Sept.
18.
   Earlier, Cavanagh had said that drawings made by the mystery
woman had led authorities to believe she had been with persons tied
to the occult after being abducted.
   Bouchard said the woman would not be charged with any crimes.
   Asked in a telephone interview whether the case was still
regarded as a possible kidnapping, Bouchard answered: ``We do not
believe so.''
   Bouchard declined to say where Ms. Herget was Friday. Police
were in contact with her parents.

<HEAD>Diver Says He Has Found Wrecks of Sunken Lake Steamers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES WEBB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A salvage expert who discovered two 19th Century
steamers at the bottom of Lake Michigan is battling the state for
control of the wrecks.
   Harry Zych searched the cold waters of the lake for nearly 16
years to find the Seabird and the Lady Elgin, a luxury steamer
whose 287 passengers and their valuables sank when the boat was
accidentally rammed by another vessel in 1860.
   ``All I want to do is see this wreck preserved,'' Zych said
Friday, referrring to the Lady Elgin.
   In August the 41-year-old diver and salvage company operator
filed a claim in U.S. District Court in Chicago seeking title to
the two ships under federal Admiralty Law.
   Diving in 42-degree water, he already has removed some artifacts
from the wrecks and says more should be brought to the surface for
preservation. The recovered items are under control of the court
until ownership is decided.
   Illinois officials claim the wrecks are state property and
should stay at the bottom, untouched except for authorized
archeological work and recreational sightseeing by divers.
   ``To go in and strip them of artifacts and sell them is just not
palatable to the state and is not in the best interest of the
state,'' said William Kane, an assistant state attorney general.
   Kane's office is seeking to intervene in the case on behalf of
the Illinois Department of Transportation and the Illinois Historic
Agency.
   A 1987 federal law gives states the rights to any shipwrecks
found in their territorial waters, Kane said. The state is also
citing an Illinois law that prohibits the desecration of
unregistered graves.
   Although Zych won't reveal the specific location of the wrecks,
he doesn't dispute that the wrecks lie in Illinois waters and his
legal action in federal court in Chicago indicates they are.
   The sinking of the Lady Elgin Sept. 8, 1860, somewhere off
Chicago's North Shore suburbs ranks as one of the worst disasters
in the history of Great Lakes shipping. The death toll is listed as
287 _ most of the victims were members of a Milwaukee political
group returning from an excursion to Chicago.
   The wooden side-wheeled steamer was rammed by the lumber
schooner Augusta, which was running without lights. The Lady Elgin
sank rapidly, and only a handful of passengers made it to shore in
Winnetka.
   In a lesser-known tragedy, the Seabird caught fire and sank
April 9, 1868, killing all but one of the 100 passengers on board.
Also a side-wheeled steamer, the Seabird was making its first run
of the season to Chicago after wintering in Manitowoc, Wis.
   Zych said he has found no remains on either wreck and cited
newspaper and other historical accounts that all the bodies were
recovered soon after the sinkings.
   Zych, who runs the American Diving and Salvage Co., said he
first started looking for the Lady Elgin in 1973, and found it in
May using sonar.
   He found the Seabird in 1988.

<HEAD>Police Find Europe's Top Cocaine Lab, Seize 440 Pounds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have uncovered what they believe to
be the largest cocaine processing laboratory in Europe and seized
440 pounds of the drug hidden inside woolen blankets, police said
today.
   Six people, all natives of Colombia or Cuba, were arrested.
   The spokesman said the laboratory was located in an industrial
warehouse in Mejorada del Campo, 15 miles east of the capital. The
facility was raided late Friday, he said on condition of anonymity.
   The operation came only two days after top U.S., Spanish,
Italian and French drug enforcement officials met in Madrid with
representatives of Latin American cocaine-producing and consuming
nations.
   In the raid, narcotics agents captured 300 Indian-style
``ponchos,'' or blankets, impregnated with the cocaine, which had a
street value of about $8 million, the spokesman said.
   Police surprised two men as they began a chemical process to
remove the cocaine from the blankets, the spokesman said.
   Police also seized at least 260 gallons of ether, a chemical
used to transform coca leaf paste into cocaine, as well as other
chemicals, he said.
   Also today, police seized 240 pounds of heroin, the largest-ever
single haul in Spain, in a car parked in the garage of a home in
southern Granada province.
   Two Turkish men and a British woman were previously arrested in
connection with the heroin in Nerja, on Spain's southern Costa del
Sol, police said.
   Spanish and international drug enforcement agencies have said
Spain was being used as a gateway into Europe by Latin American _
mainly Colombian _ drug traffickers.
   But recently, Miguel Solans, head of Spain's National Plan on
Drugs coordination agency, said increased police and customs
efforts had led traffickers to move shipments into Europe through
the Netherlands, Britain and West Germany.
   The larger cocaine seizures in Europe this year have taken place
in those three countries, he said.
   So far this year, police in Spain have seized more than 2,200
pounds of cocaine. But in 1988, Spanish police seized 7,700 pounds
of the drug, a sharp increase over the 2,200 pounds captured the
year before.
   Seizures of cocaine in 1988 for all of Western Europe totaled
14,000 pounds, according to National Plan on Drugs agency
statistics.

<HEAD>Unemployment To Hit 4 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's tough austerity program is
putting people out of work and unemployment will double to 4
percent by the end of the year, a newspaper quoted officials as
saying today.
   Song Xiaowu of the China Enterprise Management Association told
an international business forum that millions of people in rural
areas _ not included in Chinese employment figures _ also will be
without work.
   ``The Sword of Damocles hanging over the capitalist society is
now hanging over the heads of the workers of new China,'' the
official China Daily quoted Song as saying.
   He said unemployment among China's urban workforce of 135
million stood at 2 percent in February, but has increased sharply
since the government suspended construction projects and took other
measures to curb overheated economic growth.
   ``The unemployment problem has come to the forefront of our
whole society,'' Song was quoted as saying. ``How to correctly
identify and effectively solve the problem poses a new challenge to
the theory and practice of China's economic development and
structural reforms.''
   Chinese officials have acknowledged the austerity program will
put people out of work. Previously, however, they stressed that
most people losing jobs are rural transients who will return to
work on their farms.
   Song said, however, that there are 80 million surplus farmers.
Township enterprises that have provided jobs for many will absorb
50 percent fewer workers this year than last.
   Song said China's unemployment problems are exacerbated by 20
million surplus workers in state-owned enterprises who can't be
laid off because of the government's policy of providing jobs for
all.
   Beijing has made an attempt to cope with the unemployment
situation by encouraging out-of-work people to set up collective
and private businesses and exempting them from income tax for one
year and business tax for half a year.
   However, they were unlikely to get many takers under the current
political and economic atmosphere. Private entrepreneurs are being
strongly criticized as ``exploiters'' and the government has cut
off credit to smaller businesses.
   Meanwhile, the nation as a whole is doing little about the
unemployment problem. A few cities have experimented with providing
unemployment insurance, but for the most part people without work
receive no benefits and get little help finding work.

   A former USS Iowa gunnery officer who
permitted sailors to conduct unauthorized experiments with the
battleship's 16-inch guns has been given a letter of reprimand,
Navy officials announced.
   The punishment was imposed Friday on Lt. Cmdr. Kenneth M.
Costigan, Sr. at an administrative hearing stemming from the
explosion in a gun turret on the battleship that killed 47 sailors
April 19.
   Costigan, who was relieved of command of the Iowa's big guns
earlier this year, also received a suspended fine of $1,500, which
will be negated in six months if he does not violate good-behavior
rules, the Navy said.
   Costigan has been reassigned to a position in a shore command in
Norfolk, Navy sources told The Daily Press of Newport News.
   Costigan is the fifth and final Iowa sailor to be reprimanded
for ``administrative deficiencies'' uncovered in an investigation
of the blast. The Navy has emphasized that those deficiencies did
not contribute to the deaths in turret No. 2 of the battleship.
   Navy officials have said that while they may never know the
exact cause of the explosion, the ``preponderance'' of evidence
points to an act of sabotage by Clayton M. Hartwig, a 24-year-old
gunners mate from Cleveland, who was killed in the blast.
   Under the direction of one of Costigan's subordinates, the crew
of turret No. 2 prepared to fire a 2,700-pound projectile with the
wrong kind of powder the day of the explosions. Costigan has said
he believed the crew was engaging in authorized ordnance
experiments.

<HEAD>Presidential Envoy to Visit Vietnam for Humanitarian Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An envoy of President Bush will meet
with officials in Vietnam next week to discuss missing American
soldiers and other humanitarian issues.
   Presidential envoy John W. Vessey Jr., a retired general, is to
arrive Sunday for a two-day visit, the first by an American
official since Vietnam said it had withdrawn its troops in Cambodia
last month.
   Vessey is to hold talks on humanitarian issues including efforts
to account for an estimated 1,700 American soldiers missing from
the war in Vietnam, a U.S. Embassy spokesman in Bangkok said today.
   Vessey's visit in August 1987 resulted in agreements to speed up
work on humanitarian issues, including the resettlement of
Vietnamese migrants and refugees in the United States. He was the
highest-ranking U.S. official to visit since the Communists
defeated the U.S.-backed South Vietnam government in April 1975.
   ``This current mission seeks to expand and improve on the
significant progress attained over the past two years,'' said the
embassy spokesman, James Williams.
   He said Vessey's team included senior State and Defense
Department officials and Ann Mills Griffiths, the head of the
private National League of Families of American Prisioners And
Missing In Southeast Asia.
   The visit comes as U.S. and Vietnamese specialists were halfway
into their 8th joint field investigations to account for missing
soldiers. One team was investigating an area in Song Be province in
southern Vietnam, while the other team was working in Ha Bac
province in the northern region.
   The Vietnamese seek American diplomatic recognition to end their
isolation from the non-Communist world and bring in badly needed
economic assistance. They have complained about U.S. refusal to
move in that direction after Vietnam in late September withdrew
what it called its last 26,000 troops from Cambodia _an action
Washington had called a prerequisite for establishing relations.
   But Washington now demands that Vietnam work toward getting a
political settlement to the war between Western-backed guerrillas
and the Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh.
   ``In the current situation we plan to steadfastly maintain our
support for the diplomatic and economic isolation of Vietnam,''
U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State David F. Lambertson said
earlier this month.
   On Friday, the official Voice of Vietnam radio said there have
been ``new developments'' in relations with the United States in
recent months, and noted the visit by Vessey and previous visits by
prominent Americans.
   It noted that Vietnam earlier this month returned three sets of
remains believed to be those of missing Americans. Since March 1974
Vietnam has repatriated 394 sets of remains on 29 occasions, it
said.

<TEXT>
   The sister of kidnapped American
journalist Terry Anderson pleaded for his release in a letter
addressed to his captors and published today, a day after his 42nd
birthday.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, marked his fifth birthday in captivity. Kidnapped March 16,
1985, he is the longest-held of the 18 Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Three Beirut newspapers published Arabic translations of the
letter from Peggy Say, Anderson's sister. On Friday, she had
addressed a separate birthday letter to her brother.
   Anderson and American educator Thomas Sutherland, 57, of Fort
Collins, Colo., are held by the shadowy pro-Iranian group Islamic
Jihad, or holy war.
   The group has repeatedly offered to swap the two Americans for
15 Shiite Moslems held in Kuwait on charges they set off a series
of explosions there in December 1983 at the U.S. and French
embassies and other installations.
   Mrs. Say, who has led a crusade to win her brother's release,
pleaded with the captors for evidence that he is still alive.
   ``I beg you to release him. If you will not do so, give him love
and birthday greetings from his family and friends. Allow him to
give us the gift of a message on his birthday, either by letter or
by videotape,'' Mrs. Say wrote.
   The Arabic translation of the letter was published by An-Nida,
an organ of the Lebanese Communist Party, by the pro-Syrian daily
Ash-Sharq and by the conservative newspaper Ad-Diyar.
   An-Nida published a picture of Anderson's 4-year-old daughter
Sulome, born three months after his abduction. Beirut's three
television stations screened a videotape after their evening
newscasts Friday showing Sulome singing ``Happy Birthday'' and her
mother, Madeleine, reading a message to Anderson while the screen
filled with his picture.
   In addition to Anderson and Sutherland, the foreign hostages in
Lebanon are six other Americans, four Britons, two West Germans,
two Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman.

<TEXT>
   Israel uses violence and torture to oppress
Palestinians, a former Norwegian ambassador to Tel Aviv said in an
interview published today.
   Torleiv Anda, 68, retired from diplomatic service last summer
after having served in Israel since 1984.
   ``Little by little, I had to turn completely around in my
conceptions about Israel and its form of democracy,'' the Oslo
newspaper Aftenposten quoted Anda as saying in an interview.
   Aftenposten said Anda would publish a book in two weeks' time
entitled ``Intefadeh. Revolt Against Israel,'' in which he
criticizes Israeli policy and occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   ``If I was asked about my main reason for having lost so much
belief in Israeli democracy,'' Anda said, ``I would have to say it
is the question of punishment forms and the judicial system. The
incomprehensible and unappreciative corruption in the
administration of justice has discredited itself far beyond
Israel's borders.''
   Anda also said his attitude to the PLO has changed:
   ``When I came to Israel, I had a quite banal and vulgar
conception of the Palestine Liberation Organization as being a
terrorist organization. But gradually I discovered that PLO
consists of a lot of clever and very honest people.''
   He said there is no other alternative to the PLO in the occupied
territories and that the group must be dealt with in any peace
negotiations. Israel refuses to negotiate with the PLO because it
considers the group a terrorist organization.
   Since taking over power two weeks ago, Norway's new
non-socialist government of Jan P. Syse has signaled it would place
more critical demands on the PLO and give stronger emphasis to
Israel's right to secure and recognized borders.
   Foreign Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik last week refused to meet
with PLO representatives attending the annual convention of
Landsorganisasjonen, the Confederation of Norwegian Trade Unions.

   Suspected leftist guerrillas attacked two
police posts in this Andean city, killing two officers and wounding
13 other people, police said.
   The rebels set off a car bomb and fired machine guns at a
downtown police station Friday night and threw dynamite at and
fired on a nearby office of a detective unit, police said.
   Other explosions occurred at the same time in different parts of
the city, a police spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Police attributed the attacks to Shining Path rebels, who have
initiated a wave of violence over the last few weeks in an attempt
to sabotage the nationwide municipal elections scheduled for Nov.
12.
   The attacks began as a Roman Cathlic church next door to the
police station was celebrating a Mass commemorating the Lord of
Miracles celebration, a traditional Peruvian religious festival
held each year in October.
   Police told The Associated Press nine people attending the
service were among the wounded, but it wasn't known if they were
injured by the explosion or by the subsequent gunfire.
   Two policemen on duty at the police station were also wounded.
   Two policemen were killed and two civilians were wounded in the
attack on the police detectives' office a few blocks away.
   Police said the casualty figure was not definite. Three hours
after the attack shots were still heard in different parts of the
city.
   The Shining Path has been battling Peru's elected government
since 1980, when it launched its insurgency in the mountains near
Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima.
   The government says more than 15,000 people have died in the
violence, including police, soldiers, rebels, government officials
and civilians.

   When the two trains pulled into Dublin's Connolly Station, they

because of mechanical.
   The only sign of opposition was at the Newry station in County
Down near the border, where followers of Sinn Fein, the Irish
Republican Army's legal political wing, carried banners calling for
British withdrawal from Northern Ireland.
   The almost exclusively Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to push
the British out of Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, join it
with the Republic of Ireland and set up an all-Ireland socialist
state.
   Rail passengers planned to distribute leaflets in Dublin
demanding an end to the bombings of the rail line. They were then
to make the 100-mile return trip to Belfast where a similar protest
was scheduled.
   One of the Irish politicians on the train, Workers' Party leader
Proinsias De Rossa, called for the organizing committee to remain
in existence and become ``a broadly based campaign for peace in
Ireland.''
   He said the unprecedented response to the idea _ with well over
1,000 people looking for places on the trains at one stage --
showed there was a huge number of people in the north and south
anxious to take a public stand for peace and against terrorism.
   ``The `peace train' concept has brought together people of
different political opinions from all walks of life, north and
south. I am sure the vast majority would also be prepared to
support a more general demand for peace and an end to the killing
and destruction,'' he said.
   Train service between the two cities has been disrupted more
than 60 times this year because of bombs and bomb hoaxes, causing a
sharp drop in the number of passengers and threatening the future
of the line, organizers said.
   ``People right across the community are making a point and the
point is this _ that this railway link between north and south must
be kept open. It is vital to our island,'' said Bishop Samuel Ponyz
of the Protestant Church of Ireland, who saw the demonstrators off
in Belfast.
   Bishop Cahal Daly, a Roman Catholic leader in Northern Ireland
who joined him at Belfast station, added: ``This is a message the
IRA cannot refuse to hear, because it is coming from working and
middle class people, young and old, who are not going to allow
communication in this island to be stopped.''
   Dr. Chris McGimpsey, secretary of the organizers and a member of
the East Belfast Unionist Association, said hundreds of people had
to be turned away because the trains were full. Seats were free but
tickets were needed.
   ``All we are doing is making a peaceful point,'' he said. ``We
just want the IRA to stop blowing up the line.''

<HEAD>Former Premier Suzuki to Retire from Politics</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki will not run for
re-election to Parliament, an aide said today, making him the third
ex-premier planning to clear the way for younger leaders in the
troubled governing party.
   Suzuki, prime minister for the Liberal Democratic Party between
1980 and 1982, said he would retire from politics when his term
expires next summer, said Kazuhiko Hiraga, a spokesman for Suzuki's
election committee in Morioka, in northern Japan.
   Suzuki, 78, will make an official announcement at a news
conference after the election committee's regular meeting Sunday,
Hiraga told The Associated Press.
   ``To us, (Mr. Suzuki's) decision came out of the blue,'' Hiraga
said.
   Earlier this year, Kakuei Tanaka, 71, and Takeo Fukuda, 84, said
they also will not run again and will leave their seats in the
powerful lower house of Parliament next summer.
   Suzuki told the NHK broadcasting network he believes the two
``decided to resign as a younger generation of politicians has
become active and it's time for senior people to retire.
   ``I strongly feel a big wave of change coming with the new
generation,'' said Suzuki, whose party has been dogged by a series
of sex and influence-peddling scandals for more than a year.
   Fukuda told Kyodo News Service he was surprised by Suzuki's
decision and said he hoped Suzuki would remain active in politics
even though he would not be in office.
   Hiraga said reactions from Suzuki's local election committee
were varied. ``Some say it's disappointing to see Mr. Suzuki leave,
while others say it's about time.''
   The Cabinet of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Japan's third
premier this year, was only a few months ago considered a
transitional government to smooth over the rocky political fortunes
of the Liberal Democrats.
   Recent opinion polls show Kaifu, who at 58 is considerably more
youthful than most party leaders, gaining in popularity among
voters, partially due to his planned revisions of an unpopular 3
percent sales tax.
   Suzuki became prime minister in July 1980, after the sudden
death of Prime Minister Masayohi Ohira. He resigned in November
1982 after a series of unpopular political moves, including a
decision to freeze a pay raise for the country's 500,000 public
servants.
   Fukuda left office in 1978 and Tanaka in 1974. Tanaka's exit was
prompted, though not forced, by a Lockheed payoff scandal, while
Fukuda was suffering a drop in popularity due to economic recession.

   Rescuers recovered five bodies overnight
from the fire-swept debris of the Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics
plant, a spokesman said today.
   Twelve bodies have been found and removed, said Phillips
spokesman Jere Smith, and the search is continuing for 10 other
missing employees presumed dead in Monday's blast, which leveled
the plant and injured 124 people.
   Crews have been focusing on removing rubble from the plant's
fire-gutted control room.
   ``That's where we anticipate hoping to find a majority of the
people who are unaccounted for,'' said another Phillips spokesman,
Don Kremer.
   Much of the control room, where two bodies were found Thursday,
remains buried beneath tons of debris that fell from a caved-in
polyethylene finishing building.
   ``It is just amazing to see the amount of debris workers are
having to dig through,'' said Kremer. ``But we are continuing to
work around the clock to find all the unaccounted for employees.
And we will continue to work around the clock until we account for
all our employees and contract employees.''
   The company believes flammable hydrocarbon vapor from ethylene
and isobutane gases escaped from a leaking chemical reactor,
triggering the series of explosions that rocked the plant. But
Phillips officials have said they don't know how the gases were
ignited.
   The plant accounts for nearly 20 percent of the nation's
production of plastic pellets used in the manufacture of milk jugs
and grocery bags.
   A memorial service is planned Monday for the 22 dead and missing
workers, organized by Phillips, the city and the Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Workers Local 4-227.

   An elderly California couple was killed in
a fall from a moving Amtrak train today, authorities said.
   Investigators were trying to determine the events that led to
the deaths of Arthur Kohfeld, 87, and his wife, Dorthea, 76, of
Reedley, Calif., near Middle Point in northwest Ohio, the Van Wert
County Sheriff's Department said.
   The Kohfelds had boarded the daily, overnight long distance
train in Chicago, said Pat Duricka of Amtrak's public affairs
office in Washington, D.C.
   There were 157 passengers on board The Broadway Limited, which
was eastbound for New York via Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.
   The train was traveling at 70 mph when the incident occurred
about 1:30 a.m., authorities said.
   Dorthea Kohfeld was dead at the scene. Arthur Kohfeld survived
the fall, but was pronounced dead upon arrival at Van Wert County
hospital, authorities said.
   ``There was ... a witness to the incident who will be
interviewed by the Amtrak police,'' said Ms. Duricka. She said the
witness had tried unsuccessfully to restrain Ms. Kohfeld.
   ``We really have no idea at this point what happened. Once the
witness is interviewed we may have a little better idea,'' Ms.
Duricka said.

   Organizers say threats of an
attack by white extremists will not stop Sunday's rally for freed
leaders of the outlawed African National Congress.
   The rally will go ahead ``despite threats from the faceless
right-wingers,'' said Cyril Ramaphosa, a union leader who is one of
the main organizers. ``We appeal to our people to conduct
themselves in a highly disciplined fashion to avoid any form of
provocation.''
   Elsewhere Saturday, several hundred blacks staged an
anti-government march in Pretoria and about 30 black and mixed-race
teachers and students read for two hours in a ``whites-only''
public library in Boksburg, east of Johannesburg.
   But two planned protest marches in other towns failed to
materialize after magistrates banned them and police cordoned off
assembly points.
   Police officials have confirmed they were aware of anonymous
threats by right-wing whites to shoot at blacks during the rally
Sunday in hopes of provoking a bloodbath. The officials said steps
would be taken to prevent any attack.
   Organizers hope to draw at least 80,000 people to the rally at a
soccer stadium between Johannesburg and Soweto for what could be
the largest anti-government gathering ever in South Africa.
   There are plans to use about 300 buses to bring supporters of
the outlawed African National Congress to the rally from
communities across the country.
   Organizers said no spectators will be allowed on the playing
field of the stadium. Seven hundred security marshals recruited
from anti-apartheid organizations are to screen people as they pass
through entrance gates to the stands.
   Seven of the eight men to be honored were freed unconditionally
on Oct. 15 and the other was released in November 1987. Six were
sentenced to life imprisonment at a 1964 treason trial along with
Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress' best-known leader,
who remains jailed.
   The keynote speech, expected to outline the main components of
current African National Congress policy, is to be given by Walter
Sisulu. He is a close colleague of Mandela's and was the congress'
general secretary when arrested in 1963.
   The organization has been outlawed since 1960, a year before it
began a sabotage and bombing campaign against the white minority
government.
   It is illegal in South Africa to promote the aims of the
organization, but government officials have indicated that police
will not interfere with the rally unless disturbances occur.
   Since mid-September, the government has allowed numerous protest
marches nationwide, organized by trade unions and other
anti-apartheid groups.
   However, a magistrate banned a protest march which black trade
unions had planned for Saturday in Vereeniging, an industrial city
south of Johannesburg. Small groups of workers assembled at various
points in the city, and there were unconfirmed reports that eight
were arrested, but the march did not materialize.

   A killer whale appears to have flipped
for a Norwegian ferry, enchanting passengers and most of Norway as
it tries to court the lumbering vessel.
   For 10 days, the 13-foot-long killer whale has hugged the side
of the Voksa, a 150-foot car and passenger ferry, on its
glamourless route to island villages that freckle the west coast of
Norway.
   Norwegian newspapers widely reported the black-and-white sea
mammal's infatuation with the black-and-white ferry.
   Although the whale has been making all the advances, a Voksa
crewman said, ``It's hard to say who fell in love with whom.''
   The crew claims the whale enjoys showing off for people. They
named it Hanna, despite questions of its gender.
   Kjell Nystoeyl, the Voksa's 35-year-old captain, said Hanna
probably lost her flock, seen in the area about a month ago.
   ``There must be some vibration from the ship's hull that she
finds comforting,'' he said.
   Sea mammal expert Karl Inne Ugland of the University of Oslo
said the whale is lonely and wants company because it has a strong
flock instinct. He said it is probably a young female, about 7
years old.
   Killer whales, actually large dolphins, are intelligent and
Hanna knows she is being watched by people aboard the ferry, Ugland
said.
   In port, the whale gently bumps and rubs herself against the
Voksa's cold steel hull. She rolls over lazily to allow streams of
water pumped from the ship's side to shower her white belly.
   Hanna lolls in the bubbly backwash of the ship's propellers,
waiting up to half an hour for it to load passengers and cars. The
whale peers up at downturned faces, showing her teeth, which causes
many passengers to smile back.
   The unlikely pair has drawn crowds at each of the four stops on
the ferry's 12-mile-long route in the beautiful and remote fiord
south of the town of Aalesund.
   ``She's really putting on a show for you today,'' crewman
Bjoernar Hal Kjellsvik told a reporter.
   Passengers endured icy wind to spend hours leaning over the
ship's side, watching the antics. Some drove eight or nine hours on
treacherous mountain roads to see Hanna. Teachers suspended classes
so schoolchildren could ride the ferry.
   ``She's like the ferry's guardian angel. When she is around
nothing bad could happen to the Voksa,'' said passenger Gerd
Ristesund.
   The whale dives deep under the white foam of Voksa's wake as it
clips along at 14 mph, then erupts inches from the boat, splashing
delighted passengers. She has logged about 745 miles a week at
Voksa's side, Nystoeyl said.
   The killer whale and the boat had to adjust to each other. At
first, Hanna was wary of shallow harbors and disrupted the Voksa's
timetable.
   ``The first few days we were delayed because we were afraid to
hit her and because so many people came to see her,'' said Nystoeyl.
   The worst thing about the whale is getting people to pay for
their tickets, said Kjellsvik.
   ``I have to shout at people to get their attention because they
are all leaning over the railing to watch her,'' said Kjellsvik.
   Hanna snubs handouts. She has refused fish offered by the crew
and is believed to hunt while the ship is docked at night.
   During a break, the Voksa captain tried to give the whale a
backrub with a stiff broom. The whale kept its distance but
Nystoeyl said, ``She'll get used to it.''
   The crew worries that Hanna might grow bored with the ferry and
jilt the boat for a flock of real killer whales.
   ``The first question every crewman asks when they come aboard is
`Have you seen her today?''' said machinist Olav Vestnes.
   Mammal expert Ugland said the whale will probably leave the
fiord this winter. ``If she's still there in April, she'll probably
stick with the boat for a long time,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Czechs striving for democracy may
look to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev as a force for change,
but in the twisting alleys and elegant squares of old Prague, the
name ``Masaryk'' still rings clear.
   Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, philosopher, dreamer, politician, orator
and ``liberator'' of Czechoslovakia in 1918, symbolizes Czech
yearnings for democracy. He was instrumental in forming the
republic in 1918. It existed for 20 years as an independent country
until the Munich Pact opened the way for Hitler to take over.
   His son, Jan Masaryk, was the radio voice of Czechoslovakia from
London during the dark days of Nazi rule. He had become the
Czechoslovak foreign minister when the Communists seized power in
1948 and died a few days after the takeover in a mysterious fall
from the window of his apartment in the Foreign Ministry.
   The names of the father, who died in 1937, and the son have a
mystical pull on Czechoslovaks. The Masaryks, decades after their
deaths, also are a problem for the Communists
   In ``the lies and half-truths that surround us ... it is
necessary to recall Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, who as a politician
embodied an unambiguously moral standpoint,'' an unofficial youth
group, the Independent Peace Association, noted recently in a
typical show of popular respect.
   During Maxaryk's presidency from 1918 to 1935, the youths
declared, ``Czechoslovak society was free to use democratic
institutions as never before and never since.''
   Despite decades of Communist schooling that paid little or no
heed to the Masaryks, most Czechs revere Masaryk as a leader of
impeccable morals, education and eloquence.
   By contrast, they laughed in ridicule recently listening to
black-market tapes of current Communist leader Milos Jakes speaking
incoherently to fellow comrades.
   In the heady ``Prague Spring'' of 1968, the Masaryks were
honored as a source of inspiration for the democratic reforms then
sweeping the country.
   Demanding an investigation into Jan's mysterious death,
thousands of students made pilgrimages to Lany, a village 30 miles
west of Prague, and the family graves.
   Masaryk maintained a country residence in Lany that is now
occupied by President Gustav Husak. In the village cemetery,
Masaryk, his American wife Charlotte, and Jan lie buried beneath a
simple slab of polished granite.
   During the ``Prague Spring,'' there was a revival of official
interest in Masaryk and minor officials paid tribute at the Lany
grave.
   With reform again in the air 20 years later, low-ranking
officials have returned to the Lany cemetery.
   In hurried ceremonies last year and this, they laid wreaths on
Masaryk's to mark the Oct. 28 anniversary of the proclamation of
the republic and again designated the day a public holiday.
   The low rank of the officials and the brevity of the ceremonies
testified to the Communists' continuing unease about Masaryk.
   Aware of the standing of ``Taticek,'' or ``daddy,'' as Masaryk
is popularly known, the government is beginning to accord him a
role in the official version of national history.
   ``Masaryk was undoubtedly the most important politician we ever
had,'' said Josef Harma, a leading official historian. ``Today, we
are trying to rectify the deformed picture put in the minds of our
people in the 1950s or later than that.''
   ``But,'' he added swiftly, ``in this process, we don't want to
go to the other extreme and create another Masaryk myth.''
   Official praise in state-run media and school textbooks is still
tentative.
   But at the American Embassy in Prague there is an annual
outpouring of respect for Masaryk. Each Oct. 28, hundreds of
Czechs, many of them elderly, gather around a plaque to Masaryk.
   Anthems are sung, poems recited and heads bowed in memory of
Masaryk, a staunch friend of the United States.
   Two regulars at the ritual are Masaryk's only surviving
relatives in Prague, his granddaughters Anna and Herberta.
   They are also among the leading lights of an unofficial Masaryk
Society that counts prominent dissident Vaclav Havel among its
supporters.
   Despite their tribulations in the Stalinist 1950s because of
their name, Anna and Herberta Masarykovna, now in their late 70s,
preserve the fondest memories of ``Taticek'' and of the affluent
1930s when Prague was a center of civilization for all Europe.
   More robust than the English dowagers they resemble in bearing
and fondness for gardening, tea, biscuits and homemade jam, they
reminisce in Anna's apartment, a mini-Masaryk museum at the top of
one of the innumerable twisting staircases of Prague's magical Mala
Strana district.
   ``Of course, he does play a role and his standing is better and
better every day,'' Herberta Masarykova says of her grandfather.
``But it's difficult to say what people know.''
   ``Terribly little,'' adds her sister.

<TEXT>
   Vishwanath Pratap Singh is called king
in Manda, the lonely north India domain he inherited from his
father. But Singh has his sights on a larger kingdom.
   The 58-year-old politician has emerged as Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi's main challenger in next month's general election and as
the rallying point of hopes to replace the government that has
dominated India for most of its 42 years of independence.
   Singh is attempting to galvanize a coalition of opposition
parties that span the ideological spectrum, from Communists to
right-wing ethnic parties, to oust the man he once called his
friend.
   But the groups, collectively known as the National Front, are
plagued by highly publicized feuds and have little in common except
their opposition to Gandhi and his Congress Party.
   A month ago a unified opposition seemed possible as Hindu
activists joined ardent Communists in mass demonstrations against
the government. But recent outbreaks of Hindu-Moslem violence
around India have led the Communists and some centrists to question
the viability of a broad opposition alliance.
   It is hard to predict how, if at all, India's social, economic
and foreign policies would change if power switched from a Congress
to an opposition government in voting Nov. 22, 24 and 26.
   The National Front's platform, apart from accusing the Gandhi
government of tolerating corruption, makes no radical departures
from the goals outlined by Congress Party governments. Both sides
speak of easing poverty and strife in this ethnically and
linguistically diverse country of 880 million people.
   Except for accusing the government of corruption, Singh has
voiced few opinions.
   Political analysts say Singh changes his ideological color so
often and with such deftness that it has become almost impossible
to put him in a definite category.
   He has been nicknamed the ``Mr. Clean'' of Indian politics. But
he also has been called a fraud and villified by numerous people,
including former allies in the top ranks of the government.
   ``V.P. Singh is a cobra. He was fed on the milk of the Congress
Party and now he is injecting poison into the Congress Party,''
said a Congress Party leader, Kalpnath Rai. ``He should be hanged
for treachery.''
   Singh, a balding, bespectacled man with a Charlie Chaplin-like
mustache, is aware of the importance of image but opposes
personality politics.
   ``I have always taken the stand that we have to shift from
personal appeal to issues,'' he said. ``This is the way a democracy
matures and it's the issues which are agitating the peoples'
minds.''
   ``The biggest issue is the feeling that the people have been
tremendously let down by the present regime and there is rampant
corruption at the top,'' he said.
   When Singh was 5, his biological father, the Rajah (king) of
Daiya gave him to the Rajah of Manda, who was childless. He grew up
in one of the most palatial outposts in Uttar Pradesh state and was
the sole heir to the estate when his adoptive father died six years
later.
   Not allowed to see real family for years, the shy young Singh
turned to poetry and painting.
   Prime Minister Indira Gandhi outlawed royal titles in the early
1970s, but people in Manda still call Singh the rajah.
   While in college, Singh became interested in politics and
eventually joined the Congress Party. In 1974, Mrs. Gandhi named
him a deputy minister of commerce and two years later promoted him
to minister of state for commerce. He served there until Mrs.
Gandhi was ousted in the 1977 parliamentary election that installed
India's only non-Congress government since the country gained
independence from Britain in 1947.
   When she was brought back to power after the opposition
government disintegrated in 1979, Singh was inducted into her
Cabinet as commerce minister.
   After Mrs. Gandhi's assassination in 1984, her son succeeded her
and picked Singh as one of the ``whiz kids'' who would lead the
world's most populous democracy into the 21st century. Singh became
a champion of political morality, a campaign for which he was
sacked as finance minister and defense minister and then expelled
from the Congress Party two years later.
   Although he made a great show of renouncing political office, he
was embraced by the opposition, former Congress Party members who
bitterly opposed Mrs. Gandhi and later her son. Today, the
opposition, at least for the moment, has accepted Singh as its
leader. His protestions about shunning positions of power have been
set aside.
   The opposition's battle cry has been a controversial Indian
government contract to buy $1.4 billion worth of artillery from the
Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors. Indian newspapers have alleged
that Bofors paid middlemen up to $50 million in kickbacks to secure
the 1986 contract.
   The deal was negotiated by the prime ministers of the two
countries and was supposed to be free of commissions and agents'
fees.
   No one has been charged with any crime, but the scandal has
tarnished Gandhi's image. Many statements issued by the government
in Parliament have been proved wrong by documents uncovered by The
Hindu and other newspapers.
   The scandal, which has faded and flared intermittently, was
propelled back to the front pages recently, spurring Gandhi to call
elections nearly two months before the Jan. 14, 1990 deadline.
   Most analysts say the average Indian voter has been numbed by
charges of high-level corruption and is more concerned about
unemployment and rising prices.
   ``I am not saying that corruption is a new thing or that there
was no corruption before Rajiv Gandhi's time,'' Singh said. ``Big
money always has been close to politics.
   ``But there was a difference. The moneybags might have funded
politics, but they could not influence decisions. Politicians were
like charioteers and big money was the horse pulling the chariot.
Now Rajiv Gandhi has become the horse and big business has climbed
into the charioteer's seat.''

<HEAD>Iraq Says Iran Attacked Iraqi Tug, Killing Crewman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After more than a year of relative peace,
Iraq on Saturday accused Iran of attacking one of its tugboats in
the Persian Gulf and killing a crewman. Iran denied it.
   Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit reported the incident
Thursday and also said an Iraqi was killed.
   It was the first report of a naval incident between Iran and
Iraq since a cease-fire in their war took effect Aug. 20, 1988.
There have been only minor reports of cease-fire violations on land.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said the report was contained in
a protest letter that its U.N. representative gave to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar in New York.
   The letter said Iran will be held responsible for the results of
the attack, INA said. It did not elaborate.
   Iraq has said in the past that any shot fired on an Iraqi vessel
would be considered a serious violation of the cease-fire, which
ended eight years of war between the neighboring countries.
   In its letter to Perez de Cuellar, Iraq said two Iranian
gunboats attacked the tugboat Al-Intisar on Wednesday morning close
to the Iraqi offshore oil terminal of Mina al-Bakr.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted navy
commander Rear Adm. Mohammad Hussein Malekzadegan as saying:
``Iranian forces have not been engaged in any encounter in the
Persian Gulf.''
   ``It is possible that the clash took place between two foreign
forces stationed in the Persian Gulf, and that the foreign media
have wrongly taken one of them as the Iranians,'' he said in the
report also monitored in Cyprus.
   Malekzadegan's comments came before Iraq made its public
accusation.
   Iranian reports at the time of the reported incident said Iran
was conducting naval maneuvers in the gulf but did not specify
where.
   Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit said Thursday that two
Iranian gunboats fired at the tug.
   It said an Iraqi was killed in the incident, which it said took
place Wednesday in the Persian Gulf off Iraq, about 30 miles from
the port of Faw.

<HEAD>Government Secrets Locked in Computers Difficult to Dislodge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congress and the Bush administration are
struggling to write new rules governing citizen access to
government information, amid growing fear that the computer is
becoming an engine for official secrecy.
   Current practices could turn ordinary citizens and volunteer
organizations into ``information peasants'' while well-financed
government, business, science and media interests become ``lords of
the information age,'' says Columbia University political scientist
Alan F. Westin.
   A survey Westin conducted of nearly 300 research and lobbying
groups concludes that ``they were better off in locating and
obtaining federal public information in the 1970s'' than they are
now.
   The Justice Department, meanwhile, is conducting the first
survey of how federal agencies release electronic data to citizens
under the Freedom of Information Act. Preliminary analysis shows
that agencies adopt a more restrictive rather than a more open view
of their obligations by a 3-1 margin.
   This situation has emerged after a decade in which federal
computer use has exploded. The government owned a few thousand
microcomputers in 1980; next year, its inventory should reach 1
million.
   With limited public awareness that the problem even exists,
lobbyists, officials and legislators in this city have been
advancing rapidly toward far-reaching decisions.
   Negotiations are under way to revise a bill submitted last May
by Rep. Bob Wise, D-W.Va., chairman of the House government
information subcommittee. If enacted, the bill would present the
first declaration by Congress that government has an affirmative
obligation to distribute its electronic information to citizens in
a form they can use and at a price they can pay.
   If warring interest groups can agree on issues like how much
power to give the Office of Management and Budget, the bill might
reach the House floor as early as January.
   Without warning last June, OMB announced plans to reverse a
much-criticized policy it had issued during the Reagan
administration in 1985.
   The Reagan policy, still in effect as OMB Circular A-130,
forbids federal agencies from developing any electronic information
system that duplicates those available in the private sector and
requires them to rely on private industry to disseminate government
information. In June, OMB said it was ready to adopt many of the
principles of Wise's bill, including encouragement of a diversity
of private and government distribution systems.
   So shocked was one watchdog group, OMB Watch, that its
newsletter headlined the story: ``Hunger Ends, World Declares
Peace, and OMB Announces Reform Movement.''
   At the end of November, the Justice Department's Office of
Information and Privacy will gather all the government's Freedom of
Information officers to try to develop uniform policy on a range of
issues, such as whether citizens can obtain the software or
programming used by the government to analyze data on its computers.
   Down the road are other issues, some of which have already
generated lawsuits, like one over whether citizens can use the
Freedom of Information Act to read the electronic mail that
officials send to each other's desktop computers.
   Last week about 70 of the interested parties _ Justice and OMB
officials, legislators and their staff, public interest and
information industry lobbyists and lawyers, librarians and academic
researchers _ were brought together for a two-day conference by the
Benton Foundation and the Bauman Family Foundation.
   Their discussions made clear that those seeking electronic data
from the government face serious obstacles in the way federal
agencies interpret the Freedom of Information Act. A number of
problems have involved a provision that agencies need not create a
new record to respond to requests.
   The phrase ``create a record'' was drafted when nearly all
government information was on paper. Computer specialists say it
has little meaning in describing how to extract information from a
computer.
   Quin Shea of the National Security Archive, a Washington group
that collects government documents for researchers and news
reporters, cited a case involving the Energy Department. Asked in
an FOIA request for a list of limited-access technical reports, it
said no such list existed _ even though all the titles were
compiled in a computer.
   The agency argued that its computer program matched names of
eligible requesters with titles they were allowed to see, but that
asking for a complete list would amount to creating a new record.
   The department's appeals office eventually overruled that
decision, but only after several exchanges with the archive, which
has proven its willingness to go to court and has the expertise of
Shea, a former top Freedom of Information official at Justice.
   Patti Goldman, a lawyer for Public Citizen Litigation Group,
argued that no new legislation is needed, because courts have so
far been applying the Freedom of Information Act to electronic
data. ``The rush to amend the act is premature,'' she said.
   But the conference organizer, Jerry Berman, head of the American
Civil Liberties Union's information technology project, argued that
courts ``took 40 years to figure out that wiretapping violates the
Constitution. And there's no guarantee all the rulings will come
out right.''
   Further, he argued that court cases could pit impoverished
public interest groups against well-financed private interests.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate subcommittee
that oversees FOIA, told the group, ``I'm very hesitant to open up
FOIA again unless there is a consensus'' among the various
interests at the conference. He said some members of Congress still
would like to gut the original Freedom of Information Act.
   Former Leahy aide John Podesta argued that such a consensus
should form around legislation to extend citizen access to
electronic records. Noting that in this Congress three agencies
have sought exemptions from the existing act, Podesta said, ``If
the only proposals are on the bad side, then only bad things will
get passed.''
   But the Wise bill is showing that federal information users
agree more easily on problems than solutions.
   Conference participants agreed on the need for standardized
computer formats and a list of government databases. But those
provisions have been dropped from Wise's bill, because the American
Library Association and some other groups worried they would
entrust too much power to the Office of Management and Budget.

<HEAD>Ethiopian Rebels Agree to Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major Ethiopian rebel group said
Saturday it has agreed to open preliminary peace talks with the
government.
   The Tigre People's Liberation Front, which launched a new
military offensive in late August, said the talks would begin in
Rome on Nov. 4 and be observed by representatives of the Italian
government.
   The Tigrean rebels, who describe their ongoing offensive as a
pre-emptive strike against mobilizing government forces, announced
their agreement in a telex to The Associated Press' Nairobi office.
   ``The TPLF has always stood for peace and a peaceful solution,''
the message said. ``This agreement to hold talks is a clear proof
of its principled and firm stand on peace.''
   The rebel group pushed the government out of Tigre province in
February, and there was a lull in fighting until August, when the
rebels pushed south into neighboring Wollo province.
   Last week, the insurgents claimed to have captured the town of
Mekane Selam, 100 miles north of the capital of Addis Ababa.
   That would mark their deepest penetration toward the capital in
their 15-year-old war to overthrow the government of President
Mengistu Haile Mariam.
   The government also is scheduled to resume peace talks with
another major rebel movement, the Eritrean People's Liberation
Front, in Nairobi next month. Those talks began in Atlanta, Ga., in
September, withformer President Jimmy Carter as an observer.
   The Eritrean rebels have been fighting a war of secession for 28
years in Ethiopia's northernmost province. The two rebel forces
have in the past combined efforts on the battlefield.

   About 200 Soviets will be in town this week to
sample capitalism at the local mall, mingle with Americans in their
homes and grapple with issues such as arms control at an
international conference.
   All but about 50 of the Soviets will stay with families for a
week as they attend the Fifth General Chautauqua Conference on
U.S.-Soviet Relations, which features public sessions designed to
encourage a candid exchange between American and Soviet citizens.
   ``These are not closed door think tanks,'' said Daniel Bratton,
president of the Chautauqua Institution, which is co-sponsoring the
conference with the University of Pittsburgh. ``They permit a wide
cut of our citizenry to engage with policy makers from both
countries.''
   American talk show host Phil Donahue will team up with Soviet
radio and television commentator Vladimir Pozner for a ``Citizens
Open Dialogue'' program Monday night.
   Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro and actress
Marlo Thomas will speak on women's issues at the conference, which
runs from Sunday through Friday.
   Other sessions will focus on cooperation in space, problems with
youth, trade, religion and human rights. Headsets will be available
so the audience can listen to simultaneous translations.
   ``This is an attempt to try and understand each other,'' said
Sergei Romanov of Moscow, a conference organizer. ``Culturally,
we're different. Historically, we're different. Socially, we're
different. It's very important to find common ground.''
   The Soviet visitors range from scientists to sanitation workers.
   ``Many of them are going to be here for the first time,''
Romanov said. ``It will be a great opportunity to live with an
American family and discuss whatever they wish.''
   Some of the host families plan to take their visitors to the
schools their children attend or to work, said Marion Hook,
executive director of the Pittsburgh Council for International
Visitors.
   ``One family is talking about taking them to their neighborhood
pumpkin-carving festival,'' she said. ``A lot of them are talking
about taking them to video stores and letting them pick out
movies.''
   The Soviets will have the chance to tour the pantry of a food
bank, talk to counselors at a drug rehabilitation clinic and shop
at a suburban supermarket and upscale mall.
   ``Our aim is to give them a complete view of American life,''
said University of Pittsburgh President Wesley Posvar.
   A high school band will greet the visitors when they arrive for
lunch, a fashion show and a two-hour shopping spree at Ross Park
Mall Wednesday, said mall spokeswoman Deborah Harvison.
   ``I think you're going to see some very heavy shopping. We
understand denim is very hot in the Soviet Union. We let our stores
that carry jeans know they might be very busy,'' Harvison said.
   ``We're providing merchants with the Russian translations of
things like `May I help you?' and `Thank you.' They'll have to wing
it from there,'' she said.
   A classical music performance will feature the Pittsburgh Opera
Theatre, the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre and the Pittsburgh Symphony
along with Soviet musicians and dancers.
   The first Chautauqua conference was held in 1985, when a small
group of officials from Washington and Moscow met for a week at the
historic vacation and cultural center in western New York.
   In 1987, the Soviets brought more than 200 citizens to
Chautauqua. The conference was held last year in Tbilisi in the
Soviet republic of Georgia.

<HEAD>Boosters Fear Park Is Reaching Point of No Return</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Boosters of the Everglades have told
tales of woe for four decades, but deterioration of the ``river of
grass'' now may have reached a point of no return, says a National
Park Service biologist.
   Watching the park since 1965, John Ogden has seen rookeries with
10,000 to 20,000 birds disappear and witnessed a general decline in
what was once an abundant wildlife sanctuary.
   ``We're just sticking our thumbs in the levee right now,'' he
said last week at a conference that drew 40 Everglades scientists
and their latest research. ``I think most people agree we have come
to a now-or-never stage.''
   The litany of problems seems to grow longer with each new study.
   Human intervention in the form of urban development, farming,
drainage, flood control, firefighting and the introduction of hardy
exotic plants has cut the size of the Everglades in half from an
estimated 2.5 million acres in 1900, erased 12 native species and
stressed what remains.
   The Florida panther and wading birds were subjected to the most
intense study, and, as in past years, the news is bad.
   Only a handful of endangered Florida panthers, a close relative
of the cougar, remains in Everglades National Park, but a new study
shows that the dwindling habitat may be able to support only eight
to 10 cats _ apparently too low to make the species biologically
viable.
   Water policies favoring farmers and urban dwellers have forced
wading birds to relocate their colonies and cut the population in
the southern Everglades from 300,000 to 15,000.
   Rick Smith of the governor's office told the 6th Everglades
symposium that $163 million has been spent by the state since
then-Gov. Bob Graham declared the Everglades a top priority in 1983.
   ``Progress is steady, but it's slow and we all need to recognize
that,'' Smith said. The spending ``is no small amount of money, but
it's probably not enough.''
   Federal and state agencies have obtained more than 275,000 acres
in recent years as a buffer zone for the park and are restoring
some of the free-flowing channels that have been lost since the
1940s in the shallow inland wetlands.
   ``There is virtually none of this system left the way it was,''
said Steve Davis, wetlands research coordinator with the South
Florida Water Management District.
   The district mandates water policy for the region but is being
sued by the federal government for delivering polluted water to the
park.
   ``Virtually every square mile of the Everglades is not what it
was in 1900,'' he said, picking the time before settlers made their
mark.
   Solutions revolve around park expansion southwest of Miami,
water delivery to approach the historic natural flow and delivery
of cleaner water, possibly by buying land north of the park to act
as kidneys filtering out unwanted phosphorus and nitrogen.
   The Everglades is a 1.2-million-acre expanse of marsh grasses,
hardwood stands and pine islands, but only about one-third is
within park boundaries on the southern tip of the Florida peninsula.

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Claim To Seize Strategic Highway To Second-Largest City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The communist Khmer Rouge claim to have
seized a strategic stretch of highway leading to Cambodia's
second-largest city, Battambang, after driving back forces of the
Vietnamese-backed government.
   ``The Vietnamese enemy and puppets have been routed from Route
10,'' said a report Friday by Khmer Rouge army radio. The text of
the report was seen in Bangkok on Saturday. ``Their major divisions
and regiments have fled to Battambang and to the east. No one is
defending Route 10.''
   Route 10 links the gem-rich town of Pailin, near the Thai
border, to Battambang, about 40 miles away. The Khmer Rouge on Oct.
22 captured Pailin and said they were pushing northeast to
Battambang, a provincial capital.
   Claims by the Khmer Rouge are widely regarded as exaggerated,
but Thai officials have confirmed the seizure of Pailin.
   In the past, the Cambodian government media quickly countered
Khmer Rouge claims, but they have not commented on Pailin.
Government radio on Friday claimed one division ``strengthened its
foothold'' and recently beat back guerrilla infiltrators, killing
30 of them.
   Battambang is about 50 miles east of the Thai border and 160
miles northwest of the capital, Pnom Penh.
   The capture of Battambang would be the biggest guerrilla victory
of the 11-year-old war.
   The Khmer Rouge is the largest member of the three-party
guerrilla coalition fighting the government Vietnam installed after
invading in 1978 to topple a Khmer Rouge government.
   During the three years the Khmer Rouge ruled the country,
hundreds of thousands of Cambodia's 8 million people died from
executions, famine and civil unrest.
   Vietnam claims it withdrew its last troops from Cambodia in
September, but the guerrillas say it has left behind thousands of
soldiers disguised in Cambodian government units.
   The two non-Communist guerrilla groups, the Khmer People's
National Liberation Front and the forces of Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, have made significant advances north of Pailin since the
Vietnamese pullout.
   The Sihanouk forces are advancing on Samrong in Oddar Meanchey
province while the Liberation Front army is heading toward Svey
Chek, the only big town blocking their advance to the military
center of Sisophon.

<TEXT>
   Duke Ellington, not one to take public positions
on politics or politicians, spoke through his music. With the help
of his son and his orchestra, Ellington's melodic voice will be
heard again.
   The platform is a benefit Sunday for the Schomburg Center for
Research in Black Culture, the culmination of a year-long
celebration of Ellington's 90th birthday April 29.
   Ellington's son, Mercer, granddaughters Mercedes Ellington, the
choreographer, and Gaye Ellington, pianist Billy Taylor and tap
dancer Honi Coles were among those scheduled to join the tribute at
the Shubert Theater.
   ``I feel that people didn't realize how much of a message he
left in his works. We're going to put it right in front of them and
tell it like it is,'' said Mercer Ellington, 70.
   ``The only way you got to know Duke Ellington was not to know
him but to know his music.''
   Edward Kennedy Ellington died in 1974 after casting his ``Black,
Brown and Beige'' spell upon the globe for nearly 50 years. His
output _ much of it scratched onto napkins, envelopes and scraps of
paper tucked in his pockets _ added much to the books of opera,
Broadway, church music, film scoring and, of course, jazz.
   ``Take the A Train'' (by his collaborator and alter ego Billy
Strayhorn), ``Satin Doll,'' ``A Drum is a Woman,'' ``Mood Indigo,''
``Sophisticated Ladies,'' ``It Don't Mean a Thing if it Ain't Got
that Swing'' and ``In the Beginning God'' are just a few Ellington
standards.
   ``I think he's one of the world's great composers,'' said
Taylor, a Ph.D. in education who is Wilmer D. Barrett professor of
music at the University of Massachusetts and a fellow at Yale
University.
   ``His music reflects the sophistication, the earthiness and the
many other qualities we know about ourselves.''
   Ellington's music was a reflection of the man himself, a man who
supported the Rev. Martin Luther King and other causes but did not
say so publicly, said Mercer Ellington.
   ``Talking to Ellington many times was like talking to your
psychiatrist. He would let you talk on the couch and cure
yourself,'' his son said. ``He was a very hard man to pin down. But
he did make absolute statements.''
   The song ``Money Jungle,'' for example, meant that money was
``eternal grief. Whether you had money or didn't have money, it was
always trouble,'' the younger Ellington said. ``All during the way,
he had money problems. He supported a large family. ... The song
shows the turbulence that was gnawing away at him underneath.''
   ``The Three Black Kings'' of another piece were actually the
Rev. Martin Luther King, King Solomon and one of the kings who
found Christ in the manger.
   ``Take the A Train'' was Ellington's paean to black imagination.
   ``Much of what he represented and believed in was Harlem, that
this was the one (subway) stop that was the greatest. Harlem really
meant black creativity,'' Mercer Ellington said. ``Jazz is like
baseball in the United States and the basic source for it was the
black community.''
   Marian Logan, whose late husband Arthur was Ellington's good
friend and physician, recalled how Ellington, Strayhorn and Logan
got caught in a hotel during a coup in Baghdad, Iraq, in 1963.
   While planes bombed the palace near their hotel, ``Arthur and
Strayhorn were on the roof taking pictures,'' said Mrs. Logan.
``Edward was under the bed writing music.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 10,000 people defied
Communist authorities today and marched in the steets to mark the
71st anniversary of Czechoslovakia, and riot squads swinging batons
moved in to break up the rally.
   Thousands of people converged on Prague's central Wenceslas
Square at 3 p.m., when independent groups had asked them to show up
in a peaceful display of the popular desire for more freedom.
   Cheers went up when banners saying: ``The truth will prevail,''
and ``We will not let the republic be disrupted'' _ a popular
Communist slogan turned on its head by the demonstrators _ appeared
in the crowd.
   The crowd also chanted for Tomas Garrique Masaryk, the
philosopher who founded independent Czechoslovakia in 1918. The
Czechoslovak state came into existence on Oct. 28, 1918, with the
dissolution of Austria-Hungary.
   The Communists consolidated power in 1948, and Czechoslovakia
remains one of the Soviet bloc's most rigidly controlled socialist
states.
   Riot police appeared in side streets about 20 minutes after the
demonstrations began and gradually moved in to disperse the crowd.
   Some people were beaten with police batons as they were led away
to waiting buses dotted amid dozens of yellow-and-white riot police
vans.
   ``We want no violence,'' hundreds of people chanted as they were
penned in by riot police. ``We've got bare hands,'' they shouted
raising their arms to the sky to show police they were unarmed.
   They also demanded free elections and a new government.
   About 90 minutes after the demonstration began, clapping
protesters still intermittently shouted ``freedom'' as police
sought to disperse them.
   More than 2,000 of the demonstrators eventually made their way
to old town square, like Wenceslas square a historic gathering
place for Czechs.
   There they sang the national anthem and chanted more slogans for
freedom before helmeted riot police again moved in to disperse the
crowd.
   The crowd was estimated at between 10,000 and 15,000, marking
the largest anti-government demonstration since August 1988, when
10,000 people marched for more freedom on the 20th anniversary of
the Soviet-led invasion that crushed reform in 1968.
   Authorities had arrested at least 11 dissidents, including
Havel, to prevent them attending the independent rally. But
dissidents said other activists escaped the police dragnet and
hoped to attend the protest.
   Today's march was held shortly after the Communist government
celebrated the anniversary of independence with a military parade
in Wenceslas Square. About 1,500 soldiers stood at attention as
Defense Minister Gen. Milan Vaclavik instructed them to swear
allegiance to their socialist homeland.
   In a 15-minute speech, Josef Kempny, head of the
Communist-dominated Czech National Council, emphasized the
importance of preserving Communist rule. He reiterated the
government will not seek dialogue with opposition groups.
   ``There is no sense in debate with those who like to talk, but
who oppose February 1948, and are against socialism, who care only
for the return of capitalism and who try to distract our honest
workers from their work and to create chaos,'' Kempny said.
   His speech drew only scant applause from an estimated 3,000
Czechoslovaks who received special cards to pass through police
cordons and metal barriers for the ceremony.
   Most attending appeared to be relatives of the soldiers, who
concluded the ceremony marching past Kempny, Vaclavik, Prague party
boss Miroslav Stepan and other dignitaries. The officials stood on
a reviewing stand draped in red cloth bearing the legend, ``We
serve the socialist homeland.''
   Two rocket transporters carrying two missiles apiece and two
armored personnel carriers were stationed on the square.
   Last year, 5,000 people rallied on Oct. 28 and were dispersed by
riot police using dogs, a water cannon, tear gas and batons. At
least 87 people were arrested.
   At the U.S. Embassy, Ambassador Shirley Temple Black made a
veiled call for more freedom in Czechoslovakia in a brief speech
before about 250 Czechoslovaks honoring Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, who
founded democratic Czechoslovakia.
   Masaryk is now gradually being accorded a role in national
history after being reviled for decades as a bourgeois capitalist.

seized 440 pounds of the drug and arrested a Colombian believed to
be the leader of a European narcotics distribution ring, the
Interior Ministry said Saturday.
   In a statement, the ministry said authorities also arrested five
other people in the raid on a warehouse in Mejorada del Campo,
about 20 miles east of Madrid.
   It called the laboratory the biggest in Europe. European
authorities have noted a steady rise in cocaine consumption in
recent years.
   The operation came two days after U.S., Spanish, Italian and
French drug officials met in Madrid with representatives of Latin
American cocaine-producing nations to step up efforts to combat
drug trafficking.
   In the raid, narcotics agents found that the drug had been
worked into the fabric of alpaca wool blankets, ponchos and
sweaters and packed in numerous boxes in the warehouse.
   Police also seized about 260 gallons of ether, a chemical used
to transform coca leaf paste into cocaine, and more than 50 bottles
of compounds added to the pure drug to increase its quantity for
street sales.
   Agents surprised two men as they began the chemical process to
remove the cocaine from the blankets and clothing, the ministry
said.
   Police arrested Luis Carlos Martinez Henao of Colombia, the
alleged leader of the organization; and Cuban-born Americans Luis
de la Cruz Ferro, Jose Antonio Reyes-Dupont and Dora Rosa Sanchez.
   Others arrested were Pedro Manuel Tagle Nino of Peru and Caridad
Gabriola Bayolo, believed to be a Colombian. No hometowns were
given.
   Police accused Martinez Henao of running the European
distribution of the shipment.The Interior Ministry said more
arrests were possible.
   Police conservatively estimated the value of the 440 pounds of
cocaine at $8 million, but the street value could be as high as $80
million to $160 million.
   A ministry spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
police believed the laboratory had just been set up.
   In the past, Colombian cocaine traffickers have hidden cocaine
in clothing to make it easier to smuggle the drug into Spain,
mainly for later ground transport to other European countries.
   The investigation that led to the raid included extended
surveillance of Martinez Henao, who had lived in lavish style in
Spain two years, the statement said.
   Police said De la Cruz Ferro and Reyes-Dupont had been in touch
with Martinez Henao in Madrid earlier this year.
   The two traveled to Peru but returned in September, apparently
after having arranged for a shipment of cocaine to Spain, the
statement said.
   Spanish and international drug enforcement agencies have said
Spain is being used as a gateway into Europe by Latin American drug
traffickers.
   But recently, Miguel Solans, head of Spain's National Plan on
Drugs coordination agency, said increased police and customs
efforts have led cocaine smugglers to turn away from Spain and move
more shipments into Europe through ports in the Netherlands,
Britain and West Germany.
   Colombian drug syndicates are believed to supply the vast
majority of cocaine distributed in the United States.
   The Colombian government in August declared war on traffickers.
Drug traffickers in turn have waged an almost daily campaign of
bombings and killings of officials and journalists in an effort to
intimidate the government into ending its crackdown.

<HEAD>Socialist Activist Murdered in Clash with Skinheads</HEAD>

   Skinheads fatally stabbed an activist of
the leftist Socialist Revolutionary Party during clashes early
Saturday outside the party's headquarters, police said.
   Jose Carvalho was stabbed in the chest when a group of 15
skinheads tried to disrupt a concert in the party headquarters,
party member Jaime Pinho said. Carvalho died on the way to a
hospital.
   Pinho, in an interview with Lisbon's independent radio TSF, said
the clashes began after skinheads gathered near the party building
in Lisbon's seedy Intendente area late Friday and began shouting
insults at the activists.
   About 20 members of the Trotskyist party tried to persuade the
skinheads to leave, Pinho said.
   He said the activists recognized some of the skinheads as
members of a neo-Nazi political group. He did not name the group.
   Fighting began at 1.00 a.m. Saturday when the skinheads, armed
with rocks, sticks and iron bars, attacked the building, stabbing
Carvalho and injuring three other party members, the Portuguese
news agency Lusa said.
   A police spokesman, who requested anonymity, said a homicide
squad was investigating the case.
   Activists from the Socialist Revolutionary Party were preparing
for their yearly party congress Saturday.
   The party was formed in the wake of the 1974 revolution that
toppled a 48-year rightist dictatorship in Portugal. It has enjoyed
only minor support in local and general elections.

<HEAD>Indonesia to Stop Oil Price Discount for U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>

   Indonesia will stop providing
discounts on oil exported to the United States starting next month,
an official of the Mines and Energy Ministry was quoted Saturday as
saying.
   Mines and Energy Minister Ginanjar Kartasasmita was quoted by
the official Antara news agency as saying an improved oil market
has prompted the government to stop providing such discounts, which
he called ``distance allowance.''
   The minister did not say whether such discounts are given to any
other buyers.
   Ministry spokesman Hardjoko Seputro said Indonesia exports oil
to the United States at $1 less than the official level of $17.36
per barrel.
   Indonesia exports 100,000 to 200,000 barrels to the United
States every day, making the United States the second-largest buyer
of crude oil from Indonesia. Japan, which imports about 400,000
barrels per day at the official price, is the largest buyer.

   Novelist, poet and playwright Kateb
Yacine, considered one of Algeria's finest contemporary writers,
died in France on Saturday of leukemia, the official news agency
APS reported.
   The news agency said Yacine, 60, died at La Tronche Hospital
near Grenoble, France, where he had gone for treatment of his
illness.
   Yacine, an active supporter of Algeria's war for independence
from France in the 1950s, first became known for his novel
``Nedjma,'' an extended love poem to the title character, a woman
who incarnates the Algerian revolution.
   He wrote novels and poems in French but since 1970 wrote mainly
for the theater in the Algerian dialect of Arabic.
   His best-known play was ``Mohamed, Get Your Suitcase,'' dealing
with large-scale Algerian emigration to France.

   Black candidates whose views and resumes place
them in the political mainstream are breaking new ground as they
seek white support in settings as varied as Tidewater Virginia, the
boroughs of New York and the neighborhoods of Cleveland and New
Haven.
   Leading the way are L. Douglas Wilder, with his strong bid to
make Virginia the first state to elect a black governor, and David
Dinkins, who could become the first black mayor of New York City.
   A former state legislator now in his fourth year as lieutenant
governor of Virginia, Wilder is running as a supporter of the
``fiscally conservative management'' of Democratic Gov. Gerald
Baliles, who cannot succeed himself. His opponent, Republican J.
Marshall Coleman, contends Wilder would take the state back ``to
the days of higher taxes, high interest rates and high inflation.''
   ``What was unthinkable only a couple of years ago has become
inevitable,'' said pollster Ron Lester when asked about the
progress blacks were making attracting white votes. While Wilder
and Dinkins are attracting the most attention in the off-year
elections to be decided Nov. 7, they are not the only candidates
bidding for racial breakthroughs.
   This year's elections also are providing the first electoral
test of the impact of the Supreme Court's recent decision on
abortion.
   Like Virginia, New Jersey is electing a governor and hundreds of
cities from New York, Detroit, Cleveland and Seattle, to some of
the nation's smallest are choosing mayors. In most cases,
incumbents seeking new terms face only token opposition.
   Voters in Virginia and New Jersey also are filling legislative
seats, while in Maine a referendum asks whether people favor
stopping cruise missile tests in the state.
   The race to succeed Republican Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey
is between two House members, Democrat James J. Florio and
Republican James A. Courter.
   While blacks seek new gains in Virginia, New York, Seattle, and
New Haven, Conn., and to build on earlier success in cities like
Detroit and Cleveland, the most prominent black in national
politics, Jesse Jackson, has played a lesser role.
   Jackson has stayed out of Virginia, at Wilder's request.
   ``I think Jesse is an activist,'' said Wilder in an interview.
``I have been involved with compromises _ getting half the loaf
when you couldn't get the whole loaf. I don't want to walk away
empty-handed.''
   Lester, who specializes in polling for minority candidates, said
the new wave of black politicians ``seem to have developed a
particular way of connecting with the electorate. If you look at
most of them, there is something about them that makes them more
acceptable to white folks.''
   ``I think we are certainly seeing a kind of different appeal on
the part of black candidates,'' said Linda Williams, a scholar who
specializes in studying black political trends.
   ``We don't hear the sort of rhetoric of `our time has come,'
instead, we hear black candidates emphasizing their resumes and
also emphasizing they are the people to bring about unity,'' she
said.
   After the Supreme Court ruling last summer that would allow
states to restrict access to abortions, Florio took a strong
position in favor of abortion rights. Courter had earlier said he
would sign legislation outlawing abortion, but then asserted he
would not impose his views on others.
   Courter aides conceded that ``we have had problems'' with the
issue.
   Recently, the New Jersey campaign has grown increasingly nasty
with each candidate portraying the other in television ads as
Pinocchio, his nose growing with each new untruth.
   Despite the savage nature of the New Jersey campaign, it has
drawn less national attention than the Virginia contest between
Wilder and Coleman.
   The grandson of slaves, the 58-year-old Wilder grew up during
the period when Virginia's public facilities were racially
segregated and has urged voters not to ``turn the clock back.''
   Both candidates have avoided making race an overt issue in the
campaign. Coleman said Virginians see their contest ``just as two
candidates running for office.''
   While race is avoided as an issue, abortion has emerged as a
highly charged element in the campaign, and one that appears to
work in favor of Wilder, a supporter of abortion rights.
   Coleman conceded that abortion was an issue that was hurting him
and urged that it ``now should be put to rest.''
   Dinkins held a wide lead over Republican Rudolph Giuliani, a
former U.S. attorney, in early public opinion polls but the contest
tightened dramatically when the Democratic candidate was put on the
defensive by reports he had undervalued stock he sold to his son
and by remarks by Robert C. ``Sonny'' Carson, a black activist who
had worked in the primary campaign.
   Carson said it was wrong to call him anti-semitic, as many have
charged. ``I'm anti-white,'' he said.
   Dinkin's low-key style was considered an advantage when he upset
flamboyant Mayor Ed Koch in the Democratic primary.
   The contest for mayor of Cleveland is between two blacks and the
winner is likely to be the one who attracts the most white votes.
   The Cleveland race has been marked by bitter personal attacks
from both candidates _ City Council President George Forbes and
state Sen. Michael R. White.
   Forbes has called White a ``slum lord,'' while the state senator
has described the council president as a ``master of sleaze.''
Another issue in the race has been allegations _ denied by the
twice-divorced White _ that he beat his first two wives.
   In Seattle, Norm Rice, a city councilman, is given a better
chance of becoming the first black mayor, than Doug Jewett is of
becoming the first Republican elected to the office in 24 years.
   In New Haven, black state Sen. John C. Daniels overwhelmed John
DeStefano Jr. in the Democratic mayoral primary last month, despite
DeStefano's backing from the city's Democratic Party establishment
and the fact the city is about 70 percent white. Daniels is heavily
favored to defeat Republican Robie Pooley.

   Last summer, Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman justice in the
200-year history of the Supreme Court, gave Chief Justice William
Rehnquist the vote he had sought for 16 years _ a working majority
to begin dismantling the ``Roe'' decision written by fellow Justice
Harry Blackmun in 1973.
   For now, business continues as usual at most of the clinics and
hospitals that annually perform legal abortions on three out of
every 100 American women of childbearing age. Under the new ruling,
more than 95 percent could proceed without legal interruption,
because that is the proportion who get abortions earlier than the
point at which the states may now intercede.
   But with three more challenges to Roe on the justices' docket,
it may not be long before the court jettisons the landmark 1973
decision entirely, allowing states either to re-criminalize all
abortions or impose any of dozens of proposed restrictions, ranging
from mandatory parental or spousal consent to forced medical
testing of the fetus and psychological counseling of the mother.
   Blackmun himself wrote that the signs his decision will be
explicitly overturned ``are evident and very ominous, and a chill
wind blows.''
   Some saw the Missouri ruling as the grandest judicial
affirmation to date of Ronald Reagan's revolution. Others say it
may prove, ironically, to unravel it. The opinion of the court's
majority simply is not shared by the majority of Americans.
   Most polls, including a Media General-Associated Press survey
last summer, say that by a 2-1 margin, Americans believe abortions
should be legal. But they are more evenly divided, and in some
cases tilt the other way, on questions regarding public spending,
parental consent and related curbs.
   Charlotte Taft, director of a women's clinic in Dallas, puts it
this way: ``Americans favor abortion only in the case of rape,
incest and their own personal circumstance.''
   Democratic pollster Peter Hart says many Republicans outside the
religious right _ those in the suburban mainstream of the party _
``have always given a wink and a nod'' to their candidates' stated
abortion views. But now that the court has made abortion a hot
political issue, he says, ``many will not find that acceptable
anymore.''
   William Schneider of the conservative American Enterprise
Institute echoed that view when he warned GOP politicians that
suburban defections ``could drive a stake through the heart of the
Reagan coalition.''
   Republican consultant Roger Stone, however, says the Democratic
Party, which unequivocally endorsed abortion rights in its platform
last year, stands to lose its last conservative bloc, the urban,
blue-collar Roman Catholics.
   There are no guarantees to any of these theories. Even the
Catholic coalition cannot be taken for granted, despite the
church's vehement opposition to abortion. Indeed, Guttmacher
researchers have found that Catholic women are more likely to have
an abortion than either Protestant or Jewish women _ probably
because they practice less birth control. Another somewhat
startling finding: One out of every six women who have an abortion
describes herself as an evangelical Christian.
   There will be some early clues on the political scene. Abortion
is an issue in two gubernatorial races next month, in New Jersey
and Virginia, as well as the mayoral contest in New York City. And
next year, 36 gubernatorial races as well as the U.S. House and a
third of the Senate will be fought.
   The pro-choice movement, meanwhile, is back on the march _
starting with a demonstration that drew more than 300,000 people to
the capital on the eve of the Supreme Court's hearing of the
Missouri case. And it was buoyed last month by the Florida
Legislature's wholesale rebuke of the anti-abortion laws Gov. Bob
Martinez tried to push through a special session. Moreover, for the
first time this decade, the House and Senate passed a bill that
would have granted rape and incest victims federal assistance for
abortions. Bush vetoed it this past week.
   ``Read our lips: Take our rights, lose your jobs,'' says Kate
Michelman, director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
At its 20th anniversary convention, the league named nine
politicians, including Martinez and Sen. Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, as special targets for defeat next year.
   According to Larry Sabato, political scientist at the University
of Virginia, abortion is likely to become ``The Beirut of American
politics _ a no-win issue.'' California pollster Mervin Field says
the nation's 7,500 state legislators are ``saying `Oh, my God,' and
wondering how they can control the damage.''
   The anit-abortion movement, meanwhile, is content to take things
one step at a time. ``We believe the court will permit the states
and Congress to restrict the reasons for abortions,'' says Douglas
Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee.
   Overall, more than half the states are regarded as likely to
enact some restrictions, another eight to 10 are battlegrounds, and
10 to 15 are likely to retain full abortion-on-demand rights.
   Part of the strategy of abortion opponents is to create such a
blizzard of consent and testing requirements that clinics and
doctors will give up their abortion services as legally or
financially risky. The anti-abortion shock troops, meanwhile,
belong to ``Operation Rescue,'' a largely white, evangelical
Christian group that counts 35,000 members and thousands of arrests
while demonstrating at abortion clinics around the country.
   Typically, its ``rescues'' entail forming a human blockade
around the clinic, while ``sidewalk counselors'' attempt to turn
away the women trying to get through. Some protestors have entered
clinics and damaged medical equipment with eggs and fake blood.
   The group, disowned by many in the anti-abortion movement, is
led by young Randall Terry, who carts a disfigured, splotchy fetus
he calls ``Baby Choice'' around the country in a jar of
formaldehyde. At news conferences, he lays the fetus out in a tiny
coffin lined with white satin. Terry, a former used-car salesman,
will point to the fetus and declare: ``That's not a blob of cells.
That's a little girl.''
   Operation Rescue also distributes a video designed to evoke
equal shock. It features shots of aborted fetuses mixed with scenes
of Nazi concentration camps. A somewhat milder video, called ``the
Silent Scream,'' has been circulated for years by other
anti-abortion groups.
   Now, the pro-choice forces are distributing a video of their
own. Produced by the Fund for the Feminist Majority, it is called
``Abortion: For Survival'' and depicts an actual abortion that
lasts 84 seconds and shows two aborted embryos, amounting to about
two tablespoons of blood and tissue. The point is to demonstrate
that what is swept from the womb in most abortions is not nearly
the baby-like figure depicted by the opposition.
   Whatever the tactics, the abortion war looms, like the civil
rights struggle and Vietnam, as a long and painful one for the
country. The difference is that nobody predicts an end to this
fight, by law or by conscience.

   President Daniel Ortega said anew
today that Nicaragua's Sandinista government will break a 19-month
cease-fire with U.S.-backed Contra guerrillas, but he refused to
say when.
   ``I don't want to abuse the hospitality of Costa Rica and so the
date on which the cease-fire will be suspended will be announced in
Nicaragua,'' he told a news conference.
   The leader of Nicaragua's leftist government added, however,
that he would keep observing the cease-fire if the United States
decided to ``take the money it gives to the counterrevolutionaries
and gives it instead to the United Nations so that it can be used
to demobilize the rebels inside and outside of Nicaragua.''
   Ortega had shocked a hemispheric meeting on peace and democracy
Friday by saying the cease-fire could not hold because of stepped
up attacks by rebel guerrillas. He made the announcement in a
speech at the University of Costa Rica.
   President Bush, at a news conference, called it ``a shameful
blow to democracy'' if Ortega does end the cease-fire and renew
hostilities. He called Ortega ``this little man ... in a military
uniform'' and criticized Ortega's conduct at the hemispheric
meeting on democracy.
   The cease-fire has been extended on a monthly basis since March
23, 1988, with the latest extension running out Oct. 31.
   Ortega said the fighting had never entirely ceased in Nicaragua
despite the cease-fire. He said Contra attacks since March 1988 had
left 736 dead and 1,153 injured, with 1,481 other people kidnapped
or ``disappeared.''
   ``The waves of attacks by the counterrevolutionaries have
increased enormously in the last few weeks,'' said Ortega.
   He said thousands of Contra troops had moved back into
Nicaragua. ``The objective is the destruction of the electoral
process in Nicaragua,'' said Ortega, who is running for re-election
in Feb. 25 elections.
   ``The drop of water that made the glass spill'' was an attack
that killed 19 people last Sunday, Ortega told an audience at the
University of Costa Rica Friday night.
   ``After these savage attacks I met with the army high command to
analyze the situation, and the result of the analysis was that the
cease-fire could not be maintained,'' Ortega said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III promptly condemned any end
to the cease-fire as a ``step backwards'' in a Central American
peace process that has been painstakingly promoted by Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias.
   Baker said Ortega must have been ``too ashamed to bring it up''
during a three-hour meeting with 16 other hemispheric leaders here
to help celebrate 100 years of Costa Rican democracy.
   The cease-fire went into effect shortly after the United States
halted military aid to the Contras.
   Scattered fighting inside Nicaragua continued, but at a greatly
reduced scale. The United States kept up non-lethal aid as about
12,000 Contra troops moved out of the jungle and into camps in
Honduras.
   The fighting began to pick up again after five Central American
presidents, Noriega included, signed peace accords on Aug. 7.
   The accords called for disbandment of the Contras in exchange
for democracy in Nicaragua and an agreement that all parties would
stop supporting subversive movements in other countries.
   In a surge of optimism that followed the accords and Sandinista
moves towards elections, Contra and Sandinista commanders held
battlefield parleys and the Sandinistas suspended the draft.
   But Contra field leaders said they were not a party to the
agreements and would not comply. They said they had been betrayed
and tarred by their association with the United States and its
unsteady support.
   Israel Galeano, commander of the Contra army, began sending his
troops back into Nicaragua, saying they were the only guarantee
that the Sandinistas would keep their promise to hold free
elections.
   Nicaraguan Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, Daniel Ortega's
brother, said Sandinista forces would not attack Contra positions
but also would not allow them to move into new areas.
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani said ending the
cease-fire ``is a serious blow to the Central American peace plan,
we should all understand that the solution isn't easy.''
   Baker said Cristiani appealed to Ortega at Friday's meeting to
stop shipping arms to rebels in El Salvador, but Ortega made no
reply.
   When the first Contras began marching out of their camps in
Honduras at the beginning of September, some U.S. officials who
spoke on condition of anonymity said they feared that the powerful
Sandinista army would be able to wipe out the isolated and
outnumbered Contra groups.
   Sunday's attack, which took place on the last day of voter
registration for Feb. 25's general election, proved ``the Contras
are trying to deny the Nicaraguan people their right to an
electoral process,'' Ortega said.
   ``We have to guarantee the safety of the Nicaraguan people and
the electoral process, which means we have to organize the army
better and means it is unacceptable for us to disarm ourselves,''
he said.
   Baker warned that resumed fighting could be ``seized upon as a
desperate effort to cancel the elections,'' the linchpin of the
peace process.

<HEAD>After Months of Drama, Pierce's Silence All but Closes House HUD
Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The six-month House investigation of federal
housing programs yielded dramatic tales of mismanagement and
favoritism but failed to reveal definitively what roles former top
agency officials played and whether they engaged in criminal
activity.
   ``We didn't crack the ring,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays,
R-Conn. ``We didn't nail down and expose what I think was a
conspiracy to defraud the government.'''
   The investigation by the Government Operations subcommittee on
employment and housing began in April after a Department of Housing
and Urban Development report found that a rehabilitation program
was being milked for millions of dollars in excess rents and that
subsidies apparently had been steered to developers who hired
well-connected consultants.
   In 24 hearings the panel was told how HUD failed to keep track
of millions of dollars, mismanaged programs and gave favored
treatment to those with agency or political connections.
   But the refusal of former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. and
three of his top deputies to answer questions about their roles
left a gaping hole in the investigation and also effectively ended
it. Only a few more hearings are expected before the investigation
is closed.
   The question of whether there was criminal activity was left to
the Justice Department. Justice Department spokesman David Runkel
said Friday that investigations are ongoing.
   ``We have more than 700 open cases that involve up to 1,000
individuals or companies,'' he said. ``These are high priority
items and will continue to be until this HUD mess is cleaned up.''
   But Runkel said Attorney General Dick Thornburgh opposes
congressional efforts to get him to name a special prosecutor to
investigate HUD.
   Federal authorities have in recent months reviewed records
compiled by HUD's inspector general and the subcomittee, and
several grand jury investigations are known to exist.
   The only way for the subcommittee investigation to make
significant progress would be to secure the testimony of one or
more of the former HUD officials who refused to testify, members of
the panel said. The only way to do that, it appears, would be to
grant immunity.
   The panel's chairman, Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said Friday he
had no current plans to offer immunity to anyone but said he had
not ruled it out in the future.
   Lantos appears to lack the support on the panel he would need
for such a move.
   ``I have no intention of playing God and trying to decide who
should and who shouldn't be granted immunity,'' said Shays.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said immunity was ``a very sensitive
subject'' and should only be granted if approved by prosecutors.
   One member of the panel, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said preliminary discussions with two of the former Pierce aides
about immunity had convinced him they would provide too little
evidence to make it worthwhile.
   Even Lantos, who has appeared to relish his role in leading the
televised hearings, conceded the decisions by Pierce and others not
to answer questions effectively brought the subcommittee
investigation to a halt.
   ``The subcommittee has finished the bulk of its work,'' he said.
   That work included public testimony from 50 witnesses, staff
interviews with scores more and occasional theatrics.
   With one notable exception, the former HUD officials,
consultants, closing agents and attorneys called before the panel
to discuss their activities said they had done nothing wrong.
   The exception was Marilyn Harrell, better known as ``Robin
HUD,'' who wept and read from Scripture as she told how she easily
stole more than $5 million from HUD during her work as a closing
agent on property sales and gave some of it to the needy. She said
she deserved to be punished and promised to repay.
   Other witnesses, however, defended their HUD-related activities,
which including reaping fees of up to $1.3 million for lobbying HUD
on behalf of developers.
   Paul Manafort, a prominent Republican consultant, conceded his
work could be called ``influence peddling'' but said he broke no
laws or HUD regulations.
   Former Interior Secretary James Watt matter-of-factly defended
his making $300,000 to $420,000 on one project alone _ for making a
few phone calls to HUD and sitting down with Pierce for one meeting.
   And Bill Taylor, a National Republican Committee member from
Florida, bragged about his ability to win HUD work for his clients
and blurted out a sarcastic ``Good luck'' when told the goal of the
hearings was to remove influence peddling from government.
   He promised to stop cashing in on his political position ``as
soon as Congress does.''

   Police are looking for a fussy bank robber
who walked up to a teller and demanded $418, but ``no ones.''
   The teller handed over an undisclosed amount of money on Friday
and the robber, who was wielding a sharp object, fled on foot.
   ``I don't know how he figured unless he expected change,'' said
Cpl. Thomas McCreer, a Baltimore County police spokesman.
   In another unusual robbery, a young man bicycled up to the
drive-in window of a Catonsville bank and placed a knapsack
containing a note and black box wrapped in duct tape in the drawer.
The note said the box contained a bomb, police said.
   ``You have 40 seconds to fill this bag with $100,000,'' the note
read. ``The alarms have been fixed so that the bomb will explode if
alarms are triggered and we will all die. You now have 30 seconds.''
   Police said the teller placed an undisclosed amount of money in
the knapsack and the robber pedaled away. There was no bomb.
   No arrests were made in either case.

<HEAD>Illicit Home Taping Cuts Music Sales as Much as 22 Percent, Study
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home taping may be causing as much as a 22
percent loss in prerecorded music sales, a congressional report
said Saturday.
   The report, which Congress will use as it considers possible
legislation dealing with existing taping and future taping from new
technologies such as digital audio tape and erasable-recordable
compact discs, showed 41 percent of people over age 10 had taped
recorded music in the previous year.
   That compared with 21-22 percent in a 1978-79 survey, but was
about the same as 1982, the Office of Technology Assessment said.
   The survey also found that most people tape from their own
recordings or those of family members and that they think the
practice should continue to be allowed without extra compensation
to recording artists or manufacturers. But, overwhelmingly, they
thought taping for sale was wrong.
   ``Tapers and non-tapers agreed that taping `to save money' was
acceptable, but taping `to make money' was wrong,'' the study said.
   ``It is noteworthy that none of the alternative approaches of
limiting recording technology or imposing new fees seemed to have
an identifiable constituency among the public,'' OTA said. ``In
general, tapers, purchasers of prerecorded products and nontapers
seemed to feel that it was fair to leave current home taping
practices unchanged.''
   OTA, which advises Congress on technological issues, said the
survey was conducted by phone with 1,501 people last September and
October. The margin of error was plus or minus three percentage
points.
   OTA found that 57 percent of those who had taped in the previous
year thought they could have bought the material if they had
wished. Of those, 49 percent said they would have bought it if they
had been unable to tape. In 77 percent of the cases in which the
taper could have purchased, the taper said that if he or she had
bought the recording, it would have been in addition to other
recordings purchased, rather than in place of them.
   The OTA concluded that about 22 percent (.57 multiplied by .49
multiplied by .77) ``of the most recent tapings from prerecorded
formats displaced sales of prerecorded music that might have
otherwise been made, if the respondent could not tape.''
   OTA acknowledged, however, that the figure could be
``excessively high'' since other studies have shown that half or
fewer of respondents answering affirmatively to hypothetical
questions actually engage in the behavior being studied.
   Thus, OTA said, the 22 percent figure should be considered the
upper limit.
   The OTA noted, however, that the findings also indicated that if
people were unable to make the tapes, ``over three-fourths of the
tapes that would have been made would not be replaced by sales of
prerecorded music.''
   The survey providing some good news for the music industry, OTA
said.
   ``Music tapers, in general, had a greater interest in music,
listened to more music and purchased more recorded music products
than did non-tapers,'' OTA said.
   ``While home taping certainly displaced some sales of
prerecorded music sales of prerecorded products, survey data also
pointed to some stimulative effects. Home tapes had value in
promoting songs and performers. In addition, a significant number
of purchasers bought prerecorded products with the intention of
copying them,'' OTA said.
   Most copying was for ``place-shifting,'' that is, copying music
from records and compact discs to the more portable cassette format
for Walkman-type players and car decks, OTA said.
   The result was that tapers were far more likely to purchase a
record or more expensive CD than a prerecorded audiocassette, the
study said.
   The study primarily was devoted to audio taping, not video
taping. But the survey found that ``most videocassette recordings,
unlike their audio counterparts, were made for temporary use,''
primarily ``time-shifting'' for viewing at a more convenient time.
   The Supreme Court's landmark MCA-Sony case in 1984 said home
video taping of over-the-air broadcast material for time-shifting
purposes was allowed. The court did not address the taping of cable
TV or pay television programs, or the issue of ``library building''
of recorded programs, OTA said.
   The OTA survey found that 75 percent of those questioned thought
it was acceptable to copy a record, tape or CD they owned for their
own use. Only 11 percent found the practice unacceptable.
   Most people, 76 percent, found it unacceptable to sell a copy
made from their own tapes, records or CDs.
   Other findings showed that of respondents 17 years and older:
   _56 percent said it would be unfair to make recorders that won't
copy and 55 percent deemed it unfair to make prerecorded music
copy-proof.
   _57 percent said it would be unfair to add a copyright fee to
recorders to compensate recording artists for home taping, and 59
percent thought the same thing about a fee on blank tapes.

   President Bush today denounced
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's decision to end a ceasefire
with the Contras as a ``shameful blow to democracy,'' but urged the
U.S.-backed rebels to refrain from military attack with elections
looming in February.
   At a news conference on the final day of talks with leaders from
throughout the hemisphere, Bush sidestepped a question about
whether he would seek a resumption of military aid to the rebels,
saying any such decision was premature.
   ``I don't think the Contras ought to attack,'' he said of the
small force of rebels operating within Nicaragua. ``What we ought
to do is fulfill the agreements'' forged by Costa Rican President
Oscar Arias. Under the Arias plan, Ortega had agreed to hold free
elections in Nicaragua in February and the United States had
withheld military aid to the Contras.
   Bush spoke after Ortega declined to specify when his own troops
would resume offensive actions.
   ``I don't want to abuse the hospitality of Costa Rica and so the
date on which the cease-fire will be suspended will be announced in
Nicaragua,'' he said.
   Ortega said he would continue observing the 19-month ceasefire
if non-lethal American aid currently going to the Contras were made
available only to demobilize the U.S.-backed rebels.
   The rival news conferences demonstrated the extent to which the
ceasefire issue had overwhelmed Arias' carefully planned two-day
``celebration of democracy.'' The international gathering was
ending later in the day with the dedication of a public plaza _
with both Bush and Ortega on the guest list.
   Ortega said Friday night that he was ending the cease-fire
because of ``savage attacks'' by Contra forces on peasants trying
to register to vote.
   Bush said the ``world was dismayed'' by the announcement and
that ``a break of that agreement and a renewal of all-out fighting
would be a very bad thing for Ortega.''
   The president made his comments after a meeting with a group of
Latin American leaders, including opponents to Ortega and Panama's
Manuel Antonio Noriega to emphasize his distaste for the pair.
   He chided Ortega for being the only leader to wear ``a military
uniform in this meeting of democracies'' and said the announcement
was an affront to Arias.
   ``It's a shameful blow to democracy,'' Bush said.
   As for Panama's leader, he said, ``the outlaw Noriega regime
simply must be replaced.''
   Bush said it appeared that Ortega might be hedging his threat to
lift the cease-fire, but noted that U.S. officials had not had a
chance to fully review his latest comments.
   But asked whether the United States should be prepared to help
the Contras, Bush said:
   ``You're asking me to buy into a hypothesis that might not be
true ... I want to see what develops. But he knows if there is a
military offensive that is going to change the equation 180
degrees.''
   Asked to elaborate, he said, ``We'll let you know.''
   He grew more acerbic about the Sandinista leader as his
40-minute news conference progressed, describing Ortega as ``that
unwanted animal at the garden party.''
   He added, ``We didn't come here to have any contretemps with
this little man showing up at a democracy meeting in a military
uniform.''
   The president urged Ortega not to interfere with the elections
set for next February, and said, ``the people of this hemisphere
know the difference between real elections and sham elections.''
   Discussions of drugs and debt issues dominated Friday's
opening-day of the meetings, but tensions between the United States
and Nicaragua overshadowed the three-hour official session and a
lavish state dinner Friday evening.
   Going into the meeting, the United States had refused to sign
any communique stemming from the meeting if Ortega also signed.
   Bush and Ortega greeted each other at the opening session with a
handshake, but the Nicaraguan president _ stung by days of hostile
rhetoric from Bush _ announced soon after the meeting that he was
ending the cease-fire that had been in effect with the Contras
since March 1988.
   ``The drop of water that made the glass spill over was the
attack that the mercenaries launched on Oct. 22, the last day of
voter registration, when campesinos who wanted to vote were
assassinated,'' Ortega told an audience of about 3,000 at the
University of Costa Rica.
   He said 19 peasants had been killed.
   U.S. officials acknowledged skirmishing had occurred but said
they could not tell who started it, and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III suggested the Contras might have been defending
themselves.
   Baker said he found it ``more than passing strange'' that Ortega
never mentioned the cease-fire in the three-hour group meeting.
   ``Maybe he was too ashamed to bring it up there with the other
heads of state in attendance,'' Baker said.
   In Nicaragua, Roger Guevara, leader of an opposition lawyers'
group, claimed that recent attacks attributed to the Contras
actually were the work of government troops ``to impede the
democratic process in this country.''
   But Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto said in a radio interview
that the Nicaraguan government ``has the responsibility to be
absolutely firm against terrorism.''
   Bush made a point of greeting both Violeta Chamorro, the
opposition presidential candidate in Nicaragua, and Guillermo
Endara, leader of Panama's opposition, at Friday's opening session,
which they attended as guests.
   Observers contend that Endara handily won the May 7 Panamanian
election that was subsequently invalidated by Noriega.
   Baker said the leaders in their afternoon meeting discussed a
proposed drug summit, but no date or place was set.

   Here is the text of President Bush's
news conference Saturday:
   First a statement and then some questions. Be glad to respond.
   Together with the other democratic leaders of the hemisphere,
I've just met with the leaders of the political opposition in
Nicaragua and Panama. And here in Costa Rica, saluting 100 years of
democracy, these discussions, sponsored by Costa Rica's main
political parties, serve as an especially fitting tribute to the
spirit of the occasion and the spirt of the times. And these
courageous leaders left us with a stronger appreciation of the
daily difficulties of the pro-democracy movements in these two
countries. I conveyed to them the encouragement and the admiration
of the American people.
   And it's ironic that the shining example of Latin American
democracy in which we meet lies between two nations whose rulers
have so long and so harshly ignored the will of their own people.
From Cape Horn to the Bering Straits, from Chile's promising new
plebiscite to the Alaska-Soviet border we opened after 40 years, a
new breath of freedom has swept the Americas with hope and freedom,
hope and opportunity, and bringing us even closer to the world's
first completely democratic hemisphere.
   A few nations, however, have been left behind, shackled by
failed ideology and failed leadership. To the north, the Nicaraguan
people have waited for democracy since they ended the Somoza regime
10 years ago, that dictatorship. And elections are planned for next
February, but, to date ... there are some disturbing signs.
   The world, I believe, is dismayed at Mr. Ortega's announcement
last night that he had unilaterally ended the cease-fire. I
understand there may have been some refinements on that today, but
that was what he said. And it's a shameful blow to democracy, and
the fact that no mention of this came during the course of the
hours of dialogue that we all had, the presidents of these
democracies, demonstrates just how shameful an act it truly is.
   Regarding the forthcoming elections, as was so evident in
Panama, the people of this hemisphere know the difference between
real elections and sham elections. And the hemisphere will not
settle for anything less than free and fair elections. The people
of Nicaragua know the kind of steps that the ruling Sandinistas can
take to show a real commitment to fair elections. And the whole
world will be watching this one. And if the Sandinistas don't allow
fair debates and clean elections, they confirm the dictatorship
long before the elections even take place. The world understands
that no real democracy is threatened by the voices of its own
people.
   And it's ironic that here we are, and I'm so glad I came to this
meeting to salute Costa Rica's hundred years of democracy. It was
very ironic. There was only one man in a military uniform in this
meeting of democracies.
   Speaking of military uniforms, speaking of dictatorships, to the
south, the outlaw Noriega regime simply must be replaced. This is
not the judgment of Uncle Sam. It is the judgment of the Panamanian
people, and it is the judgment of history, and it is the judgment,
I believe, of every single democratically elected president who was
at this meeting.
   Today Noriega may think his lead-pipe politics have won. But
he's won nothing more than a fragile status quo, and democracy
really will triumph in Panama. I'm confident of that. It's a
question of when, not if, and by putting his own personal interests
above those of the Panamanian people, Noriega will only continue to
lose support internationally, inside the Panamanian defense forces,
and among the growing number of courageous Panamanians who dare to
resist his oppressive rule.
   Let me assure you, the United States will continue to work with
the democracies in this hemisphere and around the world to support
the struggle of the Panamanian people. Today, every continent is
being swept by the new breeze of political change. And the world
has watched in wonder as brave men and women have taken to the
streets to claim their rights, to proclaim a faith in democracy.
Some governments respond with reform, some with repression, but
there is no longer any doubt which side history is on. The day of
the despot, the day of the dictator is over, finished.
   The Nicaraguans and Panamanians with whom I've just met are
brave and inspiring people. They stand in the vanguard of history,
and they deserve the active support of all who support democracy in
this hemisphere.
   I'd be glad to respond to questions.

<TEXT>
   Q. Mr. President, Mr. Ortega says that the cease-fire won't hold
because of what he calls ``savage attacks by the U.S.-backed
contras.'' To what extent does the United States bear
responsibility for the actions of the contras? And what kind of
instructions will you send to the contra field commanders now, in
view of the end of the cease-fire?
   A. Well, first I won't listen to Mr. Noriega's charge that this
is _ his outrageous breach of this _ alleged breach of the
cease-fire, willingness to breach it is entirely _ Ortega _ willing
to bear the burden _ put it all on the contras. There have been
flare-ups up there. We have encouraged the contras not to take
aggressive military action, and we would certainly continue to do
that. But to accept his judgment that some excuse for ending the
cease-fire rests totally on the contras, I'm not going to do that
at all.
   Q. (inaudible) did you say that you won't _ encourage them not
to take aggressive action?
   A. Oh, yeah _ we'll
   Q. cease-fire is ending and they're going on the attack?
   A. Who's that?
   Q. If the Sandinistas are ending the cease-fire to go on the
attack?
   A. Well I think they're violating and breaking the very _ very
agreements they've made if they do that. And I don't think they
should, and I don't think the contras ought to attack.
   What we ought to do is fulfill the agreements that have been
made. They agreed to stop subverting their neighbors, for example,
I'm talking about Ortega and the Sandinistas. My golly, the other
day we uncover a great truck of munitions going in. And one of the
dramatic moments yesterday was when Mr. Cristiani, the fairly
elected president of Salvador, in a very diplomatic way I might
add, told him, ``Stop sending that stuff into our country. You
agreed you wouldn't do it, and now you're doing it. You agreed to
talk to the resistance.''
   That's who they ought to talk to. He's always kind of sidling up
to me looking for some photo op _ what he ought to do is talk to
the resistance. That's what he agreed to do. Why doesn't he do it?
And he agreed to release the political prisoners. Not so. Hasn't
done it.
   Conditions for free and fair access to the media, they agreed to
that, and that hasn't taken place the way it should. There's some
signs that are good. The registration, let's say, hey that's good.
We're encouraged, some 90 percent supposed to have registered. No
government resources are supposed to go to the campaign. I'm told
that has been violated.
   So rather than find a canard, rather than find some hook to
break up an agreement on, I think they ought to go forward and
honor the agreement that's been made. And I would also say I would
encourage the contras in every way possible not to engage in
military action. ...
   Q. What are your options? What can you do since it's very clear
that you are at a meeting where, I would say most of the Latin
leaders would not want to resume military action or aid to the
contras, and so forth? That's obviously _ this is the peace
meeting. So what do you have in mind, what have you done so far,
knowing this for 18 hours or so?
   A. Well one of the things I did is talk to those who have a
little more influence with Mr. Ortega than I do, that would be
everybody at the meeting, probably, and talked to several of them
last night and they leaned on him pretty hard. And there was _ to
be fair about it, I'm told at a press conference the man had a
little bit of backing off, a little bit. And so let's wait and see,
is what I'm saying. But right now I could use this forum to say: Do
not break that cease-fire.
   Q. (Inaudible.)
   A. Well, we're not going to cross that bridge till we get there.
Yes, way in the back. Yes, sir.
   Q. Mr. President, I am journalist from El Salvador, and I want
to do a question specifically of my country.
   A. Sure.
   Q. The first are _ are there any signs that peace in El Salvador
is near, and what are these signs? And the other one is, with
respect to the human rights in El Salvador, would you say that your
government is satisfied?
   A. I would say on the first part _ and I got this from the other
presidents _ a recognition that the election in El Salvador, free
and certifiably fair, was an important major step towards the peace
that the people of El Salvador want. I must say that the shipment
that was discovered of Mr. Ortega shipping military weapons into _
into El Salvador in a direct violation of this _ these agreements
was a bad sign, but _ what was the second part of your question?
   So, in other words, I am more encouraged about peace there. I
believe Mr. Cristiani is trying very hard, and let me just say he
has the full support of our government, whatever that -- whatever
we can do to help him facilitate the peace and to enhance the
democracy.
   There was a second part, though, that I'm not sure I responded
to.

   President Bush today defended his
veto of the District of Columbia's $3.4 billion budget, saying he
will stand like ``a brick wall'' against any attempt to use public
funds for abortions.
   Bush, here for the Western Hemisphere meeting on democracy,
vetoed the measure Friday despite protests that the veto could
impede the city's anti-crime effort.
   The bill would have restored the District of Columbia's ability
to pay for abortions for poor women with local taxpayers' funds,
not federal money. Bush last week vetoed a $157 billion
appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human
Services and Education that would have allowed Medicaid to pay for
abortions nationwide for victims of rape or incest.
   Asked at a news conference how he justified blocking the
District of Columbia from using its own funds for abortions, Bush
replied:
   ``I don't think public money ought to go for that, except in the
life of the mother. ... They can push me for political advantage
every time they want to, and they're going to be up against a brick
wall.''
   ``The people that are being victimized by those kinds of
political games are the people in the District of Columbia,'' Bush
said.
   City Council Chairman David Clarke complained that a $32 million
extra federal payment for a series of anti-crime measures will now
be delayed for at least a month.
   ``The president has shown his willingness to sacrifice the
public safety of the citizens of the nation's capital in order to
appeal to a one-issue constituency,'' Clarke said.
   Mayor Marion Barry said, ``We find it ironic that at the same
time the president is vetoing this anti-crime, anti-drug
appropriations package, he is in Costa Rica ... to celebrate the
centennial of democratic rule in that country. Yet, while he is
away, we are having dictatorial rule here in Washington.''
   The budget was for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.

   Thousands of teachers, students and

government approve a banned teachers' union. Police armed with tear
gas followed them.
   About 3,000 protesters marched near downtown Seoul, while 1,000
riot police with tear gas followed. The police did not intervene
and reported no arrests.
   Twenty trade unions sponsored Saturday's march, which included
hundreds of high school students and dissidents.
   The government has outlawed the union, contending it has been
used by leftists to spread revolutionary ideas among students.
Hundreds of teachers have been disciplined or dismissed so far this
year in connection with the union movement.
   Teachers say the movement is aimed at educational reform and has
no political purposes.

   A draft report by a Defense Department study
group says homosexuals trying to join the military have stronger
qualifications and fewer problems in their backgrounds than their
heterosexual counterparts.
   ``These results appear to be in conflict with conceptions of
homosexuals as unstable, maladjusted persons,'' the report by the
Defense Personnel Security Research and Education Center concludes.
The center analyzes what kind of people can be trusted with
classified information.
   The report, conducted early this year, was leaked to members of
Congress who want the Pentagon to reverse its policy against
allowing gays and lesbians into the military.
   U.S. Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., an avowed homosexual, gave a
copy Friday to The Associated Press.
   The report compares the background records of 166 gays and
lesbians who entered the military and were subsequently discharged
because of their sexual preference with those of heterosexuals who
were in the military.
   ``The preponderance of the evidence presented indicates that
homosexuals show preservice suitability-related adjustment that is
as good or better than the average heterosexual,'' the report's
author, Michael A. McDaniel concludes.
   The 23-page report looked at school conduct records, thinking
skills, adjustment to military life and substance abuse.
Homosexuals performed better except in all except the drug and
alcohol abuse categories.
   The report cautioned that relatively few homosexuals were
surveyed in the report compared with some 42,000 heterosexuals.
``Less confidence should be placed in conclusions drawn from small
samples,'' McDaniel said.
   One argument against homosexuals in the military it that they
pose security risks because someone could use the threat of
exposure to blackmail them into spying. Studds said that removing
discrimination would remove the problem.
   The report is the second in as many weeks released to media
organizations that raises questions about the Pentagon policy
toward homosexuals. A longer, 1988 study by the same center
concluded that the Pentagon should let homosexuals enter military
service.
   The new report makes no policy recommendation but instead
suggests further study.
   Defense Department spokesman Jim Turner said the earlier report
was rejected because ``it was not responsive to the original
research request: whether there is any connection between personnel
security and sexual orientation.''
   Turner said a completed report from the center on that subject
is expected by the end of the year. He said the second report also
had not been released because it was in draft form and had not gone
through a complete review.
   The Pentagon currently stands by its policy against homosexuals
in military service. ``Homosexuality is not compatible with
military life,'' Turner said.
   Several court decisions have upheld the military's policy,
although a federal appeals court in San Francisco determined in May
that career officer Perry Watkins could re-enlist because the Army
had known of his homosexuality when he re-enlisted in the past.
   ``The Defense Department policy which discriminates against gays
and lesbians employs precisely the same arguments used against
blacks and women before they were integrated into the armed
services, namely, that their inclusion is `contrary to good order
and discipline,''' Studds said.
   But Studds says there is no political climate in Congress to
pressure the Pentagon to change.
   Studds accused the military of withholding the reports from
Congress and the public simply because they ran contrary to current
Pentagon policy.
   The new report ``is another eloquent statement requested by and
then subsequently rejected by the Pentagon,'' he said.

<HEAD>San Francisco Magnitude Quake Likely to Strike East in Next 20 Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scientists say there is a 90 percent chance a
quake as strong as the one that just wrecked part of the San
Francisco area will hit the more-unprepared eastern United States
within 20 years.
   ``All of Japan is subjected to risk, so Japan thinks about it an
awful lot,'' said engineer Michael O'Rourke. ``California thinks
about it a fair amount. In the East, I don't think the public
awareness is at the level where one would like it to be.''
   Earthquakes were relatively common in the eastern states in the
17th, 18th and 19th centuries, but few have occurred this century.
That has raised fears that tension is building deep underground,
waiting to be suddenly released in a damaging tremor.
   ``There have been some studies recently which indicate that the
chances of a significant quake, with a reading of 6.5 and above, is
greater than 90 percent in the eastern United States within the
next 20 years,'' O'Rourke said in a telephone interview.
   O'Rourke, a civil engineering professor at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., said such a quake ``would
affect more people and there would probably be more damage because
of the differences in building code requirements in California as
opposed to the East.''
   Robert M. Hamilton, a seismologist at the U.S. Geological Survey
in Reston, Va., said the New Madrid, Mo., region, which was hit by
major tremors in 1811-12, is considered one of the most hazardous
in terms of potential earthquake activity in the East.
   That could be serious for cities such as Memphis and St. Louis
that are built largely on sediment deposited by the Mississippi
River over the centuries.
   It was similar mud fill in the Bay area where the greatest
damage occurred in San Francisco and Oakland, said Hamilton. Filled
land in a former lakebed also was blamed for the massive
destruction in the Mexico City earthquake a few years ago.
   A devastating quake struck Charleston, S.C., in 1886, and
serious quakes also have been felt around Boston, Connecticut, the
Virginia-West Virginia border, along the St. Lawrence Valley in
upstate New York and in parts of Illinois, Utah and other states.
   A tremor shook Jamaica Bay in New York in the 1800s. Such a
tremor, if repeated today, could cause as much as $7 billion in
damage to the borough of Brooklyn, the late Robert L. Ketter has
said.
   Ketter, who was director of the National Center for Earthquake
Engineering Research in Buffalo, N.Y., told a Senate subcommittee
last year that a destructive earthquake is almost certain to strike
the eastern United States sometime in the next two decades.
   While scientists cannot predict when or where the quake might
hit, or its strength, they consider one almost sure to occur in the
East before the year 2010, Ketter said.
   It's ``an almost sure thing ... we just don't know where or
when,'' said Dr. James E. Beavers, an engineer with Martin Marietta
Energy Systems in Oak Ridge, Tenn.
   Beavers' warning is detailed in a study of the earthquake hazard
to energy systems, published by the American Association of
Engineering Societies.
   Particularly vulnerable to tremors in the eastern states, he
noted, are schools. Largely constructed of unreinforced brick and
masonry, many deaths and injuries could result if a quake struck in
the eastern states during daytime hours.
   O'Rourke said that in structures not designed to resist quakes,
such as homes, similar amounts of damage would be expected in
either California or the East.
   But larger buildings, termed ``engineered structures,'' in
California are designed to meet fairly stringent building codes and
thus would be expected to withstand seismic shaking better than
similar facilities in the East, said O'Rourke.
   ``Also,'' he said, ``people in the West have planned for
earthquakes. There are emergency response plans which
municipalities have, utilities, water systems, and so forth. ... In
the East that kind of planning has not been as common.''
   In 1811 and 1812, a series of quakes shifted the land around New
Madrid, Mo., so drastically that the Mississippi River was said to
flow backwards for a time. The huge Reelfoot Lake in northwest
Tennessee was created by that tremor and the ground shook as far
away as Washington, D.C.
   A similar series of tremors could be expected to kill 200 to
5,000 people, injure 8,000 and leave an estimated 250,000 homeless
in the nearby Memphis vicinity, scientists have estimated. Damage
would extend to such cities as Paducah, Ky.; Carbondale, Ill.;
Evansville, Ind.; Poplar Bluff, Mo., and Little Rock, Ark.
   An additional problem for the East is the fact that quakes there
are felt over a larger area than those that strike the western
states.
   ``The attenuation is different in the East than the West,''
explained O'Rourke. ``If you have a have a magnitude 7 quake in
California, the distance that people feel it is maybe 100 ... to
250 miles. If the same event occurred in the East, the area able to
feel the motion would be much larger ... because the damping in the
rocks in the East is not as large as in the West.''
   He compared the East to ``a puddle of water where you throw a
stone in and waves move outward'' and said, ``The West is more like
a puddle of heavy oil where the waves die out rapidly.''
   Also, quakes are not as narrowly defined in the East. In
California, the tremors occur along the San Andreas Fault, which
divides two great plates of the earth's crust. In the East, the
nearest plate border is the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, so quakes
in the eastern states are at the center of a giant plate rather
than along an edge.
   ``It's as if you had a large disk and were pressing at the edge
and it cracked somewhere in the middle, as opposed to two disks
rubbing together,'' said O'Rourke.

   Police are looking for youngsters who have
attacked seven women with pinlike weapons, possibly needles, on
Manhattan's Upper West Side.
   Some victims said they felt like they were pricked with a
needle, Sgt. Maurice Howard, a police spokesman, said Friday.
   ``No words are exchanged. There is no robbery,'' Howard said.
``We're trying to find out what the motive is ... and what kind of
weapon was used.''
   Four of the attacks occurred Tuesday, two on Wednesday and one
on Thursday, Howard said. ``The injuries weren't serious.''
   But some of the victims were frightened they were attacked with
disease-contaminated needles.
   ``They were taunting me and laughing at me,'' Joan Ellis said of
her attackers. ``I'm terrified.''

<HEAD>SAN JOSE: I responded to.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q. Yes. With respect to the human rights in El Salvador, would
you say that your government is satisfied?
   A. Well, there's been dramatic progress, and nothing has been
called to my attention that makes me dissatisfied, but I don't want
to take one look and say that everything is perfect. I can't say
that. I do know that the administration is trying very _ the new
administration _ very, very hard, and dramatic improvements have
been made.
   Q. Mr. President, you say you really don't want to take any
action until this thing clarifies itself with Ortega, but doesn't
there have to be some kind of stick employed here in terms of the
contras now? Aren't you honor-bound to help them defend themselves
if indeed the Sandinistas are about to unlaunch some sort of
offensive against them?
   A. Well, if it resulted _ I mean, you're asking me to buy into a
hypothesis that may not be true.
   Q. He talks of breaching it.
   A. Well, he's talking about it, and you've got a lot of
presidents here that are trying to tell him that would be sheer
folly, so I want to see how it develops. But he knows that if
there's an all-out military offensive, that's going to change the
equation 180 degrees.
   Q. Mr. President, you have placed great faith in regional
diplomacy, your relations with leaders in this hemisphere like the
leaders gathered here. What does it tell you about the
effectiveness of such an approach when a man like Daniel Ortega
feels free to walk into a gathering like this, and at this very
meeting, announce an action which is an insult to every leader here
and a violation of the agreements that you've cited?
   A. It tells me that I should not judge the whole hemisphere by
one _ I heard it, I heard one of our leading TV journalists use an
analogy about an animal at a garden party, yesterday, and I won't
do it because it might take on different _ but that's exactly what
happened, so am not going to judge a salute to democracy _ a
hundred years of Costa Rican democracy _ by the fact that Mr.
Ortega looks like that unwanted _ unwanted animal at a garden party.
   And, I'm _ so _ what you're doing is focusing on _ and I
understand it _ the controversy, the one thing. There has been _
the feeling on parts in some countries here, of neglect by the
United States. Under this president, there will no longer ever be a
feeling of neglect, and we came here to talk about debt and drugs
and democracy, and we're not going to let this one little man _ who
is out of whack with the rest of the hemisphere _ ruin a very good
meeting.
   Q. Doesn't it suggest, sir, that he feels he has nothing to fear
from the regional diplomacy by which you have set such great store,
when he feels free to do what he has done here?
   A. If he goes forward with it, yes, and it will bring down on
him the outrage of every president and those that invited him here,
I'm sure, will be terribly disappointed. But we didn't come here to
have any contretemp with this little man, showing up in his
military uniform at a democracy meeting. That's not what it's all
about. We're talking about much broader things, but we'll _ let's
wait and see how that develops. He knows the United States'
position, and he knows the position of others in the hemisphere. ...
   Q. Do you foresee a change in U.S. policy towards Latin America
directly because of this meeting?
   A. I see an enhanced interaction, and I don't see a dramatic
change, because I'm one and our defense _ I mean our secretary of
state and our interests have long been intertwined with those in
this hemisphere, but I see a day of the democracy _ hemisphere
total democracy.

<HEAD>Cheney Rules Out Early Troop Withdrawals From Berlin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Saturday
reaffirmed Washington's military commitment to West Berlin, saying
cuts are unlikely while large Soviet and East German contingents
surround the divided city.
   Cheney is on a three-week European tour to talk with allied
government leaders and visit U.S. troops. He arrived in West Berlin
late Friday after two days of talks with West German leaders in
Bonn.
   During a welcoming ceremony at Charlottenburg Castle, Cheney
said Berlin would likely be ``one of the last places'' where troop
reductions would be made under future superpower disarmament
agreements.
   `My personal view is that we couldn't make any adjustments'' as
long as West Berlin is surrounded by large numbers of Soviet and
East German forces, Cheney said.
   Cheney said the U.S. ``engagement in Berlin will continue to see
Berlin stays free'' and he lauded ``the courage and determination''
of West Berliners who stand in ``an outpost of freedom in a sea of
communism.''
   He also called on Communist East Germany to tear down the Berlin
Wall, which he said ``continues to be a symbol of a ... philosophy
which leads to oppression of people.''
   The three allied powers _ the United States, Britain and France
_ have a total of 12,500 troops stationed in West Berlin. Active
duty U.S. forces number about 6,000.
   The Alternative List, the far-left partner in West Berlin's
coalition government, has called for a 10 percent reduction of
allied troops in the city.
   Cheney and West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg met
for two days in Bonn to discuss NATO defense needs in an age of
changing East-West relations.
   While in Bonn, Cheney also reiterated U.S. assurances that
chemical weapons would be removed from West Germany beginning next
year.

   The earthquake hit at 5:04 p.m. PDT, registered 7.1 on the
Richter scale and was centered on the San Andreas Fault 15 miles
northeast of Santa Cruz and 56 miles south of San Francisco in the
Santa Cruz Mountains.
   More than 4,500 aftershocks had been recorded, including one of
5.2 that came 40 minutes after the initial quake. There have been
20 of 4.0 or stronger, considered capable of causing moderate
damage.

   President Bush signed a $3.45 billion disaster aid package, with
most of it destined for Northern California.
   The immediate expenditure of $122 million in state funds to aid
local governments has been ordered by Gov. George Deukmejian, who
says a special session of the Legislature will be called to
consider a temporary increase in sales or gasoline tax to finance
relief.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency has received 21,400
applications so far.
   The Red Cross said Friday it has collected $5 million in
contributions; it has a goal of $20 million.

<HEAD>SAN JOSE: total democracy.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   You look at the changes that are taking place, that have taken
place in the last few years and that are likely to take place just
in the next few months, and it's very optimistic, and we want to be
a constructive part of helping with the debt problem that I heard a
lot about yesterday. We want to help, where we can, enhance
democracy and strengthen the concept of free elections.
   So, I wouldn't say dramatic change, but I think being here and
saying what I feel about the democracies here and trying to show
the respect we feel for those democracies is a good thing to have
done. ...
   Q. Oscar Arias invited here the democratically elected
presidents. Are you questioning his decision of inviting Daniel
Ortega?
   A. Well, I was a little surprised to feel that he was
democratically elected, though they reminded me that there was an
election. I'm not sure how certifiably free and fair it was, but it
was under that _ under that rubric that he was invited here. So,
who am I to question our host? I'm glad to be here myself.
   But it did seem a little odd, walking in in a military uniform
and, you know, coming in having pledged democracy to the
Organization of American States eight or nine years ago and
frustrating the democratic ambitions of his people. It wasn't
exactly the most comfortable fit. But no, I'm not questioning Mr.
Arias. He's the host, and he's been a generous host, and I'm very
glad we're here to salute Costa Rica's democracy. ...
   Q. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about another foreign
policy subject. There's very strong evidence that Israel is
involved in a joint project with South Africa to build a nuclear
missile. If that project should continue, what effect would it have
on U.S. relations with Israel?
   A. Well, we _ I hope our position is clear in transfer of any
military technology that should not be transferred. And if that's
taken place, it would not enhance relations between us or any
country that does that. It _ it would complicate things. There's no
question about that.
   Q. Another question on that same general subject, sir. Will the
United States give Isreal a veto over the identity of the
Palestinians in negotiations on elections in the occupied
territories?
   A. We are not _ we are not going with preconditions on _ we are
trying to be a catalyst, and whatever is worked out between the
parties will have our _ our generous and enthusiastic support. But
the Israelis have made clear that that would be very difficult for
them, so we're not trying to throw down a precondition. We're just
trying, through the Baker five points and through giving support to
President's Mubarak's 10 points, to be helpful in getting the talks
going. And the main thing is to talk, and I hope that they'll get
together. ...
   Q Mr. President, you mentioned that if there's an all-out
offensive, this would change the equation 180 degrees. What exactly
do you mean? Are you talking about more military aid again to the
contras?
   A. We'll let you know. We'll let you know. But I don't _ see _ I
don't want to get out ahead of where I think things may be right
now. You're pressing me to act as if there is a fait accompli and
all barriers are down and shooting starts on all sides. I don't
want to argue that that is what's going to take place. And _ but I
can tell you, a break of that agreement, and a renewal of all-out
fighting would be a very bad thing for Ortega, because I think the
whole world would see it as a direct breaking of his word, and then
we would see what kind of action is taken. ...

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   History placed Malcolm X and Martin Luther King
Jr. on opposite ends of a philosophical spectrum but their
daughters have found a middle ground.
   Yolanda King and Attallah Shabazz are co-founders of a theater
company, Nucleus, which tours the country with its production,
``Stepping Into Tomorrow,'' a play with a stay-in-school message
for young people.
   They live on opposite ends of the country _ Ms. King in Atlanta
and Ms. Shabazz in Los Angeles. This weekend's performances at the
Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change gave
them several days to get together as friends _ for the first time
in five years.
   ``Maybe we'll try to see a movie _ next week,'' Ms. King joked.
   Not everybody's father was one of the most important black
leaders of all time, one who led thousands with his own brand of
moral thought before being felled by an assassin's bullet.
   But that's the reality for both Ms. King and Ms. Shabazz.
   ``There's a bond between us because of the way in which our
fathers achieved their success,'' Ms. King said. ``Their notoriety
came through the people, the people being the least of these, the
left out and oppressed and exploited. So it's a different kind of
celebrity status.''
   The two men had vastly different views on ways to achieve
equality for blacks. King believed in black liberation through
passive resistance, and Malcolm X advocated violent confrontation
before he converted to traditional Islam and became El-Hajj Malik
El-Shabazz.
   But their daughters point out that their fathers did have one
meeting _ albeit brief _ in Washington in 1964. And Malcolm X went
to Selma, Ala., when King was jailed there, but prison officials
wouldn't let him visit, Ms. King said.
   ``The reality is that there was a real effort made to kind of
keep them separate,'' she said.
   ``I feel that there was a sense of brotherhood,'' Ms. Shabazz
said. ``I feel that there was an uncle in King for me.''
   The daughters met in New York in 1979, while both were trying to
eke out careers in the performing arts. They were introduced by a
writer friend who pointed out how much they had in common and
thought their getting together would make a heck of a story.
   ``After the guy invited us to do the interview, I said, `Oh
fine, sure. It is kind of coincidental that these commonalities
exist,''' Ms. King said. ``There was something there from the very
beginning.''
   But both were a little apprehensive.
   ``I was nervous. Just nervous, because this was Martin Luther
King's daughter, somebody famous, who is the child of someone you
admire,'' Ms. Shabazz said.
   ``And also a little concerned about what her impression of me
and my family might be, based on the perpetuation of how the public
always portrayed our parents _ Malcolm and Martin, at ends, at
odds, competing.''
   That interview led to offers to speak to young people, then the
creation of Nucleus. It also left them on the road, together, with
a lot of time to talk.
   ``It got rid of the formality,'' Ms. Shabazz said. ``We got to
hear about Daddy, not Malcolm or Martin. We got to hear about the
one ... who rode you on the back of the bicycle. It was moving for
us, something that kept bringing us together.''
   ``The fact that our fathers were assassinated ... puts us in a
different place in terms of the way people reach out,'' Ms. King
said. ``I think very few people could share that with me.''

   Just 36 hours after helping free Buck Helm
from the wreckage of the collapsed Nimitz Freeway in Oakland, two
rescue workers were busy seeking a missing hunter in the Sierra
Nevada.
   Jim Mendonsa and Don Stone have orchestrated countless rescues
as members of the Tuolumne County Search and Rescue Team, but never
has one followed so quickly on the heels of another.
   ``After awhile, the memory fades. But those two, back-to-back,
that's going to to be there forever. Certainly, it's an event of a
lifetime,'' Mendonsa said in a telephone interview Friday.
   Helm's rescue, after 85 hours beneath tons of concrete and steel
that had been a double-decker highway before the 7.1 magnitude
quake Oct. 17, was touted as a miracle. But Mendonsa, who with
Stone coordinated both rescues, found the less-publicized search
for hunter Lee Fetzer more challenging.
   ``For Lee, it was like looking for a needle in a haystack. For
Buck, the needle was right in front of you. It was just a matter of
reaching in and getting it,'' Mendonsa said.
   ``With Buck, once the medics got there, we knew we'd get him out
alive. With Lee, we weren't sure if we'd get him out alive.''
   Mendonsa and Stone had been back from Oakland for only a day and
a half, trying to recover from their exhaustive earthquake efforts,
when they received word Tuesday that Fetzer, 24, was missing in the
Stanislaus National Forest.
   Fetzer became lost after tracking a wounded buck into the woods
and got caught by a swift-moving storm that dumped 6 inches of snow
over the area. The odds of finding him in the large search area
5,000 feet above sea level were very slim after temperatures had
dropped to below freezing, Mendonsa said.
   Fetzer, an experienced hunter and volunteer firefighter, helped
himself by hiking to lower elevations away from the storm and found
shelter before nightfall each day, said Mendonsa. He was rescued on
Thursday.
   On the other hand, Mendonsa said he never doubted that the Helm
rescue would be successful, even though he was found in what
Mendonsa described as the most unstable part of the freeway.
   ``Frankly, I felt comfortable with it. I didn't do anything I
felt was unsafe,'' said Mendonsa. ``The only think that on occasion
would kind of pop up in the back of my mind was an aftershock.''

   Q. Just the second part of that _ why did Ortega do this, do you
think?
   A. I can't figure it out! It's an offense to the president of
Costa Rica. It is an offense to the democratically elected leaders
here. It is the most outrageous use of a meeting on democracy that
I can think of. I ask our own folks _ what in heaven's name would
make a person do something so counterproductive _ stick him out
like a sore thumb amongst a bunch of democratically elected
leaders, offend a host? And I'm sure it has _ you can ask Oscar
Arias, but if I were him, I would have been deeply offended by such
brutal disregard for the feelings of the _ sensitivities of this
meeting.
   So, I don't know what motivates this man. I did see him there
yesterday, and you know, I knew you all wanted to see the photos
and the confrontation. That's Boy Scout stuff. I mean, there's no _
you know, he wants to talk to me? Talk to the resistance. That's
what he agreed to do. That's who he ought to talk to. Don't go
sliding around for some photo opportunity that means nothing. ...
   Q. Mr. President, I just wanted to get one domestic policy
question in here _
   A. Fire!
   Q. At a time when you're endorsing and you're celebrating
self-determination abroad and you've endorsed state initiatives in
so many areas like education at home, how do you justify refusing
to allow District of Columbia residents to use their own local tax
money to fund abortions for poor women?
   A. I don't think public money ought to go for that, except in
the life of the mother. My position is so well-known there and they
can push me for political advantage every time they want to, and
they're going to be up against a brick wall. So let's forget it and
get on with helping the people in the District of Columbia. And
that's what they ought to do, and not try to play games to think
that one's going one-up or one-down on this very personal, very
difficult question of abortion.
   My position is spelled out, was defined, openly debated in the
elections a year ago _ maybe to this very day _ and I'm not
changing my position. And they know that. And if they think there's
political advantage in pushing me to the wall, fine. But the people
that are being victimized by those kinds of political games are the
people in the District of Columbia.
   Q. Mr. President, there seems to be a consensus that the
government that should be in power in Panama at this moment is Mr.
Endara's, since he won a fair election. However, hemispheric
presidents passed up the opportunity to recognize that government
last September. Could you explain why this happened?
   A. It happened because there was an action, the presidents
agreed to work with the OAS and to back _ strongly back the OAS
mission. And, in my view, the OAS mission failed in its mission,
and that was to get Noriega out of power and then go forward. Now
you're having some constructive suggestions by Felipe Gonzalez, the
prime minister of Spain, by others at the meeting here.
   But I can _ what'll be the next step I can't tell you. But it _
I am not _ put it this way, I am not totally frustrated about the
return of democracy to Panama. I think that the thing I sense from
these leaders is such solidarity with free and fair elections _ and
that was what happened in Panama _ that the handwriting is on the
wall for Mr. Noriega.
   But whether at this juncture recognition of that government
would be a constructive step or not, I'd want to talk to others.
It'd have to be done in concert with other nations to be
meaningful. And we are encouraging people not to give any kind of
formal recognition to the existing crowd by, you know, not having
their ambassadors there and all. ...
   Q. In your discussions here did you move in any sense a step
closer towards a drug summit? Did you get strong support on that?

   A. I made very clear in my comments yesterday that we look
forward to the _ having this Andean drug summit. Whether any plans
were finalized on it, I don't know. I'd have to ask our experts
whether _ could we have had some discussion of trying to pin down
with _ particularly with the Colombians what would be a good
timeframe for that. But I personally didn't go any further than
just saying we enthusiastically support the concept, and we will be
pleased to attend. ...
   Q. Have any of the others asked to get involved in the _
   A. Ah, not to me, they didn't. This _ this topic got a lot of
interest and discussion, but it didn't get into the modalities of
the summit that I know of, but maybe there was some
behind-the-scenes work with it. ...
   Q. (In Spanish).
   A. The second part of your question, no, I do not believe in
legalization. I am firmly opposed to it, and I salute Colombia for
its unwillingness to negotiate and bargain with these insidious
narco-traffickers. First part was on the summit, yes. I answered
that in English a second ago, but yes, I would be happy to attend
such a summit and I think it's worthwhile and I made that point
yesterday in my intervention.
   Q. Mr. President, I'd like to take you back to (the) question of
a moment ago about the reports of an Israeli-South African
collaberation on the missiles. Senior administration officials say
it's clear something is happening.
   A. On what's that?
   Q. On _ on Israeli-South African _ reports of Israeli-South
African collaboration on missiles _ transhipment of technology?
Administration officials say it's clear something is happening. I
want to know, sir, given this country's historical reluctance to
impose sanctions on Israel, what kind of leverage we have to deal
with the situation. What are you prepared to do?
   A. Well, you're asking me to accept a hypothesis that I'm not
accepting, but I've said that whoever it is, the transfer of
forbidden technology is taboo. We're not going to have that, and we
will find ways to assert that with any country that abuses the
system. ...
   Q Mr. President, President Sarney of Brazil said 24 hours (ago)
that he was very frustrated by the state of relations between the
United States and Latin America. He told us that he perceives that
Latin America is not a priority for the United States and that
democracy without economic vitality is not enough. As far as Panama
and Nicaragua, do you have an announcement to make to Latin
America, a positive announcement?
   A. Yeah, you know, I didn't _ I didn't detect that high level of
frustration on President Sarney's point. He made a very strong and
very _ an emotional appeal on the debt question, and I can
understand that. And we are trying to work with him. The one theme
I detected through this meeting was strong support for the Brady
plan and the fact that we have moved and the fact where it has
taken place, in Mexico, capital flight _ capital is coming back
into the country. By doing some of the necessary reforms, why, they
have _ for example, deregulation of transportation, they have
reduced the cost of transportation by about 30 percent, I am told.
So things are moving.
   But I _ I sensed an urgency by President Sarney. I can identify
with it, and we do want to be helpful. But I think he _ I had a
chance to talk with him last night. I think he was very pleased we
came. I think he was very pleased we are not, in the United States
or indeed Canada, neglecting our friends in this hemisphere. And so
I left with a pretty upbeat feeling, not a diminished feeling of
the importance of his problem, but in terms of the hemispheric
solidarity, you might say.
   But I _ your having phrased the question that way, I want to be
sure we're not missing a signal with him. He's going out of office
next year. He has done a good job under extraordinarily difficult
times. I went to his inauguration, and I don't think anybody ever
came into office in any country under more difficult _ difficult
times.
   So I would salute him and say, if he's frustrated about the
debt, I can understand it. But I'm not going to let that, nor
should he, in any way interfere with what I think are improving
relations with Brazil. Look over our shoulders, and it wasn't long
ago that Brazil did not have the democracy that President Sarney
has tried to perfect, even in spite of enormously difficult
economic times. ...

<HEAD>Quake Particularly Stressful For San Francisco's 3,000 AIDS Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS patient Gary Lee Brown has been told
he has just three to six months to live, but when the earthquake
hit he ran for his life like everybody else.
   ``I'm not giving up,'' the 30-year-old man said. ``I don't want
to die. I'm not ready to go.''
   Brown and others among this city's 3,000 AIDS patients suffered
special problems in the Oct. 17 earthquake.
   Already weakened by the virus, their immune systems made them
more susceptible to illness while huddled outside. The quake
provided another layer of stress atop the fear of dying. And
crucial home health services were disrupted as some nurses could
not reach their patients.
   On the positive side, Project Open Hand, which normally provides
1,500 meals per day to AIDS patients, expanded its normal services
by sending 47,600 meals to earthquake relief shelters in San
Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley in the past week.
   Brown, who weighs just 110 pounds and has trouble talking and
breathing, was lying in bed when the quake hit at 5:04 p.m. He
rushed outside because falling plaster from the walls and ceilings
made him fearful of remaining inside.
   But with his immune system nearly destroyed, Brown caught a cold
from spending four hours in his back yard. He suffers from what is
known as the wasting syndrome, in which he continually loses weight.
   His lover, Rick Echols, had to go back into their damaged
apartment to get Brown's oxygen bottle.
   Then Brown spent four days at the home of his lover's mother in
Sunnyvale, south of San Francisco, to escape the dust raised by the
collapsed plaster.
   ``I came back and went into shock again,'' said Brown, who has
had AIDS for two years. ``Six days after the quake, I went into the
emergency room.''
   Brown said he was lucky to have Echols' support.
   ``I was able to deal with it a lot better than most AIDS
patients,'' he said, especially those who were home alone.
   The quake stranded some bedridden patients without telephone
service or a nursing visit for more than a day, said Jacqueline
Mollema, supervisor of Visiting Nurses and Hospice of San
Francisco, which provides home care for 600 people, including 120
AIDS patients.
   ``In the first day we had absolutely no telephone contact with
our nurses or our patients,'' she said.
   But many nurses took it upon themselves to visit the most
seriously ill patients, and there were no reports of anyone hurt by
the delay in care, she said.
   Steven Petrow, spokesman for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation,
said AIDS hot lines were down for six days, making it hard for
patients to call in for help.
   The quake increased stress for AIDS sufferers at a time when
they are least able to handle it, Petrow said.
   ``If you are looking at someone with a life-threatening illness
and who may or may not be indigent, and factor in the earthquake,
you are looking at a very full palette,'' he said.
   Petrow also said the nearly $3.45 billion the federal government
quickly produced for disaster relief is much greater than the total
spent for AIDS programs this year.
   Spokesman James Brown of the U.S. Public Health Service said the
agency is spending $1.6 billion on AIDS programs annually and that
the total federal spending is just more than $2 billion.
   ``It heightens the low priority the federal government has given
to AIDS,'' Petrow said. ``We've had a natural disaster with this
epidemic for nine years in the city.''
   He also said that private AIDS organizations in the area would
likely be strapped for money as donations are channeled to the Red
Cross and other relief organizations.
   ``We are very concerned that we will see a big drop-off,''
Petrow said.
   Like others in the Bay area, AIDS patients were changed by the
quake.
   ``I don't think that I'll ever settle down from that,'' Brown
said. ``It doesn't help when the news says we haven't had the Big
One yet.''
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is caused by a
virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to death from infections and cancer. No one is known to
have recovered from AIDS.
   As of mid-October, AIDS had been diagnosed in 109,167 Americans,
of whom 64,849 have died, according to the national Centers for
Disease Control. The chief victims of AIDS in the United States
have been homosexual men and intravenous drug abusers.

   Q. One more?
   A. One more. This is the last _ it really is. We're in real
trouble on the time.
   Q. You said earlier on _
   A. (Aside) It's all right.
   Q. _ that the presidents last night leaned on Daniel Ortega.
Two-part question is, do you think Ortega, in fact, hurt himself by
what he did?
   A. Yes.
   Q. And do you think that it's incumbent now on President Arias
to publicly say so since there's one more ceremony left of this
meeting?
   A. I think that he hurt himself, because I think these leaders
here to celebrate democracy saw that this _ that this man is still
a bit of an outcast in the whole family around that table. And I
think that unconscionable election to hold that press conference
yesterday and _ as I say, maybe he's backed off a little. I want to
be fair, and he may have backed off about whether he stops the
cease-fire or whether he fails, you know, whether it doesn't
continue. There's _ I'm told there's a little trying to interpret
what he means by all that. But yes, he hurt himself very, very
badly, I think.
   And maybe _ maybe people will understand more clearly some of
the reservations we have when they see him violate the agreements
that mean so much to President Arias and to the other _ to the
other leaders that participate in the agreements. I think the
intervention by Cristiani, incidentally, yesterday, that nobody
disputed, of Ortega's continuing to subvert the Salvadoran
democracy, really was profound. It was _ you could hear a pin drop
when he said that, and _ because everyone knows it's true. And
everyone knows it's in direct violation of an agreement made.
   So I think he hurt himself, and whether it will reflect himself
in talks, I don't know. I do know that President Arias got a hold
of him last night and spoke very directly to him. And I'm told that
two other presidents _ you can guess about who they might be _ no,
you already had a question _ were _ spoke very, very frankly to him.
   Q. But if I may, the second part of my question _
   A. You've had two parts. This is the third part of a two-part
question?
   Q. I'm going for it. .ETX
   A. Okay.
   Q The second part was, shouldn't _ given that you've got 16
leaders here, shouldn't Mr. Arias say something publicly, not just
...
   A. I would hope he would, but I _ that's _ that's his call. I've
had a chance here, and I feel better for it.
   Q. Why do you keep calling him a little man?
   A. Because he is, that's why. (Laughter).
   Q. Thank you.

   The army fired scores of rockets at
guerrillas Saturday but failed for an eighth day to open the main
supply route to the capital. At least 22 guerrilla missiles killed
12 people and closed the airport, officials said.
   A diplomat who spent most of the day waiting for a flight said
air shipments from the Soviet Union had fallen Saturday to three,
down from the usual 30 per day.
   A doctor said rockets fired by U.S.-backed guerrillas on Friday
hit a base used to fire Scud missiles, killing six soldiers and
wounding 18.
   Markets again reported no deliveries of flour or fuel. Soldiers
of the Soviet-supported government were seen at several locations,
stopping taxi drivers and buying gasoline that has topped $16 a
gallon.
   Throughout the day, the capital was rocked by the vibrations of
departing government rockets shot north to the Salang highway, the
main supply route linking the capital with the Soviet border.
   Government soldiers with knowledge of the battles said the
northern part of the highway was held by Moslem rebels. They said
government forces were trying to regain parts of the southern half
of the road.
   More than 2,000 trucks carrying supplies for Kabul were reported
stuck on the highway north of the battles. Up until late last week
when it was closed, the Salang had been the only government-held
land route into the capital.
   Three other roads, to the east, south and west, have been
effectively closed to government trucks.
   The government-run nightly news said 22 rockets hit Kabul on
Saturday, killing 12 people and injuring 24. Government spokesman
Mohammed Nabi Amani said one hit a military base that houses the
women's militia headquarters, killing five women.
   Another missile hit a kindergarten and killed a young girl, said
Abdul Salam Jalalin, head of the children's hospital.
   More rockets landed near the Polytechnic University in northwest
Kabul, kicking up huge plumes of smoke. Several homes were
destroyed, but no deaths were reported.
   Witnesses said rockets also landed in a nearby military base,
but the government does not release data on military casualties in
Kabul.
   A doctor speaking on condition of anonymity said the Scud
missile base was hit Friday afternoon by several rockets. The base
is controversial because a U.S. intelligence report has alleged
that Soviet soldiers are operating the base.
   The Soviet Union said it pulled the last of its troops from
Afghanistan in February, ending a decade-long intervention.
   The doctor said six soldiers were killed and 18 were wounded in
the attack. All of them, he said, were Afghan soldiers.
   Since June, when rocket attacks on Kabul intensified, about 400
people have been killed and more than 900 injured. The government
blames the guerrillas, who say the government is rocketing its own
people.
   In Pakistan, the guerrillas' Afghan Press news agency reported
Friday that government planes bombed a 40-mile stretch of the
Salang highway to chase off guerrillas and allow U.N. supplies
headed for Kabul to get through. The guerrillas also claimed
government troops bombed and rocketed villages along the road.
   Government spokesman Amani denied it. ``We never rocket
villages,'' he said.
   A U.N. official said some of the supplies on the Salang were
from a U.N. aid shipment but that it only comprised several
truckloads.
   The guerrillas, who have been fighting the communist government
11 years, say they want to cut off all food and fuel to the capital
to force residents to flee. Then, they say they will increase their
attacks on the city.
   When asked where the flour is, merchants at the food markets
blow imaginary dust from their fingertips.
   ``It's gone with the wind'' said one trader.

<HEAD>Government Report Questions Value Of Sanctions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report requested by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
a strong supporter of economic sanctions against South Africa,
questions the value of such sanctions against South African gold.
   ``Even if enforcement were perfect, most sanctions against South
African gold might fail to generate substantial direct economic
pressure,'' the General Accounting Office said in the report, which
was released Saturday.
   Kennedy, D-Mass., is a staunch opponent of South Africa's
apartheid system of racial segregation and supports additional
sanctions against South Africa. He had asked the GAO to investigate
sanctions against gold and diamonds, both key exports from South
Africa.
   The interim report released Saturday dealt only with gold.
   In an accompanying press release, Kennedy characterized the
report as a ``significant breakthrough on the sanctions issue.''
   Asked to reconcile that description with Kennedy's position on
the sanctions issue, an aide cited one section of the report
dealing with discovery by a Commerce Department scientist of tests
that can trace the country of origin of refined gold.
   ``This technology gives us something we could not do before,''
said Kennedy aide David Smith.
   The report acknowledged that ``metals combined with gold in
jewelry manufacturing may render the test ineffective.''
   Kennedy would like to add jewelry made of South African gold to
the list of gold items banned in this country. Most South African
gold enters the United States in the form of jewelry, mostly made
in Italy, the report said. About $800 million to $900 million worth
of that jewelry is imported into the United States annually.
   Jewelry was excluded from a 1986 congressional ban in large part
because it is difficult to establish the source of gold in imported
jewelry, Kennedy's office said.
   As for the critical look at gold sanctions in general, Smith
said, ``We recognize both the porousness of sanctions and their
limits.''
   But he added that sanctions have political, symbolic, and
psychological effects such as lowering business confidence in the
economy. He said sanctions are one weapon out of several in the
fight against apartheid.
   Imports of gold Krugerrands and bullion are already banned.
Congressional opponents of apartheid, in addition to the jewelry
ban, are also mulling the idea of encouraging countries to release
South African gold from their central banks and forcing investors
to divest all holdings in South African gold mining shares.
   Throughout the report, however, the view of sanctions was gloomy.
   ``Even if there were no smuggling and other nations began to
adopt a ban on imports of bullion, South Africa could sell its gold
to many alternative markets,'' the report said.
   Gold accounts for 45 percent of South Africa's export earnings
and 10 percent of its government tax revenues, the GAO report said.
   ``Because the United States is the largest market for gold
jewelry in the world and a customer for over 50 percent of Italy's
jewelry exports, it might be able to exert some leverage on jewelry
makers to use non-South African gold,'' the report said. ``But
because the boycott would be directed at imports from
jewelry-producing countries rather than directly at South African
gold bullion, some chance exists'' that the United States would be
accused of violating international free trade agreements.
   If sanctions became so effective that mines began to close, ``it
would be difficult to reopen them in any post-apartheid society,''
the report said, noting that the pressure of the earth on the deep
mines would close them naturally.
   On current bullion sanctions, it said: ``Because little gold
bullion was imported into the United States directly from South
Africa prior to the ban and because knowledge of the boycott in the
gold market was not widespread, the ban has had little actual
impact reducing South African gold revenues or on the world price.''
   South Africa could legally avoid sanctions ``by developing
alternative markets and might benefit from unintentional
speculative price increases,'' the report said. ``Also, releasing
gold (from central banks) might harm other gold-producing nations
at least in the short term'' by depressing prices.
   Congress in 1986 banned imports of South African minerals,
metals, farm goods and products from government-owned or controlled
agencies.

   Thousands of pro-democracy protesters took to the
streets in two East German cities on Saturday, keeping up pressure
on the Communist government to adopt reforms.
   About 30,000 reform activists protested in Plauen, the state-run
news agency ADN said. ADN said another 6,000 marched in Greiz.
   ADN said marchers in both cities carried placards demanding free
elections, travel freedom and legalization of the pro-democracy
group New Forum.
   According to ADN, many in the Plauen march shouted, ``Enough
talk, we want action!''
   In Greiz, ADN said many protesters carried posters showing
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose reforms they support.
   Also Saturday, East Germany's new Communist leadership hinted at
further steps to decriminalize escape attempts to the West, a day
after tens of thousands demonstrated in at least six other cities
across the nation for pro-democracy reforms.
   Meanwhile, there were indications several East German political
parties allied with the ruling Communist Party are seeking greater
independence.
   Manfred Bogisch, a leader in East Germany's Liberal Democratic
Party, wrote in the party newspaper Der Morgen Saturday that a
``multi-party system can only work when the political parties act
and are true'' to their platforms.
   West Germany's ZDF television network late Friday said it had
information that the Liberal Democrats and another Communist-allied
party, the Christian Democrats, want to pull out of the National
Front, the union of parties under Communist dominance.
   According to ZDF, the two parties want to campaign for more
seats in Parliament based on vote totals and not on a quota system
set by the Communist Party.
   The calls for greater political independence came one day after
the Communist government announced important concessions and after
thousands took to the streets to demand reforms.
   The demonstrations in Dresden, Karl-Marx-Stadt, Senftenberg,
Saalfeld, Guestrow and Grossraeschen late Friday came despite a
government decision to grant an amnesty for demonstrators, for
people who have left the country illegally, and for thousands who
were jailed for trying to escape.
   The amnesty was the the most dramatic move that Egon Krenz has
taken since he became Communist Party chief on Oct. 18, replacing
hard-line leader Erich Honecker.
   The government said people who remain in the West after
officially permitted trips are finished will be able to return home
later without fear of prosecution.
   The government also said it will restore free travel to
Czechoslovakia as of Nov. 1. Restrictions were imposed Oct. 3 to
stop a rush of East Germans to the West German Embassy in Prague,
where they demanded to be allowed to go West.
   Travel restrictions have been among the most bitter complaints
of East Germans. The new government has also promised to allow East
Germans greater travel freedoms to the West.
   About 60,000 East Germans have gone to West Germany since July
via Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary.
   By extending leniency to people who left the country illegally,
the government clears the way for them to return without facing
criminal prosecution.
   The amnesty covers incidents through Friday, and all prisoners
included in the act will be released by Nov. 30, the government
said. About 4,000 people are believed jailed for trying to flee
West.
   The country's prosecutor-general, Guenter Wendland, said future
laws were still under discussion, ``but it is already quite certain
that the regulation to prosecute those who don't return from
allowed trips will not be in the amended law.''
   Neues Deutschland, the Communist Party's official newspaper,
hinted in a commentary Saturday that attempted escape might be
further decriminalized if violence or force was not a factor.
   ``The amnesty and the new travel law that is being worked out
will require changes in the law relating to illegal flight,'' the
newspaper said.
   A liberal travel law, coupled with a decision not to prosecute
those who leave and then decide to return, would largely eliminate
the need for daring escapes across the border.
   The government said the amnesty also included people charged
with taking part in illegal street protests during weeks of turmoil.

   Armed bandits made off with a priceless
ancient Greek and Roman coin collection after locking two museum
guards in a broom closet, officials said Saturday.
   Armed with a pistol and a screwdriver, the thieves demanded
Friday night to be taken to the gallery where a celebrated 15th
century painting by Antonello da Messina was displayed.
   When they discovered the sophisticated alarm system protecting
the masterpiece, they chose instead to steal the 250 silver and
gold coins.
   Investigators, who searched for clues in the case Saturday,
guessed the criminals were working for someone else.
   The coins date from the 5th century B.C. and were minted in the
ancient Sicilian cities of Cefalu, Agrigento, Taormina and Siracuse
as well as the nearby island of Lipari. The collection is
considered second in importance only to a similar one in London.
   The museum's director, Franco d'Anna, told the Italian news
agency ANSA the crooks will have difficulty unloading their loot,
since the coins are well catalogued in various art books and
collectors' manuals.

<HEAD>Medicare Premiums to Rise Next Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The insurance premium that the nation's 33
million Medicare beneficiaries pay to cover doctor bills will rise
to $29 a month in 1990, the Department of Health and Human Services
announced this weekend.
   The 1989 rate is $27.90 per month.
   Congress has decreed that 25 percent of Medicare Part B costs _
the physician fee benefit program _ be covered by beneficiary
premiums. The other 75 percent is financed from general tax funds.
   The premium is calculated annually based on program costs. The
$1.10 increase was in line with previous estimates.
   Because the program is so heavily subsidized, about 98 percent
of those eligible purchase the insurance. The monthly payments are
deducted from their Social Security checks.
   HHS also announced that the monthly catastrophic insurance
premium, which is on top of the $29, will rise to $4.90 from $4
beginning Jan. 1. That $4.90 figure, like the basic premium, had
been used in earlier projections.
   The department announced earlier that the hospital deductible, a
fee a Medicare beneficiary pays no more than once a year if
hospitalized, is rising from $560 this year to $592 in 1990. Also
calculated annually, the deductible is pegged to costs and
represents the average cost of a one-day hospital stay.

   Academy Award-winning director Jean-Jacques
Annaud knew what he wanted when he set out to find the lead
character for his acclaimed new movie, ``The Bear.''
   ``I was looking for a John Wayne kind of character,'' Annaud
said. His star is Bart, a 9-foot-2-inch Kodiak bear.
   ``I knew immediately Bart was the bear I was looking for because
he was very reliable, very impressive,'' Annaud said in Friday's
New York Times.
   Annaud, who won an Oscar in 1976 for ``Black and White in
Color'' and also directed ``Quest for Fire'' and ``The Name of the
Rose,'' based the new movie on a 1916 book, ``The Grizzly King,''
by James Oliver Curwood.
   He wanted to make ``a film that would be honest to animal
nature, that would be an adventure film, or thriller, in which an
animal would be the hero.''
   ``I read this novel through the eyes of the hunted, through the
eyes of the victim,'' Annaud said, who found Bart through Utah
animal trainer Doug Seus. ``I saw it was the perfect structure for
having an exciting animal story with all the good ingredients for
movie entertainment, as well as describing what is common to human
psychology and animal psychology.''

   Soccer star Diego Maradona lost some of his
prized trophies and jewels belonging to his financee when his
safety deposit box was robbed during a bank heist.
   Friday's bank robbery at the Banca di Provincia di Napoli was
carried out by a gang of 11 thieves armed with pistols, officials
said. The group entered the bank through a sewer system which runs
underneath the building.
   The robbers held bank employees hostage while cash tills and
safety deposit boxes, including two belonging to Maradona, were
emptied.
   Maradona's friends confirmed that the boxes included some of his
prized soccer trophies _ including the Golden Football presented to
him three years ago by France Football _ and jewels belonging to
his fiancee, Claudia Villafane.
   But they declined to confirm reports estimating Maradona's loss
at nearly $720,000.
   Maradona reportedly was philosophical about the theft, saying,
``A bad day, but the important thing is we're all in good health.''
   Also Friday, the Argentine soccer star of Naples was fined
$7,200 by the Italian soccer tribunal for criticizing a referee
following a championship match.

   American composer and conductor John
Harbison, who won the Pulitzer Prize for music in 1987, was
appointed creative chairman of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra.
   Harbison, who won the Pulitzer for his cantata ``The Flight into
Egypt,'' will replace John Adams for the 1990-91 season, officials
announced at the orchestra's annual meeting Friday.
   Adams, whose initial appointment of one year in 1988 was
extended through this season, said he was relinquishing his
position to work on other projects.
   Adams said he wants to complete his opera, ``The Death of
Klinghoffer,'' about the hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro.
   Harbison, 50, will share artistic oversight of the orchestra
with music director Christopher Hogwood and principal conductor
Hugh Wolff.
   Harbison, from Orange, N.J., studied at Harvard, Princeton and
the Berlin Hochschule fur Musik. In 1969, he joined the faculty of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He served as
composer-in-residence for the Pittsburgh Symphony from 1982 to
1984, and for the Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1985 to 1988.

<HEAD>Government Increases Reward For Drug Traffickers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Saturday offered
$600,000 for the capture of either of Colombia's two most powerful
drug lords, more than doubling the previous reward.
   The higher reward was offered in television advertisements run
by the government, which has been trying for 10 weeks to crack the
highest levels of Colombia's powerful and feared cocaine cartels.
   The government previously had offered $250,000 for the capture
of either Pablo Emilio Escobar-Gaviria or Jose Gonzalo
Rodriguez-Gacha, the leaders of the huge Medellin cocaine cartel.
   The television spots, run nationwide, show a wanted poster with
mug shots of the two suspects. The ad offers $606,000 for the
capture of either man.
   The government of President Virgilio Barco has extradited four
Colombians to the United States since the drug war began Aug. 18,
and nine more are awaiting extradition.
   However, all are middle-ranking traffickers. None is on a U.S.
Justice Department list of the 12 most-wanted Colombian
traffickers, a list topped by Escobar and Rodriguez.
   U.S. officials in Colombia have said they believe Escobar,
Rodriguez and other top members of the Medellin cartel are still in
Colombia.
   The fugitives, the officials have said, are protected by bribes,
fierce loyalty of people they have helped and by outright fear of
people who think they will be signing their own death warrants if
they try to collect the reward.
   The government declared war on traffickers following the Aug. 18
assassination of leading presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan.
Drug traffickers in turn have waged an almost daily campaign of
bombings and killings of officials and journalists in an effort to
intimidate the government into ending its crackdown.
   Meanwhile, 10 young people were killed in the Medellin area
Friday night, including five women whose bodies were thrown from
moving cars, police there said Saturday.
   Earlier this week, the bodies of seven teen-agers who had been
shot to death were found in Medellin, the recruiting ground for
drug traffickers' private armies.
   All of the 17 killed were between the ages of about 17 and 21, a
Medellin police spokesman said.
   The bodies of the young women were thrown from cars in the
fashionable neighborhood of El Poblado shortly after midnight
Friday, the police spokesman said, asking not to be named.
   Earlier, gunmen walked into a bar in the town of Bello, on the
outskirts of Medellin, opened fire with pistols and killed three
young men, the spokesman said.
   Two more bodies of young men were found in Bello tossed along a
roadside, the policeman said.
   Interviews with gang members in the past in Medellin have shown
that the gangs are trying to prove which are the most powerful and
to emulate the Medellin cartel's leaders, especially Escobar.
   Escobar started out in Medellin as a pickpocket and car thief.
Forbes magazine ranks him as having between $2 billion and $3
billion.
   Rodriguez, also a billionaire, was a pig farmer before he got
into the cocaine business.
   The apparent gang war killings came just hours after a young man
with a submachine gun killed a state government official in
Medellin.
   The victim was Gabriel Jaime Santamaria, the vice president of
the Antioquia state assembly and the state leader for the leftist
Patriotic Union party.
   Santamaria was the 737th member of the party to be killed by
death squads that the attorney general's office says are run by
drug traffickers.
   Drug traffickers are attacking party members in revenge for
attempts by leftist guerrillas to kidnap and ransom traffickers and
their families, the attorney general's office has said.
   Meanwhile, bombings by drug traffickers have become so frequent
that they are largely played down or ignored by Colombia's
newspapers.
   Two bombs Friday night that killed one person and injured two
others got little attention in Bogota's five daily newspaper's
Saturday. Three newspapers didn't even publish news of the
bombings, and two others put the news on their inside pages.
   One bomb went off at the private Guaymaral airport on the
northern outskirts of Bogota, police said Saturday in a communique.
The bomb, in a bathroom at the airport headquarters for narcotics
police, killed a policeman, the communique said.
   There have now been 171 bombings with 22 people killed and 220
injured since the drug war began.

Saturday, causing property damage but no injuries, police said.
   A police report said the explosion at around 1 a.m. destroyed
the garage and part of the house of Diogenes Cruz, a 48-year-old
sports commentator for the newspaper El Heraldo and the
privately-owned HRN radio network.
   Neither Cruz, who is also congressman for the governing Liberal

the attack.
   The police report said the bomb, apparently a homemade device,
was thrown at Cruz's home from a speeding automobile.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister Tells Nixon That U.S.-China Ties Must Be Repaired</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen toasted former
President Richard Nixon on Saturday for restoring ties between
their nations 17 year ago and said the relationship must now be
mended in the interests of world peace.
   Qian spoke at a welcoming banquet for Nixon on the first evening
of his private visit to China as a guest of the government.
   The visit is Nixon's sixth to China, beginning with the 1972
trip that began a rapproachment after decades of hostility. It is
his most low-key ever, with even his schedule and length of stay a
secret.
   Reporters were kept at a distance at the Beijing airport when
Nixon arrived on a commercial flight and was greeted by Vice
Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu. He made no statement and was whisked
off in a waiting car to the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.
   ``The overall interests of safeguarding world peace and the
long-term interests of our two countries ... require us to make a
success of Chinese-U.S. relations,'' the official Xinhua News
Agency quoted Qian as saying in his banquet toast.
   ``Chinese-U.S. relations are at a crossroads,'' he said. ``We
sincerely hope that the U.S. government will weigh the pros and
cons and take a forward-looking approach so that Chinese-U.S.
relations may return to the track of normal development at an early
date.''
   Qian's comments were milder and more hopeful than any other
recent government statements, most of which have bitterly accused
the United States of interfering in Chinese affairs.
   The United States has criticized China's use of the army in June
to crush student pro-democracy protests and its subsequent arrests
of thousands of protesters and dissidents. It also has given refuge
in its embassy in Beijing to two well-known dissidents, Fang Lizhi
and his wife, Li Shuxian, and has told tens of thousands of Chinese
studying in the United States that they can overstay their visas
for one year if they fear political persecution at home.
   Qian blamed the United States for the current tension, but only
indirectly, and emphasized common ground.
   ``The present difficulties in Chinese-U.S. relations are not
what we would like to see nor what we have created,'' he said.
   ``Differences between China and the United States in social
system, ideology and other aspects do not necessarily hinder the
establishment and development of normal friendly relations.''
   Xinhua usually only summarizes and paraphrases banquet toasts
but it quoted Qian at length, indicating the government intends his
remarks to be seen as an important statement of policy toward
Washington.
   Xinhua said Nixon described himself as a ``friend of China,''
and expressed concern about relations.
   He said ties between countries could not be based solely on
friendship, and that U.S.-Chinese relations were essential to both
sides because of shared interests.
   ``A strong and stable China also is very essential to world
peace, and the two countries' ties should be safeguarded and
strengthened,'' Xinhua, which only summarized Nixon's toast,
paraphrased him as saying.
   Nixon is the most prominent American to visit China since the
June crackdown. President Bush has halted all high-level official
exchanges. However, Nixon's spokesman, John Taylor, said the former
president would report to Bush after his trip.

   Just 36 hours after helping free Buck Helm
from the wreckage of the collapsed Nimitz Freeway in Oakland, two
rescue workers were busy seeking a missing hunter in the Sierra
Nevada.
   Jim Mendonsa and Don Stone have orchestrated countless rescues
as members of the Tuolumne County Search and Rescue Team, but never
has one followed so quickly on the heels of another.
   ``After awhile, the memory fades. But those two, back-to-back,
that's going to to be there forever. Certainly, it's an event of a
lifetime,'' Mendonsa said in a telephone interview Friday.
   Helm's rescue, after four days beneath tons of concrete and
steel that had been a double-decker highway before the 7.1
magnitude quake Oct. 17, was touted as a miracle. But Mendonsa, who
with Stone coordinated both rescues, found the less-publicized
search for hunter Lee Fetzer more challenging.
   ``For Lee, it was like looking for a needle in a haystack. For
Buck, the needle was right in front of you. It was just a matter of
reaching in and getting it,'' Mendonsa said.
   ``With Buck, once the medics got there, we knew we'd get him out
alive. With Lee, we weren't sure if we'd get him out alive.''
   Mendonsa and Stone had been back from Oakland for only a day and
a half, trying to recover from their exhaustive earthquake efforts,
when they received word Tuesday that Fetzer, 24, was missing in the
Stanislaus National Forest.
   Fetzer became lost after tracking a wounded buck into the woods
and got caught by a swift-moving storm that dumped 6 inches of snow
over the area. The odds of finding him in the large search area
5,000 feet above sea level were very slim after temperatures had
dropped to below freezing, Mendonsa said.
   Fetzer, an experienced hunter and volunteer firefighter, helped
himself by hiking to lower elevations away from the storm and found
shelter before nightfall each day, said Mendonsa. He was rescued on
Thursday.
   On the other hand, Mendonsa said he never doubted that the Helm
rescue would be successful, even though he was found in what
Mendonsa described as the most unstable part of the freeway.
   ``Frankly, I felt comfortable with it. I didn't do anything I
felt was unsafe,'' said Mendonsa. ``The only think that on occasion
would kind of pop up in the back of my mind was an aftershock.''

<HEAD>Bush Warns Against Illegal Transfer of Missile Technology</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Saturday that
transfers of forbidden technology are ``taboo'' and ``it would not
enhance relations'' if Israel had defied the United States to help
South Africa develop an intermediate-range missile.
   ``It would complicate things, there's no question about that,''
Bush said at a news conference winding up a two-day meeting with
Western Hemispheric leaders.
   Bush did not confirm or deny reports that Israel has assisted
the South African missile program in return for a steady supply of
uranium.
   The president said, ``I hope our position is clear in transfer
of any military technology that should not be transferred. And if
that's taken place, it would not enhance relations between us or
any country that does that.''
   Asked if the United States might impose sanctions against Israel
or take other steps, he said, ``You're asking me to accept a
hypothesis that I'm not accepting.
   ``But I have said that whoever it is, the transfer of forbidden
technology is taboo. We're not going to have that. And we will find
ways to assert that with any country that abuses the system.''
   On another topic, Bush was asked if the United States would give
Israel veto power over what Palestinians can take part in
negotiations on elections for the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
   ``We're not trying to throw down a precondition,'' Bush replied.
``We're just trying, through the Baker five points and through
giving support to (Egyptian President Hosni) Mubarak's 10 points,
to be helpful in getting the talks going,'' Bush said.
   In Jerusalem, Israel radio reported Saturday that Baker had
agreed to modify his proposed five-point framework for getting the
two sides to the table to discuss elections.
   The state radio gave no details, but said the changes followed
almost a week of intensive contacts between Baker and Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens over the peace offer.
   Arens had written Baker earlier insisting the plan be modified
to drop Cairo as the site for preliminary Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks, and that exiled Palestinians be barred from participating.
Arens also demanded that the discussion be limited to discussing
Israel's election plan for the occupied territories, not the
Palestinians' desire for an independent state.
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman refused to confirm or deny
the radio report.
   Baker said in Washington on Wednesday that, ``we want to do
everything we can to try and move things forward, and therefore we
will review the suggested changes that we have received.'' But he
added, ``It would be much better if both sides would accept the
five points as a general framework for moving forward.''

<HEAD>Teachers Union Chief Calls For End to `Misleading' Standardized Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers union leader Albert Shanker called
Saturday for an immediate end to multiple-choice standardized
achievement testing, saying the results are misleading and may even
be hindering school reform.
   Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, made
the radical suggestion after a speech at the Educational Testing
Service's 50th Invitational Conference in which he said many school
districts are apparently shying away from reform ideas for fear
they might drag down standardized test scores.
   ``I would call for an immediate end to standardized tests as
they are now,'' Shanker told reporters.
   ``What you need to do is test for things that are really
important: reading, writing, computing, history,'' he said. ``To
test for depth of knowledge, you have to get away from things that
are machine-gradeable.''
   He suggested that schools should demand, and publishers produce,
new tests that measure ability to perform higher-level academic or
intellectual tasks such as writing sensible essays or computing
multi-step math problems.
   Such tests, he said, might resemble the National Assessment of
Educational Progress exams, congressionally mandated tests taken
periodically by thousands of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds measuring
ability to read, write and compute at different levels of
sophistication.
   Children are being tested far too frequently, Shanker added. He
suggested that if students were tested at five-year intervals,
instead of every year or so, educators might feel freer to innovate
to better suit individual student needs.
   Shanker stressed that he was not ``anti-test.'' He in fact
cautioned against siding with anti-test groups because the public
would conclude that school officials were simply trying to escape
accountability. But he nonetheless expressed strong agreement with
many of the test critics' arguments in his address before 650
educators and testing experts.
   He cited, for example, a recent study by Dr. John J. Cannell
showing that 48 states and some 80 percent of local districts are
reporting misleadingly ``above average'' standardized test scores.
That phenomenon has come to be called the ``Lake Wobegon Effect''
after the mythical setting of author Garrison Keillor where,
supposedly, ``all children are above average.''
   Tests cited by Cannell as being misleading include the
California Achievement Test, the Stanford Achievement Test, the
Metropolitan Achievement Test, the Science Research Associates
Test, the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills and the Iowa Test of
Basic Skills.
   But Shanker did not extend his call for cessation of
multiple-choice standardized testing to the Scholastic Aptitude
Test, the college entrance exam taken each year by some 1.6 million
high school students.
   He said the SAT did not have nearly the negative impact of other
standardized achievement testing on school curricula. But he said
was concerned that the SAT may sometimes act as a learning
``disincentive'' to some students who figure that they don't have
to study hard as long as they do well on the exam.
   The Educational Testing Service administers the SAT.
   ETS president Gregory Anrig, in his opening address, agreed that
there was an ``overreliance'' on standardized tests in the name of
reform.
   He later told reporters that ETS was in the midst of revamping
the SAT away from the purely multiple-choice format. The new SAT,
to be unveiled in 1994, might include essay questions and math
problems to be solved without multiple-choice answers.
   Other conference speakers echoed Shanker's concerns over the
magnified role of testing in the current school reform movement.
   ``Most current tests are working against the very reforms now
required in our educational system,'' said Lauren B. Resnick,
director of the Learning Research &amp; Development Center at the
University of Pittsburgh.
   Typical standardized tests demand bits of information rather
than reasoning.
   Tests perform the function of ``sorting and gatekeeping,'' but
often stop there, said Sharon Robinson, director of instruction and
professional Development at the National Education Association. The
result is ``limiting expectations and opportunity rather than
expanding them.''

<HEAD>Liquor Store Owner Turns Against Booze</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLRAIN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A liquor store owner took a stand against
drinking by selling the contents of her shop Saturday in a benefit
for charity.
   Fay Wood says she was auctioning off the inventory of her liquor
store on the condition that the buyers empty the whiskey, rye and
scotch bottles onto the ground.
   Wood decided to close her store in April after hearing a man
speak at a church meeting about the number of people killed by
drunken drivers.
   ``It was a real confirmation of what I was feeling. I knew after
that I had to go back and close the store,'' she said Thursday.
   She returned to Streeter's Package Store, the liquor store she
has run for three years and the only one in this western
Massachusetts town, and told a helper to turn off the refrigerator
and close up early.
   ``She thought I had gone off the deep end,'' Wood said.
   Until then, Wood had felt it was her customers' own business if
they wanted to drink, even though she stopped drinking alcohol in
1984.
   Wood, who also has a hair salon, says she will use proceeds from
the auction to open a retreat for AIDS patients and their
care-givers in southern Vermont.

   Mahatma Gandhi told him how to meditate.
Adolf Hitler taught him how to work in a society of fear. Now,
journalist William Shirer is tackling the mystery of Leo Tolstoy,
who walked into the Moscow night and never returned.
   At 85, Shirer could bask in the memories of a career spanning
such milestones as Lindbergh's transatlantic landing in Paris,
Gandhi's India and World War II. But the author of ``The Rise and
Fall of the Third Reich,'' is too busy planning his next projects
to think about retirement.
   ``In a sense a writer never stops. He probably should,'' Shirer
joked. ``It's awfully difficult to stop, you know, as long as you
have your marbles.''
   In five years, Shirer says, he may give up his daily routine of
writing each morning in a Berkshire house stacked to the ceilings
with books, papers and the diaries he used to write most of 15
books.
   But until then there's a book to be written about why Tolstoy
walked out on his wife at age 82, dying a few days later. It's a
question that has tantalized Shirer for 20 years.
   ``How could this happen to such a great man?'' he says.
   The journalist, who proudly shows a visitor his back yard plot
glowing with color and says he still likes to sail when his health
permits, has lived quietly in the Berkshires since a brief second
marriage in the 1970s.
   In 1987, he married again, this time to his 50-year-old Russian
teacher, Irina Lugovskaya, who is helping him with the Tolstoy
research.
   In a recent interview, Shirer recalled his career, starting in
1925 with a trip to Europe after graduation from Coe College in
Iowa.
   ``All the students that year were going to Paris,'' he recalled.
``America at that time had Prohibition and Coolidge was in the
White House with his inane ideas if any.''
   The night before he planned to return to the United States,
Shirer was hired by the Paris office of The Chicago Tribune. He was
later fired and was again on the brink of returning when CBS radio
hired him.
   Shirer's memoirs of covering Hitler's Germany, ``The Nightmare
Years,'' were recently made into a Turner Network Television
miniseries of the same name, starring Sam Waterston as Shirer and
Marthe Keller as Tess, Shirer's first wife.
   Part of the nightmare was the dangerous task of getting
information about the Third Reich, he said.
   ``A lot of our work was contacts with the opposition which
wasn't very much,'' he said. ``We had to get out and get the story
from pastors and priests and bishops and people like that.''
   And, he says he wasn't always successful in convincing American
editors about the horrors of the events unfolding in Europe.
Shortly before war broke out, he was scheduled to do a feature on a
dance festival, but balked at the assignment.
   ``It was the most horrible taste in the world,'' he said.
   Shirer, who covered India before going to Germany said Gandhi,
who tried to teach him meditation, provided a great contrast to
Hitler.
   ``It's sort of ironic that in my journalistic career that the
two great men that I spent most of my life covering were Gandhi and
Hitler. Both of them genuises, but Hitler an evil genius,'' he said.
   He experienced the German leader's famed charisma firsthand at
an art lecture in Nuremberg in 1934.
   ``It was a gloomy, dank church it was Sunday evening and he was
talking about art, about which he knew absolutely nothing except
that it was bad and for two hours he spoke without a note and he
held this audience absolutely,'' Shirer said.
   By 1940 it was time to get out of Berlin and Shirer went,
becoming a radio commentator for CBS.

   Jimmy Swaggart's dalliances with a prostitute
got him tossed out of the Assemblies of God in 1988, but several
church organizations have closed ranks behind the fallen television
evangelist in front of the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Swaggart's lawyers hope to persuade the nation's highest court
Tuesday to overturn rulings that forced the Louisiana-based Jimmy
Swaggart Ministries to pay California $183,000 in back taxes and
interest for the years 1974 through 1981. They will argue that the
California tax on Bibles, religious literature, recordings and
other items sold by the Ministries violates religious freedom.
   No other state has such a tax, Swaggart's attorneys say.
   The National Council of Churches, the Evangelical Council of
Financial Accountability, Prison Fellowship, the National Tax
Payers Union, the Association for Public Justice, and other groups
have filed briefs on Swaggart's behalf, said William Treeby,
Swaggart's New Orleans lawyer.
   ``Churches beyond the Jimmy Swaggart Ministries realize this
issue carries broad implications that would chill, if not totally
end the dissemination of religious messages, especially across
state lines,'' said Treeby.
   ``If the court says you can impose this tax it will have a
dramatic effect on all churches,'' said Charles R. Ajalat, the Los
Angeles lawyer representing Swaggart. ``It's a very important First
Amendment case. They're talking about taxing Bibles, religious
service tapes and religious music. The sales of these items are
really people making donations to the ministry.''
   California, however, claims that sales of tangible property are
not protected by the Constitution whether they are made by a shop
or a church.
   ``If a Bible is sold in a bookstore, it's taxed. That's the same
as if a church sells it. Donations are tax-exempt. They can make
all the donations they want, but when they start buying and selling
it's another matter,'' said Gary Jugum, assistant chief counsel to
the California Board of Equalization.
   When Swaggart Ministries sells the Bible, Treeby says, it's
different.
   ``A book store is in the business for profit; Jimmy Swaggart
Ministries is a non-profit organization,'' he said.
   In earlier appeals, which were rejected by the California
Supreme Court, Swaggart admitted that some items the ministry sold
were subject to the tax, Jugum said. Those items included mugs,
bowls, plates, pen and pencil sets, bud vases, Communion cups,
candlesticks, replicas of Roman coins, T-shirts bearing the
ministry's logo and plastic replicas of the crown of thorns and Ark
of the Covenant.
   ``Where do you draw the line? If you put words from the Bible on
a coffee mug is that taxable or is it a symbol of religious
freedom? That's the danger here,'' said Jugum.
   For the years at issue, California and Swaggart Ministries
estimate that sales from Baton Rouge, La., to California consumers
totaled $1.7 million. Sales of merchandise at California crusades
totaled $240,000.
   California has not taxed the ministry since 1982, pending
appeal, but if the Supreme Court rules against the ministry, it
must pay the state taxes based on its sales over the past seven
years.
   Swaggart's Baton Rouge-based ministry was once estimated by
local officials to be a $150 million industry. That changed in
February 1988 when Swaggart confessed to ``moral failure.''
   Although Swaggart never gave specifics, a rival minister said
the transgression involved liaisons with a New Orleans prostitute.
Swaggart was later defrocked by the Assemblies of God.
   Swaggart's ministry is leaner now _ construction projects at his
$10 million complex were halted after many television stations
stopped carrying his programs _ but it still remains a big industry
in Baton Rouge.
   Ministry officials won't discuss specifics but tourism and
convention officials said visitors are still drawn to the Baton
Rouge area to attend camp meetings and revivals.

<HEAD>American Congressmen Urge Freedom for Hostages, Meet Lebanese Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two U.S. representatives on Saturday
tried to persuade Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun to accept an
Arab League-sponsored peace plan. They also urged kidnappers
holding Western hostages to free the men.
   Democratic Reps. Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio and Nick Rahall of West
Virginia, both of Lebanese descent, arrived in Lebanon on Saturday
and held a three-hour meeting with Aoun in the bunker of the
shell-shattered presidential palace in Baabda.
   The announced reason for the trip was to discuss with Aoun the
peace accord approved a week ago by a special session of the
Lebanese Parliament in Taif, Saudi Arabia. It would shift political
power to the Moslem majority and clear the way for election of a
president.
   Aoun has rejected the accord for not setting a timetable for the
withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and refuses to accept
results of an election held in Syrian-controlled territory.
   The State Department told the politicians their lives could be
in danger in Lebanon, where eight American hostages are held. The
hostage held longest, Terry Anderson, passed his fifth birthday in
captivity Friday.
   ``While our State Department does not approve of this trip of
ours. ... they did state that they did not mind us coming and
speaking with Gen. Aoun,'' said Rahall.
   Ms. Oakar said Aoun agreed with much of the peace plan, ``but
there's some missing link,'' she said, without elaborating.
   Thousands of Aoun supporters met the two representatives at the
palace, carrying placards that read: ``The U.S. administration
supports the Taif conspiracy against free people'' and ``We need
support and not intelligence compounds,'' an apparent reference to
the U.S. Embassy that closed last month.
   In an address to the throng, Aoun said he would not honor
presidential elections outside Lebanon's Christian enclave.
   ``Any president elected outside Lebanon will be president for
those who elected him and any president elected in (Syrian)
occupied Lebanese territory will be sa urrogate of theirs, but only
the one elected here will become president for all Lebanon,'' he
said, referring to the enclave north of Beirut that is controlled
by his army.
   Aoun's stance on the elections complicates efforts to arrange
for balloting within the period proposed by an Arab League
mediation committee, which is no later than Nov. 7.
   Aoun did not say whether he would reject an election held in the
no-man's land of Beirut's dividing Green Line, which is controlled
by neither his troops nor the Syrians and which houses the current
Parliament.
   Rahall also announced that efforts are under way to reopen the
American Embassy in Beirut.
   ``We want to return our ambassador and reopen our embassy in
this country and that's the first visible step of showing (our)
commitment,'' said Rahall.
   Washington pulled Ambassador John McCarthy and 29 other
diplomats from east Beirut on Sept. 6 after Aoun accused the United
States of supporting the presence of 40,000 Syrian troops in
Lebanon, who were deployed in 1976 to quell the civil war.
   The general has accused the United States of selling Lebanon to
Syria out of fear for the lives of the Americans held hostage in
Lebanon.
   After speaking with Aoun, the Americans crossed into Moslem west
Beirut, where they held talks with acting Prime Minister Salim
Hoss, who heads a Moslem Cabinet vying for legitimacy with Aoun's.
   Ms. Oakar paid special tribute to Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who marked his 42nd
birthday in captivity Friday. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   ``I want to make a special plea for Terry and the others if I
can,'' she said. ``We call on anybody that has any influence upon
the hostage takers to release them.''
   There are a total of 18 Westerners held hostage in Lebanon.

<HEAD>Italy Demands Full Investigation of Slaying of Italian</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy said Saturday it was prepared to take the
``consequent decisions'' in the case of an Italian who was shot and
set on fire in Libya during anti-Italian protests.
   The government called on Libya to disclose the circumstances of
the murder Wednesday of Roberto Ceccato, 35.
   In an interview with Italy's state RAI television Friday night,
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi said he had not heard about
Ceccato's slaying, which has shocked Italy and severely strained
relations between the countries.
   In a further comment that outraged many Italians, Gadhafi said:
``I hope he had life insurance.''
   The Foreign Ministry issued a communique Saturday saying it
preferred not to respond to Gadhafi's comments.
   But it said Italy ``would consider it inadmissible for the
Libyan side not to shed full light on the very grave incident in
view of identifying the culprits.''
   The statement urged Libya with ``maximum firmness'' to carry out
a swift investigation. Italy, it said, was ready to ``take the
consequent decisions, taking into account the elements and evidence
which come to its attention.''
   It did not elaborate. Some newspapers suggested the government
could order the evacuation of the 3,000 Italians in Libya, and some
politicians said Italy should recall its ambassador or reduce its
diplomatic staff.
   About 100 people demonstrated outside Libya's consulate in Milan
on Saturday, some throwing eggs or scrawling protests on walls.
   The demonstration was organized by Italy's neo-fascist Italian
Social Movement, which also declared a day of remembrance on Nov. 5
for the Italians who died in Libya during the colonial period.
   Ceccato was slain Wednesday night on the eve of ``day of
mourning'' protests declared by Gadhafi for Libyans deported during
30 years of Italian colonial rule between 1911 and World War II.
   Italian media reports said Ceccato, who worked for an Italian
farm products firm, was found dead near the company's complex just
outside Tripoli. He had been shot in the head and stomach and his
body set on fire.
   Libya's official news agency, JANA, said it appeared to be ``an
ordinary criminal crime.''
   Pressed about the death, Gadhafi said foreigners must have been
responsible.
   Italy's ambassador in Tripoli, Giorgio Reitano, met with two
Libyan Foreign Ministry officials Saturday and said they offered
their condolences.
   An Italian policeman flew to Tripoli Saturday to join the
investigation along with a doctor who will assist in the autopsy.
   In the television interview, Gadhafi repeated his demand for
reparations for the colonial period. Italy says it met its
obligations with payment of $6.7 million under a 1956 agreement
with the former Libyan monarchy.
   Gadhafi also demanded an explanation from Italy for its refusal
to accept a boatload of 846 Libyans who sailed to Naples without
visas to mark the ``day of mourning.'' Gadhafi suggested Libya
could retaliate by detaining Italian ships that sail into Tripoli
and Benghazi.
   The interview appeared to be conducted inside a tent. Gadhafi,
clad in a black leather jacket, sat casually in a swivel chair. His
comments were translated from Arabic into Italian by a Libyan
interpreter.
   Rome's La Repubblica newspaper called Gadhafi's comments
``cynical and impudent.'' Milan's Corriere Della Sera newspaper
reported that the RAI network was flooded by calls from hundreds of
viewers angered by Gadhafi's statements.

   Jacob Wetterling's parents are not yet
ready to look beyond Sunday, which marks a week since their
11-year-old son was snatched at gunpoint by a masked man less than
a mile from their home.
   ``I've been living basically moment by moment since Sunday
night,'' said Jacob's father, Jerry.
   ``I thought by Monday morning this is awful, this is sick,''
said Jacob's mother, Patty, a substitute teacher and PTA president
at her son's school. ``This _ day after day _ I can't possibly
imagine going through the weekend. I can't possibly think beyond
one minute at a time. I really don't think.''
   Jacob, his 10-year-old brother, Trevor, and an 11-year-old
friend were accosted Sunday night by a man dressed in black on a
lonely stretch of road outside this central Minnesota town of
2,200, which now display posters of the missing boy along with its
Halloween decorations.
   The abduction occurred about 9:30 p.m. as the three were
returning on bicycles and a scooter from a convenience store where
they had gone for the first time after dark without an adult. The
man, who was on foot and had no vehicle in sight, asked the boys
how old they were, then held onto Jacob and threatened to shoot the
other two unless they ran into the woods.
   The FBI released a personality profile of the type of person
likely to have kidnapped Jacob, a handsome boy who plays goalie on
an ice hockey team.
   According to the profile, the kidnapper is probably a previous
sex offender, a white male 25 to 35 years old with some type of
physical deformity, and is likely to work at an unskilled job.
   State and local police as well as the FBI have been frustrated
by the lack of evidence despite repeated aerial and ground surveys,
national publicity, more than $100,000 in reward money and appeals
to Stearns County residents to scour their property for clues.
   Wetterling, 41, said they haven't received any ransom demands
and doubts that his work as president of the St. Cloud chapter of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is a
factor in the abduction.
   Gov. Rudy Perpich, who visited the family Thursday, activated
100 Minnesota Army National Guardsmen to expand the search.
   The Guardsmen, plus another 100 Department of Natural Resources
employees, began searching Saturday at the spot where the
sixth-grader was abducted and will fan out through the township,
said Lt. Kent Christianson of the Hennepin County sheriff's
department. Horseback patrols and dogs also are being used.
   At home, a note posted on the kitchen wall by his 8-year-old
sister, Carmen, awaits Jacob's return. It reads, in part: ``You
were on the radeo and the News. Evrybuty cry'd very hard. I am glad
you are home now.''
   ``This family counselor of ours said to me wisely, `As I see it,
you only have one option and that's to know that he's fine and he
will be home safe soon.' I just program that into my being,'' said
Ms. Wetterling.
   Friends and relatives have been staying around the clock at the
two-story frame home in a small wooded subdivision, answering the
phone and the door to shield the Wetterlings from
curiosity-seekers. Most visitors bring gifts of food.
   ``There's nothing anybody can do so they bring food,'' said Ms.
Wetterling, 39. ``I'm diabetic and everybody is worried about me
eating, but it just won't go anywhere,'' she said as she began to
cry yet again.
   ``Right now, we have the luxury of having lots of support people
around,'' said Wetterling, whose chiropractic office was being run
last week by a retired chiropractor who normally fills in during
vacations.
   Carmen wakes up frequently at night and her 13-year-old sister,
Amy, won't sleep alone, but the psychological damage extends beyond
the Wetterling household.
   A classmate of Trevor's, 10-year-old Stephanie Larson, has had
problems sleeping since the abduction, said her mother, Sandy. For
a few days after the abduction, Stephanie made her mother accompany
her to the bus stop, even though Ms. Larson can see it from their
home.
   The Wetterlings believed it was safe for their sons and their
friend to travel together at night to the store, and now they don't
know what to tell other parents.
   ``That's the thing the teachers are having a hard time with
because they've also taught them to go in a group,'' said Ms.
Wetterling. ``Now, all of a sudden being in a group wasn't enough.
I have no advice. We did everything we knew.''

   President Bush, defending his veto
of the District of Columbia's $3.4 billion budget, said Saturday he
will stand like ``a brick wall'' against any attempt to use public
funds for abortions.
   The White House announced the veto Friday as Bush arrived here
for the two-day conference on Western Hemisphere leaders on drugs,
debt and democracy.
   The measure would have allowed the nation's capital to use local
taxpayers' funds, not federal money, to resume paying for elective
and other abortions for poor women.
   Bush, asked at a news conference how he justified his action,
replied:
   ``I don't think public money ought to go for that, except in the
life of the mother. ... They can push me for political advantage
every time they want to, and they're going to be up against a brick
wall.''
   ``The people that are being victimized by those kinds of
political games are the people in the District of Columbia,'' Bush
said.
   Del. Walter E. Fauntroy, D-D.C., conceded Saturday that Bush,
who won a veto fight in Congress last week over federal money for
abortions, has the upper hand on the use of local money for
abortions.
   ``It is not likely that the House will be able to override the
president's veto any more than it was his veto of the health
appropriations,'' Fauntroy said in Washington. ``The president
seems to have all the cards at this point.''
   Fauntroy said the district would probably use stopgap
appropriations measures to continue city services until a
compromise could be engineered on abortion funding.
   Washington Mayor Marion Barry said after the veto, ``We find it
ironic that at the same time the president is vetoing this
anti-crime, anti-drug appropriations package, he is in Costa Rica
... to celebrate the centennial of democratic rule in that country.
Yet, while he is away, we are having dictatorial rule here in
Washington.''
   City Council Chairman David Clarke complained that the veto
means a delay of at least a month in getting an extra $32 million
to fight crime. The district has already recorded 364 homicides,
eight short of last year's record toll.
   ``The president has shown his willingness to sacrifice the
public safety of the citizens of the nation's capital in order to
appeal to a one-issue constituency,'' Clarke said.
   The budget bill was for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   Congress earlier this week upheld Bush's veto of a $157 billion
appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human
Services and Education that would have allowed Medicaid to pay for
abortions nationwide for victims of rape or incest.

   When 45-year-old Mark Anderson sat down to
take the American College Test on Saturday, the nervous high school
students around him thought he was a proctor.
   Then they realized he was one of them.
   Anderson, an admissions director at Gustavus Adolphus College,
took the test so he could understand what students go through
trying to get into the school, located in the nearby southern
Minnesota town of St. Peter.
   ``I'm done. I'm done. I'm done,'' Anderson said after finishing
the test in four hours.
   Anderson was easily the oldest test taker at Mankato State
University, one of many testing sites around the country. High
school students taking the test with him couldn't believe he would
want to take the ACT when he didn't have to.
   ``At first, they asked if I was the proctor for the test. Then I
got that same look I get all the time: `What are you doing taking
the test?'''
   But by break time, he said they were all swapping test-taking
stories.
   The ACT measures competency in English, mathematics, reading and
scientific reasoning and is used by college admissions officers as
one tool for selecting students.
   And how did Anderson do?
   ``I know I got some questions right on the test,'' he said,
chuckling.
   But Anderson, who expects to receive his test results within
seven weeks, is coy about whether he will make them public.
   ``We'll see how it turns out,'' he said. ``My office staff had a
pool on what I would score.''

   The jokes came quickly, and as predictably
as aftershocks.
   New ones are heard every day, offering proof that Northern
Californians who lived through the rumbling were not scared out of
their wit.
   ``Where there is anxiety, there will be jokes to express that
anxiety,'' said University of California anthropology professor
Alan Dundes. ``There is a feeling of exaltation: `Ha, ha, you
missed me!'''
   The first jokes were off-the-cuff ones within minutes after the
Oct. 17 quake, before people realized what damage that had been
done in some parts of town.
   At Candlestick Park, where a World Series crowd of 60,000 felt
the shaking as Game 3 was about to start, someone told baseball
announcer Hank Greenwald that the quake had measured 6.9 on the
Richter scale (later revised to 7.1).
   ``Yes, but I heard the East Germans only gave it 6.2,''
responded Greenwald, alluding to the scoring system used by Olympic
gymnastic judges.
   Soon after driving through the toll booth on the Bay Bridge, two
house painters found themselves at a standstill because one section
had collapsed.
   ``I want my dollar back,'' one said.
   The professional humor writers and stand-up comedians are
hitting the earthquake subject hard now.
   ``Now, my house actually looks neater,'' comedian Bonnie Datt
told a San Francisco audience.
   Comedian Steve Allen said, ``A terrorist group in Beirut is
taking responsibilty for the earthquake.''
   Susan Cerce said at a San Francisco comedy club, ``All these
natural disasters _ hurricanes in South Carolina, earthquakes in
San Francisco _ you get the impression that this planet will do
anything to get attention.''
   Comedy writer John Cantu of San Francisco said, ``I was driving
on the street and a parking space opened up ... and swallowed my
car.''

   Authorities found 40 bodies of victims
of Hindu-Moslem clashes over a northern religious site, journalists
and news reports said Saturday.
   Since Tuesday, 130 people have been killed in violence over the
religious dispute, according to news reports.
   Authorities on Saturday sealed off the northeastern town of
Bhagalpur to prevent more violence, the reports said.
   Hindus and Moslems, angered by conflicting claims over the
religious site in Uttar Pradesh state, have clashed near Bhagalpur
in neighboring Bihar state since Tuesday. Authorities have imposed
a curfew and called in army troops to keep order.
   Police found 40 bodies in Chandeli village, a suburb of
Bhagalpur, on Saturday, said a journalist of the Hindustan Times
newspaper in the city of Patna, the Bihar state capital.
   Press Trust of India news agency quoted officials in Patna as
saying that 18 of the bodies were recovered Saturday, but the
agency did not specify where they were found.
   Another journalist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it
was not clear if the victims were killed Saturday or earlier. He
said some of the bodies had been recovered from a village well.
   The religion of the latest victims was not known.
   Moslems account for about 12 percent of India's 880 million
people. Hindus make up about 82 percent.

   People were reportedly swinging back and forth on the 200- to
300-foot-long, 50-foot-high, wooden pedestrian bridge over the
Little Red River before it collapsed, said a Cleburne County
Sheriff's Office spokesman.
   About 30 to 50 people were on the span when it gave way, said
dispatcher Gary Hooten.
   The county coroner pronounced one person dead, said reporter
Paul Headden of radio station KAWW in Heber Springs. The bridge is
about five miles east southeast of Heber Springs, which is about 60
miles north northeast of Little Rock.
   Several injured people were taken to Cleburne County Memorial
Hospital, said Carolyn Vinson, a telephone operator there. She said
she could not release further information.
   Cranes were being sent to the scene, said Bill White, another
spokesman for the sheriff's department. The National Guard was also
asked for assistance.
   ``We don't know what all we've got,'' White said.
   ``I fly over the area all the time,'' he said. ``There's always
people underneath it fishing.''
   The bridge is old and was used for automobiles until about 10
years ago, said Cathy Stogsdille of Heber Springs. She said many
people go to the bridge because of the river's beauty.

<TEXT>
   The Nicaraguan Contras, weakened by
a Central American peace agreement and reduced U.S. aid, may have
lost their military and political momentum, but not their
determination to overthrow Daniel Ortega's Sandinista government.
   Ortega's plan to break off a cease-fire with the Contras
disrupted Costa Rica's celebration of 100 years of democracy and
led President Bush to hint Saturday at the possibility of renewing
U.S. military aid for the rebels.
   Ortega said he was ending the 19-month-old cease-fire because of
stepped up Contra attacks and accused the U.S.-backed rebels of
trying to subvert the electoral process; Bush angrily called Ortega
``the unwanted animal at the garden party.''
   ``Ortega is crying wolf,'' said Adolfo Calero, a Contra leader
in Miami who accused the Nicaraguan president of trying to subvert
the elections scheduled for Feb. 25.
   Five Central American presidents agreed Aug. 7 that the Contras
should be disbanded in exchange for democratic reforms in
Nicaragua. The accord called for the Contras to be voluntarily
repatriated to their homeland by Dec. 8.
   The Contras, in turn, vowed not to disband quietly. They left
their home bases in Honduras and began marching back into their
homeland, carrying old weapons and dwindling stocks of ammunition.
   ``We're sure we'll be able to make sure the Sandinistas can't
live in peace,'' said Contra army commander Israel Galeano in a
late August interview with The Associated Press at his headquarters
camp in Honduras.
   Galeano said then the rebels would launch no offensive
operations and would await the outcome of the elections.
   ``If the elections are democratic, we'll go back, that's what
we're fighting for,'' said a Contra battalion commander interviewed
then. ``But we don't believe them, that's why we're here.''
   Fighting had escalated in the last three weeks in Nicaragua.
Ortega said the straw that broke the camel's back was a Contra
attack last Sunday that left 19 dead on the last day of
registration for the upcoming elections.
   ``We haven't been launching any attacks. We've only been
defending ourselves,'' Wilfredo Montalvan, a member of the
Nicaraguan Resistance's directorate, said Saturday.
   ``They're always attacking us because they want to liquidate
us,'' said Montalvan, who is based in San Jose.
   Added Bosco Matamoros, the chief Contra spokesman in Washington,
``It defies any logic that 3,000 men at the most could carry out
any military operation in Nicaragua.''
   In Managua, Sandinista Army spokesman Carlos Lara said the
latest Contra attack occured Friday, when a patrol of army and
Interior Ministry troops was ambushed in northern Matagalpa
province. Lara said the patrol returned fire, killing six Contras.
   The cease-fire, which took effect shortly after the United
States halted military aid to the Contras, was extended on a
monthly basis by the Sandinistas. The current extension runs out
Oct. 31.
   The United States, meanwhile, kept up non-lethal aid.
   Scattered fighting continued at a greatly reduced scale, even as
U.S. officials urged that the Contras to stay in Honduras and not
to launch attacks.
   Ortega said Saturday that since the cease-fire was implemented,
Contra attacks had killed 736 Nicaraguans and injured 1,153 others.
He also accused the rebels of kidnapping or causing the
disappearance of 1,481 people.
   With even non-lethal Contra aid due to end in February, Contra
officials in Miami began to lose control and leadership was taken
over by battle-hardened field commanders.
   When the first Contras began marching into Nicaragua at the
beginning of September, some U.S. officials who spoke on condition
of anonymity said they feared that the powerful Sandinista army
would be able to wipe out the isolated and outnumbered Contra
groups.
   The Contras had about 12,000 troops in Honduras camps when the
accord was signed, and claimed another 6,000 in the interior of
Nicaragua.
   ``We have too much morale and not enough bullets,'' said Galeano.

<HEAD>Thousands in Detroit Brace For Devil's Night Fires</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM IRWIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters and police will get some help this
year from some 30,000 volunteers and car telephone owners who will
be on the lookout for arson fires set during Devil's Night.
   A dusk-to-dawn curfew also is in place to guard against the
threat of arson during the three-day Devil's Night period that
begins Sunday and ends Tuesday on Halloween.
   In Tustin, Calif., a group urged pet owners to lock up their
cats until Halloween is over, saying the animals are being
mutilated and tortured to death.
   Several Southern California animal shelters also said they will
not give away black cats until Halloween is over, fearing the
animals may be killed or used as party novelties.
   In Carbondale, Ill., police arrested 20 revelers as hundreds of
college students blocked a downtown street early Saturday morning,
despite efforts to defuse the annual Halloween street party.
   Most of the arrests were for alcohol violations and came after
about 300 people left a private party and joined a large crowd in
the streets, authorities said.
   The Devil's Night period, named after the nickname for the night
before Halloween, traditionally has been a time for pranks in
Detroit. But it grew into a bout of arson that peaked in 1984 with
810 fires that killed one person and left dozens homeless.
   The number of fires in recent years has decreased steadily.
There were 229 fires reported during the period last year, an
average of 76 per night. About 65 fires are reported on an average
night in Detroit, fire officials say.
   ``I assume if we have the cooperation of the people of this city
... we should be able to keep matters under control,'' Mayor
Coleman A. Young said.
   The City Council voted for a fifth consecutive year to impose a
6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew on youths under 18 during the Devil's Night
period.
   More police officers and firefighters will be on duty, and other
city workers, mayoral appointees and police cadets will patrol
Detroit streets to ``serve as additional eyes and ears,'' Young
said.
   Block club members and citizens band radio owners will comprise
many of the estimated 30,000 volunteers expected to assist police
in patrol work.
   The Cellular One telephone service will activate a toll-free
number for reporting suspected arson during the three-day period.
   The Detroit Fire Department will activate a hot line of its own
on Sunday. That program offers $1,500 for information leading to
the arrest and conviction of an arsonist.
   City officials also hoped stepped-up demolition of abandoned
buildings would present arsonists with fewer potential targets.
Nearly 2,000 such buildings have been torn down since July 1.

<HEAD>Reports U.S. Modifies Middle East Peace Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has
agreed to modify Washington's Middle East peace proposal to make it
more acceptable to Israel, Israel radio reported Saturday.
   It said Baker made the changes following a week of intensive
contacts with Foreign Minister Moshe Arens.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman declined comment on the radio
report. He said Arens sent a letter to Baker last week accepting
the U.S. plan in principle but asking for minor changes.
   Neither the spokesman nor Israel Radio gave details about the
purported changes.
   In other developments:
   _ Peace activist Abie Nathan, jailed for meeting with Palestine
Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat, told a legislator he
had rejected an offer of a pardon if he expressed remorse for
meeting with PLO officials.
   _ Masked Palestinians stabbed to death a 42-year-old Palestinian
woman suspected of collaborating with Israel.
   _ Israeli troops opened fire during clashes in the occupied Gaza
Strip and West Bank, killing one Palestinian and wounding 15.
   At least 606 Arabs have been killed during the 22-month-old
Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occpuation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Another 137 Palestinians have been slain by
fellow Arabs on suspicion of cooperating with Israeli authorities.
Forty Israelis also have perished in the violence.
   Arens, in his letter to Baker, urged the U.S. peace plan be
changed to drop Cairo, Egypt, as the site for preliminary
Israeli-Palestinian talks and to bar Palestinians deported by
Israel from participating in the negotiations.
   He also insisted that the talks be limited to discussing
Israel's election plan for the West Bank and Gaza Strip and not
include Palestinian demands for an independent state.
   The Israeli plan calls for elections and limited autonomy in the
occupied territories.
   Baker proposed an Israeli-Palestinian meeting in Cairo to
discuss the election offer and specified that the Palestinian
delegation could discuss other political issues. He also did not
rule out the participation of Palestinians expelled from their
homeland by Israel.
   The Israeli Cabinet has rejected a suggestion by Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak that Israeli and Palestinian delegates meet
in Cairo with the Palestinian members to include two deportees with
links to the PLO.
   Peace crusader Nathan was convicted Sept. 27 of meeting with
Afafat and other PLO officials in Tunisia and France in September
1988 and was sentenced to six months in prison. Israel's
anti-terror law prohibits meetings with members of terrorist
organizations, and Israel considers the PLO such a group.
   Nathan entered the Eyal prison near Tel Aviv three weeks ago to
begin serving the sentence.
   Legislator Yossi Sarid of the leftist Citizens Rights Movement
visited Nathan Saturday and said later that officials had offered
to arrange a pardon.
   ``They let it be known that if he will express regret for
meeting with Arafat and if he promises not to do it again, he will
be granted a pardon,'' Sarid told The Associated Press.
   He reported Nathan said he told the officials, who he did not
identify, that the offer was ``totally unacceptable.''
   ``He has no regrets about what he has done,'' Sarid said.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Etti Eshed said the ministry has
not considered asking President Chaim Herzog to pardon Nathan ``and
I don't know where this allegation is coming from.''
   Arab reporters said that in the West Bank town of Nablus five
masked youths entered the house of Rasmiyya al-Banna and slashed
her face and neck with knives and pieces of broken glass. They said
she was accused of collaborating with Israel and died of the wounds
at Rashidiyya hospital.
   Israel television said Jihad Sabah Ghenamad, 18, was shot and
killed by Israeli troops during a street battle in the the West
Bank village of Surif.
   Arab reporters and hospital sources said 15 Palestinians were
shot and wounded by troops in scattered clashes in the Gaza Strip.

<HEAD>Court Rules Strikers Violated Law, But Walkout Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A regional court ruled that striking coal miners
in the Soviet Arctic were violating a new labor law, but their
walkout continued, Tass reported Saturday.
   The case indicated that the Soviet Union's increasingly frequent
labor disputes are now to be settled by legal means. Until
recently, workers could expect strikes to be broken up by tough
police action and leaders could expect long jail sentences.
   The Supreme Court of the Komi autonomous region ruled that
strikers at the Vargashor mine in the Vorkuta region north of the
Arctic Circle had ``grossly violated'' a law passed Oct. 9 by the
national Supreme Soviet parliament.
   The miners walked off the job Wednesday to protest what they
said was the government's failure to follow through on promises of
improved economic and social conditions that ended a major walkout
in July.
   The Vargashor mine is the largest of nine mines in the Vorkuta
region with a total of 18,000 workers.
   The court decision involved a suit filed by managment. Tass did
not say when the court ruled.
   The news agency said the court found the coal miners violated
provisions of the new law that requires conciliation and
arbitration commissions to be set up before a strike.
   It said they also violated a provision requiring that a strike
be approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the workers.
   However, there was no immediate indication that miners would end
their strike, or what kind of penalties the court might impose.
Under the law, those held responsible can be forced to compensate
for business losses.
   Strikes at other coal mines in the Vorkuta region collapsed
Thursday when management took the issue to court.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned Thursday that
``strong administrative measures through the prosecutor and the
courts'' could be taken to end the strike and promote stability.
   Soviet officials have expressed worry there will be shortages of
coal for producing fuel and electricity this winter because of this
year's series of walkouts.
   The region's coal production is only about half of its targeted
level, Tass said. It said the region is 55,000 tons behind for
October.

<HEAD>Report Claims Pan Am Bomb Planted in Malta</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have found evidence the bomb that brought
down Pan Am Flight 103 and killed 270 people was planted in Malta,
The Sunday Times of London reported.
   The newspaper said the evidence was found in a computer list of
all luggage put aboard the flight when it originated in Frankfurt,
West Germany, on Dec. 21. The Passengers and luggage later were
transferred to a Boeing 747 at Heathrow Airport in London.
   All 259 people aboard the airplane and 11 residents of
Lockerbie, Scotland, were killed when the plane exploded and
crashed.
   The Sunday Times, citing British sources, said the baggage list
showed that one suitcase was transferred to Flight 103 from an Air
Malta plane, flight KM180. That flight originated in Malta the
morning of Dec. 21.
   No passenger accompanied the bag onto the Pan Am flight, the
newspaper said.
   Late Saturday night, the police press office in Lockerbie issued
the following statement by John Orr, the Scottish detective heading
the investigation:
   ``As part of the ongoing international investigation, officers
from the inquiry team at Lockerbie have traveled to many different
countries including Malta. Clearly, it would be imprudent for me to
comment on the significance of any of these inquiries while the
investigation is still active.''
   The Sunday Times quoted Louis Grech, chief executive of Air
Malta, as confirming last week that Scottish police had interviewed
a senior executive of the airline. The newspaper said 20 airport
workers also were interviewed.
   No one has been charged in the bombing. Press reports have cast
suspicion on several terrorist groups, including the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command of Ahmed Jibril.
   The Scottish detectives who are heading the investigation have
contended for several months that the bomb was put aboard Flight
103 in Frankfurt. They have said the bomb was packed into a
radio-cassette player.
   The Sunday Times, however, said the bomb was placed in a
copper-colored suitcase.
   It said forensic experts at the Ministry of Defense's Royal
Armament Research and Development Establishment believe the
suitcase contained clothing manufactured and purchased in Malta.
   The Sunday Times said a pair of trousers in the suitcase was
traced to a shop in the Maltese tourist resort of Sliema. It said
police interviewed the shopkeeper, who recalled selling the
trousers and other items in the suitcase to a man he believed was a
Libyan.

   A wintry storm Saturday dropped light snow from eastern Idaho to
Wyoming and Montana, and spread light rain and cooler weather into
the northern Plains.
   Up to 8 inches of snow fell overnight and Saturday morning in
lower elevations near Yellowstone National Park, Wyo. Up to 7
inches more were expected in the mountains nearby.
   Pocatello, Idaho, got 3 inches of snow by early afternoon, and
an inch fell in Dillon, Mont., and Rawlins, Wyo.
   Ahead of the snow, rain fell over northeast Montana, northwest
North Dakota, central Nebraska, southern Iowa, northern and western
Missouri, eastern Kansas and eastern Oklahoma.
   Scattered showers fell over northeast Florida and the Georgia
coast.
   A snow advisory was posted for northeast Idaho, south central
and southeast Montana, north central Wyoming and northeast Utah. Up
to 3 inches were expected at lower elevations in Montana and up to
6 inches in the mountains.
   Winter storm watches were in effect into Sunday for eastern
Wyoming, western South Dakota and southwestern North Dakota, where
up to 5 inches of snow was expected. Up to 4 inches were forecast
for the Nebraska Panhandle, and Colorado was expected to get 3
inches at lower elevations and 6 inches in the mountains.
   It was another balmy day across much of the East, with afternoon
temperatures mostly in the 70s from the Great Lakes to New England,
down the eastern seaboard and across the Appalachians.
   Record highs for the day were set or tied in five cities in
Michigan and Ohio.
   The overnight low in the Lower 48 states was 7 degrees in
Gunnison, Colo.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 26 degrees at

<HEAD>After Four Decades, Stalinist Victims Are Symbolically Buried</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 2,000 people led by Roman
Catholic leader Jozef Glemp prayed Saturday at a funeral Mass for
thousands of prisoners secretly executed in the Stalinist era and
buried in unmarked graves throughout Poland.
   After more than 40 years, it was believed to be the first public
funeral for the untold numbers executed during the early years of
the Communist takeover in Poland.
   The crimes were long cloaked in silence, with families fearful
to even speak about the victims.
   A changed official attitude, however, was underscored at
Saturday's ceremony by the presence by two ministers from the new
government led by non-Communist Solidarity members.
   Also attending were widows and children of victims and former
Stalinist-era prisoners. No officials from the Communist Party were
seen.
   Historian Wojciech Ziembinski, speaking during a symbolic burial
ceremony after the Mass, referred to the victims as ``those who
made the sacrifice of their life in the service of their homeland.''
   The victims included officers of the Home Army, the main
underground resistance force during the wartime Nazi occupation,
and other suspected opponents of the Communist takeover.
   In his sermon, Cardinal Glemp, wearing violet funeral vestments,
condemned the ``terrifying evil that raged, unmindful of any
violation of morality, capable of the utmost contempt of humanity.''
   The Roman Catholic primate of Poland called for full disclosure
of Stalinist crimes.
   The ceremony was held at the 750-year-old parish of St.
Catherine's on the southern edge of Warsaw, just a few hundred
yards from Walbrzyska Street Cemetery. Many of the Warsaw victims
are said to have been secretly buried there at night during the
late 1940s and early 1950s.
   Former underground army fighters and members of the recently
legalized Union of Former Prisoners from the Stalinist Time formed
an honor guard inside the packed church. Much of the crowd spilled
over into the yard outside.
   After Mass, an urn filled with earth from the Walbrzyska
cemetery and three other suspected burial sites was laid in a small
stone-lined grave next to the church steps.
   Among those watching was Bernart Jozef of Warsaw, who served as
an officer in the U.S. Army during World War II after the
occupation of Poland.
   For that reason, he was sentenced by the newly installed
Communist regime to 10 years in prison as an American spy when he
returned to Poland, he said. He was sent to Mokotowski Prison, now
notorious for its brutality to political prisoners.
   ``They would come in the night and take people out of their
cells,'' he said. ``No one ever heard from them again.''

<HEAD>Drug Traffickers Looking Worldwide for Bank Havens</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Efforts to curb money laundering in
the Western Hemisphere have pushed drug traffickers to scour the
globe for banking havens for their illicit profits, bankers and
economists said Saturday.
   Countries whose economies thrive due to banking secrecy laws may
want to join the war on drugs, but few are willing to clean up
other black-market activities, said R. Thomas Naylor, an economist
at McGill University in Montreal.
   ``Drug money is mixed with money from arms trafficking,
smuggling, insider trading and the looting of underdeveloped
countries,'' Naylor told bankers, lawyers and law enforcement
officials from the United States and Colombia at the conference on
money laundering being held in this Miami suburb.
   ``The Indian Ocean seems to be the new frontier,'' Naylor said.
``(The) Seychelles and Mauritania are getting into the offshore and
instant-corporation game ... and dope dealers are moving in under
the cover of that.''
   In his keynote speech Friday, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
said U.S. laws making money laundering a crime, requiring banks and
corporations to report large cash transactions and treaties
allowing authorities to exchange information across borders have
immeasurably helped efforts to seize the profits of the drug
cartels.
   Nevertheless, drug traffickers are ``diabolically innovative''
at hiding their money, Thornburgh said. ``They will employ any
financial instrument as a cleanser.''
   Many academics, lawyers and bankers said they were even more
pessimistic.
   Curtailing money laundering will never be as successful as
interdicting the flow of drugs because it isn't feasible to
restrict international financial markets, said economist Peter
Reuter of the Rand Corp., a think tank.
   The U.S. seized about 90 metric tons of cocaine last year, about
one-fourth the estimated 360 to 450 tons that reached U.S. users.
In contrast, the more than 6 million cash-transaction reports
submitted so far this year have uncovered only several dozen
laundering leads, Reuter said.
   ``These are hard-core desparadoes. To think that additional
money laundering controls in the banking system will exert a
chilling effect is simply unrealistic,'' said Steven Wisotsky, a
law professor at Nova University in Fort Lauderdale.
   Wisotsky advocated cutting the drug enforcement budget and
putting more taxpayer money into social programs.
   That comment drew an angry reaction from Tom Cash, head of the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's Miami office, who pointed to
the conference as evidence of the international cooperation needed
to fight drug trafficking.
   ``Ten years ago, no such thing as money laundering was a
crime,'' he said later. ``Now, you no longer see one to two million
dollars in loads of cash going into banks.''
   But Ethan Nadelmann, a political-science professor at Princeton
University who endorses legalizing drugs, said the government was
misdirecting its resources.
   ``The current drug policy is a social, moral, economic, and
political disaster,'' Nadelmann said. ``We should treat it as a
public health issue. Let's stop screwing around and thinking we can
win this war.''

<HEAD>Former President Calls for Pacific Free Trade Zone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>OSAKA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Ronald Reagan said Saturday
that Americans may lose patience with what they consider unfair
Japanese trade barriers, and he urged creation of a Pacific free
trade zone.
   The remarks, on Reagan's last day of a nine-day visit, were in
contrast to earlier speeches made during the trip, in which he
glossed over trade disputes.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, left this western port city at 4
p.m. for the United States with about 230 kin of U.S. military
personnel stationed in Japan aboard their chartered Boeing 747.
   The plane arrived in Los Angeles at about 1 p.m. EDT, said
Reagan spokesman Mike Busch. He said the former president and his
wife made no remarks at the airport, but went directly to their
limousine for a ride to their Bel-Air home.
   Before their departure, Reagan told a gathering of 420 prominent
businessmen that many Americans do not feel their products have
fair access to Japanese markets.
   ``Fairness is a very strong strain in the American people,'' he
said, recalling the unfairness that provoked the Boston Tea Party
in 1773 leading up to the American Revolution.
   ``We don't want a Japanese tea party,'' he said.
   Japan posted a $52 billion trade surplus with the United States
in 1988, according to U.S. figures.
   Even more damaging than actual trade barriers, he said, is a
communications gap in which ``Americans think Japan is a nation of
trade barriers.''
   In turn, ``The Japanese think America is a nation that makes
products that nobody wants to buy.''
   Until trade barriers of any kind are lowered, ``the focus in the
U.S. is not going to be on whether American companies have the
quality products Japanese consumers want to buy, but that the
Japanese system won't let the Japanese consumers buy them,'' Reagan
said.
   Reagan referred to a Newsweek poll that showed 68 percent of
Americans surveyed believe Japan's economic power is a greater
threat to the U.S. future than Soviet military might. But he said
few Americans realize trade barriers account for no more than 20
percent of the trade deficit and even fewer are aware of U.S. trade
barriers.
   Reagan urged both countries to overcome their disagreements on
trade, ``put this step-by-step bickering we're going through behind
us and embrace a trade vision that is encompassing.''
   His dream, Reagan said, was of a free trade arrangement similar
to the North American trade zone the United States and Canada have
agreed to establish. That agreement will eliminate trade barriers
between the two nations over the next decade.
   ``We are the two greatest economic powers in the world,'' Reagan
said. ``Let us leap beyond our no-win squabbling by undertaking a
breathtaking plan ... a free trade zone between the U.S. and
Japan.''
   The Reagans arrived in Japan on Oct. 20 as guests of the
Japanese government and Fujisankei Communications Group, Japan's
largest media organization. The hosts spent $7 million on the visit.
   There have been reports that Fujisankei paid Reagan $2 million
for his appearances on television and at charitable events. Reagan
and the company refused comment on the reports.
   Fujisankei's media outlets are known to favor conservative,
nationalistic views, and company chairman Nobutaka Shikanai has
been a strong supporter of Reagan. Company officials have said they
viewed his visit as an opportunity to improve Japan's ties with the
United States.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This sun-blessed land struts to the name of
the Golden State, a real-life Shangri-la of precious resources,
opportunity, space, bounty, beauty and unabashed individualism.
   But paradise has a trap door.
   Below its surface are plates of earth that slip and slide past
each other with enough occasional fury to move mountains, flatten
freeways and put lives and lifestyles in peril.
   The Oct. 17 quake jolted the fickle existence of Northern
Californians who inhabit a world so ideal that Mark Twain called it
``life on the half shell.''
   ``California has always represented the dream of a better life,
more sunshine, more space, a perfect home. But it's also the center
of tragedy: fires, earthquakes, mudslides, all kinds of
disasters,'' said Kevin Starr, a San Francisco historian and a
fourth-generation Californian.
   ``To be a Californian now is not to be an escapist, but it's to
be a high-risk person.''
   San Francisco was named the nation's second-most livable city by
Rand-McNally just a week after it got its most potent jolt since
1906. It is synonymous with earthquakes the way Johnstown, Pa., is
with floods.
   It's another stereotype. But Californians endure them the same
way they endure Easterners and rain, as a nuisance.
   Blissful California is the land of the laid-back, tofu,
self-awareness, yoga, hedonism, narcissism, wheat grass juice,
kooks, nutballs and weird religions.
   ``The rest of the country thinks we all sit around in hot tubs
with glasses of white wine and grow organic gardens, and we do, but
so what,'' said Steve Gross, a waiter at Coffee Ron's.
   A waitress there swears her friend sprained his wrist while
skateboarding in an earthquake fissure.
   There was no underestimating the tragedy of the earthquake. It
killed 64 people. It sent 3,300 to hospitals and forced nearly
14,000 from their homes.
   ``Earthquakes are something we live with here,'' said real
estate agent Jean Sinel of Albany.
   And quake response in California was, well, uniquely Californian.
   Nancy's Quiches of Menlo Park donated 20,000 quiches to the
relief effort. Someone else gave hibachis for cooking. The National
Holistic Institute sent 200 massage therapists to knead the aching,
stressed muscles of rescue workers.
   Hanson Industries, a British company that makes hot tubs, sent a
$1 million check to the Red Cross to help victims of the earthquake
and Hurricane Hugo.
   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias donated 2,500 pounds of coffee
beans to relief agencies in Los Gatos, Santa Cruz, Watsonville and
Hollister.
   A city porn shop offered an ``earthquake special'' of vibrating
sex toys.
   The quake interrupted baseball's premier event, the World
Series, pitting the cross-bay rival Oakland Athletics against the
San Francisco Giants. Sports prowess is another part of the elan of
the Bay area, also home to the Super Bowl champion 49ers.
   One entrepreneur, stuck with stacks of ``Battle of the Bay''
T-shirts printed a giant R over the B and came up with ``Rattle of
the Bay.'' Another shirt read: ``I Went to Candlestick Park for the
World Series and All I Got Was This Lousy Earthquake.'' A bumper
sticker read: ``Stop Continental Drift.''
   The temblor was centered 56 miles south of the city under a
remote peak of Loma Prieta, or Dark Hill, in the Santa Cruz
Mountains. It registered 7.1 on the Richter scale but didn't reach
the force of The Big One, a quake of apocalyptic proportions that
experts warn is coming.
   Smug Californians called this one The Pretty Big One.
   An earthquake simulator, one of the hottest attractions on the
Universal Studios Hollywood tour, suspended operations for 48 hours
after the quake as a sympathy gesture. ``The Big One'' is set in a
San Francisco transit station.
   ``We equated closing it down to flying the flag at half staff,''
said spokeswoman Joan Bullard. It is the studio's most popular
attraction.
   The quake knocked out bridges and freeways, forcing record use
of public transit _ no easy trick for Californians who are so
wedded to their cars that a hearse driver once tried in vain to
claim the body in his coffin as a passenger so he could use the car
pool lane.
   ``This is going to be a lifestyle change for us,'' said Rod
Diridon, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission.
   Some motorists used ferries that normally carry tourists to
Alcatraz and Angel Island. On Monday, gale force winds created
enough waves to cause sea-sickness.
   ``I've just been through hell, but heck, I have to admit I made
it through,'' said an ashen-faced John Trowbridge, 27, of Alameda.
   The San Francisco Examiner had this to say about lifestyles:
``People began to talk of lifestyle changes, as if the earthquakes
had suddenly come into fashion and we had nothing in our wardrobe
that matched.''
   The quake smashed elegant homes in the city's Marina district
and drove the permanently homeless from the seedy Tenderloin deeper
into their shadowy world. The Moscone Convention Center was used as
an emergency center but was cleared out to make room for a
pre-scheduled meeting of plastic surgeons.
   ``The earthquake had no priority list. There's a common jolt
that hit us all, every race, every class. It made us all feel
finite,'' said the Rev. Cecil Williams of the Glide Memorial United
Methodist Church.
   This is the city where Carol Doda jiggled in America's first
topless bar in 1964, where licentious hippies flourished in
Haight-Asbury in the tie-dyed Sixties and where homosexuals came
out of the closet in the Seventies.
   Evangelist Virgi Rosemond weaved those threads into the fabric
of the quake as she preached this week through a bullhorn at
Halladie Park, the city's version of Times Square.
   ``Jesus said he would send earthquakes to Godless places. This
city's wicked, like Sodom and Gomorrah, where men love men more
than they love God,'' she railed on behalf of the True Hope
Pentecostal Church of God and Christ.
   Meanwhile, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a band of gay
men who dress in miniskirted nuns' habits and fishnet stockings,
will aid earthquake victims by holding benefit dances.
   ``We're sort of icons. We're as much a symbol of San Francisco
as earthquakes,'' said Kenneth Bunch, also known as Sister Vicious.
``When people call California kooky and weird, they're reacting to
our wide-open freedom.''
   Two days after the quake, Cynthia Woods lectured reporters
huddled near ruins in the Marina and told them to write about the
majority of the city that wasn't damaged.
   ``We're not a city of kooks,'' she shouted to no one in
particular. ``San Francisco is going to live through this. We're
not something that falls apart. We are survivors.''

<HEAD>Mrs. Thatcher's Popularity Plummets After Cabinet Shake-up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A majority of British voters thinks Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher should step down as Conservative Party leader,
according to a poll published in Sunday's editions of The Mail.
   Another poll, published in The Sunday Telegraph, found that 47
percent of all voters, and 24 percent of Conservatives, thought
less of Mrs. Thatcher following the resignation last week of
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.
   The polls represented Mrs. Thatcher's lowest popularity rating
in 10 years in power. They also were the first gauge of public
reaction to Lawson's resignation because of a disagreement with
Mrs. Thatcher and her personal economic adviser over monetary
policy.
   His resignation forced the second reshuffle of Mrs. Thatcher's
Cabinet in three months.
   The Mail's poll, based on interviews with 1,043 voters on
Saturday, found that 54 percent believed Mrs. Thatcher should step
down. The newspaper did not break out the percentage of
Conservatives who want Mrs. Thatcher to resign.
   The poll's margin of error was not disclosed, nor was the method
of interviewing.
   The Sunday Telegraph's Gallup Poll of 505 voters, conducted by
telephone on Friday and Saturday, found that 47 percent felt less
respect for Mrs. Thatcher following the Cabinet shake-up, while 49
percent said their opinion was unchanged. Among Conservatives, 70
percent said their opinion was unchanged, while 24 percent said
they had less respect.
   The poll's margin of error was not disclosed.
   Eight-two percent of all voters and 69 percent of Conservatives
believed Lawson's departure had reinforced Mrs. Thatcher's
reputation as sometimes being ``bossy and dictatorial.''

   Luella Wilson enjoyed the kind of
retirement lifestyle most people dream about until a
precedent-setting liability case two years ago claimed everything
she had.
   Wilson, 91, had paid for her house, traveled south every winter
and had more than $500,000 in the bank, money she often shared with
family and friends.
   ``I always thought money was to spend, on myself and on
others,'' she said recently. ``That's what I worked for.''
   But her generosity led to her legal woes.
   Wilson lent a grand-nephew money to buy a car. Three weeks
later, after a night of drinking and using drugs, he was in an
automobile accident in which a passenger lost a leg. The passenger
successfully sued Wilson, saying she knew her grand-nephew did not
have a driver's license and that he used drugs, and therefore was
negligent in lending him money to buy a car.
   Wilson now lives like a recluse, eats lunch courtesy of Meals on
Wheels and owes $950,000 to a young man with criminal convictions.
   Her one small hope is a retrial scheduled for Nov. 6 in
Bennington Superior Court. Last spring, the Vermont Supreme Court
upheld the decision against Wilson but also ruled that the auto
dealer who sold the car to the grand-nephew should not have been
excluded from the case.
   Wilson said she feels like a victim of a legal system gone awry.
``I don't know how all this ever happened to me _ it couldn't have
happened 50 years ago,'' she told the Rutland Herald in an
interview last week.
   Wilson, who did not testify in the 1987 trial because of a
medical problem, said of the retrial, ``If I can walk, I'll be
there. I should have told my story to the jury last time.''
   According to testimony at the first trial, Wilson's grand-nephew
Willard Stuart was driving a 1981 Chrysler on April 24, 1984, when
he picked up three friends. Stuart testified that he drank nearly a
gallon of beer, had at least one shot of whiskey and shared at
least six marijuana cigarettes with the others.
   Sometime after 11 p.m., Stuart's car went off a railroad bridge.
Mark Vince, who was riding in the back seat, was paralyzed from the
middle of his back down and later had a leg amputated.
   Vince, unemployed with 18 misdemeanor convictions before the
accident, had not known Stuart before the night of the accident and
did not know he had no driver's license.
   Vince's attorney successfully sued Wilson by arguing that she
knew Stuart did not have a license and that he drank and used
drugs. After deliberating for an hour, the jury agreed.
   ``I think it's just really stretching to hold a grandmother
responsible because she either lends or gives money to a
great-nephew to buy a car,'' said Wilson's attorney, Manfred Ehrich.
   The plaintiff's attorney, Rolf Sternberg, told The New York
Times that Wilson's claims of poverty are exaggerated.
   ``She is not destitute,'' Sternberg said. ``The court order said
her assets are to be frozen except for what she needs to live
adequately. Somebody is trying to make it difficult to pick a fair
and impartial jury.''
   Sally McVie, a juror in the 1987 trial, said the case had been
difficult.
   ``We saw and heard Vince in his wheelchair, and we felt terrible
for him,'' she said. ``We weren't told about his record, and we
were told by his lawyers that he was going to school and had
straightened out his life.
   ``I guess in our hearts we were afraid it could turn out like
this, but we never saw her and we didn't know if she had insurance
or not.''
   When Wilson's insurance company refused to pay the $950,000
judgment against her, Vince attached all her assets, including her
$102,000 home.
   Wilson has sued her insurance company, Vermont Mutual.
   ``If this ruling as allowed to stand, I feel sorry for any other
older people loaning relatives money,'' she said. ``They'll have to
watch out or they'll be sued by someone they never met.''

<HEAD>Japanese-Americans Get High School Diplomas 47 Years Late</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Japanese-Americans who were denied
their high school diplomas seven months after Pearl Harbor won
recognition 47 years later in a graduation ceremony at their alma
mater Saturday.
   Wearing blue mortarboards and graduation gowns, 11 of the 15
former students who were snubbed in wartime assembled at Los
Angeles High School to receive their diplomas, which were dated
June 26, 1942.
   ``Our purpose today is to redress this very serious grievance
that occurred in 1942,'' said Los Angeles Unified School District
spokesman Dan Isaac.
   The ceremony included the pledge of allegiance.
   Graduate Aiko Yoshinaga said she blamed the government, not her
school, for the insult.
   ``I think the government's action was based on racism,'' said
Mrs. Yoshinaga, mother-in-law of current school board member Warren
Furutani.
   ``Not only racism, but really a lack of honesty, a lack of real
strong political leadership,'' she added. ``So I have warm feelings
about the high school I went to.''
   The wartime graduation was held not at the high school but in
suburban Arcadia at the Santa Anita racetrack, which had been
converted in 1942 to a temporary holding pen for
Japanese-Americans. An estimated 120,000 Japanese-Americans were
taken from their West Coast homes and detained in camps during the
war.
   Hundreds of students received their diplomas at the racetrack
ceremony, but the 15 students from Los Angeles High School waited
in vain to hear their names called.
   They blame the tide of anti-Japanese sentiment that swept the
nation after the attack on Pearl Harbor, which brought the United
States into the war. The students said that sentiment was
personified in Paul Webb, the wartime principal at Los Angeles High.
   Webb, who died in 1982, refused to issue the students' diplomas
even though the school board declared all Japanese-American seniors
in good standing be given diplomas.
   Furutani was contacted about the diplomas by another member of
Mrs. Yoshinaga's class, Hayao Shishino. Furutani had district
employees search old school records to document Shishino's claims.
   ``It was time to set the record straight,'' Furutani said this
week. ``We decided it was time they have their real diplomas.''
   One of the original 15 has died and three others could not
attend the ceremony, Shishino said.
   The U.S. House of Representatives voted Thursday to begin making
$1.2 billion in reparation payments next year to Japanese-Americans
confined to camps during World War II. The bill, which would give
$20,000 to each of the 60,000 surviving internees, now moves to the
Senate.

   President Bush, angered by Daniel
Ortega's threat to resume fighting with the Contras, derided the
Nicaraguan president on Saturday as a ``little man'' and an
``unwanted animal at a garden party.''
   Ortega, a bit more diplomatic, responded that Bush was just
reacting defensively.
   What triggered Bush's temper was Ortega's surprise announcement
Friday _ between meetings at the summit of Western Hemisphere
leaders _ that he would break off the cease-fire with Contra rebels
that has been in place since March 1988.
   At a news conference Saturday, Bush mocked Ortega's decision to
wear a military uniform to a meeting of democratic leaders. He
called Ortega an ``outcast'' and an ``unwanted animal at a garden
party.''
   He said Ortega had embarrassed himself in front of the
hemisphere's leaders. ``I do know that President Arias got a hold
of him last night and spoke very directly to him,'' said Bush,
adding that two other presidents did as well.
   Just hours before declaring his intention to end the cease-fire,
Ortega shook hands with Bush at a brief encounter. The Nicaraguans
eagerly released photos of the two presidents together; the White
House withheld its shots.
   Bush said Saturday that instead of ``seeking a photo
opportunity,'' Ortega should be talking to the U.S.-backed Contra
guerrillas, ``to his own people.''
   Twice he referred to the 5-foot-10 Nicaraguan as a ``little
man.'' Asked why he used that description, the 6-foot-2 Bush
snapped, ``Because he is, that's why.''
   Ortega, upon returning to Managua, responded: ``This is a
totally defensive attitude on the part of President Bush.''
   His spokeswoman, Maria Cristina Arguello, quoted Ortega as
saying: ``The tone of the (Bush) statements was not in harmony with
the spirit of the summit.''
   ``Little man'' may not have been the best phrase for an American
president to use in Latin America, where Uncle Sam is often
portrayed as a tall, blue-eyed devil taking advantage of short,
brown Indians.
   Ortega is actually tall for a Central American. Arias, their
mutual host, is closer to average at 5-foot-6.
   Arias said nothing publicly about the contretemps, but his
spokesman Jorge Urbina said Ortega had insulted ``all the
democraticlaly elected presidents of Latin America and the
Caribbean.''
   Later, Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, told
reporters aboard Air Force One that Bush meant ```little man' in
the sense of small man, petty.''
   Scowcroft, who stands 5-foot-8, added, ``He doesn't call me a
little man.'' The retired Air Force general said Ortega ``stepped
on his necktie'' at the hemispheric gathering.

   Opposition leaders on Saturday
denounced President Daniel Ortega's talk of ending a cease-fire
with U.S.-backed rebels amid reports that government troops were
massing, possibly for new fighting.
   However, the president returned home Saturday from a regional
summit saying President Bush had shown interest in enlisting the
help of other Latin American presidents to change Ortega's decision
to end the 19-month-old truce.
   ``I interpret this as a predisposition of President Bush, amid
all his rhetoric, of negotiating this matter of the truce with the
mediation'' of Latin American presidents, Ortega said.
   Opposition leaders said Ortega's announcement he would end the
truce was designed to disrupt national elections that the
government fears it will lose.
   Luis Sanchez, a spokesman for the National Opposition Union,
said the cancellation of the cease-fire ``places the electoral
process under a state of siege.'' He spoke to Radio Catolica,
Nicaragua's Roman Catholic Church radio station, in a telephone
interview from San Jose, Costa Rica, where the summit was held.
   He called Ortega's plan ``a maneuver to intimidate the
population.''
   Ortega announced Friday in Costa Rica that his leftist
Sandinista government will end the cease-fire with the Contra
rebels, but he did not say when.
   He stepped back slightly from that announcement after arriving
in Managua Saturday. He said his government will announce Tuesday
whether it will extend the truce with the Contras for another month.
   However, he said he would continue observing the truce only if
non-lethal American aid to the Contras were used to disband the
rebel force.
   Ortega said Friday the cease-fire could not hold because of
stepped up attacks by rebels, a claim denied by Contra leaders.
   ``The drop of water that made the glass spill over'' was an
attack Oct. 21 in which 19 soldiers died, he told an audience at
the University of Costa Rica.
   Government troops were reportedly being moved to strategic
points in what could be preparations for new military operations.
   A government-run radio station in central Chontales province
said Saturday that more than 1,000 soldiers from Managua were being
transported to guard the strategically important Rama Road.
   The station, Radio Catarran, cited unidentified military sources
as saying the move was ``because of the constant activity of the
Contras'' along the road.
   Sources in Chontales said there has been heavy helicopter
traffic in the area around Juigalpa, the provincial capital, over
the past few days. There was speculation that government troops and
equipment were being moved in that manner.
   For 19 months, the government had been extending the truce,
usually at the beginning of every month.
   Ortega said he had spoken with presidents Carlos Andres Perez of
Venezuela and Oscar Arias of Costa Rica at the summit and that they
told him they were willing to mediate between Ortega and Bush on
the truce.
   Interviewed live by government-run Voice of Nicaragua radio
after stepping off an airplane on his return to Managua, Ortega
denied reports he had stormed out of the two-day summit.
   He said he left early simply to attend to matters in Nicaragua.
   Ortega dismissed a Bush comment calling him a ``little man,''
saying: ``This is a totally defensive attitude on the part of
President Bush.''
   Contra leader Adolfo Calero said in a telephone interview in
Miami that the Contras were not responsible for the Oct. 21 ambush.
   ``Ortega is crying wolf,'' he said. ``Behind this ploy we can
see that he wants to disrupt the electoral process because of
Violeta Chamorro's increasing popularity and support.''
   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of the coalition National Opposition
Union is Ortega's main challenger in the Feb. 25 election.
   Calero and Bosco Matamoros, the chief Contra chief spokesman in
Washington, said rebels have neither the weapons nor manpower to
mount offensives.
   ``It defies any logic that 3,000 men at the most could carry out
any military operation in Nicaragua,'' Matamoros said in a
telephone interview. He said most Contras remained in camps in
neighboring Honduras.
   Matamoros accused Ortega of raising the allegation to justify a
final offensive against the Contras.
   Barricada, the newspaper of the ruling Sandinista National
Liberation Front, said Saturday that truce violations by the
Contras have left 736 people dead and 634 wounded in the past 19
months.
   Also Saturday, an army spokesman denied the government had
staged mock combat in northern Nicaragua to keep people from
registering to vote.
   Lt. Carlos Lara, an army spokesman, said a patrol of army and
Interior Ministry troops was ambushed Friday in northern Matagalpa
province and returned fire, killing six Contras.
   The Contras denied staging any offensive inside Nicaragua.
   Col. Enrique Bermudez, the hard-line Contra military leader,
said the Sandinista army had been conducting a cleanup operation in
the area against the guerrillas, ``who have to defend themselves.''

   Gov. Robert P. Casey on Saturday promised
to punish inmates who took part in two nights of fiery, bloody
rioting at a state prison outside this city and to move quickly to
relieve Pennsylvania's overcrowded prisons.
   Hours after the siege ended Friday, a caravan of buses left the
prison under heavy State Police guard, taking 507 of its 2,600
inmates to four other state penitentiaries already swelled beyond
capacity, officials said.
   Hundreds more were expected to be moved to another state prison
and a new 800-cell federal penitentiary in northwest Pennsylvania.
   Officials also worked to get hundreds of inmates who spent
Friday night outdoors in two exercise yards back into damaged
cellblocks, Corrections Department spokesman Ken Robinson said. The
cells will be searched first, then locked and chained when
prisoners are returned, he said.
   And in Philadelphia, about 120 inmates at the city's Holmesburg
prison took over a cellblock for nearly five hours Saturday,
barricading the entrances with bed frames and setting matresses on
fire following an argument with a guard, said city prison Lt.
Darryl Anderson.
   No hostages were taken and the cellblock was retaken around 8:30
p.m., Anderson said. There were no immediate reports of injuries.
   The two-night uprising at Camp Hill, just outside Harrisburg,
left at least 133 people injured and almost half of the prison's
buildings destroyed or damaged by fire.
   Five hostages were released Friday morning after state police
stormed the prison, restoring order after a building-by-building
assault. No inmates escaped, officials said.
   Casey met for several hours Saturday with Corrections
Commissioner David S. Owens Jr., State Police Commissioner Ronald
M. Sharpe and other top officials.
   The governor said officials still know little about what
triggered the two days of violence, or how inmates were able to
free themselves Thursday after guards had regained control of the
prison following the first night's riot.
   ``We must identify and punish those inmates whose criminal acts
destroyed property and put innocent lives in danger,'' he said.
``We must promptly craft a plan to replace lost prison-cell
capacity at Camp Hill and provide additional cell space throughout
our state correctional system on as fast a track as possible.''
   Casey said he would appoint an independent commission to study
the cause of the disturbance and recommends ways to improve ease
prison overcrowding. He also said he would review the need for more
corrections officers.
   The violence began Wednesday after a prisoner attacked a prison
worker, leading to a seven-hour rampage.
   Officials regained control of the prison. But by Thursday
evening inmates managed to free themselves again, and began a
second night of rioting.
   Most of the injured were showing improvement in hospitals,
officials said.
   A 24-year-old prisoner with a gunshot wound to the abdomen and a
41-year-old guard with multiple stab wounds to the back were in
fair condition at Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, nursing
supervisor Marilyn Shea said. Both had been in serious condition
Friday.
   An 18-year-old inmate was in stable condition with a gunshot
wound to the upper torso at Polyclinic Medical Center, nursing
supervisor Dottie Daley said.
   A 25-year-old guard who suffered a head injury and smoke
inhalation and a prisoner with a gunshot wound to the leg were in
fair condition at Harrisburg Hospital, nursing supervisor Miriam
Wege said.
   The hospital released two guards and three inmates Saturday, she
said.
   Three inmates and a guard were in satisfactory condition at Holy
Spirit Hospital, said nursing supervisor Diann Esser. The guard
suffered bruises on his back and throat. One prisoner had a gunshot
wound, another had been stabbed in the back and a third had chest
pain, the supervisor said.

   A birthday party in a neighborhood hall erupted
into a gunbattle early Saturday that left 15 people wounded, one
critically, police said.
   Police have been unable to determine who did the shooting.
   ``Everybody's shot, but nobody's saying anything,'' explained
Deputy Chief Joseph DeMartino.
   The shots rang out shortly after 6 p.m., after the Brooklyn
party crowd had dwindled to 45 people or so from about 100, police
said.
   A dispute began inside the hall and spilled out onto the street,
with shots fired inside and outside, police said. Five women and 10
men were hit, they said.
   One man was shot in the abdomen and was in critical condition at
Kings County Hospital Center, hospital spokesman Vernon Washington
said. Police identified the man as Paul Valentino, 27.
   Four other people were admitted to Kings County but their
conditions were not immediately available, Washington said.
   Michael Mitchell, 34, was in satisfactory condition at Brookdale
General Hospital with a wound to the abdomen, hospital
administrator Malcolm Kafka said.
   The birthday party was for a neighborhood beautician. The hall
is owned by a church group that uses the building for a private
elementary school during weekdays.
   Police found numerous shell casings, and said at least three
handguns were used. A .38-caliber handgun was found on the street
but police said they were unsure if it figured in the incident.

<TEXT>
   David Dinkins, rudely interrupted in his cruise
to City Hall, faced an array of television cameras a week ago and
uttered six awful words for a politician to speak: ``I have not
done anything wrong.''
   Strategically, at least, he had. Besieged by questions about a
stock sale to his son, the Democratic front-runner for mayor found
himself forced into a complicated defense. By early last week, he
had plummeted in the polls.
   Happily for Dinkins, Republican nominee Rudolph W. Giuliani did
not pull past him. After six weeks of sharply negative campaigning,
the 45-year-old former federal prosecutor was ill-positioned to
grab Dinkins defectors.
   Still, the mayoral race, with the outcome once seemingly set in
stone, is suddenly uncertain. With just 1{ weeks to go, the duel to
lead the nation's most populous city is startlingly uncertain _ and
increasingly contentious.
   ``It's one of the great races of guys running backwards that
I've ever seen,'' said David Garth, political adviser to Mayor
Edward I. Koch, whom Dinkins upended in the Democratic primary
Sept. 12.
   ``Giuliani hurt himself very badly'' in a series of early
missteps that raised charges of racial insensitivity, said Garth,
and ``Dinkins' problem is definitely Dinkins. The question is,
who's going to lose it first?''
   The New York Times endorsed Dinkins in Sunday's editions, saying
he is more experienced in city government than Giuliani and could
help ease racial tensions in the city. But the Times editorial
bemoaned what it called a ``sorry'' campaign.
   ``Neither man has demonstrated compelling qualifications for the
job Ed Koch has filled for half a generation,'' the newspaper said.
   In a city that has five registered Democrats for every
Republican, Dinkins, the 62-year-old Manhattan borough president,
has a built-in edge in his quest to become New York's first black
mayor. He enjoys the support of most unions, whose field work in
turning out voters can be invaluable on Election Day.
   But Dinkins is wounded, his lead perhaps cut in half from the
20-point cushion he had enjoyed all fall. One reason is his
struggle to explain why he sold his son stock in a privately held
communications company for $58,000 when less than three years
before he listed its worth as $1 million.
   Dinkins said the higher sum was an overstatement and he produced
documents supporting the lower price. Giuliani suggested Dinkins
undervalued the stock to avoid gift taxes and accused him of
``knowingly and intentionally'' breaking the ethics law. The
Republican used the issue to remind voters of Dinkins' failure to
file tax returns from 1969 to 1972.
   Despite the comfortable margin in the polls, Dinkins has been on
the defensive since primary night, when he let his friend Jesse
Jackson address a victory party _ a tactical error, analysts say,
because Jackson's support of Palestinian rights and his onetime
reference to New York as ``Hymietown'' have made him anathema to
some Jewish voters.
   While Dinkins himself has a strong pro-Israel record, his
troubles were compounded by charges that one of his advisers made
anti-Semitic remarks years ago and that his campaign paid $9,500
for work by a black nationalist who is a convicted kidnapper.
   Some strategists think Dinkins would not have held a 20-point
lead in any case. ``The man's a black candidate. That's an inherent
liability in some communities,'' said Norman Adler, political
adviser to the Teamsters union, which backs Dinkins.
   Dinkins' one salvation has been Giuliani's own woes. Critics
suggested Giuliani was playing to racial and ethnic divisions when
he placed an ad in a Yiddish newspaper showing himself with
President Bush and Dinkins with Jackson. ``Let the people of New
York choose their own destiny,'' it said.
   Then there was the Jackie Mason flap: The comedian, serving as
Giuliani's emissary to Jewish voters, created a furor by suggesting
that Jews favored Dinkins out of guilt and by calling Dinkins a
``fancy shvartze with a mustache.'' Shvartze is a derogatory
Yiddish term for blacks.
   For all their differences in image, the candidates share
positions on many issues. In separate appearances before a group of
rabbis last week, they made strikingly similar points, calling for
more police patrols, more housing for the homeless, better drug
education and treatment on demand for addicts.
   There are substantive differences: Dinkins has suggested a 1
percent, nearly across-the-board budget cut to handle a looming
deficit crisis, while Giuliani wants more selective cuts. Giuliani
backs building a trash incinerator in Brooklyn; Dinkins wants more
study.
   If the race is Dinkins' to lose, political analysts said,
another misstep could be fatal.
   ``David Dinkins is like the stock market right now,'' said
Adler. ``He took a long fall. He leveled off and bounced up a
little. And he may or may not fall more, depending on what comes
up.''

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Catholics and Protestants took two
``peace trains'' Saturday to protest an IRA bombing campaign
against the Dublin-Belfast rail link, but a bomb threat stopped one
of the trains.
   The Irish Republican Army, which has disrupted service on the
rail line more than 60 times in the past year with bombs and bomb
threats, had promised to let the day pass peacefully.
   ``People right across the community are making a point and the
point is this _ that this railway link between north and south must
be kept open. It is vital to our island,'' said Bishop Samuel
Poyntz of the Protestant Church of Ireland. He saw the train riders
off in Belfast, the capital of the British province of Northern
Ireland.
   Roman Catholic Bishop Cahal Daly of Northern Ireland was also at
the station as the trains left for Dublin, each with about 400
riders aboard. Hundreds more were turned away for lack of seats.
   ``This is a message the IRA cannot refuse to hear, because it is
coming from working and middle-class people, young and old, who are
not going to allow communication in this island to be stopped,''
Daly said.
   The two trains went to Dublin, capital of the Republic of
Ireland, and back to Belfast without incident.
   However, when one of them set off again from Belfast with new
passengers later Saturday, it was halted before reaching the border
because of an anonymous telephone warning of a bomb on the line on
the Republic side.
   Inspector Terence Brady of the Republic's police, whose force
received and relayed the warning, said it could not investigate
until daylight.
   The 70 people aboard, including Irish Republic legislators,
decided to stay on the train through the night at Portadown, 25
miles southwest of Belfast and about 90 miles north of Dublin.
   In a statement reported Friday by Press Association, Britain's
domestic news agency, the mainly Catholic IRA said it would
``resume occasional attacks when we see fit.''
   ``These attacks are not aimed at closing it down but to force
British soldiers into painstaking and dangerous operations,'' said
the statement.
   The IRA is fighting to unite the Protestant-dominated British
province with the Republic of Ireland, which is predominantly
Catholic.
   No one has been killed or seriously injured in the campaign
against the railroad line, and the major impact has been to depress
business on what, until recently, was the only public transport
link between the two capitals.
   The rail line now has competition from a daily bus service.
   When the two special trains pulled into Dublin's Connolly
Station, they were greeted by Ireland's Post Office Workers Union
Band playing ``Congratulations.''
   The only protest came at the border station of Newry where
supporters of Sinn Fein, the IRA's legal political wing, carried
banners calling for British withdrawal from Northern Ireland.
   ``The `peace train' concept has brought together people of
different political opinions from all walks of life, north and
south,'' said Proinsias De Rossa, a passenger on the train and
leader of the Workers' Party, which broke away from Sinn Fein and
the IRA 20 years ago.
   ``I am sure the vast majority would also be prepared to support
a more general demand for peace and an end to the killing and
destruction,'' said De Rossa, whose group has rejected armed
struggle as a means of uniting the two Irelands.

   An unruly crowd of hundreds chanted ``burn, baby,
burn'' as a group of radical Vietnam veterans torched a pile of
American flags Saturday, minutes after a federal law banning
desecration of the flag took effect.
   ``We will not stand for this law to be passed,'' said Brian
Chambers, an Army veteran who served in Vietnam from 1970 to 1971.
   ``We're burning the flag to say we will not stand by to see
forced patriotism. Abridgment of the First Amendment right is the
first infringement,'' Chambers said, referring to the
Constitution's right of free speech.
   The demonstration was held shortly after the anti-desecration
law took effect at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The law, sparked by a
Supreme Court decision permitting flag burning on free-speech
grounds, carries penalties of up to a year in jail and a $1,000
fine.
   In protests Friday, four flags were burned at Berkeley, Calif.,
and a flag burning at Colorado State University was halted when a
passerby snuffed the flames with his bare hands.
   The Seattle group, which including neo-Nazi skinheads and
counterculture types of various stripes, cheered wildly and
profanely as two small piles of flags were set afire outside the
Post Office.
   They sang the national anthem as a flag was lowered down a pole
outside the Post Office, soaked with lighter fluid, then set alight
and raised back into the night sky.
   The handful of organizers from Vietnam Veterans Against the War
Anti-Imperialist said there were 1,000 flags _ one large and most
of the rest the size of a large postage stamp _ in two metal pans
placed on the sidewalk outside the Post Office.
   People in the crowd also produced a flag that was held aloft and
torched as the national anthem was sung.
   Loud cheers went up when a flag from a McDonald's restaurant was
produced for burning. It melted but would not burst into flame.
   After the demonstration, protesters milled up and down the
street in Seattle's Capital Hill section. They blocked traffic and
occasional fights with clubs and bottles broke out, but no serious
injuries were reported.
   Several people, some apparently drunk, argued the pros and cons
of flag-burning and ripped at least one flag to shreds as they
fought over it.
   No uniformed police were seen in the vicinity, although police
spokesman Hal Kulgren had said Friday there would be arrests if a
law was broken.
   Members of the veterans' group had said they would have American
Civil Liberties Union and National Lawyers Guild lawyers at the
scene as observers. However, it was not apparent such observers
were present.
   Kathleen Taylor, ACLU director in Seattle, said the law
encourages the very action it's intended to discourage.
   ``There were no incidents of public flag burning in Seattle
until Congress enacted the prohibition,'' she said. ``Liberty needs
special protection, not its symbol, the flag.''

<TEXT>
   Government soldiers seized six members
of an American medical team and two South African colleagues and
held them at a military compound in northern Mozambique, U.S.
officials said Saturday.
   In Carlsbad, Calif., David Courson, president of the
Carlsbad-based Christian Emergency Relief, said late Saturday that
all eight had been flown to the capital of Maputo.
   He reported information received from Mozambique saying the
eight had been held at a military outpost at Tete, near the border,
and were flown 290 miles south to Maputo. He said U.S. Ambassador
Melissa Wells was to meet with them there Sunday morning.
   U.S. State Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman said in
Washington that American authorities were told the eight were still
in the custody of Mozambican soldiers and were being transported to
Maputo.
   ``We don't have any confirmation that they have been freed,''
she said. She added she did not know if any charges had been filed
against them.
   Courson said he understood that they had not been charged.
   Guerrillas of the Mozambican National Resistance have waged an
insurgency against Mozambique's leftist government since 1977.
Hundreds of thousands of people have died and millions have been
displaced because of the fighting and resultant food shortages.
   The Americans and South Africans were captured near the
Malawi-Mozambique border in southern Africa, said Kris Courson, the
relief group's director of medical services.
   She identified the Americans as Dr. Ken Daugherty of San Diego;
Dr. Fred Leist and his wife, Lucille Leist, of Bremerton, Wash.;
Dr. John Cannon, a dentist from Davenport, Iowa, and paramedics
Carol Roberts of Syracuse, N.Y. and Steve Sherrill of Stroudsburg,
Penn.
   Also seized were South African missionaries Peter Hammond and
George Bezedenhout who were serving as guides, according to the
relief organization.
   The Mozambican news agency AIM had not reported the incident as
of Saturday afternoon but responded to an inquiry with a message
saying a group of foreigners had been captured near the Malawi
border, possibly after entering illegally with guerrillas.
   AIM said Hammond had ties with the South African military and
ran an organization called ``Front-line Fellowship'' which is
strongly opposed to the Mozambican government.
   Ms. Courson said the group had just arrived at the
Malawi-Mozambique border when they encountered the troops and were
captured. She said the organization learned of the abduction in a
phone call early Friday from Hammond's wife.
   ``Malawi was their first stop. They were going to be setting up
medical clinics and dental clinics in the refugee camps along the
Malawi-Mozambique border,'' Ms. Courson said. ``As far as how or
when or why they were abducted, we don't have the answers.''
   Cynthia Efird, the spokeswoman for Christian Emergency Relief,
said the organization has sent teams to Lebanon, Afghanistan,
Nicaragua, the Philippines, Mozambique and other war-torn countries
since 1974.
   Ms. Stockman said earlier Saturday, ``We are aware of reports
that six U.S. citizens were detained by Frelimo (government) troops
on Oct. 24'' and there is concern ``as to their fate.''
   ``Our ambassador is looking into the matter with the government
of Mozambique, and Mozambique has promised us a response,'' she
said.
   David Courson told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that the
organization's interest was humanitarian, with no political
motives. He said the organization frequently sends medical teams to
areas where there is some risk but there have been no previous
problems.
   Carol Roberts, 26, is employed by Eastern Ambulance service in
Syracuse and took a two-week vacation to join the relief team, said
her mother, June Roberts of Fairfield, Conn.
   ``Being in the type of work that she is, she's in very tight
circumstances sometimes,'' Mrs. Roberts told the Syracuse Herald
American on Saturday. ``I would imagine she's handling herself all
right there, too.''
   She said her daughter left for Africa on Oct. 20 and was to
return home Nov. 5.

   The news agency said Yacine, 60, died at La Tronche Hospital
near Grenoble, France, where he had gone for treatment of his
illness.
   Yacine, an active supporter of Algeria's war for independence
from France in the 1950s, first became known for his novel
``Nedjma,'' an extended love poem to the title character, a woman
who incarnates the Algerian revolution.
   He wrote novels and poems in French but since 1970 wrote mainly
for the theater in the Algerian dialect of Arabic.
   His best-known play was ``Mohamed, Get Your Suitcase,'' dealing
with large-scale Algerian emigration to France.

   Industrialist Ermal Cleon Fraze, who during
a night of insomnia invented the removable pull-tab opener used on
beer and soft drink cans, died Thursday at the age of 76.
   Fraze died of a brain tumor at Kettering Memorial Hospital in
Dayton, the hospital said.
   In 1959, while on a family picnic with some friends, Fraze
became frustrated when, lacking a can opener, he had to use a car
bumper to open a can of beer, said Fraze's son, Mark.
   The inspiration came one night when Fraze couldn't sleep. He got
up at 1:30 a.m. to work on a way to attach an opening lever to a
can.
   ``I was up all night and it came to me _ just like that.'' he
said later. ``I knew how to do it so it would be commercially
feasible.''
   Fraze's removable top was replaced in the 1970s by a
non-removable tab.

   Hundreds of mourners attending the funeral
of a woman Saturday heard her eulogized as a generous, loving
person who would reject any vengeance against the gunman who killed
her and wounded her husband.
   Charles Stuart remained in critical condition, but a friend read
a letter he wrote from his hospital bed saying how much he would
miss his wife, who gave birth to their first child shortly before
she died.
   ``My life will be empty without you,'' Stuart wrote. ``Now
you're taken away from me. I will never know the feeling of your
hand in mine.''
   Carol Stuart, 30, was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Malden, a
suburb north of Boston, after a funeral Mass that packed St. James
of the Fellsway Church in nearby Medford with about 300 mourners.
   Among the mourners were Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, Boston Mayor
Raymond Flynn and Cardinal Bernard Law.
   The Stuarts were leaving Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston
on Monday night after attending a birthing class when an assailant
commandeered their car and forced them to drive into an adjacent
inner-city neighborhood, where he robbed and shot them.
   Although he'd been shot in the abdomen, Stuart, 29, summoned
police on his car telephone. When police arrived 10 minutes later,
they found that Mrs. Stuart, who was 32 weeks pregnant, had been
shot in the head.
   Mrs. Stuart died shortly after doctors at Brigham and Women's
delivered her son, Christopher. The infant remained hospitalized
Saturday. Officials have declined to discuss his condition.
   Police said they had no new clues and were hoping to see Stuart
again Monday. Stuart was in critical but stable condition at Boston
City Hospital, a spokeswoman said.
   A description Stuart provided Wednesday helped police narrow the
list of suspects to three or four. Investigators now want Stuart to
examine police mug shots.
   ``As soon as he's up to it, we'll be talking to him,'' police
spokesman Scott Gillis said.
   Mrs. Stuart's brother, Carl DiMaiti, praised his sister as
``perhaps the most unselfish person I have ever met,'' and said she
called her parents every night ``just to say `I love you.' ''
   ``My sister really believed in innate goodness of others. I
think the key word to describe her is giving,'' DiMaiti said.
   ``What kind of society tolerates this senseless violence?'' he
said.
   But, he added, ``Carol would be against any and all types of
vengeance and retaliation'' to her killing.
   ``Sweet dreams little sister,'' DiMaiti said as many in the
church wept.

   President Bush on Saturday condemned
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega for a ``shameful'' decision to
end a lengthy cease-fire with the Contras and hinted at renewing
arms for the rebels even as he urged them to avoid military
aggression.
   Ortega, who shattered the tranquility of a two-day Hemispheric
``celebration of democracy'' with his military plans, later
softened his stand and said he would decide Tuesday whether to
extend the cease-fire.
   He accused the Contras of mounting ``waves of attacks'' inside
Nicaragua.
   The two leaders clashed at rival news conferences that upstaged
the ending to the two-day conference, and the most personal
language by far came from Bush.
   The president belittled the leftist Nicaraguan leader as ``this
little man _ showing up in his military uniform at a democracy
meeting,'' and said Ortega ``looks like that unwanted animal at a
garden party.''
   A spokesman for Costa Rica's President Oscar Arias, host of the
gathering, said Ortega had ``dashed cold water on the party, since
he was invited to a party for democracy and should have behaved
properly.''
   ``Nothing like this has ever been seen before,'' said Jorge
Urbina.
   At the United Nations, General Secretary Javier Perez de Cuellar
said he was ``extremely concerned'' about the recent clashes
between the Contras and the Sandinista forces and the apparent
breakdown of the cease-fire.
   He expressed his ``strong wish'' that both sides exercise
restraint so that the peace process may continue.
   In Nicaragua, government troops were reportedly being moved to
strategic points in what could be preparations for new military
operations.
   Government-run Radio Catarran in central Chontales province said
more than 1,000 soldiers from Managua were being transported to
guard the strategically important Rama Road after rebel activity in
the area.
   The final act of the two-day summit _ dedication of an outdoor
``Democracy Plaza'' in the Costa Rican capital _ was played out
without Ortega, who left for home early.
   School children carrying the flags of the nations represented
made up more than half of the crowd, which did not quite fill the
square. Bush watched the ceremony from behind a thick, transparent
bullet-proof shield that had been installed by the Secret Service.
   Before departing, Ortega underscored his intention to break the
19-month-old cease-fire between forces of his leftist Sandinista
government and the Contra guerrillas.
   But after arriving back in Managua, he told reporters he would
announce on Tuesday whether the truce would be extended for another
month, as it has almost monthly since March 1988.
   Ortega said Arias and Carlos Andres Perez, president of
Venezuela, had offered to mediate any discussions between the
United States and the Sandinistas.
   ``The waves of attacks by the counterrevolutionaries have
increased enormously in the last few weeks. The objective is the
destruction of the electoral process in Nicaragua,'' said Ortega,
who is running for re-election in Feb. 25 elections.
   He said he would continue observing the truce only if non-lethal
American aid currently going to the Contras were used, instead, to
demobilize the rebels. Bush said he had encouraged the Contras
``not to take aggressive military action, and we would certainly
continue to do that.''
   In comments after speaking to the Costa Rican journalists
association, Perez pledged to ``work to make sure that Ortega's
decision is not carried out.'' He said he thought the conflict
could still be mediated and that he, Arias and other Latin American
leaders would be able to help.
   After an early morning tennis game with Argentine President
Carlos Saul Menem, Bush met privately with Nicaraguan opposition
presidential candidate Violeta Chamorro and Panamanian opposition
leader Guillermo Endara as well as a group of Costa Rican political
figures.
   He emerged afterwards to tell a news conference that several of
the leaders at the conference have told Ortega it would be ``sheer
folly'' to resume hostilities.
   ``He (Ortega) knows that if there's an all-put military
offensive, that's going to change the equation 180 degrees,'' Bush
said.
   Asked if that meant he would seek more military aid for the
Contras, Bush said, ``We'll let you know. We'll let you know.''
   He also said, ``I don't think the Contras ought to attack. What
we ought to do is fulfill the agreements'' forged by Arias.
   He added, ``We have encouraged the Contras not to take
aggressive military action. And we would certainly continue to do
that.''
   Under Arias' plan, Ortega had agreed to hold free elections in
Nicaragua in February and the United States had withheld military
aid to the Contras.
   Faced with resistance from Congress for providing more arms for
the Contras, Bush reversed eight years of President Ronald Reagan's
policy by endorsing a diplomatic rather than a military solution to
the Nicaraguan conflict.
   Bush, en route back to Washington aboard Air Force One, told
reporters, ``It was a great visit.'' Asked about the tone of his
criticisms of Ortega, Bush said only, ``Speaks for itself.''
   An administration official who asked not to be identified said
Ortega's move may be intended to give the Sandinistas ``an excuse
to tighten up internally'' and ``to have troops out to intimidate
people'' before the February elections.
   At his news conference, Bush blistered Ortega with unrelenting
criticism, sarcasm and insults.
   Professing bewilderment at Ortega's decision, Bush said, ``I
can't figure it out. ... I've asked our own folks, what in heaven's
name would make a person do something so counterproductive _ stick
him out like a sore thumb amongst a bunch of democratically-elected
leaders, offend a host (Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.''
   Referring to his handshake with Ortega on Friday, Bush said,
``He's always kind of sidling up to me looking for some photo op.
What he ought to do is talk to the (Nicaraguan) resistance.''
   Bush called Ortega's action ``a shameful blow to democracy.''
   Warning Ortega not to backtrack from presidential elections on
Feb. 25, Bush said, ``The people of this hemisphere know the
difference between real elections and sham elections, and the
hemisphere will not settle for anything less than free and fair
elections.''
   Bush also took aim at Panamanian ruler, Manuel Antonio Noriega,
saying he represented an outlaw regime that ``simply must be
replaced.''
   The president said Noriega ``may think his lead pipe politics
have won, but he's won nothing more than a fragile status quo. And
democracy really will triumph in Panama, I'm confident of that.''

   A pedestrian bridge with as many as
50 people on it collapsed Saturday afternoon, killing five people
and seriously injuring 18, after some rocked the span back and
forth, authorities said.
   One other person was believed missing after the 50-foot-high,
200- to 300-foot-long steel suspension bridge fell into the Little
Red River in north-central Arkansas, said Wayne Milligan of the
Cleburne County Sheriff's Office.
   Rescue crews, who used chain saws and cranes to remove the
tangled remains of the 77-year-old bridge as darkness fell, found
the bodies of three of the dead around 9 p.m., more than five hours
after the accident.
   There were 30 to 50 people on the popular bridge, including
members of a church group in nearby Prim for their annual meeting
and a Boy Scout troop, when the accident occurred around 3:40 p.m.,
officials said.
   Some of the people rocked the span, Milligan said. ``The cable
on the upstream side broke and the bridge fell to one side. The
other cable broke and the whole thing came down,'' he said.
   ``I had just gotten here and they were rocking the bridge,''
said Daniel Rafferty of Seymour, Mo., who was part of the Free
Holiness church group. ``We thought it was kind of fun and it
scared some people.''
   The collapse ``just happened so quickly that no one had a chance
to cry for help,'' he said. ``... They didn't know what happened.
It was pure terror. Arms were flailing. People were panicking.
Everyone was trying to save themselves.''
   Coroner Dwight Olmstead identified the dead as Jason Williams,
16, of Muldrow, Okla.; Dana Waltman, 11, of Vancleve, Miss.; David
Shane Warren, 13, of Mayfield, Ky.; Catrina Cotrell of Stratford,
Okla., in her mid-20s and Gayla Carlton of Prim, in her 30s.
   Williams and Carlton were found first. The other three bodies
were found in the wreckage.
   Eighteen people were taken to Cleburne County Memorial Hospital
in Heber Springs, which is five miles northwest of the bridge, said
hospital administrator George Fray.
   ``Most of the injuries were broken bones,'' Fray said.
   Nine people were hospitalized, including three who were
transferred to a hospital in Little Rock nearly 60 miles to the
southeast and three who went to a hospital in Searcy nearly 20
miles southeast of Heber Springs, Fray said. The remaining nine
were treated and released.
   Ambulances from three neighboring counties helped take the
injured to hospitals, said county dispatcher Gary Hooten.
   ``At first, there were so many injured, people were taking them
to the hospital in personal cars and police cars,'' Hooten said.
   None of the people fishing in boats near the bridge were hurt,
Milligan said.
   An estimated 100 to 150 people were taking part in the rescue
effort, said county jailer Travis Moss.
   Two large cranes were set up on opposite sides of the river.
   Cranes were brought to lift the wreckage of the bridge and
determine if anyone was underneath, White said. Gov. Bill Clinton
dispatched a National Guard company based in Heber Springs that is
equipped with a large crane, said his press secretary, Mike Gauldin.
   A state Forestry Commission bulldozer was brought there, and
another was on the way.
   The bridge sits in a popular recreational area. It is common for
people on the bridge to try to rock it, said Chuck Howell, manager
of KAWW radio station in Heber Springs.
   The bridge was built in 1912, Milligan said. It was closed to
vehicles in 1972.
   ``It was kept as a walking bridge,'' said Polly Burkeen, whose
Swinging Bridge Boat Dock sits below the span. ``It was placed on
the National Register of Historic Places four years ago.''
   ``There's nothing left standing but the pylons on the bank,''
she said.

<HEAD>Report: Flaw That Led to Crash Happened in Manufacture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators believe a flaw developed
in the manufacture of an engine part of United Airlines Flight 232
caused the plane's mid-air explosion over Iowa in July, according
to a published report.
   The DC-10 jet, which lost its hydraulic flight controls July 19,
in the breakup of its tail-mounted engine, crashed in flames in an
attempted landing at Sioux City that killed 112 of the 296 people
on board.
   A federal hearing on Tuesday will focus on whether the problem
in the engine's fan disk should have been detected before the
crash, The Washington Post reported in its Sunday editions.
   The Federal Aviation Administration last month ordered
metallurgical tests on the engine disks of other aircraft that were
made in the same manufacturing process.
   Officials for the National Transportation Safety Board, which is
investigating the crash, could not be reached for comment late
Saturday.
   Investigators discovered a crack in the engine's fan disk, which
they found in an Iowa cornfield earlier this month, which they have
suspected led to the explosion and loss of the plane's hydraulic
system.
   ``The origin of the crack appears to be the thing that started
the whole sequence of events,'' Anthony J. Broderick, FAA acting
executive director for regulatory standards and compliance, told
the Post.
   Broderick also said detailed inspections of the disk from the
flight indicate the crack began with an internal flaw caused by the
``double melting'' process used to make the titanium in the disk 19
years ago.
   Further tests have been ordered by the government are expected
to be completed no sooner than February.

   Rescue workers Saturday recovered the
bodies of six more victims of the explosion at the Phillips
Petroleum Co. plastics plant, raising the death toll to at least
the 13, officials said.
   The search for nine other workers missing since Monday's
explosions continued around the clock.
   The search has been stymied by debris up to 40 feet high near
the control and finishing room, where it's expected the missing
workers will be found, said company spokesman Rob Phillips.
   The blasts injured 124 people.
   Until Saturday, seven bodies had been recovered. Five bodies
were found early Saturday, and the sixth was found during the
afternoon, said Phillips spokesman Rob Phillips.
   Only four of the dead have been positively identified, said Jere
Smith, another Phillips spokesman. Identification has been slow
because the victims were burned beyond recognition, forcing medical
examiners to use dental records.
   Two of the dead that have been identified are Phillips employees
James H. Campbell, 30, of Baytown, and Jeffrey L. Harrison, 36, of
Houston, said Sheryl Tumis of the Harris County Medical Examiner's
office.
   The other two are Jose Gonzales, 38, of Galena Park and William
Scott Martin, 28, of Dayton. Both men worked for Fish Construction
Co., which was doing contract work for Phillips.
   Several hundred people, including investigators, search crews
and demolition workers, were at the plant on a 24-hour basis, Rob
Phillips said.
   The factory accounts for nearly 20 percent of the nation's
production of plastic pellets used in the manufacture of milk jugs
and grocery bags.
   The company believes flammable hydrocarbon vapor from ethylene
and isobutane gases escaped from a leaking chemical reactor,
triggering the blasts But Phillips officials have said they don't
know how the gases were ignited.
   The company, city officials and the employees' union have
organized a memorial service Monday evening for the dead and
missing workers.
   Phillips has established a memorial fund to aid the families of
workers killed at the plant.

   President Bush is meeting with
Nicaraguan and Panamanian opposition leaders today to wrap up a
Latin American ``celebration of democracy'' that was jolted by
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega's decision to end a cease-fire
with U.S.-backed rebels.
   Ortega said he was ending the cease-fire because of ``savage
attacks'' by Contra forces on peasants trying to register to vote
in elections scheduled for Feb. 25.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III would not comment on
whether the Contras had indeed broken the cease-fire, but said
Ortega's decision would be interpreted as a ``desperate attempt to
cancel the elections.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater called the
Nicaraguan decision ``incredible.''

concessions announced by the new Communist leadership.
   The demonstrations in Dresden, Karl-Marx-Stadt, Senftenberg and
Saalfeld late Friday came after authorities declared amnesty for
demonstrators, for people who have left the country illegally and
for thousands who have been jailed for trying to escape.
   The amnesty was the the most dramatic move that Egon Krenz has
taken since he became Communist Party chief last week, taking over
from hard-line leader Erich Honecker.
   Leaders of the pro-democracy opposition praised the action, but
said it was not enough.

   The Energy Department is suspending commercial
shipments of tritium for the second time in four months because of
another unexplained loss of the material used in nuclear warheads.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., lambasted the department Friday,
saying it had bungled the investigation at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tenn.
   ``You have to wonder what kind of Keystone Kops operation the
Department of Energy has down at Oak Ridge when they lose more than
22,000 curies of tritium in a test designed to find out why DOE
keeps on losing track of tritium,'' he said. A curie is the unit
used to measure radioactivity.
   The department usually sells about $5.6 million of tritium a

   The chairman of a House panel investigating

   ``I have high hopes the Justice Department will do its duty,''
subcommittee chairman Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said Friday after
former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. again refused to testify.
   Lantos excused Pierce from a subpoena requiring another

its inquiry.
   The subcommittee, Lantos said, had ``demonstrated a colossal

restaurant, shouting slogans such as, ``Wild game is not a treat.''
   ``This is symbolic of the really decadent, disrespectful
attitude that, unfortunately, our society exhibits,'' said Steve
Siegel of Trans-Species Unlimited. ``Some of them are endangered
animals. They're making a game out of it, making a fun experience
out of the suffering of these animals.''

<HEAD>Dust Settles, Rubble Left</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now that the dust has settled, the rubble
remains.
   It ranges from 1\ miles of collapsed Interstate 880 to the
kindling-sized splinters of destroyed houses around the Bay area.
   Disposing of the mess will be a major problem for months after
the Oct. 17 earthquake, and already garbage bins are as ubiquitous
as espresso machines.
   No formal accounting has been made, although it is unlikely to
approach the 11 million cubic yards produced by 28,000 destroyed
buildings in 1906.
   In a tragic irony, much of that rubble was pushed into San
Francisco Bay and covered with sand to form the foundation of the
posh Marina district. In the latest quake, the landfill turned to
jelly, amplifying the shaking and destroying 60 buildings. The
quake also uncovered a brick and a piece of concrete from the 1906
rubble.
   It is a cycle that may be repeated this time, although not with
homes. Officials say the biggest piece of rubble, the Interstate
880 viaduct, may be ground up and used as landfill in Oakland.
   That frustrates quake experts who for years have warned against
such practices, with little result in the land-hungry Bay area.
   ``We know and have said for a long time that (landfill is) a
more risky place to build and this earthquake confirms that,'' said
Andrew Pitt, a scientist for the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo
Park.
   Landfills ordinarily appear solid, ``but under earthquake
shaking they essentially liquefy and offer the ground above no
support and you have a major failure,'' Pitt said.
   Despite the lessons of history, building on landfill continues.
San Francisco voters go to the polls Nov. 7 to decide whether to
build a new baseball stadium. The proposed site is on landfill.
   Land is so expensive and devastating earthquakes so far apart
that people are encouraged to take their chances, said Pat
Jorgenson of the USGS. After all, it was 83 years between
devastating quakes in San Francisco. ``Every generation figures it
won't happen in my lifetime.''
   If the ground is properly compacted and clay is added, and if
expensive techniques are used, it can be safe to build on landfill,
she said. But many of the buildings destroyed in the quake were not
built with modern techniques.
   In a briefing last week, the USGS said many of the problems had
been known about before the 7.1 magnitude quake: ``The greatest
loss of life and damage to property during the Loma Prieta
earthquake occurred in areas where geologic hazards had been
clearly identified and mapped as early as 15 years ago.''
   The outer perimeter of San Francisco, including the
highrise-studded Financial District, was built as landfill claimed
the bay. It is a constant source of worry that the anticipated Big
One will liquefy the ground and topple the buildings.
   The pattern of damage in the latest quake suggests that could
happen.
   I-880, whose collapse killed dozens, was built on landfill.
   So was the heavily damaged Embarcadero Freeway, which will be
closed three months. So was Candlestick Park, which suffered slight
damage.
   The main runway of the Oakland airport is on landfill, and 3,000
feet of it sank. So did the busy Seventh Street terminal at the
Port of Oakland, which handles 7 percent of the freight at the
nation's fourth-busiest port. It was resting on landfill.
   In other parts of the earthquake zone, the problem wasn't
landfill but ancient streams that have been built over but produce
the same earthquake result as landfill.
   In Los Gatos, where 30 buildings collapsed, the town was built
on old stream deposits that had gathered in a wet geologic bowl.
When the land gave way so did the buildings. The story was the same
in Watsonville, where 195 buildings and 106 mobile homes were
destroyed and 235 suffered major damage.
   The heavily damaged Pacific Garden Mall in Santa Cruz lies on
stream deposits that also liquefied in the 1906 quake.
   Despite its landfill-related damage, Oakland has requested the
rubble from I-880, to shore up quake-damaged areas, said port
spokesman Mel Wax. ``They'd have to crush it and remove the steel
so all that was left was aggregate'' which can be mixed to form
cement, he said.
   ``As long as you don't have an earthquake it's quite good.''
   The ground-up freeway would be stored on seven acres at the
airport and used as needed, he said.
   The freeway rubble weighs about 40,000 tons, said Jim Drago of
the California Department of Transportation, which owns the mess.
   Department officials say the contractors chosen soon to remove
the debris will decide who gets the rubble.
   Another alternative causing controversy is a proposal to place
the rubble onto barges and dump it 42 miles out to sea at a Navy
dump site, where it would serve as fish habitat.
   Environmentalists and U.S. Rep. Tony Lantos, D-Calif., oppose
the proposal, saying the rubble could hurt fishing.
   While government agencies will foot the bill to remove public
structures, homeowners have to pay for their own demolition and
removal.
   Most of the hundreds of destroyed homes will be buried in the
Zanker Road Resource and Recovery Inc. landfill near San Jose, a
bayside garbage and recycling facility that will never be overbuilt
with homes, said site engineer Mike Gross.
   For the next two months, the company expects 1,500 cubic yards
of quake-related debris a day, and has added 10 workers to handle
the load. It costs $5.30 to $8.50 per cubic yard to bury debris at
the landfill, he said.
   ``We currently recycle 33 percent of incoming material, and that
should increase to 40 to 45 percent,'' he said. Most valuable items
include old bricks, wood, metals, concrete and dirt.
   In Watsonville, contractors are eager to recover construction
materials, said City Clerk Lorraine Washington. ``We've had a
number of contractors call and volunteer to bring dump trucks in.
They are chomping at the bit to get more brick.''
   Demolition of downtown businesses worth $200 million is to begin
Monday, Mrs. Washington said. The federal government will pay to
remove buildings considered a public danger, but owners are
responsible otherwise.
   In San Francisco, which has 250 buildings considered unsafe, two
garbage operators have offered to go through the rubble of
destroyed homes as they dispose of the structures at the Zanker
landfill, said Michele Pla of the Department of Public Works.
   ``They clearly are looking for irreplaceable items'' which will
be returned to owners, she said.

<HEAD>Exxon Exit Reflects Deepening Problem For New York's Business Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three hundred departing jobs might not mean much
in a metropolitan work force of 3 million, but when the company
exiting with them is oil giant Exxon Corp. it sends a profound
message about New York's eroding reputation as the national
front-office capital.
   Exxon, the world's largest oil company and third-largest
American industrial concern after General Motors Corp. and Ford
Motor Co., announced the impending closure of its 107-year home
base in New York this past week.
   The company is moving the headquarters to the Dallas-Fort Worth
area, where it will save on rent, taxes, building costs and
employee commuting time.
   How much it will save remains unclear. But the gleaming 54-story
building the company has occupied in midtown Manhattan rents for
about $50 a square foot, vs. about $10 for the temporary space
Exxon will move into until a new headquarters is constructed on a
former ranch in a Dallas suburb.
   Of course, the departure isn't like GM or Ford shutting down a
factory in a one-factory town. It is likely that new tenants will
replace Exxon and the outside world will barely notice. Much of the
building's space was occupied by other tenants already.
   New York officials, surprised and annoyed by Exxon's
announcement, quickly emphasized what they called the city's
strength in retaining businesses, despite the high-profile
departures of other corporate giants in recent years ranging from
retailer J.C. Penney &amp; Co. to Trans World Airlines.
   ``Although Exxon is certainly a major company in New York, in
the country and the world, the practical matter is they employed
300 people here,'' said Stanley Grayson, deputy mayor for finance
and economic development.
   But others said it wasn't the 300 jobs that New York should
worry about. Instead, they emphasized the symbolic meaning of
Exxon's departure in a city where symbolism is a crucial element of
attracting business in the first place.
   ``New York is very much dependent on its image,'' said Samuel
Ehrenhalt, regional administrator for the Bureau of Labor
Statistics and an authority on the New York area's economy.
   ``If everybody else is here, this is the place to be,'' he said.
``If this is the place of action, then people will be here. New
York is based on the people that make it creative and exciting.
That reflects its key role as a national and international
financial and business service center.''
   More than 100 leading American corporations make their home in
New York, more than any other single U.S. city. In addition,
thousands of other companies have important New York office
operations.
   But Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show that employment in
New York's corporate administrative-office category has fallen from
54,000 jobs 10 years ago to about 29,000 now.
   The significance of these numbers goes beyond simple arithmetic.
Thousands of other jobs, from advertising executives to janitors to
restaurateurs, are directly dependent on the front-office segment
of New York's economy.
   In addition, the departure of big-name companies like Exxon is
coming at a time when the Northeast's economy is softening. This
makes it less likely, for example, that major trade organizations
will book conventions in New York, opting instead for cheaper areas
or meetings close to home.
   To a large extent, the departure of Exxon reflects the
technological leaps made during the 1980s, enabling corporations to
do business by telephone, computer networks and facsimile machines.
That means they can be headquartered practically anywhere there's a
phone and an electrical outlet.
   ``I think what we see here is a picture of increasing
vulnerability as a result of stiffening competitive pressures and
improvements that permits relocation of companies historically
based in the city,'' Ehrenhalt said. ``It means the city must look
to shore up its competitive strengths.''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Wall Street spoke with two voices on a computerized form of
stock trading that critics blame for roiling the market. Several
key brokerages said they would restrict use of one type of
so-called program trading because an investor outcry. But the New
York Stock Exchange began trading in a new product called a ``stock
basket'' that makes program trading much easier.
   _Prospects of a debt-financed takeover for UAL Corp. grew more
distant, reflecting an increased resistance to the use of
high-yield ``junk bonds'' to bankroll corporate acquisitions.
Directors of the parent of United Airlines said they wanted to keep
the company independent.
   _The Big Three automakers reported sharply lower third-quarter
earnings due the high cost of summertime incentives aimed at
peddling more vehicles. At the same time, a takeover battle
appeared to be emerging between General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor
Co. for Britain's luxury carmaker Jaguar.
   _Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said the central bank
could erase inflation with painful short-term policies, but he
evidently wasn't including beer drinkers in his analysis. They
could benefit from lower inflation without pain due to aggressive
price-cutting plans announced by Anheuser Busch Cos., which were
part of an industry-wide price war.

<HEAD>Stocks' New Problem: Lagging Profits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporate profits, often relegated to a
subordinate role in recent years, have staged a strong comeback as
a driving force in the stock market.
   But unhappily for investors who like their news upbeat, the
earnings news that has been capturing most of the attention has
been negative.
   And as Wall Street looks ahead to 1990, uneasy talk is starting
to revive of a recession or at least a ``bumpy landing'' for the
economy.
   ``A steady drumbeat of disappointing earnings reports lent a
dolorous tone to financial markets last week,'' said economists at
Merrill Lynch in their weekend appraisal of the financial outlook.
``Unfortunately, more of the same is likely in the period ahead.''
   Many optimists on Wall Street have long been counting on the
Federal Reserve to stave off any impending slump by relaxing its
credit policy and setting up a ``soft landing'' for businesses,
consumers and the markets.
   Indeed, the Fed seemed to carry out just such a mission adroitly
during the summer, when a recession scare hit the Street. Many
observers now think circumstances will soon prompt the Fed to ease
again.
   But some wonder whether the central bank can keep succeeding in
its fine-tuning efforts to restrain inflation without putting
businesses through a period of pain.
   ``The Fed may have waited too long,'' say the economists S. Jay
Levy and David A. Levy in the new edition of their newsletter
Industry Forecast. ``The expansion is looking sicker almost every
day.
   ``A recession in the coming nine months, while not a certainty,
is now more probable than not. The United States economy may
already have passed the business cycle peak.''
   Government data issued Thursday seemed to suggest growth still
was slogging along at a slow-to-moderate clip. Preliminary figures
for the third quarter showed the gross national product expanding
at a 2.5 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation,
matching the pace set in the second quarter.
   But a lot of the third-quarter strength was concentrated in
consumer spending, especially for cars, that many analysts consider
unlikely to persist.
   On Wall Street, many traders' view of consumer stocks already
has been soured by signs of intensified price competition in
businesses ranging from fast-food restaurants to beer.
   The stock market fell steadily all through the past week,
leaving the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials with a loss of
92.42 points at 2,596.72, wiping out most of the previous week's
119.88 gain.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 6.52 to
185.60; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
fell 18.30 to 452.33, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was down 12.56 at 370.01.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 175.01 million shares a day,
against 234.04 million the week before.
   Whatever weakness in corporate profits might mean to the stock
market, many analysts believe it will soon be a plus for higher
government bond prices and lower interest rates.
   The recent inflation news has been better than expected, they
note, giving the Fed more apparent maneuvering room to pursue a
stimulative credit policy.
   ``Inflation has been beaten for the moment,'' contends John
Connolly at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``We believe that
fourth-quarter growth will be the slowest of the year.
   ``The Fed will soon conclude that the major danger is economic
weakness, not strength.''

<HEAD>Investors Warm to Thrift Bailout Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's savings and loan
bailout plan has passed a crucial test with better marks than
expected.
   The introductory sale last week of 30-year bonds used to raise
money for rescuing the nation's sickly thrifts went without a hitch.
   Despite familiar rumblings in the credit markets that the supply
would be tough to absorb and distribute profitably, demand was good
at the auction of the dubiously nicknamed ``bailout bonds.'' The
average yield on the $4.52 billion of tenders accepted was 8.15
percent.
   Nearly $13 billion in bids were received at what was the first
30-year bond auction by Resolution Funding Corp. _ known as Refcorp
_ which was created to raise some of the cash needed to save
troubled savings institutions.
   What is called the bid-to-cover ratio was 2.87 to 1. The ratio,
which compares the number of bids received to the number accepted,
is a measure of investor demand.
   Surprisingly, the ratio produced in the bailout bond auction was
better than at recent sales of 30-year Treasury bonds, historically
considered the best-quality government debt securities.
   Part of the bailout-bond buying interest came from bond dealers
planning to ``strip'' the issue for repackaging as a zero-coupon
security.
   The dealers intend to sever the interest payment part of the
bond from the principal payment portion and sell the two pieces
separately at a deep discount to face value, or par. Zeros are
bonds lacking the coupons that entitle a bondholder to periodic
interest payments _ all the interest is paid at maturity.
   ``I am very pleased with how well the auction went,'' said
Michael E. Basham, deputy assistant Treasury secretary.
   Given that the bond market always gets edgy ahead of long-term
debt auctions _ particularly when new types of securities are
involved _ Basham said ``It went exceptionally well.''
   As expected, the bailout bonds sold Wednesday went for a slight
premium over the yield on recently auctioned Treasury issues of the
same maturity. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond closed trading
in the credit markets Wednesday at an average yield of 7.88
percent, making the premium 0.27 point.
   The market doesn't perceive Refcorp's bonds to be quite as
unshakable as regular Treasury securities, which have the
comforting support of the federal government's full faith and
credit.
   But the government does guarantee that interest and principal
will be paid on Refcorp's bonds, granting them almost the same
strong backing. Market analysts say once investors become
accustomed to dealing with the bailout bonds, the spread between
Treasuries and Refcorp issues will shrink.
   ``I think this is a name that people eventually will become
familiar with and a little bit more comfortable with,'' says Carol
A. Stone, a senior economist at Nomura Securities International
Inc. ``Subsequently, we can look for narrower spreads between the
Treasury's 30-year bonds and Refcorp's.''
   Refcorp has authority to issue up to $30 billion in 30-year
bonds and it is expected that auctions will be held once a quarter.
Basham said the next sale likely would occur in January.

<HEAD>Hog Market Apparently Peaks, Ending 6-Week Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pork producers are bracing for a drop in hog prices after an
unusual autumn rally appeared to reach its peak in the past week.
   But analysts say the descent probably will be less dramatic than
the dizzying six-week rise because farmers marketed hogs
aggressively as prices climbed and the animals now coming to market
are smaller than in past years.
   On other commodity markets in the past week, copper prices
nosedived amid fears that the stock market's gyrations signal
economic troubles ahead; precious metals rallied; energy prices
fell; wheat retreated; and corn and soybeans held steady.
   The hog futures market appeared to peak on Monday when the
contract for December delivery reached 47.90 cents a pound on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The price fell to 46.17 cents by the
end of trading Friday.
   Monday's high price represented a 16 percent increase in hog
futures since Sept. 8, the starting point for the market's surge.
   Analysts cited two main reasons for the upswing, which defied
the normal seasonal pattern: high beef prices and strong Japanese
demand for U.S. pork.
   Beef prices reached record highs last spring, partly due to
drought-related herd thinning during the previous summer, and
haven't backed off much since.
   With beef so expensive, consumers gravitated toward lower-priced
pork. Retailers seeking to fill that demand bid up wholesale pork
prices, and the increase worked its way back to the meatpackers who
buy hogs from producers.
   Meanwhile, tighter supplies of pork from Denmark and Taiwan
forced the Japanese to increase their purchases of U.S. pork by 30
percent over a year ago, according to a recent report from the
futures brokerage Allendale Inc.
   As a result, cash hog prices soared and are expected to average
about $48 per hundredweight this month in Iowa and southern
Minnesota compared with about $40 last October.
   And for only the second time in the last 20 years, according to
analyst Charles Levitt of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the October
average hog price will be near or higher than the July average,
which was $48.22 per hundredweight this year compared with $46.59
in 1988.
   The runup peaked at the wholesale level about two weeks ago as
the Japanese completed their buying, hog slaughters approached
their seasonal peak, consumer demand slackened due to the higher
pork prices and retailers began shifting their sights to obtaining
poultry for the upcoming holidays.
   On Monday, Oct. 16, Levitt said, fresh pork loins were quoted at
$1.21 a pound. One week later, the price had dropped to $1.10 to
$1.12. And by this past Thursday, the price had fallen further, to
$1.04 to $1.07.
   Levitt said hog prices are likely to continue weakening through
Thanksgiving. But because producers were active sellers during the
rally, cash hog prices may not drop much below $44 per
hundredweight, he said.
   ``Because the hogs are lighter in weight and producers are much
more current on marketings, we are could get a much softer landing
this time than we have in recent years and especially last year,''
he said, when cash hogs bottomed at less than $38.

<HEAD>Copper</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Copper prices weakened steadily through the week, reaching new
2{-month lows on New York's Commodity Exchange. The selling was
linked to an improved supply outlook and to recession fears fueled
by the stock market's erratic moves, which included sharp drops on
Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.
   Copper is heavily used in construction and industrial
applications and a weaker economy would reduce demand for the metal.
   Copper for December delivery settled Friday at $1.1580 a pound
compared with $1.2345 a week earlier and $1.3050 the week before
that.

   Gold and silver benefited from the stock-market jitters as

   The Black &amp; Decker Corp. said Friday it has
agreed to sell its Bostik chemical adhesives and sealants business
to French chemical company Orkem SA for $345 million.
   The sale is one of several planned divestitures of subsidiaries
acquired when the power tool manufacturer purchased Emhart Corp.
earlier this year, company officials said.
   Black &amp; Decker said the sales will integrate the Emhart
operations into its own operations and reduce debt from the
acquisition.
   ``We are pleased that Bostik will be in the hands of an
international chemical company that can expand and develop it to
the benefit of its customers and employees,'' said Nolan D.
Archibald, president and chief executive officer of Black &amp; Decker.
   ``Additional divestitures will be announced in the near future.
Our divestiture program is on schedule, and we remain confident
that we will achieve our stated goal of over $1 billion in net
proceeds,'' Archibald said.
   Black and Decker is a leading marketer and manufacturer of power
